Shelby, Shelby attended Irving High School, and obtained his BA in History,The Irving Daily News Texan from Irving, Texas on June 3, 1962. his MA from Vanderbilt University, and his PhD from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1962 with the thesis, entitled \\"The technical supervision of masonry construction in medieval England.\\" After graduation Shelby started his academic career at the Southern Illinois University, where he served his whole career. He started as lecturer in history, became assistant professor of history in 1963, associate professor in history in 1966, and associate dean of the Graduate School in 1968, and eventually Professor of Sociology. After his retirement in the new millennium he was appointed Professor Emeritus of Speech Communication at the Southern Illinois University. == Work ==  The geometrical knowledge of mediaeval master masons, 1972  In the 1972 article \\"The geometrical knowledge of mediaeval master masons,\\" Shelby reconstructed the knowledge of practical geometry in the realm of the mason.Glen, Elizabeth Jane. The transmission of medieval mathematics and the origins of gothic architecture. Sweet Briar College, 2005. p. 20 About the motivation of this study Shelby (1972) explained that: Techniques of surveying, Villard de Honnecourt, 1230-35. :\\"...during the past one hundred and fifty years numerous scholars have searched for the geometrical canons which supposedly were used by master masons in the design and construction of mediaeval churches. But in this search for one of the keys to an understanding of mediaeval architecture, these scholars have seldom asked themselves what was the actual character and content of the geometrical knowledge which a mediaeval master mason might have been expected to possess?\\"Shelby (1972, 395) In his paper Shelby attempted to answer this particular question. After reconsidering the normal kind of education in those days with the trivium and quadrivium, Shelby suggested, that it appears, that medieval master masons didn't receive their geometrical knowledge from formal schooling but from oral tradition.Shelby (1972, 398) This tradition, however, disappeared at the close of the Gothic building in Europe in the 14th century with the dying of the oral tradition in general. Instead little books on the technical aspects of building emerged in the late Middle Ages. Also medieval scholars had an interest in practical geometry, and shared their thoughts on this topic in numerous treatises.Shelby (1972, 399) After comparison geometrical works and classical geometry of Euclid and Archimedes Shelby finds hardly any resemblance. According to Shelby (1972): :\\"Mathematically speaking, it was simple in the extreme; once it is recognized that there was virtually no Euclidean-type reasoning involved, the way is cleared for understanding the kind of geometrical thinking which the masons did employ. This non-mathematical technique I have labelled constructive geometry, to indicate the masons‚Äô concern with the construction and manipulation of geometrical forms. It becomes evident that the ‚Äúart of geometry‚Äù for mediaeval masons meant the ability to perceive design and building problems in terms of a few basic geometrical figures which could be manipulated through a series of carefully prescribed steps to produce the points, lines and curves needed for the solution of the problems. Since these problems ranged across the entire spectrum of the work of the masons ‚Äî stereotomy, statics, proportion, architectural design and drawings ‚Äî the search by modern scholars for the geometrical canons of mediaeval architecture is appropriate enough, so long as we keep clearly in mind the kind of geometry that was actually used by the masons. The nature of that geometry suggests that these canons, when recovered, will not be universal laws which will at last provide the key to mediaeval architecture; rather, they will be particular procedures used by particular master masons at particular times and places.\\"Shelby (1972, 420-421) == Reception == In the Arts of the Medieval Cathedrals Nolan and Sandron (2016) credited Shelby's translations and commentaries on early medieval works on construction, stating: :\\"Many scholars have discussed these booklets over the years, but Lon R.

He was one of the biggest stars and most prominent heels of the early television era of wrestling and, in May 1952, was a part of professional wrestling's first $100,000 gate, when he faced Lou Thesz in a title vs. title bout. ==Early life== Leone was born to parents Giovanni and Anna Leone in Pettorano sul Gizio, in the Abruzzo region of Italy; the same home region as fellow professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino. Though his parents disapproved, Michele began wrestling at a young age. According to Leone he was champion of his area by age 14. Any money he earned in his initial wrestling endeavours were reinvested into wrestling lessons. Little is known of his early wrestling career. He reportedly became moderately well known on the European circuit and once visited South America to wrestle. ==Professional wrestling career==  New York, East Coast and D.C. territories  After completing his training and gaining ring experience in Europe around 1935, Leone migrated to the United States, arriving in New York City in early 1938. On April 18th, Leone won his American debut by defeating Vanka Zelezniak in New York City. On June 28, 1938 he wrestled his first known main event in the U.S. against Dr. John \\"Dropkick\\" Murphy. In June, 1940, Leone began wrestling in Joe Turner‚Äôs Washington DC territory. It was whilst wrestling here that the United States entered World War II. The U.S. was now at war with Leone's native Italy, which made him an instant heel. As an Italian citizen, Leone was exempt from being drafted into the military and as more and more wrestlers were drafted, it opened up new spots on cards for Leone as a top heel. He would become a headliner in DC, notably feuding in headline bouts against ‚ÄúGentleman‚Äù Lou Plummer. Attendance rose steadily with Leone in the main event. Memorably, he headlined one such event against Hans Kampfer, a German, where he worked as the heel. It is said that this match illustrated his abilities as a 'bad guy', having gotten boos from the fans in a match against a German during World War II. Leone left the D.C. territory at the end of the war in 1945 and began wrestling throughout the East Coast. He briefly returned to Europe in 1947 before returning to the U.S. East Coast in 1948. Leone known for his rough style and heelish tactics would sometimes be cheered as a baby face. Such instance occurred on November 27th, 1944 in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Facing Duke Keomuka (a Hawaiian portraying and evil Japanese wrestler) Leone went out prior to their match and gave a passionate promo against the Japanese. For his effort, he sold $2,000 is U.S. War Bonds prior to defeating Duke Keomuka. He would also appear at charity events to sell U.S. War bonds in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania often taking place at the Navy Yard Receiving Station in that city. On June 26, 1944 Leone received his first \\"World\\" title match against Babe Sharkey (claimant to an East Coast version) in Wilmington, Delaware. Leone lost but it was noted that this title match drew one of the biggest crowds ever in Wilmington. The weekly average was roughly 900 but this match drew over 1,800 fans. On January 19, 1949, Leone made his return to the D.C. territory, wrestling in a losing effort against Gorgeous George in the main event. The show also featured a young Stu Hart on the card.  California territory  Michele made his debut in Johnny Doyle's Los Angeles/Southern California territory in October 1949, where he took up the mantle of \\"Baron\\" Michele Leone, an Italian aristocrat. It is here that he would find his greatest success. With an abundance of wrestling television outlets in Southern California, and possessing the gift of the gab, Leone - working for Doyle - became the biggest star in the L.A. territory. The still relatively new medium of television helped transform him from journeyman to superstar. Leone headlined several events at the Olympic Auditorium against opponents such as Leo Garibaldi, Jack Claybourne and Kimon Kudo. He would also tag with former opponent Gorgeous George. On March 8, 1950, Leone wrestled future WWF Hall of Famer Antonino Rocca in front of a sold out 10,400 fans. 6,000 fans were also reportedly turned away at the gate. World Heavyweight Championship and Feud with Lou Thesz Leone faced Enrique Torres at the Olympic Auditorium on November 22, 1950, in front of a reported 10,400 fans in a two-out-of-three falls match for the Los Angeles version of the World Heavyweight Championship. He captured the second and third falls of the match to win the world title. As world champion and with a growing television audience, Leone became one of the biggest sports stars in Southern California and the biggest draw in the territory. Appearing on television shows such as Charlie Aldridge, Dennis Day and Horace Heidt's Family Night Show, Leone raised his profile, with few wrestlers throughout the United States getting the exposure he was. An appearance at a store in the city of Oxnard drew over 1,000 fans, despite heavy rain. Leone gave female fans an orchard and gave every fan an autographed photo of himself.‚Äù Leone, with a combination of heel heat and broad appeal, carried the territory to new financial heights. NWA World Heavyweight champion Lou Thesz came to the territory in July 1951 and, finding himself overshadowed by Leone, was reportedly unhappy with this status. Thesz addressed these concerns at the annual NWA member's meeting in Tulsa, where the prospect of eliminating the California-version of the world title (held by Leone) was discussed. Doyle - a member of the championship committee - agreed to not book Michele Leone (or Enrique Torres) as champions outside of California. This did not assuage the NWA's concerns of a growing regional \\"world champion\\" and Doyle, who had been suspended briefly by the NWA, agreed to a unification bout. On May 21, 1952, Leone lost the L.A. \\"Olympic\\" version of the world title to Lou Thesz at Hollywood's Gilmore Field in L.A. in a unification match. The event drew 25,256 fans and took $103,277.75 at the gate, making it the first professional wrestling match to garner over $100,000 at the gate Junior Heavyweight Championship and Later Career Though having lost the championship, the Baron remained the top draw in the Southern California territory. In December 1952, he defeated Rito Romero at the Olympic Auditorium to win the Pacific Coast heavyweight championship. Leone would go on to defeat Danny McShane for the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship on August 16, 1953 at Hollywood's Legion Stadium in Hollywood. Leone's television popularity made him an in-demand talent and he was able to take bookings throughout the United States. He remained a regular performer in Los Angeles while working a semi- regular schedule in the Georgia territory. He left L.A. in 1954, and relocated to Texas. He would wrestle Lou Thesz in losing efforts three more times for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship; on February 16, 1954 in El Paso, Texas, October 13, 1954 in Tulsa, Oklahoma and February 25, 1955 in Miami, Florida. == Later Life and Death == Shortly after his final bout with Thesz, Leone retired from professional wrestling, being independently wealthy from his career. He returned to Italy along with his wife, Billie, whom he married 1954. They returned to the United States and relocated back to Leone's apartment building in Santa Monica. Michele and Billie travelled frequency and Leone spent his later days partaking in various leisure activities by the Pacific Ocean. Whilst crossing the street near his home on November 14, 1988, Leone was struck by an automobile. He died at UCLA Medical Center on November 26, 1988. ==Personal life== Leone married his wife Billie in 1954, with whom he remained for the rest of his life. During his career, he became a star in Southern California, and outside of wrestling he was hired by ABC to host a television programme, \\"Advice to the Lovelorn\\", offering advise to couples. ==Legacy== Michele Leone was one of the first wrestling stars of the television era. His colorful interviews, 'bad guy' characteristics and affable personality, endeared him to viewing audiences as an entertaining performer. He was one of the first professional wrestlers, along with the likes of Gorgeous George, to be famed for his showmanship as well as his in-ring prowess. In the 2000s , his wife Billie donated $100,000 in Michele's memory to the Santa Monica Historical Society Museum. Symbolically, this was the same amount which Leone drew with Lou Thesz during their May, 1952 bout for the NWA Heavyweight championship; the first $100,000 gate in wrestling. The amount was donated to help support construction of the museum's relocation. Billie Leone stated: ‚Äúmy husband moved to Santa Monica in 1949, and that began his lifelong love affair with Santa Monica. He loved everything about the city.‚Äù The museum now houses a permanent exhibit featuring the highlights of The Baron‚Äôs career. == Championships and accomplishments == *National Wrestling Alliance **World Heavyweight Championship (Los Angeles version) (one time) **NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (one time) **NWA Pacific Coast Heavyweight Championship (Los Angeles version) (two times) *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame **Class of 2019 == References == Category:1909 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Italian male professional wrestlers Category:Pedestrian road incident deaths Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum ","title":"Baron Michele Leone"},{"id":"54201475","text":"The 2013 Asian Canoe Slalom Championships were the 8th Asian Canoe Slalom Championships and took place from May 23‚Äì26, 2013 in Shuili River, Shuili, Taiwan. ==Medal summary== Individual { - Men's C-1    - rowspan=2Men's C-2 rowspan=2 Pan Hung-ming Chang Yun-chuan  Lee Han-cheng Chiu Huai-chun  Wu Tai-yi Chen Bo-wun -  Shota Sasaki Tsubasa Sasaki  Chaaue Pala Chatuphon Thimthong - rowspan=2Men's K-1 rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - Women's C-1    - rowspan=2Women's K-1 rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  } Team { - Men's C-1  Chiu Huai-chun Chang Yun-chuan Chen Bo-wun  Alexandr Kulikov Svetlana Polezhayeva Yekaterina Lukicheva  Yutthakan Chaidet Chaaue Pala Chatuphon Thimthong - Men's K-1  Kazuya Adachi Kazuki Yazawa Daichi Kojima  Lee Han-cheng Lu Yu-jen Pan Hung-ming  Hermann Husslein Ekwit Chuapoon Siwanat Bullard - Women's K-1  Yuriko Takeshita Yoshika Ito Ren Mishima  Chang Chu-han Liu Jen-yu Rao Chih-shuan  Sirijit Onnom Nipaporn Nopsri Chayanin Sripadung } ==Medal tableReferences== *Results ==External links== *Japan Canoe Federation Canoe Asian Canoe Slalom Championships Category:Asian Canoeing Championships Category:International sports competitions hosted by Taiwan ","title":"2013 Asian Canoe Slalom Championships"},{"id":"54201496","text":"The 2001 Marconi Grand Prix of Cleveland was a Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) motor race held on July 1, 2001 at Burke Lakefront Airport in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. It was the 9th round of the 2001 CART FedEx Championship Series season. Team Green driver Dario Franchitti won the race after narrowly escaping a first-turn pile-up and then by gambling on a fuel- saving strategy that saw his car run out of fuel just after crossing the finish line ahead of a hard-charging Memo Gidley and Bryan Herta. Franchitti had won his first race since 1999 and the first for Team Green since Vancouver in 2000, vaulting the driver to 3rd in the points standings. Gidley took his first career podium in only his second start for Chip Ganassi Racing after replacing Nicolas Minassian at the previous race in Portland. Herta gave Forsythe Racing its first podium of the season after a dismal start to 2001. The race was a battle of multiple strategies after a rained-out qualifying session the day before produced an unusual starting grid; fuel mileage, the number of pit stops, and a chaotic first-lap incident ultimately determined the final outcome of the race. == Report ==  Background  Just a week prior, Max Papis had won his second career race in rain-soaked Portland for Team Rahal while his teammate Kenny Br√§ck was still in control of the drivers' championship. The team was on a hot streak, winning three of the last four events, and the next race was in team owner Bobby Rahal's home state of Ohio. Much to the concern of race engineers, the weather forecast going into the weekend at Cleveland also seemed to predict rain on raceday, which would affect handling and grip on an already bumpy track surface. Nevertheless, the teams and drivers were looking forward to the annual race at Cleveland, which was popular with the fans and unique on the calendar for its speed and unusual amount of room to pass other cars. In the lead-up to the race weekend, it was announced that CART would not return to race at Michigan International Speedway for the 2002 season; the speedway had hosted the series every year since 1970 and it would never host CART again. Rival series Indy Racing League would pick up where CART left off and run its own race at the speedway from 2002 to 2007. Michigan would join Texas, Nazareth, Detroit, Lausitz, and Houston as race events that would not appear on the 2002 CART calendar.  Practice and Qualifying  The sun shined on Friday morning practice as drivers took to the track for the first time. Several drivers had difficulties coming to grips with the track surface; in the morning session alone, Alex Zanardi, Shinji Nakano, Roberto Moreno, and Alex Tagliani would all make contact with the barriers in different corners. At the end of the 1 hour, 45 minute session, Cristiano da Matta led the rest of the field as the only car to break into the 58-second range with a 58.905. By the time the second Friday practice began, clouds had rolled in and covered the area in overcast conditions. Once again da Matta topped the session with a 57.905, and the top twelve cars were all separated by less than a second. The weather going into Saturday was foreboding, as forecasts called for thunderstorms later in the afternoon during qualifying. For Saturday morning practice, however, the rains stayed away. Only Bryan Herta could beat da Matta's previous best lap, clocking in a 57.902. da Matta, meanwhile, could only muster 4th place in the practice session. The dark clouds looming over the track on Saturday afternoon threatened to pour rain at any time during qualifying. The rules governing qualifying, which meant that the field would be split into two groups and run one after the other, meant that one group could be at a huge disadvantage if the rain started to fall. At 1:45 PM, the first group, containing the bottom thirteen drivers in the points standings, went out on tracking for qualifying. The rain stayed away for the thirty-minute session, and the dry track allowed Maur√≠cio Gugelmin to top the time sheets with a 57.356 on his final lap. He was followed by Adri√°n Fern√°ndez and rookie Max Wilson. With the second group about to qualify at 2:30 PM, the long-awaited rain finally began to lightly drizzle on the track. Drivers continued on without rain tires, and Br√§ck, Scott Dixon, and Paul Tracy would each spin on the slippery track just minutes after the beginning of the session. The light rain meant that the track would quickly dry up, and the lap times subsequently began to rise with each passing minute. However, at 2:47 PM, CART suspended the qualifying session when lightning was spotted close to the track, bringing with it high winds and more spots of rain. According to CART rules, both qualifying groups were guaranteed at least twenty minutes of green-flag running, and so when the session resumed the drivers would be given five-and-a-half minutes to finish qualifying. At the time the session was stopped, Dario Franchitti was leading the group with a 59.803, which put him 14th behind all of the other first group runners. When the green flag finally came back out almost thirty minutes later, the track had multiple areas of standing water, meaning that none of the drivers in the second group would be able to put in a better time, much less compete with the drivers in the first group. The bizarre events in qualifying had allowed Gugelmin to take his first pole position since the 1997 Marlboro 500 and the fourth of his career. In post-qualifying comments, Gugelmin remarked that his lap time would have held up even if the second group hadn't experienced rain, but he also lamented that the current system of two-session qualifying was prone to scenarios like what happened earlier in the day. 2nd place Fern√°ndez and 3rd place Wilson, however, acknowledged that luck had finally been in their respective favors: Last-place Tracy put it best:  Race  Morning warmup saw similar overcast conditions like the day before, threatening to rain on the track with storms expected by the time race began in the afternoon. H√©lio Castroneves led the pack in the session with a 59.907. As race time approached, the storm system that brought about a tornado watch 50 miles west of Cleveland and had been forecast to the hit the track had moved southward, although the skies were still overcast and winds of 25 mph continued to blow across the circuit. A little after 1:00 PM, the race began with Gugelmin leading the field the field into the hazardous Turn 1. Gugelmin locked up the brakes and went wide at the corner as the cars bunched up behind him, allowing Wilson to take the lead. History repeated itself as multiple incidents forced several cars off the track and onto the grass. Patrick Carpentier and Michel Jourdain Jr., starting in the midfield, both spun after being hit by Tony Kanaan and defending race winner Moreno. Only Jourdain was able to be restarted, but he limped back to the pits and officially retired the car. The caution flag came out as a result of the first-turn accident as rookie Wilson led his first-ever laps in CART, followed by Tagliani and Memo Gidley; the first row of Gugelmin and Fern√°ndez had fallen back to 5th and 4th, respectively. Br√§ck had made an astounding leap from 17th to 6th in just a few corners, hugging the inside of the first corner to avoid the fracas and accelerating past several more cars before the caution came out. Multiple cars near the back of the field used the caution period to top off on fuel, hoping to move up the field through alternate strategies. On Lap 4 the green flag waved as Wilson led the field single-file into Turn 1. Br√§ck had managed to get past Gugelmin for 5th place, and began to work on Fern√°ndez. Herta, who had fallen from 4th to 10th after the first corner incident, was also beginning to make his way back up the order. On Lap 7, Tracy pulled into the pits and retired with an engine problem. The top five drivers were running within two seconds and beginning to pull away from 6th place Zanardi, who was bottling up the field behind him. On Lap 13, Gidley was able to pass Tagliani for 2nd place; two laps later, Fern√°ndez and Br√§ck were also able to get around him for 3rd and 4th place. Tagliani began to fall back from the top four drivers as the pace quickened. Gidley continued to stalk Wilson for several laps, making unsuccessful moves for the lead going into Turn 1. Finally, on Lap 21, Gidley was able to pass for the lead going through Turn 4 and take off into the distance. With little on-track action occurring in the meantime, on Lap 31 the leaders began to make their first pit stops. Gidley handed the lead back to Wilson, who continued on-track for a few more laps. Fern√°ndez and Br√§ck followed in behind. Both cars exited the pits side by side and continued to battle for position for several corners before Br√§ck could finally get by. As the rest of the field came into the pits, Bruno Junqueira ran into the back of Christian Fittipaldi, damaging the front suspension and breaking the front left tire off. Fittipaldi continued on, but Junqueira's car came to a stop at the entrance to the pitlane. This was the second race in a row where Junqueira was forced to retire as a result of a collision in the pitlane. The position of his car meant that Wilson, who was about to enter the pits himself, would be unable to pull into his pit box for service. Unaware of the situation, he pulled into pitlane and was forced to drive through without being serviced, losing valuable time and forcing him to come back on the next lap. Several cars, including Moreno, Jimmy Vasser, Kanaan, and Papis, stayed out a lap longer than the rest of the field before finally pitting and handing the lead back to Gidley. In the round of pitstops, Franchitti was able to gain positions, putting him 5th behind Zanardi and ahead of Herta. By Lap 41, Gidley was beginning to lap the rest of the field. At the same time, Nakano's turbocharger let go on-course, forcing him to limp to the pits and retire the car. Little changed throughout the field as Gidley continued to extend his lead over 2nd-place Br√§ck. By Lap 53, Zanardi was able to get around Fern√°ndez for 3rd place. On Lap 59, Zanardi initiated the second round of pitstops, giving up his position while the rest of the field went around. He exited just ahead of Wilson, running 18th, who was ahead of GIdley trying not to go a lap down. Wilson, trying to get around Zanardi going into Turn 6, clipped his wing on Zanardi's left rear tire, forcing him to make a lengthy pitstop to change the wing. Zanardi was forced to hit pitlane as well due to a flat tire, doing so at the same time GIdley gave up the lead to Br√§ck to make his second stop on Lap 62. Br√§ck led the field for a lap before entering the pits; new leader Fern√°ndez stayed out one lap longer before doing the same and handing the lead to Franchitti. The fuel strategy game was finally coming to fruition: cars that were able to save fuel and stay out longer than the leaders, in this case Franchitti, Herta, Moreno, Dixon, and Vasser, could potentially make it to the finish on only two pit stops. Meanwhile, drivers like Gidley and Gil de Ferran, who came in for their second stops a few laps earlier, were committed to a three-stop strategy. Those drivers could run all-out knowing that they had to make a splash-and-go at the end of the race; the two-stoppers would have to depend on saving fuel and hope for caution laps to make it to the end. Franchitti and Herta made their second and last stops of the race on Lap 66, along with a large portion of the field. Vasser was able to stay out until Lap 69 before pitting; Moreno until Lap 70. With the second pitstops finished, Gidley was back in the lead with de Ferran 2nd, Franchitti 3rd, Herta 4th, and Br√§ck 5th. On Lap 74, Dixon made contact with Tora Takagi going into Turn 6, sending both cars off-track and damaging Dixon's front suspension. He was able to get back to the pits, but by the time the car was able to get back on track he was five laps down. On Lap 80, de Ferran came in for his final stop. Unfortunately, a problem with the fueling mechanism meant that it took fourteen seconds to fill the car with fuel instead of the expected four, dropping him back to 7th place. In the meantime, leader Gidley began to extend his lead over Franchitti with each passing lap, hoping to put enough of a gap between them so that he could potentially come back in 1st place after his final stop. On Lap 86 Fern√°ndez came into the pits from 8th place and retired the car due to an engine problem. At the same time, Moreno had gotten around Br√§ck and was beginning to pressure Herta for 3rd place. On Lap 89, Moreno got tangled up with Herta in Turn 8, sending both gently in the tire barriers. Herta, who was spun around, was able to keep going and only lost one position to Br√§ck; Moreno stalled the car and had to wait to be restarted before continuing, falling back to 12th. On the next lap Gidley finally entered the pits for a splash-and-go, but the gap was not wide enough to remain in first place; he relinquished the lead to Franchitti and came out of the pits just ahead of Br√§ck. However, because he did not have worry about saving fuel, he could run at a faster pace and catch up to Franchitti. On Lap 94 Br√§ck was forced to pit for fuel, giving up 3rd place to Herta and falling back to 5th. Gidley was closing in fast on Franchitti as the laps wound down. By Lap 97 the only car between them was the lapped car of Michael Andretti, but as Gidley looked to overtake Andretti going into Turn 1 he locked up the brakes, losing valuable time. He finally got around Andretti on the next lap, but now Franchitti had lapped Wilson and put four seconds between them. On the last lap of the race, Franchitti was forced to slow down even more; halfway through the lap Gidley was able to get around Wilson and close the gap to first place. It was too little, too late, however, as Franchitti came out of the Turn 9-10 chicane onto the front straightaway and take the checkered flag by just three tenths of a second. Franchitti then ran out of fuel entering Turn 1.  Post-race  Franchitti was able to coax the car into victory lane for his seventh career CART win. His last win was at Surfer's Paradise in 1999. It would be his only win of 2001, but he would record two more podiums before the season ended. It was also Team Green's first win of the season. The win vaulted Franchitti into third place in the points standings, while de Ferran's 4th-place finish moved him up three places into 4th overall. Gidley's 2nd place in only his second start in the car would be his first of three podiums during the season and of his open-wheel racing career, as well as the first podium for Chip Ganassi Racing in the 2001 season. Meanwhile, Herta's 3rd place was a high point in an otherwise mediocre season driving for Forsythe Racing, scoring the team's first podium of the season and kicking off a streak of good results for the team that saw one win and multiple podiums. For Herta, however, his only other points-scoring finish for the rest of the year would be a 5th place at Michigan. ==Qualifying== {  style=\\"font- size:95%;\\" - !colspan=6June 30, 2001 - Qualifying Speeds - !

A toxic unit for a given compound is based on the concentration at which there is a 50% effect (ex. EC50) for a certain biological endpoint. One toxic unit is equal to the EC50 for a given endpoint for a specific biological effect over a given amount of time. Toxic units allow for the comparison of the individual toxicities of a binary mixture to the combined toxicity. This allows researchers to categorize mixtures as additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Synergism and antagonism are defined by mixtures that are more or less toxic than predicted by the sum of their toxic units. Contaminants are frequently present as mixtures in the environment. Regulatory decisions are based on mixture toxicity models that assume additivity, which can result in under or overestimation of toxic effects. Refining our understanding of mixture interactions can lead to better informed environmental management and decision making. In addition, exploring mixture interactions can elucidate the mechanisms of action for specific toxicants which, in many cases, are poorly understood. == Methods == Application of toxic units requires toxicity data for the individual components of the mixture as well as specialized mixture toxicity data. Evaluating the response of each individual chemical allows researchers to generate a new dosing metric, toxic units, which is standardized to the toxicity of each chemical. Since the toxicity of two compounds may vary widely, 1 toxic unit of two different compounds could correspond to two very different concentrations on a per mass basis. In addition to the toxicity of the individual components, use of toxic units requires a 2x2 factorial design concentration series where the response is measured to an increase of each contaminant with the other contaminant held constant. This elaborate concentration series allows researchers to describe how the mixture components interact with each other and predict effects at untested combinations components with nonlinear regression models.  Point estimates  Example of concentration-response model used to calculate EC50. Toxciant concentration is on the X-axis and biological response is on the Y-axis. Point estimation is a technique to predict population parameters based on available sample data and can be used to relate the mass based concentration to a toxicity based metric. Point estimates in toxicology are frequently response endpoints on a dose response curve. These point estimates predict at what concentration one would expect to see a given biological endpoint like 50% mortality (LC50). Any toxicological endpoint (growth inhibition, reproduction, behavior etc.) can be used as the toxicity metric to convert from mass based concentration to toxic units. Point estimates are generated by fitting a nonlinear regression model to toxicity data and using that model to predict the concentration of chemical required to elicit a known response of the biological endpoint.  Equation and calculations  One Toxic unit can be defined by the researcher as the concentration of a given chemical required to cause a given toxicological endpoint (LC50, EC50, IC50). ex. 1TU=LC50 or 1TU=IC50 for inhibition of growth Since the mass or molar based concentrations of different chemicals required to cause a given endpoint like an LC50 may vary widely, the concentration that corresponds to 1TU is specific to each individual chemical tested.  Isobolograms  Isobolograms are one way to present the results of binary mixture toxicity testing based in toxic units.Warne MSJ. 2003. A Review of the Ecotoxicity of Mixtures, Approaches to and Recommendations for, their Management. Proceedings of the Fifth National Workshop on the Assessment of Site Contamination. EPHC. pp.256 The strength of this method is its simplicity and ease of use. First a line of additivity is plotted that corresponds to all the combinations of the two chemicals that would result in one toxic unit. Next the experimental results from binary mixture tests are plotted on the isobologram. The results from the mixture test are point estimates from the mixture dose response curves that correspond to the single chemical tests. When these mixture point estimates are plotted on the isobologram, the region that they fall into (based on the concentrations of the two chemicals required to cause that given endpoint) demonstrates whether the mixture interactions are additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Response surfaces Three dimensional graph depicting the function F(x,y) where x and y could be the concentration of the individual components in toxic units and the height of the graph depicts the toxicological response.Response surfaces are a more advanced and complex way to visualize the same information presented in an isobologram. A response surface is a three dimensional graph with concentrations of individual components in toxic units on the x and y axis and the response variable on the z axis. This three dimensional representation of the organisms response to the two chemical stressors can be used to predict the toxicity of any combination of the components based on the nonlinear regression models that form the response surface.  Antagonistic, additive, and synergistic effects  The primary utility of toxic units is to classify mixture interactions as additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Additivity means that the toxicity of the mixture is equal to the sum of the toxicities of the individual components. Additivity is the default assumption of models used to predict toxicity of mixtures for regulatory and environmental management purposes. Synergistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of the mixture is greater than the sum of the individual toxicities. Conversely, antagonistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of a mixture is less than would be predicted by additivity. Understanding mixture interactions can prevent over or underestimation of toxicity by regulators who assume additivity for uncategorized mixtures. == Applications ==  Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks  The U.S. EPA uses toxic units as a benchmark, called the equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmark (ESB), for predicting the toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated sediments to benthic invertebrates.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2003. Procedures for the derivation of ESBs for the protection of benthic organisms: PAH mixtures. EPA/600/R-02/013. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC. Toxic units are calculated from sediment concentrations of 34 PAHs and their expected sediment, water, and lipid partitioning behavior. Based on the equilibrium partitioning approach (which accounts for the varying biological availability of chemicals in different sediments), the ESB for total PAH is the sum of the quotients of a minimum of each of the 34 individual PAHs in a specific sediment, divided by the final chronic value concentration for each specific PAH in sediment. According to the U.S. EPA, freshwater or saltwater sediments that contain less or equal to 1.0 toxic units of the mixture of the 34 PAHs or more PAHs are acceptable for the protection of benthic organisms. Sediments that are greater than 1.0 toxic units are not protective and potentially have adverse effects to benthic organisms. U.S. EPA ESBs do not consider antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects of other sediment contaminants and have been criticized as an overly conservative estimate for pyrogenic PAHs (such as those from manufactured gas plant processes).Hawthorne SB, DJ Miller, and JP Kreitinger. 2006. Measurement of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments and toxic units used for estimating risk to benthic invertebrates at manufactured gas plant sites. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 25(1):287-296 This is in part due to the analytical approaches for determining the toxic units for both pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs.  Toxicity identification evaluation  The toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) is an approach to systematically characterize, identify, and confirm toxic substances in whole sediments and sediment interstitial waters.Burgess RM and KT Ho. Sediment Toxicity Identification Evaluation. Chapter S, Ferard and Blaise (ed.), Encyclopedia of Aquatic Ecotoxicology. Springer, New York, NY, 8/13/2013:online, (2013). This approach is typically carried out by the U.S. EPA. The effluent effect concentration data and the measured toxicant concentration data are transformed to toxic units for the regression analysis to evaluate whether a linear relationship exists between two or more toxicants.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 1993. Methods for Aquatic Toxicity Identification Evaluations: Phase III Toxicity Confirmation Procedures for Samples Exhibiting Acute and Chronic Toxicity. EPA/600/R-92/081. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC. == Limitations == The limitations associated with using Toxic Units are largely dependent on the methodology in which they are being used. For example, the use of isobolograms is applicable to only binary mixtures. In general, Toxic Units are based on point estimates which are limited by projection. Point estimates, and therefore Toxic Units, are a simplification of a dose-response model. Information about toxic effects at concentrations other than the point estimate are lost in translation.  Alternative ways to study mixtures   Top-down Approach  A common method for studying mixtures is to measure the total toxicity of the mixture and consider the internal toxicant interactions as irrelevant. Any mixture effects are taken into account in the total toxicity. The results for this method are limited by being mixture specific and has limited value in determining specific mechanisms of toxicity.  GLM Approach  Using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) allows for complex, non-parametric model fitting to describe the toxicity complex mixtures. Generalized Linear Models are more likely to find significant differences from additivity than TU approaches. The GLM approach also allows for the alteration of models to reflect current knowledge of biological mechanisms == References == Category:Toxicology Category:Units of measurement ","title":"Toxic unit"},{"id":"54201585","text":"Adulrach Namkul (; born 2 November 1997) is a Thai badminton player.

Joyce Laing (later Joyce Salt) was born in Stockton, Durham, England in 1910. After completing high school, Laing won an essay prize and travelled to Canada in 1930, visiting the then Duke of Windsor's (Edward VIII) ranch in Alberta. == Early life == Laing enrolled in Newnham College, at the University of Cambridge in 1930, taking her B.A. and M.A. She was a Fellow of Newnham College from 1933 to 1937 and a Balfour Student. Women who were at Newnham College with her included Edith Whetham, Elizabeth Caldwell, Dorothy Hill and Jean Mitchell. Laing earned her PhD from Cambridge in 1937 with a thesis on Host-finding by insect parasites, and won a Stoney Scholarship of the British Federation of University Women, to study in Australia or New Zealand. Laing undertook her postdoctoral research at the University of Queensland in Australia, studying the biology of parasites and fruit flies for almost a year. Laing had studied at Newnham College alongside Australian geologist Dorothy Hill, and both women took their PhD at Cambridge. Laing would continue her professional relationship with Hill, in the UQ Science Students Association, which took students on fieldwork trips, most notably around Moreton Bay. Laing returned to England in 1938, and married one of her former Cambridge advisors, entomologist and academic, George Salt (1903‚Äì2003) in 1939. They had two sons, Michael and Peter. Joyce Salt was active in the Newnham College alumni community. Joyce and George remained at Cambridge for the rest of their lives, except for brief periods in Africa and Pakistan. Joyce Salt died on 25 May 2002. She was survived by her husband and sons. == Published works == Salt, G. and Laing, J. (1935). Discriminative Ability of a Parasitoid. Nature, 135 (3419): 792.

Efficiency can be reported then as a ratio of outputs to inputs or a comparison to optimal productivity using stochastic frontier analysis or data envelopment analysis. One difficulty in creating a generalized efficiency measure is comparability of outputs. For example, if hospital A discharges 100 people at an average cost of $8000, while hospital B discharges 100 at $7000, the presumption may be that B is more efficient, but hospital B may be discharging patients with poorer health that will require readmission and net higher costs to treat. ==Outputs== Commercial efficiency measure outputs can be put into two broad categories: episodes of care, or population based care. ==References== Category:Health care management ","title":"Health care efficiency measures"},{"id":"54201664","text":"Cost of Living is the second studio album by American band Downtown Boys.

They are often life-sized, detailed, and solid, and are projected into the external world. They typically appear anchored in external space, just beyond the reach of individuals, or further away. They can have three- dimensional shapes, with depth and shadows, and distinct edges. They can be colorful or in black and white and can be static or have movement.  Simple vs. complex  Visual hallucinations may be simple, or non-formed visual hallucinations, or complex, or formed visual hallucinations. Simple visual hallucinations are also referred to as non-formed or elementary visual hallucinations. They can take the form of multicolored lights, colors, geometric shapes, indiscrete objects. Simple visual hallucinations without structure are known as phosphenes and those with geometric structure are known as photopsias. These hallucinations are caused by irritation to the primary visual cortex (Brodmann's area 17). Complex visual hallucinations are also referred to as formed visual hallucinations. They tend to be clear, lifelike images or scenes, such as faces of animals or people. Sometimes, hallucinations are 'Lilliputian', i.e., patients experience visual hallucinations where there are miniature people, often undertaking unusual actions. Lilliputian hallucinations may be accompanied by wonder, rather than terror.  Content  The frequency of hallucinations varies widely from rare to frequent, as does duration (seconds to minutes). The content of hallucinations varies as well. Complex (formed) visual hallucinations are more common than Simple (non-formed) visual hallucinations. In contrast to hallucinations experienced in organic conditions, hallucinations experienced as symptoms of psychoses tend to be more frightening. An example of this would be hallucinations that have imagery of bugs, dogs, snakes, distorted faces. Visual hallucinations may also be present in those with Parkinson's, where visions of dead individuals can be present. In psychoses, this is relatively rare, although visions of God, angels, the devil, saints, and fairies are common. Individuals often report being surprised when hallucinations occur and are generally helpless to change or stop them. In general, individuals believe that visions are experienced only by themselves. == Causes == Two neurotransmitters are particularly important in visual hallucinations ‚Äì serotonin and acetylcholine. They are concentrated in the visual thalamic nuclei and visual cortex. The similarity of visual hallucinations that stem from diverse conditions suggest a common pathway for visual hallucinations. Three pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to explain this. The first mechanism has to do with cortical centers responsible for visual processing. Irritation of visual association cortices (Brodmann's areas 18 and 19) cause complex visual hallucinations. The second mechanism is deafferentation, the interruption or destruction of the afferent connections of nerve cells, of the visual system, caused by lesions, leading to the removal of normal inhibitory processes on cortical input to visual association areas, leading to complex hallucinations as a release phenomenon. The third mechanism has to do with the reticular activating system, which plays a role in the maintenance of arousal. Lesions in the brain stem can cause visual hallucinations. Visual hallucinations are frequent in those with certain sleep disorders, occurring more often when drowsy. This suggests that the reticular activating system plays a part in visual hallucinations, although the precise mechanism has still not fully been established. == Prevalence == Hallucinations in those with psychoses are often experienced in color, and most often are multi-modal, consisting of visual and auditory components. They frequently accompany paranoia or other thought disorders, and tend to occur during the daytime and are associated with episodes of excess excitability. The DSM-V lists visual hallucinations as a primary diagnostic criterion for several psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The lifetime prevalence of all psychotic disorders is 3.48% and that of the different diagnostic groups are as follows: 0.87% for schizophrenia, 0.32% for schizoaffective disorder, 0.07% for schizophreniform disorder, 0.18% for delusional disorder, 0.24% for bipolar I disorder, 0.35% for major depressive disorder with psychotic features, 0.42% for substance-induced psychotic disorders, and 0.21% for psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. Visual hallucinations can occur as a symptom of the above psychotic disorders in 24% to 72% of patients at some point in the course of their illness. Not all individuals who experience hallucinations have a psychotic disorder. Many physical and psychiatric disorders can manifest with hallucinations, and some individuals may have more than one disorder that could cause different types of hallucinations. ==References== Category:Hallucinations Category:Medical signs Category:Psychosis Category:Symptoms and signs: Cognition, perception, emotional state and behaviour ","title":"Visual hallucinations in psychosis"},{"id":"54201765","text":"Tony Parun (born 24 August 1949) is a former professional tennis player from New Zealand. ==Playing career== His brother, Onny Parun, was also a professional tennis player and they both represented New Zealand in the Davis Cup during the 1970s.

McFarland & Company. Born in Edina, Missouri, Gloria McCloskey joined the All American League in its 1953 season. She was assigned as an outfielder for the Rockford Peaches club but did not have much of a chance to play during the season. Afterwards, Gloria moved to Columbia, Missouri and enrolled at Christian College, known now as Columbia College. While at college, she participated in tennis and field hockey as well as in the synchronised swimming squad and the equestrianism program. As a result, in 1955 she was voted Christian College's Athletic Queen. At that time the college did not have a softball team. Therefore, she played for the Goetz Country Club, a fastpitch softball team based in St. Joseph, Missouri, that won the national championship in that year. Following her college graduation, she attended Northeast Missouri State University and earned a degree in physical education and theatrology. She then taught physical education and coached basketball and track and field across Missouri. By this time Gloria married to Kelly Rogers, a school district superintendent in Macon, Missouri. They had two children, a girl, Tracy, and a son, Trent. In her spare time, Gloria volunteered her assistance with the Macon High School softball team for several years. She also worked as the physical education teacher at Salisbury High School in Salisbury, Missouri, where her husband was Superintendentof Schools in the 1980s before their retirement.

Casa NouƒÉ (Romanian for The New House) was a villa in Bucharest, Romania, used as a Royal residence. It was situated at 24, Pictor Grigorescu Street, behind the Royal Palace, on the site where Sala Palatului Concert Hall now stands. During the reign of King Carol II of Romania, in 1930‚Äì1940, the villa hosted the Romanian Royal Family, namely the King and his son, Crown Prince Mihai, Grand Voivode of Alba Iulia (later HM King Michael I of Romania). The villa was the actual place where the Royal Family lived in Bucharest, since the Royal Palace itself mainly contains large, monumental halls, destined for official Royal duties. An alley separated the Palace from Casa NouƒÉ, requiring visitors to traverse it (outdoor) when walking from a building to the other. After King Carol's abdication and flee on September 5, 1940, Queen Mother Elena of Romania was quickly invited by the new Prime Minister (and future dictator), general Ion Antonescu, to return in the country (from Italy). Antonescu publicly expressed his thought that the new sovereign, young Mihai (then 19 yo), needed his mother's presence, as moral support for his new duties; the move was, indeed, highly appreciated by the King. After the Queen's arrival, the Royal Family sought to live elsewhere (as Casa NouƒÉ was unpleasantly connected to Carol II and his mistress Elena Lupescu). This, however, proved impossible, since the other Royal residence in Bucharest, Cotroceni Palace, was badly damaged by an earthquake on November 10, 1940. Thus, Casa NouƒÉ remained the main Royal residence in Bucharest until August 24, 1944. In 1940‚Äì1944 timeframe, Antonescu increasingly acted as a dictator, allowing the King to perform ceremonial roles only. Consequently, the Royal Family mainly lived at their private residence, Pele»ô Castle in Sinaia. They visited Bucharest (and thus lived in Casa NouƒÉ) only when summoned by Antonescu. Casa NouƒÉ was the actual scene of the King Michael's Coup in the afternoon of August 23, 1944. As described by many authors, it is in this house ‚Äì in King's office, situated at the left of the main entrance ‚Äì where the final discussion with Antonescu took place, followed by his refusal to switch sides and join the Allies and, subsequently, by his arrest. For a few hours, Antonescu and some fellow members of his Cabinet were imprisoned in a large Fichet room on Casa NouƒÉ's first floor. Casa NouƒÉ was completely destroyed the following day, during the (targeted) retaliation bombardment performed by the German Luftwaffe, that seriously affected the Royal Palace as well. After August 24, 1944, with the Royal Palace made uninhabitable by the German bombardment and Cotroceni Palace still not recovered, the Romanian Royal Family missed again a functional Bucharest residence. HM King Michael asked his aunt, Princess Elisabeta of Romania, former Queen Consort of Greece, to allow the court to use her villa in HerƒÉstrƒÉu Park. Nowadays, this villa is called Elisabeta Palace, despite the fact it was never intended for official activities. Thus, Elisabeta Palace saw the dramatic events after 1944, that culminated in the King's abdication in 1947, as well as the Family's definitive return in Romania in 1997. With both the Royal Palace and Cotroceni hosting museums, Elisabeta Palace is still used today as the only Royal residence in Bucharest. Here, the Romanian Royal Family lives and perform public duties.http://www.familiaregala.ro/resedinte/palatul- elisabetahttp://www.romaniaregala.ro/ ==Bibliography== * Ivor Porter ‚Äì Michael of Romania.

Students are from 3 to 19 with moderate learning difficulties. Many are on the autistic spectrum and may have speech and language problems. Ofsted rated the school as outstanding in all categories, saying \\"Teaching is outstanding because teachers have exceptionally high expectations of what pupils can achieve and use practical activities to make learning interesting.\\" ==School History== Treetops School started in 1960 at its old location in Dell Road, Grays. The school was called 'the Elms', and was originally a mansion. Next to it was The Dell, one of the earliest houses in Britain to be built with concrete. The Dell was owned by Alfred Russel Wallace, a Welsh explorer, naturalist, anthropologist, geographer, and biologist. Head of a building firm, Mr Walsham, built a home on part of the land and the original building was taken over by Essex Education Committee and housed 60 children. Mr Walsham named his house \\"The Elms,\\" and so the Minister of Education allowed for the name of the school to be changed to ‚ÄúTreetops‚Äù in 1960. The school allowed 75 pupils, and most of the children were conveyed there by coach as very few lived within walking distance. There was also a caretaker who lived in a flat in the building. A separate building from the house was changed to allow for one large room or hall, suitable for P.E. or games. It was known as the Recreation Room. A new school had been promised within 1.5 years of the opening of Treetops. However, this didn't take place until 6.5 years. The new school was built in 2 main sections- the first section was behind the old building, where the school carried on functioning. Then, classes were transferred to the new section, and the old building was knocked down. By July 1968 the second section was completed. Treetops moved to its new site in Buxton Road in February 2008, after the school expressed interest for a better environment for autistic pupils and those with ADHD and speech, language, and communication difficulties. {  - !

He was a Postdoctoral Fellow in 2009 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 2010 to 2015 he was a Research Fellow I Junior Scientist at the Center of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, in Bethesda, Maryland. From 2015 to 2017 he was a Scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute/ Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, in New York City, New York. In 2017, he became the full-time faculty (Instructor) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, New York. Jaiswal studies the critical role of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), typical for familial ALS, in the impairment of [Ca2+]mito handling and perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis in SOD1G93A mice and cell culture models of ALS. These finding, reported in Pharmacology and Neuroscience Journal. Jaiswal has also studied molecular mechanisms of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) using 2-photon in-vivo imaging and 3-D microscopy at CNRM/NIH-DoD center. He developed a minimally invasive in-vivo 2-photon imaging method and established SCALEA2/CLARITY tissue clearing techniques for intact volumetric 3-D imaging of optically cleared transparent mouse and human brains. As a Research Scientist in the Department of Psychiatry at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, he focused on studying adult neurogenesis in the brains of patients with major depression and other psychiatric disorders. His lab work is conducted on mice, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and Human postmortem tissue. Jaiswal also has an avid interest in science communications as well as science and society. Jaiswal's recent projects included studies related to neurodegenration in ALS Brain Injury Epigenetics and psychiatric disorders. Hyperexcitability is considered to be a hallmark of ALS, and it has been suggested that the ALS- associated hyperexcitability may stem from altered function of the neuronal glutamate receptors due to inefficient RNA editing of one of the receptor's subunits.

He was described by the Columbia Journalism Review as being of a new generation of political journalists, focusing on data-driven journalism instead of reporting from the campaign trail. ==Early life and education== Enten was raised in a Jewish family in the Riverdale neighborhood of The Bronx, New York City. Harry was introduced to politics as a child when his father, a judge, took him into the polling booth to help pull the levers for elections. He attended Riverdale Country School. He is the nephew, by marriage, of singer-songwriter Neil Sedaka. Enten graduated magna cum laude, and Phi Beta Kappa from Dartmouth College in 2011. Enten chose to attend Dartmouth at least partially due to New Hampshire's status as the first-in- the-nation primary. Enten began publishing a blog called Margin of Error, and held an internship at NBC News Political Unit in Washington, D.C. Prior to working for FiveThirtyEight, Enten was a journalist for The Guardian. ==FiveThirtyEight== Along with Carl Bialik and Walter Hickey, Enten was one of the first people Nate Silver hired when FiveThirtyEight relaunched under ESPN. He mostly wrote politics articles for FiveThirtyEight, but he occasionally wrote weather pieces. He announced on February 5, 2018 that he was leaving FiveThirtyEight to join CNN's Politics team as a senior political writer and analyst. Enten was also one of the co-hosts of the FiveThirtyEight politics podcast, alongside host Jody Avirgan and fellow co-hosts Nate Silver and Clare Malone. ==The Forecast Fest== From April 2019 to March 2020 Kate Bolduan, John Avlon and Harry Enten produced a podcast called The Forecast Fest together. It was about the 2020 United States presidential election. ==ReferencesExternal links== *CNN Profiles: Harry Enten *The Forecast Fest on stitcher Category:1988 births Category:21st-century American journalists Category:21st- century American non-fiction writers Category:American bloggers Category:American male bloggers Category:American male journalists Category:American men podcasters Category:American podcasters Category:American political writers Category:American statisticians Category:CNN people Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Jewish American journalists Category:Journalists from New York City Category:Living people Category:Mathematicians from New York (state) Category:Online journalists Category:People from Riverdale, Bronx Category:The Guardian journalists Category:Writers from the Bronx Category:Riverdale Country School alumni ","title":"Harry Enten"},{"id":"54202073","text":"St. John's Episcopal Church in Christiansted, Virgin Islands was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

It was released in the U.S. on July 11, 2006. This movie is an example of the parity between the big budget American films, and the lower budget B level movies that tend to emerge from Canadian production. Canadian cinema had been largely pushed to the back when it came to attention in the movie market as George Melnyk spoke about in his article \\"Reflections on Canadian Cinema\\": \\"Screen time for Canadian films in Canada varies from a low of one per cent in English Canada to a high of ten per cent in Quebec. During the 1990s the combined figure was about three per cent for the whole country.\\" This made it tough for films like Crash Landing to make any impact and they tend to go straight to DVD. ==Plot== After crash landing his previous military flight and barely escaping with his life, Major John Masters (Antonio Sab√†to Jr.) is given a seemingly easy mission to ease him back into flying. He is tasked with flying a billionaires daughter and her friends on a private plane to her graduation party. Meanwhile several of the guests are assassinated by unknown terrorists. Unknown to Masters, the flight crew have all been murdered and replaced with members of a terrorist group intent on hijacking the flight and holding the daughter for ransom. When the hijackers take the plan, Masters springs into action and a struggle ensues. The result of the struggle leaves several passengers and terrorists dead and a pilot wounded. Now Masters' only option is to try and land the plane on a small island in the middle of a category 5 hurricane. ==Cast Critical reception == Crash Landing holds a score of 2 out of 5 stars on IMDB, 1 Rotten review on Rotten Tomatoes, and 1.5 stars out of 5 on Rate Your Music. Critics pointed out the film's obvious shortcomings (an army general on an air force base, a general's hair that is too long for army regulations, low budget, bad continuity, and the inaccuracy of the aircraft - especially the cockpit). At least one critic also noted that the limousine crash scene is recycled from a Matlock episode. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:2005 films Category:2005 action films Category:Films directed by Jim Wynorski Category:American action films Category:American films Category:Canadian action films Category:Canadian films Category:CineTel Films films Category:Films about aircraft hijackings ","title":"Crash Landing (2005 film)"},{"id":"54202109","text":"Margaret Hamilton, the 1986 winner of the Ada Lovelace Award.

His project While I'm Here, a collection of individual global stories following everyday heroes, has gone viral on several platforms and earned Foster wide recognition and success. ==Career== Foster, inspired by the documentary-style photos in his local newspaper, began his career as a photojournalist. He was interested in using photography as a tool for storytelling, and this passion led him to explore the world. His job allowed him to experience more than 45 countries, working for editorial clients such as The New York Times, TIME Magazine, and Canadian Geographic. While working as a photojournalist for the LA Times, Foster learned how to create authentic content and help subjects to quickly become comfortable in front of the camera. Additionally, the editorial world allowed Foster to recognize the significance of telling stories through cinematic work‚Äîthis led him to a career shift into filmmaking. Foster has since acted as Director on projects for global brands such as Nike, Huawei, DJI, and Gatorade to help them create authentic pieces of content that resonate with viewers. He is represented by Scouts Honour. In 2009, Foster worked with the New York Times to film an interview with the Dalai Lama. In the piece, Times reporter Edward Wong and the Dalai Lama discuss the survival of Tibetan culture and relations with China. Foster created a short piece for DJI in 2016 called The Last Colonizer. The film focuses on Heraldo Riel, an older man who continues the family tradition of working as a gaucho in remote Patagonia even as the world changes rapidly around him. In 2018, Foster travelled to Kenya to tell the story of a group of elderly women fending off assaults in Korogocho, a slum located in Nairobi. The project ENOUGH, The Empowered Women of Korogocho was Staff Picked by Vimeo and shortlisted for the Young Director's Awards in Cannes, France. It was featured along with an interview with Foster in National Geographic. While I'm Here  The Legacy Project While I'm Here  The Legacy Project profiles everyday heroes passing on a legacy. Foster was inspired to create the videos after missing his chance to tell the story of a man from his hometown who dedicated his life to helping others. He wanted to share the stories of others who exemplified kindness and passed on important messages and traditions while those people were still living and continuing to do those incredible things. Foster filmed each story with a nimble crew. Their aim was to keep their subjects comfortable instead overwhelming them - since these people aren't generally in the spotlight, it is essential to establish a relationship before beginning to shoot. Subjects featured include a 30-year- old Navy veteran, the \\"San Diego Highwayman,\\" and an 83-year-old Mississippi bluesman. The project has picked up Vimeo Staff Picks and multiple awards along the way and has been featured in several viral Facebook posts. ==Recognition== Foster has received multiple awards for his works: *New Director of the Year, Silver, Shots Awards (2018) *Young Directors Awards, Shortlist, YDAs, Cannes, France (2018) *News Photographers Association of Canada, Team Multimedia (2nd place, 2017) *Winner of Best Documentary, Lucent Film Festival (2016) *Winner of Best Short Film, Lucent Film Festival (2016) *News Photographers Association of Canada, Team Multimedia for While I'm Here  The Legacy Project (1st place, 2016) *News Photographers Association of Canada Pictures of the Year, Team Multimedia (1st place, 2015) *Digital EMMY Award, Cannes France, Team Collaborator, HIGHRISE, National Film Board of Canada (2010) *Magnum Expression Award (Finalist, 2009) *News Photographers Association of Canada Pictures of the Year (3rd Place, 2009) *National Press Photographers Association Best of Photojournalism (2nd and 3rd place, 2009) *News Photographers Association of Canada, Photojournalist of the Year (Nominee, 2009) *Photographer of the Year, Loyalist College (2001 and 2002) Additionally, Foster's films have been featured in the following festivals: *National Geographic Short Film Showcase (2018) *Berlin Fashion Film Festival (2017) *Crossroads Film Festival (2016) *Telluride Film Festival (2016) *Forest City Film Fest (2016) *CIMM Music Fest Chicago (2015) *Lucent Film Fest (2015) *America's Finest Film Festival (2015) ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Personal Website * Scouts Honour Website Category:Canadian documentary film directors Category:Living people Category:1982 births Category:Film directors from Ontario ","title":"Brent Foster (director)"},{"id":"54202181","text":"Daniel B.

It was succeeded by Socket sTRX4 for the third generation of Ryzen Threadripper processors. Socket TR4 is AMD's second LGA socket for a consumer product after the short lived Socket 1207 FX. It is physically identical to, but electrically incompatible with both AMD's server Socket SP3, and Socket TR4's successor socket, Socket sTRX4. While Socket SP3 doesn't require a chipset, instead utilising a system-on-a-chip design, Socket TR4 and its successor require a chipset to provide improved functionality. For Socket TR4, the AMD X399 chipset was developed, which supports a total of 64 PCI Express lanes for quad SLI/CrossFire configurations. PCI express √ó16 slots are usually set up on most X399 motherboards like this: slot 1 ‚Äî √ó16, slot 2 ‚Äî √ó8, slot 3 ‚Äî √ó16, slot 4 ‚Äî √ó8).

During the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, after President Marc Ravalomanana stepped down, he became acting President of Madagascar for several hours on 17 March 2009, before transferring power to Andry Rajoelina. He went on to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs and one of three Vice Prime Ministers in the High Transitional Authority from 2010 to 2011. == Early life == Ramaroson was born on 28 September 1951 in Tananarive (Antananarivo), then the capital of French Madagascar. == Career == Ramaroson joined the Military of Madagascar, enlisting in the Aeronaval Force, which includes both Madagascar's navy and air force. He rose to the rank of vice admiral.  President of Madagascar  On 17 March 2009, after months of intense protests, President Marc Ravalomanana resigned. He left a signed note in which he assigned power to Ramaroson as president of the new \\"military directorate.\\" As a result, Ramaroson was President of Madagascar for a few hours on that day. The military leadership called Ravalomanana's action a \\"ploy\\" and supported opposition leader Andry Rajoelina. In a ceremony broadcast from a military camp in Antananarivo, Ramaroson and two generals announced that they were ending the military directorate and installing Rajoeline in power. He said in the video, \\"We have categorically rejected the [military] authority that Ravalomanana asked us to set up after his resignation.\\"  Later career  On 24 February 2010, Ramaroson was appointed Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs by President Rajoelina. He took possession of his offices the next morning, 25 February. He succeeded Ny Hasina Andriamanjato, who resigned earlier that month because he was \\"convince there would be no international recognition of Rajoelina unless he formed a unity government before elections. He became foreign minister at a time when foreign nations were concerned with the new administration's legitimacy and commitment to democracy, and the African Union's threat of sanctions should a power-sharing agreement not be in force by mid-March. Ramaroson told Reuters on the day of his appointment, \\"My principal mission is to explain to the international community what really happened in Madagascar. I will also talk to our ambassadors so they work for the country.\\" The Madagascar Tribune noted that Ramaroson caused some embarrassment for the president when he announced his appointment as deputy prime minister and foreign minister to the press before the High Transitional Authority had even done so. In addition, the Tribune speculated that Ramaroson's status as a vice admiral in the armed forces could be a source of embarrassment, given that he, as Deputy Prime Minister, outranked Prime Minister Albert Camille Vital, a colonel. At the United Nations General Assembly in 2010, Madagascar was the only country not to make an address. The reason cited were the events of the 2009 General Assembly, in which a majority of African countries voted to prevent President Rajoelina from speaking. Ramaroson explained to Reuters, \\"We didn't want a repeat of that... It's not worth squabbling in this General Assembly. That's why we decided not to speak... No one told us to pull out.\\" Ramaroson stepped down as Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in March 2011. == Personal life == Ramaroson is married to Joelle Jacky Rajao.

Traumatised further when her marriage breaks up after the accident, Leola falls under the care of Air Force surgeon James Stallings. Stallings fights the service's medical bureaucracy to repair Leola's face with several radical procedures over 20 reconstructive surgeries, while Leola befriends a disfigured boy hospitalised in the same facility. Stallings and Leola also fall in love by the time Dr. Stallings's work achieves the final results for her. The film is based on the real-life story of Leola Mae Harmon and James Stallings, who married in 1971. The marriage lasted five years; Leola remarried happily in 1982 and continued her nursing career. She died of multiple organ failure in 1998. Stallings became a noted plastic and voice surgeon who pioneered vocal reconstructive surgery.

Burnswark Hill, situated to the east the A74(M) between Eclefechan & Lockerbie, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, sits prominently in the landscape. Its rich history has been a consistent source of archaeological interpretation for generations. The most recent active archaeological research, undertaken by the Trimontium Trust has furthered the understanding of the site narrative in respect of the apparent relationship between the local population and occupying Roman forces. Burnswark Hill (also known as Birrenswark) represents succinct & prominent geological evidence of the interruption of sediment deposition by lava eruption followed by basalt flows. This geological activity from the Carboniferous period would ensure that some 300+ million years later, the location would provide an ideal site for the strategic positioning of an Iron Age hillfort, one that in this instance measures an enclosed area of approximately 7ha. The Iron Age hillfort, clearly observable in the landscape, is accompanied by evidence of an earlier Bronze Age burial cairn, Roman camps and potential fortlet, enclosures dated to the medieval period, a possible Civil War battery and an Ordnance Survey triangulation station. The site is commanding and impressive, its history complex and intriguing. == Context == The Siege of Burnswark Hill was a battle for control of a Caledonian hillfort fought between the defending Caledonian Selgovae tribe and Roman legions taking part in Quintus Lollius Urbicus' conquest of the Scottish Lowlands. The siege took place at present day Burnswark in southwestern Scotland near Lockerbie and resulted in a Roman victory. Little is known about the actual battle from historical texts save from its context which has been well documented. Much of what is known including troop positions and movements has been gleaned from archaeological work at the site of the battle.After the death of the Emperor Hadrian, Antoninus Pius rose to the throne and moved quickly to reverse the empire limit system put in place by his predecessor. Following his defeat of the Brigantes in 139 AD, Quintus Lollius Urbicus, the Roman Governor of Britannia,W. Eck, Die Statthalter der germanischen Provinzen vom 1.-3. Jahrhundert (Epigraphische Studien Band 14, Cologne/Bonn, 1985, p. 168.Historia Augusta, Antoninus Pius 5.4.Freeman, Charles (1999) Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Oxford University Press. p. 508. . was ordered by Antonius Pius to march north of Hadrian's Wall to conquer the Caledonian Lowlands which were settled by the Otadini, Selgovae, Damnonii and the Novantae, and to push the frontier further north. Lollius Urbicus moved three legions into position initially establishing his supply routes from Coria and Bremenium and moved three legions, the Legio II Augusta from Caerleon, the Legio VI Victrix from Eboracum, and the Legio XX Valeria Victrix from Deva Victrix into the theatre between 139 and 140 AD, and thereafter moved his army, a force of at least 16,500 men,Hanson, William S. \\"The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes\\", in Edwards, Kevin J. & Ralston, Ian B.M. (Eds) (2003) Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC ‚Äì AD 1000. Edinburgh. Edinburgh University Press. north of Hadrian's Wall. The Selgovae, having settled in the regions of present day Kirkcudbrightshire and Dumfriesshire immediately northwest of Hadrian's Wall, were amongst the first of the Caledonian tribes to face Lollius Urbicus' legions together with the Otadini. The Romans, who were well versed in warfare on hilly terrain since their founding, moved quickly to occupy strategic points and high ground, some of which had already been fortified by the Caledonians with hill forts. One such hill fort was located at present day Burnswark which was strategically located commanding the western route north further into Caledonia. ==Battle details== The Roman forces set up positions surrounding the hill fort and made two encampments on either side of the fort to effectively cut it off. It is believed that the two Roman camps housed around 6,000 soldiers composed of legions and auxiliary troops. Whereas the defenders would have been armed only with simple weapons, swords and shields, the Romans had complex siege weapons and made extensive use of slingers to deadly effect. It is believed that the defenders of the hill fort were almost entirely wiped out. ==Aftermath== This was likely one of many battles that took place during the Roman Campaign in the Caledonian Lowlands. By 142 AD, the Romans had pacified the entire area and had successfully moved the frontier north to the newly built Antonine Wall. ==See also== * Antoninus Pius * Quintus Lollius Urbicus * Selgovae * Hillforts in Scotland * List of hill forts in Scotland * Roman conquest of Britain * Scotland during the Roman Empire ==ReferencesFurther reading== *A.J.

The Luppino family is one of three centralized Mafia organizations in Hamilton, with the other two being the Musitano crime family and the Papalia crime family. The Luppinos have had strong connections with the Buffalo crime family of Buffalo, New York. By 2018, the Violis had an increased role in the organization, particularly Domenico and Giuseppe Violi, the sons of Montreal mob boss Paolo Violi who had married into the Luppino family through Giacomo's daughter. Domenico had reportedly been made the underboss of the Buffalo crime family and one of his duties was to \\"assume control over the operations of the Luppino-Violi crime family\\". By late 2018, however, both brothers were imprisoned for drug trafficking offenses. Brothers Natale and Rocco Luppino were believed to be the leaders of the Hamilton-based crime family. ==Luppino, Hamilton and Buffalo== Giacomo Luppino was born in 1900 in the village of Oppido Mamertina, Calabria, Italy. Already involved in organized crime in Calabria, Luppino, his wife Domenica (n√©e Todaro) and their 10 children immigrated to Hamilton, in 1955, from Castellace, a subdivision of Oppido Mamertina. By the time Luppino arrived in Canada, the \\"Three Dons\\" had already been established, consisting of Santo Scibetta, Anthony Sylvestro and Calogero Bordonaro, who answered to Stefano Magaddino of the Buffalo crime family.Schneider, 2009 p.285-286 Schneider, 2017 p.173-178 Before Scibetta moved to Hamilton, he was already a made member of the Magaddino family. By the early 1960s, Magaddino promoted Santo Scibetta to leader of the Buffalo family's Ontario branch replacing Johnny Papalia who was under indictments in the United States.Edwards, p.137 Throughout the 1950s and 60s, Luppino and Scibetta jointly controlled Hamilton. In the early 1960s, Luppino was the capodecina of the Hamilton faction of Magaddino's Buffalo crime family, giving Luppino control over all of his branches in Ontario. As boss of all bosses in the region, he was a founding member of the Camera di Controllo in Canada in 1962. Luppino had been seen meeting with powerful mob figures, including 'Ndrangheta member Rocco Zito and Siderno Group member Michele Racco. Luppino and Santo Scibetta also answered to Magaddino while Johnny Papalia was imprisoned in the early 1960s. The Luppinos also became associated with local bootlegger Paolo Violi, but left for Montreal in 1963 on Giacomo's orders to avoid clashes with Papalia. In Montreal, Violi developed connections with the Cotroni crime family, while maintaining ties with the Luppino family; he married Giacomo's daughter, Grazia in 1965.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, p. 259 Giacomo had five sons who were involved in organized crime: Vincenzo (Jimmy), Natale (Nat), Rocco, Antonio (Tony) and John Luppino. In 1967, police began a five-year surveillance operation of Giacomo Luppino, which included wiretapping his Hamilton home.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, p. 310 In the early 1970s, Natale Luppino, worked with Toronto mobster Paul Volpe on extortion schemes where they would be paid kickbacks from both the union and the developers for negotiating construction contracts.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, p. 319 Giacomo Luppino later sponsored Paul Volpe into the Buffalo crime family. In the mid-1970s, Scibetta died, shifting the leadership entirely to Luppino. In 1978, Rocco Luppino, Dominic Musitano, owner of a Hamilton haulage company, and Angelo Natale, president of the Ontario Haulers Association, were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion after police uncovered a protection racket on Ontario's independent trucking industry; after a five-year legal battle, they were acquitted in 1983. In 1981, Tony and John Luppino, and Gerry Fumo were convicted of fraud, receiving 15 month, 12 month and 18 month sentences respectively.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, p. 333 Giacomo Luppino died of natural causes at the age of 87 in March 1987, whereby Jimmy Luppino took over the family. Statements made during the 2018 trial of mobster Domenico Violi indicated that, several decades earlier, Giaccomo Luppino had been responsible for working out arrangements for the alliance between the Hamilton mob and \\"the Mafia of Buffalo\\". In a report on the murder of Cece Luppino in early 2019, CBC News made this statement: \\"Court documents filed by the RCMP [during the Violi trial] show the Luppino family is connected to a web of organized crime stretching from Hamilton to Buffalo, N.Y.\\" The news item added that the \\"Luppino-Violi family is a faction of the Todaro crime family\\" that is based in Buffalo and that Rocco and Natale Luppino were members of the latter. In a 1999 interview with Musitano family hitman Kenneth Murdock, he revealed he was ordered to kill Jimmy Luppino, but did not go through with the order. Murdock also claimed that he was waiting for Pat Musitano to approve the murders of Natale Luppino and Vincenzo Luppino, as well as Domenic Violi and Giuseppe Violi. ==The Violis and Luppinos== A 2002 Halton Police report suggested the Violi brothers, Domenico (Dom) and Giuseppe (Joe) Violi, grandsons to Giacomo Luppino, who moved back to Hamilton with their mother after their father Paolo Violi was killed in Montreal in 1978 by the Sicilian Rizzuto crime family, became affiliated with the Luppino family. Domenico was became a made member in the Buffalo family in January 2015. In November 2017, the brothers were charged with 75 offenses, such as conspiracy to import a controlled substance, possession for the purpose of trafficking a controlled substance, trafficking a controlled substance, trafficking contraband tobacco, trafficking firearms, and participating in a criminal organization. Nine people in total were arrested and charged, including Massimiliano Carfagna of Burlington, Ontario and Adriano Scolieri of Vaughan, Ontario, while warrants went out for additional suspects. During the multi-city bust, police seized large quantities of fentanyl and carfentanil, heroin, cocaine and over 250,000 tablets of controlled substances, some three million cigarettes and several gaming machines. During the same week in November, the FBI arrested several people in New York on related offences; the charges included narcotics trafficking, loansharking and firearms. In March 2018, Carfagna was sentenced to 10 and a half years in prison for drug trafficking and weapons offenses, and also stated between March and October 2016, he and Joe Violi agreed to import 200 to 300 kilograms of cocaine into Canada. On June 1, 2018, Joe Violi was sentenced to 16 years in prison after pleading guilty on drug trafficking charges. On December 3, 2018, Domenico Violi was sentenced to eight years in prison after pleading guilty to trafficking drugs to a paid undercover police agent for more than US$416,000, as part of a three-year RCMP-led police Project OTremens, during which the agent was officially inducted as a \\"made\\" member of the Bonanno crime family in Canada, according to an agreed statement of facts. Criminologist Anna Sergi of the University of Essex stated that \\"A new alliance between Bonanno associates and the Violi family ... is significant, as it suggests a growing prominence for Calabrian mafia ‚Äî the 'Ndrangheta ‚Äî within the New York families and in Canada\\". Domenico Violi admitted to trafficking approximately 260,000 pills, including PCP, ecstasy and methamphetamine to the undercover agent. Wiretaps recorded from 2015 to 2017 also indicated Domenico Violi was made the underboss of the Buffalo crime family by boss Joseph Todaro Jr. in October 2017 in a meeting in Florida; the first Canadian to hold the second-highest position in the American Mafia. After being promoted to underboss, Violi is heard on wiretaps boasting that \\"he had beaten out 30 other people for the position,\\" indicating the Buffalo family had at least 30 made men which included Canadian members such as the Violi brothers' uncles Natale and Rocco Luppino. The wiretaps also revealed the activity of The Commission (the governing body of the American Mafia) as Violi's promotion was so unusual that Joe Todaro Jr. consulted with The Commission for permission to promote Violi as the Buffalo family's new underboss. According to wiretaps from the Violi brothers case, Giuseppe Violi told the undercover agent back in February 2015 that Cece had been approached about becoming a made member, but Cece had told his father that he believed there was not enough money to be made and \\"that there are too many headaches\\". Court documents filed by the RCMP in spring 2019 confirmed a connection between the Luppino family and the mob in Buffalo. On 30 January 2019, Cece Luppino, son of Rocco Luppino, was shot and killed at a home that was owned by his father at 56 Mountain Brow Blvd in Hamilton. Hamilton Police Service called it a \\"targeted\\" hit and suggested that the murder might be related to organized crime. Cece Luppino had no criminal record, however. Detective Sergeant Peter Thom provided only this information to the news media: \\"I've been told he works for a family business down in Stoney Creek\\", apparently related to a cafe and real estate. A subsequent report in January 2020 by The Hamilton Spectator stated that the business was a \\"realty training centre with an attached caf√©\\". No charges had been laid as of that time but the news item added that the Cece Luppino murder might have been committed to \\"send a message to more powerful family members\\". The report also referenced a 2015 conversation that had been accessed by police; Cece was heard to say that he did not want to be a \\"made man\\" in the organized crime aspect of the family but might become involved if he could be sure of a financial benefit. The Cece Luppino hit may have been related to a home invasion on April 19, 2018, in Hamilton, when three men forced their way into a house at 19 Como Place, owned by Natale Luppino. and stabbed one individual. A police source told CBC News that both of the people in the home at the time were related to Cece Luppino \\"and are members of the Luppino crime family\\". In late April 2019, police arrested and charged two of the four suspects in Montreal with attempted murder, while the other two, also from Montreal, were already in custody; none were considered to be Mafia members. At that time of the arrests, there was some speculation as to whether the target of the 2018 incident had actually been Natale Luppino because he was the owner of the house that was targeted. A 2019 CBC News report later quoted a Mafia expert as stating that \\"Rizzuto's death paved the way for upheaval in the underworld. There's a power struggle left from the vacuum from Rizzuto\\". Also in spring 2019, one report stated that the Luppinos and the Musitano crime family seemed to be involved in the city's \\"mafia war\\". A report by The Hamilton Spectator discussed a \\"resurgence of Mafia violence in Hamilton and surrounding areas that has most recently included the shooting of Hamilton mob boss Pat Musitano\\" but made no connection to the Luppino family. Sources contacted by CBC News led the site to state that \\"some sort of underworld power struggle is tearing through the region, as old scores are settled and players jockey for power in a time of unrest\\". The wiretaps of Domenico and Giuseppe \\"Joe\\" Violi recorded a discussion that the Musitanos were supporting the Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan who have roots in Montreal and Toronto. The records also refer to a September 2017 recording made by police indicating that Pat Musitano was already a marked man at that time, but provide no indication as to who had authorized the \\"hit\\": \\"The [police agent] stated that [he] would have thought that ‚Äòthey‚Äô would have gotten rid of [Pat Musitano] before his brother, [Angelo Musitano, murdered in May 2017]. D Violi stated that 'they' wanted to show [Pat Musitano]; that it was a message, D Violi thought. They had told D Violi that ... [Pat Musitano] would be gone; that that would be one headache out of the way\\". In February 2020, two of the accused pleaded guilty to the 2018 invasion of Natale Luppino's home; the court heard that they had indeed planned to target Natale Luppino, in addition to his nephew Giuseppe Capobianco. Charles Boucher-Savard admitted to having stabbed Capobianco and received a four year sentence; Natale had also been in the home at the time but was not attacked. The second individual, Jonathan Monette, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and was sentenced to one year. Four other persons, from Montreal, faced charges of attempted murder for their roles in the conspiracy. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *C√©dilot, Andr√© and No√´l, Andr√©.

The film was produced by Black Maria e Globo Filmes, directed and written by Afonso Poyart, with the cast of Jos√© Loreto, Cleo Pires, R√¥mulo Arantes Neto, Milhem Cortaz, Jackson Antunes, Claudia Ohana, Paloma Bernardi and Rafinha Bastos. The idea of the film was conceived during Internet searches made by Poyart after a call from the director of expansion and shareholder of Paris Filmes who proposed a project for a feature film involving MMA. In 2011, Poyart's producer, Black Maria, was already commanding the development of the film which had high points of standstill due to problems ranging from casting to the director's own absence for engagements in Hollywood cinema. In September 2018, the movie was nominated at the 46th International Emmy Awards for best TV Movie / Mini-Series. ==Synopsis== The film tells the story of Jos√© Aldo, a poor family boy, marked by domestic violence, who leaves Amazonas for Rio de Janeiro in search of a chance as an athlete. To beat opponents in the Octagon, however, he must first settle accounts with his past and overcome old traumas. ==Cast== *Jos√© Loreto as Jos√© Aldo *Cleo Pires as Vivi (Viviane) *Milhem Cortaz as Ded√© Pederneiras *Jackson Antunes as Seu Jos√© *Claudia Ohana as Rocilene *R√¥mulo Neto as Fernandinho *Paloma Bernardi as Luiza *Thaila Ayala as Laura *Rafinha Bastos as Marcos Loro *Felipe Titto as Tony Mendigo *Paulo Zulu as Mestre Marcinho *Robson Nunes as Marquinhos *Jos√© Trassi as Guimba *Dirley \\"M√£o de Pedra\\" Broenstrup as UFC 129 fighter (Mark Hominick) *Bruce Buffer as himself *Jonathan Haagensen as drug trafficker ==Production== Pre-production After seeing the trailer for 2 Coelhos in his apartment in Alto de Pinheiros in S√£o Paulo, Sandi Adamiu, director of expansion and shareholder of Paris Filmes, called Afonso Poyart, showing his interest in developing a project involving MMA. Poyart bought the idea and said he saw in the history of UFC champion Jos√© Aldo all the elements needed: hard life, willpower, struggle for a dream, overcoming. \\"And he has a deal with his father, which is a remarkable story. He is a hero, but he has a facet of villain at the same time, it's ambiguous,\\" said the director who along with Paris Films, went to the quest to buy the copyright. On June 2011, the director and screenwriter, Afonso Poyart, in an interview with Esporte UOL reiterated that his producer Black Maria was in the pre-production of a film based on the trajectory of Jos√© Aldo. The plot would be centered on the story of the fighter, \\"a guy who started down there, went through needs and moved the world,\\" Poyart said. Afonso Poyart was still involved in works related to the distribution of 2 Coelhos, thus generating a delay in the progress of the production of the cinebiography, whose provisional title at the time was \\"Vale Tudo - Uma Hist√≥ria de Luta\\". The development of the feature film came to various halts, with a stalled period from Poyart due to commitments made in Hollywood cinema in a drama titled Solace starring Anthony Hopkins. After a period of production recess, it was speculated that production would restart at the end of 2012 under command now of Daniel Filho, with Poyart as executive producer. In the end, Poyart even with the commitments of Solace, returned as director to the production of the biographical work. Later, Marcelo Rubens Paiva was hired to do a final treatment of the script. Filming With an estimated production budget of R $5 million, $1 million being an incentive investment from Ancine, The filming of Mais Forte que o Mundo began at the end of May 2015. The multi- sport center of S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, better known as Teatr√£o, was one of the first filming locations. A ring was set up in the center of the theatrical gymnasium for Jos√© Loreto to interpret Jos√© Aldo's drills. In addition to the gymnasium, the fa√ßade of the S√£o Jos√© dos Campos municipal hospital was also a recording point. In the recording, the facade of the hospital became an area of the Aeroporto Internacional de Manaus. On July 2015, there was a production stoppage due to a wound of Jos√© Loreto when he went to make a mortal leap and ended twisting his ankle. Other scenes were also recorded in S√£o Paulo, S√£o Bernardo do Campo, Santos and Rio de Janeiro. On September 2015, the last scenes were shot in Las Vegas. Release Stronger than the World was scheduled to launch on national circuits on January 14, 2016 by the distributors Downtown and Paris Films. However, the directors of the distribution companies took into account a possible failure at the box office due to UFC 194, in which Jose Aldo was defeated by the Irish fighter Conor McGregor. According to journalist Fl√°vio Ricco, from UOL, the distributors wanted to take advantage of the Brazilian's victory to promote the biopic. Thus, the debut was postponed indefinitely, being finally released on June 16, 2016. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2016 films Category:Brazilian films Category:Brazilian biographical drama films Category:2016 biographical drama films Category:Portuguese-language films Category:2016 drama films ","title":"Mais Forte que o Mundo"},{"id":"54202595","text":"H13 is a regional road (P-Highway) in Lviv Oblast and Zakarpattia Oblast, Ukraine.

The engine was also used in the Vickers MBT and its Indian-built derivative, the Vijayanta. ==Development== The initial engine choice in 1954 for what was known at the time as \\"Medium Gun Tank No.2\\", later designated the \\"FV4201\\" and given the service name 'Chieftain', was a Rolls-Royce diesel V8, however during the Chieftain's design phase NATO introduced a policy in 1957 requiring all armoured fighting vehicles to have a multi-fuel capability. This left the Rolls-Royce engine an unsuitable option and so a new engine with this capability was required. Leyland Motors, under the direction of the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (FVRDE) at Chertsey, was asked to develop an opposed-piston two-stroke diesel of similar design to those previously produced by Napier and Tilling-Stevens, the latter's Commer TS3 engine being particularly highly regarded. This configuration, apart from being well-suited to multi-fuel use, also had the advantages of being of simple design with a low parts count, had low bearing loads, and possessed good cold-starting characteristics. Some technical assistance was provided to Leyland by Rolls-Royce, who by that time was a parent to the Napier aero- engine company, Napier itself remained a subsidiary of English Electric. Both Tilling-Stevens and Leyland produced single-cylinder prototype engines for the tank engine project and by 1959 the resulting complete engine design had become the Leyland 60, or L60, with the first engine running that same year. ==Overview== One of the reasons the L60's unusual configuration was chosen was so as to obtain as compact a power plant as possible so allowing the height of the vehicle to be kept as low as was practicable, a requirement for the Chieftain's design philosophy. The use of the two-stroke cycle allowed for a greater power for a given displacement, the 19 litres of the projected diesel engine being expected to be capable of around the same power as the previous, larger displacement, 27 litre, 600 hp Rover Meteor petrol engine, whilst taking up less room in the engine compartment. Scavenging, necessary in a large two-stroke diesel for evacuating the cylinders of exhaust gases, was performed by a Roots blower. ==Maintenance== The Chieftain's L60 engine and cooling system were designed into an integrated engine-pack which could be changed \\"in the field\\" using the crane of an FV434 Armoured Repair Vehicle, which had been designed for this purpose, and a complete engine change took around one-and-a-half, to 2 hours. The requirement for an easily changeable engine pack was the result of a British Army analysis of previous tank battles that concluded that a likely future tank battle would last no longer than two hours and so the most demanding requirement expected for any tank engine during wartime would be for it to be run at full power for this total amount of time only, and so it would then be advantageous for it to be removed from the vehicle after the battle and exchanged for a fresh engine within a minimum of time. This practice would also allow the removed engines to be worked on in properly equipped REME workshops rather than 'in the field', the engines being exchanged between vehicles and workshops as-and-when required. This philosophy was also applied to the contemporary FV430 series of vehicles. The Chieftain. ==Performance== The initial production L60 units were, at 585 bhp at 2,100 rpm, down on the designed initial power of 600 bhp and were plagued with reliability problems. These problems were exacerbated during the Chieftain's introduction by initially an inadequate spares stock and an insufficient spare engine 'float' . The L60 reliability problem would have been far worse had it not been for the removable engine pack, which usually allowed a vehicle to be operational again with a replacement engine within a couple of hours of breaking down. A persistent source of trouble was the failure of the cylinder liner sealing resulting in coolant leakage into the cylinder bore. Fan drive belts overstressed fan bearing housings in the crankcase leading to cracking. Reliability did improve over time with modifications and improvement programmes, such as the \\"Sundance\\" programme which also improved power output. Sundance was carried out in five main phases between 1976 and 1979. Sundance had been preceded by \\"Dark Morn\\", \\"High Noon\\", and the initial \\"Fleetfoot\\" engine development programme -the person responsible for the choosing of code names apparently being an admirer of the Western film. Sundance programme was the subject parliamentary questions in the House of Commons in 1978. With the final rectification of most of the L60's previous reliability and power problems, vehicle availability levels rose to 80%. In the 1990 Gulf War Chieftain AARV and CHAVRE availability levels exceeded those of the Challenger 1 tank which had by that point replaced Chieftain. Final production engines were . Modifications to engines in service under the various improvement programmes meant that final L60 engines were Initially, due to unfamiliarity with the two-stroke engine's different exhaust note and power band compared to a four-stroke engine, and with the resulting difficulty in choosing the correct gear required for the particular driving task, trainee drivers tended to under-rev the engines and use inappropriate gear selections, leading to great difficulty climbing gradients, and when the Chieftain Mk 1 was first introduced some drivers had difficulty climbing the vehicle onto the trailers of Thornycroft Antar tank transporters. == L60 variants == *Mark 1 - Mark 4, prototype engines completed 1959 to 1965, 60 built *Mark 4A, first production variant, January 1965, producing 585 bhp.

She received an Order of the British Empire for rowing 145 kilometres to save a man who accidentally shot himself. ==Early life== Heathcock was born in Murray Bridge in South Australia in 1901, one of seven children of railway engineer Frederick John Rayney and his wife Emily Melissa (n√©e Soar). She was interested in Aboriginal culture from childhood, where she befriended many Aboriginal people in the region. She trained to be a nurse from the age of 16, training at the Adelaide General Hospital and later the Lameroo Hospital. She fell ill during this time, and had a lung removed. After she recovered she went to work at Point McLeay Mission. ==Life in the Northern Territory== In 1930 Heathcock sailed from Adelaide to Darwin on the Malabar to join Dr John Flynn's Australian Inland Mission. She commenced working at the tin mining settlement Maranboy where she met and married English soldier and Mounted Constable Ted Heathcock on 5 November 1931 at the Mataranka Hotel. They moved to Borroloola at Roper Bar region where Ted worked as a policeman. Heathcock began treating Aboriginal people with leprosy. She lobbied to treat people on their land, despite policy at the time that required lepers to be moved to an isolated facility on Channel Island in Darwin Harbour. She developed close relationships to Alawar people, who took her to remote areas to treat lepers who were hiding to avoid relocation. Ted eventually wrote to the League of Nations in Geneva outlining a case for people to be treated on their land. It was eventually adopted by the Administration. In March 1941, she rowed 145 kilometres to rescue a man named Horace Foster who had accidentally shot himself. He had sent a note with an Aboriginal man to the Borroloola Police Station requesting help. It read: > \\"Have shot myself accidentally. Think I am settled. Can you come out? Shot > the bone in two above the knee. May bleed to death.\\" She was taken by four Aboriginal people, Roger Jose and Jupiter and their wives Bessie and Maggie down the McArthur River into the open sea to the mouth of the Wearyan River in a dugout canoe, a three-day journey. While she treated his wound, he died just an hour before the arrival of the flying doctor. The act of bravery won her an Order of the British Empire in 1951. During World War 2, Heathcock and her husband were evacuated, Ted to Alice Springs where he died in 1943, while Ruth took a group of lepers to South Australia. She then accompanied them back to Darwin before moving to Alice Springs to care for Aboriginal children with her sister. ==Later life== By the early 1980s Heathcock had moved to Kingston Park in Adelaide to live with her sister. She was named 'citizen of the year' in 1988 by the Marion Council. She returned to the Territory in 1984 for the filming of a documentary about her life by Karen Hughes called Pitjiri: the snake that will not sink. She was named Pitjiri in 1936 by a group of Aboriginal people from Arnhem Land, meaning 'a snake that floats on water and cannot sink'. Heathcock died on 7 May 1995 at the age of 94. ==References== Category:1901 births Category:Australian nurses Category:1995 deaths Category:Australian recipients of the British Empire Medal Category:People from Murray Bridge, South Australia ","title":"Ruth Heathcock"},{"id":"54202739","text":"Amphipathic Lipid Packing Sensor (ALPS) motifs were first identified in 2005 in ARFGAP1 and have been reviewed. adsorb to) curved lipid bilayers.

Rwigara was charged on 23 September 2017, alongside her mother and four other defendants, with \\"inciting insurrection\\" among other counts, but was acquitted along with her mother on 6 December 2018. ==Early life== Diane Rwigara was born in Kigali in 1982 to a Tutsi family and has three siblings. Her father, Assinapol Rwigara, an industrialist and a key financier of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, was killed in a car collision on 4 February 2015 in Gacuriro, Kigali. Her family believes the accident was politically motivated murder. The police said he was instantly killed when the Mercedez-Benz car he was driving was in a head-on collision with a heavy truck. ==Career== Rwigara is a trained accountant. She has repeatedly spoken out against the country's governance under President Paul Kagame and about injustice and oppression. On 3 May 2017, Rwigara announced her intention to run in the presidential election. 72 hours later, nude photos of her were leaked in an apparent attempt to humiliate and intimidate her. She reiterated her intention to run, with campaign vows to work towards eradicating poverty, establishing universal health insurance and championing free speech. On 7 July 2017, the National Electoral Commission disqualified Rwigara from the election on technical grounds, alleging she had used forged signatures in her presidential bid and had submitted only 572 valid signatures rather than the required 600. Rwigara said she submitted 958 signatures, with an additional 120 after some were disqualified. Two other candidates were also disqualified, prompting Amnesty International to say that the election would be held in a \\"climate of fear and repression.\\" The decision was also criticised by the US State Department and the European Union. Kagame won the 4 August election with 98% of the vote. Rwigara launched an activist group called the People Salvation Movement to challenge the regime on its human rights record, saying that the country's parliament is little more than a rubber-stamp. The People Salvation Movement according to Rwigara, will continue her work of sensitising Rwandans about their rights and criticising policies and actions of the ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) party.(14 July 2017 Friday). Diane Rwigara now launches rights movement. The East African. Retrieved from Nexis Uni. Arrest On 30 August 2017, Rwigara's home was raided, with police saying she was being investigated for forgery and tax evasion. Rwigara's family reported her missing, saying that unknown armed men in civilian clothes had held her at gunpoint while the house was searched, but police denied that she had been arrested. Numerous news outlets reported in September 2017 that Rwigara still could not be reached and that her family continued to claim she is missing. Leon Orsmond, a South African freelance advertising creative, who had helped Rwigara with her social media campaign was also missing in Rwanda since February 2018. Before his disappearance, Orsmond made no secret that he didn‚Äôt like the government of Kagame. In June 2018, the Rwanda Revenue Authority sold machinery from the family's tobacco business for almost $2m in a bid to recover what they claimed was $7m in tax arrears. A previous auction of Rwigara's family business assets - of processed tobacco - netted more than 500m Rwandan francs. Amnesty International called on the Rwandan judiciary to ensure that the trial did not become just another means to persecute government critics. In August 2018, #FreeDianeRwigara was being used by Kenyans on Twitter to call for Kagame to release Rwigara. This came just days after Twitter users in Kenya did the same for Uganda‚Äôs MP Robert Kyagulanyi, better known as Bobby Wine. On 5 October 2018, a court ordered a release of Rwigara and her mother, Adeline Rwigara, on bail; this came a few weeks after the early release of 2,140 convicts, including Victoire Ingabire and Kizito Mihigo. After more than one year in prison, Rwanda's High Court finally released Rwigara and her mother, Adeline, on bail. They were told not to leave the capital, Kigali, without permission, and their trial would continue. Several US Senators, including Dick Durbin, Ann Wagner, Patrick Leahy and Barbara Lee, as well as members of the congressional Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission called on the Rwandan government to drop the charges as violations freedom of expression. Rwandan officials accused the US politicians of meddling in their judicial procedures. Acquittal A three- judge panel of Rwanda's high court acquitted Rwigara and her mother on 6 December 2018, finding all of the charges \\"baseless\\". The court found that Rwigara was exercising her right to speech in criticising the President and did not incite violence. Her mother was acquitted of promoting sectarianism, ethnic division and inciting violence. Rwigara addressed the media inside the courtroom, saying,\\"I hope this means that the persecution I and my family have faced is over and that I have the liberty to speak my mind.

This is one of Burt Reynolds' last film appearances before his passing on September 2018. ==Synopsis== An aging movie star is invited to a small, local film festival in Nashville. He attends and goes on a journey throughout his past as he faces the fact that his glory days are behind him. ==Cast== *Burt Reynolds as Vic Edwards *Ariel Winter as Lil McDougal *Clark Duke as Doug McDougal *Ellar Coltrane as Shane McAvoy *Chevy Chase as Sonny *Nikki Blonsky as Faith Cole *Kathleen Nolan as Claudia Schulman *Al-Jaleel Knox as Stuart Muckler *Juston Street as Bjorn *Shelley Waggener as Nurse *Todd Vittum as Buddy Blump *Amy Hoerler as Nurse Amy *Jena Sims as Beautiful Woman #1 *Kennedy Summers as Beautiful Woman #2 ==Production== According to director Adam Rifkin, it took him about seven years to secure financing for the film. Rifkin had written the film with Burt Reynolds specifically in mind for the lead role, with many elements of the main character sharing similarities to Reynolds's personal life. Principal photography began on May 9, 2016. Most of the film was shot in Knoxville, Tennessee. Scenes from previous Reynolds films Deliverance (1972) and Smokey and the Bandit (1977) were included in the film. ==Release== The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 22, 2017. On June 14, 2017, A24 and DirecTV Cinema acquired distribution rights to the film. Shortly thereafter, the film's title was changed from the working title Dog Years, in a mutual decision between the filmmakers and A24 (who made the suggestion). The film served as the closing-night film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival on January 14, 2018.

The website's critics consensus reads, \\"The Last Movie Star has a few poignant moments thanks to Burt Reynolds and Ariel Winter, but their performances are stranded in a middling drama unworthy of their efforts\\". On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score of 46 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The film received mostly mixed reviews. In a mixed review for NPR, Scott Tobias stated, \\"Though Rifkin's heart is in the right place, there's not a moment in the film that isn't overplayed\\" and that, \\"Had Rifkin been willing to dial down the soppiness even a little, there's potential for The Last Movie Star to double as a tribute to Reynolds and a cautionary tale on the perils of fame.\\" A review in Variety states that the movie \\"never quite transcends such pedestrian execution.\\" Rolling Stone gave the film two out of four stars, calling it an \\"opportunity missed.\\" In a positive review for RogerEbert.com, Sheila O'Malley gave the film three out of four stars. Many reviews pointed to Reynolds's performance as a highlight of the film. Referring to Reynolds's performance, a review in the Los Angeles Times stated, \\"Thanks to its star‚Äôs all-in commitment, the overtly maudlin film works better than it should,\\" while a review from Nerd Reactor stated, \\"The Last Movie Star shows us why Burt Reynolds is a legendary actor. It‚Äôs just a shame that the rest of the film isn‚Äôt as good.\\" Rolling Stone referred to the film as Reynolds's \\"swan song\\". The Last Movie Star would be one of Reynolds's last film projects, as he would die several months after the film's release. Accolades The film, as Dog Years, received the Chairman's Award at the 2017 San Diego International Film Festival. It was also named Best International Dramatic Feature at the 2018 Edmonton International Film Festival. ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Last Movie Star ‚Äì Official Movie Site *The Last Movie Star at AllMovie *The Last Movie Star at Box Office Mojo * *The Last Movie Star at Metacritic *The Last Movie Star at Rotten Tomatoes *Dog Years at the TCM Movie Database Category:2017 films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:A24 films Category:Films about actors Category:Films directed by Adam Rifkin Category:2017 drama films ","title":"The Last Movie Star"},{"id":"54202952","text":"Sakya Trizin Ngawang Kunga served as the 41st Sakya Trizin, the throne holder of the Sakya Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, from his appointment in 1952 until his retirement in 2017. His religious name is Ngawang Kunga Tegchen Palbar Trinley Samphel Wangyi Gyalpo (). After passing the throne of the Sakya lineage to his elder son Ratna Vajra Rinpoche who became the 42nd Sakya Trizin on 9 March 2017, he is now known as Kyabgon Gongma Trichen Rinpoche. He is considered second only to the Dalai Lama, in the spiritual hierarchy of Tibetan Buddhism. ==Biography== Ngawang Kunga was born on September 7, 1945 in Tsedong, near Shigatse, Tibet. From his father, Vajradhara Ngawang Kunga Rinchen, he received important initiations and teachings in the Sakya lineage. He began intensive religious study at the age of five. In 1952, he was officially designated as the next Sakya Trizin by the Fourteenth Dalai Lama.Biographies of The Great Sachen Kunga Nyingpo and His Holiness the 41st Sakya Trizin. Compiled by Ratna Vajra Sakya, Dolma Lhamo, and Lama Jampa Losel. Published by Sakya Academy, Dehradun, U.A. India. 2003. He continued intensive training from his main teacher Ngawang Lodroe Shenpen Nyingpo and many other famous Tibetan scholars, studying extensively in both the esoteric and exoteric Buddhist traditions. In 1959, at the age of fourteen, he was formally enthroned as head of the Sakya Order of Tibetan Buddhism. In the same year, due to the political situation in Tibet, Sakya Trizin Ngawang Kunga, his family, and many lamas and monks from the Sakya Monastery relocated to India. To maintain the unbroken lineage of the Khon family, in 1974 he consented to requests that he accept Tashi Lhakee, daughter of a noble family from Derge in Kham as his consort. In the same year his first son, Ratna Vajra Rinpoche, was born. In 1979, a second son, Gyana Vajra Rinpoche was born. After leaving Tibet, in 1964, Sakya Trizin Ngawang Kunga re-established the seat of the Sakya in Rajpur, India, building a monastery known as Sakya Centre. Since that time, he has worked tirelessly to preserve the thousand-year-old religious heritage of the Sakya Order and to transmit its teachings to succeeding generations. He founded and directly guides a number of institutions, including Sakya Monastery in Rajpur, Sakya Institute, Sakya College, Sakya Nunnery, Sakya College for Nuns, Sakya Tibetan Settlement, Sakya Hospital, dozens of other monasteries and nunneries in Tibet, Nepal, and India, and numerous Dharma Centers in many countries. Kyabgon Gongma Trichen Rinpoche is regarded as one of the most highly qualified Buddhist lineage holder respected by all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism and teaches widely throughout the world. He has bestowed the extensive Lam Dre teaching cycle, which is the most important teaching of the Sakya Order over 18 times on various continents, and also transmitted major initiation cycles such as Collection of all the Tantras, and the Collection of all the SƒÅdhanƒÅs, which contain almost all of the empowerments for the esoteric practices of the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism to hundreds of lineage holders in the next generation of Buddhist teachers. He has trained both of his sons as highly qualified Buddhist masters, and they both travel widely, teaching Buddhism throughout the world. The year 2009 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the 41st Sakya Trizin's leadership of the Sakya Order. The occasion was celebrated as a Golden Jubilee with extensive celebrations and tributes to his success in preserving and maintaining the Sakya school. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Penny-Dimri, Sandra.

While he was initially successful in evading his powerful enemies, he was eventually captured and killed, putting an end to his state of Nyarong. ==Background== Gombo Namgye was born in 1799 in Nyarong; his parents were from a lineage of local chieftains who ruled the middle of the Nyarong Valley; his father had refused to submit to Qing rule and had been killed for it. The region of Nyarong was poor due to its isolation and inaccessibility, and its inhabitants made their living by raiding caravans and bandit activity. Soon Namgye inherited the chieftainship from his parents, marking his entry into history. ==Rise to power== By the end of the 1840s, Namgye had united the three chiefdoms of the Nyarong Valley, marking a break from its historical disunity. This was met with a Qing campaign into Nyarong, however, it was driven back. However, it soon became apparent that his ambitions were greater than this, as he soon attacked the Hor States, Derge, and Litang, as well as, in the words of Tibetan historian Yudru Tsomu, \\"harassing and plundering the domains of the Chakla king\\". To avoid Namgye's campaigns, especially due to his reputation for being merciless, states such as Golog, Nangchen, Serta, and Jyekundo, decided to submit to him. By the early 1860s, he was confident enough to impede trade linking Kham and Tibet. However, his most infamous and alarming act to both the Ganden Phodrang and Qing governments was threatening to take his forces to Lhasa and enter the Jokhang. There he would steal two of holiest statues of Tibetan Buddhism and take him to his homeland, where he would install them and force pilgrims to travel there.Powers 2012, p. 435. By 1860, he controlled almost all of Kham. ==Defeat and capture== These threats, along with the disruption of trade and the defeated Khampa rulers petitioning to get their land back, meant the Ganden Phodrang and Qing governments had to take action. As Aten, a refugee from Nyarong said: The government in Lhasa was particularly worried about his conquest of Kham, which they thought could serve as a base for the conquest of all of Tibet. In 1863, the Ganden Phodrang government launched its campaign, mobilising forces in the middle of Tibet, in concert with Qing forces from Sichuan.Powers 2012, p. 435. By 1865, continued defeat led to him being pursued into Nyarong, where he was trapped in a castle, which was then set on fire, killing him.Ronis 2012 ==Legacy and views== After the death of Namgye, the Ganden Phodrang government took control of Nyarong, as well as influencing Derge and the Hor States, resulting in renewed conflict between Ganden Phodrang and Qing leaders, eventually culminating in Zhao Erfeng's expedition into Tibet. Due to Namgye's opposition to the Gandren Phodrang forming a parallel to the CCP's opposition to the 14th Dalai Lama, the Communist government has praised Namgye as a peasant leader and hero, based on their slogans of \\"where there is oppression there is resistance\\", despite his noble origins; this has resulted in hotels being built named after him.Woeser 2011 Some historians contend that if Namgye's state had survived, it would have being more effective than the Ganden Phodrang at dispelling Chinese invasion.Powers 2012, p. 435. ==References== Category:Garz√™ Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Category:History of Tibet Category:People from Kham Category:Tibetan Buddhists from Tibet Category:1799 births Category:1865 deaths Category:19th-century Tibetan people Category:18th-century Tibetan people ","title":"Gombo Namgye"},{"id":"54202959","text":"Gorna Le≈°nica (, ) is a village in the municipality of ≈Ωelino, North Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 189 inhabitants.

He is a former judge and German federal prosecutor for the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes. He is known as the \\"last of the Nazi hunters\\" for his work in setting legal precedent in seeking punishment for former SS officers and guards who were involved in the Holocaust, whether directly responsible for deaths or not. His father Rudolph saved two Jewish families during the Kristallnacht anti-Jewish riots of 1938. \\"My father had quite a lot of Jewish friends in the '30s and he had hidden two families in our big garden during the Night of Broken Glass and they stayed there for some weeks until they had organized their escape to Australia and Paraguay.\\" ==John Demanjuk case== After 23 years, he retired as a judge in 2006, joining the Central Office for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes, setting out to change the precedent on prosecuting Nazi guards. After the war, it is estimated that between 7,000 to 8,000 SS guards served at Auschwitz. Before Walther became a Nazi hunter, only 48 were convicted. In 2011, after standing trial for two years, German courts decided to convict John Demjanjuk without any direct evidence of murder ‚Äìsimply by being a guard who watched thousands march to their death made him complicit in the murder of 27,900 Dutch Jews at Sobibor. Demjanjuk, 91, was found guilty in May 2011 of helping to murder more than 28,000 Jews at Sobibor and sentenced to five years in prison. He was released pending an appeal and was moved to a nursing home. The two major contributions Walther helped bring into law were that a Nazi did not have to be directly involved to be guilty of aiding and abetting a murder during the Holocaust; and a Holocaust survivor who testifies in a German court does not have to directly identify the defendant. Walther took this opportunity to help find any remaining German citizens who were former Nazi SS guards. Given that his hunt for Nazis started almost 70 years after the Holocaust ended, many had passed away. He eventually located four former Nazi guards: Oskar Gr√∂ning, Reinhold Hanning, Hubert Zafke and Ernst Tremmel. In April, Tremmel died just days before he was to go to trial at the age of 93, and Zafke's trial has been postponed indefinitely ‚Äì he's been deemed unfit to stand trial due to his ill health. On June 15, 2015, Gr√∂ning, known as the \\"Bookkeeper of Auschwitz,\\" became the 50th Nazi guard to be convicted since the war ended. The New York Times wrote, \\"Thomas Walther, a German lawyer who was the driving force behind the trial of Mr. Demjanjuk, represented Holocaust survivors as co-plaintiffs in the trials of Mr. Hanning and Mr. Gr√∂ning. He expressed frustration that Mr. Hanning never responded to his clients' pleas to recount his experience at Auschwitz so that present and future generations would know of it. But in a telephone interview on Thursday, Mr. Walther said that the clients he had contacted on hearing of Mr. Hanning's death insisted that the most important thing was that Mr. Hanning was brought to justice and that his deeds were recounted in court.\\" June 17, 2016 Hanning was convicted for the crimes he committed at Auschwitz, and Walther helped bring the 51st Nazi guard to justice following the war. Hanning's trial has been dubbed by many as the \\"Last of the Nazi trials.\\" ==Gr√∂ning trial== Gr√∂ning worked as an accountant at Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland, sorting and counting the money taken from those killed or used as slave labour, and sending it back to his Nazi superiors in Berlin. The court in the northern city of L√ºneburg acknowledged that he had only been a \\"cog in the wheel\\" at the camp but that it had taken thousands of such people to keep running \\"a machinery designed entirely for the killing\\" of human beings. Presiding judge Franz Kompisch called it \\"scandalous\\" that it had taken so long for the German justice system to prosecute such cases. ==Legacy== Rafi Yablonsky of Jewish National Fund Toronto said: \\"When we write these final chapters on the Holocaust, Thomas Walther, the last of the Nazi hunters, should not just be included ‚Äì he should be recognized as a post-Holocaust member of the \\"Righteous Among the Nations.\\" At the 2017 March of the Living ceremony, Walther said, \\"Shalom. I have worked for quite a long time to change the law practice in Germany [regarding] accessory to murder in places just like Auschwitz‚Ä¶ I did it for the survivors, I did it for the victims and I did it for the children of the victims. And I did it as well for the future‚Ä¶ And the future is with me here, the young generation‚Ä¶.They are my hope - they are also my future and your future, and your hope.

It is one of Disney's three flagship subscription streaming brands in the United States, alongside Disney+ and Hulu. ESPN+ is marketed as an add-on subscription on top of ESPN's core linear networks, with content similar to or having been exclusively moved to the service from ESPN3 (thus having been paywalled in comparison to WatchESPN, which offered the content at no additional charge to ESPN subscribers), such as combat sports (including coverage of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Top Rank boxing), college sports, cricket, rugby union, soccer (including out-of-market Major League Soccer matches), golf (including coverage of the PGA Championship) and tennis. The National Hockey League and Major League Baseball's out-of-market sports packages (which are both, as with ESPN+, operated using technology of Disney subsidiary BAMTech) are sold through the platform as add-ons. The service also features archive content and ESPN original documentaries, and access to premium content on ESPN.com. ESPN+ does not include access to the full ESPN linear channels, as they continue to only be available through \\"traditional or non-traditional\\" television providers. Thus, ESPN's major professional sports rights, including National Football League, National Basketball Association, and Major League Baseball coverage, are not included in the service. As of March 2019, ESPN+ is the exclusive outlet for UFC pay-per-view events, sold for an additional fee. As of February 3, 2020, the service has over 7.6 million paying subscribers. , ESPN+ had over 8.5 million subscribers. ==History== In August 2016, The Walt Disney Company acquired a minority stake in BAMTech, a spin-out of MLB Advanced Media's streaming technology business, for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. It was also announced that Disney subsidiary ESPN was planning to develop an over-the-top service based on BAMTech technology as \\"an exploratory OTT project\\", drawing primarily from ESPN-owned rights for events not broadcast on television. ESPN already used BAMTech's platform for its TV Everywhere service WatchESPN. Disney CEO Bob Iger remarked that despite declines in the pay television industry due to cord-cutting, \\"live sports has really thrived, even in a world where there's so much more for people to do and to watch.\\" In August 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech, and announced that it planned to launch its ESPN OTT service in 2018, followed by a Disney entertainment OTT service in 2019 (thus ending its relationship with Netflix). At this time, Disney stated that the new ESPN service would draw from ESPN- owned sports rights, as well as MLB, NHL, and Major League Soccer content (although lacking major ESPN-owned rights such as the NBA and NFL), and that an accompanying redesign of the ESPN app would make it a \\"premier digital destination\\" for sports content. During Disney's fourth-quarter earnings call, Iger revealed that the service would be known as ESPN+. In December 2017, Disney announced its intent to acquire 21st Century Fox after the spin-off of certain businesses. The deal was to include the Fox Sports Networks group of regional sports networks (which Disney was ordered to divest under antitrust grounds), which led to suggestions that Disney wanted to incorporate FSN's regional sports rights into the service. In February 2018, Iger stated that ESPN was aiming for a monthly price of $4.99. ESPN+ and BAMTech were placed into the newly formed Disney business segment, Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International, on March 14, 2018. On April 2, 2018, ESPN announced that ESPN+ would officially launch on April 12, 2018, and confirmed its $4.99 per-month pricing. On August 21, 2018, ESPN announced that it had merged its existing ESPN Insider subscription service into ESPN+, adding access to premium ESPN.com content (such as exclusive beat reports, and advanced sports statistics and analytics tools) to the service. Both services shared the same monthly price, but ESPN Insider's existing annual subscribers were grandfathered under its previous $39.99 per-year price (as opposed to $49.99 for ESPN+), and all former ESPN Insider subscribers continued to receive the complimentary subscription to ESPN The Magazine that was part of the subscription. The magazine ended print publication in September 2019. On October 31, 2018, ESPN executive Russell Wolff was named executive vice president and general manager. On August 6, 2019, Disney announced that it will offer a bundle of ESPN+ with Disney+ and the ad-supported Hulu for $12.99 per-month. The bundle was officially released on November 12, the same day of the launch of Disney+. In October 2019, ESPN+ began to add pre-roll advertising to on-demand content on the service. ==Programming== Its launch content included boxing (including Top Rank events and archive content through 2025), college sports events (including Ivy League events, with the conference having reached a 10-year media rights deal with ESPN prior to the service's launch), coverage of Tennis Grand Slams, as well as international cricket (India national cricket team, Cricket Ireland, and New Zealand Cricket), soccer (including Major League Soccer, the United Soccer League, the U.S. Open Cup, 2019 Copa America, the English Football League (including Cup), Serie A, Eredivisie, A-League, FFA Cup, FA Cup, and UEFA Nations League) and rugby union events (including SANZAAR tournaments, Bledisloe Cup, Currie Cup, Major League Rugby, Mitre 10 Cup, and Pro14). In October 2018, ESPN+ obtained the rights for the Swedish Allsvenskan and the Danish Superliga as well, declaring their intent to broadcast one match per week for each league.https://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2018/10/espn-and-espn- acquire-rights-to-coppa-italia-and-supercoppa-italiana/ ESPN+ features out of market Major League Soccer matches at no additional charge for subscribers (replacing the previous MLS Live service), and the service holds exclusive rights to all regionally televised Chicago Fire matches through 2020 (as the second MLS team, behind Los Angeles FC's deal with YouTube TV, to sell its regional rights to a streaming service). MLB.tv and NHL.tv (which are operated by BAMTech) are also available for purchase within the ESPN+ platform, and offer daily games during their regular seasons for ESPN+ subscribers. PGA Tour Live (which was also ran by BAMTech) was included for the 2018 PGA Tour season, but moved to NBC Sports Gold in 2019. ESPN+ will offer supplemental feeds during the PGA Championship beginning 2020, including during CBS broadcast windows. In 2022, PGA Tour Live will return to ESPN+ as part of a new long-term deal with the PGA Tour through 2030. In March 2019, the American Athletic Conference announced a 12-year media rights deal with ESPN, under which ESPN+ will carry the majority of events not aired by ESPN's linear channels. In May 2019, it was announced that ESPN+ would carry 18 World TeamTennis matches. In September 2019, ESPN+ announced its acquisition of rights to Germany's Bundesliga soccer league beginning in 2020, under a six- year deal. In the 2019-20 season, ESPN+ acquired the third-tier media rights for all but two Big 12 Conference teams (excluding Oklahoma and Texas, which have separate contracts with Fox and the ESPN-run Longhorn Network), carrying the games as part of a branded portal known as Big 12 Now. During the 2020 Major League Baseball season's Wild Card Series round, ESPN+ aired Squeeze Play‚Äîwhich featured live look-ins and analysis of the seven series ESPN held rights to (in a similar manner to the ESPN Bases Loaded service it offered during the NCAA baseball tournament), as well as Statcast broadcasts of selected games.  UFC  In May 2018, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) announced new five-year digital and linear television rights deals with ESPN, effective January 2019. 20 live UFC on ESPN+ Fight Night events per-year will be streamed exclusively by the service, as well as preliminaries for 10 live UFC on ESPN Fight Night events per-year. ESPN+ will also hold rights to supplemental content such as Dana White's Contender Series, archive content and PPV encores, and offer sales of UFC Fight Pass within the platform. The first ESPN+ event, UFC Fight Night: Cejudo vs. Dillashaw, generated 525,000 new subscribers on the day of the event alone. On March 18, 2019, it was announced that ESPN had reached a two-year extension of its contract with the UFC. Beginning at UFC 236, it is also the exclusive U.S. carrier of all UFC pay-per-view events for residential customers. Viewers must have an active ESPN+ subscription in order to purchase future UFC pay-per-views, and they are no longer sold through television providers. == Sports rights == The service focuses primarily on overflow content similar to that of ESPN's existing digital service ESPN3 (which is distributed to subscribers of participating internet and television subscribers), though some of ESPN3's content has been shifted exclusively to ESPN+.https://dtcimedia.disney.com/espn- plus/programming  Professional sports   Baseball  * Major League Baseball  Hockey  * National Hockey League * Ice Hockey World Championships  Combat sport  * Ultimate Fighting Championship ** Pay- per-view ** Fight Nights ** Preliminary fights * Top Rank * Professional Fighters League  Tennis  * US Open (tennis) * Australian Open * The Championships, Wimbledon * World TeamTennis  Association football  * Major League Soccer (Out of market games) * USL Championship * USL League One * U.S. Open Cup * UEFA Nations League * EFL Championship * EFL League One * EFL League Two * FA Cup * FA Community Shield * Women's FA Community Shield * Carabao Cup * Bundesliga * 2.Bundesliga * DFB-Pokal * DFL-Supercup * Serie A * Coppa Italia * Supercoppa Italiana * Eredivisie * Danish Superliga * Allsvenskan * A-League * FFA Cup * W-League (Australia) * Chinese Super League * Indian Super League  Rugby  * Major League Rugby * Pro14 * Super Rugby * The Rugby Championship * British and Irish Lions * Mitre 10 Cup * Currie Cup * Bledisloe Cup * World Rugby Sevens Series  Cricket  * Test cricket * One Day International * Twenty20  Lacrosse  * World Lacrosse Championship * Major League Lacrosse  Canadian football  * Canadian Football League  Auto Racing  * Formula One  Esports  * League of Legends Championship Series  College Sports   American football  * American Athletic Conference * Big 12 Conference * Big South Conference * Ivy League * Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference * Mid-American Conference * Missouri Valley Football Conference * Conference USA * Ohio Valley Conference * Southern Conference * Southland Conference * Sun Belt Conference  Basketball  * American Athletic Conference * America East Conference * Atlantic 10 Conference * Atlantic Sun Conference * Big 12 Conference * Big South Conference * Horizon League * Ivy League * Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference * Mid-American Conference * Missouri Valley Conference * Conference USA * Ohio Valley Conference * Southern Conference * Southland Conference * Sun Belt Conference * Western Athletic Conference Original programming ESPN+ also carries ESPN original programming and documentaries, such as the 30 for 30 franchise (with some premiering on ESPN+ prior to their premiere on ESPN), and exclusive original series and studio programs: * Detail - A franchise of programs featuring analysis of sports by associated players.

To successfully achieve proper policies, community governments must first identify and map the community's assets, capacities, and abilities in order to properly understand a community's strengths and weaknesses i.e. physical, economic, political, social, among others. Through this, it fills the gaps that are created by larger governmental structures and market lags that are not dealt with at state and federal levels. Top-down approaches to community governance include community government wherein elected officials set policy and exact power over their local communities to enact policies while bottom-up approaches focus on citizen action at the grassroots level wherein communities form action groups and leaders demand change and create policy. Community governance takes decision-making and community leadership executed by community members that have a vested interest in their community. By focusing on community instead of the non-profit, for-profit, and government sectors, community governance distinguishes itself from other forms of governance. ==References== Category:Governance ","title":"Community governance"},{"id":"54203468","text":"Merovo (, ) is a village in the municipality of ≈Ωelino, North Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 901 inhabitants.

It was circumscribed by mycologists Otto Miettinen and Leif Ryvarden in 2016, as a continuation of prior work that outlined a revised framework for the Steccherinaceae based on molecular phylogenetics. Its closest relative in the Steccherinaceae is the genus Nigroporus, from which it differs in its light-coloured fruit bodies and monomitic context. The generic name Trulla, from the Latin word for \\"ladle\\", alludes to the spatulate (spoon- like) shape of the fruit bodies. Microscopic characteristics of the genus include spores that are curved and cylindrical, cyanophilic skeletal hyphae (staining blue if the microscopic stain Lactophenol Cotton Blue is applied) and slightly thick-walled, wide generative hyphae in the context. ==Species== Trulla contains six species that were transferred from various other polypore genera, including Antrodiella, Polyporus, Leptoporus, Coriolus, and Tyromyces.

It was released direct-to-DVD in the U.S. on May 3, 2016. ==Plot== Two employees for Arkansas Fracking Industries (AFI), Fred and Sam are busy detonating explosives near the Arkansas State Prison for Women when they inadvertently release a shark covered in spikes into the surrounding swamp. As five inmates, Anita, Michelle, Sarah, Shannon, and Samantha, load up in a transport vehicle, the shark kills Fred & Sam. Detectives Kendra and Adam, comb the swamps for someone and find an overturned canoe, next to some human remains. Under the canoe is a man blabbering ‚Äúshark‚Äù repeatedly. The corrections officers and 5 prisoners arrive at an area of the swamp where the prisoners are required to remove tree stumps. Samantha bribes Mike to let her go wash off her arm in the nearby creek and she‚Äôs eaten by the shark. Mike searches for her, finds only bloody clothes, and radios into the warden that she‚Äôs escaped. Heading back to the prison, Anita‚Äôs girlfriend Honey, hijacks the van and forces the two officers into the back with the others allowing Anita up front. Kendra & Adam overhear on their scanner about the hijacking. Honey and Anita stop to change vehicles and make the women change. Mike escapes into the swamp but is eaten by the shark. The prisoners arrive at a house where Honey has killed the occupant for them to hide out temporarily. While there, the girls argue amongst themselves and Sarah goes outside to the nearby creek when the shark appears. She runs off but the shark is able to burrow through the mud and bites her leg off. She bleeds out crawling back to the house and Michelle finds her body outside. They discover her severed leg nearby with a shark‚Äôs tooth embedded in it, when suddenly two geologists, Professor Orville and his assistant John, emerge from the trees saying their car was destroyed by a land shark. The geologists theorize that nearby explosions and fracking opened a ‚Äúsuperhighway‚Äù between Earth‚Äôs surface and an underground ocean, releasing a predator capable of hunting on land and in water. They try to make it to the van but the shark tunnels through the dirt forcing them back inside the house. Michelle at this time conveniently uncovers a secret stash of assault weapons in the house and everyone takes a gun. Outside, they discover there are several sharks now but spot a cave entrance off the back of the property. They use some of their ammunition‚Äôs gunpowder to create a makeshift bomb with clothes they soak in some blood Carl volunteers. This creates a distraction for them to run to the cave. When Orville sprains his ankle, John sacrifices himself so Carl and Honey can help the professor. Detectives Kendra and Adam arrive at the cabin but are attacked by the sharks and are forced to drive off. Inside the cafe, the others hear the sharks communicating the same way as whales. They discover a shaft of daylight and resolve to use a blow up raft they have to cross it when Orville gets eaten by a shark. In pairs, they make it across the water. Honey and Anita are the last to cross and Anita decides to shoot at Carl, Shannon, and Michelle as they are nearing the shore which causes her to lose her balance and fall into the water. Sharks attack, eating her and Honey while Shannon is struck by one of Anita‚Äôs bullets and killed. Carl allows Michelle to leave. The detectives, who found maps of the cave somehow online, drive up to the exit where Carl is standing and they ask about the prisoners and Carl reports them all as dead. Kendra, at this point is obsessing over \\"land sharks\\" and asks if Carl knows what they‚Äôre up against and he nods. The final scene shows Honey crawling out from the water, having survived the shark attack before looking at the camera to deliver her catchphrase ‚Äúcrap on a cracker‚Äù. ==Cast== *Skye McDonald as Sarah Mason - Prisoner 366429 \\"Aggravated assault, armed robbery, & resisting arrest\\" *Christine Nguyen as Michelle Alika - Prisoner 5678672 \\"Bootlegging videos & inter-state flight\\" *Amy Holt as Shannon Hastings - Prisoner 9328940 \\"Assault & battery\\" *Tabitha Marie as Samantha Pines - Prisoner 5678672 \\"Drug trafficking & possession\\" (Samantha and Michelle are introduced having the same prisoner numbers) *Cindy Lucas as Anita Conners - Prisoner 2983747 \\"Prostitution & drug trafficking\\" *Dominique Swain as Honey - Anita's girlfriend *Traci Lords as Detective Kendra Patterson *Corey Landis as Detective Adam *John Callahan as Corrections Officer Carl *Serafin Falcon as Corrections Officer Mike - his uniform badge reads \\"V.

The movie was made at Caverns State Park, and Wynorski enjoyed the location so much that he later used it for CobraGator. The film had a Kickstarter campaign to raise production funds, however at the campaign's end on September 27, 2013, it had only raised $598. In an interview from 2013, director Jim Wynorski stated his disdain for crowd funding, saying this of the kickstarter: \\"I was forced to try it recently, but I knew in my heart it was going to be a useless venture‚Ä¶.which it was.\\" Release On May 3, 2016, Sharkansas Women's Prison Massacre was released on DVD and Blu-ray. The Blu-Ray comes with a feature-length commentary with Jim Wynorski and actresses Cindy Lucas, and Amy Holt, where they share anecdotes from the film's production. It was distributed by Shout! Factory under their Scream! Factory brand. ==Reception== The B-Movie Film Vault gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars in a review from around the film's release in 2016. The review states enthusiasm for combination of the two subgenera derived from the title, \\"women in prison films\\" and \\"killer shark films\\", although states \\"unfortunately, this movie failed to meet my (not so lofty) expectations\\". The review goes on to say that the effects and story are lacking despite the presence of some established actors like Traci Lords and Corey Landis (who's inclusion in the movie, this reviewer concludes, serves no purpose other than to pad the total runtime) and that it could have been \\"a hugely entertaining exploitation flick, but it just plays things way too safe\\". Cinema-Crazed.com gave the film a mostly negative review saying \\"the consistent utterance of Dominique Swain‚Äôs character to herself of ‚ÄúCrap on a Cracker,‚Äù just about sums up Jim Wynorski‚Äôs latest turkey that mixes ‚ÄúCon Air‚Äù and ‚ÄúTremors.‚Äù The review also references the inclusion of Traci Lords and Corey Landis' characters provide \\"zero purpose to the overall arc, save for some odd moments\\". Despite the scattered and confusing plot, ultimately the review argues the film is \\"a short and sweet piece of trash with endless eye candy\\". HorrorNews.net did not recommend the film in their review from 2016. The review states that Jim Wynorski was once reliable when it came to delivering \\"a good B-movie; pure unpretentious fun ‚Äì no strings attached\\" however, he failed to do so with Sharkansas. They argue the film's outrageous title leads the viewer to expect \\"Piranha 3D, but with bigger, meaner fish\\", but this is sorely misleading. The review makes note of Wynorski's history in pornographic films and the inclusion of multiple adult film actresses and points out the lack of exploitative nudity (often found in prison films) and violence (with less than 6 victims) as reasons the movie doesn't live up to its title. The \\"worst part\\" was the film's open ending meaning a likely inevitable sequel. CultureCrypt.Com provided an in depth review of the film that initially cites the film's failed Kickstarter campaign as foreshadowing for the disappointing final product. The review also acknowledges continuity errors such as using Mike's name tag inexplicably reading \\"V. Ghambari\\" and describes the script as \\"functional, or, as functional as is required to constitute a basic movie\\". This review also points out the unnecessary Lords and Landis subplot that \\"conspicuously as well as somewhat hilariously, never intersects with the women inmates at all\\". The reviewer concludes that \\"for movies like Sharkansas Women‚Äôs Prison Massacre, a ‚ÄúDoes It Really Matter?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat Do You Expect?‚Äù icon ought to be used instead of stars or a numerical rating system\\" but ultimately awarded it a 50/100. ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Trailer at Dread Central *Review at Culture Crypt Category:2016 films Category:2016 horror films Category:2010s prison films Category:2016 science fiction action films Category:2010s science fiction horror films Category:American films Category:American direct-to-video films Category:American prison films Category:American science fiction action films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:CineTel Films films Category:Films directed by Jim Wynorski Category:Films about shark attacks Category:Massacre (franchise) Category:Women in prison films ","title":"Sharkansas Women's Prison Massacre"},{"id":"54203653","text":"Cerovo (, ) is a village in the municipality of ≈Ωelino, North Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 511 inhabitants.

In the first step of this formation squalene is cyclized with molecular oxygen, FAD, and NADPH via the enzyme squalene epoxidase a flavoprotein to yield (2S)-2,3-oxidosqualene. In the second step if the oxidosqualene is folded in the chair conformation in the enzyme a cascade of cyclizations will occur that results in the formation of the dammarenyl cation. The dammarenyl cation is then subjected to an alkyl shift to create a six-membered ring and relieving ring strain to form the baccharenyl cation. This allows the baccharenyl double bond to attack the secondary positive charge and forms a pentacyclic ring system to yield the tertiary lupanyl cation. A Wagner-Meerwein 1,2-alykl shift will occur to form the hexacyclic ring system and the secondary oleanyl cation. This is followed by a Wagner-Meerwein 1,2-methyl shift to create the tertiary taraxasteryl cation. This cation is the last intermediate in the taraxasterol pathway. An E2 reaction follows where deprotonation of a proton yields taraxasterol.

It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ==Early history and creation== The early chalk study of the two students Labille-Guiard was born in Paris on 11 April 1749, the youngest of eight children. She grew up in a neighbourhood of artists and, on her own initiative, began painting and receiving training from them. She began to take students of her own in 1780. They were all female, and she was an advocate for women's involvement in painting. Labille-Guiard spent time planning this painting and there is a chalk study by Labille-Guiard of the two heads of her students where she investigates the closeness of the students heads and the effect of the light. The figure on the left, Marie-Gabrielle Capet, was one of the most talented students and Labille-Guiard's favourite. She lived with the artist even after Labille-Guiard married her first teacher's son, the painter Fran√ßois-Andr√© Vincent. The painting shows Labille- Guiard in a gown and straw hat and she depicts the materials complexity and the reflection of the dress in the parquet floor. The arrangement of the students heads shows her skill in presenting the interplay of light between their faces. The students are less formally dressed, and in the background are statues of a vestal virgin and a bust of the artist's father. The finished painting is almost life-size and it has been speculated that the artist and one of the pupils are looking at a mirror. In this case Labille-Guiard is actually painting the very painting the observer sees. ==Later history and display== The painting remained the property of the family of the artist until 1905. It was donated in 1953 to The Met by Julia Berwind. ==Description and interpretation== The work depicts Ad√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard, Marie-Gabrielle Capet and Marie-Marguerite Carreaux de Rosemond. It has been argued that the painting was aimed at the Acad√©mie Royale. Labille-Guiard aspired to become a member, and at the time, the Acad√©mie Royale limited female new members to four per year. Illustrating two female students argued that more should be accepted into the Acad√©mie Royale. ==Influences== The structure of the painting with the easel at left suggests that she may have based her composition on Antoine Coypel's Portrait of the Artist with his Young Son, Charles Antoine. This was an important painting in establishing the artists reputation. She was given an allowance by the King but because of her students she was not given a studio. This painting is thought to have been the basis for Jean-Laurent Mosnier's painting of himself with his young daughters. It is thought that his ambition was to clone the success of this painting. The painting has been used for book covers and it is a standard image for many histories of art. It is said to be earliest known picture of a woman painter with female pupils. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Portraits of women Category:Self- portraits Category:1785 paintings Category:18th-century portraits Category:Portraits by French artists Category:French paintings Category:Paintings about painting ","title":"Self-Portrait with Two Pupils"},{"id":"54204070","text":"Astartea middletonii is a shrub endemic to Western Australia.

Centered on the town common with its church and old town hall, it includes a diversity of residential architecture from the 18th to early 20th centuries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. ==Description and history== The town of Enfield was settled in the 17th century and incorporated in 1683. Enfield Street, now designated United States Route 5, has from an early date been the principal north-south route just east of the Connecticut River, set on a ridge above its flood plain. Lots were laid out as strips of land from the road to the river, with houses located near the road and the rest used for agriculture. This land use pattern persisted into the 20th century, generally avoiding commercial development. The result is a landscape of primarily residential architecture extending across three centuries, with central cluster of civic buildings. The historic district is essentially linear, running along Enfield Street for from Connecticut Route 190 in the north to the junction of Old King Street and Oliver Road in the south. Residential architecture predominates in the district, with wood frame houses 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 stories in height. Stylistically they are diverse, although layout and spatial arrangement are fairly consistent. The most elaborate house is that of Orrin Thompson, at the southeast corner of Enfield Street and South Road; it is a large brick Greek Revival house built in 1832 for the founder of Enfield's carpet-making businesses. It overlooks the town's 17th-century parade ground, near which also stand the 1848 Congregational Church, and the former town hall, both of which are also in the Greek Revival. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Georgian architecture in Connecticut Category:Victorian architecture in Connecticut Category:Historic districts in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Enfield, Connecticut ","title":"Enfield Historic District"},{"id":"54204098","text":"Magnus Warming (; born 8 June 2000) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a forward or winger for Lyngby BK. ==Club career== Br√∏ndby IF Warming joined Br√∏ndby IF from Nyk√∏bing FC in June 2015 at the age of 15.Nyk√∏bing-talent tr√¶der ind i Br√∏ndby Masterclass, brondby.com, 9 June 2015 Magnus Warming made his Br√∏ndby IF debut at the age of 16 years and 348 days as the youngest player ever in the club history when he was brought on for the final ten minutes in the 3‚Äì0 away defeat against S√∏nderjyskE on 21 May 2017.

Mih√°ly II was the fourth child and the eldest son in the family. He started his military career as captain of Div√©ny Castle (today in Div√≠n, Slovakia), subordinated to Count Imre Balassa, who served as Captain-General of N√≥gr√°d Castle and was the richest landowner in N√≥gr√°d County. In that capacity, Libercsey permanently represented his lord in the county court (sedria) in cases of border disputes between Balassa and Count √Åd√°m Forg√°ch, the lord of G√°cs (today Haliƒç, Slovakia). Count Balassa was notorious for his crimes and plundering attacks against his neighbors. Libercsey left his lord and joined to the court of Forg√°ch in 1656. His younger brother Ferenc (1622‚Äì1661) remained a partisan of Balassa. ==Career== Caste of G√°cs/Haliƒç (today in Slovakia) From October 1656, Libercsey functioned as captain (or castellan) of G√°cs Castle until his death. He was commissioned by Forg√°ch to renovate Somosk≈ë Castle in that year (today the castle is situated in Slovakia, while the settlement remained in Hungary after the Treaty of Trianon, and now it is part of Salg√≥tarj√°n). During the first period of his captaincy, he had several jurisdictional conflicts with steward J√°nos Szelcs√©nyi (died 1660). Libercsey also served as vice-isp√°n of N√≥gr√°d County from 1659 to 1666. He held the office alone in 1659 and alongside P√©ter P√°pay from 1660 to 1664, alongside P√°l N√©methy from 1664 to 1665, and finally, alongside J√°nos Mad√°ch until 1666. Libercsey submitted his resignation citing illness in 1666, but √Åd√°m Forg√°ch, who was also isp√°n or Lord Lieutenant of N√≥gr√°d County, persuaded him to remain in office. However, even, Libercsey did not appear in contemporary records as vice-isp√°n after that. Caste of Div√©ny/Div√≠n (today in Slovakia) Forg√°ch's long-time rival Imre Balassa besieged G√°cs Castle on 21 March 1666, gathering his soldiers, hajd√∫s and even forcibly conscripted serfs from the surrounding lands. Libercsey also had personal conflict with his former lord, who constantly plundered his estate of Podhradja. As vice-isp√°n, Libercsey filed the charges against Balassa to the tribunal of Ferenc Wessel√©nyi, Palatine of Hungary in 1665. Balassa was sentenced for 32 counts of violation of law against his neighbours, and was imprisoned in Pressburg Castle (today in Bratislava, Slovakia). However, by the end of year, he escaped from prison and barricaded himself into his castle in Div√©ny, few kilometers to G√°cs. Historian Emma Iv√°nyi argued Balassa's motivation to the siege was a personal revenge against Libercsey and his son-in-law J√°nos Mad√°ch, the second vice-isp√°n during that time. After the siege, the Garamszentbenedek Abbey (today Hronsk√Ω Be≈àadik, Slovakia) reconstructed the events through 70 witnesses (much of them were relatives of Libercsey). According to the reports, the unorganized assault troops broke the gate and entered the exterior castle. The besiegers looted the manors, stables and warehouses. Following that the marauders left G√°cs and returned to Div√©ny. As representative of N√≥gr√°d County, Libercsey sent a letter to Forg√°ch on 22 July 1666, who resided in Vienna, which contained his report and the county's complaint. ==Personal life== Libercsey married Zs√≥fia F√∂ldv√°ry de Bern√°thfalva, a daughter of nobleman Gy√∂rgy F√∂ldv√°ry (1579‚Äì1635) and Anna Bene de N√°ndor (died 1626). Their wedding took place in 1638. The couple had ten children, but most of them died in childhood. As he had no legitimate sons at the time of his death, Mih√°ly II became the last male member of the Libercsey family, which origin traced back to the 14th century. After his first wife died on 7 February 1665, Libercsey re-married to Anna Aranyady (died 1677), the widow of Gy√∂rgy Zmesk√°l, in 1667. Their marriage remained childless. Libercsey and Zs√≥fia F√∂ldv√°ry had the following children, according to the family's preserved birthday diary: #G√°bor (8 September 1639 ‚Äì 23 May 1649) #Zsuzsanna (11 March 1641 ‚Äì 1696 or 1697). She married Gy√∂rgy Bezegh on 2 July 1656. They had a daughter √âva Bezegh, who married Kuruc brigadier J√°nos Sr√©ter. Zsuzsanna's husband was tortured and executed by the Executive Court of Eperjes (today Pre≈°ov, Slovakia) on 14 May 1687. #Borb√°la (16 June 1643 ‚Äì 26 November 1652) #Anna (29 November 1645 ‚Äì 19 February 1713). She married J√°nos Mad√°ch (1619 ‚Äì 19 February 1669), vice-isp√°n of N√≥gr√°d County, on 20 April 1664. After his death, Anna married J√°nos Dobay, also vice-isp√°n. They had two daughters (Borb√°la, Krisztina) and a son, L√°szl√≥ who later also became vice-isp√°n of the county. Anna was the last person who bore the Libercsey surname when she died. #Krisztina (19 June 1649 ‚Äì 2 January 1651) #M√°ria (6 September 1651 ‚Äì 26 April 1653) #Rozina (20 October 1656 ‚Äì 1702).

He has published several books, the best known of which is Man From Arltunga: Walter Smith, Australian Bushman as well as more than 100 articles and essays. Kimber is also a Member of the Order of Australia. ==Early life== Kimber was born at Freeling in South Australia in 1939. He went to school in the Riverland area and Brighton and then attended Adelaide University and Adelaide Teacher‚Äôs College. ==Career== Throughout Kimber‚Äôs career, his focus has been on historical research, Aboriginal art and culture, and wildlife. He has published several books, the best known of which is Man From Arltunga: Walter Smith, Australian Bushman. He has also published over 100 articles and essays. He has also given public lectures and made regular media appearances. Kimber moved to Alice Springs in 1970 and taught English, history, social science and Aboriginal Studies at Alice Springs High School. In 1974 he became the first Sacred Sites Officer in the Northern Territory for the Sacred Sites Authority, before returning to teaching. From 1976 to 1978 he was the Papunya Tula Artists Coordinator and devised Aboriginal Studies materials for schools, after which he again returned to teaching. Beginning in 1976 Kimber undertook research and prepared submissions for land rights and native title claims for over twenty years, in a private capacity and for the Central Land Council and Ngaanyatjarra Council. During this time he also undertook research for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Studies, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Australian Heritage Commission and the Strehlow Research Centre, regarding locations of Aboriginal homelands and their needs, settlement history, and ownership of sacred objects. He researched the historical records of extinct and rare native fauna for the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory and provided advice regarding the development of the Alice Springs Desert Park and issues relating to Aboriginal land ownership of various parks and reserves. From the mid-1990s, Kimber advised the National Museum of Australia, Museum Victoria and the Northern Territory Museum regarding Aboriginal artefacts and cultural practices, access to Papunya Tula paintings that incorporated sacred elements, and the return of sacred objects to traditional custodians in central Australia. He continues to consult for Museum Victoria is association with the Strehlow Research Centre. Since arriving in Central Australia Kimber has undertaken travels, discussions and other shared experiences with many Aboriginal people, primarily in the south-western Simpson Desert, western deserts of Central Australia and the deserts of Western Australia through to the Canning Stock Route, and in Alice Springs. He has privately researched significant historical figures in inland Australia, Australian language usage, and native fauna of the inland including birds, and made important contributions to the Australian Language Dictionary, the Australian Dictionary of Biography and the Northern Territory Dictionary of Biography. The National Library of Australia has established the RG Kimber Collection for his correspondence and records. Kimber was awarded an Order of Australia in 2001 for \\"services to the community through research projects and the recording of information of national interest in the areas of history, anthropology, Aboriginal art, ecology and land management practices in Central Australia\\". Kimber was awarded a Doctor of Letters, Honoris Causa from the Charles Darwin University in 2006. ==Personal life== Kimber married to scientist Margaret Friedel in 1980.

As retinal eccentricity increases, the observer is slower and less accurate to detect an item they are searching for.Carrasco, M., Evert, D.L., Chang, I., & Katz, S.M. (1995). The eccentricity effect: Target eccentricity affects performance on conjunction searches. Perception & Psychophysics, 57(8), 1241-1261 Visual search tends to be better (faster and more accurate) when the target is presented closest/more centrally to the fovea, and worsens when the target is further in the periphery of the retina. This effect was first confirmed in research by Carrasco, Evert, Chang, and Katz in 1995., and was replicated by Wolfe, O'Neill and Bennet in 1998 == Etymology == The word eccentric comes from the Greek ekkentros meaning ‚Äúout of the center‚Äù.Online Etymology Dictionary, ‚Äòeccentric‚Äô. http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=eccentric == Mechanisms ==  Visual explanation  When we view an image, light passes through the cornea, and through the pupil, which is controlled by the iris. It then passes through the lens and is projected onto the retina at the back of the eye. In the middle of the retina is the fovea, which contains a high concentration of cones. Cones are responsible for colour vision and have high spatial acuity, whereas rods are not. Rods are instead responsible for vision at lower light. Cones are much more sparsely located in the periphery of the retina, where there is instead a greater concentration of rods. When a central image is projected directly onto the fovea it is sharper and processed with greater speed and accuracy due to these cones, whereas images further in the periphery (greater eccentricity) are processed more slowly and less accurately.'Vision - Retinal Eccentricity' \\"http://science.jrank.org/pages/7223/Vision-Retinal- eccentricity.html\\"American Optometric Association. 'How your eyes work'. https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/resources-for-teachers/how-your-eyes- work?sso=yRods and Cones https://www.cis.rit.edu/people/faculty/montag/vandplite/pages/chap_9/ch9p1.html Cortical magnification is one such visual explanation and is referring to the variance of the number of neurons that exist in the visual cortex, which are responsible for processing a visual stimulus. This number of neurons varies according to the location of the stimulus in the visual field.Cohen, R.A. (2011). Cortical Magnification. Encyclopedia of Clinical Neuropsychology. 718-719. This accounts for the greater spatial acuity at the centre of the fovea compared to that at the periphery, and can sometimes be counteracted through M scaling ‚Äì where stimulus size is adjusted according to its location. Staugaard, Petersen and Vangkilda (2016) wanted to see if cortical magnification could explain the eccentricity effect. They adjusted the size of their experiment stimuli according to the cortical magnification factor (through M scaling) and found no effect of cortical magnification which could fully explain the eccentricity effect.Staugaard, C.F., Petersen, A., & Vangkilda, S. (2016). Eccentricity effects in vision and attention. Neuropsychologia, 92, 69-78. Bao et al. (2013) also tested to see if cortical magnification was responsible for the eccentricity effect of inhibition of return (IOR). Inhibition of return is an orientation mechanism which refers to the ‚Äúrelative suppression of stimuli that had recently been the focus of attention‚Äù.[10] An eccentricity effect can also be seen in IOR i.e. there is a stronger IOR effect in the periphery, and Bao et al. wanted to see if cortical magnification was responsible for this. They tested their participants with different sized stimulus at two peripheral locations (scaling for the size of the location) to account for cortical magnification. Their results indicated that scaling of the stimulus size did not change the eccentricity effect of IOR and therefore cortical magnification is not responsible for this.Bao, Y., Lei, Q., Fang, Y., Tong, Y., Schill, K., P√∂ppel, E., & Strasburger, H. (2013). Inhibition of return in the visual field: The eccentricity effect is independent of cortical magnification. Experimental Psychology, 60(6), 425-431 The results from Staugaard, Petersen and Vangkilda, and Bao et al. suggest that the potential visual explanation of cortical magnification is not an explanation for the eccentricity effect.  Attentional explanation  Another explanation for the eccentricity effect is that of the guided search model. This model posits that when an individual is carrying out a visual search task, their attention is deployed to one item at a time. The order of this attention depends on the activation of the item ‚Äì the item receives more activation if it shares similar features with the target. In the case of eccentricity, the item/s that is/are closest to the target i.e. less eccentric, will receive more activation; and items further away i.e. those that have greater eccentricity, will receive less activation, and therefore processing for these will be slower and less accurate.Wolfe, J.M., O‚ÄôNeill, P., & Bennet, S.C. (1998). Why are there eccentricity effects in visual search? Visual and attentional hypotheses. Perception and Psychophysics, 60(1), 140-156. == Variables influencing the effect ==  Target orientation  Carrasco, Evert, Chang and Katz (1995) found that for vertical targets there was a more pronounced eccentricity effect than tilted targets, but only for single feature searches. When the search was a conjunction search, i.e. target has more than one feature, there was no difference between tilted versus vertical targets.  Display duration  Carrasco, Evert, Chang and Katz‚Äôs 1995 research also included a free-viewing, fixed-viewing and fast- fixed-viewing condition. Free-viewing means that display was present until observers responded; fixed-viewing means that display was only present for 104msec, and finally fast-fixed means that the display was only present for 64msec. They found a main effect for display duration that performance is slower for the free-viewing than fixed-viewing conditions, but that accuracy decreased more in the fast-fixed than fixed viewing condition, while fixed- viewing was marginally less accurate than free-viewing. This indicates a main effect of eccentricity on accuracy across different display duration's, and indicates that the impact of the eccentricity effect on accuracy decreases when observers have longer to respond.  Visual search type  Carrasco, Evert, Chang and Katz (1995) also found a more pronounced eccentricity effect in conjunction searches (these are targets which are defined by more than one feature), compared to single feature searches. This effect is more pronounced in larger set sizes. Wolfe, O‚ÄôNeill and Bennet (1998) attempted to replicate these findings in a similar style conjunction search task, using colour x orientation, with either a single (red and vertical) or two target (red and vertical or green and horizontal) condition. They found eccentricity effects for both the single and two target conditions, of which the effect was larger for the two target condition i.e. performance was slower and less accurate ‚Äì lending further support to Carrasco, Evert, Chang and Katz‚Äôs 1995 findings.  Set size  Carrasco, Evert, Chang and Katz (1995) observed increasing eccentricity effects in larger set sizes throughout their experiments. Wolfe, O‚ÄôNeill and Bennet (1998) also investigated the effect of set size x eccentricity. They found that with a set size of 1, the eccentricity effect remained similar at different eccentricities, however when the set size was greater than 1 the eccentricity effect grew for greater eccentricities. == References == Category:Vision ","title":"Eccentricity effect"},{"id":"54204167","text":"Jolanta the Elusive Pig () is a 1945 Swedish comedy film directed by Hugo Bolander, Oscar Winge and starring Winge, Ninni L√∂fberg and Thor Mod√©en .Waldekranz p.789 It is a remake of the 1934 German film Trouble with Jolanthe. ==Cast== * Oscar Winge as Jeppsson * Ninni L√∂fberg as Karin Jeppsson * Thor Mod√©en as Police constable * Fritiof Billquist as Pilgren * Torsten Lilliecrona as Folke Lindgren * Harry Persson as Valdemar M√•nsson * Carin Swensson as Hanna J√∂nsson * Per Bj√∂rkman as Svensson * Algot Larsson as S√∂ren == References  Bibliography == * Rune Waldekranz.

The task of the bonsai display table is to present the bonsai higher than the given surface, which gives the bonsai an additional charm, grace and formality as well as a stronger character, but also to improve the angle of view on the tree. Traditional asian bonsai display tables are mostly made from dark woods such as rosewood or walnut, which are almost exclusively painted with a dark satin-finish glaze. == Selection == The size and appearance of the bonsai display table should be selected in such a way, that it complements both the tree and its pot, without attracting much attention. In addition to the table size, the execution of the table legs - if appropriate - must be considered. These should be able to bear the weight of the bonsai convincingly and preferably not compete with the thickness of the trunk. Bonsai pots should not protrude at any side of the table and should not compete with the table in their layout. In general, the table should be about 1/3 larger than the bonsai pot.Chye Tan: The Spirit of Bonsai Design - Combine the Power of Zen and Nature. London, Collins & Brown Ltd. (2003), pp. 140-142 Flat bonsai display tables with rectangular tabletops are usually selected. Bonsai in cascade- style and semi-cascade-style are generally presented on higher tables with a square or round tabletop. Shohin bonsai are often shown in small groups on specially produced presentation shelves - a special form of the display table. In order to integrate the impression of a landscape image around the bonsai into the presentation, especially for bonsai in the design forms of literati or Saikei, unevenly shaped rock slabs or wooden discs are used. == Use == Bonsai display tables are used in Japan in particular, and are usually found in the traditional Tokonoma, a niche dedicated to art. From this tradition, there are also some basic rules for the placement of bonsai on the table to be derived from, which are observed worldwide especially at exhibitions. At exhibitions, the presentation of a bonsai with its pot on a formal table has also become the standard. In the western world, however, there are also proponents of the fact that a table for bonsai presentation is a minimum standard in the home and garden, even outside of exhibitions.Peter Warren: Bonsai - techniques, styles, display ideas. Dorling Kindersley (2014) A disadvantage for the everyday use outside of exhibitions is the inability of almost all commercially available tables, to catch or deduce excess water, a particular problem as standing water leaves visible marks on wood surfaces, which in the long run damages the table and thus the presentation. == Positioning == Bonsai display tables are usually constructed symmetrically. In order to convey the aesthetics of the overall composition and to present their balance, the pot is generally placed in the middle on the Bonsai display table, creating a common symmetry axis through the pot and the table.Deborah R. Koreshoff: Bonsai - Its Art, Science, History and Philosophy. Portland, Timbren Press (1992), pp. 246-247 This is contrary to the general principle in the field of bonsai of avoiding symmetry, but is rather justified by the fact that the table would attract too much attention in case the pot is asymmetrically placed. It is assumed that the correct balance has already been achieved by the correct asymmetric placement of the tree in the pot, which means that the table should have no further role in the determination of the overall balance. The neutral position of the bonsai on the table can be seen as an efficient use of the available space, maximizing the harmony of the overall composition. In the traditional tokonoma, the table is not placed in the middle. In the overall show of the asymmetrical placement of both the tree in the shell and the table in the Tokonoma, anything other than the symmetrical placement of the bonsai on the table would be unharmonious. On a bonsai display table, besides the bonsai itself, accompanying plants are sometimes shown, which should be in the correct size to suite both the bonsai and the table. In the case of the use of an accompanying plant, the tree is generally placed sideways, in order to be able to present the composition of bonsai and accompanying plant harmoniously on the table. ==References== Category:Bonsai ","title":"Bonsai display table"},{"id":"54204275","text":"Obed Akwa in 2016 Lieutenant General Obed Boamah Akwa (born 20 June 1955) is a Ghanaian military officer and the current Chief of the Defence Staff of the Ghana Armed Forces.

Riise, c. 1870 Albert Heinrich Riise (11 September 1810 ‚Äì 18 October 1882), often referred to as A. H. Riise, was a Danish pharmacist, merchant and manufacturer of rum on Saint Thomas in the Danish West Indies. A brand of rum is still named A.H. Riise after him. Late in his life he returned to Denmark where Sankt Thomas Plads (St. Thomas Square) in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen is named after his former country house. He was the father of photographer Frederik Riise. == Early life and education== Riise was the son of skipper and merchant Jens Christian Riise (1773-1814) and wife Margrethe Elisabeth Krabbe (1779-1869). The father died at sea when his ship accidentally perished a storm. After schooling, Albert was apprenticed at the pharmacist in √Ür√∏sk√∏bing and from 1825-30 he continued at the pharmacist in F√•borg. He then traveled to Copenhagen, where he graduated in 1832. While still studying botany and chemistry, he worked at various pharmacies in the capital at the same time. ==Pharmacist on St. Thomas== Riise's pharmacy on Dronningensgade in Charlotte Amalie. AH Riise Certificate A long-cherished desire to get to the West Indies was fulfilled in 1838 when he managed to get the privilege as a pharmacist in the Danish West Indies. Upon arrival in Saint Thomas, he at first worked in a so-called doctor stall, driven by several doctors. The following year he established his own pharmacy in partnership with a doctor. In 1843, he was able to buy out the partner, so he became the sole owner of the pharmacy. It went well for Riise, the business grew, he travelled to the United States and Trinidad among others. Equipped with a large stock of all kinds of goods, especially pharmaceutical products, St. Thomas Pharmacy became known throughout the surrounding Caribbean islands as the place where anything one might need for any household was to be obtained. Riise had a lively interest in botany and with utilized Caribbean exotic plants and animal life for the preparation of pharmaceutical, cosmetic and alcoholic products. He collected a great deal of herpetological and other zoological specimens, which were sent to Copenhagen and other European museums. The Danish zoologists Johannes Theodor Reinhardt and Christian Frederik L√ºtken were preparing a great monograph on the amphibians and reptiles of the Danish West Indies and the wider Caribbean, much of it based on the extensive collections of Riise, unfortunately for them however, the young American Edward Drinker Cope found a number of Riise's (he thought the man was called R√ºse) specimens from the Danish West Indies of the species that they were in the process of describing which had been sent to America, and rushed to describe them for posterity himself, publishing his work in 1862 a week or two earlier than them, which necessitated a rash of last minute changes to their manuscript before it could be brought to the printers. == Manufacturer of rum == Advertisement for AH Riise double destilled bay rum Among other things Riise's Bay Rum (a bay rum is rum scented with oil of Pimenta racemosa) was strongly instrumental in Riise's later prosperity. Riise was also successful in the distillation and sale of bitters from the West Indies, which in the old days were used as a medicine for stomach ills and other hardships. Riise had great success with his West Indies rum, which was exported to several continents. Riise's rum was especially popular in the motherland of Denmark. His rum has been marketed under various trademarks including Old St. Croix Brand, Riise's Guava rum and A.H. Riise rum. A series of rum from the Caribbean attributed to Riise is still marketed by Dansk- Vestindisk Rom Kompagni. A company exploiting one of these trademarks was awarded a medal at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, after his death. == Back to Denmark == When there were epidemics of both cholera, yellow fever, and smallpox in 1868, the family decided to travel to Denmark for a year. However, when the year was over, they decided to stay. The pharmacy on St. Thomas was handed over to an assistant who married one of Riise's daughters. A son of this connection later became a pharmacist in √Ür√∏sk√∏bing. Albert Riise bought a villa at Frederiksberg All√©, which he named Sankt Thomas. When the villa was sold after Riise's death in 1882, it was transformed into an amusement park called St. Thomas. In addition, Albert Riise was director of the 'Bank of St. Thomas', and was appointed knight of Dannebrog, knight of the Swedish Order of Vasa, in 1868 for and in 1878 for Etatsr√•d. He is buried at Solbjerg Park Cemetery. A commemorative plaque has been set for him at his birthplace in √Ür√∏sk√∏bing. == Personal life == On January 27, 1842 in Frederiksted on St. Croix, he married Henriette Marie Worm (1821 - 1889). The couple had 13 children, including photographer Frederik Riise and pharmacist Valdemar Riise who was the proprietor of the pharmacy after him. == References External links== * Sl√¶gtsforskning p√• √Ür√∏ * AH Riise * Labels * Source * Source Category:1810 births Category:1882 deaths Category:Danish pharmacists Category:Danish drink distillers Category:Order of the Dannebrog Category:People from √Ür√∏ Municipality Category:People from the Danish West Indies ","title":"Albert Heinrich Riise"},{"id":"54204356","text":"Major General William Azure Ayamdo is the current Chief of Army Staff of the Ghana Army.

Vojko Obersnel, the 14th and incumbent mayor who has been in office since 2000, ran for a sixth consecutive four-year term, finishing in 1st place with 41,00% of the vote in the first round. However, as no candidate won an absolute majority of the vote in the first round, a second round of elections was held on 4 June 2017 between the two highest-ranked candidates in terms of popular vote: Vojko Obersnel of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia, and Hrvoje Boriƒá of the Croatian Democratic Union. Obersenel defeated Boriƒá by a wide margin in the run-off, taking 55,6% of the vote to Boriƒá's 42,7%. Turnout in the election was 36,7% in the first round and 28,4% in the second round. This was the third direct election for the mayor of Rijeka (simultaneously held with elections for all other county prefects and mayors in Croatia) since the popular vote method was introduced in 2009, as previously those officials had been elected by their county assemblies or city councils. On 2 June a large number of cultural workers and athletes signed a public letter of support to the SDP candidate and the current mayor Vojko Obersnel. In the letter they state that \\"Rijeka is an example of an inclusive European city, the capital of all kinds of freedoms, especially those of art\\" and that it is appropriate that Rijeka retains the title of European Capital of Culture.

Dailyatia and Camenella have distinct dorsal (symmetrical) and lateral (asymmetric) sclerite morphologies. The same has been asserted for Lapworthella even though that has not always been the common perception. It has been argued that Camenella, Kelanella and Lapworthella, assuming a slug-like anatomy, had an anterior 'head valve' followed by pairs of asymmetric valves running in pairs along their dorsal surface.Devaere, L. & Skovsted, C. B. New early Cambrian sclerites of ~Lapworthella schodakensis~ from NE Greenland: advancements in knowledge of lapworthellid taxonomy, sclerite growth and scleritome organization. Geol. Mag. (2016). doi:10.1017/S0016756816000698 The 'head valve' in Lapworthella - that is the bilaterally symmetric Morph A valve - is thought to have fused from two ontogenetically separate sclerites. Dailyatia has a similar double-mounded structure at the tip of its A type sclerites. Growth rings in all are marked out by prominent external ridges. == Taxonomy== Two families: Kennardiidae Laurie 1986: three sclerite morphs, one of which (conventionally termed the A morph) is bilaterally symmetrical, the other two occurring in sinistral and dextral variants. Includes Kennardia and Dailyatia, and questionably Shetlandia Lapworthellidae: sclerites occur in something of a morphological continuum, but essentially form a single type with a sinistral and dextral version, possibly with the anterior-most pair of sclerites fusing into a single bilaterally-symmetrical, dual-tipped sclerite.

As a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University and later New York University, he performed extensive research in the field of pediatric nutrition. He received the John Howland Award in 1966. ==Biography== L. Emmett Holt Jr., the son of the pediatrician Luther Emmett Holt, was born in New York in 1895. He graduated from Harvard University in 1916 and finished medical school at Johns Hopkins University in 1920. As a student at Johns Hopkins, he worked in William Henry Howell's laboratory and assisted in the research that led to the discovery of heparin. After graduating, he trained in pediatrics for a year at the Babies Hospital (now Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital) in New York City before returning to Johns Hopkins in 1922. Holt practiced pediatrics at Johns Hopkins for 22 years under the leadership of Edwards A. Park and John Howland. In 1943, he revised and published a new edition of his father's textbook Holt's Care and Feeding of Children. He left Johns Hopkins in 1944 and returned to New York City, where he was appointed director of pediatrics at Bellevue Hospital and chair of the pediatrics department at the New York University School of Medicine. In 1947, he organized the first International Congress of Pediatrics since the end of World War II; that same year, he was awarded the Order of the White Lion for recommending oral feeding as treatment during a Czechoslovak epidemic of diarrhea in children. His contributions to international pediatrics also earned him the Order of the Star of Jordan. Holt retired in 1960 and received the John Howland Award, the highest honor given by the American Pediatric Society, in 1966. He died in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, in 1974 at the age of 79. ==Research== Holt began his research career as a medical student. At Johns Hopkins, he studied calcium metabolism and its association with rickets. His main field of research was pediatric nutrition. His research into fat absorption in premature babies led to the development of a popular infant formula, while his studies on the nutritional requirements of infants provided data for parenteral nutrition regimes. He also studied fat emulsion as a method of intravenous nutrition, the treatment of maple syrup urine disease through diet control, and the human requirements for various B vitamins. Outside of nutrition, he also published research on topics including lead poisoning, leukemia, meningitis, eczema, and pertussis. ==References== Category:1895 births Category:1974 deaths Category:American pediatricians Category:American medical researchers Category:Johns Hopkins School of Medicine alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:New York University School of Medicine faculty Category:Physicians from New York (state) Category:Johns Hopkins Hospital physicians ","title":"L.

The marine park covers an area of and is assigned IUCN category IV. It is Australia's largest single marine park and is one of the world's largest protected areas. The Coral Sea Marine Park lies directly adjacent to and east of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. ==Conservation values== Species and habitat *Humpback whales during their annual migration along the east coast of Australia; *Nesting and inter-nesting sites for green turtles; *Breeding and foraging areas for multiple seabird species including noddies, terns, boobies, frigatebirds, and tropic birds; *White shark distribution and whale shark aggregation. *Transient populations of highly migratory pelagic species, including small fish schools, billfish, tuna and sharks. *The East Australian Current forms in the region and is considered a major pathway for mobile predators such as billfish and tunas. Black marlin undergo seasonal movements into the Queensland Plateau area. Bioregions and other features *Includes three Key Ecological Features: the reefs, cays and herbivorous fish of the Queensland Plateau and the Marion Plateau and the northern extent of the Tasmantid Seamount Chain. *Heritage values include several historic shipwrecks including three World War II shipwrecks from the Battle of the Coral Sea. *The reserve represents the full range of seafloor features found in the region, including numerous reefs ranging from Ashmore and Boot Reefs in the north of the region to Cato Island and surrounding reefs in the south. The reserve includes canyons, troughs and plateaux, including Bligh Canyon approximately 200 kilometres off the coast from Lockhart River and the Townsville Trough, which separates the Queensland and Marion Plateaux. The reserve extends into the deeper waters of the Coral Sea Basin in the north, and provides protection for the pinnacles of the northern extent of the Tasmantid seamount chain. *Six provincial bioregions, 94 depth ranges, and 16 seafloor types are represented in the reserve. ==History== The Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve was proclaimed in December 2013, and renamed as a 'Marine Park' in October 2017. The original management plan for the Coral Sea Marine Park was suspended before it came into effect on 1 July 2014. The plans, which cover the zoning and protection measures of the marine park, were later subject to review as part of a wider review into the Commonwealth Marine Reserves announced in 2012. On 1 July 2018 the management plan and protection measures came into effect for the first time. Under the new management plan, 'no take' zones in the marine park were reduced in area by approximately 53% compared to the original proposed zoning. Former reserves The Coral Sea Marine Park encompasses the former Coral Sea Conservation Zone, former Coringa-Herald National Nature Reserve and former Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve. ==Summary of protection zones== The Coral Sea Marine Park has been assigned IUCN protected area category IV.

She is remembered as being the first Danish woman to speak in public (from 1864). She expressed her ideas on women's emancipation in her writings and speeches and fought for better opportunities for women's education. ==Biography== Worm was born on 29 November 1825 in Hyllested near Randers, the daughter of Theodora Petrine Hjort (1800‚Äì81) and Peter Worm (1788‚Äì1865), the parish priest who was an ardent, politically minded patriot. He educated Pauline and her two younger sisters while his wife took care of the rectory. When she was only nine, she tried to persuade her uncle, the politician Lauritz la Cour, to have the law changed so that women could vote. In 1838, Worm was sent to the girls school in Randers where she stayed on to be a teacher. From 1847, she worked as a private tutor in Pr√¶st√∏. When Frederick VII came to the throne in 1848, she wrote a patriotic poem of praise for him which was published in the newspaper F√¶drelandet, providing evidence of her poetic talents. While in Pr√¶st√∏, she also wrote En Krands af ni Blade (1850), a poetry anthology, and De Fornuftige, a novel which was not published until 1857. In 1852, after spending a year in Copenhagen, she qualified as a headmistress and set up a school for 12 girls in Randers the following year. In 1857, she opened a larger school in Aarhus but as neither succeeded, she returned to her family home in Randers where she took in private pupils. After her mother died in 1881, she moved to Copenhagen where she was successful in having a proposal for a teaching diploma accepted. She also strove to have Danish school education concentrate more on the Danish language than on German. From 1864, she turned her attention to public speaking, making addresses on a variety of subjects on education and topics of current interest, including women's affairs and future developments for women. Her speeches also demonstrated her increasing concern for Danish patriotism and the teachings of N. F. S. Grundtvig. Pauline Worm died on 13 December 1883 in Copenhagen. ==Selected publications== * En Krands af 9 Blade, poetry (1850) * Fire Breve om Clara Raphael, letters (1851) * De Fornuftige.

The Crown Perfumery had been founded in 1872 and was granted the use of the royal crown by Queen Victoria, but had come upon hard times, with declining profits and a fall in the quality of its products. The first release by the newly purchased company was the Original Collection, which featured the fragrance pairs ‚Äò1872‚Äô, ‚ÄòX‚Äô, and ‚ÄòNo.1‚Äô. The new millennium brought a re-launch for this collection, along with the release of a new family of perfumes. This was the Private Collection, which consisted of the introduction of the ‚ÄòC‚Äô fragrance in 2010, the ‚ÄòV‚Äô fragrance in 2012 and the ‚ÄòL‚Äô in 2014. The release of the ‚ÄòV‚Äô perfume coincided with Christian being awarded an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2012 New Year Honours List. Later that year, a special bottle was presented to the Queen for her Golden Jubilee. Clive Christian Perfume now employs several hundred people and as of 2017, features more than 10 different perfumes on its site, including the newly launched Noble VIII pair. ==Purchases== In 2015, a majority stake in the company was bought for an undisclosed sum by a consortium that included the founders of Stagecoach and venture capitalist Jon Moulton: founder and manager of Better Capital. Christian retained a stake in the company and also became creative director, with former Molton Brown executive Amy Nelson-Bennett appointed chief executive.

Symptoms include pain, swelling, and a decreased ability to move the shoulder. Complications may include axillary nerve or axillary artery injury. The cause is generally a fall onto the arm or direct trauma to the arm. Risk factors include osteoporosis and diabetes. Diagnosis is generally based on X-rays or CT scan. It is a type of humerus fracture. A number of classification systems exist. Treatment is generally with an arm sling for a brief period of time followed by specific exercises. This appears appropriate in many cases even when the fragments are separated. Less commonly surgery is recommended. Proximal humerus fractures are common. Older people are most commonly affected. In this age group they are the third most common fractures after hip and Colles fractures. Women are more often affected than men. == Signs and symptoms == Typical signs and symptoms include pain, swelling, bruising, and limited range of motion at the shoulder. Deformity may be present in severe fractures, however, musculature may cause absence of deformity on inspection. Numbness over the outside part of the upper arm and deltoid muscle weakness may indicate axillary nerve injury. Symptoms from poor blood circulation in the arm is uncommon due to collateral circulation in the arm. ==Cause== Young adults without risk factors usually require significant trauma, such as in the setting of a motor vehicle collision. Older adults more commonly experience proximal humerus fractures after a fall from standing height.  Risk factors  People with increased risk of falls are more likely to have a proximal humerus fracture, as this is also the most common mechanism of injury. Osteoporosis increases the risk of proximal humerus fractures. == Pathophysiology == Anterior and posterior views of the proximal humerus with labeled bony landmarks and muscle insertion sites. The shoulder joint consists of the glenoid cavity of the scapula and the head of the humerus. It as an extremely mobile joint that is stabilized by surrounding soft tissues such as the joint capsule, muscles, and ligaments. The greater and lesser tuberosities are bony landmarks of the proximal humerus and serve as attachment sites for musculature. The anterior and posterior humeral circumflex arteries branch off of the axillary artery to provide the majority of the blood supply to the proximal humerus. The axillary nerve courses inferior to the shoulder joint and innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles. It also provides sensation at the skin overlying the shoulder. This nerve is the most commonly injured nerve in proximal humerus fractures due to its location close to the proximal humerus. Muscles that attach to the proximal humerus and can cause a deforming force on fracture fragments include the pectoralis major, the deltoid, and the rotator cuff muscles. == Diagnosis == The standard x-ray views of the shoulder include a true anterior-posterior view, a lateral (Y or outlet) view, and an axillary view. A Velpeau view can be done as an alternative to the axillary view if an examinee is unable to position the shoulder for an appropriate image. This can be obtained by having the examinee lean backward 45 degrees while an xray beam is aiming towards the floor. A CT scan of the injured shoulder can be done to help further characterize the fracture and determine articular involvement. CT scan is also an option if an axillary view is unattainable. MRI is not typically indicated in the setting of proximal humerus fracture, although it may be useful in assessing injury to soft tissue structures such as the rotator cuff muscles.  Classification  The Neer classification of proximal humerus fractures is the most commonly used classification system. It classifies fractures depending on the number of segments (2-4 parts), and whether or not there is displacement present. This classification has a low amount of agreement between physicians using the classification system, although formal training sessions may improve agreement. The AO/OTA classification system is another commonly used system that groups fractures depending on whether the fracture is unifocal or bifocal, and whether or not the fracture goes through the articular surface. == Treatment == There are both non-surgical and surgical options for treatment of proximal humerus fractures. The recommended treatment is decided based on fracture stability as determined with imaging and clinical exam.  Non-Surgical  Most proximal humerus fractures are stable and can be treated without surgery. Typical non-operative treatment consists of shoulder immobilization with a sling. Close follow-up and weekly x-rays are recommended in order to ensure that the fracture is healing and maintaining good alignment. Passive range of motion exercises for the shoulder can be done when pain has subsided. This can be done with the assistance of a physical therapist. When properly indicated, non-surgical treatment options for proximal humerus fractures have good outcomes in terms of fracture healing and restoration of arm function.  Surgical  Surgical options for unstable proximal humerus fractures include: * Closed reduction with percutaneous pinning (CRPP) * Open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) * Intramedullary rod fixation * Shoulder arthroplasty * Reverse shoulder arthroplasty == Epidemiology == Proximal humerus fractures account for approximately 4-7% of all fractures in adults. It is the most common fracture of the humerus, as well as the most common fracture at the shoulder girdle. They are more common in women than men, and occur more often in older adults. The average age of people who sustain a proximal humerus fracture is 63‚Äì66 years. == Special populations ==  Children  A proximal humerus fracture in a young child may be a sign of child abuse. In older children and adolescents proximal humerus fractures frequently occur in the setting of sports or trauma. Proximal humerus fractures in children can commonly be treated non-operatively due to the large amount of bone growth that occurs at the proximal humerus. In older children where there is less time for bone remodeling, surgery may be indicated more frequently. ==References== Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:Bone fractures Category:Injuries of shoulder and upper arm ","title":"Proximal humerus fracture"},{"id":"54204782","text":"Brigadier D.

The incident, which occurred a few days after the 1943 Detroit race riot, began when white Military Police (MPs) attempted to arrest several African American soldiers from the racially segregated 1511th Quartermaster Truck Regiment at Ye Old Hob Inn public house in Bamber Bridge. After the arrival of more military police armed with machine guns, Black soldiers armed themselves with rifles from their base armoury. Both sides exchanged fire through the night. One Black soldier was killed and several MPs and soldiers injured. A court martial convicted 32 African American soldiers of mutiny and related crimes. ==Background== During the Second World War, Bamber Bridge hosted American servicemen from the 1511th Quartermaster Truck regiment, part of the Eighth Air Force. Their base, Air Force Station 569 (nicknamed \\"Adam Hall\\"), was situated on Mounsey Road, part of which still exists now as home to 2376 (Bamber Bridge) Squadron of the Air Training Corps (or Air Cadets). The 1511th Quartermaster Truck was a logistics unit, and its duty was to deliver materiel to other Eighth Air Forces bases in Lancashire. The 234th US Military Police Company were also located in the town, on its north side. US Armed Forces were still racially segregated, and the soldiers of 1511 Quartermaster Truck were almost entirely Black, while all but one of the officers were white, as were the MPs. Military commanders tended to treat these service units as \\"dumping grounds\\" for less competent officers, and leadership in the unit was poor. Racial tensions were exacerbated by the riots in Detroit earlier that week which had led to 34 deaths, including 25 Black casualties. The people of Bamber Bridge supported the Black troops, and when American commanders demanded a colour bar in the town, all three pubs in the town reportedly posted \\"Black Troops Only\\" signs. ==Outbreak of violence== On the evening of 24 June, 1943 some soldiers from the 1511th Quartermaster Truck regiment were drinking with the English townsfolk in Ye Old Hob Inn. Two passing MPs, Corporal Roy A. Windsor and Private First Class Ralph F. Ridgeway, entered the pub and attempted to arrest one soldier (Private Eugene Nunn) upon seeing he was improperly dressed (in a field jacket rather than class A uniform). An argument ensued between the Black soldier and the white MPs, with local people and British servicewomen of the Auxiliary Territorial Service siding with Nunn. A British soldier challenged the MPs, saying ‚ÄúWhy do you want to arrest them? They‚Äôre not doing anything or bothering anybody.‚Äù Black Staff Sergeant William Byrd defused the situation but as the MPs left a beer was thrown at their jeep. After the MPs picked up two reinforcements, they spoke to Captain Julius F. Hirst and Lieutenant Gerald C. Windsor who told the MPs to do their duty and arrest the Black soldiers. A group of MPs intercepted the soldiers on Station Road as they returned to their base at Mounsey Road. A fight broke out in the road leading to shots being fired. One struck Private William Crossland in the back killing him. When some of the injured Black soldiers returned to their base, the killing caused panic as rumours began to spread that the MPs were out to shoot Black soldiers. Although the colonel was absent, acting CO Major George C. Heris did his best to calm the situation. Lieutenant Edwin D. Jones, the unit's only Black officer, was also able to persuade the soldiers that Heris would be able to round up the MPs and see that justice was done. However, at midnight, several jeeps full of MPs arrived at the camp, including one improvised armoured car armed with a large machine gun. This prompted Black soldiers to arm themselves with weapons. Around two-thirds of the rifles were taken, and a large group left the base in pursuit of the MPs. British police officers claimed that the MPs set up a roadblock and ambushed the soldiers. The Black soldiers warned the townspeople to stay inside when a firefight broke out between them and the MPs resulting in seven wounded. The shooting stopped around 4 a.m. the next morning. Eventually, the soldiers returned to the base, and by the afternoon all but four rifles had been recovered. ==Arrest and court martial== The violence left one man dead and seven people (five soldiers and two MPs) injured. Although a court martial convicted 32 African American soldiers of mutiny and related crimes, poor leadership and racist attitudes among the MPs was blamed as the cause. General Ira C. Eaker, commander of the Eighth Air Force, placed the majority of the blame for the violence on the white officers and MPs because of their poor leadership and the use of racial slurs by MPs. To prevent similar incidents happening again, he combined the Black trucking units into a single special command. The ranks of this command were purged of inexperienced and racist officers, and the MP patrols were racially integrated. Morale among Black troops stationed in England improved and the rates of courts-martial fell. Although there were several more racial incidents between Black and white American troops in Britain during the war, none were on the scale of Bamber Bridge. Reports of the mutiny were heavily censored, with newspapers only disclosing that violence had occurred in a town somewhere in North West England. The author Anthony Burgess, who lived in the Bamber Bridge area after the War, wrote about the event briefly in the New York Times in 1973 and in his autobiography, Little Wilson and Big God. Popular interest in the event increased in the late 1980s after a maintenance worker discovered bullet holes from the battle in the walls of a Bamber Bridge bank. ==Commemoration== In June 2013, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the incident, the University of Central Lancashire held a symposium. It included a screening of the 2009 documentary Choc‚Äôlate Soldiers from the USA which was produced by Gregory Cooke, and a performance of Lie Back and Think of America, a play written by Natalie Penn of Front Room that had played at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. ==References== Notes Citations Category:1943 in England Category:1943 riots Category:Battles involving Lancashire Category:June 1943 events Category:Mutinies Category:Race riots in England Category:Events that led to courts-martial Category:Military discipline and World War II ","title":"Battle of Bamber Bridge"},{"id":"54204872","text":"Chandrakanta ‚Äî Ek Mayavi Prem Gaatha (English: Moonlight - An Elusive Love Story) is an Indian supernatural fantasy television series which premiered on Colors TV on 24 June 2017 and ended on 16 June 2018.

The show is produced by Ekta Kapoor and directed by Ranjan Kumar Singh under the Balaji Telefilms banner. The series stars Madhurima Tuli, Urvashi Dholakia, and Vishal Aditya Singh. ==Plot== Chandrakanta Jai Singh (Madhurima Tuli)is born to Ratnaprabha (Shilpa Sakhlani), a great Ayyara (magician), who has the most powerful dagger of Lord Vishnu. Iravati Singh (Urvashi Dholakia), an evil queen wants the dagger to rule the whole world and conquers Vijaygarh. Ratnaprabha stores the dagger at Lord Vishnu's temple to protect it and pass it to Chandrakanta after 21 years.  21 years later  21 years later, Iravati is still searching the dagger while Veerendra \\"Veer\\" Pratap Singh (Vishal Aditya Singh), her step son plans to conquer Suryagarh kingdom. Chandrakanta (Madhurima Tuli), raised by a poor fisherman couple, gets the dagger, but she doesn't know of its powers. Iravati emotionally blackmails Veer that she is suffering from the effects of black magic performed on her by a girl with a dagger mark on her body. He goes to Suryagarh With his Lover Champa (Purvi Mundada) but later he initially, pretends to be a lover of Chandrakanta in order to take revenge but as time goes by, starts loving her. Veer and Chandrakanta start loving each other. In the end, Queen Iravati succeeds in separating Veer and Chandrakanta. Veer, unexpectedly stabs Chandrakanta with the dagger and she falls off the cliff without knowing the reason of the betrayal. One year later Chandrakanta returns as Suryakanta (Pooja Banerjee) to find out that Veer has forgotten about the time he has spent with her in the past and has become a ruthless warrior under Iravati as now she is the owner of the magical dagger. Veer eventually regains his memory and finds out the truth about his mother and Chandrakanta and then decides to oppose his mother. He fights off and defeats the demons sent by his mother and saves Chandrakanta on several occasions. He also fights his stepbrother Swayam (Shaad Randhawa), the beast and defeats him in quite a few occasions but is unable to kill him. Finally Veer finds out that Swayam is immortal as he is blessed by Lord Vishnu and then he gives up his life fighting the beast and protecting Chandrakanta. Chandrakanta then as advised by Lord Vishnu injects Swayam's blood in Veer's body and resurrects him. Meanwhile, Tej (Ajay Arya), Veer's friend, Umang (Nirmal Soni), Chandrakanta's friend and Bhadra Maa (Maleeka R Ghai) get captured and tortured by Iravati who is trying to find out Chandrakanta. After getting resurrected, Veer receives a new form of power in the form of Narsimha, a powerful Avatar of Lord Vishnu. Veer is the divine warrior and is chosen to put an end to the despotic rule of Queen Iravati and Swayam. Chandrakanta teaches Veer to control his new found powers and finally after a long fight Veer takes the form of the great Narsimha and kills Swayam and finally puts an end to the terror of Hirnasur. Iravati escapes and sorts the help of the \\"Asurs\\" from the Paatal Lok to defeat Veer. She returns with asurs but fails to defeat them. Meanwhile, Chandrakanta gives birth to a daughter, who is blessed to kill Iravati. Iravati attacks Veer and try to get Chandrakanta's daughter but Chandrakanta saves her. Instead when Iravati tries to grab Chandrakanta's daughter, she gets killed when she touches her. Chandrakanta and Veer name their daughter Suryakanta and establish peace and prosperity in Vijaygarh.

He was a member of Swimming Club Vraƒçar Belgrade, and was one of the fastest sprinters in his generation in Serbia. He competed in 50m butterfly, 50m and 100m freestyle. ==Career== Professional Career Stevanoviƒá after a race in Valjevo Luka Stevanoviƒá started his swimming career in 2004, in Swimming Club Belgrade, located on Ta≈°majdan swimming pool, under leadership of his coach Slavko Kurbanoviƒá, former Serbian Olympian who competed in 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. In the first few years at the club he was competing in breaststroke. During his time at the club his best results were quite average, despite his big talent. The main reason for that was that he was swimming breaststroke, a stroke that was not his natural. He left the club at year 2007. In April 2007 Stevanoviƒá made a move to swimming club Vraƒçar, based in Belgrade's municipality Vraƒçar. That proved to be a great move, since he started making progress really fast. His new coach, Nikola Mirƒçetiƒá, has changed his strokes to freestyle and butterfly, which proved to be his natural strokes. He started winning medals in almost every race he was competing in. The best year of his career was 2009. During that year Stevanoviƒá became Serbian vice champion in 50m butterfly, and was also 3rd in 50m freestyle on Serbian National Junior Championships. Besides that, he has won many medals on many important swim meets both in Serbia, and abroad. He was always champion of Belgrade in his strokes. In 2011, due to problems with spinal disc herniation he was forced to retire from competitive swimming.

Yuri Kachmazov was the group's president. The name SOK was originally an acronym for 'Samara Window Company'. ==History== The RosLada factory in 2005 The SOK Group started in 1994 as an AvtoVAZ dealership, growing to become one of the main automotive companies in Russia. SOK managed to gain control of RosLada, an automotive plant that had been established in 1998 on the grounds of the former Luch Design Bureau in Syzran, and used it to produce old AvtoVAZ models. In 1999 the ownership of the Izhmash-Avto plant in Izhevsk, which produced old AvtoVAZ models under the Izh brand, was transferred to the group. SOK also included over 40 other factories, mostly in the automotive component business, and employed over 100,000 workers. Revenues grew from $19 million in 1999 to close to $200 million in 2002. It was the second largest passenger car producer in Russia after AvtoVAZ, with production totaling 121,172 cars in 2002. In August 2003 VAZInterService became part of the group. By 2004 the group had $2 billion in revenues and supplied 37%-50% of all AvtoVAZ accessories; AvtoVAZ could not withdraw from such cooperation agreements without paying SOK $492 million in penalties. In October 2005 SOK reportedly owned over 60% of AvtoVAZ shares, and ousted Vladimir Kadannikov, the company's chairman. SOK group attempted to gain control of AvtoVAZ, which was instead gained by the state-owned Rostec corporation. The Rostec-appointed AvtoVAZ management began to phase out or rescind supply contracts between SOK and AvtoVAZ. In 2008, SOK began negotiations to sell the IzhAvto plant to AvtoVAZ. In 2009 the group was forced to sell its automotive components holdings to AvtoVAZ, after SOK had disrupted the schedule of deliveries to the company. The components business ultimately came under control of Rostec as the United Automotive Technologies group. In 2010 the president of the group, wanted over allegations of fraudulent conveyance during the IzhAvto bankruptcy of 2009, escaped to the United Arab Emirates.

All five countries have pursued public policies which focus on buffering the political and economic spheres from external shocks. This includes maintaining a trade balance, minimizing public debt and accumulating national reserves‚Äô. The republics cannot totally insulate themselves from negative exterior forces, however, such as the persistently weak recovery of global industrial production and international trade since 2008. Although both exports and imports have grown impressively over the past decade, the republics remain vulnerable to economic shocks, owing to their reliance on exports of raw materials, a restricted circle of trading partners and a negligible manufacturing capacity. Uzbekistan emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009, consistently recording economic growth of over 7% from 2007 onwards. The country is more or less self-sufficient in oil and natural gas and is a major exporter of cotton. Against a background of strong economic growth, the national development strategy is focusing on nurturing new high-tech industries and orienting the economy towards export markets. Whereas Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan have been members of the World Trade Organization since 1998, 2013 and 2015 respectively, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have adopted a policy of self-reliance. Symptomatic of this policy is the lesser role played by foreign direct investment in Uzbekistan. It contributed just 1.6% of GDP in 2015, after peaking at 4.2% of GDP in 2010. In Uzbekistan, the state controls virtually all strategic sectors of the economy, including agriculture, manufacturing and finance, foreign investors being relegated to less vital sectors like tourism. Funding for strategic economic sectors Uzbekistan's anti-crisis package for 2009‚àí2012 helped it to weather the financial crisis by injecting funds into strategic economic sectors. For the period to 2015, these sectors were the energy, oil and gas industries; the chemical, textile and automobile industries; non-ferrous metals; engineering; pharmaceuticals; high-quality processing of agricultural products; and construction materials. Each of these sectors tends to involve large companies equipped with design bureaux and laboratories. There are, however, also specialized state institutions which actively promote innovation. These include the Agency for Technology Transfer (since 2008), which transfers technology to the regions, the Scientific and Technical Information State Unitary Enterprise (since 2009) and the Intellectual Property Agency of Uzbekistan (since 2011).  Modernization of the economy  GDP in Central Asia by economic sector, 2005 and 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 14.2 Like its Central Asian neighbours, Uzbekistan has been modernizing the industrial sector and fostering the development of service industries through business-friendly fiscal policies and other measures, to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture dropped from 28% to 19% of GDP in Uzbekistan. One of these measures has been the creation, by decree, of free industrial zones (FIZ) to foster the modernization of all economic sectors. The Navoi region became the first FIZ in December 2008. It was followed by Angren in the Tashkent region in April 2012 and Djizak in the Sirdary region in March 2013. The enterprises established in these FIZ have already produced some inventions and are involved in public‚àíprivate partnerships through which they co-finance projects in innovation with the Fund for the Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan, set up in May 2006. == Science and technology ==  Research priorities  In 2012, the Committee for the Co-ordination of Science and Technology Development formulated eight priorities for research and development (R&D;) to 2020, based on the needs of industry. The first of these priorities is to construct an innovative economy by strengthening the rule of law. Innovation is perceived as a means of democratizing society in Uzbekistan. The ultimate goal of the ongoing legal reform is to harness innovation to solving socio-economic problems and enhancing economic competitiveness. The contours of a draft law on innovation and innovative activity were first outlined in the presidential decree of January 2011 devoted to deepening democratic reforms, including by strengthening the status of local representatives. This draft bill also sets out to create an effective mechanism for the testing, deployment and commercial development of promising scientific work. It outlines additional incentives and rewards for enterprises that develop innovative projects, especially in high-tech industries. In 2014, the draft law was subjected to public scrutiny to encourage debate. The second and third research priorities to 2020 concern energy and resource savings, as well as the development of renewable energy use. In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources, with funding from the Asian Development Bank and other institutions: the SPU Physical‚àíTechnical Institute (Physics Sun Institute) and the International Solar Energy Institute. Meanwhile, the Institute for Comprehensive Research on Regional Problems of Samarkand has been transformed into a problem-solving laboratory on environmental issues within Samarkand State University. This is part of a reform instituted by decree in February 2012 by the Cabinet of Ministers. In all, more than 10 institutions of the Academy of Sciences are being re-organized, in order to re-orient academic research towards problem-solving and ensure continuity between basic and applied research. Another institute affected by the reform is the Mathematics and Information Technology Research Institute, which has been subsumed under the National University of Uzbekistan. Information and communication technologies are one of the eight research priorities to 2020. According to the Thomson Reuters‚Äô database, Uzbek research in computer sciences generated just four papers in international journals between 2008 and 2014. The fifth research priority to 2020 encompasses agriculture, biotechnology, ecology and environmental protection and the sixth medicine and pharmacology. The seventh centres on chemical technologies and nanotechnologies and the eighth on Earth sciences, with a focus on geology, geophysics, seismology and raw mineral processing.  A new specialist university  Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.5 A new university specializing in ICTs opened its doors to students in October 2014. Inha University in Tashkent is the result of collaboration with Inha University in the Republic of Korea, on which its academic programmes will be modelled. Initially, 70 students were selected for the Department of Information and Communication Engineering and a further 80 for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. All lectures are being given in English.  Science-industry ties  The Uzbek national innovation system is still in its formative years. There is at best a tenuous relationship between science and industry and almost no commercialization of research results. State support (financial, material and technical) for innovation is provided directly to specific programmes and projects, rather than to the individual research institutions and hierarchical structures. One of the most effective elements of this approach is the principle of equity financing, which allows for a flexible combination of budgetary funds with funding from industry and the regions. This is designed to ensure that there is a demand for the research being undertaken and that the results will lead to products and processes. It also creates bridges between the public research sector and industrial enterprises.  Annual innovation fair  Researchers and industrialists can also discuss ideas at Uzbekistan's annual innovation fairs. Between 2008 and 2014, more than 2 300 contracts for experimental development were signed at these fairs for an investment of more than 85 billion Uzbek soms (UZS), equivalent to US$37 million. The products resulting from these contracts have ‚Äògenerated USS 680 billion (almost US$ 300 million), providing US$7.8 million in import substitution‚Äô, according to the report. One-quarter (26%) of the proposals vetted concerned biotechnologies, 19% new materials, 16% medicine, 15% oil and gas, 13% energy and metallurgy and 12% chemical technologies. == Research trends == Trends in research expenditure in Central Asia, as a percentage of GDP, 2001‚àí2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: 2030 (2015), Figure 14.3  Financial investment in research  In the region, research spending has hovered around the 0.2‚Äì0.3% mark for the past decade but, in 2013, Uzbekistan boosted its own commitment to 0.41% of GDP, distancing Kazakhstan on 0.18%. Not to be outdone, Kazakhstan has vowed to raise its own research effort to 1% by 2015, according to the State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development. The world average for research effort was 1.7% of GDP in 2013.  Investment in human capital   Education and training  Uzbekistan is generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. In December 2012, a presidential decree focused on improving proficiency in foreign languages, beginning with the 2013/2014 academic year. English teaching, in particular, will be introduced into secondary schools and certain university courses will be taught in English, especially engineering and specialized areas, such as law and finance, in order to foster international information exchange and scientific co-operation. In parallel, universities are to be given greater access to international multimedia resources, specialized literature, newspapers and magazines. In order to improve training, the Academy of Sciences created the first cross-sectorial youth laboratories in 2010, in promising fields such as genetics and biotechnology; advanced materials; alternative energy and sustainable energy; modern information technology; drug design; and technology, equipment and product design for the oil and gas and chemical industries. These fields were chosen by the academy to reflect the strengths of Uzbek science. The Academy of Sciences has also revived the Council of Young Scientists. In July 2012, a presidential decree abolished the system of Candidate of Science and Doctor of Science degrees inherited from the Soviet system, replacing it with the three- tier degree system consisting of bachelor's, master's and PhD degrees. Whereas those with a bachelor's degree used to be barred from postgraduate studies under the old system, they will now be able to apply for a course leading to a master's degree. This should incite young people to study science. In 2014, about 30% of the younger generation held no degree qualification at all.

The two most populous countries of Central Asia logically count the most researchers: just over 30 000 for Uzbekistan and 17 000 for Kazakhstan (in head counts), compared to a little over 2 000 for each of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. This corresponds to a researcher density of 1,097 (per million population in head counts) for Uzbekistan and 1,046 for Kazakhstan (in head counts), compared to a global average of 1,083 (in full-time equivalents). Women make up 41% of Uzbek researchers, one of the highest ratios in the world. This is a legacy of the former Soviet Union, which laid great store by education. Four in ten PhDs (42%) are held by women, a figure close to the global average (43%). Women are almost as present in engineering as in science, accounting for 30% of PhDs in scientific disciplines and 27% of those in engineering.

Almost all holders of a Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science or PhD are more than 40 years old and half are over the age of 60.

Even taking population into account, Kazakhstan's output is now much higher than that of its neighbour, with 36 articles per million inhabitants, compared to 11 for Uzbekistan. The majority of scientific papers focus on physics (35%) and chemistry (21%), a pattern also found in Kazakhstan. Since 2006, the rate of international collaboration has remained steady, at 60‚Äì64% of articles. Uzbek scientists collaborate mostly with their Russian counterparts but they also count German, American, Italian and Spanish scientists among their closest partners. In December 2013, Prof. Ibrokhim Abdurakhmonov from the Uzbek Centre of Genomics and Bioinformatics was named ‚Äòresearcher of the year‚Äô by the International Cotton Advisory Committee for a ‚Äògene knockout technology‚Äô‚Äô he had developed with biologists from the Texas A&M; University (USA) and the US Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Office of International Research Programs who had also provided much of the funding. The research done by Prof. Abdurakhmonov and his American partners could potentially have a multibillion-dollar impact on the global cotton industry and help cotton farmers fend off growing competition from synthetic fibres.

They are also members of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the CAREC 2020 Strategy, a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members‚Äô competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan border the Caspian Sea and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets. Uzbekistan is one of the four Central Asian republics that have been involved in a project launched by the European Union in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage Central Asian countries to participate in research projects within Horizon 2020, the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions ‚Äì universities, companies and research institutes ‚Äì for funding of up to ‚Ç¨10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops. ==Sources References == ","title":"Science and technology in Uzbekistan"},{"id":"54205050","text":"Science and technology in Turkmenistan examines government policies relative to the promotion of science, technology and innovation in Turkmenistan. == Socio-economic context == Turkmenistan has been undergoing rapid change ‚àí with little social upheaval ‚àí since the election of President Gurbanguly Berdimuhammadov in 2007 (re-elected in 2012), following the death of ‚Äòpresident for life‚Äô Sparamurat Niyazov. Turkmenistan has been moving towards a market economy ever since this policy was enshrined in the Constitution in 2008. In parallel, however, the government offers a minimum wage and continues to subsidize a wide range of commodities and services, including gas and electricity, water, wastewater disposal, telephone subscriptions, public transportation (bus, rail and local flights) and some building materials (bricks, cement, slate). GDP growth trends in Central Asia, 2000‚àí2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.1 Economic liberalization policies are being implemented gradually. Thus, as the standard of living has risen, some subsidies have been removed, such as those for flour and bread in 2012. Turkmenistan has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. By introducing a fixed exchange rate of US$1 to 2.85 Turkmen manat in 2009, the president caused the ‚Äòblack‚Äô foreign exchange market to disappear, making the economy more attractive to foreign investment. A fledgling private sector is emerging with the opening of the country's first iron and steel works and the development of a chemical industry and other light industries in construction, agro-food and petroleum products. Turkmen gas is now exported to China and the country is developing one of the largest gas fields in the world, Galkinish, with estimated reserves of 26 trillion m3 of gas. Avaz on the Caspian Sea has been turned into a holiday resort, with the construction of dozens of hotels which can accommodate more than 7 000 tourists. In 2014, some 30 hotels and holiday homes were under construction. The country has embarked on a veritable building boom, with the construction of 48 kindergartens, 36 secondary schools, 25 sports academies, 16 stadiums, 17 health centres, 8 hospitals, 7 cultural centres and 1.6 million m2 of housing in 2012 alone. Across the country, roads, shopping centres and industrial enterprises are all under construction. Turkmenistan's railway transport and metropolitan trains have been upgraded and the country is buying state-of-the-art aircraft. GDP in Central Asia by economic sector, 2005 and 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 14.2Schools around the country were being renovated in 2014, with 20-year old textbooks being replaced and modern multimedia teaching methods introduced. All schools, universities and research institutes are being equipped with computers, broadband and digital libraries. Internet has only been available to the public since 2007, which explains why just 9.6% of the population had access to it in 2013, the lowest proportion in Central Asia. Movement within the country has become easier with the removal of identity checkpoints ‚Äì at one time there were no fewer than 10 between Ashgabat and Turkmenabat. This development should facilitate the mobility of scientists around the country. == Research priorities ==  Twelve priority areas  President Berdimuhammadov is far more committed to science than his predecessor. In 2009, he restored the Turkmen Academy of Sciences and its reputed Sun Institute, both dating from the Soviet era. The exploration of the potential use of solar energy and other renewable sources of energy is one of the 12 priority research areas determined by the president in 2010. The full list is as follows: * Extraction and refining of oil and gas and mining of other minerals; * Development of the electric power industry, with exploration of the potential use of alternative sources of energy: sun, wind, geothermal and biogas; * Seismology; * Transportation; * The development of Information and communication technologies; * Automation of production; * Conservation of the environment and, accordingly, introduction of non-polluting technologies that do not produce waste; * Development of breeding techniques in the agricultural sector; * Medicine and pharmaceuticals; * Natural sciences; and * Humanities, including the study of the country's history, culture and folklore.  Sun Institute  The Sun Institute was restored by the president in 2009 and has since been renamed the Institute of Solar Energy. Although Turkmenistan is blessed with abundant oil and gas reserves and produces enough electric power for its own needs, it is difficult to lay power lines in the Kopet Dag mountains or arid parts of the country: about 86% of Turkmenistan is desert. Local generation of wind and solar energy gets around this problem and creates jobs. Scientists at the Sun Institute are implementing a number of long-term projects, such as the design of minisolar accumulators, solar batteries, wind and solar photovoltaic plants and autonomous industrial mini-biodiesel units. These units will be used to develop arid areas and the territory around the Turkmen Lake, as well as to foster tourism in Avaz on the Caspian seashore. In isolated parts of the country, ‚Äòsun‚Äô scientists are working on schemes to pump water from wells and boreholes, recycle household and industrial wastes, produce biodiesel and organic fertilizers and raise ‚Äòwaste-free‚Äô cattle. Their achievements include solar drying and desalination units, the cultivation of algae in solar photobioreactors, a ‚Äòsolar‚Äô furnace for high temperature tests, solar greenhouses and a biogas production unit. A wind and energy unit has been installed on Gyzylsu Island in the Caspian Sea to supply water to the local school. Within the Tempus project, ‚Äòsun‚Äô scientists have been trained (or retrained) since 2009 at the Technical University Mountain Academy of Freiberg (Germany). ‚ÄòSun‚Äô scientists are also studying the possibility of producing silicon from the Karakum sands for photovoltaic converters, thanks to a grant from the Islamic Development Bank. == Modernization of research infrastructure ==  Creation of research hubs  Many national research institutions established during the Soviet era have since become obsolete with the development of new technologies and changing national priorities. This has led Turkmenistan to reduce the number of its research institutions since 2009 by grouping existing ones to create research hubs. Several of the Turkmen Academy of Science's institutes were merged in 2014: the Institute of Botany was merged with the Institute of Medicinal Plants to become the Institute of Biology and Medicinal Plants; the Sun Institute was merged with the Institute of Physics and Mathematics to become the Institute of Solar Energy; and the Institute of Seismology merged with the State Service for Seismology to become the Institute of Seismology and Atmospheric Physics.  Development of technology parks  Turkmenistan is developing technology parks as part of the drive to modernize infrastructure. In 2011, construction began of a technopark in the village of Bikrova near Ashgabat. It will combine research, education, industrial facilities, business incubators and exhibition centres. The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies.  A National Space Agency  In 2011, the president signed a decree creating the National Space Agency, which will be responsible for monitoring the Earth's orbit, launching satellite communication services, conducting space research and operating an artificial satellite over Turkmenistan's territory.  A new university  The Turkmen State Institute of Oil and Gas was founded in 2012 before being transformed into the International Oil and Gas University a year later. Built on a 30-hectare site which includes a Centre for Information Technology, it can accommodate 3,000 students. This brings the number of training institutes and universities in the country to 16, including one private institution. == Human resources ==  Career incentives  The government has introduced a series of measures to encourage young people to pursue a career in science or engineering. These include a monthly allowance throughout their degree course for students enrolled in science and engineering and a special fund targeting the research of young scientists in priority areas for the government, namely: * the introduction of innovative technologies in agriculture; * ecology and the rational use of natural resources; * energy and fuel savings; * chemical technology and the creation of new competitive products; * construction; * architecture; * seismology; * medicine and drug production; * information and communication technologies; * economics; and * the humanities. It is hard to gauge the impact of government measures in favour of research, since Turkmenistan does not make data available on higher education, research expenditure or researchers.  Gender issues  One of the first laws adopted under Berdimuhammadov's presidency offered a state guarantee of equality for women, in December 2007. Some 16% of parliamentarians are women but there are no data on women researchers. A group of women scientists have formed a club to encourage women to choose a career in science and increase the participation of women in state programmes for science and technology and in decision-making circles. In 2015, the chair was Edzhegul Hodzhamadova, Senior Researcher at the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences. Club members meet with students, deliver lectures and give interviews to the media. The club is endorsed by the Women's Union of Turkmenistan, which has organized an annual meeting of more than 100 women scientists on National Science Day (12 June) ever since the day was instituted in 2009. Scientific publications from Central Asia catalogued by Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded, 2005-2014, UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.6 == Trends in research output == The number of scientific papers published in Central Asia grew by almost 50% between 2005 and 2014, driven by Kazakhstan, which overtook Uzbekistan over this period to become the region's most prolific scientific publisher, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Turkmen scientists published most in the field of mathematics between 2008 and 2014. Scientific output rose between 2005 and 2014 from seven to 24 articles per year. This corresponds to five scientific articles per million inhabitants in 2014, the same ratio as for Tajikistan. In comparison, Kazakh scientists tripled their output to 600 articles in a year between 2005 and 2014. They produced 35% of Central Asian articles recorded in the Thomson Reuters' database in 2005 and as many as 56% in 2014. Kazakh output nevertheless remains modest. There were 36 articles per million inhabitants in Kazakhstan in 2014, compared to 15 per million for Kyrgyzstan and 11 per million for Uzbekistan. The main partners of Turkmen scientists between 2008 and 2014 were Turkey (50 articles), the Russian Federation (11 articles), USA and Italy (6 each), China and Germany (4 each). No Turkmen patents were registered at the US Patent and Trademark Office between 2008 and 2013, compared to five for Kazakh inventors and three for Uzbek inventors. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan likewise registered no patents over this period. Cumulative total of articles by Central Asians between 2008 and 2013, by field of science.

Henderson was Artist in Residence at Kingston University, with art exhibited at the Royal Academy and National Art Collections. == Life == Jeremy Henderson was born at Lisbellaw, County Fermanagh, on 25 December 1952, to James Douglas Alexander Henderson, who managed the family business of Henderson & Eadie, and Doris Josephine n√©e Watson. He attended Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, where the art master, Angus Bryson, spotted Henderson as an exceptional student. From 1972 to 1973 Henderson studied an Arts Foundation course at Ulster University. From 1973 to 1976 he studied Fine art at Kingston University, London, achieving a Bachelor of Arts first class honours degree under the tutelage of Terry Jones, returning in 1977 as Artist in Residence. In the same year he became the first recipient of the Stanley Picker Fellowship Award in Painting. Between 1978 and 1979 Henderson completed a MA postgraduate in Fine Art at Chelsea School of Art under the tutelage of the artist John Hoyland. In 1980 Henderson started his professional artistic journey, developing abstract techniques, creating large canvases with complex layers of overlaid and inter- worked paint. Henderson lived and painted in London for 20 years before relocating back to Ireland. In the mid 1980s he worked in a studio adjacent to the house he shared with his partner, Jenni Stone with whom he had a daughter named Emerald. In 1990 Henderson moved to the Cooperage Studio, Brick Lane, London, sharing the top floor with sculptor David Fusco and artist Bryan Benge, a friend from Kingston University. Benge says \\"Every Summer the studios in the East End became part of the open studios programme. . . . . He was an intelligent and incredibly accomplished Painter\\". It was here, separated from his partner and virtually penniless, he devoted himself entirely to his work, living in a tent, donated by Benge's parents, inside the studio . Henderson was married once: in 1995 to the actress Patricia Martinelli with whom he subsequently had a daughter in 1997, Bella-Lucia. Henderson remained married, living in the remote village of Boho in Northern Ireland until his death, brought on by a brain tumour, on 28 April 2009. He remained a prolific artist throughout his life. == Work == In 1975 Henderson exhibited for Stowells Trophy at the Royal Academy. In 1977 Henderson became Artist in Residence at Kingston University. During the mid-1980s Henderson's work became recognised by private and public collectors, including Bono, leader of the Irish rock band U2. During this period Henderson sold his first work to the National Art Collection (1986). 'Cuilcagh Under A Renaissance Sky' was purchased for Fermanagh County Museum with a grant from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland during his first solo exhibition \\"Around a Border\\" in Ireland. This was followed by 3 more acquisitions via the Arts Council during the 1980s, who have continued to support his work into the new millennium acquiring \\"If Hobbema had Seen Ireland\\" (1989) in 2004 via Art Fund with support from the Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation. His work is exhibited by Arts Council England Henderson began \\"Palinurus in Soho\\" in 1991, a series of 12 paintings depicting night time rooftop scenes across London, painted from an attic in Kingly Street. Exhibited at the Anna Bornholt Gallery in 1992, ten of the series were acquired by a single private collector. Around 2000 Henderson became more influenced by Greek and Irish symbolism, in particular White Island, the Book of Kells and Sheela na gig, reflected in much of the art produced from this time onward. In 2001 Henderson was commissioned by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland to create a set of enamel Manuscripts for the William Jefferson Clinton Centre in Enniskillen, inaugurated by President Bill Clinton in 2002, in commemoration of the Remembrance Day bombings of 1987. Henderson was interested in enamelling because of the possibilities that it offered to him as a colourist and in the behaviour of gestural mark-making. The process was made possible when he was introduced to Andrew Morley, the authority on enamel sign making. Henderson's work is held in the private collection of the entrepreneur Vincent Ferguson, owner of Fitzwilton Plc and Independent News & Media PLC. His work held in the Smurfit Art Collection of Smurfit Kappa Group. Exhibitions & Awards for Henderson's work include; The Royal Academy, Stowells Trophy-1975, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London- New Contemporaries, Artscribe Prize-1978, Whitworth Gallery, Manchester, Northern Young Contemporaries, Semper Idem, Tandava Stasis-1979, Round House Gallery, London, A Sense of Ireland-1980, Fenderesky, Belfast-\\"Paintings Across a Border\\"[solo]-1986, Arts Council Gallery, Belfast-\\"Present Memories\\"-1987, Hendricks Gallery-Dublin-Present Memories-1987, Fenderesky, Belfast-\\"Landscape Now\\"-1987, Art Advice/Hendriks International Gallery-New York-\\"New Art from Ireland\\" & \\"Landscapes from Ireland\\"-1988, Atlantis Gallery, London-\\"Hill of History\\"-1994 == Description of Work == Henderson's painting style transitioned greatly from his early days favouring the mediums of Oil on Canvas; Oil on Paper; Watercolour; Gouache; Charcoal; Acrylic; Vitreous Enamel, using calligraphy in much of his work. His early vividly coloured geometric patterns were in the abstract contemporary style of the period. From the early 1980s his style developed into lyrical abstraction. Later with the transition to landscape scenes, typically of the Irish borders and coast, many layers of paint are used to build depth into each picture. In reference to these paintings Henderson says, \\"In my paintings the time of day is indeterminable, the weather changeable, something has happened or is about to happen\\". In 1986 Ted Hickey, Keeper of Art at Ulster Museum wrote, \\"To state the obvious these landscapes are not careful delineations of picturesque landscape; they are essentially emotional and concerned with ideas about the nature of art and intended to stimulate and provoke rather than reassure\\". Liam Kelly critiques the 1987 Present Memories exhibition live of BBC Radio In Henderson's 1989 work 'If Hobbema Had seen Ireland', exhibited at Fenderesky Gallery 1994 'Paintings Exhibition' and subsequently acquired via Art UK, the style is compared to that of Meindert Hobbema, as reflected in the title and reviewed by Fermanagh County Museum Curator in the Art UK 2004 Review. Artistic influences include: Hans Hoffmann, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and John Hoyland. Henderson, frequently associated with Samuel Beckett and Jack B Yeats was influenced by his homeland; his early environment, growing up around weaving, yarns and dyeing, the regions political turmoil, symbolism, and in later life his chronic illness, expressed in his more sombre paintings. John Hutchinson, critic and director of the Douglas Hyde Gallery wrote in the Sunday Independent that Henderson's paintings, \\"'demonstrate the fruitfulness of the no man's land between abstraction and representation\\", and \\"His images deliberately evoke the picturesque and romantic landscape conventions that originated in the late 18th century.....as well as the expressionist subjectivity of painters such as Jack B Yeats\\". Due to Henderson's disinterest in the commercialisation of his work he is sometimes referred to as Ireland's Invisible Genius. Henderson described the evolution of his work, after returning to Ireland in 1993, saying, \\"Since returning to Ireland my work has become less concerned with resting landscape painting in a cultural context more appropriate to our times, but has come full circle towards an internalised organic abstraction which characterised my more intuitive approach until the early eighties\\" == Public Art  References  External links == * Jeremy Henderson Website * National Irish Visual arts Library * National Art Library ‚Äì Victoria & Albert Museum ‚Äì Jeremy Henderson * Art-UK * Office of Public Works, From Past To Present: Art From Public Buildings 1815‚Äì2001 * The Impartial Reporter ‚Äì Creative journey celebrates the life of Jeremy Henderson * The Impartial Reporter ‚Äì Death of talented painter mourned by art world * Artists in Britain Since 1945, David Buckman, Excerpt of Jeremy Henderson, page 718 * National Trust ‚Äì Jeremy Henderson * WikiArt ‚Äì JeremyHenderson * BBC Radio NI live interview with Jeremy Henderson at Present Memories exhibition 1987 Category:1952 births Category:2009 deaths Category:British artists ","title":"Jeremy Henderson"},{"id":"54205100","text":"Rolf Weijburg (born 1952 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands) is a graphic artist, specialized in the art of etching. == Biography == At the age of 18 Weijburg moved to Utrecht to study at Utrecht University and enrolled for Social Geography.

The reading on the card gave the inspiration: Local Beauties; and * 'Atlas of The Worlds Smallest Countries', a series of etchings on the 25 smallest independent countries of the world. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has some works of Weijburg in their collection. Rolf Weijburg has also accepted to do commissioned work, such as providing illustrations for the Djoser travel brochures, the website of 'De Russenoorlog' and Weijburg provided the charts and map for the 35-episode series In Europa (2007-2009), after Geert Mak‚Äôs book by the same title. == Publications == * Inviting the World at Home, A survey of the world's postal links to the Netherlands.

Photograph published in the magazine \\"Feminal\\" on June 25, 1911. Mela Muter is the pseudonym used by Maria Melania Mutermilch (April 26, 1876 - May 14, 1967), the first professional Jewish painter in Poland. She lived most of her life in France. Muter's painting career began to flourish after she moved to Paris from Poland in 1901 at the age of twenty-five. Before World War I, Muter's painting practice aligned itself with the Naturalism movement; her signature works containing vivid hues and strong brush strokes. Muter gained swift popularity in Paris and within five years of her residency in the city, had already begun showing her works. Muter received French citizenship in 1927. After the breakout of WWII Muter fled to Avignon for safety during the Nazi occupation. After the war, Muter returned to Paris where she worked and resided until her death in 1967. == Life and career ==  Early life  Before Mela Muter took on her pseudonym, she was born Maria Melania Klingsland Mutermilch. Maria's family was living in Warsaw, Poland at the time of her birth and enjoyed a role amongst the social elites of Warsaw. Muter's father, Fabian Klingsland, was a supporter of the arts and cultures. The Klingsland family was financially generous and morally well-read, both are factors that would be reflected in Mela's artistic sensibilities. Muter's parents had Mela enrolled in lessons for both piano and drawing by the age of 16. Mela had three siblings: one brother and two sisters. Her younger brother, Zygmunt Klingsland, having also felt the affects the role of culture held in the family, went on to become an art critic and diplomat for the Polish Embassy in Paris. The family's status allowed Mela to expand her artistic interests. At the age of twenty three, she married the Polish Jew, Michal Mutermilch. Michal had a membership with the Polish Socialist Party and enjoyed a career as an art critic and writer. In 1900, Maria and Michal welcomed their first and only child, Andrzej. Maria continued her artistic studies at the School of Drawing and Painting for Women. Muter's early work was marked by a symbolic style that spoke to the ideals of landscape and portraiture. Even at this stage, her work demonstrated a reflective quality that negated strictly representational boundaries.  Muter in Paris  In 1901 Mela, accompanied by her husband and son, moved to Paris . Muter continued her studies at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. In 1902, she began exhibiting her work at the Paris Salon. She took part in exhibitions at the Salon des Ind√©pendants, the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts, the Salon des Tuileries and the , as well as exhibiting her work in Poland. Muter was a popular portrait painter in Paris. She also contributed illustrations to the French magazine . Muter was one of the first members of the group of artists known as the School of Paris. In the decade after leaving Warsaw, Muter and her family travelled all over Western Europe. It was through these travels that Muter's focus shifted away from the landscapes she saw and onto the people who inhabited them.  Loss and War Time  While her husband Michal was away during the first world war, Mela had an affair with French writer and political activist Raymond Lefebvre that led to her divorce from her husband. After receiving a religious divorce from her former husband, Mela cared for and resided with Raymond. After taking up his political ideals, Muter began producing pacifist artworks for the local socialist magazine, Clarte. Lefebvre would later die in 1920 under mysterious circumstances on a trip to Russia. Mela became interested in Christianity and was baptized in 1923. Muter also lost her only child to his battle with bone tuberculosis in December 1924. She was also saddened by the death of her friend Rainer Maria Rilke. Muter became a French citizen in 1927. She became a member of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts and the Soci√©t√© des Femmes Artistes Modernes. During the German occupation of France during World War II, Muter hid in the south of France. For a time, she was unable to paint due to progressive loss of sight. A retrospective of her work was presented in Paris in 1953. She had cataract surgery in 1965, returned to painting and presented works in Cologne, Paris and New York City. Muter died in her studio in Paris at the age of 91. Muter was buried in the Cimeti√®re parisien de Bagneux. == Artistic Style and Ideals == In the early ages of Muter's work, she could be classified with the post-impressionist due to the pattern and application of her paint. In style and application of paint, Vincent Van Gogh can be seen as a clear influence on Muter's earlier work. By her early thirties, Muter's painting style was distinguished with heavy brushstrokes that layered paint around the faces and hands of the people she painted to signify areas of importance. In her full adulthood, Muter's work had ties with the expressionist movement, marked by a brighter color palette and more pointed compositions, often leaving areas of the canvas bare. Vincent Van Gogh, Dr Paul Gachet, 1890, oil on canvas, 26x 22 cm. Muter was famed as a premiere portraitist in Paris, during the 20's and 30's Muter would paint the portraits for the city's elite, such as: sculptor Chana Orloff, actress Dody Conrad, and artist Charles Fromuth. Although Muter enjoyed success with the wealthy, her work was never limited to them. Muter also accomplished many works with motherhood as a central theme. The more Mela hoped to capture the essence of her sitters, the more expressionistic her paintings would become. Muter wrote of her portrait painting process: \\"I don't ask myself whether a person in front of my easels is good, false, generous, intelligent. I try to dominate them and represent them just as I do in the case of a flower, tomato or tree; to feel myself into their essence; if I manage to do that, I express myself through their personality.\\" After witnessing the tragedies of World War I, Muter's style went through another change. No longer preoccupied with the harsh realities, Muter hoped to capture the beauty and hope of her surroundings. This is reflected in her newfound use of bright colors and an even more liberal application of paint. Her works took on a new liveliness. == References == Category:1876 births Category:1967 deaths Category:20th-century French painters Category:Acad√©mie Colarossi alumni Category:Alumni of the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re Category:French women painters Category:French portrait painters Category:French landscape painters Category:French still life painters Category:Jewish women painters Category:Artists from Warsaw Category:Polish Jews Category:Polish women painters Category:20th-century French women artists Category:Polish emigrants to France ","title":"Mela Muter"},{"id":"54205135","text":"Tyrone Stroble (born July 23, 1986), also known professionally as Tyke T, is an American hip hop artist from Smyrna, Tennessee.

The low mountain range runs from north to south and reaches its highest point at the summit of the Heuberg (often also called Rosalia) near Neud√∂rfl, before descending again towards the village of Weppersdorf. They are separated from the Leitha Mountains to the north by the √ñdenburg Gate.Shores, Louis. Collier's Encyclopedia, Vol. 21. Crowell-Collier, 1963. From a geological perspective the Rosalia Mountains are part of the Bucklige Welt. The topographical boundary between the Bucklige Welt and the Rosalia is formed by the valley of the Klingfurther Bach, which runs from north to southeast and in which lie the villages of Klingfurth and Rosenbrunn. The boundary continues over the basin of the Hochwolkersdorf hamlet of Alm, along the so-called Totengraben in the Essengraben and then via the Graben into the valley of the Schwarzenbach. In the east the range is adjoined by the √ñdenburg or Sopron Mountains. The north-south boundary between them is formed by the Marzau, the Sieggraben Saddle and the Sieggrabenbach valley. The following peaks are located in the northern Rosalia: * Scheiben * Mitterriegel * Gespitzter Riegel * Bergkogel * Bauernmai√ü * Kogel * Krieriegel The northern and southern Rosalia Mountains are separated from one another by the Wulka valley, the Heuberg (highest point of the range near the Rosalia Chapel) and a ridge that runs from the Heuberg via the Auerberg and the Hochwolkersdorf hamlet of Hollerberg to Fernblick. The following peaks are located in the southern Rosalia: * Auerberg * Hartlspitz * Gei√üspitz * Schwarzkogel * Greimkogel * Reisnerkogel * Marriegel * Sieggrabener Kogel * K√∂nigsb√ºhel * Schwarzenbach Burgberg * Roter Riegel Like the Leitha Mountains, the Rosalia Mountains are made of gneiss, schist and limestone. The ridge is heavily forested. The highest point is the Heuberg with its Rosalia Chapel, which reaches a height of 748 metres. At the top is the ORF transmitter of Heuberg which covers northern Burgenland. On the steep limestone crags at its eastern foot is Forchtenstein Castle. The range is drained by the Wulka, the Leitha and the Schwarzenbach. Part of the range is located within the Rosalia- Kogelberg Nature Park. The Rosalia Mountains can only be crossed by the road from Mattersburg in Burgenland to Hochwolkersdorf in Lower Austria. In its lateral valleys, favourable conditions have led to extensive orchards and vineyards. A well-known village is the spa of Bad Sauerbrunn at their northern foot. == Literature == * Franz K.

It was co-written by executive producer Oliver Goldstick and Francesca Rollins, and directed by Goldstick. They had previously worked on the ninth episode of the sixth season. In this episode, Mona (Janel Parrish) teams up with the Liars to investigate on Alison's pregnancy and on the Liars' Lament board game. Ezra (Ian Harding) and Aria (Lucy Hale) discuss their marriage, while Caleb (Tyler Blackburn) proposes to Hanna (Ashley Benson). Meanwhile, Spencer (Troian Bellisario) reconnects with biological mother Mary (Andrea Parker), creating a feud between Spencer and Mr. Hastings (Nolan North). == Plot == \\"A.D.\\" enlists Aria to leave a burner phone on the Hastings residence, connecting it to the house's network to reproduce a recording which contains a conversation between Peter and Mary, in the aftermath of Jessica's death, six years prior. It ultimately leads a discussion between Spencer and her parents. Peter defends himself by saying that he would do anything to protect his family, including killing. Spencer is shocked by her father's imprudence, and Veronica relinquishes her Senatorial position. Flashbacks show that Mary visited the Hastings residence when Veronica and her daughters were traveling. She, Peter and Jessica had an argument the same night. Later, Mary takes Spencer to the Lost Woods Resort, where she reveals that Jessica and Peter were plotting against her. Mary then took revenge on the two and used the plan to kill Jessica instead, leaving her body on Peter's yard. Mary asks Spencer if she wants to run away, mother and daughter, but Spencer rejects the offer, saying that she needs to help her friends. Aria's relationship with Ezra cools off while she continues to blame herself for being a tormentor's assistant. They enroll in dance classes, but Ezra isn't able to understand what's going on with his fianc√©e. Ezra then begins to think that Aria has not yet forgiven the fact that he had approached her to write a book about Alison, but Aria denies it. \\"A.D.\\" machinations lead Aria to dream a strange nightmare. In the nightmare, Mona sings a rendition of \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", while Ezra is an inmate who is beaten by several other inmates. The black-and-white number ends with Veronica Hastings proffering Ezra and Aria's marriage, with Aria trying to apologize for what she did. As a reward for having obeyed the orders, \\"A.D.\\" give Aria one piece of the puzzle and some confidential files. Detective Furey visits Hanna on her apartment the day after the Radley's flood. He indirectly accuses Caleb and Hanna of being responsible for the flood in an attempt to protect Spencer. Furey then reveals that he has other crucial evidence that could led him to Dunhill's killer, and Hanna worries. She then goes to the Liar's Lament board game to play, and enlists Mona's help. Mona also teams up with Emily to find more information on Alison's terrible fertilization. They visit the doctor who performed the operation, not getting much information. Mona then goes to the address of the doctor's house ‚Äì which she found in a magazine stolen from his office ‚Äì and finds an envelope with money. She pressures the doctor, who reveals that he has never seen the giver and that everything was negotiated online. Hanna returns to where Archer was buried, in search of the shovels she and the others used to bury him. She then encounters a park ranger, who reveals the shovels were taken by the authorities. Meanwhile, Caleb meets with Ashley Marin, who just got back to Rosewood. Ashley worries that Hanna may be in danger and asks Caleb for information, who denies any possibility of peril. Ashley visits Hanna in her apartment in order to find out if there is anything wrong. However, Caleb proposes to Hanna in front of Ashley. Afterwards, Caleb and Hanna camp in a grove and made a sort of replica of marriage. Emily looks for Mona in her apartment, but Mona says she will return with the investigations the next day, driving Emily out.

Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV write a favorable review for the episode, stating, \\"I'll throw my hands up and say I enjoyed it, as strange as it was, I enjoyed every second of it. [The musical number]'s perhaps not the only weird thing to happen in this episode, which would be how I would describe 'Driving Miss Crazy'. I mean, whoever thought we would also see Mona and Emily as a couple (albeit not real but still perfectly executed by Mona), as well as a couple of twists at the end that have made me freeze and go 'hold on a minute, what fresh hell is this?' But, the journey to the finish line remains a bumpy one, but it's a journey I am so glad to be on.\\" He added, \\"No matter what people say, I have enjoyed 7B so far and I continue to enjoy it now. This was a very good episode.\\" On the other hand, Paul Dailly of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 3 out of 5 stars rating, writing, \\"[the episode] was not great.

It is the main port for the eastern part of the island of Java. The port is accessed from the North through the Madura Strait, a 25 mile long, 100m wide and 9.5m deep channel between East Java and Madura Island. Because of its strategic position and the existence of surrounding advantageous hinterlands, the port constitutes the center of inter island shipping for Eastern Indonesia. Container terminal of the port is known as Terminal Petikemas. The port loaded and unloaded 3.55 million and 3.8 million TEUs of cargo during 2017 and 2018 respectively. The container port ranked as 43rd busiest in the world by Lloyd's One Hundred Ports 2019. ==History== Before 20th century, oceangoing vessels from Surabaya did loading and unloading activities at Madura Strait and then freighted the cargoes by the means of barges and boats to Jembatan Merah (the first port in that time) situated along Kalimas River. Due to the increases of trade, cargo and transportation traffics, the facilities available at that port were inadequate. In 1875, Ir. W. de Jonght planned to build the Port of Tanjung Perak, but the plan was not realized due to a lack of funds. At the start of 20th century Ir. W.B. Van Goor submitted another proposal for the port. Physical construction of the port started in 1910. After the completion of the Tanjung Perak Port, the ports of Kalimas and Jembatan Merah were gradually abandoned. An inter-island terminal and a passenger ferry terminal were built in the port in 1983. The Petikemas International Container Terminal was finished in 1992. The port was dredged to a depth to serve 10,000 TEUs 5th generation ships in mid-2015. In mid-2016 the port was dredged to a depth with a width of that can serve 15,000 TEUs or 7th generation ships. ==Facilities== The port has 6 main terminals, multi-purpose terminals for conventional cargo handling, a passenger terminal, RoRo and an international container terminal. Tugging, pilot, bunker, storage and shipyard services are also provided. Since 2015, activities of the port are supported by the Teluk Lamong Port Terminal. Tanjung Perak Port is also equipped with dock facilities that can serve cruises both from domestic and abroad. In May 2014, a new Teluk Lamong Green Sea Port began trial run operation with two Ship to Shore Crane units, five Automated Stacking Crane units, and one Automotive Terminal Tractor unit as an extension of the Tanjung Perak port. The new facilities will primarily serve international shipping, predicted to be 7 ships every week, and any unused capacity will be used to support domestic shipping. The new facilities will use less paper and gas trucks to carry containers in the port area. From January 2015, a dry bulk port will be built with piers to accommodate up to 14 Logistex Warehouse System international ships. The port will be provided with 2 \\"Ship Unloader\\" units complete with conveyors and of warehousing. The dry bulk terminal will occupy , a supporting area of for a total capacity of . Gapura Surya Nusantara The new passenger terminal of the port is known as Gapura Surya Nusantara, which was opened in 2014. The terminal is built with modern amnesties and facilities, similar to an airport terminal including passenger bridge, ticket counter, waiting lounge and food court. The terminal is built with the concept of green architecture, environmentally friendly and energy saving technology. The sewage treatment plant (STP) of the terminal can recycle waste water which can be used for flushing toilets. The terminal consists of 3 floors covering an area of 16,120 square meters with a capacity of 4,000 passengers. The terminal operates regular ship service to various ports of Indonesia, which is also serves as terminal for international cruise ships. == Gallery == File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Panorama in drie delen van de haven Tandjong Perak gezien vanaf de Wilhelminatoren Soerabaja Oost-Java.

One of her most notable concerts was in 1906 in London when she played Grieg's Piano Concerto under the composer's leadership. ==Biography== Born on 21 April 1869 in Copenhagen, Stockmarr was the daughter of the violinist Ferdinand Tycho Nicolai Stockmarr (1835-34) and Ane Emilie Raun (1842-1911). She was born into a well established family of musicians, including an uncle and two of her cousins, all of whom encouraged her to play the piano. In 1885, she began studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Music under Edvard Helsted. After appearing in a concert at the Casino Theatre in 1889, she received a grant which enabled her to continue her studies in Paris under the pianist Henri Fissot (1843‚Äì96). On her return to Copenhagen, she completed her studies under Franz Neruda. With Neruda conducting, from 1892 she appeared in a number of concerts in Copenhagen, notably at the Musikforeningen in 1898 where she played Tchaikovsky's Second Piano Concerto. She went on to perform more widely in Scandinavia, England and Germany, often together with Neruda's sister, the violinist Wilhelmine Neruda who lived in London where she was known as Lady Hall√©. Hall√© introduced her to Queen Alexandra, whom she played for when she visited Denmark. Back in London, she established a close relationship with Alexandra, playing four-handed pieces with her. She was also the piano teacher of Queen Alexandrine and Princess Dagmar. In 1906 in Queen's Hall, London, Stockmarr played Grieg's Piano Concerto with Grieg conducting. She performed pieces by Grieg increasingly frequently, playing his music every night for a week for BBC broadcasts in 1928. In 1943, on the occasion of Grieg's 100th anniversary, she played his piano concerto in Tivolis Koncertsal.

As well as promoting their upcoming film, the documentary also serves as a tenth anniversary profile of the team, despite the original broadcast date of 20 June 1979 being some months ahead of both the tenth anniversary of their TV debut (in October) and the UK release of their new film (in November).http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1979-06-20 ==Summary== The film begins with a recap of the Pythons' solo activities since the release of Monty Python and the Holy Grail in 1975. These include Eric Idle's Rutland Weekend Television, John Cleese's Fawlty Towers, Michael Palin and Terry Jones' Ripping Yarns, Terry Gilliam's Jabberwocky and Graham Chapman's The Odd Job. The origins of Monty Python's Flying Circus are briefly covered and the film also features separately filmed comments, notably from Graham Chapman and John Cleese, about their fellow team members.

The Native Ukrainian National Faith (Ukrainian: –†—ñÃÅ–¥–Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—óÃÅ–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –ù–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞ÃÅ–ª—å–Ω–∞ –í—ñÃÅ—Ä–∞, R√≠dna Ukray√≠ns'ka Natsion√°l'na V√≠ra; widely known by the acronym –†–£–ù–í—ñÃÅ—Ä–∞, RUNVira) or Sylenkoism is a branch of the Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery) specifically linked to Ukraine that was founded in the 1960s by Lev Sylenko (1921‚Äì2008) among the Ukrainian diaspora in North America. The doctrine of this tradition, and of the organisations which develop within it, revolves around a sacred writing composed by Sylenko himself, the Maha Vira (\\"Mighty Faith\\"). The Sylenkoite movement is distinctively monotheistic, and this, together with its early emphasis on the charismatic figure of the founder, has led other Ukrainian Rodnover movements and organisations to define it as not authentically \\"Rodnover\\". Members of Sylenkoite churches, however, consider themselves Rodnovers in all respects. Ivakhiv (2005) defines it as a \\"reformed\\" Slavic Native Faith. It may be more accurately defined as pantheistic or panentheistic, since, in the Maha Vira, Dazhbog (\\"Giving God\\", the name that Sylenkoites use to refer to the supreme God) himself proclaims through his prophet: \\"I am the Giving God, I am in all things and all things are in me\\". According to the definition given by Sylenko himself, his doctrine is that of a solar \\"absolute monotheism\\". Sylenko proclaimed himself a prophet, bringing to the Slavs a new understanding of God that, according to him, corresponds to their own and original understanding of God. By his own words: \\"God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God\\". According to believers, he acquired this knowledge through \\"breath of his ancestors\\" being united with them \\"by divine holiness\\". The movement is split between at least four churches which administer more than one hundred congregations spread throughout Ukraine. These four churches are: the \\"Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith\\" (OSID RUNVira), the \\"Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith\\" (OSIDU RUNVira), Volodymyr Chornyi's network, and the \\"Union of Native Ukrainian Faith\\" (SRUV). ==Maha Vira and the founder== Lev Sylenko holding the Maha Vira, 1979. The Maha Vira (literally \\"Great Faith\\") is the holy writing used within the organisations of the Sylenkoite movement. It was composed by Lev Sylenko himself in the 1960s as a synthesis of philosophical ideas relying upon historical and archeological sources. It includes a comparative lexicon of Sanskrit, Ukrainian and English language. The book tells the history of \\"Oryana-Scythia-Rus-Ukraine\\" over eleven thousand years, intertwined with theological and cosmological concepts. It identifies the Trypillian culture (3000‚Äì5000 BCE) as \\"Oryana\\" or \\"Orania\\", assumed to having been the epicentre of the Indo-Europeans or Aryans (whom the book calls Oryans, evoking a connection with the Ukrainian word for plowing, oraty; cf. the same cognation in Latin, arare). According to the book, the white racial type and consequently European civilisation first developed along the banks of the Dnieper, and ancient Oryans-Ukrainians are credited as the initiators of the philosophy later written down in the Vedas, developed as the Oryans migrated in different directions including the north of the Indian subcontinent. Sylenko was a disciple of Volodymyr Shaian (1908‚Äì1974), the father of Rodnovery in Ukraine, and member of the religio-political anti-Soviet \\"Order of the Knights of the Sun God\\" (Orden Lytsariv Boha Sontsia) founded by Shaian in the 1940s. Sylenko was initiated into the group with the name Orlyhora (\\"Eagle Mountain\\"). By the 1970s, however, the links between the two had been severed, since Sylenko pursued his own reformation of the Slavic Native Faith which Shaian rejected. Halyna Lozko, the leader of the \\"Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers\\" (–û–±—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –†–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ—Ä–æ–≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã), which continues Volodymyr Shaian's orthodoxy, has advanced vehement critiques of Sylenkoism, calling Lev Sylenko a \\"false prophet\\" and accusing him of trying to lead Ukrainians into the \\"quagmire of cosmopolitan monotheism\\", the \\"fruit of Judaic religions which aim for global world domination\\". ==The early RUNVira organisation== Temple of Mother Ukraine-Oryana, Spring Glen, New York, US. Priest of one of the RUNVira organisations preaching at a temple in Ukraine. The Native Ukrainian National Faith was founded by Lev Sylenko in the mid-1960s. Beginning in those years, groups were established among the Ukrainian diaspora. The first was in Chicago, in the United States, and later groups formed in Canada, Britain and Australia. Headquarters were set at the Temple of Mother Ukraine-Oryana, located in Spring Glen, New York, in the Catskill Mountains. The movement was introduced in Ukraine in the early 1990s, at the end of the Soviet Union. The first congregation was registered by the government in Kiev just in 1991. By the early 2000s, registered communities had grown to fifty and other tens were active throughout the country without formal registration. The international Sylenkoite-RUNVira movement then split into at least four branches. ==Subsequent branchings== OSIDU RUNVira Among Sylenkoite organisations, the \\"Associations of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith\\" (OSIDU RUNVira) is that which has maintained direct relationship with Sylenko, fully accepting him as prophet. As of the mid-2000s the organisations' leader was Bohdan Savchenko. They consider themselves a transformed and completed Ukrainian Native Faith, focusing on the monotheistic belief in the impersonal Dazhbog (literally \\"Giving God\\"), the life-giving energy of the cosmos. Members of OSIDU RUNVira practise a weekly Holy Hour of Self-Realisation, which includes reading the Maha Vira, commentaries, sermons, ancestor worship, prayers and hymns, and ends with the singing of Ukraine's national anthem. Liturgical elements of the service include a chalice with water from a local river, a box or chest containing earth from sacred ground, candles, a copy of the Maha Vira, wheat- sheaves, herbs and flowers. OSID RUNVira Theo-cosmological painting in a RUNVira temple. The \\"Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith\\" (OSID RUNVira) is the largest among Sylenkoite organisations. While recognising him as the founder of the movement, OSID RUNVira has rejected Lev Sylenko's ultimate authority and is currently led by a Holy Council presided by Bohdan Ostrovsky in Kiev. Ostrovsky was the founder of the first congregation of Native Ukrainian National Faith in Ukraine in 1991. OSID RUNVira controls the Temple of Mother Ukraine-Oryana in Spring Glen which the organisation took over by legal means in the late 1990s, after a dispute with OSIDU RUNVira over the ownership. Also OSID RUNVira members hold weekly Holy Hours, but these incorporate non-Sylenkoite elements such as readings of the Book of Veles or of Taras Shevchenko's national poetry. OSID RUNVira puts more emphasis than other Sylenkoite groups on calendrical celebrations, and their liturgy includes objects like the didukh (braided wheat-sheaf) and objects representing fire, water and earth. Ancestor worship is central, and festivals include de-Christianised holidays, such as the \\"Christmas of Dazhbog's Light\\" and the \\"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\\", and holidays in honour of minor Slavic gods, Ukrainian heroes, the Slavs' supreme ancestor Or (otherwise spelled Ory, Ary, Yari, Yuri, and Yarilo), and others. Union of Native Ukrainian Faith The \\"Union of Native Ukrainian Faith\\" (–°–æ–±–æ—Ä –†—ñ–¥–Ω–æ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –í—ñ—Ä–∏, Sobor Ridnoy Ukrainskoy Viry; SRUV) is another organisation of the Sylenkoite movement, more independent than the others from the original tradition. It was established in 1994 under the leadership of Oleg Bezverkhy, and has its headquarters in Vinnytsia. Besides Lev Sylenko, it relies upon the works of Shkavrytko, Kokriatsky, Orion, Lisovy and others. While retaining Sylenkoite monotheism, the SRUV promotes what it considers a more authentically Ukrainian theology with an emphasis on mysticism. They consider Podolia to be the heart of ancient Ukrainian-Oryan civilisation, being the place where remains of a large Scythian temple and the Zbruch Idol of Svetovid were found. ==See also== * Slavic Native Faith ==Sources== Citations References * * ==External links== * http://runvira.org/ * http://runvira.in.ua/ * http://runvira.com.ua/ * http://www.dazhboh.org/ Category:Slavic neopaganism Category:Neopaganism in Ukraine Category:Neopagan organizations based in the United States ","title":"Native Ukrainian National Faith"},{"id":"54205618","text":"Daniel Mushitu Mwinkeu (born 22 February 2000) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a forward for AIK. ==Youth career== Mushitu started playing for Ludvika FK before joining Nyhammars IF.

The San Francisco Curb Exchange replaced the Mining Exchange at the 350 Bush Street building. The Curb Exchange later left the building in 1938, when the Curb Exchange was absorbed by the San Francisco Stock Exchange. ==History== Formation By April 23, 1927, the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange and the San Francisco Stock Exchange, mining, were negotiating over the establishment of the former as purely listed market, and the latter as a curb exchange. To prevent naming confusion, there were talks to have the SF Stock Exchange be named the San Francisco Curb Exchange or Association, with the name 'San Francisco Stock Exchange' to become the property of the Stock and Bond Exchange. Upon the ratification of the agreement, there would be ninety days for corporations with stocks \\"on the unlisted board [of the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange] to meet listing requirements or to be transferred to the Curb board, where \\"another probationary period will ensue in which Curb requirements may be met.\\" It was said these curb requirements would be \\"substantially\\" those of the New York Curb Market. In December 1927, the Stock and Bond Exchange voted for reorganization and division of business in the exchange, resulting in the creation of a new curb market in San Francisco. On December 9, 1927, it was reported that the new San Francisco Curb Exchange was expected to begin operation soon after the start of 1928, and would be the third security markets in the city. Opening on Bush Street The new Curb Exchange was created to take over the \\"splendid plant on Bush Street of the old Mining Exchange.\\" The Curb Exchange started activities on January 2, 1928, using the unlisted securities formerly on the SF Stock and Bond Exchange. Per the agreement behind the formation of the curb market, all members of the SF Stock and Bond Exchange held memberships in both the new Stock Exchange and the new curb exchange. The Curb had an authorized 100 charter members, 67 from the Stock and Bond Exchange, and the remaining made available for sale. The Curb Exchange left the Bush Street building in 1938, when it was absorbed by the San Francisco Stock Exchange. ==See also== *Curbstone broker *Regional stock exchange *List of former stock exchanges in the Americas *List of stock exchange mergers in the Americas *History of San Francisco ==ReferencesExternal links== *Picture of the Curb Exchange Building at 350 Bush St. *Curb Exchange Building at 350 Bush St., by the San Francisco Public Library Category:Former stock exchanges in the United States Category:19th century in San Francisco ","title":"San Francisco Curb Exchange"},{"id":"54205698","text":"The Claustre Affair was a hostage crisis during the First Chadian Civil War. Chadian rebels, calling themselves the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (CCFAN), lead by Toubou nationalist Hiss√®ne Habr√© kidnapped Fran√ßoise Claustre, a French archaeologist, Marc Combe, a worker in a French development organization in Chad, and Christoph Staewen, a German doctor. Although Combe escaped and Staewen was ransomed back by the West German government, the rebels demanded a ransom of 10 million francs for Mrs. Claustre and her husband Pierre, who was later also captured by the rebels. The case garnered international attention, with the French sending a negotiator who was later executed. Finally the French appealed to Muammar Gaddafi to free the hostages, which he then did. The affair showcased Libya's growing influence in Central Africa. == Background == Hiss√®ne Habr√©, leader of the group that kidnapped Claustre and the other hostages Fran√ßois Tombalbaye, Chadian independence leader Chad gained its independence from France in 1960, but the majority of French-educated Chadians came from the south of the country, so people from southern Chad had more power in the new government than the northerners. Although the French continued to hold on to the Borkou- Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture, the northern part of Chad, until 1965, the lack of power for northern Chad escalated tensions between the two parts of the country. In 1966, a rebel group was formed, the Front for National Liberation of Chad, or FROLINAT, that began an insurgency in northern Chad against the post-independence government of Fran√ßois Tombalbaye. By 1967, the rebellion had spread to much of the country, particularly northern and eastern Chad. Like most of France's former colonies, Chad had signed a secret agreement with France allowing for French assistance in 'domestic maintenance of order,' which stated that Chad could request France to take direct military action against an internal rebellion. However, this also meant that the French gained command of all Chadian military forces for the duration of the suppression. By late 1969, the government had lost several important battles against FROLINAT, and appealed to French president Charles de Gaulle to crush the insurgents. DeGaulle approved the move to help the Chadian government, if they allowed France to set up a Mission de r√©forme administrative (MRA), headed by Pierre Claustre, to reform the Chadian government to stop a future uprising. Tombalbaye acceded to the request, and de Gaulle deployed 2800 troops and around 600 'advisors' to Chad. The French-led coalition managed to destroy most FROLINAT groups in an operation that took around 10,000 lives, but many rebel groups managed to survive, especially in the Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region. In addition, the M.R.A. didn't complete its mission to change the government of Chad, essentially setting Chad up for another rebellion for the same reason as the original. == Kidnapping == The alt=A hazy-looking yellow field of desert sand with rocks in the foreground and dark mountains and the blue sky in the background On the night of April 12, 1974, the CCFAN led by Hiss√®ne Habr√© attacked the northern Chadian town of Barda√Ø. Auxiliary troops, gardes nomades, helped the group kidnap Marc Combe, an M.R.A. worker, Fran√ßoise Claustre, a French archaeologist, as well as Christoph Staewen, a German doctor providing medical treatment for locals. Staewen's wife was killed in the crossfire. The rebels loaded 3 cars they found on the site with food and other supplies, including Combe's radio, put the hostages in, and drove off. The Chadian garrison attempted to respond but was unable to pursue the rebels in the darkness of the desert. In N'Djamena, Fran√ßoise's husband Pierre, head of the M.R.A., heard of the kidnapping and flew the to Faya- Largeau, capital of Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture, from where he hoped to go to Barda√Ø to learn more. Over the next few weeks, Pierre was the only person who contacted the kidnappers often, as the French ambassador Fernand Wibaux had just left, and his replacement, Rapha√´l Touze, would not arrive until April 27. In addition, the French president, Georges Pompidou, had just died, and there would be no centralizing policy anchor until after the general election on May 19. == Negotiations == Tombalbaye ordered reinforcements to Barda√Ø, but both Pierre Claustre and the Chadian prefect in Faya-Largeau thought that the rebels would execute the hostages in response to a military buildup. Luc Baldit, the French charg√© d'affaires in N'Djamena, was ordered to not provide support to a Chadian military operation that could endanger the lives of the hostages in any way. Already, two West German envoys had arrived in Chad to negotiate with the hostages. The French were sending Robert Puissant, a high-ranking official, to be their negotiator, but it would take time for him to arrive. Franz Wallner, one of the German envoys, joined Pierre Claustre in Barda√Ø. On the morning of 10 May, Habr√© and hisCCFAN published their demands: * The release of 32 political prisoners in N'Djamena * The publication of a CCFAN political manifesto * An 'indemnity' for the property of the local populations, especially the villages, palm groves, crops, and other goods that Habr√© claimed French and Chadian forces had destroyed during the civil war The demands were difficult for the French to accept, and put them in a tight spot. The new French ambassador to Chad, Raph√§el Touze, feared that the demands were specific enough to France's problems in the region that West Germany would go it alone and negotiate only for Staewen. In addition, by demanding that France release prisoners held by another government, Habr√© was straining the relationship between the French and Chadian governments. Since releasing the prisoners was not something Tombalbaye wanted to do, French policymakers wanted to go about negotiations in a way that would not undermine the authority of the Chadian government. Some Chadian officials, including the prefect of the BET Prefecture, wanted to stop any direct contact between the CCFAN and the French and German negotiators. Franz Wallner, the German negotiator, met his French counterpart Robert Puissant and the French ambassador Touze in N'Djamena. They agreed to coordinate a negotiation strategy, but told the French that they would negotiate separately while the CCFAN maintained its demands for a prisoner release, as the West German government had no involvement in that aspect. The Germans had offered to broadcast a CCFAN manifesto over Deutsche Welle in French and Arabic for 3 days, and to pay an indemnity of 50 million CFA francs for the damages Habr√© stated. It seemed that Habr√© had accepted the offer in principle. The Germans also urged Touze and Puissant to keep the liberation of the hostages secret from the Tombalbaye government, which would be infuriated about the broadcast of an anti-government manifesto over German radio and a large ransom payment to the CCFAN, so the French and Germans planned to fly directly from Barda√Ø to Tunis before the Tombalbaye government could react. The French began to pressure Tombalbaye to release the prisoners. Although Puissant said that the release of political prisoners was something controlled only by the Tombalbaye government, he feared that inaction on the part of Chad would stop any chance of the hostages being released. He was correct; Chad refused to release the prisoners, but seemed willing to fulfill the other two conditions that the rebels gave. On 18 May 1974, both Robert Puissant and Franz Wallner met with Habr√© at the village of Zou√Ø east of Barda√Ø. Habr√© demanded 1 billion CFA franc (around $20 million today) in addition to his other demands. The next day, Wallner officially accepted Habr√©'s demands in Zou√Ø. After two days, the negotiators again returned to Zou√Ø to finalize negotiations, during which, according to Pierre Claustre, Puissant threatened Habr√© that \\"'terrible reprisals would fall upon the populations of Tibesti'\\" if any of the hostages was executed. On 26 May 1974, Chadian soldiers began burning the homes of the gardes nomades who defected to CCFAN, and later on that evening set fire to the local palm grove. The sub-prefect of the region told Claustre, with tears in his eyes, \\"'They're crazy, how could the population not hate them?'\\" The French government sent in a former ambassador to Chad who had good relations with Tombalbaye to try and get a prisoner release. Tombalbaye seemed to agree, but on 2 June 1974, he gave an inflammatory speech in which he demanded that the rebels release the hostages before getting the prisoners. He threatened Habr√©'s family, and indeed Chadian forces had captured 60 of his relatives, including his mother and son. Pierre Claustre even heard they were transported on French aircraft. Even with these issue, Habr√© still released Christoph Staewen in exchange for the broadcast of the manifesto and 4 million French francs. The Germans took Staewen to Libya to avoid Chadian authorities. Later, Chad broke diplomatic relations with West Germany and declared Pierre Claustre, who had already left for France, a persona non grata. In order to resolve this, the French appointed Pierre Galopin, a French Commandant, to accompany Consul General Georges Estrade in negotiations. Pierre Galopin had previously served as deputy to Camille Gourvenec, head of Tombalbaye's intelligence service, a service that committed torture and other abuses against detainees. Galopin also led 1969 negotiations that caused large parts of FROLINAT to defect to the government, Goukouni Weddeye, the co-leader of the CCFAN, held a special grudge against Galopin, == References == Category:History of Chad Category:Hostage taking in Chad ","title":"Claustre Affair"},{"id":"54205713","text":"The four-angled stem of Sabatia quandragula Sabatia quadrangula, the fourangle rose gentian or four-angle rose-gentian, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.

They were built by Kazimierz Wielki also known as Casimir III the Great, who reigned as the King of Poland from 1333 to 1370. The walls were built in the years 1350-1370. In 1793 the Prussians decided to transform ≈Åƒôczyca into a fortress. Napoleon's armies maintained the fortress until the Austrians started to demolish the fortifications in 1809. By 1820 moats were filled and the biggest part of the walls was dismantled. The brick was used in the construction of houses. The original walls enclosed an area of approximately 9 hectares, amounted to 1150 metres in length and 7 metres in height. ==Description== The defensive walls were built on stone foundations with bricks, varying in thickness between 1.5 and 2 meters. They were crowned with crenellation. Their perimeter had the shape of a rectangle with rounded corners. There were two gates: Pozna≈Ñska from the West and Krakowska from the South. They were placed in short, quadrate tower gates. One could enter by walking through the small bridges over the moat, which were probably drawbridges. Later, instead of making the Pozna≈Ñska gate taller (which was very common intervention in the Middle Ages) citizens of ≈Åƒôczyca built another gate next to it. Krakowska was not changed. There was a castle in the south-eastern corner of ≈Åƒôczyca, which was connected with the city. But its task was not defense but observation of the entrance from the South. T. Poklewski-Kozie≈Ç≈Ç suggests that, like other royal castles, it was supposed to protect the officials before the townspeople. In reality, castle was protected by the town, not in other way around. The area of the town within the defensive walls was 9 hectares and the length of the fortifications was 1150 metres. In 1603 in the south-western part of the circuit the Monastery of Norbertine Sisters was added to the walls. Also in the 16th century the crenellation was converted into an indoor porch. The line of fortifications was strengthened by 9 towers on the north, east and south sides of the castle. The towers are spaced at intervals of 50‚Äì60 meters. [5] The only tower preserved to this day has been converted into the belfry of St. Andrzej. Its shape is square and it is totally closed. There is a rare element of urban fortifications in its southern wall- 14th-century stairs whose thickness is equivalent to the thickness of the defensive walls. It was the connection between the combat walkway and the lower floor of tower. Originally the tower did not have a direct exit on the outside and was the strongest point of defense. Over the centuries the ramparts were repeatedly damaged and periodically repaired. In the second half of 16th-century foreman Jan Lutomierski remodeled the culmination of the walls on the eastern part. The new gate, called Wodna, was built and led to a ‚Äòprzygr√≥dek‚Äô, another defensive enclosure. The defensive walls of ≈Åƒôczyca, the castle and the whole city were destroyed during the Swedish Deluge. In 1793 the Prussians decided to transform ≈Åƒôczyca into a fortress. Napoleon's armies was maintaining the fortress until the Austrians started to demolish the fortifications in 1809. In 1820 moats were filled and then the biggest part of the walls was dismantled. The brick was used to construction of houses. Except for one tower, to this day, only a few sections of the walls used in construction of the monastery have been preserved. ==References== Category:≈Åƒôczyca County Category:City walls in Poland ","title":"Defensive walls of ≈Åƒôczyca"},{"id":"54205765","text":"GRC Envelop is a risk management and audit management software tool. It enables process control managers, auditors and risk managers to document and manage their work. The entire tool is web based and is built using the Python/Django. The idea behind GRC Envelop is to help risk managers and auditors with a standard work flow and framework to help capture the process details within an organisation. This tool is mainly used for internal and external audits focused on financial, IT, HR and sales processes within firms. Since, this tool has an open source license, it has been listed on a few sites Throughout GRC Envelop, the fundamental data structure is as follows: Processes ‚Üí Objectives ‚Üí Risks ‚Üí Controls ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Findings ‚Üí Actions Processes are the basic starting point for the entire tool. Objectives, risks and controls are the most important part that this tool intends to handle. Sometimes this part is also referred to as the risk control matrix in some organisations. == Features == * Audit management: There are three basic areas for the audit management ** Creating audits - Title, description, start and end dates are of some of the features that are available while creating an audit. You can also attached work papers to an Audit. While creating an audit, you can create the processes, the objectives, the risks, the controls and the tests. At each of these levels you can attach work papers too. ** Managing and executing audits - to manage or execute an Audit, the GRC Envelop tool provides a separate workflow to ensure that auditors can only enter test results and test descriptions. While executing the audit you can create findings and actions. The ability to make control and test assessment is only available in the enterprise version. ** Report generation - the main use of this tool is to provide easy report generation at the end of an auditing exercise. report generation template can be modified according to your needs. The community version has only one default report generation template. The enterprise version has the ability to have multiple templates. * Risk Management: The risk management module looks at providing the basic structure for capturing the risk assessment process and documentation. The module is generally based around ISO/IEC 27001:2013. ** Risk register: A register is a collection of risks. Registers may be used to group risks in any manner that is convenient to the firm. A Register report can be generated to show risk register details and an overview of all the risks and stakeholder opinions. ** Risk: A risk is a clear definition of some kind of uncertainty that will affect the firm in future. An uncertainty can occur on many different dimensions, for example, financial risk or reputation risk. There are two aspects to consider when modeling risk, likelihood and impact. Likelihood and Impact are presented as scales in the risk management module. ** The risk owner: any user on the system ** Risk Opinion: The most powerful feature of this module is to generate a survey link which can be sent to all the stakeholders associated with the risk (or risk register). GRC Envelop with capture all the responses on the survey and present the report based on a template. ** Risk Summary: The risk summary provides an overview of all the responses from the stakeholders to the Risk Manager. There is a table that provides the detailed view of each stakeholder and their responses. The last row of the table has the average values of the likelihood and impacts across all the stakeholders. ** Report generation: reports can be generated based on a changeable template. The template can be designed to aggregate the responses in numerous ways. ** Scales: Scales are to be defined for likelihood and impact of a risk. Each scale has numeric range (minimum and maximum values), the units that the scale deals with and the type of scale (whether Likelihood or Impact scale). Each scale has a title and description too. * Repository: The repository module is a store or library of processes, objectives, risks, controls and tests. The structure under a process group is the same as that in the audit module. However, there are no findings or actions in the repository module. * Planning: Planning module helps managers to see on a calendar format the different audits and resources that are planned for a time period. For example, conflicts of assignment of auditors can be quickly recognised == Users and Roles == Restricting users to their areas is an important task for a tool. The community version has only one user type ( auditor) whereas the enterprise version has the following seven user types: * auditor * audit manager * risk manager * repository manager * internal business user * external viewer * system administrator == Licenses == There are two types of licenses that with which GRC Envelop is available: * Open source MIT license (limited features) * Enterprise license == Releases == * 29 December 2018 - Release version 0.5.2 (community version) * 17 July 2018 - Release version 2.1.0 (enterprise version) * 17 April 2018 - Release version 0.4.1 (community version) * 24 October 2017 - Windows installers are made available (community version) * 1 October 2017 - Release version 1.2.1 (enterprise version) * 15 January 2017 - Release version 1.1.4 (enterprise version) * 27 September 2016 - Release version 1.1.4 (enterprise version) * 8 June 2016 - Release version 0.3.2 (community version) * 30 September 2015 - Initial release version 0.2 (community version) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Auditing Category:Internal audit Category:Risk management software Category:Information technology audit Category:Computer-aided audit tools Category:Business software ","title":"GRC Envelop"},{"id":"54205782","text":"The 2005 Asian Canoe Sprint Championships was the 11th Asian Canoe Sprint Championships and took place from December 17‚Äì20, 2005 in Putrajaya, Malaysia. ==Medal summary== Men { - C-1 200 m    - C-1 500 m    - C-1 1000 m    - C-2 200 m  Kaisar Nurmaganbetov Alexandr Dyadchuk  Asnawir Roinadi  Rustam Mirzadiyarov Maksim Kiryanov - C-2 500 m  Kaisar Nurmaganbetov Alexandr Dyadchuk  Jing Ying Xia Zhigang  Rustam Mirzadiyarov Maksim Kiryanov - C-2 1000 m  Kaisar Nurmaganbetov Oleg Bezhnar  Rustam Mirzadiyarov Maksim Kiryanov  Gong Yongjun Pan Meibing - C-4 200 m  Kaisar Nurmaganbetov Oleg Bezhnar Alexandr Dyadchuk Andrey Rodin  Gong Yongjun Ma Xiaojie Meng Guanliang Wang Bing  Sirvan Ahmadi Omid Khoshkhoo Elias Eghlimi Aziz Seifi - C-4 500 m  Ma Xiaojie Gong Yongjun Wang Bing Meng Guanliang  Vadim Menkov Rustam Mirzadiyarov Maksim Kiryanov Gerasim Kochnev  Kaisar Nurmaganbetov Oleg Bezhnar Alexandr Dyadchuk Andrey Rodin - C-4 1000 m  Maksim Kiryanov Gerasim Kochnev Rustam Mirzadiyarov Vadim Menkov  Jing Ying Xia Zhigang Chen Zhongyun Wang Bing  Ryota Kojima Makoto Iwasaki Yuichi Yoshizawa Koji Maruyama - K-1 200 m    - K-1 500 m    - K-1 1000 m    - K-2 200 m  Dmitriy Torlopov Dmitriy Kaltenberger  Naoki Onoto Momotaro Matsushita  Mikhail Tarasov Sergey Borzov - K-2 500 m  Dmitriy Torlopov Dmitriy Kaltenberger  Li Zhen Liu Haitao  Babak Samari Mohsen Milad - K-2 1000 m  Dmitriy Torlopov Dmitriy Kaltenberger  Naoki Onoto Junji Matsuda  Nam Sung-ho Kim Sun-bok - K-4 200 m  Mohsen Milad Babak Samari Reza Raeisi Abbas Sayyadi  Li Zhen Liu Haitao Cang Huiting Zhou Jianqing  Keigo Kobayashi Tetsuya Kakuta Yasuhiro Suzuki Takahiko Eguchi - K-4 500 m  Mikhail Tarasov Sergey Borzov Danila Turchin Aleksey Babadjanov  Reza Raeisi Mohammad Ali Moradpour Yaser Hedayati Abbas Sayyadi  Han Lei Zhao Xu Lin Yongjing Zhou Jianqing - K-4 1000 m  Mikhail Tarasov Sergey Borzov Danila Turchin Aleksey Babadjanov  Dmitriy Torlopov Dmitriy Kaltenberger Yevgeniy Alexeyev Sergey Sergin  Li Zhen Zhou Peng Lin Yongjing Zhou Jianqing } Women { - K-1 200 m    - K-1 500 m    - K-1 1000 m    - K-2 200 m  Shinobu Kitamoto Mikiko Takeya  Yelena Parfyonova Inna Popova  Maria Mekheda Yuliya Borzova - K-2 500 m  Xu Yaping Yang Yali  Shinobu Kitamoto Mikiko Takeya  Yelena Parfyonova Inna Popova - K-2 1000 m  Xu Yaping Yang Yali  Lee Sun-ja Lee Ae-yeon  Shinobu Kitamoto Mikiko Takeya - K-4 200 m  Wang Feng Yang Jian Zhang Jinmei Zhu Minyuan  Yuliya Borzova Maria Mekheda Ekaterina Shubina Olga Umaralieva  Azusa Tsuna Suzuko Masutani Saki Hamano Ayaka Kuno - K-4 500 m  Zhu Minyuan He Jing Wang Feng Yang Jian  Yuliya Borzova Olga Umaralieva Maria Mekheda Ekaterina Shubina  Lee Sun-ja Ahn Ji-eun Shim Young-ae Lee Ae-yeon - K-4 1000 m  Wang Feng He Jing Wang Xiaoyan Wang Qun  Lee Sun-ja Ahn Ji-eun Shim Young-ae Lee Ae-yeon  Yuliya Borzova Maria Mekheda Olga Umaralieva Ekaterina Shubina } ==Medal tableReferences== *Results Canoe Sprint Championships Asian Canoe Sprint Championships Category:Asian Canoeing Championships Category:International sports competitions hosted by Malaysia ","title":"2005 Asian Canoe Sprint Championships"},{"id":"54205812","text":"Juho Hyv√§rinen (born 27 March 2000) is a Finnish footballer who plays on the wing as a defender and midfielder for RoPS. ==References== Category:Living people Category:2000 births Category:Finnish footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Veikkausliiga players Category:Rovaniemen Palloseura players ","title":"Juho Hyv√§rinen"},{"id":"54205829","text":"Mohammad-Kazem Anbarlouei () is an Iranian conservative politician and journalist.

After studies in the Theological Faculty of the University of Athens and parochial responsibilities in Munich, he served in various positions within the Patriarchate of Alexandria culminating in that of Metropolitan of Axum covering Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa. Fouiyas' studies and encounters led to a favourable understanding of the Church of England which he saw in some respects as a continuator of the Saxon Church before the Norman Conquest, the Gregorian Reform and most importantly the East‚ÄìWest Schism of 1054. He was thus seen as the ideal candidate for the post of archbishop in London. Several years experience however of deepening division within Anglicanism led him openly to suggest (in an article in The Times) that the road to unity for Anglicans lay in submission to the discipline of the Roman Catholic church. As his post involved close relations with Lambeth it was judged expedient that he should be recalled.

The agreement was reached in the context of the Entente cordiale between the two countries, ending a period of tension and competition over territories in Africa, and based on the principle of freedom of navigation along the length of the Niger. Each leased territory amounted to approximately 47 hectares (less than 0.2 square miles) and was designated for the unloading, storing and transshipping of goods, with residents confined to staff employed for these purposes together with their families and servants. The lease was for a renewable period of thirty years in each case, and included conditions such as a requirement to enclose the area and to forbid retail trading. The annual rent was set at one franc per year. The enclaves were mentioned in French textbooks in 1926M.Fallex et A.Mairey, La France et ses colonies (classe de premi√®re), Delagrave, 1926 : ¬´ la France poss√®de deux enclaves dans la Nig√©ria britannique, avec entrep√¥ts et appontements : Badjibo et la rivi√®re Forcados, sur le bas Niger ¬ª. and described as unoccupied in 1929.Bintou Sanankoua (ed).

Although not signed until 1903, the lease was deemed to run for thirty years from 28 June 1900 and the leased area remained under the law then in force in the British Southern Nigeria Protectorate.Sir E. Hertslet, The Map of Africa by Treaty, Routledge, 2012 p. 814 == Badjibo == The Badjibo enclave (not to be confused with the place of the same name in Gabon) was located at the confluence of the Niger with the much smaller Doko,Michael J. Strauss, Territorial Leasing in Diplomacy and International Law, Brill, 2015 p.246 about 36 km upstream from Jebba and downstream from the Boussa rapids where Mungo Park died. It consisted of a parcel of land in the shape of a parallelogram, with a waterfront of 400m and a depth of 200m, opposite the village of Badjibo. It was next to Fort Arenberg, founded in 1895 by Georges Joseph Tout√©e and named in honour of Auguste d'Arenberg before being abandoned. For this reason it is sometimes referred to as the Arenberg enclave.http://scans.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/7/12/lafriquepolitiqu00bonn/lafriquepolitiqu00bonn.pdf accessed 2/6/2017 Though not signed until 1903, the lease was deemed to have taken effect on 5 June 1900 and the enclave remained under the law then in force under the British Northern Nigeria Protectorate.Sir E.

He sat as MP for Askeaton, County Limerick in the Irish House of Commons in the Parliament of 1695‚Äì99. He was the owner of Drumcondra Castle, Dublin. He is chiefly remembered today for giving the land to create Ireland's first Jewish cemetery at Ballybough, Dublin. Chichester Phillips was born in Balsham, Cambridge, England in 1647 to Chichester Phillips and Susannah Warner, daughter of the Reverend Thomas Warner, vicar of Balsham, and his wife Anne Eaton. The Phillips family had a long-standing connection with Ireland: Chichester's grandfather Sir Thomas Phillips played a key part in the Plantation of Ulster. He founded the town of Limavady in 1610 and held lands at Coleraine: he was governor of the County of Coleraine.Horning, Audrey Ireland in the Virginian Sea ‚Äì Colonialism in the British Atlantic University of North Carolina Press 2013 pp. 216-7 Sir Thomas died in London in 1636, leaving the Limavady estates to his eldest son Dudley. The junior branch of family later settled in Dublin, where Chichester's father died in 1656. His mother remarried Sir Symon Eaton; she died in 1701. He married Sarah Handcock, daughter of William Handcock, MP for Westmeath and Abigail Stanley, in Longford, August 17th, 1685.Mosley, Charles ed.

Two of their sons became Church of Ireland clergymen: Rev. Charles Phillips became Rector of Kilcolman, Co. Cork, and Rev. Marmaduke Phillips MA (TCD) DD served in Inniscarra and Matehy, County Cork. He was listed as an alderman of Dublin in 1696 and served in several regiments of foot as an ensign, lieutenant and captain. His last military appointment was as a captain in the Earl of Granard's Regiment of Foot under the colonelcy of Edward Brabazon, 4th Earl of Meath. After the Glorious Revolution he took the side of William of Orange against James II of England. In 1691, as a reward for his loyalty to William's cause, the Commissioners for Forfeited Estates sold him lands at Killucan and Rathwire in County Westmeath which had been forfeited by the O'Mulledy family.D'Alton, John King James's Irish Army List.

It usually serves multiple purpose at once, including crash injury protection, deflecting sun, precipitation or debris, keeping the rider warm, cool or hydrated, increasing visibility, expressing the rider's style or social identity, stowing cargo, and as a platform for wearable or embedded devices like wireless intercoms, GPS navigation devices, cell phones, or helmet-mounted displays. == Crash protection == A collection of motorcycle helmets worn by Moto GP racer Valentino Rossi For crash protection, helmets are often the first piece of gear a rider chooses, and in many jurisdictions, the only one required by law. Beyond that, crash protection comes in the form of motorcycle boots, jackets, leathers, gloves and - most recently - airbags. Research by de Rome et al found that abrasion resistance, impact protection and seam burst strength are required for garments to offer effective protection.de Rome L, Ivers R, Fitzharris M, Du W, Haworth N, Heritier S, Richardson D. Motorcycle protective clothing: protection from injury or just the weather? Accid Anal Prev. 2011 Nov;43(6):1893-1900. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2011.04.027. Epub 2011 May 28. == Weather == Most protective garments double as protection from the wind blast while riding, and from every kind of weather, keeping the rider warm, cool, and dry, either with passive insulation and ventilation, or active heating or cooling devices. Some motorcycle armor is minimalist in design, serving only to protect from crash impacts and abrasion, and so is intended to be combined with other clothing. == Appearance == Motorcycling gear is also designed with appearance in mind, often to make drivers more likely to see the rider, increasing conspicuity, by combining elements of high-visibility clothing with the weather and crash protection functions of rider clothing, helmets and other items. Selling these items to riders, comprising at least $1.15 billion (clothing) plus $1.2 billion (accessories including helmets and other equipment) of the $21.5 billion (2004) US motorcycle industry, depends on both practical and aesthetic appeal. Fashion and style drive these sales as much as utility, and an entirely separate category of motorcycle-inspired fashion exists in addition to the motorcycle-specific clothing industry, of motorcycle-inspired jackets and other items sold in general retail outlets, intended for non-riders. Helmets, jackets and other clothing may also display designs, text and images to identify the rider or his group, such as club insignia, police, fire and other utility riders, or as adverting space for the logos of motorcycle sport sponsors. == Other purposes == Rider clothing may also be made with storage in mind, providing a variety of pockets including those for holding and displaying maps, smartphones, GPS navigation devices, and other wearables, or accommodating Bluetooths or CB radio two-way communication devices, often built into helmets with wiring routed through specialized clothing. Helmet-mounted displays may be included as well, along with visors that protect the face from wind or debris, and filter sunlight with permanent, movable, or variable visors. ==Notes== {{Reflistrefs= (2008 2nd ed. ) <!-- <ref name= Category:Motorcycle safety gear Category:Motorcycle apparel ","title":"Motorcycle riding gear"},{"id":"54206085","text":"Donnie Levister (born April 19, 1976) is an American professional stock car racing driver. == Racing career ==  Early years  Levister began his racing career on dirt tracks near his hometown of Winnsboro, South Carolina.

After selling their interest in the firm in 2002, Baron continues to work in the legal field with her firm, Baron and Blue, and maintains a private consultancy in jury selection and forensic psychology. In 2012, she was elected Vice-President of the American Association for Justice and began her leadership of the organization in 2014 when she moved to Washington D.C. She became a top fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential Campaign, hosting events at her Dallas estate in Preston Hollow. Baron is also a Democratic Party fundraiser for local and state elections. In 2001, she was named one of the top fifty female litigators in the United States by the National Law Journal, and later as one of its \\"Top 100 Most Influential Lawyers in America.\\" In 2015, she was inducted into the U.S. Trial Lawyers Hall of Fame. Baron has co-authored numerous articles on jury selection as well as four books. One of the most well-known names in jury selection in Texas and across the United States, The American Association for Justice notes that Blue's 2004 book, Blue's Guide to Jury Selection, is \\"considered the 'bible' of jury selection.\\" == Personal life == She was married to attorney Fred Baron from 1980 until his death from cancer in 2008.

This was a board of the college of the vigintiviri, or Board of twenty (later briefly the Board of twenty-six), vigintisexviri. The title was abbreviated III. VIR. AAAFF. or even III. VIR. A.P.F. (tresviri ad pecuniam feriundam) on the coinage itself. These men were collectively known as the tresviri monetales or sometimes, less correctly, as the triumviri monetales. The singular is triumvir monetalis.Melville Jones 1999:Mint magistrates In English, they are most correctly called mint magistrates, since 'moneyers' may imply that they actually struck the coins themselves. In the early times of the Republic, there are few records of any officers who were charged with the superintendence of the mint, and there is little respecting the introduction of such officers apart from a very vague statement from Pomponius.Digest, i. 2 ¬ß 30: \\"At the same time Quatuorviri also were appointed who had supervision of the highways, and Triumviri, who had control of the mint, who melted bronze, silver, and gold, and capital Triumviri, who had charge of the prisons, so that when it was necessary to inflict punishment it might be done by their agency.\\" It was thought by NiebuhrHistory of Rome, iii. p. 646. that they were introduced at the time when the Romans first began to coin silver, in 269 BC, but modern authors consider this too precise a reading of Pomponius.Burnett, Coinage in the Roman World, p. 20. It is known that a college of three was in existence c. 150 BC.Melville Jones, Dictionary of Ancient Roman Coins, p. 188. A fourth magistrate was briefly added by Julius Caesar in 44 BC during a time when the mint output was particularly large (in preparation for a war against Parthia). These magistrates were responsible for the production of the Roman coinage. They were not simple mint workers (monetarii), they were officials who controlled the process, including the design on the coins themselves. Membership in the vigintisexvirate was for most of them the first step on the cursus honorum, the age when the post could be held appears to have been approximately 30, although some held it at a greater ageHarlan, Roman Republican Moneyers, p. XIV. and there is some evidence that the position was appointed rather than elected.Burnett, The Authority to Coin. Some coins appear to have been special issues bearing the legend S C or EX S. C. (ex senatus consulto). Some of these special issues do not bear the signature of a triumvir monetalis, but the inscription CVR. X. FL. i. e. curator denariorum flandorum, or are signed by praetors (P), aediles (CVR AED), or quaestors (Q). During the Roman Empire, this appears on the bronze coinage only (except during the first few years of hero's reign, when it is also found on the precious metal coinage), and it suggests that although the emperor kept the minting of gold and silver coins under his own authority, the Senate, as a sop to its pride, was allowed to retain nominal authority over bronze coinage. In any case, the magistrate's control of the legend on the coinage lent itself to the production of coins containing political messages. This was self- advertising to further the political career of the moneyers themselves (or their families) or that of their patrons; in a word, propaganda.Luce, \\"Political Propaganda on Roman Republican Coins\\". ==List of moneyers== :This article incorporates text from Smith 1875, which is in the public domain.

After the war, his daughter Margaret Harsh founded a private all-girl school in the house known as the Alberta School. In 1921, the house was purchased by Mr Fessenden, the owner of the Fessenden Coal Company. It was later inherited by his wife, Sallie Barry Fessenden. After her death, it became the Wilson County Museum. The museum is open from 1PM to 4PM every Sunday.

After the American Civil War, he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he resumed his legal practice and was elected a judge before his death and burial in St. Louis. ==Early and family life== Descended from the First Families of Virginia, Robert Cowen was born in Staunton, Virginia on November 9, 1830 to Arthur Cowan (1807‚Äì1879) and his wife, the former Elizabeth Floyd who married in Monongalia County, Virginia on August 9, 1829. Cowen's ancestors had moved from northern Ireland to Pennsylvania early in the 18th century, and by the American Revolutionary War were attempting to settle in the Shenandoah and Clinch River valleys.The household of nine free white persons (5 under age ) in Harrison County, Virginia (later West Virginia) in 1840 included no slaves, nor does this Arthur Cowan appear to have owned slaves in 1860 They had at least three sons: Robert E.

While the legislature was not in session, Cowan lived and practiced in Kingwood the county seat of Preston County (in what became West Virginia after the American Civil War). Beginning in 1857, Preston County voters elected Cowen as one of two men to represent them (part-time) in the Virginia House of Delegates. He first won election alongside J. C. Kemble in 1857, and re-election in 1859 alongside John Scott (Virginia), and during most of the American Civil War served as that county's only delegate in Richmond.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 pp.466, 471 Months after the Virginia Secession Convention expelled Unconditional Unionists William G.

Major A.G. Regar recommended him for the job, and he was appointed on January 26, 1862 as of January 18.

Formed in 1862 to facilitate the trading of mining stocks as the San Francisco Stock Exchange, the Chicago Tribune described the exchange as \\"once the West's most flamboyant financial institution.\\" It sold the name San Francisco Stock Exchange to the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange in December 1927 and was renamed the San Francisco Mining Exchange. The exchange agreed to deal solely in mining securities as part of the same deal, and also sold its building at 350 Bush Street to the San Francisco Curb Exchange. After years of ups and downs in the mining market, the exchange had \\"a second life\\" during the uranium boom of the 1950s. By August 1967, it was located in second-floor offices on Montgomery Street, at which point it was the smallest securities market in the United States and had suffered \\"years of lingering legal and money ailments.\\" The exchange closed at the age of 105 in August 1967. ==History== Formation According to the Chicago Tribune, the exchange was founded after the discovery of Nevada's Cornstock lode, and on September 11, 1862, forty founders each paid $50 to form a central market for gold and silver shares. After years of ups and downs in share value, by 1872 the 40 original memberships had increased to 80, with a value of $43,000 per seat. Trading declined in the 1880s, but increased again in the early 1920s after an increase in market speculation and trading. In response to the increase, the Mining Exchange hired Miller & Pflueger to design a building at 350 Bush Street. The building opened in 1923, and was a trading hall for mining commodities until 1928. 1927-1928: Restructuring By April 23, 1927, the San Francisco Stock Exchange, mining division, and the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange were negotiating over the establishment of the Stock and Bond Exchange as a purely listed market, and the San Francisco Stock Exchange as a curb exchange. To prevent naming confusion, there were talks to have the SF Stock Exchange be named the San Francisco Curb Exchange or Association, with the name 'San Francisco Stock Exchange' to become the property of the Stock and Bond Exchange. After earlier reports, in December 9, 1927, it was reported that an agreement to re-organize the San Francisco Stock Exchange had been authorized, with changes to take place immediately. The exchange was renamed the San Francisco Mining Exchange and agreed to deal solely in mining securities, while the name San Francisco Stock Exchange was sold to the Stock and Bond Exchange. Also, the old building occupied by the original San Francisco Stock Exchange was put for sale. The new San Francisco Curb Exchange took over the \\"splendid plant on Bush Street of the old Mining Exchange\\" at the 350 Bush Street building, and started activities in the building on January 2, 1928 as the third security markets in the city. Later years In 1939, George Flach became the exchange's final president. The Chicago Tribune described the exchange as \\"once the West's most flamboyant financial institution.\\" After years of ups and downs in the mining market, the exchange had \\"a second life\\" during the uranium boom of the 1950s. By August 1967, it was located in second-floor offices on Montgomery Street, at which point it was the smallest securities market in the United States and had suffered \\"years of lingering legal and money ailments.\\"It also only had two remaining active brokers: Flach and Raymond Broy, a treasurer with the company since 1933. When Broy wanted to retire due to age and sickness, Flach decided to quit the exchange as well. The exchange closed at the age of 105 in August 1967. It closed of its own accord, although the Securities and Exchange commission had five and a half years earlier ordered it to close. Flach stated that the exchange had \\"successfully resisting government revocation of our registration,\\" but that the exchange was closing due to low trading volume. After the final gong was rung at the second-level trading floor on the southeast corner of Montgomery Street at Pine Street, the doors were padlocked on August 15 at the close of business. ==See also== *Regional stock exchange *List of San Francisco Designated Landmarks *List of former stock exchanges in the Americas *List of stock exchange mergers in the Americas *History of San Francisco ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Former stock exchanges in the United States Category:19th century in San Francisco ","title":"San Francisco Mining Exchange"},{"id":"54206335","text":"The Capitol North Historic District in Cheyenne, Wyoming is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

He also appeared in two international matches, for The League of Ireland, and for Ireland B. ==Club career== Dundalk Coming from a family engaged with Gaelic football, as a junior Gavin initially played for Naomh Mhuire, and then for a 1947 cup winning Wolfe Tones team, and in the same year for Louth GAA Minors and soon for the senior side. After his first senior game in the National League he was signed up by Dundalk F.C. and into the world of football. Initially he played in the reserves, making his full debut against Transport on 9 April 1949. Doncaster Rovers Peter Doherty signed him for second division club Doncaster Rovers in October 1949. There was a large Irish contingent at the club at that time including Harry Gregg who he shared digs with, and whom became a long-term friend. It wasn't until 15 February 1954 that Gavin broke into the first 11 following an injury to Len Graham, making his debut in a 0‚Äì1 home defeat by Bury. He played six more league games that season, and seventeen the following season often as a replacement for Graham at left back, but also filling in at half back. In 1955‚Äì56, he was again second in line behind Graham, only playing twelve games, however he did score his only Doncaster goal in that season. It was during a home game against Lincoln City on 27 December, the day after playing them away at Sincil Bank, and Rovers were winning 1‚Äì0 when a penalty was awarded. The regular penalty taker, Bobby Herbert, wasn't playing so Gavin took it and scored in front of the 18,323 Belle Vue crowd. The following season he played 38 League games, filling in for the injured Morgan Hunt at right half, and then similarly in the left half position, scoring four times, three of those from the penalty spot. In 1957‚Äì58 he played mainly at left half in 35 League matches scoring no goals, not helped by Tommy Cavanagh having the penalty taker role, and it being a poor season for Doncaster who ended up at the bottom of the league, and relegated. The next season, in the newly formed Division Three, Rovers ended up third to the bottom and relegated again. He played 38 League games that season. Gavin's final season at Doncaster was in Division Four. He only played 9 times, his last appearance being a 0‚Äì2 home defeat against Rochdale on 6 February 1960 in front of 3,740 fans. Before retiring to amateur football at the end of the season, he had made 156 League and FA Cup appearances for the club, scoring 5 goals. On leaving Rovers, he continued playing football as an amateur for Doncaster United until an ankle injury ended his playing career. ==International career== In 1953 Gavin was in a League of Ireland team, marking Tom Finney, that lost 0‚Äì2 against an English Football League side in front of 40,000 at Dalymount Park, Dublin. Gavin appeared in the very first Irish B team in an international friendly against Romania B on 20 October 1957, which was drawn 1‚Äì1. ==Personal life== Despite having completed his coaching course at Lillisall in 1956, Gavin did not pursue coaching after his playing career ended. In 1958 he married Maureen Massarella, niece of Ronnie Massarella OBE, ice cream magnate and manager of the British Show Jumping Team. On retiring from playing professional football, Gavin was invited to manage Yeovil Town but instead he opted to work in his father in law's business, managing a depot in Chesterfield. Later, he managed and developed a couple of grocery stores in Doncaster until his retirement at the age of 68. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People from Drogheda Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Association footballers from County Louth Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Dundalk F.C. players Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:Republic of Ireland B international footballers Category:League of Ireland players Category:English Football League players Category:Gaelic footballers who switched code ","title":"Paddy Gavin"},{"id":"54206371","text":"John F.

He was involved with many high-profile cases as a detective with the Massachusetts State Police and later served as Massachusetts' Commissioner of Public Safety and Director of Civil Defense. ==Early life== Stokes was born on January 7, 1889 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He left school at the age of sixteen to become a steamfitter. ==Law enforcement== Cambridge Police Department and military service In 1911, Stokes joined the Cambridge Police Department as a patrolman. He left the force in September 1917 to enlist in the United States Army. He quickly rose to the rank of sergeant and was sent to officers' training school. He was then commissioned as a second lieutenant. Stokes was stationed at Camp Devens with an infantry division when World War I ended. After the war, Stokes returned to the Cambridge Police Department. Massachusetts State Police In the fall of 1920, Stokes became a detective with the Massachusetts State Police. As state police detective, Stokes helped solve the murder of Grayce M. Asquith, the Millen-Faber Case, the kidnapping of Peggy McMath, and the Kennedy Jewel robberies. In 1937, he and Attorney General Paul A. Dever conducted one of the largest racketeering investigations in the state's history following the murder of Louis Gaeta. Stokes was once described by Leverett Saltonstall as the \\"greatest detective in the east\\". In September 1934, Public Safety Commissioner Daniel Needham promoted Stokes to chief of detectives. Commissioner of Public Safety In 1941, Stokes became acting Commissioner of Public Safety after Eugene M. McSweeney became seriously ill. In 1942, he selected a five-story building at 1010 Commonwealth Avenue in Brookline to be the new headquarters of the Massachusetts State Police and oversaw the move from the old headquarters at Commonwealth Pier. On March 30, 1943, McSweeney resigned and Stokes was chosen by Governor Leverett Saltonstall to succeed him. Stokes was the first career law enforcement officer to become Commissioner of Public Safety. In 1946, he was reappointed by outgoing governor Maurice J. Tobin.  Massachusetts Civilian Defense Agency In July 1950, Governor Paul A. Dever chose Stokes to the run the newly-created Massachusetts Civilian Defense Agency. He planned on retiring after the cleanup of the 1953 Worcester tornado was complete, however he remained on longer after the man nominated to succeed him, Henry Parkman Jr., was offered the position of assistant United States High Commissioner in Germany by president Dwight D. Eisenhower. Upon retiring, Stokes waived his $9,750 pension in favor of a $6,500 retirement allowance on the grounds that his appointment as Civil Defense Director was meant to be temporary, therefore his pension should be based on his final salary as Public Safety Commissioner. ==Death== Stokes died suddenly on January 1, 1963 at his home in Belmont, Massachusetts. ==References== Category:1899 births Category:1963 deaths Category:American military personnel of World War I Category:American municipal police officers Category:American state police officers Category:People from Belmont, Massachusetts Category:People from Cambridge, Massachusetts ","title":"John F.

He works between Woodstock, NY and Paris, France. Through a visual language drawn from nature his work refers to mythological narratives and the sublime. ==Early life and education== Wagner was born in Evanston, Illinois. He graduated from Northwestern University, Illinois, and Sciences Po, Paris, France, with a double bachelor's degree in Theatre and Political Science in 2005. He continued his education in film at the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 2007. ==Artwork== Wagner's medium include video, sound, sculpture, performance and photography, which he exhibits through installations, site-specific projects, film, monumental photography and opera. Through the visual language of nature, his work references music, mythology and the romantic. Antoine Wagner, Interference #1, (2016) Wagner's multifaceted practice has created an entire visual language to engage the audience in communicating with nature. Abstract unseen anthropomorphic shapes found in nature and minerals are the main actors of this world of mythologies and cyclical redundancies. Through different medium and projects, the artist examines the themes of identity, geography and spirituality and offers to the viewer an escape from traditional geographic and artistic boundaries. Through his exhibitions including Exil (Museum am Rothenbaum, 2013), Kundry (La Filature de Mulhouse 2015), Wagner applied his experience in the moving image to photography, exploring the possibilities of narrative in a silent and motionless environment through large-scale abstract photography. In 2018, Wagner directed Act II of the Opera Die Walkure at Frank Gehry‚Äôs New World Center in Miami. Wagner‚Äôs site-specific multimedia installation Sentimental Analysis (April 2019) is a response to the legend of Ara the Beautiful at The National Gallery of Armenia.

Reverse spherification is a method of molecular gastronomy. This method is similar to spherification, different in that it is used to enclose liquid containing alcohol content, as well as liquid with calcium content such as milk and yogurt. When the liquid containing alcohol or calcium salt is dropped into an alginate bath, the liquid will draw itself into a spherical shape and becomes encapsulated by the gel-like membrane formed by the cross-linking of the calcium ions and the alginate polymer strands. Larger spheres can be created using reverse spherification. After removing the jelly from the alginate bath, calcium would not continue to diffuse into the center of the sphere, therefore would not create a gel center. Longer storage time could be obtained for this product accordingly. Both the liquid for consumption and the alginate bath should be left to stand after preparing to eliminate air bubbles. Air bubbles inside the liquid could result in the inability of the flavourful liquid to sink when dropping into the alginate bath, creating uneven skin and weak spots in the skin. ==Important factors for Reverse Spherification== Yogurt with its high calcium content, is an example of a liquid that can be used for Reverse Spherification. There are two factors that need to be or can be adjusted for successful Reverse Spherification. The first is the amount of free calcium ions and density of the liquid to be made for spherification. The amount of free calcium ions needs to be sufficient in order to form a gel-like capsule reaction with sodium alginate. Milk based products such as cream, yogurt or milk already have a sufficient amount of calcium. However, conducting reverse spherification with a liquid containing insufficient calcium ion concentrations, calcium salt could be added to the liquid; for example, calcium lactate gluconate could be added to a liquid to produce a 2% concentration in the liquid creating an effective solution for conducting reverse spherification. Calcium ions from calcium lactate is responsible for providing a gelling process without increasing the pH of the food to be too high and the gel will not melt once heated. Secondly, the density of the liquid needs to be adjusted in order to allow the sufficient surface tension to form a spherical shape. Xanthan gum can be used in order to increase the viscosity of the liquid. Usually, the concentration of Xanthan Gum ranges between 0.2% and 0.5%. ==References External links == * Demonstration of reverse spherification Category:Molecular gastronomy ","title":"Reverse spherification"},{"id":"54206450","text":"The Baxter Ranch Headquarters Buildings, at 912-922 E. 18th St. and 1810-1920 Morrie Avenue in Cheyenne, Wyoming, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

The church is a grade II listed building. ==History== The parish was created in 1872 when it was taken out of the parish of St John's Church, Darlington. The plans for the new church were drawn up in 1873 by the architects Ross and Lamb of Darlington and the foundation stone was laid by the Mayor of Darlington, H.F. Pease on 14 April 1875. Simpson and Cowling were the contractors responsible for the masonry. The joinery was undertaken by R.T. Smith. The slating was given to Pattison and Son and the plumbing and glazing to R. Smith. The clerk of works was Mr. Davison. All of the contractors were local employers. The church was built in a cruciform shape with an aisleless nave. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Durham Rt Revd Charles Baring on 30 August 1876. On 28 April 1952, the church was designated a grade II listed building. Present day In 2012, the parish priest and at least 50 members of the congregation left St James' and the Church of England to join the Ordinariate of the Roman Catholic Church. The parish stands in the Traditional Catholic tradition of the Church of England. As it rejects the ordination of women, the church receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Beverley (currently Glyn Webster). ==Organ== A pipe organ was installed in 1900 by Lewis and Co and dedicated on 28 June 1900 by the vicar of Darlington, Revd. F.W. Mortimer. The specification can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. This organ was later sold to St Andrew‚Äôs Church, Ingleby, Greenhow in North Yorkshire and replaced by an electronic instrument. ==ReferencesExternal links== * A Church Near You entry * Parish website Darlington Darlington Darlington Category:Anglo-Catholic churches in England receiving AEO St James the Great Darlington ","title":"Church of St James the Great, Darlington"},{"id":"54206703","text":"was a mid-Edo period Japanese samurai, and the 6th daimy≈ç of Morioka Domain in northern Japan.

She was catapulted to stardom after she had donned the role of Marjina, a perspicacious maid of Ali Baba, in Dinen Gupta's Blockbuster Marjina Abdulla (1972) opposite Debraj Roy which was a remarkable grosser at box office. She was, then featured in Ashutosh Mukherjee's Nishikanya (1973) opposite Soumitra Chattopadhyay. In 1974, her only venture was Arabinda Mukhopadhyay's Blockbuster Mouchak opposite Ranjit Mallick which was again a major grosser at box office. Her next venture was in the year 1975 , Sunil Bandopadhyay's Kabi opposite Debraj Roy for the second time which failed to create ripples at box office. The Blockbuster Swayamsiddha opposite Ranjit Mallick again which was her last release of that year, was once again a major grosser at box office. Her career faced a major setback when two of her high profile movies of 1976 Hotel Snow Fox and Chander Kachhakachhi flopped in spite of having Uttam Kumar in the main lead although not as hero. Biju Phukan played her hero in the former while Santu Mukherjee played her hero in the later. She made her Bollywood debut with Dulal Guha's Khaan Dost (1976) opposite Shatrughan Sinha that also starred Raj kapoor in a pivotal role, but limited herself to Basu Chatterjee's films only. Mukherjee starred in Safed Jhoot (1977) opposite Vinod Mehra. Both her Bollywood movies as lead did not do well at the Box office. In 1977 she played the first wife of Soumitra Chatterjee in Palash Bandopadhyay's Super hit Bengali Film Pratima while the second wife, the titular role being played by Sumitra Mukherjee. Made on a shoe string budget of only Rs. 3.30 lakh, the movie garnered Rs. 10 lakh in the Box Office. In 1978 she was only seen in two Hindi movies directed by Basu Chatterjee namely Dillagi where she was again cast opposite Shatrughan Sinha and Do Ladke Dono Kadke opposite Navin Nischol but both failed to propel her career in Bollywood further in spite of Dillagi having Dharmendra and Hema Malini in main lead. Throughout 1979 and 1980 she starred in Bengali family dramas like Bhagya Chakra, Bandhan and Sandhi which were just average grosser although Sandhi did an above average business. Her only release in 1981 was the Bengali movie Father where she played a deaf mute rape victim opposite Subhendu Chattopadhyay where she was noted by critics alongside an ensemble cast consisting of Soumitra Chattopadhyay, Sumitra Mukherjee, Ranjit Mallick and Mahua Roychowdhury amongst others. In 1982 she acted in Dinen Gupta directed Oriya movie Jwain Pua opposite Uttam Mohanty which was a remake of her Bengali Blockbuster film Mouchak. Her next release Dujane in 1983 tanked miserably at the box office. After a one song two scenes guest appearance in 1984 movie Prarthana , Mukherjee started shooting for her home production Ranga Bhanga Chand based on Pratibha Basu's novel of the same name in 1984 under the direction of Dinen Gupta. The shooting was 50% completed and was being readied for a release in 1985 when the shooting stopped midway due to differences between Mukherjee and Gupta. The release was delayed by five years as the movie was left in the cans and later revived with Chandra Barot as director. At release Ranga Bhanga Chand was renamed Ashrita. In 1990, upon release Ashrita opposite Kanwaljit Singh gained a Super-hit status as the movie which was made on a budget of Rs. 30 lakhs grossed Rs. 3 crore at the Box Office. Ashrita was the last release of Mukherjee since when she was never seen on silver screen ever. ==Filmography== {  !Year !Film !Language !Director - 1971 !scope=\\"row\\"Shesh Parba Bengali Chitta Bose - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1972 !scope=\\"row\\"Marjina Abdulla Bengali Dinen Gupta - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1973 !scope=\\"row\\"Nishikanya Bengali Ashutosh Bandopadhyay - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1974 !scope=\\"row\\"Mouchak Bengali Arabinda Mukhopadhyay - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1975 !scope=\\"row\\"Kabi Bengali Sunil Bandopadhyay - - !scope=\\"row\\"Swayamsiddha Bengali Sushil Mukhopadhyay - rowspan=\\"3\\" 1976 !scope=\\"row\\"Chander Kachhakachhi Bengali Ashutosh Mukhopadhyay - !scope=\\"row\\"Hotel Snow Fox Bengali Yatrik - !scope=\\"row\\"Khaan Dost Hindi Dulal Guha - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1977 !scope=\\"row\\"Pratima Bengali Palash Bandopadhyay - !scope=\\"row\\"Safed Jhoot Hindi Basu Chatterjee - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1978 !scope=\\"row\\"Dillagi Hindi Basu Chatterjee - !scope=\\"row\\"Do Ladke Dono Kadke Hindi Basu Chatterjee - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1979 !scope=\\"row\\"Bhagya Chakra Bengali Ajoy Biswas - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1980 !scope=\\"row\\"Sandhi Bengali Amal Dutta - !scope=\\"row\\"Bandhan Bengali Manu Sen - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1981 !scope=\\"row\\"Father Bengali Dilip Mukhopadhyay - 1982 !scope=\\"row\\"Jwain Pua Odia Dinen Gupta - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1983 !scope=\\"row\\"Dujane Bengali Ardhendu Chatterjee - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1984 !scope=\\"row\\"Prarthana Bengali Asit Sen - 1990 !scope=\\"row\\"Ashrita Bengali Chandra Barot } ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Living people Category:1955 births Category:20th-century Indian actresses Category:Actresses from Kolkata Category:Actresses in Bengali cinema Category:Indian film actresses ","title":"Mithu Mukherjee (actress)"},{"id":"54206744","text":"Richard Bobbington (died 1697?, name occasionally Philip or Babbington) was a pirate active in the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf in the late 1690s. ==History== Adam Baldridge ran a trading post for pirates off Madagascar, and was willing to double-cross them. In December 1695 John Ireland sailed the sloop Amity into the settlement after the Amity‚Äôs previous captain Thomas Tew was killed raiding Moors alongside Henry Every. Baldridge helped them quickly refit and tipped them off that he‚Äôd traded with and resupplied the Charming Mary shortly before. The Amity sailed after the Charming Mary and captured it, giving its captain Richard Glover the Amity in exchange. Ireland had been the ship‚Äôs master but was not formally captain; the pirates subsequently elected Irishman Richard Bobbington as captain of the Charming Mary. Bobbington sailed back to √éle Sainte-Marie in May 1696 to refit before heading into the Red Sea. In July they raided Tellicherry; Bobbington personally led the shore party to threaten the local East India Company officials into letting them repair and resupply at Company expense. Now with 90 men and 22 guns, in September of that year they took a Moorish ship off Rajapur, killing a great many of the crew in revenge for their stubborn resistance. In December 1696 they sailed into the Persian Gulf near Jask to raid local settlements for supplies, and again Bobbington joined the landing party. The Persians fought back, capturing Bobbington and the shore party. English officials wanted Bobbington extradited to Bombay to answer for crimes against Mughal ships, while the Persians accused the English of robbery after Bobbington declared that he was English. He was never heard from again. The remainder of the crew sailed off in the Charming Mary, possibly with Joseph Skinner as captain, or possibly with no captain at all, John Ireland still serving as master. They sailed alongside Robert Culliford and Ralph Stout in the Mocha for a time, returning to Barbados in 1697 to divide their loot. They appeared again off Madagascar in 1699 under captain William May (Mayes/Mues), who had captained the Pearl during Tew and Henry Every‚Äôs attack on the treasure ship Gunsway. ==See also== *James Plaintain and Abraham Samuel - two other ex-pirates who, like Baldridge, established pirate trading posts at Madagascar ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:17th-century pirates Category:Pirates Category:Piracy in the Indian Ocean ","title":"Richard Bobbington"},{"id":"54206791","text":"RugbyFest UK is an annual event designed to be the biggest celebration of rugby staged outside of a major tournament.

The building was the centre of law, order and government, and served as the county hall for Dorset until 1955. It has been Grade-I listed since 1950. In 2018, the hall opened as the Shire Hall Historic Courthouse Museum. ==History== Shire Hall, which was designed by British architect Thomas Hardwick, was constructed between 1796 and 1797, replacing the original hall that had fallen into disrepair by 1769. Until the new building was completed, the court was based at the Antelope Hotel. One of the most famous trials held at the hall was that of the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1834. The six Dorset agricultural labourers were arrested for swearing a secret oath as members of the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers, which they had formed to bargain for better wages. The rules of the society show it was clearly structured as a friendly society and operated as a trade-specific benefit society. On 18 March 1834, the Tolpuddle Martyrs were sentenced to penal transportation to Australia. The sentence sparked public outrage, resulting in a petition of 800,000 signatures demanding their release and a 100,000-strong demonstration in London. All were pardoned, on condition of good conduct, in March 1836, with the support of Lord John Russell, who had recently become home secretary. There is a plaque on the front of Shire Hall that commemorates 150 years since the trial. English novelist and poet Thomas Hardy also served as a magistrate at Shire Hall. He had been made Justice of the Peace for the Borough of Dorchester from 1884, sitting in court on almost forty occasions from then to 1919. Hardy's experience as a magistrate provided inspiration for his writing. Shire Hall was originally used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of Dorset County Council. Shire Hall continued to operate in its original capacity until 1955, when the new county hall and crown court was opened. In June 2014, planning permission was granted to transform the Shire Hall into a new museum and visitor attraction. The project received ¬£1.5m of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2015, with West Dorset District Council pledging a further ¬£1.1m. Work commenced in 2016, while Christchurch-based company Pride Painting and Decorating Ltd began restoration work in March 2017. The Shire Hall Historic Courthouse Museum opened to visitors on 1 May 2018. The Duke of Gloucester unveiled a plaque, to celebrate the first anniversary of the opening of the museum, in May 2019. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official site D Category:Grade I listed buildings in Dorset Category:1797 establishments in England Category:Buildings and structures in Dorchester, Dorset Category:Government buildings completed in 1797 ","title":"Shire Hall, Dorchester"},{"id":"54206801","text":"Ponta das Bicudas is a headland in the southeastern part of the island of Santiago, Cape Verde.

David Ebersole and Todd Hughes. Mansfield 66/67 is about the last two years of actress Jayne Mansfield's life, and the rumours swirling around her untimely death being caused by a curse, after her alleged romantic dalliance with Anton LaVey, head of the Church of Satan. It is \\"a true story based on rumour and hearsay\\", celebrating Mansfield's life on the 50th anniversary of her death. Documentary interviews with an collection of people including Kenneth Anger, John Waters, Mamie Van Doren, Tippi Hedren, A.J. Benza, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls star Dolly Read, and gender-bending 1980s pop star Marilyn as well as experts are blended with experimental dance numbers, performance art and animation. Paris-based International sales outfit Stray Dogs picked up the film at the International Film Festival Rotterdam. The film's score is composed, produced and recorded by James Peter Moffatt and Robert Davis at Leeds Beckett University. The film was produced by P. David Ebersole, Todd Hughes and Larra Anderson.

Peccadillo Pictures released the film in UK cinemas on April 12, 2018. The title is a reference to the last two years of Mansfield's life. ==Background== Mansfield 66/67 was conceived after writing/directing/producing team P. David Ebersole & Todd Hughes could not get their narrative feature screenplay The Devil Made Her Do It produced and instead decided to follow their previous documentaries Hit So Hard, Room 237 and Dear Mom, Love Cher and present the Mansfield/LaVey story as a documentary. In 2016 Ebersole/Hughes became artists in residence at Leeds Beckett University. More than 100 students and staff from across their School of Film, Music and Performing Arts worked with Ebersole/Hughes in bringing the film to completion. The University invited Ben Wilkins to re-mix the film in Leeds as a Master Class. Ben won an Academy Award in the category Best Sound for Whiplash. He has worked on nearly 150 films since 1991. The University subsequently awarded him an honorary degree. ==Synopsis== 2017 marks the 50th anniversary of Jayne Mansfield‚Äôs fatal and legendary car crash. Defined by her hunger for publicity, on the one hand Jayne was Hollywood Babylon made flesh, with five kids, three messy divorces, and a lurid death that may or may not have been caused by a Satanic curse. On the other hand, she had perfect comic timing, 163 IQ, spoke five languages and was outspokenly anti-war, making her impossible to categorize, though the headlines that her wild life inspired certainly tried: Can A Sex Siren Be A Good Mother, Love Goddess With A Jinx, the Smartest Dumb Blonde... And then there was her reported affair with Anton LaVey, head of the Church of Satan. The handsomely devilish Anton started his ‚Äúchurch‚Äù with a publicist and preached a live and let live lifestyle. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to be a sinner, be the best sinner on the block,‚Äù said Anton and that was music to sex-positive Jayne Mansfield‚Äôs ears. Unfortunately, her then-boyfriend lawyer Sam Brody was sent into a jealous rage and desecrated sacred Satanic talismans in Anton‚Äôs lair, prompting a curse to be put on his head that he would die in a car accident within a year. In 1966 and 1967, Jayne and Sam proceeded to have seven fender benders and near-fatal smash-ups until the one that tragically took both of their lives in a bizarre crash where reporters said alternately Jayne was either beheaded on impact or wig-scalped. ==Cast== * Kenneth Anger * Richmond Arquette * A.

Baird and was sometimes referred to in the press as the \\"Queen of Chess\\". ==Early years and family== Edith Elina Helen Winter-Wood was born at Hareston Manor near Plymouth in the United Kingdom, the daughter of Thomas Winter-Wood, a writer, and Eliza Ann (Sole) Winter-Wood. She learned to play chess early in life as her father, her mother, and her older brothers Edward and Carslake were all either amateur or tournament-level chess players. In 1880 she married W. J. Baird, Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals and Fleets for the Royal Navy. They settled in Brighton, where their only child, Lilian Edith, was born. Lilian also went on to become a chess composer. ==Chess composition== In the mid 1880s, Baird started composing chess problems and within a few years had gained a reputation in the field. In 1888, she took third prize in a Sheffield chess-composition tournament, the first of over two dozen subsequent prizes. Her most celebrated success came in 1893 when she won an international chess-composition tournament against a number of the most notable chess composers of the day. She became the most prolific composer of chess problems in the world, with over 2000 problems to her credit. These were published in newspapers such as the Times of London. Some of these are still considered sound, many are considered elegant, and some are novelties such as letter problems, in which chess pieces have to form the shapes of letters. Baird published two books of her problems: Seven Hundred Chess Problems (1902) and The Twentieth Century Retractor (1907). The first book took her 14 years to complete. As a chess player herself, Baird won the Sussex Ladies Championship in 1897 and a silver medal in the tournament three times. == References  External links == * Category:Chess composers Category:1859 births Category:1924 deaths Category:19th-century British women writers Category:19th-century British writers Category:British chess writers Category:British chess players Category:People from Plymouth Category:20th- century British women writers ","title":"Edith Baird"},{"id":"54207196","text":"Balcells is a surname.

D'Andrea reportedly began his overseas career in Africa, and he is listed as a foreign service officer at the Embassy of the United States in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. D'Andrea previously served as chief of station in Cairo, Egypt and later in Baghdad, Iraq. D'Andrea was reportedly one of the CIA officials who failed to track Nawaf al-Hazmi, who would later participate in the September 11 attacks. D'Andrea became head of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center in 2006, replacing Robert Grenier. During his nine-year tenure, D'Andrea presided over hundreds of American drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, advocating for the program to the United States Congress. In 2015, leadership of the drone program was passed to Chris Wood, following bureaucratic reshuffling by Director John O. Brennan. During his time at the Counterterrorism Center many reporters referred to him only by the codename \\"Roger\\", which was considered unusual for an official not posted overseas. During the hunt for Osama bin Laden, D'Andrea directed an analysis of competing hypotheses as to who, besides Osama bin Laden, could be in the targeted compound in Abbottabad. D'Andrea's operatives also oversaw the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah, Abd al- Rahim al-Nashiri and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, which were criticized in a United States Senate report. He was reportedly involved in the assassination of Hezbollah member Imad Mughniyah in Damascus, Syria. He received much blame for the Camp Chapman attack in Khost, Afghanistan, when seven CIA operatives were killed by a suicide bomber, who was allegedly backed by Pakistan's ISI. D‚ÄôAndrea was deeply involved in the detention and interrogation program, which resulted in the torture of a number of prisoners and was condemned in the Senate report on CIA torture in 2014 as inhumane and ineffective.

During this time, Maza became a district judge in Madrid after having worked in the courts of Alcorc√≥n, Valencia and Cangas de Morrazo. He later was appointed chair of the first chamber of the Madrid Provincial Court and, in 2002, he was appointed Magistrate of the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court replacing Adolfo Prego, who was appointed member of the CGPJ. In addition to his daily work as a magistrate, he also authored several books, including the Handbook of Legal and Forensic Psychiatry, Circumstances that exclude or modify Criminal Responsibility and Criminal Penalty Practices, and other publications related to Criminal Law and the relationship between law and medicine. During his time at the Supreme Court, he worked on many high-profile cases. Maza defended the disqualification of judge Baltasar Garz√≥n,\\"Por √∫ltimo, como magistrado de la Sala II del Tribunal Supremo, a trav√©s de un voto particular defendi√≥ con entusiasmo la inhabilitaci√≥n del juez Baltasar Garz√≥n por abrir una causa que investigara los cr√≠menes del franquismo.\\" from El Plural elplural.com and, in 2007, made it possible to file a case against the former president of the Santander Group, Emilio Bot√≠n. The Council of Ministers nominated Maza as Spain's Attorney General in November 2016, a position he held until his death a year later. On 16 May 2017, the Congress of Deputies censured him as Attorney General for suspicious activity in the Prosecution Ministry that aimed to obstruct certain cases against corruption. Justice Minister Rafael Catal√° and the anti-corruption prosecutor, Manuel Moix, were also reprobated. The latter resigned to his position on 1 June 2017. This reprobation had no binding effects so he continued with his job. ==2017 Spanish constitutional crisis== On September 2017, Maza asked security forces to investigate possible Catalan government preparations to hold an independence voting. He also announced that he would present criminal charges against members of both the regional parliament and government for allowing the referendum. The central government proceeded to deploy a series of legal measures intended to nullify the referendum, while also warning local councils in Catalonia to either impede or paralyse efforts to carry out the vote. On 13 September, he summoned 700 Catalan mayors for their role in the independence referendum.Spain Catalonia: More than 700 mayors summoned to court On 30 October 2017, Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition and embezzlement against Puigdemont, the Bureau of the Parliament, and other Catalan leaders. It transpired that the ousted President and five of his ministers had fled to Belgium, and some had been jailed. ==Death== On 17 November 2017, he was admitted in the Bazterrica Clinic in Buenos Aires for some pain. He died the next day, as a result of a kidney infection complicated by the diabetes he suffered. ==See also== * Judiciary of Spain * Spanish Attorney General * 2017 Spanish constitutional crisis * Operation Anubis ==References== Category:1951 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Judiciary of Spain Category:Attorney general of Spain Category:Spanish judges Category:Spanish prosecutors Category:Prosecutors general of Spain Category:People who died in office ","title":"Jos√© Manuel Maza"},{"id":"54207281","text":"Julien Lehouck (14 August 1896 - 25 February 1944) was a Belgian sprinter.

In a career which ran from November 2016 to October 2020 she ran nineteen times, winning fifteen races including eleven at Group One level. After winning her only race as a two-year-old in 2016 she emerged as the dominant middle-distance horse in Europe in the following year when she won the Cheshire Oaks, Epsom Oaks, Irish Oaks, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Yorkshire Oaks and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As a four-year-old she won the September Stakes, her second Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Breeders' Cup Turf, becoming the first Arc winner to win the Breeders' Cup Turf in the same year. In 2019 she won the Eclipse Stakes and recorded repeat victories in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks before her long unbeaten run came to an end when she finished second to Waldgeist in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As a six-year-old she ran second to Ghaiyyath in the Eclipse before becoming the first horse to win a third King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. In the Autumn of 2020 she won another September Stakes before failing in her second attempt to win a third Prix de l'Arc Triomphe. ==Background== Enable is a bay filly bred in England by her owner Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. She has a large white star and a narrow irregular blaze, a white sock on her left hind leg and smaller white markings on her front feet. She was sent into training with John Gosden at Newmarket, Suffolk. Enable is from the first crop of foals sired by Nathaniel who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2011 and the Eclipse Stakes in the following year. Her dam Concentric showed good form in France, winning a Listed race and finishing second in the Prix de Flore. She is also a full sister to the dam of Flintshire. ==Racing career== 2016: two-year-old season Enable made her only appearance as a two-year-old in a maiden race over one mile on the synthetic Tapeta track at Newcastle Racecourse on 28 November 2016 and started at odds of 7/2 in a field of nine fillies. Ridden by Robert Havlin, she was restrained towards the rear before taking the lead inside the final furlong and drawing away to win by three and three quarter lengths. 2017: three-year-old season Spring Enable began her second season in a minor stakes race over ten furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 21 April when she was partnered by William Buick. Starting at odds of 5/1 she stayed on well in the closing stages to finish third behind her stablemate Shutter Speed and Raheen House. Frankie Dettori took the ride when the filly was stepped up in class and distance to contest the Cheshire Oaks over eleven and a half furlongs at Chester Racecourse on 10 May and was made the 2/1 second choice in the seven-runner field behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Alluringly. After racing in second place, Enable took the lead three furlongs out and went clear of her rivals before being eased down by Dettori to win by one and three quarter lengths. Summer Enable at Churchill Downs in 2018 On 2 June Enable was one of nine fillies to contest the 238th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. The race was run in heavy rain after a thunderstorm struck the course shortly before the start. The Irish filly Rhododendron, ridden by Ryan Moore, was made the 8/11 favourite with Enable second choice in the betting on 6/1 alongside the Godolphin challenger Sobetsu (winner of the Prix Saint-Alary). The other runners included Alluringly, Natavia (Fillies' Trial Stakes), Coronet (Zetland Stakes) and Horseplay (Pretty Polly Stakes). With Dettori again in the saddle, Enable raced in third place before going to the front two furlongs out with Rhododendron emerging as her only serious challenger. In the closing stages Enable drew right away from the favourite to win by five lengths with another six lengths back to Alluringly in third place. After the race Dettori commented \\"When I saw Ryan wasn‚Äôt moving alongside me, I thought I was in trouble, but once I saw his distress signals coming I knew my filly would stay right to the end. She's only run three times, she's very good. She's still a bit of a frame but I think she‚Äôll get better and better.\\" Enable made her next appearance in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh on 15 July. She was partnered by Dettori who had just returned to riding after sustaining an arm injury at Yarmouth on 13 June. She was made the 2/5 favourite ahead of her stablemate Coronet, whilst the other eight runners included Rain Goddess (runner-up in the Pretty Polly Stakes), Alluringly, Intricately (Moyglare Stud Stakes) and Eziyra (C L Weld Park Stakes). After tracking the leader Rain Goddess, Enable went to the front two furlongs out, accelerated away from her rivals and won \\"easily\\" by five and a half lengths. Dettori commented \\"Enable is a very special filly and it was so important to ride her ‚Äì she is a true professional and I think she has improved since Epsom. She has a good turn of foot and put the race to bed\\". Less than two weeks after her win at the Curragh, Enable, with Dettori again in the saddle, was matched against older horses and male opposition in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. She started the 5/4 favourite against nine opponents including Highland Reel, Jack Hobbs, Idaho, Ulysses and My Dream Boat. She raced in second place behind the pacemaker Maverick Wave before going to the front entering the straight. She accelerated several lengths clear of her rivals and never looked in any danger of defeat coming home four and a half lengths clear of Ulysses with Idaho in third place. After the race Dettori, who was riding at his minimum weight of 119 pounds said, \\"I haven‚Äôt had a feeling like that since Golden Horn in the Arc... She's top-drawer and that's three times she's proved it, three times that she's won by a wide margin. I didn‚Äôt want to see a sprint and I knew she stays, so I kicked for home early\\". John Gosden described the winner as being \\"as good a filly as I've ever trained... she just takes the race by the horns\\" before suggesting the Yorkshire Oaks and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe as future targets. As Gosden had predicted, Enable made her next appearance in the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse on 24 August. She went off the 1/4 favourite against five opponents including Queen's Trust (Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf), Nezwaah (Pretty Polly Stakes), Coronet and Alluringly. She took the lead from the start, drew away from the field in the straight and won \\"very readily\\" by five lengths from Coronet. Gosden commented \\"There was no obvious pace so I said to Frankie that he could do his own thing. She got lonely in the last part, she was looking around and idling. It's not her favourite way of racing but she can do it that way. It was a lovely prep for the Arc, and it's a nice run-in now. She‚Äôd be the best mile-and-a-half filly that I‚Äôve trained\\". Autumn On 1 October at Chantilly Racecourse Enable, with Dettori in the saddle, started odds on favourite for Europe's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As she had not been among the original entries her owner had to pay a supplementary fee of ‚Ç¨120,000 to run her in the race. Ulysses and Idaho were again in opposition, whilst the other runners included Order of St George, Winter, Capri, Satono Diamond and Seventh Heaven. After racing in third place the filly took the lead in the straight, went clear of the field and stayed on to win by two and a half lengths from Cloth of Stars. Dettori commented \\"It was too perfect... It happened exactly like I thought and she won like I thought. Usually in an Arc something happens but it was so smooth, so effortless\\" while Gosden added \\"She's really only had one very busy season so there's a possibility she might stay in training next year and go to the new Longchamp. She's truly exceptional, straight out of the top drawer\\". On 16 November 2017 at the Cartier Racing Awards Enable was named Champion Three- year-old Filly and Horse of the Year In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Enable was rated the fifth-best horse in the world and the best three-year-old filly with a rating of 129. 2018: four-year-old season In May 2018 it was announced that Enable had suffered a \\"training setback\\", and would not race as a four-year-old until August at the earliest. On 6 September, Enable made her belated seasonal debut in the September Stakes on the synthetic polytrack surface at Kempton and won by 3¬Ω lengths from Crystal Ocean. After the race Gosden said \\"She's 80 per cent fit, 85 per cent if you had to stretch it. She is in a good place mentally. She loves her racing. It frustrated her when the other horses went out on the Heath every morning and she couldn‚Äôt. It's a hard thing for her to stand around doing nothing\\". Enable prior to winning the Breeders' Cup Turf She was then given a month's break prior to her run in the 2018 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in which she attempted to become the eighth horse, and the first trained in England, to win the race for a second time. She started favourite ahead of Sea of Class, Waldgeist and Kew Gardens while the other fifteen runners included Capri, Cloth of Stars, Talismanic, Study of Man (Prix du Jockey Club) and Clincher (Kyoto Kinen). Nelson set the pace before giving way to Capri in the straight but Enable, having tracked the leaders from the start, moved smoothly into the lead 300 metres from the finish. After looking likely to win easily she came under strong pressure in the last 100 metres but held on to win by a short neck from Sea of Class. Dettori said \\"as we got to the false straight, the life in the old girl came back. I knew then we were in business. I waited as long as I could and, when I said ‚Äòcome on, let's go‚Äô, the trademark turn of foot was there... She wasn't the Enable of last year but she's got the job done\\". John Gosden commented \\"It's not been the preparation we wanted, it has been very difficult, and we had a hiccup between Kempton and here with a slight temperature thing, so it has not been easy. She was not at her best today. I have had a difficult year with her, it is entirely down to the filly and her guts and a lovely ride from Frankie. She has got the job done and it is down to her mind, she is a wonderful filly\\". On her final run of the season, Enable was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs on 3 November in which she attempted to become the first horse to win the race after taking the Arc in the same year (Found won the BC Turf in 2015 and the Arc a year later). She was made the 8/13 favourite ahead of twelve opponents including Waldgeist, Talismanic and Magical from Europe, while the only North American runners given any serious chance were Robert Bruce (Arlington Million) and Channel Maker (Joe Hirsch Turf Classic). After racing in mid- division, Enable moved up on the wide outside on the final turn to take the lead in the straight but was immediately joined by Magical, ridden by Ryan Moore. The two fillies pulled well clear of the rest and at the line Enable prevailed by three quarters of a length with a gap of nine lengths back to the 80/1 outsider Sadler's Joy in third. Explaining the race, Dettori said \\"She didn‚Äôt break that well and then the pace was on straight away. I managed to get out to four off the fence, and then she was moving good again. I was waiting for her to give me the message that she was ready to go, and I could see Magical on my inside. Magical took me on pretty early and then it was a punch-up to see who was the best. She went half a length up and I knew she was fighting for me but Ryan was like a wasp that wouldn‚Äôt go away. The ground made it hard for her today, but she's a superstar\\". At the 2018 Cartier Awards, Enable was named Cartier Champion Older Horse. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Enable was placed eighth, with a rating of 125. 2019: five-year-old season In 2019 Enable missed intended engagements in the Coronation Cup at Epsom and at Royal Ascot before returning to the track for the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park on 6 July. Magical appeared to be her biggest threat, while the other six runners were Regal Reality (Brigadier Gerard Stakes), Telecaster (Dante Stakes), Mustashry, Zabeel Prince, Hunting Horn (Hampton Court Stakes) and Danceteria (La Coupe). Starting the 4/6 favourite Enable tracked the front-running Hunting Horn before taking the lead two furlongs out and held off the challenge of Magical to win by three quarters of a length. She became the third female to win the race after Pebbles and Kooyonga and the first five-year-old mare to take the prize. Frankie Dettori said \\"I'm as ecstatic as when I won my first race on her... Her longevity has been incredible. I never stop getting excited when I ride her in the morning. She's very special. I really love her... She's got so many gears and the unbelievable will to win. She's got everything.\\" Three weeks after her win at Sandown, Enable started at odds of 8/15 as she attempted to repeat her 2017 success in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Her ten opponents included Crystal Ocean, Anthony Van Dyck, Defoe, Waldgeist and Cheval Grand. She raced towards the rear of the field as Norway and Magic Wand set a strong pace before moving up quickly approaching the final turn. Enable took the lead from Crystal Ocean two furlongs out and held off a renewed challenge from the latter in the closing stages to win by a neck with Waldgeist a length and a quarter back in third place. After the race Dettori said \\"At the five [furlong pole], I looked up and thought, the only one I‚Äôve got to beat is Crystal Ocean. I‚Äôve got to get on to his tail. Then [James Doyle on Crystal Ocean] was sitting pretty going really well, so I jumped on him and made a race of it, and I probably took him by surprise. Then he was fighting back and the gloves were off. In fairness he served it up to me and we had a right titanic battle... She is extraordinary and she really surprised me. She's an amazing horse in every way: ability, courageous, uncomplicated.\\" On 22 August only three horses, namely Magical, Lah Ti Dar (Middleton Stakes) and the 100/1 outsider South Sea Pearl, appeared to oppose Enable when she attempted to win a second Yorkshire Oaks. Starting at odds of 1/4 she led from the start, saw off a challenge from Magical in the last quarter mile and won by two and three quarter lengths. The race was regarded as a trial for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and Gosden commented \\"This was a lovely prep for her, a gorgeous race in its own right and we couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with her... She has this amazingly competitive mind. She's just a great filly with a great constitution.\\" On 6 October Enable started the 1/2 favourite as she attempted to record an unprecedented third success in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. After settling in fourth place she went to the front 400 metres from the finish and looked the likely winner but was run down in the final strides by Waldgeist and beaten into second place. After the race Dettori said \\"The ground was very sticky... She just folded a bit and the winner was too good for me today, but my filly was already tired... I think ground had a lot to do with it.\\" On 12 November Enable was named Horse of the Year and Champion Older Horse at the Cartier Awards, taking both honours for the second time. These were her fourth and fifth awards, tying the record set by Frankel. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Enable was given a rating of 128, placing her in a three-way tie for first place alongside Crystal Ocean and Waldgeist. 2020: six-year-old season Enable's first start of 2020 was the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park on 5 July, which, owing to the restructuring of the British flat racing necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic was not open to three-year-olds for the first time in its history. In her attempt to win the race for a second time she started favourite ahead of Ghaiyyath and Japan despite Gosden warning that she was likely to be in need of the race and short of peak fitness. After racing in mid-division she stayed on well in the straight but was unable to reel in the front-running Ghaiyyath and finished second, beaten two and a quarter lengths. Gosden was satisfied with the run, commenting \\"We're delighted with that, she ran a gorgeous race... She enjoyed it and the zest and desire was there, but trying to get involved with a front-running horse like [Ghaiyyath] was never going to be her deal... It was the perfect platform she needed for the King George\\". When Enable attempted to record an unprecedented third victory in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes on 25 July only two horses appeared to oppose her, namely Japan and the 2019 Irish Derby winner Sovereign and the mare went off the 4/9 favourite in a race run behind closed doors in heavy rain. She settled in second place behind Sovereign before moving up to take the lead in the straight and drew away in the final furlong to win \\"easily\\" by five and a half lengths. Frankie Dettori, who was winning the race for a record-equalling seventh time said \\"We tried a variety of things to get the fire back, and that's why John Gosden is a great trainer, he does things outside the box, and we got her back. She's not getting better, but her enthusiasm throughout the race today was plain to see and she's thriving with racing... I love her so much. I‚Äôve become friends with her, she's got tremendous presence and she knows she's good\\". Enable's connections took her to Kempton to attempt a second September Stakes win instead of going to the Yorkshire Oaks or the Juddmonte International. After missing the start, Dettori raced Enable into a lead that she maintained for the rest of the race. She pulled away from Kirstenbosch and the previous year's Melbourne Cup runner up, Prince of Arran, to win by 7 lengths at a starting price of 1-14. Her next start was the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, where she was the 5/4 favourite trying for a record third win in Europe's arguably most prestigious race. But she came sixth in the eleven horse field, not liking the heavy going. ==Retirement== Juddmonte announced Enable's retirement on 12 October 2020. Khalid Abdullah's racing manager, Teddy Beckett, said that Enable had \\"brought so much joy to everyone who has been involved with her\\" and John Gosden stated \\"Enable has retired happy and sound after an extraordinary career.

They first performed in Bayanaul on 1 September 1967. The name of the band was the abbreviation of their names. The band initially positioned as performers of Kazakh folk music and were criticized because they used guitars rather than traditional Kazakh musical instruments and used several vocals simultaneously. On the other hand, they were clearly inspired by contemporary Western groups like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Dos Mukasan became the first Kazakh group playing rock music and the first group trying to create the fusion of rock music and Kazakh folk music. The lineup of the band changed several times. In the end of the 1970s, the period when Dos Mukasan was the most popular, it included Murat Kusainov, Nurtas Kusainov, Bakhyt Dzhumadilov, Askar Dzhankushukov, Bagdad Aydarkhanov, Arsen Bayanov, and Murat Sarybayev. The band stopped performing and disintegrated in the 1990s; Murat Kusainov decided to continue performing with young musicians, however, since 2000 the old lineup of Dos Mukasan returned to perform. In the 1970s, the band won a number of prizes in music festivals in the Soviet Union.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, McKinley began playing with 14-inch softball in the Chicago Park District at age nine.

In 1948, when she was 20, she read an advertisement in the Chicago Tribune and attended a tryout with the All American League in 1948. She made the grade and was assigned to one of the four farm teams operated by the league in Chicago, where she hit a very solid .402 batting average and showed his blazing speed on the bases and the field. In 1949, McKinley joined the league and was assigned to Muskegon. But she had problems hitting the curveball and struggled at the plate. As a result, she hit .099 (10-for-101) and stole seven bases in just 37 games, driving in four runs while scoring ten times. Nevertheless, she was virtually flawless defensively, recording 38 putouts with three assists and turned two double plays, committing only two errors in 43 total chances for a .953 fielding average. Even so, she improved as the season wore on and Lassies manager Carson Bigbee put her in the lineup during the playoffs. Muskegon was undefeated in the best-of-three first round but was swept in the best-of-five second round. Therese appeared in all five playoff games and went 4-for-16 with two runs, one RBI and four stolen bases. At the field, she recorded three putouts without committing an error. She returned home and played more softball before joining the United States Navy during Korean War conflict.

The telenovela follows the story of Victoria a young runner who finds in athletics a way to make sense of her life and will fight to get a place in the Olympics. It stars Paulina Goto, Man√© de la Parra and Andr√©s Palacios . == Plot summary == This story begins twenty-two years ago, when Cecilia, a young woman from a wealthy family, becomes pregnant. She is forced to abandon her daughter, by orders of her parents. After several days, Cecilia leaves her baby at the doors of an hacienda, thinking that her daughter will have a solved future. However, it is not the owners of the hacienda who find Victoria, it is Chencha, the employee. She names the girl Victoria, thinking that her life will be full of victories, and raises her as her daughter. From an early age, Victoria has it clear that, although poor, she is meant to be a runner, and the love of the bold is never lacking, like the love of Andres, the son of the Santib√°√±ez family, owners of the hacienda where Victoria lives. Victoria begins a bitter period of her life after she is unjustly imprisoned at the age of fourteen in the local reformatory. Upon becoming a young adult, she is taken to prison. This was because of Gloria Santib√°√±ez, mother of Andr√©s, who hates her. During these years, Victoria's only motivation was listening to Ra√∫l de la Pe√±a's radio program every night, which always has the most inspiring words and the best advice, in the midst of her sordid and dark reality. In the meantime, Andr√©s has two goals. The first is to achieve Victoria's freedom, for which he studies law and graduates with honors. After this, he tries to achieve his second goal, and it is to gain Victoria's love. Victoria is carried away by her feelings and marries Andres, but very soon realizes that she feels trapped again, because Gloria makes her life impossible. At that moment, she follows the beat of her heart and goes to Mexico City to pursue her dream, which is to become a professional athlete. In the capital, Victoria meets Raul de la Pe√±a, whom she had admired since she listened to his radio program in jail. Besides dedicating himself to the locution, Ra√∫l is a doctor of the Olympic Committee, and it is right there that Victoria gets to work in the pursuit of her greatest desire. Ra√∫l loves Victoria since he met her, and wants to take care of and protect her. Ra√∫l is the same with Elsa, his daughter, who is actually his niece, but he loves her as if he were her father, because his brother gave her to him at a young age. Andr√©s understands too late that Victoria is not a woman to have tied to an hacienda, since she has already lost many years of freedom. Andr√©s annulles their marriage after being taken over with jealousy and Victoria has the opportunity to make her life with Raul, who gives her his unconditional love and allows her to pursue her dreams. Victoria dedicates her entire soul to achieve her dream and finally arrives at the Olympics, where she obtains the highest merit for her country. However, her heart is puzzled, because she will have to decide if she returns with Andres or chooses to be happy with Ra√∫l. == Cast ==  Starring  * Paulina Goto as Victoria * Andr√©s Palacios as Ra√∫l de la Pe√±a * Man√© de la Parra as Andr√©s Santib√°√±ez  Also starring  * Jorge Aravena as Jorge * Elizabeth √Ålvarez as Magdalena * Ren√© Strickler as Clemente * Susana Dosamantes as Gloria de Santib√°√±ez * Jorge Poza as Julio * Ver√≥nika con K as Chencha * Natalia Guerrero as Cecilia *Helena Rojo as Maria Isabel Recurring * Juan Pablo Gil as Arturo * Eva Cede√±o as Cristina * Gaby Mellado as Adriana * Tania Lizardo as Usumacinta * Isadora Gonz√°lez as Mireya * Rafael Amador as Padre Esteban * Lizetta Romo * Ana Lorena Elorduy as Elsa de la Pe√±a * Daniel Martinez as Emiliano * Clarisa Gonz√°lez as Elena Santib√°√±ez * Briggitte Bozzo as √Ångela * Lalo Palacios as El√≠as * Guillermo Avil√°n * Andres B.

The Act is one of the Seven Acts that exist to protect Intellectual Property Rights in Ghana namely; Protection against Unfair Competition Act, 2000 (Act 589); Industrial Designs Act, 2003 (Act 660); Geographical Indications Act, 2003 (Act 659); Patents Act, 2003 (Act 657); Trademarks Act, 2004 (Act 664); Layout-Designs (Topographies) of Integrated Circuits Act, 2004 (Act 667) and Copyrights Act, 2005 (Act 690). ==Purpose== Before the coming into force of the Act, the following are reasons the Parliament of Ghana considered to be the purpose of which the Bill should become an Act to cater for industrial designs.Industrial Designs Bill (Memorandum) dated 24th March, 2003 The purpose of the Bill is to enhance the operation of the laws on the protection of industrial designs. This is being effected by expanding the law on the industrial designs to include the accepted international provisions under the TRIPS Agreement. In the course of this, the existing legislation on textile designs have also been revised and incorporated into this Bill.ibid The definition of an industrial design includes everything which in the appearance of a product, causes an aesthetic impression, in other words, anything which gives an impression received by the sense of sight can be an industrial design. This definition excludes from protection elements in a design which are only for obtaining a technical result and hence cannot be claimed to be as a result of personal creativity. Such elements may be within the domains of Patent Law and outside the protection conferred under Industrial Design Law. Also, under this Bill, an industrial design is registrable if it is new, it has not been disclosed to the public anywhere in the world and it is not contrary to public order or morality. Another purpose is to cater for the situation in which two or more persons have created the same industrial design independently of each other, clause 3 applies the first-to-file system to determine who has the right to the registration of an industrial design. The Industrial Designs ActThe Industrial Designs Act, 2003 (ACT 660) was enacted by the Parliament of Ghana and came into force on December 31, 2003 after receiving Presidential assent and fully named, INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS ACT, 2003 (ACT 660) to cater for issues surrounding Industrial Designs in Ghana. The Act was expressed as an act to revise the enactments on the protection of industrial designs and to provide for related matters. Before the birth of the Act, there was the United Kingdom Designs (protection) ordinance (Cap 182) and also the Textiles Designs (Registration) Decree, 1973 (N.R.C.D. 213),ACT 660 @ section 27 the decree provided for the registration and protection of textile design and is presently the law regulating the registration and protection of textile designs in Ghana. == Structure == The Act comprises 27 sections and is categorized into the following headings: {  - !Headings !!

It seems to revise the enactments on Industrial Designs and to provide for related matters. Sections 1 (a) (b) & 2ACT 660 define what an Industrial Design is and what forms an Industrial Design may take. The Act defines an Industrial Design as a composition of lines or colours, any three- dimensional form or any material, whether or not associated with lines or colours. A textile design is also considered as industrial designs where the composition, form or material gives a special appearance to a product of industry or handicraft and can serve as a pattern for a product of industry or handicraft.Ibid at Section 1 In essence, it limits the scope of applicability to designs that impact the aesthetic character of the industrial product. Though the Industrial Design Act is not express on the fact that, protection of Industrial Design in Ghana is contingent upon registration that can be inferred from the Act, however a greater part of the sections of the Act deals with the issue of Registration of Industrial Designs by creators. Industrial Designs are nonetheless registered if they are original or significantly different from known designs. Section (2)Act 660 provides for designs which do not fall under the requirement of Industrial Acts in Ghana. The protection under Act 660 is not applicable to anything in an industrial design which serves solely to obtain a technical result to the extent that it leaves no freedom as regards arbitrary features of appearance. == Key terms == Key terms in the Act are defined in the Interpretation Section of the Act.Act 660 Section 26 provides unless the context otherwise requires the following definitions to the known terms; Court means the High Court; Creator means the person who creates the industrial design; \\"Harare Protocol\\" means the Protocol on Patents and Industrial Designs adopted in 1982 in Harare, Zimbabwe and ratified by the Government of Ghana on 20 September 1983; International Classification means the classification according to the Locarno Treaties of October 8, 1968 establishing an International Classification for Industrial Designs; Minister means the Minister responsible for Justice; Paris Convention means the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of March 20, 1883, as revised; Priority Date means the date of the earlier application that serves as the basis for the right of priority provided for in the Paris Convention; Register means the Register of Industrial Designs; Registered owner means the registered owner of an industrial design; Registrar means the Registrar‚ÄêGeneral. == Application == The Act is applicable where, * An industrial design does not solely serve to obtain a technical result to the extent that it leaves no freedom as regards arbitrary features of appearance.Ibid at Section 1(2) * Any international treaty in respect of industrial property to which the country is a party in matters dealt with by this Act.Ibid at Section 23 * The industrial design is made within the country. The protection provided under the ActACT660 is limited to the country because the Industrial Design rights are territorial in nature. * A composition of lines or colours, any three dimensions form or any material whether or not associated with lines of colours falls within the context of textile design.Ibid at Section 1(a) == Emerging law to protect industrial designs == The Industrial Design Act fundamentally seeks to protect the unique creations of persons that falls within the ambit of Section 1 of Act, 660. Also, it seeks to grant to the creator of designs to reward them for their effort and investment in manufacturing the product and does not protect any technical features of the object to which it is applied. Protecting an industrial design is also a reward for creativity and encourages economic development. Above all, it ensures protection against unauthorised copying or imitation of the design and can be relatively simple and inexpensive to develop. It also serves as the legal basis to help stop counterfeit products from destroying the legitimate brand's market and defaulting on the legitimate brand's visual promise of efficacy and safety, realising that most design laws in existence provide a relatively narrow scope of protection beyond which is depicted in the drawings forming the basis of the design application, it is recommended that protection for embodiment similar in appearance, but outside the halo of equivalent be filed and legislated. Consumers often take the visual appeal of a product into consideration when choosing between different products. This is especially true when the market offers a large variety of products with exactly the same function. As the aesthetic appeal of a product can determine the consumer's choice an industrial design adds commercial value to a product.ibid The Daily Graphic on 19 July 2016 reported through its reputation Suleiman Mustapha that \\"employers wage war on stolen designs and seek justice\\" this is a case where Ghana Employers Association (GEA) has called for stiffer punishment for pirates of stolen industrial design to save the country's industrial sector from collapsing, rising concerns of stolen industrial design of textile and manufacturing companies to the pirating of counterfeit pharmaceutical products have forced employers to call for a review of the existing law to save the country's thriving industrial sector from crumpling. Lastly, one of the reasons for the emerging the laws surrounding industrial design is basically, Globalisation. On 21 January 2016, Ghana launched its National Intellectual Property Policy and strategy (NIPPS). The vision is for Ghana to be amongst the leading countries in the utilization of Intellectual Property as a tool for rapid national development. The mission is to contribute towards enhancing the competitiveness of Ghana by improving and increasing the use of intellectual property systems. NIPPS long term goal is to exploit intellectual property rights for accelerated growth in technological and industrial development in Ghana. == Industrial designs register== The Register contains all recorded matters required by this Act to be recorded and it is maintained by the Registrar. The Register may be consulted by any person and extracts from the Register may be obtained subject to the prescribed conditions. The Registrar shall publish in the prescribed manner all the publications provided for under this Act. == Exemptions == The protection under this Act is not applicable to anything in an industrial design which serves solely to obtain a technical result to the extent that it leaves no freedom as regards arbitrary features of appearance ‚Äì Section 1(2) An industrial design which is contrary to public order or public morality is not registrable ‚Äì Section 2(4) The rights conferred by registration are not applicable to acts in respect of articles which have been put on the market in any country by the registered owner or with the registered owner's consent ‚Äì Section 9(3) A licence contract is of no legal effect against third parties until it has been recorded in accordance with this section (Section 14) ‚Äì Section 14(2) ==Other provisions== The creator shall be named the creator in the registration of the industrial design unless the creator indicates in a special written declaration signed by the creator and addressed to the Registrar that the creator does not wish to be named. A promise or an undertaking by the creator made to any person to the effect that the creator will make a declaration referred to in subsection (1) is void. ‚Äì Section 4 Where the Registrar is satisfied that the industrial design is not registrable the Registrar shall refuse the application. ‚Äì Section 8(2) The exploitation of a registered industrial design by persons other than the registered owner shall require the consent of the owner. ‚Äì Section 9(1) ==Conclusion== Although the Industrial Designs Act, 2003 (ACT 660) has been in force up to date, it is still in the development stage and has yet to fully develop. Although Ghana has the ACT 660, the implementing regulations have not yet passed. Accordingly, currently the Registry only accepts and processes applications relating to textiles designs. All other designs are not registrable in Ghana by way of national filings pending the implementations of regulations. Although Ghana has acceded to the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs, ACT 660 does not provide for the implementation of the Hague registration system, so the position in regard to such registration is not clear. ==References== Category:Ghanaian intellectual property law ","title":"Industrial Designs Act, 2003 (Act 660)"},{"id":"54207723","text":"Little Oakley Football Club is a football club based in Little Oakley, Essex, England.

After being educated to the fifth grade, he was employed in the Jhadol thikana (in present-day Jhadol tehsil) for some time. During his stint at Jhadol, he witnessed the oppressive behavior of the thakur and his henchmen towards the local Bhil people, which prompted him to resign his position in 1920. He then worked for a shopkeeper in Udaipur city. Soon after obtaining new employment, Tejawat was sent by his employer to Jhadol on business, where the thakur ordered him to hand over building material belonging to Tejawat's employer; he refused to oblige, and was beaten up and imprisoned by the thakur until Tejawat's employer was able to arrange for his release. Following this experience, Tejawat gave up his job in Udaipur and devoted himself to full- time political activity. == Activism == Motilal Tejawat's immediate source of inspiration was the Bijolia movement. Tejawat came in contact with pamphlets originating from the Bijolia Movement and proceeded to make copies of and distribute the pamphlets in Bhil-majority areas. Tejawat organized several meetings in Bhil villages in the erstwhile estate of Jhadol, which resulted in the formation of a committee that sought to articulate the grievances and demands of the Bhil peasantry. Tejawat saw his movement as being part of the larger independence movement in India led by, among others, Gandhi. He is said to have stated during speeches that once 'Gandhi raj' was established, the agitators would have to pay only one anna in the rupee (i.e., 6%) to their rulers.  Eki Movement  See Eki Movement.  Position of national leaders  Gandhi did not approve of Tejawat's methods and distanced himself from Tejawat in an article in Young India: > I hear that a gentleman by name Motilal Pancholi hailing from Udaipur claims > to be my disciple and to preach temperance and what not among the rustics of > the Rajputana States. He is reported to be surrounded by an armed crowd of > admirers and establishing his kingdom or some other -dom wherever he goes. > He claims too, miraculous powers. He or his admirers are reported to have > done some destructive work. I wish that people will once and for all > understand that I have no disciples. Similarly, V.S. Pathik criticized Tejawat: > One thing, however, is certain and that is that it was beyond Moti Lal's > intellectual capacity to lead the public on the right path...nobody, even a > child, would ever recognize Moti Lal as having a political aim or status, > nor was he connected with any political society.  Tejawat's arrest and imprisonment  Tejawat was arrested in Khedbrahma on June 4, 1929, by police belonging to Idar State, and handed over the Mewar State. Tejawat was held in Udaipur, without trial, until his release on April 23, 1939.  Post-Eki Movement activities  In December 1939, Tejawat announced to the Agra newspaper Sainik his intention to proceed to the adivasi areas of Mewar; he was barred by state authorities from doing so. However, in spite of state opposition to his activities, Tejawat continued to tour adivasi areas to advocate social reform, and was arrested again in Kotra on January 24,1946. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Indian activists ","title":"Motilal Tejawat"},{"id":"54207745","text":"Tatiana Repina () is a one-act drama by Anton Chekhov, written in 1889, as a sequel to Alexey Suvorin's play Tatiana Repina, with the dedication to the author.

Among the several authors who felt inspired enough to recreate this story in their work (Ivan Turgenev and Alexander Kuprin included) was Alexey Suvorin, whose drama Tatyana Repina, premiered at the Alexandrinka in St Petersburg in December 1888 and at the Moscow's Maly Theatre on 16 January 1889. Chekhov was friends with Suvorin and actively participated in the production of his \\"Tatyana Repina\\" play in Moscow. ==History== Chekhov's version of \\"Tatiana Repina\\" (which features the same characters but a different plotline) tells the story of a church wedding of Olenina and Sabinin, and the hysteria in the crowd of \\"The Lady in Black\\", who was mistaken for Tatiana Repina (the actress who dies of poison in the final act of Suvorin's drama). The demonstration of a religious service on stage made the publication of Chekhov's play impossible.. == Characters == * Olenina * Kokoshkina * Matveyev * Sonenstein * Sabinin * Kotelnikov * Kokoshkin * Patronnikov * Volgin, a young officer * Student * Young lady * Father Ivan, cathedral archpriest, and old man of 70 years * Father Nicholas * Father Alexey * Deacon * Sexton * Kuzma, the church watchman. * The Lady in Black * Prosecutor * Actors and actresses == References == Category:Plays by Anton Chekhov Category:1889 plays ","title":"Tatiana Repina"},{"id":"54207747","text":"The Sherry Triangle, is an area in the province of C√°diz in southwestern Spain. It is noted for the production of sherry, a type of fortified wine. The cities of Jerez de la Frontera, Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a are at the vertices of the triangle. The bodegas where the wine is blended and stored are all located within the cities. The Denominaci√≥n de Origen (Designation of Origin) for sherry was established in 1933. The Sherry Triangle is the aging area of \\"El Marco de Jerez\\" (the Sherry Setting).

The Triassic red sandstone was dug into in the Middle ages to provide sand for glass making and pottery production. Further excavation took place from the 17th to early 19th centuries and used for storage of trade goods. There is some evidence that prisoners captured during the French Revolutionary Wars or Napoleonic Wars were imprisoned in the caves but it is clear that the local folklore that slaves were imprisoned in the caves during the Bristol slave trade is false. After the closure of the last glass factory the caves were used for storage and became a rubbish dump. The caves are not generally open but have been used for film and music events. The explored and mapped area covers over however several areas are no longer accessible and the total extent of the caves is not known. ==History== The caves were dug to provide sand for glass making and pottery production. They were dug into the Triassic red sandstone cliffs, which give the area its name, adjacent to the southern side of Bristol Harbour, behind Phoenix Wharf and Redcliffe Wharf. The first excavation was during the Middle Ages but the majority of the digging was during the mid 17th and early 19th centuries. In the larger caverns the stone columns supporting the roof were not sufficient and these have been supplemented with wall arches made of stone, brick and more recently of concrete. In 1346 a hermit called John Sparkes lived in the caves and prayed for his benefactor Lord Thomas of Berkeley. Several other hermits lived in the caves between the 14th and 17th centuries. There is no evidence to support the rumours that the caves were used to hold slaves during the Bristol slave trade of the 17th and 18th centuries, however they were used to store the goods brought in by ships from Africa and the West Indies. There is some evidence that prisoners captured during the French Revolutionary Wars or Napoleonic Wars were imprisoned in the caves, while involved in the creation of the New Cut. Once the final glass factory in Bristol had closed the caves were used for storage and the disposal of rubbish. Some of the waste came from the Redcliffe Shot Tower at the corner of Redcliffe Hill and Redcliffe Parade, where the cellar was dug out into one of the tunnels. Waste from the lead shot production process was deposited between its opening in 1782 and closure in 1968. During World War II small parts of the caves were surveyed for use as an air raid shelter. A bomb created a crater into the caves which was subsequently filled in blocking access to some parts of the cave system. The caves have been used as an underground venue for the Bristol Film Festival, and for theatre productions. ==Location and extent== The full extent of the tunnels has not been explored as part of the site was split by a rail tunnel. The caves are believed to extend further than the currently visible area stretching to the south of the rail line. The explored and mapped area covers over and extends nearly as a far as Bristol General Hospital. They may also once have linked with the crypt of St Mary Redcliffe. A survey in 1953 and 1954 explored and mapped the accessible portions and provided some evidence of the wider extent of the caves. Several buildings in the area have or did have access to the caves from their cellars, including the Ostrich pub where part of a wall has been demolished to show part of one of the caves. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Caves of Bristol ","title":"Redcliffe Caves"},{"id":"54207783","text":"Pershing Square Holdings () is a large British investment trust dedicated to long-term investments in North American companies.

It generated great critical interest, due in parts to its introduction by Gilles Deleuze. Seven years later, Wolfson's mother died of complications from an ovarian tumour. The author, now liberated from her guardianship, left New York and moved to Montreal in 1984. There, Wolfson wrote an account of the last months of their divided lives, marked by his mother's agony and his obsessive practice of betting on horses. The text ‚Äî Ma m√®re, musicienne, est morte... (My Mother, a Musician, Has Died) ‚Äî uses the same humor and staggering language of Le Schizo et les langues, but is also charged with the drama of the illness. It was published in 1984 by √âditions Navarin. The text has become scarce. He wrote a new version during 2011. It was published by √©ditions Attila in 2014. Since November 1994, he has lived in Puerto Rico where he became a millionaire on 9 April 2003 after winning the lottery. ==Bibliography== * (new edition in 1987) * (changes and additions to Le Schizo et les langues) * (changes and additions to Le Schizo et les langues, translated into English) * * ==External links== * Wolfson et la finance\\" √âditions Attila. * Wolfson dit merde √† la mort\\", Le Fric-Frac Club. * Louis Wolfson, ¬´ L'√©tudiant de langues schizophr√©nique ¬ª, in La Revue des ressources. * L'Absent√©isme verbal de Louis Wolfson schizo, √âcole lacanienne de psychanalyse. ==References== * ;Notes Category:1931 births Category:People from New York (state) Category:20th-century American writers Category:American writers in French Category:People with schizophrenia Category:Biography articles of living people Category:Living people Category:Outsider literature ","title":"Louis Wolfson (writer)"},{"id":"54207927","text":"Donna Marie McDowell White (born November 29, 1948) is an American politician.

He was suffect consul in the nundinium of May to August 107 with Titus Vettennius Severus as his colleague.E. Mary Smallwood, Principates of Nerva, Trajan and Hadrian (Cambridge: University Press, 1966), p. 4 Fundanus is best known as being the recipient of an edict from the emperor Hadrian about conducting trials of Christians in his province. == Life == The earliest offices Fundanus held are known from an inscription recovered from Baloie (modern ≈†ipovo) in Bosnia.ILJug-03, 1627 The first office listed is military tribune with Legio XII Fulminata. Next is quaestor, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he would be enrolled in the Senate.Richard Talbert, The Senate of Imperial Rome (Princeton: University Press, 1984), p. 16 Two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed: plebeian tribune and praetor. The last appointment, before the inscription breaks off, was his commission as legatus legionis or commander of Legio XV Apollinaris; Everett L. Wheeler dates his tenure with this unit to the 90s of this era.Everett L. Wheeler, \\"Legio XV Apollinaris: From Carnuntum to Satala‚Äîand beyond\\", in Y. Le Bohec and C. Wolff, eds. Les L√©gions de Rome sous le Haut-Empire (Lyon/Paris 2002), pp. 279f Other sources attest that Fundanus was governor of Achaea, but the year is uncertain.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), pp. 186f We can narrow the possible dates he was governor a little: the terminus post quem his governorship started was 101, when Gaius Caristanius Julianus is known to have governed;Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 334f and the terminus ante quem he left his post is the year of his consulate, although the letters he received from Pliny indicate he was no longer in Achaea, allowing us to adjust the date ante quem as early as the year 103. The inscription from Baloie mentions he had been admitted to the Septemviri epulonum, one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods; because this inscription does not mention his consulate, it can be assumed his entrance preceded that office. Most, if not all, of the letters Pliny wrote to Fundanus fall before he was suffect consul. In the first letter of his collection, Pliny declares that living on his rural estate is preferable to living in Rome where he is subject to constant pleas for assistance;Pliny, Epistulae, I.9 Ronald Syme dates most of the material in that section of Pliny's collection to the year 97, but notes some \\"can or should be assigned to the next year.\\"Syme, Tacitus (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958), p. 660 The second letter petitions him to appoint the son of Pliny's friend Asinius Rufus to serve as Fundanus' quaestor for Fundanus' upcoming consulate;Pliny, Epistulae, IV.15 Syme dates the letters from this part of Pliny's collection as \\"embracing the years 103-5.\\"Syme, Tacitus, p. 661 The last letter is another petition to Fundanus, canvassing him on behalf of Julius Naso, who is running for an unnamed office;Pliny, Epistulae, VI.6 Syme notes that letters from this part of the collection can be dated to the years 105 to 107. While all of these letters demonstrate the two men were acquainted, they fail to show the warmth of a friendship. Following his consulate, during the reign of Trajan, Fundanus was governor of Dalmatia. Although the term would fall sometime after 107, Werner Eck suggests that a date closer to 108 to 111 is more likely.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", (1983), p. 194 == Procedure and Christians == It is through a rescript the historian Eusebius preserves at length in his Ecclesiae Historia that we know Fundanus was proconsul of Asia.Eusebius, Ecclesiae Historia, IV.8-9; translated by G. A. Williamson, Eusebius: The History of the Church (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1965), pp. 162f Eck dates his tenure to 122/123.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", (1983), p. 157 Fundanus' predecessor, Quintus Licinius Silvanus Granianus, had asked Hadrian how to handle legal cases where some inhabitants were accusing their neighbors of being Christians through \\"informers or mere clamour\\". Hadrian's reply was to state that any such accusations had to be through a law court, where the matter could be properly investigated, and if they are \\"guilty of any illegality, you [Fundanus] must pronounce sentence according to the seriousness of the offence.\\" This rescript is important as an independent witness of the existence of one or more Christian communities in this part of Anatolia in the early second century. The only other contemporaneous evidence we have for these communities is the list of the Seven churches of Asia from the book of Revelation (2:1-3:22). == Family == Fundanus' wife was Statoria Marcella, the daughter of a Marcus Statorius. We know her name from a funerary inscription, which suggests that she died before Fundanus' consulship.. The name of their daughter, Minica Marcella, comes from two independent sources. Minicia died young: her funerary vase has been identified, which states her age at death as twelve years, eleven months, and seven days. Pliny also attests to her existence, revealing information about the girl that shows that he and Fundanus were better friends than the surviving letters he wrote Fundanus suggest. In the letter, addressed to one Aefulanus Marcellinus, Pliny notes that, although she was not yet fourteen years old, she was betrothed; he describes the preparations for her wedding, with which Fundanus was busy; and he asks Marcellinus to send Fundanus a letter consoling him for his loss.Pliny, Epistulae, V.16 It is not known if Fundanus and Statoria had any other children. == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:2nd- century Romans Category:Roman governors of Achaea Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Dalmatia Category:Roman governors of Asia Fundanus ","title":"Gaius Minicius Fundanus"},{"id":"54207988","text":"Thomas Benjamin Blomfield (born 11 August 1985) is a British entrepreneur. ==Early life== Blomfield grew up in Buckinghamshire and attended the selective Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham. His first business was building a website for a local estate agent, whom Blomfield charged ¬£250 for the webpage and ¬£3 per house to be inputted upon receiving instructions. He earned a degree in Law (Jurisprudence) from the University of Oxford. ==Career== While at Oxford, he received a ¬£1,000 prize from a business plan competition, proposing an \\"eBay for students\\" in 2004. Named Boso.com, it expanded to 50 universities across the UK, and ran the company from 2004 until 2006. He told a reporter that the business struggled to raise money due to difficulties connecting with investors. Blomfield's two partners in the business went to Silicon Valley and went on the Y Combinator programme, however he did not attend due to university examinations. The business was sold to a Canadian company for \\"several million dollars\\" upon which it was remade into Auctomatic, a power selling tool for eBay users. Blomfield then studied at Universit√© Panth√©on-Assas (Paris II) from 2005 to 2006, and returned to Oxford to study for a master's degree in Law from 2007 to 2008. He decided after a few internships with law firms that he did not want to become a lawyer. Upon leaving Oxford, he first worked as an associate consultant at OC&C; Strategy Consultants, working on \\"dog and cat food, baby car seats, frozen pizzas, debt collection, and one company that refurbished passenger airlines, plus a few pub chains\\".  GoCardless  Blomfield founded the UK-based company GoCardless in January 2011. The company rose to prominence after receiving a ¬£125,000 investment from Y Combinator. Blomfield stayed in Silicon Valley and during his three years at the company, it raised around ¬£35 million of investment and hired 100 people. When GoCardless appointed Hiroki Takeuchi as CEO in 2013, he left (keeping a \\"very small share\\" in the ¬£50-100m valued company) and moved to New York to work for dating site Grouper social club as their Head of Growth. Blomfield left Grouper in 2014, and it closed in 2016.  Starling Bank  Blomfield first met former Allied Irish Banks and Royal Bank of Scotland banker Anne Boden around 2011, where Anne had the idea for a digital bank. On his return from Grouper in New York, Blomfield joined Boden at her company Starling Bank which was at that point one of the first digital banking companies. He was fired in early 2015 after reports of disagreements at Starling, telling the Financial Times that \\"he could not comment under the terms of his departure\\".  Monzo  In 2015, he founded challenger bank Monzo. In its first fundraising round, the company raised \\"¬£1 million in 96 seconds\\". As of 2019 the company was built on the \\"lean start up concept\\", operating with no branches and instead offering accounts online which cost the company \\"about ¬£20 to ¬£30 to provide\\". In January 2020 his fellow founder, Paul Rippon, departed the company to spend time farming alpacas. In April, Blomfield announced he would forgo his salary for one year to help his company during the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, he announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Monzo and taking on the role of president of the company. == Personal life == Blomfield was born in Buckinghamshire. His father was an entrepreneur, having set up an engineering company in his mid-30s. Blomfield spent his childhood learning programming languages, playing sport, and singing, though he was rejected by his school choir for being tone deaf. He spends his free time making pottery, and has travelled to east Africa including Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Zanzibar. He has been critical of the Silicon Valley business environment, calling it a \\"dystopia\\" due to its \\"wealth inequality and the lack of provision for homelessness and mental health\\". ==Awards and recognition== In 2013, he was recognised as one of the top five entrepreneurs under 30 by the European Commission. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to Improving Competition and Financial Inclusion in the Banking Sector. ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:British chief executives Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Tom Blomfield"},{"id":"54208001","text":"John D.

Tolman is an inorganic chemist whose laboratory works on synthesis and characterization of bioinorganic systems, organometallic reagents and polymers. He received his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Wesleyan University in 1983, and then completed a Ph.D. program in Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley by 1987 under the guidance of Professor K. Peter C. Vollhardt. He previously was employed at the University of Minnesota as the Department Chair of Chemistry. Currently, he is the William Greenleaf Eliot Professor of Chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis. In addition to his faculty position, he is also the Editor and Chief of the ACS journal of Inorganic Chemistry. == Copper-Oxygen Adducts == Tolman's work in the bioinorganic field focuses on Cu-O adducts, specifically copper proteins whose diverse, biological functions include: O2 transport, aromatic ring oxidations, biogenesis of hormones. His work studies the potential of 1:1 Cu/O2 adducts as catalytic species, which have been known as transient intermediates for more commonly studied 2:1 and even 3:1 Cu/O2 molecules. These complexes, while kinetically favored in formation are thermodynamically unstable due to negative entropy values, thus making them more difficult to isolate. Although, increasing ligand sizes on these 1:1 adducts did correlate with slower reaction rate constants; advantageous for isolating and studying these complexes. This figure shows copper and oxygen bonded at differing ratios. Furthermore, his work on high and mixed valent copper species including [CuOH]+2 and its conjugate base, [CuO]+ is also very notable. His work with [CuOH]+2 reveals a high reactivity with C-H and O-H bonds as compared to its conjugate acid pair. This is of importance when trying to replicate biological mechanisms, such as copper-catalyzed oxidation in vitro. His research has greatly contributed to the discovery and characterization of new biomimetic species. It is his goal to not only identify these compounds, but to comprehensively understand the intermediates and mechanisms with which they play crucial roles in facilitating. In the case of Cu/O2 adducts, realizing their biological role and function in copper containing enzymes can give rise to new insights on their biomimetic properties. Additionally, his lab is searching for alternative, synthetic oxidative catalysis. This includes designing biochemically-inspired synthetic catalysts as well as trying O2 as a candidate for controlled, in vitro oxidation. Due to high abundances and relatively strong stabilizing capabilities within biological reactions, iron and copper enzymes inspire biomimetic synthetic catalysts. Although these reactions perform with high accuracy and selectivity within the body, many challenges arise when working with O2 in vitro because of the undesired and potentially harmful side products that can be generated. == Organometallic Catalysts == LA to PLA An example of his organometallic work includes Zn(II) and Fe(III) alkoxide catalysts, used to polymerize lactide (LA) into polylactide (PLA). [4] PLA is of great interest because it is both biodegradable and a renewable resource. While there are many well known catalysts available to synthesize PLA, not much is known about these mechanisms; proving problematic in designing new and efficient catalysts. In an attempt to resolve this, less structurally complex catalysts are being produced and characterized. Tolman's research in accordance, provided that catalysts with lower coordination numbers have higher polymerization activities. His Zn(II) alkoxide catalyst, as an example, produced PLA with a high molecular weight at a relatively fast rate. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:21st-century American chemists Category:Wesleyan University alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:University of Minnesota faculty ","title":"William B.

In 1915-1917 Koreneva was cast in five Russian films, including Yevgeni Bauer- directed The King of Paris, as Lucienne Marechal.Filmography at www.kino- teatr.ru Koreneva's highly charged, poetic and exalted stage persona proved to be very akin to her real life character, according to theatre historian Inna Solovyova. In 1920s she turned into easily 'the most capricious actress in the history of MAT', as the critic Vadim Shverubovich remembered. Mikhail Bulgakov portrayed her sarcastically as the hysterical Maria Pryakhina in his Theatrical Novel, although several critics warned against taking this caricature at face value. Despite behind close curtain conflicts and scandals, Koreneva's work on stage remained inspired and consistent.

In 1941, as the MAT troupe was evacuated from Moscow, she was the only one who stayed behind, so as to provide care to Stanislavski's widow Maria Lilina who was dying of cancer. Koreneva's last major success on stage was Anna Zvezdintseva in Lev Tolstoy's The Fruits of Enlightenment in 1951. A year later it earned her the Stalin Prize of the first order. In 1958 Koreneva was forced to retire. Scandalized, she swore never to set foot in this theatre and held her promise. She died in Moscow on 2 July 1982, aged 96, and is interred in Vagankovo Cemetery. == References External links== * * Category:Russian stage actresses Category:Russian silent film actresses Category:Moscow Art Theater Category:People from Tambov Category:1885 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Burials at Vagankovo Cemetery ","title":"Lydia Koreneva"},{"id":"54208292","text":"The Jackson Municipal Library Sign on the Mississippi Freedom Trail The Tougaloo Nine were a group of African-American students at Tougaloo College, who participated in civil disobedience by staging sit-ins of segregated public institutions in Mississippi in 1961. ==History== The Civil Rights Movement began slowly in the South, especially in Mississippi. Before 1955, it was mostly isolated protests against the obstruction of voting rights for black Americans. Groups formed during this time period include the Mississippi Progressive Voters' League and the Regional Council of Negro Leadership. In the 1960s, more youths began to participate in the Civil Rights Movement. Mississippi was considered by civil rights organizer Medgar Evers to be \\"too racist and violent\\" for lunch counter sit-ins so the public library was chosen because it was supported by both Black and White taxpayers. The students, trained in nonviolent resistance, were NAACP Youth Council members led by Joseph Jackson Jr. ==Read-in== On March 27, 1961, they visited Jackson‚Äôs library for black residents, George Washington Carver, and requested books they knew were not there. They then entered the main Jackson Public Library for white residents and staged a \\"read in.\\" The nine students began to search for source materials for class assignments, and sat down in the library and began to read. At this time, the library staff called the police. They were told \\"There's a colored library on Mill Street.... You are welcome there.\\" When they refused to leave, they were arrested and charged with breach of the peace for failing to leave when ordered to do so. That following day, on March 28th, the nine students were released on one-thousand dollar bond. ==Protests== The day after the Read-In, fifty students from Jackson State College picketed the arrest of the Tougaloo Nine prior to their release. Police utilized clubs and dogs against the students in order to disband the protest. The next day, March 29th, over one hundred black community members congregated outside of the courthouse to show support for the Nine. As protesters applauded the arrival of the Tougaloo Nine at the courthouse, policemen set on the crowd with dogs and nightsticks resulting in the beating of NAACP representative Medgar Evers along with several women and children, two men being bitten by dogs, and an 81-year-old man suffering a broken arm when police beat him with a nightstick. Reverend S. Leon Whitney, a pastor of Farish Street Baptist Church, was among those bitten by police dogs.Medgar Evers later reflected \\"This act on the part of the police officials brought on greater unity in the Negro community and projected the NAACP in a position of being the accepted spokesman.\\" A Jackson reporter summarized the event by saying, \\"A quiet community has been invaded by rabble-rousers stirring up hate between the races, and following are the‚Ä¶publicity media feeding an integrated North the choicest morsels from the Mississippi carcass.‚Ä¶The Negro who has so long held the guiding and helping hand of the white may lose that hand as he climbs the back of his benefactor and teacher to shout into halls where he is not welcome.\\" ==Aftermath== The students appeared in court on March 29th, and were not allowed to see their attorneys Jack Young and R. Jess Brown before their hearing. They were fined $100 each and given a thirty-day suspended sentence and year's probation on condition that they ‚Äúparticipate in no further demonstrations.\\" In protest of the sentencing and the brutality of police towards bystanders, a meeting was held at a local Masonic Temple, at which Julie Wright encouraged other black community members to participate in a \\"No Buying Campaign\\". This campaign saw the successful boycotting of white business that discriminated against black people, and chain stores reportedly lost $49,225 in sales tax revenues. In 1962, partially as a result of this event, the American Library Association membership adopted the \\"Statement on Individual Membership, Chapter Status and Institutional Membership\\" which stated that membership in the association and its chapters had to be open to everyone regardless of race, religion, or personal belief. Four state chapters withdrew from ALA: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi. Unlike the Freedom Riders, Friendship Nine, and Little Rock Nine, the Tougaloo Nine are not as well known historically. Sammy Bradford, one of the Tougaloo Nine, said on the occasion of the read-in anniversary: \\"It seems that everybody is being celebrated and praised for their fine work except the very people who launched the civil rights movement against some of the greatest odds ever faced by man or beast. I'm not saying that the Tougaloo Nine should be rolled out like world-conquering heroes in a ticker-tape parade every year, but they should at least be acknowledged, along with many others, whenever a purported celebration of civil rights activities in Mississippi takes place.\\" ==The Nine== *Joseph Jackson Jr. *Albert Lassiter *Alfred Cook *Ethel Sawyer *Geraldine Edwards Hollis *Evelyn Pierce *Janice Jackson *James \\"Sammy\\" Bradford *Meredith Anding Jr. ==References== Category:1961 in American politics Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:American Library Association Category:African-American history of Mississippi Category:Civil rights movement Category:Civil rights protests in the United States Category:History of Mississippi Category:History of racism in Mississippi Category:Police brutality in the United States Nine ","title":"Tougaloo Nine"},{"id":"54208301","text":"The 2017‚Äì18 season was Motherwell's thirty-third consecutive season in the top flight of Scottish football and the fifth in the newly established Scottish Premiership, having been promoted from the Scottish First Division at the end of the 1984‚Äì85 season.

It was the 13th round of the 2001 CART FedEx Championship Series season. Team Penske dominated the event, with Gil de Ferran taking pole position and H√©lio Castroneves finishing ahead of de Ferran in the race itself. Patrick Carpentier finished 3rd. Castroneves had earned his third win of the season and the last of his CART career by taking advantage of a faster pitstop during the first half of the race and staying ahead the rest of the way. Castroneves was now within one point of championship leader Kenny Br√§ck, who collided with his teammate in the race and ended up three laps down in 20th place. de Ferran was also continuing a streak of high points-paying positions, and his podium at the race put him 3rd overall. Carpentier scored his third consecutive podium and continued a run of good results for Forsythe Racing. The race hinged on pitstops and fuel strategy, as many drivers gambled on off-schedule stops to try and make up positions on a track that was notoriously difficult to pass on. Nevertheless, it was Team Penske's conventional strategy that allowed both drivers to finish 1-2. ==Qualifying== {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - !colspan=6August 11, 2001 - Qualifying Speeds - !

The album is mainly composed of cover songs associated with Ray Charles, James Carr, and Jimmy Hughes, as well as originals. ==Background== The album was produced by Tom Dowd, who worked extensively with the Allman Brothers, and Johnny Sandlin, who co-produced Allman's first solo album, Laid Back. The idea to record a new version of \\"Whipping Post\\" came from longtime Allman Brothers roadie Red Dog, who suggested it after the success of Eric Clapton's version of \\"Layla\\" on MTV Unplugged. While recording \\"The Dark End of the Street\\"‚Äîonce his brother Duane's favorite song‚Äîhe had to stop and go outside because he was tearing up. The album came on the heels of Allman quitting drugs and alcohol, and the album's titled reflected his search \\"for a more simple life.\\" He was nearly complete with the recording process, which spanned two and a half years, when he quit substances altogether. In all, he completed 20 songs for the project, but felt some were not as good as others. He cut the track listing down from there, but then decided it was too short. Near the end of the process, he went to Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California with Tom Dowd to record two new songs, a cover of \\"Memphis in the Meantime\\" and an original, \\"Startin' Over\\". The photo on the cover is of Allman at age 15. ==Reception== William Ruhlmann of AllMusic gave the album three stars, writing that the \\"album finds him growling through standard-issue blues-rock, some of the songs originals, some covers.\\" Biographer Alan Paul, who wrote 2014's One Way Out: The Inside History of the Allman Brothers Band, called it Allman's \\"finest new solo work since Laid Back.\\" ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Gregg Allman; except where indicated # \\"Whipping Post\\" ‚Äì 4:41 # \\"House of Blues\\" ‚Äì 4:00 # \\"Come Back and Help Me\\" (Allman and Jack Pearson) ‚Äì 3:35 # \\"Silence Ain't Golden Anymore\\" ‚Äì 3:33 # \\"Rendezvous with the Blues\\" (Johnny Douglas and Jimmy Hall) ‚Äì 3:53 # \\"Wolf's A-Howlin'\\" ‚Äì 4:14 # \\"Love the Poison\\" (G.

He is most known for his electronic organ, electronic piano, and other musical instruments. He was the inventor of the Cat's whisker detector. ==Early life and career== Miessner was born in Huntingburg, Indiana to Charles and Mary (Reutopohler) Miessner and was the brother of Otto Miessner. He attended school in Huntingburg and graduated from high school in 1908. He then enlisted in the U. S. Navy, and graduated from the U.S. Naval Electrical School in Brooklyn, NY in 1909. He was assigned to a naval radio station in Washington, D.C. to be a radio operator. It was while he was in Washington that he invented the \\"cat whisker\\" detector which allowed for receiving radio waves by crystal sets. He was also promoted to Chief Operator. The Electric Dog as shown in Scientific American He left the Navy to work with John Hays Hammond Jr. and Frtiz Lowenstein in 1911. The group worked on a wireless control system for torpedoes. While working for Hammond he invented a superheterodyne radio system. The group also invented the Electric Dog, a prop they used to demonstrate how light changes the electrical conduction properties of selenium. Miessner and Hammond had a falling out and Miessner left the company in 1912. He studied electrical engineering at Purdue University from 1913-1916 where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity. He also communicated with Nikola Tesla about the book on radio dynamics he was writing and Tesla‚Äôs own work in the field of radio controls. In June 1916 he married Eleanor M. Schulz in Buffalo, NY. They would have two daughters, Jane and Mary. That same year he returned to the Navy as an Expert Radio Aid for Aviation where he developed radio systems for airplanes and published his book ‚ÄúRadiodynamics, the wireless control of torpedoes and other mechanisms‚Äù. During World War I, he was stationed in Pensacola, Florida where he was in charge of the radio laboratory of the Navy Aeronautic Station. After World War I, he began working for Emil J. Simon on radio for aircraft and transoceanic receivers in New York City. He moved to Chicago in the early 1920s where he worked for the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company where he founded the company‚Äôs acoustical lab. He moved back east to New Jersey in 1926 to be the chief engineer at Garod Corp. ==Miessner Inventions, Inc.== In the late 1920s, Miessner sold over fifty of his patents to RCA and received around $750,000 for them. He used this money to begin his own company, Miessner Inventions, Inc in Millburn, New Jersey. Over the next thirty years he would become a leader in the fields of electrical radio receivers, electronic musical instruments and receivers, phonography, radio dynamics, directional microphones for aircraft and submarines, aircraft radio, and other devices. He also developed a new system of sound recording and reproduction and perfected the Wurlitzer organ and electronic piano. In 1929, he published his second book, All-electric Radio Receiver Design and in 1936 he had fairly long article on electronic music and instruments published in the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers. In the early 1930s he worked with his brother, Otto, to invent an instrument called a rhythmicon. Unfortunately for them, L√©on Theremin had already developed a similar instrument with the same name. In 1934, one of Miessner‚Äôs patents was used by the Everett Piano Company in the first large scale production on an electronic organ known as the Orgatron. In 1954, the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company used his 1935 design for an amplified conventional piano as the basis for their highly successful Wurlitzer Electric Piano. In 1937 Miessner designed an electric violin and cello. He would be involved in a copyright battle with another company on the violin‚Äôs design, which he lost. In 1955 he took the U.S. Patent Office to court to recoup a $25.00 filing fee he had to pay make an appeal. A decision was made that day (possibly before he filed the appeal) which made the appeal, and the fee, unnecessary. When the Patent Office would not refund his money he took them to court where the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled against him. When Miessner dissolved his company in 1959 he had been granted over two hundred patents and sold about one hundred fifty of them. While most of his patents had to do with electronics, sound, and music, others were variations from that work. Such as his inventions to adjust the string tension on a tennis racket and for a non-leaking fountain pen. ==Retirement== After closing his company, Miessner kept himself busy with writing and other work. In 1962 he published an article on the bending of parts of a radio beam and another in 1963 on the frustrations in inventing. He was appointed to the ad hoc Patent System Reform panel of the U.S. Department of Commerce in 1963. In 1964, he published his third book On the Early History of Radio Guidance. He was a board member of the Academy of Applied Sciences and president of the Patent Equity Association. He was also a member of the Acoustical Society of America, the American Physics Society, the A.A.A.S., and the Veteran Wireless Operators Association. He also kept inventing and filing patents. In 1963, Miessner won the De Forest Audion gold medal for inventive achievement. In 1964 he won the Distinguished Service Award from the Boys Club of America. Miessner died at his home in Miami, Florida. ==References== Category:Inventors of musical instruments Category:1890 births Category:1976 deaths Category:20th-century American inventors ","title":"Benjamin Miessner"},{"id":"54208676","text":"S.

The mascot of the School is the Indian. It's located in the Robertson County School district and it is the only high school in Cross Plains, serving all of the limits of that city as well as nearby Orlinda. ==History== In 1950, two high schools in eastern Robertson County‚ÄîOrlinda High School, located in Orlinda, and Cross Plains High School, located in Cross Plains‚Äîmerged to form East Robertson High School, which was originally at a location on East Robertson Road. East Robertson High School became a K‚Äì12 school after the addition of new classrooms. On May 9, 1970, East Robertson's principal, Edwin H. Osborne, died from a heart attack at the age of 61. In late 1990, grades 7‚Äì12 moved to East Robertson's present-day Kilgore Trace location, and the East Robertson Road location became an elementary school. Around 2001‚Äì2002 East Robertson High School added an expansion for middle school classrooms. In 2005, Barry Baker, a teacher at the school, died in a car accident. East Robertson High School's football field was named \\"Barry Baker Memorial Field\\" in his honor. In 2007 East Robertson's Class of 1982 met and made a website at their 25th reunion. Today, East Robertson High School accommodates grades 6‚Äì12. Vice Principal Mary G. Cook became the principal of East Robertson High School in 2011 and remains the principal . In 2013 an event called \\"Pink Out\\" was held to raise support for Cook's battle with cancer. A Cancer awareness symbol was placed outside on the East Robertson building and was there from 2013 to August 17, 2017. In 2017, East Robertson High School ended their contract with Pepsi to receive a contract for selling Coca-Cola products in soda machines. ==Baseball-field bullet incident== On May 13, 2013, during after-school baseball practice, a bullet struck the dugout while players were sitting on the bench. Police determined that the incident was an accident, with the bullet having been fired by a hunter about three miles away. No injuries occurred, and the team went on to the 2013 district championship. ==Clubs and Athletics== The East Robertson Indians Compete in the following sports, *Football *Basketball *Baseball *Soccer *Bowling *Boxing *Cross Country *Golf *Volleyball *Softball *Swimming And there is also a School band. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Public high schools in Tennessee Category:Public middle schools in Tennessee Category:Schools in Robertson County, Tennessee Category:Educational institutions established in 1950 Category:1950 establishments in Tennessee ","title":"East Robertson High School"},{"id":"54208943","text":"During the 1977‚Äì78 Scottish football season, Celtic competed in the Scottish Premier Division. ==Competitions== Scottish Premier Division League table  Matches  Scottish Cup Scottish League Cup European Cup ==References== Category:Celtic F.C. seasons Celtic ","title":"1977‚Äì78 Celtic F.C. season"},{"id":"54208966","text":"Murodermin (INN), also known as recombinant murine epidermal growth factor (rmEGF), is a recombinant form of mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF) and an EGF receptor agonist which was never marketed. ==See also== * Nepidermin ==References== Category:Growth factors Category:Recombinant proteins ","title":"Murodermin"},{"id":"54208990","text":"George William Joy, The Bayswater Omnibus, 1895 Typical London omnibus, c.1902 The Bayswater Omnibus is an 1895 oil painting by George William Joy. It has been held by the Museum of London since 1966. The genre painting depicts a scene inside a horse-drawn omnibus of the London General Omnibus Company. Joy borrowed a bus from the company while he was working on his painting. The early omnibus was a horse-drawn carriage drawn along a set route, picking up and dropping off passengers as it went. It was introduced in London on 4 July 1829 and soon became a popular form of transport catering mainly to the middle classes - the working classes would rarely be able to afford the fare, and upper classes could afford their own vehicle or to hire a hackney carriage. The typical London omnibus was an enclosed and glazed carriage with four wheels, drawn by one or two horses. Passengers could sit on benches to either side inside, entering via a door at the rear, or climb up to exposed seats on the roof. A driver would ride at the front of the carriage, with a conductor taking fares and assisting passengers to climb aboard and depart. The scene is painted as if viewed by a person on one bench inside the omnibus, looking across at passengers on the other side of the carriage. The painting depicts, from left to right, a relatively poor mother accompanied by a young girl (modelled by the artist's wife and daughter) and carrying a baby; the central figure is a fashionably well-dressed young woman, with a long-handled parasol and basket of flowers; she sits beside a city gentleman in top hat and frock coat reading his newspaper; and then closer to the door are two more women: a nurse seated in her starched uniform, and a milliner boarding the bus, holding a handrail with one hand and clasping a hatbox with the other. The side of the carriage behind and above the passengers is covered with advertising posters, including Millais's Bubbles painting for Pears soap (Millais studied beside Joy). Visible through the window, a hansom cab passes on the road beyond. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1895. It was donated to the Museum of London by the artist's daughter Rosalind B. Joy in 1966.

Oil on canvas, 198cm x 147.5cm. Private collection, Melbourne, Australia Blood on the Floor (Painting, 1986)Schmied, 102 is a 1986 oil-on-canvas panel painting by the British artist Francis Bacon. The panel shows a violent splash of blood, formed from drips of paint, on a bare canvas coloured floor, which may be a wooden plank, or diving board, against a harsh, flat, orange background.Peppiatt, 192 The forground contains two suspended light bulbs, one white, one molten yellow, and a light switch. Painting, 1986 is considered a high point of Bacon's late period, and reflective of his deepening pessimism later in life, expressed through the austere, thin brushwork; the panel has been described as \\"strikingly simple\\".Farr et al, 202 It is related to his Blood on Pavement 1988, completed two years later in much cooler brown and pale green tones.\\"Homage to Bacon\\". Tate Etc., issue 14, Autumn 2008. Retrieved 16 June 2017 ==Description== The large scale of the painting emphasises the pool of blood and gives it prime importance in the work. The light switch and bulbs serve only to illuminate the splash, but notably absent from the scene is the owner of the blood or any explanation as to how it got to be there. According to Joseph Harris, the blood itself becomes the subject of a portrait.Harris, 44 The painting is extremely reductive. Any sense of perspective is diminished. There are few elements to give the impression of a realistic three dimensional space; the hanging lights excepted, but even their positioning is illogical against the floor; their starting point is deep in the pictorial space, but the bulbs seem to overhang in front of the floor. According to art critic Denis Farr this deductive flat quality \\"increases one's sense of disorientation\\". Its intensity and narrowness of focus is reminiscent of monumental sculpture, and imparts an immediate shock, along with deeper undercurrents of foreboding and despair. ==Motifs== Many of Bacon's most regarded late works are re- examinations of motifs from his earlier masterpieces. The background colours of Blood on the Floor reference the heavy and thickly painted foreground figures of his early to mid-40s works, notably Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, while the mix of deep red colours forming the blood splash returns to his early use of imagery from medical textbooks, especially his interest in interiors of the mouth.Schmied, 18 Light bulbs were a reoccurring motif throughout his career, appearing most notably in the center panel of Triptych, May‚ÄìJune 1973. Of the painting, Bacon said, \\"things are not as shocking of they have not been put into memorable form. Otherwise it's just spattered against a wall. In the end, if you see that more than two or three times, it's no longer shocking. It must be of a form that's more than just blood splattered against a wall. It's when it has much wider implications. It's something that reverberates within your psyche...it disturbs the whole atmosphere in which you live. Most of what is called art, your eye just flows over. It may be charming or nice, but it doesn't change you.\\" ==ReferencesSources== * Farr, Dennis; Peppiatt, Michael; Yard, Sally.

Original cast recording  The original cast recording was released 12 January 2018 and debuted at #17 on the ARIA Albums Chart in Australia. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018, the album was nominated for Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album. == Reception == Muriel's Wedding received very positive critical responses. The Sydney Morning Herald commented that: \\"Muriel's Wedding feels like the complete package: a beloved film seamlessly updated; a central character who retains all the ambiguities that made you root for her in the first place; a conspicuously inventive score peppered with classic pop hits, and a mainstage debut that will be talked about for years. Adapting his own screenplay to the stage and into the social media present, PJ Hogan's book amplifies the Cinderella aspects of Muriel's story without sacrificing the satirical and melancholic elements that gave the film its depth and heart.\\" Awards and nominations Muriel's Wedding received seven 2017 Sydney Theatre Awards, including Best Production of a Mainstage Musical and Best Original Score of a Mainstage Production, as well as for its direction, choreography, musical direction, Jones as female actor in a supporting role in a musical, and McKenna as newcomer. It was nominated for Best New Australian Work, and in four other categories. Its text received the 2018 AWGIE Award for Music Theatre, and the AWGIE Awards' David Williamson award for excellence in writing for Australian theatre. The musical won five 2018 Helpmann Awards including Best Original Score, and was also nominated for Best Musical and Best New Australian Work, amongst others. {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! style=\\"width:5%;\\" Year ! style=\\"width:20%;\\" Award ! style=\\"width:40%;\\" Category ! style=\\"width:25%;\\" Nominee ! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Result ! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Ref(s) -  rowspan=\\"11\\" center;\\" 2018  rowspan=\\"11\\" Helpmann Awards Best Choreography in a Musical Andrew Hallsworth   rowspan=\\"11\\"  - Best Direction of a Musical Simon Phillips  - Best Female Actor in a Musical Maggie McKenna  - rowspan=\\"2\\"Best Female Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical Christie Whelan Browne  - Madeleine Jones  - Best Musical Sydney Theatre Company and Global Creatures  - Best New Australian Work PJ Hogan, Kate Miller-Heidke & Keir Nuttall  - Best Original Score Kate Miller-Heidke & Keir Nuttall  - Best Music Direction Isaac Hayward  - Best Costume Design Gabriela Tylesova  - Best Sound Design Michael Waters  } == Notes == : While these songs are titled the same, the latter is a reprise. : This song is retitled on the cast recording as simply \\"A True Friend\\". == External links == * == References == Category:2017 musicals Category:ABBA Category:Australian musicals Category:Musicals based on films ","title":"Muriel's Wedding (musical)"},{"id":"54209022","text":"Astartea pulchella is a shrub endemic to Western Australia.

Royal Collection Etching by Johannes Pieter de Frey, dated 1800 The Shipbuilder and his Wife is a 1633 painting by Rembrandt. The sitters were identified in 1970 as Jan Rijcksen (1560/2‚Äì1637) and his wife Griet Jans Rijcksen. Rijcksen was a shareholder in the Dutch East India Company, and became its master shipbuilder in 1620. The painting has been in the Royal Collection since 1811. At this relatively early date, Rembrandt was accomplished at depicting the natural surfaces of wood, leather, skin, and hair, and he had become a fashionable portrait painter. Rather than making the usual pair of separate husband-and-wife paintings, like his more typical Portrait of a Man Rising from His Chair and Portrait of a Young Woman with a Fan, Rembrandt combined them into a single double portrait, with the two sitters interacting. Rijcksen is shown seated as a desk, where he has been making drawings of ship designs, holding a pair of compasses; his wife has just entered the room to hand her husband a written note. The letter shown in the painting is addressed to \\"Jan ryensz\\" [sic] The drawing of a ship shown in the painting bears the signature and date: \\"Rembrandt. f: / 1633\\" This portrait is among the best documented of Rembrandt's works. It was recorded in the estate of the sitters' son Cornelis Jansz. Reijckx at his death in November 1659, and at two sales in Amsterdam: the sale of the collection of Jan Gildemeester in June 1800 to , and when it was sold again in August 1810. It was imported to England and sold at Christie's in London in 1811 to the Prince Regent (later King George IV) and remains in the Royal Collection. The oil on canvas painting measures but it may have been cut down from a larger work: an early etching dated 1800 shows more space above the sitters' heads.

His work for the Alliance for the Prosperity of the North Triangle Plan generated interest in the local press web. In August 2020 Valladares Urruela was charged by the Miami, Florida US Federal Court of helping launder close to $10 million proceeding from drug trafficking and other illegal activities. In May 2019 the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) had filed impeachment proceedings against him for attempts between 2012 and 2015 to influence votes in the Guatemalan legislature in favor of Tigo, the telephone company he headed. == Political career == Before taking the previously mentioned job, printed and digital media reports say that he worked in telecommunications. According to the Wikiguate site, Valladares Urruela was appointed in August 2015 as the Presidential Commissioner for Competitiveness and Investment. Previously, he had been the general director of the Tigo Foundation and president of the Guatemalan Telecommunications Union. He was also Chief of Corporate Affairs for the same telephone company. He is the son of Acisclo Valladares Molina, current ambassador for Guatemala to the United Kingdom. == Leader of the Alliance for the Prosperity of the Northern Triangle == Acisclo Valladares Urruela leads this project.

Guatemala will receive, in the first year of the Alliance's plan, $27 million. It is anticipated that the first funds of the United States will arrive in the country in October or November. Valladares Urruela is responsible for handing out those funds. == Charges of Corruption == Valladares Urruela has been dogged by charges of corruption over several years. In 2019 the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) filed impeachment proceedings against him for attempts between 2012 and 2015 to influence votes in the Guatemalan legislature in favor of Tigo, the telephone company he headed. CICIG was expelled from Guatemala by Jimmy Morales, the president Valladares Urruela went on to serve as Economics Minister. According to the US attorney's office, Valladares Urruela was charged by the Miami, Florida US Federal Court of helping launder close to $10 million as part of a network involving corrupt politicians and a ‚Äúcrooked bank employee‚Äù. Confirmation of Valladares Urruela's role may have come to light as part of plea deals by other Guatemalan politicians and business people currently held by the US justice system on charges of corruption and drug trafficking. Valladares was declared a fugitive from Guatemalan justice in January 2020 after he lost immunity upon leaving government and went into hiding to prevent his arrest. ==References== Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Government ministers of Guatemala ","title":"Acisclo Valladares Urruela"},{"id":"54209084","text":"Hatfield War Memorial The Hatfield War Memorial is a war memorial beside the Great North Road in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. It was one of 24 war memorials in England designed by Sir Herbert Baker, that were designated as a national collection by Historic England in 2017. The memorial is located near the gates of Hatfield House, and close to Hatfield railway station. It was unveiled in 1921, to commemorate 139 men from Hatfield killed on service during the First World War. A brick pavilion records the names of the dead, with further names added after the Second World War. The memorial comprises a Portland stone memorial cross, standing within a garden surrounded by brick walls to the north, west and south sides, and a yew hedge to the east, with an entrance gate in the wall to the south. Portland stone tablets with dedications listing the names of the dead are located in a brick shelter pavilion to the north side of the garden. The memorial cross is a typical Baker design, with an octagonal cross section, standing on an octagonal base. Baker had proposed a similar design of memorial cross to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), but a different design by Sir Reginald Blomfield was selected instead: the Cross of Sacrifice familiar at many CWGC cemeteries. Baker used versions of his cross in many of the municipal war memorials that he was commissioned to design after the First World War. He was also responsible for the design of 113 cemeteries on the Western Front, including Tyne Cot, Delville Wood South African National Memorial and Neuve- Chapelle Indian Memorial. The central wheel-headed Latin cross is decorated with roses and lilies representing England and France. It stands on an octagonal shaft and simple octagonal plinth, surrounded by a small octagonal pavement, in the centre of a grass lawn. A rectangular pavilion constructed of red brick stands to the north side of the garden, with three round-headed arches facing towards the cross in the south; the arches were later closed by metal railings. The hipped roof of the pavilion is covered with clay tiles, and the brick floor is laid in a herringbone pattern. The solid side and rear walls bear stone plaques with dedications and lists of names. Baker used similar brick shelters at other memorials, including some for the CWGC on the Western Front. The Portland stone plaques commemorate the 139 servicemen from Hatfield killed during the First World War. The names of a further 58 men and women were added after the Second World War, along with 34 civilians killed in the 503 bombing raids that affected the area, many targeting the de Havilland aircraft factory nearby . The memorial was built on land to the east of the Great North Road, near the gates leading to Hatfield House. The site was donated by James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury. Construction cost ¬£1,500. The memorial was unveiled on 12 June 1921 by Thomas Brand, 3rd Viscount Hampden (the Lord Lieutenant of Hertfordshire, who had commanded a battalion of the Hertfordshire Regiment) and dedicated by the Bishop of Exeter Lord William Cecil (the younger brother of the 4th Marquess). The names of the dead were read out at the ceremony by Lord Salisbury. The names of a further 58 men and women were added after the Second World War, along with the names of 34 civilians killed in the 503 bombing raids in the district. Two further names were added in 2014. The memorial was repaired in 1998. The main column was heavily weathered by 2013, and it was replaced in 2015. The memorial became a Grade II* listed building in May 2017. Nearby are the Grade II listed gates leading to the Grade I listed Hatfield House and its Grade I listed park, and a Grade II listed statue of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times.

In 1951 he was the first black man to earn an architecture degree from the University of Oregon (UO). Unthank worked on the courthouse in Lane County, Oregon; McKenzie Hall (formerly the UO School of Law building); and Kennedy Junior Middle School in Eugene, Oregon. He is the eponym of Unthank Hall at UO. == Early life and education == DeNorval Unthank Jr. was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on October 27, 1929, to Dr. DeNorval Unthank Sr., and Thelma Shipman Unthank. Shortly after he was born, the family moved to the Pacific Northwest, where his father served as one of Portland's first African American physicians, and was a co-founder of the Portland Urban League. In 1946 Unthank Jr. graduated from Franklin High School. He studied for two years at Howard University before returning to Oregon to attend the University of Oregon. Unthank met Doris Burgess in 1951 at the University of Oregon. She was a white student, a member of Gamma Phi Beta sorority. In May 1951, some men burned a cross on the sorority's lawn, and she was pressured to leave the sorority. Following Unthank's graduation from the School of Architecture, he and Burgess married on July 7, 1951, in the state of Washington, because interracial marriage was illegal in Oregon. They divorced in 1972. == Career == From 1952 to 1955, Unthank designed and built houses with Dick Chambers, who later started Chambers Construction Co. in Eugene. In 1955, Unthank began working for Wilmsen Endicott Architects. In 1960, he became a partner of the firm Wilmsen, Endicott and Unthank, Architects. In 1968, Unthank joined with Otto Poticha and Grant Seder in the firm of Unthank Seder Poticha Architects. By 1985, the firm also included Ed Waterbury, one of his former students. Unthank \\"designed schools, public buildings and business facilities around the state\\", including some in the Eugene area, including J.F. Kennedy Junior High School, and Springfield‚Äôs Thurston High School. From 1993-98, the firm was known as Unthank Waterbury.

The memorial was unveiled in 2005, near All Hallows by the Tower. The memorial is constructed from a large rectangular monolithic block of limestone from the Maltese island of Gozo. The block stands high and weighs 8.5 tons. It bears an inscribed black slate panel on each of its four sides. The main panel to the southeast recounts the Siege of Malta from 1940 to 1943, and the consequent loss of 7,000 lives of Maltese civilians and Allied and Commonwealth service personnel. A Maltese cross is displayed above this main panel. Further details of the siege are inscribed on a second panel on the northwest face of the memorial. The panel to the northeast gives details of the award of the George Cross, and the panel to the southwest has a map illustrating the Allied operations in the Mediterranean Sea. The stone was presented by the Government of Malta and erected by the George Cross Island Association in 2005, for the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. It was unveiled on 15 August 2005 by the President of Malta Eddie Fenech Adami, and dedicated by Vincent Nichols, then the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham, with a wreath laid by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The date was the 63rd anniversary of the arrival of the last surviving ship of the Operation Pedestal convoy at Valletta Grand Harbour that provided critical supplies during the siege. The unveiling was attended by approximately 100 veterans of the Malta campaign, and representatives of Allied and Commonwealth forces. The stone was a bright white colour when it was unveiled, but has been weathered and darkened. There is a further memorial to the George Cross Island Association at the National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas near Lichfield, and one in the Peace Garden of the former Anglican Church of St Luke, Liverpool. ==See also== * Malta Memorial * War Memorial (Floriana) * George Cross Island Association#Siege Bell Memorial ==References== * A tribute at last for the heroes who broke Siege of Malta, The Telegraph, 15 August 2005 * Malta GC ‚Äì Tower Hill, London, UK, waymarking.com * Maltese Memorial, War Memorials Online * Monument: Malta Siege, London Remembers * Malta GC memorial, London, Imperial War Museum * Malta George Cross Island Association memorial, Alrewas, Imperial War Museum * George Cross Island Association memorial, Liverpool, Imperial War Museum Category:2005 establishments in England Category:2005 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures in the City of London Category:Military memorials in London Category:Outdoor sculptures in London Category:World War II memorials in England Category:Stone monuments and memorials Category:Malta‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations ","title":"Malta George Cross Memorial"},{"id":"54209161","text":"Nepidermin (brand name Easyef), also known as recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF), is a recombinant form of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and a cicatrizant (a drug that promotes wound healing through formation of scar tissue).

He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice and a Purple Heart. He flew a North American P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft with the nickname \\"Bad Angel\\". Curdes was one of only three American pilots to shoot down aircraft belonging to the German, Italian and Japanese air forces. He was also involved in a bizarre incident where he intentionally shot down an American cargo plane, and then later married one of the survivors. In total, Curdes shot down seven German Messerschmitt Bf 109s, an Italian Macchi C.202 fighter, a Japanese Mitsubishi Ki-46 reconnaissance aircraft and an American Douglas C-47 Skytrain. ==Early life== Louis Curdes was born on November 2, 1919, to Esther (nee Kover) and Walter Curdes. He grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and enrolled at Purdue University. After nearly three years of study, Curdes joined the Army Reserve on March 12, 1942. He became a 2nd Lieutenant, and graduated from Flying School on December 3, 1942, at Luke Field, Arizona at the age of 22. Later he was sent to the Mediterranean theater to fight against the Germans in southern Europe. ==World War II== North Africa and Italy He joined the 329th Fighter Group, a unit of the United States Army Air Forces, but was transferred to the 82d Fighter Group, 95th Fighter Squadron, where he saw action in North Africa, Sardinia and Italy, flying a Lockheed P-38 Lightning. On April 29, 1943, he shot down three German Messerschmitt Bf 109 (Bf 109) aircraft and damaged a fourth near Cape Bon, in Tunisia. May 19th, he shot down two more Bf 109s near Villacidro, Sardinia. In less than a month of combat, Curdes was a flying ace. On June 24, he shot down an Italian Macchi C.202 over Sardinia. He damaged a German Bf 109 on July 30 over Pratica di Mare, Italy. His last two victories in Europe were two Bf 109s over Benevento, Italy. Capture and escape On August 27, 1943, Curdes was shot down whilst in combat with German aircraft over Salerno, Italy. He was captured by the Italians and sent to a prison camp near Rome. Suitable candidate for his victor could be Luftwaffe Experte Oblt. Franz Schiess (63.) of 8./JG 53, P-38F 40 km. S. Capua: no height at 13.11 (Film C. 2031/II Anerk: Nr.-). A few days later, the Italians surrendered to the Allies. In response to the Italian armistice, Germany invaded its former ally. Curdes and some other pilots escaped before the Germans took control of the POW camp. They reached Allied territory on May 24, 1944. Curdes was repatriated to the US and returned to his hometown in Fort Wayne. Curdes requested a return to active duty and joined the 4th Fighter Squadron and the 3rd Air Commando in the Pacific in August 1944, flying the P-51 Mustang. Pacific Campaign and shooting down an American aircraft By November 1944, parts of the Philippines were again under US control. His unit, the 3d Air Commando Group, had the task of bombing Japanese bases and providing support to ground troops. They also raided Japanese facilities along the coast of China and the island of Taiwan, providing escort duties to Allied ships, dropping supplies from the air, delivering mail, and evacuating the wounded. On February 7, 1945, Curdes flew a P-51 about southwest of Taiwan, where he destroyed a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft Mitsubishi Ki-46-II. By that time he had shot down aircraft from the three main countries of the Axis Powers: Germany, Italy and Japan. On February 10, Curdes, now a Lieutenant, formed a squadron of four aircraft that departed from Mangaldan Airfield in the Philippines. Their objective was to investigate if the Japanese were using a temporary air strip on the southern tip of Taiwan. No airfield could be found and Curdes returned to the Philippines. Flying over the island of Batan, the squadron split; Curdes and Lieutenant Schmidtke headed north, while Lieutenants Scalley and La Croix headed south. Scalley and La Croix located a small Japanese airfield and attacked it and also called for reinforcements; Curdes and Schmidtke headed south to join them. During the attack on the airfield, La Croix was shot down and made an emergency landing in the sea. As the squadron circled, Curdes could see that his companion had survived, and remained in the area to guide a rescue plane and protect the downed pilot. While covering La Croix, Curdes noticed a larger plane was preparing to land at the Batan airfield. He went to investigate and found the aircraft to be a Douglas C-47 transport with US insignia. Curdes tried to make contact by radio, but was not successful. He maneuvered his P-51 in front of the plane several times trying to get the C-47 to alter course, but the C-47 maintained its course. Curdes lined up his P-51 directly behind the C-47 and fired his .50 caliber machine guns into one of the C-47's two engines, causing it to fail. The C-47 still maintained its course for the Batan airfield so Curdes then disabled the remaining engine forcing the pilot to ditch in the sea. The plane successfully ditched without breaking up, and the crew was able to evacuate into a lifeboat. La Croix approached and was brought on board the C-47's life raft, where he was informed about the situation. The plane had apparently been lost in poor weather and its radio had stopped working. As it was also running out of fuel, the pilot headed directly to the island's airstrip, unaware that it was under Japanese control. At this point, the dusk and low level of fuel of the P-51 forced Curdes to return to base. The next morning, he accompanied the rescue PBY to pick up the downed C-47 pilot and 11 crew members, including two nurses, all of whom had survived the incident. To Curdes's surprise, he discovered that one of the nurses, named Svetlana Valeria Shostakovich Brownell, was a woman with whom he had had a date the night before the incident. Contrary to subsequent reports, Curdes did not receive a Distinguished Flying Cross for that event, although he did receive credit for the \\"Kill\\" and displayed it on his aircraft. His unit was later transferred to Gabu Airfield in Laoag, Philippines from where he attacked Japanese positions in northern Luzon and Okinawa until the end of the war. ==After the war== After World War II, he joined an Air National Guard unit at Baer Field and remained there until 1948. In Allen County, Indiana, April 2, 1946, he married Svetlana Valeria Curdes and returned to active duty, this time again with the United States Air Force. He participated in the Berlin airlift during the opening stages of the Cold War. He was promoted to Major on September 1, 1951, and retired from the Air Force as a Lieutenant Colonel in October 1963. After his retirement from the Air Force, he started a construction company under the name of Curdes Builders Company. Louis Curdes died on February 5, 1995, at the age of 75, and was buried at Lindenwood Cemetery in Fort Wayne. His widow Valeria died on October 10, 2013, at the age of 87. A replica of his aircraft, the P-51 named \\"Bad Angel\\" is currently in the Pima Air Museum in Tucson, Arizona. ==References== Category:United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II Category:1995 deaths Category:1919 births Category:People from Fort Wayne, Indiana Category:Purdue University alumni Category:American World War II flying aces Category:Aviators from Indiana Category:Military personnel from Indiana Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:United States Army Air Forces officers ","title":"Louis Edward Curdes"},{"id":"54209232","text":"was a mid-Edo period Japanese samurai, and the 8th daimy≈ç of Morioka Domain in northern Japan.

The film was directed by Les Clark. This animated short focuses on fire safety in the home. The original release of this short included a live-action introduction from Walt Disney. It was re-released in August 1984 without the Walt Disney introduction. == Plot ==  Introduction  The feature opens with the image of a burning house which pans out to reveal Walt Disney watching the scene on a television screen. Walt goes on to explain how many homes are lost to house fires every day in the United States and how many lives are lost, emphasizing the point that over a third of that number include small children. With the cooperation of local and national fire service authorities, the Disney company produced this short to instruct families on proper home fire safety precautions.  The Set Up  We transition from Walt Disney to a now animated house on fire, which is \\"rewound\\" to show the house undamaged before zooming in through the window to find Donald Duck sitting in an armchair, reading. A few feet from him are his nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie drawing up a fire escape plan in crayon. The boys explain to their Uncle that their school teacher had instructed them to design a plan in the event of a fire. They continue to suggest they find two separate exits from every room as well as choose a rendezvous point outside of the house in order to make sure everyone has escaped the building. Donald reacts nonplussed and attempts to brush his nephews away. The boys continue to explain they need collapsible ladders from the second floor. When they rehearse the use of a whistle as an alarm in the event of a fire at night, Donald loses his patience and angrily sends his nephews away. Immediately afterward Donald falls asleep in his armchair.  Common Sense  In Donald's dream, we meet his sense of precaution, or his Common Sense, depicted as a smaller Donald Duck wearing a fireman's coat and hat. Common Sense argues with Donald about not paying attention to his nephews, who were only trying to prepare him in the event of an emergency. Donald claims he doesn't need to prepare so Common Sense whisks him off to show him how unsafe his home is. Common Sense shows Donald a what-if scenario where a fire starts in his living room and what happens when the entire house is asleep. If Donald left his door open as he slept, the smoke mixed with noxious fumes would potentially kill him before the fire even made it up the stairs. If he had closed his door, the barrier would offer him a short window of fifteen to twenty minutes before the smoke and heat would overtake him. Common Sense tells Donald that in most cases, one would generally use natural exits to leave dangerous situations such as a door but during a fire that could be catastrophic. The best solution to exiting his room would be the window, but as his bedroom is on the second floor he would be stuck without a way down. Donald abruptly wakes from his sporadic nap and takes immediate action to prevent a fire emergency. He takes Huey, Dewey and Louie's crayon plan and sticks it up on the wall. He puts in a collapsible ladder in his room, makes sure the windows throughout the house open easily from the inside and the screens are easily removed, and adds a ladder to his garage for others to use from the outside. He gathers his nephews to tell them what the plan is in the event of an emergency, stressing that they should remain calm and never hide under the bed or in the closet as that can be a fatal mistake. Donald then initiates a fire drill where we see how the nephews escape their room through their window and down the ladder he placed outside. The instructions end with Donald and the boys going to a public fire department call box. The video ends with another live-action sequence featuring Walt Disney. He and Common Sense tell the audience that if we can't make a plan, or don't know how, to contact local fire departments and they should be able to devise a plan for us.  August 1984  This educational short was revised in 1984, excluding the original Walt Disney introduction. Instead, the same information is relayed via a voice over. There are new short live-action sequences enacted by human versions of Donald Duck as well as his nephews. The scenes involving Common Sense remain the original 1966 animated versions. Additions included in the 1984 revision consist of implementing smoke alarms in the home as well as the use of the EDITH system (Exit Drills In The Home). == Cast == * Clarence Nash as Donald Duck * Walt Disney as Himself * Dave Bodin as Uncle Don (1984 version) * Dick Bakalyan as Common Sense * Randy Josselyn as Nephew #1 (1984 version) * Mark-Paul Gosselaar as Nephew #2 (1984 version) * Josh Miller as Nephew #3 (1984 version) * Hal Smith as Common Sense (1984 version) == References External links== * Category:1966 animated films Category:1966 films Category:Disney animated short films, 1960s Category:Disney educational films Category:Donald Duck short films Category:Films directed by Les Clark Category:Fire protection Category:1960s educational films ","title":"Donald's Fire Survival Plan"},{"id":"54209373","text":"The 1975‚Äì76 Iraq FA Cup was the second edition of the Iraq FA Cup, and the first since the 1948‚Äì49 season.

It was published online in Korean and English by Lezhin Comics and won the ‚Ç©100,000,000 Grand Prize Award at the Second Lezhin World Comics Contest. ==Plot== The story follows Yoon Bum, a young, mentally ill man with a difficult past. After becoming infatuated with Oh Sangwoo, a peer from his time in the military who saved him from a rape attempt, he decides to enter Sangwoo's home while he is out of his house. Yoon Bum finds a tied up, bruised woman in Sangwoo's basement and before he is able to free her, he is discovered by Sangwoo, who is revealed to be a serial killer. Sangwoo then breaks his ankles and despite Yoon Bum's previous love for him, Sangwoo puts Bum into a highly abusive and manipulative relationship until the very end. ==Characters== *Yoon Bum (Ïú§Î≤î) Yoon Bum is the main character of Killing Stalking. Due to his parents dying when he was little, Bum was given to his grandmother and uncle with the latter severely abusing, raping and starving him, making Yoon Bum a lifelong abused victim due to also getting bullied in school, getting sexually abused and raped in military and Oh Sangwoo abusing him in several ways as well. Getting little to no affection from anyone, Bum frequently cut his wrists due to loneliness and gets attached to those who show him affection, making him a sensitive person. Central to Yoon Bum's character is his obsessive love for Oh Sangwoo, a university classmate with whom he serves in the military. Due to the requirement for mandatory military service in Korea, Bum receives affirmation of his enlistment after his first semester of college, despite his previous presumption that his low body weight would exempt him from active duty. He is ostracized in his unit, and his commander attempts to rape him. He is later told that the attempt was stopped by Sangwoo and it led Bum to see him as a savior. After Bum completed his military service, he sees Sangwoo with a girl, ending up in despair as he now thinks Sangwoo is straight. Bum's crush transforms into an obsession, mostly fueled due to the fact that Bum suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder and Sangwoo was one of the first persons who, in Bum's eyes, showed him affection by saving him. Although he attempts to deny his feelings of attachment toward Sangwoo, Bum is unable to stifle them and \\"wouldn't be able to forget as easily as before.\\" *Oh Sangwoo (Ïò§ÏÉÅÏö∞) Oh Sangwoo is the second main character of Killing Stalking, the primary Antagonist. He is a classmate of Yoon Bum after Bum enrolled college for 4 years and is enlisted in the same military unit as him. He saves Bum from an attempted rape by his superiors, which causes Sangwoo to become the object of Bum's obsessive affections. Sangwoo is frequently seen in the company of female admirers for his good looks. He adopts a \\"happy, energetic\\" face and is shown to be often smiling, even when making eye-contact with strangers in social surroundings. During his time in the university, he appears to be an extroverted person with a large circle of friends. According to Bum, he attracted many with his \\"empathetic, considerate, gentle aura\\". These traits, however, mask his true psychopathic, violent and sadistic characteristics. Sangwoo is actually a cruel and ruthless individual who kidnaps, abuses, tortures, rapes and kills people, showing absolutely no mercy to his victims or remorse for any of his actions. He's highly narcissistic and looks down on everyone, pretending that he actually cares for others, only to strike them with honest hostility when he feels like it. His emotions, when facing his victims, alternate unpredictably between fake mercy and violent hostility. When speaking to established acquaintances, he teases them in a light-hearted tone, and is not above making better acquaintances with strangers by doing so. Around his victims, he utilizes demeaning, harsh expletives, berating them with slurs. He tortures his victims slowly, yet with a certain pace, selecting to also manipulatively coddle them with simpering words and conduct before returning to his brutality. He appears to favor female victims, though not hesitant about males, either, despite having not murdered a man since his father's death in high school. *Yang Seungbae (ÏñëÏäπÎ∞∞) Yang Seungbae is a former investigator who has been demoted to patrolling police officer. As is noted by his superior, he appears to pry too much into investigations and trusts his (usually accurate) intuitions even when lacking evidence. Dutiful and prone to skepticism, he often second- guesses others' conclusions. These traits prove to be detrimental, as they cost him his position on the investigation team. Three years earlier, he had looked into the murder of Oh Sangwoo's parents. Though the case was declared cold, he investigated further and became suspicious of the assumption that the culprit was a burglar, finding the evidence of a break-in too convenient. This left him apprehensive of Sangwoo's character. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Killing Stalking Official Website on Lezhin * Killing Stalking Official Website on Lezhin Category:2016 webtoon debuts Category:Horror webtoons Category:South Korean webtoons Category:Drama webtoons ","title":"Killing Stalking"},{"id":"54209419","text":"Totacon, also known as Sweetwater, Tolacon, and Totlacon, is a populated place situated in northern Apache County, Arizona.

The trend began in 1995 when a stadium planned to be built in Hollywood Park was rejected by Los Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis in favor of relocating back to Oakland, California due to a stipulation that he would have had to share the stadium with a future second team. It was SoFi Stadium in Inglewood that the league ultimately accepted in a January 2016 meeting ending the league's absence in the market and the absence of a suitable long term stadium for NFL football. After five years of construction the stadium became the home of the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers in 2020. This article covers the numerous stadium proposals for Los Angeles between 1995 and 2016. Los Angeles Stadium Proposals by 2016 ==1999 expansion team plans== In early May 1998, entertainment guru Michael Ovitz announced he would lead a largely privately financed $750 million project to build a stadium and shopping center called \\"The Hacienda\\" in Carson, California in hopes of landing the expansion team. In late October 1998, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced that the NFL owners would indeed expand the league to 32 teams, and would decide by April 1999 which city would be awarded the NFL expansion franchise. Meanwhile, Ovitz now had competition coming from his own market, as real estate developer Ed Roski announced a rival bid for a future Los Angeles team; his proposal centered around putting a 68,000-seat stadium inside the shell of the historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. On March 16, 1999, the NFL owners, by a 29-2 vote, approved a resolution to award Los Angeles the expansion 32nd franchise. However, the award was contingent on the city's putting together an acceptable ownership team and stadium deal by September 15; if the parties could not reach an agreement or be close to doing so, the committee would then turn its recommendation to Houston who had also put in an expansion team bid to replace the departed Houston Oilers. A month later, NFL executives flew to Los Angeles. The executives were shocked at the lack of progress - Los Angeles would not allow tax dollars to be used for a new stadium, the competing groups were locked in a standoff as neither would concede its bid to the other nor would the groups agree to combine their efforts in attempts to put together a deal, and neither group was prepared to build a state-of-the-art facility, which rival expansion team bidder Houston had promised in all its bids since 1997. A return visit in late May yielded little change - Ovitz and Roski were still locked in a standoff; Roski's bid remained unchanged since the onset, while Ovitz unveiled plans to turn the area around the Coliseum into a complex of parks, parking garages, shopping areas and a brand-new stadium. Though Tagliabue and the NFL officials were pleased with the concept, they were daunted by the cost which included $225 million for parking garages, especially since neither Los Angeles nor the State of California was willing to commit the necessary funds. At this point, Tagliabue expressed his frustration with Los Angeles‚Äô inability to get a plan together, and the next month he advised Houston bidder Bob McNair to resume his discussions with the expansion committee. On September 9, 1999, the league's expansion committee indicated that McNair and other Houston officials should be prepared to attend an October 6 meeting of the NFL owners in Atlanta. The NFL noted that the Los Angeles effort was still making no progress and now featured a three-way battle between Ovitz, Roski, and newcomer Marvin Davis. Although the league would still entertain an offer from any of the competing Los Angeles groups, the league would now consider an offer from McNair and Houston as well. In the first week of October, Ovitz announced that his group was prepared to offer $540 million for the 32nd NFL franchise to be awarded to Los Angeles. However, later that week, McNair's Houston NFL Holdings proposed a bid of $700 million to the owners for the NFL to award the 32nd franchise to Houston instead; on the morning of October 6, 1999, McNair's persistence finally paid off as the NFL owners voted 29-0 to accept McNair's higher offer leading to the creation of the Houston Texans. ==Dodger Stadium parking lot (2005)== Several other sites were mentioned as possible locations for a new stadium. Then Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt had expressed interest in building a new football stadium next to Dodger Stadium (which is also near downtown Los Angeles). Angel Stadium of Anaheim was reconfigured as a baseball-only park in the mid-1990s, but there have been proposals to build a new football stadium next to it. The Dodger Stadium parking lot had been discussed by NFL owners, in private, as possibly being the best site in Southern California to build a new professional football stadium. Officials with the Dodgers and the NFL met in secret twice in 2005 to discuss the possibility of constructing a stadium and retail complex adjacent to Dodger Stadium. After the Boston Herald reported the details of the plan, political pressure forced both the NFL and Dodgers owner Frank McCourt to deny that either party was aggressively pursuing the idea. ==Los Angeles Stadium in Industry (2008)== Los Angeles Stadium was a proposed 75,000-seat football stadium, the centerpiece of a 600-acre entertainment district in Industry, California. Edward P. Roski, a part-owner of the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA and Los Angeles Kings of the NHL, announced plans for a stadium on the northern side of the interchange of state routes 57 and 60, east of Downtown Los Angeles with the purpose of attracting an NFL team to the Los Angeles region. Upon construction, the district would be named Grand Crossing, California. The Industry proposal, which received a full approval from all regulatory authorities but never found a willing team to move into the proposed stadium, sat dormant from 2011 until the Inglewood proposal was approved. History Roski, who helped build Staples Center, stated that the new 75,000-seat stadium would be privately financed and would be the centerpiece of a new 600-acre entertainment and retail complex in Industry which would have included 25,000 ample on-site parking spaces.Stadium Special Report The proposed stadium and mixed-use development was designed by Dan Meis, FAIA, and Aedas Sport out of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County site would have put it in reach of 12 million people in a radius, including in Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties, San Gabriel Valley and the San Fernando Valley. Roski and his spokesman asserted that a football stadium in the city could have meant as much as $400 million in yearly revenue to businesses and brought more than 18,000 jobs to the area.Dan Beighly,\\"Developer Appeals to Anaheim, OC with NFL Plan\\", Orange County Business Journal Online, June 2, 2008 Project supporters asserted that aspects of the stadium design, such as the use of hilly terrain to vastly reduce the cost of construction and the multi-use capabilities of the planned surrounding development, as well as Roski's success in gaining support from local elected officials in the City of Industry, where the proposed stadium site was located, gave the plan a strong possibility of success.CA will benefit overall as Roski and NFL move toward LA Stadium deal\\" Fox & Hounds daily, June 17, 2008. Project critics asserted that it required more public funding than had been stated, and questioned the costs and benefits of the project.Dave Zirin, \\"Football in L.A.\\", Los Angeles Times, October 29, 2009. Roski said he would not break ground on the stadium until he has a commitment from an NFL team to move to Los Angeles. In exchange for footing the bill to construct the stadium, Roski wanted at least a 30% ownership stake in any team that moved to Los Angeles to play there.Audio: John Semcken talks NFL stadium Given that the National Football League was not planning on expanding the developers of the new stadium stated on their website that their tenant would be an existing team \\"that needs to move because they cannot build a new stadium or financially they are not successful in their current market. We can not disclose which teams we are talking with.\\" The three teams which used to play in Los Angeles but moved elsewhere (the San Diego Chargers, St. Louis Rams and Oakland Raiders, the first two of which would eventually move back to Los Angeles) were suspected possible tenants. The Jacksonville Jaguars and the Minnesota Vikings had also been identified by Roski and others as possible prime tenants of the new stadium.Mark Craig, \\"California stadium group to target would-be NFL tenants\\", Minneapolis Star Tribune, October 8, 2009.\\"Stadium developer to ask six NFL teams to move to L.A.\\" , Los Angeles Daily News, October 8, 2009. The Minnesota Vikings were officially taken out of the race after a financial package providing for construction of a new stadium in Minneapolis was approved by both the Minnesota State Legislature and the Minneapolis City Council. The Jaguars also became no longer an option for Roski. Wayne Weaver, during his press conference announcement of selling the Jaguars to Shahid Khan during mid-season in 2011, explained that Roski did call him in an attempt to buy the team, but was instantly turned down, saying \\"It was a waste of my time and his\\". Khan said that he wants to put the city of Jacksonville on the map and had no plans to move the team. The Buffalo Bills were also considered a potential relocation candidate, but the city of Buffalo was able to force the team to sign an ironclad lease in 2012 prohibiting them from relocating and, through political and community pressure, dissuaded all Los Angeles-based prospective buyers from bidding on the team when it came up for sale in 2014, eventually selling to Terry and Kim Pegula. On February 28, 2009 the City of Industry city council approved the environmental impact report 5-0. The neighboring cities of Diamond Bar and Walnut both expressed concerns about the noise, traffic, and environmental impacts of the proposed stadium. WalnutWalnut files lawsuit over NFL stadium , San Gabriel Valley Tribune, March 25, 2009. and a Walnut-based citizens group comprising eight homeowners filed lawsuits to block the project,Local activists proceed with lawsuits against proposed NFL stadium in Industry, San Gabriel Valley Tribune, May 30, 2009. but were unsuccessful.Tim Rutten, \\"One- of-a-kind NFL stadium\\", Los Angeles Times, October 21, 2009. On April 8, 2009 the city of Diamond Bar unanimously approved a legal settlement that granted it more than $21 million in exchange for dropping objections to the stadium. Diamond Bar City Council members approved the agreement with the City of Industry. The settlement included $20 million to deal with increased traffic from the stadium and $1 million for a middle school athletic field. Diamond Bar also would have received at least $700,000 per year from Industry for community facilities as long as the stadium remained in operation. On September 23, 2009 the city of Walnut reached a settlement with the City of Industry and the stadium developer.Walnut to get $9 million, other concessions to drop NFL stadium lawsuit , San Gabriel Valley Tribune, September 23, 2009. A group of Walnut citizens refused to settle its lawsuit. The group insisted that the stadium have a domed roof and special freeway exits. On October 14, 2009 the state Senate approved a bill to exempt the proposed stadium from state environmental law, effectively killing the lawsuit filed by the citizen group. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill shortly thereafter.\\"Gov. Schwarzenegger signs bill for L.A.-area stadium construction\\", AP at NFL.com, October 22, 2009. This move cleared the last regulatory hurdle for the project: the only remaining barrier (aside from the financing) was the \\"small\\" (where others have failed previously) detail of finding an NFL team to fill the stadium.Environmental exemption for Industry NFL stadium earns state Senate approval, San Gabriel Valley Tribune, October 14, 2009. Jon Semcken III, a representative of Majestic Realty Group of Los Angeles, claimed in December 2009 that the company had a 50% chance of luring at least one existing NFL team to Los Angeles in time for the 2010 season, and that they were certain to have one by 2011. However, no teams moved to L.A. in either of those years. A tenant would have had to find a temporary home for at least one season (like the Rams and Chargers did when they moved back to Los Angeles) while the stadium was built. Shortly after the Inglewood stadium was chosen, Roski shifted focus to Las Vegas, where what is now known as Allegiant Stadium was being proposed for the Raiders. He withdrew his involvement from the project in October 2016. ==Farmers Field (2010)== Farmers Field was a proposed sports and events stadium in Downtown Los Angeles, California, United States, at the current site of the West Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center, adjacent to Staples Center. The project was spearheaded in 2010 by outgoing Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) president Tim Leiweke and former Los Angeles Avengers owner Casey Wasserman. The project marked AEG's second attempt at building a stadium there following a similar proposal in 2002. The Los Angeles City Council approved the project in a 12-0 vote in 2012, with the hope of the region fielding an NFL team for the first time since the Rams and Raiders left the Los Angeles area. History ICON Venue Group, a firm in the sports and entertainment industry, was hired by AEG to represent them in the entitlement process with the city of Los Angeles in February 2011. ICON had originally partnered with AEG in 2002 for AEG's first stadium proposal attempt. That project was to be located on the same site of AEG's current proposal. The new proposal was that the West Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center would be torn down and rebuilt further south at a cost of . Following the completion of the rebuilt West Hall, construction of a 72,000-seat retractable roof stadium would have begun over the 15 acre site. AEG expected to begin construction of the stadium by March 2013 and be completed by late 2016. Though the stadium itself was to be financed by AEG, the company proposed that the cost of the rebuilt West Hall of the convention center be funded by city issued bonds, which would have been repaid by taxes assessed on events in the proposed stadium as well as rent paid by AEG for using the land the stadium would have been on. The proposed stadium was suggested as a possible venue for future Super Bowls and NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championships. In December 2010, Magic Johnson announced his partnership with AEG's proposal after selling his minority stake in the Los Angeles Lakers NBA team and multiple Starbucks coffeehouse locations. The project announced in mid-2010 was initially projected at a cost of US$750 million. The feasibility of constructing a 72,000-seat (expandable to 76,000 seats for special events such as the Super Bowl) retractable roof stadium at the announced cost came into question when compared to the two newest facilities of the NFL, AT&T; Stadium and MetLife Stadium, which were built at a cost of US$1.3 and US$1.6 billion, respectively. Shortly thereafter, Leiweke set a formal timeline for the proposed project. The project's estimated total cost was US$1.2 billion as of 2011. On February 1, 2011, Farmers Insurance Group announced it had signed a 30-year, $700 million naming rights deal for the stadium, with the stadium to be called Farmers Field. The deal was potentially worth $1 billion if two NFL teams relocated to Farmers Field. In a February 2011, Farmers emphasized that its naming rights agreement would be spread out over 30 years and that it could walk away from the deal if the Los Angeles stadium wasn't completed. \\"While we have every confidence that this project will get done, if it does not materialize, Farmers Insurance will pay no money for the project,\\" said Mark Toohey, senior vice president at Farmers. On March 25, 2011, Gensler was selected by AEG to design the proposed football stadium. Five teams; the Minnesota Vikings, San Diego Chargers, St. Louis Rams, Jacksonville Jaguars and Oakland Raiders were speculated as candidates for relocation. The Vikings were the front-runners until they were taken out of consideration after the Minnesota State Senate approved a financing package that would allow the team to build a new stadium on the former footprint of the Metrodome in Minneapolis, which opened in August 2016. The Los Angeles City Council approved the project in a 12-0 vote on September 28, 2012. The building of the stadium was contingent on reaching a deal with the NFL and a team agreeing to move to Los Angeles. Teams were allowed to begin applying to make that move beginning January 1, 2013. With the departure of Leiweke from AEG, it became less likely that AEG would participate in the construction of Farmers Field. By May 2014, the prospects for a downtown stadium had diminished to such a degree that a committee of the Los Angeles City Council voted to move forward with alternative plans to expand the Convention Center without the stadium.David Zahniser, \\"L.A. council panel moves forward with Convention Center backup plan\\", Los Angeles Times, May 27, 2014. On March 9, 2015, AEG announced that it would not seek an extension for its April 17 deadline to reach an agreement with an NFL team, effectively shutting down the proposal. The St. Louis Rams had reached an agreement with Inglewood to build an 80,000 seat stadium two weeks earlier, while the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers had expected their joint stadium bid to be approved by Carson in the coming months, eliminating the need for a third party to build a stadium. AEG had invested over $50 million in the project over five years. Legal challenge and settlement In 2009, AEG pushed for a state law that limited potential legal challenges against the stadium to a 175-day period. A coalition of anti-poverty groups, including Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA CAN), opposed the construction of the stadium in its proposed location, due to the negative effect it was perceived to have on health, traffic, noise, and affordable housing. In a settlement announced November 1, 2012, the coalition, called Play Fair at Farmers Field, secured \\"$50 million in concessions... including $10.3 million for a new platform at a Metro Blue Line station and $8 million in upgrades to a plaza outside the Convention Center.\\" ==Carson Stadium (2015)== Carson Stadium, referred to in renderings as Los Angeles Stadium, was an American football stadium planned to be built in Carson, California, 13 miles (21 km) south of downtown Los Angeles. It was proposed to become the joint home of the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders. The Chargers and Raiders planned the shared, $1.7 billion stadium in the city of Carson, if both teams had failed to get new stadiums in their current hometowns. However, NFL owners failed to approve the stadium, instead opting for a new NFL stadium in Inglewood proposed by Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke. History Since 2007, the Chargers had an option every February 1 to terminate their lease at Qualcomm Stadium, their home at the time since 1967. Under the lease terms, the Chargers would have owed the city an exit fee in the amount of $17.6 million if they had relocated in or before 2015. The team had been working to build a publicly funded stadium since 2002 and proposed a new stadium as part of a convention center annex. However, the plan faced opposition from local politicians and hotel owners who voiced a preference for an expansion of the existing San Diego Convention Center. The Raiders had been working with Oakland politicians to build a commercial development project dubbed the Coliseum City project that would have included new stadiums for the Raiders and the Oakland Athletics baseball team, who shared Oakland Coliseum, which opened in 1966. The team offered to contribute $300 million with an additional $200 million coming from the NFL, but that left $500 million of funding to be determined and Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf expressed opposition to using public funds. The Raiders had been on a year-to- year lease on the Coliseum since the previous long-term lease ended after the 2013 season. On February 19, 2015, the Chargers and Raiders announced plans for a privately financed $1.7 billion stadium that the two teams would build in Carson if they were to move to the Los Angeles market. However, both teams stated that they would continue to attempt to get stadiums built in their respective cities. The site of the planned stadium was largely on a former landfill next to the 405 freeway. It had been looked at in the 1970s and 1980s by the Rams and Raiders respectively as a possible new stadium site and was the Carson site explored by Michael Ovitz in 1998 for a stadium and shopping center. On April 22, 2015, the Carson City Council bypassed the option to put the stadium to a public vote and approved the plan 3-0. On May 5, 2015, the Carson City Council then unanimously approved $50 million to finish an environmental cleanup on the site. On May 19, 2015, the Chargers and Raiders announced that they had finalized a deal to secure the 157 acres of land in Carson, which was transferred to a joint powers authority in Carson after the site was purchased by Carson Holdings, a company set up by the two teams. The council voted without having clarified several issues, including who would finance the stadium, how the required three-way land swap would be performed, and how it would raise enough revenue if only one team moved in as tenant. It was these issues that would work against the project in Carson from being voted on successfully at the later NFL meeting on relocation of the Raiders and Chargers. On November 11, 2015, Bob Iger, then CEO of The Walt Disney Company, was appointed non-executive chairman of the Carson stadium project. During the Los Angeles meeting on January 12, 2016, the Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities, which consisted of six NFL owners, favored the Carson project over the Rams' Inglewood project. But, the NFL and the other NFL owners voted to allow the Rams to move back to Los Angeles while giving the Chargers an option to join them which they accepted a year later (the Raiders would have had the same option had the Chargers declined) thus effectively rejecting and killing the Carson proposal. An outlet mall was later approved for the site to and is set to open in 2021. The Chargers would play from 2017 until 2019 in Carson at Dignity Health Sports Park until SoFi Stadium in Inglewood was completed. Design In April 2015, the Chargers and Raiders presented the stadium design renderings to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the league's Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities. The proposed stadium was proposed to be open-air with natural turf, had a peristyle design inspired by the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and a tower that would rise between 115 and 120 feet above the main concourse, and which, depending on which team is playing, would display simulated lightning bolts (for the Chargers) or a flame in honor of the late Al Davis (for the Raiders). The stadium design was retained by the Raiders and was re-proposed minus the Chargers features and with a dome, black exterior and roll out field for the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. ==See also== * History of the National Football League in Los Angeles ==References== Category:Proposed buildings and structures in California Category:Unbuilt stadiums in the United States Category:City of Industry, California Category:Proposed National Football League venues in Los Angeles Category:Proposed sports venues in Greater Los Angeles Category:L.A.

It is caused by genetic defects in MTHFR, which is an important enzyme in the methyl cycle. Common variants of MTHFR deficiency are asymptomatic and have only minor effects on disease risk. Severe variants (from nonsense mutations) are vanishingly rare. == Symptoms == The common MTHFR deficiencies are usually asymptomatic, although the 677T variant can cause a mildly increased risk of some diseases. For individuals homozygous in the 677T variant, there is a mildly elevated risk of thromboembolism (odds ratio 1.2), and stroke (odds ratio 1.26). There is also an elevated risk of neural tube defects among children of individuals with the C677T polymorphism (odds ratio 1.38). For cardiovascular risk, common MTHFR deficiencies were once thought to be associated but meta-analyses indicate that correlation this was an artifact of publication bias. == Causes == MTHFR is the rate-limiting enzyme in the methyl cycle, which includes the conversion of homocysteine into methionine. Defects in variants of MTHFR can therefore lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. There are two common variants of MTHFR deficiency. In the more significant of the two, the individual is homozygous for the 677T polymorphism. This variant in particular is the most common genetic cause of hyperhomocysteinemia. The resulting enzyme is thermolabile and in homozygotes, enzymatic activity is depressed to 35% of its usual level. The second variant is a milder one, caused by a homologous 1298C polymorphism. This leads to 68% of the control values of enzyme activity, and it normally does not lead to low serum folate. ==Diagnosis== MTHFR deficiency is diagnosed by genetic testing. == Management == In common forms of MTHFR deficiency, elevated plasma homocysteine levels have sometimes been treated with Vitamin B12 and low doses of folic acid. Although this treatment significantly decreases the serum levels of homocysteine, this treatment is not thought to improve health outcomes. Due to the ineffectiveness of these treatments, it is no longer considered clinically useful to test for MTHFR in most cases of thrombophilia or recurrent pregnancy loss. == Prognosis == Whether MTHFR deficiency has any effect at all on all- cause mortality is unclear. One Dutch study showed that the MTHFR mutation was more prevalent in younger individuals (36% relative to 30%), and found that elderly men with MTHFR had an elevated mortality rate, attributable to cancer. Among women, however, no difference in life expectancy was seen. More recently, however, a meta-analysis has shown that overall cancer rates are barely increased with an odds ratio of 1.07, which suggests that an impact on mortality from cancer is small or zero. == Epidemiology == The prevalence of 677T homozygozity varies with race. 18-21% of Hispanics and Southern Mediterranean populations have this variant, as do 6-14% of North American Whites and <2% of Blacks living outside of Africa. The prevalence of the 1298C mutation is lower, at 4-12% for most tested populations. A study in 2000 had identified only 24 cases of severe MTHFR deficiency (from nonsense mutations) across the whole world. == See also == * Hyperhomocysteinemia * Homocystinuria * Cystathionine beta synthase == References  External links == Category:Mutation Category:Metabolic disorders ","title":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency"},{"id":"54209469","text":"Cheyenne South Side Historic District is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

In the north Atlantic basin, they are known as hurricane tracking charts. New tropical cyclone information is available at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere and at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere. Charts include maps of the areas where tropical cyclones form and track within the various basins, include name lists for the year, basin- specific tropical cyclone definitions, rules of thumb for hurricane preparedness, emergency contact information, and numbers for figuring out where tropical cyclone shelters are open. In paper form originally, computer programs were developed in the 1980s for personal home and use by professional weather forecasters. Those used by weather forecasters saved preparation times, allowing tropical cyclone advisories to be sent an hour earlier. With the advent of the internet in the 1990s, digitally-prepared charts began to include other information along with storm position and past track, including forecast track, areas of wind impact, and related watches and warnings. Geographic information system (GIS) software allows end users to underlay other layered files onto forecast storm tracks to anticipate future impacts. ==History== Cape Verde hurricane tracks Hurricane Arlene and Tropical Storm Bret logged and plotted Tropical cyclone tracking charts were initially used for tropical cyclone forecasting and towards the end of the year for post season summaries of the season's activity. Their use led to an north Atlantic- based term still in use today: Cape Verde hurricane. Prior to the early 1940s, the term Cape Verde hurricane referred to August and early September storms that formed to the east of the surface plotting charts in use at the time. By October 1955, charts used for tropical cyclone tracking and forecasting operationally, such as United States Weather Bureau Form 770-17 and National Weather Service Chart HU-1, extended eastward to the African coast. Within the United States since at least 1956, during the Atlantic hurricane season, those within threatened states were provided hurricane tracking charts in order to follow tropical storms and hurricanes during the season for situational awareness. This was more popular along sections of the southern Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast of the United States than the coast of California due to their increased danger of a landfalling tropical cyclone. The maps would include place names, latitude and longitude lines, names of the storms on that year's list, along with hurricane preparedness information. Newspapers, television stations, radio stations, banks, restaurants, grocery stores, insurance companies, gas stations, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state departments of emergency management, the National Weather Service, and its subagency the National Hurricane Center were the main suppliers of these charts. Companies would distribute these for free as they were considered good advertising. Some would have a table where you could enter data prior to plotting the storm's position, usually using an associated tropical cyclone symbol: open circle for tropical depression, open circle with curved lines on opposite sides of the circle for tropical storms, and a closed circle with curved lines on opposite sides of the circle for hurricanes. The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards Department started preparing special tropical cyclone tracking charts for its archipelago in the 1980s. Initially, the charts were in paper form. Magnetic charts appeared in 1956. By 1974, laminated paper was used, and by 1977 maps were placed under glass, so that grease pencil, washable marker, or dry erase marker could be used and that the map could be used for multiple seasons. Starting in the 1980s with the increasing popularity of personal computers, programs were available to track the storms digitally, and databases of past storms could be maintained. However, computational space requirements did not allow access to the entire hurricane database for a related basin until the 1990s, with the advent of more powerful computers with megabytes of storage and file quantities became less limited in computer directory structures. Starting in the mid 1990s, with the popularity of the World Wide Web, web sites kept images of old hurricane tracks and interactive web sites allowed you to specify parameters for the storms you wished to display. Ongoing storms have tracking charts with forecast track overlaid. Since 2004, GIS software has been available for hurricane tracking. ==Move away from paper use operationally== NHC official forecast for Ernesto (2006) is light blue, while the storm's actual track is the white line over Florida. Historically, tropical cyclone tracking charts were used to include the past track and prepare future forecasts at Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers. The need for a more modernized method for forecasting tropical cyclones had become apparent to operational weather forecasters by the mid-1980s. At that time the United States Department of Defense was using paper maps, acetate, grease pencils, and disparate computer programs to forecast tropical cyclones. The Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF) software was developed by the Naval Research Laboratory for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) beginning in 1986, and used since 1988. During 1990 the system was adapted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for use at the NHC, National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. This provided the NHC with a multitasking software environment which allowed them to improve efficiency and cut the time required to make a forecast by 25% or 1 hour. ATCF was originally developed for use within DOS, before later being adapted to Unix and Linux. Despite ATCF's introduction, into the late 1990s, a National Hurricane Center forecaster stated that the most important tools available were \\"a pair of dividers to measure distance, a ruler, a brush for eraser dirt, three sharp pencils colored red, black, and blue, and a large paper plotting chart\\". ==Markings used== Tropical cyclone symbols used by the National Hurricane Center A JTWC image of the track of Cyclone Quang from April 2015 Track of Hurricane Irma from 2017 with colored dots representing Saffir-Simpson scale intensities Symbols used within the charts vary by basin, by center, and by individual preference. Simple dots or circles can be used for each position. The National Hurricane Center uses a variety of symbols composed of overlapping 6's and 9's for tropical storms and hurricanes to emulate their circulation pattern, and a circle for tropical depressions. Other Northern Hemisphere centers used the overlapping 6 and 9 symbols for all tropical cyclones of tropical storm strength, with L's reserved for tropical depressions or general low pressure areas in the tropics. Southern Hemisphere versions would use backward overlapping 6's and 9's. The World Meteorological Organization uses an unfilled symbol to depict tropical storms, a filled symbol to depict systems of cyclone/hurricane/typhoon strength, and a circle to depict a tropical low or tropical convective cluster. Colors of the symbols may be representative of the cyclone's intensity. An example of a chart for Matthew showing its five-day forecast track A black and white track chart for Hurricane Floyd (1999) using a conic projection Lines or dots connecting symbols can be varying colors, solid, dashed, or symbols between the points depending on the intensity and type of the system being tracked. Different colors could also be used to differentiate storms from one other within the same map. If black and white markings are used, tropical depression track portions can be indicated by dots, with tropical storms indicated by dashes, systems of cyclone/hurricane/typhoon strength using a solid line, intermittent triangles for the subtropical cyclone stage, and intermittent plus signs for the extratropical cyclone phase. Systems of category 3 strength or greater on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale can be depicted with a thicker line. ==Sources of information== In order to use a hurricane tracking chart, one needs access to latitude/longitude pairs of the cyclone's center and maximum sustained wind information in order to know which symbol to depict. New tropical cyclone information is available at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers. In decades past, newspaper, television, and radio (including weather radio) were primary sources for this information. Local television stations within threatened markets would advertise tropical cyclone positions within the morning, evening, and nightly news during their weather segments. The Weather Channel includes the information within their tropical updates every hour during the Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons. Starting in the mid 1990s, the World Wide Web allowed for the development of ftp and web sites by the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia,Bureau of Meteorology. Tropical Cyclone Advices, Bureau of Meteorology, 2009. Canadian Hurricane Centre,Canadian Hurricane Centre (2004). Canadian Hurricane Centre's Responsibilities. Environment Canada. Retrieved on 2009-02-16. Central Pacific Hurricane Center, the Nadi Tropical Cyclone Centre/Fiji Meteorological Service, Japan Meteorological Agency, Joint Typhoon Warning Center, M√©t√©o-France La R√©union, National Hurricane Center, and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration which allows the end user to get their information from their official products. ==Use== The maps either use a mercator projection if restricted to the tropics and subtropics, but can use a Lambert conformal conic projection if the maps reach towards the arctic for the North Atlantic basin where tropical cyclones move more poleward. Meteorologists use these maps to estimate a system's initial position based on aircraft, satellite, and surface data within surface weather analyses. The data is then analyzed to determine recent storm motion and create and convey forecast tracks, wind swaths, uncertainty, related watches, and related warnings to end users of tropical cyclone forecasts. Hurricane tracking charts allow people to track ongoing systems to form their own opinions regarding where the storms are going and whether or not they need to prepare for the system being tracked, including possible evacuation. This continues to be encouraged by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Hurricane Center. Some agencies provide track storms in their immediate vicinity, while others cover entire ocean basins. One can choose to track one storm per map, use the map until the table is filled, or use one map per season. Some tracking charts have important contact information in case of an emergency or to locate nearby hurricane shelters. Tracking charts allow tropical cyclones to be better understood by the end user. ==Hurricane tracker apps== A number of Hurricane tracker apps are also available online to install directly over a smartphone. By using these apps, one can easily track the current activity of the Hurricanes. Red Cross has also launched several applications for this purpose. ==References== tracking chart ","title":"Tropical cyclone tracking chart"},{"id":"54209578","text":"Economy Advertising Company is a historic building located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States. Its importance is the association this company had with John Towner Frederick, and the journal he founded and edited, The Midland. with This was a literary magazine that focused on regional literature from the Midwest. It featured writers whose work was not being accepted by literary journals in the eastern U.S. that dominated national literary circles. While The Midland had several offices during its run from 1915 to 1934, Economy Advertising Company typeset, printed and bound every edition of the journal. They also provided financial support. Frederick had worked here as an apprentice when he was a student at the University of Iowa. He went on to become the first educator to organize and teach a course in American literature when he taught at the University of Iowa. Together with Frank Luther Mott, who was sometimes a co-editor of the journal, he organized the Saturday Luncheon Club, a literary forum that was a forerunner of the Iowa Writer's Workshop. When Frederick took a position at Northwestern University, the magazine relocated to Chicago. The Midland was never financially self- sufficient, and Frederick took on its deficits himself. Financial factors finally doomed it in 1933. Economy Advertising was founded around 1896 by Samuel W. Mercer. He had this two-story brick building constructed in 1923. In addition to The Midland, Economy published hard back books under the \\"Clio Press\\" imprint, and for several years printed the State Historical Society of Iowa's journal, The Palimpsest. They also published literary works edited by Mott that included Grant Wood's Revolt Against the City.

The band is currently signed to BMG. ==History== Cousins Jonathan Capeci and Joey Beretta grew up together around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Throughout their childhood and teenage years, they played in a number of bands together, but as they reached college, they dropped out and relocated to Nashville to pursue their project at the time, Dinner And A Suit. As that project dissolved, Capeci and Beretta regrouped with friends Stephen Cunsolo and Nicholas Sainato to form Nightly. The project lacked momentum until they signed with Interscope Records in July 2016,https://www.instagram.com/p/BIc3wDDjUd-/ and began work on their debut EP. After the release of the leading single, \\"XO\\" on May 10, Nightly's first EP, titled Honest, was released on October 21, 2016. The EP contained 4 songs, with \\"XO\\" being the most successful. Spotify featured \\"XO\\" on multiple playlists throughout the Summer, which skyrocketed it to over 2 million plays in a matter of weeks.https://twitter.com/jonathancapeci/status/734520676304998403 As of summer 2017, \\"Talk To Me\\" will be the next promoted single from the EP. On March 6, 2017, Nightly released their first music video for the track \\"XO\\" off of their debut EP. They collaborated on the video with Tobias Nathan and Jake Saner. Capeci said that they picked Nathan specifically for the video due to his grasp on color. They have worked with Nathan again on their upcoming music video for \\"Talk To Me\\", due out in 2017. The band toured extensively throughout the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017, opening for acts like Ke$ha, The All-American Rejects, Zella Day, and K.Flay. After being featured at the We Found New Music showcase at SXSW, they found their footing and embarked on their first headline tour in April 2017, with support from Saint Mesa. They finished out their year of touring with bands such as Urban Cone, The Struts, and The Night Game, while also playing at Bonnaroo for the first time. On January 22, 2018, Nightly was announced as support for NF on his sold-out headline USA tour. They performed on 28 dates of this tour, earning them a massive following on social media. While on tour, Nightly released their single \\"Miss You Like Hell\\" on February 16. Soon followed up by their most recent single \\"Holding On\\", released on March 22. In August of 2019, the band announced that they had signed a new record deal with BMG. In the notes app screenshots they shared on social media, they also explained how challenging the past year was and that they needed to postpone their upcoming tour. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Indie pop groups from Tennessee Category:Musical groups from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Musical groups established in 2016 ","title":"Nightly (band)"},{"id":"54210241","text":"Latvians in Russia are a small ethnic minority scattered across various regions of Russia. According to the 2010 census, 18,979 people in Russia identified themselves as ethnic Latvians, down from 28,520 in 2002. ==History== Latvian language in the Russian Empire (1897) There have been several waves of migration of Latvians to Russia following the annexation of the Latvian lands by the Russian Empire in the 18th century. During the 19th century, many landless Latvian peasants moved eastwards, establishing settlements in Siberia and the Urals. Thousands of Latvians migrated to Russia as refugees during the First World War. A number of Latvian Bolshevik politicians and activists settled down in Russia after the Russian civil war and became members of the Soviet state leadership. According to the results of the First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union of 1926, more than 151 thousand ethnic Latvians lived in the USSR. Numerous Latvian cultural organizations, publishing houses and schools were created in various regions of the USSR. The largest and most influential organization was Prometejs Society, headquartered in Moscow.–õ–∞—Ç—ã—à—Å–∫–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ \\"–ü—Ä–æ–º–µ—Ç–µ–π\\" ‚Äì by Memorial In the 1930s, thousands of Latvians faced repressions by the regime of Joseph Stalin. Starting from November 1936, the NKVD carried out the so-called \\"Latvian Operation\\", a mass campaign of repressions targeting specifically persons of Latvian origin. First of all, the targets were activists of Latvian organizations, former Red Latvian Riflemen, immigrants from independent Latvia, and even senior governmental officials and prominent communist revolutionaries like JƒÅnis Rudzutaks, Jukums VƒÅcietis, JƒÅnis Bƒìrzi≈Ü≈°, and others.

During the Perestroika in the 1980s, new organizations of the Latvian diaspora have been established in major cities. Many Latvians went back from Russia to Latvia following the Collapse of the Soviet Union and the restoration of the independence of Latvia. ==Latvian settlements in Russia== An autonomous Latvian municipality exists in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan ‚Äì the Arch-Latvian Selsoviet. Latvian settlers came to the region in the 19th century.Juris Lorencs. Ba≈°kƒ´rijƒÅ, latvie≈°os The Latvian municipality was established in the 1920s, during the ethnic emancipation of the early Soviet years (Korenizatsiya).

Since the solution is symmetric above the plane y=0, it is enough to describe only half of the flow, say for y>0. If we look for v a solution, that is independent of x, the continuity equation dictates that the horizontal velocity u can at most be a linear function of x.Proudman, I. (1960). An example of steady laminar flow at large Reynolds number. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 9(4), 593-602. Therefore, Berman introduced the following form, :\\\\eta = \\\\frac{y}{h}, \\\\quad \\\\psi(x,\\\\eta) = [h\\\\bar u_o-xV]f(\\\\eta), \\\\quad u = \\\\left(u_o - \\\\frac{Vx}{h}\\\\right)f'(\\\\eta), \\\\quad v=V f(\\\\eta) where u_o(\\\\eta) is an arbitrary function and it will be eliminated out of the problem in due course.

Integrating once, we get :f' + \\\\operatorname{Re} (f'^2 - ff) = C with boundary conditions :f(0)=f(0)= f(1)-1=f'(1)=0 This third order nonlinear ordinary differential equation requires three boundary condition and the fourth boundary condition is to determine the constant C. and this equation is found to possess multiple solutions.Wang, C-A., T-W.

He studied birth trauma, cerebral palsy, and other neurological disabilities in children. ==Early life== Bronson Crothers was born in 1884 in Elmira, New York. His father was a Unitarian minister. Crothers grew up in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and later moved with his family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he attended Cambridge Latin School. He graduated from Harvard College in 1904 and from Harvard Medical School in 1909. ==Career== Crothers completed his residency training at Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital, and in 1915 he joined the Massachusetts General Hospital Unit of the British Royal Army Medical Corps. When the United States entered the war, he transferred to the U.S. Army Medical Corps. After the war, he studied at the Neurological Institute of New York, and in 1920 he returned to Boston, where he was appointed a neurologist at the Children's Hospital and joined the Harvard faculty. He was appointed clinical professor of pediatrics in 1944 and, upon his retirement, became professor emeritus in 1952. Crothers' main field of research was neurological birth trauma, referring to injuries to the nervous system that occur during birth, including cerebral palsy, brachial plexus injuries and spinal cord injuries. He wrote about the importance of emotional wellbeing in children with neurological disabilities, and advocated for psychological support to be provided to these children. He served as president of the American Pediatric Society, co-founded the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy, and chaired Herbert Hoover's 1932 White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. ==Death and legacy== Crothers died from spinal muscular atrophy on July 17, 1959, at his summer home in Sorrento, Maine. He was posthumously awarded the John Howland Award by the American Pediatric Society in 1960. In 1961, Harvard Medical School established the Bronson Crothers Professorship of Neurology.

School districts and community college boards are not usually considered special-purpose governments despite their narrow focus on education. Illinois has the most special districts of any U.S. state. The exact number depends on how one defines a ‚Äúspecial district.‚Äù The United States Census Bureau has determined that Illinois has 3,227 special-purpose governments as of June 30, 2012; the most of any U.S. state. The Office of the Illinois Comptroller, which uses a broader definition that includes special districts without budget autonomy, determined the state has 4,755 as of December 2015. The various districts may enact ordinances, rules, and regulations to carry out their various duties. Most have police powers to enforce those rules. Special districts have other powers granted to them by relevant laws. == Active districts ==  Airport authorities  Illinois state statute authorized the creation of airport authorities July 1, 1945. These authorities are created by the circuit court judge upon voter petition and after hearing and referendum. Each authority is governed by a board of commissioners that is appointed by municipal, county, or state officials depending on criteria specified by the authorizing legislation. Three airport authorities have been created by special acts; Crawford County Airport Authority, Greater Metropolitan Airport Authority of Peoria County and the Metropolitan Airport Authority of Rock Island County. Authorities may locate, construct, improve, maintain, operate, and lease a public airport and related facilities within their corporate limits or upon adjacent property. Authorities have the power of eminent domain. The tax rate limit is 0.075%. The board may issue debt up to 2.3% of the district's equalized assessed value.  Bi-State Metropolitan Development District  The Bi-State Metropolitan Development District is an interstate compact formed by Missouri and Illinois in 1949. Since February 2003 the agency has been doing business as Metro. There are ten members of the board; five appointed by local officials from each state.

In 2012, DuPage County performed a review that found a variety of small units of government that provide mosquito abatement, sanitary and street lighting services cost taxpayers $300 million annually. These districts included small entities such as the one square mile Century Hill Street Lighting Districthttps://www.dupageco.org/CountyBoard/Appointive_Bodies/Docs/36854/ whose board members had wanted to dissolve the district, but were unable to. In response, Tom Cullerton introduced SB 494 as a pilot program to allow for consolidation of these types of government bodies. The bill would allow the DuPage County Board to pass ordinances to dissolve thirteen small units of government after an audit issued by the County Board Chair was completed. The dissolution of a district could to be overturned via referendum by voters in that district. The bill's cosponsors included suburban legislators and it was supported by Republican County Board Chair Dan Cronin. On April 25, the bill was passed unanimously in the Illinois Senate and on May 6, its house counterpart sponsored by Deb Conroy passed the Illinois House of Representatives with 108 yes votes. The bill was signed into law by Pat Quinn in August. Since then, DuPage County has been able to pass an ordinance to dissolve the Fairview Fire Protection District. In 2015, Representative Jack Franks a co-sponsor of SB 494 proposed legislation to give McHenry and Lake counties the same ability to consolidate small, special purpose districts. In 2015, Bruce Rauner created a 28-member bipartisan Government Consolidation and Unfunded Mandates Task Force chaired by Evelyn Sanguinetti, then the Lieutenant Governor of Illinois with a focus on reducing unfunded mandates and promoting consolidation of special districts. == References == Illinois ","title":"Special districts in Illinois"},{"id":"54210990","text":" USS LST-944 was an in the United States Navy.

He wrote the Magic Mushroom Cultivation book in 1977, it contained his research on several ways to cultivate magic mushrooms, including the cultivation in brown rice that was later demonstrated to produce mushrooms of high psilocybin content. Pollock isolated a strain of P. tampanensis that produced sclerotia of a size much bigger than known before. This discovery enabled a means of using psilocybin in places where magic mushrooms are illegal, such as after the magic mushroom ban in Amsterdam on December 1, 2008. Pollock envisioned creating the first legal medical mushroom research laboratory and estimated he would need about 2 million dollars to set it up. Together with another mushroom lover, Michael Forbes, they founded a company called Hidden Creek in 1979 to sell P. tampanensis sclerotium by mail; they advertised in the monthly magazine High Times, and became the largest magic mushroom vendor in the world within the same year. He sold mushrooms, prescriptions, and planted an acre of cannabis to get the funds he needed to his research. He traveled to the Amazon and Mexico to study psychoactive mushrooms and discovered 3 species in 1979: Psilocybe armandii, Psilocybe wassoniorum, and Psilocybe schultesii. In 1980, because of his high volume of illegal prescription writing, the state pharmacy board alerted employees about his practice. As a work-around Pollock bought his own pharmacy to supply his customers. ==Death== Pollock worked 7 days a week; on a Saturday at 7 PM he arranged with his girlfriend Mitzi by phone to meet for dinner, but he had a last patient scheduled to come that night. Mitzi called him several times through the night, but he did not answer. Worried, she ran to his office at 11 PM and found the house ransacked. Pollock was in the corner beside the front door, shot dead in the forehead. The police found 1,753 jars of growing psychoactive mushrooms in his greenhouse that were dumped and burned by San Antonio Narcotics Force. Gary Davis, Pollock's friend, got a tape of two people talking about Pollock's murder, but kept it in the fear someone would kill him. In 1983, detective Anton Michalec found three suspects, Ernest Dietzmann and Jerry Baker that were drug dependents and patients of Pollock's, and Arthur Lenz, a methamphetamine dealer. They intended to rob Pollock of his money, and their fingerprints matched those found at the crime scene. Michalec brought the case to the district attorney Terry McDonald, who refused to prosecute for unknown reasons, and Michalec's work was forgotten. All three suspects died free men. In 2013, when journalist Hamilton Morris contacted McDonald, who explained he actually wasn't the district attorney at that time, Morris tried to investigate and was informed by the DEA that they had destroyed and / or lost the records and information about who was responsible for the case. ==See also== * List of mycologists * Paul Stamets * Gast√≥n Guzm√°n ==ReferencesExternal links== * Blood Spore: Of Murder and mushrooms - Pollock's biography by Hamilton Morris * Blood Spore: The Pollock Murder Cassette - Transcription and Audio * Mad Scientist #18: Steven H.

Pack assumed office in June 2020 after Senate confirmation. == Early life and education == Pack was born in New York City. He attended Yale University before earning a Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of California, Berkeley, and Juris Doctor from the UC Berkeley School of Law. == Career == Michael Pack founded Manifold Productions, Inc., an independent film production company, in 1977. Through Manifold Productions, Pack has written, directed and produced 13 documentary films on a range of topics. In 1993, Pack served as Co-Chair of the International TV Council at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In 2002, President Bush nominated and the Senate confirmed Pack to serve on the National Council on the Humanities, which oversees the National Endowment for the Humanities. He served from July 2002 to February 2005. From 2003 to 2006, Pack served as Senior Vice President for Television Programming at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. From 2015 to 2017, Pack served as President and CEO of the Claremont Institute in Upland, California, and Publisher of its Claremont Review of Books. Pack has collaborated with Stephen Bannon, former advisor for President Trump, and co- founder of the conservative website Breitbart News. In 2019, Pack produced and directed a documentary about the conservative Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas. USAGM CEO Pack at his confirmation hearing in September 2019 In June 2018, the White House announced that President Donald Trump intended to nominate Pack as the chief executive officer of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which among other things oversees the Voice of America (VOA). Pack's first confirmation hearing took place on September 19, 2019. On May 8, 2020, Senator Jim Risch moved to schedule a committee confirmation hearing for Pack for the following week. Pack's nomination was contentious, with critics arguing that the mission of VOA would be compromised by installing a conservative partisan as head of the organization. The Senate invoked cloture on Pack's nomination on June 4, 2020, by a vote of 53‚Äì39, and it confirmed him the same day by a vote of 53‚Äì38. Pack assumed office over a week after his confirmation partially so his office could be swept for covert listening devices. One of his first actions as USAGM CEO was to fire the heads of the outlets under his purview ‚Äî among them Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Middle East Broadcasting Networks, and the Open Technology Fund ‚Äî including certain officials favored by conservatives. Pack also installed Trump loyalists in leadership positions within the organization and disbanded a bipartisan board that oversees the USAGM. Pack continued making personnel changes, among other actions. It was reported in July 2020 that the USAGM under Pack would not extend visas for foreign VOA journalists. In late July 2020, Pack announced an investigation of a VOA video that purportedly promoted Joe Biden's presidential campaign. In August 2020, USAGM required several of its outlets to return money allocated for internet freedom projects for the agency to reallocate for other internet freedom uses. ==Investigation== Pack is the founder and director of the Public Media Lab, a non-profit charitable organization. On May 12, 2020, Democrat Senator Robert Menendez raised with District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine the question of whether Pack has unlawfully directed funds from the Public Media Lab to his profit-making company Manifold Productions. According to Menendez, all of the millions of dollars raised by the Public Media Lab have been transferred to Pack's company. In response, Racine indicated that he has initiated an investigation. == Filmography == Pack has written, directed, and produced numerous documentaries, principally for PBS, as well as corporate and educational films. His major credits include: * Hollywood's Favorite Heavy: Businessmen on Prime Time TV, hosted by Eli Wallach (1987) * Campus Culture Wars: Five Stories about Political Correctness, narrated by Lindsay Crouse (1993) * Hollywood vs. Religion, hosted by Michael Medved (1995) * Inside the Republican Revolution: The First Hundred Days, hosted by Don Lambro (1995) * The Rodney King Incident: Race and Justice in America, narrated by Robert Prosky (1998) * The Fall of Newt Gingrich, narrated by Blair Brown (2000) * Rediscovering George Washington, hosted by Richard Brookhiser (2002) * God and the Inner City, narrated by Phylicia Rashad (2003) * Rediscovering Alexander Hamilton, hosted by Richard Brookhiser (2011) * RICKOVER: The Birth of Nuclear Power, narrated by Joan Allen (2014) * Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in his Own Words (2020) ;Future releases * The Last 600 Meters, to be released ==ReferencesExternal links== * USAGM biography * Category:American documentary film producers Category:Trump administration personnel Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Michael Pack"},{"id":"54211438","text":"Prime Now is a service offered by Amazon and available to Prime members in parts of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, and Spain. In December 2014, Prime Now first launched in parts of New York City, by Stephenie Landry, an Amazon vice president who also heads up AmazonFresh and the now defunct Amazon Restaurants. The Prime Now service allows members to have products delivered to them within one hour for a fee of $7.99, or within two hours for no additional fee. As of 2014, 25,000 daily essential products were available through the service. In a May 2016, survey conducted by Cowen & Co., approximately one in four Amazon Prime users had used Prime Now. == Areas served == In February 2015, the service was extended to include all of Manhattan. By mid-2016, it had been expanded in the United States to include parts of Chicago, Miami, Baltimore, Seattle, Dallas, Atlanta, Austin, Nashville, Portland, San Antonio, and Tampa. It has also expanded to certain cities in the United Kingdom, including London, Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester, and Liverpool. Other cities around the world with Prime Now include Rome, Milan, Munich, Berlin, Paris, Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Tokyo, Osaka, Kawasaki, Yokohama, and Singapore. == Amazon Restaurants == Amazon Restaurants was an online food ordering service available in 20 metro areas throughout the United States. In January 2018, the service had 7,601 restaurants, which offered delivery through the Prime Now service. In addition to independent restaurants, the service offered delivery from chains such as Red Robin, Applebee's, Olive Garden, and P.F. Chang's. Amazon Restaurants was available on the Prime Now mobile app and on Amazon's website. One-hour delivery was free once users meet a certain spending amount, determined by the restaurant. In November 2018, Amazon announced plans to withdraw from the United Kingdom market, citing an over-saturation of the market by competitors. In June 2019, Amazon shut down the service in remaining markets. It has not withdrawn from the restaurant delivery business entirely: in May 2019 Amazon announced its investment in the UK-based restaurant delivery service, Deliveroo. == Groceries ==  United States  As part of the Prime Now app, users can order groceries from local retailers to be delivered by independent contractors, similar to Instacart. Retailers in the program include local stores and the Sprouts Farmers Market chain. To eliminate packaging waste, items are placed in paper bags for delivery and taken out of insulated bags at the time of delivery to be reused. In February 2018, Prime Now began adding the ability to place orders from Whole Foods Market stores in the service area. As of April 2018, the service was live in 10 markets. In addition to delivery, grocery pickup is also available in some markets.  India  Amazon launched its 2-hour grocery delivery service, Amazon Now, in India in February, 2016 in Bangalore. The service spread to Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad the same year. Available only as an app on Android and iOS devices, the service was re-branded as Prime Now in May, 2018. Apart from tying up with local hypermarkets and supermarkets like Big Bazaar and More, Amazon has also set up its own fulfillment centers in these cities to meet consumer demand. == Amazon Flex == To meet the on-demand needs of Prime Now, Amazon further launched Amazon Flex, a platform for independent contractors to provide delivery services. Drivers for the program use a proprietary app to complete deliveries. The contractors do not wear Amazon branded apparel, and deliver using their personal vehicles. == Controversies == In October 2015, former Flex contractors sued Amazon as they were making under the minimum wage while working out of Amazon facilities and wearing a badge identifying that they were with Amazon. In October 2016, another group of Amazon Flex contractors sued the company, stating that they should be classified as employees due to factors such as mandatory training sessions and having to follow a route decided by Amazon. == References  External links == * Prime Now (FR) * Prime Now (DE) * Prime Now (IT) * Prime Now (JP) * Prime Now (ES) * Prime Now (SG) * Prime Now (UK) * Prime Now (US) Category:Amazon (company) Category:Online food retailers of the United States Category:Online grocery delivery ","title":"Prime Now"},{"id":"54211451","text":"Dant may refer to: ==Places== *Dant, Kentucky, is an unincorporated community in Marion County, Kentucky, United States *Dant, Oregon, is an unincorporated community in Wasco County, in the U.S. state of Oregon ==People with the surname== *Adam Dant, British artist *Charles \\"Bud\\" Dant (1907‚Äì1999), American musician, arranger and composer *Jenni Dant (born 1982), American basketball player ==See also== *Cerdd Dant (string music), is the art of vocal improvisation over a given melody in Welsh musical tradition *Dant katha, (\\"tooth stories\\"), are Indian folk legends or fables ","title":"Dant"},{"id":"54211498","text":"R√©ginald Willems (born 6 September 1977) is a former professional tennis player from Belgium. ==Biography== Playing career Willems, who comes from Brussels, began competing professionally in 1996.

Willems took charge of a team which had been relegated to the Europe/Africa Zone for the 2009 Davis Cup and was able to return the side to the World Group in his first year, with a 3‚Äì2 win over Ukraine in the 2009 Play-offs. They were unable to get past the Czech Republic in the first round of the 2010 Davis Cup, but remained in the World Group with an unlikely play-off win over Australia in Cairns. He resigned as captain amid discontent in the team following Belgium's first- round World Group loss to Spain in 2011. His selection of the inexperienced Ruben Bemelmans against Rafael Nadal in the second rubber of the tie was met with criticism. Olivier Rochus, who had been expected to play the match, spoke out publicly against the decision by Willems and called the missed opportunity to play Nadal as one of the biggest disappointments of his career. At the same time doubles specialist Dick Norman, who was omitted from the side, called for Belgium to have an impartial coach, noting that Willems is also the personal coach of Rochus and Steve Darcis, who both played in the tie. From 2011 to 2014 he was the coach of David Goffin, during which time the Belgian rose from outside the top 200 to 42 in the world. ==Challenger titles== Singles: (1) {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font-size:97% !style=\\"width:20px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"No. !style=\\"width:40px\\"Year !style=\\"width:220px\\"Tournament !style=\\"width:50px\\"Surface !style=\\"width:200px\\"Opponent !style=\\"width:160px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Score - 1. 2000 C√≥rdoba, Spain Hard  Denis Golovanov 4‚Äì6, 7‚Äì5, 7‚Äì6(4) } ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Belgian male tennis players Category:Belgian tennis coaches Category:Sportspeople from Brussels ","title":"R√©ginald Willems"},{"id":"54211500","text":"Daniel Boloca (born 22 December 1998) is an Italian professional footballer who currently plays for Francavilla as a midfielder. ==Club career== 1.

He is fascinated with the great enigma of her apparently wonderful inner world, eager to unravel its mysteries, and she, a self- proclaimed 'sufferer in Dostoyevsky's taste' implores him to reveal her soul to the world in one of his novellas. So she tells him how she, a young girl, looking for brighter horizons, married an old army general, so as to become an heiress one day and, with all the wealth thus gained, go back to the man whom she really adored. Now, according to the plan, the general dies, but no happiness comes her way, for there is now a serious hurdle that stands between her and the man she loves. And that is‚Ä¶ another army general, who is both rich and old. As the train leaves the station, Voldemar the writer sits pondering on how indeed enigmatic this wonderful creature's soul must be. == References  External links == * –ó–∞–≥–∞–¥–æ—á–Ω–∞—è –Ω–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞, the original Russian text * An Enigmatic Nature, English translation Category:Short stories by Anton Chekhov Category:1883 short stories Category:Works originally published in Russian magazines ","title":"An Enigmatic Nature"},{"id":"54211549","text":"Raymond Jean Pech (4 February 1876 in Valenciennes ‚Äì 3 July 1952 in Paris ) was a French composer. == Biography == Pech studied at the conservatoire of Lille then the Conservatoire de Paris where he was a pupil of Raoul Pugno, Xavier Leroux and Charles Lenepveu.

It served the town of Maerdy between 1889 and 1964. ==History and description== Maerdy was the highest railway station on the Taff Vale system, located at 900 feet at the head of the valley. Maerdy was the upper terminus of the Maerdy Branch (or Rhondda Fach branch). The station had a single platform with large brick buildings and a signal box. The sidings for Mardy Colliery also ran through the station and terminated just beyond. Maerdy also had a large carriage shed built of corrugated iron. This initially housed autotrains, and was latterly used for diesel locomotives. ==Closure and after== Goods traffic ended in 1956. In the later years of the line's life, there were hourly passenger workings between Maerdy and Porth, the six-mile journey taking around 20 minutes. As part of the Beeching Axe, these services were withdrawn in 1964 and the station closed. In the years after closure, traffic from the colliery continued, and a number of enthusiast specials ran over the line to Maerdy. The colliery closed in 1990 after 115 years. The platform was still intact in 1988, but after the colliery closed, the station site was completely cleared and landscaped. ==References== Category:Disused railway stations in Rhondda Cynon Taf Category:Former Taff Vale Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1889 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1964 Category:Beeching closures in Wales ","title":"Maerdy railway station"},{"id":"54211573","text":"StarCrawlers is a dungeon crawler and role-playing game that was released for Windows, macOS, and SteamOS on 24 May 2017. It was the first game produced by Juggernaut Games, which funded it using a Kickstarter. It is set in a sci-fi universe with cyberpunk elements, and features a mixture of pre-built and procedurally generated content. The game aims to revitalise dungeon-crawlers as a genre, billing itself as a \\"modern take on a classic cRPG dungeon crawler\\", and is available on Steam or GOG. ==Plot== The player begins the game by docking with STIX (Station Terminus IX), a space station that later forms the game's hub; the player then begins a practice \\"crawl\\" to prove their mettle. From there, they take on a variety of missions set by mega- corporations, such as stealing goods, spying on rivals, and assassinating people. ==Gameplay== StarCrawlers is a dungeon crawler that features a first- person perspective and a turn-based combat system. The game revolves around STIX, where \\"missions\\" are assigned and players can rest and buy equipment. These missions make up the dungeon-crawling portion of the game and are divided into procedurally-generated missions and pre-made missions that advance the story; the procedurally-generated missions make up a large majority. While combat is turn-based, non-combat gameplay, such as puzzles, takes place in real-time. The combat is based on a \\"time-unit\\" system, where different actions take up different amounts of time units; it also can involve up to four player characters (though you start the game with only one), each which has a different set of skills; these are dictated by their character class, but a player can choose different skills within a given class. A faction system based around maintaining different corporations also exists. ==Development== Juggernaut Games was founded in 2011. They announced StarCrawlers on December 9, 2013 and began a Kickstarter campaign on February 12, 2014. The campaign reached its goal of $65,000 on March 1, and finished on March 14 with $100,278 raised. They also utilised Steam Greenlight to get the game on Steam; they were greenlit on February 19. After the Kickstarter campaign, they focused on adding new content, before launching a backer beta on January 28, 2015. This was followed by the game being released on Steam Early Access on March 17. Development was interrupted by the decision to upgrade to Unity 5, mainly due to Unity 4's memory limitations. This process begun in September 2016 and was finished by December 2016, which allowed for a planned release on May 16, 2017. Because of a need for further polishing, it was delayed until later that month. After the May 23 release, Juggernaut Games committed to further development. The game's music was composed by Ben Prunty, who also composed the music for FTL: Faster Than Light. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2017 video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Single-player video games Category:MacOS games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Early access video games Category:Unity (game engine) games ","title":"StarCrawlers"},{"id":"54211587","text":"Federico Bikoro Akieme (born 17 March 1996), also known as Sisinio, is a professional footballer who plays for Spanish club CD Numancia on loan from Real Zaragoza and the Equatorial Guinea national team.

The village has 257 inhabitants (2015), and lies on the federal road 246 on the border of the Zauche plateau to the Glogau-Baruther Urstromtal. To the north is the Truppen√ºbungsplatz Lehnin military training area. North-east is the municipality Borkheide. To the southeast are the villages Alt Bork and Deusche Bork. The main town of Br√ºck is roughly 3km west along the B246 road. ==History== Church with half-timbered tower Road to the Baruther Urstromtal View of the rest of the Linther Oberbuschs Land development The first documented mention of Neuendorf dates from 1337 as Nyendorf, and by 1375 the village is listed as \\"Nyendorf prope Brugge\\". The village was owned by the Ritter family of Ziegesar until 1582. From 1599 to 1690 it belonged to the family of Bernewitz. Until 1815, Neuendorf was of great importance for Brandenburg, since the village was the last border post in the M√§rkische Zauche in the direction of Saxony. It was only with the Congress of Vienna in 1815 that the northern part of the Saxon spa district, to which Br√ºck and Belzig had belonged, finally fell to Prussia. Neuendorf has always been agricultural. With the extensive melioration measures under Frederick the Great in the Baruther Urstromtal, the Neuendorfer farmers started to gain wealth; they had previously had to lay their fields on the sandy, dry, and rather barren land of the Zauche, and from the middle of the eighteenth century onwards they had been able to shift their cultivated lands into the overgrown and fertile valley. Remains of the formerly extensive Erlenbruch forest between Neuendorf, Stromtal, and Bundesautobahn 9, along with a variety of drainage channels, remind today of the swampy lowland. The relatively high prosperity of the farmers during this time was reflected in the fact that in 1795, when the highly indebted estate was to be auctioned in Neuendorf, the villagers provided the highest bid with 26,000 Thaler. The village church has a bell dating from 1690. The tower was erected in 1839 and a renovation took place in 1890.

He spent most of his active service career in the Middle East during the Second World War and the troubles that followed in the British Mandatory Palestine. Doran's family were a long established military family with roots in County Wexford, Ireland. His father Walter Robert Butler Doran was a highly decorated British Army Officer, as were his uncles and grandfather. He is recorded as being an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service before transferring to the army. He was commissioned in the Intelligence Corps as a Lieutenant on 12 February 1943; his service number was 274197. He is recorded as having been on the staff of Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME) based in Cairo. His preferred titling was Desmond Doran whilst on government service. At the end of the war Doran was transferred from Cairo to British Mandatory Palestine and became the Area Security Officer for Jaffa/Tel Aviv. His living quarters and office were located above another government office located at the municipal boundary between Jewish Tel Aviv and the Arab port of Jaffa.

The head of the project ‚Äì professor Nargiz Pashayeva used to call the theatre ‚Äúa creative stage‚Äù.Theatres, Cinemas, Concert Halls of Baku: \\"√úns\\" Theatre ‚Äî National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017. √úNS this is not an acronym, as it may seem, but the root of the word ‚Äú√úNSiyy…ôt‚Äù. The word has several meanings: friendship, communication, mutual understanding, inner world of the individual. The name accurately reflects the essence of the theatre project. The conceptual and artistic priorities of the theatre are aimed at rising the level of Azerbaijani theatre art, based on the traditions of the past to combine tradition and newness. The Foundation of Friends of Azerbaijani Culture has been the key investor of the project. The building used to be based on two ramshackle walls of a former transformer station built in the 1920s. Today the theatre building consists of two distinct and organically linked units: the reconstructed and refurbished building of the transformer station (room and stage) and the administrative building made of glass, metal and plastics. The reconstruction was led by the Baku architect Oqtay Sattarov while the decorations of the interior of √úNS were done by the artist Altay Sadygzade. The sound, light, video and stage have been elaborated and installed by one of the Russian companies. ==Activity== At different times the stage of √úNS was visited by such cultural personalities as Sergei Yusky and Alexander Filippenko, Alexander Shirvindt and Mikhail Derzhavin, Kostantin Raikin and Gennedy Khazanov, Edvard Radzinsky and Aleksey Batalov. The spectators could see the works of such directors as Dmitry Bertman, Petr Fomenko, Roman Viktuk, Robert Sturua and other. √úNS has also staged its own drama performances based on the plays written specifically for the theatre- ‚ÄúFinal Restaurant‚Äù by Magsud Ibrahimbeyov, ‚ÄúShakespeare‚Äù by Elchin Efendiyev, musicals ‚ÄúBaku‚Äù and ‚ÄúNotre-Drame de Paris‚Äù. The theatre has also hosted recitals, concerts and exhibitions. Many people still recall the unforgettable performances by Russian director Roman Viktuk- the plays ‚ÄúEdith Piaf, My Legionnaire‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrees die while standing‚Äù based on the play by Alejandro Casona. The Theatre has also hosted concerts by French musicians of Arab origin who performed oriental music in a new style, the performances of a Corsican ethnic choir, concerts of the jazz pianist Shahin Novrasli and many others. The theatre also remembers art evenings within the framework of the experimental and interdisciplinary project ‚ÄúIndi‚Äù which aims at bringing together representatives of various types of modern art. ==ReferencesExternal links== * S…ôda - √úNS teatrƒ±nƒ±n yaranmasƒ±ndan 10 il ke√ßir (22.04.2016) * S…ôda - √úNS √ºn t…ô≈ü…ôbb√ºs√º il…ô tama≈üa t…ôqdim olunub (01.06.2016) * S…ôda - Roman Viktyukla g√∂r√º≈ü (03.06.2016) Category:Theatres in Baku Category:Tourist attractions in Baku ","title":"&quot;√úns&quot; Theatre"},{"id":"54211852","text":"Octopus minor, otherwise known as the long arm octopus or the Korean common octopus, is a small bodied octopus species distributed along the benthic coastal waters surrounding Eastern China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It lives at depths ranging from 0‚Äì200m. O. minor is commonly found in the mudflats of sub-tidal zones leaving it exposed to significant environmental variations. It is grouped within the class Cephalopoda along with squids and cuttlefish. O. minor carries cultural and economic value in the Asian countries in which it is found. It is important commercially to the fishing communities in Korea, it contributes to the $35 million octopus industry. It is recognised as a Korean culinary seafood option, commonly referred to as nakji (ÎÇôÏßÄ). The octopus is served both cooked and raw, and is often a snack during sporting events. There have been multiple findings concerning the physiological makeup of the O. minor. It has been shown to host a dangerous parasite, whilst also demonstrating the ability to adapt its morphology to wide-ranging environmental conditions. These characteristics have increased interest in the species and its genome has been mapped. == Anatomy == The O. minor, similar to the rest of its order Octopoda, is bilaterally symmetrical along a dorsoventral axis with two eyes and a mouth that centres its eight arms. The arms have evolved from feet as they are flexible and surround its mouth in a webbed formation. These arms contain two-thirds of the octopi's neurons. On the underside of these arms, O. minor has \\"suckers\\" which are the circular, adhesive suction cups. These are predominantly used for manipulating, navigating and preparing food. O. minor has a dominant mantle and visceral hump which contains the majority of its fundamental organs. This corresponds with the translation of Cephalopoda which means \\"head foot\\", as its foot/feet are directly attached to its head. O. minor is a small soft- bodied octopus with long arms hence its nickname long-arm octopus. O. minor features eight arms and a bulbous head. It can be identified by its grey colouring which matches the sandy plains in which it is commonly found, however when it finds itself threatened or in danger, it will shift its skin tone to a dark red.  Size  The O. minor reaches a mantle size of 18 cm (7.1 inches) with arms of/up to 65 cm (25.6 inches). It is the smaller side of its class compared to colossal squids which can reach over 10 metres (33 feet). == Distribution and Behaviour ==  Feeding  O. minor, alike other octopus populations, possess predatory traits. O. minor's diet coincides with that of other bottom-dwelling octopuses, with over 50% accounted for by fish, 25% by cephalopods such as whelks and clams, the remainder being made up of crustaceans such as crabs, annelids and nematodes, other commonly found species sharing the O. minor habitat. The small nature of the octopus means rejection of larger species including rock scallops and large fish. Octopus \\"suckers\\" The benthic nature of the O. minor allows it to move between rocks and through crevices. Once it has identified its prey, it makes a sudden pounce, using its suckers to grip onto it and pull it in. The O. minor preys on smaller targets by trapping them in the web-like structure of its legs. The O. minor injects its prey with a paralysing saliva, using miniature teeth at the end of their salivary papilla to dismember them. When targeting shelled molluscs, the O. minor creates a toxic saliva which enables the calcium carbonate of the shell to be broken down. Once the outer protection is penetrated, the preys muscles relax allowing the octopus to remove its soft issues, in-turn, killing it. Feeding intensities differ between the males and females of the O. minor. Different intensities revolve around the ovarian maturation calendar of the female octopus. From months April to July the intensity of feeding in females decreased, alternatively an increase in males. Whilst 10 different taxa have been identified within the stomach of the O. minor, the Gobiidae family was most prevalent during the female's ovarian maturation. O. minor with scale  Locomotion  Different to other multi- limbed hydrostats such as crabs, the O. minor performs movements using all eight independent limbs. The arrangement of muscles within its arms allows for movement in any direction. Movements of the O. minor involve crawling between rocks and crevices. This combines with swimming with its dorsal fin in a leading position. Jet propulsion is another method of locomotion performed by the O. minor. The process of crawling involves the use the octopus's suckers. Some are used to grip to surrounding environments allowing the octopus to pull itself forward using muscles within its legs. Others push from behind. This process is repeated until a change of locomotion is performed. The O. minor performs a swimming motion using the expulsion of water from the mantle through its siphon into the ocean behind it. Force provided by the water allows the octopus to move in the opposite direction. The direction of movement is dependent on the way in which the siphon is faced. The long arms found on the O. minor provide it with a streamline swimming shape. Its bilateral symmetry allows it to move headfirst, with its legs trailing. Jet swimming is used predominantly for escape from danger. The O. minor performs a movement known as ‚Äúpumping‚Äù. This involves the legs of the O. minor contracting in unison, allowing for the production of a wave. This provides a force which moves the body. The O. minor uses its appendages to crawl outside of the water. For the O. minor this is performed between tide pools and when served as a culinary option. O. minor camouflaging with habitat  Habitat  The habitats of the O. minor vary greatly between rocky floors, reefs and the ocean floor. It is a benthic octopus, meaning it lies at the lowest body of water, around the sediment surface and rock or coral cover. The O. minor is located within the mudflats of sub-tidal zones surrounding the south western coast of the Korean peninsula. O. minor residing within the mudflats of coastal regions are exposed to rough salinity, temperature and water movement conditions. The O. minor finds itself in rocky areas such as Jeju Island. Jeju Island is an Island within the province of South Korea, over 700 square miles in size. The O. minor is commonly found in the Yellow Sea. This is a segment of the Western Pacific Ocean situated between the Korean Peninsula and mainland China, connected to the Gulf of Bohai. The sea extends over 950 kilometres from North to South and 700 kilometres wide. The sea has a cyclone current and semidiurnal tides with temperatures that range from -10 degrees Celsius to 28 degrees Celsius.  Colour change  The O. minor, when hunting and avoiding predators, use specialised pigment-filled bags known as chromatophores. These are found in the skin, allowing the octopus to adjust its colour or reflectivity. Colour variation of chromatophores include red, brown, black, grey, yellow or blue. Other colour methods include the use of an iridescent dermal tissue. This manipulated by the O. minor to communicate with other octopus and proceed with courtship rituals. The O. minor possesses muscles on its mantle which change texture to assist in changing colour. The shallow water habitats which the O. minor inhabits has allowed it to evolve more diverse skin than fellow cephalopods. == Relationship to humans == Nakji- bokkeum (cooked) San-nakji (raw) O. minor is well represented within the Korean commercial fishery field, presenting a high annual yield of over 350,000 tonnes. This has led to its inclusion within multiple signature seafood dishes, mostly found within Korea. The rapid adaption of the organism to the stressful conditions of its habitat encouraged scientific research and the mapping of its genome.  Culinary use  Within most parts of Korea, O. minor or Nakji, is a culinary option, being served most commonly as a snack either raw, cooked or poached.  Nakji-bokkeum (cooked)  For this dish, O. minor is chopped, then stir-fried with vegetables such as carrots, onions and cabbage. It is marinated with a local Korean red pepper sauce, then served hot with warm rice, somyeon, or bean sprouts.  San-nakji (raw)  For this dish, O. minor is either chopped or whole and served raw on a plate. It is often served with sesame oil and sesame seeds. The significant number of nerve endings in the arms of the O. Minor combined with its sophisticated nervous system, allows for a variety of movements when disconnected from the brain, meaning the octopus performs movements whilst being served. As the suction cups are still active on the cephalopod's arms, they may grip to one's throat, therefore consumers are at risk of choking. Nakji-Yeonpo-tang (soup)  Nakji-yeonpo-tang (soup)  For this dish, O. minor is boiled in stock, before being chopped into fine pieces then served in the soup with spring onion, chilli and minced garlic. The dish is traditionally offered during funeral processions.  Dangers  A large percentage (22%) of O. minor have been found to host a dangerous parasitic benthic crustacean. Their increased susceptibility is due to its lack of external shell compared to fellow mollusc, the snail. The presence Octopicola huanghaienis parasite is identified by a spike at the end of its labrum lap. The parasite is a health concern when O. minor is served raw. == Genetic Research == O. minor's adaption of its behavioural repertoire to assorted habitat conditions made it a promising model to be studied and to have its genome mapped. Distributions of the O. minor between the Korean Peninsula and Eastern China identified genetic differences in individuals from different habitats. The borders of these countries are connected by the Yellow Sea. Genetic structures of O. minor were analysed using a sequence of the CO1 gene as it shows higher base- substitution mutation rates.  Genome mapping  The morphology of the O. minor was analysed for genome mapping. O. minor was studied for its ability to tolerate environmental changes. Its molecular basis was studied for plasticity development and mechanisms underlying adaption. The concluding genome assembly of the octopus was 5.09 Gb, with over 30 010 genes; 44% were made up of repeated elements. The total number of gene families within O. Minor are 178. A highly identical nucleotide sequence across multiple species suggests the O. minor is actually the same species as Callinectes ornatus and Micrococcus luteus, despite them occupying different habitats. == References == Category:Molluscs described in 1920 Category:Cephalopods of Asia Category:Molluscs of the Pacific Ocean Category:Octopodidae Category:Korean seafood ","title":"Octopus minor"},{"id":"54211855","text":", also known as Hajimete no Gal, is a Japanese manga series by Meguru Ueno. It has been serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's sh≈çnen manga magazine Monthly Sh≈çnen Ace since November 2015, and has been collected in eleven tank≈çbon volumes. A ten-episode anime television series adaptation by NAZ aired from July 12 to September 13, 2017. ==Plot== High school boy Junichi Hashiba laments not having a girlfriend as his classmates have seemed to be pairing up everywhere. His single unattached friends force him into boldly confessing his love to Yukana Yame, a beautiful \\"gal\\" at the school. Although Yukana easily determines that Junichi really just wants to lose his virginity, she agrees to be his girlfriend. Junichi soon attracts the affections of other girls who have known Junichi or Yukana for a while, including his childhood friend and neighbor Nene, Yukana's gal friend Ranko, and the school's madonna Yui. ==Characters== ; : : Junichi is a second-year high school boy who wishes to have a girlfriend. At the start of the series, he is set up by his friends to confess his love to Yukana Yame. While he is internally thrilled to see Yukana's sexy body, he is easily embarrassed when Yukana confronts him for such perverted actions. He regularly has sexual fantasies of losing his virginity and is depicted as having internal debates in his head over what to do in situations. His friends also pressure him to hook them up with girls. As he learns that Yukana does indeed like him, he tries to remain loyal to her, turning down the other girls that make advances on him. ; : : Yukana is a fashionable high school \\"gal\\" with strawberry blonde hair, green eyes, a busty chest, loose socks, and a carefree attitude. She is very guarded about perverted stuff, calling it gross, but agrees to be Junichi's girlfriend. She finds Jun to be transparent with his emotions and reactions, and often calls Jun out for being a perverted virgin who is interested in her body, but teases and flirts with him too. Underneath she is very caring, and seeks her friends' advice often on how to relate to Jun better, being a little naive sometimes on applying the advice. On occasion, she lowers her guard and lets him touch her if it helps affirm how serious she is about the relationship. She gets jealous when the other girls interact with Junichi, but thinks that Nene's little sister act is too cute to be taken as a serious threat to her relationship. ; : : Yukana's childhood friend is a tall tan-skinned gal with short light blonde hair, light purple eyes, and a big chest. She is very aggressive, making moves on Junichi which makes Yukana jealous. She reveals to Jun that she loves Yukana and is possessive of her; she does not like Yukana being so close to Jun, even if it means having to have sex with Jun herself. ; : : A petite but big-breasted first-year high school girl who styles her hair in buns. She and Jun are childhood friends, but she is obsessed with Jun, and initially tried to dress and act like a little sister because he had expressed interest in that genre of video games. She briefly tries the gal lifestyle to try to win Jun over, and later tries to attack him by lying on top of him naked in bed, but Jun rejects her. She then decides to openly compete with Yukana, going back to her bun hairstyle. In the anime, Jun's friends regard her as a \\"loli with big boobs\\". ; : : Jun's classmate and class representative, who has long dark hair and reddish eyes. Jun's friends regard her as the school's madonna, smart and beautiful, like a character from a manga or a video game. She has known Jun since middle school and initially acts very friendly and nice around him. She secretly dresses up as a blonde- haired (red hair in the anime) twin-tailed idol named BoA who does live streams on the Internet. She is upset that Jun, whom she deems her number-one servant because he had helped carry boxes for her or picked up her eraser, does not fawn over her like an obedient pet because he is with Yukana. She tries to remedy that by pulling him aside and asking him to dump Yukana and go out with her. When Jun refuses, she gets very angry and threatens him until Ranko saves him by threatening to reveal her net identity. She becomes more attracted to Jun beyond just wanting him to be her pet, and eventually confesses to Jun and is declined. She then strives to be his second girlfriend as in a harem. In the anime, Jun's friends say her only drawback is that she doesn't have a big chest like some of the other girls. ; : : A glasses-wearing classmate with short bluish hair who is part of Junichi's group of perverted friends. He, Jun, and Yui Kashii were classmates before in middle school. He is the one who usually initiates the plans and recommendations for Jun, including planning the confession, giving movie tickets to Jun, and others. He is also the first to make the connection between Yui Kashii and online idol named BoA. In the manga serialization's magazine, he provides information on the characters for the anime adaptation. They are slated to have a larger role in the anime than in the manga. Shinpei has an older cousin named Sayaka, who attends university and is involved in a manga club. ; : : A blonde-haired classmate who is part of Junichi's group of perverted friends. ; : : An obese classmate who is part of Junichi's group of perverted friends. Of the three friends, he mentions that he likes little girls. ; : : Yukana's gal friend with medium brown hair and blue eyes. She is more of a background character in the manga, but has a larger role in the anime. ; : : Yukana's gal friend with blonde hair stylized in tails tied with red ribbons. She is more of a background character in the manga, but has a larger role in the anime. ; Yuki Kashi : Yui's younger brother who dresses up as an attractive girl at school, flirting with and teasing Jun. Yuki is very fond of Yui, but when he notices she has been off because of her love for Jun, he tries to support her and disrupt Jun's relationship with Yukana. This is so that Yui can return to being the strong older sister. ; Iris Kotobayashi : The student council president who dislikes that Jun has attracted a harem of pretty girls at school. She has long blonde hair, and is part French and part Japanese. She has a reputation of imprisoning students like in the Prison School manga. ==Media== Manga As of July 2020, the series has been released in eleven tank≈çbon volumes. Anime A 10-episode anime television series adaptation by NAZ aired from July 12, 2017 to September 13, 2017.

James Beckett found that the fanservice to be as expected and that it embodied \\"all of the most irritating sex comedy stereotypes that stopped being funny back when the American Pie sequels fizzled out over a decade ago.\\" Nick Creamer found the censorship bars to be the only unique thing about the show, and that the central characters were not likable. Theron Martin held out some hope that Yukana would at least have some character depth. Paul Jensen found the premise of two characters from different social circles to have potential, but the first episode to be obnoxious and dumb, outside of some moments where Yukana reacts to Junichi's confession. Rebecca Silverman regarded the episode as mostly fetishism and unless that was toned down and \\"starts to develop Yukana as a real person, it could be a somewhat smarty raunchy comedy,\\" but did not plan to watch any more to find out. ==NotesWorks cited== * \\"Ch.\\" is shortened form for chapter and refers to a chapter number of the Hajimete no Gal manga * \\"Ep.\\" is shortened form for episode and refers to an episode number of the My First Girlfriend Is a Gal anime ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Female harem anime and manga Category:Funimation Category:Kadokawa Shoten manga Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:NAZ (studio) Category:Romantic comedy anime and manga Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Works about virginity ","title":"My First Girlfriend Is a Gal"},{"id":"54211865","text":"Darin Eugene Johnson (born January 21, 1995) is an American basketball player who plays for Maree Basketball Club, a professional basketball team in Ireland. == High school and college career == Johnson played at Franklin High School in Elk Grove, California and Sheldon High School in Sacramento, California where he was a four star prospect before enrolling at the University of Washington in 2013.

It is the successor to the Deaths In Custody Watch Committee (WA) (DICWC WA), which was a social justice organisation operating from Perth, Western Australia from 1996 until it underwent a constitutional change early 2017. It is a Public Benevolent Institution whose main concern is Aboriginal Australian deaths in custody. ==History== The DICWC WA was first founded as one of several federal government-funded anti-deaths-in-custody \\"watch\\" groups across Australia, being the implementation of one of the recommendations of the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC). The Uniting Church of Australia in Western Australia was a founding \\"partner\\" in the formation of the DICWC WA. From 1996 to 2004 the DICWC WA was funded via the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). After ATSIC was dismantled in 2004, the 2006 Board of the DICWC WA voted to continue the DICWC WA as a non-funded organisation. The 1996-2006 period case files of the DICWC WA were, from 2006 until 2011, stored in the garage of a long-term supporter, and transferred to the Battye Library in 2014. The transfer of the files lead to the creation of the DICWC WA archive at Battye Library, which Bruce Campbell, as Secretary and then Chairperson, would on occasion add to with non-case material such as Board minutes and rally fliers. From 2006 on, the DICWC WA functioned primarily as a lobby group aiming to pressure the State and Federal Governments into taking practical action against deaths in custody. The main DICWC WA tactic was organising public rallies on significant days, such as the 25th anniversary of the release of the 1991 report of Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths In Custody. In August 2016, it responded to an article by Marcia Langton in The Monthly on the topic of Indigenous women in prison. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * - Video taken by Mervyn Eades ==External links== * * * Category:Organisations serving Indigenous Australians ","title":"First Nations Deaths In Custody Watch Committee"},{"id":"54211892","text":"Novo Selo (, ) is a village in the municipality of Bogovinje, North Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 1589 inhabitants.

It was built in 1940 and re-opened in 2011. ==History and performance== Nizami Cinema Center Built in 1940, this is one of the oldest cinemas of the country. The cinema center was named after the poet Nizami Ganjavi. In Soviet times, this cinema hosted film festivals and premieres of new works of domestic and foreign filmmaking.Theatres, Cinemas, Concert Halls of Baku: Nizami Cinema Center ‚Äî National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017. During the difficult period of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the interest in going to the movies somewhat weakened. Since the late 1990s-early 2000s, new cinemas started to emerge in the country, equipped with advanced projection and sound technology which showed the latest movies of world cinema. Gradually, the cinemas became attractive again to townspeople and tourists alike. After a thorough renovation in the framework of the ‚ÄúState program on development of Azerbaijani cinema in 2008-2018‚Äù, the Nizami cinema opened its doors to visitors in 2011. It now holds the status of ‚Äúcinema center‚Äù. The opening night of national films are held here, together with previews of films in the current program, including new films from other countries and those in 3-D format. ==Structure of building== Two cinema rooms for 50 and 80 seats are located on the ground floor while the first floor houses a large cinema room with 500 seats, having one of the largest screens in the South Caucasus (18 meters wide). The fourth floor of the cinema has a VIP room with 24 seats. All the rooms of the Cinema Center are equipped with the technology facilities, projection and sound equipment. On the ground floor of the Cinema Center there are commercial kiosks, on the first floor ‚Äì caf√©s, on the third floor ‚Äì a coffee club and a press-center, as well as a 250-seat two-storey restaurant and offices on the fourth and fifth floors.

Its mission is to discover, preserve and share the local area's history and artifacts from the time of its earliest people to the present. The Society's collection of documents and objects are maintained largely at Clinton House in Poughkeepsie where it has offices and a non-circulating library. It publishes an annual Yearbook, and occasionally publishes other books and pamphlets. The organization grants awards of merit and distinction each year. It conducts outreach programs that range from talks to demonstrations to workshops, and it collaborates with educational institutions and many other historic organizations and individuals in Dutchess County. The Historical Society is funded through membership dues, the sales of its Yearbook and publications, solicitation of grants, and through philanthropic gifts and is a US tax exempt Charitable Organization. ==History== Among those eager to found such an organization at the time was Dutchess County resident Franklin D. Roosevelt. He laid out his vision for the Society in a letter dated December 10, 1914, mentioning a number of elements which came to fruition including an annual yearbook, occasional publications, and transcriptions of cemetery headstones. And while other notables like the President's mother Sarah Delano Roosevelt and Vincent Astor remained involved in the Society, its membership grew into the hundreds and involved a broad range of county residents. By early 1924, membership had grown to about 500. John Mylod and Helen Wilkinson Reynolds were early organizers and active in collecting information for the society. Reynolds, a researcher and author, served as Yearbook editor from 1921 until her death in 1943. She worked with author J Wilson Poucher and photographer Margaret De M Brown on the 1924 publication of Old Gravestones of Dutchess County, New York, which catalogued 19,000 inscriptions. ==Collections== The Collections include archival items, photographs, postcards, textiles, diaries, will, deeds, needlework, clothing, genealogical information, and correspondence within its house museum. Items include a portrait by Ammi Phillips of Helen Cornell Manney, whose birth family, the Cornells, were early settlers of the town of LaGrange. There is a collection of books, articles and private letters of historian and illustrator Benson Lossing, who was born in the town of Beekman, lived for some time in Poughkeepsie, and eventually built a home and library in Dover. The Hart-Hubbard Farm Records reflect two families' agricultural wholesale business across four generations from 1838 to 1967.

They occur across Dutchess County often in partnership with the Dutchess County Historian and local historical organizations. ==Publications== 1918 Dutchess County Yearbook. Each year it produces a yearbook and it occasionally publishes the Dutchess County Historical Society Collections and the Dutchess Historian.

He worked as a fishmonger and played local football for his hometown club and Northern League football for Grangetown Athletic. He signed amateur forms with Newcastle United in February 1912. He never played for their first team, and in 1913, he turned professional with Middlesbrough, whom he had earlier rejected in favour of Newcastle. Before the First World War, Harrison was restricted to reserve- team appearances, but when the Football League resumed, Middlesbrough dropped the long-serving Tim Williamson for the First Division match on 4 October 1919 against Manchester United at Old Trafford, and Harrison made his debut. The match finished as a 1‚Äì1 draw, and Harrison kept his place for three more matches, before England international Williamson returned to the side and remained in it for more than two years. Williamson caught influenza in January 1922, and Harrison came into the team for the visit to Manchester City and kept his place for the rest of the season. Harrison did not appear in 1922‚Äì23, but played 11 matches in 1923‚Äì24, which took his total to 31 over five seasons. He spent the 1924‚Äì25 season with Darlington of the Third Division North as backup to the ever-present James Crumley, then signed for another third-tier club, Durham City. He was for the first time his team's main goalkeeper, and played in 36 of the 42 league matches. Harrison moved on again in 1926, to Hartlepools United, who had just lost their goalkeeper Billy Cowell to First Division Derby County. Harrison remained with Hartlepools for two seasons, making 70 appearances in all competitions, before returning to Darlington for 1928‚Äì29. He began the season in the first team, and made 26 appearances in all competitions, the last of which was on 26 January 1929, a 3‚Äì1 defeat at home to Southport, but then lost his place to the 20-year-old future England international Harry Holdcroft.Tweddle, pp. 26, 103.

He was the 36th hereditary chieftain of the Nanbu clan. His courtesy title was Daizen-no-daifu, and his Court rank was Junior 4th Rank, Lower Grade. Toshitaka was the younger son of Nanbu Toshimasa, the 9th daimy≈ç of Morioka Domain, and became daimy≈ç on the death of his father on 17 July 1784. As he was only two years old at the time, there were concerns that the Tokugawa shogunate would use this as an excuse to dissolve Morioka Domain, so his official birthdate was changed from 1782 to 1779. He was not received in formal audience by sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienari until 15 February 1795, and first entered his domains on 13 April of the same year. Due to his youth, the domain was rife with political factionalism, and suffered greatly from the effects of the Great Tenmei famine. In 1817, the domain was officially renamed from \\"Nanbu Domain\\" to \\"Morioka Domain\\". On 18 December 1818, he was promoted to the honorary title of Jij≈´ (Chamberlain), and Morioka Domain was assigned an area in southern Ezo to police on behalf of the Shogunate. The kokudaka of Morioka Domain was officially doubled to 200,000 koku. The same year, Toshitaka promulgated an reformed version of the domain's internal laws. In 1818, he raised one of the hatamoto branch lines of the clan to the status of a subsidiary domain, Shichinohe Domain, and permitted some of his senior retainers to take the Nanbu surname as their own. Nanbu Toshitaka was noted for promoting is retainers based on ability, regardless of family backgrounds; however, this created much ill-will among the older established retainer houses. After his death in 1820, the domain again suffered from much political in-fighting and factionalism. ==References== *Papinot, Edmond. (1948). Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan.

The newly opened through station most closely resembled Falkenstein station, but as early as 1871, Adorf station had to be extended because of the double-tracking of the Plauen‚ÄìEger line to Adorf for the first time. The through station became a junction station with the opening of the whole Chemnitz‚ÄìAdorf railway by the Chemnitz-Aue-Adorf Railway Company (Chemnitz-Aue-Adorfer Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft, CAAE) on 15 November 1875, but the line of the CAAE ended at a separate terminus, which was only connected to the state railways by way of a connection through sets of points. The tracks of the CAAE ended at a turntable in front of the entrance building. After the nationalisation of the CAAE in 1876, Adorf station was again expanded. In 1880, Adorf then received its own Heizhaus (a roundhouse where locomotives were heated). Due to the position of the turntable at the end of the railway line from Aue, there were occasional accidents; a locomotive even ran through the gable wall of the entrance building on 6 January 1900. Little was changed by the extension of the Asch‚ÄìRo√übach railway by the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways to Adorf in 1905. Previously, a contract had been concluded with the railway company under which the State Railways were given two former freight tracks and were allowed to use the remaining tracks of the Royal Saxon State Railways (K√∂niglich S√§chsische Staatseisenbahnen) for payment and to build a water crane and a waiting room. The extension from Ro√übach was opened in 1906. Extensive reconstruction of the station began as part of the double-tracking of the Adorf‚ÄìSiebenbrunn section, since the Siebenbrunn‚ÄìMarkneukirchen railway was planned to run from there. For this reason, a railway construction office (Eisenbahn-Neubauamt) was established in Adorf from 1905 to 1912. Important parts of the reconstruction were: * Raising of the southern end of the station by three and a half metres to eliminate a level crossing * Demolition of the previous locomotive maintenance facility and construction of a new facility at Kaltenbach (line-kilometre 31.86 of the Plauen‚ÄìEger railway) * Extension of the freight yard and the establishment of a marshalling yard * Construction of two island platforms, making a total of six platforms * Construction of a new entrance building * Construction of two new signal boxes, both of which could be operated remotely. In 1912, the station area was a 1.6 kilometres long and had 45 sets of points, eight double sets of points and a crossing loop. As early as 1909, a siding branched off from the station; this operated until 1967. The station survived the Second World War largely undamaged, only suffering from low-flying strafing, which caused little damage. After the war, the second track of the railway was dismantled for reparations and many rail connections within the station became superfluous and were dismantled. The traffic to Ro√übach, which was interrupted at the end of the Second World War, was not resumed, and the route to Ro√übach between 1946 and 1951 was also dismantled. The second track of the Plauen‚ÄìCheb line was not rebuilt until 1979. Island platform (looking towards Plauen) Signal box in Adorf station In 1990, the station consisted of 54 sets of points, two simple crossovers and a crossing loop. The entrance building, which had been abandoned during the last two decades, was demolished in November 2012.  Adorf locomotive depot The Adorf locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk Adorf) developed from the Adorf locomotive yard (Lokstation Adorf), after the construction of a six-storey Heizhaus from 1877 to 1880. Previously, the Haltestelle Adorf (Adorf halt) of the CAAE had a two-stall Heizhaus. After the nationalisation of the CAAE, there were plans for the construction of a Heizhaus at Adorf station, but these were rejected for cost reasons. Four years later a Heizhaus was erected in the immediate vicinity of the entrance building. Because of the cramped conditions, it had to be long and narrow, with space for only a total of six locomotives on its two tracks; a water crane, a workshop and a coal shed were also built. Since the facilities were close to the town, there were numerous complaints from the population about the smoke pollution. Since the facilities could not be extended due to lack of space, during the rebuilding of the station between 1905 and 1912, new facilities were built from March 1906 outside the station area on the Kaltenbach near line-kilometre 31.86 of the Plauen‚ÄìEger railway (located towards Plauen/Ro√übach from Adorf station). The works, which were finished in June 1909, included a fifteen-stall half roundhouse with a 20-m turntable and an administrative building. From 1928 to 1933 the depot facilities were again enlarged. Two new sheds were built, the workshop was expanded and maintenance facilities‚Äîthe construction of an axle lowering facility, improvement of the sanitary facilities, construction of a coal crane‚Äîwere built for the staff. The locomotive depot was dissolved in 1948/49 because of a plan to extend the scheduled route for the daily circulation of locomotives, but the plan was not realised. Adorf station was abolished on 30 June 1969 as an independent depot and subordinated to Reichenbach locomotive depot as a motive-power depot. The locomotive depot was converted on 30 November 1992 into a depot for passenger vehicles only, but it was finally closed in 1997. Currently, the Vogtl√§ndische Eisenbahnverein Adorf uses the facilities and some museum vehicles (including 86 607 and an ELNA 1) are based there.  Locomotive use At first locomotives of classes H VII, H IIIb T, H V T and IV T were stationed in Adorf. Before the First World War, classes V V, I V, XI HV, XI H, XI HV, XII H2 (later class 38.2‚Äì3) and XI HT (class 94.19‚Äì21) were added to these. After the First World War, class XIII H (class 58.4) locomotives were used for freight operations. Locomotives of the Royal Saxon State Railways were used almost exclusively until the end of the 1920s, but afterwards other locomotives were operated occasionally. However, the Saxon State Railways locomotives remained in use at least until 1965. Class 75.5 locomotives were used at Adolf only for a short time; as a substitute for one received at the end of the 1920s, it received several brand new class 86 locomotives. The class 38.2‚Äì3 was supplemented by class 38.10‚Äì40 locomotives, which could be used in the same way. Numerous locomotives of class 58.10‚Äì21 with the same design as class 58.4 were introduced in the Vogtland. Some class 50 locomotives were stationed in Adorf in the Second World War, but before the end of the war they had been replaced by class 52. Classes 38.2‚Äì3, 52, 58, 75.5, 86 and 94.19‚Äì21 locomotives were available in the locomotive depot at the end of the war. In addition, there were individual locomotives of classes 53, 54.15‚Äì17, 91 and 56.34‚Äì35, but they were retired soon after the end of the war or handed over to other departments. The tender locomotives were also retired and were replaced by more tender locomotives of classes 75.5 and 86. With the advent of uranium mining, Adorf once again received class 58.4 locomotives, which from then on also hauled express trains‚Äîincluding the Karlex‚Äîas well as heavy freight trains. In addition, class 50 locomotives were introduced in the mid-1950s. The first time diesel locomotives, belonging to class V 200, were stationed in Adorf in 1968 and the change of traction to diesel was completed in 1971. After that only diesel vehicles were used until the closure of the locomotive depot. In addition to class V 60 locomotives, class V 180 and 130/131/132 locomotives were also based in Adorf. ==References== Notes ==Sources== * * * == External links == Category:Railway stations in Saxony Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1865 Category:Buildings and structures in Vogtlandkreis ","title":"Adorf (Vogtl) station"},{"id":"54212256","text":"Gorno Palƒçi≈°te (, ) is a village in the municipality of Bogovinje, Republic of Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 1356 inhabitants.

It is designed to selectively target tumour tissues of certain kinds of cancer. It is poorly absorbed into most cells, but is actively transported by folate receptor alpha (FRŒ±), which is usually only expressed at low levels in the apical membrane of some specialised tissues, but is expressed at much higher levels in some subtypes of ovarian cancer. This causes the drug to accumulate selectively in tumour tissues, while healthy tissues are only exposed to a much lower concentration.Ng C, et al.

Founded in 2014, the Analogues' ambition has been to perform the Beatles' music from their later studio years live, using analogue and period-accurate instrumentation.The Analogues The Analogues distinguished themselves by performing songs and whole albums live, which the Beatles never played live. While the band does not attempt to look like the Beatles, they have been noted for accurately recreating and reproducing their music. From 2015 to 2016, the Analogues went on their first tour both in the Netherlands and abroad, performing the Magical Mystery Tour album.Review: The Analogues‚Äô Magical Mystery Tour at Norwich Theatre Royal - Norfolk News ‚Äî Eastern Daily Press In 2017, the band toured with a complete performance of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,The Analogues Tickets London ‚Äî The O2 (archived) including a performance at the 17,000-capacity Amsterdam Ziggo Dome on 1 June 2017 to celebrate the album's 50-year existence. In June 2017, Dutch public-service broadcaster NTR aired a one-hour documentary on the band's painstaking process of analysing the Beatles' compositions and experimental use of studio equipment, as well as acquiring the proper analogue instruments, in preparation of live rendition of the Sgt. Pepper's album. Before an album can be performed, the multi-layered arrangements are fully written out by the band. The Analogues signed a six- record deal with Universal Music Group for five live-played Beatles albums and one album with original material inspired by the Beatles. From 2018 to 2019, the Analogues toured the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the UK, playing The Beatles, also known as The White Album. == Instruments == To sound as close to the original recordings as possible, the Analogues have amassed a collection of musical instruments, such as a black-and-white Rickenbacker guitar similar to John Lennon's, a light blue Fender Stratocaster similar to George Harrison's, and a H√∂fner 500/1 bass. Exotic musical instruments from India are also used in their performances, including a dilruba, a swarmandal, a tanpura, a tabla, and a sitar. Further special instruments include a one-metre-long harmonica for The Fool on the Hill and a clavioline for Baby, You're a Rich Man. The band's primary analyst is bass guitarist and producer Bart van Poppel. After a thorough analysis of an album's arrangements and consulting Beatles Gear, they find the necessary equipment such as a 1965 Lowrey Heritage Deluxe organ, or one of only thirty known existing mellotrons in a particular series, used in the intro of Strawberry Fields Forever. == Critical review == In 2014, Het Parool reviewed the premiere of the Magical Mystery Tour and described the Analogues' sound as \\"eerily close\\" to the Beatles. In 2015, De Volkskrant wrote that the band brought the Beatles' sound back to life \\"frighteningly well.\\" In 2016, the Eastern Daily Press reviewed a Norwich performance as a \\"... musical wonder ...\\" providing a \\"... truly magical experience\\". == Personnel == Current members * Jac Bico ‚Äì guitar, vocals * Fred Gehring ‚Äì drums, vocals * Felix Maginn ‚Äì guitars, vocals * Diederik Nomden ‚Äì keys, guitar, vocals * Bart van Poppel ‚Äì bass, keys, vocals and producer Former members * Jan van der Meij ‚Äì guitar, vocals == References == Category:The Beatles tribute bands Category:Dutch pop music groups Category:Dutch rock music groups ","title":"The Analogues"},{"id":"54212329","text":"Digha Heliport is located at Digha, West Bengal, India.

She won the second of her two starts as a two-year-old in 2013 and developed into a top-class filly in the following year, taking the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial and Ribblesdale Stakes. She recorded her biggest victory on her sixth and final appearance when she won the Irish Oaks. She was retired from racing at the end of the season and became a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud. ==Background== Bracelet is a bay mare with a narrow white blaze and two white socks bred in Ireland by Roncon & Chelston, breeding companies associated with the Coolmore Stud. The filly was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle and was ridden in four of her six races by her trainer's son Joseph. Like many Coolmore horses, Bracelet raced in the colours of a partnership consisting of Susan Magnier, Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith. She was from the tenth crop of foals sired by Montjeu whose wins included the Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. As a breeding stallion his other progeny included Motivator, Authorized, Pour Moi, Camelot, Scorpion, Masked Marvel, Hurricane Fly, St Nicholas Abbey and Hurricane Run. Bracelet's dam Cherry Hinton (not to be confused with the mare foaled in 1975) failed to win in five starts but did finish fifth in the 2007 Epsom Oaks and also produced the Rockfel Stakes winner Wading. As a daughter of Urban Sea, Cherry Hinton was a half-sister to both Galileo, Sea the Stars and Black Sam Bellamy. ==Racing career== 2013: two-year-old season Bracelet made her racecourse debut in the Listed Fillies' Sprint Stakes over six furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 3 June 2013 and finished eighth of the ten runners behind the favourite Sandiva. Ten days later the filly stepped up in distance but dropped in class for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse. Starting at odds of 1/2 she took the lead inside the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from the David Wachman-trained Tap Dancing. 2014: three-year-old season On 30 March 2014, Bracelet began her second season in the Group 3 Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial over seven furlongs on very soft ground. After being restrained by Joseph O'Brien in the early stages she began to make steady progress approaching the last quarter mile, overtook the Dermot Weld-trained favourite Balansiya 100 yards from the finish and won by a length. Ryan Moore took the ride when Bracelet was sent to England to contest the 201st running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. She started the 11/1 fifth choice in the seventeen- runner field but was outpaced in the closing stages and came home in fourteenth place, more than ten lengths behind the winner Miss France. Bracelet was ridden by Joseph O'Brien when she was stepped up in distance to contest the Ribblesdale Stakes over one and half miles at Royal Ascot 0n 19 June. Equipped with a hood for the first time, she was made the 10/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Vazira (Prix Saint-Alary), Inchila (fourth in The Oaks), Bright Approach (third in the Cheshire Oaks) and Wonderstruck. After racing in mid-division Bracelet made a forward move early in the straight, took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by half a length and a head from the outsiders Lustrous and Criteria. After the race Joseph O'Brien said \\"She did everything right today. She's tough, she stays and she tries.\\" A month after her win at Ascot Bracelet, ridden by Colm O'Donoghue, was one of ten fillies to contest the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles on good-to- firm ground the Curragh. The O'Brien stable fielded three other runners, namely Tapestry, Marvellous and Palace (Cairn Rouge Stakes). The Epsom Oaks runner-up Tarfasha started favourite ahead of Marvellous, Volume (third in the Epsom Oaks) and Tapestry with Bracelet next in the betting on 10/1. The start of the race was delayed when Volume was found to be wearing a set of horseshoes which were banned in Ireland, and which needed to be replaced before she was allowed to take part. O'Donoghue settled the filly in fourth place as Volume set the pace from Palace and Tarfasha. Bracelet moved forward on the outside shortly after the final turn, took the lead a furlong from the finish and held off the late challenge of her stablemate Tapestry to win by a neck, with the rallying Volume a neck away in third place. After the race Aidan O'Brien praised the winning jockey, commenting \\"It's great for Colm. He's just got beat in this race a few times and he's also been beat in the Derby a few times. He gave her a marvellous ride and he's a world-class rider\\". Bracelet did not race again and was retired at the end of the year. ==Breeding record== After her retirement from racing, Bracelet became a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud.

He studied part-time at the Slade School, Camden Art Centre and Royal College of Art in London. He first performed on saxophone with a number of prominent Sydney improvisers including Serge Ermoll, Jon Rose and Louis Burdett before switching to live mixing of sampled and pre-recorded sound on audio cassette recorders including the TASCAM Portastudio, describing the relationship between the two instruments, 'The tape is improvised in a sense, by equalisation, adding timbres, adding pitch controls, the various combinations of mixing. All those areas give you a sort of phrasing not unlike saxophonists altering their embouchure, and I approach the tapes in this manner.'Roger Dean, \\"assembling...improvising: Rik Rue\\", Sounds Australian, No. 32 Summer 1991-92.

The opera deviates from Shakespeare's original in some aspects: Iago is less diabolical than his Shakespearean counterpart, the setting is Venice rather than Cyprus, and the composer and librettist provided an alternative happy ending to the work, a common practice with drama and opera at one time. Giuseppe Verdi and librettist Arrigo Boito adapted Shakespeare's play to Otello, an Italian grand opera in four acts that was first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan on 5 February 1887. It was Verdi's second to last opera (followed by another Shakespeare adaptation, Falstaff) and is considered by many his greatest. The popular opera attracts world class singers and is found in the repertoire of prominent opera houses. Verdi and his librettist dispensed with the first act of the play. Franco Zeffirelli's 1986 film version of Verdi's opera starring Pl√°cido Domingo as Othello was nominated for the BAFTA for foreign language film.Otello (1986) However, it did not win the award. According to the Kennedy Center's biographical note on Domingo, Laurence Olivier saw Domingo in Otello and, in a mock-furious voice, told Franco Zeffirelli: \\"You realise that Domingo plays Othello as well as I do, and he has that voice!\\" On 25 February 1999, Bandanna, an English language opera in a prologue and two acts with a libretto by Irish poet Paul Muldoon and music by Daron Hagen was performed by the opera theatre at The University of Texas in Austin. The opera is set in 1968 on the United States‚ÄìMexican border and borrows elements from Cinthio's tale, Shakespeare's play, and Verdi's opera. ==In ballet== Mexican choreographer Jos√© Lim√≥n created a 20-minute, four character ballet called The Moor's Pavane to the music of Henry Purcell in 1949. The work premiered at the Connecticut College American Dance Festival in the same year. American Ballet Theatre was the first dance company outside Limon's to include the work in its repertory. It is a standard in dance companies around the world and notable interpreters of the Moor include Rudolf Nureyev. The ballet Othello was choreographed by John Neumeier to music by Arvo P√§rt, Alfred Schnittke, Nan√° Vasconcelos et al. and was premiered by the Hamburg Ballet in Hamburg on 27 January 1985, with Gamal Gouda as Othello, Gigi Hyatt as Desdemona, and Max Midinet as Iago. The work remains in the repertoire of the Hamburg Ballet, seeing its 100th performance in 2008. In 2002, modern dance choreographer Lar Lubovitch created a full-length ballet in three acts based on the Shakespeare play and Cinthio's tale with a score by Elliot Goldenthal. The work has been staged by the San Francisco Ballet with Desmond Richardson, Yuan Yuan Tan, and Parrish Maynard in the principal roles. The ballet was broadcast on PBS's Great Performances: Dance in America and the program was nominated for an Emmy Award. The ballet is recorded on Kultur video. Othello was first performed in New York City at the Metropolitan Opera House, 23 May 1997, by American Ballet Theatre. Other ballets include Prologue choreographed by Jacques d'Amboise for the New York City Ballet in 1967 as a prequel to Shakespeare's play; Othello choreographed by John Butler to the music of Dvo≈ô√°k for Carla Fracci and the La Scala Theatre Ballet in 1976; and a version choreographed by Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux for the Louisville Ballet in the 1980s. ==In film== :See also Shakespeare on screen (Othello). Between 1948 and 1952, Orson Welles directed The Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice (1952), produced as a black-and-white film noir. The film stars Welles as Othello and Suzanne Cloutier as Desdemona. The troubled production was filmed over the course of three years as Welles' time and money permitted, in Mogador, Morocco and Venice. Lack of funds (and costumes) forced Roderigo's death scene to be shot in a Turkish bath with performers wearing only large, ragged towels. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival.Cartmell, Deborah (2000) Interpreting Shakespeare on screen Palgrave MacMillan pp72-77 Rather than focusing on racial disparity, the film plays on a difference between Desdemona and Othello in age, size and personal attractiveness. The film noir colouring of the picture minimised any commentary on Othello's blackness, to the point that the critic F. R. Leavis wrote that the film made no reference to Othello's colour. Unlike Welles's film, Stuart Burge's Othello (1965), based on John Dexter's National Theatre Company's production, starring Laurence Olivier, brings issues of race to the fore, with Olivier putting on an 'African accent' and entering in a large 'ethnic' necklace and a dressing gown. He commented, however, that he did \\"not dare to play the Moor as a full-blooded negro\\". One contemporary critic found the coloration too much, commenting that Olivier was \\"blacker than black, almost blue\\" . Trevor Nunn's 1989 version filmed at Stratford, cast black opera singer Willard White in the leading role, opposite Ian McKellen's Iago. The first major screen production casting a black actor as Othello would not come until 1995 with Laurence Fishburne opposite Kenneth Branagh's Iago ‚Äì not that there have been many major screen productions of Othello: most film versions to date have been filmed stage productions. It was made during the O. J. Simpson trial and commentators such as Cartmell draw parallels between the two whodunit murder stories, and wondered if the film's release was not a little to do with the publicity surrounding Simpson's drama. A modernised, loose retelling, O, completed in 1999 and released in 2001, featured African-American actor Mekhi Phifer in the lead role, which was renamed from \\"Othello\\" to \\"Odin James\\" or \\"O. J.\\", with the story set in an American high school and revolving around sports rather than warfare. Malayalam film Kaliyattam is an adapted version of Othello against the backdrop of the Hindu Theyyam performance. In 1998, Suresh Gopi received the National Film Award for Best Actor, and Jayaraj the award for Best Director for their work on the film. Omkara is a version in Hindi set in Uttar Pradesh, starring Ajay Devgan as Omkara (Othello), Saif Ali Khan as Langda Tyagi (Iago), Kareena Kapoor as Dolly (Desdemona), Vivek Oberoi as Kesu (Cassio), Bipasha Basu as Billo (Bianca) and Konkona Sen Sharma as Indu (Emilia). The film was directed by Vishal Bhardwaj who earlier adapted Shakespeare's Macbeth as Maqbool. All characters in the film share the same letter or sound in their first name as in the original Shakespeare classic.

It was reprinted in 2005 by Can of Worms Press and includes the complete text of the play. In January 2009, a manga adaptation was published in the United Kingdom, with art by Ryuta Osada. It is part of the Manga Shakespeare series by Richard Appignanesi, and is set in Venice in carnival season.http://www.mangashakespeare.com/titles/othello.html ==Fiction== Christopher Moore combines Othello and The Merchant of Venice in his 2014 comic novel The Serpent of Venice, in which he makes Portia (from The Merchant of Venice) and Desdemona (from Othello) sisters. All of the characters come from those two plays with the exception of Pocket, the Fool, who comes from Moore's earlier novel based on King Lear. I, Iago by Nicole Galland depicts the antagonist of the play, Iago, as the protagonist and explores his potential motivations and history. The plot of the Portuguese language novel Dom Casmurro by the Brazilian author Machado de Assis, a translator of Othello into Portuguese, is based upon the play. It is generally considered one of the great novels of Brazilian literature. In 2017, Hogarth (a division of Penguin Random House company) published, as part of the Shakespeare Project, a novel by Tracy Chevalier, New Boy. The characters from Othello are transposed in a Washington D.C. school where eleven-year-old boys and girls re-enact the shakespearian tragedy but in the 1970s. ==Other== *Othello Cake, Danish cake with a Macaron base, cream and chocolate glaze.

SIME was created in December 1939 as the British Government sought to develop a more focussed approach to counter intelligence and developing security intelligence on the spectrum of threats from espionage, subversion, sabotage and eventually terrorism. SIME's first chief (titled Defence Security Officer) was Colonel Raymund John Maunsell, although he had moved on by February 1945 as he was recorded as being at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force G2 based in northwestern Europe. A record of a 1947 visit by two senior Security Service officers to SIME confirmed that it was still based in Cairo and had offices in Baghdad, Jerusalem and Cyprus. Maunsell was succeeded by the following as Chief of SIME: * Brigadier Douglas Roberts * Bill Magan * Robin Stephen * David Stewart * Bill Oughton * Philip Kirby-Green. The SIME organisational model was in employed elsewhere and in 1946 Security Intelligence Far East (SIFE) was established. SIME was disbanded in 1958. ==References== Category:MI5 ","title":"Security Intelligence Middle East"},{"id":"54212772","text":"Johann Bartl (born 31 July 1905, died between 1939 and 1945) was a Czech sprinter.

Unit 1 was commissioned in 1977, Unit 2 in 1978, and Unit 3 in 1979. All three, when first activated, had a capacity of 750 MW. Plans for a fourth, 858 MW coal unit at Martin Lake was formally cancelled in 1986. A man- made lake was created for the plant's cooling source. Martin Lake was retrofitted with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems by Fluor in 2008 to reduce nitrogen oxide () emissions. Martin Lake receives its energy from nearby lignite mines and coal from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Martin Lake used to receive lignite from Oak Hill Mine in nearby Rusk and Panola Counties until its closure in December 2016. One of Martin Lake's units was idled in September 2013 due to low electricity prices.

It was serialized intermittently in Enterbrain's manga magazine Comic Beam starting in its July 2001 issue and has been collected into three . The manga is set in a future where drugs are legally sanctioned and follows the addict Kabu's experiences as he tries a drug called \\"Ultra Heaven\\" and experiments with devices called amplifiers. == Plot == Volume 1 Kabu is a junkie and dealer with suicidal tendencies. Drugs are injected through tubes called \\"pumps\\" or little patches placed on the skin. Kabu's drug of choice is called \\"Peter Pan,\\" a euphoric hallucinogen. The drug isn't really doing it for him anymore, so he goes to pump bars and tries dangerous drug combinations that might kill him, so he can have the ultimate high of a near-death experience. He goes to a pump bar and asks for a dangerous mixture of drugs, but instead the maestro gives him a special called \\"Nova Express,\\" which simulates the experience of dying. After the trip, Kabu stumbles out of the bar in a daze, closely watched by two mysterious salarymen who comment that a junkie like Kabu would be the perfect subject for their experiment. After taking Nova Express, Kabu briefly tries to clean up and start over, but his friend Seven shows up with some Peter Pan and Kabu is back on a desperate search for more. Nobody seems to have Peter Pan anymore, but there are rumors of an even stronger drug that is the most powerful hallucinogen invented. Kabu goes to a park with a friend. A walleyed drug pusher approaches him and offers him Peter Pan. He claims it is \\"special\\" and Kabu doesn't have to pay him unless he loves it. Kabu tries the drug and has a nightmarish trip where he cannot separate his body from objects around him and he ends up killing two sanitation officers. He runs from the scene of the crime and bumps into the drug pusher. The pusher tells him he's been tripping for days and the dream he had was \\"more real than life itself.\\" The pusher says the only cure for the nightmare is jump into another dream with another hit of the drug. The pusher tells Kabu the drug is called \\"Ultra Heaven.\\" The pusher disappears and leaves Kabu with a hit. Since Kabu is still in the last nightmare, more sanitation agents show up and surround him. Kabu takes more Ultra Heaven to escape the agents. An agent shoots Kabu in the head and he enters a trip that lands him in a hygiene department recovering from a drug overdose. The doctors panic when it appears that Kabu's brain is dying. Kabu flies through a mountain paradise. He finally wakes up in the pond in the park, with the pusher laughing hysterically at him nearby. == Release == The manga was serialized in Enterbrain's manga magazine Comic Beam starting in its July 2001 issue, with several hiatuses. Enterbrain collected the manga into three with the first on February 25, 2002, the second on March 25, 2005, and the third on November 26, 2009. The manga has been licensed in France by Gl√©nat and in Italy by D/visual (later acquired by GP Manga). == References External links== * Category:Manga series Category:2001 manga Category:Enterbrain manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Comics about drugs ","title":"Ultra Heaven"},{"id":"54212861","text":"Siaosi Vaili (born 7 September 1977) is a Samoan former rugby union player.

The species occur in Northeastern Mexico and adjacent areas of Texas, United States. They are similar to the closely related genus Omphalodes but a distinct group. == Morphology== Mimophytum species are (sub-)perennial herbs, either with a rhizome or erect. The leaves have petioles and are heart-shaped or rhombic. They produce blue flowers similar to forget-me-nots. The fruits consist of four winged nutlets. The nutlet wing can be turned upwards, creating a navel-like shape, similar to the fruits of Omphalodes. In two species, M. alienum and M. alienoides, there are two differently shaped fruits: two navel-like nutlets and two nutlets with flat wings. In three species, M. omphalodoides, M. benitomartinezii, and M. richardsonii, the wings of the navel-shaped nutlets are beset with small barbed glochidia. ==Systematics== The barbed glochidia on the nutlet wing was a character that led Greenman to describe his new species, Mimophytum omphalodoides, in new genus. However, Greenman already recognized the similarity of many characters of his new species to Omphalodes. The species without these glochidiate nutlet wings were considered as belonging to Omphalodes, but the similarity was always recognized. New phylogenetic work showed that the native Mexican and Texan \\"Omphalodes\\" species are a clade, distinct from the true Omphalodes from Europe. A later phylogenetic placement of the type species of Mimophytum within the North American clade of Omphalodes confirmed the suggested close relationship, leading to the taxonomic transfer of most of the native North American Omphalodes names to Mimophytum. A single remaining Omphalodes species from Mexico, O. erecta was excluded from this process so far, because it is morphologically too deviant to infer an unequivocal classification to Mimophytum from morphology alone. ==References== Category:Boraginaceae genera ","title":"Mimophytum"},{"id":"54212874","text":"A2B may refer to: *A2B Australia, a taxi operator *A2B Bicycles, an electric bicycle company *Adyar Ananda Bhavan, a chain of restaurants and confectioners in India ","title":"A2B"},{"id":"54212877","text":"Cracksman (foaled 9 April 2014) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse. He showed promise when winning his only race as a two-year-old in 2016 before developing into a top class middle distance performer in the following year. As a three- year-old he won the Investec Derby Trial before running third when favourite for the 2017 Epsom Derby and then finishing runner up in the Irish Derby. He went on to win the Great Voltigeur Stakes and Prix Niel before recording an emphatic success in the Champion Stakes. He ended the year as the top-rated three-year-old in the world. In 2018 he won the Prix Ganay and the Coronation Cup before taking a second Champion Stakes. ==Background== Cracksman is a bay colt bred in England by his owner Anthony Oppenheimer's Hascombe and Valiant Studs. He was sent into training with John Gosden at Newmarket, Suffolk. Cracksman is from the first crop of foals sired by Frankel. His dam Rhadegunda showed good form on the track winning three races including the Listed Prix Solitude, and has had some success as a broodmare, producing the Solario Stakes winner Fantastic Moon. She was a granddaughter of the Oppenheimer family's 1000 Guineas winner On the House. Other descendants of On the House's grand-dam Courtessa have included Golden Horn, Rebecca Sharp, Habibti and the Australian champions Danewin and Octagonal. ==Racing career== 2016: two- year-old season On his racecourse debut, Cracksman started at odds of 9/2 in a ten-runner maiden race over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 19 October. Ridden by Robert Havlin he raced towards the rear of the ten-runner field before taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by one and a quarter lengths from the Godolphin runner Wild Tempest. 2017: three-year- old season Spring Cracksman began his second season in the Investec Derby Trial over ten furlongs at Epsom Racecourse on 26 April, a race in which he was ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori. Starting the 4/6 favourite against seven opponents he started poorly and then pulled hard before being settled by Dettori in third place. After struggling to obtain a clear run early in the straight and then finished strongly to catch the Mark Johnston-trained Permian on the line and win by a short head. The form of the race was subsequently boosted when Permian won the Dante Stakes at York Racecourse in May. Summer Despite never having previously contested, let alone won a group race, Cracksman was regarded as a leading contender for the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom on 3 June and was made the 7/2 favourite against eighteen opponents. Ridden by Dettori he tracked the leaders, turned into the straight in fifth and took the lead approaching the final furlong. He kept on well but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and a neck by Wings of Eagles and Cliffs of Moher. On 1 July at the Curragh he faced Wings of Eagles again in the Irish Derby, a race which also attracted the leading French colt Waldgeist. After being restrained in the early stages he made good progress in the straight but failed by a neck to overhaul the front-running Capri with the Derby winner a short head away in third. At York on 23 August Cracksman was made 4/6 favourite for the Group 2 Great Voltigeur Stakes. The \\"Voltigeur\\" is traditionally regarded as a trial race for the St Leger, but Cracksman had never been entered for the Doncaster classic. With Dettori in the saddle he went to the front early in the straight and steadily increased his advantage to come home six lengths clear of the Chester Vase winner Venice Beach. After the race the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Champion Stakes were mentioned as future targets but Gosden emphasised that the colt was still maturing and that \\"his main programme is next year\\". Autumn On 10 September Cracksman was sent to France for the Prix Niel (a recognised trial race for the Arc de Triomphe) over 2400 metres in which he faced four opponents including Finche (Prix Eug√®ne Adam) and Ice Breeze (Prix Hocquart). Starting the odds-on favourite he took the lead in the straight and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by three and a half lengths from Avilius. Oppenheimer opted not to run his colt in the Arc citing the unsuitability of the Chantilly track and his desire to save Cracksman for a four-year-old campaign. On 21 October Cracksman was brought back in distance and was matched against older horses for the first time in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Ascot Racecourse. With Dettori again in the saddle he was made the 13/8 favourite in a ten-runner field which included Highland Reel, Cliffs of Moher, Barney Roy, Brametot (Prix du Jockey Club), Poet's Word and Recoletos (Prix Greffulhe). After racing in fourth place until the final turn, Cracksman went to the front early in the straight and drew away from his opponents to win in \\"impressive\\" style by seven lengths from Poet's Word. Gosden commented \\"He's improved through the year. He's like a fighter weighing more now, if he started as a middleweight, he's now a light-heavyweight. He got in a dreadful muddle coming down to Tattenham Corner in the Derby, but he's learning to race. He's handled a mile-and-a-quarter well today, he's versatile now\\". Dettori said \\"That was amazing. It's my first Champion Stakes and he put a good field to bed in the manner of a champion. It's a fantastic feeling. I glanced at the big screen and he was clear. I‚Äôve not got words to describe it, brilliant. He's been given time to develop and that's what you‚Äôve got now. He's been working so sweetly and has got the success he deserved.\\" 2018: four-year-old season Cracksman began his third campaign in the Prix Ganay at the newly re-opened Longchamp Racecourse on 29 April and stated 3/5 favourite against six opponents including Cloth of Stars and Rhododendron. After racing in second place for most of the way he was sent to the front by Dettori 200 metres from the finish and drew away to win \\"readily\\" by four lengths from Wren's Day. After the race Gosden said Frankie was pleased with him... he got very low and stretched, which is a great thing to see in a horse. The great thing is he's won today on good, and perhaps slightly on the faster side of good, so he's versatile. Mentally I was impressed with just how relaxed and professional he is.\\" On 1 June at Epsom Cracksman started the 2/7 favourite for the Coronation Cup with the best-fancied of his five opponents being Hawkbill and Idaho. Cracksman raced towards the rear until he began to make progress in the straight but he had to be driven hard by Dettori to get the better of the front-running outsider Salouen and it was only in the final strides that he gained the advantage to win by a head. Gosden initially accounted for the somewhat disappointing performance by saying that Cracksman had failed to cope with the downhill section of the course but later eplained that the colt had lunged forward in the starting stalls, struck his head hard against the framework and \\"must have run the race in a complete daze\\". At Royal Ascot nineteen days later the colt tarted 2/5 favourite against five opponents for the Prince of Wales's Stakes over ten furlongs. He was never going well and although he took the lead in the straight he was soon overtaken and beaten two and a quarter lengths into second by Poet's Word. Gosden later suggested that the horse was distracted by the fillies returning to the paddock from the previous race commenting \\"he wasn't quite mentally with us; he got very interested in the girls and obviously caught a little whiff of them and was rather keener to get over the hedge and say hello to them\\". After an absence of four months Cracksman returned and attempted to repeat his 2017 success in the Champion Stakes on 20 October a race in which he was equipped with blinkers for the first time. His seven opponents were Crystal Ocean (Hardwicke Stakes), Capri, Monarchs Glen (Darley Stakes), Rhododendron, Verbal Dexterity (National Stakes), Maverick Wave and the Czech-trained Subway Dancer. After being settled in fourth place he took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and drew right away to win by six lengths from Crystal Ocean, with Dettori waving his whip to the crowd in celebration. Gosden commented \\"I‚Äôm a great believer in putting a semi-blinker on as I‚Äôve had a lot of luck with it down the years and it's a little trick I learned in America. He is a hugely talented horse and he showed it again today and I‚Äôm sure he will be off to stud now\\" while Frankie Dettori said \\"All the lights were on and when I kicked he went ‚Äòwhoosh‚Äô. It was brilliant. He did it all on his own. The blinkers worked and he was concentrating. You know when you are going twice as fast as the others, and I could celebrate\\". ==Stud career== After retiring from racing, Cracksman was placed on the stallion roster at Darley Stud. His initial service fee was listed at ¬£20,000. ==Assessment and awards== On 16 November 2017 at the Cartier Racing Awards, Cracksman was named Champion Three-year-old colt. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Cracksman was rated at 130 to be the third-best horse in the world, the best horse in Europe and the best three-year-old. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Cracksman shared the title of the best horse in the world with Australia's Winx, with the rating 130. ==Pedigree== *Cracksman is inbred 4 √ó 4 to Danzig, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. == References External links== * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart ‚Äì Cracksman Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 9-c Category:Cartier Award winners ","title":"Cracksman (horse)"},{"id":"54212879","text":"Canelo √Ålvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin, billed as Supremacy, was a professional boxing match contested for the unified WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, IBO, Ring magazine, and lineal middleweight championship. The bout was on September 16, 2017, at T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip. It was televised on HBO pay- per-view in the United States, on BoxNation Box Office in the United Kingdom, and on Space in Latin America. Despite Golovkin outlanding Alvarez in 10 of the 12 rounds according to Compubox,https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/09/17/canelo-vs-ggg-judges-scorecards- compubox-stats the fight ended in a controversial split draw, with Dave Moretti scoring the fight 115‚Äì113 for Golovkin, Adalaide Byrd scoring it 118‚Äì110 for √Ålvarez, and Don Trella scoring it 114‚Äì114. Byrd's scorecard especially was subject to a very large amount of criticism, with many critics describing the decision as a robbery. The controversial outcome led to the organization of a rematch, which was tentatively scheduled for May 5, 2018. The fight was cancelled after √Ålvarez tested positive for a banned substance in March 2018, and formally withdrew pending hearings with the Nevada Athletic Commission in April. After facing a suspension until August 17, 2018, √Ålvarez and Golovkin agreed to reschedule the rematch to September 15, 2018. == Background == Following Canelo √Ålvarez's victory against Miguel Cotto in 2015, talks began between the Golovkin and √Ålvarez camps over the future WBC title defense. In the end, an agreement was ultimately reached to allow interim bouts before the fight to, in the words of WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman, \\"maximize the interest in their highly anticipated showdown. The fight was anticipated to take place well into 2016. On May 18, 2016, a few weeks after knocking out Amir Khan, √Ålvarez vacated the WBC middleweight title, which resulted in Golovkin being immediately awarded the title by the WBC who officially recognized him as their middleweight champion. Immediately after his victory over Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. on May 6, 2017, Canelo √Ålvarez announced that he would next fight Gennady Golovkin on the weekend of September 16, 2017 at a location to be determined. Golovkin joined him in the ring during the announcement to help promote their upcoming bout, accompanied by his trainer Abel Sanchez and promoter Tom Loeffler. Speaking through a translator, √Ålvarez said, \\"Golovkin, you are next, my friend. The fight is done. I've never feared anyone, since I was 15 fighting as a professional. When I was born, fear was gone.\\" When Golovkin arrived in the ring, he said, \\"I feel very excited. Right now is a different story. In September, it will be a different style -- a big drama show. I'm ready. Tonight, first congrats to Canelo and his team. Right now, I think everyone is excited for September. Canelo looked very good tonight, and 100 percent he is the biggest challenge of my career. Good luck to Canelo in September.\\" In the post-fight press conference, both boxers came face to face and spoke about the upcoming fight. On May 9, Eric Gomez, president of Golden Boy Promotions told the LA Times that √Ålvarez had an immediate rematch clause in place on his contract, whereas Golovkin, if he loses, won't be guaranteed a rematch. De La Hoya later also revealed in an interview with ESPN the fight would take place at the full middleweight limit of 160 pounds with no re-hydration clauses, meaning Golovkin and √Ålvarez would be able to gain an unlimited amount of weight following the weigh in. On June 5, the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue of the fight, and would mark the first time Golovkin would fight in the state of Nevada. The AT&T; Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Dodger Stadium missed out on hosting the fight. Eric Gomez of Golden Boy Promotions said in a statement that √Ålvarez would fight for the IBF meaning he would participate in the second day weight in, which the IBF require that each boxer weighs no more than 10 pounds over the 160 pound limit. Although he said there was no word on whether √Ålvarez would fight for the WBC title, √Ålvarez claimed that he would not be. On July 7, 2017 Golden Boy and K2 Promotions individually announced the tickets had sold out. == Fight details == On fight night, in front of a sold out crowd of 22,358, √Ålvarez and Golovkin fought to a split draw (113‚Äì115, 114‚Äì114, 118‚Äì110). ESPN's Dan Rafael and HBO's Harold Lederman scored the fight 116‚Äì112 in favour of Golovkin. Judge Adalaide Byrd's scorecard of 118‚Äì110 in favor of √Ålvarez was widely ridiculed. Many observers felt that Golovkin had won a narrow, closely contested fight, and while a draw was justifiable, a card that wide in favor of √Ålvarez was inexcusable. Nevertheless, Bob Bennett, director of the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC), said that he had full confidence on Byrd going forward.https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-live-canelo-judging-controversey- unfolds-in-1505634309-htmlstory.html Despite the controversy, several mainstream media outlets referred to the bout as a \\"classic\\". The fight started with both boxers finding their rhythm, √Ålvarez using his footwork and Golovkin establishing his jab. During the middle rounds, particularly between 4 and 8, √Ålvarez started each round quick, but seemed to tire out after a minute, with Golovkin taking over and doing enough to win the rounds. The championship rounds were arguably the best rounds and √Ålvarez started to counter more and both fighters stood toe-to-toe exchanging swings, the majority of which missed. The draw saw Golovkin make his 19th consecutive defence, just one behind middleweight great Bernard Hopkins. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin was the busier of the two, landing 218 of 703 thrown (31%), while √Ålvarez was slightly more accurate, landing 169 of his 505 thrown (33%). Golovkin out landed √Ålvarez in 10 of the 12 rounds. == Post-fight == Speaking to Max Kellerman after the fight, Golovkin said, \\"It was a big drama show. The scoring is not my fault. I put pressure on him every round. Look, I still have all the belts. I am still the champion.\\" √Ålvarez felt as though he won the fight, saying \\"In the first rounds, I came out to see what he had. Then I was building from there. I think I won eight rounds. I felt that I won the fight. \\"I think I was superior in the ring. I won at least seven or eight rounds. I was able to counterpunch and made Gennady wobble at least three times. If we fight again, it's up to the people. I feel frustrated over my draw.\\" Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez believed judge Byrd had her scorecard filled out before the first bell rang. √Ålvarez ruled out another fight in 2017, claiming he would return on Cinco de Mayo weekend in May 2018. At the post-fight press conference, √Ålvarez said through a translator, ‚ÄúLook, right now I wanna rest. Whatever the fans want, whatever the people want and ask for, we‚Äôll do. You know that‚Äôs my style. But right now, who knows if it‚Äôs in May or September? But one thing‚Äôs for sure ‚Äì this is my era, the era of Canelo.‚Äù Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler stated that they would like an immediate rematch, but Golovkin, who prefers fighting at least three times in a calendar year, reiterated his desire to also fight in December. == Reception == The fight surpassed Mayweather-√Ålvarez to achieve the third highest gate in boxing history. ESPN reported the fight generated $27,059,850 from 17,318 tickets sold. 934 complimentary tickets were given out, according to the NSAC. Mayweather vs. √Ålvarez sold 16,146 tickets to produce a live gate of $20,003,150. The replay, which took place a week later on HBO averaged 726,000, peaking at 840,000 viewers. The LA Times reported the fight generated 1.3 million domestic PPV buys. Although HBO didn't make an official announcement, it is believed that the revenue would exceed $100 million. ==Fight card== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%;\\" - ! e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\\" Weight class ! e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\\" ! e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\\" vs. ! e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\\" ! e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\\" Type ! e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\\" Round ! e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\\" Time ! e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\\" Notes - Middleweight  Canelo √Ålvarez vs.  Gennady Golovkin (c) align=centerSD align=center12/12   - Featherweight  Joseph Diaz def.

ESPN reported that √Ålvarez, who only had the rematch clause in his contract, had to invoke it within three weeks of their fight. On September 19, Golden Boy Promotions president Eric Gomez told ESPN that everyone on their side was interested in the rematch and they would hold discussions with Tom Loeffler in the next coming days. Ringtv reported that the negotiations would begin on September 22. On September 24, Gomez that the fight would likely take place in the first week of May 2018, but left the possibility of it occurring as early as March. At its 55th annual convention in Baku, Azerbaijan on October 2, the WBC officially ordered a rematch. Golden Boy president Eric Gomez told ESPN that \\"regardless of if they did or didn't order the rematch, we are going to try to make it happen. We'll do whatever it takes to make it happen.\\" On November 7, Eric Gomez indicated the negotiations were going well and √Ålvarez would make a decision in regards to the rematch in the coming weeks. It was believed that Golden Boy would wait until after David Lemieux and Billy Joe Saunders fought for the latter's WBO title on December 16, 2017 before making a decision. On November 15, Eddie Hearn, promoter of Daniel Jacobs, stated that he had approached Tom Loeffler regarding a possible rematch between Golovkin and Jacobs if the √Ålvarez-Golovkin rematch fails to take place. On December 20, Eric Gomez announced that the negotiations were close to being finalized after √Ålvarez gave Golden Boy the go-ahead to write up the contracts. On January 29, 2018 HBO finally announced the rematch would take place on May 5, 2018. Both fighters said that this time the judges would not be needed, with both men promising to knock the other out. Facing a competing bid from New York City's Madison Square Garden, the rematch was booked to once again be held at T-Mobile Arena. According to the WBC, unlike the first bout, √Ålvarez would fight for their title. The fate of the rematch was put in jeopardy on March 5, 2018, when √Ålvarez tested positive in two random urine tests for the banned substance clenbuterol. The NAC opened an investigation, and √Ålvarez was temporarily suspended on March 23, 2018‚Äîpending a hearing on April 10. In the hearing, √Ålvarez will face the possibility of a one-year suspension. Loeffler stated that Golovkin intended to fight on May 5, regardless of his opponent. Former two-time light middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade made an offer to fight if √Ålvarez received a long-term suspension, as well as IBF #1 contender Sergiy Derevyanchenko. On March 29, 2018, NAC chief Bob Bennett filed a formal doping complaint against √Ålvarez, which delayed the disciplinary hearing to the commission's next monthly meeting on April 18. ESPN.com writer Dan Rafael felt that this delay made it more uncertain that the fight would not go ahead, while T-Mobile Arena announced that it would offer full refunds on tickets. On April 3, 2018, Alvarez officially withdrew from the fight. Gomez explained that \\"given the current regulations in Nevada we have been advised, and it is unfortunate, that Canelo won't be cleared to fight in May. We are hopeful this matter will be resolved and we are hoping Canelo will be cleared so we can reschedule the fight for August or September.\\" During the hearing, √Ålvarez was given a six-month suspension. As suspensions are retroactive from the date that the first positive test was collected (February 17, 2018), the suspension ends August 17, 2018. On June 13, 2018, √Ålvarez and Golovkin agreed to a new deal to hold the rematch. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Gennady Golovkin's career boxing record * Canelo √Ålvarez's career boxing record Golovkin Category:2017 in boxing Category:Golden Boy Promotions Category:Boxing in Las Vegas Category:T-Mobile Arena Category:Boxing on HBO Category:September 2017 sports events in the United States Category:2017 in sports in Nevada ","title":"Canelo √Ålvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin"},{"id":"54212892","text":"Ernest C.

It was originally introduced by Edward McCreight. It is effectively an extension of the priority queue with the purpose of improving the search time from O(n) to O(s + log n) time, where n is the number of points in the tree and s is the number of points returned by the search. == Description == The priority search tree is used to store a set of 2-dimensional points ordered by priority and by a key value. This is accomplished by creating a hybrid of a priority queue and a binary search tree. The result is a tree where each node represents a point in the original dataset. The point contained by the node is the one with the lowest priority. In addition, each node also contains a key value used to divide the remaining points (usually the median of the keys, excluding the point of the node) into a left and right subtree. The points are divided by comparing their key values to the node key, delegating the ones with lower keys to the left subtree, and the ones strictly greater to the right subtree. == Operations ==  Construction  The construction of the tree requires O(n log n) time and O(n) space. A construction algorithm is proposed below: tree construct_tree(data) { if length(data) > 1 { node_point = find_point_with_minimum_priority(data) // Select the point with the lowest priority reduced_data = remove_point_from_data(data, node_point) node_key = calculate_median(reduced_data) // calculate median, excluding the selected point // Divide the points left_data = [] right_data = [] for (point in reduced_data) { if point.key <= node_key left_data.append(point) else right_data.append(point) } left_subtree = construct_tree(left_data) right_subtree = construct_tree(right_data) return node // Node containing the node_key, node_point and the left and right subtrees } else if length(data) == 1 { return leaf node // Leaf node containing the single remaining data point } else if length(data) == 0 { return null // This node is empty } }  Grounded range search  The priority search tree can be efficiently queried for a key in a closed interval and for a maximum priority value. That is, one can specify an interval [min_key, max_key] and another interval [-, max_priority] and return the points contained within it. This is illustrated in the following pseudo code: points search_tree(tree, min_key, max_key, max_priority) { root = get_root_node(tree) result = [] if get_child_count(root) > 0 { if get_point_priority(root) > max_priority return null // Nothing interesting will exist in this branch. Return if min_key <= get_point_key(root) <= max_key // is the root point one of interest? result.append(get_point(node)) if min_key < get_node_key(root) // Should we search left subtree? result.append(search_tree(root.left_sub_tree, min_key, max_key, max_priority)) if get_node_key(root) < max_key // Should we search right subtree? result.append(search_tree(root.right_sub_tree, min_key, max_key, max_priority)) return result else { // This is a leaf node if get_point_priority(root) < max_priority and min_key <= get_point_key(root) <= max_key // is leaf point of interest? result.append(get_point(node)) } } == See also == * Range tree == References == Category:Trees (data structures) Category:Geometric data structures ","title":"Priority search tree"},{"id":"54212938","text":"C√°diz Club de F√∫tbol is a professional beach soccer team based in C√°diz, Andalusia, Spain.

He works for the U.S. Department of Defense as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve. He is the author of the non-fiction book How to Catch a Russian Spy (). He also cochairs the Swatting Mitigation Advisory Committee for the Seattle Police Department. ==Biography== Jamali was born to a French mother and a Pakistani father who met attending graduate school in New York. They later opened a store in Dobbs Ferry, New York, called Books & Research, Inc., which specialized in obtaining books and documents in the pre-Internet age. Starting in 1988, they cooperated with the FBI, which was interested in Soviet (and later Russian) intelligence agents who came into the store seeking hard-to-find U.S. government documents. Jamali graduated from New York University (1999) with a degree in Political Science and Government. After 9/11, he reached out to the FBI to offer his services, as his parents were nearing retirement. He later became a double agent when a Russian GRU member named Oleg Kulikov attempted to recruit him. The ruse lasted from 2005 to 2009, during which time Kulikov paid Jamali for what he thought were classified documents. The operation ended with Jamali being \\"arrested\\" by the FBI in front of Kulikov, blowing Kulikov's cover as a diplomat in the United States. Following the operation, Jamali was sworn in to the United States Navy Reserve as an Intelligence Officer. He is a contributor to MSNBC and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, an American think tank. In 2015, Jamali and Ellis Henican co-wrote a book, How to Catch a Russian Spy: The True Story of an American Civilian Turned Double Agent. 20th Century Fox purchased the film rights for the book; it was announced that Mark Heyman will write the screenplay with Marc Webb directing.

Norman (1914-1991) was an American advertising executive who co- founded the Norman, Craig & Kummel advertising agency. ==Biography== Norman B. Norman was born to a Jewish familyJewish Virtual Library: \\"Modern Jewish History: Advertising\\" retrieved May 4, 2017 in New York City. In 1934, he graduated from Columbia University. After school, he worked as an unpaid assistant at the Biow Agency founded by Milton H. Biow. After six months, he was given a salary of $5 a week, and after two years, he was making $25 per week. While at the Biow Agency, he worked in all areas of the business including research, new business, and account management. In 1942, he joined the United States Navy where he served during World War II on a minesweeper as a lieutenant; he was awarded a Bronze Star. After the war, he worked for the Norman A. Mack & Company as an executive vice president and then in 1948, he accepted a position with the William H. Weintraub & Company. In 1955, he along with fellow Weintraub co-workers, Eugene H. Kummel and Walter Craig, bought the William H. Weintraub agency and renamed it Norman, Craig & Kummel. In 1957, he was elected president of the agency and pioneered the concept of what he called \\"emotional advertising\\" aimed at having the reader find himself inside the advertisement. The tenets were summed up in one word: P-E-O-P-L-E: Put people in the sell; Excitingly different look and sound; Open the way through the heart-not the head; Put in an important reason why; Living visuals people will talk about; Eliminate any non-preemptive selling proposition. The firm won many major clients including Colgate-Palmolive, Revlon, Ronson, Chanel, Liggett & Myers, and Olin Corporation. In 1956, the firm won the U.S. Democratic National Committee account and its presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, going head-to-head with its rival Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn. In 1961, the firm was renamed the NCK Organization. In 1979, he retired as president and chairman of the board; he served as honorary chairman until 1985. By 1982, the NCK Organization had 1,184 employees in 32 offices worldwide with $433 million in sales and $70 million in income. In 1983, the firm merged with Foote, Cone & Belding Communications and ceased to exist under its own name. Norman served as the director of the Association for a Better New York and as a trustee of the New York Police Foundation. ==Personal life== Norman was married to Gail Snyder; they had two children: Peter Norman and Susan Norman Blumenthal. They had homes in Woodstock, Vermont, in Fairfield, Connecticut, in the Cotswolds of England, and in Key Largo, Florida. Norman died in Miami at the age of 77. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Advertising people Category:1914 births Category:1991 deaths Category:American Jews Category:Columbia University alumni ","title":"Norman B.

Soul Deep Records released the project on May 19, 2017. Puyol worked with Chuck Hemann, a frequent collaborator, in the production of the EP. The album artwork and design is by Edward Bayonet of iAMbayo.net. One of the first singles, \\"There Go That Man,\\" was featured on ESPN's First Take during live broadcasts from the home cities in the 2017 NBA Finals and continued to be heard on the show throughout June. The track features Houston rap veteran Lil Raskull and is the second song from the duo to receive such placement on this network/show. (The previous effort was \\"Game Changer\\" in January 2016.) Later that month the network extended the licensing agreement and used the song on their 2017 NBA Draft preview show as well as the next evening's live broadcast of the event. \\"There Go That Man\\" was utilized in as the single theme in an introductory video package, a clip showcasing the overall number one pick, and as background music throughout the five-hour telecast. The title track, \\"Shut It Down,\\" was licensed by CBS for a Miami Dolphins highlight package from the team's pregame show against the Minnesota Vikings and used as the theme song for the Miami Dolphins weekly TV show, Dolphins Weekly, throughout the 2017 National Football League (NFL) season. The Calgary Stampeders are also big fans. So far the Canadian Football League's (CFL) team has used three Rawsrvnt songs to hype up in-game action and promotional videos - and each year their team went to the championship game to capture the Grey Cup. The first was \\"Go Hard\\" (2016) from the album Game Changer (Rawsrvnt album), \\"All In\\" featuring Teron Carter (of GRITS fame) and Pettidee (2017), and \\"Shut It Down\\" featuring PyRexx (2018) from Rawsrvnt's Shut It Down EP. 2018 was the year the team officially \\"Shut It Down\\" with a 27-16 win over the Ottawa Redblacks to win it all. It's the Stampeders eight Grey Cup, and the team's first victory since 2014. The project features a guest artist on each of the five tracks and has Rawsrvnt leaning in to the sports anthem sound heard on several songs from his extensive catalog that have been used in athletic competitions and related national broadcasts. Shut It Down EP guest appearances are: PyRexx, Japhia Life, Greg Cooks, Lil Raskull, Pettidee and Teron Carter. ==Music videos== Two music videos were released to support the Shut It Down EP. The first was a gritty performance clip shot and edited by Blurry Vision Films for the title track. Rawsrvnt joined PyRexx in Dallas, Texas for the shoot that was later given a \\"Visual Remixx\\" treatment with additional eye-popping effects by iAMbayo.net. \\"On the Line\\" also received a music video treatment. Japhia Life and Rawsrvnt met up in Miami, Florida to shoot the visual with Joel Davis (aka Geek formally of the group Surf Gvng). The video switches between darker scenes shot in front of the city's iconic, art deco Colony Hotel and a beautiful sunset at South Beach. Press materials for the release mentioned that the song's lyrics were \\"deeper than they first appear\\" given circumstances taking place in Rawsrvnt's life at the time the video was created. ==Critical reception== In his review for New Release Today, titled \\"Music for The Finals,\\" Mark Ryan gave the album three out of five stars and noted that, \\"The production on this EP is well done.\\" Rating the album a seven out of ten for Cross Rhythms, Tony Cummings says, \\"For me though the best cut is the title track which the rapper himself calls his 'motivational music.'

He was adopted as heir by Toshitaka, and became daimy≈ç on his death in 1820. As he was still underage, domain affairs were managed by his uncle, Nanbu Nobuchika of Shichinohe Domain. Toshimochi was married to the daughter of Maeda Narihiro of Kaga Domain. However, on 17 September 1821 he died of injuries sustained after falling from a tree in his gardens. As this death occurred before even his first formal audience with the sh≈çgun, the clan retainers were concerned that the Shogunate would use this as an excuse to reduce or abolish Morioka Domain, so the death was unreported. Toshimochi‚Äôs cousin Kitar≈ç, of similar age and appearance, was selected as his replacement. ==Nanbu Toshimochi (Kitar≈ç)== The second Toshimochi was born in Morioka on 19 December 1803 as the third son of Nanbu Nobukiyo, a descendant of Nanbu Toshimi, the 7th daimy≈ç of Morioka Domain. Shortly after the \\"real\\" Toshimochi died, he was renamed and brought to Edo to take his place, and was received in formal audience by sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienari on 15 November 1821. He was confirmed as daimy≈ç of Morioka, and received the courtesy title of Daizen-no-taifu and junior 4th court rank, lower grade in December of the same year. He was also wed to the first Toshimochi's widow. Due to his age and the circumstances of his accession, he was unable to quell the factionalism which plagued the domain's politics. The domain also had financial problems in meeting its obligations to the shogunate in Ezo territory. Furthermore, the S≈çma Daisaku Incident, in which a former Nanbu samurai attempted to assassinate the daimy≈ç of Hirosaki Domain, Tsugaru Yasuchika occurred in April 1821. Fearing that the shogunate might demand his life over the incident, Toshimochi appointed Nanbu Toshitada as his heir. In 1825, he travelled to Edo due to illness, and died there at the age of 23. His only child was a daughter (later the wife of Nanbu Toshitomo), and per his will, Nanbu Toshitada became the next daimyo of Morioka. ==References== *Papinot, Edmond. (1948).

Three species occur on the South American mainland and one, Selkirkia berteroi (sometimes written berteri), the first of the genus to be reported, is an endemic on Robinson Crusoe Island off the coast of Chile. It was previously considered a monotypic genus. == Morphology== Selkirkia species are perennial, either a shrub (S. berteroi) or decumbent, ascending or erect herbs to subshrubs. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, and mostly occurring along the stem, not in rosettes. The corolla is white (S. berteroi) or blue to violet. The fruits consist of four nutlets, which are beset with barbed glochids, and superficially similar to the fruits of hound's tongues. The fruits of S. berteroi are somewhat winged and seemingly attached to the style but in fact, like the other three species, on a pyramidal gynobase. == Distribution and conservation == The four species occur in forested areas of South America and Robinson Crusoe Island. Selkirkia berteroi is an endemic shrub on Robinson Crusoe Island, and due to the narrow distribution to be considered critically endangered according to IUCN criteria. Selkirkia trianae is a species in the undergrowth of dense, primary cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador. Although there are not many data, land conversion into pastures might pose a threat to the species. The remaining two species, Selkirkia limense and Selkirkia pauciflora occur in the forests of the Mediterranean climates of Chile. They are likely endangered (not officially assessed though) due to deforestation and land conversion for agriculture. ==Systematics== Boraginaceae systematics relied strongly on fruit morphology, so all four species were initially thought to belong to Cynoglossum, where the four nutlets typically are beset with barbed glochidia. However, fruit morphology turned out to be unreliable for classification. When Selkirkia pauciflora (under its illegitimate name Cynoglossum paniculatum) was found to be closely related to Myosotidium hortensia and Omphalodes, Serrano et al. placed the species into a new genus, Mapuchea. However, after inclusion of the two other native South American \\"Cynoglossum\\" species and Selkirkia berteroi, it turned out that these four species are closely related to each other and sister to Myosotidium hortensia. Due to the similar growth habit (more or less shrubby) and the glochidiate nutlets, the four species are now considered as more widely circumscribed genus Selkirkia. ==References== Category:Boraginaceae genera ","title":"Selkirkia (plant)"},{"id":"54213168","text":"Balochistan United Women Football Club is a Pakistani women's football club based in Quetta.

She is remembered in particular for her portraits of August Strindberg and L. A. Ring. She was also active in social work and feminism. ==Biography== Born on 12 August 1858 in Skuldelev, Hornsherred, Sophie Holten was the daughter of the parish priest Hans Nicolai Holten (1829‚Äì71) and Marenstine Smith (1830-1913). She received private instruction in painting from Christen Dalsgaard in Sor√∏ and later from Carl Thomsen in Copenhagen. From 1875 to 1876, she attended N. Zahle's School. In 1879, she went to Paris where she tried to assimilate the most modern methods of painting from teachers including F√©lix-Joseph Barrias and Alfred Stevens. On returning to Denmark, she exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1883. Shortly afterwards, she returned to Paris, exhibiting in the Salon (1886‚Äì87). In the 1890s, she travelled to the Nethlerlands, Germany, Italy, England and Greece. Holten exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. She continued to exhibit in Charlottenborg until 1904, presenting genre works, portraits and flower paintings. In addition to her portrait of Strindberg, her Brudstykke af Parthenons Cellefrise (1901) and her painting of the Erechtheion Temple (1904) attracted attention. As a young women, Holten exhibited confidence in her own abilities which encouraged her to avoid marriage. In the late 1880s, she wrote reviews of female artists in Kvinden og Samfundet which was published by the Danish Women's Society. She also lectured on clothing, calling for attire which would free women from their traditional role of the housewife. She was one of the driving forces behind the Copenhagen Women's Exhibition in 1895, supporting a proposal for a women's exhibition building (although this was not realized until 1936). In later life, after a period in Assisi, Italy, Holten became a Roman Catholic. Settling in Roskilde with her friend Erikke Rosen√∏rn- Lehn, she decorated the city's St Laurenti Church. For this work she received the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice award. She is buried in the churchyard of the city's Old Church of Our Lady ==References External links == * Category:1858 births Category:1930 deaths Category:19th-century Danish painters Category:19th-century Danish women artists Category:20th-century Danish painters Category:20th-century Danish women artists Category:Danish women painters Sophie Category:People from Frederikssund Municipality Category:People from Roskilde ","title":"Sophie Holten"},{"id":"54213225","text":"Heinz Zander, born 2 October 1939 in Wolfen, is a German painter, draughtsman, graphic artist, illustrator and writer.

Employers have to contribute 24% of their gross payroll for healthcare and employees 15% of their earnings. This entitles contributors and their families to reimbursement of between 80% and 100% of the cost of medical procedures, prescriptions, dentistry, rehabilitation, pregnancy and childbirth, and some hospitalizations. French and Italian citizens can use public health facilities if they have contributed to their home country‚Äôs state health care scheme. The Carte Vitale, which is issued on registration with the Caisses Sociales de Monaco, is used to record administrative, not clinical, information about patients. Patients must register with a doctor employed through the scheme. There is also a great deal of private practice. There are three public hospitals: Princess Grace Hospital Centre, the Cardiothoracic Center of Monaco and the Haemodialysis Centre. Total health expenditure in the country was only about 4% in 2014. ==References== Category:Monaco stubs ","title":"Health in Monaco"},{"id":"54213289","text":"The Asus Vivo lineup consists of laptops (VivoBooks), All-in-Ones (Vivo AiO), desktops (VivoPC), Stick PCs (VivoStick), Mini PCs (VivoMini), smartwatches (VivoWatch), computer mouse (VivoMouse) and tablets (VivoTab).

Most Uyghurs immigrated from Xinjiang to the United States from the late 1980s onwards, with a significant number arriving after July 2009. ==History== Uyghurs history in the United States dates back to the 1960s with the arrival of a small number of immigrants. In the late 20th century, after a series of Xinjiang conflicts, thousands of Uyghurs fled from their homeland of East Turkestan to Kazakhstan, Turkey, European countries, Canada and Australia, New Zealand and other countries. A 2010 estimate put the Uyghur population in the United States at one thousand, however the Uyghur American Association has said that more have moved to the United States in the 2010s because of the crackdown in China in July 2009. Several thousand Uyghurs are said to be living in the Washington, D.C. area, which has the largest population of Uyghurs in the United States. There are also small populations of Uyghurs in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Houston. As of 2019, the Chinese government was reported to routinely carry out harassment and abuse of Uyghurs in the United States in an attempt to control the speech and actions of the estimated 1,500-5,000 persons of Uyghur ethnicity living in the United States. Section 8 of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 requires a report on \\"efforts to protect United States citizens and residents, including ethnic Uyghurs and Chinese nationals legally studying or working temporarily in the United States, who have experienced harassment or intimidation within the United States by officials or agents of the Government of the People‚Äôs Republic of China\\" to be produced within 90 days. ==Organizations== As with other ethnic groups in the United States, Uyghur Americans also have several organizations. The most well-known organizations are Uyghur American Association, a Washington D.C. based advocacy organization which was established in 1998 by a group of Uyghur overseas activists to raise the public awareness of the Uyghur people, the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement, a youth led organization which was set up by Uyghur graduate student Salih Hudayar in 2017 and East Turkistan Government in Exile, which was set up by Uyghur activist Anwar Yusuf Turani in 2004. ==Notable people== US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo meets with USCIRF Commissioner Nury Turkel and Chinese dissidents (July 2020) *Rushan Abbas, activist *Gulchehra Hoja, journalist with Radio Free Asia *Shohret Hoshur, journalist with Radio Free Asia *Salih Hudayar, current Prime Minister of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile *Elnigar Iltebir, Director for China at the United States National Security Council *Shoukhrat Mitalipov, stem cell researcher *Maya Mitalipova, work at Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT *Anwar Yusuf Turani, political activist *Nury Turkel, commissioner on the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom *Mihrigul Tursun, former dentainee in the Xinjiang re-education camps ==See also== *World Uyghur Congress *East Turkistan National Awakening Movement *East Turkistan Government-in-Exile ==References== Category:Central Asian American Category:Uyghur diaspora ","title":"Uyghur Americans"},{"id":"54213315","text":"Psych-Out is a 1968 counterculture film.

As a three- year-old he won the Dee Stakes and finished second in the 2017 Epsom Derby. Cliffs of Moher was euthanised after breaking his shoulder in the running of the 2018 Melbourne Cup at Flemington Racecourse on 6 November 2018. ==Background== Cliffs of Moher was a bay colt bred in Ireland by the Wave Syndicate, a breeding company associated with the Coolmore Stud organisation. The colt was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of his ownership changed from race to race: He had sometimes been listed as being the property of Susan Magnier, while on other occasions he was described as being owned by a partnership of M. Jooste, Derrick Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo is now one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland eight times so far. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Cliffs of Moher was the first foal produced by his dam Wave who showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from four starts. Wave's dam, Queen Cleopatra, finished third in both the Irish 1,000 Guineas and the Prix de Diane and was a full-sister to Henrythenavigator. ==Racing career== 2016: two-year-old season Cliffs of Moher made his racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Cork Racecourse on 15 October in which he was ridden by his trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien. Starting at odds of 4/1 in a fourteen-runner field he kept on well in the closing stages without ever looking likely to win and came home fifth, more than nine lengths behind the winner Spanish Tenor. Two weeks later in a similar event at Leopardstown Racecourse the colt was ridden by Seamie Heffernan and started 7/2 third choice in the betting behind his stablemate Orderofthegarter. Despite sweating up before the race he went to the front soon after the start and was never headed thereafter, winning \\"easily\\" by five and a half lengths from Orderofthegarter. 2017: three-year-old season On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Cliffs of Moher was sent to England to contest the Dee Stakes (a trial race for The Derby) over ten and a half furlongs at Chester Racecourse on 12 May. He was ridden by Ryan Moore and started the 4/5 favourite against seven opponents headed by the Michael Stoute-trained Mirage Dancer. He was amongst the leaders from the start, took the lead a furlong out and won by one and a half lengths from the Godolphin representative Bay of Poets. On 3 June Cliffs of Moher was one of six Ballydoyle runners in an eighteen-runner field for the 238th running of the Epsom Derby and started the 5/1 second favourite after being selected by the stable's top jockey Ryan Moore. After being restrained towards the rear of the field, he made rapid progress on the outside in the straight. He overtook the favourite Cracksman inside the last furlong, but was caught in the final strides by the outsider Wings of Eagles and beaten three-quarters of a length into second place. The colt was then dropped in distance and matched against older horses in the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park on 8 July. He was made the 7/4 favourite, but lost his chance after being badly hampered and finished fourth behind Ulysses who won by a nose from Barney Roy. At York Racecourse in August the colt started at odds of 9/2 in the International Stakes. In a change of tactics he led from the start but was overtaken in the straight and finished fourth behind Ulysses, Churchill and Barney Roy. 2018: four-year-old season Cliffs of Moher was renamed The Cliffsofmoher when sent to race in Australia in October 2018, to avoid confusion with another horse already running in Australia. The Cliffsofmoher broke down during the 2018 Melbourne Cup, reportedly breaking his right shoulder, and was subsequently put down. ==Pedigree References External links== * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart ‚Äì Cliffs Of Moher Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 9-c Category:2018 racehorse deaths Category:Horses who died from racing injuries ","title":"Cliffs of Moher (horse)"},{"id":"54213333","text":"Hardware security as a discipline originated out of cryptographic engineering and involves hardware design, access control, secure multi-party computation, secure key storage, ensuring code authenticity, measures to ensure that the supply chain that built the product is secure among other things. A hardware security module (HSM) is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides cryptoprocessing. These modules traditionally come in the form of a plug-in card or an external device that attaches directly to a computer or network server. Some providers in this discipline consider that the key difference between hardware security and software security is that hardware security is implemented using \\"non- Turing-machine\\" logic (raw combinatorial logic or simple state machines). One approach, referred to as \\"hardsec\\", uses FPGAs to implement non-Turing-machine security controls as a way of combining the security of hardware with the flexibility of software. Hardware backdoors are backdoors in hardware. Conceptionally related, a hardware Trojan (HT) is a malicious modification an electronic system, particularly in the context an integrated circuit. A physical unclonable function (PUF) is a physical entity that is embodied in a physical structure and is easy to evaluate but hard to predict. Further, an individual PUF device must be easy to make but practically impossible to duplicate, even given the exact manufacturing process that produced it. In this respect it is the hardware analog of a one-way function. The name \\"physical unclonable function\\" might be a little misleading as some PUFs are clonable, and most PUFs are noisy and therefore do not achieve the requirements for a function. Today, PUFs are usually implemented in integrated circuits and are typically used in applications with high security requirements. Many attacks on sensitive data and resources reported by organizations occur from within the organization itself. ==See also== * Computer compatibility ** Proprietary software ** Free and open-source software *** Comparison of open-source operating systems *** * Trusted Computing * Computational trust * Fingerprint (computing) * Side-channel attack ** Power analysis ** Electromagnetic attack ** Acoustic cryptanalysis ** Timing attack * Supply chain security * List of computer hardware manufacturers * Consumer protection * Security switch *Vulnerability (computing) *Defense strategy (computing) *Turing completeness *Universal Turing machine *Finite-state machine *Automata theory ==References External links == *Hardsec: practical non-Turing-machine security for threat elimination \\"Hardsec\\" concept outline Category:Computer hardware Category:Computer security Category:Cyberwarfare Category:Product design ","title":"Hardware security"},{"id":"54213340","text":"Rajasthan Football Association (RFA) is the state governing body for football in Rajasthan, India.

In order to replace the tram line, a metro line to Niendorf was required. Since there was no money to finance the cost of building a new line from Stephansplatz to Niendorf via the Grindel quarter, Hoheluft, and Lokstedt, which would have followed the path of the former tram line 2, it was decided that the line to Eimsb√ºttel (the U2) would be extended instead.Ulrich Alexis Christiansen: Hamburgs dunkle Welten. Berlin 2. Aufl. 2010. Originally, Hagendeel station was not in the original plans for the Niendorf extension, since the path between the existing terminus, Hagenbecks Tierpark, and Niendorf crossed a sparsely populated area. However, at the request of the Eimsb√ºttel district council, the Hagendeel stop, originally planned under the working title \\"Hinter der Lieth\\" was added as a supplementary stop. About a year after the end of tram service, construction of the Niendorf extension began on July 7, 1979. In order to cut costs, the extension was supposed to be built aboveground, but ended up being built underground for environmental protection reasons. The cost of construction also influenced how Hagendeel was built, as shown by the fact that the side platforms at the station are narrower than usual. ==Services== Hagendeel is served by Hamburg U-Bahn line U2. == References == Category:Hamburg U-Bahn stations in Hamburg Category:Buildings and structures in Eimsb√ºttel Hamburg Hagendeel Hamburg Hagendeel ","title":"Hagendeel (Hamburg U-Bahn station)"},{"id":"54213402","text":"Yegor Alekseevich Petrov (incorrectly Aleksandrovich, ; 1862/1871, Yekaterinburg ‚Äî 1918/1919, Irkutsk) was a Russian worker and deputy of the Second Imperial Duma from the Perm Governorate in 1907. == Literature == * –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –ï–≥–æ—Ä –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–µ–≤–∏—á (in Russian) // –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –¥—É–º–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏: 1906‚Äî1917 / –ë. –Æ. –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –ê. –ê. –ö–æ–º–∑–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞, –ò. –°. –†—è—Ö–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è. ‚Äî –ú.: –†–û–°–°–ü–≠–ù, 2008. ‚Äî P. 456. ‚Äî 735 p. ‚Äî . * –ß–ª–µ–Ω—ã –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –î—É–º—ã (–ø–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—ã –∏ –±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏). –í—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π —Å–æ–∑—ã–≤. 1907‚Äî1912 –≥–≥. / –°–æ—Å—Ç. –ú. –ú. –ë–æ–∏–æ–≤–∏—á. ‚Äî –ú., 1907. ‚Äî P. 241.

The series focuses on Michael Kerrigan (Sean Bean), the priest of a Roman Catholic parish in a northern English city, who despite suffering from his own troubles stemming from a traumatic childhood, tries to guide several of his most vulnerable parishioners through the trials and tribulations of everyday life. The series, produced by LA Productions, was commissioned in 2015; with filming taking place throughout 2016. The series was originally due to begin on 23 May, but the broadcast was postponed following the Manchester Arena bombing the previous night, and was replaced in the schedules by a repeat of Planet Earth II. This was due to the nature of the storyline in the first episode, which focuses on mum-of-three Christina Fitzsimmons (Anna Friel), who after losing her job, resorts to keeping her mother's death a secret in order to continue claiming her state pension. The series was directed by Ashley Pearce and Noreen Kershaw; while Shaun Duggan, Colette Kane and Nick Leather all contributed to McGovern's scripts. The series was released on DVD on 10 July 2017. Bean won a BAFTA for Best Actor while Friel was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. ==Cast== Main * Sean Bean as Father Michael Kerrigan * Adrian Dunbar as Father Peter Flaherty * Anna Friel as Christina Fitzsimmons * Muna Otaru as Helen Oyenusi * Mark Stanley as PC Andrew Powell * Aisling Loftus as PC Dawn Morris * Paula Malcomson as Roz Demichelis * Ned Dennehy as Karl McKenna * Danny Sapani as Daniel Martin Supporting * Clare Calbraith as Mariella Fitzsimmons * Paul Copley as Joe Kerrigan * Iain Hoskins as Policeman * Vanessa Earl as Beth Kerrigan * Steve Garti as Eddie Kerrigan * Jerome Holder as Vernon Oyenusi * Lauren Lyle as Chloe Demichelis * David McClelland as Christopher Kerrigan * Faye McKeever as Caroline Powell * Eileen Nicholas as 'Nan' Fitzsimmons * Naomi Radcliffe as Pauline Pickering * Sam Rintoul as Young Michael Kerrigan * Rochenda Sandall as Jean Reid * Matthew Wilson as PC Ian Wakefield ==Production and filming== This series was filmed in Liverpool, although the city is not directly mentioned in the series itself.

He played college football at Wisconsin, and was signed by the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent in 2017. ==Early years== Shelton attended Plantation High School in Plantation, Florida. He was a defensive back for their football team. As a senior, he was rated as a four-star recruit and the 27th best cornerback in the nation. After receiving offers from several big colleges such as Florida State, Ole Miss, and West Virginia, Shelton committed to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison to play college football. ==College career== In his first year with the Badgers in 2013, Shelton played all 13 games in the season which included 12 starts at cornerback, in which he recorded thirty-six tackles, four interceptions (tying for third in the Big Ten), and seven pass breakups.

In his final season with Wisconsin in 2016, he had a career high season in interceptions and pass breakups with 4 interceptions and 12 pass-breakups.

Formed in Savannah, Georgia in 2003, the group was originally composed of vocalist and guitarist John Baizley, guitarist Tim Loose, bassist Summer Welch and drummer Allen Blickle. Signed with Hyperrealist Records, the band released their first two EPs in 2004 and 2005, simply titled First and Second. A Grey Sigh in a Flower Husk, featuring two tracks by Baroness and four by fellow Savannah-based band Unpersons, was released in July 2007. After Loose was replaced by Brian Blickle, the band released its debut full-length studio album Red Album through Relapse Records in September 2007. A second change of guitarist followed in September 2008, when Blickle left after just two years in the band and was replaced by Pete Adams. After the first two Baroness EPs were issued together as First & Second in December 2008, the group's second album Blue Record was released in October 2009. It was the band's first release to chart, reaching number 117 on the US Billboard 200 and topping the Heatseekers Albums chart. Welch left Baroness in April 2012 and was replaced by Matt Maggioni, although he was not featured on the band's third album, with all bass performed by Baizley. Yellow & Green, released in July 2012, reached number 30 on the Billboard 200, while lead single \\"Take My Bones Away\\" registered at number 38 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart. In August 2012, while on tour to promote Yellow & Green, Baroness were involved in a bus crash which resulted in injuries keeping Baizley, Blickle and Maggioni hospitalized for several weeks. Shortly after the group announced that they would be returning to touring, Blickle and Maggioni announced that they would be leaving.

First season is the official remake of Bengali serial Ke Apon Ke Por while second season is the remake of Hindi serial Diya Aur Baati Hum ==Plot== Season 1 The plot focuses on the story of Sembaruthi, or Semba (Alya Manasa), a maid working for the Rajasekar family. Both Rajasekar (Auditor Sridhar) and his wife Lakshmi (Rajya Lakshmi) treat Semba as their own daughter, but their daughters-in-law Archana Sridevi Ashok and Vadivu (Shabnam) and Rajasekar's elder daughter (Nandhini Vinoth, played by Aishwarya Appaya) worry that Semba will inherit part of the family property, reducing their own shares. They mistreat Semba. Karthik (Sanjeev) is Rajasekar's younger son and returns to Chennai after a period spent working as a scientist in Singapore. Karthik takes a stand against the difficulties Semba faces. Karthik's ex-girl friend Divya comes from Singapore to visit his family. Vadivu's brother Sanjay attempts to seduce Semba and is stopped by Karthik. Karthik has the idea that Semba should marry, and uploads Semba's profile to a marriage website. A groom comes to visit, but Sanjay intercepts him and tells him lies about Semba, so he leaves without meeting Semba. Archana brings in a groom who is a distant relative, and an alcoholic. This groom's family proposes marriage within two days, and Rajasekar's family accepts the proposal. Preparations for the wedding are in full swing when it is discovered that the groom is still married to his first wife, whom he abandoned. Meanwhile, Karthik and Divya are planning to get engaged on Semba's wedding day. Divya goes to the airport to fetch her parents, who are arriving from Singapore. Semba's marriage is stopped and Rajasekar is blamed by everyone for Semba's pitiable position. Rajasekar, who is in a devastated state, persuades Karthik to marry Semba to mitigate the disaster of the failed wedding. Divya arrives at the last moment, just in time to see the wedding become official. Divya asks Karthik whether he married Semba only out of pity, but Karthik remains silent and she leaves, angrily. After Divya leaves, Karthik allows himself to show his anger by throwing things. Karthik's mother realises for the first time that he has been sacrificed. She too becomes furious and turns against her husband, and eventually against Semba. Semba does not expect Karthik to treat her like a real wife, so she continues to work as a maid. One day Lakshmi's friend comes to meet Karthik's wife, not knowing the history, and she criticises the family for marrying a maid to their son. Humiliated, Lakshmi is persuaded by Archana and Vadivu to call Divya back. Meanwhile, Rajasekar plans to hold a reception for the newlyweds. No one supports his decision except his brother Chandrashekar, his youngest daughter Vinodhini, and her fiance Harish. Divya comes to the reception for Karthik and Semba and makes a dramatic scene when Karthik accepts Semba as his wife. Then the couple prepares to spend their first night together. But Lakshmi suddenly begins to have chest pains. Karthik panics and stays with his mother. Since she is not allowed to see Lakshmi, Semba sleeps alone in the room she should have shared with Karthik. This event is a turning point, as Lakshmi and Karthik begin to appreciate Semba. Archana, Vadivu and Sanjay all try to undermine Semba and make her leave the house, but the result is that Karthik begins to fall in love with her. A beauty competition leads Archana to make Semba work overtime giving her beauty treatments. Karthik becomes angry, and makes Semba participate in the competition, which she eventually wins. Karthik entrusts Semba with documents relating to his secret work on topics to do with space and the military. Archana, Vadivu and Sanjay steal the documents and put the blame on Semba. Karthik is angry and says humiliating things to Semba. Semba finds the documents and reveals that Sanjay was the thief, but is so humiliated that she leaves the house. Karthik later finds her and brings her home. Karthik and Semba's relationship becomes stronger, and Karthik proposes to Semba and she accepts. Meanwhile, Divya offers Karthik a job without revealing her identity. Karthik and Semba go to a party to celebrate Karthik's new job, and find Divya there. She was previously married to Vicky, a rich 65-year-old businessman, and is wealthy. While Karthik is working at her company, she moves into Karthik's house as a guest and tries to get help from the family to separate Semba and Karthik. Archana, Vadivu and Sanjay agree to leave Karthik alone in the house, in return for Rs.50,00,000. Divya drugs Karthik; while he is unconscious, she tries to have sex with him. Semba uncovers Divya's plot. Vinodhini, Karthik's youngest sister, is engaged to Rajasekar's friend's son Harish, but Vadivu's father Devraj wants his son Sanjay to marry Vinodhini instead, to gain control of Rajasekhar's family. When Harish's family asks about the dowry, Devraj increases the dowry to stop the marriage. Rajasekhar is not very well off at the moment, but decides to take his savings of Rs.80,00,000 from his bank. But his cheque bounces. The bank manager says that Rajashekar's elder son Amudhan has forged Rajashekar's signature and emptied his account. Devraj, knowing this, has set a trap by making Rajashekar's house security for a loan of Rs 50,00,000 Lakhs, carrying interest of 0.2% per week. At Harish and Vinodhini's marriage, the loan giver stops the proceedings by demanding his weekly interest, as Devraj planned. Finally, Rajashekar sells his house to cover the debt.

Previously, it was a divisional game in the South division of the Colonial Athletic Association, and conference game in the Yankee Conference and Atlantic 10 beginning with the Dukes entry in 1993. During this period, the teams have combined for three National Championships (James Madison in 2004 and 2016, Richmond in 2008) and fourteen Conference Championships (James Madison in 1998, 2004, 2008, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019; Richmond in 1998, 2000, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2015).http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nova/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/footbl- guide-2003-81-84.pdf All of James Madison's home games have been hosted at Bridgeforth Stadium in Harrisonburg, Virginia while Richmond hosted its contests at City Stadium until 2009, and from 2010 onward at Robins Stadium, both in Richmond, Virginia; as of 2016, only one game has been played on a neutral field, a 1985 matchup in Norfolk, Virginia. The rivalry has become increasingly intense over the years, likely due to the stark differences between the two institutions (Large Public School vs. Small Private School), and the continued success of both programs. On October 24, 2015 the rivalry played host to ESPN College Gameday, as the show was broadcast from the campus of James Madison University before the two teams squared off. The result of the game was the highest scoring affair to date, with the Spiders beating the Dukes 59-49. One interesting note in this matchup is the frequency with which the visiting team wins the contest. In the 27 games these teams have played as conference rivals, the visiting team has won 15 times, including 5 consecutive years from 1993‚Äì1997, 6 consecutive years from 2004‚Äì2009, and another 3 consecutive years from 2014‚Äì2016. The two teams met again on September 29, 2018, marking the 27th consecutive season they have played as conference foes, and the 33rd consecutive season overall.

The club runs two senior sides and seven junior sides. Cleethorpes play their home games at Taylor's Avenue, and their previous grounds include Lucarly's and Lindsey School Rugby Pitches. The club's home colours are navy, gold, and white. They get their nickname of 'The Meggies' from the nickname for the residents of the town. ==History== The club was established in 1979 when a group of schoolteachers from Lindsey School, led by Ian Brown, Lee Stephens, and Ron Duffield, were annoyed by the fact that after their students left school, they gave up rugby. They invited players to a meeting at Cleethorpes Cricket Club and Cleethorpes Rugby Club was born. The club's first competitive game took place at RAF Waddington, against a team fielded by the air base. Cleethorpes lost this match, the final score being 29-10. During the 1990s, the club experienced a decline. During this period, it could only turn out one team. However, the club held many charity events during this period, such as publishing a Calendar Girls-style calendar. In recent years, the club have experienced better fortunes, now being able to turn out two senior sides, and several junior sides.

It was created in 2007 by former magazine-editor Mia Freedman as an online blog. The website has since expanded, growing into an online hub for women's news and opinion across many subjects, with over 100 different contributors creating content for the site. ==History== Origin as a blog Mia Freedman started Mamamia in 2007, following her exit from the Nine Network as creative services director. Freedman had previously worked for magazine publisher ACP as editor-in-chief of the Australian editions of Cosmopolitan, Cleo, and Dolly, but left the industry after growing tired of monthly deadlines in the modern 24-hour news cycle. Despite having no experience with online publishing, Freedman was able to draw from her 15 years of experience in the magazine industry to build the site and develop a readership base. Expansion into Mamamia Women's Network In 2010, Jason Lavigne, Freedman's husband, joined the business, and led its transformation from a personal blog into a profitable online media business. The company launched an Australian variant of iVillage under licence from NBCUniversal in 2012 in an effort to attract advertisers across both sites through a larger combined audience. Compared to Mamamia, iVillage was described as being less edgy and having a more mainstream focus while primarily targeting mothers. Following the launch, Freedman took on the title of publisher and editorial director for the wider business, while former political press secretary Jamila Rizvi became editor. The website expanded into radio in August 2012 with the launch of radio program Mamamia Today hosted by Emelia Rusciano and Dave Thornton on the Today Network. The show aired throughout Australia between 3pm and 4pm weekdays, but was axed within a year due to budget cuts at the network. Mamamia sought to further expand its audience in 2014 with the launch of The Glow ‚Äì a health and beauty based platform designed primarily for mobile devices, headed by editor Alyx Gorman. Another sister site, Debrief Daily, was launched in March 2015, targeting the over 40 women's market. Together, the various sites made up the Mamamia Women's Network. The company took over full control of the iVillage website in June 2015, ending its partnership with NBCUniversal and rebranding the site as The Motherish. It has since become part of the Mamamia umbrella brand. Mamamia began planning its anticipated move into the US market in mid 2015 following the appointment of Kylie Rogers, a former Network Ten sales director, as managing director of Mamamia Women's Network. In March 2016, it launched its US venture Frank + Flo. Brand consolidation and restructure Mamamia announced in November 2015 that it would be ending its network-style model and consolidating its various brands in the Australian market into its principal site, Mamamia. Content from The Motherish, The Glow, and Debrief Daily would continue to be produced, but would be published via Mamamia in order to avoid fragmenting its audience across destinations. It signalled that it would seek to expand its podcast network and produce more video content. It also aimed to launch Broad Media, a media consultancy business aimed at assisting brands in connecting with a female audience. The site underwent a major rebrand in August 2016, receiving a new logo and altered slogan, finalising the consolidation of the formerly separate brands into the single Mamamia website. The US site Frank + Flo remained separate but was renamed Spring St. Following the departure of editor-in-chief Kate de Brito in October 2016, Mamamia announced a major restructure of the business. Editorial control would be split between news content, to be headed by existing deputy editor Gemma Garkut, and entertainment ‚Äì which was to oversee the creation of all podcast and video content ‚Äì led by Holly Wainwright. The site appointed Rebecca Jacobs, a former NineMSN executive producer, as editorial and product director of the business ‚Äì replacing de Brito's role. Mamamia signalled a move into covering a broader range of topics, including sports, finance, and travel. Mamamia began seeking out prospective investors for the business in December 2016, and is estimated to worth A$80 million on the market. The site now employs over 120 staff. Podcast launch In February 2019, Mamamia launched their first podcast with partner, MyBudget. The podcast, The Quicky, is a daily podcast that looks to give a rundown of the day's top stories. ==Other brands== Spring St A US-based sister site to Mamamia, Frank + Flo, was launched in March 2016 under the editorial control of Sarah Bryden-Brown. The site offers a range of lifestyle content, similar to its Australian counterpart. Instead of using traditional display ads, the website would use branded content and a e-commerce platform to generate revenue. In September 2016, Frank + Flo was renamed Spring St following consumer feedback. The company announced that it planned to replicate the success of Mamamia's Australian podcast network by launching a similar female-oriented podcast network under its new Spring St brand. Following the departure of Bryden-Brown, Jennifer Owens was appointed as editor of the US website in December 2016. In July 2017, Mamamia announced that it would be scaling back its US venture due to a slow advertising market and strong competition. A number of staff were made redundant after a decision to move the commercial operations of Spring St to Australia, leaving a team of four US-based writers to run the content on the US website. A large proportion of the website's material will continue to be sourced from the Mamamia website but repurposed towards a US audience. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Mamamia ‚Äì Official website * Spring St ‚Äì Official website Category:Australian women's websites Category:Australian news websites Category:Podcasting companies ","title":"Mamamia (website)"},{"id":"54213962","text":"Alberto Barucco (born 8 February 1906, date of death unknown) was an Argentine sprinter.

It was centred around the village of Moha on the right bank of the river Mehaigne and its nearby castle.L√©on Vanderkindere, La formation territoriale des principaut√©s belges au Moyen √Çge, vol. 2 (Brussels: H. Lamertin, 1902), pp. 151‚Äì56. The \\"county\\" of Moha was originally an allod. It came to be regarded as a county only in the 11th century, when its lords became counts of Eguisheim, and later counts of Dagsburg and Metz. Among its dependencies were the manors of Antheit, Saint- Jean, Waleffe and Wanze. ==Alberts I and II== The first recorded lord (not count) of Moha was Albert I, known from a charter of the bishopric of Li√®ge dated 1031 and from another of Archbishop Poppo of Trier dated to 1040‚Äì44. This Albert may have belonged to the House of Verdun, since he signed immediately after Count Albert II of Namur in 1031 and Duke Godfrey the Bearded in the 1040s. Furthermore, Archbishop Poppo's charter was issued on behalf of Count Gozelo I of Montaigu and his wife. Albert I was succeeded by Albert II, but how or even whether they are related is unknown. Albert II married Hedwig (Heilwig), a daughter of Count Henry I of Dagsburg and Egisheim, himself a son of Count Henry VI and nephew of Pope Leo IX. According to a letter of Pope Leo, his nephew Henry was dead by 1050. He was succeeded in Dagsburg by his son Hugh VII and in Egisheim by his daughter, who thus passed the county to Albert II. He became, by a combination of his new title (count) with his old allodial lordship (Moha), the first count of Moha. The Codex Hirsaugiensis explicitly refers to Albert as count of Egisheim. In his own donation to Marbach Abbey, he refers to himself as \\"the count of Egisheim, called of Moha\\". Finally, in a document from Sint-Truiden Abbey he is called simply the count of Moha. In 1089, Hugh VII died and Albert II inherited Dagsburg. After the death of Hedwige, he married Ermesindis, daughter of Count Conrad I of Luxembourg. Hugh VIII, his son by Hedwig, succeeded to the county of Dagsburg around 1098, while Egisheim passed to another branch of the family. Thereafter, Moha remained in the hands of the counts of Dagsburg until the death of the last of the line in 1212. Ruins of the castle of Moha today ==War of succession== In 1201, Count Albert II of Dagsburg (Albert III of Moha) made Duke Henry I of Brabant his heir for the castle of Dagbsurg and the county of Metz if he should die without an heir of the body. Moha was included in this grant. In 1204, Albert altered the terms of his will, leaving the same possessions to the bishopric of Li√®ge. In these two wills the legal status of the territory is not confused by the traditional title of \\"county\\". It is described as the allodium de Muha [or Musal] et de Waleve. On Albert's death in 1212, the county of Moha was disputed between Li√®ge and Brabant. Duke Henry, assisted by Waleran, heir of the Duchy of Limburg, marched an army as if to attack Moha, while Bishop Hugues de Pierrepont moved with his army to Huy. Bypassing Moha, the duke attacked undefended Li√®ge while the bishop force-marched his army back from Huy. Li√®ge was occupied on 3 May and looted for four days. On 8 May, Henry began the siege of Moha, but failing to take it quickly, abandoned it on 10 May.J. F. Verbruggen, The Art of Warfare in Western Europe During the Middle Ages: From the Eighth Century to 1340, 2nd ed. (Boydell, 1997), pp. 155‚Äì58. The bishop immediately set to work strengthening and rebuilding Li√®ge. In July, strengthened by alliances with Marquis Philip I of Namur, Count Louis II of Looz and Count Ferdinand of Flanders, he moved against Brabant. Threatened by a superior force, Henry opened negotiations. In the end, he relinquished his claim on Moha. The settlement did not last. In October 1213, Bishop Hugues and Ferdinand invaded Brabant from two sides, claiming that Henry was not fulfilling his obligations under the prior treaty. When Ferdinand was forced to divert his attention to his French border, the bishop called on the count of Looz. Henry marched an army through the county of Moha and the two sides met in the Battle of Steppes on 13 October 1213. The Li√®geois were victorious. The county of Moha was confirmed to the bishop. ==List of lords and counts== *Albert I (or Adalbert I), fl. 1031 ‚Äì c. 1042 *Albert II (or Adalbert II), before 1050 ‚Äì 1097/8 :For subsequent counts, see County of Dagsburg. ==NotesReferences== Category:History of the Low Countries Category:House of Ardennes Category:Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge ","title":"County of Moha"},{"id":"54214001","text":"Allocosa caboverdensis is a species of wolf spider of the family Lycosidae, endemic to Cape Verde.

He is a former Yokohama Shopping Street Six-Man Tag Team Champion and also won Kaientai Dojo's 2010 K-Metal League. == Professional wrestling career == Hashimoto enrolled in Animal Hamaguchi's professional wrestling dojo while still in high school at the age of 18 in 2008, and eventually graduated from the school in 2009. Hashimoto then joined Big Japan Pro Wrestling's dojo for further training before making his debut on September 21, wrestling Takumi Tsukamoto to a time limit draw. Only a few months into his career, Hashimoto won Kaientai Dojo's 2010 K-Metal League, defeating Ganko Taketo in the final. This earned him a match for the Independent Junior Heavyweight Championship, where he unsuccessfully challenged Marines Mask on June 20, 2010. Hashimoto competed primarily in BJW for the next few years of his career, whilst also making occasional appearances for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Pro Wrestling Zero1. While in Zero1, Hashimoto began teaming with Daichi Hashimoto, dubbing themselves \\"Team Yamato\\". Though they share the same surname, they are not related in any way. In late 2012, Team Yamato took part in the Big Japan Tag League, finishing with 4 points and failing to advance to the final. In January 2014, Hashimoto debuted for German promotion Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw), teaming with Ryuichi Kawakami to unsuccessfully challenge Hot & Spicy (Axel Dieter Jr. and Da Mack) for the wXw World Tag Team Championship. On June 1, he and Daisuke Sekimoto unsuccessfully challenged Dangan Yankees (Takashi Sugiura and Masato Tanaka) for the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. In November, he teamed with Koji Kanemoto in the 2014 Saikyo Tag League, making it to the final where they were defeated by Yankee Nichokenju (Isami Kodaka and Yuko Miyamoto). In early 2015, he and Sekimoto took part in Pro Wrestling Noah's 2015 Global Tag League, finishing with one win and two points and failing to advance to the final. In early 2016, Hashimoto took part in All Japan Pro Wrestling's Junior Battle Of Glory, but was forced to pull out after suffering an arm injury. Hashimoto spent 5 months recovering from the injury, and eventually returned to the ring on August 23, 2016, having lost 16 kilograms and looking far more ripped than he did prior to his injury. == Championships and accomplishments == *Big Japan Pro Wrestling :*BJW Junior Heavyweight Championship (1 time) :*Yokohama Shopping Street 6-Man Tag Team Championship (2 times) ‚Äì with Jaki Numazawa and Abdullah Kobayashi (1) and Yuji Okabayashi and Takumi Tsukamoto (1) *Kaientai Dojo :*K-Metal League (2010) == References == Category:1990 births Category:Japanese male professional wrestlers Category:Living people ","title":"Kazuki Hashimoto"},{"id":"54214103","text":"kabel eins Doku is a free-to-air television channel owned by ProSiebenSat.1 Media.

Higher education providers from elsewhere in the United Kingdom are allowed to opt-in, but the rating has no impact on their funding. The TEF rates universities as Gold, Silver or Bronze, in order of quality of teaching. The first results were published in June 2017. This was considered a \\"trial year\\" (even though the non-provisional ratings awarded are valid for 3 years) and is to be followed by a \\"lessons learned exercise\\" that will feed into the 2018 TEF and longer-term plans for subject-level ratings. In October 2017 the official title of the exercise was officially renamed from Teaching Excellence Framework to the Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework. ==Ratings== The TEF ratings are based on statistics such as dropout rates, student satisfaction survey results and graduate employment rates. These are assessed by experts in teaching and learning who make a recommendation to a TEF panel, which includes academics and students, that will make the final award. Universities are measured across three areas: teaching quality, learning environment, and student outcomes and learning gain. For 2017, all institutions meeting basic standards will be allowed to raise fees. The first ratings were to have been announced on 14 June 2017, publication having been delayed from May due to the UK general election, but were postponed until 22 June after the election resulted in a hung parliament. It was expected that 20‚Äì30% of the institutions would be rated gold, 50‚Äì60% silver, and 20% bronze. The actual distribution, across all rated institutions including further education and alternative providers, was 26% gold, 50% silver, 24% bronze. The ratings are described by the Department for Education as: * Gold: \\"provision is consistently outstanding and of the highest quality found in the UK Higher Education sector\\" * Silver: \\"provision is of high quality, and significantly and consistently exceeds the baseline quality threshold expected of UK Higher Education\\" * Bronze: \\"provision is of satisfactory quality\\" Institutions that do not enter the TEF or that do not meet the minimum quality threshold will not receive an award. Institutions with insufficient data for a full assessment but which meet the quality standards can receive an unrated provisional award. The TEF ratings do not measure absolute performance, like traditional university league tables, but rather performance against benchmarks based on their student intake. A university with a low absolute dropout rate of 2% and a benchmark of 2% would thus be rated worse on this measure than a university with a much higher absolute dropout rate of 8% but a benchmark of 11%. The ratings are thus a measure of whether a university exceeds, meets or falls short of expectations based on the profile of students admitted and subjects taught. The \\"initial hypothesis\\" for the ratings is based on six core metrics, for which institutions receive a double-positive flag, a positive flag, no flag, a negative flag or a double-negative flag, depending on whether they exceed or fall short of their benchmark by certain thresholds. These are: * Teaching on my course (from the National Student Survey) * Assessment and feedback (from the National Student Survey) * Academic support (from the National Student Survey) * Non-continuation (from the Higher Education Statistics Agency and Individualised Learner Record data) * Employment or further study (from the Destination of Leavers from Higher Education survey) * Highly skilled-employment or further study (from the Destination of Leavers from Higher Education survey) Institutions received three or more positive flags and no negative flags are initially considered Gold; institutions with two or more negative flags are initially considered Bronze; all other institutions are initially considered Silver. This initial hypothesis can then be modified by the panel based on the written submissions and 'split' metrics (a break down of the core metrics by gender, ethnicity, age, disability, etc.). While the extent of these modifications was expected to be limited, changes were made to the initial hypothesis in 22% of cases. Among higher education institutions and alternative providers, three were downgraded, 17 were upgraded from Bronze to Silver, 15 were upgraded from Silver to Gold, and one was upgraded from Bronze to Gold. Following the publication of the 2017 \\"trial year\\" results, the TEF is to undergo a \\"lessons learned exercise\\" that will feed into the 2018 exercise as well as a full independent review on its use of statistics by 2020. ==Reaction to 2017 results== After the publication of the results, the acting director of the Russell Group said that \\"TEF does not measure absolute quality and we have raised concerns that the current approach to flags and benchmarking could have a significant unintended impact.\\" while the vice-chancellor of the University of Southampton , which was rated bronze, said \\"There is no logic in our result at all\\", and that he had \\"deep concerns about its subjective assessment, its lack of transparency, and with different benchmarks for each institution removing any sense of equity and equality of assessment\\". He also pointed out that exceeding the benchmark by what the TEF considered a significant margin was much easier for institutions with lower benchmarks ‚Äì to beat its benchmark on drop-out rate of 4.5% by the required two percentage points, Southampton would have to have achieved a drop-out rate of only 2.5% ‚Äì leading him to conclude that \\"the benchmarking is fundamentally flawed\\". Analysis of the results and the panel statements by higher education policy thinktank Wonkhe noted that the University of Nottingham, which had a positive flag for highly skilled employment and a negative flag for student satisfaction, was awarded gold, \\"the presumption that a negative flag would rule out Gold hav[ing] been overturned by the panel, perhaps because the TEF guidance also steered the panel away from over-reliance on NSS scores.\\" Similarly, the University of Bristol overcame two negative flags ‚Äì both in NSS-related categories ‚Äì to be awarded silver, but the University of Liverpool, with the same number of negative flags, received bronze, \\"perhaps because one was not in an NSS- derived category\\". Wonkhe further noted that \\"it seems perverse that an institution ‚Äì in Bristol‚Äôs case ‚Äì which was ‚Äònotably‚Äô below benchmark should receive a higher outcome than Liverpool for which the statement is softer\\" and that \\"for institutions with a similar data pattern to Bristol‚Äôs, such as Southampton (with two negative flags in the same categories, but which wasn‚Äôt upgraded to Silver) there could be some well-deserved anger. And if you look to Durham, with its one positive flag, and no negatives, it only has a Silver result when compared to Nottingham‚Äôs Gold.\\" Nick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI), said after the results were released that \\"the fact that some of the results seem surprising suggests it is working\\", as it was designed to be different from other league tables. He added, however, that \\"in this early guise, the TEF is far from a perfect assessment of teaching and learning. While it tells us a lot of useful things, none of them accurately reflects precisely what goes on in lecture halls.\\" In response to some of these points, Chris Husbands, the chair of the TEF panel said that the TEF was not supposed to be a \\"direct measure of teaching\\" but rather \\"a measure based on some of the outcomes of teaching\\", that different outcomes for institutions with similar metrics was to be directed as \\"The TEF is metric-led, not metric determined\\" and that the TEF was \\"a relative, rather than absolute measure of university and college performance\\". He also noted that \\"whilst universities have been impressive at widening participation they have been less assiduous in combatting the impact of disadvantage after students enroll\\", and said that the TEF was with doing as it had \\"raised the profile of teaching\\" and \\"focused attention on things which need to be done better\\". At a conference held in late June, Imperial College London's Vice Provost, Simone Buitendijk, stated that the TEF was a 'godsend' for higher education. She stated: \\"For people like me, a vice-provost, TEF exercises are actually a godsend because what happens is, for the first time, the president and the provost start paying close attention to the quality of teaching...It‚Äôs not a bad thing if there is very close attention being paid to teaching at research-intensive universities.\\" University College London's President, Michael Arthur, suggested that the TEF would bring benefits to universities in the long-run. Eighteen institutions chose to appeal their 2017 ratings, including at least four from the Russell Group. Of eleven institutions that said they were appealing, three were awarded Silver and eight Bronze. Appeals must demonstrate a \\"significant procedural irregularity\\" and cannot challenge the academic judgment of the TEF panels. At least one institution, Swansea University, submitted an intent to appeal but had its case ruled inadmissible. Only the University of East Anglia was re-graded on appeal, moving from silver to gold, and the only other change made was a revision of the statement of findings for Durham University; all other appeals were rejected. In addition, four institutions appealed their eligibility for provisional TEF awards, of which three were successful. Controversy Prior to their publication, the TEF results were expected to be significantly different from the usual rankings of universities in the United Kingdom. The Guardian reported in May 2017 that a number of \\"world-renowned\\" universities were at risk of receiving a bronze rating; particularly London institutions, which normally have lower student satisfaction scores. The Times Higher Education also reported in early June 2017 that the members of the Russell Group (two in London) were in danger of being rated bronze, while post-1992 universities were expected to do well. However, universities also submitted additional written information to the TEF to clarify their institutional context: the head of King's College London said that he hoped this would raise the institution from a bronze to a silver rating, while SOAS noted that the financial cost of living in London meant that the student retention rate in the city was lower than the national average. The director of HEPI, Nick Hillman, said that there might not be any gold-rated universities in London, but that for institutions such as the London School of Economics this would not have a significant impact as \\"[i]ts name and reputation for research excellence will trump any negative press it gets from the TEF\\". Similarly, a \\"Mock TEF\\" carried out by the data analytics team at Times Higher Education in 2016 showed that while Russell Group institutions did well on absolute results, once results were adjusted for student intake only Cambridge, Durham, Birmingham, Exeter and Newcastle (in order of their ranking) were definitely rated as gold, although this did not include any adjustments that may be made for the qualitative submissions from institutions. The link between the TEF and tuition fees has been criticised, with the National Union of Students (NUS) voting in 2016 to boycott the National Student Survey (NSS), the results of which feed into the TEF, unless the link was broken. There were suggestions that the boycott may have backfired as participation levels in the National Student Survey rose nationally with some commentators linking this to the additional publicity from the boycott. However 12 institutions, including Cambridge, Oxford and several other Russell Group universities, were omitted from the NSS results in 2017 due to having less than the required 50% of final year students complete the survey; which is seen as evidence that the boycott was successful in at least some of those institutions. However, with the boycott coming too late to prevent the use of the NSS in the 2017 TEF, it would be necessary to sustain it for a further two years in order to have any effect and the national NUS conference voted in 2017 not to debate a continued boycott or send it to their National Executive Committee. The boycott may also benefit universities such as Bristol for which student satisfaction has traditionally been low. Whether metrics such as student satisfaction and employability data are valid measures of teaching quality has also been questioned. Some top universities threatened to boycott the TEF, fearing that reputational damage might outweigh potential gain. However, in January 2017, just prior to the deadline for signing up, the higher education minister said that \\"almost all\\" universities would, after all, take part, and Times Higher Education was able to confirm that all but five of the English Russell Group universities had committed to participating, with the others not yet decided. ==References== Category:Education in England ","title":"Teaching Excellence Framework"},{"id":"54214151","text":"Asteriscus smithii is a species of flowering plants of the family Asteraceae.

Sch√∂n was born in Nuremberg as the son of painter Max Sch√∂n III. He probably started to learn his trade as an artist in the workshop of his father. He was clearly influenced by the printmaking of Albrecht D√ºrer and may have contributed a few woodcuts to D√ºrer's Triumphal Arch (1515) and Theuerdank (1517). Especially Sch√∂n's way of modelling and placing figures is clearly derived from D√ºrer. After the death of D√ºrer, Sch√∂n also produced a woodcut portrait of the artist. Such woodcut portraits was only one of the genres Sch√∂n worked in. He produced prints of various kind for the popular market and established himself as a popularly demanded artist. Around 1200 illustrations for 116 books in addition to 200 separate woodcuts have been attributed to Sch√∂n. His first known work is a series of woodcuts for a book, from 1513. Until 1524 he mainly illustrated religious books. Together with Hans Springinklee he provided illustrations of rather high quality for the popular prayer book Hortulus Animae in 1515. A Great Rosary form approximately the same time has been described as his finest religious work. From the 1520s he produced several polemical works criticising Catholicism and in favour of Lutheranism. From the mid-1520s and early 1530s these satirical works display an influence from Barthel Beham, Sebald Beham and Georg Pencz. At this time, he also expanded his repertoire from religious to secular subjects, still with a satirical tone. From the 1530s, he switched to Classical themes such as the Judgement of Paris and Laoco√∂n. In 1538 Christoph Zell of Nuremberg published a treatise on proportion in art. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:German wood engravers Category:Artists from Nuremberg Category:1542 deaths Category:1490s births Category:Northern Renaissance ","title":"Erhard Sch√∂n"},{"id":"54214155","text":"Omsukchan Airport is a minor airport built 7 km south of Omsukchan in Magadan Oblast, Russia ==Airlines and DestinationsReferences== Category:Airports in Magadan Oblast ","title":"Omsukchan Airport"},{"id":"54214159","text":"Wings of Eagles (foaled 17 March 2014) is a French-bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. He is best known for his victory in the 2017 Epsom Derby at odds of 40‚Äì1, having never previously won a stakes race. He sustained a career-ending injury when finishing third in the Irish Derby on his only subsequent appearance. == Background == Wings of Eagles is a dark-coated bay colt with a large white star bred in France by Aliette and Gilles Forien. He is from the second crop of the Irish-bred stallion Pour Moi, who won the 2011 Epsom Derby as well as the Group 2 Prix Greffulhe the same year. Pour Moi entered stud at Coolmore Stud in Ireland in 2012 and shuttled intermittently to Windsor Park Stud in New Zealand. For the 2017 breeding season, he was moved to Grange Stud as a Coolmore National Hunt stallion. Pour Moi's other notable runners include Australian Group 1 winner Sacred Elixir and Irish Group 3 winner Only Mine. Wings of Eagles' dam Ysoldina only won one of her 11 races but finished third in the 2005 Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. As of 2017, she has five named foals, four of whom have won. With his Epsom Derby win, Wings of Eagles became his dam's first stakes winner. As a yearling, Wings of Eagles was sold for 220,000 euros to MV Magnier at the Arqana August Yearling Sale. The colt was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of his ownership have changed from race to race: he has sometimes been listed as being the property of Derrick Smith, while on other occasions he has been described as being owned by a partnership of Derrick Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. == Racing career ==  2016: two-year-old season  Wings of Eagles began his racing career in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Galway Races on 29 July in which he was ridden by Seamie Heffernan and started at odds of 7/1 in an eleven-runner field. He showed some reluctance to enter the starting stalls and made no impact in the race, finishing seventh behind the Dermot Weld- trained Lost in Silence. Three weeks later the colt was partnered by Emmet McNamara for a similar event at Killarney Racecourse and started the 5/2 second choice in the betting behind the John Oxx-trained Birds of Prey. After racing in third place Wings of Eagles went to the front a furlong out and won by one and a quarter lengths from the favourite despite showing signs of inexperience (running \\"green\\"). Wings of Eagles was then sent to England for the Listed Zetland Stakes over ten furlongs on 10 October at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Ryan Moore he started at odds of 10/1 and finished fourth behind the filly Coronet. On his final appearance of the season the colt was sent to France and stepped up to Group 1 class for the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud on 30 October. He never looked likely to win and finished ninth of the thirteen runners, seven lengths behind the winner Waldgeist.  2017: three-year-old season  Wings of Eagles began his three-year-old campaign in the Group 3 Chester Vase. In the beginning of the race, he was towards the rear of the field but rallied to finish second as part of a 1-2-3 finish for his trainer Aidan O'Brien. Following the race, O'Brien said he was \\"delighted\\" with Wings of Eagles' performance. \\"We liked him last year and he had a lovely run in France ‚Äì he was back a bit (ninth in the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud) but it was a lovely run... [i]f he was going to be ready for the Derby, he needed to run and he travelled well and settled well.\\" For his next start in the Epsom Derby, Wings of Eagles was paired with jockey Padraig Beggy for the first time. Before the race, Beggy had never ridden in the Epsom Derby. Wings of Eagles was one of six starters for O'Brien in the Derby and was generally overlooked by bettors in favour of his stablemates, going off at odds of 40‚Äì1. Beggy said he was not worried about the long odds. \\"That's my first ride, but when you're riding one for Aidan [O'Brien] you don't worry about the price, they always have a chance.\\" In the Derby, Wings of Eagles was caught back at the start and sat in the back of the field for most of the race. Three furlongs before the finish, Wings of Eagles was third last, but began rapidly closing. Entering the final furlong, it appeared as if his stablemate Cliffs of Moher was going to be the victor, but Wings of Eagles came \\"from the clouds\\" in the final strides to win the Derby by lengths. After the race Beggy said \\"Turning in, I knew I‚Äôd pass the back half of the field ‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt sure about the whole lot, though. Two out I thought I had a chance and a furlong out I thought I‚Äôd win. He's actually won a shade cosily. I‚Äôve won plenty of big handicaps but I could get used to this\\". O'Brien commented \\"I don‚Äôt know what happened there. All I know is that Padraig gave the winner a brilliant ride. He knew all about him. We knew Ryan's horse was a bit of a baby and he just tired in the last 50 yards. We thought Wings Of Eagles would even get a bit further\\". On 1 July Wings of Eagles started 2/1 favourite ahead of Cracksman and Waldgeist for the Irish Derby at the Curragh. Ridden by Ryan Moore he was restrained in the early stages before staying on in the straight and finished third, beaten a neck and a short head by Capri and Cracksman. After the race it was discovered that the colt had sustained a serious leg injury described as a \\"fracture of his left front sesamoid\\". He was immediately retired from racing. ==PedigreeReferencesExternal links== * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart ‚Äì Wings Of Eagles Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Epsom Derby winners Category:Thoroughbred family 14-c Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Racehorses bred in France ","title":"Wings of Eagles (horse)"},{"id":"54214161","text":"Prof William Thomson MD (3 July 1802‚Äì12 May 1852) was a Scottish medical author.

He also is the co-Lead of the Big Data for Education Spoke of the NSF Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub. Role in Development of Educational Data Mining Field Baker was Founding President of the International Educational Data Mining Society, and was one of the first (and current) Associate Editors of the Journal of Educational Data Mining. He served as founding Director of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center DataShop, at one time the world's largest public repository for educational interaction data. Baker taught the MOOC Big Data and Education multiple times, on both the Coursera and edX platforms. He also founded the world's first Masters program in Learning analytics. Research on Automated Detectors Baker developed automated detectors that make inferences in real-time about students' affect and motivational and meta-cognitive behaviors, including the first automated detector of student disengagement, and work to link these constructs to long- term student achievement. These automated detectors have been embedded into several online learning systems used at scale in the United States, including ASSISTments. Baker's research to develop automated detectors of engagement also led to the development of Baker Rodrigo Ocumpaugh Monitoring Protocol (BROMP), a protocol for classroom observation that has been used to study student engagement in a range of settings, including research on traditional classroom practices and informal field education.

Cummings on January 27, 1875, with whom she had two children. ==Career== When Alma Carrie married her husband, he was at the time a compositor in the office of the Northern Sentinel.

Mr. Cummings in 1885 purchased the plant, and until his death two years later, Mrs. Cummings went daily to the office and aided her husband in advancing the prosperity of the new paper. His sudden death left the business in what Cummings aptly termed the \\"usual unsettled condition of a country newspaper office\\". Instead of selling it, Cummings was determined to hold and improve the newspaper at a sacrifice, and she succeeded far beyond her expectations. As both the editor and proprietor, she enlarged the circulation of the paper, increased the volume of news, secured more advertising, and in short made the News and Sentinel a valuable paper for northern New Hampshire. ==References== * Category:1857 births Category:1926 deaths Category:19th- century American newspaper editors Category:19th-century American women writers Category:American women journalists Category:People from Coos County, New Hampshire Category:Women newspaper editors Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century ","title":"Alma Carrie Cummings"},{"id":"54214338","text":"Mary Hayes Houghton (March 26, 1837 ‚Äì November 12, 1921) was an American journalist. ==Early life== Houghton was born Mary Hayes in Penfield, Ohio to Western Reserve pioneer parents from New England on March 26, 1837.

She married John Wesley Houghton, a writer and medical doctor, in 1874. ==Career== From the age of eighteen years, Houghton had written for publications and her connection with the press served to give variety, breadth and finish to her composition.

Among other work, she focused on the compilation of horse pedigrees and heredity problems in horses. She was the assistant editor and manager of Breeder and Sportsman, published in San Francisco, California. ==Personal life and education== Annie Laurie Wilson was born in Louisville, Kentucky on November 5, 1862. She was a daughter of William Henry Wilson, for many years a breeder of trotting horses, residing in Abdallah Park, Cynthiana, Kentucky. Her mother was Miss Annie Eliza Cook, a Pennsylvanian by birth and a Virginian by residence. Wilson attended the public school in Cynthiana, graduating in 1879. In the fall of that year, she entered the freshman class in Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts. During five years, she pursued her studies in that institution, her health not permitting continuous study, although vigorous when not confined to the schoolroom. In January, 1884, she was forced by illness to leave the college. Again in Kentucky, she soon recovered and was eagerly looking forward to the resumption of her studies in the fall of that year. ==Career== In August, 1884, her father was ruined by a fire, in which he lost US$100,000. Wilson decided to support herself and became a teacher at Cynthiana high school. She divided the teaching of the four-year course with the principal. She taught French, German, Latin, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, English and history. While teaching she assisted her father in arranging his papers after the fire. She also helped with his correspondence. In this way, she became a most invaluable and trustworthy confidential clerk to him. \\"Breeder and Sportsman\\" (1888) In 1886, she resigned her position in the Cynthiana school and devoted herself entirely to the work of her father's office. She continued to carry on his work until 1888, when he sent her to California on a business trip. While she was in San Francisco, she formed the acquaintance of the owners of the \\"Breeder and Sportsman,\\" and they offered her a lucrative position as assistant editor and business manager of that journal. She accepted their offer, and for eight months, filled the position, making good use of her varied and intimate knowledge of the trotter and the thoroughbred. Her knowledge of the pedigrees of the famous horses of the United States is full, accurate and remarkable. Among other work, she compiled horse pedigrees, in which statistics play a prominent part. Aside from that, she was a student of the problems of heredity in horses. She was a fluent, direct and luminous writer, and her position as an authority on the horse was unique. ==Personal life== On 19 January 1889, she married Robert Bruce James. Alter their marriage, they lived for a time on their farm near Gilroy, California. They next removed to their ranch near Baker City, Oregon. A son, Oscar William James, was born on 6 November 1889. From early childhood, James was a member of the Episcopal Church. She was a devoted Sunday-school worker. While yet in Wellesley College, she became a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Wherever she lived, she was affiliated, if practicable, with the missionary society. She was one of the charter-members of the Cynthiana Library Association, which founded a valuable public library in that town. In Wellesley College, she was a member of Phi Sigma. ==References== Attribution * * * Bibliography * Category:1862 births Category:Year of death missing Category:American women journalists Category:People from San Francisco Category:Writers from Louisville, Kentucky Category:19th-century American writers Category:19th- century American women writers Category:Wellesley College alumni Category:Kentucky women writers Category:Kentucky women in equestrian field Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century ","title":"Annie Laurie Wilson James"},{"id":"54214404","text":"NCHA Members Hall of Fame was established in 1977 by the National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA) to honor those members who have demonstrated \\"through their own efforts and those of the horses they raise\\" over a period time, their dedication to the sport of cutting, as well as their outstanding and unusual contributions to the NCHA's basic mission in promoting the sport of cutting.

While engaged in school work, she wrote numerous plays, which were first used at entertainments given by her pupils and afterwards published. From the time of her marriage, in 1866, to her husband's death, in 1881, Bierce wrote little for the press. In 1885, she accepted a permanent position in connection with the Cleveland Plain Dealer, contributing stories, sketches and special articles to the Sunday issue. Her stories and sketches of home life and pioneer incidents were especially popular. While most inclined to fiction, she wrote numerous letters of travel. Her descriptions of life and scenery in California, Arizona, Nevada and Utah were unusually entertaining. She gave much time to the investigation of certain phases of the working-woman problem, and has also written special articles on art subjects. She is a member of the Ohio Woman's Press Association and in 1892, was corresponding secretary of that body. In 1891 she was chosen delegate to the International League of Press Clubs, formed in Pittsburgh.

The latter receives the news calmly, but without enthusiasm. His bride Lipa is a poor girl, so joining the Tsybukin family might be seen as a gift of fate, for somebody without a dowry. Anisim arrives three days before the wedding and, as a gift, brings silver rubles, which look brand new. At his own wedding, he quickly gets drunk and starts bragging about a friend he has in the city, Samorodov, whom he refers to as \\"a special person.\\" Not long before leaving for the city, Anisim makes hints about some kind of murky business this friend of his, Samorodov, had involved him into. \\"I will either get rich or perish,\\" he says. On the day of Anisim's departure, Varvara Nikolayevna attempts to put it to him, that while their family is rich, its life is quite horrible, for what they do, is cheat the people in every conceivable way, and are being hated by them. She mentions God, but Anisim is unimpressed. He, the man who claims to have the gift of 'seeing through people,' has never in his life met a true believer. At the station Tsybukin the elder asks his son to stay at home, promising to \\"shower him with gold\\", but the latter says no: he seems to truly enjoy his job in the city, which involves uncovering all sorts of crookery and deception. In fact, even during his short stay in the village, he has inadvertently succeeded in solving to cases of petty theft. Soon after Anisim is gone, it transpires that the silver rubles that had brought with him, are fake. The news arrive that he and a crook named Samorodov are charged with forgery. Tsybukin is shocked and frightened. He tells Aksinya to collect all the fake rubles and throw them into the well. What she does instead, is give them to a team choppers by way of payment. Anisim is jailed, and later sentenced to six years of hard labor in Siberia, despite his father's efforts to provide him with good defense in court. What the latter does, though, is visit a lawyer in the city and makes a will, bequeathing all the family's property to Nikifor, the newly-born Lipa's son. This includes the brick factory that Aksinya had built in partnership with the local merchants, Khrymov brothers, on a plot of Tsybukin's land. Aksinya is outraged with the will. She makes a huge row, then rushes into the house, where Lipa makes some washing, grabs a bucket and pours boiling water upon the child. Next day Nikifor dies in the hospital, and Lipa sheepishly carries the corpse back home. The old Tsybukin is horrified, but he is too scared now of Aksinya. \\"And he was a pretty child... Oh, dear, dear.... You only had the one child, and you did not take care enough of him, you silly girl,\\" is all that he can bring himself to tell the grief-stricken young mother. Aksinya orders Lipa out of the house. The day after the funeral the girl silently returns to her mother's home. Three years pass. Formally Grigory Petrovich is still the head of the family, but it's Aksinya who runs everything at home, at the brick factory and at the station tavern, she's recently built with her friends Khrymins. Varvara still makes loads of jam and enjoys helping the poor. The last time Lipa and her mother see the old Tsybukin, he sits listlessly by the church, while a couple of men beside him argue about whether Aksinya, no matter how respected a figure she is in the village, has any right at all to deny food to her father-in-law, who hasn't eaten now for three days. ==Background and publication== Since 1898, Maxim Gorky, one of Chekhov's great admirers, has been making attempts at drawing him closer to the magazine Zhizn which he himself was closely associated with. \\"In the Ravine\\" was written for it, by way of a response to the editor-in-chief Vladimir Posse's numerous requests. Chekhov first mentioned working upon the novella in his 14 November 1899 letter to his sister Maria. On 19 November he informed Posse: \\"This large novella for Zhizn is in the pipelines, it will be ready perhaps in the second half of December. [...] A horde of characters is in there, lots of hustle and bustle so one has to work hard so as to make this overcrowdedness not that obvious.\\" On 26 December, writing to Mikhail Menshikov, Chekhov described \\"In the Ravine\\" as \\"a story about the factory life, and of how sour it is.\\" In his 21 January 1900 letter to Grigory Rossolimo he called it \\"my final novella concerning the village folk's life.\\" On November the 20th the story was sent to the magazine by its author. \\"In the Ravine\\"' was first published in Zhizns No.1, January 1900 issue. Chekhov was outraged with the quality of proofreading and in an 11 January letter to Posse described it \\"as an orgy of typographic sloppiness.\\" After editing the original text, Chekhov included the story into Volume 12 of the 1903, second edition of his Collected Works, published by Adolf Marks. It was then reproduced in Volume 11 of the posthumous, 1906 third edition.Rodionova, V.M. Commentaries to –í –æ–≤—Ä–∞–≥–µ. The Works by A.P. Chekhov in 12 volumes. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura.

The merchants Khrymins are out there, they are real, their only difference [from my characters] is, they are worse. Their children start drinking vodka from the age of eight, become sexually corrupt in childhood and spread syphilis all through the neighbourhood. ...And there is nothing exceptional about this incident, when Lipa's boy gets murdered by the boiling water, the zemsky doctors come across cases like this quite often. \\"Chekhov Remembered by the Contemporaries // –ê.–ü. –ß–µ—Ö–æ–≤ –≤ –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è—Ö —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞. –ì–æ—Å–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç. 1960. –°—Ç—Ä. 464. - –Ø –æ–ø–∏—Å—ã–≤–∞—é —Ç—É—Ç –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å, –∫–∞–∫–∞—è –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ö –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—è—Ö, —è –µ–µ –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ –∑–Ω–∞—é. –ò –∫—É–ø—Ü—ã –•—Ä—ã–º–∏–Ω—ã –µ—Å—Ç—å –≤ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –¢–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–º–æ–º –¥–µ–ª–µ –æ–Ω–∏ –µ—â–µ —Ö—É–∂–µ. –ò—Ö –¥–µ—Ç–∏ —Å –≤–æ—Å—å–º–∏ –ª–µ—Ç –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞—é—Ç –ø–∏—Ç—å –≤–æ–¥–∫—É –∏ —Å –¥–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∂–µ –ª–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–∑–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω–∏—á–∞—é—Ç; –æ–Ω–∏ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–∑–∏–ª–∏ —Å–∏—Ñ–∏–ª–∏—Å–æ–º –≤—Å—é –æ–∫—Ä—É–≥—É. <...> –ê –∑–Ω–∞–µ—Ç–µ, <...> –≤–æ—Ç —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–∞ –õ–∏–ø—ã –æ–±–≤–∞—Ä–∏–ª–∏ –∫–∏–ø—è—Ç–∫–æ–º, —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ –∏—Å–∫–ª—é—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Å–ª—É—á–∞–π; –∑–µ–º—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤—Ä–∞—á–∏ –Ω–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∫–æ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∞—é—Ç —Ç–∞–∫–∏–µ —Å–ª—É—á–∞–∏.

Some criticized the author for his exceedingly pessimistic outlook, others lauded the story's uncompromising, straightforward message. On 28 December Vladimir Posse wrote to the author: \\"What a merciless, cruel revelation. Nothing theatrical, but the effect is immense, all-pervading and continues to grow long after the story novella had been read.\\" Chekhov received numerous highly emotional letters from his followers, one of whom, Viktor Mirolyubov, the then editor of Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh, wrote on 9 February: \\"Three times I had to stop reading. You know the feeling, when eyes are swelled with tears and something fills the chest as if you are sent flying. [...] It is not your gift that matters, but your heart, your deep feeling... towards all things suffering, for those who perish due to their ignorance, which is so common to this huge ghetto of our life, where only animal instincts win out.\\" Dmitry Ovsyaniko-Kulikovsky considered the story to be the portrayal of the evil that the emergence of the new rural bourgeoisie has brought to life.–û–≤—Å—è–Ω–∏–∫–æ-–ö—É–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –î. –ù. ¬´–í –æ–≤—Ä–∞–≥–µ¬ª, –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç—å –ê.?–ü. –ß–µ—Ö–æ–≤–∞ // –í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã –ø—Å–∏—Ö–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ / –î.?–ù. –û–≤—Å—è–Ω–∏–∫–æ-–ö—É–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π. 2-–µ –∏–∑–¥. –ú., 2008. –°. 248‚Äî256. 1-—è –ø—É–±–ª.: –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∫—É—Ä—å–µ—Ä. 1900. 4 –º–∞—è. - ...C—É—Ç—å –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ ‚Äî –æ—Ç–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω—ã –∑–ª–∞ –∏ –≥—Ä–µ—Ö–∞, —Å–æ–ø—Ä—è–∂—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å –≤–æ–∑–Ω–∏–∫–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –Ω–æ–≤–æ–π —Å–∞–º–æ–±—ã—Ç–Ω–æ–π ¬´–±—É—Ä–∂—É–∞–∑–∏–∏¬ª –∏–∑ –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω.

Arguing with the opponents who had accused Chekhov of being indifferent towards his characters and having no ideas of his own, he wrote: \\"Chekhov has his own worldview, but also something much more than that. He has developed his own vision of life... which he portrays in all of its chaos, with all of its absurdities... from this high vantage point of his own.

Headquartered in La D√©fense, near Paris, the present company was formed in October 1997 by the merging of two others: French Sommer-Allibert and German Tarkett AG. These companies were in turn formed by the combination of various smaller companies in Sweden, Germany and France. The name Tarkett came from a product developed by a Swedish predecessor. ==History== Sommer- Allibert In 1972 Allibert, a company established in 1913 which had developed into plastic products for the automotive and housing industries, and Sommer, a company established in 1880 which specialised in floor and wall coverings, were merged to form Sommer-Allibert. The merging was designed by then-Allibert CEO Bernard Deconinck, which became the leader of Sommer- Allibert. The Nanterre-based company was expanded on the next years, mostly through the acquisition of smaller rivals. The group's automotive business, while a core revenue generator, was mainly centred on France. The floor and wall covering business (especially PVC coverings) expanded through Europe, North America and Asia, including a joint venture with American manufacturer Rubbermaid between 1989 and 1992. In 1989, Deconinck became the chief of a holding (owned by the Deconinck family) with a significant share of Sommer- Allibert and the day-to-day management was transferred to Mark Assa. In the 1990s the company tried to strengthen its automotive division, increasing its business volume with manufacturers like Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, Nissan, Peugeot, and Saab. It also expanded its automotive parts manufacturing facilities in Europe and the United States. Tarkett AG Former Tarkett AG factory in Luxembourg. In 1885, Anders Martensson opened a woodworking facility for furniture in Malm√∂, Sweden. In 1886, it became a company known as Malm√∂ Woodworking Factory (AB Malm√∂ Snickerifabrik). In 1889, investor R.F. Berg took control and introduced wood flooring production, especially parquetry, opening a second facility in Limhamn. In 1907, Berg died and was replaced by Ernst Wehtje. After various setbacks, Wehtje sold off most minor operations of the company and, by the 1920s, refocused it almost exclusively on the wood flooring industry, renaming it as Limhamns Snickerifabrik. In 1925, the company was renamed again as Limhamns Golvindustri AB, under the leadership of Hugo Wehtje. Production was moved from Limhamn to Liljeholmen. In 1938, the company introduced the Lindemann board (a ready-to-use parquet board), which was larger and therefore cheaper to install than parquet's previous small boards. During the following years, the company acquired rivals on the Swedish market, entered into the laminated floorboards business and, in 1946, introduced a plastic replacement for wood covering, known as Tarkett, which became a sales success. Under the next leader, Urban Wehtje, the company started to develop an international network and diversified its production of wood and plastic coverings for building interiors. By the 1960s, the Wehtjes sold a significative percentage of the company's stake and, in 1967, it was listed on the Swedish stock exchange as Tarkett. In 1970, Tarkett was acquired by Svenska T√§ndsticks AB (in turn acquired by Stora in the 1980s) and in 1978 it was merged with carpeting manufacturer Aneplas. The company continued its expansion in Europe and North America. In the late 1980s, then-CEO Lars Wis√©n decided to merge it with German rival Pegulan, and the headquarters were moved from Sweden to Frankenthal, Germany. The new company resulting from the merger was named Tarkett-Pegulan (later Tarkett AG) and Wis√©n became the CEO of the combined operations. In 1994, Stora sold the company to the investment firms CWB Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs Investment Bank. Tarkett former headquarters in Nanterre, France Merging of Sommer-Allibert and Tarkett AG In the late 1990s, Wis√©n met Assa and convinced him of transferring the interior covering division of Sommer-Allibert to Tarkett AG. In exchange, Wis√©n would secure Sommer-Allibert taking control of at least 50% of Tarkett AG shares from the stockholders. The two parts agreed on the deal and it was announced by June 1997. Sommer-Allibert secured over 60% of Tarkett AG (owned since then by Tarkett Sommer AG) in October of that year. The combined operation was listed on both the Paris (through Sommer-Allibert S.A.) and Frankfurt (through Tarkett AG) stock exchanges. Wis√©n continued managing Tarkett Sommer AG‚ÄìSommer-Allibert interior coverings business from Germany, but he was fired in 1998 and the control was passed to the French headquarters. In 2000, Sommer-Allibert divested its automotive division, selling it to Faurecia. Faurecia also acquired the remaining listed shares of Sommer-Allibert, which was delisted. In April 2002, Tarkett-Sommer founded a joint-venture company with the Serbian manufacture company Sintelon, named Takett-Sintelon. In 2003, all company operations started to use the trading name Tarkett. In 2004, the company's Tarkett Sports division formed an alliance with the Canada-based synthetic turf manufacturer FieldTurf before taking control of it in 2005. In 2006, Tarkett AG was wholly acquired by Sommer-Allibert and also delisted from the stock exchange. In 2007, the investment firm KKR became co-owner together with the Deconinck family. In 2008, Sommer-Allibert renamed itself as Tarkett S.A. In 2013, the company was relisted through an IPO, with KKR selling a 25% of its stake while the Deconincks kept over a half of the shares. In 2015, the headquarters were moved from Nanterre to the Tour Initiale in La D√©fense. In June 2013, Fiberfloor products achieved Asthma and Allergy Friendly Certification.

Most famous for her works Imperial Fictions: Europe's Myths of the Orient (1994) and Letter to Christendom (1989), she has also edited and translated works in Arabic and English. She has written for Spare Rib, the International Herald Tribune, The New Statesman, The Guardian, British Vogue, The Independent, Al Quds al Arabi, and Islamica. She has made and contributed to many television and radio programmes for the BBC, on subjects such as literature, music, minority rights, Islamic culture, food, feminism, women‚Äôs rights, painting, and British politics. She has spoken out against islamophobia, defining its historic roots in colonialism. == Education and personal life == Born in 1958 in Damascus, Kabbani's father, Sabah Qabbani, was from a Turkish family originally from Konya, Turkey. Her paternal uncle was the renowned poet Nizar Qabbani. Her maternal family were also from a distinguished Turkish background: Kabbani's mother, Maha, was the niece of Said al-Ghazzi, former Prime Minister of Syria.Moubayed, Sami; Steel & silk: men and women who shaped Syria 1900‚Äì2000, p. 417 In particular, Kabbani was influenced by her maternal grandmother Salwa Ghazzi, suffragette and pioneering feminist from an landowning liberal educated patrician family. Kabbani spent her childhood and young adulthood in New York City, Damascus, Djakarta and Washington DC, where her father held a career as a diplomat and Syrian ambassador. She received her BA degree from Georgetown University, her MA degree from the American University of Beirut, and her Ph.D. in English from Jesus College, Cambridge. Her teachers there were Raymond Williams, Frank Kermode, and Lisa Jardine. As the granddaughter of the Syrian Independence hero Tawfiq Kabbani, and the niece of the Syrian poet Nizar Kabbani, Rana Kabbani had both literature and activism in her blood from a young age. In the way that Nizar Kabbani‚Äôs feminism was inspired by the life and death of his sister, Kabbani's role as a progressive voice against imperialism was inspired by her experiences with growing anti-Muslim sentiment, her historical research and her family‚Äôs contribution. Her great uncle Fawzi Ghazzi wrote the first Syrian Constitution - taught as a document of pioneering liberalism - but was assassinated by agents of French colonialism for not accepting to mention their Mandate in Syria in it. Kabbani married Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish twice - in 1976 and then again in 1978. They lived together in Beirut during the civil war; in Paris, and in Sidi Bou Said in Tunisia. They had no children together and divorced in 1982. In 1985, she married the British journalist Patrick Seale, and they had two children, Alexander and Yasmine. == Writing career == Kabbani began writing at an early age. She worked as an art critic in Paris, and later moved to London to work as a publisher's editor. Her first book, Europe's Myths of Orient: Devise and Rule, was published in 1985. In it, she evaluated orientalist perspectives and narratives, specifically focusing on erotic stereotypes and sexualization of the \\"exotic\\" in literature and painting. The work was translated into Arabic, Dutch, German, Turkish. It is taught at universities, and has never been out of print. After the publication of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, there was a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment, which prompted Kabbani to write Letter to Christendom in 1989. Kabbani's other works include her translations from the Arabic of Mahmoud Darweesh's 'Sand and Other Poems' (1985) and her editorship of The Passionate Nomad: Diaries of Isabelle Eberhardt (1987). Kabbani has written for The Independent, The International Herald Tribune, The New Statesman, British Vogue, The Guardian. In 2011, she wrote about Syria in articles such as \\"Can Syrians Dare to Hope?\\" She is active on Twitter, which has led to controversy, as she is of a radical stance and uses brash language, in order to highlight political and social issues. She has been a fund raiser and a spokesperson for British charities that raise money for Syrian refugees, as well as for autism and mental illness. She is trilingual in Arabic, French and English, and has travelled extensively in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Russia, the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Latin America. == Works == * Europe's Myths of Orient: Devise and Rule, London: Pandora, 1986. , * Women in Muslim society, University College, Cork.

A portrait of Hugh Hope, painted by Sir Henry Raeburn (1756‚Äì1823), currently hangs in The Cleveland Museum of Art. ==Painting by Raeburn== Commissioned by the subject's family, Sir Henry Raeburn painted his portrait of Hugh Hope around 1810. An 1889 Scottish Art Review described the painting as follows: :To our left of the portrait of Sir Thomas Hope hangs another admirable family picture, which indeed may rank as the most accomplished piece of art that Pinkie contains. This is a bust portrait of Hugh Hope (b. 1782, d. 1822), of the East India Company's Service, second son of the ninth Baronet, by his second wife. It is the work of Raeburn, and a masterly example of that painter, showing - in every touch that expresses the fair hair, the blue eyes, the full, fresh- coloured face and in the details of the crisp white ruffles, the dark brown coat, the yellow vest - that easy power of swift, unlaboured, expressive brush-work, for which Sir Henry is unrivalled among Scottish painters. The painting hung for over a hundred years at Pinkie House, the Hope family estate near Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland, until 1928 when it was included in a Sotheby's London art auction. The painting sold at that time for ¬£4,100 to Messrs. Knaedler. The painting was displayed at the Fogg Museum in 1930 as part of an exhibition of eighteenth and early nineteenth century English artists. The painting is currently part of the British Painting and Decorative Art collection of The Cleveland Museum of Art, a gift of Jane Taft Ingalls on the occasion of the Museum's Seventy-Fifth Anniversary in 1995. ==About the subject== Hugh Hope was the second son of Sir Archibald Hope, 9th Baronet Hope of Craighall and his second wife, Elizabeth Patoun, the daughter of John Patoun, Esq. of Inveresk. Sir Archibald purchased the estate of Pinkie House in 1778 from the Marquis of Tweeddale and established it as the seat of Hope baronetcy from its historic location of Craighall in Fife. In 1779 Hope's parents married after Sir Archibald's first wife died. The couple had three sons and a daughter, including Hugh Hope born in on 12 October 1782. The family also included two sons and four daughters from Sir Archibald's first marriage. After attending a foreign university, in 1803 Hugh Hope went to India as a civil servant with the East India Company. In 1819 Hugh Hope married Isabella Gray MacKay, the daughter of √Üneas Mackay, Esq. of Scotston, Aberdeenshire. The couple were parents of one daughter, Helen Hope, and one son, Archibald Hugh Hope, later a General in the Madras Cavalry. Hugh Hope died of a fever in 7 October 1822 in Mirzapur, India.

People who migrate through or from Mexico without legal permission must enter into dealings with smugglers and, often, criminal gangs. Perpetrators may be smugglers or gang members, but can also be government officials, bandits, or other migrants. Sexual assault is sometimes part of the \\"price\\" of smuggling, and some women have reported preparing for it in advance by taking contraception. People without legal permission to migrate are much less likely to report being the victim of a crime or otherwise take actions which may jeopardize their ability to cross the border or remain in the United States. Although data is difficult to collect and analyze, Amnesty International reported in 2010 that the proportion of women and girls who are sexually assaulted over the course of their journey might be as high as 60%. ==Background== People travel from or through Mexico to the United States for several reasons, including poverty, lack of opportunity, and unsafe conditions. Many determined to improve their conditions, but who are unable to migrate with legal permission, find other means to cross the border, often at great risk to themselves. Despite the risks and abuses suffered along the way, many people make several attempts. Amnesty International published a report in 2010 which found that \\"women and children -- particularly unaccompanied children -- are especially vulnerable. They face serious risks of trafficking and sexual assault by criminals, other migrants and corrupt public officials.\\" Other women also migrate to reunite with family members, to search for better economic opportunities through employment, to escape from the domestic violence they are victims of, or the violent conditions and political instability in their homeland. Even though Human rights agreements have established the need for these women to be ensured with security and protection, especially protection from the possible sexual violence they might encounter, the systems that run the US-Mexico border continue to facilitate and enable the constant sexual assault. Falc√≥n, Sylvanna. ‚ÄúNational Security‚Äô and the Violation of Women: Militarized Border Rape at the US-Mexico Border.‚Äù Everyday Women‚Äôs and Gender Studies: Introductory Concepts, by Ann Braithwaite and Catherine Orr, Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, 2017. ==Crimes== Perpetrators of crimes against these migrants are often those involved with people smuggling, known as coyotaje. They may also be bandits, members of criminal gangs, other migrants, or government employees in either Mexico or the U.S. Sexual violence may be considered part of the \\"price\\" women must pay in order to be smuggled over the border. Sexual violence, or threatening to sexually assault someone, may also be one part of a larger criminal plan to extort money from the migrants or their families. Rape of migrants is so common that some women and girls plan for it, taking or bringing contraception, or they may be required to take it by smugglers. A PBS NewsHour story about sexual assault of female migrants interviewed a pharmacist in Altar in Sonora, who said that the town is one of the last stops for someone about to cross the border, and that in the pharmacy she frequently receives the same question: \\"What can I do in case I'm raped, and I don't want to get pregnant.\\" The parts of Mexico near the U.S. border, and the state of Chihuahua and city of Ju√°rez in particular, are some of the most dangerous places for women in general in Mexico, according to a Reuters report on the \\"pandemic\\" of violence against women in Mexico. News reports have stated that in some areas near the border, rapists began hanging their victims' garments from \\"rape trees\\" as trophies, though Jennifer L. Johnson has argued the source for this to be an \\"essay circulating in the conservative blogosphere\\" rather than scholarly work. Militarized Border Rape Sexual assault is sometimes perpetrated by Border Patrol and Immigration authorities, such as Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) officials, as well as Border Patrol agents at the U.S-Mexico border. This practice has been called \\"militarized border rape\\", and has been claimed to be disregarded because the US-Mexico border conflict is not officially defined to be a ‚Äúwar zone‚Äù. These rapes are often planned, and can be of a systematic nature. Immigration authorities who commit the rapes take advantage of their positions of power over undocumented women. One victim of sexual assault by a Border Patrol agent stated, ‚ÄúWe feared the worse. We didn‚Äôt know where he was going to take us. Just the sight of him with a badge and a gun was enough to intimidate anyone.‚Äù The few women who opt to report and prosecute after being sexually assaulted have to face institutions such as the INS, the U.S. government and the U.S. legal system. Sexual Assault of Children in Migrant Shelters The number of children held in migrant shelters has reached almost 15,000. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the national network of more than 100 shelters are at 92% capacity. The largest of these migrant shelters in the country is in Tornillo, Texas with almost 2,800 children living in heated, sand-colored tents that are set up on a patch of desert a few hundred yards from the Rio Grande. Many of the children in these migrant shelters are subjected to sexual abuse. In the last four years alone, there has been over 6,000 complaints of sexual abuse towards children in migrant shelters. From October 2014 to July 2018, the Office of Refugee Resettlement received over 4,500 complaints. The Department of Justice received an additional 1,300 complaints. Over a hundred of these were allegations of sexual abuse by shelter staff members. According to federal documents released on February 26, 2019 by Florida Representative Ted Deutch, unattended migrant children have allegedly experienced sexual assault from the staff in Office of Refugee Resettlement. Most allegations are directed towards other minors and 178 allegations were directed towards staff. Drugs given to children in custody have played a major role towards the increase in sexual assault. Many of these children were medicated with psychotropics without their parents' consent. According to the ongoing lawsuit over the Reno v. Flores settlement, one child cited in the lawsuit reported taking up to nine pills in the morning and another seven in the evening, without knowing what the medication was. Most of the allegations center on Shiloh Residential Treatment Center, in Manvel, Texas. But lawyers in the Flores case, who have access to the medical records of their clients, say the problem is widespread. Children were often threatened and beaten if they refused to take the drugs administered by facility staff. According to court records, a child named Julio Z. said, \\"they told me that if I did not take the medicine I could not leave. That the only way I could get out of Shiloh was if I took the pills.\\" Reno v. Flores Terms of Agreement On July 30, 2018, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee ordered that immigrant children held at Shiloh Treatment Center could no longer be medicated with psychiatric drugs without the consent of a parent or court authorization However records show that immigrant children are still being drugged even after court orders. According to lawyers representing children held at Shiloh Treatment Center, the government is failing to comply with the order. These children reported that the Court's order had little to no impact on the Office of Refugee Resettlement placing children at Shiloh or on the treatment faced there. Recently in March, 2019, a Guatemalan father identified as J.E.B, filed a lawsuit against two nonprofits housing migrant children. He alleges that his 10-year-old son, identified as F.C.B, had been forced to take psychotropic drugs and sexually assaulted while in custody. According to CNN, \\"the lawsuit alleges that both facilities \\"acted with fraud, malice and gross neglect\\" and that staff at both facilities physically assaulted F.C.B.\\" The lawsuit also claims that F.C.B was sexually assaulted by another detained child during his custody at Shiloh. F.C.B was viewed as a liability and both the father and son were quickly deported. ==Estimates== Cases of abuses are rarely reported or prosecuted, and data about these crimes is difficult to acquire or assess. People who do not have legal permission to migrate from or through Mexico do not typically have effective access to the same criminal justice system as legal migrants. In addition to the stigma attached to sexual assaults for anyone, they are unlikely to be willing to take actions which they believe may result in being unable to cross the border or remain across the border. Because many of the offenses involve people in power or connected to organized crime, many women also fear retaliation for speaking up. The newspaper La Jornada surveyed women attempting to migrate while they were in Mexican border cities. 30% said coyotes forced them to have sex as payment. The United Nations estimated that among women crossing without husbands or families, as many as 70% were victims of some form of abuse. At the time of the Amnesty International report, the non-profit estimated \\"as many as six in 10 women and girl migrants experience sexual violence during the journey.\\" It cites a 2006 study of already-detained migrant women in which 23 of 90 reported experiencing violence, with 13 saying the perpetrator was a state official. The researchers involved believed actual numbers were likely higher. According to a report by Splinter News, as many as 80% of women and girls coming to the United States from Central America are sexually assaulted. Michelle Bran√© of the Women's Refugee Commission told Tucson Weekly that \\"nonprofit groups and even the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement ... estimate that the vast majority of women and female children encounter some sort of sexual assault en route to the United States,\\" and that \\"it's become the norm, and in many cases with female children, they just assume that there's been some sort of incident.\\" ==Efforts to provide help or remedy the problems== Amnesty International called for state and non-government organizations to ensure proper medical and psychological services for people who have experienced sexual violence, to design processes that facilitate safe reporting of crimes, and to evaluate the ways in which they find and protect victims. In 2007 the Mexican government passed legislation intending to curb violence against women. According to Reuters, it also \\"established so-called gender violence alerts, a tool to mobilize national, state and local governments to catch perpetrators and reduce murders. Yet in practice the gender alert has never been activated.\\" In an interview with NPR, the sheriff of Santa Cruz County, Arizona, correlated increased sexual assaults at the border with increased border security that pushes migrants into increasingly remote areas, and also points to the increased role of organized crime in smuggling. Violence Against Women Act of 1994 The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 was signed into law by President Clinton in September 13, 1994. The goal of this act, through Section 1154, was to allow battered immigrant women and their children, as well as parents of abused children, the right to ‚Äúself-petition‚Äù for permanent legal residency status, which eliminated the need of the citizen spouse to file such petition.Goldman, M. (1999). The Violence Against Women Act: Meeting its goals in protecting battered immigrant women? Family & Conciliation Courts Review, 37(3), 375‚Äì392. doi:10.1111/j.174-1617.1999.tb01311.x For the next few years the VAWA of 1994 was one way in which the Unites States government aimed to protect immigrant women, but it was not until 2000 when improvements were made to this legislation. The Battered Immigrant Women Protection Act of 2000 (VAWA 2000) was introduced to further protect and provide a different type of immigrant relief for immigrant women who experienced violent crimes, sexual assault and trafficking. This revision to the VAWA of 1994 included the addition of ‚ÄúU‚Äù and ‚ÄúT‚Äù visas, which were introduced by the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.American Immigration Council. (2012). Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Provides Protections for Immigrant Women and Victims of Crime. Washington, DC. Retrieved from: https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/violence-against-women- act-vawa-provides-protections-immigrant-women-and-victims-crime The ‚ÄúU‚Äù visas aim to protect eligible noncitizen victims of violent crimes as long as they demonstrate willingness to ‚Äúassist in the investigation or prosecution of criminal offense ‚Äùby providing them and their eligible family members work authorization permits.\\" The ‚ÄúT‚Äù visas aim to protect noncitizen victims of ‚Äúsevere‚Äù forms of human trafficking. As defined by the VAWA of 2000, severe forms of human trafficking include: ‚Äú(1) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by fraud, force, coercion, or in which the victim is younger than 18 years of age, or (2) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude or slavery.‚Äù These visas provide victims with deferred action, meaning it protects them from removal, and also provides them with a work permit, while those with ‚ÄúBona fide T-visas can benefit from other resources such as cash assistance, food stamps, and job training. ==Mental Health== Many immigrant women who experience sexual assault at the US-Mexico border keep their experiences a secret due to the shame and stigmatization connected to experiencing rape. These women fear the consequences of reporting the crime, thinking their family‚Äôs safety could be jeopardized if they disclose who their attackers are due to the amount of power they potentially possess if connected to the U.S. immigration authorities. Those few women who report their assault have to face scrutiny as their stories are often questioned and discredited by the authorities in charge of investigating such crimes. These are factors that can affect these women‚Äôs mental health as they are retraumatized during the investigation. One victim was forced to file a lawsuit after being accused of lying and threatened by the Office of Inspector General. Faced with the severe trauma of the assault, and the threats of yet another powerful entity against her, the victim attempted suicide. Her mental well-being and capacity to face the re-traumatization of the events as the investigation was conducted, the OIG‚Äôs attempts to protect the accused agent and discredit their story, prompted her to seek suicide as her only way out. Mental health practitioners must understand how their immigration status keeps them in the shadows in order to protect those around them. It is also important to explore the multifaceted process in helping them due to the multiple systems and intersectionalities. It is key to consider the way power dynamics at these different levels can affect the helping process for immigrant women.Silva-Mart√≠nez, E. (2016). ‚ÄúEl silencio‚Äù: Conceptualizations of Latina immigrant survivors of intimate partner violence in the idwest of the United States. Violence Against Women, 22(5), 523‚Äì544. doi:10.1177/1077801215607357 It is emphasized that for the helping process to be able to successful at empowering these women, it is vital to examine the intersections between gender, race, language and immigration; with the aid of adequate intervention with immigrant women. ==References== Category:Sexual violence in North America Category:Illegal immigration to the United States Category:Violence against women in Mexico Category:Violence against women in the United States ","title":"Sexual assault of migrants from Latin America to the United States"},{"id":"54214704","text":"Robin Arora (born January 1985) is a British billionaire businessman and director of the retail chain B&M; Stores. ==Early life== Born in Manchester, Arora is the youngest of three brothers, Simon Arora and Bobby Arora.

The teams have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA as an expansion team in 1970, but the rivalry didn't begin in earnest until the Bulls drafted Michael Jordan with the third overall pick in 1984. After Jordan would go on to the Washington Wizards and eventually retire, the rivalry died down, but when Cleveland picked LeBron James with the first selection in 2003, the rivalry heated up again. However, the Cavaliers had an edge on the Bulls, who would pick Derrick Rose with the first selection in 2008 to turn Chicago from a lottery team, to a future contender. ==The Michael Jordan era== Chicago had the third selection in the 1984 NBA Draft, and selected Michael Jordan out of North Carolina. Jordan won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in 1985 and led the Bulls to a record and the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. As for Cleveland, they had a record, just a single seed under Chicago with the eighth seed. The Cavaliers wouldn't play the Bulls in the playoffs until 1988, which the Bulls would win, 3‚Äì2. The Shot Back when the first round was best- of-5 instead of best-of-7, it was game 5 of the First Round in 1989, on May 7, Jordan hit what is known today as \\"The Shot\\" even with Cleveland sweeping Chicago in the season, it wasn't enough to get by Jordan's shot to win and play the Knicks the next round. Craig Ehlo was the player Jordan shot over to win the game. The Cavaliers wouldn't play the Bulls in the playoffs until 1992, which Chicago would win yet again 4‚Äì2. The Shot is remembered by Cleveland fans as part of the Cleveland sports curse, along with The Drive, The Fumble and Red Right 88. The Bulls would win six NBA championships with Jordan and his partner Scottie Pippen, and 3 of those championships with Dennis Rodman. ==The LeBron James era== The Cleveland Cavaliers were dominated by the Bulls in the rivalry, even with likes of Mark Price, Steve Kerr, Ron Harper and others playing the franchise, Jordan was too much to handle and adding Scottie Pippen made it even more difficult on the Cavaliers, but Jordan would eventually retire and Pippen left Chicago to join the Portland Trail Blazers as a free agent. Cleveland would have the first pick in the 2003 NBA Draft and used that selection to pick LeBron James. The Cavaliers would take over the rivalry with LeBron, Chicago would pick a hometown player with the first pick as well in Derrick Rose. However, Rose had an injury in the playoffs against Philadelphia that would destroy Rose's promising career that won him the MVP in 2011. Both teams met up in the first round in 2010, and Cleveland won their first ever series against Chicago, 4‚Äì1. They would play again in 2015 which Cleveland won again, 4‚Äì2. Bulls' resurgence first overall in 2011. In the summer of 2010, Cavaliers superstar LeBron James became a free agent, and announced on ESPN that he would join the Miami Heat, to join Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade. Cleveland's first season without James was an awful year, finishing with a record of . Meanwhile, the Bulls finished and earned the first seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs; Derrick Rose would win the NBA MVP. However, the Bulls lost in the Eastern Conference finals against the Miami Heat, who would lose in the NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks. Cleveland would draft Duke point guard Kyrie Irving with the first pick and Texas center Tristan Thompson with the fourth pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. Irving would win the Rookie of the Year Award. However, the Cavaliers' best season without James was when they finished in 2013-14.  Return of LeBron James, 2015 semifinals rematch  On July 11, 2014, James announced his return to Cleveland in a letter published to Sports Illustrated. The Cavaliers would select Andrew Wiggins in 2014 first overall, who they would trade along with Anthony Bennett to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Kevin Love. Both the Bulls and Cavaliers would qualify to play in the playoffs. The Cavaliers earned the Eastern Conference's second seed, and the Bulls earned the third seed. The teams would play each other in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. Chicago won game 1 with Derrick Rose scoring 25 points. Cleveland won game 2 with James scoring 33 points. Chicago won game 3, as Derrick Rose made a shot as time expired. Cleveland won game 4, as James also made a shot as time expired. The Cavaliers would also win games 5 and 6 to eliminate the Bulls, and advanced to play in the 2015 NBA Finals, where they would lose to the Golden State Warriors in 6 games. The Cavaliers played Golden State in the NBA Finals again the next year and came back from a 3‚Äì1 series deficit to end the 52-year championship drought in Cleveland.  LeBron leaves again, both teams start rebuilds  During the 2017 NBA Draft the Bulls traded all-star Jimmy Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for the 7th overall pick (used to pick Lauri Markkanen), Zach LaVine and Kris Dunn to start a rebuild for the Bulls. Meanwhile for Cleveland they traded superstar Kyrie Irving (upon request) to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante ≈Ωi≈æiƒá and the Brooklyn Nets first round draft pick, later used for Alabama star Collin Sexton. Towards the beginning of the season there was rumors of LeBron possibly leaving Cleveland again in free agency. The Cavaliers finished with a record of 50‚Äì32 and earned the 4th seed. Meanwhile for Chicago they finished with 27‚Äì55. The Cavaliers beat the fifth seeded Pacers, first seeded Raptors, and second seeded Celtics to make their fourth straight finals appearance. However they would fall to Golden State lead by Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry again, this time getting swept. The 2018 NBA draft came with possible big NBA stars, and Chicago took Wendell Carter Jr. with their 7th pick, and Cleveland took Collin Sexton straight afterwards with the 8th pick.

The museum was established for the purpose of properly preserving and displaying the large quantity of precious archaeological material that had been discovered in the region, especially thanks to the excavations conducted on the many nearby archaeological sites. The museum continued growing over time, and in 1933 the building was rearranged to adapt to the ever-expanding collections. On September 9, 1943 an Allied air strike hit Capua, killing about a thousand people and destroying circa 75% of the buildings in the city, including Palazzo Antignano. Some important pieces of the collections were destroyed. Rebuilding of Palazzo Antignano started in 1945, and in 1956 the museum was reopened. ==Palazzo Antignano== The palace was the home of the prominent Antignano family, which gained prominence under the rule of Alfonso V of Aragon.Cenni storici (in Italian), Comune di Capua.

He was born at Great Budworth, Cheshire and died at Leire, Leicestershire. Stedman was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler, though he did not bowl in first-class cricket. He played in a lot of minor matches for Cheshire and for other amateur teams before arriving in the Cambridge University eleven in 1871; his first university game was for the MCC against the university side, but he subsequently played in three matches for Cambridge, including the 1871 University Match against Oxford University in which he scored 1 not out and 22. The innings of 22 was his highest, and he did not appear in first-class cricket again, though he continued to play in less important matches for the next 20 years, including some games for Leicestershire, not then a first-class side.

Cresap was admitted to field hospitals at least three times for camp sicknesses in 1862, and in early 1863 was a commissary sergenat (which may have involved raiding), but disciplined twice that August, after which he requested permission in November 1863 to raise a company of infantry or cavalry in northwest Virginia, for which he would receive the rank of captain. He may not have succeeded, for he requested permission from Jefferson Davis to raise colored troops and receive a rank above captain.Richard L.

It was rebuilt in modified form in 1939 and it continued to operate until 1956. When it was first built, it was purported to be the fastest roller coaster in the world. ==History== Originally named \\"The Bobs\\", the coaster was best known by its later name of Thunderbolt. It was designed by noted roller coaster engineers Frank Prior and Frederick Church and built by the Traver Engineering Company. The coaster was built approximately out onto Liberty Pier in Long Island Sound and could be easily seen from up and down the beach and from several nearby piers. It was quite popular, financially successful, and is thought to have driven at least one other nearby coaster out of business. In 1936, the Thunderbolt was struck by lightning which caused damage to its mechanical operation. The coaster was closed the remainder of that year but reopened for the 1937 season. In 1938, however, the coaster was destroyed by the Great New England Hurricane. The coaster was rebuilt in 1939 and renamed the Giant Flyer. The ride was somewhat modified in this rebuild, however, and is thought to have become a less exciting ride as a result; it was demolished in 1957. The flagpole from the ride is preserved in the Savin Rock Museum. ==Layout and ride experience== Standing approximately tall and approximately long, Thunderbolt had a fearsome reputation and violent ride experience (as was common for Traver coasters). Its layout was very similar to the Revere Beach Cyclone (another Traver-built coaster). Although exact speeds are not given, several sources suggest that it was the fastest roller coaster in the world when it was built. The ride had several reported fatalities (before 1938), and it was said to shake riders so much that ride operators would collect valuables that fell loose to the pier floor. The ride had a much milder reputation after its rebuild in 1939. ==See also== *Cyclone (Revere Beach) ==References== ","title":"Thunderbolt (Savin Rock)"},{"id":"54215312","text":"Charles Adam Hale (June 5, 1930 ‚Äì September 29, 2008) was a distinguished historian of Mexico, who published major works on nineteenth and early twentieth-century Liberalism in Mexico. ==Life== Hale was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Lloyd and Elizabeth Hale.

He was the vice president for strategic research for the San Antonio Spurs, the lead analyst for Team USA Basketball, and a visiting researcher at the Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social Sciences. He is best known for his sports writing and for pioneering the hexagonal shot chart in basketball analytics, and for being one of the leaders of the recent advanced metrics movement in basketball. He lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife and two young girls. == Education == Goldsberry earned a Ph.D. (2007) from UC-Santa Barbara where he studied Cartography and data visualization. He also holds a master's degree from UCSB, and a bachelor's degree from Penn State (1999), where he majored in Earth Science and Geography. He played basketball recreationally. == Career == Academia Following graduate school, Goldsberry served as an assistant professor of Geography at Michigan State (2007-2013) and a visiting professor at Harvard (2011-2013). At Harvard, Goldsberry designed and co-taught the first Geography course offered since Harvard eliminated Geography in the 1940s. In 2012, Goldsberry presented his first basketball research at MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, which focused on the need for new ‚Äúspatial and visual analytics‚Äù in basketball. Within the paper, Goldsberry introduced a new method for making shot charts using NBA shooting data.  ESPN and Grantland  During his time at ESPN and Grantland (2012-2015), Goldsberry achieved prominence by integrating his shot charts with analytical breakdowns of NBA players. His work appeared regularly at Grantland, FiveThirtyEight, and other ESPN outlets. Among his most cited pieces are The Kobe Assist, The Evolution of King James, and DataBall. Goldsberry leveraged his background as a cartographer to analyze and present spatial basketball data to readers in novel ways. He used his personal experience playing basketball, where his strengths and weaknesses varied depending on his location on the court, and figured that it also applied to other players.  San Antonio Spurs  After Grantland was shut down, Goldsberry joined the San Antonio Spurs as their vice president for strategic research in 2016. He left in 2018 to return to writing. Return to writing In 2019, Goldsberry published SprawlBall: A Visual Tour of the New Era of the NBA, which focuses on the inefficiency of shots in basketball taken between the restricted circle and the three-point line. ==Publications== * ==References== Category:Living people Category:1977 births ","title":"Kirk Goldsberry"},{"id":"54215423","text":"https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/gLAAAOSwC-JbMHVN/s-l300.jpg Desmond R.

A van was deliberately driven into pedestrians on London Bridge, and then crashed on the south bank of the River Thames. Its three occupants then ran to the nearby Borough Market area and began stabbing people in and around restaurants and pubs. They were shot dead by City of London Police officers, and were found to be wearing fake explosive vests. Eight people were killed and 48 were injured, including members of the public and four unarmed police officers who attempted to stop the assailants. The Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack, which took place almost three months after a similar vehicle-ramming and stabbing attack at Westminster Bridge in London. ==Background== In March, five people were killed in a combined vehicle and knife attack at Westminster. In late May, a suicide bomber killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert in 2017 at Manchester Arena. After the Manchester bombing, the UK's terror threat level was raised to \\"critical\\", its highest level, until 27 May, when it was lowered to severe. ==Attack== Map of the course of the attack The attack was carried out using a white Renault Master hired earlier on the same evening in Harold Hill, Havering by Khuram Butt. He had intended to hire a 7.5 tonne lorry, but was refused due to his failure to provide payment details. The attackers were armed with 12-inch (30 cm) kitchen knives with ceramic blades, which they tied to their wrists with leather straps. They also prepared fake explosive belts by wrapping water bottles in grey tape. At 21:58 BST (UTC+1) on Saturday 3 June 2017, the van travelled south across London Bridge, and returned six minutes later, crossing over the bridge northbound, making a U-turn at the northern end and then driving southbound across the bridge. It mounted the pavement three times and hit multiple pedestrians, killing two. Witnesses said the van was travelling at high speed. 999 emergency calls were first recorded at 22:07. The van was later found to contain 13 wine bottles containing flammable liquid with rags stuffed in them along with blow torches. The van crashed on Borough High Street, after crossing the central reservation. The van's tyres were destroyed by the central reservation and the attackers abandoned the vehicle, armed with knives. Then the three attackers ran down the steps to Green Dragon Court, where they killed five people outside and near the Boro Bistro pub. After attacking the Boro Bistro pub, the attackers went back up the steps to Borough High Street and attacked three bystanders. Police tried to fight the attackers, but were stabbed, and Ignacio Echeverr√≠a helped them by striking Redouane and possibly Zaghba with his skateboard. Echeverr√≠a was later killed outside of Lobos Meat and Tapas. Members of the public threw bottles and chairs at the attackers. Witnesses reported that the attackers were shouting \\"This is for Allah\\". People in and around a number of other restaurants and bars along Stoney Street were also attacked. During the attack, an unknown man was spared by Rachid Redouane, but despite many efforts the man was never found. A Romanian baker hit one of the attackers over the head with a crate before giving shelter to 20 people inside a bakery inside Borough Market. One man fought the three attackers with his fists in the Black and Blue steakhouse, shouting \\"Fuck you, I'm Millwall\\", giving members of the public who were in the restaurant the opportunity to run away. He was stabbed eight times in the hands, chest and head. He underwent surgery at St Thomas' Hospital and was taken off the critical list on 4 June. A British Transport Police officer armed with a baton also took on the attackers, receiving multiple stab wounds and temporarily losing sight in his right eye as a consequence. Off duty Metropolitan police constables Liam Jones and Stewart Henderson rendered first aid to seriously injured members of the public before protecting 150+ people inside the Thameside Inn and evacuating them by the Metropolitan marine support unit (MSU) and RNLI Boats to the north shore of the Thames.https://www.politicshome.com/members/article/officers-recognised- in-2019-queens-new-years-honours-list The three attackers were then shot dead by armed officers from the City of London and Metropolitan police services eight minutes after the initial emergency call was made. CCTV footage showed the three attackers in Borough Market running at the armed officers; the attackers were shot dead 20 seconds later. A total of 46 rounds were fired by three City of London and five Metropolitan Police officers. Aftermath Bollards installed on London Bridge to prevent future attacks The Metropolitan Police issued 'Run, Hide, Tell' notices via social media during the attack, and asked for the public to remain calm and vigilant. All buildings within the vicinity of London Bridge were evacuated, and London Bridge, Borough and Bank Underground stations were closed at the request of the police. The mainline railway stations at London Bridge, Waterloo East, Charing Cross and Cannon Street were also closed. The Home Secretary approved the deployment of a military counter terrorist unit from the Special Air Service (SAS). The helicopters carrying the SAS landed on London Bridge to support the Metropolitan Police because of concerns that there might be more attackers at large. The Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit dispatched boats on the River Thames, with assistance from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), to contribute to the evacuation of the area and look for any casualties who might have fallen from the bridge. A stabbing incident took place in Vauxhall at 23:45, causing Vauxhall station to be briefly closed; this was later confirmed to be unrelated to the attack. At 01:45 on 4 June, controlled explosions took place to make safe the attackers' bomb vests, which were found to be fake. An emergency COBR meeting was held on the morning of 4 June. London Bridge mainline railway and Underground stations remained closed throughout 4 June, while Borough tube station reopened that evening. A cordon was established around the scene of the attack. London Bridge station reopened at 05:00 on Monday 5 June. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said that there was a surge of hate crimes and islamophobic incidents following the attack. New security measures were implemented on eight central London bridges following the attack to reduce the likelihood of further vehicle attacks, with concrete barriers installed. The barriers have been criticised by cyclists for causing severe congestion in cycle lanes during peak hours. Borough Market reopened on 14 June. ==Casualties== { class=\\" centre sortable\\" + Victims by nationality !Country !Number -  ! 3 -  ! 2 -  ! 1 -  ! 1 -  ! 1 - - class=\\"sortbottom\\" Total ! 8 } Eight civilians died: one Spaniard, one Briton, two Australians, one Canadian and three French citizens were killed by the attackers, and the three attackers themselves were killed by armed police. 48 people were injured in the attack, including one New Zealander, two Australians, two Germans and four French citizens; of the 48 people admitted to hospital, 21 were initially reported to be in a critical condition. One body was recovered from the Thames near Limehouse several days after the attack. Two of the fatalities were caused in the initial vehicle-ramming attack, while the remaining six were stabbed to death. Four police officers were among those injured in the attack. A British Transport Police officer was stabbed and suffered serious injuries to his head, face and neck. An off-duty Metropolitan Police officer was seriously injured when he was stabbed. Two other Metropolitan Police officers received head and arm injuries. An unidentified bystander received an accidental gunshot wound as a result of the police gunfire, which was \\"not critical\\". ==Attackers== On 4 June the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, said that \\"We are confident about the fact that they were radical Islamic terrorists, the way they were inspired, and we need to find out more about where this radicalisation came from.\\" Amaq News Agency, an online outlet associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), said the attackers were ISIS fighters. On 5 June, two of the attackers were identified as Khuram Shazad Butt and Rachid Redouane. The third of the three attackers, Youssef Zaghba, was identified the following day. Khuram Shazad Butt Butt (born 20 April 1990) was a Pakistan-born British citizen whose family came from Jhelum. He grew up in Britain, living in Plaistow. He had a wife and two children. Neighbours told the BBC that Butt had been reported to police for attempting to radicalise children; he had also expressed disgust at the way women dressed. He was known to police as a \\"heavyweight\\"\\"London ringleader Khuram Butt was intensely investigated\\", cnn.com, 5 June 2017. member of the banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun. A BBC interviewee said he had a verbal confrontation with Butt in 2013 on the day after another Al- Muhajiroun follower had murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby. Butt was part of an al- Muhajiroun campaign in 2015 to intimidate Muslims who planned to vote in the UK general elections of that year, on the basis that it was forbidden in Islam. He was known for holding extreme views, having been barred from two local mosques. He appeared in a 2016 Channel 4 Television documentary The Jihadis Next Door, which showed him arguing with police over the unfurling of an ISIL black flag in Regent's Park.telegraph.co.uk: \\"We must use the full force of the law to tackle vile Jihadists like Khuram Butt\\", telegraph.co.uk, 5 June 2017. According to a friend, he had been radicalised by the YouTube videos of the American Muslim hate preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril. Butt was known to have taken drugs before he became radicalised. After radicalisation, Butt started to stop his neighbours on the street and ask them whether they had been to the mosque. Butt had worked for a man accused of training Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the July 2005 London bombing. The police and MI5 knew of Butt and he was investigated in 2015. The investigation was later \\"moved into the lower echelons\\", and his file was classed low priority. Butt sometimes manned the desk of the Ummah Fitness Centre gym, where he prayed regularly. CCTV footage has been released of Butt, Redouane and Zaghba meeting outside the gym days before the attack. A senior figure at a local mosque had reported the gym to police. The New York Times said that Butt and his brother were part of the UK government's Prevent programme, which aims to stop people from becoming terrorists, and which reports suspected radicals to police programmes. At the time of the attack he was on police bail following an allegation of fraud, though the police had intended to take no further action due to a lack of evidence. He had previously been cautioned by police for fraud in 2008 and common assault in 2010. Rachid Redouane Redouane (born 31 July 1986) was a failed asylum seeker in the UK, whose application was denied in 2009, and not previously known to police. He had claimed to be either Moroccan or Libyan. Redouane worked as a pastry chef and in 2012 he married an Irish woman in a ceremony in Ireland. He beat and bullied his wife. She eventually divorced him after he tried to force his extremist beliefs on her. He used to drink alcohol. He lived variously in Rathmines, a suburb of Dublin, also in Morocco and the UK. According to his wife, Redouane was most likely radicalised in Morocco. Later the couple stayed in the UK on an EU residency card where they had a daughter in 2015. The couple separated in 2016. At the time of the attack, he was living in Dagenham, East London. Youssef Zaghba Zaghba (born 1995 in Fez, Morocco) was at the time of the attack living in east London where he worked in a fast food outlet. He also worked at an Islamic television channel in London. Zaghba was born to a Moroccan Muslim father and an Italian Catholic Christian mother who had converted to Islam when she had married. Zaghba had dual Moroccan and Italian nationality. When his parents divorced, he went to Italy with his mother. In 2016, Zaghba was stopped at Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport by Italian officers who found ISIS-related materials on his mobile phone; he was stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. Italian authorities said Zaghba was monitored continuously while in Italy and that the UK was informed about him. Giuseppe Amato, an Italian prosecutor, said \\"We did our best. We could just monitor and surveil ... [Zaghba] and send a note to British authorities, that's all we could do and we did it. Since he moved to London, he came back to Italy once in a while for a total of 10 days. And during those 10 days we never let him out of our sight.\\" According to The New York Times, the Italian branch of Al-Muhajiroun had introduced Butt to Zaghba. ==Investigation== On the morning of 4 June, police made 12 arrests following raids in flats in the Barking area of east London, where one of the attackers lived; controlled explosions were carried out during the raids. Those held included five males aged between 27 and 55, arrested at one address in Barking, and six females aged between 19 and 60, arrested at a separate Barking address. One of the arrested males was subsequently released without charge. Four properties were being searched, including two in Newham in addition to the two in Barking. Further raids and arrests were made at properties in Newham and Barking early on the morning of 5 June. On 6 June, a man was arrested in Barking, and another in Ilford the following day. By 16 June, all those arrested had been released without charge. ==Inquest== On 7 May 2019, an inquest into the deaths of the victims opened at the Old Bailey in London. Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC and people related to the dead gave accounts of what happened and who they had lost. The inquest concluded on 16 July 2019 that all three attackers had been lawfully killed. ==Reactions== Floral tributes left on London Bridge following the attack The Prime Minister, Theresa May, returned to Downing Street from campaigning for the upcoming snap general election. May, on the morning after the attack, said the incident was being treated as terrorism, and that the recent terror attacks in the UK are \\"bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism\\" which \\"is a perversion of Islam\\". As part of a four-point plan to tackle terrorism, she called for tighter internet regulations to \\"deprive the extremists of their safe spaces online\\", saying that technology firms were not currently doing enough. May's stance on the role of the internet and social media in enabling radicalisation was criticised by the Open Rights Group and the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence. May was also criticised for using the speech to detail policy measures to respond to the terror threat, which some saw as contrary to her pledge to pause campaigning out of respect for the victims. May said a review would be carried out by the police and intelligence agencies to establish whether the attack could have been prevented, and on 28 June Home Secretary Amber Rudd commissioned David Anderson QC to provide independent assurance of the review work. The Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, the Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron and the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan all wrote on Twitter that their thoughts were with those affected and expressed thanks to the emergency services. Khan described the attack as \\"deliberate and cowardly\\" and condemned it \\"in the strongest possible terms\\". He later said that \\"the city remains one of the safest in the world\\" and there was \\"no reason to be alarmed\\" over the increased police presence around the city. Muslim families at London Bridge days after the 2017 attack.The Conservative Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party suspended national election campaigning for a day after the attack. The UK Independence Party chose not to suspend its campaigning; leader Paul Nuttall said it was \\"what the extremists would want\\". May confirmed that the general election would go ahead as scheduled on 8 June. The BBC cancelled or postponed a number of political programmes due to air on 4 June. Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, also condemned the attack. More than 130 imams condemned the attackers, refused them Islamic burials, and said in a statement that the terrorists did not represent Islam. Condolences, expressions of shock, support, solidarity and sympathy were offered by many national governments and supranational bodies. Three George Medals were awarded in relation to the attacks: Ignacio Echeverr√≠a (posthumous), a civilian, and two to police officers, PC Charlie Guenigault of the Metropolitan Police and PC Wayne Marques of the British Transport Police. All three were seriously injured as they directly confronted the terrorists and attempted to save others.

He became the director of English production at the Board in 1966, then returned to active directing in 1968. He was responsible for several of the early NFB dramas, the Perspective series, 23 Skidoo and The Little Fellow from Gambo. He directed the Academy Award-nominated Herring Hunt and oversaw the production of nearly 200 films, including Don Owen's High Steel and Notes for a Film About Donna and Gail, and Bill Mason's Paddle to the Sea, the popular Oscar-nominated live-action short. In 1970, his profile of Newfoundland Prime Minister Joey Smallwood, A Little Fellow from Gambo, earned him a best director award at the Canadian Film Awards. ==Perspective series== A National Film Board series of 30-minute dramas produced by Biggs (paralleled by a similar series in French known as Passe-partout) from 1956 to 1958. The emphasis was on documentary dramas in which social themes such as alcoholism, drug addition, adolescence, the elderly, racial problems etc. predominated. One such film, Monkey on the Back, directed by Biggs, was a bleak, tragic story of man's struggle to free himself, unsuccessfully, from drug addiction. Similar to Robert Anderson's Drug Addict (1948), which had been banned in the U.S., it was the type of film that caused the Board to reconsider its role in producing socially relevant films. There was an unwritten policy and priority to shift away from social realism to the art of film. In his authoritative Film Companion, Canadian film historian Peter Morris wrote this about the series that contained elements, which later become common in direct cinema. \\"Perhaps the most original aspect of the films was their method of production: a light, quiet-running Auricon camera mounted on a chest harness, used on location and combined with double-system sound recording using the Sprocketape recorder. This technology sharply reduced production costs and shooting time. The style that resulted is apparent in most of the films, mostly clearly in Joe and Roxy (1957) and Night Children (1956), and clearly anticipates the later application of direct cinema to fiction. The series initially attracted a large audience, but the didactic tone of many of the film and the problems inherent in condensing high-intensity dramas into 30 minutes drove viewers away. The series was cancelled in the spring of 1958. The Candid Eye series was developed a least partially in reaction to the dramatic format of Perspective, an approach the NFB believed had lost touch with the real world.\\" ==Films include== *The Oyster Man, 1951 (co-directed with Jean Palardy) *The Son, 1952 (directed and wrote) *Herring Hunt, 1953 (directed) *The Shepherd, 1956 (produced and directed) *Monkey on the Back, 1956 (produced, directed and edited) *Night Children, 1956 (produced) *Joe and Roxy, 1957 (produced) *Fire in Town, 1958 (directed) *William Lyon MacKenzie: A Friend to His Country, 1961 (produced and directed) *23 Skidoo, 1964 (directed) *John Hirsch: A Portrait of a Man and a Theatre, 1965 (produced) *Buster Keaton Rides Again, 1965 (produced) *The Railrodder, 1965 (produced) *High Steel, 1965 (produced) *Paddle to the Sea, 1966 (produced) *Notes for a Film About Donna and Gail, 1966 (produced) *A Little Fellow from Gambo: The Joey Smallwood Story, 1970 (produced, directed and wrote) ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:1920 births Category:1972 deaths Category:National Film Board of Canada people Category:Film directors from Ontario Category:Canadian film producers Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:People from Scugog ","title":"Julian Biggs"},{"id":"54215559","text":"Reuben Ngata (born 31 October 1936) is a former New Zealand Paralympic athlete of Ngati Porou descent.

With the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the drill hall became the home of the 1st Northumbrian Brigade, Royal Field Artillery as well as two of its three batteries (the third was at Elswick Ordnance Works in Dunn Street). The brigade was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 and, after being deployed to France and being re-designated 250 Brigade in May 1916, it saw action at the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette in September 1916, the Battle of Morval also in September 1916 and the Battle of Le Transloy in October 1916.

His parents came from the Pontotoc area of Mississippi, not far from Tupelo, from where Elvis Presley came. West was one of two sons and five daughters. Both West and Elvis grew up in different lower income projects in Memphis, and though near, never actually met in childhood. Before and after Elvis' passing, West wrote several books, and made public appearances at Elvis related conventions and gatherings, speaking out on his time working for Presley and their relationship. ==Working with Elvis== West's cousin Red West worked for Elvis as a friend, driver and bodyguard from 1955 onwards. West met Elvis in 1958 at a roller skating rink. After discharge from the U.S. Air Force as an Airman Third Class (E-2), West, working as a washer and dryer repairman, went to work for Elvis as a bodyguard from 1960 to 1976. In December 1970, West married his wife Judy Jordan, an actress and an original 'Away We Go' girl from The Jackie Gleason Show, with Elvis as best man, with Priscilla Presley, then wife of Elvis, serving as Matron of Honor. In July 1976, Presley bodyguards Sonny West, Red West, Robert West and David Hebler were fired by Elvis' father Vernon Presley, in what was described as a cost-cutting measure, but was rumored to have been caused by concern over Presley's increased intake and dependence on various prescription drugs, and lawsuits against Presley due to security techniques which caused injury to fans. ==Meeting with Richard Nixon== On December 21, 1970, Presley, West, and Elvis insider Jerry Schilling were photographed in the White House with Richard Nixon by Ollie Atkins. ==Elvis: What Happened? Tell all book== In July 1977, the bodyguards, led by West, called a press conference coinciding with the release of their tell all book with tabloid writer Steve Dunleavy entitled Elvis: What Happened? which claimed to be more of a friendly reminder to change his drug dependent behavior, rather than a money making exercise. The book sold over three million copies. Presley died only two weeks after the publication of the memoir, contributing to public interest, and sales of the book. Film clips from the original press conference promoting the book still exist. ==As an actor == West appeared in several Elvis movies as an extra. During the time West spent in Hollywood with Elvis, West stuck close to the directors and various other members of the movie crews, and learned about the production end of movie making. In the 1960s, West had a few acting roles under his belt, along with stunt work.

West hosted a local Memphis radio show on WMRO. In his later years, West produced and starred in a show called, ‚ÄúMemories of Elvis: An Evening with Sonny West‚Äù. ==Illness and death== In April 2012, West was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer of the tonsils, which was successfully treated, but later recurred.

He was hospitalized in October 2016, and remained there until he died eight months later on May 24, 2017, less than two months shy of his 79th birthday. In a hospital interview in late 2016, West told Inside Edition ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to leave my family behind, penniless, leave them with nothing. I just want to be back to where I can carry the love I need to carry.‚Äù Before his last diagnosis, he said, ‚ÄúI felt good, ambitious, going around the world doing (my Elvis tribute) shows, entertaining people, standing up for hours [with] all my energy and everything.‚Äù Medical bills, both his own and due to his wife's breast cancer, forced West to sell off some of his Elvis memorabilia as partial payment, but he and his wife still faced foreclosure and eviction from their home in Hendersonville, Tennessee.http://hendersonvillestandard.com/delbert-b-sonny- west-jr--cms-11676 His son founded a Gofundme page to try to help.

Only one, in military configuration, was built and was sometimes known as the France-Aviation Denhaut. ==Design and development== Denhaut Hy.479 photo from L'A√©rophile December,1926 The Hy.479 was an unequal span, single bay biplane with thick section wings. The longer upper wing was in three parts, with a short, almost rectangular centre section and trapezoidal outer panels. The lower wings were attached to the upper hull and were swept with constant chord, then straight- tapered to the squared tips. The top surface of the upper wing was flat but deceasing thickness provided some dihedral; the lower wing carried dihedral on both surfaces. Ailerons, which covered over half the span. were only fitted on the upper wing. Structurally the wings were wooden, with two spars and plywood-covered leading edges; elsewhere the covering was fabric. The wings were braced together on each side by a pair of parallel, outward-leaning interplane struts. Below these, steeply angled stabilizing floats were attached close to the lower wing underside with short struts. To minimise hangar space, the outer wings could be folded back alongside the hull. The Hy.479 was powered by a pair of Gnome & Rh√¥ne 9A Jupiter nine-cylinder radial engines strut-mounted midway between the wings immediately below the end of the upper centre-section, placing them as close together as the propellers allowed. The engines were uncowled, though their accessories were placed behind them under conical fairings. Its hull was deep, with steep sides and a shallow V-section bottom without steps. It was compartmented, double- and triple-planked below the waterline and plywood covered above. The pilots sat side by side in an open cockpit ahead of the propellers, protected by a generous windscreen. In the military configured first and only prototype there were machine gunners positions in the rounded nose and midway between the wings and tail. The Denhaut had a large, triangular fin, with a deep, curved, balanced rudder. Its delta plan tailplane was mounted halfway up the fin, braced on each side with a single strut to the lower hull, and carried balanced elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement. The Hy.479 could be easily configured as an amphibian, with mainwheels on V-struts hinged on extensions of the engine struts and inner V-struts braced to the lower hull. With the inner struts disconnected, the wheels could be raised outwards to the wing underside. The date of the Hy.479's first flight is not known but trials were under way in early December 1926, flown from √âtang de Berre. Flight characteristics, including single-engined performance, were reported to be good; allowing the aircraft to go to Saint Rapha√´l for official tests in January 1927. After a minor accident when a crane cable failed, development was stopped as Denhaut withdrew from the project, possibly due to Aeronavale's preference for tandem engines (reducing problems of asymmetric thrust during engine failure / differential throttle settings). The proposed passenger version with an internal cabin was not built. ==Specifications (Hy.479) == France-Aviation Denhaut 3-view drawing from Les Ailes December 9, 1926 ==References== Category:Flying boats Category:1920s French military aircraft ","title":"Denhaut Hy.479"},{"id":"54215763","text":"Chipotle‚ÄìFirst Solar Development Team was an American UCI Continental cycling team that existed from 2006 to 2012.

The car was in development for a total of seven years before its official production in 2016. ==cB7== The vehicle was unveiled in the 2014 Montreal International Auto Show. Prices will start at around US$275,000. Development Before its production start, the car was in development for seven years. The car was designed by Canadian racing driver Antoine Bessette. The car started with a design blueprint to confirm its design. A year later in 2009, the car's main frame was built, which had a lightweight tubular frame, and was wrapped with composite and carbon fiber elements. The first cB7 prototype was being built in 2010, and was completed in 2011. Testing was being done in the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve track. A second prototype was built, with a larger engine and body. In 2014, an unveiling of the prototype was made in the Montreal International Auto Show. This was the same year the development of the car was in near completion. The car was officially sold in 2016. Specifications The car uses one of three optional 7.0-liter naturally-aspirated cast aluminum V8 engines. The first boasts and , the second puts out and , and the third option produces and . The car's top speed and performance figures are dependent on the option. The engine compression ratio is 10.7:1 and the bore and stroke is 103.25 x 92mm. This power is delivered by either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed sequential paddle-shift transmission. The body uses composites and carbon fiber. The car's tire sizes are 245/40R18 up front and 315/30R18 in the rear. These tires shoe the aluminum alloy standard wheels. The brakes are regular steel discs, which are both front and rear but are 6-piston up front and 4-piston in the rear. These brake discs have optional carbon fiber. Design The exterior is a long nose kind of layout, with a design that slightly resembles that of lightweight track cars. The car has the inclusion of LED lighting. The car's carbon fiber diffuser gives the car more aggression. The interior design shows the lightweight track design much more boldly, with the inclusion of exposed carbon fiber and racing components. It still keeps a road car design with some leather installations.

PhBL includes both topical learning (also known as topic-based learning or instruction), where the phenomenon studied is a specific topic, event, or fact, and thematic learning (also known as theme-based learning or instruction), where the phenomenon studied is a concept or idea. PhBL emerged as a response to the idea that traditional, subject-based learning is outdated and removed from the real-world and does not offer the optimum approach to development of 21st century skills. It has been used in a wide variety of higher educational institutions and more recently in grade schools.Phenomenal Education. Retrieved 2017-06-03 ==Features== PhBL forges connections across content and subject areas within the limits of the particular focus. Differentiated Instruction ‚Äì Thematic vs. Topical Instruction, Richland School District webpage . Retrieved 2017-06-02 It can be a used as part of teacher- centered passive learning although in practice it is used more in student- centered active learning environments, including inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, or project-based learning. An example of topical learning might be studying a phenomenon or topic (such as a geographical feature, historical event, or notable person) instead of isolated subjects (such as geography, history, or literature). In the traditional subject-based approach of most Western learning environments, the learner would spend a set amount of time studying each subject; with topical learning, the trend is to spend a greater amount of time focused on the broader topic.Nick Nedeljkovic: Phenomenon-Based Learning, October 24, 2016 During this topical study, specific knowledge or information from the individual subjects would normally be introduced in a relevant context instead of in isolation or the abstract.Bashaer Al Kilani: What is Phenomenon-Based Learning?, Teach Middle East, April 21, 2016. Retrieved 2017-06-03 Topical learning is most frequently applied as a learner-centered approach, where the student, not the teacher, selects the topic or phenomenon to be studied. This is thought to be more successful at engaging students and providing deeper learning as it will be more likely to align with their own interests and goals. This aspect has also been recognized as facilitating the integration of education as well as a method to enable students to obtain core knowledge and skills across a range of subjects, it has been considered effective in promoting enthusiasm and greater organization, communication, and evaluation. Similar to project-based learning, it also provides opportunities to explore a topic or concept in detail. With deeper knowledge students develop their own ideas, awareness, and emotions about the topic. While not absolute, PhBL has several main features: Inquiry-based The PhBL approach supports learning in accordance with inquiry learning, problem-based learning, and project and portfolio learning in formal educational as well as in the workplace. It begins with studying and developing an understanding of the phenomenon through inquiry. A problem-based learning approach can then be used to discover answers and develop conclusions about the topic. Anchored in the real world The phenomenon-based approach is a form of anchored learning, although it is not necessarily linked to technology. The questions asked and items studied are anchored in real- world phenomena, and the skills that are developed and information learned can be applied across disciplines and beyond the learning environments in real- world situations. Contextual PhBL provides a process where new information is applied to the phenomenon or problem. This context demonstrates to the learner immediate utility value of the concepts and information being studied. Application and use of this information during the learning situation is very important for retention. Information that is absorbed only through listening or reading, or in the abstract (such as formulas and theories) without clear and obvious application to the learning at hand, or to real- world application, often remain in short-term memory and are not internalized. Authenticity PhBL can demonstrate the authenticity of learning, a key requirement for deeper learning. In a PhBL environment, cognitive processes correspond to those in the actual/real-world situations where the learned subject matter or skills are used. The intent is to bring genuine practices and processes into learning situations to allow participation in the \\"expert culture\\" of the area and practices being studied. Constructivism PhBL is a constructivist form of learning, in which learners are seen as active knowledge builders and information is seen as being constructed as a result of problem-solving. Information and skills are constructed out of ‚Äòlittle pieces‚Äô into a whole relevant to the situation at the time. When phenomenon based learning occurs in a collaborative setting (the learners work in teams, for example), it supports the socio-constructivist and sociocultural learning theories, in which information is not seen only as an internal element of an individual; instead, information is seen as being formed in a social context. Central issues in the sociocultural learning theories include cultural artifacts (e.g. systems of symbols such as language, mathematical calculation rules and different kinds of thinking tools) ‚Äì not every learner needs to reinvent the wheel, they can use the information and tools transmitted by cultures. ==Topical learning== Topical learning (TL) has been used for decades to study a specific topic such as a geographical feature, historical event, legal case, medical condition, or notable person, each of which may cover more than one academic subject such as geography, history, law, or medicine. TL forges connections across content areas within the limits of the particular topic. As a cross-disciplinary application, it has been used as a means of assisting foreign language learners to use the topic as a means to learn the foreign language. There are several benefits of topic-based learning. When students focus on learning a topic, the specific subject, such as a foreign language, becomes an important tool or medium to understand the topic, thus providing a meaningful way for learners to use and learn the subject (or language). ==Thematic learning== Thematic learning is used to study a macro theme, such as a broad concept or large and integrated system (political system, ecosystem, growth, etc.). In the United States, it is used to study concepts identified in the Core Curriculum Content Standards. As with topical learning, it forges connections across content areas within the limits of the particular topic. Proponents state that by studying the broad concepts that connect what would otherwise be isolated subject areas, learners can develop skills and insights for future learning and the workplace.Thematic Instruction, Funderstanding. April 14, 2011.

Finnish schools have used PhBL for several decades, but it was not previously mandatory.

In 1925, following the founding of the Society of the Holy Cross by the Rt Revd Mark Trollope, 3rd Bishop of Korea, she was appointed Mother Superior of the order. ==Early life== According to her birth certificate,[Birth certificate. https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/birth_returns/births_1883/02720/2000776.pdf] Clare Emma Whitty was born on 30 May 1883 in Fenloe, County Clare, Ireland. Some secondary sources report that she was born in Enniskerry, County Wicklow, Ireland. Her father, Richard Laurence Whitty, a qualified medical doctor and land agent, was born in 1844 in Rathvilly, County Carlow to a clerical family. He was the youngest of four children, to Reverend William Whitty, curate of Rathvilly, and his wife Gertrude (n√©e Langley). Her mother was Jane Alicia Whitty (n√©e Hickman), who was from a family of County Clare landowners. Through her mother, she was the great granddaughter of Edward Stopford, Bishop of Meath, making her a distant cousin of Irish historian, Alice Stopford Green. She had one sibling, Sophia Angel St. John Whitty, who was named after their maternal grandmother. In the 1891 census, the family is recorded to have moved to Loughton, Essex, England. In the 1911 census, Whitty is recorded as an \\"elementary teacher\\". In the 1910s she received training in art in Paris, which she became a fluent speaker of French. ==Sisterhood== In 1912, Whitty joined the Anglican Community of St Peter, then based in Kilburn, London and took her vows as a sister in 1915, taking the name, Mary Clare. Just before the outbreak of the Great War The Rev'd Mark Trollope who had been vicar of St Augustine's Church in Kilburn, was appointed the third Anglican Bishop of Korea, and requestedfor Whitty (then Sister Mary Clare) to aid him in the founding of a society of Korean sisters in Seoul. She eventually reached Korea in 1923, following the difficulties places upon travel following the war, she undertook Korean language studies.

He became the subject of widespread media attention following his time with Al-Nasr, a Libyan team owned by the family of Muammar Gaddafi. Owumi plays for the Worthing Thunder of the National Basketball League Division 1 (NBL 1) in England. Originally from Lagos, Nigeria, Owumi moved to Boston as a child. He played football and basketball from an early age and at the college level. He focused on basketball at the Community College of Rhode Island and was named a National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) All-American. Owumi played his final two seasons at Alcorn State in Lorman, Mississippi, but he failed to attract any attention from National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. As a result, in 2009, he moved to France and played his rookie season with AL Roche-la-Moli√®re where he was named most valuable player of the league. After a brief spell in the Premier Basketball League (PBL) with the Manchester Millrats in 2010, he signed with KK Lirija in Macedonia. He left the team at the end of the season after facing unpleasant playing conditions and racist abuse, and accepted a lucrative offer with Al-Nasr, joining the Libyan team shortly before the outbreak of the Libyan Civil War in 2011. When conflict erupted, Owumi was trapped in Mutassim Gaddafi's apartment without food or electricity for several days in the midst of the violence, before he was able to escape to Egypt, where he was arrested and detained. After his release, he played for El-Olympi, an Egyptian team, helping them win a league championship. He then moved to England and began playing in the BBL, joining the Worcester Wolves, with whom he won a league title, before moving to the London Lions and then the Surrey Scorchers. Owumi has written three books, including Qaddafi's Point Guard, an autobiography focusing on his time in Libya. ==Early life and high school== Owumi was born on May 4, 1984, in Lagos, Nigeria to Claudia and Joseph Owumi. His father came from a wealthy Nigerian Catholic family, while his mother, Claudia, grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The two met while attending college in the Boston area. Claudia later worked as a teacher at various schools in Lagos and then became a principal.Owumi & Paisner (2013), pp. 16‚Äì18. His family lived in a village located just outside Lagos. His father and his brother, also named Joseph, were village chiefs, while Alex was a prince. His rank earned him the title Prince Alexander and entitled him to his own military guard detail.Owumi & Paisner (2013), pp. 7, 15. The language spoken in the village was Urhobo; Owumi was not fluent in English in his early years.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 17. By the age of eight, Owumi had begun playing both basketball and football. He played the former sport with a soccer ball and a milk crate nailed to a tree. The sport was becoming increasingly popular in Nigeria because of the success of National Basketball Association (NBA) center Hakeem Olajuwon, and Owumi followed the NBA.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 9. When he was 12, his family moved to England, where they lived for three years. They then settled in Boston after his father joined the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health as a financial administrator. In sixth grade, Owumi enrolled at the local Tobin School. He attended Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, Boston, where he played basketball and football.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 45. Owumi later estimated that he lost, at most, nine high school basketball games. While attending Burke in 2003, he won , given to the top male and female student-athletes in Boston. Owumi was also a part of the basketball team, Boston Amateur Athletic Club, while in high school.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 44. ==College career== On March 18, 2003, Owumi signed a letter of intent to play college football for the Georgetown Hoyas football team under head coach Bob Benson. He joined the team on a scholarship, uncertain of his future in basketball.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 61. Although Owumi had initially wanted to play the quarterback's position, his coaches wanted him to play wide receiver because of his athletic abilities.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 62. He later moved to play safety, and eventually became the Hoyas' third-string quarterback, but he did not appear in a regular season game at the position. Following football season, Owumi often practiced with the school's basketball team but never joined. He decided to transfer out of Georgetown to focus on academics and basketball, retaining his four years of college basketball eligibility.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 70. Encouraged by their fairly successful basketball program and facilities, Owumi began attending the in the next year. He joined the team, which competed in the NJCAA, as a co-captain under coach Dave Chevalier with hopes of playing for an NCAA Division I program in the future. Owumi brought CCRI to its first appearance in four years by defeating Lackawanna College on March 13, 2005. However, the team did not bring one of its best defenders to the tournament because he had forgotten his airport ID at home, and they were eventually defeated.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 73. Owumi earned second-team NJCAA All- American honors, becoming the sixth player in the school's history to do so. In his second basketball season, Owumi joined Monroe Community College (Monroe CC) in Rochester, New York because he wanted to play for head coach Jerry Burns and his staff. He had failed to receive any scholarship offers from Division I programs.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 78. On December 4, 2005, Owumi scored 26 points with 8 three-point field goals in a win over . During his time at Monroe CC, he began attracting interest from basketball teams at Rutgers, San Diego State, and UCLA.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 77. A two-star recruit, and the fifth-best junior college recruit in New York according to 247Sports.com, he was recruited from Monroe CC by Samuel West and Jason Cable of the Alcorn State Braves.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 79. On February 1, 2006, Owumi signed a letter of intent to play for Alcorn State, a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) and an NCAA Division I program. He committed to the team on June 10 before enrolling on June 30. In his debut with the Braves on November 9, 2006, Owumi recorded 2 points, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals off the bench in a 103‚Äì44 loss to the Texas Longhorns. Owumi struggled to guard Kevin Durant during the game.Owumi & Paisner (2013), pp. 94‚Äì95. He first scored in the double digits on November 27, with a team-high 12 points against the Baylor Bears. He led Alcorn State to its first Division I victory of the season on January 13, 2007, when he posted 15 points and 6 rebounds against the Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils. Two games later, the junior scored 17 points in a victory over the Alabama State Hornets. Owumi notched a career-high 30 points, along with a season-best ten rebounds, in a March 1 loss to the Prairie View A&M; Panthers. During an 11-win season, he averaged 8.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, 0.8 assists, and 0.8 steals per game. Owumi returned to Alcorn State to play basketball as a senior, and became team captain.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 98. In his season debut on November 9, 2007, he had 10 points and 8 rebounds in an 18-point loss to the . Coming off the bench against the Texas‚ÄìRio Grande Valley Vaqueros on December 1, Owumi led the Braves with 20 points. In his next Division I game, he recorded 24 points and eight rebounds. Owumi's 2007‚Äì08 season-high of 28 points came in an 81‚Äì75 Alcorn State loss to the on January 5, 2008; he added 9 rebounds and 4 assists. Although Owumi had an increased role on the team in his senior year, the Braves finished the season with a 7‚Äì24 win‚Äìloss record. He closed out his final college season with per-game averages of 14.4 points, 6.6 rebounds (a team-best figure), 1.9 assists, and 0.9 steals. ==Professional career== Early years (2009‚Äì2010) Following his Alcorn State career, Owumi was uncertain if he would be able to make the NBA after college, because of the relatively low talent level and popularity of the SWAC. Still, he hoped to join the NBA's Boston Celtics, as his former AAU coach Leo Papile had connections with the organization. In June 2008, Owumi participated in a pre- NBA draft camp with the Celtics. He averaged 10.9 points and 3.0 rebounds at the event. Before the 2008 NBA draft, he took part in pre-draft workouts in Boston and Orlando, Florida. However, Owumi was unable to attract enough interest from the Celtics.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 99. In late 2008, he joined the Manchester Millrats of the , an American minor league, for the preseason. Based in Manchester, New Hampshire, the team was located very close to his parents' home.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 109. In his first preseason game on December 6, 2008, he put up 16 points and 7 rebounds to help the Millrats defeat the Quebec Kebs. After briefly considering a path into the NBA Development League, the minor league to the NBA, Owumi signed with the French club AL Roche-la-Moli√®re of the Nationale Masculine 1 (NM1) for the 2009‚Äì10 season,Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 103. encouraged to join by a salary increase. A member of the team's starting lineup, he averaged 17.2 points and 6.0 rebounds and won league MVP accolades‚Äîalthough his team finished with a poor record.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 106. During the season, he was benched without pay for a number of games for missing practice and instead attending the Cannes Film Festival.Owumi & Paisner (2013), pp. 104‚Äì107. On returning from France, Owumi again played for the Millrats. With Owumi's contribution of 13 points and 5 rebounds, the team defeated the Kebs to clinch the Atlantic Division title. In the league semifinals, the Millrats lost to the Rochester Razorsharks.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 112. Owumi played 22 games with Manchester, averaging 14.9 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He had a field goal percentage of .429, which ranked second in the league. The departure of head coach Rob Spon prompted Owumi to leave the team.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 120. In the fall of 2010, he tried out for the Georgia Gwizzlies of the but never signed with the team. For the 2010‚Äì11 season, Owumi received an offer of about $10,000 per month from KK Lirija of the Macedonian First League.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 119. While in Macedonia, he was nicknamed \\"Alexander the Great\\". The Macedonian arenas, which often lacked proper heating systems, were about 20 ¬∞F (‚àí6.67 ¬∞C) in the winter and were sometimes heated using burn barrels.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 217 Owumi and his American teammates became the targets of racist slurs from opposing fans. In a road game against KK Rabotniƒçki, some of his Albanian teammates attacked fans burning the Albanian flag, sparking a riot.Owumi & Paisner (2013), pp. 126‚Äì131. The violence convinced him to find a new team. Playing for Gaddafi (2010‚Äì2011) In late 2010, an agent approached Goran Gramatikov, Owumi's agent, looking for players of African descent to play professional basketball in Libya.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 130. By December 27, 2010, Owumi had arrived in the country, signing a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league. Despite fears of the country's instability in the midst of the budding Arab Spring, and attempts by his girlfriend Alexis Jones to discourage him, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia.Owumi & Paisner (2013), p. 131. He said later, \\"The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about. I didn't really care about the team, I cared about the money and that it was going to be on time and that I was going to be able to further my career and get to feed my family.\\" Before his first practice with Al-Nasr, Owumi became nauseated from food poisoning and was hospitalized.Owumi & Paisner (2013), pp. 155‚Äì156. He moved into a luxurious apartment in the center of Benghazi owned by Mutassim Gaddafi. Initially unaware of the apartment's ownership, he later saw pictures of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his family across the building and learned that the Gaddafi family owned Al-Nasr. Owumi began playing with Al-Nasr during a three-game losing streak. His Libyan teammates had bruises and scratches from security guards beating them during such slumps. The team received millions of dollars in funding from the Gaddafi family, and its home arena was the site of Gaddafi's first public execution. With Al-Nasr, Owumi traveled to games on private jets, did not have to pay for food, and had his own driver. Although he only saw Gaddafi at one game, he met his sons and Mutassim and considered following their footsteps into the oil business. In his first few weeks in Benghazi, he witnessed several protests against Gaddafi, but relatively little violence. He also saw people, including his teammates, gathering ammunition and weapons to prepare for the revolution against Gaddafi's government. Violence breaks out On February 17, 2011, Owumi's regular driver did not show up to take him to practice. He called his head coach, Sherif Azmy, who instructed him to look outside his apartment, where a violent protest was taking place. According to Owumi, a military convoy of 30 to 40 soldiers approached the hundreds of protesters and began shooting into the crowd without warning. He recounted, \\"There was nobody with megaphones telling people to disperse. I just saw them shooting. Not to the air or the ground. Just shooting at people. Bodies were dropping. It was happening a block away from my street.\\" Owumi witnessed the deaths of about 200 people that day. Mercenary troops later searched his apartment for revolutionaries, but did not harm him after he showed them his American passport and Al-Nasr player card. After the soldiers assaulted and raped one of his neighbors, Owumi tried unsuccessfully to seize a gun from them. Owumi was unable to get access to the Internet or use his phone for international calls to contact his parents in the United States. He was also without electricity, and had little food or water. Al-Nasr team president Ahmed Elturki told Owumi that the airport in Libya had been burned down by protesters and advised him to remain in his apartment. Trapped in Mutassim's apartment during conflict, Owumi was eventually forced to drink toilet water with tea bags, urinate in the bathtub, and defecate into plastic bags. He also ate cockroaches and worms he found in flower pots. His poor living conditions caused his teeth to rot and his skin to discolor. Escape to Egypt Approximately two weeks after violence broke out in Benghazi, Owumi received a call from his teammate Moustapha Niang, who said that Elturki would attempt to help the two of them escape the country. Elturki had arranged for a car to take them to an Egyptian refugee camp in Sallum, following Al-Nasr coach Sherif Azmy. Owumi passed through several rebel checkpoints and arrived at the Egyptian border in 12 hours. Because of their appearance, both Owumi and Niang were suspected of being foreign mercenaries fighting for Gaddafi and were subject to harsher treatment. Without proper immigration papers, Owumi was held in Sallum for three days. He was arrested and held in solitary confinement for two hours, and once released, he had to sleep outside for three days in the camp. Owumi and Niang finally escaped the camp during the night. They bribed the driver of a bus, which only carried Egyptian citizens, to help them leave. Owumi received a call from Azmy who wanted to meet him at his home in Alexandria. Owumi then convinced the driver, who was headed to Cairo, to lead them to another bus going to Alexandria. In Alexandria, Owumi received a satisfactory offer from El-Olympi, a local team coached by one of Azmy's former players and recommended by Azmy himself. Going against his family's wishes, Owumi chose to follow his coach's advice, because he did not want his relatives to see his poor physical and mental state; he felt that he could recover by playing basketball.Owumi & Paisner (2013), pp. 227. He recalled, \\"The real reason why I didn't come home was I was just too raw. You know, I would look in the mirror, and I couldn't recognize myself.\\" He also believed that a return to basketball would help him slowly reduce the trauma he suffered in Libya. However, during this stint, his father fell into a diabetic coma, causing Owumi added stress.Owumi & Paisner (2013), pp. 255‚Äì256. He finished the final two weeks of the season with El-Olympi. He led his new team to 13 straight wins and the league championship, and was named most valuable player of the postseason.Owumi & Paisner (2013), pp. 261‚Äì262. Aftermath After returning to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, and continued to suffer from its effects in the years following. He has sometimes had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi was offered a contract to play another season with El-Olympi. Worth twice the money as his first El- Olympi contract, it would have been the biggest of his career, and made him the highest-paid player to play in the Middle East. After initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he wanted to take a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown of Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour. Worcester Wolves (2012‚Äì15) Owumi attempts to grab a rebound with the Wolves in 2012. During Owumi's hiatus from basketball, his family encouraged him to return to the game, as it was his primary passion. Stanley Ocitti and Sherrad Prezzie- Blue, players who already knew Owumi, suggested that Paul James, head coach of the Worcester Wolves of the British Basketball League (BBL), look into signing him. In the summer of 2012, the Wolves signed Owumi, who joined Prezzie-Blue in the back court. James said, \\"[Owumi] distributes the ball well and will give us multiple options both on offense and defense.\\" The coach also described Owumi as a \\"tough-nosed player\\". He had an immediate impact, recording a team-high 24 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 assists in his debut against the Durham Wildcats on September 22, 2012. He had another strong showing on January 25, 2013, when he put up 30 points in a loss to the Surrey Scorchers. On February 8, he led Worcester to an upset win over the Newcastle Eagles in a BBL Trophy quarterfinal with a season-high 34 points and 9 rebounds. Owumi posted a double-double of 30 points, 16 of which were free throws, and ten rebounds in a loss to the Manchester Giants on March 23. Through the BBL Championship and Play-offs, Owumi averaged 19.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 1.2 steals. He was named to the BBL Team of the Week First Team on six occasions during the season. He also garnered all- league honorable mention and all-defensive honorable mention honors. On June 5, 2013, the Wolves announced that Owumi would be returning for another season with the team. James hoped to build the team around him in their upcoming season. Beginning early in the season, Owumi joined forces with Zaire Taylor in the back court. On September 28, 2013, to begin his second BBL season, Owumi scored 18 points and added 2 rebounds and 2 assists in a 117‚Äì60 win over the Surrey Scorchers. On December 1, Owumi scored a season-high 30 points to guide the Wolves past the Durham Wildcats. In a rematch with Durham on Owumi notched 27 points to extend his team's winning streak to seven. On March 31, he put up 11 points as the Wolves defeated the Glasgow Rocks to win the BBL Trophy. In May, Worcester also claimed the BBL Championship title behind Owumi's 14 points and 6 rebounds. By the end of the season, he was averaging 17.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.3 steals in BBL Championship play. Owumi (right) is guarded by Joe Ikhinmwin of the London Lions in February 2014. In July 2014, Owumi re-signed with the Wolves for a third season. He commented, \\"It was an easy decision for me to come back to Worcester, the club and city support everything I'm doing on and off the court. Next season should be exciting, I'm looking forward to building on it.\\" During the off-season, the Wolves had seen the departures of key players Taylor and Will Creekmore. To open the season on September 26, 2014, Owumi recorded 10 points, 6 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals in a win over the Newcastle Eagles. On October 24, he scored a season-high 33 points, making all 6 of his three-point attempts, to beat the Leeds Force, 98‚Äì69. Owumi became his team's all-time leader in three-pointers, passing Daniel Gilbert for a total of 169. He collected 5 three-pointers in another 30-point game on December 14, as Worcester fell to the Cheshire Phoenix. On April 26, 2015, in the BBL Play-off quarterfinals, Owumi posted a double-double of 18 points and ten rebounds, but the London Lions eliminated his team with a 106‚Äì67 win. He capped the season averaging 16.4 points, 6 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.1 steals per game. London Lions (2015‚Äì2017) Owumi shoots around before a game with the London Lions in May 2017. In late June 2015, the Worcester Wolves released Owumi as part of a major roster shake-up that left only one player on the team. On December 18, 2015, Owumi returned to the BBL, signing with the London Lions for the rest of the 2015‚Äì16 season. He said, \\"I always felt I would be back and I'm happy it's in the Capital. Yes, I've been through a lot but I'm old fashioned and I just want to work hard.\\" Owumi debuted on the same day with 11 points in a loss against the Sheffield Sharks. He recorded 22 points and a season-best 9 rebounds as the Lions fell to the Surrey Scorchers on February 12. On March 30, he posted another season-high of 27 points, 19 of which came in the first quarter, in a victory over the Cheshire Phoenix. At the end of the 24-game season, he was averaging 13.4 points, 3.9 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 0.8 steals per game. On August 14, 2016, the Lions announced that Owumi would return for the 2016‚Äì17 season. In his first game of the season on September 24, he scored 18 points and had 9 rebounds helping beat the Surrey Scorchers. In a BBL Cup win over the Plymouth Raiders on October 9, he made 9 three-pointers in a season-high 32-point effort. Owumi scored 23 points off 8-of-13 shooting, with 19 in the first half, on October 26 against the Leeds Force to help the Lions achieve a 6‚Äì0 start to the season. In a rematch with the Scorchers on November 2, Owumi notched 27 points, converting on all 11 free throw attempts. London coasted to a 30-point win. On New Year's Day 2017, he recorded ten points and had 11 assists to overcome a poor shooting night against Surrey. Owumi had a triple- double of 15 points, ten rebounds, and ten assists as the Lions beat the Raiders on March 10. He entered the BBL Play-off with hopes of making a run. However, the Riders ousted London in the semifinals, despite a 21-point night by Owumi. He finished the season with per-game averages of 13.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.0 steals. Surrey Scorchers (2017‚Äì2018) On August 4, 2017, Owumi signed with the Surrey Scorchers, his third career BBL team. After the team announced his signing, he said, \\"Since being in the league, Surrey has had a great fan base and I can't wait to win some silverware for the organization.\\" Owumi also revealed that he prefers playing in smaller cities like Guildford, Surrey, in contrast to London, where he played before. He wanted to join the Scorchers because head coach Creon Raftopoulos would give him more freedom to bring in players he knew to the team. Owumi made his debut for the Scorchers on September 29, 2017, scoring 16 points in an 81‚Äì78 win over the Sheffield Sharks. On November 12, he recorded 20 points, with a season-high 6 three-pointers, to help the Scorchers defeat the Manchester Giants. Owumi scored a season-high 21 points on March 23, 2018, against the London Lions. One week later, he matched that mark, notching 21 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists in a 96‚Äì94 win over the Manchester Giants. Through 33 games in the season, Owumi averaged 10.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game.  Worthing Thunder (2018‚Äìpresent)  On August 6, 2018, Owumi signed with the Worthing Thunder of the National Basketball League Division 1, the second-tier British league. He made his season debut against the Barking Abbey Crusaders, scoring 24 points. ==Personal life== After Owumi returned to the United States from Libya, his mother suggested that he write a book about his experiences living in Benghazi during the Arab Spring. Although initially wanting to forget those memories, he wrote his autobiography Qaddafi's Point Guard: The Incredible Story of a Professional Basketball Player Trapped in Libya's Civil War with Daniel Paisner, a New York Times bestselling author who had written for Whoopi Goldberg and Denzel Washington. It was published in 2013. It describes Owumi's life from his childhood to his season in Egypt. Publishers Weekly called it a \\"resonant, moving memoir of an African athlete who survives incredible cultural and political challenges to play the sport he loves\\". Kirkus Reviews remarked that it was \\"well-written but with the feel of a magazine article masquerading as a book\\". In September 2016, Owumi wrote the fictional thriller The Fire Raven: Volume 1 about a female assassin trying to discover her past. In April 2017, he released the sequel . ==ReferencesBibliography== * ==External links== *Alex Owumi on ESPN *Alex Owumi on Eurobasket.com *Alex Owumi on RealGM Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Alcorn State Braves basketball players Category:Guards (basketball) Category:Junior college men's basketball players in the United States Category:Nigerian men's basketball players Category:Nigerian expatriate basketball people in the United States Category:Nigerian expatriates in Egypt Category:Nigerian expatriates in England Category:Nigerian expatriate basketball people in France Category:Nigerian expatriates in Libya Category:Sportspeople from Lagos Category:Worcester Wolves players Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Alex Owumi"},{"id":"54215840","text":"London Bridge attack can refer to: * 1884 attack on London Bridge * 1992 London Bridge bombing * 2017 London Bridge attack * 2019 London Bridge stabbing ","title":"London Bridge attack"},{"id":"54215845","text":"The table tennis competition at the 2017 Games of the Small States of Europe took place from 30 May to 3 June 2017 at the Kursaal Congress Center in the City of San Marino.

The range to the target is determined by taking the cotangent of the depression angle d times the height of the instrument OM, to yield the range MP. But due to the curvature of the earth, the true range is MT. To achieve this, the DPF instrument adjusts the observer's height from OM to ON, and then correctly measures the range as NT. Alternatively, the depression angle could be adjusted to d, but this method was not used. An American DPF (left) and azimuth scope (right) in use Warner- Swasey DPF, illustration from a 1910 manual The remains of three American base end stations with their concrete DPF mounting columns. These columns date to about 1910. A section drawing of an American fire control building with a DPF mounting column roughly 19 ft tall. The depression range finder (DRF) was a fire control device used to observe the target's range and bearing to calculate firing solutions when gun laying in coastal artillery. It was the main component of a vertical base rangefinding system. It was necessitated by the introduction of rifled artillery from the mid-19th century onwards, which had much greater ranges than the old smoothbore weapons and were consequently more difficult to aim accurately. The DRF was invented by Captain H.S.S. Watkin of the Royal Artillery in the 1870s and was adopted in 1881.1885 DRF Handbook1892 DRF Handbook It could provide both range and bearing information on a target. The device's inventor also developed a family of similar devices, among them the position finder, which used two telescopes as a horizontal base rangefinding system, around the same time; some of these were called electric position finders. Some position finders retained a depression range finding capability; some of these were called depression position finders. Watkin's family of devices were deployed in position finding cells, a type of fire control tower, often in configurations that allowed both horizontal base and vertical base rangefinding. Watkin's system included automatic electrical updating of range and bearing dials near the guns as the position finders were manipulated, and a system of remotely firing the guns electrically from the position finding cell. The improved system was trialled in 1885 and widely deployed in the 1890s.Coast defence range finding at victorianforts.co.ukMajor Watkin's Position Finder at victorianforts.co.ukWatkin depression position finders at victorianforts.co.uk Functionally equivalent devices were developed for the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps and its predecessors, called depression position finders or azimuth instruments depending on function (vertical base or horizontal base), adopted in 1896 and deployed widely beginning in the early 1900s as the Endicott program of modern coastal defences was built. These devices were also used by both countries to control submarine (underwater) minefields.Fort Gilkicker: Ranging the guns ==Operation== A depression position finder measured the range to a distant target (such as a ship) by solving a right triangle in which the short side was the height of the instrument above mean low water; one angle was the constant right angle between the short side and the plane of the ocean, and the second angle was the depression angle from the horizontal of the instrument as it sighted down from a fire control tower or a base end station at the target. This was called the \\"vertical base\\" system of rangefinding. These calculations were built into the scales and gearing of the instrument as configured for its site, which also corrected for the curvature of the earth and for optical parallax, so the horizontal range to the target could be read from a dial on the DPF.FM 4-15, Seacoast Artillery fire control and position finding, pp. 46‚Äì58 ==British system== Initially, a simple method of fire control was adopted in which an officer in an observation position would observe where shots landed and relay the information back to the gunner. It was hampered by the need for ranges to be estimated by eye, which introduced significant inaccuracy. Between 1870 and 1880, various mechanical range- finding devices were developed to provide a more accurate system, a type of horizontal base system. They were, however, limited by requiring two observers to be positioned on a piece of flat ground up to wide, using instruments to measure the two base angles of a triangle between the observers and the target. A serving British Army officer, Captain H.S.S. Watkin of the Royal Artillery, devised a solution based on surveying principles, exploiting the fact that the observer's height above the waterline could be used as the base of the measuring triangle. A measurement of the angle of depression to the bow-waterline of the target would thus give the range. While stationed at Gibraltar in the 1870s, he developed a device termed the Watkin Depression Range-finder (DRF), derived from the surveyor's level, which could be used in permanently fixed mountings whose height above sea level could be precisely determined. It was trialled by the War Office between 1876 and June 1881, when it was formally adopted, and subsequently became standard equipment in coastal forts and batteries. It was easy to use, highly accurate and was combined with automatic electrical updating of range and bearing dials near the guns as the position finders were manipulated. Soon after the DRF was developed, Watkin developed the Position Finder (PF), a family of several devices which, when two were used in a horizontal base system, gave a more accurate range than the DRF. Some of these were called electric position finders. In some configurations, both horizontal base and vertical base ranging became possible. A horizontal PF, called a transmitter, would be combined with a DPF, called a receiver, in widely separated position finding cells. The DPF mounting was functionally similar to a plotting board and called a \\"range dial\\"; it electrically updated the range and bearing dials near the guns as the DPF was manipulated. The improved system was trialled at Fort Bovisand in 1885 and the Breakwater Fort in 1887, both at the entrance to Plymouth Sound. At some point remote electrical firing of the guns was added. The PF was used with heavier guns () and the DRF with lighter guns (). ==American system== A depression position finder (DPF) was an observation instrument that was used in the fire control system of the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps and predecessors from circa 1901 through 1945 to locate targets in range and/or azimuth as part of the process of directing the fire of a battery of coast defence guns or mortars. It was one of many technologies introduced to US coast defences as part of the wide-ranging Endicott program. These instruments, which contained telescopes on massive, finely geared mountings, were located in various types of fire control towers (or smaller facilities) such as base end stations, DPF bunkers, or built into concrete gun emplacements. The American DPFs were functionally similar to the British device of the same name, but their data were usually relayed by telephone to a plotting room instead of directly to the guns. To measure range correctly, a DPF instrument had to be configured for the specific site at which it was emplaced, and had to be adjusted during the day for the level of the tide at that site. The US Army adopted a DPF in 1896, around the time the first gun and mortar batteries of the Endicott program were completed. At this time US coast defences were designed for short-range use, including controlled underwater minefields. In 1899 a 60-foot DPF tower was built for trials at Fort Hancock, New Jersey. In 1901 a board recommended that DPFs should be augmented by a horizontal system, though the chief of artillery noted that DPFs could extend coverage at the edges of horizontal systems. One soldier looked through the telescope (a 12- or 20-power instrument) and \\"waterlined\\" the target ship, putting a vertical cross hair on the ship's forward stack and a horizontal cross hair on the ship's waterline. By turning a geared crank, he attempted to hold the ship in his sights as it passed through his field of view. A second soldier read azimuth and range data from the instrument at designated intervals. These intervals (usually set at 20 or 30 seconds) were indicated by the ringing of a time-interval bell or buzzer. This information was then called in by telephone to a fire control center or plotting room for the gun battery that had been selected to fire upon the designated target (often directly below a base-end station or DPF bunker), the plotting board in that facility was updated, and the guns notified to aim and fire.Berhow, pp. 291‚Äì297 The DPF instrument was meant to be used to locate targets at ranges of between 1,500 and 12,000 yards. Its effective range depended upon its height above mean low water, the viewing conditions (lighting, weather, fog, or smoke) and upon the skill of its operators in holding a \\"sight\\" on a target. From about 1900 to 1925, DPF instruments were often mounted for stability on massive, octagonal concrete columns perhaps two feet across and buried deeply in the ground. A wooden or lath-and-plaster fire control tower or base end station was then built up around, but not connected to, the column. The DPF could be used as part of a vertical base system of triangulation to compute the range to the target. It could also be used as part of a horizontal base system, in which it served as one of two base end stations, both of which measured an observing angle to the target, with the range and azimuth of the target being calculated from their joint observations. During the early part of the 20th century, DPF instruments were often installed in the battery commanders' stations for coastal artillery batteries and were used by the battery commander or a member of his staff to yield firing data (range and azimuth) for the guns. DPFs were usually mounted on concrete columns that extended from the foundation of their stations; this minimised the effect of structure aging or minor battle damage on the instrument's position. As longer-range guns were emplaced beginning in the 1920s, horizontal base end stations, often miles apart, became the preferred method of fire control. Coincidence range finders, self-contained short-baseline horizontal systems, began to supplement the DPF due to being quick and easy to use.FM 4-15, pp. 58‚Äì71 The DPF system was generally much less accurate than the horizontal base system, and by World War II the advent of radar made the DPF a back-up system that was used only in emergencies (such as damage to other observation stations). However, in the bombardment of Fort Stevens by a Japanese submarine on 21 June 1942, the only time a coastal defence installation in the contiguous United States was attacked, the fort's commander used a DPF to determine that the submarine was out of range, and thus did not return fire. ==See also== * Rangefinder * Seacoast defense in the United States ==References== Category:Coastal artillery Category:Artillery operation Category:United States Army Coast Artillery Corps Category:Military technology Category:Length, distance, or range measuring devices ","title":"Depression range finder"},{"id":"54215977","text":"Garrett Halfhill (born July 26, 1993) is an American soccer player who currently plays for New York Cosmos in the National Premier Soccer League. == Early life == Halfhill was born on July 26, 1993 in San Diego, California to parents Robert and Cheryl Halfhill. He grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he attended Landstown High School from 2008 to 2011. He has two sisters, Janelle and Amber. == Career ==  Youth  Halfhill played soccer for his high school team, the Landstown Eagles, for all four years of his attendance. In his freshman year, he participated in Landstown winning their first Beach District championship title. He received many accolades in high school, including being selected for the All-Virginia Beach Team three times. His senior year, he was named to the All-District and All-Region first teams, an honorable mention for the All-State team, and was named most outstanding male athlete by Landstown High School. During high school, Halfhill also played for Virginia Rush Soccer Club, a developmental soccer club in Southeastern Virginia.  College and amateur  In 2011, Halfhill was admitted to Xavier University with a Dean's Award Scholarship to study marketing. He played on the university's men's soccer team starting his freshman year, in which he had five starts, twenty appearances, and one goal. From his sophomore year until his graduation, Halfhill appeared in every Xavier match and started in all but one of them. He was named to the Big East Conference all-academic team his junior and senior years. In his senior year, Halfhill was named team captain, and was second on the team in minutes played with 2,092 total minutes. On September 13, 2014, Halfhill scored a career-high four points in a 3‚Äì0 win against Cincinnati, leading him to be named to that week's Big East Weekly Honor Roll and College Soccer News National Team of the Week. He was also named to the Big East's All-Tournament Team. At the end of his Xavier career, Halfhill held the university record for most matches played with 84 total appearances. Halfhill played in the Premier Development League (PDL) with the Des Moines Menace in 2013, and the Cincinnati Dutch Lions in 2014 and 2015.

In 2018 FC Cincinnati released Halfhill and he landed with the New York Cosmos. He played two seasons (2018-2019) with the New York Cosmos and made 35 appearances for the club. == Personal life == In addition to playing soccer, Halfhill has also worked as a sales representative at Paycor, a payroll and human resources company in Cincinnati, Ohio, and a business consultant at Dotloop. == Career statistics == {   center;\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - valign=\\"center\\"Des Moines Menace 2013 Premier Development League 4000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äìcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì40 - rowspan=\\"2\\" valign=\\"center\\"Cincinnati Dutch Lions 2014 Premier Development League 130colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äìcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äìcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì130 - 2015 Premier Development League 131colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì00colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì131 - valign=\\"center\\"FC Cincinnati 2017 United Soccer League 2010001040 - rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=\\"center\\"New York Cosmos 2018 National Premier Soccer League 90104000140 - 2019 National Premier Soccer League 90003010130 - 2019 NPSL Members Cup 0000800080 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !50!!1!!2!!0!!15!!0!!2!!0!!69!!1 } == References  External links == * * * Garrett Halfhill at Xavier Athletics Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:American soccer players Category:Xavier Musketeers men's soccer players Category:Des Moines Menace players Category:Cincinnati Dutch Lions players Category:FC Cincinnati (2016‚Äì18) players Category:Soccer players from Virginia Category:USL League Two players Category:USL Championship players Category:Soccer players from California Category:Sportspeople from Virginia Beach, Virginia Category:Sportspeople from San Diego Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Garrett Halfhill"},{"id":"54216037","text":"On Vacation is a mini-album by Canadian electronic musician Michael Silver, known by his stage name as CFCF, and the second record in Balearic beat music label International Feel's On Vacation mini-album series.Cooper, Duncan (January 12, 2016). \\"CFCF Is About To Make You Feel Veeeeeery Relaxed\\". The Fader. Retrieved June 1, 2017. On Vacation was initially planned to be a project of two extended plays titled Road Movie and House Music; this was before an International Feel A&R; worker suggested to Silver he should make the project one whole album. International Feel first released vinyl versions of the LP in Europe on February 17, 2016 before releasing it in digital shops all around the world on February 19. A Balearic beat jazz record that also includes a variety of musical styles such as baroque, chamber music, downtempo, easy listening, and new age, it is a set of tracks that lack any sort of indication of what place they are specifically set in, which is unlike most Balearic music that usually takes place on a beach. Reviews of On Vacation from music journalists were very favorable in general, some of them calling the record a \\"masterpiece\\" and one of the best albums of all time; a common praise was the album's use of sounds that would otherwise turn off most contemporary listeners. A set of three remixes of songs from On Vacation was issued by International Feel on July 15, 2016. ==Composition== On Vacation is a \\"breezy and cinematic\\" LP with \\"elegant melodies,\\" as described by Alec M. Preister of The New York Times. The record contains a variety of different genres; with Silver himself categorizing it as an ECM Records-style jazz release, it also touches on balearic beat, ambient, baroque, chamber music,H.

The more ambient tracks on On Vacation include \\"Lighthouse on Chatham Sound,\\" which contains a brief interlude of a woodwind-and-chime arrangement in the style of Brian Wilson's album Smile (2004), and ‚ÄúIn The Courtyard.‚Äù The songs on On Vacation were inspired by the films Paris, Texas (1984) and Three Colors: Red (1994).M.

Resident Advisor critic Andrew Ryce wrote that On Vacation has a similar intention to Paris, Texas in that it \\"invites you to get lost in its incredible backdrops.\\" Ryce wrote that \\"even the rhythmic parts can feel motionless, with metronomic beats that induce contemplation more than movement.\\" On Vacation, as a reviewer for International DJ magazine analyzed, is \\"an album inspired by places and spaces - some imaginary, some real.\\" As journalist Paul Simpson wrote, \\"On Vacation isn't CFCF's most focused work, but it isn't supposed to be. As the title states, this is music for escaping day-to-day life and getting pleasantly lost.\\" Critic Daniel Bromfield called On Vacation superior from most Balearic releases due to its \\"sense of mystery;\\" the songs lack any specific or consistent indication of where they take place, unlike other Balearic recordings which are commonly set in beaches of places like Africa or Brazil. For example, \\"Arto,\\" as Bromfield wrote, \\"will scan as European to anyone who‚Äôs never seen a Hayao Miyazaki film, but to those who have, it will instantly evoke the work of his musical partner, Joe Hisaishi, particularly on their more nostalgic joints like Porco Rosso and Kiki's Delivery Service.\\" Other specimens of the LP's little-place- identity aspect are songs whose titles are contradictory to where they are really set, including ‚ÄúVermont,‚Äù which has the vibe of coasts rather than wood-filled areas like the U.S. state named in the track's title, and ‚ÄúSate Padang,\\" which consists of more of an Afrobeat feel than an Indonesian tone. Bromfield also wrote that some songs, such as ‚ÄúLighthouse On Chatham Sound,‚Äù ‚ÄúChasing,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn The Courtyard‚Äù have a high amount of reverb on instruments \\"for extra transportive oomph.\\" ==Release== On Vacation was originally planned to be released as two extended plays titled Road Movie and House Music. However, International Feel A&R; worker Paul Byrne, known by his stage name as Apiento, convinced Silver he should combine the tracks into one single record instead of two separate releases; thus, the songs were released as a mini- album titled On Vacation, the second album in International Feel's On Vacation mini-LP series. On January 12, 2016, two songs from On Vacation, \\"Sate Padang\\" and \\"Arto,\\" premiered on Gorilla vs. Bear,Chris (January 12, 2016). \\"CFCF shares two tracks from his new mini-album On Vacation\\".

As he concluded in his review for Pitchfork, \\"it is Silver's most sophisticated virtual environment yet; disappear into it for a while, and you may come back with a newfound appreciation for sounds you once thought irredeemable‚Äîyes, even slap bass.\\" A review from Beatselector magazine concluded with, \\"Silver has rescued some of the sounds previously considered abominable to current music.

He is considered a superb 19th century French maker of cellos and is consistently counted among the handful of great French makers. == Early life == Charles Menn√©gand was born in Nancy on 19 June 1822. He apprenticed in Mirecourt. In 1840 Menn√©gand began working with Claude Victor Rambaux at Faubourg Poissonni√®re in Paris, and remained there for five years. He likely worked in Turin, Italy in the second half of the 1840s. He worked with Charles Maucotel from 1851‚Äì52, then moved to Amsterdam in 1852 to establish his own independent shop. == Career == Charles Menn√©gand was a prolific instrument maker during his years in Amsterdam. He returned to Paris in 1857 and established his shop at 26 rue de Trevise, just north of the Conservatoire de Paris. In Paris, his work was largely concerned with making cellos and with repairs and restoration for which he gained renown and won premier place. Like Rambaux, Mennegand was known for cutting down Golden Age Italian cellos which were viewed as too large to meet the demands of the then modern technical standards. This practice has come to be viewed as barbaric, but Menn√©gand was noted for the clever delicacy with which he did his first class work. This and his other repair work earned him the designation \\"consummate repairman\\". Menn√©gand's own cellos are \\"particularly valued\\" and \\"sought after\\". In A Dictionary of Violin Makers, Cecie Stainer wrote \\"after his return to Paris [Menn√©gand] principally made violoncellos, which rank among the best work of the time.\\" Menn√©gand mostly used Stradivari patterns though he experimented with slightly altered forms. His instruments are characterized as rich and powerfully brilliant. They owe much of their projecting power to the front plate's elegant thinness; this modification was the fruition of experiments with Rambaux in the early 1840s. Charles Menn√©gand used a reddish-brown spirit varnish with golden highlights and he was very particular about using carefully chosen wood of an even and medium grain. He signed his work internally \\"C. Mennegand\\" or used printed labels reading Menn√©gand / Luthier / 26 rue de Tr√©vise, Paris or C. Menn√©gand luthier / 26, rue de Tr√©vise, Paris. In the Universal Dictionary of Violin and Bow Makers, William Henley noted \\"the critical and judicious labour of this eminent maker deserves universal admiration,\\" and that Menn√©gand's instruments possess a \\"tonal quality establishing the real desideratum in bright sonority.\\" Charles Menn√©gand died on 9 January 1885 in Villers- Cotterets. == Awards == * Medal of the 2nd Class, Expositions universelles de Paris, 1855 * Bronze Medal, Expositions universelles de Paris, 1867 * Bronze Medal, Paris Exhibition, 1878 * Premier Place for Repairing == References ==  Sources  * Abele, Hyacinth.

The chancel dates to the 13th or 14th century. The tower dates to the 15th century. The arched nave ceiling is highly decorated with paintings. It was painted by Mildred Holland during the 19th century when her husband, William Holland, was the church's rector. Norman Scarfe notes that \\"between 1859 and 1882 that over ¬£2,000 was spent on the church\\". The church was altered during the Victorian restoration in 1858 to 1859 and in 1896 to 1906.

It was released in November 1998 as the second single from their album Feeling Strangely Fine. It was written by Dan Wilson and produced by Nick Launay. The single peaked at number 39 in the United Kingdom; in the United States, it reached number 11 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and number 31 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. ==Writing and composition== In a 2014 interview with The A.V. Club, Dan Wilson recalled how the idea for the song came about: \\"Someone that I knew had sent me an amazing mixtape, and I was loving every song. A way to seduce someone is to make them a list of music, a playlist that, once they hear, they‚Äôre more likely to fall in love with you.\\" He incorporated the word \\"Sony\\" into the song's lyrics because the company logo was visible at the center of the mixtape as he watched it going around in his cassette player. Another lyric, \\"Did you ever look so nice\\", was the name of one of the songs that had been included on the mixtape. Wilson said the lyrics came easily once he allowed himself to use these phrases. This was one of the Semisonic songs for which band member Jacob Slichter played the keyboard parts with his right hand while playing drums simultaneously. ==Music video== The music video for \\"Singing in My Sleep\\" was directed by Chris Applebaum, who helmed the video for Semisonic's previous single, \\"Closing Time\\". The band invited fans from its e-mail list to participate in a song swap in which fans could help choose songs for an \\"Ultimate Mix Tape,\\" to be used in the \\"Singing in My Sleep\\" video. In exchange, those fans received a personalized \\"thank you\\" token from the band, while the winner was also sent a copy of the video clip. ==Critical reception== A review of \\"Singing in My Sleep\\" in the Aug 15, 1998 issue of Billboard said the song's intro is \\"a shapeship-like whir and a funny, plinking melody\\", but that ultimately, the track is \\"pure, mass-consumption pop.\\" In a review of the maxi-single, Michael Frey of Allmusic called it \\"a melodic ode to the art of making mix tapes\\". PopMatters' Cindy Speer described it as \\"the perfect song for anyone who's ever made or received a mix tape for/from that possible new someone\\", and remarked that Wilson \\"perfectly captures the ambiguity and thrill of the situation\\" with his lyrics. Ian Cohen of Stylus Magazine wrote that the song is \\"a delicious bit of power-pop\\" that is far less \\"mawk-ish\\" than the band's \\"Closing Time\\". ==Chart positions== {class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (1998-2000) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - - - - } ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1998 singles Category:1998 songs Category:Semisonic songs Category:MCA Records singles Category:Music videos directed by Chris Applebaum Category:Songs written by Dan Wilson (musician) Category:Song recordings produced by Nick Launay ","title":"Singing in My Sleep"},{"id":"54216432","text":"Ezhandha Kadhal () is a 1941 Indian Tamil-language film directed by K.

Dao Ganmeng rebelled in 1397 and expelled the previous ruler Si Lunfa. Si Lunfa enlisted Ming aid in re-assuming control over his territory. ==Background== After the Ming‚ÄìMong Mao War Si Lunfa was forced to accept Ming suzerainty while the Ming recognized Mong Mao as a semi- independent tusi. In addition the Ming agreed to aid Mong Mao against the Kingdom of Ava and other rivals in Burma. In 1393 Si Lunfa invaded Ava. Despite the fact that he was ultimately defeated, Ava sent an envoy to the Ming seeking their help in deterring Mong Mao aggression. Acknowledging their position, the Hongwu Emperor sent a letter to Si Lunfa in 1396 warning him of retaliation if further acts of aggression were committed: Si Lunfa acquiesced to Ming demands. After Mong Mao stopped their military expansion, Si Lunfa began to welcome foreigners such as Buddhists and former Chinese soldiers into his people's traditional territory. Si Lunfa converted to Buddhism and gave gifts to the Chinese for bringing with them the technology of gunpowder and cannons. This greatly angered the traditional elements in his court and in 1397 Si Lunfa was deposed by the leader of an anti-foreigner faction, Dao Ganmeng, and fled to the Ming government for protection. According to the Ming Shilu: After reaching the Ming capital, Si Lunfa enlisted the Hongwu Emperor's aid in returning him to power. The emperor, desiring peace in the southwest, agreed to his petition and allocated 100 taels of gold, 150 taels of silver, and 500 ding of paper money to his cause. The Marquis of Xiping, Mu Chun, was assigned to provide Si Lunfa military support and retake Mong Mao. ==Battle== They returned to Yunnan and stayed in Baoshan while Mu Chun sent the commanders He Fu and Qu Neng with 5,000 troops to oust Dao Ganmeng. The expedition was met with initial success in battle, killing a Mong Mao chieftain, and routing his army, but arrived at an impasse when they failed to take a mountain stockade due to unfavorable terrain. He Fu relayed his situation to Mu Chun, who came to his aid with 500 cavalrymen, and in the midst of night advanced on the enemy position taking them by surprise. While they successfully took the stockade, Mu Chun died soon after from an illness and was replaced by He Fu, who captured Dao Ganmeng and installed Si Lunfa as ruler of Mong Mao once again in 1398. ==Aftermath== Si Lunfa died a year later and a new generation of elites rose to power in Mong Mao. His son Si Xingfa, together with Dao Hun and Dao Cuan, conducted short lived raids on Ming territory before military retaliation by the Yunnan guard forced them to stop. Ming interest in Yunnan and the southwest waned in the following years as the court's attention turned to the civil war between the Jianwen Emperor and his uncle Zhu Di. Following the civil war, the Yongle Emperor became preoccupied with his efforts in pacifying the northern Mongols, and engaged in several campaigns in Mongolia as well as conducted an invasion of ƒê·∫°i Ngu. ==ReferencesBibliography== * . * * * Category:Conflicts in 1396 ","title":"Dao Ganmeng rebellion"},{"id":"54216575","text":"Jos√© Alejandro Bernheim (1822‚Äì1893) was a French journalist of Jewish origin.

He is remembered for cartoons and cover illustrations in The New Yorker and for children's book illustrations. ==Early life and education== Born in Bucyrus, Kansas, Price was reared on a farm in Saratoga, Wyoming, the son of a horse-and-buggy doctor. He began sketching animals and people as a boy, and attended the University of Wyoming. The University library holds a collection of his work. He went on to study art at the Art Institute of Chicago where he became friends with fellow New Yorker cartoonists Perry Barlow, Alice Harvey and Helen E. Hokinson. Price married Florence Semler (died 1973) of Latrobe, Pennsylvania. They lived in Westport, Connecticut and had a summer home on Mason's Island at the mouth of the Mystic River, in Stonington, Connecticut where their friend, the artist Herbert Stoops, also summered. ==Career== Price's first job was as a reporter- cartoonist for The Kansas City Star, he went on to draw illustrations and a full-page comic strip for the Chicago Tribune. He served in World War I as a contributing artist for Navy publications. ==The New Yorker== Price worked for over half a century for The New Yorker, drawing hundreds of cartoons and 100 covers, including two in 1925, the monthly magazine's first year (\\"Paris Caf√©\\", August 1, and \\"Heat Wave\\", August 29). Thomas Powers describes the Price covers in later decades as sometimes possessing \\"a stunning, wistful beauty\\", flagging, in particular, \\"a 1956 cover of circus queens riding elephants into the ring, a 1949 cover of a boy all alone on a spring ball field sliding into home plate, and a 1951 cover of autumn leaves falling over a summer house being closed for the winter‚Äîa husband sits waiting in the car as his wife gathers a last armful of flowers.\\" His last cover appeared in the summer of 1973, the year his wife died. ==Books== Drawing Room Only (1946) is a collection of Price's work, principally featuring New Yorker cartoons. In 2016 Sunday Press Books published Price's Chicago Tribune comic strip as a book entitled White Boy in Skull Valley. The strip, which began in the fall of 1933 and was called White Boy, featured a skinny white boy captured and adopted by an Indian tribe unfamiliar with modern culture and technology. The love interest was an intrepid girl named Starlight but called \\"Little Squaw\\" who was described by Thomas Powers in his 2016 essay on Price in The New York Review of Books as having \\"kissable lips of the Clara Bow sort\\" and \\"White Boy‚Äôs full attention\\". About halfway thorough its 3-year life of about 150 issues, the strip shifted into a more contemporary if still mythical West, the characters lost their distinctively Indian customs and dress, the strip was renamed Skull Valley, and \\"Little Squaw\\" renamed Doris, now wearing jodhpurs and boots. ==Books illustrated== *While Mrs. Coverlet Was Away (1958) by Mary Nash *Mrs. Coverlet's Magicians (1960) by Mary Nash *Mrs. Coverlet's Detectives (1965) by Mary Nash *The Finer Things of Life (1951) by Frances Gray Patton (Dodd, Mead and Company) *Good Morning, Miss Dove (1954) by Frances Gray Patton (Dodd, Mead) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1896 births Category:1979 deaths Category:American cartoonists Category:American comics artists Category:American illustrators Category:American naval personnel of World War I Category:Chicago Tribune people Category:People from Saratoga, Wyoming Category:School of the Art Institute of Chicago alumni Category:The New Yorker cartoonists Category:University of Wyoming alumni ","title":"Garrett Price"},{"id":"54216701","text":"Jordan Scarlett (born July 8, 1995) is a Jamaican footballer who currently plays for the Tampa Bay Rowdies in the USL Championship. ==Early life== Scarlett was born in Jamaica, but grew up in The Bronx in New York City. ==Career== College and Amateur From 2010 to 2012, Scarlett starred for Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx, playing as a central midfielder and scoring 19 goals in 34 appearances from Sophomore year to Senior year.

Since the early 1990s, house prices in New Zealand have risen considerably faster than incomes, putting increasing pressure on public housing providers as fewer households have access to housing on the private market. The property bubble has produced significant impacts on inequality in New Zealand, which now has the highest homelessness rate in the OECD and a record-high waiting list for public housing. Government policies have attempted to address the crisis since 2013, but have produced limited impacts to reduce prices or increase the supply of affordable housing. == Background == A house price bubble is defined as a period of speculative purchases, where investors demonstrate willingness to pay a high price today because they believe that it will be as high (or higher) tomorrow.Stiglitz, J.E. (1990). ‚ÄúSymposium on bubbles‚Äù. In: Journal of Economic Perspectives Vol. 4 No. 2, pp. 13-18 A 2016 study found evidence of a bubble in the New Zealand housing market from 2003, which stalled in 2007/8 with the impacts of the global financial crisis. A second bubble appeared in 2013, and until 2015 there were no notable spillover effects to other regions. However, from 2015 onwards, rapid price growth is evident across smaller centres. Housing in New Zealand has been strongly shaped by colonisation, post-war state intervention and economic and financial reforms since the 1980s. The fourth Labour Government (elected in 1984) rapidly introduced policies of economic deregulation, as a result of the previous Prime Minister Robert Muldoon's Think Big policies that had left the country heavily in debt. Investment in shares increased rapidly, often with little due diligence carried out. The 1987 sharemarket crash hit New Zealand's economy especially hard, with the NZSE dropping around 60% from its peak. Many investors who lost heavily in the 1987 crash never returned to the sharemarket, instead opting for the safer option of property investment. In 1989 Parliament passed the Reserve Bank Act, which emphasised keeping a lid on inflation and on interest rates, which in turn reduced the costs of borrowing for fixed assets such as houses. In the same year, tax exemptions for pension, insurance and other similar investments were abolished, but not for real estate. Two years later, the Resource Management Act (RMA) replaced a raft of regional-planning laws. Some regard the RMA as an obstacle to building affordable housing. Alongside institutional reforms in the housing sector, problems with poor-quality construction, historic injustices and under- provision for the needs of indigenous MƒÅori, and persistent income inequality, the lack of affordable housing is a critical issue. Since the Global Financial Crisis, the rapid growth of prices has created an affordable housing crisis and housing has been a prominent issue on political agendas since 2013. Despite a number of policy interventions to address the crisis, prices have continued to grow across the country. As shown below, real house prices increased almost three-fold between 2000‚Äì2018.OECD Economic Surveys: New Zealand 2019 == Affordability crisis == While house prices increased almost- continuously from the early 1990s, it was not until the 2007 that the media started reporting an affordability crisis. Nationwide, property prices increased 80% in real terms between 2002‚Äì2008.House Prices Unit (2008) Final Report of the House Prices Unit: House Price Increases and Housing In New Zealand. Wellington: Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Global Financial Crisis caused a 10% drop in nominal prices in 2008, however price growth picked up again significantly following the crisis and by 2014, nominal prices in Auckland were 34% higher than the pre-crisis peak. As of 2019, the average house price in New Zealand exceeded NZ$700,000, with average prices in the country's largest city, Auckland, exceeding $1,000,000 in numerous suburbs. The ratio between median house price and median annual household income increased from just over 3.0 in January 2002 to 6.27 in March 2017, with Auckland's figures 4.0 to 9.81 respectively. In 2017, the Demographia think-tank ranked Auckland's housing market the fourth-most unaffordable in the world‚Äîbehind Hong Kong, Sydney and Vancouver‚Äîwith median house prices rising from 6.4 times the median income in 2008 to 10 times in 2017. Another study carried out in 2016 reported that average house prices in Auckland surpassed those of Sydney. That same year, the International Monetary Fund ranked New Zealand at the top for housing unaffordability in the OECD, and has called for taxation of property speculation. Multiple property owners in New Zealand are not subject to capital gains taxes and can use negative gearing on their properties, making it an attractive investment option. Prospective house-buyers, however, accuse property investors of crowding them out. When the Tax Working Group reported its findings to Parliament in 2019, a capital gains tax was among its recommendations, only to be shelved after failing to secure enough Parliamentary backing. According to NZ's 2017 register of pecuniary interests, New Zealand's 120 members of parliament own more than 300 properties between them, prompting accusations of conflict of interest. NIMBY sentiment among established home-owners‚Äîparticularly towards attempts to relax building density rules in Auckland such as the Unitary Plan‚Äîhas also been pointed to as a major factor in the housing bubble.  Regional dynamics  The house price bubble first emerged in Auckland, and subsequently spread to other areas of the country. The figure below shows the regional changes in average house price, between 2014‚Äì2019. Annual change in average house price, 2014‚Äì2019. Source: QV.  Social impacts of the affordability crisis  Unaffordable housing has produced profound impacts on New Zealand society. Between 1986 and 2013, home ownership dropped from 74% to 65%.Statistics New Zealand (2015). Dwelling and tenure type tables for Auckland from 2013 Census. The most recent statistics on homelessness, from the 2013 Census, showed that 1% of the population were living in severe housing deprivation. Of this population 71% are temporarily resident in severely crowded private dwellings, 19% live in commercial dwellings or marae, and 10% live on the street or in a car. Between 2017‚Äì2019, the waiting list for public housing doubled, reaching a record 12,500 in August 2019. In 2018, a report found that emergency housing providers were turning away 80-90% of those seeking assistance. The substantial growth of property prices over recent decades has significantly influenced the distribution of wealth in New Zealand. The 2019 Rich List showed that eight of the top 25 wealthiest people made their money from property, and 16 of the 20 new additions to the list also became wealthy through property investment. Rising prices have been attributed to various factors including deregulation, immigration and politics, with considerable debate over how to address the issue due to its large size relative to the economy. == Policy responses == Policies to address the housing affordability crisis cover land use and planning regulation, state housing provision, rules on ownership and investment, and financial regulation.  National government, 2008 - 2017   Special Housing Areas  In 2013, the government passed the Housing Accord and Special Housing Areas Act 2013, introducing Special Housing Areas (SHAs) to increase land supply in urban areas. Within designated SHAs, developments larger than 14 dwellings were required to allocate 10% of housing at 'affordable' prices. Affordability was defined as 75% of the region's median house price, or a price at which households earning up to 120% of median household income would spend no more than 30% of gross income on rent or mortgage repayments. Research showed that little evidence for the effectiveness of this policy to improve affordability. The act was not extended beyond 2019, after generating disappointing results. From 2016, the housing development planned by Fletcher Building on a designated Special Housing Area at IhumƒÅtao was opposed by protesters, who set up a camp at the site. Opponents contended that the land was confiscated during the Waikato War in 1863, in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi. In 2017 the United Nations recommended that the New Zealand Government review the designation of IhumƒÅtao as a Special Housing Area, drawing attention to potential breaches of human rights. In 2019, after protestors were served an eviction notice and police presence escalated, the prime minister announced that no development would take place at IhumƒÅtao while the government attempted to broker a solution.  Bright-line test  In October 2015 the government introduced a bright-line test to reduce speculative investment. This test applies to all property acquired after the law was introduced, and taxes capital gains at the same level as the seller's income tax rate.  Loan-to-value restrictions  The loan-to-value ratio measures how much a bank lends for a property, compared to the property's total value. Loan-to- value (LVR) restrictions were first introduced in 2013 by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The restrictions comprised a 'speed limit' on the proportion of high-LVR loans that banks can issue, and a threshold defining high-LVR loans. Initial LVR restrictions in October 2013 restricted banks to no more than 10% of loans beyond 80% LVR. In 2015, the restrictions were revised to target price inflation in Auckland, easing the restrictions to 15% over 80% LVR for non-Auckland loans, and increasing to 5% over 70% LVR for investor purchases in Auckland. In 2016 the restrictions tightened further on Auckland investors, to 5% over 60% LVR. Since 2018, LVR restrictions gradually reduced to 20% over 80% for owner-occupiers, and 5% over 70% for investors. In April 2020 the Reserve Bank lifted restrictions on mortgage borrowing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure that the LVR rules did not unduly affect lenders or borrowers as part of the mortgage deferral scheme introduced in response to the pandemic. The Reserve Bank has suggested that the targeted restriction for Auckland properties in 2015 may have contributed to price inflation in other regions.  National Policy Statement on Urban Development capacity (NPS- UDC)  The NPS-UDC is planned to be replaced by the National Policy Statement on Urban Development (NPS-UD), which the government consulted on in 2019. The purpose of the NPS-UDC, introduced in 2016, was to ensure that sufficient development capacity was provided by local authorities, to meet demand for land for housing and commercial use. The NPS-UDC provided targeted measures for high-growth areas.  Labour-New Zealand First coalition government, 2017 - present   Foreign ownership ban  In August 2018, a law was passed a ban non-resident foreigners from buying existing homes, delivering on the New Zealand first parties election promise. The law allows non-residents to own up to 60% of units in new-build apartment blocks, however, they are not permitted to buy existing homes. Immigration remains a topic of controversy in regards to housing affordability, and has been cited by the Reserve Bank and others as a factor in rising house prices. Annual net migration as of 2017 was approximately 70,000, compared with an average of 15,000 in the previous 25 years. However the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has refuted this, saying that New Zealanders returning from overseas make up much of the inflows, and that there was a need to allow in \\"skilled migrants required to ramp up housing supply\\". In 2015 it was reported that Auckland had over 33,000 \\"ghost\\" properties that were registered as unoccupied, many of them believed to be owned by absentee foreigners.  Extension of bright-line test  The bright-line test introduced under the previous administration was extended to five years, to reduce incentives for speculative investment. The five-year rule applies to properties purchased after March 2018, and the main family home is exempt. Changes in legal ownership for a property can count as a disposal, and 'reset the clock' on the five-year limit, even if the property is substantively owned and controlled by the same person.  State housing construction  In December 2017, the Sixth Labour Government stopped the sale of Housing New Zealand properties, and committed to expanding the supply of public housing.  KiwiBuild  KiwiBuild was the flagship housing policy of the Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand, proposing to deliver 100,000 houses in ten years to address the affordability crisis. The scheme planned to boost housing supply by giving property developers more incentives to deliver affordable homes rapidly. This included the Land for Housing programme, which acquired vacant land, on- selling to developers, with conditions of making 20% of dwellings available for public housing and delivering 40% 'affordable' housing according to KiwiBuild criteria. The scheme also purchased properties off-the-plans from developers, to sell to eligible buyers. Construction sector capacity to deliver KiwiBuild's targets was identified as a challenge, and the government introduced a KiwiBuild Shortage List, allowing accredited construction employers to accelerate the immigration process for construction workers. Criticism of the policy highlighted that the prices of KiwiBuild homes remained out of reach for many, with 'affordable' properties costing upward of NZD$500,000 in Auckland, and NZD$300,000-500,000 across the rest of the country. By September 2019, only 258 houses had been delivered by the scheme, well below the targets. The uptake also showed that the Kiwibuild homes did not attract buyers, with unsold homes released onto the private market in some regions. = KiwiBuild reset = A 'reset' of KiwiBuild was released in 2019, following the reshuffle of ministerial responsibilities for housing and appointment of Dr. Megan Woods as Minister for Housing. The revised policy dropped the target to build 100,000 houses in ten years and introduced rent- to-buy and shared equity options to improve affordability. The requirement for first-home buyers to hold their Kiwibuild homes for at least three years was reduced to one year.  National Policy Statement on Urban Development (NPS- UD)  The NPS-UD was consulted on in October 2019, to replace and expand on the 2016 NPS-UDC. The NPS-UD has a similar purpose to its predecessor, to enable growth in new areas by removing unnecessary restrictions, targeted to high-growth areas. The discussion document included a range of requirements for councils, including: * New objectives for Future Development Strategies, to ensure that growth is coordinated and responsive to demand * Allow growth through intensification and greenfield development, in a way that contributes to a quality urban environment * Develop and maintain evidence base on demand and prices for housing and land * Ensure planning is co-ordinated across urban areas, taking into account issues of concern for iwi and hap≈´ The NPS-UD is planned for implementation by mid-2020. == Alternative solutions considered ==  Tax reform   Capital gains tax  There is currently no tax on capital gains from property investment in New Zealand. The bright-line test introduced in 2015 and extended in 2018 aims to tax capital gains on property, however the main family home, estates, or properties sold through relationship settlements are exempt. In late 2017, the Labour Government established the Tax Working Group, an advisory group to examine improvements to the fairness and balance of the tax system. The group published its report in February 2019, recommending a tax on capital gains that applies to gains and most losses related to all types of land and improvements, except for the main family home. This tax would apply to rental and second homes, business assets, land and shares. Following robust public and media debate, the government abandoned their plan to introduce the capital gains tax, citing a lack of consensus within government.  Land value tax  Land value taxation has been suggested by a series of commentators, including Dr. Ryan Greenaway- McGrevy, economist Shamubeel Eaqub and Bernard Hickey.  Land use reform  In September 2015, the New Zealand Productivity Commission released a comprehensive report on Using land for housing, commissioned by the government to review local council processes for providing land for housing, with a focus on fast-growing areas. According to the report, insufficient supply of developable brownfield and greenfield land was a major contributor to house price growth between 2000‚Äì2015. It proposed reform in a range of areas: # Lifting restrictive planning controls in areas with spare capacity on existing infrastructure networks # More effective cost-recovery of infrastructure costs # Greater use of cost-benefit analysis for land use rules # Granting local urban development authorities (UDAs) more power to develop housing # Powers for central government to intervene to ensure sufficient development capacity is released, if councils are unable to release land (this was implemented through the 2016 National Policy Statement on Urban Development Capacity).  Financial regulation   Debt-to-income limits  In 2017 the Reserve Bank of New Zealand published a consultation paper on debt-to-income limits, as a tool to restrict credit growth and mitigate the risk of mortgage defaults during an economic downturn. High levels of private debt present a significant macro-economic risk. It reduces household consumption by diverting a large proportion of income to servicing debts and also makes households vulnerable to economic shocks. == Potential effects of bubble burst == According to investment manager Brian Gaynor in 2012, a 10% drop in house prices would wipe out $60 billion of New Zealanders' personal wealth, which would exceed the losses from the 1987 sharemarket crash. Steve Keen, one of the few economists to forecast the Great Recession, warned in mid-2017 that New Zealand would be one of many nations to experience a private debt meltdown involving housing, and that \\"the bubble will burst in the next one to two years\\". A report published by Goldman Sachs predicted that New Zealand had a 40% chance of a \\"housing bust\\" over the same period. Financial commentator Bernard Hickey has described New Zealand's property market as \\"too big to fail\\", and supports a deposit insurance scheme in the event of a banking collapse caused by a property crash. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has estimated that the total value of housing loans has increased from just under $60 billion in 1999 to over $220 billion in 2016. == See also == * Housing in New Zealand * KiwiBuild * Real estate bubble * Taxation in New Zealand * New Zealand dream ‚Äì aspirations of owning a property == References  External links == * The Auckland housing bubble and shades of 1987 Bubble Category:Real estate bubbles ","title":"New Zealand property bubble"},{"id":"54216715","text":"The 2017 Latvian Football Cup was the 23rd version of the tournament.

In order to replace the tram line, a metro line to Niendorf was required. Since there was no money to finance the cost of building a new line from Stephansplatz to Niendorf via the Grindel quarter, Hoheluft, and Lokstedt, which would have followed the path of the former tram line 2, it was decided that the line to Eimsb√ºttel (the U2) would be extended instead.Ulrich Alexis Christiansen: Hamburgs dunkle Welten.

At the same time, it was decided that Niendorf Markt would not be the terminus of the extension, but instead, that the line would be extended further to the new development areas of Niendorf Nord in a second construction phase. At the former terminus, Hagenbecks Tierpark, the sidings were rebuilt for the extension, which ran completely underground for environmental reasons. On November 5, 1984, a museum train carrying politicians and reporters came to Niendorf Markt. The train was pulled by a diesel locomotive, since the line had not yet been electrified.

Then Hector rushed forth to tear from the head of great- hearted Amphimachus the helm that was fitted to his temples, but Aias lunged with his bright spear at Hector as he rushed, yet in no wise reached he his flesh, for he was all clad in dread bronze; but he smote the boss of his shield, and thrust him back with mighty strength, so that he gave ground backward from the two corpses, and the Achaeans drew them off. Amphimachus then did Stichius and goodly Menestheus, leaders of the Athenians, carry to the host of the Achaeans, and Imbrius the twain Aiantes bare away, their hearts fierce with furious valour. And as when two lions that have snatched away a goat from sharp-toothed hounds, bear it through the thick brush, holding it in their jaws high above the ground, even so the twain warrior Aiantes held Imbrius on high, and stripped him of his armour.

Wishing to avenge his sons' death, Electryon purposed to make war on the Teleboans, but first he committed the kingdom to Amphitryon along with his daughter Alcmena, binding him by oath to keep her a virgin until his return. However, as he was receiving the cows back, one of them charged, and Amphitryon threw at her the club which he had in his hands. But the club rebounded from the cow's horns and striking Electryon's head killed him.

The station was to be adjacent to the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club's original grounds. The construction of the railway was approved in 1910. In 1911 the UERL agreed to provide funding for the line's construction and to operate its train services by extending the UERL's District Railway (DR) from Wimbledon station. Delays in the purchase of land along the railway's route and the outbreak of war prevented the works from commencing and the permission was extended several times with a final extension granted in 1922. Following the war, the UERL presented new proposals to construct an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;, now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden in tunnel where it would come to the surface and join the W&SR; route. Both DR and C&SLR; trains would run to Sutton. The plan to extend the C&SLR; was opposed by the Southern Railway (SR), the operator of the mainline services through Wimbledon and Sutton. A settlement between the companies agreed that the extension of the C&SLR; would end at Morden and the W&SR; would be taken over and its route would be constructed by the SR. When the Wimbledon to Sutton line was constructed by the SR in the late 1920s, Elm Grove was omitted from the line's stations with the nearest station being to the south at Wimbledon Chase. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Unbuilt London Underground stations Category:Proposed London Underground stations Category:Unopened tube stations in the London Borough of Merton ","title":"Elm Grove tube station"},{"id":"54216991","text":"Panther Mountain is a mountain located in Central New York of New York near Fly Creek, New York and Schuyler Lake, New York.

Elwell arrived in the United States in 1902. He applied to Stanford University and entered the electrical engineering program there. In 1906, he organized fellow students to participate in repairs at the campus, owing to the San Francisco earthquake. He graduated in 1907. He founded the Poulsen Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, later renamed Federal Telegraph Company in 1909.C. Stewart Gillmor, Fred Terman at Stanford: Building a Discipline, a University, and Silicon Valley, Stanford University Press, 2004 page 22 Elwell designed a large transformer for electric arc furnace reduction of iron ore; this became the topic of his thesis. He had published some technical papers on applications in electric metallurgy. In 1908 he switched interests to wireless communication after investigating a system for voice transmission by spark gap transmitter invented by Francis Joseph McCarty (1888-1906) in 1902. After demonstrating the concept and obtaining financial backing for further research, McCarty had been killed in an automobile accident. His investors had contacted Harris J. Ryan at Stanford, who referred them to Elwell. The apparatus Elwell had evaluated proved unsuitable, but he knew of the Poulsen arc converter, which differed from the spark gap in producing a continuous wave. This, Elwell knew, would be more suitable for wireless transmission of voice. By 1910 Elwell had demonstrated voice communication between Stockton and Sacramento, California. Equipment and technique rapidly improved and by 1911 Federal Telegraph was prepared to bid on contracts to provide Navy communication to Hawaii. After a dispute with the board of directors, Elwell resigned from Federal Telegraph in 1913 but continued radio research, joining the short-lived Universal Radio Syndicate. During World War I he was a consulting radio engineer for the French and Italian governments. Elwell was one of the founders of the Mullard company, manufacturers of vacuum tubes. After his term as director at Mullard, he returned to the United States in 1947 and was a consulting engineer for Hewlett Packard. He died in 1963. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Ian L.

This cartoon marks the fourth appearance of Daisy Duck. This cartoon also features the first appearance of Donald's look-alike, who, while unnamed in this short, is called \\"Dapper Duck\\" in his reappearance in Legend of the Three Caballeros. This short is notable for featuring a short-tempered Daisy Duck. At the end of the short Daisy displays a dangerous temper, which is ironic considering that she called out Donald for his short temper beforehand. ==Plot== Donald is inside a telephone booth in a telephone call with Daisy, who scolds him for a lack of manners and criticizes him for his poor use of the English language and threatens to end their relationship if Donald doesn't learn to speak proficiently after which she slams the phone down and the telephone booth literally explodes, depicting Daisy as extremely furious, and Donald's clothes worn-out in the process. Fearing that he will lose Daisy, Donald wanders through the streets to figure out a solution when he meets a nameless look- alike British-accented duck with a more pleasant voice and temper than him, whom he offers money to impersonate him in order to win back Daisy. The plan goes awry when the look-alike starts falling for Daisy, who is calling him Donald since he looks a lot like him, which incurs Donald's wrath and jealousy. For the rest of the date, Donald tries everything to prevent them from getting closer and win back Daisy himself. Donald follows them to an amusement park, where he tries several attempts to stop Daisy from falling for the look-alike, but fails at every turn. The final attempt is at the Tunnel of Love, where he begs the look-alike to stop but is pushed underwater. Donald, now soaked and infuriated, storms into the tunnel and a massive and brutal fight ensues offscreen. The camera then zooms to the exit of the tunnel, where it shows Donald and the look-alike holding hands and closing eyes romantically, exiting the tunnel, mistaking each other for Daisy. When they realize it, both are shocked and when Daisy walks outside the tunnel, completely drenched, angrily ranting at them incoherently, Donald and the look-alike quickly run away as Daisy continues to yell at them. ==Voice cast== * Clarence Nash as Donald Duck * Gloria Blondell as Daisy Duck * Leslie Denison as Donald-Duck-look-alike ==Availability== * The short can be found on The Chronological Donald, Volume Two. * The short can be found on Best Pals:Donald and Daisy. *The short can be found on the 2001 DVD of Walt Disney‚Äôs The Parent Trap. ==Technical Specifications== Runtime 7 min Sound Mix Mono (RCA Sound System) Color (Technicolor) Aspect Ratio 1.37 : 1 Laboratory Technicolor, USA Negative Format 35 mm Cinematographic Process Spherical Printed Film Format 35 mm ==ReferencesExternal links== * https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/4151-Donalds-Double-Trouble * * Donald's Double Trouble Category:Donald Duck short films Category:Disney animated short films, 1940s Category:American films Category:1946 animated films Category:1946 films Category:Films directed by Jack King Category:Films produced by Walt Disney ","title":"Donald's Double Trouble"},{"id":"54217451","text":"Luri (born September 5, 1996), also known as Lee Su-hyun, is a South Korean singer and actress.

Deerslayer was escaping the Hurons along the lake from the Sunken Island and began to move inland after a short distance, near Six Mile Point, and climbed the mountain, now known as Red House Hill. At the top of the hill he hid under a log, and the Hurons passed him thinking he was gone, and went down into Mohican Canyon. He then noticed he was surrounded on three sides and ran down the hill towards the lake, passing through the few Hurons left at Six Mile Point.

In Greek mythology, Cycnus (Ancient Greek: ŒöœçŒ∫ŒΩŒøœÇ means \\"swan\\") or Cygnus, was a bloodthirsty and cruel man who dwelt either in Pagasae, Thessaly or by the river Echedorus in Macedonia. == Family == Cycnus was the son of Ares by Pelopia or Pyrene. He married Themistonoe, daughter of King Ceyx of Trachis.Hesiod, Shield of Heracles 472‚Äì479 == Mythology == Cycnus killed all of his guests until he was slain by Heracles. According to Pausanias, one of the men murdered by him was Lycus of Thrace.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 1.27.6 Pseudo-ApollodorusPseudo- Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.7.7. & 2.5.11 wrote of Cycnus the Thessalian, the son of Pelopia, and Cycnus the Macedonian, the son of Pyrene, as two distinct encounters of Heracles, mentioning them separately. The Thessalian Cycnus, he relates, challenged Heracles to single combat and was killed by him;Pseudo- Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.7.7 the same is recounted by Diodorus.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 4.37.4 The Macedonian Cycnus, according to the Bibliotheca, also challenged Heracles to single combat; Ares attempted to avenge his son's death, but a thunderbolt was hurled by Zeus between the combatants, causing them to part.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.5.11; same version in Hyginus, Fabulae 31 In the Shield of Heracles, Heracles and his nephew, Iolaus, are traveling through Thessaly on their way to Trachis when they are encountered by Cycnus and Ares, each pair riding a chariot; it is mentioned that Heracles was directing to the court of King Ceyx. Apollo, whose Pagasaean sanctuary was next to the place where the characters meet, is said to have stirred Heracles up against Cycnus. Heracles accepts Cycnus' challenge and as he puts on his armor to prepare for battle, Athena appears before him, and tells Heracles that, should he kill Cycnus in the ensuing battle, he is to not take his armor as spoils, but instead focus his attention on Ares, as he will surely attack Heracles to avenge Cycnus' death. Heracles and Cycnus then clash in single combat; Cycnus hurls his spear at Heracles' shield, but fails to penetrate it, after which Heracles drives his spear through Cycnus' neck, killing him. Ares is enraged by his son's death and moves to kill Heracles when Athena appears before him, urging him to check his anger and cease fighting. Ares refuses to listen, however, and again charges at Heracles, hurling his spear at his shield; Athena, however, turns his spear aside. Ares then draws his sword and leaps at Heracles, who, seeing an opening, thrusts his spear into Ares' thigh, causing the god to fall to the ground; Ares' twin sons, Phobos and Deimos, appear to rescue him and take him back to Mount Olympus. Heracles then strips Cycnus of his armor, after which he and Iolaus continue on their journey to Trachis; Cycnus was buried by his father-in-law –°eyx and people of the neighboring cities, but Apollo, still angry over Cycnus' actions, has the river Anaurus flood the area and wash Cycnus' tomb away.Shield of Heracles, passim According to Euripides, Heracles shot Cycnus with his arrows, and this took place in Amphanae near the river Anaurus.Euripides, Heracles 390 Eustathius of Thessalonica informs that Ares changed Cycnus into a swan rather than let him die by the hand of Heracles.Eustathius on Homer, p. 254 ==Notes References == * Diodorus Siculus, The Library of History translated by Charles Henry Oldfather.

He was good-looking but arrogant and disrespectful towards numerous other youths who became enamoured of him and sought his attention. His attitude eventually made all of those youths desert him; only one of them, Phylius by name, loved him deeply enough to stay by his side nevertheless. Cycnus was still unmoved by Phylius's devotion and challenged him to three impossible tasks, hoping to get rid of him. The first task was to kill a lion that was threatening the neighborhood without use of any weapons. Phylius consumed a lot of food and wine and then vomited it back up on the spot where the lion would usually show up; the beast ate the products and became intoxicated with wine, whereupon Phylius strangled it with his own clothes. The second task was to catch two man-eating vultures of enormous size that were posing an equal threat to the neighborhood, again without use of any devices. While Phylius was contemplating a way to fulfill the task, he saw an eagle accidentally drop its prey, a dead hare, to the ground. Phylius then smeared himself with the hare's blood and lay still on the ground, pretending to be dead. When the vultures attacked him, he caught them by the feet and brought them to Cycnus. Finally, Phylius had to bring a bull to the altar of Zeus with his own bare hands. Not being able to come up with a way to perform this last task, he prayed to Heracles for help. Then he saw two bulls fighting over a heifer and waited till in the course of the fight both fell to the ground and became helpless, which made it possible for him to grab one of the bulls by the legs and drag it to the altar. At this point, Heracles caused Phylius to no more obey the orders of Cycnus. When Cycnus found that, he felt disgraced and committed suicide by throwing himself into a lake called Conope; his mother Thyrie did the same. Apollo changed them both into swans. The lake became known as the Swan Lake because of that, and when Phylius died, he was buried near it.Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses, 12 Ovid also incorporates the story of Cycnus and Phylius in his Metamorphoses: in his version, Phylius performs the three tasks but refuses to deliver the tamed bull to Cycnus. The latter is scorned and throws himself off a cliff, but transforms into a swan as he is falling and flies away. His mother Hyrie, unaware of the transformation and thinking that he is dead, dissolves away in tears, thus changing into the lake Hyrie.Ovid, Metamorphoses, 7. 371 ff == References == Category:Children of Apollo Category:LGBT themes in Greek mythology ","title":"Cycnus of Aetolia"},{"id":"54217618","text":"Alastor muticoides is a species of wasp in the family Vespidae.Alastor at www.biolib.cz. ==References== Category:Vespidae ","title":"Alastor muticoides"},{"id":"54217619","text":"Alastor muticus is a species of wasp in the family Vespidae.Alastor at www.biolib.cz. ==References== Category:Vespidae ","title":"Alastor muticus"},{"id":"54217620","text":"Alastor nigroflavus is a species of wasp in the family Vespidae.Alastor at www.biolib.cz. ==References== Category:Vespidae ","title":"Alastor nigroflavus"},{"id":"54217622","text":"Alastor nitens is a species of wasp in the family Vespidae.Alastor at www.biolib.cz. ==References== Category:Vespidae ","title":"Alastor nitens"},{"id":"54217623","text":"Alastor olivieri is a species of wasp in the family Vespidae.Alastor at www.biolib.cz. ==References== Category:Vespidae ","title":"Alastor olivieri"},{"id":"54217633","text":"Alastor pannonicus is a species of wasp in the family Vespidae.Alastor at www.biolib.cz. ==References== Category:Vespidae ","title":"Alastor pannonicus"},{"id":"54217634","text":"Daniel Alejandro Morales Reyes (), known by his stage name Danny Ocean, is a Venezuelan singer, songwriter and record producer born in Caracas, Venezuela.

It was laid down and launched by the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation, and completed on February 1, 1945. The ship's United States Maritime Commission designation was VC2-S-AP3 and hull number 149 (1203). The Maritime Commission turned it over for merchant navy operation to a civilian contractor, the Isthmian Steamship Company under the United States Merchant Marine act for the War Shipping Administration.shipbuildinghistory.com Merchant ships Victory ships She was named after Minot, Maine and Minot, North Dakota. Victory ships were designed to supersede the earlier Liberty ships. Unlike Liberty ships, Victory ships were designed to serve the US Navy after the war and to last longer. Compared to Liberty ships, Victory ships were faster, longer, wider, taller, and had a thinner stack which was set further forward on the superstructure. They also had a long, raised forecastle. ==World War II== For World War II the Minot Victory was operated by Isbrandtsen Line, and had United States Navy Armed Guard to man the deck guns. The Minot Victory arrived at Okinawa on April 11, 1945, in a fleet of 15 merchant ships serving in the Pacific War. The ship was a supplier for operations in the Battle of Okinawa lasting from the April 1 until June 22, 1945. On April 12, 1945, at 2:55pm while anchored at Hagushi, the fleet came under attack, the Minot Victory shot down a Japanese plane which had strafed her. The Kamikaze plane nevertheless crashed into her number 4 king post mast, all told wounding five of the crew on board. At the time she had a 57-man merchant crew, consisting of 27 USN Armed Guard sailors and 9 civilians. She was then repaired and put back in service shortly.Kamikaze Attacks of World War II: A Complete History of Japanese Suicide Strikes, page 133, By Robin L.

She made eight trips to Korea between March 1951 and March 1952 and helped the American forces engage against Communist aggression in South Korea. About 75 percent of the personnel taken to Korea for the Korean War came by the merchant marine ships, but the Minot Victory primarily transported goods, mail, food and other supplies. About 90% of the supplies brought to the war zone were carried by merchant marine ships.Korean War Educator, Merchant Marine, Accounts of the Korean WarSmall United States and United Nations Warships in the Korean War, By Paul M.

In May 1967 she ran aground on a coral reef in the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam, 240 miles northeast of Danang. At the time she was loaded with 6000 tons of military machinery and supplies bound for Vietnam. It took seven days and 300 men to unload enough of the cargo for her to float off of the reef. Heavy earth moving equipment were put on barges, with the Rescue and salvage ship, the , helping in the operation. Although the first attempt to get her off the reef (on May 21) failed, the tugs , , , and , finally were able to free her at high tide with only minor hull damage.

A member of the Democratic Party, he ran a brief campaign for President of the United States in the 2020 election. Raised in Logan, West Virginia, Ojeda graduated from West Virginia State University and Webster University. He initially joined the United States Army as an enlisted soldier and went through officer training after finishing college. During his 27 years in the military, Ojeda earned two Bronze Star Medals and rose to the rank of major. After retiring, he initially worked as a Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps teacher before running for office. Ojeda was elected to the West Virginia Senate in 2016. He received national attention when he became a vocal supporter of the 2018 teachers' strike and advocated for the legalization of cannabis in West Virginia. In November 2018, Ojeda announced his candidacy for president in the 2020 election, but he dropped out in January 2019 when his campaign failed to gain traction. In January 2020, Ojeda announced he would instead challenge incumbent Senator Shelley Moore Capito in the 2020 election, but failed to secure the Democratic nomination in the primary. ==Early life and education== Ojeda was born in Rochester, Minnesota, the son of Florena (Pansera) and Richard N. Ojeda. He was born into a Democratic family and he registered as a Democrat. He remarked that \\"back when I was in high school, being a Republican was like cursing\\". Ojeda's paternal grandfather was an illegal immigrant from the Mexican state of Jalisco who came to West Virginia during the coal boom to try and make a living, and later gained citizenship. One of Ojeda's grandparents died in a mining accident after fighting in World War II. Ojeda's father was born in the United States, but moved to Mexico and lived there until the age of eight. Ojeda's father worked as a nurse anaesthetist. Ojeda also has Italian ancestry. Ojeda graduated from Logan High School in 1988. He earned a bachelor's degree in General Education from West Virginia State University and a master's degree in Business and Organizational Security from Webster University. ==Military service and teaching career== Ojeda (left) in Haiti in 2010, assisting with relief efforts after the 2010 earthquake Ojeda said \\"Where I come from, when you graduate high school, there‚Äôs only three choices‚Äîdig coal, sell dope, or join the Army. And I chose the military\\". He served 25 years in the United States Army, starting as an enlisted soldier before going through officer training and rising to the rank of major. He earned two Bronze Stars. During his service, he spent time in South Korea, Honduras, Jordan, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Iraq, where he was attached to the 20th Engineer Brigade. After retiring from the military, Ojeda worked as a Junior ROTC instructor at Chapmanville Regional High School from 2013 to 2017, resigning due to time constraints related to his service as State Senator, now in addition with his run for Congress.Takitch, Nathan, 'W.Va. State Senator resigns from Logan County JROTC program', wsaz.com, May 29, 2017. Accessed January 17, 2019. He helped start a Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps at a local high school. He established a social services nonprofit, the Logan Empowerment Action and Development, which engaged in community cleanup, Christmas toy drives, provided meals for the needy, and raised money for shoes for kids. During this time, Ojeda also started penning letters to the editor of the Logan Banner. As a result, Ojeda was invited by Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to the 2013 State of the Union as a guest. Ojeda decided to enter politics while listening to Sen. Manchin discuss disparities in allocation of \\"manufacturing hubs\\" to different regions of West Virginia. ==Political career== Ojeda entered politics in 2014, running for Congress in West Virginia's 3rd District. He garnered 34% of the vote in the Democratic primary, losing to incumbent Nick Rahall whom Ojeda challenged because he believed Rahall was not doing enough to advance the interests of the district. West Virginia Senate Ojeda was assaulted at a primary campaign event on May 8, 2016, in Logan County, West Virginia. The assailant, Jonathan S. Porter, who had ties to Ojeda's opponent, received 1‚Äì5 years in prison, and a $500 fine as a part of a plea deal. Ojeda went on to win the Democratic Primary for the 7th District of the West Virginia Senate, defeating incumbent Art Kirkendoll. In the general election, held on November 8, 2016, he defeated Republican Jordan Bridges by almost 18 points. In the West Virginia Senate, Ojeda sponsored the West Virginia Medical Cannabis Act, legislation to legalize medical marijuana, which was signed into law by Governor Jim Justice on April 19, 2017. In the Senate, he called for increases in teacher wages, arguing that low pay would lead to strikes and teachers leaving the state. In January 2018, he criticized West Virginia Governor Jim Justice's proposed 1‚Äì2% increase in teacher wages, saying it was insufficient. Ojeda has stated \\"I don't think I've ever voted for a Democrat for president\\" and supported Donald Trump in 2016.Can A Trump Voter From West Virginia Win The 2020 Democratic Primary?. FiveThirtyEight. November 12, 2018. He told Politico that he voted for Trump because he initially believed Trump would do something for West Virginians. By 2018, he expressed regret for voting for Trump, saying that \\"he hasn't done shit\\" and he is \\"taking care of the daggone people he's supposed to be getting rid of\\". Ojeda said he supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary. Ojeda resigned from the West Virginia Senate on January 14, 2019.  Teacher strikes  Ojeda rose to prominence for his early support of and leading role in the West Virginia teacher strikes. A month before the strike, Ojeda, in a speech on the Senate floor, called on his fellow legislators to heed the complaints and requests of teachers lest a strike be inevitable. He then introduced several bills, including ones addressing public employees' healthcare needs, raising their wages, and giving teachers tax deductions on purchased classroom supplies. Due to his active and vocal support of the strikes, Ojeda was said by some to have attained something of a \\"folk hero\\" status with teachers and other unionists. He was regularly met by chants of his last name and other expressions of appreciation and commendation while traveling the state to speak out in support of the strikers (and later his Congressional bid). Ojeda traveled to California to support the 2019 Los Angeles teachers' strike, proclaiming \\"Don‚Äôt make us go West Virginia on you\\" in an op-ed published in The Intercept. 2018 U.S. House campaign Ojeda ran for West Virginia's 3rd congressional district, a seat which was vacated by Republican Evan Jenkins, who filed instead to run in the primary for the U.S. Senate. His campaign was staffed in part by local residents who were working on the campaign without pay, and held private jobs while working on the campaign. According to Ojeda, his campaign only accepted donations from individual donors and labor unions. He won the Democratic primary on May 9, 2018, defeating Shirley Love, Janice Hagerman, and Paul Davis. The web publication Salon.com said that Ojeda's race was a potential bellwether due to the perceived alienation of a significant part of the electorate that supported Trump's candidacy, noting that \\"Ojeda is no stranger to converting Trump supporters: He won his state Senate election by 18 points, in a district Trump carried by 59.\\"Could Democrats flip a West Virginia district Trump won by 49 points?, Salon.com, Igor Derysh, October 13, 2018. Retrieved October 13, 2018. During the campaign, Ojeda agreed to an interview for Michael Moore's documentary, Fahrenheit 11/9. Ojeda's off the cuff unpolished pronouncements subsequently appeared in the trailer for the movie; \\"I‚Äôm sick and tired of people telling me America is the greatest country‚Äîbecause we can whip your ass?\\", and \\"I don‚Äôt give a shit who you are. I‚Äôll fight you in the damn street right now\\". The comments were used by opponent Carol Miller's campaign to bring under question Ojeda's patriotism while labeling him as unhinged. Ojeda took issue with Miller's criticism in a campaign ad. Ojeda also made an appearance on The Young Turks interview show Rebel HQ, where he discussed his economic policies. As the polling began to indicate a tight race, President Trump traveled to West Virginia in October to campaign for Miller. On the stump, Trump mocked Ojeda while making a point of pronouncing Ojeda's last name while affecting an Hispanic accent. On November 6, 2018, Ojeda was defeated in the general election by 12 points, winning 44% of the vote to Miller's 56%. For Democrats, this was a 32-point improvement in performance from the previous election, where the Democrat won only 24% to the Republican's 68%. According to FiveThirtyEight, Ojeda outperformed his district's partisan lean by 25%, the strongest showing for a non-incumbent. However, the state Democratic Party did not field a candidate in the 2016 election or fund any who filed that year. In 2014, incumbent Democratic Rep. U.S. Nick Rahall won 45 percent of the vote when defeated by Evan Jenkins. Rahall had held the seat as a Democrat since 1976, winning by 20 or more points in all but two elections. 2020 presidential campaign In November 2018, Ojeda filed with the Federal Election Commission, officially becoming a candidate for President of the United States. His campaign was announced on November 11, at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky, which consisted mostly of union members. His campaign focuses included ending government corruption and returning the Democratic Party to a party that benefited the working class. As no incumbent state legislator has ever mounted a serious bid for the presidency, Ojeda was considered a \\"longshot\\" and \\"underdog\\" candidate. He resigned from the West Virginia Senate on January 9, 2019, to focus on his presidential bid. A few days after, Ojeda asked the Senate Minority Leader (a Democrat) if he could rescind his resignation, with the Senate Minority Leader telling Ojeda to talk to the Senate President (a Republican) because that is to whom he sent the resignation letter. The Republican Governor, Jim Justice, seated a lobbyist in Ojeda's vacant seat. Ojeda dropped out of the race on January 26, 2019, citing his inability to get face time with the networks, and stating one must have access to wealth and power to run for office. He broadcast his withdrawal in an hour-long Facebook live feed. Endorsements 2020 Senate campaign On January 13, 2020, Ojeda announced his campaign for the United States Senate, hoping to challenge incumbent Shelley Moore Capito. On June 9, 2020, Ojeda was defeated in the primary election by five points, winning 33% of the vote, as opposed to Paula Jean Swearengin's 38%. On the night of the primary, Ojeda publicly conceded the election to Swearengin in a post shared from his campaign's official Facebook page, while hinting that his time in politics is not yet over. At the time of his concession, Ojeda also endorsed Swearengin as the Democratic Party's nominee in the general election. ==Political positions== Ideological orientation Ojeda has been described by some as a populist of the \\"left-wing variety\\", and a \\"staunch progressive\\". He identifies as a traditional working-class Democrat and laments what he perceives as a Democratic party that is increasingly drifting away from its working-class roots and becoming a party of the elite. In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, he says he voted for Independent Senator Bernie Sanders. He has also been described as a moderate Democrat and he stated that he voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. He describes himself as a \\"conservative on most cultural issues\\" who supports coal jobs and border security.  Taxes  Ojeda was one of the few WV lawmakers who came out outspokenly in favor of raising taxes on corporations and the rich, calling for higher corporate taxes (particularly on coal and gas corporations that were the major economic players in WV) to offset spending cuts that had negatively affected public services and employees in the state.  Labor rights  Ojeda is devoutly pro-union and has received $121,440 from several unions, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Teamsters' Union. Ojeda opposes right-to-work laws. Gun control On gun control, Ojeda has been described as pro-gun, and has stated he agreed with Carol Miller's position that increased services for the mentally-ill would help ease gun violence, his own stances on guns have also been described as similar to Miller's overall, such as mass shootings, and in doing so he would launch a campaign to help remove stigmas regarding mentally-ill individuals. He has also stated that he supports the second amendment, and does not believe more restrictions are needed. However, on August 8, 2019, Richard Ojeda's views had seemingly evolved on the subject. Following the Dayton and El Paso shootings, Ojeda called pro-gun rights politicians \\"spineless pieces of shit\\" who \\"didn't have the balls\\" to take on the NRA. He also called for heavier gun restrictions, citing recent mass shootings which accounted for a total of 74 deaths. Foreign policy Ojeda, on his Twitter account has posted several tweets opposed to Saudi Arabia and the intervention it leads in support of the Yemeni government against the Iranian-backed Houthis that had taken over much of Yemen's north including its capital, Sanaa, he stated that the US should end support for Saudi Arabia and end arms deals with the nation, he also condemned the country for the alleged involvement of the Saudi government in Khashoggi's death. Regarding Iran, Ojeda has stated he would not support a war with Iran. Abortion Ojeda self-identifies as pro-life but also stated he supports abortion rights and that he would only nominate judges who likewise shared his support for abortion. In 2018, he said regarding the term pro-life, which is used to describe those who are against abortions as, \\"I‚Äôm also calling bullshit on the idea that opposing abortion makes you pro-life...If you just want to keep working class women from making their own decisions, you might be pro-birth but you‚Äôre not pro-life.\\" He has also voiced opposition to the Helms Amendment that limits the United States in assistance to abortion through foreign aid, saying, \\"a woman raped by the Taliban or Boko Haram should not be forced by the callousness of our government to bear her rapist‚Äôs child\\". In 2016, Ojeda described himself as \\"pro-life, with exceptions\\". ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always said that I‚Äôm pro-life,‚Äù he told WCHS during the campaign, ‚Äúbut I also, being someone who almost lost my wife and child during child birth, I think it‚Äôs also important in certain circumstances that the mother have the ability to choose her life.‚Äù  Healthcare  Ojeda supports Medicare For All. He has also stated that Congress and the president should be barred from taking out extra insurance, and would instead have to rely on the standard healthcare which would be afforded every American citizen for the course of their terms to incentivize them in promoting and maintaining quality comprehensive universal healthcare coverage.  Environment  Ojeda has called for sustainable energy. He is in favor of a Green New Deal. Ojeda has noted that he sees a limited role of the anthracite coal (like the one mined in his home state) in steel-making for the foreseeable future but has acknowledged that coal is \\"not gonna come back\\", and expressed his desire to find a way for miners to transition into other well-paying jobs. During his 2018 congressional campaign, Ojeda praised the Trump administration's plan to roll back environmental regulations of the Obama administration and stated it would benefit the coal industry. \\"President Trump made a promise to West Virginia to help put our coal miners back to work and in many places our coal miners are working again,\\" Ojeda said in a statement \\"This will help West Virginia. This will help coal mining families. The fact is that President Trump's EPA's proposal will help put more West Virginians to work in the third congressional district.\\"  Immigration  Ojeda supports Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and a pathway to citizenship for \\"Dreamers\\". In his reasoning for voting for Trump in 2016, Ojeda cited Trump's stance on reducing immigration and limiting the admission of refugees as reasons for his support. ‚ÄúWhen you hear about illegal aliens getting benefits and you have people here starving to death and can‚Äôt get nothing, it‚Äôs just a slap in the face,‚Äù Ojeda said in a New Yorker interview. ‚ÄúWhen you start talking about bringing in refugees and when they get here they get medical and dental and they get set up with some funds‚Äîwhat do we get? So when people hear Donald Trump saying we‚Äôre going to take benefits away from people who come here illegally and give them to people who work, that sounds pretty good.‚Äù  Cannabis  Ojeda has called for the legalization of marijuana and clemency for those incarcerated for possession. During his tenure as State Senator, Ojeda spearheaded the passage of a bill legalizing medical marijuana. He advocates directing funds raised from taxes on cannabis sales to fund public works.  Pharmaceutical companies  Ojeda has taken stances against the pharmaceutical industry, focusing in particular on its role in sparking the opioid epidemic.  Campaign finance, political ethics, and transparency  As described by Ojeda, his campaign focused on \\"lobbying and corruption in Washington\\", and has proposed measures to address political ethics. Ojeda has proposed requiring body-cams on lobbyists in order to increase government transparency and public oversight. He is a supporter of WolfPAC, and has pledged not to take corporate donations for his campaign. Ojeda has proposed that federally elected officials and Cabinet officials must donate to charity any net worth exceeding one million dollars to prevent exploitation of political office for personal financial gain. He proposed that, upon retirement from public office, such officials must be subject to an annual earnings limit of $120,000 (in addition to a $130,000 pension), \\"subject to automatic yearly cost of living adjustments.\\" Ojeda has called for implementing \\"donor vouchers,\\" allocated funds that would give individual voters small amounts of money to donate to the candidate of their choice, to enhance the financial sway of individual, poorer voters. ==Electoral historyReferencesExternal links== * * * Fahrenheit 11/9 partial Ojeda interview Category:1970 births Category:20th-century American military personnel Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American army personnel of the Iraq War Category:American army personnel of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American politicians of Mexican descent Category:Candidates in the 2018 United States elections Category:Candidates in the 2020 United States presidential election Category:Hispanic and Latino American military personnel Category:Left-wing populism in the United States Category:Living people Category:Military personnel from Minnesota Category:Military personnel from West Virginia Category:Minnesota Democrats Category:People from Logan County, West Virginia Category:Politicians from Rochester, Minnesota Category:Right- wing populism in the United States Category:United States Army officers Category:Webster University alumni Category:West Virginia Democrats Category:West Virginia state senators Category:West Virginia State University alumni Category:Candidates in the 2020 United States elections ","title":"Richard Ojeda"},{"id":"54217800","text":"Meg Phillips (born 2 February 1996) is an Australian cricketer who plays as an all-rounder for Tasmanian Roar and Hobart Hurricanes.
