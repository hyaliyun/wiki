NAPEs travel to the hypothalamus in the brain and suppress appetite. This mechanism could be relevant for treating obesity.Dunham, Will (Nov 26, 2008). \\"Gut chemical may inspire new way to fight obesity\\". Reuters Accessed 27 Nov. 2008 ==Endocannabinoid precursor== N-Acylphosphatidylethanolamines are also an important intermediaries in the biosynthesis of endocannabinoids. NAPEs are formed from phosphatidylethanolamines, a group of cell membrane phospholipids characteristic of nervous tissue. After being cleaved by phospholipases, NAPEs can be transformed into N-acylethanolamines, including the endocannabinoid anandamide. While NAPE-PLD is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing said release of N-acylethanolamine (NAE) from N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), this specific subtype of phospholipase D is not responsible for the formation of the anandamide. The crystal structure of human N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) reveals how this membrane enzyme generates anandamide and other bioactive lipid amides from membrane NAPEs. A hydrophobic cavity in NAPE-PLD provides an entryway for the substrate NAPE into the active site, where a binuclear zinc center orchestrates its hydrolysis. Unexpectedly, the structure unveils bile acids bind the membrane enzyme, enhancing dimer assembly and enabling catalysis. These findings suggest NAPE-PLD might orchestrate a direct crosstalk between bile acids and lipid amide signals. ==See also== * Ghrelin * Leptin ==References== Category:Intestinal hormones Category:Fatty acid amides ","title":"N-Acylphosphatidylethanolamine"},{"id":"20438337","text":"Antoine Carr√© (born 4 March 1943 in Fleury-les-Aubrais) was a member of the National Assembly of France.

In part this stagnation was due to the forced abandonment of the country by the missionary forces from America, Portugal, Denmark and Brazil who, up to that point had led the evangelistic spread of Christianity among the Baptist churches. As a result of the lack of trained nationals (no Angolan Baptist pastor had formal training in theology or as pastors) for the conduct of evangelism, the denomination did not exceed 27 churches between 1970 and the end of 1980. This situation began to change in the mid-1980s with the return to Angola of American and Brazilian missionaries and with the consequent initiation of a Mobile Bible Institute (directed by missionary pastor Curtis Dixon). This Mobile Bible Institute played an important part in the awakening of vocational service among Angolans and the training of leaders that became evangelists and pastors in the years after 1990.

It was the ninth tropical cyclone of the 2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, and the seventh tropical cyclone in the Bay of Bengal that year. ==Meteorological history== On November 24 an area of low pressure formed over land in Sri Lanka. Later that day the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the low-pressure area's chance of becoming a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as 'poor', due to the minimal convection near the low- level circulation center. The next morning the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the low-pressure area, stating it had a 'good' chance of becoming a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours, as the Low Level Circulation Center was moving into the Bay of Bengal. Two hours later the IMD upgraded the area of low pressure to Depression BOB 07. Three hours later the India Meteorological Department reported that the depression had intensified into a Deep Depression whilst remaining stationary. Later that day the JTWC upgraded the Deep Depression to Tropical Cyclone 06B and reported that the depression had wind speeds equivalent to a tropical storm, on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. Early on November 26, the India Meteorological Department upgraded the deep depression to a Cyclonic Storm and named it Nisha. Later that day as Nisha moved northwest towards India, both the JTWC and the IMD reported that Nisha had reached its peak wind speeds of 55 kts (63 mph 102 km/h ) 45 knots (52 mph 83 km/h ). Early the next day the IMD reported that Cyclonic Storm Nisha had made landfall in Tamil Nadu, India, at 0030 UTC. Later that day as the IMD reported that Nisha had weakened into a deep depression, The JTWC issued their final advisory on Nisha. The IMD then reported that Nisha had weakened into a Depression and then issued their last advisory the next day, reporting that Nisha had weakened into a well-marked area of low pressure. ==Preparations and impact== {  style=\\"float:right; clear:right; margin-left:0.5em\\" - ! colspan=3Death toll -  Sri Lanka  15  -  Tamil Nadu, India  189  -  Total  204  } ===Sri Lanka=== Fifteen people were killed when Nisha hit northern Sri Lanka on November 25, 2008, causing heavy rains and flooding that reportedly displaced between 60,000 and 70,000 people in Vanni and 20,000 people in Jaffna district. Jaffna recorded the highest rainfall since 1918, of 520.1 mm of rain in one week, with the 26 November total rainfall (389.8 mm) being the highest in nine decades. ===India=== At least 189 people were killed by the heavy rains and floods caused by the Nisha in Tamil Nadu. Some places have recorded extreme rainfall, notably Orathanadu, Thanjavur District where over 660 mm of rain fell in a 24-hour period, breaking the 65-year-old record of highest daily rainfall in Tamil Nadu. In two days, Orathanadu registered 990 mm of rainfall. Previously the highest amount of rainfall in a day was 570 mm registered by Cuddalore on May 18, 1943.

Brothers Ozzie and Daniel Silna made a fortune as pioneers in the manufacture of polyester. In 1974, they wanted to own an NBA team. After an attempt to buy the Detroit Pistons fell short, the Silnas purchased the ABA's Carolina Cougars franchise with the expectation of moving it into the NBA with the impending merger of the two leagues.Spirits of St. Louis. - RememberTheABA.com. On April 26, 2016, Ozzie died of cancer at the age of 83. ==The Spirits of St. Louis== The Silna brothers moved the Cougars to St. Louis, Missouri, because it was then the largest city in the United States without a professional basketball team and they thought this would make their team more likely to join the NBA. In 1974, the Cougars, roster and all, were overhauled and became the ABA's Spirits of St. Louis from 1974 through 1976. The 1974-75 Spirits had upset the reigning ABA champion New York Nets in the 1975 Eastern Division Finals before losing to the eventual champion Kentucky Colonels, but in the 1975-76 season the Spirits' play was uneven and their attendance waned.Pluto. - pp.387-388. The Spirits' 1975-76 season was not a success either on the court or in attendance.Pluto. - pp.372-390,427,429. In May 1976, due to attendance problems in St. Louis, the Spirits announced that they were going to move to Salt Lake City, Utah, to play as the Utah Rockies when a lease agreement for the Salt Palace was arranged. This followed an attempted merger of the Spirits and the Utah Stars franchise during the 1975-76 season, a merger that, had it occurred, contemplated the team leaving St. Louis for Utah.Pluto. - pp.386-387. But the Stars folded before the merger could occur and instead, the Spirits bought the rights to some of the Stars' best players, including future Hall of Famer Moses Malone. In another effort to be included in the ABA-NBA merger, the Silna brothers proposed selling the Spirits to a Utah group, buying the Kentucky Colonels franchise, and moving the Colonels to Buffalo to replace the Buffalo Braves, who were then planning to move to Hollywood, Florida. Spirits of St. Louis Detailed Year to Year Notes. - RememberTheABA.com. The Spirits were not included in the ABA-NBA merger, with the St. Louis and Kentucky players being put into a special dispersal draft. Marvin Barnes went to the Detroit Pistons for $500,000, Moses Malone went to the Portland Trail Blazers for $300,000, Ron Boone went to the Kansas City Kings for $250,000, Randy Denton went to the New York Knicks for $50,000 and Mike Barr also went to the Kansas City, for $15,000.Pluto. - p.435. The folding of the Spirits dissolved a very talented basketball team, one that likely would have competed successfully in the NBA. Twelve players from the final two Spirits of St. Louis rosters (1974‚Äì76) played in the NBA during the 1976‚Äì77 season and beyond: Maurice Lucas, Ron Boone, Marvin Barnes, Caldwell Jones, Lonnie Shelton, Steve Green, Gus Gerard, Moses Malone, Don Adams, Don Chaney, M. L. Carr and Freddie Lewis.Pluto. - pp.388-389. ==Deal== While the Silna brothers were left out of the NBA, they nonetheless managed to turn it into one of the greatest deals in the history of professional sports.Darren Rovell, NBA Edition: Silna Family \\"Fortune\\" And The Draft, CNBC, June 28, 2007Pluto. - pp.431-433. Of the seven teams that finished the final ABA season, the NBA would only accept 4 in the merger. The Virginia Squires folded shortly after the season. The Colonels negotiated a $3.3 million buyout from the remaining ABA teams. However, the Spirits held out for more and in June 1976, the owners of the four merging ABA teams, the Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New York Nets and the San Antonio Spurs, agreed to pay the St. Louis owners $2.2 million in cash up front and an additional 1/7 share of the four remaining teams' television broadcast revenue \\"for as long as the NBA or its successors continues in its existence\\" in return for the Spirits folding.Pluto. - pp.428-433. This was based on the principle that all seven remaining ABA franchise should get an equal share in the TV revenue of the merged teams. Thus the Silnas would receive checks from the NBA on a yearly basis, representing a 4/7 share of the television money that would normally go to every NBA franchise, or roughly two percent of the entire league's TV money.Pluto. - p.433. Additionally, the Silnas inserted a clause in the contract stipulating that their share could not drop below the amount generated from a 28-team league. With the NBA expanding to 30 teams, each of the former ABA teams was required to pay the Silnas a 1/196 share (1/7 of 1/28) of total league TV revenue, instead of 1/210 (1/7 of 1/30), giving the Silnas a 1/49 share. The contract defined broadcast revenue very broadly, so that as their attorney during the merger negotiations, Donald Schupak, said it \\"could not be evaded or made obsolete\\". The Silnas brothers wanted to join the NBA and had originally hoped to parlay the deal into an NBA franchise of their own. The first year the deal yielded revenue for the Silnas, in 1980-81, they received only a modest $521,749. However, as the NBA's popularity exploded in 1980s and 1990s, the league's television rights were sold to CBS and then NBC, and additional deals were struck with the TNT and TBS cable networks; league television revenue soared into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Thanks to the deal, the Silnas made millions through 1980s and at least $4.4 million per year through 1990s. From 1999 through 2002 the deal netted the Spirits' owners at least $12.53 million per year; from 2003-2006 their take was at least $15.6 million per year. By 2010-11 they were receiving $17.45 million annually. In 2014, the deal was costing each former ABA team $5 million a year. The Silna brothers have received roughly $300 million in revenue as of 2014, despite the fact that the Spirits never played an NBA game. The two Silna brothers each get 45% of that television revenue per year and their attorney Schupak receives 10%. They credit their terrific deal to planning they had done ahead of the merger for the Virginia Squires owners; the Silnas had expected the Spirits and Colonels to enter the NBA but for the ailing Squires to be left out, and the Silnas thought up the television revenue deal as a way to treat the Squires' owners fairly if the Squires did not join the NBA with the other ABA teams. However, the deal cut by the Silna brothers and the incredible amount of revenue it has produced over the years has itself become legend. There have been numerous attempts by the NBA and the former ABA clubs to buy out the deal. It has been reported that a $6 million settlement was under consideration in the 1980s. With New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson purchasing the New Orleans Hornets from the NBA in 2012 and planning to rename the team, there had been talk that the NBA might negotiate a deal to end the TV deals for the Silna brothers in exchange for rights to the Spirits name.http://www.hornets247.com/blog/2012/05/03/angels-and-spirit-are-the-two- leading-names-for-a-hornets-rebrand/ This ended up not happening, as the Hornets were renamed the Pelicans. In January 2014, a conditional settlement agreement between the NBA, the former ABA clubs and the Silnas was announced. As part of the deal, the Silnas are reported to be receiving a $500 million upfront payment from the former ABA teams. In return, the former ABA teams will get majority stake in the Spirits of St. Louis Basketball Club, L.P., which will retain control of a portion of the TV revenue streams of the former ABA teams, with the option to purchase the remaining stake held by the Silnas in the future. Also, the Silnas will drop their litigation against the league seeking a share of additional media revenue streams, with the NBA agreeing to grant some of the disputed funds to the Spirits. The settlement was completed in April 2014. ==Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme== The Silnas lost the money that they had invested with Bernie Madoff, with the trustee for the victims of the scheme alleging that Silna and his associates had received $24 million in unearned income from Madoff.Sandomir, Richard. \\"No Team, No Ticket Sales, but Plenty of Cash; Former A.B.A. Owners Ozzie and Daniel Silna Earn Millions From N.B.A.\\", The New York Times, September 6, 2012.

It is famous for its art works, including Caravaggio's The Seven Works of Mercy. A charity brotherhood (Pio Monte della Misericordia meaning \\"Pious Mount of Mercy\\" in Italian) was founded in August 1601 by seven young nobles, who met every Friday at the Hospital for Incurables and ministered to the sick. In 1602 they established an institution and commissioned a small church, built by Gian Giacomo di Conforto, near the staircase leading to the Cathedral, on the corner of the Via dei Tribunali and the Vico dei Zuroli. In 1605, they received an apostolic letter from Pope Paul V, according special privileges to the high altar. The church was consecrated in September 1606. From 1658 to 1678 the edifice was enlarged, also with the annexation of neighbouring structures, by architect Francesco Antonio Picchiati, forming a complex with a palace and a renewed church. The latter, at the high altar, houses Caravaggio's Seven Works of Mercy'. There are also paintings by Luca Giordano, Carlo Sellitto, Fabrizio Santafede, Battistello Caracciolo and others. The noblemen of the brotherhood at Pio Monte della Misericordia were looking for painters \\"to give permanent visual expression to their sense of charitable mission‚Äù. Graham-Dixon 2010, 340. Regarding the sharp contrasts of the chiaroscuro in Caravaggio's painting‚Äôs, the German art historian Ralf van B√ºhren explains the bright light as a metaphor for mercy, which \\"helps the audience to explore mercy in their own lives\\". ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Ralf van B√ºhren, \\"Caravaggio‚Äôs ‚ÄòSeven Works of Mercy‚Äô in Naples.

The first number-one song on both charts was \\"End of the Road\\" by Boyz II Men. On June 25, 1997, the chart was renamed to Rhythmic Top 40 as a way to distinguish stations that continued to play a broad based rhythmic mix from those whose mix leaned heavily toward R&B; and hip-hop. Prior to the Billboard Hot 100 becoming an all-genre songs chart in December 1998, the Rhythmic Top 40's panel of radio stations monitored by BDS made up one portion of stations measured towards the airplay component of the Hot 100 (alongside Mainstream Top 40, Adult Top 40, Adult Contemporary, and Modern Rock stations).

The pretext for calling the meeting was very likely a proposed anti-Turkish crusade, but the Congress was actually concerned mostly with European diplomacy issues, of which preeminent were peaceful relations and the balance of power in central Europe and negotiating a common response to the Turkish threat through the project of a central European league of states.Polish Wikipedia articles Zjazd krakowski and Wierzynek The participants - guests of the Polish king were Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, King Louis I of Hungary, King Valdemar IV of Denmark, King Peter I of Cyprus, Siemowit III of Masovia, Bolko II of ≈öwidnica, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk, Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania, Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania, Otto V, Duke of Bavaria and Louis VI the Roman. The Congress, which took place in lavish surroundings, intended as a manifestation of the Polish king's power and wealth, echoed throughout Europe. It included a famous banquet at the house of the Krak√≥w merchant Miko≈Çaj Wierzynek, organized by the city council. The occasion for the feast, which according to Jan D≈Çugosz lasted for 21 days, was the recent wedding of Charles IV and Casimir's granddaughter Elizabeth of Pomerania. The several medieval sources available do not always agree on the timing and other issues. Possibly there were two separate congresses, one in 1363 that had to do with the marriage, and another in 1364, the more political congregation of the monarchs.

It originally aired on December 2, 2008. ==Plot== When a fitness guru, Emmy (Samantha Shelton), faints and breaks her ankle, she is sent to Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, under the care of House and his diagnostics team. When House's team realizes she had gastric bypass surgery, Taub accuses her of being a hypocrite. Emmy develops numbness in her left leg. Emmy gradually loses muscle and nerve control throughout her body and hallucinates. Eventually, Emmy gets frustrated and asks for chocolate cake to console herself; however, she becomes healthier after eating it. House realizes Emmy lacks an enzyme that requires carbohydrates. She has hereditary coproporphyria. The treatment is a diet rich in carbohydrates and glucose, but because of her gastric bypass and changes in her lifestyle, she has not been getting enough of either. Emmy rejects the treatment, opting for a pill that will manage her symptoms, but not make her healthy. Foreman begins his clinical trials on Huntington's disease, with Thirteen reluctantly partaking in the drug regimen. She sees a patient called Janice, and has a flashback, seeing her mother thrashing around the same way. Thirteen follows her medication schedule very strictly, but doesn't show up for her appointments. She tells Foreman that she doesn't want to have to see the state she'll be in in a few years. Foreman tells her to get over it and show up for her appointments on time, or not at all. She has another flashback of her mother getting in a car with herself watching from her window. At her appointment, Foreman tells Thirteen to get to know Janice, so Thirteen helps Janice with her jacket. At the end of the episode, Thirteen goes to talk to Foreman. She tells him that Janice in fact didn't scare her about her future, but it reminded her of her past. She admits that she wanted her mother to die, because her mother yelled at her all the time about nothing, even in front of her friends. Her father told her it was the disease, but she hated her mother nonetheless. She starts to cry and Foreman hugs her. Cuddy uses House's office while hers is renovated. She becomes an intrusive participant in the team's differential diagnosis, much to House's annoyance. They settle on sharing his desk until House disrupts her while she is on the phone with a donor. Cuddy retaliates by pouring a vial of hydrogen sulfide in his office, forcing House to work in a room smelling of rotten eggs‚Äîhe chooses to leave. The next morning, he heads down to her office, smashes her toilet with a sledgehammer, and convinces the architect he is Cuddy's boss and that he must approve all renovations. House tells Wilson he is having the toilet replaced with a bidet; Wilson notes House appears to be trying to keep Cuddy in his office, the exact opposite of what he claims to want. Cuddy has the furniture removed from House's office. They confront each other, and House accuses her of wanting him, claiming she wears provocative clothing to get his attention. She claims their rivalry is \\"going somewhere\\", but when House gropes her instead of kissing her, Cuddy leaves. To reconcile, House arranges with Cuddy's mom to retrieve Cuddy's medical school desk from storage and install it into her renovated office. Meanwhile, Kutner tells Taub he has started an online diagnostic clinic, but used House's name, not his own. Taub blackmails Kutner for 30% of the profits in exchange for not telling House. Kutner has trouble with a patient who insists her breast implants are causing problems. The patient shows up at Princeton-Plainsboro to complain to House, whom she believes she has been emailing. Kutner and Taub send her to the emergency room so Cameron can deal with her. When the woman starts singing \\"Coconut\\" uncontrollably and bleeding from her ears, Chase tells Kutner to ask House to help. Kutner refuses because his scam will be revealed if he involves House. Chase agrees to help for 25% of the profits. When Kutner and Taub check on the woman, they discover she died. House furiously confronts them with the patient's body on the autopsy table. House blasts Kutner for setting up the site and Taub for not stopping Kutner. House does a series of chest compressions and resuscitates the patient, astounding Kutner and Taub. The whole thing was a prank: House knew about Kutner's website and hired the woman to play a patient; similarly, he bribed Chase and Cameron to play along. House allows Kutner to continue the site, provided he pays House 50% of the profits. Cuddy heads to House's office to thank him for the desk and what she thinks it symbolizes for their relationship. As she approaches House's office, she spots him flirting with the woman who played Kutner's victim. She turns away, walking back to the elevator dismayed.

It aired on December 9, 2008. ==Plot== A troubled sixteen-year-old, Natalie, is singing at her school's Christmas program when she suddenly becomes disoriented and vomits. She is brought to Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, where the team discovers her liver is failing for an unknown reason. In House's office, they are exchanging Christmas gifts when House receives a mysterious gift wrapped in green wrapping paper. Kutner reads the note aloud, as it says \\"Greg- made me think of you.\\" The present turns out to be Dr. Joseph Bell's Manual of The Operations of Surgery. House, annoyed, throws it in the trash. Afterwards, House conducts a differential diagnosis, with the team entertaining ideas such as alcohol abuse and pill-popping. None of the symptoms fit with the entire picture. When Chase and Kutner question Natalie's classmates, Chase gets angry enough with their cruel attitudes to let them know they're in serious trouble and they should act like human beings and tell him something that isn't bullshit; one of the popular girls says they slipped \\"magic mushrooms\\" into Natalie's food, and when she asks if Natalie will be OK Chase snaps at her that he has no way of knowing. Meanwhile, Foreman and Thirteen are still involved in the Huntington's drug trial. A woman whose disease is quite advanced drops out of the trial, saying that Foreman told her to \\"get over it\\" when her medication made her nauseous. Thirteen, annoyed, accuses Foreman of being like House. After briefly suggesting the gift was from a former patient and old flame Irene Adler (a reference to Sherlock Holmes) Wilson tells the team that it is in fact last year's gift from Wilson himself, which House never opened. Wilson accuses House of needing to create the false illusion of a gift because he just cannot be nice to anyone. They end up betting that he cannot get thanked by a patient. Later, after Natalie's tox-screen was clean, Taub and Kutner find painkillers in her school locker, which makes them think she tried to kill herself. They later suspect tuberculosis, thinking she might have picked up something from the soup kitchen she normally attends. To win the bet he made with Wilson, House puts on his lab coat (only the fourth time House is seen doing so, with the other occasions being the episodes \\"Mob Rules\\", \\"Sex Kills\\" and \\"Games\\") and acts very kind and caring toward his patients. A slightly dim woman, Whitney, who comes to the clinic with a terrible headache, compliments House on his hospitality, to which he responds, \\"If you can't be nice, why be a doctor?\\" He later deduces she is pregnant, much to her surprise. He then sarcastically insults her for not recognizing the common symptoms of early pregnancy, such as missing her period and putting on weight. She insists that she and her fiance are virgins, and asks for House to run a paternity test after he suggests that she has had an affair. He does run the test, but after sharing the results with them, he looks surprised, and leaves. He comes back later with the same set of results, and with a look of disbelief, states that Whitney is pregnant as a result of human parthenogenesis, a never-seen-before scientific phenomenon. Her baby only has maternal genes due to a spontaneous gene mutation which fertilized her egg, without ever needing male sperm. Her baby will be a virgin birth. Later, however, it is revealed that House faked those lab tests and just told them that story to cover up Whitney's blatant infidelity (as shown by the real results of the test), thereby 'saving' their potential marriage in House's eyes but saddling the fiance with a cheating potential future wife and someone else's baby (this is the \\"mistaking Good for Evil\\" that Cuddy refers to later in the episode but fails herself to rectify). Things make a turn for the worse for Natalie, as she has a seizure, ruling out TB but bringing her brain into the differential, along with liver and lungs. Kutner suggests a mold allergy, to which the team goes to test her. Natalie admits to buying alcohol from her friend Simon, whom Kutner and Taub question. Taub suggests alcohol poisoning, but it turns out that she hardly even drank any of the alcohol she bought from Simon, as it was only a way to \\"look cool\\" and stay friends with him and he felt guilty over only associating with her in private because she wasn't popular. She goes into cardiac arrest, ruling out the alcohol theory. But her high blood alkaline phosphatase level nonetheless suggests leukemia, and Wilson is brought in to help. While Cuddy desperately tries to rule leukemia out, Wilson discusses the likelihood of it and says that she will die, even if they kill all the cancer, due to her failing heart and liver. A double transplant would not even save her. Cuddy then has an epiphany after talking with House about the pregnant couple and gravely realizes the only other disease that explains everything: post-partum Eclampsia, which means that Natalie must have got pregnant and had a child. This turns out to be correct, and her friend Simon is the unknowing father. Natalie explains that she gave birth in an abandoned house but her daughter was stillborn. Cuddy searches the house and finds the baby girl, alive, being cared for by a pair of homeless squatters, and brings the baby back to the hospital where she reunites her with her mother. Unfortunately, due to the extent of Natalie's failing organs, she will die within hours (although this is not shown in the episode). The baby ends up being in good health but is kept for observation as she is premature. In the end, the whole team is full of Christmas spirit. Kutner finds a former classmate he used to bully and apologizes to him. During the episode he is shown to be furious about Natalie being bullied and when asked says that he was never bullied. Cuddy plans to become a foster parent and adopt the baby, as neither grandparent wants to care for her as she will recall memories too painful for them to handle, with House wishing her \\"Merry Christmas, Cuddy.\\" Thirteen tells Foreman that he is not like House, after he welcomed back the woman who dropped out of the trial and is taking better care of her. Foreman and Thirteen passionately kiss. == External links == * \\"Joy to the World\\" at Fox.com * * Category:House (season 5) episodes Category:Christmas television episodes Category:2008 American television episodes fr:Saison 5 de Dr House#√âpisode 11 : Le Divin Enfant ","title":"Joy to the World (House)"},{"id":"20439099","text":"This is a list of films directed by Ernst Lubitsch.

Baum had attempted to end the Oz series with the sixth book, The Emerald City of Oz (1910). In the final chapter of that book, he sealed off the Land of Oz from the outside world.

Baum tried to launch two other juvenile novel series in 1911, with The Daring Twins, released under his own name, and The Flying Girl, under his \\"Edith Van Dyne\\" pseudonym.Rogers, pp. 186‚Äì9. None of the new series was as successful as the previous Baum and Van Dyne series; the Oz books and Aunt Jane's Nieces. Both the Flying Girl and Daring Twins series ended with their second volumes, The Flying Girl and Her Chum and Phoebe Daring, both published in 1912. Disappointing sales through 1911 and 1912 convinced Baum and Reilly & Britton that a return to Oz was needed. Baum wrote The Patchwork Girl of Oz for a 1913 release, and in the same year his publisher issued the six Little Wizard stories in individual booklets at a cost of $0.15 each. The goal was to reach the youngest beginning readers, and create in them an interest in the larger Oz canon, as part of a \\"promotion of L. Frank Baum and all of his books.\\"Rogers, p. 194. ==Content and publication== The six tales in the Little Wizard Stories are: * \\"The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger\\" * \\"Little Dorothy and Toto\\" * \\"Tiktok and the Nome King\\" * \\"Ozma and the Little Wizard\\" * \\"Jack Pumpkinhead and the Sawhorse\\" * \\"The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman\\" The strategy of reaching beginning readers was successful enough for Reilly & Britton to repeat it within a few years. The publisher released selections from L. Frank Baum's Juvenile Speaker (1910) in six smaller books called The Snuggle Tales in 1916‚Äì17, and again as the Oz-Man Tales in 1920. Four of the Little Wizard Stories were re-issued in 1932 in a new form, as The Little Oz Books with Jig Saw Oz Puzzles. A year or two later the four tales were released again, as part of a promotion for a Wizard of Oz radio program (sponsored by Jell-O). Rand McNally published the six stories in three booklets in 1939.Green and Martin, p. 38. ==ReferencesCategory:Books by L.

Titzer (born June 1960) is an American professor and infant researcher who claimed to create an approach to teach babies written language, which resulted in the Your Baby Can products. He has been a professor, teacher, and public speaker on human learning for around 31 years, and says that he taught his own children to read using the multi-sensory approach that he developed. He is the founder of the Infant Learning Company, a company that produces learning products for infants. ==Education and degrees== Titzer received his teaching credentials from San Diego State University. In the late 1980s, he taught at public schools in Guam and California. In 1985, he earned a communications degree from the University of Southern Indiana. He later completed a Master of Science degree from Pennsylvania State University and received a doctorate in human performance from the Indiana University Bloomington. At Bloomington, he did experiments in infant learning at developmental psychology laboratories. During his tenure as professor at Southeastern Louisiana University, Titzer developed a program to teach toddlers to read. He has also been a professor at Pennsylvania State University, Indiana University, and California State University, Fullerton. ===Publications === A search of the PsychINFO database reveals three publications which include Titzer as an author. He was one of four co-authors of a paper which was published in 1999 in Psychological Review, titled \\"The Task Dynamics of the A-Not-B Error\\". The other two citations in PsychInfo include his dissertation, which concerned the infant's understanding of the visual cliff, and a paper he co-authored in 1993, \\"The influence of reminder trials on contextual interference effects.\\" ==Occupation== Initially Dr. Titzer created this program for his own daughters which he says made them independent readers at a very early age. In 1997, Titzer began selling \\"Your Baby Can Learn!\\" videos. Titzer also trains preschool teachers in many countries and he consults with learning centers and preschools in India, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, the United States, and China. YBC is represented by LearningMojo Pvt Ltd in India and operates multiple Early Learning Centres in Karnataka, TamilNadu, Telangana, Haryana, Delhi NCR and Gujarat. Along with providing YBC products these centres help parents with YBC classes, Parent Toddler classes to help their children with Early language development. ==Criticism== Some people have criticized Titzer's videos as being suspect because they lack rigorous scientific review and are commercial products. In November 2010, Jeff Rossen and Robert Powell of NBC's Today wrote that Titzer \\"calls himself an infant learning expert but actually holds a graduate degree in 'human performance' ‚Äî the study of motor skills.\\" Maryanne Wolf, Tufts University's director of cognitive neuroscience, said: \\"It's an extraordinary manipulation of facts\\" to claim that the babies are actually reading. Today interviewed ten experts who affirmed that the brains of babies and toddlers are not developed enough to read at \\"the level the way the enticing television ads claim they can\\". Titzer argued against these claims, saying that scientific research supported the effectiveness of Your Baby Can Learn. On August 22, 2014, a press release from the Federal Trade Commission related the following: \\"Your Baby Can Read creator, Dr. Robert Titzer, and his company, Infant Learning, Inc. d/b/a The Infant Learning Company have settled charges that they made baseless claims about the effectiveness of the Your Baby Can Read program and misrepresented that scientific studies proved the claims.\\". Dr. Titzer now has broken his ties with the marketing company which used infomercials to sell the products in huge numbers. He now often works with people in the field of early childhood education to market the products. ==Personal== Titzer and his family live just outside San Diego, California. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:20th-century American writers Category:21st-century American writers Category:California State University, Fullerton faculty Category:Indiana University alumni Category:Indiana University faculty Category:Living people Category:Pennsylvania State University alumni Category:Pennsylvania State University faculty Category:People from San Diego Category:San Diego State University alumni Category:University of Southern Indiana alumni Category:Writers from California Category:Developmental psycholinguists ","title":"Robert Titzer"},{"id":"20439460","text":"Mount Storm Power Station from the boat ramp over looking the lake. The Mount Storm Generating Station, located on the west bank of Mount Storm Lake from Bismarck, West Virginia, is a coal-fired power station owned by Dominion Resources. It is the largest power plant that Dominion operates.Mount Storm Power Station The facility's three units use around 15,000 tons of coal per day to generate more than 1,600 megawatts of electricity from the coal synfuel for around 2 million people in Northern Virginia. ==History== Mount Storm Power Station was engineered and built by Stone & Webster, an American engineering service company from Massachusetts. They built Mount Storm's first coal plant unit in September 1965, the second unit soon after in June 1966, and the third unit in December 1973. During the first few decades that the station existed, the hazard of fly ash was a big problem for the employees of Mount Storm Power Station as well as for the people living in the surrounding communities. These people were constantly exposed to the asbestos not even knowing of its existence. It was not till the 1970s where rules were passed to regulate the exposure of these toxicants. Due to the lack of regulation, people who worked in the power station prior to 1980 have been diagnosed with \\"asbestos-related illnesses, including asbestosis and the much more deadly mesothelioma.\\" Since then Mount Storm Power Station has kept up with all government regulations and now catches most all of the toxicants produced by burning the coal before it can harm the employees or the surrounding community. Mount Storm has scrubbers which use 700 tons of limestone per day which removes up to 95% of the sulfur dioxide emitted by the station. Dominion states that Mount Storm Power Station exceeds the regulations set by the West Virginia regulators. ==Mount Storm Lake== Mount Storm Lake. Mount Storm Lake is a reservoir created for Mount Storm Power Station along the Stony River. This lake is 1,200 acres and is used as a cooling pond for the power station. The power station sucks up approximately 234,000 gallons of water from the lake per minute to cool down the turbines. This results in the entire lake being sucked up and recycled in just 2.5 days. Due to this cooling process, Mount Storm Lake is warm all year around. \\"Even when winter temperatures are below freezing, the water temperature in the lake seldom drops below 60 degrees F. This makes the lake an attractive year-round destination for scuba divers, boaters and fishermen.\\" However, some people are resistant to participate in these water activities due to the proximity to the coal-fired station. Due to the year round cooling process, the warm water has an effect on the environment called Thermal Pollution. Thermal pollution is defined as \\"a rise in the temperature of rivers and lakes that is injurious to water- dwelling life, and is caused by the disposal of heated industrial waste water.\\" One effect of thermal pollution is that it reduces the levels of Dissolved Oxygen in the water. The dissolved oxygen reduces the amount of oxygen in the water that plants and animals need to survive. Warm water also provokes the spread of algae in the water which can also reduce levels of oxygen. Another effect that thermal pollution has on the environment is it increases the metabolic rate of organisms. \\"Increasing enzyme activity occurs that causes organisms to consume more food than what is normally required... It disrupts the stability of the food chain and (can) alter the balance of species composition.\\" Dominion Resources maintains restrictions on activities permitted for visitors to the lake. ==Wind Farm== Two of Mount Storm's Windmill's along the Allegheny Front. Mount Storm also includes Ned power Mount Storm, LLC which is a nearby wind farm with 132 wind turbines, of which Dominion owns half. These wind turbines are placed along 12 miles of the Allegheny Front. The wind farm began construction in 2006 and is now currently fully operational. The wind generates up to 264MW of electricity which is enough to power 66,000 homes. {  +Generating units !Unit !Generating Capacity (MWe) !Commissioned !Boiler Manufacturer !Generator Manufacturer !Engineer and Builder - 1 563 September 1965  rowspan=\\"3\\" Combustion Engineering  rowspan=\\"2\\" Westinghouse Electric  rowspan=\\"3\\" Stone & Webster - 2 563 June 1966 - 3 567 December 1973 Asea Brown Boveri } ==See also== * List of power stations * Global warming ==References== Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1965 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1966 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1973 Category:Coal-fired power stations in West Virginia Category:Geography of Grant County, West Virginia ","title":"Mount Storm Power Station"},{"id":"20439501","text":"A banana split is an American ice cream-based dessert. To make the banana split, a banana is cut in half lengthwise (hence the name) and laid in the dish. There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with three scoops of ice cream (one each of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry served between the split banana. A sauce or sauces (chocolate, strawberry, and pineapple are traditional) are drizzled onto the ice cream, which is topped with whipped cream and maraschino cherries. Crushed nuts (generally peanuts or walnuts) are optional) ==Description== The original banana split was made with three scoops of different flavored ice creams, topped with fruits, and served over a banana that was split vertically down the middle. The original recipe used strawberries, raspberries and crushed pineapple with marshmallow syrup, chopped nuts, and pitted black cherries. The banana split is traditionally served in an elongated glass dish called a \\"boat\\". Strickler's marshmallow sauce is no longer used as a topping. The traditional toppings used in today's banana split include pineapple, strawberry and chocolate sauce, whipped cream, nuts, and cherries. Caramel sauce, on the other hand, is a non-traditional topping used in later variations of the classic banana split. Variations on the classic may use grilled bananas, experiment with different flavors of ice cream such as coconut or coffee, or sauces like salted caramel and warm butterscotch. ==History== Banana splits and ice cream sundaes served at a soda fountain at the 1st U.S. General Hospital in Paris during World War II Cold beverages and ice cream were a novelty in the mid-1800s when soda fountains began selling ice cream concoctions. A popular recipe published in 1907 called for a lengthwise split banana, two scoops of ice cream at each end and a spoon of whipped cream in between with maraschino cherry on top, with one end covered with chopped mixed nuts and another with chopped mixed fruits.Merck's Report: A Practical Journal of Pharmacy as a Profession and a Business. Ed. by Theodore Weicker. Volume 16, June 1907, p. 164. The Spatula Soda Water Guide published in 1919 contained recipes for 25 banana split varieties. The origin of the banana split is controversial, but most historians believe it was first created in 1904 by an optometrist in Latrobe, Pennsylvania named David \\"Doc\\" Strickler . Turback, Michael (March 2004). The Banana Split Book. Camino Books. Strickler was inspired by the fruit laden sundaes he saw while vacationing in Atlantic City in the summer of 1904, and aspired to create something similar when he returned to Latrobe using the banana fruit, which, in those days, was shipped to Pennsylvania by way of New Orleans. The sundae he concocted originally cost 10 cents, twice the price of other sundaes, and caught on with students of nearby Saint Vincent College. News of a new variety of sundae quickly spread by word-of-mouth and through correspondence and soon progressed far beyond Latrobe.Steele, Bruce (August 25, 2004). \\"With a Cherry on Top-Pitt fetes alums creation of banana split\\". University of Pittsburgh. Retrieved on September 3, 2007. Strickler went on to buy the pharmacy, naming it Strickler's Pharmacy, while keeping his office on a top floor.Smith, Rachel (June 22, 2006). \\"Latrobe's banana split a sweet 'Taste of America'\\". Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Retrieved on September 3, 2007. Wilmington, Ohio, also claims an early connection dating to 1907 when Ernest \\"Doc\\" Hazard created a dessert in hopes of attracting students from Wilmington College to his shop during the slow days of winter. The dessert he came up with was the banana split: three scoops of ice cream served between the two halves of a split banana, topped with chocolate, strawberry and pineapple sauces, whipped cream, maraschino cherries and nuts. However, most historians believe the evidence for Strickler's 1904 debut is more convincing, and, in 2004, the National Ice Cream Retailers Association (NICRA) certified the city of Latrobe, Pennsylvania as the birthplace of the banana split. Both towns hold an annual festival in honor of the dessert. Banana royale shown topped with banana slices Latrobe and Wilmington are not the only towns to claim the distinction of inventing the banana split. In Boston it's said the dessert was created at the Butler Department Store by the head soda jerk who, in 1905, served a banana split with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, topped with peaches, walnuts and pistachios. Davenport, Iowa claims it was invented by a local Davenport confectioner in 1906, and similar claims have been made by Columbus, Ohio, where the banana split is said to have been created by Letty Lally when a customer at Foeller's Drug Store asked for \\"something different.\\" (Food writer Mike Turback considers Lally's creation the first banana royale, a sundae made with banana slices.) The lack of evidence presents an obstacle to proving any of these claims. Walgreens is credited with spreading the popularity of the banana split. The early drug stores operated by Charles Rudolph Walgreen in the Chicago area adopted the banana split as a signature dessert. Fountains in the stores proved to be a draw, attracting customers who might otherwise have been just as satisfied having their prescriptions filled at some other drug store in the neighborhood. ==Banana split pie== The banana split pie was created by Janet Winquest, a 16-year-old resident of Holdrege, Nebraska. In 1952, she won a $3,000 prize in Pillsbury's Grand National Recipe and Baking Contest for the recipe.The National Rural Letter Carrier; National Rural Letter Carriers' Association, 1952; Volume 51, p.257.Farm Journal; Farm Journal Incorporated, 1953; Volume 77, Issue 11, p.138. ==In popular culture== Louis Prima played a song called \\"Banana Split for my Baby\\" at the Casbar Lounge of the Sahara Hotel in 1956 ==See also== * List of banana dishes ==References * History of individual ingredients in banana split Category:Food and drink introduced in 1904 Category:Banana dishes Category:Sundaes Category:Latrobe, Pennsylvania Category:American desserts ","title":"Banana split"},{"id":"20439516","text":"Banana Sundae (formerly Banana Split) was a Philippine comedy gag show broadcast by ABS-CBN.

It also airs worldwide via TFC. ==History== Banana Split is a spiritual successor to the comedy program Goin' Bananas that featured Edgar Mortiz, Christopher de Leon, Jay Ilagan, and Johnny Delgado. Banana Split debuted on October 11, 2008 with an all-girl cast led by Angelica Panganiban and Cristine Reyes, with different male celebrity guests each week.

On July 9, 2011, the original Saturday edition was reformatted as Banana Split: Extra Scoop, featuring live comedy performances and also includes the second season of Clown in a Million segment, a reality comedy search. On September 12, 2011, Banana Split: Daily Servings was renamed to Banana Split: Lafternoon Delight as the timeslot moved to 2:45PM as part of Kapamilya Gold afternoon block. However, it was later cancelled on October 7, 2011. Banana Split: Extra Scoop garnered high ratings on its Saturday late- night timeslot compare to the counterpart programs. Due to the success, ABS- CBN launched a late-weeknight edition called Banana Nite which premiered on February 25, 2013 every Mondays to Fridays right after Bandila. Banana Nite extended its airtime to 45 minutes on August 5, 2013, but was later reverted to 30 minutes on February 10, 2014 onwards. Banana Nite ended on October 30, 2015 after a two-year run. Meanwhile, Banana Split: Extra Scoop ended on November 7, 2015 after its four-year run. The show reformatted on November 15, 2015 as Banana Sundae which now airs every Sunday afternoons at 2:30PM right after ASAP Natin 'To. Banana Split original logo (2008‚Äì2015) In April 2020, Banana Sundae was temporarily put off the air, in response to rival network GMA extending Kapuso Movie Festival to a two-movie block. This switch forced the network to extend the Sunday edition of KB Family Weekend to two movies, causing ASAP Natin 'To shorten to a 1-hour airtime in Banana Sundae's timeslot, as part of ABS-CBN's temporary programming changes due to the 2020 Luzon lockdown (which is part of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country). However, the program was cancelled when ABS-CBN Channel 2 was forced to shut down indefinitely. Repeat episodes of the program later aired via ABS-CBN's interim replacement, Kapamilya Channel every weeknight at 11:45PM between June and July 2020. Through an article from Philippine Entertainment Portal, a gag show similar to Banana Sundae (considered its \\"successor\\") is slated to air by October 2020 on TV5 produced by Brightlight Productions.

It is named after John Reeve, who used it to show that higher-dimensional generalizations of Pick's theorem do not exist. ==Counterexample to generalizations of Pick's theorem== Each vertex of the Reeve tetrahedron lies on a fundamental lattice point (a point in ). No other fundamental lattice points lie on the surface or in the interior of the tetrahedron. The volume of the Reeve tetrahedron is . In 1957 Reeve used this tetrahedron to show that there exist tetrahedra with four lattice points as vertices, and containing no other lattice points, but with arbitrarily large volume. In two dimensions, the area of every polyhedron with lattice vertices is determined as a formula of the number of lattice points at its vertices, on its boundary, and in its interior, according to Pick's theorem. The Reeve tetrahedra imply that there can be no corresponding formula for the volume in three or more dimensions. Any such formula would be unable to distinguish the Reeve tetrahedra with different choices of from each other, but their volumes are different from each other. Despite this negative result, it is possible (as Reeve showed) to devise a more complicated formula for lattice polyhedron volume that combines the number of lattice points in the polyhedron, the number of points of a finer lattice in the polyhedron, and the Euler characteristic of the polyhedron. ==Ehrhart polynomial== The Ehrhart polynomial of any lattice polyhedron counts the number of lattice points that it contains when scaled up by an integer factor. The Ehrhart polynomial of the Reeve tetrahedron of height is :L(\\\\mathcal{T}_r, t) = \\\\frac{r}{6}t^3 + t^2 + \\\\left(2 - \\\\frac{r}{6}\\\\right)t + 1.

One quarter of a supertoroid can provide a smooth and seamless 90-degree joint between two superquadric cylinders. However, they are not algebraic surfaces (except in special cases). ==Formulas== Alan Barr's supertoroids are defined by parametric equations similar to the trigonometric equations of the torus, except that the sine and cosine terms are raised to arbitrary powers. Namely, the generic point P(u, v) of the surface is given by : P(u,v) = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} X(u,v)\\\\\\\\\\\\ Y(u,v)\\\\\\\\\\\\ Z(u,v) \\\\end{array}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} (a + C_{u}^{s}) C_{v}^{t}\\\\\\\\\\\\ (b + C_{u}^{s}) S_{v}^{t}\\\\\\\\\\\\ S_{u}^{s} \\\\end{array}\\\\right) where C_{\\\\theta}^{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\operatorname{sgn}(\\\\cos \\\\theta)\\\\left\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\right^\\\\epsilon, S_{\\\\theta}^{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\operatorname{sgn}(\\\\sin \\\\theta)\\\\left\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\right^\\\\epsilon, and the parameters u and v range from 0 to 360 degrees (0 to 2œÄ radians). In these formulas, the parameter s > 0 controls the \\"squareness\\" of the vertical sections, t > 0 controls the squareness of the horizontal sections, and a, b ‚â• 1 are the major radii in the X and Y directions. With s=t=1 and a=b=R one obtains the ordinary torus with major radius R and minor radius 1, with the center at the origin and rotational symmetry about the Z axis. In general, the supertorus defined as above spans the intervals [-(a+1),+(a+1)] in X, [-(b+1),+(b+1)] in Y, and [-1,+1] in Z. The whole shape is symmetric about the planes X=0, Y=0, and Z=0. The hole runs in the Z direction and spans the intervals [-(a-1),+(a-1)] in X and [-(b-1),+(b-1)] in Y. A curve of constant u on this surface is an horizontal Lam√© curve with exponent 2/t, scaled in X and Y and displaced in Z. A curve of constant v, projected on the plane X=0 or Y=0, is a Lam√© curve with exponent 2/s, scaled and horizontally shifted. If v is 0, the curve is planar and spans the interval [a-1,a+1] in X, and [-1,+1] in Z; and similarly if v is 90, 180, or 270 degrees. The curve is planar also if a = b. In general, if a‚â†b and v is not a multiple of 90 degrees, the curve of constant v will not be planar; and, conversely, a vertical plane section of the supertorus will not be a Lam√© curve. The basic supertoroid shape defined above is often modified by non-uniform scaling to yield supertoroids of specific width, length, and vertical thickness. ==Plotting code== The following GNU Octave code generates plots of a supertorus: function supertoroid(epsilon,a) n=50; d=.1; etamax=pi; etamin=-pi; wmax=pi; wmin=-pi; deta=(etamax-etamin)/n; dw=(wmax-wmin)/n; k=0; l=0; for i=1:n+1 eta(i)=etamin+(i-1)*deta; for j=1:n+1 w(j)=wmin+(j-1)*dw; x(i,j)=a(1)*(a(4)+sign(cos(eta(i)))*abs(cos(eta(i)))^epsilon(1))*sign(cos(w(j)))*abs(cos(w(j)))^epsilon(2); y(i,j)=a(2)*(a(4)+sign(cos(eta(i)))*abs(cos(eta(i)))^epsilon(1))*sign(sin(w(j)))*abs(sin(w(j)))^epsilon(2); z(i,j)=a(3)*sign(sin(eta(i)))*abs(sin(eta(i)))^epsilon(1); endfor; endfor; mesh(x,y,z); endfunction; ==See also== * Superellipsoid * Superegg * Superquadric ==References== Category:Surfaces Category:Computer graphics ","title":"Supertoroid"},{"id":"20439728","text":"Shelley is a closed station located in the town of Shelley, on the Cudgewa railway line in Victoria, Australia.

They occur widely in organic chemistry, but are relatively rare in nature. The thyroxine hormones are organoiodine compounds that are required for health and the reason for government-mandated iodization of salt. ==Structure, bonding, general properties== Almost all organoiodine compounds feature iodide connected to one carbon center. These are usually classified as derivatives of I‚àí. Some organoiodine compounds feature iodine in higher oxidation states.Alex G. Fallis, Pierre E. Tessier, \\"2-Iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX)1\\" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2003 John Wiley. The C-I bond is the weakest of the carbon-halogen bonds. These bond strengths correlate with the electronegativity of the halogen, decreasing in the order F > Cl > Br > I. This periodic order also follows the atomic radius of halogens and the length of the carbon-halogen bond. For example, in the molecules represented by CH3X, where X is a halide, the carbon-X bonds have strengths, or bond dissociation energies, of 115, 83.7, 72.1, and 57.6 kcal/mol for X = fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide, respectively. Of the halides, iodide usually is the best leaving group. Because of the weakness of the C-I bond, samples of organoiodine compounds are often yellow due to an impurity of I2. A noteworthy aspect of organoiodine compounds is their high density, which arises from the high atomic weight of iodine. For example, one millilitre of methylene iodide weighs 3.325 g. ==Industrial applications== Few organoiodine compounds are important industrially, at least in terms of large scale production. Iodide-containing intermediates are common in organic synthesis, because of the easy formation and cleavage of the C-I bond. Industrially significant organoiodine compounds, often used as disinfectants or pesticides, are iodoform (CHI3), methylene iodide (CH2I2), and methyl iodide (CH3I). Although methyl iodide is not an industrially important product, it is an important intermediate, being a transiently generated intermediate in the industrial production of acetic acid and acetic anhydride. The potential for methyl iodide to replace the ubiquitous dependence on methyl bromide as a soil fumigant has been considered, however limited information is available on environmental behavior of the former.Allard, A.S. and A. H. Neilson. 2003. Degradation and transformation of organic bromine and iodine compounds: comparison with their chlorinated analogues. The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry 3:1-74. Ioxynil (3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile), which inhibits photosynthesis at photosystem II, is among the very few organoiodine herbicides. A member of the hydroxybenzonitrile herbicide class, ioxynil is an iodinated analog of the brominated herbicide, bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile). Iodinated and brominated organic compounds are of concern as environmental contaminants owing to very limited information available on environment fate behavior. However, recent reports have shown promise in biological detoxification of these classes of contaminants. For example, Iodotyrosine deiodinase is a mammalian enzyme with the unusual function of aerobic reductive dehalogenation of iodine- or bromine-substituted organic substrates.McTamney, P.M. and S.E. Rokita . 2010. A mammalian reductive deiodinase has broad power to dehalogenate chlorinated and brominated substrates. J Am Chem Soc. 131(40): 14212‚Äì14213. Bromoxynil and ioxynil herbicides have been shown to undergo a variety of environmental transformations, including reductive dehalogenation by anaerobic bacteria.Cupples, A. M., R. A. Sanford, and G. K. Sims. 2005. Dehalogenation of Bromoxynil (3,5-Dibromo-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) and Ioxynil (3,5-Diiodino-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) by Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans. Appl. Env. Micro. 71(7):3741-3746. Polyiodoorganic compounds are sometimes employed as X-ray contrast agents, in fluoroscopy, a type of medical imaging. This application exploits the X-ray absorbing ability of the heavy iodine nucleus. A variety of agents are available commercially, many are derivatives of 1,3,5-triiodobenzene and contain about 50% by weight iodine. For most applications, the agent must be highly soluble in water and, of course, non- toxic and readily excreted. A representative reagent is Ioversol (Figure to right),Ulrich Speck, Ute H√ºbner-Steiner \\"Radiopaque Media\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. which has water-solubilizing diol substituents. Typical applications include urography and angiography. Organoiodine lubricants can be used with titanium, stainless steels, and other metals which tend to seize up with conventional lubricants: organoiodine lubricants can be used in turbines and spacecraft, and as a cutting oil in machining.\\"Key Lubrication Ingredient: Iodine Moves to Space Age\\", Schenectady Gazette, November 17, 1965.

File:Triiodothyronine.svgtriiodothyronine (T3), another thyroid hormone. ==Biological role== In terms of human health, the most important organoiodine compounds are the two thyroid hormones thyroxine (\\"T4\\") and triiodothyronine (\\"T3\\"). Marine natural products are rich sources of organoiodine compounds, like the recently discovered plakohypaphorines from the sponge Plakortis simplex. The sum of iodomethane produced by the marine environment, microbial activity in rice paddies, and the burning of biological material is estimated to be 214 kilotonnes per year. The volatile iodomethane is broken up by oxidation reactions in the atmosphere and a global iodine cycle is established. More than 3000 organoiodine compounds have been identified. ==Methods for preparation of the C-I bond== Organoiodine compounds are prepared by numerous routes, depending on the degree and regiochemistry of iodination sought and the nature of the precursors. The direct iodination with is employed with unsaturated substrates: : The iodide anion is a good nucleophile and will displace chloride, tosylate, bromide and other leaving groups, as in the Finkelstein reaction. Aromatic iodides may be prepared via a diazonium salt in the Sandmeyer reaction. Because of its low ionization energy, iodine is readily converted to reagents that deliver the equivalent of \\"\\". A representative electrophilic iodination reagent is iodine monochloride. ==See also== *Organofluorine compounds *Organochlorine compounds *Organobromine compounds *Iodanes *Periodinanes ==References== ","title":"Organoiodine compound"},{"id":"20439769","text":"__NOTOC__ Freddie Query (born February 4, 1952) is a former late model dirt track racing driver from Mooresville, North Carolina.

Such a weapon would allow the United States to respond far more swiftly to rapidly emerging threats than is possible with conventional forces. A PGS system could also be useful during a nuclear conflict, potentially replacing the use of nuclear weapons against up to 30% of targets. The PGS program encompasses numerous established and emerging technologies, including conventional surface-launched missiles and air- and submarine-launched hypersonic missiles, although no specific PGS system has yet been finalized as of 2018. ==System== The PGS system is intended to complement existing American rapid-response forces, such as Forward Deployed Forces, Air Expeditionary Groups (which can deploy within 48 hours) and carrier battle groups (which can respond within 96 hours). Possible delivery systems for PGS warheads include: *a rocket similar to existing ICBMs, launched from land or via submarine *an air- or submarine-launched hypersonic cruise missile, such as a massive version of Boeing X-51 or Advanced Hypersonic Weapon *a kinetic weapon launched from an orbiting space platform In 2010, the United States Air Force prototyped a PGS system based on a modified Minuteman III ICBM. In March 2011, Air Force Major General David Scott stated that the service had no plans to use a sea- or land-based ICBM system for Prompt Global Strike, as they would be expensive to develop and potentially \\"dangerous.\\" Instead, efforts would focus on a hypersonic glider.\\"Prompt Global Strike Won't Use ICBMs.\\" Defense News. However, the following day, Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force Norton Schwartz said that an ICBM-based PGS system was still an option.\\"Conventional ICBM Still an Option: Schwartz.\\" Defense News. ==Development history== The Orbital Test Vehicles (OTV-1 and OTV-2) are on the left, and the X-34 is on the right. Mission: \\"demonstrate a reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform for the United States Air Force.\\" Possible applications: to serve as part of a reconnaissance program, a space bomber, or even a military satellite delivery system. ===Background=== The George W. Bush administration considered developing a hypersonic conventional weapon for a PGS role in the 2000s, in the form of DARPA's Falcon Project. A conventionally-armed modification of the Trident SLBM was also proposed as a PGS candidate in 2006. The Bush administration ultimately rejected the idea of a PGS system because of fears that a submarine-launched ballistic missile would trigger the Russian nuclear-launch warning system, potentially provoking a nuclear war. However, the Obama administration continued development of the system later in the decade. In April 2010, Marine Corps General James Cartwright explained the system's rationale, stating that \\"Today, unless you want to go nuclear, [the conventional military response time is] measured in days, maybe weeks\\". A potential enemy cannot be certain that a launched ICBM contains only a conventional warhead, not a nuclear one. It is thus currently unclear what design features or precautions could convince China and Russia, two countries with advanced launch-detection systems and nuclear ICBMs, to ignore their early-warning systems. Current ideas include a low-trajectory missile design, or allowing Russian and Chinese inspection of PGS missile sites. On 11 April 2010, United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates indicated that the United States already had a Prompt Global Strike capability. This coincided with the New START disarmament treaty signed on 8 April 2010, which set new, lower limits on arsenals of ballistic missiles and their warheads. The treaty does not distinguish between conventional and nuclear versions of weapons, meaning any ballistic PGS missiles and warheads would count toward the new limit. However, the U.S. State Department stated in 2010 that this would not constrain plans for PGS deployment, since plans for the system at that time did not come near the New START limits. ===Advanced hypersonic weapon=== On 18 November 2011, the first advanced hypersonic weapon (AHW) glide vehicle was successfully tested by the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command as part of the Prompt Global Strike program. The missile was launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii, and struck a target at the Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll, over away, in under 30 minutes. The prototype, which incorporated technologies developed by Sandia National Laboratories, was used to gather data to assist the development of future hypersonic warheads. The AHW followed an endo-atmospheric (within earth atmosphere, at altitude below 100 kilometers) non-ballistic trajectory during the test flight. This is a crucial design feature, as following a depressed trajectory that is much lower and flatter than a normal ICBM prevents other nuclear-armed nations from mistakenly thinking the AHW is a nuclear-tipped missile. The second AHW test flight occurred on 25 August 2014 from the Kodiak Launch Complex in Alaska. The mission was terminated shortly after liftoff due to an anomaly in the launch vehicle. Operators triggered a self-destruct sequence four seconds after launching, with eyewitnesses claiming the weapon had veered off trajectory just as it took off. A Failure Review Board released the results of their investigation into the failed launch in early February 2015. The board determined that an external thermal protective cover, designed to regulate motor temperature, interfered with the launch vehicle's steering assembly; no issues were found with the hypersonic glide body, booster motors, or the Kodiak Launch Complex, and the board determined the test range flight safety officer correctly followed established protocol and procedures. The HTV-2 Falcon project is also in the development stage of conducting test flights. ===Submarine option=== In January 2012, the Pentagon stated that the PGS launch platform would be submarine-based. However, practical efforts to develop the PGS system were delayed by fears of accidentally starting a nuclear conflict. In February 2014, the U.S. Navy solicited proposals for two- year industry trade studies to test the feasibility of developing a hypersonic submarine-launched intermediate-range conventional PGS weapon. The Navy specified that the effort was a study to evaluate technology options, not to develop a system-level specific CPGS solution. The Navy stated that it would be interested in awarding one or two 13-month technology evaluation contracts, each worth around US$5 million. ==Foreign responsesRussia=== In December 2010, Russian military experts indicated that the forthcoming S-500 missile defense system would include anti-hypersonic defenses. In December 2012, commenting on the development of a replacement for its R-36M2 Voevoda ICBM, the commander of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces, Sergey Karakaev, stated that the missile would allow Russia \\"to realize such opportunities as the creation of high precision strategic weapons with non-nuclear warheads and a practical global range. Russia can create non-nuclear, high precision weapons based on intercontinental rockets in the event that the USA also works on designing such a weapon\\". On 11 December 2013, Vice Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin warned that Russia would use nuclear weapons if it came under an attack, adding that this possibility serves as the main deterrent to potential aggressors. Rogozin also stated that the Russian Fund of Perspective Researches (FPI) would develop a military response to the PGS system. In September 2014, Russia's president Vladimir Putin mentioned PGS among a number of the new threats Russia faced, along with the US Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system in Alaska, the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System in Europe, and increased NATO activity in eastern Europe. Deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin again warned that Russia would upgrade its strategic nuclear forces and aerospace defences in response to the PGS system. According to some observers, the Russian Yu-71 hypersonic boost-glide system is under test flights since 2011, though its predecessors date back to 2001. In October 2015, while attending a non-proliferation conference in New York, the Russian Foreign Ministry's Department of Non-proliferation, Disarmament, and Arms Control Mikhail Ulyanov stated \\"It is the policy of the United States that is the most serious obstacle in the further reduction in nuclear arms. This is because of their persistent implementation of their line objectively rocking global strategic stability through the unilateral creation of a global system of anti-missile defense that gradually complements the conception of a Prompt Global Strike, which hampers the beginning of negotiations on the prohibition of placing weapons in space and lack of any type of progress in ratifying the CTBT.\\" In March 2018, the Avangard hypersonic warhead, a development of the Yu-71/Yu-74, entered series production. ===China=== The Chinese People's Liberation Army began developing its own long-range hypersonic missile, the DF-ZF rocket-boosted hypersonic glide vehicle, in the 2010s. The DF-ZF, which is similar to the PGS/HTV-2 system, underwent its first full-scale flight test in January 2014, and conducted few more flight tests later, of which only one failed. As with Russia's efforts, little is publicly known about the progress of the Chinese hypersonic glide vehicle program. ==See also== *Air Force Global Strike Command *Anti-ship ballistic missile *Avangard (Russia) *ArcLight, a DARPA program which proposed using US Navy ships such as Aegis cruisers to launch intercontinental missiles *DF-21D, a conventionally armed MRBM deployed by China in an anti-ship capacity *DF-ZF, China *Project Thor, a proposed orbital kinetic bombardment weapon *Tupolev Tu-360 ==References * *\\"U.S. Looks To Non-Nuclear Weapons To Use As Deterrent\\".

After secularization in 1802, the church and most of the buildings were demolished, works of art spread throughout the surrounding churches, notably in the Church of St. Nicholas in Kalkar. From the monastery only a part of a wall remains. The city was driven by development of the wool weaving industry. The wealthy bourgeois and the presence of the nobility in the person of Mary attracted artists, solicited for their works in oils and clay. The Kalkar church, completed in 1450, and the monastery, were the subject of many decorations. The city became, until the early sixteenth century, the center of a school of sculpture including Heinrich Douvermann. Further, scientists like Konrad Heresbach, counselor of the Dukes of Cleves, humanist, lawyer, educator and farmer, periodically resided in Kalkar. This flourishing period ended in the mid-sixteenth century, when, after the fall of weaving activities, epidemics of plague decimated the population. ==AncestryReferencesFurther reading== *Early Netherlandish painting: its origins and character, Volume 2, Erwin Panofsky, 1971 Category:1393 births Category:1466 deaths Category:Countesses of Cleves Category:Duchesses of Cleves Category:Countesses of Mark Category:House of Valois-Burgundy Category:People from Dijon Category:14th-century French women Category:15th-century French women Category:14th-century French people Category:15th-century French people ","title":"Mary of Burgundy, Duchess of Cleves"},{"id":"20440373","text":"Mumbai massacre may refer to: *1993 Bombay bombings *August 2003 Mumbai bombings *2006 Mumbai train bombings *2008 Mumbai attacks *2011 Mumbai bombings ","title":"Mumbai massacre"},{"id":"20440400","text":"The Henry Shoemaker Farmhouse is a circa 1810 Federal style farmhouse which was involved in the Battle of South Mountain in 1862.

It is found in strata dating back to the Delamaran stage of the Middle Cambrian around 505 million years ago, during the time of the Cambrian explosion. It was about in length. Charles Doolittle Walcott named Canadia in 1911 after Canada, the country from which its remains have been found. == Description == Canadia grew to 2-8 inches (5-20 centimeters) long. The animal's most notable feature is the many notosetae (rigid setae extending from dorsal branches of notopodia) along the back of the animal that are characteristic of polychaete worms. It has been suggested that these notosetae may have been iridescent when the organism was alive due to evidence of diffraction gratings found on the surface of some fossils.Parker, A. R. 1998. Colour in Burgess Shale animals and the effects of light on evolution in the Cambrian. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B 265:967-972. (See also: Structural coloration and the images at Aphrodita.) Tentacles extended from the prostomium and may have served as sensory organs. The gut of Canadia was straight and had the ability to extend out of the body in the form of a proboscis, suggesting that the animal was carnivorous. This is further evidenced by the lack of sediments found in the gut that would be present in a benthic detritivore.http://paleobiology.si.edu/burgess/canadia.html Canadia is thought to have swum above the seafloor as a primary means of locomotion by beating its numerous notosetae. It would also have had the ability to creep along the seafloor using the ventral counterpart of the notopodia, which are termed neuropodia (in reference to the proximity to the paired, ventral nerve cords characteristic of annelids). ==Classification== There has been some debate as to the placement of Canadia within the Annelida phylum. Although it is commonly accepted to be within Annelida, it is uncertain how it relates to modern annelids. Most paleontologists agree that it belongs to the class Polychaeta due in part to the presence of Parapodium. It has been proposed to be a member of the order Phyllodocida along with Wiwaxia, another organism from the Burgess Shale. Both were placed in a new superfamily called Canadiacea, and were thought to be of closer relationship to each other than to modern annelids.Butterfield, N.J., 1990b. A reassessment of the enigmatic Burgess Shale fossil Wiwaxia corrugata (Matthew) and its relationship to the polychaete Canadia spinosa Walcott. Paleobiology, v.16, no.3, p.287-303 However, Wiwaxia is no longer believed to have been an annelid and there is currently dispute as to whether or not Canadia should be classified as belonging to anything more derived than Polychaeta.Eibye-Jacobsen, D.

Philip Schuyler Allen (1908), \\"Medieval Latin Lyrics: Part I,\\" Modern Philology, 5(3), 440, grants it the English title Victory of Pippin over the Avari. Rosamond McKitterick (1994), Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ), 131-33, refers to it as the \\"Rhythm on the Avars\\" or \\"Avar Rhythm\\". (\\"Poem [song] of king Pippin's Avar victory\\"), also known by its incipit as Omnes gentes qui fecisti (\\"All peoples whom you created\\"), is a medieval Latin encomium celebrating the victory of King Pepin of Italy over the Avars in the summer of 796. It is associated with an experimental trend of the Carolingian Renaissance and, though its author, probably a cleric, is unknown, is associated with the Veronese \\"school\\" of poets, one of whom, at the same time, produced the Versus de Verona, praising the royal capital of Italy, where it and De Pippini were probably written.Godman, 31. De Pippini is usually classified as a \\"popular ballad\\", though it does not fit stereotypes of either popular or learned literature and has been likened more to a chanson de geste.Christopher Dawson; Elena Vela, trans. (1995 [1950]), La religion y el origen de la cultura occidental (Encuentro, .), 105, likens it to the Gesta Dei per Francos. His translator provides the following Spanish version of the first stanza: T√∫, oh Cristo, hijo de Dios, que hiciste todos los pueblos, que formaste las tierras, las fuentes, los r√≠os, las monta√±as y el hombre, en estos √∫ltimos d√≠as convertirse a los √°varos. It contains some vulgarisms in grammar, orthography, syntax, style, and form, but much of its hybrid nature is probably purposed.All of this is criticised heavily by P. A. Becker (1967), \\"Vom Kurzlied zum Epos,\\" Zur romanischen Literaturgeschichte. Ausgew√§hlte Studien und Aufs√§tze (Berne/Munich), 192, cf. Godman, 31 n69. Despite this, and its unusual metre, its rhythm is regular. It contains fifteen stanzas and a final line. Historically, the Avars settled in Pannonia in a series of ring-shaped fortresses arranged in an even larger ring. An Avar army first appeared on the borders of the Carolingian world in 782 at the river Enns. They were defeated in 795 by Duke Eric of Friuli, who sent an enormous booty to the imperial capital of Aachen; one of their princes, a tudun, submitted and did homage. In 796 Pepin forced their supreme prince to likewise submit. Structurally, the poet moves from divine praise, a condemnation of the Avars (in language similar to that found in contemporary annals), a narrative of events (including dialogue), and finally praise of its hero, Pepin. The words put in the mouth of the defeated Avar leader, the Kagan (Cacanus), mirror contemporary legal formulae of submission. The Kagan, and his wife Catuna, had previously been warned by one of his men, Unguimer, that his kingdom would fall to the princeps catholicus (catholic prince) Pepin. At the news of Pepin's approaching army, the Kagan, cum Tarcan primatibus, went to do him homage.The term tarcan was apparently unfamiliar to the poet's audience, for he glossed it with primatibus (chieftains, i.e., first ones). The final stanzas, with the acclamatory Vivat, vivat rex Pippinus (\\"Long live king Pepin!\\") at stanza 14 and the final line of Gloria aeterna patri, gloria sit filio (\\"Eternal glory be to the Father, glory to His son\\"), suggest public recitation and liturgical influence.Godman, 190. The poem was translated into English by Jack Lindsay in Medieval Latin Poets (E. Mathews and Marrot, 1934).See page 55 for the \\"Victory of Pippin\\". It was also translated into English and published in booklet form in a limited edition of 300 copies: Bill Griffiths (1976), The Song of the Hunnish Victory of Pippin the King (Earthgrip Press, ). Its most recent translator, Peter Godman (1985), Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), titled it \\"King Pippin's victory over the Avars\\".See pp. 31-32 for analysis, pp. 186-191 for the Latin with translation.

Originally named The Virtues, the band was formed in the San Francisco suburb of Walnut Creek, California, by high school students Dave Carter (vocals, bass),Denny Rogan (lead guitar) and Steve Derr (vocals, rhythm guitar) in 1966. They were initially joined by Paul White and Craig T. Nelson, who were soon replaced by Greg Douglass (lead guitar) and Bill Baron (drums).Somavilla, Mike (2005). Country Weather (2005 LP liner notes) ==Career== In 1967, the band changed their name to Country Weather, at the suggestion of San Francisco music promoter Chet Helms. Chet also suggested that the band stop playing cover versions and concentrate on writing their own original material. Soon after, they began opening for various psychedelic bands at key counter-culture venues in San Francisco, including the Avalon Ballroom, the Fillmore Auditorium, and Winterland. Although Country Weather never signed to a major record label or released any singles or albums during their 1960s heyday, they did record a five song promotional demo in 1969 to help them get gigs. 50 copies of this demo record were produced (making it a much sought-after rarity among collectors) and it received considerable airplay on local radio stations. Country Weather disbanded in 1973 when Greg Douglass left the band to join Mistress. Later he joined the Steve Miller Band and has also played as a sideman to established artists, including Van Morrison. Dave Carter went on to play with Quicksilver Messenger Service and also played with former Moby Grape member, Skip Spence. The group reformed in 2000, for a benefit show to help raise funds for a liver transplant for a friend of the band. The result was a full reformation, with Greg Douglass and Bill Baron being replaced by Graham Cooper (guitar), and Lloyd Ferris (drums). The band released their first CD in 2003, entitled Makin' Music Again. This 13 track CD featured new and vintage songs, including a recording of \\"Yes That's Right\\" taken from a Fillmore Auditorium show in July 1969. In 2005, a double vinyl LP entitled Country Weather was released by RD Records. This double album featured the band‚Äôs 1969 five song demo, previously unreleased live recordings from summer 1970 and a studio session from 1971.

Miller was a steamboat captain in the Pacific Northwest from 1851 to 1903. He became well known for his long length of service, the large number of vessels he commanded, and the many different geographical areas in which he served. ==Early life and migration to Oregon== Capt.. James D. Miller was born in New York or New Jersey in 1830, and arrived on the Pacific Coast in 1848. Arriving in Oregon Miller traded his horses and mules for an acre of land just north of Oregon City, Oregon at a place called Clackamas City. ==Flatboat navigation on the Willamette== A typical flat boat, or bateau In the spring of 1850, Miller began running a flatboat between Canemah just above Willamette Falls on the Willamette River and Dayton, on the Yamhill River. Miller built a flatboat 65 feet long, which was capable of hauling 350 bushels of wheat. He hired four members of the Klickitat First Nation as crew and poled and rowed the boat up the Yamhill River to Dayton and Lafayette. It took two days to go up from Canemah, and one day to return. Miller charged $35 a ton to haul cargo to upriver farmers, mostly consignments from merchants on the lower Willamette (the part of the river below Willamette Falls). Coming down river Miller charged 50 cents a bushel to carry out the farmers' wheat. His chief expenses were the salaries of his First Nations crew, which were $16 per man for each trip.Wright, E.W., ed., Lewis and Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 27-28, Lewis & Dryden Printers, Portland, OR 1895 ==Start in steamboating== Miller had been in the flatboat business for about a year when on May 19, 1851, the first steamboat appeared on the upper Willamette. This was the small sidewheeler Hoosier. Although small and crude, Hoosier was capable of hauling much more cargo and wheat than any flatboat. Miller was soon out of business, however he did manage to be hired by Hoosier's owner, John Zumwalt. On board Hoosier, Miller worked as the bookkeeper, purser, pilot, deckhand and roustabout.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 249, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966Affleck, Edward L., A Century of Paddlewheelers in the Pacific Northwest, the Yukon and Alaska, Alexander Nicholls Press, Vancouver, BC 2000 In the fall of 1856 with his brother-in-law Silas R. Smith, Miller bought Hoosier and the next year built another steamboat Hoosier No. 2 and operated the vessel on the Willamette between Champoeg and Butteville and up the Yamhill River. Later, they rebuilt Hoosier' No. 2 and called her Hoosier No. 3. In 1858 Miller sold an interest in Hoosier No. 3 to E.M. White and with his associates purchased the sternwheeler James Clinton and ran her until April 23, 1861, when the Clinton was destroyed by a dockside fire at Linn City, Oregon.Corning, Howard McKinley, Willamette Landings -- Ghost Towns of the River, at 43-44, 47, 56, 180-81, 183, Oregon Historical Society (2d Ed. 1973) In 1860 he took the machinery out of Hoosier and placed it in the steam scow Yamhill. ==Snake River mines and purchase of the Unio/Union== Soon after this Miller sold his interest in Yamhill to Capt. John T. Apperson, and with Capt. George A. Pease went to the Snake River mines. Meanwhile Apperson had built the sternwheeler Unio whose unusual name derived from Captain Apperson's uncertainty about who might prevail in the American Civil War which had just begun, as well as a significant number of Confederate sympathizers who might be among his customers. Returning from there in December, 1861, Miller bought the Unio from Captain Apperson, and, not caring what his Southern-inclined customers might think, quickly added the final \\"n\\" to her name. ==House washed away by flood== Miller's home was destroyed, along with most of Linn City, in a flood of the Willamette River on December 1, 1861. Miller's home was thought to be the safest structure in the town, and other people sheltered there. But as the water rose, it became obvious they would have to evacuate the structure, which was done just before the building was swept away. ==Steamboat pilot on the Willamette== Oregon City, and Willamette Falls in 1867 Except for a short time in 1862, when he was on the Mountain Buck and Julia Barclay,Commonly called Julia Miller ran Union on the Willamette River until 1866 when the vessel was acquired by the People's Transportation Company. From the Union Miler went as pilot on the Fanny Patton with Capt. George Jerome. After that, Miller moved to the Enterprise (built 1863) with Capt. Sebastian \\"Bas\\" Miller, remaining with Enterprise until that vessel was dismantled.One source indicates Enterprise was dismantled in 1875 but this may be too late a date for Miller's service. See Affleck, at 12. In 1868 Miller piloted the new steamer Albany with Capt. Lon Vickers. After a short term on Albany Miller entered the milling business at Oregon City. Soon afterward he served on the People's Transportation Company's steamers Onward, Senator and E.N. Cooke Miller was a passenger on Senator when she was blown up in 1875 near the Alder Street dock in Portland, Oregon. The Miller next day took command of the E. N. Cooke, and ran her until the Oregon Steam Navigation Company absorbed the People's Transportation Company. ==Financial losses in the flour business== Steamer A.A. McCully, on the Yamhill River at Dayton, Oregon In 1878 he purchased C. P. Church's interest in some flour mills, and also bought the steamer A.A. McCully. Miller removed the geared machinery from A.A. McCully and installed it in the steamer Success. Miller ran Success up the Willamette River to Eugene, Oregon. In 1879 Miller suffered some financial reverses, losing not only his mill interest but Success as well, which he had turned over to Z.J. Hatch. Miller then took command of the City of Salem, and ran her until 1881 for William Reid, carrying railroad material to Ray's Landing and Dayton, Oregon. ==Work in Idaho and eastern Washington== For health reasons Miller resigned from the command of City of Salem, and with Church and others bought the flour mills at Walla Walla, Wash. Terr.. From there Miller went to Sand Point, Idaho and ran the Henry Villard on Lake Pend Oreille. From the Henry Villard he went to the Katie Hallett, running on the Clarks Fork Yellowstone River. ==Return to the Willamette Valley== City of Salem sternwheeler on the Willamette River In the spring of 1882 Miller returned to Walla Walla, sold out the mill and went to Dayton, Oregon. In 1886, he retired to a farm, returning to the river again in 1889, again running the City of Salem, this time between Fulquartz and Ray's landings until 1890. ==Construction of sternwheeler Norma in Idaho== Miller then went to Huntington, Oregon and superintended the building of the Norma, making the first trip with her into the Seven Devils' Country. This was a run 60 miles downriver into Hells Canyon to Seven Devils Landing, and then back upriver to Huntington.Gulick, Bill, Steamboats on Northwest Rivers at 162-63, Caxton Press, Caldwell, ID 2004 Carrey, Johnny, Conley, Cort, and Barton, Ace, Snake River In Hells Canyon, at page 43, Backeddy Books, Cambridge, ID 1979 Returning to Portland he served on the Governor Newell, Three Sisters, Toledo and Joseph Kellogg during 1891-92. ==Relocation to the Kootenay region== Annerly, first steamboat on the Upper Kootenay River In 1893, Miller went to Montana and took command of the steamer Annerly, running on the upper Kootenay RiverThis river, which crosses the Canada‚ÄìUS border twice, is sometimes called the \\"Kootenai\\" river when referring to its portions in the United States between Jennings, Montana and Fort Steele, BC.. He remained there until August 1894, when he went to Puget Sound, purchased the steamer Halys, and had her shipped inland to be placed on the lower Kootenai River, running out of Bonner's Ferry, Idaho. Miller commanded steamboats in the Kootanay region until 1901. ==Destruction of the Gwendoline== Gwendoline Completion of the British Columbia Southern Railway in October 1898 had the effect of idling the three major steamboats on the upper Kootenay River, all of which Miller had commanded at various times: J.D. Farrell, North Star, and Gwendoline. Miller had the idea of moving Gwendoline by rail to the Lardeau River and Kootenay Lake which appeared to be a route where she could generate revenue. (The Kootenay River, which ultimately flowed into Kootenay Lake, was unnavigable below Jennings because of Kootenay Falls. Miller paid $500 in shipping fees and arranged to have Gwendoline loaded on three flat cars. The rail line tracked along the canyon face, and at one point there appeared to be not enough room for the steamer to squeeze past. The rail crew shifted the steamer over away from the cliff face and a bit closer to the canyon rim.

Females are larger than males. The color of this dolphin varies from lead-colored to black. The undersides are lighter in color. The rostrum is 18 to 21 cm in length and the forehead is steep and rises abruptly from the base of the snout. The dorsal fin is rudimentary and ridge-like, and the ends of the pectoral fins are squared instead of tapered. The neck is visibly constricted and the blowhole is a longitudinal slit. There are 28 to 29 teeth on either side of the jaw. The eye and optic nerve of the Ganges river dolphin are degenerate. The eye lacks a lens and is therefore incapable of forming images on the retina. However, it functions in light-detection. It is believed that the lack of a true visual apparatus in the river dolphin is related to its habitat; the water in which it lives is so muddied that vision in essentially useless.

It is owned and operated by Station Casinos. Groundbreaking began on August 5, 1993. The project was built at a cost of $103 million, and opened on August 23, 1994. An expansion in 1995 added a child-care facility, an 11-screen movie theater, and a video game arcade. A $50 million renovation took place in 2008, to compete against the new Eastside Cannery. A renovation of the hotel's 300 rooms was completed in 2011. Boulder Station's Railhead concert venue has earned several awards from the Academy of Country Music for its hosting of country performers. The Railhead has also hosted various blues performers as well. Multiple incidents, including several shootings, have occurred on the property during its history. ==History== Boulder Station was built on located at the northeast corner of Lamb Boulevard and Boulder Highway. The site was chosen by Station Casinos in 1986, as the company believed that the east side of the Las Vegas Valley was under served. The site was also chosen because of its easy access from the nearby Interstate 515. Groundbreaking of the $85 million Boulder Station began on August 5, 1993. Attendees at the groundbreaking ceremony included Las Vegas mayor Jan Laverty Jones and Nevada governor Robert Miller. The project was expected to employ 1,700 people, with approximately 260 employees from the Palace Station expressing an interest in being transferred to the new property. The 15-story hotel tower was expected to be topped off in March 1994, and the project's ultimate cost was $103 million. Boulder Station was the first project that Station Casinos CEO Frank Fertitta III oversaw from its conception to its completion. Boulder Station's roadside neon sign had been activated by early August 1994, ahead of the property's opening. It was the largest freestanding sign along Boulder Highway. The sign included the world's largest color screen, measuring and being visible for more than two miles away, including downtown Las Vegas. The sign included 75,000 incandescent light bulbs. The total weight of the sign was 1,500 tons, and the creation of the sign's footings required 58 trucks to pour concrete constantly over a seven-hour period. Boulder Station opened on August 23, 1994, with a fireworks show. It was the first new hotel-casino to open on the east side of Las Vegas since 1979. Boulder Station included 300 hotel rooms and a casino with 2,200 slot and video poker machines, 44 table games, and a 10-table poker room. The casino also included a 70-seat keno lounge and a 240-seat race and sportsbook. The 44 table games were located in a casino pit accompanied by stained glass murals depicting 19th century trains. The railroad-theme was shared by its sister property, the Palace Station. Boulder Station's design consisted of Victorian architecture, and the resort totaled . The casino included the 270-seat Railhead Saloon, featuring live music. Also included were five restaurants and eight fast-food eateries. Among the five restaurants was a 522-seat buffet. In January 1995, Travel Holiday named the casino's The Broiler restaurant among the best restaurant values in the United States. Within three weeks of its opening, the hotel had a 93 percent occupancy rate. ===Operation and renovations=== Boulder Station sign in 2010 Boulder Station was built with room for potential expansions. In December 1995, Boulder Station added several new amenities, including an 11-screen movie theater operated by Act III Theatres. Also added was an child-care facility, and a video game arcade. In response to customer requests, Boulder Station opened an , 600-seat bingo parlor in June 1996. In the late 1990s, Boulder Station launched its Very Important Seniors (VI$) program, offering special discounts to the large number of nearby elderly residents. The program subsequently expanded to other Station casinos. In 1999, Boulder Station and Sunset Station became the first hotel-casino properties in the Las Vegas Valley to offer pedicab service, transporting customers to and from their cars in the parking lot. By April 1999, there were plans to add a 19-story hotel tower to the property, adding an additional 507 rooms. Tentative plans for a bowling alley and an expanded food court were approved in December 1999, as an early step towards eventual expansion plans. An expansion of the Railhead took place in 2000. In 2001, Station Casinos put out a request for proposals on expanding Boulder Station to include a bowling alley, an expansion and renovation of the casino, and the construction of a tunnel that would connect to the valet parking area. However, the company stated that such an expansion was not imminent, and that the cost, size and start date were still to be determined. A $50 million renovation began on Boulder Station ahead of the August 2008 opening of its new, nearby competitor, Eastside Cannery. The project included the renovation of the slot floor, the poker room, the sports book, the hotel rooms, and the opening of a new bingo room. Boulder Station's buffet was also remodeled. During this time, the Railhead was closed as a concert venue so it could operate as a temporary buffet while the original one underwent remodeling, which concluded in November 2008. During the remodel, upcoming concert acts from the Railhead were moved to other Station properties. A new table game, Two Cards High, was field-tested at Boulder Station during a 90-day trial period in 2009. A renovation of the hotel's 300 rooms was completed in October 2011, following renovations of the poker room, the Broiler Steakhouse, and the Feast Buffet. As of 2012, Boulder Station included Pasta Cucina, an Italian restaurant that received a \\"B+\\" in a review from the Las Vegas Review-Journal. As of Boulder Station's 20th anniversary, the property had retained 115 of its original employees from its opening day.

As of September 2016, Boulder Station had 1,200 employees; 576 of them were eligible to vote in a Culinary Workers Union ballot that sought representation from the union. That month, in a vote organized by the Culinary Workers Union and conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, employees voted in favor of unionizing Boulder Station by 355 to 177. Boulder Station would become the second Station Casinos property to be unionized, after the Station-managed Graton Resort & Casino in California ratified the company's first union contract in 2014. In August 2020, a majority of the union employees signed a petition asking that they no longer be represented by the Culinary union. The union filed an unfair labor practice charge against Station Casinos, alleging that the company had unlawfully withdrawn representation. Boulder Station is the second oldest Station Casinos property, after Palace Station.

On December 31, 2008, a 53-year-old man made a bomb threat against Boulder Station as part of a robbery attempt to pay his medical bills, prompting the evacuation of the casino area. The man was later arrested, and it was discovered that he had no bomb. In August 2016, a hotel employee was battered and sexually assaulted by a 22-year-old man in one of the rooms on the 10th floor. During the same month, a security officer for the property was patrolling the parking garage when he was beaten by three teenagers who took his gun. A shooting occurred in the parking lot in May 2017, when a man shot at another man in self-defense during an attempted robbery. In October 2017, a woman was robbed of her purse in the parking lot. In July 2018, two people exchanged shots at each other during an altercation in the parking lot.

He was a graduate of Saint Peter's College and the Fordham University School of Law. In 1940, he served on a committee of the New York State Assembly investigating allegations of Communist activities in schools and colleges in New York State. He joined the United States Navy during World War II, though he had initially been rejected due to an inability to see the color red, a story that he would frequently retell throughout his life. Morris was a commander of counterintelligence and psychological warfare, whose duties included writing propaganda items that were dropped over Japanese cities and interrogating captured prisoners. ===Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security=== Morris served as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Internal Security from 1951 to 1953, leaving the following year when he was elected to serve as a municipal court judge in New York City. He returned as chief counsel from 1956 to 1958. The New York Times described the subcommittee in 1951 as having a mandate that is practically \\"limitless in the whole field of security\\" and that its role \\"far overreaches the House Committee on Un-American Activities, as it far outreaches Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican of Wisconsin.\\" The subcommittee questioned businessmen, diplomats, scholars and schoolteachers, and opened investigations into an alleged Communist takeover of Hawaii, Communist control of the military-industrial complex, and Communist involvement on waterfront in New York City. One of the subcommittee's most notorious events was the April 1957 suicide of E. Herbert Norman, the Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, after Norman found out that the subcommittee was reopening an earlier investigation regarding his involvement in a Communist study group. The death affected American-Canadian relations, with Canadians calling his death the result of a \\"smear campaign\\" by the subcommittee. Morris had announced a month before the suicide that there was adequate material to justify an investigation into charges that Norman was a Communist. In a letter written to William F. Buckley, Jr. published in 1969, Whittaker Chambers gave Morris credit for much of the efforts attributed to Senator Joseph McCarthy, with Chambers stating that \\"I would say that Bob Morris really accomplished much of what the Senator is credited with\\". ===Political aspirations=== In January 1958, as a resident of Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey, Morris announced that he was running for the Republican Party nomination for the United States Senate from New Jersey, and would resign from his $13,000-a-year post as chief counsel as of January 31.via Associated press. \\"MORRIS TO ENTER SENATORIAL RACE; Subcommittee Counsel Will Resign and Seek G.O.P.

Forage fish, also called prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies, and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin and goldband fusiliers. Forage fish compensate for their small size by forming schools. Some swim in synchronised grids with their mouths open so they can efficiently filter plankton. These schools can become immense shoals which move along coastlines and migrate across open oceans. The shoals are concentrated energy resources for the great marine predators. The predators are keenly focused on the shoals, acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations themselves that can span thousands of miles to connect, or stay connected, with them.National Coalition for Marine Conservation: Forage fish The ocean primary producers, mainly contained in plankton, produce food energy from the sun and are the raw fuel for the ocean food webs. Forage fish transfer this energy by eating the plankton and becoming food themselves for the top predators. In this way, forage fish occupy the central positions in ocean and lake food webs.U.S. Geological Survey: Forage Fish Alaska Science Center The fishing industry catches forage fish primarily for feeding to farmed animals. Some fisheries scientists are expressing concern that this will affect the populations of predator fish that depend on them. ==In the oceans== Typical ocean forage fish are small, silvery schooling oily fish such as herring, anchovies and menhaden, and other small, schooling baitfish like capelin, smelts, sand lance, halfbeaks, pollock, butterfish and juvenile rockfish. Herrings are a preeminent forage fish, often marketed as sardines or pilchards. The term ‚Äúforage fish‚Äù is a term used in fisheries, and is applied also to forage species that are not true fish, but play a significant role as prey for predators. Thus invertebrates such as squid and shrimp are also referred to as \\"forage fish\\". Even the tiny shrimp- like creatures called krill, small enough to be eaten by other forage fish, yet large enough to eat the same zooplankton as forage fish, are often classified as \\"forage fish\\".Marine Fish Conservation Network: Forage fish: The Most Important Fish in the Sea {style=\\"background:darkgray; border:1px solid dimgray;color:white\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"230\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" cellpadding=10px cellspacing=0px +style=\\"background:darkgray; color:white\\"Ocean forage fish -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Anchovies width=\\"100\\"Caribbean reef squid width=\\"100\\"Menhaden -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Sardines width=\\"100\\"Shrimp width=\\"100\\"Northern krill } Forage fish utilise the biomass of copepods, mysids and krill in the pelagic zone to become the dominant converters of the enormous ocean production of zooplankton. They are, in turn, central prey items for higher trophic levels. Forage fish may have achieved their dominance because of the way they live in huge, and often extremely fast cruising schools. Though forage fish are abundant, there are relatively few species. There are more species of primary producers and apex predators in the ocean than there are forage fish. ===Ocean food webs=== right Forage fish occupy central positions in the ocean food webs. The position that a fish occupies in a food web is called its trophic level (Greek trophƒì = food). The organisms it eats are at a lower trophic level, and the organisms that eat it are at a higher trophic level. Forage fish occupy middle levels in the food web, serving as a dominant prey to higher level fish, seabirds and mammals. Ecological pyramids are graphical representations, along the lines of the diagram at the right, which show how biomass or productivity changes at each trophic level in an ecosystem. The first or bottom level is occupied by primary producers or autotrophs (Greek autos = self and trophe = food). These are the names given to organisms that do not feed on other organisms, but produce biomass from inorganic compounds, mostly by a process of photosynthesis. In oceans, most primary production is performed by algae. This is a contrast to land, where most primary production is performed by vascular plants. Algae ranges from single floating cells to attached seaweeds, while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by groups such as the seagrasses. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the littoral zone and shallow waters, where they attach to the underlying substrate and are still within the photic zone. Most primary production in the ocean is performed by microscopic organisms, the phytoplankton. Thus, in ocean environments, the first bottom trophic level is occupied principally by phytoplankton, microscopic drifting organisms, mostly one-celled algae, that float in the sea. Most phytoplankton are too small to be seen individually with the unaided eye. They can appear as a green discoloration of the water when they are present in high enough numbers. Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer (euphotic zone) of the sea. {style=\\"background:darkgray; border:1px solid dimgray;color:white\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"230\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" cellpadding=10px cellspacing=0px +style=\\"background:darkgray; color:white\\"Phytoplankton form the base of the ocean foodchain -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Phytoplankton width=\\"100\\"Dinoflagellate width=\\"100\\"Diatoms } The most important groups of phytoplankton include the diatoms and dinoflagellates. Diatoms are especially important in oceans, where they are estimated to contribute up to 45% of the total ocean's primary production. Diatoms are usually microscopic, although some species can reach up to 2 millimetres in length. The second trophic level (primary consumers) is occupied by zooplankton which feed off the phytoplankton. Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in oceanic surface waters, and include tiny crustaceans, and fish larvae and fry (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are filter feeders, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly. {style=\\"background:darkgray; border:1px solid dimgray;color:white\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"230\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" cellpadding=10px cellspacing=0px +style=\\"background:darkgray; color:white\\"Zooplankton form the second level in the ocean food chain -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Segmented worm width=\\"100\\"Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans width=\\"100\\"Juvenile planktonic squid } Particularly important groups of zooplankton are the copepods and krill. These are not shown in the images above, but are discussed in more detail later. Copepods are a group of small crustaceans found in ocean and freshwater habitats. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,Biology of Copepods at Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg and are important prey for forage fish. Krill constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish. Together, phytoplankton and zooplankton make up most of the plankton in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting organisms that float in the sea (Greek = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by plankton. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek phyton = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek zoon = animal). ===Diet=== Forage fish feed on plankton. When they are eaten by larger predators, they transfer this energy from the bottom of the food chain to the top and in this way are the central link between trophic levels.Forage fish: The most important fish in the sea Forage fish are usually filter feeders, meaning that they feed by straining suspended matter and food particles from water. They usually travel in large, slow moving, tightly packed schools with their mouths open. They are typically omnivorous. Their diet is usually based primarily on zooplankton, although, since they are omnivorous, they also take in some phytoplankton. Young forage fish, such as herring, mostly feed on phytoplankton and as they mature they start to consume larger organisms. Older herrings feed on zooplankton, tiny animals that are found in oceanic surface waters, and fish larvae and fry (recently hatched fish). Copepods and other tiny crustaceans are common zooplankton eaten by forage fish. During daylight, many forage fish stay in the safety of deep water, feeding at the surface only at night when there is less chance of predation. They swim with their mouths open, filtering plankton from the water as it passes through their gills. Ocean halfbeaks are omnivores which feed on algae, plankton, marine plants like seagrass, invertebrates like pteropods and crustaceans and smaller fishes. Some tropical species feed on animals during the day and plants at night, while others alternate summer carnivory with winter herbivory. They are in turn eaten by billfish, mackerel, and sharks. ===Predators=== Forage fish are the food that sustains larger predators above them in the ocean food chain. The superabundance they present in their schools make them ideal food sources for top predator fish such as tuna, striped bass, cod, salmon, barracuda and swordfish, as well as sharks, whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, sea lions, and seabirds. {style=\\"background:darkgray; border:1px solid dimgray;color:white\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"230\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" cellpadding=10px cellspacing=0px +style=\\"background:darkgray; color:white\\"Ocean predators of forage fish -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Tuna width=\\"100\\"Shark width=\\"100\\"Striped bass -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Leopard seal width=\\"100\\"Dolphin width=\\"100\\"Gannet } ===Schooling=== Underwater video loop of a school of herrings migrating at high speed to their spawning grounds in the Baltic Sea Forage fish compensate for their small size by forming schools. These sometimes immense gatherings fuel the ocean food web. Most forage fish are pelagic fish, which means they form their schools in open water, and not on the bottom (benthic fish) or near the bottom (benthopelagic fish). They are short-lived, and go mostly unnoticed by humans, apart from an occasional support role in a documentary about a great ocean predator. While we may not pay them much attention, the great marine predators are keenly focused on them, acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations that can span thousands of miles to connect with them. After all, forage fish are their food. Herring are among the most spectacular schooling fish. They aggregate together in huge numbers. Schools have been measured at over four cubic kilometres in size, containing about four billion fish.Radakov DV (1973) Schooling in the ecology of fish. Israel Program for Scientific Translation, translated by Mill H. Halsted Press, New York. These schools move along coastlines and traverse the open oceans. Herring schools in general have very precise arrangements which allow the school to maintain relatively constant cruising speeds. Herrings have excellent hearing, and their schools react very fast to a predator. The herrings keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or cruising predator like a killer whale, forming a vacuole which can look like a doughnut from a spotter plane.N√∏ttestad, L and Axelsen, BE (1999) Herring schooling manoeuvres in response to killer whale attacks Canadian Journal of Zoology, 77: 1540‚Äì1546. The intricacies of schooling is far from fully understood, especially the swimming and feeding energetics. Many hypotheses to explain the function of schooling have been suggested, such as better orientation, synchronized hunting, predator confusion and reduced risk of being found. Schooling also has disadvantages, such as excretion buildup in the breathing media and oxygen and food depletion. The way the fish array in the school probably gives energy saving advantages, though this is controversial.Pitcher, TJ and Parrish, JK (1993) Behaviour of Teleost Fishes, Chp 12: Functions of shoaling behaviour in teleosts Springer. On calm days, schools of herring can be detected at the surface a mile away by little waves they form, or from several meters at night when they trigger bioluminescence in surrounding plankton. Underwater recordings show herring constantly cruising at high speeds up to 108 cm per second, with much higher escape speeds. They are fragile fish, and because of their adaptation to schooling behaviour they are rarely displayed in aquaria. Even with the best facilities aquaria can offer they become sluggish compared to their quivering energy in wild schools. Copepod Slow motion video loop of a juvenile herring feeding on copepods ===Hunting copepods=== Copepods are a group of small crustaceans found in ocean and freshwater habitats. Many species are planktonic (drifting in the ocean water), while others are benthic (living on the sea floor). Copepods are typically one millimetre (0.04 in) to two millimetres (0.08 in) long, with a teardrop shaped body. Like other crustaceans they have an armoured exoskeleton, but they are so small that this armour, and the entire body, is usually transparent. Copepods are usually the dominant zooplankton. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet. The other contender is the Antarctic krill. But copepods are smaller than krill, with faster growth rates, and they are more evenly distributed throughout the oceans. This means copepods almost certainly contribute more secondary production to the world's oceans than krill, and perhaps more than all other groups of marine organisms together. They are a major item on the forage fish menu. Copepods are very alert and evasive. They have large antennae. When they spread their antennae they can sense the pressure wave from an approaching fish and jump with great speed over a few centimeters. Herrings are pelagic feeders. Their prey consists of a wide spectrum of phytoplankton and zooplankton, amongst which copepods are the dominant prey. Young herring usually capture small copepods by hunting them individually‚Äî they approach them from below. The (half speed) video loop at the left shows a juvenile herring feeding on copepods. In the middle of the image a copepod escapes successfully to the left. The opercula (hard bony flaps covering the gills) are spread wide open to compensate the pressure wave which would alert the copepod to trigger a jump.Kils, U (1992) The ecoSCOPE and dynIMAGE: Microscale tools for in situ studies of predator‚Äìprey interactions. Arch Hydrobiol Beih 36: 83‚Äì96 Herring ram feeding on a school of copepods Juvenile herring hunt for the very alert and evasive copepods in synchronization. (Click to animate). If prey concentrations reach very high levels, the herrings adopt a method called \\"ram feeding\\". They swim with their mouth wide open and their opercula fully expanded. Every several feet, they close and clean their gill rakers for a few milliseconds (filter feeding). In the photo on the right, herring ram feed on a school of copepods. The fish all open their mouths and opercula wide at the same time (the red gills are visible‚Äîclick to enlarge). The fish swim in a grid where the distance between them is the same as the jump length of their prey, as indicated in the animation below. In the animation, juvenile herring hunt the copepods in synchronization: The copepods sense with their antennae the pressure-wave of an approaching herring and react with a fast escape jump. The length of the jump is fairly constant. The fish align themselves in a grid with this characteristic jump length. A copepod can dart about 80 times before it tires out. After a jump, it takes it 60 milliseconds to spread its antennae again, and this time delay becomes its undoing, as the almost endless stream of herrings allows a herring to eventually snap the copepod. A single juvenile herring could never catch a large copepod. ===Migrations=== Coastal upwellings can provide plankton-rich feeding grounds for forage fish. Migration of Icelandic capelin Forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a particular stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern Norway, their feeding ground in Iceland, and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring. Fertile feeding grounds for forage fish are provided by ocean upwellings. Oceanic gyres are large-scale ocean currents caused by the Coriolis effect. Wind-driven surface currents interact with these gyres and the underwater topography, such as seamounts and the edge of continental shelves, to produce downwellings and upwellings.Wind Driven Surface Currents: Upwelling and Downwelling These can transport nutrients which plankton thrive on. The result can be rich feeding grounds attractive to the plankton feeding forage fish. In turn, the forage fish themselves become a feeding ground for larger predator fish. Most upwellings are coastal, and many of them support some of the most productive fisheries in the world. Regions of notable upwelling include coastal Peru, Chile, Arabian Sea, western South Africa, eastern New Zealand and the California coast. Capelin are a forage fish of the smelt family found in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of plankton at the edge of the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat krill and other crustaceans. The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. The migration is affected by ocean currents. Around Iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January. The diagram on the right shows the main spawning grounds and larval drift routes. Capelin on the way to feeding grounds is coloured green, capelin on the way back is blue, and the breeding grounds are red. In a paper published in 2009, researchers from Iceland recount their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around Iceland, successfully predicting the spawning migration route for 2008. Barbaro1 A, Einarsson B, Birnir1 B, Sigur√∞sson S, Valdimarsson S, P√°lsson √ìK, Sveinbj√∂rnsson S and Sigur√∞sson P (2009) \\"Modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish\\" Journal of Marine Science, 66(5):826‚Äì838. ===Predator attacks=== Schooling forage fish are subject to constant attacks by predators. An example is the attacks that take place during the African sardine run. The African sardine run is a spectacular migration by millions of silvery sardines along the southern coastline of Africa. In terms of biomass, the sardine run could rival East Africa's great wildebeest migration.Marine Scientists Scratch Heads Over Sardines Gannet Sardines have a short life-cycle, living only two or three years. Adult sardines, about two years old, mass on the Agulhas Bank where they spawn during spring and summer, releasing tens of thousands of eggs into the water. The adult sardines then make their way in hundreds of shoals towards the sub- tropical waters of the Indian Ocean. A larger shoal might be long, wide and deep. Huge numbers of sharks, dolphins, tuna, sailfish, Cape fur seals and even killer whales congregate and follow the shoals, creating a feeding frenzy along the coastline. When threatened, sardines instinctively group together and create massive bait balls. Bait balls can be up to in diameter. They are short lived, seldom lasting longer than 20 minutes. As many as 18,000 dolphins, behaving like sheepdogs, round the sardines into these bait balls, or herd them to shallow water (corralling) where they are easier to catch. Once rounded up, the dolphins and other predators take turns plowing through the bait balls, gorging on the fish as they sweep through. Seabirds also attack them from above, flocks of gannets, cormorants, terns and gulls. Some of these seabirds plummet from heights of , plunging through the water leaving vapour-like trails behind like fighter planes. The eggs, left behind at the Agulhas Banks, drift northwest with the current into waters off the west coast, where the larvae develop into juvenile fish. When they are old enough, they aggregate into dense shoals and migrate southwards, returning to the Agulhas banks in order to restart the cycle. ==Forage fisheriesHistory=== Scania (published 1555). Herring has been known as a staple food source since 3000 B.C. In Roman times, anchovies were the base for the fermented fish sauce called garum. This staple of cuisine was produced in industrial quantities and transported over long distances. Fishing for sardela or sardina (Sardina pilchardus) is an ongoing activity on the Croatian Adriatic coasts of Dalmatia and Istria. It traces its roots back thousands of years. The region was then largely a Venetian dominion, part of the Roman Empire. The area has always been sustained through fishing mainly sardines. Along the coast towns still promote the traditional practice of fishing by lateen sail boats for tourism and festivals. Pilchard fishing and processing thrived in Cornwall between 1750 and 1880, after which stocks went into an almost terminal decline. Recently (2007) stocks have been improving. The industry has featured in many works of art, including Stanhope Forbes and other Newlyn School artists. ===Contemporary=== Purse seine boats encircling a school of menhaden Commercial herring catch Traditional commercial fisheries were directed towards high value ocean predators such as cod, rockfish and tuna, rather than forage fish. As technologies developed, fisheries became so effective at locating and catching predator fish that many of the stocks collapsed. The industry compensated by turning to species lower in the food chain. In former times, forage fish were more difficult to fish profitably, and were a small part of the global marine fisheries. But modern industrial fishing technologies have enabled the removal of increasing quantities. Industrial-scale forage fish fisheries need large scale landings of fish to return profits. They are dominated by a small number of corporate fishing and processing companies. Forage fish populations are very vulnerable when faced with modern fishing equipment. They swim near the surface in compacted schools, so they are relatively easy to locate at the surface with sophisticated electronic fishfinders and from above with spotter planes. Once located, they are scooped out of the water using highly efficient nets, such as purse seines, which remove most of the school. Spawning patterns in forage fish are highly predictable. Some fisheries use knowledge of these patterns to harvest the forage species as they come together to spawn, removing the fish before they have actually spawned. Fishing during spawning periods or at other times when forage fish amass in large numbers can also be a blow to predators. Many predators, such as whales, tuna and sharks, have evolved to migrate long distances to specific sites for feeding and breeding. Their survival hinges on their finding these forage schools at their feeding grounds. The great ocean predators find that, no matter how they are adapted for speed, size, endurance or stealth, they are on the losing side when faced with the machinery of contemporary industrial fishing. Altogether, forage fish account for 37 percent (31.5 million tonnes) of all fish taken from the world's oceans each year. However, because there are fewer species of forage fish compared to predator fish, forage species fisheries are the largest in the world. Seven of the top ten fisheries target forage fish. The total world catch of herrings, sardines and anchovies alone in 2005 was 22.4 million tonnes, 24 percent of the total world catch.FAO (2005) Review of the state of world marine fishery resources. Fisheries technical paper T457, The Peruvian anchoveta fishery is now the biggest in the world (10.7 million tonnes in 2004), while the Alaskan pollock fishery in the Bering Sea is the largest single species fishery in the world (3 million tonnes). The Alaskan pollock is said to be the largest remaining single species source of palatable fish in the world.Clover, Charles. 2004. The End of the Line: How Overfishing is Changing the World and What We Eat. Ebury Press, London. However, the biomass of pollock has declined in recent years, perhaps spelling trouble for both the Bering Sea ecosystem and the commercial fishery it supports. Acoustic surveys by NOAA indicate that the 2008 pollock population is almost 50 percent lower than last year's survey levels. Some scientists think this decline in Alaska pollock could repeat the collapse experienced by Atlantic cod, which could have negative consequences for the entire Bering Sea ecosystem. Salmon, halibut, endangered Steller sea lions, fur seals, and humpback whales eat pollock and depend on healthy populations to sustain themselves.Greenpeace: Rethinking sustainability: A new paradigm for fisheries management ===Use as animal feed=== Eighty percent of the forage fish caught are fed to animals, in large part due to the high content of beneficial long chain omega-3 fatty acids in their flesh. Ninety percent is processed into fishmeal and fish oil. Of this, 46 percent was fed to farmed fish, 24 percent to pigs, and 22 percent to poultry (2002).World's Fish Catches Being Wasted As Animal Feed Terra Daily. Retrieved 1 December 2008.New Study to Highlight Waste of Seafood The FishSite. Retrieved 1 December 2008 Six times the weight of forage fish is fed to pigs and poultry alone than the entire seafood consumption of the U.S. market. One of the most promising alternatives to fish oil as a source of long chain omega-3 fatty acids and certain amino acids is algal oil from microalgae, the original source of these fatty acids in forage fish.Michael B. Rust, et al., The Future of Aquafeeds, NOAA/USDA Alternative Feeds Initiative, NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS F/SPO-124, December 2011, see http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/noaa_documents/NMFS/TM_NMFS_FSPO/NMFS_FSPO_tm124.pdf According to Turchini and De Silva (2008), another 2.5 million tonnes of the annual forage fish catch is consumed by the global cat food industry. In Australia, pet cats eat 13.7 kilograms of fish a year compared to the 11 kilograms eaten by the average Australian. The pet food industry is increasingly marketing premium and super-premium products, when different raw materials, such as the by-products of the fish filleting industry, could be used instead.Our pets‚Äô gourmet tastes are putting pressure on dwindling fish stocks ‚Äì Deakin University ===Environmental issues=== In 2008 the Sea Around Us Project completed a nine-year study of forage fish led by the fisheries scientists Jacqueline Alder and Daniel Pauly. They concluded that... In 2015 sardine populations crashed along the west coast of the United States, causing the fishery to close early and remain closed through the 2015‚Äì2016 season.Plunging sardine numbers spark quick management response Chinook Observer, 14 April 2015. A key reason for the population crash, was overfishing due to the demand of fish meals and fish oil used in feed for aquaculture and for human nutritional supplements.Fish Oil Market Analysis By Application (Aquaculture (Salmon & Trout, Marine Fish, Crustaceans, Tilapias), Direct Human Consumption) And Segment Forecasts To 2022 Grand View Research, February 2016. In an effort to provide some relief from the pressure put on forage fish populations, the World Bank along with the University of Arizona, Monterey Bay Aquarium and the New England Aquarium has sponsored a competition called the F3 (Fish-Free Feed) Challenge, which will award $200,000 to the most successful fish feed manufacturer who develops aquaculture feeds not made from fish.The Race to Find Fish Feeds That Don‚Äôt Bankrupt the Ocean National Geographic, 24 May 2016. ==In lakes and rivers== Forage fish also inhabit freshwater habitats, such as lakes and rivers, where they serve as food for larger freshwater predators. Usually smaller than 15 centimetres (6 in) in length, these small bait fish make up most of the fish found in lakes and rivers. The minnow family alone, consisting of minnows, chubs, shiners and daces, consists of more than fifty species.Kleber, John E (1992) The Kentucky Encyclopedia University Press of Kentucky, Page 320. Other freshwater forage fish include suckers, killifish, shad, bony fish as well as fish of the sunfish family, excluding black basses and crappie, and smaller species of the carp family. There are also anadromous forage fish, such as eulachon. {style=\\"background:darkgray; border:1px solid dimgray;color:white\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"230\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" cellpadding=10px cellspacing=0px +style=\\"background:darkgray; color:white\\"Freshwater forage fish -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Golden shiner width=\\"100\\"Killifish width=\\"100\\"Southern redbelly dace -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Chinese minnow width=\\"100\\"Swarm of carp width=\\"100\\"Twaite shad } In the context of human activity, within any fresh or saltwater ecosystem, there will always be both desirable and undesirable fishes, and this varies from country to country, and often from region to region within a country. Sport fishermen divide freshwater predators of forage fish into those: * which have a good fighting ability and are good to eat, called sport (or game) fish. * the other less desirable fish, called rough fish in North America and coarse fish in Britain Rough or coarse fish usually refers to fish that are not commonly eaten, not sought after for sporting reasons, or have become invasive species reducing the populations of desirable fish. They compete for forage fish with the more popular sport fish. They are often regarded as a nuisance, and are not usually protected by game laws. Forage fish generally are not considered rough or coarse fish because of their usefulness as bait. The term rough fish is used by U.S. state agencies and anglers to describe undesirable predator fish. In North America, anglers fish for salmon, trout, bass, pike, catfish, walleye and muskellunge. The smallest fish are called panfish, because they can fit in a standard cooking pan. Some examples are crappies, rock bass, perch, bluegill and sunfish. The term coarse fish originated in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century. Prior to that time, recreational fishing was the sport of the gentry, who angled for trout and salmon which they called \\"game fish\\". Fish other than game fish were disdained as \\"coarse fish\\".Lowerson, John (1993) Sport and the English middle classes, 1870‚Äì1914. Manchester University Press. These days, \\"game fish\\" refers to Salmonids (other than grayling) ‚Äî that is, salmon, trout and char. Coarse fish are made up mostly of the larger species of Cyprinids (carp, roach, bream) as well as pike, catfish, gar and lamprey. Coarse fish are no longer disdained; indeed, fishing for coarse fish has become a popular pastime. {style=\\"background:darkgray; border:1px solid dimgray;color:white\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"230\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" cellpadding=10px cellspacing=0px +style=\\"background:darkgray; color:white\\"Freshwater predators of forage fish -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Brook trout width=\\"100\\"Black crappie width=\\"100\\"Macquarie perch -align=\\"center\\" none none none -align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\"Rainbow trout width=\\"100\\"Pink salmon width=\\"100\\"Channel catfish } ==Bait and feeder fish== Forage fish are sometimes referred to as bait fish or feeder fish. Bait fish is a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage fish is a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. Bait fish, by contrast, are fish that are caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms overlap in the sense that most bait fish are also forage fish, and vice versa. Feeder fish is a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as forage fish, small fish that are eaten by larger fish, but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with fish in aquariums. ==Timeline== * 2006: The U.S. National Coalition for Marine Conservation asks U.S. fishery managers to put \\"Forage First!\\".

Frank P. Armstrong was the principal owner and manager. Ptarmigan's engines were over 60 years old, and had been originally built for a ferry crossing the St. Lawrence River. The engines had been previously installed in two other sternwheelers on the upper Columbia River, specifically the first Duchess, and the second Duchess. The blunt-ended bow of Ptarmigan allowed the vessel to be more capable of pushing barges, which increased the vessel's utility and effective cargo capacity.Downs, Art, Paddlewheels on the Frontier -- The Story of British Columbia and Yukon Sternwheel Steamers, at 101-112, Superior Publishing, Seattle WA 1972 ==Operations== Ptarmigan was placed on the Columbia River route that began at Golden and ran south, at least during high water, to Columbia Lake, the ultimate source of the Columbia River. In 1903, soon after completion, Ptarmigan was sold to the Columbia River Lumber Company, which hired Armstrong to manage its steamboat operations. In 1907 Ptarmigan hit a snag and sank (A snag is a sunken log jammed in the river bottom but sticking up through the water to just below the surface). Captain Armstrong was able to raise Ptarmigan and return her to service. However Ptarmigan caught fire later in 1907, and her upper works were destroyed. Again, Ptarmigan was salvaged, her upper works were rebuilt and she was returned to service. ==Race with launch Gian== The gasoline launch Gian, from which Northcote Cantlie taunted Captain Armstrong of Ptarmigan into racing. The gasoline engine was a new development in the early 1900s. Captain Northcote Cantlie, who has gone down in history as \\"an eccentric Scot\\" purchased a gasoline-engined launch, Gian, and placed her on the upper Columbia. Unlike Armstrong, Cantlie came from a wealthy background, drank champagne for breakfast, and kept a bagpiper as his personal attendant. Cantlie, knowing that Gian was at least theoretically faster than Ptarmigan made several challenges to Armstrong to race. There is a story that one day in late August 1906 Cantlie was out in his launch in the river at the same time as Ptarmigan. Cantle seized the moment and sped past Ptarmigan with his bagpiper blasting out airs as Gian sped past. This was too much for Captain Armstrong, a master steamboat man and veteran of the Klondike Gold Rush. Armstrong ordered full steam ahead, and when Ptarmigan caught up to Gian, two or three roustabouts reached over to Gian, seized the still-playing piper, and lifted him unharmed over to the foredeck of Ptarmigan while the piper reportedly never missed a note. Ptarmigan passed Gian and thereafter Cantlie steered clear of the big steamer.McCurdy, H.W., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 88-89, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 ==Dismantled== Ptarmigan was dismantled in 1909. Ptarmigan's engines, which had been under water at least twice when the vessels they powered sank (once with Ptarmigan, once with the first Duchess) were installed in another vessel, the Nowitka. ==NotesFurther reading== * Faber, Jim, Steamer's Wake‚ÄîVoyaging down the old marine highways of Puget Sound, British Columbia, and the Columbia River, Enetai Press, Seattle, WA 1985 * Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing, 75-78, 134, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1972 Category:Paddle steamers of British Columbia Category:Steamboats of the Columbia River Category:Columbia Valley Category:1903 ships ","title":"Ptarmigan (sternwheeler)"},{"id":"20441149","text":"The 1981 Dallas Cowboys season was their 22nd in the league.

The season began with four straight victories, followed by two losses (including a surprising 45‚Äì14 blowout loss to the 49ers in week six). The Cowboys rebounded to win 8 of their 9 games to clinch the NFC East but had to settle for the conference's number two seed behind the 49ers. The Cowboys easily defeated Tampa Bay in the divisional playoff to earn a rematch with the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. The game was much closer this time, and the Cowboys still held a 27‚Äì21 lead with less than a minute to play. However, Joe Montana led a late drive and hit Dwight Clark in the famous \\"Catch\\" to give San Francisco a 28‚Äì27 lead. On the ensuing Cowboys possession, Danny White completed a pass to Drew Pearson, and was only an arms length away from breaking free from Eric Wright and most likely scoring a touchdown. Jim Stuckey recovered a White fumble on the next play, then the 49ers ran out the clock for the win. == Offseason NFL Draft=Undrafted free agents=== {  + 1981 Undrafted Free Agents of note !Player !Position !College - Michael Downs Safety Rice - Angelo King Linebacker South Carolina State -fc0;\\" Everson Walls Cornerback Grambling State - Steve Wright Tackle Northern Iowa } ==Schedule== {   - ! style=\\"\\" Week ! style=\\"\\" Date ! style=\\"\\" Opponent ! style=\\"\\" Result ! style=\\"\\" Record ! style=\\"\\" Game Site ! style=\\"\\" Attendance ! style=\\"\\" Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 1  September 6  at Washington Redskins  W 26‚Äì10  1‚Äì0  RFK Stadium  55,045  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 2  September 13  St. Louis Cardinals  W 30‚Äì17  2‚Äì0  Texas Stadium  63,602  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 3   at New England Patriots  W 35‚Äì21  3‚Äì0  Schaefer Stadium  60,311  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 4  September 27  New York Giants  W 18‚Äì10  4‚Äì0  Texas Stadium  63,449  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 5  October 4  at St. Louis Cardinals  L 17‚Äì20  4‚Äì1  Busch Memorial Stadium  49,477  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 6  October 11  at San Francisco 49ers  L 14‚Äì45  4‚Äì2  Candlestick Park  57,574  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 7  October 18  Los Angeles Rams  W 29‚Äì17  5‚Äì2  Texas Stadium  64,649  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 8  October 25  Miami Dolphins  W 28‚Äì27  6‚Äì2  Texas Stadium  64,221  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 9  November 1  at Philadelphia Eagles  W 17‚Äì14  7‚Äì2  Veterans Stadium  72,111  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 10   Buffalo Bills  W 27‚Äì14  8‚Äì2  Texas Stadium  62,583  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 11  November 15  at Detroit Lions  L 24‚Äì27  8‚Äì3  Pontiac Silverdome  79,694  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 12  November 22  Washington Redskins  W 24‚Äì10  9‚Äì3  Texas Stadium  64,587  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 13  November 26  Chicago Bears  W 10‚Äì9  10‚Äì3  Texas Stadium  63,499  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 14  December 6  at Baltimore Colts  W 37‚Äì13  11‚Äì3  Memorial Stadium  54,871  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 15  December 13  Philadelphia Eagles  W 21‚Äì10  12‚Äì3  Texas Stadium  64,955  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 16   at New York Giants  L 10‚Äì13  12‚Äì4  Giants Stadium  73,009  Recap } Division opponents are in bold text ==Game notesWeek 1=Week 2=Week 3=Week 4=Week 5=Week 6=Week 7=Week 8=Week 9=Week 10=== Pro- Football-Reference.com ===Week 11=Week 12=== Pro-Football-Reference.com ===Week 13=Week 14=Week 15=Week 16=Playoffs== {   - ! style=\\"\\" Round ! style=\\"\\" Date ! style=\\"\\" Opponent ! style=\\"\\" Result ! style=\\"\\" Game Site ! style=\\"\\" Attendance ! style=\\"\\" Recap - !

He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New York Rangers, as well as HC Sparta Praha of the Czech Extraliga (ELH). He was selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the sixth round (182nd overall) of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. Deveaux was born in Freeport, Bahamas, but he is a naturalized Canadian citizen who was raised in Welland, Ontario. ==Playing career== Initially drafted by the Montreal Canadiens, 182nd overall in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, Deveaux made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut with the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 27, 2008, against the Ottawa Senators. In addition to playing with the Maple Leafs, Deveaux has been a member of the Toronto Marlies, Chicago Wolves and Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Johnstown Chiefs of the ECHL. Deveaux is the first person born in the Bahamas to play in the NHL. On February 12, 2010, after getting penalized for a melee in a game between the Marlies and the Manitoba Moose in Winnipeg involving almost all the players on the ice, Deveaux was alleged to have been taunted with racial slurs by a fan while in the penalty box. Deveaux subsequently threw a roll of hockey tape in the heckler's direction and was suspended for three games by the AHL. On August 24, 2010, Deveaux signed as a free agent to a one-year contract to return to the AHL's Chicago Wolves. On August 16, 2011, Deveaux signed as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers. On November 25, 2011, while playing for the Rangers, Deveaux was suspended by the NHL for three games, for delivering an illegal check to the head of forward Tomas Fleischmann in a game against the Florida Panthers on November 23, 2011.Deveaux suspended for three games - New York Rangers - News Deveaux was eligible to return December 1, 2011, however instead Rangers president and general manager Glen Sather announced Deveaux had been assigned to the Connecticut Whale of the AHL. On July 9, 2012, Deveaux signed a one- year contract as a free agent with the Panthers. With the NHL lockout in affect, Deveaux was directly assigned to Florida's AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage. On March 19, 2013, during a game in Cedar Park, Texas, against the Texas Stars, Deveaux was accidentally high-sticked in the face. As he fell to the ice he slid underneath teammate Nolan Yonkman, knocking him over. As Yonkman tried not to fall he accidentally stepped on Deveaux's face, with full force. The resulting cut required dozens of stitches to close. On March 26, 2015 during a game between VIK V√§ster√•s HK and R√∂gle BK, Per Helmersson checked Deveaux into the boards, resulting in Deveaux losing consciousness. At the following game, Deveaux attacked VIK V√§ster√•s HK defenseman Per Helmersson from behind during the warmups for a game between VIK V√§ster√•s and R√∂gle BK in Swedish league HockeyAllsvenskan. On March 30, after video of the incident was posted on YouTube, R√∂gle terminated Deveaux's contract for next season. Swedish prosecutors subsequently issued an arrest warrant for Deveaux in response to the incident. On May 8, Deveaux and his wife held a press conference in Toronto, outlining his side of the incident and describing the lingering effects of the Helmersson hit. Deveaux took a hiatus and returned to the professional during the 2016-17 season in agreeing to a try-out with Czech club, HC Sparta Praha of the Czech Extraliga on January 26, 2017. Keen to prove a point with his play rather than his past, Deveaux secured a contract for the remainder of the season on February 3, 2017. Over the final stretch of the season, he contributed with a goal and assist in 4 games. On October 20, 2017, the Sheffield Steelers announced that they had signed Deveaux whilst announcing that his hiatus was due to injury. On the November 28, 2017, Sheffield announced his release after posting 4 points in 6 games. He continued the season abroad, playing out the remainder of the year in Slovakia with HK Dukla Trenƒç√≠n of the Slovak Extraliga. ==Personal== He currently works as a firefighter with Toronto Pearson Airport's Fire and Emergency Services. == Career statistics == { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em;\\" - e0e0e0;\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - e0e0e0;\\" !

He is commonly referred to by his nickname Piojo (\\"Louse\\"). A former defender, Herrera began his career playing with second division side Deportivo Neza in 1985, then transferring to Tecos UAG in 1987, and making his debut in the Primera Divisi√≥n in 1988. After a brief period with Santos Laguna, in 1989 Herrera transferred to Atlante and went on to play for the club on three occasions, winning his only league championship as a player during the 1992‚Äì93 season. He also had a notable career with Toros Neza, making over 100 appearances for the club from 1995 until 1997. He retired with Atlante in 2000. Herrera was also a Mexican international, participating in the 1993 Copa Am√©rica tournament in which Mexico finished runner-up. As a manager, Herrera was in charge of Atlante in 2002, and again in 2010. He also coached Monterrey, managing them to two finals in 2004 and 2005, losing to UNAM and Toluca. He went on to coach Veracruz in 2008, and Estudiantes Tecos from 2008 until 2010. In November 2011, Herrera was announced as manager of Club Am√©rica, with whom he won his first league championship in 2013. In 2018, he won a second Liga MX title in his second spell with the club. In October 2013, Herrera was named interim coach of the Mexico national team to guide them through the intercontinental playoff matches against New Zealand to qualify for the 2014 World Cup. After Mexico won the playoff and gained qualification, Herrera's job was extended to coaching the team during the World Cup. He ultimately extended his contract until 2018. Despite leading Mexico to the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup, he was sacked as coach of the national team after an alleged physical altercation with a reporter. ==Club career== Herrera made his debut in 1985 with second division side Deportivo Neza. Originally a forward, he switched to playing as a defender after his move to Tecos UAG in 1987. Herrera made his debut in the Primera Divisi√≥n on 22 May 1988 in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Atlas. He transferred to Santos Laguna in 1988, making 30 appearances and scoring four goals. He had his first stint with Atlante in 1989, making 36 appearances and scoring four goals before moving to Quer√©taro in 1990. He again transferred to Atlante in 1991, and won his first league title during the 1992‚Äì93 season after defeating Monterrey in the finals by a 4‚Äì0 aggregate score after winning the first-leg 1‚Äì0 and the second 4‚Äì0. He would remain at the club until 1995, making 125 appearances and scoring nine goals. Herrera was then sold to Toros Neza, with whom he would play in his second league final during the \\"Verano '97\\" season, ultimately losing to Guadalajara by an aggregate score of 7‚Äì2. In 1999, Herrera returned to Atlante for a third time before officially retiring in 2000. ==International career== Herrera participated with the Mexico national team in the 1993 Copa Am√©rica tournament held in Ecuador. Mexico went on to reach the final against Argentina, losing 1‚Äì2. Herrera played in all of Mexico's matches during the qualifying stages for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, though he was omitted from the final squad list by coach Miguel Mej√≠a Bar√≥n. ==Managerial careerAtlante=== In 2002, two years after retiring, Herrera came back to coach his former club Atlante. He would remain manager for two years, but resigned in 2004 after failing to take Atlante to a final. ===Monterrey=== For the Apertura 2004, Herrera was named head coach of Monterrey. He coincidentally faced his former club Atlante in the semifinals, with Monterrey advancing by an aggregate score of 7‚Äì3. He ultimately failed to make Monterrey champions, losing to UNAM in the final by an aggregate score of 3‚Äì1. He succeeded in taking Monterrey to another final in the Apertura 2005 tournament, but failed once more, this time losing to Toluca with an aggregate score of 6‚Äì3. Herrera would continue to be manager of Monterrey until the Apertura 2007 tournament, where his contract was terminated in September 2007 due to continuous poor form. ===Veracruz=== Prior to the Clausura 2008, Herrera was hired as manager of Veracruz after the resignation of Antonio Mohamed. A stand-out victory for Herrera was a 4‚Äì0 home victory over Club Am√©rica on 29 March 2008. He was in charge of preventing Veracruz from being relegated to the Primera Divisi√≥n A, though Veracruz were inevitably relegated. Herrera parted ways with the club in May 2008. ===Estudiantes Tecos=== Shortly after leaving Veracruz, Herrera was hired to manage a struggling Estudiantes Tecos midway into the Apertura 2008 tournament to replace Jos√© Luis Trejo.

In the fourth game of the season, starting quarterback Gary Danielson suffered a dislocated wrist, which ended his season. Backup quarterback Jeff Komlo finished the game and was named the starter for the next week. In the next two games, Komlo struggled. The Lions lost both of those games. Head Coach Monte Clark made the decision to give third-string quarterback Eric Hipple start on a Monday Night game against the Chicago Bears. In front of approximately 71,000 fans, Clark's gamble paid off as the Lions defeated the Bears 48-17.

Antenna beam width should be very small to enhance resolution. This antenna size limitation demands high frequency (GHz range) of operation, to be operated in this mode. AGS radar is typically a medium or low power radar. It includes both maritime and land surveillance. Today, UAVs perform this operation, which often uses optical aids for surveillance. The earliest Airborne ground surveillance system was the H2S (radar). == Aircraft == * US Air Force Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS * US Navy Boeing P-8 Poseidon * Russian Air Force Tupolev Tu-204R * British Royal Air Force Raytheon Sentinel * US Air Force Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk * Tethered Aerostat Radar System * JLENS ==See also== * Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance * Alliance Ground Surveillance ‚Äì a NATO programme to acquire an AGS capability. * Unmanned aerial vehicle * Synthetic aperture radar ==External links== * NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance Category:Radar ","title":"Airborne ground surveillance"},{"id":"20441402","text":"Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) is a NATO programme to acquire an airborne ground surveillance capability (Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program on the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk).

A professional competitor since 2003, Daley has formerly competed for the UFC, Bellator MMA, Cage Rage, Final Fight Championship, Strikeforce, EliteXC, ShoXC, BAMMA, Cage Warriors, Cage Contender, Shark Fights, Pancrase, and Impact FC. Daley is a former Cage Rage World Welterweight Champion and Cage Rage British Welterweight Champion. ==Background== Born and raised in England to parents from the Caribbean, Daley began training in karate at the age of eight, before transitioning into Muay Thai. Daley is also a former member of the British Army, having served as a reconnaissance driver for the Household Cavalry. At the age of 18, Daley began training in mixed martial arts after graduation from Carlton-Le-Willows Academy. Daley has two children with his long term partner Elizabeth Houston, Tai Daley and Ayana Daley. They live in Nottingham, England. ==Mixed martial arts careerEarly career=== Daley made his professional debut in 2003 and compiled a record of 2-2 before signing with startup promotion Cage Rage. ===Cage Rage=== Following a TKO win over Jess Liaudin, Daley fought for the Cage Warriors Welterweight Championship against Abdul Mohamed. The fight ended in a draw after five rounds. Daley next fought veteran Paul Jenkins at Cage Rage 11 for the Cage Rage British Welterweight Championship, a rematch of their fight at Cage Warriors 8, which ended in a knockout win for Daley. The two fought to a draw in the rematch. Daley had compiled a record of 10-4-2 and was coming off of a win over UFC veteran Dave Strasser before being offered another shot at the Cage Rage British Welterweight Championship, against Ross Mason. Daley won via majority decision, becoming the new Cage Rage British Welterweight Champion. After defending his title twice and picking up a knockout win over Duane Ludwig in Strikeforce, Daley was scheduled to make his third title defence in a title unification against Cage Rage World Welterweight Champion Mark Weir at Cage Rage 23. Daley won via second-round knockout, therefore holding both titles. After two more knockout wins in the ShoXC and Cage Warriors promotions, Daley fought Jake Shields at EliteXC: Heat for the EliteXC Welterweight Championship. Daley lost via armbar submission in the second round, snapping a six-fight winning streak. Daley then compiled a record of 3‚Äì1 in his next four fights with two appearances for the MFC in Canada. Daley was scheduled to fight Jay Hieron at Affliction: Trilogy, but the bout was cancelled due to Affliction Entertainment folding. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== Following Affliction's collapse, Daley signed a four- fight contract with the UFC. Daley's first fight was scheduled to be on the preliminary card of UFC 103 against Brian Foster, which was due to air on ESPN (UK), prior to the main card. However, on 4 September, it was announced that Paul Daley had agreed to step in for Mike Swick, who suffered an injury during training and was unable to fight top contender Martin Kampmann at UFC 103. In his UFC debut, Daley put in an aggressive performance, defeating Kampmann via technical knockout due to a barrage of punches. Daley was expected to face Carlos Condit on 2 January 2010 at UFC 108. However, Condit withdrew from the card after suffering a severe cut to his hand. He was replaced by Dustin Hazelett. After failing to make the stipulated 170 lb for the Hazelett fight, Daley was fined 10% of his fight purse. The bout was fought at a catchweight of 172 lbs. Early in the fight Daley dropped Hazelett with a left hook, then followed up with additional punches, winning by knockout. Welterweight contendership At UFC 113, on 8 May 2010, Daley fought Josh Koscheck, with the winner destined to become the next challenger against Georges St-Pierre for the UFC Welterweight Championship and the opportunity to coach against St- Pierre on the twelfth season of The Ultimate Fighter. In the first round, Koscheck appeared to simulate being hit with an illegal knee, which resulted in a point deduction for Daley. Koscheck went on to control Daley with his wrestling for most of the fight, and was declared the winner by unanimous decision. After the end of the third and final round, Daley approached Koscheck from behind and attempted to hit him in the face with a left hook. Referee Dan Miragliotta pinned Daley against the fence to subdue him.UFC 113 DVD, Machida Vs Shogun In an interview at the conclusion of the event, UFC president Dana White announced that he was banishing Daley from the UFC for life. White said, \\"There's no excuse for that. These guys are professional athletes. You don't ever hit a guy blatantly after the bell like that, whether you're frustrated or not.\\" He added, \\"I don't care if he fights in every show all over the world and becomes the best and everybody thinks he's the pound- for-pound best in the world, he will never fight in the UFC ever again.\\" White also said that when he spoke to Daley after the fight, he claimed he had not heard the bell. Daley apologised for his actions after returning to the United Kingdom, saying that Koscheck's trash-talking pushed him over the edge, but that there was \\"no excuse\\" for his \\"rash decision.\\" He was suspended 30 days by the Quebec Athletic Commission. ===BAMMA=== Daley's fight against Yuya Shirai was supposed to be for the BAMMA welterweight belt, but Daley came in over the 170-pound limit for a title bout. The two still headlined the card, but it became a non-title fight. Daley dropped Shirai immediately with a jab, which was his first strike in the fight, and later he dropped him again with an uppercut and left hook before finishing the fight with ground and pound. ===Strikeforce=== Following win over Jorge Masvidal in the Shark Fights promotion,https://www.sherdog.com/events/SF-13-Jardine-vs-Prangley-14141 Daley signed a multi-fight deal with Strikeforce and made his promotional debut against Scott Smith on 4 December 2010 at Strikeforce: Henderson vs. Babalu II. Daley won by KO at 2:09 of round 1. In the post-fight interview, he called out lightweight K.J. Noons. After his victory over Scott Smith, Daley received the title shot against Nick Diaz. Daley fought Nick Diaz on 9 April 2011 at Strikeforce: Diaz vs. Daley. Diaz won by TKO three seconds from the end of the first round, marking the first time Daley had been stopped by strikes. After a 3-month hiatus, Daley was expected to face Evangelista Santos at Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Henderson, but Santos withdrew due to a shoulder injury and was replaced by Tyron Woodley. The winner of this fight was expected to fight for the vacant Strikeforce Welterweight Championship against a fighter yet to be named. He lost the bout via unanimous decision, with all three judges scoring the fight 29-28 in favour of Woodley. Daley fought against Kazuo Misaki at Strikeforce: Tate vs. Rousey. He lost the bout via split decision. After some months, Daley requested to be released from his Strikeforce contract, citing a lack of frequent fights as the reason for his wanting to leave. ===Independent promotions=== Daley defeated Daniel Acacio at an Impact Fighting Championships event in Sydney, Australia. Speaking after his victory, Daley revealed that he expected to sign with Strikeforce or DREAM \\"real soon.\\" Daley faced Jorge Masvidal at Shark Fights 13: Jardine vs. Prangley in September 2010, and won via unanimous decision. Before the fight, he weighed in three-quarters of a pound overweight and was forced to give up 15% of his \\"show purse\\". Daley was next scheduled to fight twice in just over five weeks. The first bout was against UFC veteran Jordan Radev at BAMMA 7, and the second bout was against UFC and MFC veteran Luigi Fioravanti at Ringside MMA 12 - Daley vs. Fioravanti. Daley won both via unanimous decision. Daley was expected to fight in a kickboxing bout at UCMMA 26 against Luke Sines for his 'UK1' Welterweight Championship, however, due to contract obligations, Daley had to pull out of the fight due to contract problems with Strikeforce. ===Bellator MMA=== On 15 June, a week after being released from his Strikeforce contract, Daley signed with Bellator Fighting Championships. Daley had a successful debut at Bellator 72 against Rudy Bears in a welterweight fight, defeating him by first-round TKO due to strikes. Daley was next scheduled to fight at Bellator 79 in Rama, Ontario, Canada on 2 November against Kyle Baker, but the fight never took place. Daley was selected in a fan vote to fight War Machine in the first Bellator fight to be shown on Spike TV, however injury forced his opponent out of the upcoming Welterweight tournament. Daley himself was then removed from the tournament after being barred from entering the United States after being arrested in December in relation to an alleged bar fight in England. He faced up to two years in prison if convicted. Daley later claimed the charges had been thrown out for lack of evidence, clearing him to apply for a visa to compete within Bellator's ninth season. On 25 July, Bellator announced that Daley had been released from the organisation due to ongoing legal troubles. Bellator officials had learned that the charges in the bar fight had not been dropped after all. In fact, Daley had pleaded guilty to one count of assault and two counts of obstructing an officer. The violent nature of the incident, combined with the prospect of continued visa problems due to the fact he was now a convicted felon, made Bellator officials decide to cut ties with Daley. ===Return to BAMMA=== On 6 August 2013, it was reported that Daley had signed a 3-fight, 12-month contract with BAMMA. His first fight back in the British promotion was against Romario Manoel da Silva at BAMMA 14 on 14 December. He defeated da Silva by KO at 1:42 of the 2nd round, after dominating the 1st round. Daley won via TKO in a fight against Alexander Surjko at Legend 3: Pour Homme in Milan, Italy on 5 April 2014, dropping the Russian three times in the third round and forcing referee Joop Ubeda to stop the fight. At BAMMA 16, Daley defeated Marinho Moreira da Rocha by knockout on 13 September 2014. ===Return to Bellator=== On 21 July 2014, Bellator MMA announced that they had signed Paul Daley along with Melvin Manhoef. Daley was expected to challenge Douglas Lima for the Bellator Welterweight Championship on 27 February 2015 at Bellator 134. However, Lima pulled out of the fight due to injury. Daley instead faced Andr√© Santos. He won the fight by unanimous decision. Daley faced Dennis Olson at Bellator 140 on 17 July 2015. He won the fight via TKO in the second round. In his third fight for Bellator in less than a year, Daley faced Andy Uhrich in the main event at Bellator 148 on 29 January 2016. He won the fight via knockout due to a right uppercut two minutes into the first round. Daley's next fight was scheduled to be a rematch against Josh Koscheck at Bellator London, as the co-main event, on 16 July 2016. On 6 June Koscheck withdrew from the fight for undisclosed reasons and he was replaced by former Bellator Welterweight Champion Douglas Lima. A welterweight bout between Daley and Derek Anderson at Bellator 163 was scrapped on the day of the event after Daley fell ill from effects of his weight cut. Daley next faced Brennan Ward in the co-main event at Bellator 170 on 21 January 2017. He won the fight via flying knee in the first round. Daley faced Rory MacDonald in the main event at Bellator 179 on 19 May 2017. He lost via rear-naked choke in the second round. Daley faced Lorenz Larkin at Bellator 183 on 23 September 2017. Daley won the fight via knockout in the second round. In January 2018, Daley publicly criticised Bellator MMA, stating he would leave the company after his contract expired because he felt the company was not properly utilising him. A week later on 25 January, Daley claimed to have been granted his release from the organisation, which Bellator denied. On 2 March 2018 Bellator MMA announced that Daley would fight Jon Fitch at Bellator 199 in San Jose, CA. He lost the fight by unanimous decision. Despite publicly demanding release from Bellator, Daley announced that he had signed a new contract with Bellator on late June 2018. Daley faced Michael Page as part of the Bellator Welterweight World Grand Prix Tournament on 16 February 2019 at Bellator 216. The fight was largely uneventful, with neither fighter able to deliver any significant offence. Daley lost by unanimous decision. Daley faced Erick Silva at Bellator 223 on 22 June 2019. He won the fight by unanimous decision. Daley was expected to face Sabah Homasi at Bellator 232 on 26 October 2019. However, Homasi withdrew from the bout due to injury and was replaced by Saad Awad. Daley won the fight via TKO in the second round. Daley was rescheduled to face Sabah Homasi at Bellator 241 on 13 March 2020. However, the whole event was eventually cancelled due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. Daley was then scheduled again to face Derek Anderson at Bellator 247 on 1st October 2020. However, he was not unable to make weight and was hospitalised, leading to the bout being scrapped. After the incident, Daley announced that he will retire after his next bout. ==Kickboxing career== Daley has had five kickboxing wins since returning to the sport in August 2014, when he defeated Latvian champion Artem Mironcev on 16 August in Bournemouth, England at the Phoenix Fight Night 3 event. Daley won the fight by TKO in round 3. ==Weight issues== Daley has had a history of missing weight in fights, with the BAMMA 7 weigh-in marking the 6th time in the previous 14 fights that Daley had missed weight for a fight. Two separate bouts with Derek Anderson at Bellator 163 and Bellator 247 were cancelled due to weight-cutting related issues of Daley. ==Championships and accomplishmentsMixed martial arts=== *Cage Rage Championships **Cage Rage World Welterweight Championship (One time; Last) **Cage Rage British Welterweight Championship (One time) *Strikeforce **2010 Knockout of the Year vs. Scott Smith on 4 December *Ultimate Fighting Championship **Knockout of the Night (One time) **2009 Newcomer of the Year *FX3 **FX3 Welterweight Championship (One time) *Sherdog **2010 All-Violence Third Team ===Kickboxing=== *2014 Contender Promotions Kickboxing World Welterweight Champion *2008 King of The Ring World Muay Thai Welterweight Champion *King of The Ring European Muay Thai Champion ==Mixed martial arts record== -

It was written and composed by Scott-Heron and Jackson for their first collaborative album, Winter in America (1974). The song was recorded on October 15, 1973 at D&B; Sound Studio in Silver Spring, Maryland and produced by Scott-Heron and Jackson with assistance from engineer Jose Williams. \\"Rivers of My Fathers\\" is a soul song with a jazz arrangement. Scott-Heron's Afrocentric lyrics make references to African-American cultural roots and slavery. Although it was not released as a single, the song was recognized by writers for its instrumentation and theme of cultural significance, and regarded as one of Scott-Heron's best compositions. ==CompositionMusical style=== Brian Jackson co-wrote the song and played piano. \\"Rivers of My Fathers\\" is a soul song, performed with a jazz-based arrangement spanning over eight minutes; the longest track issued on Winter in America. Recorded on October 15, 1973 at D&B; Sound Studio in Silver Spring, Maryland, the session for the song, as well as Winter, featured a scaled-down lineup of Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson, with drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens, as well as a limited personnel for production.Track listing and credits as per liner notes for Winter in America CD reissue With Scott-Heron, Jackson and audio engineer Jose Williams heading production, these circumstances provided an effective forum for a reliance on strong African and R&B; influences during the conception of \\"Rivers of My Fathers\\".MacArthur, Paul J.

The opening instrumentation continues into the first two minutes, before Scott-Heron enters with vocals. Usually a spoken word performer, Scott-Heron's baritone voice accompanies and adds weight to the dark groove by vocalizing poetry, providing the lyrical subject matter to the composition.Dedina, Nick. About: Gil Scott-Heron. Rhapsody. Retrieved on 2009-03-20. ===Lyrical theme=== Similar to the lyrical themes predominant on Winter in America, Scott-Heron's lyrics are Afrocentric and focus on cultural identity through the use of metaphor. Illustrating the significance of ancestry and cultural roots, \\"Rivers of My Fathers\\" features the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, which evokes feelings of home and freedom, to represent faith amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As a metaphor, water was also used to hold the promise of freedom; runaway slaves used the rivers during slavery in the United States both as markers of direction and as a method of disguising their scent from hound dogs. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, \\"Looking for a way out of this confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you carry me home.\\" In his interpretation of Scott-Heron's lyrics, music writer and author Mtume ya Salaam explained \\"Gil sings of 'looking for a way out' out of the cold, hard city; he wants to 'lay down by a stream' that is 'miles away from everything.' But he‚Äôs too far away from home, there is no way out‚Äîinstead of warm, open fields and flowing waters, there is only brick, asphalt and mortar.\\" Following several vocal deliveries of whole choruses, the narrator pleads to the \\"river\\" to take him home, which is revealed at closing seconds of the song as Scott- Heron silently says \\"Africa\\". ==Interpretation== Due to its lyrical content, critics and music writers have made interpretations and comparisons of the song to Toni Morrison's 1977 novel Song of Solomon, as their themes both adhere to ancestral and cultural identity. Writer Mtume ya Salaam has also made this comparison, as he later stated in an article for the website Kalamu: In addition to its recognition for the literary allusion to Songs of Solomon, \\"Rivers of My Fathers\\" has been recognized by critics and music writers as one of Winter in America's best recordings, as well as one of Gil Scott-Heron's best compositions.Weisbard (1995), pp. 267-268. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from album liner notes. * Gil Scott-Heron ‚Äì vocals, producer * Brian Jackson ‚Äì piano * Danny Bowens ‚Äì fender bass * Bob Adams ‚Äì drums (traps) * Jose Williams ‚Äì engineer, production assistance ==References Bibliography == * * ==External links== * Category:1974 songs Category:Gil Scott-Heron songs ","title":"Rivers of My Fathers"},{"id":"20441589","text":"The Osgood Mountains are a mountain range in Humboldt County, Nevada.

While Bokm√•l has for the most part derived its forms from the written Danish language and Danish-Norwegian speech, Nynorsk gets its orthographical standards from Aasen's reconstructed \\"base dialect\\", which are intended to represent the distinctive dialectical forms. Both standards use a 29-letter variant of the Latin alphabet. ==Alphabet== The Norwegian alphabet is based upon the Latin alphabet and is identical to the Danish alphabet. Since 1917 it has consisted of the following 29 letters. {class= - !colspan=2Letter !Name - A a  - B b  - C c  - D d  - E e  - F f  - G g  - H h  - I i  - J j  or - K k  - L l  - M m  - N n  - O o  - P p  - Q q  - R r  - S s  - T t  - U u  - V v  - W w  - X x  - Y y  - Z z  - √Ü √¶  - √ò √∏  - √Ö √•  } The letters c, q, w, x and z are not used in the spelling of indigenous Norwegian words. They are rarely used; loanwords routinely have their orthography adapted to the native sound system. ==Diacritics== Norwegian (especially the Nynorsk variant) also uses several letters with diacritic signs: √©, √®, √™, √≥, √≤, √¢, and √¥. The diacritic signs are not compulsory,Norwegian language council: The use of accents (in Norwegian) but can be added to clarify the meaning of words (homonyms) which otherwise would be identical. One example is ein gut (\\"a boy\\") versus √©in gut (\\"one boy\\"), in Nynorsk, as opposed to En Gutt in Bokm√•l. Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably √º, √°, √† and √©, following the conventions of the original language. The Norwegian vowels √¶, √∏ and √• never take diacritics. The diacritic signs in use include the acute accent, grave accent and the circumflex. A common example of how the diacritics change the meaning of a word, is for: * for (preposition. For or to, Bokm√•l and Nynorsk) * f√≥r (verb. Went, in the sense went quickly, Bokm√•l and Nynorsk. Only to be used with the pronoun, vi) * f√≤r (noun. Furrow, only Nynorsk) * f√¥r (noun. Fodder, feed, fodder, Bokm√•l and Nynorsk) √í can be used in √≤g, meaning \\"also\\". This word is found in both Nynorsk and Bokm√•l. An example of √™ in Nynorsk is the word v√™r, meaning \\"weather\\". An example of √® in Bokm√•l is karri√®re meaning \\"career\\". A macron-like diacritic can be used for decorative purposes both in handwritten and computed Bokm√•l and Nynorsk or to denote vowel length such as in d≈´ (you), lƒÅ (infinitive form of \\"to let\\"), lƒìser (present form of \\"to read\\") and l≈´ft (air).

The new letter came from the Swedish alphabet, where it had been in official use since the 18th century. The former digraph Aa still occurs in personal names. Geographical names tend to follow the current orthography, meaning that the letter √• will be used. Family names may not follow modern orthography, and as such retain the digraph aa where √• would be used today. Aa remains in use as a transliteration, if the letter is not available for technical reasons. Aa is treated like √Ö in alphabetical sorting, not like two adjacent letters A, meaning that while a is the first letter of the alphabet, aa is the last. This rule does not apply to non-Scandinavian names, so a modern atlas would list the German city of Aachen under A but list the Danish city of Aabenraa under √Ö. The difference between the Dano-Norwegian and the Swedish alphabet is that Swedish uses the variant √Ñ instead of √Ü, and the variant √ñ instead of √ò ‚Äî similarly to German. Also, the collating order for these three letters is different: √Ö, √Ñ, √ñ. ==Computing standards== Swedish computer keyboard with white markings for common characters, red for Norwegian (√ò, √Ü), light green for Danish (√Ü, √ò) and blue-green for Estonian (√ú, √ï, ¬ß, ¬Ω).

As one of China‚Äôs most visible contemporary practitioners of the post-Tiananmen period, Zhu is known for his subtly quizzical critique of politics and society in a rapidly evolving China. Faithful to that country‚Äôs quintessentially classical artistic medium, Chinese painting, the Beijing-born-and-based Zhu is principally a painter. In recent years, however, the artist has broadened his formal reach to include print- making as well as figurative sculpture. His China China series of monumental Mao-jacket-clad Chinese cadres, begun in 2000, has achieved iconic status. In most of his works, his vision often seems anguished and alienated, personal and political at the same time. ==Biography== Zhu Wei was born in Beijing in 1966. As a teenager, Zhu entered the military. His soldiering days ended when he was admitted to the People's Liberation Army Art Academy, finishing in 1989. After a few years of painting propaganda art for the motherland, his unit was demobilized in 1992. In the following year he went to study at the Beijing Academy of Film. Despite his educational background and association with the artistic values of state sanctioned art, Zhu has an incredible knowledge of Chinese tradition and spends enormous effort in perfecting his ink washes (also called Chinese painting), a technique popularized by Taoist artists in fourth and fifth centuries. His works are widely collected in Europe, the United States, Asia and often feature in international auctions. ==Exhibitions== Hubei Museum of Art, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, City Gallery Wellington, Beijing Today Art Museum, Williams College Museum of Art,http://wcma.williams.edu/module_item/china-diary-no-52/ China National Convention Center, Art Gallery of China National Academy of Painting, Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes Cuba, BELvue Museum of Belgium, National Contemporary Art Center of Greece, the State Tretyakov Gallery of Russia, Nanjing Museum, Art Complex Museum of Massachusetts, Asian Art Museum of San Francisco,http://searchcollection.asianart.org/view/objects/asitem/search$0040/1/title- asc/designation-asc?t:state:flow=f904487e-9337-43f9-9d1d-f230cb982cf5 Guangdong Museum of Art, Shenzhen Art Museum, Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology,http://jameelcentre.ashmolean.org/collection/921/object/19722 the National Art Museum of China, Grand Palais of France, Singapore Museum of Contemporary Arts, Jiangsu Art Museum, etc. ==References== * World Within World Without by Karen Smith, Asian Art News, Volume 6 Number 5, SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER, 1996, p. 66 & cover * The Pleasures and Profits in Chinese Art by Meredith Berkman, TIME, Volume 150 Number 9, September 1, 1997, p. 32 * The most influential 100 Asians of the 20th century, TIME, Volume 154 Number 7/8, August 23, 1999, p. 90 * Zhu Wei, TalkAsia, interviewed by Mike Wallace, reported by Veronica Pedrosa, CNN, 2000 * Zhu Wei by Victoria Finlay, Asian Art, April, 2001, p. 12 * Living Large-China new wave of modern art by Hannah Beech, TIME, Volume 160 Number 18, NOVEMBER 11, 2002, p. 49 * Extravagant Ways by Jonathan Thomson, ASIAN ART NEWS, Volume 15 Number 3, MAY/JUNE 2005, p. 50 * Zhu: Looking for 'something simple' by Alexandra A.

It forms one of the most dominant geographical features in the Reno/Sparks area. Early prospectors to the mountain discovered wild pea vines growing in the vicinity of Peavine Springs on the northeast flank of the mountain, near Poeville, hence the name. == Geology == Much of the northern Truckee Meadows is built atop Peavine alluvium, most significantly from just west of Lake Park in Northwest Reno, across the campus of the University of Nevada-Reno, and toward Proctor Hug High School in Northeast Reno. Above these alluvial deposits, the sediments become coarser and are frequently interspersed with diatomaceous material.H. F. Bonham, Jr. and E. C. Bingler Geologic Map of the Reno Quadrangle, Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 1973 Where the gentler lower slopes of the foothills join the significantly steeper slopes of the mountain proper, the sediments give way to their igneous parents. U.S. Highway 395 traverses the so-called Alta Formation, which is composed largely of pyroxene andesite flows, flow breccia, and laharic breccia. On the flanks of Peavine Mountain, the Alta Formation is frequently interrupted by rhyolite plugs and hornblende andesites of the Kate Peak Formation. The higher reaches of the mountain display large outcroppings of granodiorite, many of which predominate the features on the upper reaches of the south slope. In addition, one of the most common features of Peavine's geology is the so-called Peavine Sequence, Mesozoic-aged altered and unaltered metavolcanic rock composed of a variety of material including rhyolite flows and pyroclastics, dacite, andesite, and laharic breccias. == History  Native American Presence=== With the discovery of dozens of archaeological sites on Peavine and in the surrounding areas, it is apparent that aboriginal Great Basin cultures were active in this area. The predominant cultures were those of the Washo and Northern Paiute peoples, their artifacts having been found at locations ranging from Bull Ranch, at the southern terminus of Bull Ranch Creek on the southern flank of the mountain, to the shores of White Lake north of the Peavine (Many of these sites have been found above the 6,000 foot level). Extant artifacts have been traced to both the Kings Beach (ca. 500-1500 A.D.) and Martis (ca. 2000 B.C. to 500A.D.) cultures at sites primarily located within the Truckee River drainage.Mentzelia, No. 6, Part 1, 1992: Janet L. Nachlinger, et al, ed. pp. 50-57 === Modern History and Development=== Mineral values were extracted from placer deposits as early as 1856 by prospectors returning to California. These small-scale operations lasted only as long as the water in the stream beds permitted, at which times the miners would clear off and move on. Such intermittent placer mining continued through the 1860s. A prospector named John Poe, allegedly a cousin of Edgar Allan Poe, came to the area ca. 1862, and soon established the Poe Mining Company. He began work at the Paymaster Mine, and developed and platted the townsite of Poeville on the northeast side of the mountain.Mentzelia, No. 6, Part 1, 1992: Janet L. Nachlinger, et al, ed. pp. 59-62 Poeville maintained a post office from September 1, 1874 to March 22, 1878. Aside from Poeville, at least two townsites developed, however briefly, on or immediately near Peavine Mountain: * Webster, named for Daniel Webster, was platted in August, 1873Mentzelia, No. 6, Part 1, 1992: Janet L. Nachlinger, et al, ed. p. 60 by \\"Parties interested in the Peavine District, (who) laid out a town in the vicinity of the mines...\\" * Brooklyn, named for the New York Borough, was settled in March, 1875, on the southeast face of the mountain about midway between Reno and Verdi. Established by one Charles W. Bever, by 1876 the town was home to five families and contained a dozen or so buildings, although the 'boom' was to be short lived. Later that same year, John Poe persuaded Bever into a newfound interest in another operation on the eastern flank of the mountain, and Brooklyn was finished. In March 1879, the remaining buildings were purchased and moved into Reno. == Recreation == Due to its proximity to the Reno-Sparks area, Peavine is attractive to and popular with all varieties of outdoor enthusiasts. Under the stewardship of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, many miles of hiking and mountain bike trails have been added, and the varied geography provides a range of challenges. Peavine is also a favorite for off-road vehicles, although access has become increasingly restricted in the past fifteen years from Northwest Reno, due largely to residential building in that area. The HTNF maintains assorted access points across this area on the southwest flank of the mountain, some allowing for motor vehicles, with others designed for pedestrian traffic; access from the east and the north is substantially less regulated. To service and install the towers and stations located at the peak and on several promontories, an access road was constructed, curling up the north and east faces of the mountain. Weather permitting, this road is passable by most two-wheel-drive vehicles with modest undercarriage clearance and extends to the uppermost summit. == References == Category:Mountains of Nevada Category:Mountains of Washoe County, Nevada ","title":"Peavine Peak"},{"id":"20441713","text":"The Peko Hills are a mountain range in Elko County, Nevada. == References == Category:Mountain ranges of Nevada Category:Mountain ranges of the Great Basin Category:Mountain ranges of Elko County, Nevada ","title":"Peko Hills"},{"id":"20441717","text":"The .476 Enfield, also known as the .476 Eley, .476 Revolver, and occasionally .455/476,Barnes, p.175, \\".476 Ely/.476 Enfield Mk-3\\". is a British centrefire black powder revolver cartridge. The Enfield name derives from the location of the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock, the armoury where British military small arms were produced, while Eley was a British commercial brand. Used in the Enfield Mk II revolver, the Mk III variant was introduced by the British Army in 1881, supplanting the earlier .476 Enfield Mark I and II cartridges, which in turn had replaced the .450 Adams cartridges, all of which also used black powder propellant. ==HistoryBritish service use=== The .476 Enfield cartridge was only in British service for a comparatively short period before it was replaced by the black powder-loaded .455 Webley Mark I in 1887 and then by the smokeless powder-loaded .455 Webley Mark II in September 1897. Just over 1,000Maze, p.32. Enfield Mark IIs were issued to the North- West Mounted Police, and these remained in service until 1911, when the last Enfields were phased out in favour of more modern (and reliable) .45 Colt New Service revolvers. ===Interchangeability=== Using the same bullet as the .455 (11.6mm) Webley Mark I, the .476 casing is 0.05 mm (0.002 in) longer and carries a charge of 18 gr (1.17 g) of black powder, compared to 6.5 gr (0.42 g) of cordite in the .455 Mark I. While the .476 Enfield cartridge could be used in any British-manufactured .455 Webley calibre service revolver, there were issues with the later-production Colt or Smith & Wesson .455 Revolver models, which were liable to have slightly smaller bore diameters. Despite the difference in designation, the .476 readily interchanged with the earlier .450 Adams and .455 Webley rounds (the latter in black powder Mark I and smokeless Marks II through VI), as well as the .455 Colt (a U.S. commercial brand for the same .455 Webley round, with slightly different ballistics),Barnes, p.174, \\".455 Revolver MK-1/.455 Colt\\". which all use the same .455 in (11.6mm) bullet, the distinction being which diameter was measured. Officially, .450 Adams, .476 Enfield, and .455 Webley cartridges can all be fired in the Webley Mark III British Government Model revolver;Geoffrey Boothroyd, The Handgun (Crown Publishers, 1970). although case length, bullet weight and shape, and powder charge differ, all three cartridges feature a case diameter of .476 inch with a bullet diameter of .455 inch, which can be fired in a barrel of .450 inch bore. ==See also== *List of cartridges by caliber *List of handgun cartridges *List of rifle cartridges *Table of handgun and rifle cartridges *11mm caliber ==NotesReferences== *Barnes, Frank C., ed. by John T.

Before its release, in February 2007, the now defunct Dutch publication E-dition magazine published an article about Australis in its last issue (#16) before ceasing operations. The magazine included two tracks from this album in the audio compact disc that accompanied each issue. These tracks were \\"The Gates of Reality\\" and \\"Paqta Kutemunqa\\". On December 23, 2008, the British electronic music online organization Morpheus Music interviewed Australis about the release of this album.Morpheus Music interviewwith Australis In contrast with Australis' first album, Lifegiving, this album took over three years to be completed and released. ==Overview== The Gates of Reality has fourteen musical tracks in a variety of styles that include ambient music, electronic music, ethnic music, world music and symphonic music. Unlike his first release, this album introduces vocal elements on several of its tracks, evidence of a brand new area of musical exploration for this artist. To accomplish this, he enlisted the participation of several musical collaborators in its production: Virginia Luna, Alvaro Aguayo (who also collaborated in one track for Lifegiving), Mornie Sims and Rebecca Farraway. One of the tracks in this album, titled \\"The Hoodoo's Whisper\\", was co-composed and co-produced by Australis and his long-time friend, the Spaniard composer‚Äìproducer Roger Subirana. As with his first release, a strong feature of The Gates of Reality is the variety of styles between its tracks. They jump from style to style in complete freedom producing a sensation of substance and diversity while causing a certain perception of being transported through several different places, cultures and/or states of mind. Musically, this album presents a solid instrumental foundation on each track, which allows even his most simplistic tracks to remain clean and delicate; while also allowing the more dramatic and elaborated tracks to become powerful and intense. Conceptually, Australis declares this release explores the relationship between the human being and its own imagination; taking inspiration in fantasy, in reality, and in the cryptic bonds between the two. ==Track listing== # \\"The Gates of Reality\\" - 5:18 # \\"Return to Tarshish\\" - 5:04 # \\"Ephemerage\\" - 5:34 # \\"Promises of Light\\" - 4:50 # \\"Paqta Kutemunqa\\" - 4:29 # \\"Purple Dreams\\" - 5:12 # \\"Little Clockmaker\\" - 3:58 # \\"Treasure the Moment\\" - 4:10 # \\"Illusion of Company\\" - 5:56 # \\"The Hoodoo's Whisper\\" - 5:33 # \\"Thresholds of Devotion\\" - 4:32 # \\"Momentary Truths\\" - 5:05 # \\"Essentia\\" - 3:23 # \\"Adventus Sortis\\" - 7:09 ==Tracks overview== * The first track has the same title as the album. It starts by creating the ambient of a normal, busy city. The sound of steps approach and enter through what sounds like a heavy door. Once the door closes, the sounds of the city disappear and the listener experiences the sensation of having crossed into another dimension. A mysterious musical introduction develops into the rhythmic beginning. A simple yet engaging piano melody ensues carrying the listener into a thematic and powerful refrain. Vocal interventions together with electronic elements make this track a strong opening for the rest of the compilation. * \\"Return to Tarshish\\", the second track, departs from the somewhat up-tempo style of the first track. From the beginning it builds a highly atmospheric sonic landscape featuring long evolving textures, sound effects and the highly evocative voice of a soprano singing in the distance. As the track develops, a slow percussion gives entrance to an introductory melody. The instrumentation on this track, although almost entirely electronic, produces the impression of a strong ethnic ambient. Arpeggios enter as the track approaches its climax, ending in an intense soprano solo. * \\"Ephemerage\\" starts with the sound of a distant impact or explosion after which, a growing texture unchains an engaging rhythm. Electronic arpeggios set the foundation for melancholic verses followed by pre-choruses where an acoustic guitar provides a romantic twist. These elements lead to an intense refrain where electronic instruments and a piano build a dramatic segment. Vocal elements and more acoustic guitar are present later in the track as it reaches its final refrain, before evolving into the next track. * In contrast with the preceding track, \\"Promises of Light\\" begins with a growing environmental foundation that leads to an introduction where long sequences prepare the mood - going from major to minor chords, and back - for the rhythmic second half of this track. Quickly after the percussion begins, an ethereal female voice talks in English. Although the words don't reveal the subject of this track, it suggests that the expression \\"promises of light\\" refers to children as the hope for human kind. * Paqta Kutemunqa is the first ethnic track of this album. Although subtle electronic instruments can be identified in the background, Australis gathers again styles and instruments from his native South America to build a strong dramatic track. The piece starts with the sounds of a mountainous landscape where a male voice is speaking into the wind in a native language. The track develops quickly reaching climaxes at several spots. Charango and zampo√±a give this track a very distinctive character while adding to its dramatism and epic nature. * The sixth track, Purple Dreams, changes styles presenting a slow- tempo sequence with uplifting and somewhat nostalgic connotations. Mixing electronic (synthesizers) with acoustic (accordion, piano) instruments, the piece produces a relaxing effect during its first third. After that, the music turns a little darker with a more intense rhythm in which oboes, clarinets, cello and an emotional violin outline evocative melodies. As the piece approaches its ending, it returns to the initial sequences, taking the listener back to more relaxing perceptions. * The Little Clockmaker is the first orchestral piece of the album. It begins with an arpeggio of bells over which a lullaby-like melody - also by bells - sets an emotional and melancholic mood. From there, strings, winds, woodwinds and percussion develop into a magical yet innocent environment. In the tempo of waltz (something also seen in Australis' \\"The Enchantment\\", from Lifegiving), this piece doesn't seem to fit in the New Age genre. Instead, it genuinely falls into the classical genres. * Treasure the Moment switches styles again, presenting some of the engaging characteristics from smooth jazz and easy listening; along with new age's characteristics like long and deep evolving pads, electronic rhythms and an overall sensation of acoustic spaciousness. Over this foundation, piano takes the bulk of the melodic responsibility, building sensible melodies for the verses and an enchanting refrain, producing uplifting and inspiring results. * Illusion of Company is a more electronic piece. It starts with dark pads and sound effects which slowly lead to the apparition of a filtered rhythmic base, along with some arpeggios. Accordion, piano and electric guitar take turns developing the initial melodies. As the piece moves towards its middle, a highly filtered male voice intervenes speaking through several sound effects. After that, an instrumental segment ensues building towards the climax end where the male voice returns repeating some of its earlier sentences. * The Hoodoo's Whisper is the second orchestral piece of the disc. From its structure and acoustic characteristics, this piece could fit into the soundtrack and epic genres. According to information publicly available, this track was composed by Australis together with Spaniard composer Roger Subirana. The track begins with a low pitch pad along the sounds of flutes and native wind instruments, slowly building towards a climax where ethnic rhythms take over and introduce the listener into a luminous segment where string ensembles outline victorious melodies. After that, the intensity recedes and the piece evolves to a much darker mood where chords turn into minors producing sensations of danger. The rhythm restarts with tense connotations and the orchestra swells with apprehensive shades. A distant choir adds accents here and there and even a thunder can be heard at the peak of intensity. Later however, as the piece reaches its last segment, the intensity subsides and the nature of the music returns to the positive side of emotions, taking the listener back to safety. * The eleventh track, Thresholds of Devotion, is the only other ethnic track of this album. This one however is stylistically located in the Middle East. A dark beginning where an oriental voice introduces the listener to a rich acoustic environment, quickly presents a wide variety of peculiar instruments and voices with sounds and timbres not frequently heard in the western world. The introduction ends when the full rhythm develops and the string ensemble takes over along with strange wind instruments, creating a very well accomplished middle eastern atmosphere. * Momentary Truths uses environmental sounds to position the listener in an open space close to what sounds like an ocean's shore. This slow-tempo piece starts with a piano outlining a nostalgic melody. As the piece develops, piano, clarinet, violin and even a trumpet go hand in hand, combining with electronic instruments as they accentuate the mood set by the introduction. A slow but contagious rhythm in the background adds fluidity to the piece, engaging the listener with sensations that go from the sad to the hopeful. Towards the end, after a violin and a trumpet measure against each other, the track finishes the same way it started: with the sounds of water on a beach. * Essentia is the third orchestral piece of the album. It begins with a delicate melody in piano against which violins slowly grow in the background. As the string ensemble grows, a solo violin comes to introduce the listener to the climax of the piece. In contrast with the initial verse, the refrain is intense and epic with horns, oboes and a percussion that reminds battle drums. After that, the piece retreats to the delicate structure from the beginning ending in soft but emotional chords. * The last track, \\"Adventus Sortis\\", is a return to the electronic new age genre. It begins with long, spacious pads that quickly lead to vocal gregorian interventions that remind of the early music of Enigma. Quickly taking a darker turn, an exotic rhythm starts as the introduction to long verses. The verses consist of electronic leads along with synthesized winds, again, bringing the early music of Enigma to mind. Oboe and other woodwind instruments can also be heard as the track progresses. Towards the middle of the track, the piece changes its structure. First the rhythm disappears in the back and the music gives place to another gregorian choir intervention. After that the rhythm starts again ensuing the long yet intense last segments. The refrain is repeated several times, each one more complex and elaborated than the previous one. Finally, the last refrain is reached in a climax of instrumentation that leads to the last gregorian participation before the track ends dramatically. ==Personnel== * Australis (Oscar Aguayo) - composer, record producer * Virginia Luna - collaborator, vocalist in \\"The Gates of Reality\\" * Alvaro Aguayo - collaborator, charango player and vocalist in \\"Paqta Kutemunqa\\" * Roger Subirana - co-composer and co-producer in \\"The Hoodoo's Whisper\\" * Mornie Sims - collaborator, singer in \\"Return to Tarshish\\" * Rebbecca Farraway - collaborator, vocalist in \\"Promises of Light\\" ==References * The Gates of Reality, a track-by-track review * Australis' Official site - includes audible samples from this album * Essential Noises record label * Morpheus Music * Sonic Immersion Category:Australis (musical project) albums Category:2008 debut albums ","title":"The Gates of Reality"},{"id":"20441761","text":"Petersen Mountain is a mountain range in Washoe County, Nevada. == References == Category:Mountain ranges of Nevada Category:Mountain ranges of Washoe County, Nevada ","title":"Petersen Mountain"},{"id":"20441784","text":"The Pilot Mountains are a mountain range in Mineral County, Nevada. == References == Category:Mountain ranges of Nevada Category:Mountain ranges of Mineral County, Nevada ","title":"Pilot Mountains"},{"id":"20441878","text":"William, Lord Vaux of Harrowden, 1575 William Vaux, 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden (before 14 August 1535 ‚Äì 20 August 1595) was an English peer.

Written in 1923‚Äì24, it was premiered in Leeds Town Hall on October 7, 1925, conducted by Albert Coates with Dorothy Silk as soloist. The same performers gave the work's second performance three weeks later in Queen's Hall, London. The work is sometimes known as the First Choral Symphony, although a planned 'second Choral Symphony' never progressed beyond some uncompleted sketches.Holst (1986), pp. 77, 157 == Structure == The symphony is written in a traditional four-movement structure; nevertheless, the setting of the Ode on a Grecian Urn and the Scherzo can also be performed separately.Holst, New Grove, 8:663. * Prelude: Invocation to Pan 'O Thou, whose mighty palace roof doth hang' * Movement 1 ** Part 1.

Solo: Spirit here that reignest! == Overview Composition=== By 1923, Holst enjoyed a substantial reputation as a choral composer. That year he was chosen by the organizers of the 1925 Leeds Triennial Festival to write a new work for that event. Holst accepted the commission. Turning to the poetry of John Keats for his text, Holst set various unrelated passages that stimulated his musical imagination. For the introduction and first movement he chose stanzas from the chorus of shepherds in Endymion and from the Roundelay in Book IV of the poem. The second movement became a setting of the Ode on a Grecian Urn. The Scherzo uses much of \\"Fancy and Folly's Song\\" a short piece published in Extracts from an Opera. For the finale Holst chose the lines \\"Spirit here that reignest\\" which the poet had written in a copy of Beaumont and Fletcher's plays; this was followed by extracts from the Hymn to Apollo, most of the Ode to Apollo and the ode Bards of Passion and of Mirth. The work thus became a four-movement choral symphony, with the vocal parts fully integrated in the overall musical texture instead of being added to the orchestra as an extra element. ===Reception=== Though it seems that the Leeds premiere was well-received, the London performance had a poor effect, due largely to an inadequate rehearsal of a demanding piece.Mitchell, pp. 307‚Äì8 The work never recovered from that disastrous outing, and there were plenty of pundits prepared to pour scorn on the work. Literary purists were offended by the juxtaposition of unrelated elements from Keats' poems. Music critics scorned the work, accusing Holst of not pouring enough debauchery into the Bacchanale. Singers found the work difficult. Audiences showed little enthusiasm. Even Holst's friend, composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, admitted that he felt only a \\"cold admiration\\" for it.Holst, New Grove, 8:661. After the initial performances the symphony fell into neglect. From this point Holst's popularity as a composer waned.Short, 2. ===Planned second Choral Symphony=== Holst began planning a 'second Choral Symphony', based on poems by George Meredith, but only made some initial fragmentary sketches. These sketches are now located at the British Museum in London.Holst, New Grove, 8:663. ==Bibliography == *Holst, Imogen, ed.

They are native to the warm-temperate to tropical marine waters in the western Pacific Ocean. They are little-known bottom-dwellers that feed on small invertebrates such as crustaceans, molluscs, and worms. The fanray is found inshore to a depth of 60 m on rocky or rock sandy bottoms. Platyrhina species have rounded, heart-shaped pectoral fin discs with short, blunt snouts. Their tails are long and shark-like, slightly flattened with lateral ridges. The two dorsal fins and the caudal fin are large and rounded; the caudal fin lacks a lower lobe. The teeth are small and arranged in pavement- like rows for crushing shelled prey.‰∏≠ÂõΩÂõ¢ÊâáÈ≥ê. ÁôæÂ∫¶ÁôæÁßë. Retrieved November 28, 2008. Their bodies are covered with minute dermal denticles; also, several rows of denticles are located inside the buccopharyngeal cavity. The shape of these denticles in Platyrhina and the similar Platyrhinoidis distinguish them from all other guitarfish species. Large thorns occur around the eyes and on the shoulders, and are arranged in rows along the back and tail. Unlike Platyrhinoidis, Platyrhina species have an additional lateral row of thorns on both sides of the tail, and no rostral thorns. As far as known, they are ovoviviparous, with the developing fetuses primarily sustained by large yolk sacs. Research on fanrays in Ariake Bay, Japan, indicates they are faster- growing, earlier-maturing, and shorter-lived than many other ray species. Male fanrays mature at 2.1 years and females at 2.9 years; the females grow larger and more slowly than males. The maximum known age is 5 years for males and 12 years for females. These rays are typically inoffensive, but care should be exercised regarding their large, sharp thorns. ==Species== * Platyrhina hyugaensis Iwatsuki, Miyamoto & Nakaya, 2011 (Hyuga fanray) * Platyrhina sinensis Bloch & J.

It typically grows to a length of and a weight of , with a brown upperside and a white underside. It eats fish and crustaceans and has poor mobility. Males live to age five and females to age twelve, with both sexes maturing between two and five years. The species is found in China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and possibly Indonesia, in waters shallower than . It is probable that its population is declining due to being caught as a bycatch. == Description == The fanray grows to a maximum known length of , but most specimens are long and weigh . Its body is flat throughout and shaped like a fan. The species' upperside is brown in color, its underside white, and the edge of its body yellow. It has wide nostrils, small eyes, a short snout, and a transversal through its mouth splitting it. It has multiple small teeth and thorn-like scales on the upperside of its body. == Behavior == The fanray eats small fish and crustaceans, specifically shrimp and mysids. To feed, it usually stays on the sea floor until there is an opportunity to capture food; it is a nocturnal species. It exhibits oviparity and mates in April or May. It swims slowly, due to the fact that its only way to move is by moving its tail forwards and backwards. Males have a lifespan of five years, maturing between two and four years, while females have a lifespan of twelve years, maturing between three and five years. Both sexes mature when between and in total length, females at a slightly larger size than males. Specimens at Ariake Bay, the most common area the species occurs in, were surveyed from May 2002 to September 2006 for their age, growth, and sexual maturity. The survey revealed that females grow slower than males but achieve a greater total length as an adult. It also determined that in comparison to other related species, the ray grows and matures quickly, and lives for a short amount of time. == Habitat and distribution == The fanray lives in the western Pacific Ocean in waters up to deep, generally between and in coastal areas with a sandy sea floor. In particular, it is found off the coasts of China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and possibly Indonesia. The species is the most abundant elasmobranch species in Ariake Bay, Ky≈´sh≈´, and is also common in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. The species is caught as bycatch in gillnets and trawls, sometimes being discarded but other times made use of. However, its population has not been negatively affected by these activities. Its flesh can be eaten fresh or after being dried. Its exact population or population trend is unknown, but its population in the East China Sea is known to be decreasing due to trawling activities. The fact that it lives in shallower waters makes it easy to be caught by fisheries. The species is the most common in several countries in the Northern part of its range. Currently, no conservation actions or restrictions are taking place on behalf of the species. Because of its probable population decline, the IUCN Red List lists it as a vulnerable species. ==References * Platyrhina sinensis on FishWise Pro * Platyrhina sinensis on BoldSystems * Platyrhina sinensis on Discover Life * Platyrhina sinensis on Marine Barcoding of Life Category:Myliobatiformes Category:Fish described in 1801 Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Fanray"},{"id":"20442002","text":"\\"Let's Make the Water Turn Black\\" is a patter song which first appeared on the 1968 Mothers of Invention album We're Only in It for the Money and later on the 1995 compilation album Strictly Commercial. An uptempo instrumental version is featured on the 1991 live album Make a Jazz Noise Here. ==Background== \\"Let's Make The Water Turn Black\\" tells the true story of brothers Ronald and Kenneth Williams (referred to as \\"Ronnie\\" and \\"Kenny\\" respectively), neighbors of the song's composer Frank Zappa in the early 1960s, when he was living in Ontario, California. It says that while their father, known as \\"Daddy Dinky\\" (Dalton Williams), was away at work \\"selling lamps and chairs to San Ber'dino squares\\" and while their mother (Signa), worked \\"feeding all the boys at Ed's Caf√©\\" (on Holt Blvd. in Ontario, Ca.), the brothers occupied their after-school time with such activities as igniting each other's flatulence. In the original release, a reference to their mother \\"in her apron and her pad\\" was cut from the record; although the reference was about an order pad, a record executive thought it was a veiled reference to a sanitary napkin.* Further references can be found in the opening line of the chorus: \\"Whizzing and pasting and pooting through the day\\". \\"Whizzing\\" referred to Kenny's need to urinate in jars because he and Mothers of Invention saxophone player Jim \\"Motorhead\\" Sherwood were living in a garage on the Williams property, one which lacked plumbing. The results were \\"Kenny's little creatures on display\\", a reference to what Zappa described in a 1987 interview with Rolling Stone as \\"mutant tadpoles\\" which had appeared over time in the urine and could be seen swimming in it. \\"Pasting\\" is a reference to another part of the song which states that Ronnie saved his \\"pneumies\\" on a bedroom window, described rather bluntly in the song as \\"dysentery green\\". During the aforementioned Rolling Stone interview, Zappa related how the mess was soon discovered by the boys' mother. So thick was the dried mass that removal required \\"chisels and Ajax\\".http://www.arf.ru/Notes/Woiftm/tblack.html Notes and comments at www.arf.ru \\"Pooting\\" refers to the act of flatulating. The song's final verse includes references to the boys' adulthood, namely how Ronnie had joined the military, Kenny was \\"taking pills\\" and how they both yearned \\"to see a bomber burn\\". This may have a double meaning both as a reference to the burgeoning movement against the Vietnam War and as a reference to an African-American nickname for an exceptionally large marijuana cigarette. The final line, \\"Wait 'til the fire turns green,\\" may be a final reference to igniting each other's flatulence. While the song itself is up to interpretation Frank Zappa discusses the song in detail in the book by Frank Zappa and Peter Occhiogrosso titled The Real Frank Zappa Book. The song title and lyric \\"Let's make the water turn black\\" are in reference to Ronnie and Kenny's procedure for producing alcohol from raisins. The lyric \\"Ronnie helping Kenny helping burn his poots away\\" is a reference to lighting farts. Ronnie would light Kenny's poots on fire, \\"wait till the fire turns green,\\" then use the burning plastic as a heat source to heat the raisins prior to the fermenting process. It ends when recording engineer Dick Kunc opens the talkback line to the recording studio to introduce \\"a little bit of vocal teenage heaven right here on earth\\". What follows are several seconds of backwards, distorted, guttural vocalizing by Ronald Williams himself. The next song on the album \\"The Idiot Bastard Son\\" revisits the story of the Williams brothers in a more sedate style. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1968 songs Category:Frank Zappa songs Category:Songs written by Frank Zappa Category:Patter songs Category:Song recordings produced by Frank Zappa ","title":"Let's Make the Water Turn Black"},{"id":"20442081","text":"The Agulhas long-billed lark (Certhilauda brevirostris), also known as the Agulhas lark or Agulhas longbill is a small passerine bird. It is an endemic resident breeder in the Western Cape, South Africa. Its restricted range is centred on the Agulhas arable farmlands, from east of the Hottentots-Holland mountain range to Mossel Bay, and occupies a maximum of 15,000 km¬≤. ==Taxonomy and systematics== This lark was formerly considered as a subspecies of the Cape long-billed lark, as Certhilauda curvirostris brevirostris until it and three other subspecies were elevated to species status (Sibley and Monroe 1990, 1993). The Handbook of the Birds of the World re-lumped the species in with the Cape long-billed lark in 2017.Ryan, P. (2017). Cape Long-billed Lark (Certhilauda curvirostris).

(retrieved from http://www.hbw.com/node/57630 on 30 March 2017). ==Description== The Agulhas long-billed lark is 18‚Äì20 cm in length. It is long-tailed and has a longish curved bill. It has a streaked buff-grey head and back, and the closed wings are grey. The underparts are cream-coloured with dark streaking on the breast and flanks. Compared to Cape long-billed lark, this species has more buff colour and has a shorter tail and bill. The display song of Agulhas long-billed lark is a disyllabic whistle \`\`seeooo seeeooo\`\`. ==Distribution and habitat== The natural habitat of Agulhas long-billed lark is uncertain, since most of its range has been converted into stony wheatfields and pasture land, only 30% remaining as coastal fynbos or karoo scrub. It is endemic to South Africa. However, it appears to have adapted quite well to its modified habitats, like farmlands, although its distribution is patchy for unknown reasons. ==Behaviour and ecology== At present, very little is known about its ecology and breeding requirements. Like other larks, it nests on the ground. Its food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season. ==References== *Sinclair, Hockey and Tarboton, SASOL Birds of Southern Africa, *Sibley, C. G. and Monroe, B. L.

Published in 1912, it was a sequel to the previous year's The Daring Twins, and the second and final installment in a proposed series of similar books.Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; pp. 186, 189, 280. Phoebe Daring was illustrated by Joseph Pierre Nuyttens, the artist who illustrated Baum's The Flying Girl, Annabel, and The Flying Girl and Her Chum in the same period. Hungry Tiger Press announced that they would reprint the book as Unjustly Accused! in the back of their 2006 reprint of the first book as The Secret of the Lost Fortune. Like The Daring Twins, Phoebe Daring involves two orphaned twins, Philip and Phoebe Daring; as its title indicates, the sister takes the primary role in the second book, which delivers a plot about a good man unjustly suspected of a crime ‚Äì very much as the first one did. This similarity, and lack of originality, might be the best explanation for the book's limited popular success and the termination of the Daring Twins series after two books. It is clear that Baum had hopes of more Daring Twins novels, involving the younger of the five Daring siblings and eventually their children as well.Rogers, p. 280 n. 46. Evidence suggests that he wrote at least a third book in the series; in the papers left after Baum's death in 1919, the file that contained the manuscript for his last Oz book, Glinda of Oz, was labelled Phoebe Daring, Conspirator. Baum's correspondence with his publisher, Reilly & Britton, mentions yet another book, titled either Phil Daring's Experiment or The Daring Twins' Experiment. Yet nothing of these other Daring books is known to have survived. The girl-detective conceptBobbie Ann Mason, The Girl Sleuth, Athens, GA, University of Georgia Press, 1995. had a persistent hold on Baum's imagination. He returned to it in a more successful series, the Mary Louise novels that he began in 1916. ==Plot== Phil Daring, who considered himself the oldest Daring, despite being five minutes younger than Phoebe, is away at college. Phoebe occupies her time learning telegraphy from Dave Hunter, brother of her best friend, Lucy, but once she has mastered it, it loses its novelty, and the town of Riverdale has only three telephones. Judge Ferguson's heart failed in his sleep, and no one is being allowed into his office to claim personal items they had in trust with him. Mrs. Ritchie, who hates banks, has her money and important papers in Ferguson's office, but is told by Constable Sam Parsons that she has to wait and follow procedure before she can claim her property that was in Ferguson's possession. A young lawyer, John Holbrook, has arrived in Riverdale and decides to rent out Ferguson's office. The Darings try to get him to take on Toby Clark as his clerk, as Toby had done for Judge Ferguson, and, having crippled his foot in the events of The Daring Twins, there are not many jobs he can still do. Holbrook spent all the money he had setting up his business, and is not able to hire him at the present time, but when Toby is accused of stealing the box, Holbrook takes the case. A blue tin box with Mrs. Ritchie's name on it is found in the back yard of the Clark shanty by the river, and her papers are found in the back room. This seems to damn Toby, but Phoebe and many of Toby's other friends do not believe he could have committed the act, while his low upbringing creates suspicion in others, such as Tom Rathbun and Dave Hunter. Phoebe interrogates several people and comes up with a list of people who potentially could have stolen Mrs. Ritchie's box--Will Chandler, the postmaster and descendant of Riverdale's earliest family; Mrs. Ritchie herself as a scam; Sam Parsons, who guarded Ferguson's office; John Holbrook, who appeared at the office to rent it before its contents were cleared; Mrs. Miller, a deaf-mute maid; and Joe Griggs, the hardware store owner, who happened to be in place at the right time to make him a suspect. Will and Sam strongly tried to dissuade her from thinking anyone besides Toby may be the thief, but Phoebe is undaunted. Don and Becky Daring, two of the younger Darings, meet in the barn on the Randolph property, being friends with the Randolph children, Allerton (of the infamous \\"naked niggers in Africa\\" quotation of the previous book--the only use of the epithet in either book, despite the Southern setting) and Doris. They decide to form a marching society for the innocence of Toby Clark, and after receiving an anonymous donation, decide to hire Ed Collins's town band to assist them. Phoebe finds that her friend, Nathalie Cameron, as well as John Holbrook, saw a woman leave with the box during the night. Phoebe then visits Sam Parsons, who has the box in his possession, which proves that the pried-open box found on the Clark property is not Mrs. Ritchie's, even though it was the right color and her name was painted on it. Parsons, while well-meaning and certainly seeing himself innocent of police corruption, admits that Toby did not steal the box. He knows who did, but argues that the actual thief will suffer more than Toby Clark will from serving time in prison, thus finding it morally appropriate to plant false evidence on Toby Clark. She insists that she knows Toby but does not know the thief. Sam asserts that Phoebe does know the thief and her relations, just that she doesn't know who they are. This doesn't sit well with Phoebe, nor with Judith Eliot, the Darings' young but of age cousin and guardian, who refuses to take an active part in Phoebe's detective work. Judith's cousin John, who is not cousin to the Darings, is the governor, and dresses down for a familial visit. He becomes very interested in the case, and agrees that Phoebe and Judith's sense of justice is more correct than Sam's. Mrs. Ritchie is upset that one of her papers, in a yellow envelope, is still missing. Eventually, the money and bonds are found under Toby's mattress, which seems to further incriminate him, with a note left admitting that it was a mistake to take the box. Phoebe sees that the notes are not in Toby's handwriting, and seeks to identify whose hand in which they are written. She notes a curl on a T as the most important clue, initially dismissing the spelling \\"mattrass.\\" When she goes to the telegraph station to call for the governor as this latest bit of evidence suggests a frame up, Dave Hunter will not let her, and she fights her way into the booth, telegraphs the message herself, looks in the register for the price, and pays in exact change. As she does so, she finds and pockets a slip of paper after noticing misspelling \\"mattrass\\" related to a shipment. Finally Duncan Spaythe, the town banker, insists that he took the box, in spite of the two witnesses having seen a woman do so. His son, Eric, though, admits that his father took it from the actual thief, Hazel Chandler, who is Will's daughter and Dave's fianc√©e, seeking to expedite their marriage in a moment of weakness. When Cousin John, the governor, learns that the yellow envelope contains the will of Alonzo Clark, Toby's father, he is able to shame Mrs. Ritchie into taking the blame for the theft of her own box, because the will shows that she has stolen dividends from a copper mine Clark had bought and not applied the funds to Toby's upbringing and education as instructed by Alonzo Clark, who was her second cousin. She didn't realize that the will had been probated and existed in file copy at the courthouse. The night before Toby's impending trial, all of those who supported him have a big party in which they reveal to him his true inheritance and that the case against him has been dismissed. Holbrook has developed his reputation and generated some income based on the case, and invites Toby to become his clerk. Toby declines, wishing to attend law school, but expresses interest in being Holbrook's partner once he passes the bar. ==ReferencesCategory:Books by L.

There are two scales, one each in Hindustani music and Carnatic music. The Hindustani rƒÅga is a pentatonic scale, while the Carnatic scale is an Audava - Audava scale - 5 notes in the Arohanam and 5 in the Avarohanam. == Hindustani scale == The Hindustani rƒÅga Shivaranjani belongs to the Kaafi thaat in terms of classification of the scale.Raganidhi by P. Subba Rao, Pub. 1964, The Music Academy of Madras Its structure is as follows. * : * : The komal(soft) gandhar(g) in place of shuddh gandhar (G) is the difference between this rƒÅga and the global musical scale of Bhoop. === Borrowed into Carnatic music === Shivaranjani scale with shadjam at C This Hindustani scale is also the currently popular scale in Carnatic music. This scale is a janya rƒÅgam (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven swaras (musical notes). It is a symmetric rƒÅgam that does not contain madhyamam or nishadam. It is an audava-audava rƒÅgamRagas in Carnatic music by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications in Carnatic music classification (audava meaning 'of 5'). Its ' structure (ascending and descending scale) using swaras in Carnatic music notation is as follows. * : * : (the variant notes used in this scale are chathusruthi rishabham, sadharana gandharam, chathusruthi dhaivatham other than the invariants shadjam and panchamam) In this form, Shivaranjani is considered a janya rƒÅgam of Kharaharapriya, the 22nd Melakarta rƒÅgam, though it can be derived from 3 other melakarta rƒÅgams, Gourimanohari, Hemavati or Dharmavati, by dropping both madhyamam and nishadam. === Popular compositions === Shivaranjani rƒÅgam brings out karuna rasa (pathos) and lends itself for elaboration and exploration. It has many compositions in classical music and in film songs. The popular Hindi film song Jaane kahan gaye woh din (\\"Where have those days gone\\") is based on this scale. Shivaranjani was a favourite of the legendary composers Shankar-Jaikishan (in fact, to be more precise, that of both Shankar and Jaikishan), in addition to the aforementioned song from Mera Naam Joker they also used it for O basanti pavan paagal (\\"O bewitching spring breeze\\") in Jis Desh Men Ganga Behti Hai and O mere sanam (\\"O my love\\") in Sangam Mere nainaa saawan-bhaado.n. Kannum Kannum from the movie Thiruda Thiruda (\\"Thief Thief\\") is regarded as the most different song done in this raga. In Carnatic music, two ragamalikas (songs which have different stanzas in different ragas) start with a refrain in Shivaranjani. M S Subbulakshmi made Kurai onrum illai very popular which begins with this scale. Kurai onrun illai literally means \\"there is no defect\\" or \\"there is nothing left wanting\\", alluding to \\"we are satisfied and thankful\\" in prayer to \\"Kannan\\" (Lord Krishna). Another composition Muiyakka muiyakka, by Purandaradasa, also begins with this scale. Another famous composition in this raaga is 'Jagat janani' rendered in Tamil language. ==Film SongsLanguage:Tamil=== {  !696969\\" Song !696969\\" Movie !696969\\" Composer !696969\\" Singer - Soppana Vaazhvil Sivakavi Papanasam Sivan M.

Often referred to as the Queen of Czechoslovak chanson, she gained popularity primarily as a singer of chanson. Outside of her homebase, Hegerov√° has attained a recognition especially in German-speaking countries. She lives in Prague, Czech Republic. == Biography == Born Carmen M√°ria ≈†tef√°nia Farka≈°ov√°, from 1937 to 1942 Hegerov√° attended ballet school at the National Theater in Bratislava.

The show was hosted by a television actor Karan-Mehra. The 'saases' and 'bahus' will be scored a number out of 10 by the judges, Aruna Irani and Longinus Fernandes (Longie). Each week there was six contestants (three saases and three bahus) who will be competing with each other. The top score the contestants can receive is 30 (20 from the judges and 10 from the audiences). ==Performances== The first day the contestants are to do a solo performance, the second day they are assigned a partner to dance with, and the last day will be when the \\"bahus\\" will dance with their \\"saases\\" but get different scores and the teams will do their triplets. The team who wins the week will be in the quarter finals but they must be valued to be in it. On Mondays the contestants will do their solo performance. Tuesdays the contestants partner comes and does their solo performance. Wednesday the contestants and partner will do their doubles performance. Thursdays are when the saas and bahu dance together but they score separately and they will do their triplets. Fridays they will show the saas and bahu in the drawing room practicing for their big performance! ===Quarter-finals=== In the quarter finals the rules are little different. The contestants will dance to a song by an actor for solos. Then for the round which the contestant and partner dance together, they will dance on a certain genre, salsa or folk or rock and roll. The saas and bahu will do the same time. For the saas vs bahu round, one of them will dance an instrumental if the team thinks they are the best out of the three. The team who wins the week will be in the semifinals but they must be valued for it. ===Semifinals=== In the semifinals the rules are different from quarter-finals and on the regular basis. In the semifinal there are 12 contestants, six saases and six bahus. Only four can go in the Grand Finale from each team. Teammates vote their own teammates out after seeing their performance and scores. The semifinal spend two days for solo performances (about two, three or four a day). But here the rules are different. The contestants do not bring a partner: They just go and dance with their saas or bahus. But it is the impersonation round for them so one of them will dress up as a man and one of them as a woman. As always they will get the scores separately. On Friday, so they show the drawing room for all that has happened. Then the next week the saas and bahu will do their triplets (two a day so it ended on Tuesday). On Tuesday they did the vote out. For the next two days they showed who is in the Grand Finale and some of their performances and on Friday they show the drawing room for the triplets. ==Contestants== { class=\\"Saas border=\\"1\\" - !

McKelvey graduated from Westminster College in Pennsylvania. The Westminster College campus center is named in his honor. After graduating from college, he operated a movie theater and served in the United States Army. After leaving the Army, he headed to Australia in the mid-1950s, where he hoped he could take advantage of the lag in social trends reaching that part of the world. While there, he began a jukebox business that became one of that country's largest.Lohr, Steve. \\"Andrew J. McKelvey, 74, Builder of Monster.com, Dies\\", The New York Times, November 28, 2008.

At another agency, Meltzer, Aron & Lemen, he managed an account of a client that advertised in the Yellow Pages, which triggered the idea of pursuing the opportunity of advertising in telephone directories. In 1967, he founded Telephone Marketing Programs (TMP) as an ad agency focusing on the Yellow Pages ad agency, and built the firm up through a series of acquisitions. The business expanded into help-wanted agencies in the 1990s, which provided his introduction into commerce online. In negotiating to purchase Adion, a help-wanted ad agency run by Jeff Taylor, he learned about the firm's Web site, known as the Monster Board. He purchased Adion in 1995 and eventually bought into the Internet strategy. He further solidified the prominence of Monster.com by acquiring rivals Online Career Center and FlipDog.com.

They are so named because of a distinctive color pattern around their eyes, resembling a mask. The species in this genus were originally placed in the genus Dasyatis by most authors. However, recent morphological and molecular analyses have conclusively showed that they represent a distinct group and so the genus Neotrygon was resurrected for them. Aside from their mask-like color pattern, the maskrays are variable in coloration and can be plain or ornate. Their pectoral fin discs are largely smooth, with a single row of thorns along the dorsal midline. The mouth is small with two central papillae and a row of enlarged, long-cusped teeth halfway along the upper jaw on both sides. The nasal curtain, formed by the merging of the nasal flaps, is long and narrow. The tail is very short with well-developed dorsal and ventral fin folds and a filamentous tip, and is banded black and white past the stinging spine. In addition, Neotrygon species also differ from other stingrays in their buccal and skeletal morphology,Last, P.R., White, W.T. & S√©ret, B.

(Mahogany maskray) * Neotrygon westpapuensis Borsa, Arlyza, Hoareau & Shen, 2017 (West Papuan bluespotted maskray) Neotrygon trigonoides, the type species of the genus Neotrygon, occurs on the reefs and reef-associated habitats of the Coral Sea. The holotype was collected by Castelnau in New Caledonia, hence its vernacular designation as the New Caledonian maskray. Neotrygon kuhlii (Kuhl's maskray) is known from only two specimens collected by French naturalists J.R.C. Quoy and J.P. Gaymard in Vanikoro (Santa Cruz archipelago, southwestern Pacific Ocean) in 1828, and by the watercolour of another specimen drawn by Quoy. As Kuhl's maskray superficially resembles the New Caledonian maskray, it cannot be excluded that the two species are synonymous. To test this hypothesis would require the comparison of maskray specimens from Vanikoro and the Coral Sea using genetic markers. Neotrygon indica apparently has a wide distribution in the Indian Ocean, while several other species have so far been recorded from single locations: the latter category includes Neotrygon kuhlii, so far known from Vanikoro Island only; Neotrygon westpapuensis from Biak Island in West Papua; and Neotrygon vali from Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon archipelago. Neotrygon bobwardi is distributed all along the western coast of Sumatera Island in Indonesia, from Padang to Aceh; Neotrygon malaccensis occurs in the eastern Andaman Sea and in the Malacca Strait; Neotrygon varidens occurs in the South China Sea. Neotrygon orientale has a wide distribution spanning the western Indo-Malay archipelago and the Philippines archipelago; Neotrygon moluccensis has so far been reported from the eastern Banda Sea; Neotrygon caeruleopunctata occurs along the Indian-Ocean shores of Bali and Java Islands; Neotrygon australiae is present all along the northern coast of Australia and around Timor Island. ==References== Category:Dasyatidae ","title":"Maskray"},{"id":"20442476","text":"This is a systematic list of 52 species of nematode (Phylum Nematoda) recorded along the coastal area of Sabah, Malaysia.

He spent his early years in the city of Jericho in the Jordan Valley, where he received his elementary education. He graduated from school (Coptic College) in Jerusalem in 1965, and soon after left to Beirut, Lebanon, where he studied Law and graduated from the Beirut Arab University, with a degree in Law in 1970. During his university years in Beirut, he joined the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, Fatah, and upon his return to Palestine in the early 1970s, became a leading figure among its leadership in the occupied territories. ==Political and Social activism== Nasser helped establish many institutions in the occupied Palestinian territories, upon the directions of the Palestinian leadership in exile, and was an active member of the various committees launched to coordinate between the various Palestinian factions (factions of the PLO). Nasser participated as a leading member of the \\"National Front\\" in the first free elections for the municipal councils of the cities of the West Bank held under Israeli occupation. He was elected as a municipal council member in the city of Jericho in the 1976 elections, and was later elected by the council as vice president. He was the youngest member to be elected for a municipal council in the West Bank at the age of 31. He succeeded the president in 1981 when the latter died, before being deposed by the occupation authorities in 1982 with a military order deposing the elected councils and appointing ones approved by the Israeli occupation authorities. ==The 1980s== In 1982, he was elected as head of the Palestinian Bar ŸêAssociation. The Israeli response was quick, and Nasser's movement was restricted to the city boundaries of Jericho. He was not allowed to leave the city boundaries and was supposed to report to the police station twice a day, for terms extending to six months each. His final release came in 1988, at the beginning of the Palestinian Intifada, of which he soon after assumed a leading role. ==The 1990s and the PNA== In the early 1990s Nasser served as general secretary of the national institutions in the occupied territories (PLO and other national institutions), a position he held until the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, and the resulting founding of the Palestinian National Authority by the PLO. In 1994, he was appointed as the first Director General of the Ministry of Interior in the first government formed by the PNA. A position he held until January 1996, when late President Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian National Authority, appointed him as Governor of Jerusalem, the first governor to be appointed by the PNA and the first governor of Jerusalem since the Israeli occupation in 1967. Governor Nasser served as a governor until September 2008. ==Death== Governor Nasser died on the night of November 22, 2008 due to a cardiac arrest.

From 1919 to 1934 Belgian was owned by the Leyland Line. In 1934, she was sold to Achille Lauro, and renamed Amelia Lauro. On 7 March 1940, Amelia Lauro was damaged by German bombing at en route from Newcastle upon Tyne to Piombino laden with coal. She was set on fire and the crew anchored her, then abandoned her. The SS Titania rescued 37 of the crew, and the sloops Pintail and Londonderry assisted. Amelia Lauro was escorted to Immingham with her superstructure burnt out. One crew member was killed outright and three were wounded. One of the wounded crewmen later died from his injuries. In an expression of gratitude, Lauro Lines owner Achille Lauro donated ¬£26. 5s to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in appreciation of assistance rendered by the Great Yarmouth and Gorleston lifeboat in bringing 29 crew to shore. Permission was given for temporary repairs to be carried out. As a consequence of Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Amelia Lauro was seized as a prize of war. The seizure was ratified by the prize court on 4 May 1941. Amelia Lauro was taken over by the Ministry of War Transport, being renamed Empire Activity. Galbraith, Pembroke & Co were appointed managers. On 3 October 1943, Empire Activity was wrecked on Peckford Reef Newfoundland at , 1 nautical mile south of the Peckford Reef. She was en route from Botwood to the United Kingdom laden with zinc concentrates. ==Official number and code letters== Official Numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers.

He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, rising to the rank of brigadier general before succumbing to wounds he received in combat. ==Early life== Champlin was born in Kingston, New York, a son of Jeffrey Clarke Champlin (1798-1872) and his wife Allis Ellen (1804-1873). He received his initial education at local public schools, and then he attended the academy at Rhinebeck in Dutchess County for a single term. In 1842 Champlin began studying medicine at Harpersfield in Delaware County, and by 1845 a he had a medical practice located at Wawarsing in Ulster County. Champlin decided in 1848 to give up working as a physician, and by 1849 he was studying to become a lawyer. He attended State and National Law School for two terms, and in 1850 he continued his studies with Theodoric R. Westbrook in Kingston. He was admitted to the bar later in 1850, and commenced practice in Albany, New York.Warner, p. 78. On January 1, 1851, Champlin married Mary E. Smedes in Wawarsing. They had one child, a son named Alexander. In 1853 the Champlins moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan. Champlin practiced law in partnership with Lucius Patterson. In 1856 he was elected judge of the Recorder's Court, and served two years. He was active in the Michigan state militia. On April 22, 1856 he was elected captain of the Grand Rapids Light Artillery (\\"Ringgolds\\" Light Artillery). During 1857 he began a new law partnership, this time with Harry Yale. In February 1858 Champlin was elected a major of the militia's Grand River Battalion. That fall he was elected the Prosecuting Attorney for Kent County. ==Civil War service== Champlin during the American Civil War When the American Civil War began in 1861, Champlin chose to follow the Union cause. On June 10 he entered the Union Army as a Major in the 3rd Michigan Infantry.Eicher, p. 170. This regiment was organized at Grand Rapids to serve three years, and left the city on June 13. Camplin was in command of a reconnaissance on August 30 near Bailey's Corners in Virginia. Afterwards he was highly praised for his performance in this minor action by the Union Army of the Potomac's commander, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan.Warner, pp. 78-9. On September 5, McClellan sent the 3rd Michigan an aide with the following message: \\"The general is much pleased with Major Champlin's dispositions on the occasion, which he deems eminently proper, and he desires you to convey his thanks to Major Champlin for the efficient manner in which this service was performed.\\" That fall Champlin was appointed commander of the 3rd Michigan, with the rank of colonel as of October 28. Champlin participated during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, and was wounded in his hip at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31. Subsequently he was granted a 30-day leave to mend.3rd Michigan site biography of Champlin. Injury described as: \\"...received a ball near the hip bone, which must have entered diagonally, and, striking the bone, glanced and passed out, leaving two external wounds, some five inches apart.\\" Champlin was commended for his actions during the battle by divisional commander Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny, shortly before the latter's own death in combat.Warner, p. 79. Partially recovered, Champlin led his regiment during the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 28-30, and was again injured during the battle's last day, re-opening his wound he received in May. During this second leave for recuperation, Champlin was promoted to brigadier general in the Union Army, to rank from November 29, 1862. While resting in Washington, D.C., he wrote to Michigan Governor Austin Blair on January 3, 1863, formally resigning his command of the 3rd due to his promotion. In 1863 Champlin was appointed to command of the Draft Depot at Camp Cleveland, Ohio. However this order was revoked in late August, most likely due to his health condition. Instead, Champlin was assigned to the command of the Draft Depot near his home in Grand Rapids on September 22. Champlin's hip wound still bothered him, and he reportedly resigned his commission in the Union Army on November 8, 1863. Champlin died in early 1864 at his home due to his wounds. His funeral was conducted at St. Mark's Church in Grand Rapids on January 28, and he was buried there in Fulton Street Cemetery. In his honor, Grand Army of the Republic Post #29 in Grand Rapids was named for him. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==NotesReferences== * * * thirdmichigan.blogspot.com 3rd Michigan site biography of Champlin. ==External links== * Category:1827 births Category:1864 deaths Category:People of Michigan in the American Civil War Category:Union Army generals Category:Politicians from Kingston, New York Category:People from Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:People from Wawarsing, New York ","title":"Stephen Gardner Champlin"},{"id":"20442848","text":"Bihari culture refers to the culture of the Indian state of Bihar. Bihari culture includes Mithila culture, Bhojpuri Culture and the culture of Magadha. ==Language and literature== Bhojpuri story written in Kaithi script by Babu Rama Smaran Lal in 1898 Maithili language in Tirhuta and Devanagari scripts Hindi is the official languages of the State. Maithili and Urdu are other recognised languages of the state. Unrecognised languages of the state are Bhojpuri, Angika and Magahi. Bhojpuri and Magahi are sociolinguistically a part of the Hindi Belt languages fold, thus they were not granted official status in the state.The number of speakers of the Bihari languages is difficult to count because of unreliable sources. In the urban region, most educated speakers of the language name Hindi as their language because this is what they use in formal contexts and believe it to be the appropriate response because of unawareness. The uneducated and the rural population of the region regards Hindi as the generic name for their language. Despite of the large number of speakers of Bihari languages, they have not been constitutionally recognised in India, except Maithili which is recognised under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. Hindi is the language used for educational and official matters in Bihar.History of Indian languages , \\"Bihari is actually the name of a group of three related languages‚ÄîBhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi‚Äîspoken mainly in northeastern India in Bihar. These languages was legally absorbed under the subordinate label of Hindi in the 1961 Census. Such state and national politics are creating conditions for language endangerment. The first success for spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced Urdu as the sole official language of the province. In this struggle between competing Hindi and Urdu, the potential claims of the three large mother tongues in the region ‚Äì Bhojpuri, Maithili and Magahi were ignored.

One is Mithila painting, a style of Indian painting used in the Mithila region of Bihar.Traditionally, painting was one of the skills that was passed down from generation to generation in the families of the Mithila region, mainly by women. Painting was usually done on walls during festivals, religious events, and other milestones of the life cycle, like birth, Upanayanam (the sacred thread ceremony), and marriage.Carolyn Brown Heinz, 2006, \\"Documenting the Image in Mithila Art\\", Visual Anthropology Review, Vol. 22, Issue 2, pp. 5-33 Mithila painting was traditionally done on huts' freshly plastered mud walls, but today it is also done on cloth, handmade paper, and canvas. Famous Mithila painters have included Smt Bharti Dayal, Mahasundari Devi, the late Ganga Devi, and Sita Devi. Mithila painting is also called Madhubani art. It mostly depicts human beings and their association with nature. Common scenes illustrate deities like Krishna, Ram, Shiva, Durga, Lakshmi, and Saraswati from ancient epics. Natural objects like the sun, moon, and religious plants like tulsi are also widely painted, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally no space is left empty. Historically, the Patna School of Painting (Patna Qualam), sometimes called Company Painting, flourished in Bihar during the early 18th to mid-20th centuries. The Patna School of Painting was an offshoot of the well-known Mughal Miniature School of Painting. Those who practised this art form were descendants of Hindu artisans of Mughal painting. Facing persecution from the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb, these artisans found refuge, via Murshidabad, in Patna during the late 18th century. Their art shared the characteristics of the Mughal painters, but whereas the Mughal style depicted only royalty and court scenes, the Patna artists also started painting bazaar scenes. They used watercolours on paper and on mica. The style's subject matter evolved to include scenes of Indian daily life, local rulers, festivals, and ceremonies. This school of painting formed the basis for the formation of the Patna Art School under the leadership of Shri Radha Mohan. The School is an important center of fine arts in Bihar. ==Music== Vidyapati Magahi folk singers Bharat Ratna Ustad Bismillah Khan, from Dumraon, Bihar Bihar has contributed a lot to the Indian classical music. Bihar has produced musicians like Bharat Ratna Ustad Bismillah Khan and dhrupad singers like the Malliks (Darbhanga Gharana) and the Mishras (Bettiah Gharana) along with poets like Vidyapati Thakur who contributed to Maithili Music. ==Drama and theatre== In 1984, Satish Anand had evolved a new 'Bidesia Style' for modern Indian theatre. The new style used elements of traditional folk theatre from indigenous Bihari culture. Some other traditional Bihari forms of theatre include those centred around Raja Salhesh, and the festival of Sama Chakeva originating from the Mithila region of Bihar.https://m.hindustantimes.com/patna/mithila-s-submerged-in-sama-chakeva- celebrations/story-yeEeRXFEx5y6nZWkhTqN7K.html ==Sculpture== 6th-century CE bronze statue of Sultanganj Buddha (Birghimham Museum) The first sculptures in Bihar date back to the Mauryan Empire. The Pillars of Ashoka, Masarh lion and Didarganj Yakshi are estimated to be at least 2000 years old, and were carved out of a single piece of stone.Didarganj Yakshi at Patna Museum Ancient statues are found throughout Bihar. Some of these sculptures were made from bronze, an advanced technique at that time. For example, the Sultanganj Buddha statue, estimated to be 1500 years old, is about seven feet tall and made of 500 kg of bronze, making it the largest statue of that period. Many statues, ranging from Hellenistic gods to various Gandharan lay devotees, are combined with what are thought to be early representations of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas. Today, it is still unclear exactly when the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara emerged. However, evidence from Sirkap indicates that this style of art was already highly developed before the advent of the Kushans. Mandar Hill features the unique image of Lord Vishnu, from the Gupta period, in his man-lion incarnation. The image is 34 inches high and made of black stone. == Architecture == Mauryan architecture in the Barabar Mounts. Grottoe of Lomas Richi. 3rd century BCE. The first significant architectural pieces in Bihar date back to the Vedic period. While the Mauryan period marked a transition to the use of brick and stone, wood remained the material of choice. Contemporary writers, like Chanakya in the Arthashastra, advised the use of brick and stone for their durability. However, in his writings, Megasthenes described a wooden palisade encircling the capital city of Pataliputra. Evidence of ancient structures have been found in recent excavations in Kumrahar, in modern-day Patna. Remains of an 80-pillared hall have also been unearthed. The Buddhist stupa, a dome-shaped monument, was used in India as a commemorative monument used to enshrine sacred relics.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). Pagoda. The stupa architecture was adopted in Southeast and East Asia, where it became prominent. Many stupas, like those at Nalanda and Vikramshila, were originally built as brick and masonry mounds during the reign of Ashoka (273 BCE - 232 BCE). Fortified cities with st≈´pas, viharas, and temples were constructed during the Maurya empire (c. 321‚Äì185 BCE). Wooden architecture remained popular, while rock-cut architecture became solidified. Guard rails‚Äîconsisting of posts, crossbars, and a coping‚Äîbecame a safety feature surrounding a stupa. Upon its discovery by Westerners, the stupa became known as pagoda in the West. Temples‚Äîbuild on elliptical, circular, quadrilateral, or apsidal plans‚Äîwere constructed using brick and timber. The Indian gateway arches, the torana, reached East Asia with the spread of Buddhism.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). Torii Some scholars hold that torii derives from the torana gates at the Buddhist historic site of Sanchi (3rd century BCE ‚Äì 11th century CE). Important features of the architecture during this period included walled and moated cities with large gates and multi-storied buildings, which consistently used arched windows and doors. The Indian emperor Ashoka, who ruled from 273 BCE to 232 BCE, established a chain of hospitals throughout the Mauryan empire by 230 BCE.Piercey & Scarborough (2008) One of the edicts of Ashoka reads: \\"Everywhere King Piyadasi (Ashoka) erected two kinds of hospitals, hospitals for people and hospitals for animals. Where there were no healing herbs for people and animals, he ordered that they be bought and planted.\\"Finger, Stanley (2001). Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations into Brain Function. US: Oxford University Press. 12. . Buddhist architecture blended with Roman and Hellenestic architecture to give rise to unique new styles, such as the Greco-Buddhist style.Moffett, M.; Fazio, M.; and Lawrence Wodehouse (2003). A World History of Architecture. McGraw-Hill Professional. 75. . Rock-cut stepwells in India date from 200‚Äì400 CE. Subsequently, the wells at Dhank (550‚Äì625 CE) and the stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850‚Äì950 CE) were constructed.Livingston & Beach, page xxiii Bihar was largely in ruins when visited by Xuanzang, and suffered further damage at the hands of Mughal raiders in the 12th century. Though parts of the Bihar have been excavated, much of its ancient architecture still lies buried beneath the modern city. Persian influence can be seen in surviving Mughal tombs made of sandstone and marble.Mughal architecture. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008) Surviving Mughal architecture includes Sher Shah Suri Tomb, built by Sher Shah Suri and his successor. Ibrahim Khan, Governor of Bihar and a disciple of Makhdum Daulat, oversaw the completion of Makhdum Daulat mausoleum in 1616. Another example of Mughal architecture is the building at Maner Sharif. The domed building features walls adorned with intricate designs and a ceiling full of inscriptions from the Quran. Patna High Court, Bihar Vidhan Sabha, Bihar Vidhan Parishad, Transport Bhawan, Patna, Golghar St. Mary's Church and Patna Museum are some example of Indo-Saracenic Architectures. Strips or cane reeds painted in vivid colours are commonly found in Bihari homes. A special container called a \\"pauti,\\" woven out of Sikki Grass Craft in the north, is a sentimental gift that accompanies a bride when she leaves her home after her wedding. Bihar is well known for the games played there, for example - kabaddi. Bhagalpur is well known for its sericulture, manufacture of silk yarn, and silk-weaving. Silk produced here is called tussah or tussar silk. Appliqu√© works in Bihar are known as Khatwa. ==Religion== Hindus bathing in the hotsprings at Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, Rajgir. In ancient times, hot springs used to be the site of the Tapodarama, a Buddhist monastery at the time of Gautama Buddha. It is said that King Bimbisara also used to bathe here sometimes. Mahavir, as Guru folio from a manuscript In Bihar, every aspect of life is suffused with religious significance and its manifestations abound in every corner of the state. Shrines and Homas ground are numerous, and religious symbols or images of deities abound. Many Biharis keep Altars, Havan rituals, Homa practices, religious symbols, statues, and the like in their homes, and offices. A typical Bihari household begins each day with religious devotion to the Sun god as surya Namaskar for the well being of the people. Most religious festivals in the region stem from the Vedic rituals which are performed by the vedic people as it preserves some of the oldest vedic rituals such as worship of sun god surya, Lunar moon god, worship of Nature, Homa rituals, Havans worshiping Rain god for Rains etc. or some of the festival stem from the Hinduism, given that it is the state's predominant religion. There are many variations on the festival theme. While some are celebrated all over the state, others are observed only in certain areas. In one region or another, festivals take place round the year. Many festival days are officially proclaimed as government holidays. ==FestivalsChhath Mahaparv=== Chhath Puja Chhath, also called \\"Dala Chhath\\", Surya vrat, is an ancient and major Vedic festival celebrated in Bihar. It is celebrated twice a year: once in the summers, called the Chaiti Chhath, and once around a week after Deepawali, called the Karthik Chhath. The Karthik Chhath is more popular because winters are the usual festive season in northern India, and fasting without water for around 42 hours or more, as required for worshipers during Chhath Puja, is easier to do in the Indian winters. Chhath is the worship of the sun god. Wherever people from Bihar have migrated, they have taken with them the tradition of Chhath. It is a ritual bathing festival that follows a period of abstinence and a ritual segregation of the worshiper from their main household for four days. On the eve of Chhath, houses and their surroundings are scrupulously cleaned. Then the ritual bathing and worship of the Sun God takes place, performed twice: once in the evening and once at dawn, usually on the banks of a flowing river, or a common large water body. The main god worshiped is Aditya the sun god with his wife Ushas the evening dusk goddess and Kiran the dawn goddess and Aditi the mother of Gods, the occasion generally resembles a carnival. For several days, ritual renditions of regional folk songs are sung. These folk songs have been carried on through oral transmission from mothers and mothers-in-law to daughters and daughters- in-law for generations. It is one of the oldest festival continuously celebrated since the time of vedic period. It is believed that it generally follows the Vedic worship of sungod which is preserved in these region till now and it is celebrated at huge expanse. ===Durga Puja=== Durga Puja After Chhath puja, Durga puja is the second major festival of Bihar. Here, it is celebrated for ten days. People perform fasts during festival and married women perform 'saanjh' which means sandhya aarti and \\"khoecha\\" is given to goddess by women because it is a tradition in Bihar that when a daughter comes to her father's house 'khoecha' is given to her by her mother and it is believed that goddess Durga comes to her maayka from her sasural every year. Whole cities and villages are decorated with beautiful lights and beautiful pandals are created for this grand festival. Here people performs puja for ten days and strictly performs the fast and during these ten days pure vegetarian dishes are cooked in households. These dishes do not contain onion and garlic. During this festival people perform kanya pujan on the auspicious day of Ashtami and Navami. In Dashami the 'Visarjan puja' is performed in which 'jayanti from 'Kalash' is distributed to devotees and 'Aprajita pujan' is performed in which Goddess is worshiped with from the vines of a flower named 'Aprajita' after this 'Dahi chura' is offered to Goddess Durga after which she returns to her Husband's home 'Sasural'.The idols of goddess Durga are immersed on Dashmi or Day after Dashmi. The visarjan of 'Bari Devi ji' and 'Choti Devi ji'in Patna and visarjan of 'Bari Durga Maharani ji ' Choti Durga ji, Bari Kali ji, and Choti Kali ji in Munger and Jamalpur holds a grand procession. ===Shravani Mela=== Shravani Mela is an important month-long ritual observance, held along a 108-kilometre route linking the towns of Sultanganj and Deoghar (now located in the state of Jharkhand.) It is held every year in the Hindu month of Shravan (the lunar month of July‚ÄìAugust). Pilgrims, known as Kanwarias, wear saffron-coloured clothes and collect water from a sacred Ghat (river bank) at Sultanganj. They walk the 108 km stretch barefoot to the town of Deoghar to bathe a sacred Shiva-Linga. The observance draws thousands of people from all over India to the town of Deoghar. ===Saraswati Puja=== Saraswati Puja It is the one of the major festivals in Bihar which is performed by students and also in many households. Students start preparations for this festival around one month early. It is mainly performed in school and colleges. Now-a-days, Saraswati puja is also performed in households and localities. In this festival, students offer their books and study materials as well as musical instruments in front of goddess saraswati who is believed to be the goddess of knowledge and wisdom. ===Pitri Paksha Mela=== This is a 15-day fair held on the bank of River Falgu at Gaya during Pitru Paksha every year. Pilgrims from all parts of India visit Gaya, offering pinda to honour their ancestors. According to estimates from the Bihar Tourism Department, about 500,000 to 750,000 pilgrims arrive in Gaya each year during the Pitri Paksha Mela. ===Other festivals=== Other local festivals celebrated with fervor in Bihar include: * Teej and Chitragupta Puja * Bihula-Bishari Puja (celebrated in the Anga region of Bihar) * The Sonepur cattle fair, a month-long event starting approximately half a month after Deepawali. Considered the largest cattle fair in Asia, it is held at the junction of the Ganges and Gandak Rivers, in the town of Sonepur. However, new laws governing the sale of animals and prohibiting the trafficking in exotic birds and beasts have adversely impacted the fair's success. *Sama Chakeva All major festivals and celebrated in India are also celebrated in Bihar. These include holidays celebrated by Indians of various religions. Among them are: * Islam: Eid-ul- Fitr; Eid-ul-Adha (often called Eid-ul-Zuha in the Indian Subcontinent); and Muharram * Christianity: Christmas * Buddhism: Buddha Purnima * Hinduism: Diwali; Saraswati Puja; Holi ==MediaPrint media=== Popular Hindi newspapers in Bihar include the Hindustan Times, Dainik Jagran, Navbharat Times, Aj The Hindu and Prabhat Khabar. E-papers, such as the Bihar Times and Patna Daily, have become very popular among educated Biharis, especially those living outside the region. National English dailies like The Times of India and The Economic Times and Bihar Now are read in urban regions. ===Television and radio=== Several national and international television channels are popular in Bihar. DD Bihar, Sahara Bihar, and ETV Bihar-Jharkhand are the channels dedicated specifically to Bihar. In 2008, two dedicated Bhojpuri channels, called Mahuaa TV,Bhojpuri Channel Mahuaa TV Launched and Purva TV were launched. Several government radio channels exist in Bihar. All India Radio has stations in Bhagalpur, Daltonganj, Darbhanga, Patna, Purnea, and Sasaram. Other government radio channels include Gyan Vani in Patna; Radio Mirchi, also in Patna; and Radio Dhamaal in Muzaffarpur. Online Media Nowadays online media portals are becoming very popular among Bihari youth. There are portals in Bihar but most popular is Aapna Bihar. It very popular among the Bihari migrants across the world. It mainly post the positive stuffs about Bihar. ===Cinema=== Bihar has a robust Bhojpuri-language cinema industry. There are also a small Maithili-, Angika- and Magadhi-language film industries in the region. The earliest Bihari films were released in the 1960s. The first Bhojpuri film was Ganga Jamuna, released in 1961. Ganga Jamuna ‚Äì First Bhojpuri language film The same year also saw the release of the first Magadhi-language film, called Bhaiyaa.https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0236021/ Bhaiyaa ‚Äì First Magadhi language film In 1962, a well-received Bhojpuri film, Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo (\\"Mother Ganges, I will offer you a yellow sari\\"), was released, directed by Kundan Kumar. Three years later, the first movie filmed in significant portions in the Maithili language, Kanyadan, was released.https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0236358/ Kanyadan ‚Äì First Maithili language film Over the next two decades, films were produced sporadically. In general, Bhojpuri films were not commonly made in the 1960s and 1970s. By the 1980s, though, enough Bhojpuri films had been made to comprise a small industry. Films such as Mai (\\"Mom,\\" 1989, directed by Rajkumar Sharma) and Hamar Bhauji (\\"My Brother's Wife,\\" 1983, directed by Kalpataru) continued to have at least sporadic success at the box office. However, this trend faded out by the end of the decade, and by 1990, the Bihari film industry seemed to be defunct.Tripathy, Ratnakar (2007) 'BHOJPURI CINEMA', South Asian Popular Culture, 5:2, 145 ‚Äì 165 Yet the industry took off again in 2001 with the extremely popular Saiyyan Hamar (\\"My Sweetheart,\\" directed by Mohan Prasad). This success was quickly followed by several other very popular films, including Panditji Batai Na Biyah Kab Hoi (\\"Priest, tell me when I will marry,\\" 2005, directed by Mohan Prasad) and Sasura Bada Paisa Wala (\\"My father-in-law, the rich guy,\\" 2005). In a measure of the Bhojpuri film industry's rising status, both of these films did much better business in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar than mainstream Bollywood hits did. Additionally, both films, made on extremely small budgets, earned back more than ten times their production costs. The success, status, and visibility of Bhojpuri cinema has continued to increase. The industry now supports an awards show and a trade magazine, Bhojpuri City, and now produces over one hundred films per year. Many of the major stars of mainstream Bollywood cinema, including Amitabh Bachchan, have recently worked in Bhojpuri films. ==References and footnotesFurther reading== * Pathak Prabhu Nath, Society and Culture in Early Bihar (C.A.D. 200 ‚Äì 600), Commonwealth Publishers, 1988 * Basham A.

Surantih is one of 11 major nagari‚Äîout of 37‚Äîin Pesisir Selatan. The other 10 major nagaris are Tarusan, Pasarbaru, Salido, Painan, Pasar Kuok (or Batang Kapas), Kambang, Balai Selasa, Air Haji, Indrapura, and Tapan‚Äîin that order from north to south, where Surantih is situated between Batang Kapas and Kambang. ==Location and access == Surantih is located 116 km to the south of Padang, the capital city of the province. It is geographically closer to Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, than to Jakarta (the capital city of Indonesia). It stretches along Batang Surantih (Surantih River) from the Indian ocean 30 km inland to the Bukit Barisan region where it borders another nagari from a different district, Solok. There is only one land transportation access to Surantih, the district main road connecting Padang with all major Nagari in the Pesisir Selatan district and continues to Bengkulu and Jambi province. It takes about 3 hours by bus/car from Padang to Surantih, and about 4‚Äì5 hours further to the south to the Bengkulu or Jambi province borders. Pasar Surantih (lit. Surantih's market) is the main village where commercial amenities and social facilities are located, such as shops, small restaurants, wet market, and schools. Pasar Surantih is a typical small town in Indonesia with around 2,000 population. The entire Surantih population is about 25,000-30,000, the latest population survey from Dept. PU in 2003 showed a 25,412 population (12,898 female, 12,524 male). This population is spread across an area of approximately 300 km2 and is thus almost half Singapore's size, with a few small villages which were not accessible by modern transportation means until a couple of years ago. Langgai is the most remote village in Nagari Surantih, situated in the Bukit Barisan with a different climate from the lowland and coastal part of Surantih. A road has been built to this village, but the condition is poor; it takes 3‚Äì4 hours to cover a distance of 30 km to reach Langgai from Pasar Surantih. ==People and language == The population is virtually 100% Moslem with occasionally a few non-Moslems from other provinces residing in the area temporarily, normally civil servants. While Moslems in this area are generally not as devout as others from other parts of West Sumatra, it is important to not to do anything that is against Islam and traditional local values. Consuming pork or alcohol is offensive to locals, unless one consumes it secretly at their own house. Locals speak ‚ÄúPasisie‚Äù (Indonesian/Malay: \\"Pesisir\\"; English: \\"Coast\\") accent of Minangkabau language/Padangnese. The Minangkabau language is related to standard Malay spoken in Indonesia and Malaysia. But it is different in a sense that both native speakers will barely understand each other if they converse in normal way. But, it might be relatively easy for a Malay speaker to learn the Minangkabau language and vice versa. Almost all people speak and understand the standard accent of Indonesian or Malay, but many of the older generation especially those live in inland do not speak Indonesian at all. Young children, especially those who have not yet attended a school, might not speak Indonesian as well. English is very rarely spoken here. However, some high school students or one or two people may understand very basic English. English is taught in high school, but the standard is relatively poor. Like most of the West Sumatrans/Minangkabau people, the people of Surantih traditionally leave their home and move elsewhere in the nation for a better life. For the younger generation, leaving home is a must if they want to continue studying at university level (or senior high school until very recently). People from Surantih could be found in many big towns and cities across the island of Sumatra, and in major cities in Java island. Generally, West Sumatrans/Minangkabau people considered Pesisir Selatan district a backward area, due to a lag in economic development, education level, and other measures. Some of them also consider people from Pesisir Selatan district to be less acculturated and less devout in practicing Islam. This perception has reduced somewhat in recent years with economic development, and in particular improved population mobility as well as improving communication and information exchanges. However, the education standard here remains among the lowest in the province. == Amenities and social infrastructure == The commercial center of this Surantih, Pasar Surantih, is situated about 1 km from the coastline, and it was about 30 km from the most remote village, namely Langgai, in Bukit Barisan region. It actually lies along/parallel to the coastline. With the economic progression, and helped by government spending, some modern facilities have been built in Surantih. It had access to electricity in the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, the residents for the first time received television broadcasts. Telecommunication service, a fixed line phone infrastructure, was extended to this small town in early 2000. With rapidly expanding cellular communication investment and technology, one now could enjoy some coverage of cellular phone service. Education facilities have also improved. Since the establishment of the first junior high school in late 70s/early 80s, the government has built another junior school in the inland area. A senior high school was also built in early 2000 which allows locals to finish the first 12 years of basic education without leaving their village for the district's capital. There is one health clinic with one doctor/general practitioner and several nurses. There are 10-15 mosques and surau (small mosque/chapel) across the Surantih. The two biggest ones are in Pasar Surantih. A football field which hosts other sports and social activities, such as concerts or movies, is situated 200m-300m from Pasar Surantih market. Two or three small restaurants can be found in Pasar Surantih that serve Padang cuisine. Small stalls selling food or traditional cakes can be found in or around the wet market. Two local ‚Äúcaf√©s‚Äù are other places to get traditional cakes (e.g. onde-onde, lapek bugih, lemang, etc.), drinks (coconut drink is a must here). These local cafes/warungs are open till midnight, located in the main street, just the opposite of the wet market. There is no hotel or hostel, but there is a local shop owner who allows people to stay at the second storey of his house for two thousand Rupiah (e.g. US$1 or 2). Visitors with no relatives or acquaintances normally sleep in or near the mosque, although non-Moslems are not allowed to enter the mosque. == Economy == This small town is known for its traditional fishing industry. It also has a long beach which serves a tourist destination for people within the Nagari. The main river, Batang Surantih (Surantih river), originates in the Bukit Barisan region and ends in the Indian ocean‚Äîthe mouth of the river is situated approximately 1 km from Pasar Surantih. Surantih is largely arable land, and so most of the population rely on agriculture, in addition to fishing. Surantih is typical of small towns in Indonesia in terms of economic development. To put local income in perspective, the residents' annual per capita income than the national average, about US$2,000, for 3 reasons. First, rural income is lower than urban. Secondly, West Sumatra Province GDP per capita is lower than national average. Lastly, Pesisr Selatan District GDP per capita is lower than the Province average. According to official data from the Pesisir Selatan district website, about 39.7% of the district population is considered below the official poverty line. Surantih, by and large, resembles the average of the district's physical appearance, it is quite fair to assume that a similar proportion of local population live below the national poverty line. However, it is said that most of the local officials tend to mark up the number of poor families in order to get special subsidy from central government.

It is a not-for- profit, member-based association, with over 650 member companies; related services are delivered by a trading company, BSRIA Limited. Any profits made are invested in its research programme, producing best practice guidance. BSRIA is a full member of the Construction Industry Council. ==Structure== BSRIA had a turnover of ¬£11.8 million in 2010/11. It employs over 180 people at its UK head office in Bracknell as well as regionally based engineers in the UK and offices in France, Spain, Germany, China, Japan, Brazil and North America. BSRIA's mission is > \\"to enable the building services and construction industries and their > clients to enhance the value of the built environment, by improving the > quality of their products and services, the efficiency of their provision > and the effectiveness of their operation.\\" == History of BSRIA == BSRIA was formed in 1955 as the Heating and Ventilating Research Council, later to become the Heating and Ventilating Research Association. As the industry became increasingly linked with other services so its research association and professional body saw the need to widen their remit. In 1975 the 'building services' scope was adopted, marked by the formation of the Building Services Research and Information Association, commonly shortened to BSRIA, and, in 1976, the formation of the Chartered Institution of Building Services, renamed the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) in 1985. As the Association's activities developed to meet the needs of an integrated construction industry and to provide more than just research and information, the full name became less relevant. When new government rules required it to split research and other activities into two companies, BSRIA started formal use of the abbreviation. Trading activities, including research, are now managed through a trading company, BSRIA Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Building Services Research and Information Association, which is a company limited by guarantee. Thus, members - largely companies active in designing and delivering building services - join the Building Services Research and Information Association, and services are provided by BSRIA Limited. ==Timeline history== * 1955 (29 Dec) - The inaugural General Meeting of the Heating and Ventilating Research Council held at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The trio was set to release their debut album with executive producer T-Pain before disbanding in 2011. ==Music career== The group was originally called Gyrlfriend and consisted of members Chelle, Skye, Cole Rose and Jade Johnson. The group signed their first major deal with J Records in 2005; however, the group eventually disbanded. Skye and Cole Rose then joined with Crystal to form Sophia Fresh. The girls decided on the name Sophia Fresh because it was \\"a reflection of three southern girls in one, united by hip hop\\". In 2008, the group's manager took them to Atlantic Records and introduced them to singer/producer T-Pain. According to Cole Rose, \\"they took us to T-Pain, he loved us and the rest is history\\". T-Pain signed the trio as one of the first acts to his Atlantic imprint, Nappy Boy Entertainment. The group began recording their debut album with T-Pain, and were allowed the creative freedom to record their \\"very high energy, very edgy and funky\\" music. The group said that with J Records, \\"they had us in like a safe lane\\", but when recording with T-Pain, \\"we're free to be Sophia Fresh. We're free to do whatever - express ourselves. That's T-Pain. He talks about what he feels and that's what we're gonna do.\\" Sophia Fresh have confirmed that T-Pain will be \\"heavily involved\\" in the production of their album\\". For the album, the trio promised, \\"energy, expect fun, and expect the real because that's what we're talking about - just real situations. Expect to laugh, expect to cry... expect everything. We're three different girls with three different personalities and we're all showcase.\\" T-Pain described Sophia Fresh as \\"a contemporary TLC\\".

I almost wish the song was mine. It's really, really incredible. There's no genre for it. The melody is very pop, but the beat is really gutter. It's a heavy hip-hop beat.\\" Another Sophia Fresh track, \\"This Instant\\" featuring T-Pain, was selected to appear on the Step Up 3D soundtrack. The group made various cameos in T-Pain videos, mostly from the 2008 Three Ringz album, including \\"Can't Believe It\\" and \\"Chopped 'n' Screwed.\\" They trio can also be seen briefly in DJ Khaled's 2010 video for \\"All I Do Is Win\\" alongside rappers Ludacris and Snoop Dogg.

She was previously the President of Global Communications Strategy & Talent at A&E; Networks and the Chief Operating Officer of Vice Media. She is also a contributing editor at Marie Claire magazine. She previously served as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations in the administration of President Barack Obama from 2011 to 2014. She was the youngest woman to hold that position. In 2005, Mastromonaco was hired as then Senator Obama's Director of Scheduling. She is also a New York Times best selling author and co-host of the Crooked Media podcast, Hysteria. == Early life and education == Mastromonaco grew up in Rhinebeck, New York. Her father was a business consultant and her mother was a high school lunch aide. In 1994, she graduated from Rhinebeck High School. During high school Mastromonaco worked in various jobs, including her first job as a checkout person at a grocery store called Kilmer's IGA. Mastromonaco went to the University of Vermont for two years, majoring in French with a minor in Japanese. She then transferred to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1998. == Career == The summer after her sophomore year of college, after seeing then- Congressman Bernie Sanders speak on campus, Mastromonaco was hired by Philip Fiermonte to work as an intern for Sanders in his Burlington, Vermont district office. At that time, Sanders was campaigning for his fourth term in the United States House of Representatives. Mastromonaco has said that the experience inspired her to work in government after seeing how it was possible to help people doing constituent work on a grassroots level. Although she had transferred to Wisconsin to study French, the summer working for Sanders shifted her passion from studying French and Japanese to studying political science. She cites Fiermonte as a great mentor during an important time in her life. The next summer, Mastromonaco was invited to work for Sanders in Washington, D.C. After college Mastromonaco wanted to continue working in government but couldn't find a job, so she worked as a real-estate investment- trust paralegal, which she said was instrumental in teaching her how to work well as part of a team. The job was in the World Trade Center. In 2000, Mastromonaco moved to Boston and got her first job in politics as a staff assistant to Senator John Kerry. For a short time, after 9/11, she worked at a Republican lobbyist group, Richard Berman's American Beverage Institute, as director of membership. In 2002, Mastromonaco was hired as Press Secretary for Congressman Rick Boucher of Virginia, but in December 2002 went back to work for Kerry. In 2004, Mastromonaco was hired as the Director of Scheduling for Senator Kerry's presidential campaign. === Obama Administration === Starting in February 2004, Mastromonaco joined the then Illinois State Senator Barack Obama's campaign during his run for United States Senate. She was hired as Director of Scheduling. The team who made up that office included Jon Favreau, Tommy Vietor, Robert Gibbs, and Pete Rouse. From 2007 to 2008, Mastromonaco was Political Director for Obama's Political Action Committee (PAC), Hopefund, during the 2006 midterm elections. The mission of the PAC was to teach young people who had no experience in the political process how to be field and community organizers. Following Obama's announcement in February 2007, Mastromonaco served as Director of Scheduling and Advance for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. In November 2008, Mastromonaco was appointed Director of Scheduling and Advance in the administration of President Barack Obama. In January 2011, she was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. In November 2011, The New Republic magazine listed Mastromonaco on its \\"2011 List Issue\\" as being one of Washington's most powerful, least famous people. Along with Nancy-Ann DeParle, who was White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, it was the first time a presidential administration had two women deputies in power. She was notable for her long institutional memory, the ability to understand logistics, and her low-key approach to the position. In May 2014, Mastromonaco left her position as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. She was replaced by Anita Decker Breckenridge. === Post-White House === In June 2014, Mastromonaco was hired as a contributing editor at Marie Claire. In January 2015, Mastromonaco joined Vice Media as Chief Operating Officer. Mastromonaco's first book, Who Thought This Was a Good Idea?

Its headquarters are in Monte-Carlo, Monaco and it has 115 national federation members. Modern pentathlon was introduced at the 5th Olympiad in Stockholm (SWE) in 1912, comprising the contemporary sports of pistol shooting, fencing, swimming, horse riding and running, which embraced the spirit of its ancient counterpart. UIPM also governs the multi-disciplinary sports Laser Run, Tetrathlon, Biathle, Triathle and World Schools Biathlon, which have been created as development sports aimed at growing global participation rates in UIPM sports and offering more athletes an entry point to modern pentathlon. UIPM is a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Global Organisation of International Sport Federations (GAISF) and the Federation of International University Sport (FISU), and since joining the International Paralympic Committee it has operated a para-sports programme. ==HistoryThe Greek Olympic Games Pentathlon=== The Pentathlon (consisting of running the length of the stadium, jumping, throwing the spear, throwing the discus and wrestling) was introduced for the first time at the 18th Olympiad in 708 BC and held a position of unique importance in the Games. It was considered to be the climax, with the winner ranked as \\"Victor Ludorum\\". Admiration for the Ancient Pentathlon was fully shared by the founder of the Modern Olympics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin and from 1909 he tried to have the event re- introduced into the Olympic programme. Pentathlon's moment came two years later at the 14th session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Budapest (HUN) when, as the Baron stated: \\"the Holy Ghost of sport illuminated my colleagues and they accepted a competition to which I attach great importance\\". ===The Modern Pentathlon=== Modern Pentathlon was introduced at the 5th Olympiad in Stockholm (SWE) 1912, comprising the contemporary sports of pistol shooting, fencing, swimming, horse riding and running, which embraced the spirit of its ancient counterpart. It was De Coubertin's belief that it would be this event, above all others, that \\"tested a man's moral qualities as much as his physical resources and skills, producing thereby the ideal, complete athlete.\\" This new sport was enthusiastically adopted with its inherent demands of courage, co-ordination, physical fitness, self-discipline and flexibility in ever changing circumstances. A young American Lieutenant, later to be the famous World War II General, George S. Patton, was to finish fifth in the first Olympic Modern Pentathlon competition. The mixture of physical and mental skills demanded in the Pentathlon has also meant that athletes have been able to compete in as many as three or four Olympic Games. This is because while running and swimming times can be expected to decline with age, experience and skill in the technical disciplines often increase. ===Administration of Modern Pentathlon=== Modern Pentathlon was administered directly by the IOC until 1948, when the International Modern Pentathlon Union (UIPM) was founded by a group who elected Tor Wibom as the first UIPM President. Gustaf Dyrssen (1920 Olympic champion) from Sweden took over in 1949 with Sven Thofelt serving as Secretary General. Thofelt succeeded Dyrssen in 1960 and served as President for 28 years (IOC Member 1970‚Äì1976). In 1960, Biathlon (cross country skiing and rifle shooting) was introduced to the Olympic programme. Biathlon had joined the Union in 1953, and the organization thereafter became the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon (UIPMB). In 1993, an agreement was made to retain as an umbrella body under which the UIPM and the International Biathlon Union (IBU) could act autonomously. The UIPMB however, continued to be the only international multi- sport organisation recognised by the IOC. Until 1998, the President of Modern Pentathlon acted as President of the Union during the two years prior to the Summer Olympic Games, and the President of the Biathlon acted as such for two years prior to each of the Winter Games. Having matured into an organisation capable of continuing on its own, the IBU decided on 26 June 1998, to exist autonomously. The separation from the UIPMB took effect on 20 August 1998, creating two distinct International Federations ‚Äì the UIPM and IBU, both of which are recognised by the IOC and GAISF. ==Sports developmentBiathle=== Designed as a 'Sport for All', Biathle has been practised for over 50 years. Through Biathle the UIPM has established a competition composed of the two fundamental components of Modern Pentathlon and most practised sports in the world ‚Äì run and swim. The Biathle has universal appeal. It is inexpensive to organise, simple to understand, can be viewed from a single location, and organised practically anywhere in the world at any time of the year. The Biathle competition begins with a pack start of runners who complete one-half of the total running distance before entering a 50-meter transition area. Athletes then dive into the water and swim the required distance before exiting the water, putting on their shoes and running the second leg. The first person to cross the finish line wins. The race distances vary with the age groups concerned. The first Biathle World Championships took place in Monaco in 1999 and the Biathle World Tour started in 2002 to include up to six competitions in various locations throughout the year. Medals are awarded to the top three athletes in each age group in both the World Championships and the World Tour. === World Schools Biathlon=== In 2005 UIPM launched a new competition linked to the success of Biathle. The event consists of swimming and running. The swimming discipline is conducted in a 25m or 50m pool and the running discipline is conducted preferably on a standardised track (although it can also be carried out on a flat surface if extra care is taken so that the distances are correct). Swimming is conducted first and running is by mass start. The final result is the sum of the swimming and running points. The originality of the World Schools Biathlon is that schools take part in this international competition by entering their results in a global database using the UIPM website (www.pentathlon.org) directly from their location. Therefore, this competition does not require any funding for transportation or lodging. All can be made 'at home' by the registered physical education teacher or coach. ===Triathle=== Triathle was officially approved by UIPM in November 2012 as a development sport and, in combination with Biathle, it is an integral part of UIPM sports development. Through Triathle, the UIPM has established a platform to encourage new generations to practise modern pentathlon starting from the basic disciplines of running and swimming and progressing into laser shooting. Triathle is also very easy to organise and the beach triathle, as performed at the inaugural 2013 World Triathle Championships in Cyprus, has showcased how athletes of all ages can perform in a competition that is delivered with low-cost equipment at no extra cost for the participants. Triathle normally begins with a pack start of runners for the first 25m, followed by the first series of five shots with the laser pistol. After the next running leg the athletes approach the transition area and swim before finishing with a final running leg. As usual, the first person crossing the finish line will be declared the winner. The race distances vary with the age groups concerned. Triathle has featured on the Modern Triathle World Tour, the Asian Youth and Asian Beach Games. ==The five eventsFencing=== Fencing is a series of one-touch bouts with √©p√©e swords. The fencing event of modern pentathlon is a round-robin tournament, with a single touch deciding each match. The fencing event is held usually in an indoor arena on special strips (pistes) measuring 14m long and between 1.5m and 2m wide. Each competitor has a bout against every other competitor. Bouts last for one minute, the winner being the first fencer to score a hit. If neither scores a hit, both competitors register a defeat, a double hit, doesn't count. Point penalties are awarded for a variety of infringements including hitting the √©p√©e on anything other than the opponent to register to a hit, crossing the boundary line with both feet or to avoid a hit, dangerous play and when a fencer turns their back on the opponent. Seventy percent of bouts won correspond to 1000 pentathlon points. Each win is called a victory and each loss a defeat. Each victory over or under the 70% mark is worth a specific point value and this number is in accordance with the number of competitors: * 22‚Äì23 bouts gives +/- 40 points * 24‚Äì26 bouts gives +/- 36 points * 27‚Äì29 bouts gives +/- 32 points * 30‚Äì33 bouts gives +/- 28 points * 34‚Äì39 bouts gives +/- 24 points Example: 36 competitions (the number of athletes in a final) means 35 bouts, 70% of 35 bouts = 25 victories = 1000 points, 23 victories are therefore worth 952 Pentathlon points. ===Swimming=== Pentathletes usually have a swimming background, which is considered to be the only pentathlon discipline that cannot be taught at a higher level at an older age. For this reason, good swimming standards are considered to be a \\"precondition\\" for participation in Modern Pentathlon. The swimming event is a freestyle race over 200m for men and women with athletes seeded in heats according to their personal best time. A time of 2:30 earns 1000 Pentathlon points. Every 0.33 seconds is worth +/- 4 points and thus the value of each swimming second is worth 12 points. Example: the time 2:32.66 minutes corresponds to 968 points. Forty point penalties are incurred for a false start, failing to touch the wall at the end of a lap or leaving the pool in an incorrect manner as stipulated in the rules. ===Riding=== The riding event (equestrian show jumping) included in the Modern Pentathlon competition involves jumping over obstacles of up to 120 cm in height. The obstacle course is between 350-450m in length and includes 12 obstacles with one double and one triple, for 15 jumps. Athletes compete on horses provided by the organisers, which are selected from a random draw. For warm-up and preparation purposes, athletes are allowed to ride their allocated horse for 20 minutes and to have up to 5 trial jumps in the warm-up arena provided. Pentathletes are given 20 minutes to inspect the course at any time during the competition programme according to the organiser's schedule. The athlete has a specific time limit in which to complete the course, and the time limit is set according to its length. A clear round in time allowed (varies between 1 minute and 1.17 minutes) gives the rider 1200 pentathlon points. For each mistake the rider loses points. Examples of penalties given are 20 points for knock-down and 40 points for every refusal or disobedience: but any disobedience leading to the knocking down of an obstacle gives 60 points deduction. After 2 refusals to jump, the rider must try to jump the next obstacle. A fall of the rider from the horse or if they both fall is a 60-point penalty. After 2 falls the riding will be terminated. In case of riding terminations for every obstacle not jumped, the rider loses 100 points. The most common cases of riding terminations are: Wrong course, second fall, exceeding the time limit that is double of the time allowed and retiring from the competition. Each second over the time limit means a deduction of 4 points. The maximum time is the double of the standard time. If the rider is slower than the time allowed, the riding is terminated Riders must jump the obstacles in order. Riders must wear protective head-gear and a riding jacket and can use a whip and spurs: Horses hoods and blinkers are prohibited. ===Laser Run=== In 2008, the UIPM Congress passed a motion to change the competition format of the modern pentathlon to combine the shoot and run disciplines. This is now known as the \\"Laser Run\\" and is the final event of the day's competition. In the individual competition for men and women at Senior, Junior and Youth A levels, athletes start with a handicap start, approximately 25 m run, to a shooting range where they are required to hit five targets (time limit 50 seconds) before beginning an 800-metre run. This is repeated three further times for a total of 20 targets and 3200 m run. Two thousand (2000) pentathlon points are awarded for a time of 12.30 minutes. Each second faster or slower than the prescribed time is worth ¬±4 points. The laser-run is also included in relay competitions in teams of 2 or 3 pentathletes. However, the format differs slightly in that only two series of the course are repeated (five targets down (time limit 50\\" for youth); 800 m run; five targets down (time limit 50\\" for youth); 800 m run) for each of the pentathletes. For team of three athletes, 2000 points are awarded for a time 25.00 minutes. Each second faster or slower than the prescribed time is worth +/-4 points. For team of two athletes, 2000 points are awarded for a time 17.00 minutes. Each second faster or slower than the prescribed time is worth +/-4 points. Within the laser-run the shooting takes place with a completely safe and environmentally friendly laser pistol, fired at a target from a distance of 10 metres. The shooting competition is in four series; each series consists of hitting five targets with an unlimited number of shots in a maximum time of 50 seconds on a target of dimension 59.5 mm. If after 50\\" one or more targets have not been hit (or the athlete did not hit 5 times the valid zone), the pentathlete can start on the running leg without being penalised. Only after having hit five targets using an unlimited number of shots in the time limit of 50\\" can the pentathlete start from the shooting station to perform the first running leg of 800 m. After the first leg, the pentathletes return to their shooting stations, where they must reset their target, (only the pentathlete is authorised to reset their target) and then start the second shooting series that consists of hitting five targets using an unlimited number of shots but in the time limit of 50\\". The pentathlete repeats the same procedure for the second shooting series and second running leg of 800 m. After the fourth shooting series the pentathletes perform the fourth and final running leg of 800m to the finish line. The laser-run uses electronic targets which consist of one black single aim and five green/red lamps indicators. ===National Federations=List of presidents== * Gustaf Dyrssen (1948‚Äì1960) * Sven Thofelt (1960‚Äì1988) * Igor Novikov (1988‚Äì1992) * Klaus Schormann (1992‚Äìpresent) ==Modern Pentathlon competitionsOlympic Games=== From 1912 to 1980 the Olympic Modern Pentathlon competition was held over five days with one event per day. Between 1984 and 1992, the competition was held over four days with either running and shooting or swimming and shooting on the same day. For the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, the competition was a one-day event in which 32 men who qualified via pre-Olympic competitions participated. In 1998, the UIPM received approval for women to compete in the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and so 24 men and 24 women competed in individual competition and for the first time in history, the Pentathlon venues were 96% sold out. UIPM subsequently received an increase in the quota and in Athens 2004, 32 men and 32 women competed and both competitions were 100% sold-out. Following this success, UIPM received in February 2006 a further increase in quota from the IOC Executive Board ‚Äì in Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, 36 men & 36 Women took part in the Olympic Modern Pentathlon event. The same quota has also been confirmed for the 2012 London Olympic Games. ===World championships=== Senior, Junior and Under 19 World Championships (formerly known as Youth A) take place annually, with male and female athletes competing in individual, team and relay events. From 2018 the Senior World Championships will be renamed as the UIPM Pentathlon World Championships. The Junior category is for pentathletes aged 23 and under, while the Under 19 World Championships is the only one that adopts the Tetrathlon format, where riding is omitted. Athletes compete in qualification groups for the right to take part in the final, which can include up to 36 athletes. Individual medals and prize money are awarded as well as team medals which are decided by adding the top three individual team members' scores together. Relay events involve two athletes competing in turn throughout the various disciplines. A mixed relay has been included since 2009 in all World Championships and World Cups, and the Youth Olympic Games mixed relay uniquely gives athletes from different countries the opportunity to compete for medals in unison. ===Pentathlon World Cup === A World Cup series for both men and women has been organised since 1990. Each year, between 4 and 6 World Cup competitions and a World Cup Final are organised, and the whole package is called the World Cup, renamed in 2018 as the UIPM Pentathlon World Cup. The best 36 athletes qualify for the World Cup Final via a league table constructed from their three best results at World Cup competitions. Prize money is also available. ===Continental championships === Continental championships are organised by the Confederations of UIPM: Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, South America and NORCECA (North America, Central America and Caribbean). ==Athletes== See :Category:Modern pentathletes by nationality ===Olympic Pentathletes=== See :Category:Olympic modern pentathletes == See also == * List of shooting sports organizations ==References External links == * * UIPMtv.org / Live Streaming of World Cup Events Category:Modern pentathlon Category:Shooting sports organizations Category:Sports organizations established in 1948 ","title":"Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne"},{"id":"20443222","text":"Petter Meyer (born 21 February 1985) is a Finnish footballer currently representing GrIFK of the Kakkonen.

Brannon regularly introduced new pop songs in a live format over New York City radio on the WOR Mutual Broadcasting Company broadcast coast to coast. Early in November 1949, Brannon sang \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" over the airwaves for WOR, promoting the Gene Autry classic. By November 25, \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" began its appearance on the music charts. Various popular artists had initially turned down the opportunity to promote the record, including Bing Crosby, due to its slow tempo. However, after hearing the faster and more upbeat Brannon rendition, Crosby sang his own rendition during his CBS Chesterfield radio show on December 14, 1949. Brannon is known to have recorded at least two songs during his short career in music. Both were released in early 1948. One was titled \\"Orchids in the Snow\\", written by composer Edward A. Khoury, and the other was titled \\"I'm a Tumbleweed\\", written by Rusty Keefer. In March, 1954, Bing Crosby, still mourning the recent death of his wife Dixie Lee, was considering retirement. Almost immediately, plans were made by a Hollywood production company to issue a biopic of the famous crooner and approached Brannon (who possessed a similar appearance to Crosby) to play the lead. As Brannon mulled over the offer, he became aware of organized-crime connections to the project. Brannon \\"dragged his feet\\" and put it off as long as possible until Crosby, revelling in the success of his recently released film White Christmas, rescinded his retirement plans and the biopic was shelved indefinitely. Due to a deferred movie career and through the prompting of his wife, Pauline Woolman-Brannon (ex-wife of stuntman Harry Woolman), Brannon left New York City (and the recording industry) in late 1954 and resettled in Gloucester City, New Jersey. Brannon took a management position at a nightclub called Lew Palma's House of Fun on Powell Street. Brannon was a regular performer in it and lived with his family on the second floor. Through his wife, Brannon soon became affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, presently known as the Community of Christ, and was ordained as a priest by the mid-1960s. Brannon's adopted son, Harry Gerald Brannon, a Sergeant in the United States Army, died in South Vietnam on August 15, 1966, at age 30. Harry, known as Jerry, was the biological son of stuntman Harry Woolman. He died of Alzheimer's disease at age 71. == References == Category:1920 births Category:1991 deaths Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American members of the Community of Christ Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease Category:People from Gloucester City, New Jersey Category:20th-century American singers Category:Songwriters from New Jersey ","title":"Harry Brannon"},{"id":"20443323","text":"Bluebell United Football Club is an Irish association football club originally based in Bluebell, Dublin.

It was built in the early 1930s in the Louis XVI style, on Boulevard Adolphe Max/Adolphe Maxlaan, in the heart of Brussels. ==HistoryOrigins and early history=== Under the reign of King Leopold II, following the covering of the Senne, Brussels was remodelled with large boulevards and green avenues. The then-mayor of the City of Brussels, Jules Anspach (1829‚Äì1879), contributed to the transformation of the urban landscape of the capital by the realisation of the thoroughfare from the North Station to the South Station. The Hotel Le Plaza opened its doors in 1930. Soon after, prestigious guests came to stay there, and it became one of the symbols of Brussels' luxury hotel trade. In 1940, during the German occupation, the hotel was placed under the authority of the German troops and the military commander for Belgium and northern France took his quarters there. Premeditating its destruction, the Hotel Le Plaza was, exactly like the Palace of Justice, made into a booby-trap by the Germans, before the arrival of the Allied Forces. When it exploded, it killed two British Army officers: Captain George Hayton (age 32) and Major Anthony Wright (age 30), and destroyed the hotel's winter garden and sumptuous stained glass dome. Thankfully, the rest of the hotel was not damaged. The song Ind√©pendance Cha Cha was played for the first time in the hotel during the negotiations about Congolese independence from Belgium in 1960. File:Plaza8web.jpgThe lobby File:Hotel Le Plaza, Brussels, 1929.jpgThe main front File:Th√©√¢tre.jpgThe theatre File:Restaurant Esterel.jpgThe winter garden ===Closure, renovation and reopening=== The Hotel Le Plaza was obliged, like many of its contemporaries, to close in 1976. Twenty years passed before the rebirth of the Hotel le Plaza under the impulse of its present owner, Baron van Gysel de Meise. With a view to give the building its original vocation back, while equipping it with the very latest applications of modern technique, the Soci√©t√© de Gestion H√¥teli√®re undertook, from February 1995, considerable renovation and fitting works for an investment of 400 million Belgian francs.owner interview The restoration works were placed under the direction of decorator Pierre-Yves Rochon‚Äîwho was in particular in charge of the decoration of the H√¥tel George-V in Paris‚Å†‚Äîand of Anne van Gysel, in order to recreate in the most faithful way the old atmosphere, combining the warmth of a tapestry from the Gobelins National Manufactory, the glossy shine of a rare marble and the diffused light created by chandeliers in amethyst crystal. ==Building== The architect of the Hotel Le Plaza, Michel Polak, found inspiration in the style of the H√¥tel George-V in Paris, ensuring by its concrete frame a remarkable solidity. The frontage was covered with French stones. The interior was designed to reflect the ideas of brightness and splendour: high ceilings, large corridors, large light rooms, several naturally lighted bathrooms, majestic stairways covering 8 floors, decorated with stained glass windows and fringed with wrought iron hand-rails. ===Rooms=== The Plaza offers 190 rooms and suites on 7 floors: 109 classic rooms, 53 Deluxe rooms, 20 Prestige rooms, 4 Executive Suites, 1 Plaza Suite and 1 Presidential Suite, which is one of the biggest in the Benelux. The rooms are amongst the largest of the City with a minimal size of . The suites, with high ceilings, are situated along large and spacious corridors. ===Theatre=== The theatre of the Hotel Le Plaza is a former cinema with a surface of , designated as a historical monument through a royal decree. It was built in 1930, in a unique Spanish‚ÄìArab‚ÄìMoorish style. Under the name of Acropole Cinema, it opened in 1928 and had an interior designed in a Spanish style with many false windows and barley sugar columns. Seating was provided in stalls and balcony. At one time (possibly in the 1930s), it ran cine- variety shows. The entrance to the cinema was located at the left-hand side of the twin-blocked building and originally had a large vertical PLAZA sign over the entrance. There was a Plaza Taverne located on the corner of Boulevard Adolphe Max and /, now the main entrance to hotel. The rear of the building backs onto the former Vari√©ti√©s theatre (Cinerama) around the corner on the narrow Rue de Malines. The decision was taken during the renovation to keep the original boxes, the genuine bracket-lamps, the stage, as well as the richly sculpted wall ornaments of Andalusian inspiration. It is nowadays used as a banquet hall and conference facility. ===L'Est√©rel restaurant=== The restaurant features the particularity of combining a bar and a restaurant for 48 guests. The decoration of the restaurant is very luxurious like the hotel. The particularity of this decoration is the painted ceiling of the restaurant, picturing a mainly blue sky. The menu, created by chef Olivier Bontemps and his sous-chef Alexandre Van Kalck, varies with the seasons to guarantee fresh quality ingredients.

Many artists have been known to give art freely to each other, in an effort to pass along ideas, etc. Picasso and many of his contemporaries were fond of this. Duchamp was one of the first modern day artists to Gift to the public with his piece, Fountain, for an art show in 1917. He gave the piece under the name of \\"R. Mutt,\\" presumably to hide his identity as the artist. He actually had to pay $7 to have the piece exhibited in the show, and never intended on making any money from it. He gave it freely for all to see and to push forward the Dada movement. In the 1950s, Ray Johnson started doing Mail art. He spread the idea to many other artists and it still occurs today. In 2002, a 6 ft X 53 ft mural by Roy Lichtenstein was installed in the Times Square Subway Station in New York City. It was given as a gift by the artist to all New Yorkers.http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/exhibitionInfo/exhibition/36702/lang/1 In recent years, Gifted Art has primarily been embraced by graffiti and urban artists. Many graffiti artists consider the work they do to be art for the public.

Erster Theil etlicher Chor√§le (commonly known as Acht Chor√§le zum Pr√§ambulieren, PWC 45‚Äì52, T. 1‚Äì8, PC 1‚Äì8) is a collection of liturgical organ music by Johann Pachelbel, published during his lifetime. It contains eight chorale preludes in seven different styles. ==General information== Erster Theil etlicher Chor√§le (literally \\"First Part of [a collection of] assorted chorales\\") is one of Pachelbel's earliest publications. It is a mystery, however, when or where it was first published. Johann Mattheson mentions that the first edition appeared before 1693, while the edition lacked any indications of the year of publication. The only copy extant today is a Nuremberg edition by Johann Christoph Weigel, who also published Pachelbel's Hexachordum Apollinis (1699) and a reprint of his Musicalische Erg√∂tzung.Welter, p. 180. This copy is marked \\"1693\\", however, there are two problems with this date. The first is that it was added by another hand at a later date, the second is that Weigel did not start working in Nuremberg until at least 1698. Thus, the surviving copy must be a second or a third edition.Welter, pp. 136‚Äì9. Given the number of reprints, Erster Theil must have enjoyed considerable popularity. The title indicates that Pachelbel may have wished to publish a set of chorale collections, however, no other chorale publications by him are known. Johann Christoph Bach (1671‚Äì1721), Johann Sebastian's eldest brother and one of Pachelbel's most important pupils, may have assisted with the publication of the first edition of Erster Theil etlicher Chor√§le, for the engraving closely resembles his handwriting. A manuscript collection of chorale preludes by Johann Christoph Bach (1642‚Äì1703), Johann Sebastian's first cousin once removed, organist at Eisenach (where Pachelbel made acquaintance with members of the Bach family during his stay there 1677‚Äì1678), may have some connection to Pachelbel's Erster Theil, given the similarity of not only the subject but also the titles of both collections: * Pachelbel: Erster Theil etlicher Chor√§le welche bey w√§rendem Gottes Dienst zum Pr√§mbuliren gebrauchet werden k√∂nnen * Bach: 44 Chor√§le welche bey w√§renden Gottes-Dienst zum Praembuliren gebraucht werden k√∂nnen It is not known, however, who influenced whom.Welter, pp. 149‚Äì50. No other printed collections of chorale preludes survive from the period, making Pachelbel's Erster Theil unique in its choice of subject.Welter, p. 140. Decades after its publication, the collection was singled out by Mattheson, who described the contents as \\"models [of chorale writing] not to be dismissed\\" in his Der vollkommene Capellmeister (1739).Welter, p. 136. ==ContentsIch ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ=== This famous chorale is presented as a very straightforward three-voice piece, with the cantus firmus in upper voiceWelter, p. 144. and brief snatches of fore-imitation in the lower voices throughout the setting.Nolte, Butt, Grove. First bars of Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ. ===Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern=== The chorale \\"Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern\\", associated variously with Epiphany, Whit, Annunciation, and Sundays after Trinity, is set by Pachelbel as a three-voice prelude with the chorale in the bass voice. Pachelbel uses fore-imitation throughout the piece: whenever the next phrase of the chorale is about to begin, the upper voices anticipate its melodic contour in brief imitative passages.Welter, pp. 145‚Äì46. First bars of Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern. ===Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren=== The chorale \\"Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren\\", an old doxology setting of Psalm 103, is presented by Pachelbel in a three-voice setting with the cantus firmus in the tenor voice.Welter, p. 144. The arrangement of voices and the white mensural notation, both derived from the German polyphonic song, are unique in Pachelbel's surviving oeuvre, as is the ornamentation used in Wir glauben all an einen Gott.Nolte, Butt, Grove. First bars of Nun lob, mein Seel', den Herren. ===Vater unser im Himmelreich=== The chorale \\"Vater unser im Himmelreich\\" is a famous hymn, a versification of the Lord's Prayer. Pachelbel presents it as a four-voice setting with the chorale in the upper voice. Fore- imitation is used throughout the piece in well-developed three-voice sections, resulting in what Pachelbel scholar Kathryn Welter described as \\"the most magnificent of the eight preludes [of Erster Theil] in its discipline of construction and richness of harmonies.\\"Welter, p. 146. First bars of Vater unser im Himmelreich. ===Wir glauben all an einen Gott=== This setting of the German Creed \\"\\" is the only known example of ornamented cantus firmus setting in Pachelbel's surviving works. The style, which goes back to the time of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck and Heinrich Scheidemann, was not wholly unknown to Pachelbel, for he would normally use ornamentation in his chorale variations. A possible explanation is that Pachelbel may have been reluctant to use ornamentation in pieces intended for congregational singing. He probably included the piece in Erster Theil as a model.Welter, pp. 144‚Äì45. The setting is in three voices, and the ornamented chorale is in the upper voice. First bars of Wir glauben all an einen Gott. ===Dies sind dir heil'gen zehn Gebot=== The text of the chorale references the Ten Commandments. Pachelbel's setting (P 50a) is a four-voice fugue in G mixolydian. The first line of the chorale is used as the subject, which appears 11 times. The last statement of the subject is in the lowest voice, establishing with the final notes the pitch the congregation would enter after the piece is performed by the organist.Welter, p. 142. Another setting (P 50b) was formerly attributed to Pachelbel and included in this set. It has since been attributed to Johann Gottfried Walther.Gr√∂nqvist, Klas. Johann Pachelbel: a comprehensive list of his works. Taken 7 May 2013 from http://web.comhem.se/~u87748742/Pachelbel.htm. First bars of Dies sind dir heil'gen zehn Gebot. ===Jesus Christus unser Heiland, der von uns=== The well- known Communion hymn \\"Jesus Christus, unser Heiland, der von uns den Gotteszorn wandt\\" is treated by Pachelbel in a manner most unexpected for the period: the setting is a bicinium, i.e. a two-voice piece with the chorale in long notes in one voice and fast ornamental passages in the other voice. Such pieces were very popular about a hundred years before Pachelbel's time, but by the end of the 17th century they were rarely seen. Pachelbel modifies the old form by splitting the bicinium into two sections: the first has the cantus firmus in the upper voice and the ornaments in the lower voice, while the second (starting at bar 30) reverses this arrangement. Further modification of the classic bicinium form occurs when Pachelbel uses the technique of fore- imitation (for which he was particularly known), when the ornamental passages include motifs that anticipate the chorale melody. The technique is used in many instances throughout the piece, including the very first bars.Welter, pp. 143‚Äì44. First bars of Jesus Christus unser Heiland, der von uns. ===Vom Himmel hoch, da komm' ich her=== For the last piece of the collection Pachelbel chose Martin Luther's famous Christmas hymn \\"Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her.\\" He sets it as a three-voice piece with the chorale in the bass. Unlike Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern which uses the same arrangement, the upper voices do not provide mere fore-imitation, but engage in highly original figurations. Pachelbel scholar Ewald Nolte suggested that these were probably intended as imitations of birdsong, a somewhat popular phenomenon in the instrumental music of the 17th century.Nolte 1954, pp. 173‚Äì74. In any case, these fanciful figurations, together with the compound meter, suggest a pastoral mood.Welter, p. 146. First bars of Von Himmel hoch, da komm' ich her. ==NotesReferences== * Apel, Willi. 1972. The History of Keyboard Music to 1700. Translated by Hans Tischler. Indiana University Press. .

Salome appears in the apocryphal Gospel known as the Gospel of James as an associate of the unnamed midwife at the Nativity of Jesus, and is regularly depicted with the midwife in Eastern Orthodox icons of the Nativity of Jesus, though she has long vanished from most Western depictions.Schiller, pp.63-65 Salome herself is clearly distinguished from \\"the midwife\\" in this infancy gospel attributed to James the Just, also known as the Protevangelion of James. The passage in Chapter XIX and XX reads, in the edition and translation by M. R. James: > (Ch XIX, 3) And the midwife went forth of the cave and Salome met her. And > she said to her: Salome, Salome, a new sight have I to tell thee. A virgin > hath brought forth, which her nature alloweth not. And Salome said: As the > Lord my God liveth, if I make not trial and prove her nature I will not > believe that a virgin hath brought forth. (XX. 1) And the midwife went in > and said unto Mary: Order thyself, for there is no small contention arisen > concerning thee.

Of the text, James says \\"There is as yet no really critical > edition of the text, in which all manuscripts and versions are made use of. > I follow Tischendorf's in the main.\\" J. R. Porter writes that the above passage is \\"clearly an adaptation of the episode of Doubting Thomas.\\" There are also other versions of the story in various texts. Greek paintings, as in the illustration here, often labelled the midwife as \\"Emea\\" (ŒóŒúŒïŒë, ·º° ŒºŒ±·øñŒ±, \\"the midwife\\"), and in the West this was sometimes taken to be her name, rather than her job. That Salome is the first, after the midwife, to bear witness to the birth and to recognize Jesus as the Christ, are circumstances that tend to connect her with Salome the disciple. By the High Middle Ages this Salome was often identified with Mary Salome in the West, and therefore regarded as the believing midwife.Schiller, p.64 ==Notes References == * Gertrude Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I,1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 62, Category:Infancy Gospels Category:Angelic visionaries Category:New Testament apocrypha people ru:–°–∞–ª–æ–º–µ—è-–ø–æ–≤–∏—Ç—É—Ö–∞ ","title":"Salome (Gospel of James)"},{"id":"20444072","text":"The sheepshead porgy (Calamus penna) is a species of fish of the porgy family, Sparidae, only found in the Atlantic Ocean.

The agency enforced humane laws, and investigated cases of animal cruelty. == Agency history == The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was incorporated in 1866 by a special state legislation to prevent animal cruelty through various programs including animal adoption services, animal education programs and an armed law enforcement division. The Humane Law Enforcement Division was a branch of the ASPCA staffed by 20 armed New York State peace officers who responded to reports of animal cruelty in marked ASPCA patrol cars in the New York City area as well as perform undercover operations. The officers were empowered through NYS Criminal Procedure Law and NY Agriculture and Markets laws to investigate allegations of animal abuse, seize animals being abused, and make arrests for the prosecution for animal cruelty. In 2000, the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division received 33,000 calls for service which resulted in 55 arrests, 30 summonses being issued, and 537 animal seizures. == Disbandment of the Law Enforcement Division == In December 2013, the president of the ASPCA stated that the Law Enforcement Division would be disbanding and the enforcement of humane laws and response to calls for animal abuse and cruelty would become the responsibility of the NYPD. By early January 2014, half of the officers of the division had been terminated. The reason given for disbanding was that the NYPD was better equipped and had more manpower to handle enforcement of humane laws and to respond to calls for animal abuse/cruelty. Response to the disbanding has been mixed, with some saying the NYPD can do a better job, while others say the NYPD has other, higher-priority situations to handle and the response to animal abuse and cruelty will be slow. == Power and authority of ASPCA Law Enforcement Officers == * ASPCA Law Enforcement officers are New York State peace officers under NYS Criminal Procedure Law 2.10 and may make arrests, use physical and deadly force, make car stops, issue summonses, and may carry a firearm, baton, pepper spray, and handcuffs. * ASPCA Law Enforcement officers may seize any stray or abandoned animal on public streets in accordance with N.Y. Agriculture & Market laws Section 373 subsection 1.State Anti-Cruelty Investigatory-Arrest Powers * ASPCA Law Enforcement officers may lawfully seize any animal on private property that has been kept for more than 12 hours in an unhealthy, dangerous or unsanitary condition in accordance with NY Agriculture and Markets Law Section 373 subsection 2 provided a complaint has been filed. State Anti- Cruelty Investigatory-Arrest Powers * ASPCA Law Enforcement officers with a court order may make regular visits to any residence or establishment where an animal is being kept to check to see if the animal is receiving necessary food, water and care according to N.Y. Agriculture & Market law Section 373 subsection 7. * NYS Agriculture and Markets Law Section 371 permits an ASPCA Law Enforcement officer to \\"interfere to prevent the perpetration of any act of cruelty upon any animal\\" in the presence of the ASPCA officer. == Crime scene investigation == In 2007, the ASPCA created an animal cruelty crime scene investigation unit. The CSI unit uses a Ford E-450 vehicle equipped with a surgery area for injured animals, evidence processing, documentation, and storage equipment. The van is staffed with a forensic veterinarian to help document evidence to aid in the prosecution of perpetrators. Although the vehicle is used primarily in New York City, it can be deployed to any area of the United States at the request of a law enforcement agency. The Crime Scene Investigation unit was not affected by the disbandment of the Law Enforcement Division and remains active. == Law enforcement training == ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement officers received peace officer training in addition to investigator training and firearms training. In 1999, ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement recruits began attending a specialized investigator training course through the New York City Police academy. == Equipment == ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement officers were equipped with either a Glock 19 9mm or a Smith & Wesson 5906 9mm handgun, pepper spray, ASP baton, and handcuffs. Their squad cars were primarily Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors, in addition to vans, and SUVs. They carried poles and cages for seizures and catches. == Rank structure and title == There were five titles (referred to as ranks) in the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division: * Assistant Director of Law Enforcement * Executive Officer * Supervisory Special Investigator * Special Investigator * Special Agent == Fallen officers== One former ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement officer is known to have died in the line of duty. The death occurred after the disbandment of the agency and was due to a duty related illness rather than a direct result of carrying out the duties of the position. {  - ! Officer ! Date of death !

The squadron was first organized during World War II as the 332d Fighter Squadron. It trained fighter pilots until March 1944 when it was disbanded in a reorganization of the Army Air Forces' training and support units. The squadron was again organized in 1953 as an air defense organization. It moved to Greenland in 1960. ==HistoryWorld War II=== Formation of P-38 Lightnings The squadron was first activated at Hamilton Field, California in July 1942 as one of the three original squadrons of the 329th Fighter Group.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 210 Four days after its activation, the squadron moved to Paine Field, Washington and equipped with Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. The squadron initially acted as an Operational Training Unit (OTU). The OTU program involved establishing an oversized parent unit which would provide cadres to organize \\"satellite groups.\\"Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi The 332d also served as a Replacement Training Unit, training Lightning pilots in the final phases of fighter pilot training before shipping overseas. In September 1942 the 329th Group headquarters moved to Grand Central Air Terminal, California, while the 332d moved to Santa Ana Army Air Base. Most of the group eventually found itself at Ontario Army Air Field, California. The squadrons moved there in 1943, and were joined the other squadrons later that year, while group headquarters moved in February 1944.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 417 The squadron was disbanded in 1944 as part of an Army Air Forces (AAF) reorganization in which units not programmed to deploy overseas were replaced by AAF Base Units in order to free up manpower for overseas assignment because standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were not proving well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each AAF base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 ===Cold war air defense=== The squadron was reconstituted, redesignated the 332d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and activated at New Castle County Airport, Delaware in March 1953 as the second squadron of the 525th Air Defense Group. It was equipped with Lockheed F-94C Starfires armed with Mighty Mouse Rockets rather than the cannons of its sister squadron's F-94B Starfires.Cornett & Johnson, p.121Cornett & Johnson, p.127 It continued in the air defense role at New Castle until August 1955, when its personnel and Starfires were transferred to the 97th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron as part of Air Defense Command's Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.Buss, Sturm, Volan, & McMullen, p.6Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 323‚Äì324 F-86D firing a Mighty Mouse rocket Project Arrow did not see the end of the 332d. Instead, it moved on paper to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, where it took over the personnel and North American F-86D Sabres of the 2d Fighter-Interceptor SquadronThe 2d moved to Suffolk County Air Force Base to join its World War II headquarters in another Project Arrow move. Maurer, Combat Squadrons, 14. At McGuire, the squadron was assigned to the 4709th Air Defense Wing until the implementation of the Semi- Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system. The 4621st Air Defense Wing (SAGE) was organized at McGuire in the Spring of 1956 and attached to the 4709th Wing until the 4621st Wing assumed the mission of the 4709th wing in October 1956.Cornett & Johnson, p. 66 As SAGE became operational, the squadron upgraded its Sabres to the F-86L model, which was equipped with data link for interception control through the SAGE system. In July 1959, the squadron moved to England Air Force Base, Louisiana, where it began to train with Convair F-102 Delta Daggers, which were armed with AIM-4 Falcons. A little more than a year later, the unit moved to Thule Air Base, Greenland, where it resumed the air defense mission that had been carried out at Thule until March 1960 by the 327th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 403‚Äì404 The squadron was inactivated in 1965, when the air defense mission at Thule became one of surveillance. ==Lineage== * Constituted as the 332d Fighter Squadron (Twin Engine) on 24 June 1942 : Activated on 10 July 1942 : Disbanded on 31 March 1944 * Reconstituted and redesignated 332d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 11 February 1953 : Activated on 27 March 1953Lineage, including assignments, aircraft and stations, through 1963 in Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 410 : Inactivated on 31 May 1965 ===Assignments=== * 329th Fighter Group, 10 July 1942 ‚Äì 31 March 1944 * 525th Air Defense Group, 27 March 1953 * 4709th Air Defense Wing, 18 August 1955 * 4621st Air Defense Wing (later New York Air Defense Sector), 1 October 1956 * 4730th Air Defense Group, 8 February 1957 * 33rd Air Division, 10 July 1959 * Oklahoma City Air Defense Sector, 1 January 1960 * 4683rd Air Defense Wing, 1 September 1960 ‚Äì 31 May 1965 ===Stations=== * Hamilton Field, California, 10 July 1942 * Paine Field, Washington, 14 July 1942 * Santa Ana Army Air Base, California, 10 September 1942 * Ontario Army Air Field, California, 28 August 1943 * Santa Ana Army Air Base, California, 7 October 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1944 * New Castle County Airport, Delaware, 27 March 1953 * McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, 18 August 1955 * England Air Force Base, Louisiana, 10 July 1959 * Thule Air Base, Greenland, 1 September 1960 ‚Äì 31 May 1965 ===Aircraft=== * Lockheed P-38 Lightning, 1942‚Äì1944 * Lockheed F-94C Starfire, 1953‚Äì1955 * North American F-86D Sabre, 1955‚Äì1957 * North American F-86L Sabre, 1957‚Äì1959 * Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, 1959-1965 ==References== ; Notes ; Citations ===Bibliography=== * * :: * * * Buss, Lydus H.(ed), Sturm, Thomas A., Volan, Denys, and McMullen, Richard F., History of Continental Air Defense Command and Air Defense Command July to December 1955, Directorate of Historical Services, Air Defense Command, Ent AFB, CO, (1956) * ==External links== 332 Category:Military units and formations established in 1953 Category:Aerospace Defense Command units ","title":"332d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron"},{"id":"20444535","text":"Anglia Square is a shopping centre in the north of Norwich city centre, in Norfolk, England. Opened in 1970, it was part of a larger Norwich redevelopment during this period, which was also complemented by the establishment of the HMSO building Sovereign House nearby, which opened in 1969. The square took six years to build, but was never actually finished. Pedestrian shop-lined walkways lead onto Anglia square which was originally open to the elements but now covered by a steel and glass structure ‚Äì added in the late 20th century. The red brick and concrete buildings are finished in the brutalist style. Forming the western boundary of the centre is the former HMSO building Sovereign House.

Magdalen Street and St Augustine's, which are two of the oldest streets in Norwich, date back to those times. During the 19th century, a Crape Manufactory ‚Äì a factory which produced a fabric often worn when mourning, was built where Anglia Square now stands. The area was badly bombed during the Baedeker raids in April 1942, during World War II and the area was deemed suitable for post-war development. === Redevelopment === The 1945 Norwich Plan, prepared for the city council by C.H. James, Rowland Pierce and Norwich City Engineer H.C. Rowlet, envisioned an urban dual carriageway encircling the city centre, creating ambitiously titled ‚Äúgates‚Äù (aka roundabouts) at every major intersection. Although it was unrealised in its entirety, the western and part of the northern sides of this ring road became the Inner Link Road, constructed between 1968 and 1975. Many historic buildings were cleared in the making of Anglia Square and the subsequent inner-ring road. One of the oldest was the Kings Arms public house on Botolph Street, which on its gable end in large iron characters were the letters \\"I\\" and \\"C\\" and the date \\"1646\\", now preserved in one of the Norwich museums. Also demolished was the Regency bank at the junction of Magdalen Street and Botoph Street. Some other Georgian and Victorian buildings along St George's Street that survived the war bombings as well as gabled and jettied Tudor buildings.

Together with Les Chaussettes Noires, they were among the first outfits to perform rock and roll music in France. ==Career== Les Chats Sauvages was originally composed of Dick Rivers (Herv√© Forneri) on vocals, John Rob (Jean-Claude Roboly) on guitar, James Fawler (G√©rard Roboly) on guitar, Jack Regard (G√©rard Jaquemus) on bass, and Willy Lewis (Wiliam Ta√Øeb) on drums. The later was successively replaced by Armand Molinetti, Dean Shelton and Andre Ceccarelli. In February 1961, the British music magazine, NME, reported that their concert at the Palais des Sports de Paris, whilst headlining with Vince Taylor, had turned into a full-scale riot. The departure of Rivers in the summer of 1962, who was replaced by Mike Shannon, affected the band's popularity, which nevertheless continued its career. They charted with the song \\"Derniers baisers\\", covered with success by C. J√©r√¥me in 1986 and Laurent Voulzy in 2006. In 1963, John Rob visited New York with the group's American manager, Andre M. Lauffer, a New York attorney, for the purpose of \\"making the rounds\\" of the popular television shows. They met with The Ed Sullivan Show producers and were promised consideration for a future appearance. The laws for overseas entertainers were restrictive and the group could not meet the requirements at that time. Les Chats Sauvages broke up in 1964, before briefly reappearing twice, including an album release in 1982 with Dick Rivers, to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of their formation. ==DiscographyAlbums=== * Les Chats Sauvages, Path√©-Marconi, 1961 * Les Chats Sauvages, Path√©-Marconi, 1962 * Les Chats Sauvages 1982, RCA, 1982 * Les Chats Sauvages In√©dits & titres rares, (unreleased and rare tracks), Path√©- Marconi, 1987 ===Singles=== * \\"Ma p'tite amie est vache\\" / \\"Le jour J\\" / \\"En avant l'amour\\" / \\"J'ai pris dans tes yeux\\" (Path√©, 1961) * \\"Je veux tout ce que tu veux\\" / \\"Trois en amour\\" / \\"Toi l'√©tranger\\" / \\"Hey Pony\\" (Path√©, 1961) * \\"Toi tu es bath pour moi\\" / \\"Dis-moi si c'est l'amour\\" / \\"Toi quel bonheur\\" / \\"Tu peins ton visage\\" (Path√©, 1961) * \\"Sous le ciel √©cossais\\" / \\"Un p'tit je ne sais quoi\\" / \\"Les bras de l'amour\\" / \\"Laisse-moi rire\\" (Path√©, 1961) * \\"Twist √† Saint-Tropez\\" / \\"C'est pas s√©rieux\\" / \\"Oh Boy\\" / \\"Est-ce que tu le sais ?\\" (Path√©, 1961) * \\"Laissez-nous twister\\" / \\"Un c≈ìur tout neuf\\" / \\"L'amour que j'ai pour toi\\" (Path√©, 1962) * \\"Je reviendrai\\" / \\"Tout ce qu'elle voudra\\" / \\"Toute la nuit\\" / \\"Oh Lady\\" (Path√©, 1962) * \\"Sherry\\" / \\"Mon copain\\" / \\"Derniers baisers\\" / \\"Tout le monde twiste\\" (Path√©, 1963) * \\"John, c'est l'amour\\" / \\"Horizon\\" / \\"Emm√®ne-moi\\" / \\"Judy, rappelle-moi\\" (Path√©, 1963) * \\"G√©n√©rique de 'le roi du village'\\" / \\"Th√®me d'Agn√®s\\" / \\"Venez, les filles!\\" / \\"!Mo√Øse twiste!\\" (Path√©, 1963) * \\"Dis-lui que je t'aime\\" / \\"Une fille comme toi\\" / \\"Quelle nouvelle\\" / \\"Allons, reviens danser\\" (Path√©, 1963) * \\"Laisse- moi chanter\\" / \\"O Val√©rie\\" / \\"Elle t'aime\\" / \\"Moins d'une minute\\" (Path√©, 1963) * \\"Jolie Fille\\" / \\"Seul\\" / \\"La Route\\" / \\"Ericka\\" (Path√© EG 759 1964) * \\"Merci\\" / \\"Je suis pr√™t\\" / \\"Obsession\\" / \\"Malgr√© tout √ßa\\" (Path√©, 1964) ==References * Jaime le Chat French No Official website Category:Musical groups established in 1961 Category:French rock music groups ","title":"Les Chats Sauvages"},{"id":"20444585","text":"In Philippine Culture, Loob or Kalooban refers to one's inner self, or, more specifically, to the internal dimension of a person's identity. Its external counterpart is labas - the physical, outward appearance. Loob is a core concept in Filipino Psychology, a field which is unthinkable without both the internal and external dimensions, \\"loob\\"/\\"labas\\". Loob or kalooban has been compared to similar concepts in other Southeast Asian and Oceanian cultures, such as the Indonesian concept of batin or kebatinan. == Loob as a Psycho- Moral Reality: Katauhan at Pagkatao == \\"Walang sarili kung walang loob.\\" According to a publication by Dionisio M. Miranda entitled Loob--The Filipino Within, we can view Loob as a Psycho-Moral Reality. This part of the publication tells us that Loob is actually made up of two more concepts, and these are Katauhan and Pagkatao. Now from this, most people would think that Katauhan and Pagkatao are similar concepts, but these translate to Personality and Character, respectively, which are also usually used interchangeably but are two very different things. Personality (Psychological), according to Loob as a Psycho-Moral Reality, embodies the traits, attitudes or habits that distinguish one individual from another. It is the complex or one's behavioral and emotional tendencies. It is not just the structure or the organization of these qualities, but it is the whole of these qualities that gives form and meaning to an individual and his existence. It is more or less static in the way that it is the basic or initial particularity of a person, what makes him different from everyone else. It could eventually be viewed from static to dynamic (changing) terms. Moral Character, on the other hand, is understood to be mainly dynamic and secondarily static. It is related to personality in the sense that character is based on personality and is initially determined by it. In the concrete sense, character is the aspect which constitutes one's ethicity which structures him not only as subject (ako) but further as a moral subject and moral agent. Content-wise, it is the values and attitudes, principles and norms, ideals and projects that lend the person his moral form (kaloobang makatao). In the generic sense, it responds to perceptions of realities of good and evil, right and wrong, appropriate and inappropriate and so on. Personality as Katauhan, Character as Pagkatao The core of both personality and character is the ego or the self. Sarili (self) manifests itself either as personality or as character. === Loob as Katauhan (Personality) === * Makes us distinct/unique from others * Static Under Katauhan are the following distinctive constituents:  Malay (Awareness, Consciousness)  * One needs to be active; \\"awareness is not awareness unless it is active\\" ** Malay/Awareness about the environment/external aspects and about yourself ** Pagbabalik-loob (returning to one's true self)  Dama (Could be internal or external)  * Sensitivity to your surroundings * This is the most visible form of Katauhan ** Emotions (specific and objective) ** Sensations ** Desire (combination of both)  Ugali (Behavior, Tendency, Habit)  * As biological (predisposition; habit) * As will (goals, instincts; how you act) * As how one decides/decision making (action, will) === Loob as Pagkatao (Character) === * More on one's moral aspect * Dynamic not real Under Pagkatao are the following distinctive constituents:  Isip (Mind, Thinking, Sense)  * As thoughts, content of consciousness, awareness (malay) * As intelligence (talino), wisdom (karunungan) * As reasoning (katuwiran) ** Intelligence, skill, critically analyze (logic) ** faithful to what they know to be true, reality (katotohanan) * As one's affirmation/stand (paninindigan) - action of one's thoughts; there is a moral aspect to these actions ** Beliefs, principles  Bait (Goodness - Intrinsic, Critical, Practical)  * Intrinsic, innate (everyone has goodness within themselves) * Intuitive (in Isip, the discrimination of goodness occurs discursively) ** The language consistently associates bait with the more positive emotions and sentiments. ** Knowing what is acceptable and what is not. ** This kind of bait may initially characterize the katauhan of the self (sarili) for example, as a kind of natural endowment. In being consistent with the self (sarili) over time, this defines the pagkatao (character) of a person. In other words, \\"bait must not remain merely natural; it must also become personal.\\" * Practical ** There are \\"levels\\" of bait (ex. kulang sa bait (lacking in common sense), nasiraan ng bait (mad, crazed, psychotic) etc.) ** There is actually a \\"set\\" amount of bait (it should be just right; no more, no less)  Kalooban  * Right or wrong (tama o mali; moral will) ** Kusa (indicative moral will) refers to both purpose and intention. ** Sadya (moral imperative) where the ought that is presented is a value for the person himself (when an object is encountered as a force, therefore imperative) either as something that is already part of his nature or something needed to perfect it. ** Pasiya (moral decisions of the will) is that which takes a clear and concrete stand for or against such options (characteristic choices). Kalooban as decisive will looks similar to isip as paninindigan.

SANs are primarily used to access storage devices, such as disk arrays and tape libraries from servers so that the devices appear to the operating system as direct-attached storage. A SAN typically is a dedicated network of storage devices not accessible through the local area network (LAN). Although a SAN provides only block-level access, file systems built on top of SANs do provide file-level access and are known as shared-disk file systems. == Storage architectures== The Fibre Channel SAN connects servers to storage via Fibre Channel switches. Storage area networks (SANs) are sometimes referred to as network behind the servers and historically developed out of a centralized data storage model, but with its own data network. A SAN is, at its simplest, a dedicated network for data storage. In addition to storing data, SANs allow for the automatic backup of data, and the monitoring of the storage as well as the backup process. A SAN is a combination of hardware and software. It grew out of data- centric mainframe architectures, where clients in a network can connect to several servers that store different types of data. To scale storage capacities as the volumes of data grew, direct-attached storage (DAS) was developed, where disk arrays or just a bunch of disks (JBODs) were attached to servers. In this architecture, storage devices can be added to increase storage capacity. However, the server through which the storage devices are accessed is a single point of failure, and a large part of the LAN network bandwidth is used for accessing, storing and backing up data. To solve the single point of failure issue, a direct-attached shared storage architecture was implemented, where several servers could access the same storage device. DAS was the first network storage system and is still widely used where data storage requirements are not very high. Out of it developed the network- attached storage (NAS) architecture, where one or more dedicated file server or storage devices are made available in a LAN. Therefore, the transfer of data, particularly for backup, still takes place over the existing LAN. If more than a terabyte of data was stored at any one time, LAN bandwidth became a bottleneck. Therefore, SANs were developed, where a dedicated storage network was attached to the LAN, and terabytes of data are transferred over a dedicated high speed and bandwidth network. Within the SAN, storage devices are interconnected. Transfer of data between storage devices, such as for backup, happens behind the servers and is meant to be transparent. In a NAS architecture data is transferred using the TCP and IP protocols over Ethernet. Distinct protocols were developed for SANs, such as Fibre Channel, iSCSI, Infiniband. Therefore, SANs often have their own network and storage devices, which have to be bought, installed, and configured. This makes SANs inherently more expensive than NAS architectures. == Components == Dual port 8 Gb FC host bus adapter card SANs have their own networking devices, such as SAN switches. To access the SAN, so-called SAN servers are used, which in turn connect to SAN host adapters. Within the SAN, a range of data storage devices may be interconnected, such as SAN-capable disk arrays, JBODS and tape libraries. === Host layer === Servers that allow access to the SAN and its storage devices are said to form the host layer of the SAN. Such servers have host adapters, which are cards that attach to slots on the server motherboard (usually PCI slots) and run with a corresponding firmware and device driver. Through the host adapters the operating system of the server can communicate with the storage devices in the SAN. In Fibre channel deployments, a cable connects to the host adapter through the gigabit interface converter (GBIC). GBICs are also used on switches and storage devices within the SAN, and they convert digital bits into light impulses that can then be transmitted over the Fiber Channel cables. Conversely, the GBIC converts incoming light impulses back into digital bits. The predecessor of the GBIC was called gigabit link module (GLM). === Fabric layer === Qlogic SAN-switch with optical Fibre Channel connectors installed The fabric layer consists of SAN networking devices that include SAN switches, routers, protocol bridges, gateway devices, and cables. SAN network devices move data within the SAN, or between an initiator, such as an HBA port of a server, and a target, such as the port of a storage device. When SANs were first built, hubs were the only devices that were Fibre Channel capable, but Fibre Channel switches were developed and hubs are now rarely found in SANs. Switches have the advantage over hubs that they allow all attached devices to communicate simultaneously, as a switch provides a dedicated link to connect all its ports with one another. When SANs were first built, Fibre Channel had to be implemented over copper cables, these days multimode optical fibre cables are used in SANs. SAN networks are usually built with redundancy, so SAN switches are connected with redundant links. SAN switches connect the servers with the storage devices and are typically non- blocking allowing transmission of data across all attached wires at the same time. SAN switches are for redundancy purposes set up in a meshed topology. A single SAN switch can have as few as 8 ports and up to 32 ports with modular extensions. So-called director-class switches can have as many as 128 ports. In switched SANs the Fibre Channel switched fabric protocol FC-SW-6 is used under which every device in the SAN has a hardcoded World Wide Name (WWN) address in the host bus adapter (HBA). If a device is connected to the SAN its WWN is registered in the SAN switch name server. In place of a WWN, or worldwide port name (WWPN), SAN Fibre Channel storage device vendors may also hardcode a worldwide node name (WWNN). The ports of storage devices often have a WWN starting with 5, while the bus adapters of servers start with 10 or 21. === Storage layer === Fibre Channel is a layered technology that starts at the physical layer and progresses through the protocols to the upper-level protocols like SCSI and SBCCS. On top of the Fibre Channel-Switched Protocol is often the serialized Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) protocol, implemented in servers and SAN storage devices. It allows software applications to communicate, or encode data, for storage devices. The internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) over Ethernet and the Infiniband protocols may also be found implemented in SANs, but are often bridged into the Fibre Channel SAN. However, Infiniband and iSCSI storage devices, in particular, disk arrays, are available. The various storage devices in a SAN are said to form the storage layer. It can include a variety of hard disk and magnetic tape devices that store data. In SANs disk arrays are joined through a RAID, which makes a lot of hard disks look and perform like one big storage device. Every storage device, or even partition on that storage device, has a logical unit number (LUN) assigned to it. This is a unique number within the SAN and every node in the SAN, be it a server or another storage device, can access the storage through the LUN. The LUNs allow for the storage capacity of a SAN to be segmented and for the implementation of access controls. A particular server, or a group of servers, may, for example, be only given access to a particular part of the SAN storage layer, in the form of LUNs. When a storage device receives a request to read or write data, it will check its access list to establish whether the node, identified by its LUN, is allowed to access the storage area, also identified by a LUN. LUN masking is a technique whereby the host bus adapter and the SAN software of a server restrict the LUNs for which commands are accepted. In doing so LUNs that should in any case not be accessed by the server are masked. Another method to restrict server access to particular SAN storage devices is fabric-based access control, or zoning, which has to be implemented on the SAN networking devices and the servers. Thereby server access is restricted to storage devices that are in a particular SAN zone. == Network protocols == Most storage networks use the SCSI protocol for communication between servers and disk drive devices. A mapping layer to other protocols is used to form a network: * ATA over Ethernet (AoE), mapping of ATA over Ethernet * Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), the most prominent one, is a mapping of SCSI over Fibre Channel * Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) * ESCON over Fibre Channel (FICON), used by mainframe computers * HyperSCSI, mapping of SCSI over Ethernet * iFCP or SANoIP mapping of FCP over IP * iSCSI, mapping of SCSI over TCP/IP * iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER), mapping of iSCSI over InfiniBand * Network block device, mapping device node requests on UNIX-like systems over stream sockets like TCP/IP * SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP), another SCSI implementation for RDMA transports Storage networks may also be built using SAS and SATA technologies. SAS evolved from SCSI direct-attached storage. SATA evolved from IDE direct-attached storage. SAS and SATA devices can be networked using SAS Expanders. Examples of stacked protocols using SCSI: {    colspan=\\"7\\"  Applications -  colspan=\\"7\\"  SCSI Layer -  rowspan=\\"4\\"  FCP  rowspan=\\"3\\"  FCP  FCP  FCP  rowspan=\\"2\\"  iSCSI  rowspan=\\"2\\"  iSER  rowspan=\\"2\\"  SRP -  FCIP  iFCP -  colspan=\\"3\\"  TCP  colspan=\\"2\\"  RDMA Transport -  FCoE  colspan=\\"3\\"  IP  colspan=\\"2\\"  IP or InfiniBand Network -  FC  colspan=\\"4\\"  Ethernet  colspan=\\"2\\"  Ethernet or InfiniBand Link } == Software == A SAN is primarily defined as a special purpose network, the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) defines a SAN as \\"a network whose primary purpose is the transfer of data between computer systems and storage elements\\". But a SAN does not just consist of a communication infrastructure, it also has a software management layer. This software organizes the servers, storage devices, and the network so that data can be transferred and stored. Because a SAN is not a direct attached storage (DAS), the storage devices in the SAN are not owned and managed by a server. Potentially the data storage capacity that can be accessed by a single server through a SAN is infinite, and this storage capacity may also be accessible by other servers. Moreover, SAN software must ensure that data is directly moved between storage devices within the SAN, with minimal server intervention. SAN management software is installed on one or more servers and management clients on the storage devices. Two approaches have developed to SAN management software: in-band management means that management data between server and storage devices is transmitted on the same network as the storage data. While out-of-band management means that management data is transmitted over dedicated links. SAN management software will collect management data from all storage devices in the storage layer, including info on read and write failure, storage capacity bottlenecks and failure of storage devices. SAN management software may integrate with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). In 1999 an open standard was introduced for managing storage devices and provide interoperability, the Common Information Model (CIM). The web- based version of CIM is called Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) and defines SAN storage device objects and process transactions. Use of these protocols involves a CIM object manager (CIMOM), to manage objects and interactions, and allows for the central management of SAN storage devices. Basic device management for SANs can also be achieved through the Storage Management Interface Specification (SMI-S), were CIM objects and processes are registered in a directory. Software applications and subsystems can then draw on this directory. Management software applications are also available to configure SAN storage devices, allowing, for example, the configuration of zones and logical unit numbers (LUNs). Ultimately SAN networking and storage devices are available from many vendors. Every SAN vendor has its own management and configuration software. Common management in SANs that include devices from different vendors is only possible if vendors make the application programming interface (API) for their devices available to other vendors. In such cases, upper-level SAN management software can manage the SAN devices from other vendors. == Filesystems support == In a SAN data is transferred, stored and accessed on a block level. As such a SAN does not provide data file abstraction, only block-level storage and operations. But file systems have been developed to work with SAN software to provide file- level access. These are known as shared-disk file system (SAN file system). Server operating systems maintain their own file systems on their own dedicated, non-shared LUNs, as though they were local to themselves. If multiple systems were simply to attempt to share a LUN, these would interfere with each other and quickly corrupt the data. Any planned sharing of data on different computers within a LUN requires software, such as SAN file systems or clustered computing. == In media and entertainment == Video editing systems require very high data transfer rates and very low latency. SANs in media and entertainment are often referred to as serverless due to the nature of the configuration which places the video workflow (ingest, editing, playout) desktop clients directly on the SAN rather than attaching to servers. Control of data flow is managed by a distributed file system such as StorNext by Quantum. Per-node bandwidth usage control, sometimes referred to as quality of service (QoS), is especially important in video editing as it ensures fair and prioritized bandwidth usage across the network. == Quality of service == SAN Storage QoS enables the desired storage performance to be calculated and maintained for network customers accessing the device. Some factors that affect SAN QoS are: * Bandwidth The rate of data throughput available on the system. * Latency The time delay for a read/write operation to execute. * Queue depth The number of outstanding operations waiting to execute to the underlying disks (traditional or solid-state drives). QoS can be impacted in a SAN storage system by an unexpected increase in data traffic (usage spike) from one network user that can cause performance to decrease for other users on the same network. This can be known as the \\"noisy neighbor effect.\\" When QoS services are enabled in a SAN storage system, the \\"noisy neighbor effect\\" can be prevented and network storage performance can be accurately predicted. Using SAN storage QoS is in contrast to using disk over-provisioning in a SAN environment. Over-provisioning can be used to provide additional capacity to compensate for peak network traffic loads. However, where network loads are not predictable, over-provisioning can eventually cause all bandwidth to be fully consumed and latency to increase significantly resulting in SAN performance degradation. == Storage virtualization == Storage virtualization is the process of abstracting logical storage from physical storage. The physical storage resources are aggregated into storage pools, from which the logical storage is created. It presents to the user a logical space for data storage and transparently handles the process of mapping it to the physical location, a concept called location transparency. This is implemented in modern disk arrays, often using vendor-proprietary technology. However, the goal of storage virtualization is to group multiple disk arrays from different vendors, scattered over a network, into a single storage device. The single storage device can then be managed uniformly. == See also == * ATA over Ethernet (AoE) * Direct-attached storage (DAS) * Disk array * Fibre Channel * Fibre Channel over Ethernet * Host bus adapter (HBA) * iSCSI * iSCSI Extensions for RDMA * List of networked storage hardware platforms * List of storage area network management systems * Massive array of idle disks (MAID) * Network-attached storage (NAS) * Redundant array of independent disks (RAID) * SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) * Storage Management Initiative ‚Äì Specification (SMI-S) * Storage hypervisor * Storage resource management (SRM) * Storage virtualization * System area network == References  External links == * What Is a Storage Area Network (SAN)? * Introduction to Storage Area Networks Exhaustive Introduction into SAN, IBM Redbook * SAN vs. DAS: A Cost Analysis of Storage in the Enterprise * SAS and SATA, solid-state storage lower data center power consumption * SAN NAS Videos * Storage Area Network Info * 20 most promising enterprise storage solution providers of 2018 Category:Data management Category:Telecommunications engineering ","title":"Storage area network"},{"id":"20444616","text":"Vincent Michael Brown (3 December 1971) is an English artist and portrait painter. == Early life == Brown was born in Bristol in 1971.

Established in 1730, it is the city's oldest cemetery. Franklin Pierce, fourteenth president of the United States, is buried in the cemetery, as are his wife Jane and two of his three sons. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 9, 2008. (114 pages including site plans and 12 photos) The cemetery continues to accept new burials. ==Description and history== The Old North Cemetery is located north of modern downtown Concord, and a short way west of Concord's historic early town center. It is a roughly L-shaped property, about in size, bounded on the east by North State Street and the west by Bradley Street. Iron fencing lines both of these street-facing boundaries, with a gate flanked by stone piers on North State Street serving as the main pedestrian access point. Vehicular access is through an entrance at the northern end of the North State Street frontage, from which a paved lane extends straight westward to a secondary gate at Bradley Street. Concord was chartered in 1725, and settlement began soon afterward. The eastern portion of the cemetery was laid out in 1730, and its oldest dated burial occurred in 1736. Significant enlargements took place with the Minot Enclosure (1860), and the combining with an adjacent Quaker cemetery in the early 20th century.

The community of the Bah√° º√≠s begins in 1942 with the arrival of Dr. Malcolm King. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Jamaica, in Kingston, was elected in 1943. By 1957 the Bah√° º√≠s of Jamaica were organized under the regional National Spiritual Assembly of the Greater Antilles, and on the eve of national independence in 1962, the Jamaica Bah√° º√≠s elected their own National Spiritual Assembly in 1961. By 1981 hundreds of Bah√° º√≠s and hundreds more non-Bah√° º√≠s turned out for weekend meetings when R√∫h√≠yyih Kh√°num spent six days in Jamaica. Public recognition of the religion came in the form of the Governor General of Jamaica, Sir Howard Cooke, proclaiming a National Bah√° º√≠ Day first on July 25 in 2003 and it has been an annual event since. While there is evidence of several active communities by 2008 in Jamaica, estimates of the Bah√° º√≠s population range from the hundreds to the thousands. == Early phase ==  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919‚Äîafter the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Bah√° º√≠ community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unveiling in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. > His Christ Holiness says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world > and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.‚Ä¶(travel to) the Islands of the > West Indies, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Islands of the > Lesser Antilles, Bahama Islands, even the small Watling Island, have great > importance‚Ä¶ === Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades === Shoghi Effendi wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bah√° º√≠ Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s vision to begin. In his cable he wrote: > Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° > in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming > National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of > Bah√° º√≠ Era drawing to a close.

Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. > Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in > American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace > the light of the Faith of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and establish structural basis of His > World Order. Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bah√° º√≠ North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bah√° º√≠s to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937‚Äì44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bah√° º√≠s the goal of establishing the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bah√° º√≠s in Latin American, Bah√° º√≠ communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America. === Establishment === After a brief visit in 1939 by John and Rosa Shaw from San Francisco, the community of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Jamaica begins in 1942 with the arrival of Dr. Malcolm King - from Portland, Oregon, United States and of Jamaican background. King taught the religion to Marion Maxwell, the first Jamaican Bah√° º√≠ and William Mitchell (previously accountant for the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA) founded by Marcus Garvey). The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Jamaica, in Kingston, was elected in 1943. Mitchell was the Jamaican delegate to the Bah√° º√≠ All-America Convention called for by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, to be held in the United States May 17‚Äì24, 1944 on the centenary of the declaration of the B√°b. Mitchell in turn taught the religion to Julius Edwards, associated with Garvey and later pioneered to the area now called Ghana in 1953 and later in Liberia. There was also Eustace Whyte among the early Bah√° º√≠s of Jamaica who served as president of UNIA's Harmony Division in Kingston as well as elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Kingston. Garvey scholar Robert Hill gave a eulogy at one of Whyte's funeral services. == Growth == Jamaica parishes and townsFrom the early period of development the Bah√° º√≠ community in Jamaica grew in organization and in relationship with the wider community while growing internally as well. Before national independence, the Jamaicans were part of a regional National Spiritual Assembly of the Greater Antilles from 1957 through 1961 and on the eve of national independence in 1962, the Jamaica Bah√° º√≠s elected their own National Spiritual Assembly in 1961 with Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga representing the Bah√° º√≠ International Community. In 1963 there were Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies in 6 cities: Annatto Bay, Kingston, May Pen, Port Antonio, Spanish Town, and Yallahs and smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s in Bartons (St. Catherine), Crooked River, Montego Bay, and Porus. In 1963 the Bah√° º√≠s of the world looked to the election of the Universal House of Justice as the new head of the religion. The electors were the members of the national assemblies then in existence. The members of the Jamaican National Assembly who participated in the election were Miss Doris Maud Buchanan, Mr. Randolph Fitz-Henley, Miss Alice Maude Gallier, Mr. Wm. Arthur Wellesley Mitchell, Mr. Alfred Senior, Miss Emily Taylor, Miss Ruby Taylor, Mr. Clarence Ullrich, Mrs. Margarite Ullrich. Later the Universal House of Justice called for eight Oceanic and Continental Conferences and one was held in Kingston for the Caribbean region in May 1971. In 1981, just before the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Bah√° º√≠ community in Jamaica, Hand of the Cause R√∫h√≠yyih Kh√°num traveled throughout the Caribbean region and spent six days in Jamaica. She was received by the Governor General and Prime Minister while over two hundred Bah√° º√≠s attended a weekend conference and more non-Bah√° º√≠s attended a public meeting. A twenty-minute television interview as well as general coverage by radio and television reporters highlighted her visit. Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1985 the Bah√° º√≠ International Community canvassed the National Assemblies with a questionnaire - 77 of the 143 then existing assemblies responded. Jamaican responses highlighted a sense that women in Jamaica were taking on leadership positions on local assemblies. Former assistant to the dean of the school of engineering and applied science at Washington University in St. Louis, Naomi McCord, and her husband served as caretakers of the National Bah√° º√≠ Center in Kingston for a number of years. McCord willed more than 200 volumes from her personal library to the center. In a first step in relation to the general Jamaican community, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Jamaica was a founding member of the Jamaican Interfaith Council in 1992. == Modern community == The Bah√° º√≠s have participated in a number of activities of wider and local relevance to Jamaicans. In 2000 Bah√° º√≠s joined in observing the International Day of Peace with prayers called for by the Millennium World Peace Summit of religious leaders which met at the United Nations during August 28‚Äì31, and in 2002 Bah√° º√≠s participated in a national dialogue on transcending tribalistic boundaries present in politics. Governor General of Jamaica, Sir Howard Cooke, proclaimed a National Bah√° º√≠ Day first on July 25 in 2003 and it has been an annual event since. Among the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the first Jamaican local spiritual assembly after two weeks of events was a blood drive organized by the Bah√° º√≠s of Kingston. The festivities were also attended by retired Continental Counselor Ruth Pringle just two weeks before her death. In 2006 the Bah√° º√≠s of Port Antonio held a 4-day exhibition at the public library on the history of the Faith in Jamaica with the Bah√° º√≠ Day observance. The Bah√° º√≠ Centre in Kingston has hosted Sir Howard Cooke's Thursday Group which has continued to operate since Sir Cooke's retirement in 2006. In 2008 Bah√° º√≠ Dorothy Whyte was named the new executive director at the Women's Resource and Outreach Centre in Kingston.

After many hilarious antics, the truth is finally revealed and Zakia decides to buy a big house for all to move in. Meanwhile Moby falls in love with Marium (daughter of their tenant). After Moby's insistence, Zakia accepts his marriage with Marium. Jibran becomes friends with Faraz as he frequently comes to their house to see Sana.

The stripped down design aims to raise assurance of the host by removing the possibility of CPU privilege escalation and provide extremely tight control over CPU scheduling. With a traditional architecture, all hardware resources are owned by the real time operating system (RTOS). This controls the CPU cores, memory and peripherals. Applications must request access to those resources via APIs like fork(), malloc() and write(). The RTOS is a monolithic collection of libraries that manages task scheduling, memory partitioning and device I/O. This large block of code needs to be safety certified and bug free to be secure. A separation kernel relies on hardware virtualization functionality to do the heavy lifting. This creates efficient, tamper-proof, and non-bypassable virtual machines. Hardware resources are robustly partitioned into almost zero overhead VMs populated with a mix of OSes, RTOSes and bare-metal applications. Mixed criticality safety systems can be constructed that minimize high Design Assurance Levels (DAL) source lines of code (SLOC) counts to reduce certification costs and technical risks of future programs. LynxSecure supports paravirtualized Linux and LynxOS real-time operating systems, as well as full virtualization of the Windows operating system. It was also announced in 2020 that LynxSecure would support FreeRTOS, the market share leader in real-time operating systems, as a Guest OS. LynxSecure is built to conform to the MILS (Multiple Independent Levels of Security) architecture so that virtualization can be used in embedded systems with requirements for high assurance. By default, LynxSecure uses an ARINC 653-based fixed-cyclic scheduler to manage processing time, but dynamic scheduling policies are also permitted. Category:Free virtualization software ","title":"LynxSecure"},{"id":"20444993","text":"Longhorsley is a village in Northumberland, England about northwest of Morpeth, and about south of Alnwick. The A697 road passes through the village linking it with Morpeth, Wooler and Coldstream in Scotland. There are 8 \\"Streets\\" in Longhorsley: Whitegates, Church View, Drummonds Close, South Road, West Road, East Road and Reivers Gate, Wilding Place and (Davison Court within Wilding Place).The village is bordered on the north by the River Coquet. The village formerly lay in three separate townships: Bigges Quarter, Freeholders Quarter and Riddells Quarter. Local amenities at present include: St Helen's First School; Millar's Shop; Albion House Hairdressing; and The Shoulder of Mutton Pub. The population of Longhorsley Parish is approximately 800, measured at the 2011 Census as 887, and is essentially a residential community for those who work in South Northumberland and Tyneside. ==History== The village has a long history. In 1196 we find it referred to as Horsieg, a \\"woodland clearing where horses are kept\\" ‚Äì although it was a pretty tough place for a horse: one traveller, Eneas Mackenzie (1778‚Äì1832), described it in his view of Northumberland, as \\"the prolific source of contagious disorders incident to cattle and of little real use in its present state\\". Longhorsley Moor is high and bleak (in the winter of 1890 the mail-gig was blown over in a gale and the driver found with his neck broken). In the course of time the manor of Longhorsley was owned by the Gospatricks who gave it to the Merlays, and then it passed into the hands of the Horsleys and, later, to the great Catholic family, the Riddells. ==Governance== Longhorseley is in the electoral ward of Chevington with Longhorsley. This ward covers both East Chevington and Longhorsley plus their surrounding areas. The total population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 5,596. ==Landmarks== The Devil's Causeway passes the village less than to the west. The causeway is a Roman road which starts at Portgate on Hadrian's Wall, north of Corbridge, and extends northwards across Northumberland to the mouth of the River Tweed at Berwick-upon-Tweed. A hoard of Roman coins discovered by metal-detecting enthusiasts on a farm near Longhorsley, Northumberland, could be evidence that entrepreneurial native Northumbrian settlers were recycling old bronze coins and making trinkets to sell back to soldiers in the Roman army, according to experts. The hoard of 70 Roman coins ‚Äì 61 sestercii and 9 dupondii ‚Äî dates from the reign of Emperor Vespasian to the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (AD69‚Äì180). For part of this period, during the reign of Antoninus Pius, the Antonine Wall, built between Glasgow and Edinburgh, and not Hadrian's Wall, marked the northern frontier of the Roman Empire in Britain, and for a short period, Northumberland, which had until then been barbarian territory, became part of the Roman Empire. The hoard was found close to the route of the Devil's Causeway, the main Roman road which ran north through Northumberland. Roman expert Lindsay Allason- Jones, Director of Archaeological Museums at Newcastle University, where the coins were put on display, said: \\"What makes this find unusual is that it dates from a period when there was no Roman fort close to Longhorsley, although there were a number of native settlement sites in the area\\". Horsley Tower An ancient battlemented Peel tower lies on the western edge of Longhorsley, dating from the early 16th century and formerly belonging to the Horsley family of Brinkburn. Sir Thomas Horsley entertained General Monck here on his way south to effect the Restoration of Charles II. For a time the tower was used as a Roman Catholic chapel. It is now a private residence. Linden Hall was built in 1812 for Charles William Bigge, a member of one of Northumberland's most notable merchant and banking families. He had acquired the estate from the Earl of Carlisle, whose family had held it since the time of Henry I. His close friend, Sir Charles Monck, designed the mansion, which consisted of six large rooms on each floor, a sweeping staircase with a domed lantern above, and a basement in the main hall. In addition there were kitchens, servants' quarters, a schoolroom, a brew house, a slaughterhouse and stables. In 1861 it passed from the Bigge family into the hands of the Ames, who held it until 1904, when they moved to Ghyllheugh, their Victorian baronial-style house nearby. Linden Hall then passed to the Adamson family, until 1963. The Hall was purchased in 1978 from John Liddell and opened as a first class hotel three years later. ==Religious sites== St Thomas of Canterbury Church St Thomas of Canterbury interior The Anglican Church of St. Helen, which has registers dating from 1688. The Roman Catholic church, St Thomas of Canterbury, which was erected in 1841. Before the Catholic church was built, the parish was served from the pele tower which stands adjacent to the present church. ==Notable people== *Robert Towns (c.1794‚Äì1873), Australian businessman, pastoralist, and founder of Townsville, Queensland.Australian Dictionary of Biography: Robert Towns *John Pigdon, mayor of Melbourne from 1881‚Äì82. * Thomas Bell reputedly developed the world's first self-raising flour in Longhorsley village shop. Bell founded a wholesale grocery business near the Tyne Quays in Newcastle in the 1880s. One of his best-selling brands was a self-raising flour he called Bell's Royal. A common misconception is that Bell's Royal became Be-Ro because after the death of King Edward VII it became illegal to use the name Royal. In fact, it was because an American company, trading under the name of Royal's Baking Powder, was too similar to the Bell's Royal name that it was changed. The Be-Ro trade mark patent was filed in 1906 whereas King Edward VII died on 6 May 1910. The name Be-Ro, chosen by Thomas Bell's wife, had been in existence a decade before the trade mark was applied for, and registered, under the Trade Marks Act of 1905. *Emily Wilding Davison, one of Northumberland's most famous heroines lived in the village of Longhorsley. She is notable as the suffragette who was killed after throwing herself in front of the King's horse, Anmer in the Derby of 1913, while campaigning for women's right to vote. *C. P.

M.Azarnoush-Iranian archaeologist (2) He was born in Kermanshah. He received his MA from the department of archaeology at University of Tehran in 1972 and his PhD from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1985. After returning to Iran, he taught at the University of Tehran before taking up the direction of the Iranian Center for Archaeological Research. He had a fundamental role in reorganizing the ICAR in its new building in the Mas'udieh Palace. Azarnoush helped young archaeologists and students to join to the ICAR and participate in various archaeological research and activities. Although his career was historical archaeology, but he had a keen interest in developing research on the pre- and proto-history of Iran, especially Paleolithic studies. He emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary studies such as archaeobotany and zooarchaeology. Azarnoush welcomed international cooperation, and the series of rescue excavations in the Bulaghi gorge near Pasargadae in cooperation with teams from Germany, France, Poland has been one of the rare successes of archaeological fieldwork in Iran during the past 20 years. He excavated at important sites such as Kangavar, Hamadan, Susa, and Hajiabad where he found a Sassanian manor house at with stucco decorations, which served the basis for his doctoral dissertation and book. He was preparing a field project at the Parthian remains at Qaleh Yazdgird near Kermanshah. He re-investigated Tepe Hegmataneh in Hamadan. His excavations demonstrated that the actual remains date to the Parthian period at the earliest. Median Ecbatana should be sought elsewhere. He died of a heart attack on his return from the excavations at Hamadan at the age of 63.Ali Mousavi, Massoud Azarnoush, Iranica Antiqua, vol. 45, 2010 Masoud Azarnoush during excavation at Parthian-Sasanid site of Anahita Temple in Kagavar, 1971 ==Selected bibliography== *Azarnoush,M. 1987 Sassanian Art in Eastern Fars: The excavation of a manor house at Hajiabad, Darab, Iran, 346 P., Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Los Angeles. *Azarnoush,M. 1991 From Persepolis to al-Fustat: Continuation of Achaemenid Architectural Concepts, Proceedings of the Second European Conference of Iranian Studies.Held in Bamberg, 30 September - 4 October 1991.

Educated at Oakham School, he entered St John's College, Cambridge, where he held a fellowship from 1846 to 1859. He was vicar of Madingley, near Cambridge, from 1847 to 1852, and Queen's preacher at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, 1857. He occupied the position of a senior tutor in his college at the time he was elected in 1859 to the vicarage of Leeds. Atlay was appointed a canon of Ripon Cathedral in 1861. In 1867, he refused the bishopric of Calcutta, but in the following year accepted the bishopric of Hereford, in succession to Renn Hampden. He possessed great organising ability and an attractive personality and was described by Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, as \\"the most beautiful combination of enthusiasm, manliness and modesty.\\" ==Family== He married in 1859 Frances Turner, younger daughter of William Martin, a major of the Bengal Army.

Loader (born 1958) is currently Co-Director of the Centre for Political Youth Culture and Communication (CPAC) at the University of York, UK. Brian joined the Department of Sociology at York in January 2006 to pursue his scholarly interests into digital media communication and democratic governance. His overarching interest is in new media communications technologies, and the social, political and economic factors shaping their development and diffusion, and their implications for social, economic, political and cultural change. He has published widely in these areas and is the founding Editor of the international journal Information, Communication and Society whose aim and scope is to critically explore these issues in depth.http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rics20/current#.UdKrQ_msh8E Brian's interest in the transforming capacities of Internet began in the mid-1990s primarily as a critical response to two discourses that continue to frame discussions about the socio-political influence of new media technologies to this day. The first, addressed in his book The Governance of Cyberspace (1997), highlighted and criticised the ‚Äòcyber-libertarian‚Äô portrayals of the Internet as emancipatory spaces divorced from the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô of power, place, history and political economy. The second, and related concern, outlined in The Cyberspace Divide (1998) was the crucial issue of what impact the Internet would have upon different social groups. These two themes have continued to shape his research interest in how social relations of power are increasingly mediated through information and communication technologies. ==Community informatics== In 1996 he was responsible for establishing and directing the Community Informatics Research and Applications Unit (CIRA) which attempted to explore the potential of new media for shaping the development, sustainability and even regeneration of community relations. What he described as community informatics was from the outset concerned with the relationship between geographical places where people lived, worked and socialized and the networked spaces provided by the Internet. Publications such as Community Informatics: Shaping Computer-Mediated Social Networks (2001) and Challenging the Digital Divide? A literature Review of Community Informatics Initiatives (2004) documented both the potential of new media for community development and also the wider role it played in the fragmentation and individualization of local social relations. Active research projects, including Trimdon Digital Village informed UK policy debates about bridging the digital divide. Brian continues to be a member of the editorial board for the Journal of Community Informatics. During his time at CIRA Brian together with colleagues at Teesside and worldwide attempted to explore the potential of new media for shaping the development, sustainability and even regeneration of community relations. What they described as community informatics was from the outset concerned with the relationship between geographical places where people lived, worked and socialized and the networked spaces provided by the Internet. ==Young citizens== On arriving at York Brian focused upon the potential of social media to influence the political and civic engagement of young citizens. First, by hosting a small symposium which was later published in an edited collection as Young Citizens In the Digital Age (2007) and then by establishing in partnership with Lance Bennett a study group called Networking Young Citizens under the auspices of the World Universities Network. Together with Ariadne Vromen and Mike Xenos, he is undertaking a three country comparative study of the potential influence of social media upon the participatory culture of young citizens entitled The Civic Network which is funded by the Spencer Foundation. ==Recent work== Research interest in the broader impact of new media upon democratic governance began with the publication of Digital Democracy: Discourse and Decision-Making in the Information Age (1999) following the first of several conferences devoted to this issue. The use of new media by social movements was first explored in Cyberprotest: New Media, Citizens and Social Movements (2004) with other European colleagues collaborating on a COST programme. Most recently, it was the focus of a conference on Networking Democracy held in Cluj, Romania where these themes were further developed in Social Media and Democracy: social media innovations in participatory politics (2012). The potential for new media to shape practices of social care both organisationally and individually has been a longstanding research area. He has been particularly interested in the use of ICTs in re-structuring health and social care organizations and professional practices. With colleagues on an ESRC funded project on Virtual Community Care the use of the Internet as a potential means of online social support revealed the effectiveness of social networking amongst informed participants for facilitating social support. It further foregrounded how such technologies could transform relations between professionals and clients. Digital Welfare for the Third Age (2009) developed these ideas on the basis of a UK Department of Health funded project into electronic service delivery for older people. Brian‚Äôs wider interest in social media and the Internet is facilitated through his editorship of the international journal Information, Communication & Society (iCS). Included in the prestigious Thompson Reuters Social Science Citation Index iCS is published in twelve issues annually. This comprises several special issues including the best papers from both the annual conference of the Association of Internet Researchers and the American Sociological Association section on Communication and Information Technologies. Under Brian‚Äôs editorship iCS also hosts regular conferences around the world on a range of topics related to the social, cultural, political and economic influence of new media communications technologies. The most recent were A Decade in Internet Time at Balliol College, Oxford, and at York on The Co-Production of Knowledge. ==Books== The Networked Young Citizen: social media, political participation and civic engagement, (edited with Ariadne Vromen and Mike Xenos), New York: Routledge.

He made his debut for the Cherries on 9 August, coming on in added time for Marc Pugh as they began the season with a 4‚Äì0 win at Huddersfield Town. A week later, six minutes after coming off the bench, he finished Ryan Fraser's cross for the only goal at Dean Court against Brentford; this was his only goal in 13 appearances as Bournemouth won the title, earning their first promotion to the Premier League. On 3 January 2015, in the third round of the FA Cup, Stanislas put Bournemouth in the lead as they came from behind to win 5‚Äì1 at Rotherham United. On 25 August 2015, Stanislas scored in each half as Bournemouth defeated Hartlepool United 4‚Äì0 at the Victoria Ground in the second round of the League Cup. His first Premier League goals for the club came on 28 November, two late strikes to seal a 3‚Äì3 home draw against Everton. Two weeks later, Stanislas opened the scoring in the second minute of an eventual 2‚Äì1 win over Manchester United, netting directly from a corner kick. ==International career== Stanislas has been capped for England at under-19, under-20 and under-21 level. He was called up to the England U19 squad for the first time in November 2007, along with West Ham teammate, James Tomkins, for a friendly against Germany. His second call- up came in February 2008, for a friendly against Croatia at the County Ground, Swindon. On 31 March 2009, he made his debut for the England U20's in a 2‚Äì0 win over Italy, coming on as a substitute for Scott Sinclair in a friendly at Loftus Road. He received his first call-up to the England U21 side for a friendly against the Netherlands on 11 August 2009 and made his debut starting in the 0‚Äì0 draw. In September 2009, Stuart Pearce then named him in the squad for the 2011 European Championship qualifiers against Macedonia and Greece. His final appearance for the team on 4 September, in the 2‚Äì1 victory over Macedonia, before being an unused substitute in the 1‚Äì1 draw with Greece four days later. He is eligible to play for the Saint Lucia national team through his father, Felix. He said \\"I'm half St Lucian so I could play internationals for them if I wanted... but I don't.\\"FourFourTwo Magazine. November 2009 edition. p. 34 ==Personal life== Stanislas went to Catholic school as a child and Crown Woods School in Eltham in his teens. He remains a devout Christian today. His favourite stadium to play at is Old Trafford. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !DivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoals -  rowspan=\\"5\\"West Ham United 2008‚Äì09 Premier League 92colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî00colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî92 - 2009‚Äì10 Premier League 2621012colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî284 - 2010‚Äì11 Premier League 610020colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî81 - 2011‚Äì12 Championship 10colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî11colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî21 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !4251043colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî478 - Southend United (loan) 2008‚Äì09 League One 6132colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî93 -  rowspan=\\"4\\"Burnley 2011‚Äì12 Championship 31010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî320 - 2012‚Äì13 Championship 3550020colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî375 - 2013‚Äì14 Championship 2721041colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî323 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !9372061colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî1018 -  rowspan=\\"7\\" AFC Bournemouth 2014‚Äì15 Championship 1312150colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî202 - 2015‚Äì16 Premier League 2131032colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî255 - 2016‚Äì17 Premier League 2170010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî227 - 2017‚Äì18 Premier League 1950010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî205 - 2018‚Äì19 Premier League 2321032colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî274 - 2019‚Äì20 Premier League 15 3 1 0 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 16 3 - 2020‚Äì21 Championship 200000colspan=2‚Äî20 - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Total !1142151134 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî13228 - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Career total !24934113238 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî28945 } ==Honours== AFC Bournemouth *Football League Championship: 2014‚Äì15 ==References * *Premier League profile Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Greenwich Category:English footballers Category:England youth international footballers Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Southend United F.C. players Category:Burnley F.C. players Category:AFC Bournemouth players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Black English sportspeople Category:English people of Saint Lucian descent Category:English Christians ","title":"Junior Stanislas"},{"id":"20445242","text":"Bret Hall is an American soccer coach and former professional player who played in the NASL, Major Indoor Soccer League and National Professional Soccer League.

Other mechanisms for astrocytic potassium clearance are carrier-operated or channel-operated potassium chloride uptake.Walz W (2000): Role of astrocytes in the clearance of excess extracellular potassium. Neurochemistry International The repolarization of neurons tends to raise potassium concentration in the extracellular fluid. If a significant rise occurs, it will interfere with neuronal signaling by depolarizing neurons. Astrocytes have large numbers of potassium ion channels facilitating removal of potassium ions from the extracellular fluid. They are taken up at one region of the astrocyte and then distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, and further to its neighbors via gap junctions. This keeps extracellular potassium at levels that prevent interference with normal propagation of an action potential. ==Potassium spatial buffering== Glial cells, once believed to have a passive role in CNS, are active regulators of numerous functions in the brain, including clearance of the neurotransmitter from the synapses, guidance during neuronal migration, control of neuronal synaptic transmission, and maintaining ideal ionic environment for active communications between neurons in central nervous system.Kozoriz, M. G., D. C. Bates, et al. (2006). \\"Passing potassium with and without gap junctions.\\" Journal of Neuroscience 26(31): 8023-8024. Neurons are surrounded by extracellular fluid rich in sodium ions and poor in potassium ions. The concentrations of these ions are reversed inside the cells. Due to the difference in concentration, there is a chemical gradient across the cell membrane, which leads to sodium influx and potassium efflux. When the action potential takes place, a considerable change in extracellular potassium concentration occurs due to the limited volume of the CNS extracellular space. The change in potassium concentration in the extracellular space impacts a variety of neuronal processes, such as maintenance of membrane potential, activation and inactivation of voltage gated channels, synaptic transmission, and electrogenic transport of neurotransmitter. Change of extracellular potassium concentration of from 3mM can affect neural activity. Therefore, there are diverse cellular mechanisms for tight control of potassium ions, the most widely accepted mechanisms being K+ spatial buffering mechanism. Orkand and his colleagues who first theorized spatial buffering stated ‚Äúif a Glial cell becomes depolarized by K+ that has accumulated in the clefts, the resulting current carries K+ inward in the high [K+] region and out again, through electrically coupled Glial cells in low [K+] regions‚Äù In the model presented by Orkand and his colleagues, glial cells intake and traverse potassium ions from region of high concentrations to region of low concentration maintaining potassium concentration to be low in extracellular space. Glial cells are well suited for transportation of potassium ions since it has unusually high permeability to potassium ions and traverse long distance by its elongated shape or by being coupled to one another.Chen, K. C. and C. Nicholson (2000). \\"Spatial buffering of potassium ions in brain extracellular space.\\" Biophysical Journal 78(6): 2776-2797.Xiong, Z. Q. and F. L. Stringer (2000). \\"Sodium pump activity, not glial spatial buffering, clears potassium after epileptiform activity induced in the dentate gyrus.\\" Journal of Neurophysiology 83(3): 1443-1451. ===Potassium regulatory mechanisms=== Potassium buffering can be broadly categorized into two categories: Potassium uptake and Potassium spatial buffering. For potassium uptake, excess potassium ions are temporarily taken into glial cells through transporters, or potassium channels. In order to preserve electroneutrality, potassium influxes into glial cells are accompanied by influx of chlorine or efflux of sodium. It is expected that when potassium accumulates within glial cells, water influx and swelling occurs. For potassium spatial buffering, functionally coupled glial cells with high potassium permeability transfer potassium ions from regions of elevated potassium concentration to regions of lower potassium concentration. The potassium current is driven by the difference in glial syncytium membrane potential and local potassium equilibrium potential. When one region of potassium concentration increases, there is a net driving force causing potassium to flow into the glial cells. The entry of potassium causes a local depolarization that propagates electrotonically through the glial cell network which causes net driving force of potassium out of the glial cells. This process causes dispersion of local potassium with little net gain of potassium ions within the glial cells, which in turn prevents swelling. Glial cell depolarization caused by neuronal activity releases potassium onto blood stream, which was once widely hypothesized to be cause of vessel relaxation, was found to have little effect on neurovascular coupling.Metea, M. R., P. Kofuji, et al. (2007). \\"Neurovascular coupling is not mediated by potassium siphoning from glial cells.\\" Journal of Neuroscience 27(10): 2468-2471. Despite the efficiency of potassium spatial buffering mechanisms, in certain regions of CNS, potassium buffering seems more dependent on active uptake mechanisms rather than spatial buffering. Therefore, the exact role of glial potassium spatial buffering in the various regions of our brain still remains uncertain.Kofuji, P. and E. A. Newman (2004). \\"Potassium buffering in the central nervous system.\\" Neuroscience 129(4): 1045-1056. ===Kir channel=== The high permeability of glial cell membranes to potassium ions is a result of expression of high densities of potassium-selective channels with high open- probability at resting membrane potentials. Kir channels, potassium inward- rectifying channels, allow passage of potassium ions inward much more readily than outward. They also display a variable conductance that positively correlates with extracellular potassium concentration: the higher the potassium concentration outside the cell, the higher the conductance. Kir channels are categorized into seven major subfamilies, Kir1 to Kir7, with a variety of gating mechanisms. Kir3 and Kir6 are primarily activated by intracellular G-proteins. Because they have a relatively low open-probability compared to the other families, they have little impact on potassium buffering. Kir1 and Kir7 are mainly expressed in epithelial cells, such as those in kidney, choroid plexus, or retinal pigment epithelium, and have no impact on spatial buffering. Kir2, however, are expressed in brain neurons and glial cells. Kir4 and Kir5 are, along with Kir2, located in Muller glia and play important roles in potassium siphoning. There are some discrepancies among studies on expression of these channels in the stated locations.Kofuji, P. and N. C. Connors (2003). \\"Molecular substrates of potassium spatial buffering in glial cells.\\" Molecular Neurobiology 28(2): 195-208.Solessio, E., K. Rapp, et al. (2001). \\"Spermine mediates inward rectification in potassium channels of turtle retinal Muller cells.\\" Journal of Neurophysiology 85(4): 1357-1367. ===Panglial syncytium=== The panglial syncytium is a large network of interconnected glial cells, which are extensively linked by gap junctions. The panglial syncytium spreads through central nervous system where it provides metabolic and osmotic support, as well as ionic regulation of myelinated axons in white matter tracts. The three types of macroglial cells within network of panglial syncytium are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymocytes. Originally it was believed that there was homologous gap junction between oligodendrocytes. It was later found through untrastructural analysis that gap junctions do not directly link adjacent oligodendrocytes, rather it gap junctions with adjacent astrocytes, providing secondary pathway to nearby oligodendrocytes. With direct gap junction between myelin sheaths to surrounding astrocytes, excess potassium and osmotic water directly enters astrocyte syncytium, where it downstream to astrocyte endfeet at capillaries and the glia limitans. Rash, J. E. (2010). \\"Molecular Disruptions of the Panglial Syncytium Block Potassium Siphoning and Axonal Saltatory Conduction: Pertinence to Neuromyelitis Optica and Other Demyelinating Diseases of the Central Nervous System.\\" Neuroscience 168(4): 982-1008. ==Potassium siphoning== Potassium spatial buffering that occurs in the retina is called potassium siphoning, where the Muller cell is the principal glial cell type. Muller cells have important role in retinal physiology. It maintains retinal cell metabolism and are critical in maintaining potassium homeostasis in extracellular space during neuronal activity. Like cells responsible for spatial buffering, Muller cells are distinctively permeable to potassium ions through Kir channels. Like other glial cells, the high selectivity of Muller cell membranes to potassium ions is due to the high density of Kir channels. Potassium conductance is unevenly distributed in Muller cells.Brew, H. and D. Attwell (1985). \\"Is the Potassium Channel Distribution in Glial-Cells Optimal for Spatial Buffering of Potassium.\\" Biophysical Journal 48(5): 843-847. By focally increasing potassium ions along amphibian Muller cells and recording the resulting depolarization, the observed potassium conductance was concentrated in the endfoot process of 94% of the total potassium conductance localized to the small subcellular domain. The observation lead to hypothesis that excess potassium in extracellular space is ‚Äúsiphoned‚Äù by the Muller cells to the vitreous humor. Potassium siphoning is a specialized form of spatial buffering mechanisms where large reservoir of potassium ions is emptied into vitreous humor. Similar distribution pattern of Kir channels could be found in amphibians.Karwoski, C. J., H. K. Lu, et al. (1989). \\"Spatial Buffering of Light-Evoked Potassium Increases by Retinal Muller (Glial) Cells.\\" Science 244(4904): 578-580.Newman, E. A., D. A. Frambach, et al. (1984). \\"Control of Extracellular Potassium Levels by Retinal Glial-Cell K+ Siphoning.\\" Science 225(4667): 1174-1175.Winter, M., W. Eberhardt, et al. (2000). \\"Failure of potassium siphoning by Muller cells: A new hypothesis of perfluorocarbon liquid-induced retinopathy.\\" Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science 41(1): 256-261. ==History== Existence of potassium siphoning was first reported in 1966 study by Orkand et al. In the study, optic nerve of Necturus was dissected to document the long-distance movement of potassium after the nerve stimulation. Following the low frequency stimulation of .5 Hz at the retinal end of the dissected optic nerve, depolarization 1-2mV was measured at astrocytes at the opposite end of the nerve bundle, which was up to several millimeters from the electrode. With higher frequency stimulation, higher plateau of depolarization was observed. Therefore, they hypothesized that the potassium released to extracellular compartment during axonal activity entered and depolarized nearby astrocytes, where it was transported away by unfamiliar mechanism, which caused depolarization on astrocytes distant from site of stimulation. The proposed model was actually inappropriate since at the time neither gap junctions nor syncytium among glial cells were known, and optic nerve of Necturus are unmyelinated, which means that potassium efflux occurred directly into the periaxonal extracellular space, where potassium ions in extracellular space would be directly absorbed into the abundant astrocytes around axons.Kofuji, P. and E. A. Newman (2004). \\"Potassium buffering in the central nervous system.\\" Neuroscience 129(4): 1045-1056. ==Diseases== In patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), abnormalities occur in astrocyte, which leads to pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction in this disease. TSC is a multisystem genetic disease with mutation in either TSC1 or TSC2 gene. It results in disabling neurological symptoms such as mental retardation, autism, and seizures. Glial cells have important physiological roles of regulating neuronal excitability and preventing epilepsy. Astrocytes maintain homeostasis of excitatory substances, such as extracellular potassium, by immediate uptake through specific potassium channels and sodium potassium pumps. It is also regulated by potassium spatial buffering via astrocyte networks where astrocytes are coupled through gap junctions. Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 gene often results in decreased expression of the astrocytic connexin protein, Cx43.Xu, L., L. H. Zeng, et al. (2009). \\"Impaired astrocytic gap junction coupling and potassium buffering in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex.\\" Neurobiology of Disease 34(2): 291-299. With impairment in gap junction coupling between astrocytes, myriad of abnormalities in potassium buffering occurs which results in increased extracellular potassium concentration and may predispose to neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. According to a study done on animal model, connexin43-deficient mice showed decreased threshold for the generation of epileptiform events. The study also demonstrated role of gap junction in accelerating potassium clearance, limiting potassium accumulation during neuronal firing, and relocating potassium concentrations.Wallraff, A., R. Kohling, et al. (2006). \\"The impact of astrocytic gap junctional coupling on potassium buffering in the hippocampus.\\" Journal of Neuroscience 26(20): 5438-5447. Demyelinating Diseases of the central nervous system, such as Neuromyelitis Optica, often leads to molecular components of the panglial syncytium being compromised, which leads to blocking of potassium spatial buffering. Without mechanism of potassium buffering, potassium induced osmotic swelling of myelin occurs where myelins are destroyed and axonal salutatory conduction ceases.Rash, J. E.

The vote was sparked by complaints of noise generated by the airport. However, the vote focused community attention on the shortage of playgrounds and parks in the city. The local Lions Club pushed the previously rejected idea of the City accepting a donation of 20 acres of swampy land at the intersection of Main Street and South Street from Cephas Rogers. Rogers was a local industrialist who was hard hit by the Depression. The donation would be made for forgiveness of his $6,000 tax debt. The Common Council accepted the offer, and applied to the WPA for funds to drain the land and build access roads and athletic facilities. 200 workers began work in 1937. The project was finished in mid-1940 at a cost of about $175,000, $30,000 of which the City paid. Cephas B. Rogers Park opened in the spring of 1941. Over the years, the City acquired additional acreage to increase the size of the park. The War Memorial, a community center that also houses a gymnasium, opened in Rogers Park in 1951, along with Memorial Drive, the road through the middle of the park. The Charles Ives House was moved to Rogers Park in 1967 from its original site on Main Street. ==Baseball== Rogers Park hosts a baseball venue that consists of six fields: Fields 1, 2, 3 and 4 (which have 60 foot base paths) and Mountainville and Rogers Park Fields (which have 90 foot base paths). Rogers Park Field has been home to the Danbury Westerners of the New England Collegiate Baseball League since 1995.http://www.danburywesterners.com/directions-to-westerners.php Danbury Westerners directions page, URL accessed November 28, 2008 The first baseball field was built at Rogers Park in the early 1960s.

It is among the notable public premier law school in Malaysia. The current Dean of the faculty is Dr. Hartini Saripan, who assumed the role in 2018. The faculty currently consists of some 100 academic staff. It has about 1,144 students studying pre-law, BLS (Hons) and LL.B (Hons). ==History== Faculty of LawThe Faculty of Law was founded in 1968. It was formerly known as the Faculty of Administration and Law and before as the School of Administration and Law. It began as a centre offering British external programmes, namely the LL.B(Hons) University of London and the Chartered Institute of Secretaries (now Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators). The only internal programme offered then was the Diploma in Public Administration and Local Government. UiTM's Moot Court IOn 14 January 2004, the Faculty of Administration and Law have been separated to two faculties namely the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Administrative Science and Policy Studies. ==ProgrammesUndergraduate=== In 1978, the LL.B (Hons) University of London programme was discontinued and replaced by the Diploma in Law (DIL) programme. The DIL programme is equivalent to the LL.B programme offered in British Universities. It is a three-year academic programme based on the structure of British Universities undergraduate law programmes. Unlike most of the British programmes however, the DIL programme at the faculty is conducted on a semester system. Soon after, the faculty had renamed its programmes and DIL was renamed as the LL.B (general law degree). The LL.B programme, however, was postgraduate programmes (PhD and LL.M. programmes). replaced with the Bachelor of Legal Studies (Hons) or BLS (Hons), which was introduced in 2002. In 1982, the Faculty introduced a one-year Advanced Diploma in Law (ADIL) programme for graduates of the DIL programme. The ADIL programme is equivalent to a LL.B (Hons) degree and recognised for legal practice. It is a simulatory programme designed to provide professional training for students in preparation for their career in the legal practice as Advocates and Solicitors. ADIL then became the LL.B (Hons). This LL.B (Hons) programme is unique in which it was designed after the Inns of Court in England. The students are put in a simulated legal office environment in which they are designated in firms and given case studies. The BLS (Hons) programme was discontinued by the Faculty in the recent years. Currently, the Faculty is only offering the four-years LL.B (Hons) programme for undergraduate while still maintaining the Final-year as the professional training-course. Graduates of this programme are eligible to practice as Deputy Public Prosecutors, Federal Counsels, Parliamentary Draftsmen in the Attorney General's Chambers (AGC), or Judicial Legal Services (JLS) as Magistrates, Arbitrators and also be admitted as Advocates and Solicitors. ===Postgraduates=== For postgraduates, the faculty offered three (3) programmes which are master in laws (LL.M), PhD in law and diploma in Syariah law and practice (DLSA). DLSA is a professional programme designed to train those who are interested in practising in the Syariah Courts and those who want to be Syarie lawyers. Apart from providing hands-on training to students, this programme intends to expose students to several aspects of Syariah Law. It also aims to enhance their knowledge in the different procedures (mal) practiced in the Syariah Courts as opposed to the civil courts. Furthermore, students will be trained in matters pertaining to Syariah trial and advocacy. The graduate of DLSA is eligible to undertake examination in order to be admitted as a Shariah practitioner according to the state in Malaysia.https://law.uitm.edu.my/v4/index.php/programmes/postgraduate/dlsa For LL.M programme, the Faculty offered both coursework and research-based Masters programme. Among the area of law offered such as Intellectual Property (IP) law, Corporate Law, Legal Aspect of Marine Affairs, Public & Public Interest Law, Commercial Law. The Faculty are also offering the Master programme for non-law graduate such as Master in Legal Studies and Master of Laws (Enforcement Law). The student of a Master programme will be supervised by senior lecturers and professors of the Faculty.https://law.uitm.edu.my/v4/index.php/programmes/postgraduate/masters The PhD programme intends to train candidates to develop some conceptual and analytical capabilities in the field of law through a rigorous examination of an original study to be conducted under the supervision of a supervisor from the faculty. The areas of research among others, such as Constitutional Law, Public International Law, Intellectual Property law, Maritime and Shipping law, Criminology and Criminal Justice, Islamic Criminal Law, Comparative Corporate Law, Environmental Law. The Faculty allowed the admission for international applicant.https://law.uitm.edu.my/v4/index.php/programmes/postgraduate/phd# ===Reference to the Common Bar Course (CBC)=== Early in March 2011, the Attorney-General announced that the Legal Qualifying Board was considering implementing the Common Bar Course (CBC). Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abdul Wahab Patail is chairing a working group to study its implementation. The CBC would be a 20-month course that would also focus on vocational skills. The CBC model combines the modern legal education approaches in other Commonwealth countries as well as local requirements. There will be modules not commonly seen in other courses to meet specific needs among local graduates, such as the Legal Language and Communication Skills to address the poor command of English and the Practice Management Skills to expose lawyers intending to start their own firm on risk management. Of the five semesters, the first three are full-time studies while the final two are part-time, where students will be pupils at law firms concurrently. It will also feature a Student Law Office programme where the \\"students-at-law\\" will get to practice what they have learned in a simulated legal environment, which has been successfully carried out in UiTM Faculty of Law. ==Research and PublicationUiTM Law Review=== As a reputable public law school in Malaysia, the Faculty has also published a law journal known as UiTM Law Review. UiTM Law Review is a learned journal of the Faculty of Law, UiTM with its inaugural issue in 2001. It reflects the institution's maturity and ability to manage and conduct its specialist discipline. The journal functions also as a meeting point for law teachers and practitioners who share a common interest in various areas of law. It provides them a source of information on the current and topical issues in their specialised areas. It creates a forum for the exchange of ideas and for engaging in discourse over sometimes intricate and often vexed legal issues.https://law.uitm.edu.my/v4/index.php/research- publications/23-uitm-law-review The journal is widely recognised in legal fraternity in Malaysia, with various private practitioner, law teachers, former judges and senior Member of the Bar are also participate in contributing to the law journal. As such, the recognition that was gained from peers, both within and without the discipline, will speak for their standing and credibility in the community, both scholarly and otherwise. Thus, this journal has served as one channel for the faculty members and other contributors to reach that wider audience. The Editors of the law journal are consists of a notable person in the legal fraternity, locally and internationally in which among others are Prof Dato' Dr Rahmat Mohamad, Prof Dr Gonzalo Villalta Puig (The Chinese University of Hong Kong), Assoc Prof Dr Karen Bubna-Litic (University of South Australia). ==Controversy== In 2007, former Dean, Khalid Yusoff, was jailed three months for forgery and cheating in the July 2001 Certificate in Legal Practice examination \\"master list\\".http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/8/1/nation/18461427&sec;=nation In May 2010, he was freed by the Court of Appeal.http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/5/28/courts/6353135&sec;=courts ==Notable staff== *Emeritus Professor.

He was the first Sufi to go into the completely non-Muslim locality of Gaya and spread Islam.Syed Muhammad Sabahuddin Monami, (2000), \\"Zikr-e-Ata\\", the precise biography of Shah-e-Ata, \\"Maktaba-e-Ataiya\\". p. 4 He was also a writer, poet, linguist, and orator. He died as the Ghaus, which is the highest degree of spirituality a Sufi could attain in his time. == Biography == Fani was born in 1816 into a pious family of saints of the Chisti Order at the home of his maternal grandfather, Khanqah Qadria Mannania, in Patna City, Bihar, India. He was raised by his father Sultan Ahmed Shaheed until he was 10 years old. After his father's death, his paternal grandfather Ghulam Hussain Danapuri raised him before dying at the age of 86, 9 years after being made the successor of the ancestral Khanqah. After his grandfather's death, Fani was nurtured by his maternal uncle Meer Qamruddin Husain Monami, with whom completed his worldly studies and spiritual teachings. Fani was awarded Khilafat-o-Ijazat (Ijazah) by him upon completion. === Ancestral history === Fani was born into a famous Syed family in Bihar: he was the descendant of Syedna Imam Muhammad al-Baqir. After the death of al-Baqir, his son Jafar al- Sadiq became the imam of the Muslim community. == Final settlement == Fani travelled to Mecca by foot when he was 28. The journey took a total of 5 years. He was allegedly ordered by Muhammad spiritually to go back to India to spread Islam and accept the responsibility as a Qutub of Gaya where he lived, died, and was buried. He reached Gaya in 1850 and arrived at the house of the district judge of Gaya, Syed Ashraf Hussain Sadrus Sudoor (who had already been shown the face of Shah-e-Ata in dreams and was told to welcome him wholeheartedly).Ata Hussain Fani, (1930). \\"Kaifya-tul-Aarfeen Nisbatul Aasheqeen\\", \\"Al Maktab-e-Monamia\\". p. 370 == Spiritual history == He had ijaza of approximately seventy of the major orders of the world, including the famous orders of eastern India. He had orders from the fourteen major orders leading to Muhammad by all the major branches of the respective orders. He was originally in the Chistia Khizria Monamia order and completed his Sulook in Abulolaiya order from his uncle Syed Shah Qamruddin Monami. He also had great spiritual connections with Mohiuddin Abdul Qadir Jilani, Baba Fariduddin Ganjshakar, Nizamuddin Auliya and Sharfuddin Yahya Maneri. == Titles given == The most important of all the titles given to him is Abdul Razzaq by Muhammad when he went to Medina and was produced in front of Muhammad's court. Other titles are: *Shah-e-Ata *Qutb-e-Gaya *Murshid-e-Aala *Sarkar-e-Ata *Hazrat-e- Fani == Descendants == Fani married a descendant of Maqdum-e-Jahan Syed Sharfuddin Yahya of Bihar Sharif. He had three children: one son and two daughters out of which only two carried the lineage forward. His son is remembered as Syed Shah Ghulam Qutubuddin Chishti. The succession of the Sajjada of his ancestral Khanqah has always been in his son's descendants. Only his son had the authority to offer the duties of the Sajjada nashin in his absence. Shah Qutubuddin Chishti was Fani's grandson. When he died his son became Fani's successor and since then the Sajjada nashin remained with the descendants of Shah Qutubuddin. === Syed Shah Ghulam Qutubuddin Chishti === He was the only son of Fani and was born in 1838. He became a murid of his father in the Chishti Order. He lived wholly in the company of his father and he gained all his education from him, enlightenment included. It was a culture among the pandas (a caste amongst Hindus who perform a type of worship for the peace of the soul of the dead) that a devotee gave them a horse or any animal to them after they perform the worship for the peace of their relatives' soul. He died in 1887 at the age of 49 and was survived by a son. === Syed Shah Nezamuddin Chishti Monami === He was the only child of Shah Qutubuddin. He was born in 1860. He wanted to become the murid of his paternal grandfather, Fani, but Fani ordered him to become a murid of his father instead. He had Khilafat (Ijazah) of all orders from both his father and grandfather. He attended Bankipur Engineering College at Patna and received a degree. Like his grandfather he was well-versed in all fields of education ranging from theology, history, Fiqh, engineering, Tib (Medical Science), Tassawwuf and jurisprudence. He became Fani's successor after the latter's death in 1889. After becoming the Sajjada nashin he went to the dargah of Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer to pay his homage before starting a new chapter of his life as the Sajjada nashin of the ancestral Khanqah founded by Tajuddin delhvi, the murid and khalifa of Moinuddin Chishti. He died in 1904 at the age of 44. His first marriage was to the daughter of Shah Enayat Ali Maudidi, a descendant of Maudood Chishti, and he had a son named Syed Shah Hussainuddin Safi who became his successor. His second marriage was to the daughter of Akbar Danapuri-a great Abulolai Sufi, and had three more sons: Hafiz Hakeem Syed Shah Qayamuddin, Syed Shah Hesamuddin Chishti and Syed Shah Ehteshamuddin Chishti, as well as one daughter. Two of his sons, Shah Qayamuddin and Shah Ehteshamuddin, died in their youth. His daughter also died without bearing any sons to carry on his lineage. He was buried in his ancestral home at Danapur, Patna near the grave of his ancestors Syed-ul-Waseleen and Syed-ul-Majzubeen. === Shah Hussainuddin Safi === He was known as Syed Shah Hussainuddin Safi Chishti. He was the eldest son of Shah Nezamuddin Chishti. He was born in 1303 of the Islamic calendar. His initial education was completed in his maternal home at Sheikhpura. He became his father's murid in the Chishti Order and got the khilafat Ijazah of all the orders from his father. His spiritual teachings were initiated by his father. He became the Sajjada nashin of the ancestral Khanqah in 1904. The Khanqah flourished during his reign on the Sajjada. Everyone used to call him the exact copy of Shah-e-ata in every way. He took the charge of Darse Nezamia founded by his father, after his father's death. Apart from the traditional methods of the Khanqah of preaching, he instead opted for many modern methods of teaching. * Halqae-Abulolaiya It was an organization for all Muslims. A programme that was organised on the 17th of every Islamic month. Speeches of different Ulema and Sufi were organized in the campus of Khanqah. This group also had the responsibility of the burial of anonymous dead bodies of Muslims. This group is still in existence and the present Sajjada nashin of the Khanqah is the Chief of this organisation. * Matbua-Monamia Matbua-Monamia is a publication house that published different manuscripts preserved in the ancestral library of the Khanqah. It is the first publication house to be founded in Gaya. Hussainuddin published many books written by his ancestors, especially those written by Fani and his disciples. He authored many books, including the biography of many great Islamic personalities like Jalaluddin Tabrezi and Maqdum Munampak. He was the first to write the biography of Maqdum Munampak and Shah-e-ata. He also wrote travelogues. He was the first to write the history of Zahidia order in Bihar. He has also worked over Tasawwuf to a great extent. He added much to the Islamic literature in Bihar and to the literature of Munami Order. * Hizbul- Foqra In the early 19th century Wahabism arrived in India and many groups had come up against Sunni Islam and especially against the Khanqah of that time. Hussainuddin founded a group of learned people and Islamic scholars who would fight against anti-Sunni activities rising in Bihar. He united the scholars, masters, Sufis of all orders and other khanqahs of Bihar. He died in 1939 at the age of 55 and left behind a son and daughter. He had three marriages. He did not have any children from his first wife. After the death of his first wife he married again and had children, but they all died in infancy and his second wife died soon after. His third marriage produced two children who have carried his lineage. His son, Amir-ul-Mashaiq Syed Shah Ghulam-e-Mustafa Ahmed Chishti is the present Sajjada nashin of the Khanqah. He had thousands of disciples and khalifa all over the Indian sub-continent who have carried his spiritual teachings forward. === Shah Hesamuddin Chishti === Born in 1899, he was the third son of Shah Nezamuddin Chishti. He received his education at Dars-e-Nezamia on the Khanqah campus and from his eldest brother, Shah Hussainuddin Safi. He became a disciple of his brother in the Chishti Order. The master awarded him Khilafat Ijazah of all the orders after completing all of his spiritual teachings. He was serving as the Chief librarian of the Jamia Millia Islamia when Hussainuddin called him in 1938 to give him all the responsibilities of the Khanqah. He was a very immaculate and soft-spoken person. He left for Pakistan in 1958 after making his nephew, the son of Shah Hussainuddin Safi the new Sajjada nashin of the Khanqah. He had two marriages. He had one daughter from the first marriage, and six children (one son and five daughters) from the second marriage. He died in 1992, at the age of 93, and is buried in Yaseenabad graveyard, Azizabad, Karachi. === Amir-ul-Mashaiq === He was born on 14 December 1936. When Amir-ul-Mashaiq was two and a half years old, his father died. Before his death, Shah Hussainuddin Safi put the ancestral cap of the Sajjada nashin on his head, and announced him as his successor and the heir of all his personal and ancestral belongings of the Khanqah. Amir-ul-Mashaiq served as the Sajjada nashin of the Khanqah for 54 years. He died on 30 January 2012. His funeral rites took place on the following day after the nemaz of Asr. His mausoleum is erected just adjacent to Fani, as the location of the tomb was revealed to the eldest grandson of Amir-ul-Mashaiq. He had thousands of disciples all over India, Pakistan, and the USA, and he also had many khalifas all over India. He was married to a descendant of Abdul-Qadir Gilani, the eldest daughter of Hakeem Abdur-Rahim Qadri, Amjhar Sharif, Aurangabad, Bihar. He had three sons and eight daughters. Each Sufi of Gaya learned spiritual lessons from him, which earned him the name Amir-ul-Mashaiq (the master of all masters). == Disciples == It is believed by his followers that he had approximately 60,000 disciples all over Asia. Many of them went on to become successful Sufi of their time. A few are listed below. === Razzaqi order === Since Shah-e-Ata was given the title of Abdul Razzaq his disciples and Sufis of his order proudly wrote themselves as Sufis of Razzaqi order. Thus the Razzaqi Order came into existence. === Notable disciples === One major reason for the loss of information regarding many of his Khalifas was that it was lost during India's First War of Independence in 1857. The second cause was when the Wahhabi extremists formed Saudi Arabia and Sufis had to leave that region. Shah-e-Ata's Khulfas and their successors in the Middle East went out of touch and could not be traced after that. Much information regarding Sufis of the Razzaqi order was lost during the Partition of India in 1947. So much less information regarding the disciples and Sufis of the order of Shah-e-Ata is available. Some information has been recovered from the book of Shahe-e-Ata, Kaifya-tul-Aarfeen wa Nisbatul Aasheqeen, which was published twice, once during the life of the author and again in the life of his great grandson, Shah Hussainuddin Safi. Many other Sufis who are the successors of the disciples of Shah-e-Ata have been tracked down since 1970 and have become an important source of information regarding the Razzaqi order and the history of Razzaqi order in different parts of Asia. Only the most famous Sufis are listed below, whose orders are still present by means of any living Sufi and as long as their successors are still in touch with the successors of Shah-e-Ata.  Syed Shah Qazi Mazahir Imam  When he became the murid of Shah-e-ata he would to visit his master in the Khanqah everyday on foot, covering a distance of five to seven kilometers across mountain and rivers. He died in 1942 and was buried in the Abgila locality of Gaya. He founded his own Khanqah which is famous as Khanqah mazahirya and is still in existence. He had three sons: Qazi Maqbool Imam, Qazi Waris Imam, and Qazi Jalil Imam.  Syed Shah Nudrat Hussain Burdawani  He was already the Sajjada nashin of his ancestral Khanqah established at Burdwan, West Bengal. He was ordered spiritually from his ancestors to go to Gaya and become the Fani's disciple. He wrote the Malfoozat (sayings of a Sufi) of Fani in forty lessons. After completing his sulook he went to Burdwan. After his death he was buried in his own Khanqah at Burdwan, West Bengal. == See also == *Khwaja Wali Kirani *Sufism == References  Further reading == *Ata Hussain Fani, (1930). \\"Kaifya-tul-Aarfeen Nisbatul Aasheqeen\\", \\"Al Maktab-e-Monamia\\". *Ata Hussain Fani, (1883). \\"Kanz-ul- Ansaab\\", the Syeds of Bihar, \\"Matbua Haidari Safdari\\", Mumbai. *Ata Hussain Fani, (1876). \\"Masnavi Sirr-e-Haq\\",\\"Matbua Navalkishor\\", Lucknow. *Sheikh Hussainuddin, (1937). \\"Tazkira-e-Fani\\", the life and times of Shah Abdur Razzaq, \\"Al-Maktaba-e-Monamia\\". *Syed Muhammad Sabahuddin Monami, (2000), \\"Zikr-e-Ata\\", the precise biography of Shah-e-Ata, \\"Maktaba-e-Ataiya\\". *Dr. Ata Khursheed, (2004). \\"Safarnama-e-Haj 'Syed Ata Hussain Fani'\\", Aligarh Muslim University, research unit, AMU. *Qamar Aazam Hashmi, (1969). \\"Bihar mein Urdu savaneh nigari\\", \\"Patna Printers\\". *Akhtar Orenvi, (1971). \\"Bihar mein Urdu Nasr ka Irtaqa\\", \\"Patna Book Trust\\". *Ahmedullah Nadvi, (1974). \\"Muslim Shorae Bihar(Vol.4)\\", \\"Karanchi Offsets\\".

Howoju or Owoju) 1866. White Bull later recalled that the elder White Swan \\"in particular hated the whites.\\" By the time of the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, however, White Swan's position had moderated and he had settled at the Cheyenne River Agency on the Missouri River. His sons, however, including Paul Swan a.k.a. Little Swan, Fine Weather and Puts on His Shoes, remained out with the non-treaty bands. Paul fought at the Battle of Rosebud and the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Following the death of his father in 1877, Paul Swan assumed the leadership role of his family band. ==Cheyenne River Reservation== It is uncertain when Paul Swan and his brothers surrendered at the Cheyenne River Agency. They may have come in with the large number of Minneconjou who surrendered in the spring of 1877 or they could have gone to Canada with Sitting Bull and not returned until the surrenders in 1881-82. By 1886, Paul Swan was living at Cheyenne River. In 1881, the Minneconjou leadership gathered at Cheyenne River to select new slcapshirt wearers, symbols of leadership among the Lakota. With only three of the original chieftains still living, the tribe decided to select replacements. Paul Swan was selected to fill the vacancy of his father.

(Teichert 1964) Septal necks are generally short and cyrtochoanitic, some being recumbent, some hook shaped. Most grew to lengths of about but some, like the Huroniidae of the Silurian grew significantly larger. ==Ecology== The Actinocerida inhabited shallow to quite deep waters, where they alternated between swimming and lying on the bottom. They were predatory, and able to control their buoyancy to a greater degree than their contemporaries. == Derivation == The derivation of the Actinocerida remains enigmatic. They first appear late in the Early Ordovician (Cassinian Stage, late Floian) with the Georginidae but don't become well established until the beginning of the early Whiterockian Stage (Dapingian) of the Middle Ordovician (Flower 1868,1976) The Georginidae, introduced and described by Mary Wade in 1977 (Wade 1988), based on the genus Georgina, are known from the upper Canadian Coolibah Formation of the Georgina Basin in Northern Australia. How the Georginidae relate to older stocks is unclear. The Upper Cambrian Protactinocerida have been suggested as being ancestral but none are known to have gone beyond the near end of the Cambrian extinction, which makes any connection hypothetical. Polydesmia was once thought to be the ancestral form of the actinocerids, and was derived from the ellesmeroceriid Bathmoceras. However, it turned out based on a reassessment of Lower Ordovician and Whiterockian formations in northeastern China that Polydesmia is antedated by Wutinoceras,Flower, R.H. 1976, New American Wutinoceratidae with Review of Actinoceroid Occurrences in Eastern Hemisphere, Memoir 28 Part I; New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, Socorro, NM its assumed primitive nature rather a derived condition. == Evolution and diversification == Actinocerids first appeared early in the Middle Ordovician, with the exception of the Georginidae, which are known from the Cassinian in Northern Australia. They reached their greatest diversity in the Middle Ordovician with more than 20 genera, then declined somewhat in the Late Ordovician and more so in the Early Silurian; made a slight come back in the Middle Silurian but not to Late Ordovician numbers; and declined more or less steadily from the Late Silurian into the Devonian. Three major lineages began the Middle Ordovician, the Actinoceratidae, Armenoceratidae, and Ormoceratidae. The Actinoceratidae and Armenoceratidae are most likely derived from Wutinoceras and the Ormoceratidae from a second wutinocerid genus, Adamsoceras. Gonioceras is an offshoot of an early Armenoceras; Lambeoceras and Huronia are offshoots of a later Actinoceras.Flower, R.H. 1968, The First Great Expansion of the Actinoceroids, Memoir 19,Part I; New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, Socorro, NM The Actinoceratidae extend into the Lower Silurian with Actinoceras; the Armenoceratidae and Huroniidae extend into the Upper Silurian. The Ormoceratidae are possibly the most recent, extending into the Lower Devonian Gonioceras (Gonioceratidae) is limited to the Middle Ordovician, its quasi- lookalike Lambeoceras (Lamberoceratidae) to the uppermost Middle and Upper Ordovician. The wutinocerids are known only from the early Middle Ordovician (Whiterockian) and the polydesmiadids are restricted to about that time. Originating in the Ordovician, by the Devonian period actinocerids became rare; perhaps they were unable to compete with the more compact and maneuverable coiled nautiloids and ammonoids and cope with the arrival of jawed fish. == Classification and taxonomy == The Actinocerida contain nine families; the Georginidae, Wutinoceratidae, Polydesmiidae, Armenoceratidae, Ormoceratidae, Actinoceratidae, Gonioceratidae, Lambeoceratide, and Huroniidae. The Carbactinoceratidae, included in the taxonomy in the Treatise, (Vol K) have been removed to the Pseudorthocerida.Kr√∂ger, B. and Mapes, R. 2007; Carboniferous Actinoceratoid Nautiloidea (Cephalopods) - A New Perspective; Journal of Paleontology; July 2007; v. 81; no. 4; p. 714-724 :Georginidae, Wade 1977; late E- early M Ord., Aust, Asia; Georgina, Mesaktoceras : Wutinoceratidae, Shimazu and Obata, 1938, ?late E - early M Ord (Whiterock); Asia, Aunt N Am.

The adult beetles are moderate-sized, 5 to 14 mm long. The genus is primarily Holarctic in distribution, with only a few species known from the Afrotropical and Neotropical realms.Ross H.

However, a number of species groups are recognized after the works of David J. Larson and Anders N. Nilsson. The genus is probably polyphyletic or paraphyletic. In a recent study of mitochondrial DNA, Agabus was found paraphyletic with respect to several of the species groups of Platambus, a closely related genus in the tribe Agabini.Ignacio Ribera, Anders N. Nilsson, Alfried P. Vogler (2004). Phylogeny and historical biogeography of Agabinae diving beetles (Coleoptera) inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequences. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 30 (3): 545-562. Lately the taxonomy of the genus has been revised, and some groups of species were transferred from Agabus sensu stricto to other genera in the tribe Agabini.

The celebrations and observances of this day occur primarily in regions of the Western world, albeit some traditions vary significantly between geographical areas. ==Origins== Halloween, also spelled as Hallowe'en or Allhallowe'en, is a contraction of All Hallows' Eve, the eve of vigil before the Western Christian feast of All Hallows (or All Saints) which is observed on November 1. This day begins the triduum of Hallowtide, which culminates with All Souls' Day. In the Middle Ages, many Christians held a folk belief that All Hallows' Eve was the \\"night where the veil between the material world and the afterlife was at its most transparent\\". ==AmericasCanada=== Scottish emigration, primarily to Canada before 1870 and to the United States thereafter, brought the Scottish version of the holiday to each country. The earliest known reference to ritual begging on Halloween in English speaking North America occurs in 1911 when a newspaper in Kingston, Ontario reported that it was normal for the smaller children to go street \\"guising\\" on Halloween between 6 and 7 p.m., visiting shops, and neighbors to be rewarded with nuts and candies for their rhymes and songs. Canadians spend more on candy at Halloween than at any time apart from Christmas. Halloween is also a time for charitable contributions. Until 2006 when UNICEF moved to an online donation system, collecting small change was very much a part of Canadian trick-or-treating.Mackenzie, Marika. \\"10 things you didn't know about Halloween in Canada\\", Canadian Geographic, 31 October 2013 Quebec offers themed tours of parts of the old city and historic cemeteries in the area. In 2014 the hamlet of Arviat, Nunavut moved their Halloween festivities to the community hall, cancelling the practice of door-to-door \\"trick or treating\\", due to the risk of roaming polar bears.Holthaus, Eric. \\"Canadian Town Cancels Outdoor Halloween Because Polar Bears\\", Slate, 20 October 2014 In British Columbia it is a tradition to set off fireworks at Halloween. ===United States=== Children in Halloween costumes at High Point, Seattle, 1943 Community Halloween party in Frazier Park, California. Children on Halloween, Woody Creek, Colorado In the United States, where lingering Puritan tradition restricted the observance of many holidays, Halloween did not become a holiday until the 19th century. The transatlantic migration of nearly two million Irish following the Great Irish Famine (1845‚Äì1849) brought the holiday to the United States. American librarian and author Ruth Edna Kelley wrote the first book length history of the holiday in the U.S., The Book of Hallowe'en (1919), and references souling in the chapter \\"Hallowe'en in America\\": \\"All Hallowe'en customs in the United States are borrowed directly or adapted from those of other countries. The taste in Hallowe'en festivities now is to study old traditions, and hold a Scotch party, using Robert Burns's poem Halloween as a guide; or to go a-souling as the English used. In short, no custom that was once honored at Hallowe'en is out of fashion now.\\" The main event for children of modern Halloween in the United States and Canada is trick-or-treating, in which children, teenagers, (sometimes) young adults, and parents (accompanying their children) disguise themselves in costumes and go door-to-door in their neighborhoods, ringing each doorbell and yelling \\"Trick or treat!\\" to solicit a gift of candy or similar items. Teenagers and adults will more frequently attend Halloween-themed costume parties typically hosted by friends or themed events at nightclubs either on Halloween itself or a weekend close to the holiday. At the turn of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with destruction of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the Boy Scouts, Boys Clubs, and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night. The commercialization of Halloween in the United States did not start until the 20th century, beginning perhaps with Halloween postcards (featuring hundreds of designs), which were most popular between 1905 and 1915. Dennison Manufacturing Company (which published its first Halloween catalog in 1909) and the Beistle Company were pioneers in commercially made Halloween decorations, particularly die-cut paper items. German manufacturers specialised in Halloween figurines that were exported to the United States in the period between the two World Wars. Halloween is now the United States' second most popular holiday (after Christmas) for decorating; the sale of candy and costumes is also extremely common during the holiday, which is marketed to children and adults alike. The National Confectioners Association (NCA) reported in 2005 that 80% of American adults planned to give out candy to trick-or-treaters. The NCA reported in 2005 that 93% of children planned to go trick-or-treating. According to the National Retail Federation, the most popular Halloween costume themes for adults are, in order: witch, pirate, vampire, cat, and clown.2006 Halloween Consumer Intentions and Actions Survey. Washington, DC: The National Retail Federation. Each year, popular costumes are dictated by various current events and pop culture icons. On many college campuses, Halloween is a major celebration, with the Friday and Saturday nearest 31 October hosting many costume parties. Other popular activities are watching horror movies and visiting haunted houses. Total spending on Halloween is estimated to be $8.4 billion. Events Four contestants in the Halloween Slick Chick beauty contest in Anaheim, California, 1947 Many theme parks stage Halloween events annually, such as Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando, Mickey's Halloween Party and Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party at Disneyland Resort and Magic Kingdom respectively, and Knott's Scary Farm at Knott's Berry Farm. One of the more notable parades is New York's Village Halloween Parade. Each year approximately 50,000 costumed marchers parade up Sixth Avenue. Salem, Massachusetts, site of the Salem witch trials, celebrates Halloween throughout the month of October with tours, plays, concerts, and other activities. A number of venues in New York's lower Hudson Valley host various events to showcase a connection with Washington Irving's Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Van Cortlandt Manor stages the \\"Great Jack o' Lantern Blaze\\" featuring thousands of lighted carved pumpkins. Some locales have had to modify their celebrations due to disruptive behavior on the part of young adults. Madison, Wisconsin hosts an annual Halloween celebration. In 2002, due to the large crowds in the State Street area, a riot broke out, necessitating the use of mounted police and tear gas to disperse the crowds. Likewise, Chapel Hill, site of the University of North Carolina, has a downtown street party which in 2007 drew a crowd estimated at 80,000 on downtown Franklin Street, in a town with a population of just 54,000. In 2008, in an effort to curb the influx of out-of-towners, mayor Kevin Foy put measures in place to make commuting downtown more difficult on Halloween. In 2014, large crowds of college students rioted at the Keene, New Hampshire Pumpkin Fest, whereupon the City Council voted not to grant a permit for the following year's festival, and organizers moved the event to Laconia for 2015. ===Dominican Republic=== In the Dominican Republic it has been gaining popularity, largely due to many Dominicans living in the United States and then bringing the custom to the island. In the larger cities of Santiago or Santo Domingo it has become more common to see children trick-or-treating, but in smaller towns and villages it is almost entirely absent, partly due to religious opposition. Tourist areas such as Sosua and Punta Cana feature many venues with Halloween celebrations, predominantly geared towards adults. === Mexico (D√≠a de Muertos) === Mexican Tomb on the 2019 Day of the Dead, adorned with the cempas√∫chil, the traditional flower of the Day of the Dead, and a Halloween ghost balloon, at the historic cemetery of San Luis Potos√≠ City Observed in Mexico and Mexican communities abroad, Day of the Dead (Spanish: D√≠a de Muertos) celebrations arose from the syncretism of indigenous Aztec traditions with the Christian Hallowtide of the Spanish colonizers. Flower decorations, altars and candies are part of this holiday season. The holiday is distinct from Halloween in its origins and observances, but the two have become associated because of cross-border connections between Mexico and the United States through popular culture and migration, as the two celebrations occur at the same time of year and may involve similar imagery, such as skeletons. Halloween and D√≠a de Muertos have influenced each other in some areas of the United States and Mexico, with Halloween traditions such as costumes and face- painting becoming increasingly common features of the Mexican festival. ==AsiaChina=== The Chinese celebrate the \\"Hungry Ghost Festival\\" in mid- July, when it is customary to float river lanterns to remember those who have died. By contrast, Halloween is often called \\"All Saints' Festival\\" (W√†nsh√®ngji√©, Ëê¨ËÅñÁØÄ), or (less commonly) \\"All Saints' Eve\\" (W√†nsh√®ngy√®, Ëê¨ËÅñÂ§ú) or \\"Eve of All Saints' Day\\" (W√†nsh√®ngji√© Qi√°ny√®, Ëê¨ËÅñÁØÄÂâçÂ§ï), stemming from the term \\"All Hallows Eve\\" (hallow referring to the souls of holy saints). Chinese Christian churches hold religious celebrations. Non-religious celebrations are dominated by expatriate Americans or Canadians, but costume parties are also popular for Chinese young adults, especially in large cities. Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park (Halloween Bash) host annual Halloween shows. Mainland China has been less influenced by Anglo traditions than Hong Kong and Halloween is generally considered \\"foreign\\". As Halloween has become more popular globally it has also become more popular in China, however, particularly amongst children attending private or international schools with many foreign teachers from North America. Hong Kong Traditional \\"door- to-door\\" trick or treating is not commonly practiced in Hong Kong due to the vast majority of Hong Kong residents living in high-rise apartment blocks. However, in many buildings catering to expatriates, Halloween parties and limited trick or treating is arranged by the management. Instances of street- level trick or treating in Hong Kong occur in ultra-exclusive gated housing communities such as The Beverly Hills populated by Hong Kong's super-rich and in expatriate areas like Discovery Bay and the Red Hill Peninsula. For the general public, there are events at Tsim Sha Tsui's Avenue of the Stars that try to mimic the celebration. In the Lan Kwai Fong area of Hong Kong, known as a major entertainment district for the international community, a Halloween celebration and parade has taken place for over 20 years, with many people dressing in costume and making their way around the streets to various drinking establishments. Many international schools also celebrate Halloween with costumes, and some put an academic twist on the celebrations such as the \\"Book-o-ween\\" celebrations at Hong Kong International School where students dress as favorite literary characters. ===Japan=== Saitama, Japan. Halloween arrived in Japan mainly as a result of American pop culture. As recently as 2009, it was not appreciated and only celebrated by expats. The wearing of elaborate costumes by young adults at night is recently very popular in areas such as Amerikamura in Osaka and Shibuya in Tokyo, where, in October 2012, about 1700 people dressed in costumes to take part in the Halloween Festival. The holiday has become popular with young adults as a costume party and club event. Trick or Treating for Japanese children has taken hold in some areas. The Yakuza have taken advantage of the festival by hosting parties and giving snacks and sweets to children, a tradition which goes back at least for 20 years. ===Philippines=== The period from 31 October through 2 November is a time for remembering dead family members and friends. Many Filipinos travel back to their hometowns for family gatherings of festive remembrance. Trick- or-treating is gradually replacing the dying tradition of Pangangaluluw√¢, a local analogue of the old English custom of souling. People in the provinces still observe Pangangaluluw√¢ by going in groups to every house and offering a song in exchange for money or food. The participants, usually children, would sing carols about the souls in Purgatory, with the ab√∫loy (alms for the dead) used to pay for Masses for these souls. Along with the requested alms, householders sometimes gave the children suman (rice cakes). During the night, various small items, such as clothing, plants, etc., would \\"mysteriously\\" disappear, only to be discovered the next morning in the yard or in the middle of the street. In older times, it was believed that the spirits of ancestors and loved ones visited the living on this night, manifesting their presence by taking an item. As the observation of Christmas traditions in the Philippines begins as early as September, it is a common sight to see Halloween decorations next to Christmas decorations in urban settings. ===Singapore=== Around mid-July Singapore Chinese celebrate \\"Zhong Yuan Jie / Yu Lan Jie\\" (Hungry Ghosts Festival), a time when it is believed that the spirits of the dead come back to visit their families. In recent years, Halloween celebrations are becoming more popular, with influence from the west. In 2012, there were over 19 major Halloween celebration events around Singapore. SCAPE's Museum of Horrors held its fourth scare fest in 2014. Universal Studios Singapore hosts \\"Halloween Horror Nights\\". ==Australia and New Zealand== Halloween display in Sydney, Australia. While not traditionally a part of Australian culture, non-religious celebrations of Halloween modeled on North American festivities are growing increasingly popular in Australia, in spite of seasonal differences and the transition from spring to summer. Criticism stems largely from the fact that Halloween has little relevance to Australian culture. It is also considered, by some Australians, to be an unwanted American influence; as although Halloween does have Celtic/European origins, its increasing popularity in Australia is largely as a result of American pop-culture influence. Supporters of the event claim that the critics fail to see that the event is not entirely American, but rather Celtic and is no different to embracing other cultural traditions such as Saint Patrick's Day. Due to the opposition to Halloween by some people, there is a growing movement where people are inviting trick-or-treaters to take part by putting a balloon or decoration on their letter box, to indicate that they are welcome to come knocking. In the past decade, the popularity of Halloween in Australia has grown. In New Zealand, as in neighbouring Australia, Halloween is not celebrated to the same extent as in North America, although in recent years the non-religious celebrations have been achieving some popularity especially among young children. Trick-or-treat has become increasingly popular with minors in New Zealand over the years, despite being not a \\"British or Kiwi event\\" that purely is only influenced by American globalization. Critics of Halloween in New Zealand believe that commercialization of Halloween by the popular store The Warehouse has pushed the popularity of Halloween into an unofficial national holiday. ==Europe== Over the years, Halloween has become more successful in Europe and has been partially ousting some older customs like the ' (), Martinisingen, and others.Halloween in der Steiermark und anderswo, Volkskunde (M√ºnster in Westfalen), Hrsg. Editha H√∂randner, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2005 . \\"Don't drink and fly\\" decoration for Halloween, 2008 in Pinneberg ===Germany=== Halloween was not generally observed in Germany prior to the 1990s, but has been increasing in popularity. It has been associated with the influence of United States culture, and \\"Trick or Treating\\" (in German, \\"S√º√ües sonst gibt's Saures\\") has been occurring in various German cities, especially in areas such as the Dahlem neighborhood in Berlin, which was part of the American zone during the Cold War. Today, Halloween in Germany brings in 200 million euros a year, through multiple industries. Halloween is celebrated by both children and adults. Adults celebrate at themed costume parties and clubs, while children go trick or treating. Complaints of vandalism associated with Halloween \\"Tricks\\" are increasing, particularly from many elderly Germans unfamiliar with \\"Trick or Treating\\".Rupert Neate and Nicholas Connolly (31 October 2013), Holiday Backlash: Germans Cringe at Rise of Halloween Der Spiegel ===Greece=== Halloween is a working day in Greece and it was not mass celebrated until the early 2000s. Halloween has been increasing in popularity during the 2010s, as a commercial and secular celebration. Even through Carnival is more popular among Greeks, Halloween is considered the 4th most profitable festival in Greece after Christmas, Easter and Carnival. Since it is a working day is not always celebrated on the 31st of October but the last weekend before All Hallow's Eve unless Halloween is on a weekend. It has been associated with the influence of the western culture. Bars, nightclubs and fun parks organise Halloween parties for adults and young adults. Trick or treating is not widely popular because similar celebrations are common during carnival in villages and the country side. The rise of popularity for Halloween influenced the popularity in many Balkan countries like Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia along with Cyprus where Greek retailers are selling Halloween merchandise in late September every year. ===Ireland=== A traditional Irish turnip (rutabaga) jack-o'-lantern, c. early 20th century, on display in the Museum of Country Life, Ireland. On Halloween night, adults and children dress up as ghosts, ghouls, zombies, witches, and goblins, light bonfires, and enjoy spectacular fireworks displays ‚Äì in particular, the city of Derry is home to the largest organized Halloween celebration on the island, in the form of a street carnival and fireworks display. Snap-Apple Night (1832) by Daniel Maclise. Depicts apple bobbing and divination games at a Halloween party in Blarney, Ireland. Games are often played, such as bobbing for apples, in which apples, peanuts, and other nuts and fruit and some small coins are placed in a basin of water. Everyone takes turns catching as many items possible using only their mouths. Another common game involves the hands-free eating of an apple hung on a string attached to the ceiling. Games of divination are also played at Halloween.de Leary, Kim. \\"Traditional Halloween Divination Games from Ireland\\" www.startpage.ie Colcannon is traditionally served on Halloween. 31 October is the busiest day of the year for the Emergency Services. Bangers and fireworks are illegal in the Republic of Ireland; however, they are commonly smuggled in from Northern Ireland where they are legal. Bonfires are frequently built around Halloween. Trick-or-treating is popular amongst children on 31 October and Halloween parties and events are commonplace. Carved pumpkin, Bono, Sardinia ===Italy=== In Italy All Saints' Day is a public holiday. On 2 November, Tutti i Morti or All Souls' Day, families remember loved ones who have died. These are still the main holidays. In some Italian tradition, children would awake on the morning of All Saints or All Souls to find small gifts from their deceased ancestors. In Sardinia, Concas de Mortu (Head of the deads), carved pumpkins that look like skulls, with candles inside are displayed. Halloween is, however, gaining in popularity, and involves costume parties for young adults.Paglia, Roberto. \\"Saints and Souls\\", Best of Sicily Magazine, 2005 The traditions to carve pumpkins in a skull figure, lighting candles inside, or to beg for small gifts for the deads e.g. sweets or nuts, also belong to North Italy. In Veneto these carved pumpkins were called lum√®re (lanterns) or suche dei morti (deads' pumpkins). ===Poland and the Czech Republic=== Since the fall of Communism in 1989, Halloween has become increasingly popular in Poland and the Czech Republic. Particularly, it is celebrated among younger people. The influx of Western tourists and expats throughout the 1990s introduced the costume party aspect of Hallowe'en celebrations, particularly in clubs and at private house parties. Door-to-door trick or treating is not common. Pumpkin carving is becoming more evident, following a strong North American version of the tradition. ===Romania=== Romanians observe the Feast of St. Andrew, patron saint of Romania, on 30 November. On St. Andrew's Eve ghosts are said to be about. A number of customs related to divination, in other places connected to Halloween, are associated with this night. However, with the popularity of Dracula in western Europe, around Halloween the Romanian tourist industry promotes trips to locations connected to the historical Vlad Tepe»ô and the more fanciful Dracula of Bram Stoker. One of the most successful Halloween Parties in Transylvania takes place in Sighi»ôoara, the citadel where Vlad the Impaler was born. This party include magician shows, ballet show and The Ritual Killing of a Living DeadThe biggest Halloween party in Transylvania take place at Bran Castle, aka Dracula's Castle from Transylvania. Both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches in Romania discourage Halloween celebrations, advising their parishioners to focus rather on the \\"Day of the Dead\\" on 1 November, when special religious observances are held for the souls of the deceased. Opposition by religious and nationalist groups, including calls to ban costumes and decorations in schools in 2015, have been met with criticism. Halloween parties are popular in bars and nightclubs. ===Russia=== In Russia most Christians are Orthodox, and in the Orthodox Church Halloween is on the Saturday after Pentecost and therefore 4 to 5 months before western Halloween. Celebration of western Halloween began in the 1990s around the downfall of the Soviet regime, when costume and ghoulish parties spread throughout night clubs throughout Russia. Halloween is generally celebrated by younger generations and is not widely celebrated in civic society (e.g. theaters or libraries). In fact, Halloween is among the Western celebrations that the Russian government and politicians‚Äîwhich have grown increasingly anti-Western in the early 2010s‚Äîare trying to eliminate from public celebration. === Spain=== In Spain, celebrations involve eating castanyes (roast chestnuts), panellets (special almond balls covered in pine nuts), moniatos (roast or baked sweet potato), Ossos de Sant cake and preserved fruit (candied or glazed fruit). Moscatell (Muscat) is drunk from porrons. Around the time of this celebration, it is common for street vendors to sell hot toasted chestnuts wrapped in newspaper. In many places, confectioners often organise raffles of chestnuts and preserved fruit. The tradition of eating these foods comes from the fact that during All Saints' night, on the eve of All Souls' Day in the Christian tradition, bell ringers would ring bells in commemoration of the dead into the early morning. Friends and relatives would help with this task, and everyone would eat these foods for sustenance. Other versions of the story state that the Castanyada originates at the end of the 18th century and comes from the old funeral meals, where other foods, such as vegetables and dried fruit were not served. The meal had the symbolic significance of a communion with the souls of the departed: while the chestnuts were roasting, prayers would be said for the person who had just died.Soler i Amig√≥, 2001, p. 200. The festival is usually depicted with the figure of a castanyera: an old lady, dressed in peasant's clothing and wearing a headscarf, sitting behind a table, roasting chestnuts for street sale. In recent years, the Castanyada has become a revetlla of All Saints and is celebrated in the home and community. It is the first of the four main school festivals, alongside Christmas, Carnestoltes and St George's Day, without reference to ritual or commemoration of the dead.Soler i Amig√≥, 2001, p. 201. === Sweden === On All Hallow's Eve, a Requiem Mass is widely attended every year at Uppsala Cathedral, part of the Lutheran Church of Sweden. Throughout the period of Allhallowtide, starting with All Hallow's Eve, Swedish families visit churchyards and adorn the graves of their family members with lit candles and wreaths fashioned from pine branches. Among children, the practice of dressing in costume and collecting candy has gained popularity in recent years. === Switzerland === In Switzerland, Halloween, after first becoming popular in 1999, is on the wane, and is most popular with young adults who attend parties. Switzerland already has a \\"festival overload\\" and even though Swiss people like to dress up for any occasion, they do prefer a traditional element, such as in the Fasnacht tradition of chasing away winter using noise and masks.Taylor, Pamela. \\"Halloween in Switzerland\\", Le News, 30 October 2014 ===United Kingdom and Crown dependencies=== England In the past, on All Souls' Eve families would stay up late, and little \\"soul cakes\\" were eaten. At the stroke of midnight, there was solemn silence among households, which had candles burning in every room to guide the souls back to visit their earthly homes and a glass of wine on the table to refresh them. The tradition of giving soul cakes that originated in Great Britain and Ireland was known as souling, often seen as the origin of modern trick or treating in North America, and souling continued in parts of England as late as the 1930s, with children going from door to door singing songs and saying prayers for the dead in return for cakes or money. Trick or treating and other Halloween celebrations are extremely popular, with shops decorated with witches and pumpkins, and young people attending costume parties.Hanc, John. \\"How Halloween Has Taken Over England\\", Smithsonian Magazine, 31 October 2014 Scotland The name Halloween is first attested in the 16th century as a Scottish shortening of the fuller All- Hallow-Even, that is, the night before All Hallows' Day. Dumfries poet John Mayne's 1780 poem made note of pranks at Halloween \\"What fearfu' pranks ensue!\\". Scottish poet Robert Burns was influenced by Maynes composition, and portrayed some of the customs in his poem Halloween (1785). According to Burns, Halloween is \\"thought to be a night when witches, devils, and other mischief-making beings are all abroad on their baneful midnight errands\\". Among the earliest record of Guising at Halloween in Scotland is in 1895, where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips, visit homes to be rewarded with cakes, fruit and money. If children approached the door of a house, they were given offerings of food. The children's practice of \\"guising\\", going from door to door in costumes for food or coins, is a traditional Halloween custom in Scotland. These days children who knock on their neighbours doors have to sing a song or tell stories for a gift of sweets or money. A traditional Halloween game includes apple \\"dooking\\", or \\"dunking\\" or (i.e., retrieving one from a bucket of water using only one's mouth), and attempting to eat, while blindfolded, a treacle/jam- coated scone hanging on a piece of string. Traditional customs and lore include divination practices, ways of trying to predict the future. A traditional Scottish form of divining one's future spouse is to carve an apple in one long strip, then toss the peel over one's shoulder. The peel is believed to land in the shape of the first letter of the future spouse's name. Isle of Man See Hop-tu-Naa. Halloween is a popular traditional occasion on the Isle of Man, where it is known as Hop-tu-Naa. ==Elsewhere== The children of the largest town in Bonaire gather together on Halloween day. ===Saint Helena=== In Saint Helena, Halloween is actively celebrated, largely along the American model, with ghosts, skeletons, devils, vampires, witches and the like. Imitation pumpkins are used instead of real pumpkins because the pumpkin harvesting season in Saint Helena's hemisphere is not near Halloween. Trick-or-treating is widespread. Party venues provide entertainment for adults. ==See also== * Festival of the Dead ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Brock, Michelle. \\"What Halloween Can Learn from History\\" Category:Halloween Category:Human geography Category:Allhallowtide ","title":"Geography of Halloween"},{"id":"20445667","text":"Mark Prettenthaler (born 11 April 1983) is a former Austrian footballer. ==Honours== Pasching *Austrian Cup: 2012‚Äì13 ==References * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Austrian footballers Category:Austria youth international footballers Category:Austrian expatriate footballers Category:SK Sturm Graz players Category:FC Augsburg players Category:Kapfenberger SV players Category:LASK players Category:SV Ried players Category:FC Juniors O√ñ players Category:SC Wiener Neustadt players Category:SKN St. P√∂lten players Category:2.

A large, red brick building, it was built in the early 1760s on the site of a mediaeval church which collapsed in the mid-18th century. It is the only large Georgian church in Surrey, sporting detailed frescos of the Crucifixion surrounded by the Saints and the Ascended Lord in Heaven, as well as one of the largest unsupported ceilings in southern England. It is a Grade I listed building. From 1927, when the diocese of Guildford was created, until 1961, when the current cathedral was consecrated, it served as pro-cathedral. Today it forms part of the town centre parish of Holy Trinity and Saint Mary's. == History  Construction and development === The original, mediaeval church was similar in plan to the surviving Saint Mary's. Its date of construction is unknown, although the list of rectors goes back to 1304. It may have been a Norman foundation. It is believed that Henry I granted the living to Merton Priory, which retained it until the Dissolution. ===Weston Chapel=== Wren The marble baptismal font dates to 1910 The \\"Weston Chapel\\" stands attached to the south side of the main church. Its external walls are of a decorative chequerboard pattern of flint and freestone squares. It was built c.1540 by Richard Weston (1465‚Äì1541) of nearby Sutton Place, primarily as his intended burial place, as his will, dated 15 May 1541,National Archives PROB 11/29 directs that his body be: > \\"buryed in the P'yshe Churche of the Holy Trinitye with in the Town of > Guldforde in a Chapell which I have caused to be made for the same iyntent\\" The Chantry established and funded by Weston is listed in the \\"Survey of Chantry Lands, Surrey\\" made between 1546 and 1548 as part of the administering of the Dissolution of the Monasteries as being: > \\"For the mayneteyninge of one priest and one yerely obite for the terme of > xx ti (i.e.20) yeares begyninge the xx th day of June in the xxxii yere > (1541) of the reigne of our late sovereign lorde Kinge Henry the eight.

Qrt. xlii s iii d Ornamentes x li.\\" The Weston family maintained their Catholic faith throughout the Reformation and beyond, which was a great sacrifice for them as it prevented them from holding public office and brought much suspicion on them from government officials throughout the ages. The freehold of the Weston Chapel was retained by descendants of the Weston family until 2005, when the trustees of the Weston Estate granted it to the main Protestant Church of Holy Trinity to which it has been physically attached since 1763. Part of the arrangement was that a Catholic mass be held in the Chapel at least annually. There are three surviving Weston monuments in the chapel. Two are wall tablets, the earliest of which commemorates Melior Mary Weston (d.1782) of Sutton Place, the last direct descendant of the founder and only child and sole heiress of John II Weston (d.1730) and Elizabeth Gage, sister of Thomas Gage, 1st Viscount Gage. The tablet was erected by her grateful distant Catholic cousin John Webbe- Weston (d.1823) to whom she bequeathed all her estates, including Sutton Place. The other tablet is for Elizabeth Lawson, who died in 1791 aged 34, first wife of John Webbe-Weston.Harrison, Frederic, Annals of an Old Manor House: Sutton Place, Guildford. London, 1899 The other Weston Monument which once stood in the centre of the Weston Chapel but now stands in the west porch of the main church is the chest tomb of Anne Pickering (d.1582), wife of Sir Francis Weston the only son of the founder who was executed in 1536 aged only 25 for supposed adultery with Queen Anne Boleyn. Although she remarried, she expressed the wish in her will to be buried near her first father-in- law.Harrison, op.cit Francis, having been beheaded in the Tower of London, was buried in an unmarked tomb within the precincts of the Tower. The effigy is of a recumbent woman wearing a ruff and lies on a chest tomb sculpted with skulls showing behind a grille. ===Collapse of 1740=== The Chancel The Nave Memorial to Arthur Onslow, former Speaker of the House of Commons In 1740 the steeple collapsed, destroying most of the building. The only part of the church building that survives today is the Weston Chapel. Some external features such as the iron railings also remain from the earlier building, as do two monuments. A new red brick church was erected to the designs of James Horne on the site of the original church and opened in 1763. The architecture has been described as \\"handsome and pedestrian at the same time\\", being of correct classical proportions but with details that are under-scale for such a large building on an important site. Holy Trinity is the only large 18th-century place of worship in Surrey and stands in a commanding position at the top of Guildford's High Street. In the mid-19th century the interior of the church was altered extensively. In 1869 Woodyer replaced the double rows of windows with single rows. The side galleries were removed in 1867. The Victorian emphasis on ritual and sacrament called for a larger chancel, and in 1886 the church was enlarged at the east end, creating the present choir, sanctuary, side chapel and organ chamber. The church is now effectively one huge room with tripartite openings at the east end, allowing access to the chancel and the two side chapels. The central feature of the decoration of the apse is 'the Presence of the Crucified in the Church of all ages': Christ upon the cross is flanked by Aaron, David, and Isaiah on the north side, and Saints Paul, Stephen, and Augustine of Hippo on the south side, representing respectively the priests, kings and prophets of the Jewish Church and the apostles, martyrs and bishops of the Christian Church. The lower paintings in the apse and on the altar are by C E Buckeridge done in 1889‚Äì91. The painting in the vault was added later by a different artist, which is why they are in a different style. Other alterations have taken place throughout the 20th century. The wrought iron choir screen dates from 1927, when Holy Trinity became pro-cathedral. The organ has undergone substantial movement and alteration over the years, culminating in complete renovations in 1977 and 1997. Features inside the church include the tomb of George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1611 to 1633 and founder of Abbot's Hospital, which stands opposite the church, and a memorial to Arthur Onslow, former Speaker of the House of Commons. The panelled octagonal pulpit on its octagonal stem dates to 1769 but is in the style of Wren; it has a domed sounding board above it on fluted Ionic columns. The pulpit was originally higher so that the preacher could see into the galleries when delivering the sermon but it was shortened in 1869. The Baroque style baptismal font was given in 1910 by a Miss Russell in memory of her two sisters and has a red marble bowl sitting on a central stem. It is decorated with the heads of cherubs and acanthus leaves and is possessed of a domed and composite-columned font cover which is currently in storage. The church also has a ring of eight bells hung for change ringing. Four of the bells date from 1769, cast by Lester, Pack & Chapman, with the others having been cast in 1912 by John Taylor & Co. === Pro-Cathedral === As a response to the increasing population of south-east England, the diocese of Winchester was divided into three sections in 1927. The Cong√© d'Elire for this purpose was held in the Weston Chapel. Holy Trinity Church was initially used as the cathedral for the new Diocese of Guildford, but it was judged too small for the task, and in 1928 the diocese decided to build a new cathedral. Work began on the new cathedral in 1933, but the Second World War delayed the construction considerably, and it was not consecrated until 1961, although services had been held in the crypt since 1947. In the intervening years Holy Trinity Church served as pro-cathedral. == Today == George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, erected by his brother Sir Maurice Abbot in 1635. === Worship === The style of worship at Holy Trinity Church falls within the liberal tradition of the Church of England. There are usually two services, a Sung Eucharist (Common Worship) and Evensong (Book of Common Prayer), on a Sunday. Morning Prayer is said every weekday. Sunday worship is led by the forty- strong choir, which is unusual in being a parish church choir which retains an all-boys treble line. Holy Trinity is Guildford's civic church, where the installation of each new Mayor and the town's annual Act of Remembrance is celebrated. It also serves as the venue for regular musical events. The parish of Holy Trinity and Saint Mary's has links with the Diocese of Highveld in South Africa, and a group of parishioners travelled to the Highveld in 2008. ==References External links == * Category:Churches completed in 1763 Category:18th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Buildings and structures in Guildford Guildford Category:Diocese of Guildford Category:Georgian architecture in England Guildford ","title":"Holy Trinity Church, Guildford"},{"id":"20445709","text":"The Ulla-F√∏rre hydropower complex has an installed capacity of approximately 2,100 MW Norway is a heavy producer of renewable energy because of hydropower. Over 99% of the electricity production in mainland Norway is from 31 GW hydropower plants (86 TWh reservoir capacity, storing water from summer to winter).

As per the European Union's 2009 Renewables Directive (later added in the EEA Agreement), Norway has established a national goal for renewable energy - 67.5% of gross final consumption of energy supplied by renewable sources by 2020. ==Green certificates== The system for Guarantees of Origin was implemented by the EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, trading 'green certificates', the sale of which in 2010 relabeled the calculated average electricity consumption mix of a Norwegian household down from the actual 99% to 36% renewable. ==Hydroelectric power== Norway is Europe's largest producer of hydropower and the 6th largest in the world. 90% of capacity is publicly owned. The largest producer is the Norwegian government, through the state- owned Statkraft which in turn, owns nine of the largest hydroelectric plants and is also a major player in the international energy markets. Electricity is also produced by 156 other companies. Hydropower generation capacity is around 31 GW in 2014 and 2019, when around 132 TWh was produced; about 95% of total production.Vannkraftpotensialet Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, 10 December 2015. Hydro production can vary 50-60 TWh between years, depending on amount of precipitation. Large reservoirs (86 TWh combined) are necessary due to precipitation being significantly lower in winter when consumption is highest, while meltwater rushes to the reservoirs in summer when consumption is at its lowest. When reservoirs are full, additional water must be passed through the spillway in a controlled manner to avoid damage. The largest reservoir is Bl√•sj√∏ at 7.8 TWh. The remaining undeveloped hydro potential is about 34 TWh.√òstensen, Inger. \\"Fakta ‚Äì Energi- og vannressurser i Norge 2013 page 24-28. http://www.regjeringen.no.

By 2010 70% of the total potential had already been developed, one of the highest ratios in the world.http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf Dam safety reassessment began in 1995 and by 2014, 26% of existing installations have been rehabilitated or upgraded. Generating capacity in Norway is growing, between 2001 and 2014 there were 397 new projects commissioned, larger than 1 MW. Upgrades to older installations larger than 10 MW represents 70% of all new capacity.https://www.ntnu.no/documents/381182060/641036380/Leif+Lia_FINAL.PDF/32bac8f3-b443-493b-a1eb-e22ce572acd9 Electricity trading with wind power generated in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark is driving modifications to the Norwegian hydro system. ==Wind power== Wind turbine in Bjugn In 2012 Norway had a wind power electricity production of 1.6 TWh, a small fraction of its total production. The following year it approved spending NOK to triple its wind power capacity of ca. 700 MW to more than 2 GW by 2020. In August 2016 construction of the 1 GW Fosen Vind project began. New projects increased capacity to 2.4 GW and production to 5.5 TWh in 2019. Increased production of power from wind turbines can allow Norway to curtail its domestic production of hydroelectricity (stopping hydro turbines), which due to being dispatchable is a valuable asset in the international power market. To further curtail its consumption of hydroelectricity, Norway imports electricity when excess wind production in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands drives prices down there. To further develop its use of both cheap wind power and its dispatchable hydropower, Norway is considering new transmission lines to allow for the same trade with Scotland and Germany sometime after 2020. These are the North Sea Link and the NORD.LINK which are due to come online in 2021 and 2020 respectively. A public hearing in 2019 for further land-based turbine developments received over a thousand responses, the majority of which were negative. ==Transport== In the transport sector the share of renewables has increased from 1.3% to 4% between 2005-2010, and currently Norway has one of the highest numbers of electric cars per capita in the world.Ministry of Petroleum and Energy: \\"National Renewable Energy Action Plan under Directive 2009/28/EC\\", 2012 The government's initial goal of 50,000 electric cars on Norwegian roads was reached on 20 April 2015, more than two years earlier than expected. By reaching a stock of 50,000 electric cars, the market penetration of pure electric vehicles achieved 2% of all passenger cars registered in Norway. The segment's penetration passed 3% in December 2015. Around 3% of some 2.64 million cars in Norway run on electricity by the end of 2015 (includes all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids). With about 90,000 pure electric vehicles registered by mid-September 2016, the all-electric segment achieved a market penetration of 3.5% of all light-duty vehicles on Norway's roads. all-electric Nissan Leaf (left) and the Tesla Model S (right) were the two best selling plug-in electric cars in Norway in 2014. A total of 10,639 plug-in electric vehicles were registered in Norway in 2013, consisting of: 7,885 new electric cars, 2,086 used imported all-electric cars, 328 new plug- in hybrid cars and 340 new all-electric vans. A total of 23,390 plug-in electric vehicles were registered in Norway in 2014, consisting of: 18,094 new electric cars, 3,063 used imported all-electric cars, 1,678 new plug-in hybrid cars and 555 new all-electric vans. The stock of light-duty plug-in electric vehicles registered in Norway passed the 100,000 unit milestone in April 2016, making the country the fourth largest plug-in market in the world after the U.S., China and Japan. In April 2016 Norway just exceeded the threshold of 100 000th registered electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids included. , the Norwegian fleet of plug-in electric vehicles consist of about 81,500 all-electric passenger and light-duty vehicles, almost 17,100 plug-in hybrids, and over 2,000 all-electric commercial vans. The total stock includes almost 12,000 used imported electric cars. , the United States is the leading country market with a stock of about 450,000 highway legal light-duty plug-in electric vehicles delivered since 2008. China ranks second with around 300,000 units sold since 2011, followed by Japan with about 150,000 plug-in units sold since 2009, both through March 2016. European sales are led by Norway with over 100,000 units registered by the end of April 2016. In February 2016, the government opened for public discussion until 1 July 2016 the proposed National Transport Plan 2018-2029 (NTP). The plan explains that the transportation sector accounts for emissions of about 16.5 million tons of , which is about one third of the total greenhouse gas emissions produced domestically in Norway. And road traffic, including both private cars and heavy vehicles, account for about 10 million tons of . The NTP set policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars, trucks, ships, aircraft and construction equipment by about one half until 2030. In order to achieve this objective, among others, the NTP sets the goal that all new cars, buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 should be zero emission vehicles, this is, all-electric and hydrogen vehicles. By 2030, heavy-duty vans, 75% of new long-distance buses, and 50% of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles. Also, by 2030, 40% of all ships in short sea shipping should be using biofuels or be low- or zero-emission ships such as electric ferries. The proposed strategy states that until zero-emission vehicles take over, all internal combustion engine cars sold be plug-in hybrids, and wherever possible, biofuels must be used. Also, government agencies should as far as possible make use of biofuels, low- and zero-emission technologies in private and hired vehicles and vessels. The plan also calls to support the deployment of zero emission vehicles, but also for the reduction of the existing incentives, and proposes to invest more in public transport, walking and cycling. ==See also== *Energy in Norway *Centre for Renewable Energy *Electricity sector in Norway *Scotland-Norway interconnector *Renewable energy in Sweden *Renewable energy in Finland *Renewable energy in Denmark *Renewable energy in Iceland *Renewable energy by country == References  *Renewable energy in Norway - Nordic Energy Solutions (?) *RenewableEnergy.no (?) *Norwegian Centre for Renewable Energy (?) *Norway proposes sea-based wind power ","title":"Renewable energy in Norway"},{"id":"20445712","text":"Jado Hasanbegoviƒá (born January 8, 1948), is a retired Yugoslavian association football player who played in the North American Soccer League In 1975, Hasanbegoviƒá signed with the San Antonio Thunder.

He is most known as one of the founders of Gotan Project , which has brought together the broad universe of tango with electronic music. == Biography == It was in 1990 that Makaroff arrived in Paris to begin his French career, which followed an already rich career. in his own country: His first group was founded with his brother, Sergio, in the 1970s: Los hermanos Makaroff. Then, in the 1980s,he founded the duo \\"Edu y el Pollo\\" with Daniel Mactas. Makaroff has composed and performed film scores and television series credits. He has also presented and produced programs for television and radio. Upon his arrival in Paris, Makaroff formed the group Mano a Mano, with which he produced Tango Joyeux, an album that received a very warm welcome in France and throughout Europe. He later became the conductor of a famous Parisian tango club, La Coupole. Guitarist-singer-songwriter (he has several albums to his credit), he toured Europe with his group Tango Mano, while continuing to compose and produce music for the audiovisual industry. In 1999, Makaroff teamed up with Christoph H. M√ºller and Philippe Cohen-Solal to explore new musical routes and give a different direction to the traditional music of his home country: Gotan Project was born. Gotan Project's music has been released on many, many compilation albums and has been used in a large amount of feature films and TV series. Makaroff met another Argentinian in Paris, G√©rard Lo Monaco, to whom he gives some tango guitar lessons. Together, they create the label Ma√±ana, a label dedicated to the creation in Tango and to the development of Argentinean music in the world. In 2014, Makaroff and Christoph H. M√ºller form the group Plaza Francia with Catherine Ringer. They publish the album \\"A New Tango Song Book\\" followed by a tour which ended in November 2015. In 2018, M√ºller & Makaroff re-create Plaza Francia Orchestra and release the eponymous album with the participation of Catherine Ringer, Lura and Maria Muliterno, as well as Argentinean musicians Pablo Gignoli and Sebastian Volco .

The WOMAC has also been used to assess back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and fibromyalgia. It can be self-administered and was developed at Western Ontario and McMaster Universities in 1982. The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0‚Äì20), two for stiffness (score range 0‚Äì8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0‚Äì68). Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties. The questions on the WOMAC are a subset of the questions of the Hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS). Thus, a HOOS survey may also be used to determine a WOMAC score. A WOMAC test takes about 12 minutes, but is also available in a short form, (although this has not been as extensively tested as the full version). Versions of the WOMAC have also been developed that can be used in telephone or online surveys. It has been translated into more than 65 languages. The American College of Rheumatology notes that the test-retest reliability of the WOMAC varies for the pain, stiffness, and function subscales. The ACR says the pain subscale \\"has been variable across studies but generally meets the minimum standard.\\" Reliability for the physical function scale \\"has been more consistent and stronger... but the stiffness subscale has shown low test-retest reliability.\\" When used in clinical studies, the WOMAC pain and function subscales perform comparably or better than other tests in being responsive to change from experimental interventions, but this varies for the different subscales and types of intervention. An example of an arthritis study using the WOMAC found a significant dose‚Äìresponse relationship between 10% body weight loss (or gain) and clinically significant improvements (or declines) in WOMAC function and pain for people with osteoarthritis of the knee. ==See also== *Kellgren- Lawrence grading scale ==References Category:Arthritis Category:Musculoskeletal radiographic signs Category:Medical scoring system ","title":"WOMAC"},{"id":"20446024","text":"Andrew Gajda (February 26, 1907 ‚Äì June 4, 1956) was an American soccer player who was a member of the U.S. soccer team at the 1936 Summer Olympics.FIFA Player Profile At the time, he played for the Boston Soccer Football Club. ==References * Andrew Gajda's profile at Sports Reference.com Category:1907 births Category:1956 deaths Category:American soccer players Category:Olympic soccer players of the United States Category:Footballers at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Association footballers not categorized by position ","title":"Andrew Gajda"},{"id":"20446059","text":"James & Lister Lea was an architectural and property consultancy firm active in England between 1846 and 2001. Established by brothers James Lea and Lister Lea, the partnership was initially focused only on architecture.

Later in the firm's existence, it changed its name to James & Lister Lea and Sons. On 2 January 2001, the property consultancy firm merged with Bruton Knowles to produce a combined workforce of approximately 300 people. The firm had offices on Bull Street, Birmingham and also in Knowle, West Midlands, although the Knowle office was sold in 1999 to agricultural surveyors Smith- Woolley. In May 2000, James & Lister Lea revealed that they were looking at rebranding the company in the future. In December 2000, Bruton Knowles and James & Lister Lea agreed a merger that would become effective on 2 January 2001. The merger, which did not involve any exchange of money between the two companies, led to the formation of one of the largest property consultancy firms in Birmingham. As an architectural practice, the firm has been responsible for some of Birmingham's most recognisable public houses, many of which are now listed buildings. ==Notable works== *The Woodman, Albert Street, Birmingham (1896-7) *Swan and Mitre, Lichfield Road, Birmingham (1898-9) *The Market Tavern, Moseley Street, Birmingham (1899-1900) *The White Swan, Bradford Street, Digbeth, Birmingham (1899-1900) *Anchor Inn, Bradford Street, Digbeth, Birmingham (1901) *The Bartons Arms, High Street, Aston, Birmingham (1901) *City Tavern, Bishopsgate Street, Ladywood, Birmingham (1901) *The Red Lion, Soho Road, Birmingham (1901-2) *Aston Hippodrome, Potters Lane, Aston, Birmingham (1908; alterations in 1912.

Parry was born in Burton upon Trent. He was Brian Clough's first signing as manager of Hartlepool. He was a mainstay of the side which won promotion from the Fourth Division in the 1967‚Äì68 season, and won the club's inaugural Player of the Year award. In 1972 the club was on the brink of going out of business, needing to sell a player to survive, when Clough, by then manager of Derby County, bid ¬£2,500 for the player. It is usually regarded as a philanthropic gesture by Clough (albeit using Derby's money) as Parry made few appearances for Derby before moving on to Mansfield Town. He later played non-league football for Gresley Rovers, where he was Player of the Year in the 1982‚Äì83 season. In February 2009, Parry made a triumphant return to the North East as guest of honour at Hartlepool United's centenary dinner. Barry Butlin, Secretary & Treasurer of Derby County Former Players' Association, said: \\"It is fitting that Tony's fans at Hartlepool and in the North East had the opportunity to honour him at the 'Centenary' celebrations, and Tony was delighted to be greeted by his telly idol Jeff Stelling.\\" Parry died suddenly on 23 November 2009, following a short battle with pneumonia. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Burton upon Trent Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Burton Albion F.C. players Category:Hartlepool United F.C. players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Gresley F.C. players Category:Deaths from pneumonia ","title":"Tony Parry"},{"id":"20446088","text":"\\"Tiergarten\\" is a song written and performed by Canadian-American singer- songwriter Rufus Wainwright.

Satellites are another component of the system, providing global coverage through remote sensing; however, satellites measure light above the Earth's atmosphere, becoming subject to interference from the atmosphere itself and other light sources. The Marine Optical Buoy helps alleviate that interference and thus improve the quality of the overall ocean color observation system. ==Physical description== MOBY is a buoy 15 meters tall floating vertically in the water with approximately 3 meters above the surface and 12 meters below. A float canister is at water level, measuring approximately 2 meters high and 1.5 meters in diameter above the water, 1 meter in diameter below the water. Above the float canister are four solar panels and an antenna column. From the bottom of the float canister, a central column descends to a 2-meter-high, 1-meter-diameter instrument canister. Along the central column are three standoff arms measuring 3 meters long, 2.5 meters long, and 2 meters long, respectively. The standoff arms can be relocated up and down the central column during maintenance. Light collectors are at the ends of the standoff arms and at the top of the antenna column. The antenna column includes Global Positioning System (GPS), very high frequency (VHF), and cellular telephone antennas. Computers, communications, and control electronics occupy the float canister. A marine optical system (MOS), a power system, and batteries occupy the instrument canister. The MOS includes spectrographs with charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors, an optical multiplexer, and fiber optic sensor lines to the light collectors. MOBY has a tether to another buoy that is moored to the sea floor at a depth of about 1200 meters. MOBY is located at , west of Lanai, in the lee of the Hawaiian Islands. ==Function== Light from the Sun crosses space, enters and travels through the Earth's atmosphere, then enters the Earth's oceans. In the atmosphere and in the oceans, this light reflects from, refracts around, and absorbs into molecules and other objects. Some of this light leaves the water to again travel through the atmosphere and out into space, carrying the color of whatever it struck. At the sea surface, light coming down through the atmosphere enters the collector at the top of MOBY's antenna column. Each of MOBY's three submerged standoff arms has a pair of light collectors: one on top of the arm to collect downward moving light; and one underneath the arm to collect upward moving reflected light. Light entering the collectors travels through optical fibers and the optical multiplexer to the CCD detectors and spectrographs. The spectrographs record the light signals, and a computer stores the measurement data. The communications system aboard MOBY daily transmits much of the light measurement data to operators on shore. There is one Marine Optical Buoy operating in the water, and another in maintenance on shore. Every 3 to 4 months, a team exchanges the two buoys. The team calibrates each MOBY while it is in maintenance, both before deploying the buoy and after recovering it. Additionally, a team visits the MOBY in the water monthly, to clean algae, barnacles, and other organisms off the light collectors; and to generate independent comparison data using portable reference light sources. Each MOBY has internal reference light sources, as well, for continuous but not independent comparison. The MOBY calibration data traces to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) radiometric standards directly, as opposed to using intermediate standards. ==Contribution== MOBY has generated calibrated measurements of ocean color at the sea surface since 1996. MOBY served as the primary sea surface calibration for satellite borne sensors such as the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) and the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). MOBY has contributed to the calibration of the Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor (OCTS), the polarization detection environmental radiometer (POLDER), and the Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (IRS1-MOS). Long term sensors on the sea surface, such as MOBY, help improve the quality of the global ocean color observation system. ==References* *MOBY @ MLML *NIST Optical Technology Division News: Measuring Global Carbon Concentrations *NOAA's MOBY/MOCE project overview *BOUSSOLE: Buoy for the acquisition of long-term optical time series *IOCCG publications and reports *MOBY on NOSA Category:Satellite meteorology Category:Oceanographic instrumentation Category:Physical oceanography Category:Radiometry ","title":"Marine optical buoy"},{"id":"20446135","text":"Giorgos Theodoridis (; born 3 July 1980 in Frankfurt, West Germany) is a Greek international footballer who plays for Agrotikos Asteras F.C.. ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Frankfurt Category:Greek footballers Category:Greece international footballers Category:Greece under-21 international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Super League Greece players Category:2.

The project is a redevelopment of part of the Buckhead Village neighborhood bounded by Peachtree Rd., E. Paces Ferry Rd., Pharr Rd., and N. Fulton Drive. It is located just from two of the region's most prominent and upscale malls, Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza. ==History== In May 2011, San Diego-based OliverMcMillan Inc. purchased the land from Ben Carter Properties and began developing the project. The project was renamed that same month. In September 2011, McMillan announced a further delay in the project, and that construction would not begin until the end of the first quarter of 2012. McMillan intended to invest $300 million to complete the project in which Ben Carter had already invested $400 million. The total planned development was then targeted at 370 apartments, of retail space and of \\"boutique\\" office space.Rachel Tobin, \\"Streets of Buckhead ‚Äòrestart' delayed to next year\\", Atlanta Journal- Constitution, September 29, 2011 In early 2013 construction began after a hiatus of three years. As of July 2014 the project was nearing completion.\\"Buckhead Atlanta nears completion\\", Women's Wear Daily, July 14, 2014 In 1838, Henry Irby had purchased surrounding what is now Buckhead Village from Daniel Johnson for $650. Irby subsequently established a general store and tavern at the northwest corner of the Peachtree‚ÄìRoswell‚ÄìPaces Ferry intersection. To reverse a downturn in the Village during the 1980s, minimum parking spot requirements for bars were lifted, which quickly led to it becoming the most dense concentration of bars and clubs in the city, such as BAR, World Bar, Lulu's Bait Shack, Mako's, Tongue & Groove, Chaos and John Harvard's Brew House. By 1996 Buckhead Village nightlife was like \\"Mardi Gras, complete with nightly arrests, puking in the streets and [drunk] college girls\\".Scott Henry, \\"Buckhead Rising\\", Creative Loafing, 2006-05-31 By the late 1990s the clientele was changing, street cruising and \\"hanging\\" was common, and crime was increasing, sometimes violent. To ameliorate the situation, the Atlanta City Council passed an ordinance to close bars at 2:30 a.m. rather than 4 a.m., and liquor licenses were made more difficult to obtain or renew. Most of the bars and nightclubs closed between 2000 and 2007. In 2006‚Äì07, Ben Carter bought parcels in the area in order to develop the Streets of Buckhead. Demolition of existing structures began in August 2007. Original plans by developer Ben Carter Properties, LLC called for a $1.5 billion upscale mixed-use development. The Streets of Buckhead was dubbed \\"Atlanta's new upscale shopping\\", as it was to feature of exclusive shopping, 14 fine dining restaurants, two four-star hotels, 350 multimillion-dollar condominia and class-A office space. It aimed to be the most exclusive shopping area in the Southern United States. Originally scheduled for a grand opening of November 2009, by April 2009, work slowdowns pushed the projected opening back to Fall 2011. On May 2, 2011, San Diego-based OliverMcMillan Inc. purchased the land from Ben Carter Properties. Baupost Group LLC, a Boston hedge fund, is to provide $300 million of new equity. OliverMcMillan plans to change much of the original plans: they are \\"not seeking a Rodeo Drive-type development\\" and \\"the level of restaurants and retail might be somewhat different\\". It is to be an \\"urban village\\" woven into the Buckhead Community. The preliminary revised plans called for of retail and restaurants, of boutique offices and two 20-story luxury apartment buildings. Plans no longer include the two hotels. Rather than upscale restaurants, the development will target local chefs. A street grid system and street-level caf√©s and stores are to promote walkability. The first retailers and restaurants opened on September 18, 2014. ==Tenants== Buckhead Atlanta now includes 32 retail stores and restaurants with 12 more tenants set to open shop by the end of the year. * Akris * Alice + Olivia * Bella Bag * Billy Reid * Bonobos * Brunello Cucinelli * Canali * Christian Louboutin * Dior * Diptyque * Etro * Helmut Lang * Herm√®s *Hottie+Lord * Intermix * Jimmy Choo * Jonathan Adler * L'Occitane en Provence * La Perla * Moncler * Theory * Tod's * Tom Ford * Vilebrequin * Warby Parker ===Food and beverage=== * American Cut * Doraku Sushi * Fado Irish Pub * Georgetown Cupcake * Gypsy Kitchen * Le Bilboquet * Qing Mu * Shake Shack * The Southern Gentleman * Taverna ==See also== *List of shopping malls in the United States *Lenox Square *Phipps Plaza *King of Prussia (mall) *Bal Harbour Shops ==References== Category:Shopping malls in the Atlanta metropolitan area Category:Shopping districts and streets in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Atlanta Category:Buildings and structures under construction in the United States Category:Mixed-use developments in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Buckhead Atlanta"},{"id":"20446158","text":"The Rotliegend, Rotliegend Group or Rotliegendes () is a lithostratigraphic unit (a sequence of rock strata) of latest Carboniferous to Guadalupian (middle Permian) age that is found in the subsurface of large areas in western and central Europe. The Rotliegend mainly consists of sandstone layers. It is usually covered by the Zechstein and lies on top of regionally different formations of late Carboniferous age. The name Rotliegend has in the past not only been used to address the rock strata themselves, but also the time span in which they were formed (in which case the Rotliegend was considered a series or subsystem of the Permian). This time span corresponds roughly with the length of the Cisuralian epoch. ==Facies and formation== In large parts of Pangaea, the last phases of the Hercynian orogeny were still ongoing during the start of the Permian. At the same time local crustal extension formed intramontane basins such as the large Permian Basin which covered parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Denmark, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Netherlands. The early development of the basin went hand in hand with volcanism. Apart from these volcanic deposits the basin was filled by the erosional products of the Hercynian mountains to the south: mostly sands and gravels deposited under an arid and warm climate.Ziegler (1990), p. 71 ==Stratigraphy== In the north of Germany and in the Netherlands, the Rotliegend is usually subdivided into two groups: a Lower Rotliegend Group (mostly volcanic rocks: tuffs and basaltic lavas) and an Upper Rotliegend Group (sandstones and siltstones). During the formation of the lower group the basin was still small and the deposition was restricted to the centre of the basin in the southeastern North Sea and northern Germany, this group is very limited in thickness in the Dutch subsurface. The upper group has a larger arial distribution since the basin had grown wider. In Dutch lithostratigraphy, the Rotliegend lies on top of the late Carboniferous Limburg Group and below the Zechstein Group. The Upper Rotliegend Group is divided in the Silverpit Formation and Slochteren Formation, the last is an important reservoir for hydrocarbons. The German Bentheim Sandstone, which crops out in the M√ºnsterland, is part of the Slochteren Formation. The Rotliegend of northern Germany is continuous with that of the Netherlands. In other parts of Germany contemporaneous basins exist, such as the Saar-Nahe Basin, the Wetterau or the Saale Basin. The Rotliegend of these different intramontane basins is not easy to correlate and the lithostratigraphy of each basin has its own divisions (groups and formations). ===Notes=Literature=== *Gradstein, F.M.; Ogg, J.G. & Smith, A.G.; 2004: A Geologic Time Scale 2004, Cambridge University Press *Ziegler, P.A.; 1990 (2nd ed.): Geological Atlas of Western and Central Europe, Shell Internationale Petroleum Maatschappij BV, .

Spikes in approval coincide with the September 11 attacks, the invasion of Iraq, and the capture of Saddam Hussein. The rally 'round the flag effect (or syndrome) is a concept used in political science and international relations to explain increased short-run popular support of a country's government or political leaders during periods of international crisis or war.Goldstein, Joshua S.; Pevehouse, Jon C. (2008). International Relations: Eighth Edition. New York: Pearson Longman. Because the effect can reduce criticism of governmental policies, it can be seen as a factor of diversionary foreign policy. == Mueller's definition == Political scientist John Mueller suggested the effect in 1970, in a paper called \\"Presidential Popularity from Truman to Johnson\\". He defined it as coming from an event with three qualities: #\\"Is international\\" #\\"Involves the United States and particularly the President directly\\" #\\"Specific, dramatic, and sharply focused\\" In addition, Mueller created five categories of rallies. These categories are considered dated by modern political scientists, as they rely heavily on Cold War events. Mueller's five categories are: #Sudden US military intervention (e.g., Korean War, Bay of Pigs Invasion) #Major diplomatic actions (e.g., Truman Doctrine) #Dramatic technological developments (e.g., Sputnik) #US-Soviet summit meetings (e.g., Potsdam Conference) #Major military developments in ongoing wars (e.g., Tet Offensive) == Causes and duration == Since Mueller's original theories, two schools of thought have emerged to explain the causes of the effect. The first, \\"The Patriotism School of Thought\\" holds that in times of crisis, the American public sees the President as the embodiment of national unity. The second, \\"The Opinion Leadership School\\" believes that the rally emerges from a lack of criticism from members of the opposition party, most often in the United States Congress. If opposition party members appear to support the president, the media has no conflict to report, thus it appears to the public that all is well with the performance of the president. The two theories have both been criticized, but it is generally accepted that the Patriotism School of thought is better to explain causes of rallies, while the Opinion Leadership School of thought is better to explain duration of rallies. It is also believed that the lower the presidential approval rating before the crisis, the larger the increase will be in terms of percentage points because it leaves the president more room for improvement. For example, Franklin Roosevelt only had a 12% increase in approval from 72% to 84% following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, whereas George W. Bush had a 39% increase from 51% to 90% following the September 11 attacks. Another theory about the cause of the effect is believed to be embedded in the US Constitution. Unlike in other countries, the constitution makes the President both head of government and head of state. Because of this, the president receives a temporary boost in popularity because his Head of State role gives him symbolic importance to the American people. However, as time goes on his duties as Head of Government require partisan decisions that polarize opposition parties and diminish popularity. This theory falls in line more with the Opinion Leadership School. Due to the highly statistical nature of presidential polls, University of Alabama political scientist John O'Neal has approached the study of rally 'round the flag using mathematics. O'Neal has postulated that the Opinion Leadership School is the more accurate of the two using mathematical equations. These equations are based on quantified factors such as the number of headlines from the New York Times about the crisis, the presence of bipartisan support or hostility, and prior popularity of the president.. Political Scientist from The University of California Los Angeles, Matthew A. Baum found that the source of a rally 'round the flag effect is from independents and members of the opposition party shifting their support behind the President after the rallying effect. Baum also found that when the country is more divided or in a worse economic state then the rally effect is larger. This is because more people who are against the president before the rallying event switch to support him afterwards. When the country is divided before the rallying event there is a higher potential increase in support for the President after the rallying event. In a study by Political Scientist Terrence L. Chapman and Dan Reiter, rallies in Presidential approval ratings were found to be bigger when there was U.N. Security Council supported Militarized interstate disputes (MIDs). Having U.N. Security Council support was found to increase the rally effect in presidential approval by 8 to 9 points compared to when there was not U.N. Security Council support. According to a 2019 study of ten countries in the period 1990‚Äì2014, there is evidence of a rally-around-the-flag effect early on in an intervention with military casualties (in at least the first year) but voters begin to punish the governing parties after 4.5 years. == Historical examples in the U.S. == The effect has been examined within the context of nearly every major foreign policy crisis since World War II. Some notable examples: *Cuban Missile Crisis: According to Gallup polls, President John F. Kennedy's approval rating in early October 1962 was at 61%. By November, after the crisis had passed, Kennedy's approval rose to 74%. The spike in approval peaked in December 1962 at 76%. Kennedy's approval rating slowly decreased again until it reached the pre-crisis level of 61% in June 1963. *Iran hostage crisis: According to Gallup polls, President Jimmy Carter quickly gained 26 percentage points, jumping from 32 to 58% approval following the initial seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November 1979. However, Carter's handling of the crisis caused popular support to decrease, and by November 1980 Carter had returned to his pre-crisis approval rating.. *Operation Desert Storm (Persian Gulf War): According to Gallup polls, President George H. W. Bush was rated at 59% approval in January 1991, but following the success of Operation Desert Storm, Bush enjoyed a peak 89% approval rating in February 1991. From there, Bush's approval rating slowly decreased, reaching the pre-crisis level of 61% in October 1991. *Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, President George W. Bush received an unprecedented increase in his approval rating. On September 10, Bush had a Gallup Poll rating of 51%. By September 15, his approval rate had increased by 34 percentage points to 85%. Just a week later, Bush was at 90%, the highest presidential approval rating ever. Over a year after the attacks occurred, Bush still received higher approval than he did before 9/11 (68% in November 2002). Both the size and duration of Bush's popularity after 9/11 are believed to be the largest of any post-crisis boost. Many people believe that this popularity gave Bush a mandate and eventually the political leverage to begin the War in Iraq. *Death of Osama bin Laden: According to Gallup polls, President Barack Obama received a 6% jump in his Presidential approving ratings, jumping from 46% in the three days before the mission (April 29 ‚Äì May 1) to a 52% in the 3 days after the mission (May 2‚Äì4). The rally effect did not last long, as Obama's approval ratings were back down to 46% by June 30. == In a pandemic == President Donald Trump's approval rating saw a slight increase during the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. In addition to Trump, other heads of government in Europe also gained in popularity. French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became \\"very popular\\" in the weeks following the pandemic hitting their respective nations.

These fears come from the \\"diversionary theory of war\\" in which the President creates an international crisis in order to distract from domestic affairs and to increase their approval ratings through a rally 'round the flag effect. The fear associated with this theory is that a President can create international crisis to avoid dealing with serious domestic issues or to increase their approval rating when it begins to drop. == See also == *Battle Cry of Freedom, an American Civil War song that urged union supporters to \\"rally 'round the flag\\", that was also used for Abraham Lincoln's re-election campaign. *United States presidential approval rating. == References == Category:Conformity Category:Diversionary tactics Category:Opinion polling in the United States Category:Legal terminology from popular culture Category:Politics of the United States Category:Propaganda ","title":"Rally 'round the flag effect"},{"id":"20446448","text":"Vanessa Karen White (born 30 October 1989) is an English singer-songwriter, dancer and actress.

It was located in Nottinghamshire, to the west of the River Trent, approximately north of the village of Marnham. High Marnham was the most southerly of three power stations which lined the River Trent, known locally as Megawatt Valley, the others being West Burton and Cottam. It was the first 1000 MW [946 MW net] power station built and commissioned in Europe, and operated at higher boiler pressure and temperature values than previously commissioned plant. ==Construction== High Marnham was first proposed in 1953 by design engineer Stanley Brown. The station was constructed by the Central Electricity Generating Board Northern Project Group, on a green field site. Work started in 1954, with groundworks on the site of Barks Farm, which was demolished the following year. The main civil engineering practice for the construction was Freeman Fox & Partners. The work was overseen by resident engineer Douglas Derbyshire and the main contractor Alfred McAlpine. The station was commissioned in 1959 and was fully operational by June 1962. The plant was officially opened in October 1962 by Sir Stanley Brown (F.H.S. Brown), now the deputy chairman of the CEGB. ==Boiler plant== The plant was designed and built by International Combustion Ltd. Five boiler units, each weighing about 14,000 tons, were suspended on beams and support columns, for a vertical expansion of . Each boiler was built in twin furnace construction with 1.5 inch (38mm) bore tubes, all connected to a common drum at the top of the boiler, and fitted with safety valves set at . One furnace carried the superheat pendants, connected to the boiler drum top and to an outlet header, fitted with a safety valve set at . The second furnace carried the reheat pendants connected to an inlet header from the HP cylinder exhaust and to an outlet header to the turbine IP cylinder. The lower section of the furnace corners contained a wind box with the pulverised fuel nozzles and retractable oil burners. Fuel nozzles and burners were aligned at an imaginary circle in the furnace ensuring an even heat distribution. Pulverised fuel nozzles were provided with vertical movement to control temperature conditions. At the bottom of each furnace, the front and rear wall tubes were formed into an inward slope where the tubes were bent back (forming a nose and gap) to their original vertical wall alignment terminating at their front and rear bottom furnace water tube headers. A steel skirt was fitted around each furnace base. Water circulation within the boiler furnace was assisted by fully immersed electrical pumps manufactured by Hayward Tyler Co. Four Lopulco coal roller mills with pulverised coal fans per boiler were located in the boiler house basement. Coal was fed from overhead bunkers by speed-regulated drum feeders to the mills and crushed to fine dust by three 7.5 ton roller drums per mill, then blown into the wind boxes through pipework and the PF nozzles. Combustion air was delivered by two forced draught fans located above the coal bunkers, taking warm air from above the boiler roof casing and discharging it though rotating heat exchangers to the furnace wind boxes. Hot gas was drawn from the furnaces through the pendants, water tube economisers, rotating heat exchanger, cyclone dust collectors and electrostatic precipitators by two induced draught fans before entering the chimney flue ducts and passing up the high chimneys. Heavy combustion products fell into basement mounted hoppers with water troughs under each furnace that engaged with the bottom furnace header casing skirt. The hoppers were emptied by a water jet/sluice arrangement into an ash receiving pit. Cooling towers in June 2006 ==Boiler water feed system== Condensed steam was taken from the turbine condenser and pumped back into the boiler feed system, via the unit evaporator, low and high pressure water tube heaters (after being subjected to bled steam heat from turbine cylinders) into a de-aerator. The de-aerated water was taken by the main feed pump (multi stage cartridge design pump or a smaller start up pump) and discharged at into the boiler water feed system through feed regulating valves. Both feed pump types were electric motor driven. Additional station boiler feed water supply could also be made up by the station water treatment plant and fed into the de-aerator, this was operated and controlled by the station chemistry department. ==Turbine/generator plant== Designed and built by the English Electric Co., five steam turbine units of high pressure, intermediate pressure and double-flow low pressure turbine cylinders were coupled to 200 MW generators. The steam flow into the turbine was regulated by the hydraulically controlled steam inlet valves to maintain a generating speed of 3000 RPM. The turbine over-speed protection was by weight eccentric rings on the turbine shaft, set to throw-out at a predetermined RPM and shutting the high pressure cylinder inlet steam valves. Exhaust flow from the HP turbine cylinders passed to the boiler for reheating (with some having been bled off to feed heaters), returned to the intermediate pressure cylinder (with some bled off to low pressure feed heaters) and exhausted from the double-flow LP cylinder under vacuum into underslung water-cooled condensers. Condenser cooling water was delivered from a sub-basement ring main around the turbine house. The turbine/generator assembly was mounted on reinforced concrete pedestals that ran along the length of the turbine hall. High Marnham was one of the CEGB‚Äôs twenty steam power stations with the highest thermal efficiency; in 1963‚Äì4 the thermal efficiency was 33.66 per cent, 33.31 per cent in 1964‚Äì5, and 32.93 per cent in 1965‚Äì6. The annual electricity output of High Marnham was:CEGB Annual report and Accounts, 1961, 1962 & 1963 {  +Electricity output of High Marnham !Year 1960‚Äì1 1961‚Äì2 1962‚Äì3 1963‚Äì4 1964‚Äì5 1965‚Äì6 1971‚Äì2 1978‚Äì9 1980‚Äì1 1981‚Äì2 - !Electricity supplied, GWh 1,306 3,609 4,472 5,080 5,184 5,569 4,246 3,264 3,945 3,619 } ==National Grid== On 15 December 1963, the first 400kV supergrid link in the UK's National Grid was switched on between the power station and the Monk Fryston substation, near the Selby Fork on the A63 road towards Fairburn, North Yorkshire - a distance of 64 miles. This line was mainly experimental; the 420-ton transformers at either end were from English Electric at Stafford. The main 400kV supergrid was not switched on until around 1965, with the 4ZA power line (Grendon to Elstree). E.ON sign in February 2008 ==Cooling water plant== Cooling water pumps were located between cooling towers in a purpose made building to deliver cooling water into a ring main for the turbine condensers. The warm water was passed on through to the five cooling towers, falling into the tower moats to be channelled back through screens and a chlorination process to the pump suctions for recirculation. Water loss through evaporation was made up from the river Trent by suction screened pumps. It required around 27 million gallons of water an hour. ==Coal plant== High Marnham power station was supplied with coal via the 14-mile High Marnham branch off the Mansfield to Worksop line (later marketed as the Robin Hood railway line). Prior to their closure Thorsby, Welbeck, Ollerton, Bevercotes, Clipstone, Mansfield, Rufford, Blidworth and Blisthorpe collieries were also connected to the High Marnham Branch. Rail facilities at High Marnham included weighbridges, sidings and coal hoppers, a control room, coal wagon marshalling yard and conveyor systems. In about 1965 a \\"merry-go-round\\" system of automatic coal wagon unloading was installed to evaluate for future \\"Stations Systems\\". Bunker coal supply ran from the coal plant on inclined conveyors to the boiler house, where it was fed onto a moving \\"feed head\\" conveyor above the individual boiler coal bunkers. The plant burnt around 10,000 tonnes of coal a day. When it was commissioned in October 1962 it was the largest power station in Europe, consuming coal from 17 collieries. The two chimneys were 450 ft high.Nottingham Evening Post, October 1962 A pipeline was built to take ash across the Trent five miles to former gravel pits at Besthorpe, Nottinghamshire. ==Closure and demolition== Demolition of chimneys on 15 December 2004 The station closed in 2003 after nearly 45 years in operation, with a loss of 119 jobs. The station's chimneys were demolished on 15 December 2004. The station's -high boiler house was demolished on 5 October 2006. The station's five cooling towers were demolished on 15 July 2012 at 10:00. In late 2009, the railway connection that used to supply coal to the power station became Network Rail's High Marnham Test Track for innovation and development, suited to this purpose because the line consists of continuously welded rail on concrete sleepers. ==References * 28 Days Later - photos of the station mid-demolition. * Additional Photographs From Industrial Britain * High Marnham Signal Box Category:Bassetlaw District Category:Buildings and structures in Nottinghamshire Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2012 Category:2003 disestablishments in England Category:Coal-fired power stations in England Category:Demolished power stations in the United Kingdom Category:1959 establishments in England Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1962 Category:Power stations in the East Midlands ","title":"High Marnham Power Station"},{"id":"20446702","text":"The 1982 Greenlandic European Communities membership referendum was a referendum that took place on 23 February 1982, over whether Greenland should continue to be a member of the European Communities (EC).

Formerly an independent municipality, Sonnenberg was incorporated into Wiesbaden on 28 October 1926. The borough has approximately 8,000 residents. Sonnenberg is located in the northeast of the city. Its historic center is located in the foothills of the Taunus in the narrow valley of Rambach. Burg Sonnenberg (Sonnenberg Castle) is situated on a mountain spur above the town. While the castle is now in ruins, the castle tower and parts of the fortifications and the city walls are preserved to a large extent. ==History of Sonnenberg Castle== 290pxSonnenberg Castle was built around 1201-1203 by the brothers Henry II (German: Heinrich) and Robert IV (German: Ruprecht), Counts of the House of Nassau, for the protection of Wiesbaden against the neighboring Lords of Eppstein, with whom a permanent border dispute existed. Friedrich I had awarded the Royal City of Wiesbaden to the House of Nassau in 1154 as a reward for their support. Wiesbaden had been a royal city since the reign of Charlemagne, first mentioned in 829 as an administrative headquarters of a K√∂nigssondergau (Imperial special district). However, the court system for the region came under the dominion of Eppstein. This complicated arrangement, where both houses claimed jurisdiction, gave rise to constant strife between them. The first written mention of Sonnenberg dates from 1208 or 1209 in the name of the first Burgmann (\\"castellan\\") Ulbert of Idstein-Sonnenberg as Sonnenburch and Sunnenberc. It was first called Sonnenberc in 1221. Ownership of the land was initially disputed by the Saint Martin's Domstift (cathedral endowment) of Mainz. This dependence to Mainz had been generally unfavorable to Sonnenberg a long time, because four Archbishops of Mainz in the 13th century alone were from Eppstein, the enemies of Nassau. The dispute over Sonnenberg was settled by a treaty in 1221, in which Nassau obtained the land on which the castle is built as a fief for 30 Marks.History of Sonnenberg (in German) Sonnenberg Castle was one of nine castles ruled by the House of Nassau. In 1240, Henry II became the sole ruler of the Nassau possessions. After his death, the inheritance was divided among Henry's sons, Walram and Otto. Sonnenberg became the possession of Walram's Countship of Nassau-Weilburg. In 1283, Walram's son Count Adolf of Nassau rebuilt the castle (it had been heavily damaged in conflict with Eppstein). The castle was Adolf's seat when he was crowned King of the Romans on 5 May 1292. After Adolf's death in 1298, Eppstein, with the help of Archbishop of Mainz, Gerhard II, again occupied and destroyed the castle. Adolf's son, Gerlach I, still a child, was saved. Ruins of Sonnenberg, steel engraving from \\"Views of the Rhine\\" by 285pxLater, under Gerlach's rule, peace was reached between Nassau and Eppstein and the Castle of Sonnenberg was expanded. In 1338, Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian visited the castle, a testimony to its size and security in those years. On 29 July 1351 the King of Bohemia, and later Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV awarded the town of Sonnenberg rights to its own jurisdiction. As a result, houses at the foot of the castle could now be surrounded by a wall in an overall integrated complex, providing the residents some security. When Count Gerlach died in 1361, his son Ruprecht (from his second marriage), since 1355 Count of the newly established dominion of Nassau-Sonnenberg, inherited the castle. When Ruprecht died childless in 1390, his wife Anna continued to live there. After her death in 1405, the castle returned to the joint rule of the Counts of Nassau-Idstein and Nassau-Weilburg and deteriorated over the next 200 years. However, under Count Philipp von Nassau-Idstein (1558 to 1566), the castle again became a residence. He, too, died childless and the end of the 16th century the castle was uninhabited. Sonnenberg experienced major damage in 1625 during the Thirty Years' War, so that only a dozen houses were habitable. The castle served as a quarry for the reconstruction of the houses in the valley. In 1672, the city was again devastated by troops of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. ==Thalkirche== 290pxThe Thalkirche (Valley Church) of Sonnenberg dates to 1429, when Werner Hut, Lord of the Castle, endowed the chapel of Saint Mary in the Valley. In 1529, Johann von Nassau-Sporkenburg, heir to the Hut family, opened the former private chapel to the residents of Sonnenberg. The church was expanded in 1535 and became Protestant in 1540. Due to damage incurred during the Thirty Years' War in 1625, the church was unusable. Services were held in the Holy Cross Chapel in the Sonnenberg Cemetery for decades afterward. The church was looted by the soldiers of Brandenburg in 1672. A gallery was added in 1733. In 1883, there was a thorough renovation of the church. The pulpit was moved to a position in the center above the altar, where it stands today.Short History of the Valley Church (in German) ==References Pictures == File:2010-03-02 Herz-Jesu-Kirche Wiesbaden-Sonnenberg 02.jpgFront of Saint-John's-Church File:2010-03-02 Herz-Jesu-Kirche Wiesbaden-Sonnenberg 01.jpgRear-view of Saint-John's-Church ==Sources== * Derived from German Wikipedia Category:Boroughs of Wiesbaden ","title":"Wiesbaden-Sonnenberg"},{"id":"20446747","text":"6th of October (October 6) is the 279th day of the year in the Gregorian calendar.

It has facilities for user-defined operator syntax, macros, arbitrary-precision arithmetic (multiple-precision numbers), and compiling to native code through the LLVM. Pure is free and open-source software distributed (mostly) under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later. Pure comes with an interpreter and debugger, provides automatic memory management, has powerful functional and symbolic programming abilities, and interfaces to libraries in C (e.g., for numerics, low-level protocols, and other such tasks). At the same time, Pure is a small language designed from scratch; its interpreter is not large, and the library modules are written in Pure. The syntax of Pure resembles that of Miranda and Haskell, but it is a free-format language and thus uses explicit delimiters (rather than off-side rule indents) to denote program structure. The Pure language is a successor of the equational programming language Q, previously created by the same author, Albert Gr√§f at the University of Mainz, Germany. Relative to Q, it offers some important new features (such as local functions with lexical scoping, efficient vector and matrix support, and the built-in C interface) and programs run much faster as they are compiled just-in-time to native code on the fly. Pure is mostly aimed at mathematical applications and scientific computing currently, but its interactive interpreter environment, the C interface and the growing set of addon modules make it suitable for a variety of other applications, such as artificial intelligence, symbolic computation, and real-time multimedia processing. Pure plug-ins are available for the Gnumeric spreadsheet and Miller Puckette's Pure Data graphical multimedia software, which make it possible to extend these programs with functions written in the Pure language. Interfaces are also provided as library modules to GNU Octave, OpenCV, OpenGL, the GNU Scientific Library, FAUST, SuperCollider, and liblo (for Open Sound Control (OSC)). ==Examples== The Fibonacci numbers (naive version): fib 0 = 0; fib 1 = 1; fib n = fib (n-2) + fib (n-1) if n>1; Better (tail-recursive and linear-time) version: fib n = fibs (0,1) n with fibs (a,b) n = if n<=0 then a else fibs (b,a+b) (n-1); end; Compute the first 20 Fibonacci numbers: map fib (1..20); An algorithm for the n queens problem which employs a list comprehension to organize the backtracking search: queens n = search n 1 [] with search n i p = [reverse p] if i>n; = cat [search n (i+1) ((i,j):p)  j = 1..n; safe (i,j) p]; safe (i,j) p = ~any (check (i,j)) p; check (i1,j1) (i2,j2) = i1==i2  j1==j2  i1+j1==i2+j2  i1-j1==i2-j2; end; While Pure uses eager evaluation by default, it also supports lazy data structures such as streams (lazy lists). For instance, David Turner's algorithmTurner, David A. SASL language manual. Tech. rept. CS/75/1. Department of Computational Science, University of St. Andrews 1975. for computing the stream of prime numbers by trial division can be expressed in Pure: primes = sieve (2..inf) with sieve (p:qs) = p : sieve [q  q = qs; q mod p] &; end; Use of the \`&\` operator turns the tail of the sieve into a thunk to delay its computation. The thunk is evaluated implicitly and then memoized (using call by need evaluation) when the corresponding part of the list is accessed, e.g.: primes!!(0..99); // yields the first 100 primes Pure has efficient support for vectors and matrices (similar to that of MATLAB and GNU Octave), including vector and matrix comprehensions. E.g., a Gaussian elimination algorithm with partial pivoting can be implemented in Pure thus: gauss_elimination x::matrix = p,x when n,m = dim x; p,_,x = foldl step (0..n-1,0,x) (0..m-1) end; step (p,i,x) j = if max_x==0 then p,i,x else // updated row permutation and index: transp i max_i p, i+1, {// the top rows of the matrix remain unchanged: x!!(0..i-1,0..m-1); // the pivot row, divided by the pivot element: {x!(i,l)/x!(i,j)  l=0..m-1}; // subtract suitable multiples of the pivot row: when n,m = dim x; max_i, max_x = pivot i (col x j); x = if max_x>0 then swap x i max_i else x; end with pivot i x = foldl max (0,0) [j,abs (x!j)j=i..#x-1]; max (i,x) (j,y) = if x As a language based on term rewriting, Pure fully supports symbolic computation with expressions. Here is an example showing the use of local rewriting rules to expand and factor simple arithmetic expressions: expand = reduce with (a+b)*c = a*c+b*c; a*(b+c) = a*b+a*c; end; factor = reduce with a*c+b*c = (a+b)*c; a*b+a*c = a*(b+c); end; expand ((a+b)*2); // yields a*2+b*2 factor (a*2+b*2); // yields (a+b)*2 Calling C functions from Pure is very easy. E.g., the following imports the \`puts\` function from the C library and uses it to print the string \`\\"Hello, world!\\"\` on the terminal: extern int puts(char*); hello = puts \\"Hello, world!\\"; hello; ==See also== * Functional programming * Functional languages * Clean (programming language) == References == * Albert Gr√§f. \\"Signal Processing in the Pure Programming Language\\".

He is currently signed to G-Unit Records. == Career == In 2007 his manager and DJ Green Lantern introduced Uncle Murda's music to Jay-Z. The Brooklyn-born rapper/CEO signed Uncle Murda to Roc-A-Fella Records soon after. They started to promote him immediately by placing him on a track with popular label-mates Fabolous and Jay-Z for the song \\"Brooklyn\\" (featured on From Nothin' to Somethin' album) and everything seemed to be going well for the rapper. However in late 2008 rumors that Uncle Murda left Def Jam came about. In an interview with DJ Vlad, Uncle Murda confirmed the rumors that he has split from Def Jam and Roc- A-Fella Records claiming everything went downhill since Jay-Z's departure. On November 8, 2016, Uncle Murda signed a deal with 50 Cent and G-Unit Records. ===Shooting=== On January 22, 2008, Uncle Murda was shot directly in the head while in a parked car on Linden Blvd. in East New York, but was not seriously hurt. The shooting happened after the rapper released his mixtape entitled \\"Respect the Shooter\\". He discharged himself from the hospital less than 24 hours after he was admitted, with the bullet still embedded in his skull. Uncle Murda called the nationally syndicated The Wendy Williams Experience radio show after the shooting and told her he was using \\"Hennessy and Newports to cope with the pain\\". No charges were filed, as Uncle Murda refused to cooperate with investigators, blaming the police for the shooting. == Discography  Mixtapes === *2005: Murder Capitol *2006: Say Uncle: 2 Hard For Hip-Hop *2006: Respect The Shooter *2007: Murda Muzik *2008: Hard To Kill *2008: Back On My Bullshit *2008: Rudy King *2008: Murda Muzik 2: Return Of The Bad Guy *2009: Summer Time Shootouts *2013: The First 48 *2013: Murda Muzik 3 *2014: Ain't Nothin' Sweet *2016: Yellow Tape (with Maino) *2017: Don't Come Outside, Vol. 1 *2020: Don't Come Outside, Vol. 2 * 2021 Don‚Äôt Come Outside Vol.3 * Shoot the police TBA * TBA (With Tony Yayo) ===Singles=== *2007: \\"Bullet Bullet\\" *2007: \\"Run The City\\" *2007: \\"Children's Story\\" *2007: \\"Hard to Kill\\" *2008: \\"Still Run The City\\" *2008: \\"Anybody Can Get It\\" (original song made and featured in Grand Theft Auto IV) *2009: \\"Murdera\\" (featuring Akon) *2011: \\"Warning\\" *2011: \\"Warning (Remix)\\" (featuring French Montana, Jadakiss, Styles P, Jim Jones, Vado and Cam'ron) *2011: \\"Warning (Remix)\\" (featuring 50 Cent, Mariah Carey and Young Jeezy) *2012: \\"Money Work\\" (featuring French Montana) *2013: \\"9's and 45's\\" *2014: \\"Yearly Rap Up\\" *2015: \\"Body Dance\\" (featuring Bobby Shmurda) *2015: \\"Right Now\\" (featuring Future) *2016: \\"Thot\\" (featuring Young M.A and Dios Moreno) *2017: \\"On & On\\" (featuring 50 Cent and Jeremih) *2018: \\"Get the Strap\\" (featuring Casanova, 6ix9ine and 50 Cent) *2018: \\"Hold Up\\" (featuring Dave East *2019: \\"It Hit Different\\" *2019: \\"Who The Boss Is\\" *2019: \\"God I F With You\\" *2019: \\"Dope Money\\" ===Guest appearances=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of non-single guest appearances, with other performing artists, showing year released and album name ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:22em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Other artist(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Album - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Code of the Streets\\" 2006  DJ Kay Slay & Greg Street, Lakey The Kid, Maino, Pistol Pete, Prinz  The Champions: North Meets South - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Ya Heard\\" rowspan=\\"5\\"2007  French Montana  - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"En Why Cee\\"  Juganot, Tess, Joell Ortiz  - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Brooklyn\\"  Fabolous, Jay-Z  From Nothin' to Somethin' - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"G Shit\\"  Statik Selektah, Jadakiss, Sev-One, Termanology  - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Let it Off\\"  Memphis Bleek  - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Shooters For Hire\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"2008  Tony Yayo  Black Friday - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Don't Take It There  Papoose, Junior Reid, Tony Yayo, Jim Jones, Sheek Louch  - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Who Shot Ya 2009\\" rowspan=\\"7\\"2009  Maino, Red Cafe  - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"MurderGram 2k9\\"  Busta Rhymes, Maino, Red Cafe  - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"My Way Or Nothing\\"  Lloyd Banks  5 & Better Series vol 4 - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Stick Up Muzik\\"  Raekwon, Busta Rhymes  - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"My Hood\\"  Capone-N-Noreaga, Clipse, Tha Dogg Pound, Maino  Channel 10 - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Director's Cut\\"  Busta Rhymes  I Bullshit You Not - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Watch How You Talk\\"  Busta Rhymes, Raekwon, The Game  - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Kay Slayed'em\\" rowspan=\\"6\\"2010  DJ Kay Slay, Mistah F.A.B., Grafh  More Than Just a DJ - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Live By the Gun\\"  Waka Flocka Flame, Ra Diggs  Flockaveli - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"That Work\\"  Vado, DJ Suss One, Cassidy, Joell Ortiz, French Montana  The Feature Presentation Album - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Pablo Doe\\"  Styles P, N.O.R.E.

The area is bound by Notre Dame Ave. to the north, Ellice Ave. to the south, Donald St. to the east and Balmoral St. to the west. Everything within the neighbourhood's one-kilometre loop can be reached within eight minutes on foot. The neighbourhood is home to the largest concentration of Black Canadians in Manitoba, mostly African immigrants and refugees. 70 per cent of all refugees coming to Winnipeg live downtown, largely settling in and around the Central Park area. It's one of Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhoods with around 13,755 people per square km according to Statistics Canada's 2001 Census. ==Culture and Entertainment== Central Park is a highly diverse neighbourhood. There is a large Filipino, African, and Aboriginal population in the neighbourhood. Because of the growing African population, the area has been transforming in recent years, giving it a new sense of community and culture. Its Central Market for Global Families is a summer outdoor market that sells handmade and imported African clothing, beadwork, handicrafts, weavings, art, as well as organic produce. Live entertainment fills the air in Central Park on warm Friday nights throughout the summer and are a significant aspect to the markets on Saturday. Special events attract hundreds of people to the park on World Refugee Day in June, HIV/AIDS Awareness Day in July and Central Park Revival. ==Demographics== In 2016, the population of Central Park was 3,775 people, and a population density of 16,221.9 people per square km. Central Park is a lower-income neighbourhood, with a median household income of $25,574, compared to the city's median household income of $68,331. 17.9% of Central Park residents are of Aboriginal Identity, 17.6% are of Aboriginal Ancestry, and 66.2% are other visible minorities. The most represented of which are Black (28.2%) and Filipino (22.5%). As of 2016, 32.9% of Central Park's population are not Canadian citizens, which is above average for the City of Winnipeg as a whole, which is 11.7%. Central Park also boasts a higher percentage of recent immigrants (24.9%) than the city as a whole (7.5%). ==Crime== Central Park has a higher crime rate than the city as a whole. In 2012, there was one homicide making the rate per 100,000 residents 28.1. For other crimes, the rates per 100,000 follow as; 2025.3 for robbery, 84.4 for sexual assaults, 534.5 for break and enters and 281.3 for auto thefts.http://www.winnipeg.ca/crimestat/ ==Architecture== Buildings around Central Park feature a diverse range of architectural styles and densities, coexisting with various shops and services. The YMCA building, Knox United Church, Calvary Temple, and a number of area schools provide a strong institutional component for families and senior citizens. Other landmark buildings are The International Centre, Welcome Place, and Edohei, considered to be Manitoba's first sushi restaurant. ==Park History== Central Park was one of Winnipeg's first four parks, then referred to as \\"ornamented squares and breathing areas\\". The land for it was purchased by the city from the Hudson's Bay Company for $20,000 in 1893. The land for the park was swampy in summer and had a significant amount of unusable ground. Thousands of loads of manure and soil were brought in, which caused subsequent settling, but also was responsible for lush lawns and gardens. A bandstand and two tennis courts were added to the park in 1905, and an iron fence and drinking fountain were added in 1909. The Waddell fountain was added to the park in 1914. Playground equipment was added in 1936 and restrooms in 1959. In 1985, the city closed off a section of Qu'Appelle street, expanding the park to Ellice Avenue. The master plan was originally intended to link Central Park to the Manitoba Legislature grounds, but was abandoned at the development of North Portage and Portage Place mall from 1985‚Äì1987. This addition brought the park up to 4.8 acres in size. The park was renovated between 2008 and 2012, with designs by the architecture firm Scatliff+Miller+Murray. The project won the 2015 Premier's Award for Design Excellence Award of Merit in Landscape Architecture. ===Waddell Fountain=== The Waddell Fountain in Central Park is a rare example of the High Victorian Gothic style in Manitoba, and is based on the Scott Monument, an 1844 Gothic Revival monument in Edinburgh for Romantic poet Sir Walter Scott. The fountain commemorates Emily Margaret Waddell, who died in 1908. Her will was written in 1904 but only discovered in 1911. In it, Emily Waddell stipulated, \\"in case of his marrying again, ten thousand dollars is to be expended for public fountain in Central park, Winnipeg.\\". Thomas Waddell, who did remarry, raised the money in 1914 and chose the design by local architect John Manuel. Manuel also designed structures at the University of Manitoba, and would later move to Alberta in 1927 to oversee construction of Canadian Pacific Railway hotels in Banff and Lake Louise. The fountain was completed by William Penn Stone Company of Minneapolis in 1914 for a cost of $9,722.19, and consisted of white stone on a granite base with a concrete basement to house the water pump. In 1988, the fountain was declared an historical site. By 1992, it was falling badly into disrepair. The fountain was dismantled and fixed offsite in 2010 to facilitate needed repairs. The 2010 restoration project won the Heritage Winnipeg Preservation Award. ==Park Features== In addition to the Waddell Fountain, the park also features a four- season slide/toboggan facility, an interactive sand and water play area, an open area of artificial turf, and a wading pool and aquatic play pad. == References  *CBC features on Central Park Category:Parks in Winnipeg Category:Tourist attractions in Winnipeg *In-Context Video Documentary on Central Park ","title":"Central Park (Winnipeg)"},{"id":"20446878","text":"A consultative referendum on home rule was held in Greenland on 17 January 1979.

He was the author of \\"Jock-A- Mo\\" (1954), which was later rerecorded as \\"Iko Iko\\" by the Dixie Cups, and became a huge hit. The song was recorded by many other artists, including Dr. John, Belle Stars, the Grateful Dead, Cyndi Lauper, and (as \\"Geto Boys\\") by Glass Candy. ==Life and career== Starting out on trombone, Crawford formed a band, which a local DJ, Doctor Daddy-O, named the Chapaka Shawee (Creole for \\"We Aren't Raccoons\\"), the title of an instrumental that they played. The group was signed by Chess Records president Leonard Chess and was renamed Sugar Boy and his Cane Cutters. His song \\"Jock-A-Mo\\" became a standard at the New Orleans Mardi Gras, but Crawford disappeared from public view. In a 2002 interview for Offbeat magazine he described how his career came to an abrupt halt in 1963, after a severe beating at the hands of state troopers incapacitated him for two years, forcing him to leave the music industry. In 1969, he decided to sing only in church. In 2012 he made a guest appearance singing gospel in an episode of the HBO series Treme. He died one month before the episode aired. James \\"Sugar Boy\\" Crawford was also Inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. Crawford appeared on the 1995 album Let Them Talk, by Davell Crawford, his grandson.

A barrel nut (also known as steel cross dowel or dowel nut) is a specialized nut, and is commonly used in aerospace and ready- to-assemble furniture applications. It is used to bolt thin sheet metal parts to larger, often billet or forged, parts. The barrel nut is a round slug, or formed sheet metal part with threads perpendicular to the length of the nut. The nut sits in a hole inside the forging and a standard bolt is threaded into the barrel nut from outside the sheet metal. They are preferred over a standard nut and bolt, because they do not require a flange to be machined or forged onto the receiving part, thus reducing weight. Furniture cross dowel barrel nuts are cylindrical shaped metal nuts (metal dowels) used with furniture connector bolts to join two pieces of wood. The inside threaded hole is unusual in that it passes through the sides of the dowel. To install, the pieces of wood to be joined are aligned, then a bolt hole is drilled through one piece of wood and into the other. A dowel hole is drilled laterally across the bolt hole and the cross dowel is inserted into it. The end of the cross dowel is slotted so that a screwdriver can be inserted to rotate the dowel so that its threaded shaft aligns with the bolt hole. The furniture connector bolt is then inserted into the bolt hole and screwed into the cross dowel until the wood pieces are held tightly together. Barrel nuts are also common in flat-pack furniture, where long bolts and barrel nuts are used to hold together T joints in chipboard sheets. ==References== Category:Nuts (hardware) http://www.fastenerdata.co.uk/nut-fastener ","title":"Barrel nut"},{"id":"20447026","text":"Oleksandr Mykolayovych Bondarenko (; ; born 29 June 1966 in Zaporizhia) is a retired Ukrainian football player.

Founded in 1967, the Gallery has established itself as one of the region‚Äôs leading art galleries, organizing exhibitions of local, national and international visual artists. The gallery showcases contemporary work reflecting current changes in art making and pieces from its collection. ==Mission statement== Gallery Stratford‚Äôs mission is to engage the community of Stratford and its visitors in the advancement and appreciation of the visual arts in order to inspire and enrich lives. ==History== Built in 1883 on the banks of the Avon River, Stratford‚Äôs original pump house with its elaborate architectural elements and picturesque setting is a perfect location today for the city‚Äôs public gallery of visual art - Gallery Stratford. Located at 54 Romeo Street, the building‚Äôs Queen Anne Style architecture contains Gothic Revival Style elements that are seen elsewhere in the community. The character of the former Water Works building is quite in keeping with the designs of George F. Durand, a prominent London, Ontario architect who designed the Perth County Courthouse. Durand, one of Ontario‚Äôs leading architects of the time, felt, very strongly, that architecture was an art, not an engineering project; his structures reflecting the combination of more than one style of design associated with the Queen Anne Style. Features such as pairings of lancet, or narrow pointed windows and the polychromatic effects in the brickwork are characteristic of Durand. Remnants of the once monumental entrance-way, with its wedge-shaped gable and the arch within an arch motif, reflect Durand‚Äôs way of thinking. While the Gallery‚Äôs exterior appears cottage-like, the building was never designed for domestic living. In its original state, the pump room had 16 foot high walls decorated, in places, by a \\"wandering artist.\\" It had a brick floor and an oiled hardwood ceiling. Two other men responsible for the construction of the Waterworks in Stratford were W. Perry, Jr., who was responsible for putting the pumping machines in place and William Roberts, who was the building contractor. Roberts was not only a builder, but was also a brick manufacturer and the pump house was built using his \\"celebrated superior white patent pressed brick.\\" By 1964, the historic building became obsolete when the Stratford Public Utilities Commission opened a new pump house across the street; there was a possibility that the buildings would be demolished. The Stratford Art Society (founded in 1945) prepared a feasibility plan to convert the buildings into a prestigious art gallery. In 1966, the Stratford Art Society became known as the Stratford Art Association, and its director was Robert Ihrig. With receipt of financial backing in 1967 from Rothman‚Äôs Pall Mall of Canada Limited, The Stratford Art Association renovated and opened the doors of the Rothman Art Gallery. The Rothman Art Gallery was an active cultural centre for the region, exhibiting emerging Canadian and International artists. In partnership with the Stratford Festival a ‚ÄòMusic at Midnight‚Äô series flourished at the Rothman Art Gallery from 1969 until 1976; presenting unscheduled appearances by the Festivals guest musicians and chamber concerts by members of the resident Festival orchestra. By 1974, Rothman‚Äôs underwent internal organizational changes that altered the way the company supported the arts. Rothmans eventually removed themselves from this project, but not before spending in the neighborhood of a million dollars to develop a viable art gallery. Withdrawal of Rothman‚Äôs along with its financial support over the next three years resulted in the gallery‚Äôs new name ‚Äì Gallery Stratford. In 1985, Gallery Stratford‚Äôs unique architectural exterior was recognized with the City of Stratford designating it a Heritage Building. ==Permanent Collection== Ela Moll Drawing The Permanent Collection of Gallery Stratford includes over 1000 works of art. The majority of the collection consists of works on paper by Canadian artists: prints, drawings, and paintings. Many of the works were purchased in the early years of the Rothman‚Äôs Art Gallery by the women‚Äôs volunteer committees. In more recent years, works have been donated by artists who have had exhibitions at Gallery Stratford. ==Education== thumb Gallery Stratford involves the community in its programming to facilitate visual arts awareness for adults and children. Programs change seasonally, with studio classes ranging from oil painting, drawing and illustration to photography and printmaking. For students, class visits to Gallery Stratford are interactive and curriculum-based; encouraging students to find pleasure and meaning in art, and to think critically about art work. Students are guided during their visits by staff or docents who lead discussions on the content and artistic qualities of selected original works of art. Programs change regularly to complement current exhibitions. The gallery also features an open community studio, stocked with creative materials. The community studio guided activities reinforce key concepts introduced in the exhibitions, helping participants to connect with the art work. During the second Sunday of each month from September to June, Gallery Stratford offers Family Art Sundays. This free program runs from 1-3pm and is led by a Gallery educator. Through a partnership with the Toronto International Film Festival Group, Gallery Stratford offers a special selection of films on the third Monday of every month from September to May at the Stratford Cinemas. The film series allows the audience unique access to view Canadian and international films in limited distribution. Gallery Stratford's Arts Alive program offers drawing, photography, animation, painting, sculptures, collage projects and much more. Arts Alive offers full- day and half-day weekly programs during the month of July each year for children aged 3 to 14. ==Scholarships== Annually, Gallery Stratford awards a scholarship to Perth Huron high school students who go on to study visual arts after high school. The Ela Moll Scholarship was founded by members of the Stratford Community and the Stratford Art Association to commemorate the death of Ela Moll (1950‚Äì1969), and to ensure that Stratford area youth will continue to be encouraged in the arts. Ela Moll was a young Stratford artist, who was killed in an accident. A prolific artist from a very early age, he was rarely idle and produced hundreds of art works, including ink, etchings, oils/acrylic, silk screens, and sculpture. Moll displayed an extraordinary imagination and a great creative ability, manifested not only in his own work but his leadership to the young people of Stratford. ==See also== * List of art museums * List of museums in Ontario ==References== *Gallery Stratford ==External links== * Category:Art museums and galleries in Ontario Category:Buildings and structures in Stratford, Ontario Category:Tourist attractions in Perth County, Ontario Category:Art galleries established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Gallery Stratford"},{"id":"20447048","text":"Cidimar Rodrigues da Silva (born 1 July 1984), commonly known as Cidimar, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a striker and is currently a free agent. ==ReferencesCategory:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Sport Club Internacional players Category:Sociedade Esportiva e Recreativa Caxias do Sul players Category:Guarani FC players Category:Paysandu Sport Club players Category:SpVgg Greuther F√ºrth players Category:FSV Frankfurt players Category:Dynamo Dresden players Category:VfR Aalen players Category:SG Sonnenhof Gro√üaspach players Category:FC Biel-Bienne players Category:2.

In 1936, being just 31 years old, he became the medical director of the hospital. In 1957 he was appointed a professor of Utrecht University and became a medical director of Wilhelmina Children's Hospital. Dicke died in 1962 of cerebrovascular disease. He was considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Medicine, but his death that year made the discussion moot as the prizes are not awarded posthumously.Thompson, G. R. \\"Ch. 3.\\" Pioneers of Medicine without a Nobel Prize. London: Imperial College, 2014. N. pag. Print. The Netherlands' Society of Gastroenterology had instituted in his honor a decoration to reward the pioneering research in the field, and Willem was the first to receive the gold Dicke Medal. ==The Dutch famine of 1944‚Äì1945== The discovery of the cause of coeliac disease may also be partly attributed to the Dutch famine. With wheat in very short supply there was an improvement at a children's ward of coeliac patients. Stories tell of the first precious supplies of bread being given specifically to the (no longer) sick children, prompting an immediate relapse. Thus in the 1940s Willem Dicke was able to corroborate his previously researched hypothesis that wheat intake was aggravating coeliac disease.

Parkinson (1920‚Äì1992) Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley, was a poet in his own right; an expert on the poetry of W. B. Yeats; and one of the first academic authorities to write about the Beat poets and novelists of San Francisco in the 1950s and 1960s. A deeply thoughtful man of great integrity, he was a quiet political activist for much of his life, and survived a murder attempt in 1961 by a deranged former student who sought to \\"get someone who was associated with Communism.\\" Though Parkinson survived being shot in the face (and bore the scars of the assault for the rest of his life), the teaching assistant who was with him at the time was killed. Thomas Parkinson died of an apparent heart attack in 1992, at age 72, after a long illness. ==Early life and influences== Parkinson's early life was affected by the Great Depression and the Second World War. Growing up in San Francisco as the son of a master-plumber union leader who was blacklisted during the General Strike of the late 1930s, Parkinson developed a respect for labor and a sensitivity to social injustice. He attended Lowell High School and some junior college, where he was inspired by gifted teachers. When WWII began, Parkinson enlisted in the Army, but was eventually discharged because he was too tall. In the years that followed, Parkinson worked a motley series of jobs, as an insurance agent, a ship's outfitter, and a lumberjack. And he continued to read widely and deeply. He eventually returned to UC Berkeley, where he completed his bachelor's degree in three years. ==Academic career and activism== While he was developing an academic career at Berkeley in the 1950s, Parkinson became immersed in the continuing political battles of his times. He was one of the founders of KPFA-radio Berkeley when it was a free- form West Coast anarchist collective. A tireless supporter of students both inside and outside the classroom, Parkinson made a number of public statements about paltry funding for student scholarships, including those for women students. An article he published in the campus newspaper, the Daily Californian, sparked the murder attempt by a former student who claimed to have been commanded by God. Parkinson was severely injured in the attack‚Äîseveral of his vertebrae were fused and his face permanently damaged, and the teaching assistant who was with him at the time was killed. Parkinson continued to promote liberal causes, however, and served as campus Ombudsman, chaired the Berkeley chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), and testified at the obscenity trial on behalf of Allen Ginsberg's Howl. He was instrumental in helping promote humanities study, teacher training, and extension courses for non-matriculated students during a period when the university was pressured to specialize its programs and become increasingly elite. ==Publications== During this period, Parkinson's academic career began to flourish as he published two critical works: W. B. Yeats, Self-Critic (1961) and W. B. Yeats, The Later Poetry (1964), which established him as an authority on the Anglo-Irish poet. He was also one of the first academic critics to appreciate and promote the works of Beat writers like Allen Ginsberg, but also of John Montague (poet), and Robert Duncan. He published his Casebook on the Beats in 1961. He became part of the circle of writers, including Lawrence Ferlinghetti, that helped evolve the San Francisco literary culture of the 1960s, and served as a unique voice as both critic and fellow-poet. Later volumes on Hart Crane and other poets won him lasting acclaim. His last book,Poets, Poems, Movements (1987), is an award-winning collection of essays. When Parkinson was an undergraduate at Cal he won the Emily Chamberlain Cook Prize in Poetry‚Äîthe twenty-sixth Award‚Äîin 1945, for his poem \\"Letter to a Young Lady\\" which was published as a staple back that year by The Circle. ==References *Finding aid to the Thomas Parkinson papers at Columbia University Rare Book & Manuscript Library Category:1920 births Category:1992 deaths Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty Category:Writers from San Francisco Category:American academics of English literature Category:20th-century American poets Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers ","title":"Thomas Parkinson"},{"id":"20447296","text":"Csaba L√°szl√≥ (born 18 August 1967 in V√°rpalota) is a Hungarian football player who played for BVSC Budapest. ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:People from V√°rpalota Category:Hungarian footballers Category:Feh√©rv√°r FC players Category:G√°zszer FC footballers Category:Budapesti VSC footballers Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Csaba L√°szl√≥ (footballer, born 1967)"},{"id":"20447308","text":"Chapples Park is located in the centre of Fort William, Ontario, which today forms the south end of Thunder Bay.

In Brittany she is widely revered as a patron saint of sick children and those whose birth is overdue.Dictionnaire des Saints Breton, Paris, 1979, p.350. The legend of Saint Tryphine probably derives from a historical individual who was the wife of the early Breton ruler Conomor. ==Historical background== Conomor is said to have married Tryphine, the daughter of his ally Waroch I, but seems later to have violently abused and then murdered her. Conomor was later killed in battle with a rival, and became a legendary villain in Breton history. Tryphine was elevated to the position of a martyred saint, along with her son Tremeur, and there are many churches dedicated to them. The village of Sainte-Tr√©phine is named for the former. ==Myth of Tryphine and Tremeur== In later legend Conomor's villainy is extended to include the murders of three wives before Tryphine. Tryphine refuses to marry him because of his reputation, but when he threatens to invade her father's lands she agrees, to spare the lives of her father's people. While Conomor is away Tryphine finds a secret room containing relics of the deceased wives. She prays for their souls, and their ghosts appear to her warning her that Conomor will kill her if she becomes pregnant. Depending on the version of the myth this is either because a prophecy states that he will be killed by his own son or because he is only interested in his wives as providers of sexual pleasure. When he returns he discovers that she is pregnant. Tryphine escapes with magical aid from the dead wives and gives birth in a forest. She hides her son before Conomor catches her and beheads her. However Saint Gildas finds her and miraculously restores her to life. She and her son both live lives of saintly retirement, but after Tryphine's death Conomor eventually finds Tremeur and kills him. In other versions Conomor is killed when his castle miraculously collapses onto him.Wendy Mewes, Discovering the History of Brittany, Red Dog, 2006, p. 44 It has been suggested that the story of Bluebeard derives from this myth.Gilles Rihouay, Konomor, Barbe-bleue breton, √âd.

The plot involves Tryphine's evil brother, Kervoura, who schemes to inherit the kingdom from Arthur. When he discovers that Tryphine is pregnant, he decides to eliminate Arthur's bloodline. As Tryphine is about to give birth, Kevoura kidnaps her and hides the child. He then accuses Tryphine of murdering her son and uses forged evidence to implicate her in a supposed plot to kill Arthur. Arthur orders Tryphine's arrest, but she escapes and hides for six years working as a servant. She is eventually discovered and brought back to court. Arthur now accepts her innocence and they have a daughter together. Kervoura then accuses her of adultery, using bribed witnesses. She is condemned to be executed. However her son Tremeur has now grown up and has escaped from his captors to return. He reveals himself just as Tryphine is about to be beheaded by the executioner and challenges Kervoura to a duel. He kills Kervoura, who confesses his crimes before he dies.

He was killed in action during the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. He was consequently awarded the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest peacetime gallantry award, on 26 January 2009 by the president Pratibha Patil. ==Early and personal life== Sandeep Unnikrishnan came from a Malayali family residing in Bangalore, where they had moved from Cheruvannur, Kozhikode District in the state of Kerala. He was the only son of retired ISRO officer K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi Unnikrishnan. Unnikrishnan spent 14 years at the Frank Anthony Public School in Bangalore before graduating in 1995 in the ISC Science stream. He wanted to join the Army, even attending school in a crew cut. His peers and teachers recalled him as being a good athlete who was active in school activities and sports events. He was also a member of the school choir and enjoyed watching movies. ==Army career== Sandeep joined the National Defence Academy (India) (NDA), Pune, Maharashtra in 1995. He was a part of the Oscar Squadron (No. 4 Battalion) and a graduate of the 94th Course NDA. He graduated as a Bachelor of Arts. His NDA friends remember him as \\"selfless\\", \\"generous\\" and \\"calm and composed\\". He was commissioned a lieutenant in the 7th Battalion of the Bihar Regiment (Infantry) on 12 June 1999. During Operation Vijay in July 1999, he was regarded positively at the forward posts in the face of heavy artillery firing and small arms fire by Pakistan troops. On the evening of 31 December 1999, Sandeep led a team of six soldiers and managed to establish a post 200 metres from the opposing side and under direct observation and fire. Promoted captain on 12 June 2003 and to major on 12 June 2005, Sandeep opted for the NSG commando service which he joined on deputation in 2006. After serving the Indian Army in different locations in Jammu and Kashmir and Rajasthan during counter insurgencies for two terms, he was selected to join the National Security Guards. On completion of training, he was assigned to the Special Action Group (SAG) of NSG on January 2007 and participated in various operations of the NSG.Mangalorean.Com- Serving Mangaloreans Around The World! During the 'Ghatak course' (at the Commando Wing (Infantry School), Belgaum), the most difficult course of the Army, Sandeep topped the course, earning an \\"Instructor Grading\\" and commendation. ===Operation Black Tornado=== On the night of 26 November 2008, several iconic buildings in South Mumbai were attacked. One of the buildings where hostage were held was the 100-year-old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Sandeep Unnikrishnan was the team commander of 51 Special Action Group (51 SAG) deployed in the operation at the hotel to rescue the hostages. He entered the hotel in a group of 10 commandos and reached the sixth floor through the staircase. As the team descended the stairs, they suspected perpetrators on the third floor. A few women were held as hostages in a room which was locked from the inside. After breaking open the door, the round of fire by the perpetrators hit Commando Sunil Kumar Yadav in both legs, who was Sandeep's colleague. Sandeep engaged the perpetrators in a firefight. He arranged for Yadav's evacuation and gave chase to those he had engaged in the firefight who, meanwhile, escaped to another floor of the hotel. In the encounter that followed, he was shot from the back, and he later succumbed to his injuries.Nation bids adieu to ATS chief, NSG commando ‚Äì India News ‚Äì IBNLive His last words were, \\"Do not come up, I will handle them,\\" according to NSG officials.

This law was stated by Edwin Wike in a humorous article in which he also admits that the association of his name with the law is an example of Stigler's law of eponymy. The lowest odd prime number is three. Wike illustrates how this yields an unbalanced design with an invented study in which researchers investigated the effects on sexual satisfaction of water beds. The fictitious researchers randomly assigned couples to three groups: those having sex on a conventional bed, those having sex on a water bed, and those having sex on a water bed having also taken a sea sickness pill. Wike pointed out that any differences in sexual satisfaction among the three groups could be due to the water bed or to the sea sickness pill. It requires a fourth group, couples taking the pill and using a conventional bed, to balance the design and to allow the researchers to attribute any differences in sexual satisfaction among the groups to the sort of bed, to the pill, or to their interaction. ==References== * Wike, E.

It's also been recorded at a depth of 60 m below sea level. It lives on the surface of reefs, but often swims in the water columns above the reefs to feed on plankton. It's a rather solitary species, seen alone or in small groups, and tends to stay close to the reefs. The younger fish stay near the bottom in order to avoid predators. The males maintain a solitary breeding territory. After breeding with multiple females, they guard the eggs until the planktonic larvae hatch. ==Use and trade== The blue chromis is largely collected for use in aquariums. There are no reliable numbers on the extent of this collecting, but damselfish make up the most intensely collected fish group, making up almost half of the aquarium trade. ==Threats== Besides the intense aquarium trade, the rapid expansion of lionfish in the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast is the greatest threat to the blue chromis, as well as several other tropical fish native to the Caribbean. Furthermore, the loss of live corals could have a definite impact on the species, though this has yet to be investigated more closely. ==Status== The blue chromis is assessed as \\"Least Concern\\" by the IUCN. Despite appearing only within an area of 2,500,000 km2, it is considered abundant within that area, without any known continuous decline in range or population numbers. It's collected for the aquarium trade, but not in great numbers. Despite this, a deeper study is required to measure the impact of the decline in habitat quality in the Caribbean has on the species. ==References * cyanea Category:Fish described in 1860 Category:Fish of the Atlantic Ocean ","title":"Chromis cyanea"},{"id":"20447887","text":"Timo Uster (born 22 October 1974 in Berlin) is a Gambian footballer who last played for Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen. == International career == Uster played two caps for the Gambian national football team in 2007. == Personal life == He also holds German citizenship. == References == Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Gambian footballers Category:The Gambia international footballers Category:German footballers Category:German people of Gambian descent Category:SV Meppen players Category:FC Carl Zeiss Jena players Category:SV Wehen Wiesbaden players Category:SV Darmstadt 98 players Category:Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen players Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Footballers from Berlin Category:2.

Members of the association are either organizations or businesses working in the cotton sector that wish to participate in a Chinese consultation structure. Set up in September 2003, the association has since actively developed numerous service and conciliation activities, set up a code of ethics and internal regulations as well as professional protection services within the sector. The association has become one of the major partners and an important relay between official organizations, governmental structures and agricultural and industrial players in the Chinese cotton sector. It is a major player in the steady and stable development of the Chinese cotton sector. Over the last four years, it has established numerous working relationships and many regular exchanges with international organizations in the cotton trade and industry in the main producer and cotton-buying countries worldwide. == Industry == *China is the largest cotton producing country in the world (35.8 million bales, 2007) *China has about 24 million cotton farmers *7,500 textile companies which produce an estimated RMB 488 billion of cotton cloth *Chinese cotton production requires an average 3,000 to 5,000 cubic metres of water per hectare *30‚Äì40% of all pesticides applied in China are applied to cotton, making it the most heavily treated agricultural crop. *Xinjiang is the country's top cotton growing area. ===Chinese cotton sector=== Chinese cotton production in 2006 related to a planted area of nearly five and a half million hectares (5,410,000 hectares), i.e. eighty one million ‚Äòmous‚Äô (a ‚Äòmou‚Äô is the traditional area unit used in rural China, which is about a fifteenth of a hectare ) (81,130,000 ‚Äòmous‚Äô). According to the official Chinese Statistics Office figures, production in 2006 was 6,730,000 tonnes. Of this, a third of the production came from the Xinjiang province, 2,180,000 tonnes. Based on these production figures, it is estimated that it was needed to import 4,300,000 tonnes of cotton in order to meet the demand, but in fact between September 2006 and August 2007 (which is the annual cotton season in China) the country only had to import 2,280,000 tonnes of cotton, i.e. 47% less than predicted. Two million tonnes less than predicted. Actual production in Xinjiang was over 3,200,000 tonnes of cotton. Production in China is in the region of 7,700,000 tonnes.they take the cotton to a machine that will ship it and then makes it into the thread they need to make cotton. Mill production is increasing quite rapidly. According to the Chinese Statistics Office, between September 2006 and August 2007 China produced 19,030,000 tonnes of yarn. It is up 18.8%, but is however an increase that is 8 points down on the same period in the previous year. According to a study undertaken by the Chinese Cotton Association, in 2007 in China the planted area of cotton was 82,600,000 ‚Äòmous‚Äô (around 5 and a half million hectares), a slight increase on the previous year. Production forecasts anticipate production remaining stable against the previous year, with perhaps a slight increase to reach around 7,700,000 tonnes once again. Demand in China is constantly increasing. Specialists estimate that textile production for 2007 will continue to grow. It is thought that the production of cotton thread will increase 10% to reach around 21 million tonnes. With a cotton requirement of 12 million tonnes, China needs to import around 4 million tonnes of cotton. ==Further reading== *China‚Äôs Cotton Supply and Demand: Issues and Impact on the World Market Outlook Report No. (CWS-07I-01) 20 pp, November 2007 *China - cotton production - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service report World Cotton Situation, Oct, 1991 *Cotton Textiles in China: Chronology and Economic Overview by Kenneth Pomeranz *Cotton Textiles in China, 1650‚Äì2003 *A study on rational location of the cotton production in China ==See also== *Cotton *Agriculture in China *History of agriculture in the People's Republic of China *Cotton paper *Organic cotton ==External links== * China Cotton Association - official website * www.cottonchina.org - China Cotton Index & Commodity Trading Exchange * China Cotton Textile Association * China National Textile & Apparel Council * Committee for International Co-operation between Cotton Associations - China became its 17th member in February 2007 Category:Cotton organizations Category:Industry in China Category:Cooperatives in China Category:Textile industry of China Category:Agricultural organizations based in China Category:Textile industry associations ","title":"China Cotton Association"},{"id":"20447926","text":"Gram√´ Lake () is a glacial lake situated in the eastern Korab Mountains, close to the Mount Korab and Mali i Gram√´s in Albania, spanning an area of .

He immigrated in 1960 to the United States with his family, one of the first groups Tibetans-in-exile in North America. He is the first Head of the Sakya Order of Tibetan Buddhism to live in the United States. From the Sakya Monastery of Tibetan Buddhism in Seattle, Washington, and its precursor (which he co-founded in 1974), he taught and preserved Tibetan culture and religion. Because he was also a non-sectarian master within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, he defined Sakya Monastery as a non-denominational and ecumenical center for teachings about Tibetan Buddhism. His work also included the foundation of Tibetan Buddhist communities overseas in India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Southeast Asia, and teaching at Buddhist centers around the world. == Life  Education and Early Adulthood === Jigdal Dagchen Sakya, 262x262px Dagchen Rinpoche was tutored by the abbot of the South Monastery of Sakya and by the Secretary of the Sakya Government. With these two teachers, Rinpoche studied the Tibetan alphabet, composition, classical literature, philosophy, and the Four Classes of Tantra (esoteric Buddhism). He also received teachings on the Sakya meditation deities. From P√∂nlop Sakya of the North Monastery, Dagchen Rinpoche learned the fundamental esoteric religious rites of the Sakya tradition: religious music, mandala offering, dancing, and ritual hand gestures. After having successfully completed this training, Dagchen Rinpoche received from his father the Sakya- Khon lineage transmission of Vajrakilaya (a meditational deity whose name means the ‚ÄúDagger of Indestructible Reality‚Äù), and the complete Lamdr√© Tsokshey (The Path and Its Fruit in its more esoteric form), which is the main teaching of the Sakya tradition. Thus, Rinpoche‚Äôs primary spiritual teacher was his father, Trichen Ngawang Thutop Wangchuk. In 1950, at age 21, Dagchen Rinpoche married S√∂nam Tsezom, who descends from a family of lamas and doctors of East Tibet (Kham). She is the niece of the Dezhung Rinpoche III. When she married her name became Jamyang and her title Dagmo Kusho or, more formally, Dagmo Kushola, which roughly translates as: \\"mother of a prince.\\" Later that year Dagchen Rinpoche‚Äôs father died. Rinpoche became the interim Throne- holder. Concurrently, Communist Chinese invaders were threatening Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism. After a short reign as the head of the Sakya sect, he took a leave of absence as ruler of Sakya in order to travel to East Tibet to complete his religious education. Dagchen Rinpoche closes the Hevajra Mandala of colored sand using a gold dorje below a statue of Sakya Pandita In East Tibet, Dagchen Rinpoche received teachings from fourteen lamas. Among them were his root lamas, Jamyang Ch√∂kyi Lodr√∂ and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. They were renowned non-sectarian lamas, of the Sakya and Nyingma traditions, respectively. From Jamyang Ch√∂kyi Lodr√∂ Rinpoche, Dagchen Rinpoche received initiations and teachings of the Sakya School‚Äôs most valued teaching, the seven-volume Lamdr√© Lopshey (The Path and Its Fruit in its more esoteric form) and the fourteen-volume Druptap Kundu (Collection of Methods of Realization). From Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dagchen Rinpoche received teachings on the thirteen-volume Damngak Dz√∂ (Treasury of Esoteric Instructions), a non- sectarian compilation by Jamg√∂n Kongtrul, a great non-sectarian master of Tibetan Buddhism from the Kagyu School. Additionally, twelve other Sakya lamas gave him the teachings from the thirty-one volume Gyude Kundu. === Emigration to the United States === In 1959, due to the Communist Chinese invasion of Tibet, Dagchen Rinpoche and his family (including his younger brother Ngawang Trinly Tashi Pal Sakyapa and his wife‚Äôs uncle Dezhung Rinpoche III) fled to Bhutan and then to India. Professor Turrell V. Wylie from the Tibetan Studies Program at the University of Washington, the first such program in the country, invited Dagchen Rinpoche to participate in a research project on Tibet sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. This enabled Dagchen Rinpoche to bring his family to Seattle, Washington in 1960. The research project funding lasted for three years. Following that, over the next decade Rinpoche held several positions at the University of Washington, including working in the Anthropology Department and at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. === A Non-Sectarian Seattle Lama === 262x262px In 1974 Dagchen Rinpoche co-founded, with Dezhung Rinpoche III, his wife‚Äôs uncle, the original Sakya Dharma Center in Seattle called Sakya Tegchen Choling. In 1984, the group adopted the name of Sakya Monastery of Tibetan Buddhism. For the purpose of the preservation of Tibetan culture and religion, Dagchen Rinpoche oversaw the religious activities and administration of the Monastery from its inception. His spiritual leadership took various forms: leading meditations, giving teachings and empowerments (spiritual initiations), conducting refuge ceremonies in which people formally become Buddhists, and holding special services upon request. When the Monastery was completed, Dagchen Rinpoche placed greater emphasis on education. The Virupa Educational Institute is devoted to the study of Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhism in general, religions, cultures, and sciences from around the world. Non-sectarianism and education were major components of Rinpoche‚Äôs teaching, in keeping with the beliefs of his root lamas. Sakya Monastery in Seattle has hosted visits from leading lamas of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, including the Dalai Lama. Dagchen Rinpoche‚Äôs interest in ecumenism stemmed from his training as a non- sectarian master, and from his experience as an immigrant who went to the United States seeking religious freedom. Like the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Rinpoche encouraged inter-religious and interdisciplinary meetings and encounters for Tibetan Buddhists. He regularly travelled to teach in Asia, Europe, Canada, and throughout the United States. == Ancestry  Ancestors === 327x327px Lineage is important in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, and Dagchen Rinpoche‚Äôs lineage is revered. It extends more than thousand years. His father was Trichen (‚ÄúGreat Throne-holder‚Äù) Ngawang Thutop Wangchuk, the last great throne-holder of the Sakya Order of Tibetan Buddhism in Tibet, and his mother was Gyalyum (‚ÄúMother of the Kh√∂n Children‚Äù) Dechen Drolma. Dagchen Rinpoche‚Äôs family lineage is considered divine because family records and Tibetan histories state that his family is descended from celestial beings from the realm of heavenly clear light. Five generations of these celestial beings are said to have lived in Tibet. A famous ancestor of his from the late eighth century was Kh√∂n Lu‚Äôi Wangpo (Nagendrarakshita), one of the first seven Tibetans ordained as a Buddhist monk, a noted translator, and a personal disciple of Padmasambhava (who erected the first Buddhist monastery in Tibet, called Samye). Since the eleventh century, the Sakya male progeny are also regarded as emanations of Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom; Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva of Compassion; or Vajrapani, Bodhisattva of Power. === The Sakya Name === In 1042, Atisha, the great Indian Buddhist master who helped revive Buddhism in Tibet, was traveling in Tibet spreading the Buddha‚Äôs teachings. At the side of a mountain where there was ‚Äúpale earth,‚Äù he foresaw the emanations of three bodhisattvas who he knew would spread the Buddhist doctrine in Tibet: Avalokiteshvara (the embodiment of compassion), Manjushri (the embodiment of infinite wisdom), and Vajrapani (the embodiment of infinite power). It was at the same site of pale earth some thirty years later, in 1073, that Kh√∂n K√∂nchok Gyalpo (1034‚Äì1102), ancestor of Dagchen Rinpoche, built the first Sakya Monastery. The monastery took its name from the pale earth (in Tibetan ‚Äúsa-kya‚Äù) where the monastery was founded. Subsequently, the town that arose there, the family of the monastery‚Äôs founder (the Kh√∂n lineage), and the school of Tibetan Buddhism took the name of the monastery: Sakya. The Sakya name is also renowned for having lamas as rulers of Tibet. The Sakya patriarch, Chogyal Pakpa (1235‚Äì1280) was given temporal authority over Tibet through the patronage of the Mongol rulers of China. Subsequently, the Sakya lamas governed Tibet for over ninety years. The Sakya School is one of the four great Schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The Sakya masters developed a tradition that emphasized study and meditation in equal measure. ==References * Official website of the Sakya Monastery of Tibetan Buddhism, Seattle Category:1929 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Buddhist scholars from Tibet Category:Sakya Lamas Category:Buddhist writers Category:Tibetan Buddhist teachers Category:Lamas from Tibet Category:Buddhist monks from Tibet Category:Buddhist religious leaders Category:Tibetan Buddhists from Tibet Category:20th-century Lamas Category:21st-century Lamas Category:Tibetan refugees Category:Tibetan emigrants to the United States ","title":"Jigdal Dagchen Sakya"},{"id":"20447999","text":"Jim Cronin (August 24, 1906 ‚Äì April 1942) was an American soccer player who was a member of the United States soccer team at the 1928 Summer Olympics and played in the St. Louis Soccer League.

It originally opened on September 2, 1948, as the Navajo- themed Thunderbird. The Thunderbird was owned by building developer Marion Hicks and Lieutenant Governor of Nevada Clifford A. Jones. A sister property, the Algiers Hotel, was opened in 1953. During the mid-1950s, the state carried out an investigation to determine whether underworld Mafia figures held hidden interests in the resort. Hicks and Jones ultimately prevailed and kept their gaming licenses. Hicks died in 1961, and his position as managing director was taken over by Joe Wells, another partner in the resort. Wells added a horse racing track known as Thunderbird Downs, located behind the resort. The Thunderbird also hosted numerous entertainers and shows, including Flower Drum Song and South Pacific. Business at the resort declined as ownership changed several times. In 1965, Wells and Jones sold the Thunderbird to Del E. Webb Corporation, which later sold it to Caesars World in 1972. Caesars World planned to demolish the Thunderbird and construct a $150 million resort in its place, but the project was canceled because of a lack of financing. The Thunderbird was sold to Tiger Investment Company, which leased it to Major Riddle starting in 1977. Riddle renovated and expanded the resort, and renamed it as the Silver Bird, hoping to reinvigorate it. After Riddle's death in 1980, the Silver Bird was taken over by his estate. The resort closed on December 3, 1981, after an auction failed to produce a buyer on the lease. Ed Torres subsequently purchased the Silver Bird and reopened it as the El Rancho on August 31, 1982. The resort featured a western theme and was named after the original El Rancho Vegas across the street. Torres added a 13-story hotel tower in 1988. The El Rancho closed on July 6, 1992, unable to compete with newer mega resorts. It sat vacant for the next eight years while two companies made several failed attempts to reopen or replace the resort. A news investigation later found the decrepit buildings to be in violation of health and safety regulations. Turnberry Associates purchased the El Rancho and its 20 acres in May 2000. The company had been developing the Turnberry Place high-rise condominiums on 15 acres located behind the El Rancho. The closed resort was considered an eyesore for the new project, so Turnberry Associates had it demolished. The El Rancho's last remaining building, the 13-story hotel tower, was imploded on October 3, 2000. The former property of the El Rancho and Algiers later became the site of The Drew Las Vegas, a resort scheduled to open in 2022. ==History Thunderbird (1948‚Äì77)=== The resort originally opened as the Thunderbird, owned by building developer Marion Hicks and Lieutenant Governor of Nevada Clifford A. Jones. Hicks had previously built the El Cortez hotel-casino, which opened in downtown Las Vegas in 1941. Joe Wells, the father of actress Dawn Wells, was also a partner in the Thunderbird. The hotel project, originally known as the Nevada Ambassador, was announced in March 1946. It was to cost $1 million, and would be built on Highway 91 in the Las Vegas Valley, on what would later become the Las Vegas Strip. The Thunderbird opened on September 2, 1948, with 79 hotel rooms, a casino, and a bar. The cost of construction exceeded $2 million. The Thunderbird was the fourth resort to open on the Las Vegas Strip, and was located diagonally across the street from the El Rancho Vegas. It was named after the mythical Thunderbird creature, and the entrance featured two large, neon Thunderbird statues. The Thunderbird was considered a luxurious resort, and a Southwestern/Navajo theme was featured throughout the property, including portraits of American Indians. In February 1949, there were plans to add a 78-room hotel addition at a cost of $750,000. The hotel had expanded to 206 rooms by 1950. In 1953, the Thunderbird opened the adjacent 110-room Algiers Hotel, a sister property to deal with an overflow of guests. Alleged Mafia ties In October 1954, articles in the Las Vegas Sun alleged that Jake and Meyer Lansky, both underworld Mafia figures, held hidden shares in the hotel. An investigation was soon launched to determine whether the reports were true. The Thunderbird's complex ownership setup was a subject of questioning during a Nevada Tax Commission hearing later that month, part of the larger investigation into the resort's ownership. The property beneath the Thunderbird was owned by Bonanza Hotel, Inc, which operated the hotel portion and leased out other portions. Bonanza did not receive any of the resort's gaming revenue, and did not have stockholders. The casino, bars, and restaurants were operated by Thunderbird Hotel Company, of which Jones held an 11-percent interest. Hicks held 51-percent ownership of the resort. Both men denied that the Lanskys were involved in the Thunderbird. Hank Greenspun, the publisher of the Las Vegas Sun, was a critic of Jones, and Jones alleged that Greenspun was creating a \\"reign of terror\\" in southern Nevada: \\"No one is secure. You can't use your phone, you can't be seen with your friends for fear that will be ballooned into a sinister incident.\\" At the end of 1954, the Thunderbird was ordered to show cause at a future hearing as to why its gaming license should not be revoked or suspended. The investigation continued into 1955, and another tax commission hearing was held that February, during which Jones criticized Greenspun. According to Jones, Greenspun was upset that the Thunderbird would not advertise in the Las Vegas Sun. Jones said that Greenspun had made repeated threats to run Jones and Hicks out of town with his newspaper. During construction of the Thunderbird, Hicks had received a loan from George Sadlo, a business associate of the Lanskys. Sadlo later assigned half of the loan to Jake Lansky, without informing Hicks. The investigation revealed that Hicks had made interest payments to Jake Lansky from 1951 to 1954. The loan was perceived by the tax commission as a hidden interest in the Thunderbird. On April 1, 1955, the commission ruled that Hicks and Jones had to dispose of their interest in the Thunderbird within two months. Otherwise, the resort's gaming license would be suspended. It was the first time in Nevada history that such strict action had been taken against a major casino operation. It was part of an effort by the state to prevent underworld figures from having involvement in gambling. In May 1955, Southwest Securities Company, based in Dallas, expressed an interest in leasing the Thunderbird. However, following a tax commission meeting, the commission heard no further word regarding the company's proposal. Later in the month, Hicks and Jones won a temporary restraining order that blocked their ouster from the resort. The court action was filed on behalf of Thunderbird stockholders, including Hicks, Jones, and Wells. The Thunderbird continued to operate while both sides prepared for a legal battle over a permanent injunction. Final arguments were underway in October 1955, as attorneys for the Thunderbird questioned current and former employees of the tax commission. Nevada governor Charles H. Russell, also the chairman of the tax commission, had been running for re-election in 1954. The allegations against the Thunderbird came to light a month prior to the election, and the hotel alleged that the timing of the claims was politically motivated, as one member of the tax commission had already known about the Sadlo loan years prior to the 1954 accusation. In December 1955, judge Merwyn H. Brown ruled in favor of the Thunderbird and issued a permanent injunction against the tax commission, while stating that the commission should create and publish clear guidelines declaring what is required by casino licensees. Brown stated that any licensee \\"is surely entitled to know what is expected of him under the license obtained, and not be subject to annihilation upon an order of the commission based upon no substantial evidence in support of an alleged violation.\\" Brown wrote that the tax commission exhibited an \\"unusual eagerness\\" to find wrongdoing against Hicks. Brown also cited a lack of evidence that Jones had any knowledge of the Sadlo loan. Three months later, the tax commission filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Nevada. Both sides gave briefs to the supreme court at the end of 1956, and final arguments over the injunction were given several months later. In May 1957, the Nevada supreme court ruled that there was not sufficient evidence to revoke the Thunderbird gaming license. The court also ruled that Brown had acted in error, stating that casino owners shall not be entitled to continue operations under a district court injunction while they are appealing decisions by the tax commission. The commission chose not to pursue the matter any further. Changes Jones disposed of his gaming license in 1958, after purchasing a controlling interest in a Haitian casino. The tax commission had adopted a new regulation that prohibited Nevada gaming operators from owning interest in out-of-state casinos. Although Jones was no longer involved in the Thunderbird's gaming operations, he still maintained his ownership stake in the resort. The casino was closed in December 1960, for remodeling. In May 1961, a group of businessmen agreed to lease the Thunderbird from Hicks after he was hospitalized. Hicks had been battling cancer for two years and owned 72 percent of the Thunderbird stock. The new group included Sid Wyman and two other men who had all previously been involved with the Riviera resort nearby. Plans to lease the Thunderbird were canceled in August 1961, as Hicks regained his health and wanted to maintain his control of the resort. He died the following month, at the age of 57. The casino was closed for seven hours so employees could attend Hicks' funeral, marking the second time it had ever been closed. Wells was named as the resort's new managing director, taking over for Hicks. After Wells took over, the Thunderbird became heavily affiliated with sporting events such as wrestling and boxing. It also sponsored a deer-hunting contest. Ground was broken on November 23, 1962, for a $1 million, four-story hotel addition, located directly east of the resort. It was the third phase of a $6 million project to expand and modernize the Thunderbird. At the time, the Thunderbird also operated 88 rooms at its Thunderbird West building, located across the street at the former El Rancho Vegas. Big Joe's Oyster Bar opened several months later, and the restaurant resembled the interior of a ship. Fresh oysters were flown in to the restaurant daily from New Orleans. The four-story addition, with 205 rooms, was opened in November 1963. The expansion project was also supposed to include a skyscraper hotel building, approximately 17 stories with 350 rooms, to be built on the site of the hotel's pool area. It was to open in 1964, but it never materialized. Wells was the president of the Nevada Racing Association. In 1962, he began operating the Thunderbird Speedway in Henderson, Nevada, a city located southeast of the resort. It held auto races for the next two years, and Wells wanted the Thunderbird hotel to serve as the lodging headquarters for racers. Wells also had plans to construct a Quarter Horse race track directly behind the Thunderbird. The track, known as Thunderbird Downs, opened in October 1963. It consisted of a three-eighths mile track. It operated along Paradise Valley Road, and was successful enough to prompt a relocation the following year. The new Thunderbird Downs was situated across the street, at a larger site owned by Joe W. Brown. The land was previously used for the Las Vegas Park. In 1965, the Brown family sold the Las Vegas Park. The Thunderbird Downs track located on the site was closed that November, and was demolished in early 1966. It was replaced by the Las Vegas Country Club. Thunderbird Downs was successful during its two-year run. Del Webb In September 1964, the Del E. Webb Corporation announced plans to purchase the Thunderbird from Wells and Jones through its subsidiary, Sahara-Nevada Corporation, which also owned the nearby Sahara resort. The sale price was $9.5 million, and the purchase was approved by the state in January 1965. Two months later, plans were announced for a $1.5 million renovation that would include alterations to the facade. One of the Thunderbird statues was replaced by a larger version, and 400 feet of neon signage was added across the front of the building, spelling out the \\"Thunderbird\\" name with letters standing two stories tall. The renovation project also included the expansion of the casino, restaurants, and shops, and the construction of an Olympic-size swimming pool. Del E. Webb Construction Company handled the renovations, and Martin Stern Jr. was the architect. The new pool was the largest in Nevada, containing 360,000 gallons of water. The Thunderbird's convention and hotel facilities often handled overflow customers from the Sahara resort. During 1965, a minority stockholder in the Thunderbird sued Wells, Jones, and others over a dispute regarding the Del Webb purchase. In 1966, Tom Hanley's union organization, the American Federation of Gaming and Casino Employes, alleged that Sahara and Thunderbird workers were harassed by management after trying to organize into a union. Table game dealers also filed a $100,000 lawsuit against the Thunderbird, alleging that the resort refused to pay them overtime wages. Picketing also took place in front of the Thunderbird, accusing the resort of antisemitism after the firing of a Jewish table game dealer, Howard Bock. Consolidated Casinos Corporation said Bock was fired because he dumped food on another dealer's head. Hanley alleged that Bock was fired because he was Jewish, and said that Bock was harassed by the other dealer because of his ethnicity. Hanley's attempt to unionize the Thunderbird and other casinos was defeated later in 1966, during a National Labor Relations Board election. Business at the Thunderbird decreased following the Del Webb purchase and subsequent sales. In January 1967, Del Webb announced the sale of the Thunderbird for $13 million, to a group of businessmen known as Lance Inc. The state approved the sale three months later. At the end of 1967, Lance Inc. defaulted on its payments to Del Webb, and Consolidated Casinos was granted temporary approval by the state to take over the Thunderbird. In January 1968, Lance Inc. sought refinancing to take over the Thunderbird once again. The company owed an estimated $10 million to $14 million in debt, and a payment plan for its creditors was submitted. However, later that year, the company lost its battle to regain control of the Thunderbird, leaving it in Del Webb's ownership. Caesars World In July 1972, it was announced that Del Webb would sell the Thunderbird and surrounding acreage for $13.5 million to Caesars World, owner of the Caesars Palace resort on the Las Vegas Strip. The sale was approved later that year. Caesars World planned to build a new resort, the Mark Anthony, on the newly acquired property. The project was named after the Roman politician and general Mark Antony, and the resort would have served as a companion to Caesars Palace. The Mark Anthony would include a 2,000-room hotel, a casino, and a shopping complex. The Thunderbird would continue operations until the near-completion of the Mark Anthony. At the end of 1972, Caesars World planned approximately $500,000 in renovation work for the Thunderbird, believing it could bring in a profit before its planned demolition about two years later. The Thunderbird was operated by a Caesars World subsidiary called Paradise Road Hotel Corporation. After a global search, Caesars World was unable to find financing for the $150 million Mark Anthony project, and its cancellation was announced in June 1975. Caesars World initially stated that there was no intention of selling the Thunderbird, and that there were several plans in consideration for the property. In 1976, Caesars World announced that it would sell the Thunderbird for $9 million to Tiger Investment Company, a group of Las Vegas bankers that included E. Parry Thomas. At the time, the hotel had 460 rooms. Joan Louise Siegel, a Las Vegas resident, filed a suit to block the sale. During 1975, she had made two offers to purchase the Thunderbird for $20 million, but was told that the resort was not for sale. A district court judge dismissed the suit, stating that Caesars World had no obligation to sell the resort to Siegel. Tiger Investment completed its purchase later in 1976, and Caesars World had the right to resell the property until the end of the year. The sale agreement also involved a leaseback, in which Caesars World continued to operate the resort while it was owned by Tiger Investment. The Thunderbird had presented Caesars World with significant financial losses. ===Silver Bird (1977‚Äì82)=== In December 1976, Major Riddle planned to take over operations at the Thunderbird and rename it as the Silver Bird, consistent with two other casinos he owned in Las Vegas: the Silver Nugget and the Silver City Casino. At the time, the Thunderbird employed 500 people. Riddle planned a renovation of the resort, and had initially wanted to close the casino for the remodeling, before deciding to keep it open. The casino would be enlarged from to , and a sportsbook would be added. A high-rise hotel building had also been planned, along with the enlargement of the coffee shop and keno lounge. Riddle's target clientele included local residents and tourists both looking for cheap food and \\"loose\\" slots. Riddle believed that the local market had been forgotten over the years as the Thunderbird continued to change ownership. The name change took effect on January 1, 1977. Riddle changed the name of the resort because he believed that \\"Thunderbird\\" had become synonymous with \\"poor food and tight slot machines.\\" Riddle leased the Silver Bird from Tiger Investment, and operated it through his company, NLV Corporation. The renovation and expansion project took place throughout 1977. The expansion included a new 500-seat buffet, one of the largest in Las Vegas. Joe's Oyster Bar was also expanded, and the resort's showroom was renovated as well. Fifty-five hotel rooms were demolished to make room for the casino expansion, and other rooms were renovated. The hotel was reduced to 385 rooms. In August 1977, a fire occurred in the hotel's four-story building, forcing the evacuation of its guests. A cigarette had been left behind by hotel guests in a second-floor room, catching a mattress on fire. The Silver Bird suffered a two-alarm fire on March 3, 1981, when an arsonist set fire to a dressing room under the showroom stage. The hotel was evacuated with no injuries and only minimal damage was caused, but since the fire was the third in four months at casino resorts, 14 trucks responded. Riddle died in 1980, and the Silver Bird, along with his other casinos, was placed into his estate. The casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy later that year, and a reorganization effort failed to pay off the resort's creditors. An auction of the Silver Bird lease was held on December 2, 1981, with a minimum bid of $3.8 million. The resort was worth approximately $2.5 million. Tiger Investment still owned the resort, and any new leasee would have to make monthly payments of approximately $264,000. Other lease expenditures for furniture and equipment would raise the monthly costs to approximately $500,000. Bob Stupak was among those who bid on the Silver Bird, but no one bid the minimum amount. Eddy King, the chairman of record promotion company Star Makers Unlimited, offered the highest bid at $3.5 million. Last-minute efforts to negotiate a deal with King did not work out. As a result of the failed auction, the Silver Bird was closed on December 3, 1981, at the order of a federal bankruptcy judge. The closure affected approximately 850 employees. ===El Rancho (1982‚Äì92)=== Two weeks after its closure, Ed Torres announced plans to purchase the Silver Bird and its property from Tiger Investment. He intended to renovate the resort and reopen it by May 1982, while a new 700-room hotel tower was to open at the end of the year. Torres was the owner of the Aladdin hotel-casino on the Las Vegas Strip, and was also the father of swimmer Dara Torres. Ed Torres knew notorious crime members such as Meyer Lansky and Vincent Alo, but this did not restrict him from acquiring a gaming license for the Silver Bird property. Torres' $25 million purchase was approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission in April 1982. Torres spent another $25 million to renovate the property before reopening it as the El Rancho on August 31, 1982. More than 1,000 people attended the opening. The resort was named after the original El Rancho Vegas. Like the earlier resort, the new El Rancho featured a western theme, including a facade of old-western town buildings. The new resort had a wooden interior accompanied by American Indian items, chandeliers, buffalo trophy heads, and western paintings. Torres also added a 52-lane bowling alley, which was nearing completion at the time of the El Rancho's opening, and was finished by 1983. The western theme and bowling alley were part of an effort to attract families, a growing tourist demographic in Las Vegas. A new poker parlor was also added, but the planned hotel tower did not begin construction until several years later. The renovated resort was designed by Martin Stern Jr., and it employed 1,400 people. The resort's first high-rise hotel tower began construction in 1987, and was completed the following year. The 13-story tower added 580 rooms. The El Rancho struggled in its final years because of the early 1990s recession, as well as competition from newly opened mega resorts in Las Vegas, specifically The Mirage (1989) and the Excalibur (1990). The latter took away some of the middle-class gamblers that the El Rancho had relied upon. Torres announced in May 1992 that the resort would close in two months, giving workers a mandated 60-day notice. At the time, Torres had been trying to sell the resort for $25-30 million, but was unsuccessful. The closure announcement came after the Culinary Workers Union voted against Torres' request for concessions. The El Rancho also owed $250 on gaming tax for its 918 slot machines. The bowling alley, sportsbook, and slot machines were shut down on June 30, 1992, and the rest of the resort ceased operations on July 6, 1992. The closure affected 324 employees. Workers blamed Torres for the closure, stating that there were years of disinterest and lack of promotion on his part. At the time of its closure, the El Rancho occupied 20 acres. It had a casino, 1,007 hotel rooms, and four restaurants. The adjacent Algiers Hotel continued to operate for the next 12 years. ===Failed projects (1992‚Äì99)=== By August 1993, Las Vegas Entertainment Network Inc. (LVEN), a Los Angeles-based television production company, had plans to redevelop the resort and reopen it in 1994 as El Rancho's Countryland USA. The new resort would have included a family-oriented theme park with country-style entertainment and attractions. LVEN also planned to construct two 20-story hotel towers meant to resemble a gigantic pair of Western-style boots. The new towers would have brought the El Rancho up to a total of 2,001 hotel rooms. Harry Wald, the former president and chief operating officer of Caesars Palace, was to direct the redevelopment of the El Rancho into a full-time family resort. LVEN purchased the property in November 1993, for $36.5 million. By January 1994, LVEN planned to open El Rancho's Countryland USA with its own 24-hour cable television channel based inside the new resort, which would have housed facilities for production and broadcasting. The channel would have promoted events at the resort, as well as other resorts. LVEN had also planned to add a country-themed shopping mall and a rodeo production facility to the new resort. Construction of the new hotel towers was delayed because of a lack of financing. In October 1994, LVEN received $35 million from a Dallas investment bank for construction of the towers. At that time, LVEN had also planned to launch the Las Vegas Country Television Network, which would have featured country-western entertainment and other shows on the Las Vegas Strip. In January 1996, Orion Casino Corporation purchased the El Rancho from LVEN for $43.5 million. Orion Casino Corporation was a newly formed Nevada subsidiary of International Thoroughbred Breeders (ITB), a New Jersey racetrack operator founded by Robert E. Brennan, who had previously organized a penny stock scheme. A month after the purchase, ITB announced plans to demolish the El Rancho and construct Starship Orion, a $1 billion hotel, casino, entertainment and retail complex with an outer space theme, covering 5.4 million square feet. The resort was to include seven separately owned casinos, with each one being approximately . Individual partners would each contribute up to $100 million to own and operate a casino within the complex. Orion Casino Corporation would own and operate one of the seven casinos. The complex would include of retail space, as well as 2,400 hotel rooms and a 65-story hotel tower. ITB hoped to begin construction later in 1996, with a planned opening date of April 1998. Some gaming analysts expressed skepticism that the Starship Orion project could get built, citing the high cost and ITB's lack of casino experience. In an agreement with LVEN, ITB was to come up with financing for Starship Orion, with a deadline of October 25, 1996. If ITB were unsuccessful, LVEN had an option to seek alternative financing for a less-expensive project, such as re-opening the El Rancho. A week before the deadline, ITB told LVEN that the Starship Orion project had not generated any financing from potential investors. ITB was pursuing other possible options for the property at that time. ITB and LVEN subsequently got into a dispute regarding control of the El Rancho. In addition, Brennan was ordered by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission to sell his shares of ITB, as he had been fined $71.5 million for securities fraud in 1995. In January 1997, Brennan sold his interest in ITB to New Mexico businessman Nunzio DeSantis and former politician Tony Coelho, who were unable to make any progress on plans for the property. ITB had plans for a $100 million renovation of the El Rancho, which they planned to reopen as Countryland USA. The new resort would have included a 1,700-room hotel and a casino. In February 1997, ITB and LVEN settled their dispute, while the resort was expected to reopen in the first quarter of 1998. However, Coelho and DeSantis feuded with ITB board members who allegedly were trying to help Brennan retain control of the company. SunAmerica, the prospective underwriter for Countryland USA, subsequently chose not to proceed with its $100 million investment, out of concerns over the project and management. Ultimately, ITB stated that it was unable to raise financing for Countryland USA. At the end of 1997, Turnberry Associates purchased the 15-acre parcel behind the El Rancho, where Thunderbird Downs had previously operated. The company began developing the Turnberry Place condominium towers on the site, located directly east of the El Rancho. By June 1999, a partner company of LVEN was considering a purchase of the El Rancho, with plans to renovate it at a cost of $354 million. Ultimately, the sale did not proceed. ===Investigation and demolition (1999‚Äì2000)=== In the years that it sat vacant, the El Rancho had come to be widely considered as the city's worst eyesore. In 1999, local news channel KVBC News 3 was granted access to the El Rancho after being invited by two unnamed workers. KVBC conducted and aired an investigation of the resort's structures. Asbestos and exposed wiring were found throughout the buildings, as well as corroding chemicals which covered the floors. Rats and bugs were found to be inhabiting the resort. Homeless people had also been sneaking inside the closed resort and staying there, and marijuana and empty beer bottles were discovered by the news team. While most of the structures were decomposing, another section of the El Rancho was found to have been renovated with working slot machines, which had been lent to the owners by Bally Gaming three years earlier to showcase to potential investors for the Countryland USA project. After the investigation aired, the property's owners were fined for health and safety violations by the local building and fire departments, as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In addition, LVEN was subsequently investigated by the FBI and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged stock scams and investor fraud. In February 2000, Turnberry Associates acquired a six-month option to purchase the El Rancho from ITB. Two months later, Turnberry agreed to the purchase with plans to demolish the El Rancho. Turnberry considered the resort to be an eyesore and wanted to remove it for future residents of Turnberry Place, ahead of its opening at the end of the year. The sale was finalized in May 2000, at a cost of $45 million. Turnberry considered eventually building a hotel-casino or timeshares on the El Rancho property. A sale of the El Rancho's contents was held beginning on June 1, 2000, but was initially restricted to the first two floors because of safety concerns regarding other areas of the resort. Much clean-up work had to be done to the resort to prepare it for the sale, removing dust and disrepair. Among the items for sale were furnishings, bathroom fixtures, and carpeting. The bowling alley was also for sale, at a cost of $114,000. Other items for sale included 900 televisions and full-sized horse replicas. Gaming equipment was not part of the sale, having been removed by ITB prior to the Turnberry purchase. On October 3, 2000, the resort's last remaining structure, the 13-story hotel tower, was imploded with 700 pounds of dynamite. The implosion took place at 2:30 a.m., and more than 2,000 spectators came to witness it. For safety reasons, the demolition was a subdued event compared to past implosions in Las Vegas. Turnberry had given only minimal publicity to the implosion, in order to minimize the number of spectators. Police officers were brought on to keep crowds at a safe distance. The Algiers Hotel had been covered in plastic to protect it against dust from the implosion. In addition, the hotel did not have any guests at the time of the implosion. Site cleanup for the demolished debris was expected to take two months. Approximately 10,000 pounds of concrete from the demolished resort was used by the Southern Nevada Water Authority and the Las Vegas Wash Coordination Committee to stabilize the Las Vegas Wash. The El Rancho's demolition and implosion were recorded and featured in the 2004 National Geographic Channel documentary Exploding Las Vegas, along with several other Las Vegas casino implosions. Turnberry initially planned to build a London- themed resort on the El Rancho land, but the project was later canceled. The site of the El Rancho and Algiers was later used for the Fontainebleau resort, which began construction in 2007. The project was later renamed and is scheduled to open as The Drew Las Vegas in 2022, following construction delays. ==Entertainers== Patti Page's first Las Vegas performance took place at the Thunderbird in 1948. Nat King Cole was also a frequent entertainer at the Thunderbird. Other notable performers included Donald O'Connor, Mel Torm√©, Rosemary Clooney, James Melton, Bunny Briggs, Rex Allen, Henny Youngman, Margaret Whiting, Peggy Lee, and Judy Garland. Two albums were recorded at the Thunderbird and were released in 1963: Caught in the Act, Vol. 2 by Frances Faye, and At The Las Vegas Thunderbird by Gloria Lynne. The Thunderbird offered numerous shows during its operation. In the late 1950s, The Kim Sisters were among 35 cast members who performed in the resort's China Doll Revue. In 1959, the Thunderbird launched a partially nude ice show known as Ecstasy on Ice. Flower Drum Song opened in December 1961, and proved to be a success. The show was initially only signed for a few weeks, but ultimately ran for nearly a year before being replaced by South Pacific. Flower Drum Song had attracted more than 360,000 people over the course of its run, and South Pacific was also well received. South Pacific closed in 1963, and was replaced by a summer engagement of Flower Drum Song, marking its return to the Thunderbird theatre. The show's run was again extended, until the end of 1963, followed by the launch of Ziegfeld Follies in 1964. Two years later, the resort's Continental Theatre hosted Bottoms Up, becoming the only afternoon entertainment on the Las Vegas Strip. The Thunderbird later hosted Thoroughly Modern Minsky, a show by Harold Minsky. Flower Drum Song returned for a third run in 1969. In 1972, the Thunderbird launched Geisha'rella, a topless revue of Japanese women. In the mid-1970s, the resort hosted entertainers such as Cyd Charisse, Keely Smith, and Tony Martin. Redd Foxx was also a frequent performer, and he held his third wedding at the resort in 1976. A year later, the Silver Bird launched a show titled Playgirls on Ice '77. The Continental Theatre had seating for 620 people at the time. Ipi Tombi, a South African show, debuted at the Silver Bird in 1979, but was ended because of a lack of popularity. In 1981, the financially struggling resort launched a show titled Feminine Touch. In 1990, Rodney Dangerfield opened a comedy club at the El Rancho known as Rodney's Place, which previously had an unsuccessful run at the Tropicana resort. The club presented a variety of comedians. ==Notes References  *Thunderbird photo gallery from University of Nevada, Las Vegas Category:Defunct casinos in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Defunct hotels in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Demolished hotels in Clark County, Nevada Category:Demolished hotels in the United States Category:Skyscraper hotels in Winchester, Nevada Category:Casinos completed in 1948 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1948 Category:Hotels established in 1948 Category:Hotels disestablished in 1992 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2000 Category:Casino hotels Category:1948 establishments in Nevada Category:1992 disestablishments in Nevada Category:American companies disestablished in 1992 Category:American companies established in 1948 Category:Demolished hotels Category:Buildings and structures demolished by controlled implosion ","title":"El Rancho Hotel and Casino"},{"id":"20448157","text":"Dominique Ndjeng (born 4 November 1980) is a German former footballer who played as a defender.

It has been called one of the ten worst natural disasters in Canadian history. The preceding summer had been unusually hot and dry. Fire rangers, anticipating the upcoming \\"burn\\" season, had requested to stay in the area but were not granted permission. They left at the end of the fire season in mid September, leaving the area without fire protection services. In the fall when burning permits were no longer required, farmers and settlers started to set small bush fires to clear the land. Dry conditions had persisted past the usual \\"burn\\" season and on October 4, the wind turned into hurricane-force gales, fanning the flames out of control and combining the brush fires into one large inferno. Over two days, the fire consumed an area of , affecting 18 townships in Ontario. It completely destroyed the communities of North Cobalt, Charlton, Thornloe, Heaslip, and numerous smaller settlements. Englehart and New Liskeard were partly burnt. In all 43 people died.Archaeological and Historic Sites Board, Archives of Ontario In Quebec, the communities of Notre-Dame-du-Nord and neighbouring Notre-Dame-des-Quinze were also devastated. The fires were extinguished when the winds abated and rain and snow began to fall on October 5, 1922. One of the towns hit hardest was Haileybury which burnt down within 3 to 6 hours. Thick smoke caused panic and confusion. The town's residents were forced to take refuge in the cold waters of Lake Timiskaming and cover themselves with wet blankets. The fire destroyed over 90% of the town, killing 11 residents, leaving 3500 people homeless, and causing $2 million of damage. The people of Charlton took refuge in the power house; a baby was even born there that night. The Power House later burned while being used for grain grinding. It was later rebuilt and a plaque was placed to commemorate the fire. An area of 246,000 hectares was destroyed in the fire. Old Toronto street cars en route to Haileybury, 1922 Hardships remained for the survivors, who had lost all their belongings and faced the approaching winter. Consequently, a large emergency relief program was organized for the affected area. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), with many retired street cars in its yards, sent many old car bodies to serve as houses during the reconstruction. Some of these cars remained for years, and one has recently been restored and is in the museum at Haileybury.Canadian Rail, No 479, November-December 2000. Furthermore, the fire had consumed all the nearby forests, causing a severe shortage of firewood and forcing people for many years to travel far in order to obtain it. ==See also== * Great Matheson Fire of 1916 - wildfire with similar circumstances and outcome. * List of Canadian disasters by death toll ==References== 1922 Category:Natural disasters in Ontario Category:1922 fires Category:1922 in Ontario Category:1922 disasters in Canada ","title":"Great Fire of 1922"},{"id":"20448232","text":"Hertfordshire shown in England There are over 9,000 Grade I listed buildings in England.

The project consists of thirteen 14-story buildings containing 1,523 apartment units. == Development == The site formerly consisted of city blocks with small attached homes in poor condition, and existing residents were removed via a slum clearance program.

He played as a goalkeeper. Breedon was born in South Hiendley in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and played for Barnsley, Sheffield Wednesday, Manchester United and Burnley. He also appeared as a wartime guest for Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, and Rochdale during the Second World War. After retiring from playing in 1946, Breedon had spells as manager at both Halifax Town and Bradford Park Avenue). ==Playing career== Breedon worked as a miner while playing amateur football for his village club in South Hiendley before turning professional when he signed for Football League Second Division side Barnsley in September 1928. After making eight league appearances in just over two seasons at Oakwell, he transferred to First Division outfit Sheffield Wednesday in November 1930. Breedon never established himself as first-choice goalkeeper during his time with the Hillsborough club and was predominantly a backup to England international Jack Brown. In total, he played 45 league matches for Wednesday in five seasons before moving to Manchester United in the summer of 1935. Breedon made his debut for Manchester United in the 1‚Äì3 defeat away at Plymouth Argyle on the opening day of the 1935‚Äì36 campaign. He was dropped for the following match in favour of Jack Hall, who went on to keep his place for most of the remaining season as the team were crowned Second Division champions. Following the departure of Hall in 1936, Breedon was unable to capitalise as new signing Tommy Breen was installed as first-choice goalkeeper. Breedon made 13 league appearances in total during his first three years at Old Trafford, but became more involved in the first team during the 1938‚Äì39 season as United achieved a 14th-place finish in the First Division. He had retained his place in the side for the beginning of the following campaign, appearing in the opening three games, but the season was abandoned following the outbreak of the Second World War and the records were expunged. During the war Breedon assisted several teams as a wartime guest player, including Rochdale, Manchester City and Bolton Wanderers. He also played regularly for Manchester United in wartime competitions, but left the club in October 1945 following the emergence of young goalkeeper Jack Crompton. He subsequently signed for Burnley and made his debut for the Turf Moor side in the 2‚Äì1 FA Cup win over Stoke City on 7 January 1946. However, it proved to be his only appearance for Burnley as he was unable to dislodge fellow new signing Jimmy Strong from the starting line- up. Strong went on to become first-choice for the next eight years, playing more than 280 matches for the club. Breedon was released by Burnley in May 1946 and retired from professional football aged 38. ==Coaching career== Following his retirement from playing, Breedon was offered the manager's job at New Brighton but declined the position. In August 1947, he was appointed manager of Third Division North club Halifax Town to replace James Thompson. He spent three years in charge of the Yorkshire side; during this time the team never finished higher than 19th in the division.

It ran from 1974 to 1981 and mainly concentrated on pop music and disco. The acronym represented the Gem Toby Organization. ==Background== The record label was co-founded by Bell Records UK's Dick Leahyhttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/03/dick-leahy-obituary and Gem Records's Laurence Myers in 1974, after Myers had set up GTO Films and Arcade Records in the period between 1972 to 1974. The first GTO release - on 4 July 1974 - was the single \\"Up in a Puff of Smoke\\" by Polly Brown, and the label's focus would remain on pop and disco acts such as Billy Ocean, The Dooleys and Heatwave, and released Donna Summer's albums in the UK, all of which proved to be successful. Lulu also briefly recorded for the label. The biggest hit released by the label was Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\", which reached No.1 in 1977. In 1978, the label was sold to CBS Records after achieving a high level of hits for a new label. From this time, the Donna Summer records moved to Casablanca Records, while the hits for other acts began to dry up over the next two years. The label was wrapped up in late 1981 when its roster of acts were either dropped or moved on to Epic Records - also owned by CBS. Prior to the sale and transfer of artists, Epic distributed many of GTO albums, namely Heatwave's output. The GTO back catalogue is currently owned by Sony Music. ==Hit singles== ;Top 40 singles: * \\"Only You Can\\" - Fox (1975 UK #3) * \\"Imagine Me Imagine You\\" - Fox (1975 UK #15) * \\"Play Me Like You Play Your Guitar\\" - Duane Eddy (1975 UK #9) * \\"Please Tell Him That I Said Hello\\" - Dana (1975 UK #8) * \\"It's Gonna Be a Cold Cold Christmas\\" - Dana (1975 UK #4) * \\"No Regrets\\" - The Walker Brothers (1976 UK #7) * \\"S-S-S-Single Bed\\" - Fox (1976 UK #4) * \\"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\\" - Dana (1976 UK #31) * \\"Fairytale\\" - Dana (1976 UK#13) * \\"Love Really Hurts Without You\\" - Billy Ocean (1976 UK #2) * \\"L.O.D.

Beust was born in the Odenwald, in whose great forests, as a young man, he observed Nature in her large and small aspects and collected her creatures. He learned to ride a horse in the royal stables. In 1834, he became an ensign in the 17th Prussian regiment. Under the guidance of a captain, he drew maps in his free time. He entered the division school at D√ºsseldorf where he was especially interested in geography, which students of Carl Ritter were teaching. He continued his studies of cartography and also science, especially anatomy. In 1845, he was ordered to Fortress Minden, where he came to the conclusion he could not fit into Prussian military discipline, bitterly resigned in 1848, and became a political activist. In 1848 he was delegate from the Cologne Workers' Association to the Second Democratic Congress held in Berlin. At the Congress he spoke in favour of the \\"Demands of the Communist Party in Germany\\" which were written by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. This was the Communist League's political programme for the revolution. Beust took over the operations of the republican Neuen K√∂lnischen Zeitung when the previous publisher, Friedrich Annecke, was arrested for reporting on the Frankfurt Democratic Congress. Despite the efforts of Annecke's wife, Mathilde Franziska (n√©e Giesler), the newspaper was suppressed. He got to know Ferdinand Freiligrath who was helping Frau Annecke put out the Westf√§lischen Jahrbuch, and who, anticipating the coming emigration which would be necessary, wrote him some letters of introduction to people in Paris. He also got to know the social democrat Karl Marx, who was putting out the Neuer Rheinischer Zeitung with Freiligrath. He took over the command of the Cologne militia, and when it interfered with the departure of Prussian troops to D√ºsseldorf to dissolve a regiment there, a state of siege ‚Äî Belagerungszustand ‚Äî was declared for Cologne and Beust's arrest was sought for high treason. At that point he emigrated to Paris. Later he was elected to the military commission for the Baden-Palatinate uprising. Beust soon saw that the chaotic leadership, among other things, would not allow the uprising to accomplish anything useful, and after the Ubstadt und Wagh√§usel battle, lost through ineptitude, he fled with a detachment across the Swiss border at Rheinfelden on June 15. Beust settled in Z√ºrich where he learned the trade of a pedagogue with the innovative teacher Meier while studying botany and chemistry at the university. He obtained an appointment at Karl (nephew of the famous Friedrich) Fr√∂bel's school. Until 1850 another of the teachers at the school was Wilhelm Liebknecht, the Marxist founder of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (1869‚Äì1875). At this point, he stopped using \\"von\\" when he gave his name, but he never formally renounced his claims to nobility. Seeing a return to Germany was out of the question, he joined A. Kirchner in the leadership of his establishment. In 1854 he married Anna Lipka a cousin of Friedrich Engels.B√ºrgi, Markus. \\"Friedrich Engels Und Seine Verwandten Beust in Z√ºrich.

Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 2007 Then he founded his own school, and for the rest of his life devoted all his resources to that, and became a Swiss citizen. The school taught 25 children, and was attended by children living in Z√ºrich and those of well-situated families in Germany. Among them was Ferdinand Fr√∂bel, a grandson of Theodor a brother of Karl Fr√∂bel. Emilie Michaelis, a leader of the Fr√∂bel movement in England said of the school that it was a, 'truly remarkable institution' adding, after referring to Fr√∂bel and Pestalozzi, that, 'this school stands alone in its complete fulfilment of these great educationists' Brehony, Kevin.

London, Routledge, 2001 Beust remained active in socialist politics joining the International Workingmen's Association which became known as the First International in 1886. In 1894, Beust's son, Dr. Fritz von Beust (1856-1908), took over its direction. Beust was especially interested in the teachings of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Fr√∂bel on activities for children, and himself published works on early childhood education. When he died, he was one of the last of the ‚Äú48ers‚Äù living in exile. == Notes  References == * *Carl Schurz, Reminiscences (3 volumes), New York: The McClure Company, 1907.

Weymouth Harbour (or the Old Harbour) is a picturesque harbour at the seaside town of Weymouth in Dorset, southern England,. It has a 17th-century waterfront. ==Overview== The harbour forms the mouth of the River Wey as it enters the Channel. The original Roman port at Radipole to the north was lost to silting (forming Radipole Lake), and the current harbour further downstream, lying between Weymouth Old Town and Melcombe Regis, started to develop in the 12th and 13th centuries. Weymouth Harbour empties into the much larger Portland Harbour to the south and east, which is home to the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy, where the sailing events of the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games were held. Weymouth Harbour has included cross-channel ferries, and is now home to pleasure boats and private yachts. The disused Weymouth Harbour Tramway runs along the north side of the harbour to the also disused Weymouth Quay railway station. Immediately to the north at the harbour entrance is Weymouth Pier, separating the harbour from Weymouth Beach and Weymouth Bay. Weymouth Pavilion and the Jurassic Skyline observation tower could be found here before it's removal. Stone Pier is located on the south side of the harbour entrance. Immediately to the south near the entrance to the harbour are Nothe Gardens with Nothe Fort on the promontory. Nothe Parade runs along the south side of the harbour front, with Wellington Court, the former Red Barracks, built in 1801, above. Brewers Quay is a converted Victorian brewery in Hope Square, a tourist spot south of the Old Harbour. It was formerly the Devenish Brewery. Nearby is the Tudor House Museum, which used to front onto the harbour before the land opposite was reclaimed.

She is the artistic director of MOonhORsE dance theatre. Claudia Moore has been creating and performing movement for theatre, film, multi-disciplinary collaboration and her own dance theatre productions since the late 1970s. Recent works include \\"Ever thus\\" (2006), \\"By night\\" (2004), \\"Casa\\" (2003), \\"On earth\\" (2002) and \\"Small midnight\\" (2001), co-choreographed by Moore and Tedd Robinson. \\"Box pieces\\", her first dance film, was commissioned by director Paul Carri√®re from Canada's Bravo! art channel. Claudia's work has been presented in Montreal, Vancouver, Halifax, Peterborough, Buffalo and New York City. Claudia also choreographed the film Exotica by Atom Egoyan. == The dancer == Moore began ballet class with Stella Appelbaum at the Dance Arts Studio in Buffalo and fell in love with dancing. At age twelve, she became a student at the National Ballet School in Toronto. She began performing with the National Ballet of Canada at sixteen years old, touring Europe and the United States from 1971 to 1973. Her curiosity led her beyond classical ballet. She joined the Felix Blaska Company in France in 1973 and studied physical theatre with Lindsay Kemp in London. Returning to Canada, Claudia danced with the Contemporary Dance Theatre of Montreal. In 1976 she joined the Toronto Dance Theatre and in 1980, became a founding member of Desrosiers Dance Theatre, performing major roles with those companies until 1987. She performed on video and on film, including \\"L'Oiseau de Feu\\" for CBC Montreal and Leonard Cohen's \\"I am a Hotel\\". She also performed original works by Canadian choreographers including Serge Bennathan, Peter Chin, Ginette Laurin, James Kudelka, Lola MacLaughlin and Tedd Robinson. == The choreographer == She choreographed her first work, \\"Chrysalis\\", in 1977 in a workshop at Toronto Dance Theatre. Since that time, she has created more than forty works, which have been performed in Paris, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Her work is character-driven and displays a personal style of dance-theatre, influenced by her studies with physical theatre artists Lindsay Kemp, Yoshi Oida and Philippe Gaulier. Her movement vocabulary is rich in gesture and finds expression in the entire body. Texts are often incorporated into the work, with sources ranging from Shakespeare to the original work of Claudia's own cast. She also works closely with composers, musicians and designers to create in each project a hybrid of dance, theatre, music, performance art and visual design. == MOonhORsE Dance Theatre == In 1996, she founded MOonhORsE dance theatre (\\"moon\\" for poetry, \\"horse\\" for physical) as a forum for the deepening of her choreographic language and the creation of contemporary dance. Since its inception, the company has created an original body of dance theatre. Moore's choreography is \\"body poetry\\", expressing the human condition with a startling physical imagination.

Born in Kikinda, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, his father was a footballer. Keri started his career by playing in local side ≈ΩAK Kikinda where he debuted in the first-team being only 16. Scouts of numerous clubs noticed this youngster and, while his parents were favoring a move to FK Vojvodina, Keri himself decided to join Red Star Belgrade in 1968. At that time Miljan Miljaniƒá was Red Star coach and he fancied Keri because of his calm character, specially when compared to other established stars which had exuberant lives. He debuted for Red Star Belgrade first-team in the 1969‚Äì70 Yugoslav First League making 13 league appearances that season, quite a remarkable achievement for an 18-year-old youngster at that time. Initially he played as a striker, but he also played as a midfielder and a full-back as well. Since then he became a regular in the team for the following decade only missing the 1976‚Äì77 season because of the Yugoslav Army conscription. He left Red Star during the winter break of the 1978‚Äì79 season and moved to the United States.Mihalj Keri at redstarbelgrade.info In 1979, he moved to the United States where he signed with the Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League.

In the 1680s, the Margraviate of Brandenburg, then leading the broader realm of Brandenburg-Prussia, pursued limited imperial efforts in West Africa. The Brandenburg African Company was chartered in 1682 and established two small settlements on the Gold Coast of what is today Ghana. Five years later, a treaty with the king of Arguin in Mauritania established a protectorate over that island, and Brandenburg occupied an abandoned fort originally constructed there by Portugal. Brandenburg ‚Äî after 1701, the Kingdom of Prussia ‚Äî pursued these colonial efforts until 1721, when Arguin was captured by the French and the Gold Coast settlements were sold to the Dutch Republic. Over a century and a half later, the unified German Empire had emerged as a major world power. In 1884, pursuant to the Berlin Conference, colonies were officially established on the African west coast, often in areas already inhabited by German missionaries and merchants. The following year gunboats were dispatched to East Africa to contest the Sultan of Zanzibar's claims of sovereignty over the mainland in what is today Tanzania. Settlements in modern Guinea and Nigeria's Ondo State failed within a year; those in Cameroon, Namibia, Tanzania and Togo quickly grew into lucrative colonies. Together these four territories constituted Germany's African presence in the age of New Imperialism. They were invaded and largely occupied by the colonial forces of the Allied Powers during World War I, and in 1919 were transferred from German control by the League of Nations and divided between Belgium, France, Portugal, South Africa and the United Kingdom. The six principal colonies of German Africa, along with native kingdoms and polities, were the legal precedents for the modern states of Burundi, Cameroon, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania and Togo. Parts of contemporary Chad, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, the Central African Republic and the Republic of the Congo were also under the control of German Africa at various points during its existence. == List of colonies == *Established by Brandenburg-Prussia, 1682‚Äì1721: **Arguin **Brandenburger Gold Coast *Established by the German Empire, 1884‚Äì1919: **German East Africa **German South West Africa **German West Africa ***Kamerun and Neukamerun ***Togoland ==See also== *German colonial empire *List of former German colonies *German colonization of the Americas *Languages of Africa Category:German colonisation in Africa ","title":"German colonization of Africa"},{"id":"20448718","text":"Matevz Frang was a politician in Slovenia during the early 16th century when it was under the Holy Roman Empire.

Bourne, was removed by Monitor because it was failing to meet clinical targets. In November 2013 the Care Quality Commission reported that it had found discrepancies between the hospital's cancer waiting time records and the information contained in patients' individual medical records. 22 out of 61 records showed people had been put \\"at risk of receiving care that was unsafe or not effective, due to delays in receiving appointments or treatment\\". In November 2013 the Trust was placed in special measures by Monitor. Gordon Coutts, the chief executive, who had been on sick leave announced on 18 December 2013 that he would not be returning to the post. After an investigation it was concluded that the inaccuracies the hospital's cancer waiting times figures were caused by managerial incompetence rather than bullying of staff. In November 2017 it was taken out of special measures after it was rated good for whether services were effective, caring and well led. The children‚Äôs transition team and neonatal unit were found to be outstanding. In November 2014 the Trust declared a \\"major incident\\" following an inspection by the Care Quality Commission in which \\"safeguarding concerns\\" were raised. Interim chief executive Dr Lucy Moore said the focus was on \\"discharging patients.\\" The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter.

In the case of the species Homo sapiens, for example, there are a significant number of antigens that are different in every individual. When antigens from another individual are introduced into another's body, these isoantibodies immediately bind to and destroy them. One common example is the isohaemagglutinins, which are responsible for blood transfusion reactions. This may subjectively differ from the term 'natural' antibodies, or simply 'antibodies', as the former seem to arise from genetic control without apparent antigenic stimulation whereas the latter arise due to antigenic stimulation. ==Isoantigens== A protein or other substance, such as histocompatibility or red blood cell antigens, that is present in only some members of a species and therefore able to stimulate isoantibody production in other members of the same species who lack it. When injected into another animal, they trigger an immune response aimed at eliminating them. Therefore, it can be thought of as an antigen that is present in some members of the same species, but is not common to all members of that species. If an alloantigen is presented to a member of the same species that does not have the alloantigen, it will be recognized as foreign. They are the products of polymorphic genes.Abbas AK and Lichtman AH. Basic Immunology: Functions and Disorders of the Immune System. Second Edition, Updated Edition 2006-2007. Elsevier Saunders Publishing. ==Production of isohaemagglutinins== Isoantibodies are seen in people with different blood groups. The anti-A or anti-B isoantibodies or both (also called isohaemagglutinins) are produced by an individual against the antigens (A or B) on the RBCs of other blood groups. In a person with A blood group, the plasma will contain isoantibodies against B antigens, so immediately after transfusion of blood from B group the anti-B isohemagglutinins agglutinate the foreign red blood cells. Anti-A and anti-B antibodies (called isohaemagglutinins), which are not present in human babies, appear in the first years of life. It is possible that food and environmental antigens (bacterial, viral or plant antigens) have epitopes similar enough to A and B glycoprotein antigens. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens in the first years of life can cross react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells when it comes in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM type. O-type individuals can produce IgG-type ABO antibodies. ==See also== * ABO blood group system * Alloimmunity * Antibodies ==References== Category:Immunology ","title":"Isoantibodies"},{"id":"20448750","text":"Anton Lantheri was a politician in Slovenia during the early 16th century when it was under the Holy Roman Empire.

Aziz. [2d Rev. Ed.], 1964, p 71, Abdul Aziz - Pakistan.Islamic Thought and Movements in the Subcontinent, 711-1947, 1979, p 278, Syed Moinul Haq. He participated in some of the most difficult expeditions of Akbar and annexed numerous territories to the empire. He was too orthodox a Sunni Muslim for Akbar's taste, but not only was he tolerated but also was greatly valued.Advanced History of Medieval India, 1995, p 376, S.R. Bakshi. ==Early life and family background== Shahbaz Khan had entered Mughal service during Akbar's time. The Emperor was very much impressed by his sagacity and sharpness of intellect at the very first sight and soon elevated him to the rank of Mir Tozak (Quarter-Master General) and later to an Amir (Minister). Shahbaz Khan was very capable officer and a brave soldier and had rendered meritorious service to the Mughal empire in various capacities.Encyclopaedic Survey of Islamic Culture, 1997, p 112, Mohamed Taher. From a mansab of 100, he rapidly rose the number to 5000. As a Governor of Bengal, when operating in Brahmputra, Shahbaz Khan had commanded 9000 strong cavalry. He was an all-rounder officer and besides his military duties, he also helped Akbar in civil administration and financial matters. He became a very close confidant, a companion, a Mir Bakhshi (head of the military department, holding the rank of imperial minister) and a Vakil (Chief Administrator or Prime Minister) of Akbar and had acquired and exercised great powers. In 1581, when Emperor Akbar marched against Mirza Hakim to the Punjab, Shahbaz Khan came to Fatehpur and for about ten months, he took in his hands the reins of state administration in the absence of the Emperor.Proceedings - Indian History Congress, 1976, p 191, Indian History Congress - History; Journal of Indian History, 1976, p 372, University of Kerala Dept. of History, University of Allahabad Dept. of Modern Indian History, University of Travancore, University of Kerala. ==As a General== In 1572, General Lashkar Khan entered the royal court in a drunken state and challenged anybody to come and fight with him. His rowdy and blatant behavior annoyed His Majesty so much that he was ordered to be arrested, tied to the tail of a horse and dragged and finally thrown into the prison. He was replaced with Shahbaz Khan whom the emperor made his Mir Bakshi (Paymaster-General). The title of Shahbaz Khan was also conferred on him. ===Introducing Dagh-o-Mahali=== As soon as Shahbaz Khan became Mir Bakshi, he introduced the Dagh-o-Mahali (a branding system) which had considerably cut down the over-heads as well as the corruption prevalent in the military departments of the kingdom. The system had been earlier in vogue during Alauddin Khalji as well as Sher Shah Suri but was discontinued during Mughal rule and was replaced with fief system which came to be badly misused by the Amirs and the officers. Under this system, the country was divided into numerous fiefs which were distributed among the Amirs. Unfortunately, they had become greedy, corrupt and oppressive and often also rebellious. Major part of the revenue was misappropriated by the fief-holders for personal use. Shahbaz Khan changed the system and handled the branding system with such a skill and competency that not only it ended the rampant corruption but also improved discipline in the military and reduced needless financial burden on the imperial treasury. But the new system had earned Shahbaz Khan the hatred of the nobles like Mirza Aziz Koka (Akbar the Great, 1962, p 357, Ashirbadi Lal Srivastava). He severely criticized the new system.Medieval India, 1969, p 50, Aligarh Muslim University Dept. of History. Centre of Advanced Study. ===Battle against Arab Bahadur=== General Shahbaz Khan had nearly driven Rana Pratap from the country when he was summoned by the emperor and sent with an army to support the forces in Bengal against Arab Bahadur. When Shahbaz Khan came near to Hajipur where Arab Bahadur had taken refuge with Raja Gajpati, he marched to attack him. For one month he carried operations against him clearing away the jungle and finally drove off Arab Bahadur and made the Raja Gajpati submit. ===Battle against Bahadhur Khan-i- Shaibani=== Bahadhur Khan-i-Shaibani and his brother Khan Zaman-i-Shaibani were Amir Viziers in the court of Akbar and both were holding big Jagirs, but as luck would have it, they rebelled against the emperor. With the help of Shahbaz Khan, Akbar crushed the rebellion with an iron hand. General Khan Zaman-i-Shaibani was killed in the battle but Bahadhur Khan was executed by Shahbaz Khan and Rai Bansi Das Kamboh on orders of the emperor. ==As Governor of Bengal== On 18 May 1583, Shahbaz Khan was appointed Governor of Bengal. Initially, he had commanded 5000 cavalry and had distinguished himself greatly in Bengal, but later when operating in Brahmputra, he had commanded 9000 strong cavalry. Tarsun Khan was engaged in war against Masum Khan. Shahbaz Khan's forces invested Dinajpur and Masum Khan was thus besieged in Dinajpur. The combined forces of Shahbaz Khan and Tarsun Khan attacked Masum Khan on November 15, 1583, but the latter fled to Bhati while Jabbari, an ally of Masum Khan, fled to Koch Bihar. Masum Khan got refuge with Isa Khan at Bhati. ===Battle against Isa Khan=== In 1584, Shahbaz Khan crossed Ganges near Khizirpur and seized Sonargaon and ravaged Bakatpur where Isa Khan was trenched. Initially he achieved a considerable success and even ravaged Katrabo, Khizirpur, Sonargaon and Egarasindur but finally suffered a defeat in the battle of Egarasindur and Bhawal. He was forced to retreat to Tandah. With reinforcements sent by Akbar, Shahbaz Khan again marched towards Bhati in 1586. Isa Khan attacked Shahbaz Khan at Bhawal (north of Dhaka) but forces of Shahbaz Khan were well fortified near Brahmaputra. Shahbaz Khan had commanded a 9000 strong cavalry at Brahmaputra. In 1585, Shahbaz Khan subdued Raja of Kukrah or Coira Orissa (Chhota Nagpur) a tributary to the Crown. According to Ai‚Äôn-i-Akbari, Kukrah or Coira Orissa was a part of Bihar Subah.Proceedings - Indian History Congress, 1977, p 350, Indian History Congress. Shahbaz Khan was sent to Deccan to help Murad. Shahbaz Khan reduced one Tiyuldar of Madhopur fort and obtained tribute from him. During conquest of Ahmmad Nagar, Shahbaz Khan harassed the Muslims and ravaged their houses which was greatly resented by Murad. Thereby, Shahbaz Khan left Murad without permission and reached Malwa. Akbar took away his Jagir and gave it Shah-Rukh and transferred Shahbaz Khan. ===Reappointed as Governor of Bengal=== In November 1586, Shahbaz Khan was again appointed Governor of Bengal in which capacity he served for two years before leaving in 1588. Shahbaz Khan was one of the best Khan during his governorship of Bangala and Orissa. Shahbaz Khan had also subdued the pride of Raja Ram Chander Sain, Rai Surjan Handa & Dauda, Farhat Khan, Raja Gajpati, Raja Sri Ram, Rana Sangram as well as the officers of Surat. He reduced Jagdenpur, Ara, Shergarh, and Rahitas etc. These conquests had greatly enhanced the prestige and status of Shahbaz Khan which were greatly appreciated by Akbar. In 1589 AD, General Shabaz Khan led an expedition from Attock against the Yousafzai Afghans and defeated and dispersed them. ===Imprisoned=== Shahbaz Khan had been kept in confinement for three years before he paid a fine (ransom) of seven lacs of rupees. He was set free in 1599 and appointed as the deputy to the prince Jahangir in the administration of the province of Ajmer (Malwa). He was the General Administrator of Malwa which office he held till his death.Advanced Study in the History of Medieval India, 1981, p 226, Jaswant Lal Mehta; Origin & Development of Legal & Political System in India: Ed. H.S. Bhatia., 1976, p 79, Harbans Singh Bhatia. Shahbaz Khan died of illness on 11 November 1599 at Ajmer at the age of over 70 years. ==As an administrator== Historian Abu-L- Fazl Alami, the author of Aiana-i-Akbari, attests that Shahbaz Khan was a very competent and capable General but Abu-L-Fazal also accuses him for his bigoted Sunni views and arrogance. Many a times, he strongly opposed the emperor, but Akbar had a great regard for Shahbaz Khan and took it lightly. The 9000 strong cavalry of General Shahbaz Khan is said to have comprised mostly the Kamboj (Kamboh) horsemen and it included both the Muslim as well as the Hindu Kamboj soldiers.Nobility Under the Great Mughals: Based on Dhakhƒ´ratul Khawanƒ´n of Shaikh Farƒ´d Bhakkari, 2003, p 245, Shaikh Farid Bhakkari, Ziyaud-Din A. Desai. Shahbaz Khan was known for his generosity and liberality and the money he spent was so great that it made the people think that he had in his possession Philosopher's stone. He left behind a huge Jagir , treasures and other wealth.Rise and Fall of the Mughal Empire, 1969, p 336, Mogul Empire. which was seized by Jahangir, son of Emperor Akbar after his death.Encyclopaedic Survey of Islamic Culture: Growth & Development, 1998, p 112, Mohamed Taher; Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals Part - II, p 126, Satish Chandra. ==As a religious man== Shabaz Khan belonged the family whose ancestors were all celebrated for piety, asceticism and religiosity. Shahbaz Khan in early part of his life was celebrated for his religiosity till he first became deputy Kotwal of the Chabutara when he displayed his awareness of the (affairs of the) kingdom and judicious disposal of matters. Afterwards, he became Kotwal and became a favorite of Emperor Akbar. He was a capable officer and brave fighter and had rendered meritorious service to the state in various capacities. A leading courtier of Akbar, he was strict follower of the law of Shari‚Äôah and profusely recited blessings on Muhammad and distributed large sum of money in charities.Encyclopaedic Survey of Islamic Culture, 1997, p 112, Mohamed Taher. Every Friday, he would donate one hundred Asharfis (gold coins) in memory of Abdul-Qadir Gilani. Shahbaz Khan himself was deeply religious and pious man. He did not put on dress outside the sanction of simna (i.e. which had no sanction of Muhammad's action). He always carried a rosary in his hand, reciting all the while invocations of God's salutations on Muhammad and between the evening and sunset prayers, he would sit down facing west (qibla) and offering nimaz. He did not follow other Khans as long as he was alive in shaving off his beard and drinking wine and did not have (the word) Murid on his signet. He remained steadfast in the religion of Islam and left his name in the world of generosity and religiosity.Road to Pakistan: A Comprehensive History of the Pakistan Movement, 1947, edition 1990, p 187,Hakim Mohammad Said - Muslims. Emperor Akbar tried his best to bring General Shahbaz Khan and another General Qutb-ud-din Muhammad Khan Koka into his new faith known as Din-i-Ilahi but the move was strongly criticized by both of them.Muslim Civilizatiuon in India, New York, Columbia University Press, 1964 , XII. Religion at Akbar's Court, S. M. Ikram, (Ed) Ainslie T. Embree. This, according to Abu-L-Fazl had created obstacles in his promotion upwards. On the other hand, many incompetent and junior officers got promoted which they did never deserve. ==ReferencesSee also== * Kamboj in Muslim and British Era * List of rulers of Bengal * Kamboj * Kambojas Category:1529 births Category:1599 deaths Category:Mughal generals Category:Medieval India Category:16th-century soldiers ","title":"Shahbaz Khan Kamboh"},{"id":"20448827","text":"Pongrac Lustaller was a politician in Slovenia during the first half of the 16th century when it was under the Holy Roman Empire.

They are mid-sized to smallish beetles, typically with dark metallic hues - often reddish or bronze, but sometimes black, green etc. The genus is generally native to the Holarctic and the Mediterranean region; their southern limit in Central Asia and the Himalaya region is less well understood, and they seem to range outward a bit out of their core regions (e.g. into East Africa). They are wet-loving throughout their life cycle; for example, the genus is well represented in Ireland, where they are more plentiful than anywhere else in Europe. ==Subgenera and selected species== While some subgenera are accepted by most authors (e.g. Europhilus, Olisares and of course Agonum), others are of disputed validity. Moreover, subgeneric separation has historically been mostly focussed on European and Japanese species.

Shaikh Jamali Kamboh of Delhi and brother of the 'Master of Expression' ‚ÄîShaikh Abd-al-Hai Hayati. His real name was Abdur Rehman but he became famous as Gadai. He was well-renowned for his sanctity and learning and was in high favour with emperor Humayun and Bairam Khan. He is also said to have remained a Musahib of the Afghan emperor Salim Shah Suri.Muntakhbu-a-Twarikh, Vol I, p 419,  ªAbd al-QƒÅdir ibn Mul≈´k ShƒÅh BadƒÅ º≈´nƒ´. During Akbar‚Äôs reign, he occupied the high office of ‚ÄúSadr-i-sadur‚Äù of Hindustan. ==Early career== Shaikh Gadai‚Äôs father Shaikh Jamali Kamboh had been an important courtier of Mughal emperors Babur as well as Humayun‚Äôs court. On Jamali‚Äôs death, emperor Humayun appointed Shaikh Gadai as his courtier. But after Humayun's defeat by Sher Shah Suri near Kanawdi in 1540 AD, Shaikh Gadai went to Gujarat. After the disastrous battle of Kanauj and the consequent troubles, Bairam Khan, an important Turkoman noble of emperor Humayun, took refuge in Gujarat where he was rendered a great help by Shaikh Gadai. It is stated that Bairam Khan had escaped from near Gwalior through the efforts and exertions of Shaikh Gadai and Babbal Khan.Bairam Khan,1992, p 67, fn 6, Sukumar Ray, M. H. A. Beg; Also: M.A.A. fol. 64a.It is also said that Bairam Khan and Abu-'l-Qasim waited for the men of Shaikh Gadai and Babbal Khan who had after the defeat of Humayun had gone to Gujarat and had been kindly received by Sultan Mahmud and they arranged their leaving Ujjain for Gujarat by way of Mandu and Asir (Bairam Khan,1992, p 67, fn 6, Sukumar Ray, M. H. A. Beg); See also: Ref M.A.A. fol. 172a-b quoted by the authors in the above text. Later, Shaikh Gadai went to Arabia for pilgrimage. On his return, he remained in Gujarat for a while where he was joined by his numerous Murids and became famous in Gujarat for his opulent sessions of Sama. ==Shaikh Gadai as Sadr-i-sadur of Hindustan== With the restoration of Mughal rule in 1555, the political situation changed and Shaikh Gadai Kamboh re-joined Humayun‚Äôs court sometime before his death in March 1556. On Humayun's death, when Khan-i Khana, Bairam Khan became the regent of emperor Akbar, he soon issued a firman appointing Shaikh Gadai to the high office of ‚ÄúSadr-i-sadur‚Äù (Administrator General or Lord Chief Justice) of Emperor Akbar.Life and Achievements of Muhammad Bairam Khan Turkoman, 1978, p 183, Ram Kishore Pandey; Akbar, 1980, p 77, Muni Lal; Bairam Khan, 1992, p 173-74, Sukumar Ray, M.

He also enjoyed more latitude than others in the matters of selecting king's departmental officers.Bairam Khan, Section XI, The Regime of Shaikh Gadai, 1992, p 174, Sukumar Ray, M. H. A. Beg - Nobility. The office of \\"Sadr-i-sadur\\" had been very important before the Mughals' rule and even during Akbar‚Äôs reign, he was ranked the third most powerful officer in the empire. It was his legal edict which legalized the accession of new king. By the time of Akbar the office had however, become corrupt especially so in the administration of grants & pensions and hence after assuming the office, the first thing the Shaikh did was to draw the pen of obliteration through the grants and pensions of the old servants of the crown in order to control the widespread corruption.Glossary of Tribes, Vol-1, p 499, H. A. Rose. Numerous old grantees and pensionees were thus affected by this step including probably also the chronicler BadƒÅ º≈´nƒ´ (a cleric), the author of Muntakhbu-a-Twarikh. Apparently hurt by this drastic administrative action, BadƒÅ º≈´nƒ´ accordingly makes very vitriolic and personal attacks on Shaikh Gadai Kamboh. Mughal historian \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni (Abd al-QƒÅdir ibn Mul≈´k ShƒÅh BadƒÅ º≈´nƒ´) witnesses that Shaikh Gadai Kamboh achieved the rank of \\"Sadr-i-sadur\\" of emperor Akbar and, ‚Äúfor several years, he was resorted to as an authority on the religious questions by the sages and principal men of Hindustan, Khurasan, Transoxians and Iraq ‚Äú .MuntakÃ≤hÃ≤abu-t-tawƒÅrƒ´kÃ≤hÃ≤, 1973, p 122,  ªAbd al-QƒÅdir ibn Mul≈´k ShƒÅh BadƒÅ º≈´nƒ´, Trans: George Speirs Alexander Ranking, William Henry Lowe, T. W. Haig, Published by Idarah-i-Adabiyat-i- Delli.Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals Part - II, p 96, Satish Chandra. Shaikh Gadai was the right-hand man of Bairam Khan. Bairam Khan never did any political or financial business without consulting the Shaikh. Shaikh Gadai also obtained powers to put his seal on the firmans. He was exempted from the ceremony of homage and in assemblies, he was given precedence over Saiyids and Ulemas. His position was so high that he did not have to dismount the horse when paying respects to the king.Bairam Khan, 1992, p 173-74, Sukumar Ray, M. H. A. Beg - Nobility. Emperor Akbar had a great respect for the Shaikh. Everyone in the Darbar-a-Akbari was required to bow his head and wave his beard to pay obeisance to the emperor, but Shaikh Gadai was an exception. The emperor himself would come to the Shaikh to seek his blessings. Both Bairam Khan and Akbar used to be often present in his house at \\"Sama\\" sessions or singing parties. As \\"Sadr-i-sadur\\", Shaikh Gadai had wielded immense powers in the matters of general administration. During Akbar reign, the office of \\"Sadr-i-sadur\\" ranked third or fourth in the empire. His powers were immense. He was the highest law officer and had the powers which the Administrators-General have amongst us in modern times; he was in-charge of all lands dedicated to ecclesiastical and benevolent purposes and possessed an almost unlimited authority of conferring such lands independently of the king. He was also the highest ecclesiastical law officer and exercised the powers of High Inquistor A'in-i-Akbari, Blochman, Vol I, p. 268 ; Akbar and the Jesuits, 1996, p 266, Pierre Du Jarric, Du Jarric Pierre. ==Mughal Historians's criticism of Shaikh Gadai== Mughal historians of Akbar's reign who compiled their works after the fall of Bairam Khan are very critical of Shaikh Gadai and accuse him of arrogance, high-handedness and favoritism in the distribution of land grants and stipends among the Shaikhs, Sayyids, Scholars and other deserving persons. So much so, even Akbar complained in his firman to Bairam Khan issued at the time of latter's dismissal that one of his misdeeds was the elevation of Shaikh Gadai to the \\"Sadarat\\" in preference to the Sayyids and other Ulemas. However, it was soon later found that these complaints and grievances were concocted by Chugtai Turk nobles to provide young Akbar with a pretext to remove Bairam Khan, a Turkoman, from the power.William Charles Brice, An Historical Atlas of Islam, 1981, p 312. According to Shaikh Rizk Allah Mushtakt who is the earliest source on this issue, Shaikh Gadai had played a very important role at the beginning of Akbar's reign and Bairam Khan did not transact any political and financial business without consulting him. The dominant orthodox Chugtai Turk nobles who wanted to get rid of Bairam Khan because of his being an Iranized Turk as well as for his Shiite beliefs, always tried to poison Akbar's ears against him. They also got annoyed with Shaikh Gadai Kamboh his right-hand man when he refused to toe their line to join hands with them against Bairam Khan and betray him, in spite of the fact that the Shaikh himself was an orthodox Sunni.Satish Chandra, Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals Part - II, 1999, p 96. It is wrongly stated by some writers that Shaikh Gadai Kamboh was Shia Muslim. \\"While it appears that Bairam Khan held Shiite beliefs.....Shaikh Gadai was undoubtedly a Sunni and not a Shiite\\".Medieval India, 1969, p 35, Centre of Advanced Study, Aligarh Muslim University, Dept. of History - India BadƒÅ º≈´nƒ´, himself a Sunni, simply reflects extreme Sunni opinions when he makes Shaikh Gadai the special target of his personal attacks.Abd al-QƒÅdir BadƒÅ º≈´nƒ´ laments: \\"The Chief Imam, at this exaltation of Shaikh Gadai about the eminence of whose family they had stories, went mourning from house to house and again the princes and nobles of the kingdom, as many as came flew into rage at the advancement, honor, and unreasonable exaltation of Shaikh Gadai\\" (Ref: Bairam Khan, 1992, p 174, Sukumar Ray, M. H. A. Beg).Cf Satish Chandra, Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals Part - II, 1999, p 96: BadƒÅ æ≈´nƒ´ plaintively writes: \\"The honor (Sadr-i-Sadur) thus conferred gave the Shaikh the precedence over the magnates or grandees (akabir) of Hindustan and Khorasan\\".Munta·∏µ·∫ñabu-t-tawƒÅrƒ´·∏µ·∫ñ, 1884, p 22,  ªAbd al-QƒÅdir ibn Mul≈´k ShƒÅh BadƒÅ æ≈´nƒ´, Trans: George Speirs Alexander Ranking, William Henry Lowe, T. W. Haig.The History of India, As told by its own Historians, p 259, Henry M. Elliot. ==Shaikh's personal attributes== As a man of pleasant wit and acquired excellence,Bairam Khan, 1992, p 173, Sukumar Ray, M. H. A. Beg - Nobility. Shaikh was a born poet and used to compose and sing verses both in Persian and Hindi. He was also a gifted musician and his musical compositions were very famous during Akbar‚Äôs reign which he used to sing after the Indian manner of which pursuits he was passionately addicted MuntakÃ≤hÃ≤abu-t-tawƒÅrƒ´kÃ≤hÃ≤, Vol 3, 1973, p 122, Vol 2, pp 16-29, 30, Abd al-QƒÅdir ibn Mul≈´k ShƒÅh BadƒÅ º≈´nƒ´ (Translated from the original Persian and edited by Sir Wolseley Haig.

The canning company began with a US$10,000 investment. The firm initially marketed canned peas, beans, fruits and other produce for local farmers. In its early years (from 1901 until 1908), the company struggled.Michigan Historical Commission In 1908, the United States‚Äô economy in general recovered from a slump; the company then became profitable. ==Expansion== The firm expanded the plant in the pre-World War I years of 1914 and 1915, from seasonal to year-round production. Western Michigan and Fremont were hit by a postwar slump in 1919 to 1920 which slowed the company‚Äôs sales and growth. In the later 1920s, growth and profits resumed. Gerber‚Äôs son, Daniel, joined the company at this time. ==Product shift== The major change in the cannery company‚Äôs direction came about around 1927 to 1928. Daniel suggested that they start making baby food; the idea originated with his wife, Dorothy.Sheth, p. 230 The couple had an ill baby daughter, Sally, who required extra care. A pediatrician suggested they prepare special food for the infant.Belasco, p. 102 This food was prepared with special cooking and straining methods, requiring much labor on the part of Dorothy Gerber. She suggested to Dan that perhaps they could make baby food at the canning company, since the only other way of obtaining this product was by prescription, which was very expensive. She thought that a market might exist for others in a similar situation. The canning company was already producing similar products for adults.Avakian, p. 73-74 The company researched producing and selling baby food. They planned to sell the product for less than half the prescription price.Shapiro, p. 32 One of the keys to the canning company‚Äôs successful marketing was an advertisement for baby food placed in Good Housekeeping magazine. It got mothers of infants to participate directly in a coupon redemption program. The introductory offer was six cans of the canning company‚Äôs soup and strained vegetables for $1.00 in exchange for the name of a favorite grocer. They sought to generate enough responses that they could offer proof to grocers of the new demand for stocking their baby food on shelves. This campaign stressed the nutritional and time-saving value of its foods.Ingham, p. 444 ==Marketing== The canning company‚Äôs brokers were then able persuade grocers to stock their baby foods. The marketing idea was successful and within sixty days \\"Gerber Strained Foods\\" had gained national distribution to some extent. There was almost full national distribution within six months. It also became world known about this time. Fremont Canning Company had created the new U.S. industry of commercial baby food.Ingham, p. 443 This small town cannery was the basis for the later baby food industry.Young, p. 182 Gerber introduced the first commercial line of baby food in 1931. ==The Gerber Baby== The \\"Gerber Baby\\" symbol was initiated to reassure mothers and grocers that the concept was sound and to help identify the product. The sales in the first year was over a half million cans which produced gross revenues exceeding a third of a million dollars. During the Great Depression of the 1930s the canning company expanded its baby food lines. Some of the techniques they employed to increase its production output were: :* published child care pamphlets :* helping farmers improve their crops :* hiring of special scientists for food laboratory experiments :* issuing classroom guides for home economics and nutrition classes. ==Gerber Products Company== In 1938 the canning company started dealing directly with the wholesaler. This proved beneficial and by 1941 baby foods exceeded adult foods in their production lines. The company then changed its name to the \\"Gerber Products Company\\" since it was devoting itself solely to baby foods. The consumer demand was for a million cans of baby food every week. The company dropped its adult foods altogether by 1943 and, soon thereafter, opened a second baby food plant in Oakland, California. Other plants were subsequently opened in New York and Canada. The company's timing was excellent in that it was best prepared to meet the post-World War II baby boom. The former Fremont Canning Company had become the basis for the burgeoning baby food industry. The company introduced its trademark slogan: \\"Babies are our business ... our only business.\\"Yale, p. 8 In later years, this slogan on packaging was shortened to only \\"Babies are our business\\". Additionally, in the 1970s and 1980s, this slogan was \\"Babies are our business ... and have been for over 50 years\\". ==ReferencesSources== * Avakian, Arlene Voski et al., From Betty Crocker to Feminist Food Studies, Liverpool University Press (2005), * Belasco, Warren James et al., Food Nations, Routledge (2002), * Ingham, John N., Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders: A-G, Greenwood Publishing Group (1983), * Michigan Historical Commission (1987), Michigan History Magazine, Michigan Dept. of State, Michigan Bureau of History * Shapiro, Eileen C., Fad Surfing in the Boardroom, Basic Books (1996), * Sheth, Jagdish, The Rule of Three, Simon and Schuster (2002), * Yale University Press (2006), The Yale Book of Quotations, * Young, William H., The Great Depression in America, Greenwood Publishing Group (2007), Category:Food and drink companies of the United States Category:Canned food Category:Companies based in Michigan Category:Newaygo County, Michigan Category:American companies established in 1901 Category:Food and drink companies established in 1901 Category:1901 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Fremont Canning Company"},{"id":"20448984","text":"Jurij Tiffrer was a 16th-century politician in Slovenia when the country was under the Holy Roman Empire.

The film was the first directorial effort for Zhang, who was previously an established theater director in Beijing. Mid-Afternoon Barks is a surrealist triptych of stories that take place in Beijing, all involving the installation of electrical poles. The film shared the Dragons and Tigers Award at the 2007 Vancouver International Film Festival with Fujian Blue by director Weng Shouming. == Plot == The first of three stories told in Mid-Afternoon Barks, \\"The Village and the Stranger\\", follows a herdsman (Zhang Yuedong) who has abandoned his flock for a village in the Beijing municipality. Taking residence with his roommate (Qieli Dunzhu), he is asked by his landlord (Gadi Qieli) to install an electric metal pole in the courtyard outside their apartment. It becomes increasingly difficult to determine, however, whether the request was part of a dream or not, or indeed if the herdsman is even in Beijing. In the second tale, entitled \\"City, Wood, Repairman\\", three workmen (played by Han Dong, Chu Cheng, and Gouzi) in the city are installing poles but to no apparent purpose. A seemingly unrelated but parallel story between a repairman (Quan Ke) and a young man (the film's composer Xiao He) rounds out this part of the film. In the final tale, \\"Watermelon and Farmer\\", a farmer (Xiao He, again), is constantly bothered by rude customers, children, and workmen, who make him move his cart in order to attach electrical wires to the film's ubiquitous poles. == Cast == * Zhang Yuedong as a shepherd who leaves his flock to visit the outskirts of Beijing. * Qieli Dunzhu as the shepherd's roommate in his new village. * GaDi Qieli as the shepherd's landlady. * Xiao He plays two roles, including a young man in the second part of the triptych and a watermelon seller in the film's conclusion. * Han Dong, Chu Cheng, and Gouzi play three workmen in Beijing for the film's second story. * Quan Ke as a repairman in Beijing. * Dong Zi as one of the watermelon seller's rude customers. == Style == For one critic, Mid-Afternoon Barks was \\"a distinctive debut that doesn't quite resemble any other Chinese pic out there,\\" and a film that had an \\"absurdist perspective.\\" A description of the film for its North American premiere at the Vancouver International Film Festival suggested that the \\"unfinished\\" nature of the encounters that the characters go through are suggestive of a dream state, an observation echoed by critics. The film's soundtrack is equally bizarre, incorporating seemingly random noises (including titular barking) whose sources are never revealed. Variety's Derek Elley wrote how, \\"the enchanting score by Xiao He... brims with strange, percussive sounds and accompanies the sharply edited scenes (often punctuated by brief blackouts)...\\" == Reception == The release of Mid-Afternoon Barks announced a new voice in Chinese cinema. Time Out's David Jenkins wrote that the film, while requiring a tremendous amount of patience from the audience, was nevertheless a \\"dreamy, lyrical, and often baffling journey.\\" For some critics, however, the same qualities that were lyrical or dreamy to others proved alienating, and that the film's tone could have been matched by simply \\"taking a walk outside.\\" Making its North American premiere at the Vancouver International Film Festival, Mid-Afternoon Barks shared the Dragons and Tigers Award with fellow Chinese film Fujian Blue. In rewarding the film, the three- person jury (South Korean filmmaker Jang Sun-woo, Bangkok Post critic Kong Rithdee, and producer Colin McCabe) noted that the film was \\"witty...and well observed.\\" The film's unique score also did not go unrecognized. Xiao He's work received a nomination for Best Score at the 2nd Asian Film Awards, though it did not win. == References  External links == * * * Mid-Afternoon Barks at the Chinese Movie Database Category:2007 films Category:2007 drama films Category:Chinese films Category:Films set in Beijing Category:2007 directorial debut films ","title":"Mid-Afternoon Barks"},{"id":"20448997","text":"Frank Daniel Gerber (July 12, 1873 - October 7, 1952) was an American manufacturer of baby food.Ingham, p. 443-445 ==Early life== Gerber was born in the town of Douglas in Allegan County, Michigan in 1873.

They canned the farmers' peas, beans, and fruits. This company was the basis of the baby food industry.Ingham, p. 443 In 1901 he had helped found the Fremont Canning Company. Gerber became president of Fremont Canning Company in 1917 when his father died.Ingham, p. 443 When his father died in 1917, he succeeded him as president. This first year as president of the firm, Gerber had sales that exceeded one million dollars. Gerber expanded the facilities for year-round production in 1914-1915. Before the production was seasonal. Gerber's son Daniel joined the company in 1920. He became assistant general manager of the canning company in 1926. Gerber had a granddaughter named Sally, born in 1927, who was sickly. Her mother Dorothy, wife of Daniel, would make by hand a diet of strained fruits and vegetables for her as a pediatrician had recommended. After getting tired of this she suggested to her husband that if his company could make tomato puree perhaps they could make strained peas. Daniel then suggested to his father that they should look into making baby food.Shapiro, p. 28 Gerber experimented with test batches of strained baby food on baby Sally and other babies in the summer of 1927. Gerber also researched marketing possibilities. Gerber began selling baby food through the canning company in 1928, using the \\"Gerber Baby\\" as their logo symbol. The baby food was sold at fifteen cents each, much less than similar foods which were purchased through drug stores for forty to sixty cents. Some twelve years later the baby food line was outselling the adult canned food products. The name was changed to Gerber Products Company in 1941, and in 1943 Gerber stopped making canned foods for adults. ==Later life== Gerber died in 1952 and the firm was taken over by his son, Daniel Frank Gerber. ==Further reading== * Ingham, John N., Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders: A-G, Greenwood Press (1983); * Shapiro, Eileen C., Fad Surfing in the Boardroom: Managing in the Age of Instant Answers, Basic Books (1996), * Obituary, New York Times, October 8, 1952 ==References== Category:1873 births Category:1952 deaths Category:People from Fremont, Michigan Category:People from Allegan County, Michigan ","title":"Frank Daniel Gerber"},{"id":"20449002","text":"Mihael Frankovitsch was a 16th-century politician in Slovenia when the country was under the Holy Roman Empire.

He was born in Fremont of Newaygo County, Michigan, in 1898, the son of Frank Daniel Gerber and Pauline Dora Platt. == Mid-life == \\"Dan\\" with grandkids Gerber was educated at St. John's Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin. He attended the academy from 1913 to 1916. Gerber served in the army during World War I. He then attended the Babson College of business administration from 1919 to 1920 for a year. Later in 1920 he hired in at Fremont Canning Company that his father owned.Ingham, p. 443 In 1920 he joined the family firm. He was a successful manager and by 1926 he had become assistant general manager of the company. Gerber began urging his father to begin the production of strained baby foods at the cannery in 1927. Daniel and his wife Dorothy had an ill baby named Sally. Dorothy suggested that he persuade his father to begin making and selling at their canning company strained baby foods.Shapiro, p. 28 Gerber with his father did some extensive research on this new concept. They contacted nutritional experts, distributed many samples, and conducted market research interviews before launching their product. The idea of strained baby foods was not entirely new, but the long-held American tradition was that babies generally were given a liquid diet until they were about a year old. It was risky to introduce this new concept to the marketplace as they had no idea how mothers would react to this new idea. This enterprise became the Gerber Products Company. In 1928 their canning company started an advertising campaign in Good Housekeeping, Parents Magazine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and other magazines. Their task was to convince parents to adopt new feeding concepts. The campaign worked and into the 1930s the canning company expanded its baby food lines. == Later life == In the 1950s the company that Gerber was now running, since his father died in 1952, added three new plants. One in Asheville, North Carolina; one in Rochester, New York; and another in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Dan Gerber appeared as a contestant on the 19 May 1955 episode of the TV quiz program You Bet Your Life, hosted by Groucho Marx. Gerber expanded and diversified the company. He added a toy line in 1955 and had the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1956 for the first time. He also opened a Mexican subsidiary in 1959. In 1965 he added a large line of baby-related products. At Gerber's death in 1974, the company claimed it was the world's largest baby-food manufacturer. == Footnotes  Sources == * Ingham, John N., Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders: A-G, Greenwood Press (1983); * Shapiro, Eileen C., Fad Surfing in the Boardroom: Managing in the Age of Instant Answers, Basic Books (1996), * Obituary, New York Times, March 18, 1974 Category:1898 births Category:1974 deaths Category:People from Fremont, Michigan ","title":"Daniel Frank Gerber"},{"id":"20449014","text":"Bla≈æ Samerl was a 16th-century politician in Slovenia when the country was under the Holy Roman Empire.

His first Oberliga match was against Wismut Karl-Marx-Stadt on 20 March 1960, as a right midfielder. During his career, however, he made his home on the position of right defender. He appeared in 250 East German top flight matches (12 goals). At the beginning of the 1960s, Urbanczyk was held to be one of the best right defenders in the world, on account of his speed and his slide-tackling skills. He played for East Germany between 1961 and 1969. In a survey among managers of the magazine \\"Deutsches Sportecho\\", Urbanczyk was voted the best right defender of the 1962‚Äì63 season. At the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964, Urbanczyk's popularity rose further. He was one of the key figures of East Germany's team (representing the United Team of Germany) that reached the semi-final of the tournament. In the semi-final against the Czechoslovakia, Urbanczyk collided with his own goalkeeper J√ºrgen Heinsch and suffered a complicated knee injury, including torn cruciates.

The fear of judgment from the audience and self-image is what fuels the anxiety. Communication apprehension, CA, can cause a variety of involuntary responses such as \\"stomach butterflies\\" which is your body shutting the digestive system down and going into the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù response, shaking, nausea, sweating, forgetting the information, among many others. The term communication apprehension is usually connected with 'stage fright'; however, this response is not necessarily connected with a delivery on a stage or in front of a large audience. This anxiety can be caused by any of the four forms of communication: interpersonal, group, public, and mass communication. The most common and reliable test used to measure an individual‚Äôs CA level when exposed to these forms of communication is called the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension, also known as the PRCA-24 test, and it follows a survey format. ==Types== There are different types of communication apprehension, each of these types represent a specific or general situation that presents a stimuli for this anxiety response. McCroskey argues that there are four types of communication apprehension: === Trait anxiety === Trait anxiety is considered a personality type, which represents that the individual has an orientation to feel anxiety during the communication act regardless of the situation, audience or context. This type of people will avoid exposing themselves to a communication situation, since their communication apprehension is part of their daily behavior. McCroskey and Beatty argue that some people have a higher vulnerability factor for communication apprehension due to genetics, also known as communibiology. Many researchers oppose this idea and argue that it cannot be solely inherited but rather a personality trait acquired; therefore, it can be changed. However, they can compromise that around 80% of communication apprehension is obtained within our neurological structures, which are determined genetically. Furthermore, only 20% is influenced by an environmental stimulus. Meaning that this type of communication apprehension can be improved with practice and other techniques; however, it will not be completely eliminated since it is inherited. === Context anxiety === Context anxiety triggers communication apprehension due to a specific context. This is considered a psychological response caused by a specific context but not necessarily on others; a person can have no problem talking to her best friend but can get anxiety while talking in front of a class. The most known example for context anxiety is public speaking; almost 70% of students suffer from a certain level of communication apprehension triggered by public speaking. There are other contexts that can create a similar response such as speaking in front of class, small group discussions, or meetings. === Audience anxiety === Audience anxiety is when a specific individual or group of people creates a problem on communication, or a reverse reaction. For some people, anxiety can be caused by familiar peers, while for others it can be caused by unfamiliar faces. At the beginning of a speech class, the students tend to be fearful since they see new faces which increases the levels of communication apprehension. However, once the students get to know each other they feel comfortable; decreasing or eliminating their levels of apprehension. === Situation anxiety === Situational anxiety is a psychological reaction of a person due to a specific situation that may not have any relation with the person or context. This anxiety is triggered by a special combination of audience and context that involves different dimensions and creates a unique scenario. As an example, we can see a first date. Although a person may not suffer from communication apprehension; the situation of being with a person that they have feelings for, on a new environment, and being the first time they experience this situation, can increase the stress levels and create communication apprehension. == Treatments == Peer Practice has been proven to be effective in combatting speech anxiety. A dissertation written by a doctoral candidate studied the effect of peer practice on high school students. The study showed that peer practice was statistically significant in reducing overall CA in high school students. Students who did not utilize peer practice had higher overall levels of CA. Another study agrees with these findings and also stated that the presence of an audience is important while practicing because it provides an engaged audience for the speaker and provide constructive criticism which also helps the speaker prepare for speech day. This study also showed the benefits of tutoring while also using peer practice which is also another way the speaker can receive feedback and improve on their speech so their anxiety level will be lowered. Virtual Reality, VR, has also been a great help to those struggling with CA. Virtual Reality Therapy is a technology that enables users to enter computer-generated worlds and interact with them through sight, sound, and touch. VR may provide them with a sense of mastery or self-efficacy and, in turn, result in improved perception of performance and satisfaction with performance. The VR Practice can help with the anxiety that is caused be CA and help the speaker feel more prepared overall. Often VR is used as exposure therapy in conjunction with Cognitive Behavior Therapy, CBT, to treat public speaking anxiety. Drug Therapies and meditation have also been successful in treating CA. SSRI‚Äôs have been found to be successful treatment for speech anxiety. SSRI‚Äôs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which are used to treat depression and anxiety and that is why they are an option to treat speech anxiety. Vitamin C has also been shown to lessen the anxiety from CA. The results of a study indicated a possible role of vitamin C in decreasing the physiological signs of stress. Meditation has been found to help significantly reduce anxiety in speakers naturally. One Study found that the speakers who did not meditate had increased stress even after multiple trials they did not have a habituation-related decreased level of stress. ==PRCA== The PRCA-24 is a test created to determine the communication comfort level of a speaker. This test shows that communication apprehension is not limited to public speaking since it allows you to identify different situations that can trigger anxiety, these situations belong to an apprehension triggered by context, context anxiety. The four situations that are presented on the test are: group discussion, meetings, interpersonal, and public speaking. Currently, the PRCA-24 is the most preferred and reliable test above all others. Recently, however, there has been research done by Croucher, et al questioned the multi-national sustainability of the PRCA-24 and suggest more research to be done in different countries. Many different factors contribute to the accurateness of the results. The validity of the PRCA-24 should not be generally queried in intercultural contexts, the results should be interpreted with caution. While numerous national cultures have been studied, many are still left unexplored. However, Hsiao and Bankole, who utilized this tool in foreign countries, modifications to the PRCA-24 would make it more appropriate for non-western cultures. This test provides an easy equation to obtain a score for each category, these scores are compared to the ranges provided at the end of the test; these ranges were obtained by a study of over 40,000 college students and over 3,000 non-students adults provided on a national sample. By this comparison, the test taker can determine their level of communication apprehension for each scenario, ranking them with a low, moderate or high level of apprehension. The test is able to provide a diagnostic of context anxiety and overall communication apprehension by simply adding the sub scores and comparing the total score. == Typical Behavioral Patterns == There are three typical behavioral patterns found in people who suffer from a high level of CA. Communication avoidance can be seen when people lead their lives in a way that avoids any communication as it would bring them discomfort. For example, they will avoid jobs that involve a lot of communication or choose to live in areas where the chances of communication opportunities are lower. The second behavioral pattern comes into play when people with CA are faced with a circumstance where they were not able to use communication avoidance. In this case, the individual would use communication withdrawal, which can be utter silence or the absolute minimal communication. Examples are only speaking when spoken to or to answer questions and keeping responses short. The nonverbal messages, including standing or sitting away from others, frowning, avoiding eye contacts and standing with arms folded, can signal to others that a person is not interested in communicating and tend to reduce communication initiation attempts from others. The third behavioral pattern is communication disruption when a person with CA attempts to communicate, however, the discomfort is shown with their verbal disfluencies and poor communicative strategies. It happens when an attempt is made to take on an uncomfortable situation that involves communication. It is often shown in the form of influent and unnatural or inappropriate verbal and nonverbal behaviors, all reflecting their CA. ==Notes and references== Category:Educational psychology ","title":"Communication apprehension"},{"id":"20449325","text":"Fran√ßois Altwies (11 November 1869 ‚Äì 5 July 1936) was a Luxembourgian politician.

The condition occurs when two or more parties working towards a common goal all claim to be holding to their original schedules for delivering their part of the work, even after they know those schedules are impossible to meet. Each party hopes the other will be the first to have their failure exposed and thus take all of the blame for the larger project being delayed. This pretense continually moves forward past one project checkpoint to the next, possibly continuing right up until the functionality is actually due. The practice of schedule chicken often results in contagious schedules slips due to the inter team dependencies and is difficult to identify and resolve, as it is in the best interest of each team not to be the first bearer of bad news. The psychological drivers underlining the \\"Schedule Chicken\\" behavior are related to the Hawk-Dove or Snowdrift model of conflict used by players in game theory. The term derives from the game of chicken played between drivers, as depicted in the movie Rebel Without a Cause, in which two drivers race their hot-rods towards a cliff edge. The first driver to jump out of the car is labeled a \\"chicken,\\" while the one closest to the edge wins bragging rights. ==ReferencesFurther reading== Category:Schedule (project management) ","title":"Schedule chicken"},{"id":"20449363","text":"Gaetano Manno (born 26 July 1982 in Hagen) is a German footballer of Italian descent who plays for SpVg Hagen 11.

In 350, Constantius ordered Apodemius and Barbatio to go to Poetovio, arrest his cousin and caesar of the East Constantius Gallus and bring him to Pula, where trial awaited him. When Constantius ordered Gallus to be put to death for treason, Apodemius, Serenianus and the notarius Pentadius executed the sentence; immediately after, Apodemius grabbed Gallus' shoes, rode quickly from Pula to Mediolanum, where the imperial court was seated, entered the chamber where Constantius was having a meeting and threw the shoes at the feet of the Emperor to signify Gallus' death.Ammianus Marcellinus, xv.1.2.

First Houses were designated a New York City and National Historic Landmark in 1974. They are managed by the New York City Housing Authority. ==Description== The project consists of 122 three-room or four-room apartments in 8 four-story or five-story buildings, and is located on the south side of East 3rd Street between First Avenue and Avenue A, and on the west side of Avenue A between East 2nd and 3rd streets in Alphabet City and East Village. ==History== First Houses take their name from their distinction of being one of the first public housing units constructed in the United States, opening for the first tenants on December 3, 1935. Victorian-era tenements existed on the site before they were cleared to build the project, which was also the very first project undertaken by the city's new Housing Authority, which completed it in 1936. The project was planned as a gut rehabilitation, with one of three tenements torn down to provide extra light and air, but architect Frederick L. Ackerman and his engineers soon discovered that the 19th century tenements were too fragile to be reconstructed. So they were torn down and First Houses was built from scratch, with a small number of the original foundation supports being used.The New York Times (November 21, 1935) The project reused bricks and employed dozens of workers on relief paid for by the federal government. Ackerman designed the apartment buildings with rear entrances and courtyards to allow more light and air than existing tenements. The cobbled open areas behind the buildings provided playgrounds, trees, benches and sculptures for the tenants. A closer look at one of the buildings (2011) Although First Houses cost far more than anticipated, Housing Authority chairman Langdon Post said it was worth it. \\"In the first place ... it has taken the question of public housing out of the realm of debate and into the realm of fact. Second, it has established the Authority as an agency for the issuance of slum clearance bonds. Both Vincent Astor and Bernard M. Baruch accepted the Authority‚Äôs bonds to cover payments for the land - the first such bonds ever issued. In the third place, it provided an opportunity to test the Authority‚Äôs power to condemn land for slum clearance - a test which we won. Fourth, in Mayor La Guardia‚Äôs words, it provided us with 'Boondoggling Exhibit A.'\\" The test which the Housing Authority won was the right to exercise the powerful tool of eminent domain. The owner of two tenements on East 3rd Street contended that seizing his property, even with compensation, contravened the constitutions of the United States and New York State. The New York State Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state, ruled that the Housing Authority could seize private property: \\"Whenever there arises, in the state, a condition of affairs holding a substantial menace to the public health, safety or general welfare, it becomes the duty of the government to apply whatever power is necessary and appropriate to check it.\\" ==See also== *List of New York City Housing Authority properties *List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan below 14th Street *National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan below 14th Street ==References== Notes ==External links== *\\"In the Beginning, New York Created First Houses\\" Gray, Christopher.

Donzel at 29-43 (see Bibliography). As Abbot at the leading monastery of Debre Libanos he became the Echage, the second highest ecclesiastical office, as well as head of all Ethiopian monasteries, and was often regarded as the most influential person in the Ethiopian Church.Francisco √Ålvares at I: 262, note 2 by the editors Beckingham and Huntingford.Chris Prouty and Eugene Rosenfeld at 53.The Echage (or Etcheg√© or ƒîƒç√§gƒì) was \\"a position no other foreigner has held, before or since.\\" David Buxton at 133. ==Life and views== 'ƒönbƒÅqom was the baptismal name of the former Abu'l Fat·∏•, who circa 1489 had immigrated from Muslim Yemen into Christian Ethiopia.E. J. Van Donzel at 24-25. There was also opinion that Enbaqom originated in Iraq, Syria, or Persia. Van Donzel at 25-28. Cf., discussion of other suggested theories by Van Donzel at 162-165.Enrico Cerulli (at 17), perhaps followed by David Buxton (at 132), considered that prior to his baptism Enbaqom was also called Salik. Yet Van Donzel mentions that Salik was a translator of Enbaqom noted in a colophon of 1583, long after Enbaqom's death. Van Donzel at 30. His father was said to have been nobility, his mother Jewish.Lanfraco Ricci at 13: 102-103. He arrived as a merchant trader, in the company of a returning Ethiopian who had been held captive in Yemen. Already 'ƒönbƒÅqom was intensely involved in questioning his religious affiliation. Eventually, after much reading and discussion, he decided to convert and become a Christian. His teacher Petros, then Echage or Abbot of the leading Ethiopian monastery at Debre Libanos in Shewa, baptized him, giving him the name 'ƒönbƒÅqom, the Ethiopian form of Habakkuk; while the Hebrew name signifies \\"savant\\", the Ethiopian has the connotation of \\"professor\\".E. J. Van Donzel at 17. After further prayer and learning 'ƒönbƒÅqom circa 1500 became a monk at Debre Libanos.The site at Debre Libanos (D√§br√§ Lƒ´banos) was chosen and the monastery founded by the revered Ethiopian saint Tekle Haymanot in the 13th century. D√§br√§ Asbo was its original name. Taddesse Tamrat at 169-174.E. J. Van Donzel at 21. By his study he acquired many languages, including: Arabic, Geez, Coptic, Hebrew, Syriac, Armenian, Portuguese, and Italian. Throughout his clerical life he worked to translate into Geez, the language of the Ethiopian Church, many Christian writings, e.g., John Chrysostom's Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the story from India of Barlaam and Josaphat.Getachew Haile. For his writings he won wide respect. At the court of the Emperor Lebna Dengel, 'ƒönbƒÅqom become the friend of the Abuna Marqos, the chief ecclesiastic in Ethiopia.The Abuna then by tradition was a Coptic priest of Egypt, chosen by the Patriarch in Cairo and sent to Ethiopia as its Abuna or Metropolitan, becoming head of the Ethiopian Church. Taddesse Tamrat at 107-108. During this Emperor's reign 'ƒönbƒÅqom became the Echage, i.e., the Abbot at the Debre Libanos monastery.Van Donzel at 21-22. Lebna Dengel reigned from 1508 to 1540. While at court 'ƒönbƒÅqom also met the Portuguese priest Francisco √Ålvares.Father √Ålvares had accompanied the Ethiopian ambassador Matewos when he returned home from Lisbon in 1515. Francisco √Ålvares, the editors' (Beckingham and Huntingford's) \\"Introduction\\" at 2-3. Later this priest visited 'ƒönbƒÅqom at the monastery, teaching him Portuguese and Latin.Adrian Hastings at 145. √Ålvares reports that in 1520 he was at Dabra Libanos when the Emperor Libna Dengel installed a new Echage: > \\"He whom they made Ichee was also held to be a man of holy life, and he had > been a Moor. As he was a great friend of mine, he told me all his life and > said to me that when he was in his sect [i.e., a Muslim] he heard a > revelation, which said to him: 'You are not following the right path; go to > the Abima Marcos, who is head of the priests of Ethiopia, and he will teach > you another path'. Then he came to the Abima Marcos, and related to him what > he had heard, and the Abima Marcos had made him a Christian, and had taught > him, and considered him as a son; and therefore the [Emperor] took this monk > who had been a Moor for governor of this monastery... . This man had so much > affection for me that he used not to leave me and always went about with me. > [He] also mastered the Portuguese language, so we both understood one > another very well.\\"Francisco √Ålvares at I: 262-263 (Chapter 67). √Ålvares says that the new Echage also knew how to write Latin in good style. This, of course, sounds like 'ƒönbƒÅqom; yet √Ålvares gives his name as Jacob.The editorial notes to √Ålvares do not address the identity of \\"Jacob\\", the new Echage or Ichee (which √Ålvares translates as prior or abbot) at the Debre Libanos monastery. Francisco √Ålvares. Cf. at I: 262-263 (Chapter 67). Van Donzel, however, assures us that Enbaqom is this Jacob who √Ålvares describes in some detail.E. J. Van Donzel at 20-21. Van Donzel also states that Enbaqom was baptized not by Abuna Marqos (per √Ålvares) but by the former Echage Petros (as mentioned here above [text at note 3]). Accordingly at the death of Petros, 'ƒönbƒÅqom had become the eleventh Echage at Dabra Libanos,E. J. Van Donzel at 19, quoting from the Ethiopian Synaxaire [Lives of the Saints]; cf., E. A. Wallis Budge at III: 818. which was the second highest office in the Ethiopian Church (after the Coptic Abuna). Yet 'ƒönbƒÅqom next entered a long period of turbulence. He was accused of disloyalty to the Emperor Lebna Dengel, then tried and, in lieu of death, banished.Richard Pankhurst.Banished to Gunei, probably located south of Lake Tana. Map in Van Donzel at xx. A year later the Emperor forgave and recalled him, but he may not have return as Abbot.E. J. Van Donzel at 23.Contra: Getachew Haile, who writes that 'ƒönbƒÅqom was the Echage at Debre Lebanos for \\"close to forty years\\". Instead, he may have withdrawn further southeast to Warab by the headwaters of the river Awash. Then during the years 1526-1543 there came upon them very destructive raids led by the Muslim Ahmad Gran which destabilized the region and threatened the continued existence of Christian kingdom.J. Spencer Trimingham at 76-98 discusses these events and Ahmad Gran [Ahmad the left-handed]. Much of his early victories were due to the firearms and the soldiers supplied him by the Ottomans. In their defeat, with destruction and death about them for many years, Christians were likely to become confused and susceptible to conversion. Eventually, in 1541 a Portuguese force of 400 arquebusiers under the command of Christov√£o da Gama landed and evened up the fight, Galawdewos then being the Emperor. The Muslim threat would recede after 1542 when Ahmad Gran was killed in battle. Timingham at 77, 87-89.E. J. Van Donzel at 9-12. Van Donzel gives 1543 as the end of Gran, saying that the subsequent Christian reconquest of lost lands met with little resistance. During these decades of chaos and anarchy, 'ƒönbƒÅqom kept on the move, relocating westward to Gafat then to Bizamo, both regions located south of the Abbay River or Blue Nile.Richard Pankhurst. In 1532 the monastery at Debre Libanos had been torched, enveloped in flames due to the forces of Ahmad Gran.E. J. Van Donzel at 23. 'ƒönbƒÅqom in that year sent a letter in Arabic addressed to Ahmad Gran, writing that he should stop destroying churches and monasteries (whose libraries held the literary history of the people), and that he should stop killing priests and monks. Ahmad Gran evidently replied in effect that as a Muslim he respected the Jewish Torah and the Christian Gospels, so he would not burn churches and would limit the killing to those who resist.E. J. Van Donzel at 36. 'ƒönbƒÅqom book in Geez Anqasa Amin grew out of this letter to Ahmad Gran.Adrian Hastings at 145. Hastings dates the firing of Debre Libanos to 1540, and the letter to 1542.J. Spencer Trimingham at 90,n1 dates the book to circa 1550. Contra: Van Donzel at 38,n1. Because of his unusual background, 'ƒönbƒÅqom was better able to address Christian Ethiopians about effective ways to understand and to resist Islam. From such a partisan point of view, he was in an \\"admirable position to meet their needs, and his presence was seen as providential. While Ahmad did all he could to capture and execute him, 'ƒönbƒÅqom moved from place to place comforting the faithful.\\" The new Emperor Galawdewos returned 'ƒönbƒÅqom to favor, making him his councilor in war. Perhaps too the learned 'ƒönbƒÅqom influenced Galawdewos when he wrote his well- known \\"Confession of Faith\\" which diplomatically presents a theological and liturgical response to the Catholic Church.Adrian Hastings at 143-145, 147.Galawdewos in J. M. Harden at 104-107. The next Emperor Menas allowed the monk to become the Echage again at Debre Libanos. In a few years later 'ƒönbƒÅqom would see his last.Richard Pankhurst. Pankhurst (perhaps following Van Donzel) dates his death to 1565, when over 90 years of age. Abba 'ƒönbƒÅqom sought \\"to provide spiritual and intellectual leadership for the Ethiopian Church, and to translate works and ideas from the rest of Christendom, thus bringing a richer theology from abroad and higher standards of clerical education... .\\"Adrian Hastings at 147. The Ethiopian Church celebrates his life on the 21st of miyazya (corresponding to April 29) in the liturgical year.E. J. Van Donzel at 29. ==Anqa·π£a Amin== His book Anqasa Amin [Gateway of Faith], written in Geez, was an expansion and scholarly development of his 1532 letter in Arabic to the Muslim invader Ahmad Gran.Enbaqom near the start of his book refers to Ahmad Gran using his title of Imam. E. J. Van Donzel at 169, 171 [text]. It is perhaps the only Ethiopian Church writing with so many quotations from and references to the Qur'an ('ƒönbƒÅqom relied on his memory for many of these).Cf., E. J. Van Donzel at 60. The book is polemical, however, and was never popular. The arguments employed by Enbaqom \\"seem mostly drawn from the standard Arab Christian responses to Islam.\\" For example: Jesus in the Qur'an has greater stature than many Muslims will admit.Adrian Hastings at 145-146. 'ƒönbƒÅqom on occasion draws some interesting parallels. The Muslim Laylat al-Qadr [night of power or night of decrees] during Ramadan commemorates the first revelations of the Qur'an to Muhammad, when it is said that the angels and the Spirit will descend until dawn. For 'ƒönbƒÅqom this refers to Noel, Christmas night, when the Deity came here to earth, the night of his birth, when bands of angels filled the sky singing, \\"Glory to God in the highest and peace to his people on earth!\\"E. J. Van Donzel at 73 [commentary], 187-188 [text]. 'ƒönbƒÅqom discusses the process of his own coverstion to Christianity, which began when he heard a passage from the Qur'an discussing Jesus in the divine plan.E. J. Van Donzel at 183, 185 [text]. According to 'ƒönbƒÅqom, many Muslims then held three false beliefs about Christianity: that God had a wife and a son; that Christians worship trees, stones, and images; and that Christians admit of three Gods.E. J. Van Donzel at 90-91 [commentary], 189, 201, 227, 237 [texts]. Two original arguments made by 'ƒönbƒÅqom have been noted.Adrian Hastings at 146. First, that the Qur'an relies on only one language, Arabic, and the Judaic scriptures on Hebrew with some Aramaic. The Christian Gospels, however, communicate effectively their spiritual message in many different languages.E. J. Van Donzel at 148-151. Second, the Qur'an and the Judaic scriptures give prescriptions for war and the like. Christian scriptures do not, but are addressed to the welfare of the poor. The Anqasa Amin is an argumentative work, written in the midst of long-term and widespread chaos, destruction, and death. In it 'ƒönbƒÅqom demonstrates familiarity with Christian doctrine and prior Christian polemics, and also with Muslim religious literature.E. J. Van Donzel at 35-39, 57-59. Yet Enbaqom is not without errors, e.g., at 162 [commentary], 255 [text]. ==NotesBibliography== PRIMARY SOURCES: *E. A.

He rose to national prominence in the 1980s when Life included him in a photo spread of game champions during the height of the golden age of arcade games. In 1999, Mitchell became the first person to record a perfect score of 3,333,360 points on the arcade game Pac-Man. Twin Galaxies and Guinness World Records recognized Mitchell as the holder of several records on classic games including Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, and he has appeared in several documentaries on competitive gaming and retrogaming. A 2007 documentary, The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, follows his attempts to maintain the highest score on Donkey Kong after being challenged by newcomer Steve Wiebe. In 2018, Mitchell's high scores were challenged after members of the Twin Galaxies forums found discrepancies in the videos Mitchell had provided for The King of Kong, suggesting he may have used emulation software to falsify his score. Both Twin Galaxies and Guinness invalided all of Mitchell's records, but Mitchell successfully appealed to reverse the Guinness removals in June 2020. Twin Galaxies did not reverse their disqualifications, leading Mitchell to file defamation lawsuits against Twin Galaxies and others in 2020. In addition, Mitchell's family owns the Rickey's restaurants in Hollywood, Florida and Pembroke Pines, Florida, and he sells Rickey's World Famous Hot Sauce.Modell, Josh (February 7, 2008). \\"The King Of Kong, continued: Donkey Kong champ Billy Mitchell calls The A.V. Club out of the blue\\". The A.V. Club. ==BiographyEarly life and first records=== Mitchell was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and grew up in South Florida. He attended Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School in 1983 and soon began work as a manager in the kitchen of his parents' restaurant, Rickey's Restaurant. In grade school, Mitchell became an avid pinball player. He was initially uninterested in video games, but as they became more popular, according to Mitchell, \\"[e]veryone was standing around the Donkey Kong machine and I wanted that attention\\". He began playing video games around age 16. His interest was also spurred by a friendly rivalry with a classmate, the two trying to outscore each other on both Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. Mitchell became curious whether Donkey Kong had a recorded world-record high score, and reached out to Walter Day at Twin Galaxies, at the time a single arcade in Ottumwa, Iowa, that had started tracking such records. Day told him of a record of 1.4 million claimed by Steve Sanders. In November 1982, Life brought several notable arcade players, including Mitchell, to Ottumwa for a photoshoot. Knowing it was impossible to achieve the score Sanders had claimed, Mitchell demonstrated that the game had an impassable \\"kill screen\\" when he reached level 22, while subsequently setting a high score of 874,300 that stood for more than 18 years. Around this time, Mitchell established a friendship with Robert Childs, who had a business buying and installing arcade cabinets in places like laundromats. In 1983, Day invited Mitchell along with several other players from the photoshoot to participate in the \\"Electronic Circus\\", a 40-city tour where the players would demonstrate their skill at the arcade games at each stop. But the idea fell through and Mitchell and others spent the summer months camping out at Twin Galaxies and competing for high scores on video games, with Mitchell focusing on only a few selected titles. Later that summer, Day founded the U.S. National Video Game Team, a slimmer version of the Electronic Circus that aimed to make a stop in a major city in each US state, but the inaugural event had many snags. Day continued to bring Mitchell on various trips to confirm high scores reported by players, with Mitchell frequently calling out bluffs. By 1984, Day named Mitchell the Twin Galaxies' player of the year, but due to the 1983 video game crash, Twin Galaxies had to close down its storefront in March 1984, though it still tracked scores. After submitting a record score for BurgerTime in 1985, Mitchell moved away from video games for the next ten years, spending more time at his family's restaurant and eventually taking ownership of it. ===Pac- Man challenge=== Pac-Man was released in 1980. Players had discovered that it too had a type of kill screen: on reaching level 256, half the screen would be filled with nonsense glyphs that made it impossible to complete the level and continue. Following a 1982 claim made by an eight-year-old player of reaching more than 6 million points, which gained national coverage after President Ronald Reagan wrote to congratulate the player, Mitchell worked with his friend Chris Ayra in 1983 to determine that the highest possible score on Pac- Man was 3,333,360, which would require a perfect no-death run and collecting all possible points on the nonsense side of level 256's split-screen, requiring knowledge of where the edible dots were. In 1999, a group of Canadian players, including Rick Fothergill, were reportedly close to reaching the theoretical high score, leading Mitchell to return to video gaming to try to beat this group to the achievement. On May 8, 1999, Fothergill set the world record, just 90 points short of a perfect score. In response, on July 3, Mitchell achieved the perfect score at an arcade in Laconia, New Hampshire, and set the game's world record as recorded by Funspot and Twin Galaxies. For this, Namco, the makers of Pac-Man, brought Mitchell to Japan for the Tokyo Game Show that year to name him the \\"Video Game Player of the Century\\". After returning in November 1999, Mitchell offered $100,000 to the first person who could pass the split-screen level. The prize was not claimed by the January 1, 2000 deadline. ===Return to gaming=== Mitchell (center) with fans on December 19, 2007In 2004, Mitchell achieved a Donkey Kong high score of 933,900 in front of multiple witnesses at the Midwest Gaming Classic. Writing about Mitchell for the Oxford American in 2006, David Ramsey described Mitchell as \\"probably the greatest arcade video game player of all time\\". In 2005, newcomer Steve Wiebe attempted to surpass Mitchell's score, an event documented in the 2007 film The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. Wiebe attempted to have Mitchell present at these events to challenge him directly, typically at Funspot arcades, as public demonstrations of high scores were preferred over video tape. Mitchell had said, \\"To me, most important is to travel to a sanctioned location, like Funspot, that makes it official; if tomorrow Tiger Woods golfs a 59, big deal. If he does it at Augusta, that's where it counts.\\" Mitchell failed to appear at Wiebe's events, saying he had not played games for half a year and needed to retrain and practice for the competition. During Wiebe's attempts, he achieved a score of more than one million points on an arcade unit at his home, which was recorded on videotape and initially accepted by Twin Galaxies but later retracted, since Wiebe's unit used an unofficial \\"Double Donkey Board\\" that had circuitry for both Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. Later in his attempts, Wiebe again managed a high score that beat Mitchell's 2004 record in front of multiple witnesses at a New Hampshire Funspot, which Twin Galaxies accepted. Just hours later, Mitchell submitted his own tape to Twin Galaxies which purported to show him achieving a new high score of 1,047,200, which bested Wiebe's score and which Twin Galaxies accepted as the new official world record. Wiebe and others at the New Hampshire location complained to Twin Galaxies, and eventually Mitchell's score was nullified due to being on tape rather than witnessed, giving Wiebe the record again. After the film's release, Mitchell said he had not expected to be portrayed as a bad person, and that he had received hate mail and badgering phone calls because of the way the film was edited. In addition to the King of Kong, Mitchell appears in several other documentaries during the 2000s and 2010s, including Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade (2007), The King of Arcades (2014), and Man vs Snake: The Long and Twisted Tale of Nibbler (2015). On July 26, 2007, on the 25th anniversary of Mitchell's first record-setting performance, Mitchell again retook the Donkey Kong record with a score of 1,050,200. This score was known as the \\"Mortgage Brokers\\" score as it was made while Mitchell was attending the annual convention for the Florida Association of Mortgage Brokers. It was surpassed on February 26, 2010, by Hank Chien, who temporarily held the record. On July 24, 2010, Mitchell reclaimed the record with a score of 1,062,800 at the Boomers arcade in Dania, Florida. It was the last time he held the record after it was broken by Wiebe later that year and others since then.https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robbie-lakeman-sets-new-donkey-kong- world-record-l/1100-6478551/ Mitchell placed eighth out of eight in the Microsoft Xbox 360 Pac-Man World Championships on June 4, 2007. In 2008, he became the first video game player on a Topps Allen & Ginter trading card. In 2015, Mitchell filed a lawsuit against Cartoon Network saying that in Regular Show a character who cheats at video games called Garrett Bobby Ferguson (GBF) infringed on his likeness. United States District Court for the District of New Jersey Judge Anne Elise Thompson threw out the lawsuit, saying that \\"the television character does not match the plaintiff in appearance\\". Billy Mitchell and Pac-Man give an approving \\"thumbs up\\" at the 2014 Twin Galaxies / Walter Day trading card event at the Icon art gallery in Fairfield, Iowa ===Disputed records=== In August 2017, Jeremy Young, a moderator on the Twin Galaxies online forums, expressed concern related to a video posted online by Childs of Mitchell's Boomers score. Mitchell had played both Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong, Jr. that day, breaking records for both, but was using the same cabinet for it, with Childs having swapped the circuit board between the runs. The videos did not show the complete record-breaking runs, and Young believed there might have been issues with the board swap. Mitchell and Childs affirmed that some parts of the board-switching were staged, but that that part of the recording was made well after the records had been set on legitimate hardware. Young continued to investigate the Boomers video as well as the King of Kong and Mortgage Brokers scores, and in early 2018 posted evidence that both scores were made on MAME, arcade-emulated hardware, rather than actual hardware. Young subsequently removed the three scores from the site as the use of MAME emulation was considered invalid for high-score recording. Young's claim was backed up by Wes Copeland, a former holder of the Donkey Kong high score. Based on analysis of the scoring rate and frequencies of the game, he concluded that Mitchell's run showed a statistically unlikely rate of scoring. Further, it was determined that the Boomers and Mortgage Brokers scores were witnessed by Twin Galaxies referee Todd Rogers, who had been accused of submitting fraudulent scores for himself, putting Mitchell's scores in doubt. Mitchell defended his scores on the East Side Dave Show shortly after this charge, saying, \\"I've never even played MAME. I don‚Äôt have MAME loaded in my home.\\" Mitchell added, \\"The film footage that he has, that Jeremy has, shows MAME play... I'm not disputing what he says. What I'm disputing is the fact that I want him to have the original tape.\\" Mitchell also suggested that the tape footage Young had may have been fabricated. Young responded, \\"The amount of foresight, patience, and technical knowledge required would be staggering\\" to make such tapes. To support his case, Mitchell said he sent Twin Galaxies recordings of the gameplay from these high-score efforts along with other secondary evidence to deny any cheating. On April 12, 2018, Twin Galaxies announced that an investigation conducted into Mitchell's submitted scores found conclusive evidence that Mitchell used an emulator for the footage of his two high scores. Twin Galaxies removed all of Mitchell's scores from their records and prohibited him from submitting scores in the future. Subsequently, Guinness World Records released a statement that it would remove Mitchell's scores: \\"The Guinness World Records titles relating to Mr. Mitchell's highest scores on Donkey Kong have all been disqualified due to Twin Galaxies being our source of verification for these achievements.\\" The removal also includes Mitchell's Pac-Man high score and first recorded perfect game: \\"Twin Galaxies was the original source of verification for these record titles and in line with their decision to remove all of Mr. Mitchell's records from their system, we have disqualified Mr. Mitchell as the holder of these two records.\\" Mitchell has challenged these removals with his own evidence of the legitimacy of the high scores; At the encouragement of his son, Mitchell has used Twitch to broadcast scores that beat his past efforts. Mitchell recreated the perfect Pac-Man score at Funspot in Laconia in July 2019, and took first place at a Donkey Kong tournament in Australia the following month. The situation between Mitchell and Twin Galaxies has created tension between Mitchell and several of his friends and acquaintances in the video game community. Following requests to both Twin Galaxies and Guinness to restore his records and retract \\"defamatory statements\\" about him, Mitchell filed a lawsuit against Twin Galaxies in Los Angeles County in April 2019 for defamation, and filed another defamation lawsuit in Broward County, Florida against Twin Galaxies as well as Young and YouTuber Apollo Legend in May 2020. The Los Angeles County lawsuit against Twin Galaxies is scheduled to be heard on October 15, 2020; Twin Galaxies plans to seek dismissal of the case under California's anti-SLAPP laws. Guinness World Records announced in June 2020 that after careful review of the past video evidence and other material submitted that it could not find conclusive proof that Mitchell has used any improper methods to achieve his high scores, and restored both Mitchell's Donkey Kong and Pac-Man records. Mitchell had told Ars Technica that Guinness had made the decision back in December 2019, but due to agreements related to prior legal actions he had against Guinness prior to that point, they could not announce it until June 2020. ==Personal life== Mitchell has three children and lives with his wife in Weston, Florida. ==Notable scores== Mitchell set high-score records on several games in the 1980s and 1990s. Since his initial high score in Donkey Kong in 1982 and return to record-breaking attempts between 2004 and 2010, others have matched or surpassed Mitchell's scores. None of these records is considered valid by Twin Galaxies or the Guinness Book of Records. * Mitchell and Chris Ayra reached the split-screen level 256 of Pac-Man in mid-1983. In 1999, Mitchell claimed to be the first player to achieve a perfect score of 3,333,360 points. * He set the first acknowledged highest overall score on Donkey Kong with 886,900 points in 1982. * He set a new record score for Ms. Pac-Man of 703,560 in January 1985, which stood until it was surpassed in 2001 by Ayra. * He set a record score for Donkey Kong Jr. of 957,300 in 2004. * He set a record score for BurgerTime of 7,881,050 in 1984, which stood until 2005. * On July 8, 1985, he became the fifth person to achieve a score on Centipede of more than 10 million points in marathon play. * He recaptured the world records for both Donkey Kong (1,062,800 points) and Donkey Kong Jr. (1,270,900) on the weekend of July 24, 2010. In 2015, both these records were surpassed. The Donkey Kong record was removed by the Donkey Kong Forum in February 2018, which prompted Twin Galaxies to remove the records in April 2018 after an investigation stated Mitchell did not use an original unmodified version of the Donkey Kong arcade hardware but an emulator or other disallowed means. Evidence was presented that the score was falsified. However, Guinness World Records reversed their decision and reinstated Billy Mitchell's previous world records, based on new expert testimonials. ==Honors== On January 14, 1984, Mitchell was selected as one of the 1983 \\"Video Game Players of the Year\\" by Twin Galaxies and the U.S. National Video Game Team. On September 17, 1999, he was awarded \\"Video Game Player of the Century\\" at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show. In a ceremony on the Namco stage, company founder Masaya Nakamura presented Mitchell with an award commemorating the first \\"perfect\\" game on Pac-Man. On June 21, 2006, MTV selected Mitchell as one of \\"The 10 Most Influential Video Gamers of All Time\\". He was also nominated as leader of the Nerd Herd. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Details of Jeremy Young's analysis of Mitchell's gameplay tapes ==External links== * * Category:1965 births Category:2018 controversies in the United States Category:American chief executives of food industry companies Category:American esports players Category:Donkey Kong players Category:Living people Category:People from Hollywood, Florida Category:People from Springfield, Massachusetts Category:Video game controversies ","title":"Billy Mitchell (gamer)"},{"id":"20449625","text":"Colonel David de Crespigny Smiley, (11 April 1916 ‚Äì 9 January 2009) was a British special forces and intelligence officer. He fought in the Second World War in Palestine, Iraq, Persia, Syria, Western Desert and with Special Operations Executive (SOE) in Albania and Thailand. == Background == Smiley was the 4th and youngest son of Sir John Smiley, 2nd Baronet and Valerie Champion de Crespigny, youngest daughter of Sir Claude Champion de Crespigny, who was a noted jockey, balloonist, sportsman and adventurer. His father fought in the Second Boer War between 1899 and 1900 with 4th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders before joining the North of Ireland Imperial Yeomanry (redesignated the North Irish Horse in 1908). He gained the rank of Major in the service of the Carabiniers (6th Dragoon Guards) and fought in the First World War. David Smiley was educated at the Nautical College, Pangbourne, Berkshire, England, where he was a noted sportsman. Some have suggested that John le Carr√© consciously or unconsciously took David Smiley's surname for that of his hero George Smiley. == Military service == Smiley attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1934, and was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards in 1936. While based in Windsor, Berkshire, with the Blues, he was seen as a \\"man-about-town\\", owning a Bentley car and a Miles Whitney Straight aircraft. He was also an amateur jockey and won seven races under National Hunt rules. After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Smiley's regiment sailed for Palestine, where one of his first jobs was to shoot his troop of forty horses when it became clear they were of no use in modern combat. In 1940 Smiley joined the Somaliland Camel Corps, but was to arrive at Berbera the same day it was decided to evacuate British Somaliland. He returned frustrated to Egypt where he persuaded family friend General Wavell to recommend him for the newly formed commandos. Smiley was appointed a company commander (with the rank of captain) with 52 Commando and his first mission was sneaking from Sudan into Abyssinia. He fought against Vichy French forces in Syria. For his reconnaissance work in ruins near Palmyra he was mentioned in despatches (Middle-East, 1941). Smiley was recruited by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) 1943 and undertook his first operation with them in Palestine in the same year. Later 1943 he parachuted into Albania where he co-ordinated partisan operations for eight months, and was awarded an immediate Military Cross. In April 1944 Smiley and Lieutenant Colonel Neil \\" Billy\\" McLean again parachuted into Albania,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRIL4fHo2DQ carrying out guerrilla operations, for which Smiley was awarded a Bar to the Military Cross in 1944. He was invested as an Officer, Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.) in 1946 (SOE, Thailand). He was Colonel of the Royal Horse Guards between December 1951 to December 1954. He rode behind The Queen in the Gold State Coach in the Coronation Procession on 2 June 1953.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b5nrCPIw5g Royal Channel YouTube The coronation of Queen Elizabeth David Smiley, the Royal Horse Guards and Colonel William H.

He was British Military Attach√© to Stockholm between 1955 and 1958. After the war, he held the record for the most falls in one season on the Cresta Run in St Moritz; bizarrely, he represented Kenya (where he owned a farm) in the Commonwealth Winter Games of 1960. He was Commander of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's Armed Forces between 1958 and 1961.http://muscatconfidential.blogspot.com/2009/01/colonel-smiley-ex- commander-of-omans.html He was Military Advisor to Yemen between 1962 and 1967. == Later work == Smiley was the author of three books based on his experiences, Arabian Assignment,Published L Cooper 24 April 1975 http://www.capricornbooks.ca/ap_david_kemp_peter_smiley_with.html Albanian AssignmentPublished Chatto & Windus 29 Oct 1984 and Irregular Regular.Published Michael Russell Publishing 31 Jan 1994 Smiley died on 9 January 2009, survived by his wife, Moyra (daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Lord Francis George Montagu Douglas Scott, KCMG, DSO, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch's youngest son; and Lady Eileen Nina Evelyn Sibell Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound - married 28 April 1947) two sons, Xan de Crespigny Smiley (born 1 May 1949) and Philip David Smiley (born 26 Aug 1951),Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, 107th edition, volume 3, page 3657 a stepson and a stepdaughter. == Awards and decorations == *Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order *Mentioned in Despatches 1941 - for operations in the Middle-East *Military Cross 1943 - SOE operations in Albania *Bar to the Military Cross - 1944 *French Croix de Guerre 1945 - Indochina *Officer, Order of the British Empire 1946 - SOE operations in Thailand *He was admitted to Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms in 1966. *Knight Commander, Order of the Sword of Sweden *Grand Cordon, Order of Skanderbeg of Albania *Order of Freedom of Albania (1st Class) ==Gallery== Service of Major David Smiley With the Special Operations Executive (soe) in Albania, 1943 - 1944.

Schubert, President‚Äù Shortly after the above official statement was made to the government, approximately 2 percent of Seventh-day Adventist members in more than 14 European countries were disfellowshipped from the church for their open opposition to war and their support of pacifism. In some countries, entire congregations and their elders, within just one week, found themselves deprived of church membership because of their stand on the war question and the Sabbath. After the war, while hoping for reconciliation with their former brethren, they found it necessary to organize in order to legally hold their collective resources and support their ministers and workers. Since many had been members of the International Missionary and Tract Society of the Seventh- day Adventist Church, they originally organized in 1919 in Germany as \\"Internationale Missionnsgesellshaft der Siebententags Adventisten Alte seit 1844 stehengebliebene Richtung Deutsche Union\\" (International Missionary Society of Seventh-day Adventists, old movement standing firm since 1844). When all efforts failed in both 1920 and 1922 to obtain an open and impartial hearing before the Seventh-day Adventist Church representatives on issues related to non-participation in war, and when they discovered that a reform movement within the church had been prophesied, the latter part of the original name was changed to Reform Movement. Thus the name: International Missionary Society, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Reform Movement. In July 1925, brief basic Principles of Faith were formally compiled by representatives from around the world during a Reform Movement General Conference meeting in Gotha, Germany. With new enthusiasm, the International Missionary Society spread rapidly into many countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Then, in April 1936, the German government closed down and confiscated all property belonging to the organization, and their members subsequently suffered persecution, imprisonment, exile, loss of property, and even death. Many leaders and young men of the International Missionary Society died as martyrs in concentration camps, some having been denounced and even betrayed by members and leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. After World War II, the International Missionary Society again grew rapidly around the world. But during General Conference delegates‚Äô meetings held in the Netherlands, on May 21, 1951, the acting Secretary of the General Conference, Dimitru Nicolici, from Romania, objected to certain procedures of the meetings and walked out with 10 other delegates and an interpreter. Within a few days, this group had set up their own separate organization with Nicolici as president and retained the name that he had registered in the U.S. in 1949 with approval by the General Conference; it had eliminated the International Missionary Society part of the name. Testimony written in 1952 by eyewitnesses to this incident and official minutes of the 1951 delegates' meetings from both organizations are on record. Attempts to reintegrate with that movement failed in 1952, 1968, and 1993. There are now two distinct branches of the Reform Movement as a result of the 1951 split. One uses the name \\"Seventh-Day Adventist Reform Movement\\" (sometimes referred to as the Nicolici group, or '51 movement), whereas the other uses the name \\"International Missionary Society, Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Reform Movement.\\" Both have entirely different organizations, personnel, and websites. The General Conference website of the former is www.sdarm.org (headquartered in Roanoke, VA), while the General Conference website of the latter can be found at www.sda1844.org (headquartered in Cedartown, GA). The organizational structure of the International Missionary Society follows the original pattern of the Seventh- day Adventist Church. There are churches, mission fields, districts, fields, unions, and the General Conference. The highest governing body of the denomination, the General Conference Assembly, is composed of delegates from around the globe, meets in full session once every 5 years to elect a 13-member governing Board, to study doctrinal issues, and to establish missionary priorities. The most recent such Assembly was held in 2017 in Tortoreto, Italy. The International Missionary Society is represented in more than 100 countries. Its adherents worship on the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) and believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. The organization holds the Bible to be inerrant and acknowledges the writings of Ellen G. White to be part of the Spirit of prophecy (inspired writings) for the last days. Points of difference with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, besides conscientious objection to war, include the view that abortion and homosexuality violate God‚Äôs will, a refusal to participate in political activity, the upholding of the marriage institution as sacred before God, a refusal to participate in ecumenism and labor unions, and advocacy of health principles, such as vegetarianism and natural healing, while abstaining from harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. They do not divide into different churches on the basis of language, ethnic, or racial differences. They have a strong family, education, health, and missions emphasis in their projects, funding, and resource allocation. The international headquarters facility in Cedartown, Georgia, U.S.A., was purchased in 2007 and is staffed by ministers, doctors, teachers, and missionaries from a broad base of countries. Membership: The International Missionary Society, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Reform Movement numbers approximately 35,000 members worldwide with more than 73,000 congregants attending church services on the weekly Sabbath day. Periodicals: The Sabbath Watchman is the official publication of the International Missionary Society, Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Reform Movement, General Conference. Beliefs The Church attaches much importance to their name, historical roots, and Adventist doctrines. ==References * General Conference - International Missionary Society * American Union - International Missionary Society - American Union * Canadian Field - International Missionary Society Seventh-day Adventist Reform movement, Canadian Field  IMSSDARM, Adventist Library - IMS Media Online Library and Adventist Bookstore, The Reformation Messenger * Japan Church - IMS „Çª„Éñ„É≥„Çπ„Éá„Éº„Éª„Ç¢„Éâ„Éô„É≥„ÉÅ„Çπ„ÉàÊïô‰ºö Category:Charismatic Adventism ","title":"International Missionary Society"},{"id":"20449658","text":"is a music video game created by Masaya Matsuura as a spinoffMojib Ribbon.

They emerged as a problem-solving court in the 1980s and 1990s in response to frustration among victim advocates, judges and attorneys who saw the same litigants cycling through the justice system again and again. ==Background on domestic violence== The FBI estimates that a domestic violence crime is committed at a rate of once every fifteen seconds.N.Y. STATE OFFICE FOR THE PREVENTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA SHEET (2001). According to conservative estimates, one million women are battered by an intimate partner annually.Judith S. Kaye and Susan K. Knipps, Judicial Responses to Domestic Violence: The Case for a Problem Solving Approach, 27 W. ST. U.L. REV. 3 (1999-2000). These numbers and the efforts of domestic violence advocates have led, over the last 20 years, to changes in the criminal justice response to such offenses. Some of the greatest changes occurred in the 1990s, with the passage of the federal Violence Against Women Act. This increased attention to domestic violence resulted in, among other things, the passage of mandatory arrest laws, an increase in funding for services for victims, and the creation of special domestic violence prosecution and police units. At the same time, there was a parallel movement taking place within state court systems as judges and attorneys began to search for new tools, strategies, and new technologies that could help them address difficult cases where social, human, and legal problems collide.For more on how courts have responded to domestic violence, see New York‚Äôs chief judge, Judith S. Kaye, articulated, with co-author Judge Susan Knipps, the thinking behind the development of domestic violence courts in an essay published in Western State University Law Review: ‚ÄúOne possible judicial response to the current situation is to continue to process domestic violence cases as any other kind of case, and to continue to observe systemic failures. Another response, however‚Äîthe problem solving response‚Äîis to try to design court programs that explicitly take into account the special characteristics that domestic violence cases present. If domestic violence defendants present a particular risk of future violence, then why not enhance monitoring efforts to deter such actions? If victims remain in abusive situations due to fear for their own and their children‚Äôs well being, then why not provide links to services and safety planning that may expand the choices available to them? If cases are slipping between the cracks of a fragmented criminal justice system, then why not work together to improve coordination and consistency?‚Äù Judith S. Kaye and Susan K. Knipps, Judicial Responses to Domestic Violence: The Case for a Problem Solving Approach, 27 W. ST. U.L. REV. 3 (1999-2000). Today, there are nearly 300 courts nationwide that have special processing mechanisms for domestic violence cases. Three sites were the subject of a study by the Vera Institute of Justice: Milwaukee County, Wisconsin; Washtenaw County, Michigan; and Dorchester District in Boston, Massachusetts. Starting in 1999, judges and attorneys, advocates for women and batterer intervention specialists, probation officers, police, and others in those jurisdictions banded together in an ambitious effort to improve criminal justice and community responses to domestic violence. The three sites were selected to participate in the Judicial Oversight Demonstration Initiative‚Äîa national demonstration project funded by the [www.usdoj.gov/ U.S. Department of Justice]‚Äôs Office on Violence Against Women‚Äîhave spent the past five years working to enhance victim safety and the oversight of offenders in their communities. The Center for Court Innovation is funded by the Office on Violence Against Women to provide technical assistance to courts interested in developing or enhancing their domestic violence programs. The Center for Court Innovation also has a grant from the National Institute of Justice to document the number and types of domestic violence courts in the United States. ==Benefits of domestic violence courts== Justice system practitioners, victim advocates, and researchersSee Fritzler, R.B., and Simon, L.M.J.

(2000). ‚ÄúApplying the Law Therapeutically in Domestic Violence Cases.‚Äù University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City Law Review, 69, 1‚Äì63. have cited the following major benefits of domestic violence courts: * Enhanced coordination of cases and consistent orders in different cases involving the same parties. * More comprehensive relief for victims at an earlier stage of the judicial process. * Advocacy services that encourage victims to establish abuse-free lives. * Greater understanding by judges of how domestic violence affects victims and their children. * More consistent procedures, treatment of litigants, rulings, and orders. * Greater availability of mechanisms to hold batterers accountable for the abuse. * Improved batterer compliance with orders. * Greater confidence on the part of the community that the justice system is responding effectively to domestic violence. * Greater system accountability. ==Concerns about domestic violence courts== Susan Keilitz notes a number of concerns about domestic violence courts. The need for judges to specialize, for instance, may lead to a loss of neutrality among judges or ‚Äúthe assignment of judges who are not motivated to acquire the knowledge and skills required to be effective in these cases, or to loss of judicial effectiveness from the stress of fast-paced decisionmaking in difficult and emotionally charged cases every day.‚Äù Another concern is that greater efficiency in prosecution may lead to ‚Äúassembly-line justice that ignores the special needs of victims,‚Äù Keilitz wrote. ==Domestic violence courts in New York== In New York, the typical domestic violence court features a single presiding judge, a fixed prosecutorial team, and enhanced staffing to monitor defendant compliance and provide assistance to victims. In order to ensure compliance with court orders, New York‚Äôs first domestic violence court, the Brooklyn Felony Domestic Violence Court, launched in 1996, instituted a procedure that required parolees to come back to the court for a formal review of the terms of their order of protection. There are now over 35 domestic violence courts in New York, including courts in the Bronx, Queens and Westchester Counties, the city of Buffalo, and smaller cities like Clarkstown and Binghamton. An impact evaluation of 24 New York domestic violence courts found reduced re-arrests among convicted offenders. New York State has also created integrated domestic violence courts where a single judge handles criminal domestic violence cases and related family issues, such as custody, visitation, civil protection orders and matrimonial actions. In addition, the New York court system has three Youthful Offender Domestic Violence Courts that work with teenage defendants. ==Sources== * ==References *Office on Violence Against Women, a unit of the U.S. Department of Justice that seeks to raise awareness and support training and services responding to incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. *Center for Court Innovation, a nonprofit think tank that develops problem-solving courts, including domestic violence courts. *The Family Violence Prevention Fund, which works to prevent violence within the home and in the community. *The National Network to End Domestic Violence, a social change organization dedicated to creating a social, political, and economic environmental in which violence against women no longer exists. *Safe Horizon, a nonprofit organization that provides support, prevents violence, and promotes justice for victims of crime and abuse, their families and communities. *Sanctuary for Families, the largest nonprofit in New York State dedicated exclusively to serving domestic violence victims and their children. *Vera Institute of Justice, an independent center for policy and practice, making justice systems fairer and more effective through research and innovation.

Between 1986 and 1996, it also served Line 8. The station is located below the intersections of Avenida de Am√©rica and Francisco Silvela and Pr√≠ncipe de Vergara streets. The station consists of several underground levels, with the bus terminal located in the upper three and the Metro station located in the lower four. It serves the neighborhood of Prosperidad and El Viso in Chamart√≠n district and La Guindalera in Salamanca district. It is about 15 minutes from Madrid Barajas Airport and 10 minutes from the city centre of Madrid. == History  Madrid Metro station === The station was inaugurated on 26 March 1973 when Line 4 was extended from Diego de Le√≥n to Alfonso XIII. The metro station was built from the start to service four Metro lines, and each platform was opened to the public when the corresponding line went into service. The Line 4 platforms are the shallowest in the Metro station, located at the fourth level below the street and aligned with Francisco Silvela street. On 17 March 1975, Line 7 was extended to Avenida de Am√©rica. The Line 7 platforms are the second shallowest in the Metro station, and are arranged in a Spanish solution layout with one central platform and two side platforms. Four years later, on 10 October 1979, the Line 6 platforms entered service when the first stretch of Line 6 was inaugurated between Pac√≠fico and Cuatro Caminos. Like the Line 7 platforms, it features a central platform and side platforms. Another four years later, on 30 December 1983, a segment of Line 9 known as Line 9B was built, connecting Avenida de Am√©rica to Plaza de Castilla. This segment was not connected to the rest of Line 9 until 24 February 1986, when the stretch from Avenida de Am√©rica to Sainz de Baranda was built. The Line 9 platforms are the deepest in the station. On 23 December 1986, service on the old Line 8 began between Avenida de Am√©rica and Nuevos Ministerios using the existing Line 7 tunnel, so that each line used one track. When Line 8 and Line 10 were merged in 1996, Line 8 service ended at Avenida de Am√©rica, and in 1998 Line 7 resumed the use of both tracks. In recent years, the Line 6 and Line 4 platforms have undergone renovations. The Line 7 platforms were temporarily closed during September 2006 in order to replace the catenaries. === Bus terminal === Exterior of the Avenida de Am√©rica bus terminal At the end of the 1990s, a three-level underground bus station was built above the metro station in the area previously used the Metro station vestibule. The station, which was the second underground bus station to be built in Madrid, was completed in 2000. It services city buses as well as interurban and long-distance coaches, and it houses stores and a parking garage. Between 2009 and 2014, the second level of the bus station underwent renovations. ==Station layout== {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=50 valign=top0 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100 valign=topStreet level style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=400 valign=topExits/entrances - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"-1 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Upper mezzanine style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Bus terminal gates 20‚Äì36 (long distance buses) - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"-2 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Center mezzanine style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Bus terminal gates 1‚Äì19 (urban/suburban buses) - style=\\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\\"-3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Metro mezzanine style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"One-way fare gates, ticket machines, station agent Transfer between platforms - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=4 valign=top-4 Line 4 platforms style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\\" colspan=2 - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Eastbound style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=400‚Üí to Pinar de Chamart√≠n ‚Üí - Westbound ‚Üê to Arg√ºelles - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2 - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\" rowspan=5 -5 Line 7 platforms style=\\"border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the left - Eastbound ‚Üí to Estadio Metropolitano ‚Üí - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform, doors will open on the right for alighting passengers only - Westbound ‚Üê to Pitis - style=\\"border- top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the left - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\\" rowspan=5 -6 Line 6 platforms style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the left - Track 2 ‚Üí clockwise ‚Üí - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform, doors will open on the right for alighting passengers only - Track 1 ‚Üê counterclockwise - style=\\"border- top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the left - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=4 valign=top-7 Line 9 platforms style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\\" colspan=2 - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Southbound style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=400‚Üí to Puerta de Arganda ‚Üí - Northbound ‚Üê to Paco de Luc√≠a - style=\\"border- top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2 } ==References== Category:Madrid Metro stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Spain Category:Bus stations in Spain ","title":"Avenida de Am√©rica (Madrid Metro)"},{"id":"20450134","text":"John \\"Rudy\\" Bell (January 1, 1881 ‚Äì July 28, 1955), born Rudolph Fred Baerwald, was a Major League Baseball outfielder.

Also, she was a patron of Fontevraud Abbey. Ermengarde was the regent of Brittany during the absence of her spouse from 1096 until 1101. ==LifeEarly years=== Born in Angers she was the eldest child of Count Fulk IV of Anjou but the only one born by his first wife, Hildegarde of Beaugency. Having lost her mother in 1070, at only two years of age, she received a good education and grew to be pious and concerned about religious reform, especially the struggle against the secular appropriation of church property. She was also noted for her beauty in her youth. ===Duchess of Aquitaine=== It has long been presumed that, in 1089, her marriage was arranged to the young Duke and poet, William IX of Aquitaine. However, this union proved a dismal failure. Her husband was a voracious philanderer, whose affairs infuriated his wife. She suffered from severe mood swings, vacillating between vivacity and sullenness, and would nag her husband. She also had a habit of retiring in bad temper to a cloister after an argument, cutting off all contact with the outside world, before suddenly making a reappearance in the court as if her absence had never occurred. Such behavior, coupled with her failure to conceive a child, led William to send her back to her father and have the marriage dissolved in 1091. Her behavior during her marriage to the Duke has been described by both Marion Meade and Alison Weir as schizophrenic, with Weir adding a suggestion of manic depression. However, Ruth Harvey's 1993 critical investigationHarvey, Ruth. \\"The wives of the ‚Äòfirst troubadour‚Äô, Duke William IX of Aquitaine\\". Journal of Medieval History, Volume 19, Issue 4, 1993,pp. 307-325 shows the assumption of William's marriage to Ermengarde to be based largely on an error in a nineteenth-century secondary source and it is highly likely that Philippa of Toulouse was William's only wife. Further research Wolterbeek, Marc. ‚ÄúInventing History, Inventing Her Story: The Case of William of Aquitaine‚Äôs Marital Affairs.‚Äù Medieval Association of the Pacific, University of California, Berkeley, March 1995, and International Medieval Congress, Leeds, England, July 1995 has found the claim that William was married to \\"Hermingerda\\", daughter of Fulk IV of Anjou is based on the very unreliable chronicle of William of Tyre, written between 1169 and 1187, more than 70 years after the events in question would have taken place. Tyre erroneously identifies Ermengarde's mother as Bertrand of Montfort, the sister of Amalricus de Montfort when her mother was in fact Audearde or Hildegarde of Beaugency. Tyre's chronicle lacks any contemporary corroboration, no primary text ever mentions a marriage between William and Ermengarde. It is therefore not only improbable that William married Ermengarde of Anjou, it is likely that he was never married to a woman named Ermengarde at all. But Stephen Philp, poet and mediaeval historian, has counter-argued that Tyre's apparent error in the name names is not in itself proof a marriage between William and a woman named Ermengarde never took place, especially as several sources give colourful accounts of the marriage and its aftermath.J. A. Everard, Brittany and the Angevins: Province and Empire 1158‚Äì1203, (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 10. ===Duchess and regent of Brittany=== In 1093, her father married her to Duke Alan IV of Brittany, probably to secure an alliance against Normandy, then controlled by William the Conqueror‚Äôs son, Robert Curthose. The union produced three children: the future Duke Conan III, Hawise (wife of Count Baldwin VII of Flanders, who repudiated her in 1110) and Geoffrey (who died young in Jerusalem in 1116). Her husband left for Palestine in 1096 to take part in the First Crusade and she served as Regent of the Duchy from then until 1101. She spent little time in Rennes or the west of Brittany, preferring Nantes and the Saumur region. Influenced by Robert of Arbrissel, she approved the expansion of the abbey at Fontevraud, to which she withdrew on two occasions. An admirer of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (to whose abbey she made donations), she favored the creation of Cistercian abbeys. She was also a benefactor of the monastery of Buzay, near Nantes. Alan IV, an unpopular ruler, was forced to abdicated in favor of his son in 1112, and he and Ermengarde were separated after this. ===Later years=== By 1116 Ermengarde was living in Fontevrault Abbey, where she reputedly became a friend of her first husband's second wife, Philippa of Toulouse. In 1118 after the death of Philippa, Ermengarde decided to avenge her deceased friend. She went south from Fontevrault to the court of her former husband, Duke William of Aquitaine, where she demanded to be recognized as the rightful Duchess. William ignored this remarkable request. Accordingly, in October 1119, she suddenly appeared at the Council of Reims, being held by Pope Calixtus II, demanding that the Pope excommunicate William, oust his mistress from the ducal palace, and restore Ermengarde to her rightful place as the Duchess of Aquitaine. The Pope \\"declined to accommodate her\\"; however, Ermengarde continued to trouble William for several years afterwards. ===Death=== Ermengarde at one point went on Crusade to Palestine; she returned ten years later, and some historians believe her life ended in Jerusalem at the convent of Saint Anne. But obituary lists at Redon Abbey record a date of death in 1146 in Redon where her second husband, Alan IV was buried. It is believed that she died a nun. The contradictions about her death and the records of her burial maybe indicated that in fact she died in Jerusalem, and that her body was subsequently transferred to Redon. ==References Further reading == * * Category:1060s births Category:1146 deaths Category:Duchesses of Aquitaine Category:Duchesses of Brittany Category:11th-century women rulers Category:12th-century women rulers Category:12th-century Breton people Category:12th-century French women Category:11th-century French people Category:11th-century French women Category:Regents of Brittany ","title":"Ermengarde of Anjou (d. 1146)"},{"id":"20450308","text":"\\"The One You Love\\" is a song written and performed by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright.

The attack took place within the Maritime Security Patrol Area and was attributed to six pirates armed with AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades in a high-speed skiff. The ship was the 97th to be hijacked off the coast of Somalia in 2008. In addition to the three security guards who escaped by jumping into the sea, 25 Indian and two Bangladeshi were members of the crew. The two British and one Irish guard, were employed by British-based security company Anti Piracy Maritime Security Solutions (APMSS), of Poole, Dorset. All three were military-trained, two being former marines and one a former paratrooper, and were \\"... on board the vessel to provide logistical support and non-lethal defensive counter-measures.\\" according to Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of the East African Seafarers Assistance Program. Unarmed, the security guards attempted to repel the attackers for about 40 minutes by firing water cannon, zigzagging the skiff, and using a LRAD, a non-lethal weapon that fires focused sound beams producing excruciating pain. A distress signal was received at 0447 hours UTC by the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Centre, in Kuala Lumpur. After the pirates boarded the ship and continued to shoot at the security force, the guards managed to escape by jumping overboard. They were rescued from the sea by a German navy helicopter, and taken first to the French light monitoring frigate Niv√¥se before being transferred to the Jean de Vienne, a F70 type anti-submarine frigate of the French Marine Nationale. The incident caused the usefulness of LRADs to be called into question by Lloyd's List.David Osler, Sonic solution may not be a sound investment, Lloyd's List, December 2, 2008.

A mass effect is the effect of a mass on its surroundings, for example, exerting pressure on the surrounding brain matter. Edema is the build-up of fluid within the brain tissue. Usually, the ring enhancement is directed toward the cortical surface.Kaeser, M. A., Scali, F., Lanzisera, F. P., Bub, G. A., and Kettner, N. W. Tumefactive multiple sclerosis: an uncommon diagnostic challenge. Journal of Chiropractic Medicine 10:29-35 (2011). The tumefactive lesion may mimic a malignant glioma or cerebral abscess causing complications during the diagnosis of tumefactive MS. T2-hypointense rim and incomplete ring enhancement of the lesions on post-gadolinium T1- weighted imaging on brain MRI enable accurate diagnosis of TDL Normally a tumefactive demyelinating lesion appears together with smaller disseminated lesions separated in time and space, yielding a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Hence the name \\"tumefactive multiple sclerosis\\". When the demyelinating lesion appears alone it has been termed solitary sclerosis. These cases belong to a multiple sclerosis borderline and there is currently no universal agreement on how they should be considered. Tumefactive multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease. Myelination of the axons are highly important for signalling as this improves the speed of conduction of action potentials from one axon to the next. This is done through the formation of high-resistance, low-conductance myelin sheaths around the axons by specific cells called oligodendrocytes. As such, the demyelination process affects the communication between neurons and this consequently affects the neural pathways they control. Depending on where the demyelination takes place and its severity, patients with tumefactive MS have different clinical symptoms. == Signs and symptoms == Symptoms of standard MS consist of both sensory and motor symptoms. The more common symptoms include spasticity, visual loss, difficulty in walking and paresthesia which is a feeling of tickling or numbness of the skin.Rudick, R. A. Contemporary Diagnosis and Management of Multiple Sclerosis. Pennsylvania: Handbooks in Health Care Co., 2004. Print. but symptoms of tumefactive MS are not so clear. They often mimic a variety of other diseases including ischemic stroke, peroneal nerve palsy and intracranial neurologic disease. Subjects have been reported to suffer from a decreased motor control resulting in a ‚Äòfoot drop‚Äô, or significantly reduced leg movement. In other cases closer mimicking strokes, subjects may suffer from confusion, dizziness, and weakness in one side of the face. Symptoms also can mimic a neoplasm with symptoms such as headaches, aphasia, and/ or seizures.[13] There are some differences with normal MS symptoms. Spasticity is not as prevalent in tumefactive cases, because in standard MS it is caused by demyelination or inflammation in the motor areas of the brain or the spinal cord. This upper motor neuron syndrome appears when motor control of skeletal muscles is affected due to damage to the efferent motor pathways. Spasticity is an involuntary muscle movement like an exaggerated stretch reflex, which is when a muscle overcompensates and contracts too much in response to the muscle being stretched. It is believed that spasticity is the result of the lack of inhibitory control on the muscles, an effect of neuronal damage.Purves, D., Augustine, G. J., Fitzpatrick, D., Hall, W. C., LaMantia, A. S., and White, L. E. Neuroscience. Sunderland: Sinauer Associates Inc., U.S., 2010. Print. Visual loss or disturbances are also different. In standard MS, they are a result of inflammation of the optic nerve, known as optic neuritis. The effects of optic neuritis can be loss of color perception and worsening vision. Vision loss usually starts off centrally in one eye and may lead to complete loss of vision after a period of time. The possible cognitive dysfunction is also rare in tumefactive cases. MS patients may show signs of cognitive impairment where there is a reduction in the speed of information processing, a weaker short-term memory and a difficulty in learning new concepts. This cognitive impairment is associated with the loss of brain tissue, known as brain atrophy which is a result of the demyelination process in MS. About fatigue: most MS patients experience fatigue and this could be a direct result of the disease, depression or sleep disturbances due to MS. It is not clearly understood how MS results in physical fatigue but it is known that the repetitive usage of the same neural pathways results in nerve fiber fatigue that could cause neurological symptoms. Such repeated usage of neural pathways include continuous reading which may result in temporary vision failure. ===Evolution=== Some reports indicate that an initial tumefactive lesion can evolve to various pathological entities: multiple sclerosis (the most common), Balo's concentric sclerosis, Schilder's disease and acute disseminated encephalomyelitisBalloy G et al. Inaugural tumor-like multiple sclerosis: clinical presentation and medium-term outcome in 87 patients. J Neurol. 2018 Jul 27. doi: 10.1007/s00415-018-8984-7 ===Course=== Usually tumefactive demyelination is monophasic, but cases with recurrence have been reportedJamir Pitton Rissardo,Ana Let√≠cia Fornari Caprara, Management of Recurrent Tumefactive Multiple Sclerosis: Case Report and Literature Review, Asian J Neurosurg. 2018 Jul-Sep; 13(3): 893‚Äì896. doi: 10.4103/ajns.AJNS_94_18 == Cause == The pathology of the tumefactive demyelinating lesion (TDL) is heterogeneous. There are several conditions can produce tumefactive lesions. This is known because in some special cases the etiology can be identified. For example, there are some cases of NMO, misidentified as MS and treated with interferon-beta by mistake. Some of these patients developed tumefactive lesions. Anyway, it is important to have into account that NMO itself can also produce them Some other cases have been found related to viral infection, some others related to NMOSD, others could be paraneoplastic, Also some cases could be related to hormonal treatments Other possible cause are immunomodulatory combinations. In particular, it has been found that switching from standard MS therapies to fingolimod can trigger tumefactive lesions in some MS patients While standard multiple sclerosis process has an autoimmune response after the breach of the blood-brain barrier, in tumefactive MS things do not process in the same way, and demyelinating lesions do not always show antibody damage. Subjects with tumefactive multiple sclerosis display elevated levels of choline (Cho)/creatine ratio and increased lactate which is associated with demylinating diseases. Cases also display oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. The disease is heterogeneous and the lesions do not always comply with the requirements for multiple sclerosis diagnosis (dissemination in time and space). In these cases it is only possible to speak about tumefactive demyelination (TD). In general, it is accepted that the two main causes of pseudo-tumoral lesions are Marburg multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Tumefactive demyelination of the spinal cord is rare but it has been reported Damage is not confined to the demyelinating area. Wallerian degeneration outside the lesions has been reported. In general, during the acute phase, the plaques of lesions were characterized by massive demyelination with relatively axonal preservation associated with reactive astrocytosis and infiltration of macrophages. In plaques of chronic lesions, demyelinated lesions with relative axonal preservation and sharply defined margins were major findings. And myelin-laden macrophages accumulate at the edges of plaques and stay inactive == Diagnosis == Diagnosis of tumefactive MS is commonly carried out using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton MR spectroscopy (H-MRS). Diagnosis is difficult as tumefactive MS may mimic the clinical and MRI characteristics of a glioma or a cerebral abscess. However, as compared to tumors and abscesses, tumefactive lesions have an open-ring enhancement as opposed to a complete ring enhancement. Even with this information, multiple imaging technologies have to be used together with biochemical tests for accurate diagnosis of tumefactive MS. Tumefactive demyelination is distinguished from tumor by the presence of multiple lesions, absence of cortical involvement, and decrease in lesion size or detection of new lesions on serial imaging Tumefactive lesions can appear in the spinal cord, making the diagnosis even more difficult. === Magnetic resonance imaging === MRI diagnosis is based on lesions that are disseminated in time and space, meaning that there are multiple episodes and consisting of more than one area. There are two kinds of MRI used in the diagnosis of tumefactive MS, T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging. Using T1-weighted imaging, the lesions are displayed with low signal intensity, meaning that the lesions appear darker than the rest of the brain. Using T2-weighted imaging, the lesions appear with high signal intensity, meaning that the lesions appear white and brighter than the rest of the brain. When T1-weighted imaging is contrast-enhanced through the addition of gadolinium, the open ring enhancement can be viewed as a white ring around the lesion. A more specific MRI, Fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI show the signal intensity of the brain. Subjects with tumefactive multiple sclerosis may see a reduction of diffusion of the white matter in the affected area of the brain. === Proton MR spectroscopy === Proton (H+) MR spectroscopy (H-MRS) identifies biochemical changes in the brain such as the quantity of metabolic products of neural tissue including choline, creatine, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), mobile lipids and lactic acid. When demyelination is occurring, there is breakdown of cell membranes resulting in an increase in the level of choline. NAA is specific to neurons and thus, a reduction in NAA concentration indicates neuronal or axonal dysfunction. As such, the levels of choline and NAA can be measured to determine if there is demyelination activity and inflammation in the brain. Usually, the ratio of choline to NAA is used as biomarker being higher in gliomas than in TDLs or MS lesionsRyotaro Ikeguchi et al., Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy differentiates tumefactive demyelinating lesions from gliomas, Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders, August 2018, doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2018.08.025 == Treatment == Typical tumefactive lesions have been found to be responsive to corticosteroids because of their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. They restore the blood-brain barrier and induce cell death of T-cells. No standard treatment exists, but practitioners seem to apply intravenous corticosteroids, followed by plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide in non-responsive casesKristen Krysko et al. Clinical Course, Radiologic Features and Treatment Response in Patients with Tumefactive Demyelinating Lesions in Toronto. Neurology 2015; vol. 84 no. 14 Supplement P4.018. High dose intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g for 3‚Äì5 days) followed by oral tapering hasten clinical and radiological improvement in approximately 80% of patients Plasmapheresis has been reported to work even in the absence of response to corticosteroidsShailee Shah, Sharon Stoll, Thomas Leist, Plasmapheresis in Corticosteroid-Resistant Acute Disseminated Demyelination: Report of Two Adult Cases, Neurology 2015; 84 no. 14 Supplement P4.048 === Disease-modifying agents === Pharmacologic treatments for MS include immunomodulators and immunosuppressants which reduce the frequency and severity of relapses by about 35% and reduce the lesion growth. Unfortunately they are mainly tested for RRMS and its effect in tumefactive lesions is unknown. The main ones are Interferon beta (IFN-beta), Glatiramer acetate and Mitoxantrone Plasma exchange has been reported to work at least in some cases === Treatment of symptoms === Due to the wide range of symptoms experienced by people with MS, the treatment for each MS patient varies depending on the extent of the symptoms.  Spasticity  The treatment of spasticity ranges from physical activity to medication. Physical activity includes stretching, aerobic exercises and relaxation techniques. Currently, there is little understanding as to why these physical activities aid in relieving spasticity. Medical treatments include baclofen, diazepam and dantrolene which is a muscle-relaxant. Dantrolene has many side effects and as such, it is usually not the first choice in treatment of spasticity. The side effects include dizziness, nausea and weakness.  Fatigue  Fatigue is a common symptom and affects the daily life of individuals with MS. Changes in lifestyle are usually recommended to reduce fatigue. These include taking frequent naps and implementing exercise. MS patients who smoke are also advised to stop. Pharmacological treatment include anti-depressants and caffeine. Aspirin has also been experimented with and from clinical trial data, MS patients preferred using aspirin as compared to the placebo in the test. One hypothesis is that aspirin has an effect on the hypothalamus and can affect the perception of fatigue through altering the release of neurotransmitters and the autonomic responses.  Cognitive dysfunction  There are no approved drugs for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction, however, some treatments have shown an association with improvements in cognitive function. One such treatment is Ginkgo biloba, is a herb commonly used by patients with Alzheimer's disease. == Epidemiology == Approximately 2 million people in the world suffer from multiple sclerosis Tumefactive multiple sclerosis cases make up 1 to 2 of every 1000 multiple sclerosis cases. This means that only around 2000 people in the world suffer of tumefactive MS. Of those cases, there is a higher percentage of females affected than males. The median age of onset is 37 years. As in general MS, there are differences for gender, ethnicity and geographic location. Based on epidemiological studies, there are about 3 times more female MS patients than male patients, indicating a possibility of an increased risk due to hormones. Among different ethnic groups, MS is the most common among Caucasians and seems to have a greater incidence at latitudes above 40¬∞ as compared to at the equator. While these associations have been made, it is still unclear how they result in an increased risk of MS onset. ==Solitary sclerosis== Normally a tumefactive demyelinating lesion appears together with smaller disseminated lesions. Hence the name \\"tumefactive multiple sclerosis\\". When the demyelinating lesion appears alone it has been termed \\"solitary sclerosis\\" This variant was first proposed (2012) by Mayo Clinic researches. though it was also reported by other groups more or less at the same time. It is defined as isolated demyelinating lesions which produce a progressive myelopathy similar to primary progressive MS, and is currently considered inside the Tumefactive Multiple sclerosis. Some groups have reported some kind of response of this variant to biotin Christine Lebrun, Mikael Cohen, Lydiane Mondot, Xavier Ayrignac, Pierre Labauge, A Case Report of Solitary Sclerosis: This is Really Multiple Sclerosis.

At the time of its completion, it was the largest earthen dam in North America east of the Mississippi. Its impoundment forms a lake with over 50 miles of shoreline. The dam impounds a reservoir with a surface area of 4,000 acres (1,618 ha) and its power plant has an installed capacity of 31.5 MW. ==History== After considerable investigation and planning by Consumers Energy in the 1920s, construction on the Hardy Dam began in 1929. It was designed by William G. Fargo and construction was carried out by his company, Fargo Engineering. Large amounts of concrete were placed into the foundation as solid bedrock was not present, particularly in the streambed. Allied Engineers began constructing the power plant in the autumn of 1929. In August 1930 the Muskegon River was diverted through the power plant penstocks and away from the dam construction site. The embankment of the dam was filled by March 1931 using the semi hydraulic method of construction. About of sand and gravel was used in the dam. Both the dam and power plant were complete by the end of 1931. Construction was carried out under the direction of Edward M. Burd, the head of civil engineering for Commonwealth Power Corporation, a subsidiary of Consumers. The dam and power plant are named for George E. Hardy, a financial partner with Anton Hodenpyl. Hardy and Hodenpyl (who also had a dam named after him) oversaw the Commonwealth and Southern holding company that Consumers Energy, was part of from 1910 through the 1920s. A serious flood in September 1986 raised the reservoir above the emergency spillway. Water seeped through joints and underneath the spillway creating voids that were later filled with grout. Hardy was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on Dec. 1, 1997. The listing notes the Spanish Colonial architecture of the powerplant buildings, including the oil house, intake, dormitory and powerhouse. In December 2008, the rehabilitation of Unit 3's Francis turbine began. The original 10 MW runner was replaced with one which increased the unit's installed capacity by 1.5 MW. Unit 3 entered back into service on 3 March 2009. ===Historical marker text=== Historical Marker at the site > Constructed from 1929 to 1931, on a site once known as the Oxbow, the Hardy > Hydroelectric Plant was built by Consumers Power Company.

The parks located on the impoundment lake of the Hardy Dam include, Newaygo County's Sandy Beach Park, Newaygo State Park, Mecosta County's Brower Park, and Big Prairie Township's Ox Bow Park and Big Bend Park. The reservoir offers excellent fishing and a nature trail system regarded as one of the best. The three mile unpaved path parallels the Muskegon River and contains 26 different trees with identification plaques. The trail area is home to wild turkeys, grouse and bald eagles as well as beaver, mink and otter. Fishing includes salmon, steel head, rainbow trout, brown trout, walleye, bass, perch and other pan fish. ==The Muskegon dam system== The three dams, Rogers, Hardy, and Croton (all owned and operated by Consumers Energy), are operated in different modes but in concert give a net run of river effect on water flow. The Rogers itself has little or no impoundment and runs in run of river mode, passing through as much water as it receives. The Croton and Hardy work in concert. The Hardy, which has a larger capacity reservoir, larger turbines, and is upstream of the Croton, runs in full peaking mode, meaning that the river flow is impounded and used to generate electricity during peak demand periods. This causes wide fluctuations in water flows and reservoir levels, typically with low outflow during the night when power demand is lowest. Full peaking was once very common but because of the outflow fluctuations, is now less common. However, with the Croton immediately downstream, and with no river segment (the Croton impoundment stretches back to the Hardy outlet), it can be run in re- regulation mode, allowing a natural flow rate to exit. The Croton reservoir level fluctuates inversely with the Hardy, rising during the day and lowering at night. Since the Hardy reservoir is so large, its reservoir level fluctuates about in total, while the Croton reservoir fluctuates about . During the winter and spring runoff, the Hardy is allowed to fluctuate much more. It can be drawn down up to to meet winter power demand but is required to return to normal levels by the end of April each spring. Together, the three dams of the Muskegon River (Rogers, Hardy and Croton) can generate about 45,500 kilowatts, with about 30,000 of that from Hardy, which is enough electricity to serve a community of nearly 23,000. ==See also== *Big Prairie Township, Michigan where the dam is located *Big Rapids, Michigan the nearest major city *List of Registered Historic Places in Newaygo County, Michigan ==References *Newaygo County Dept. of Parks and Recreation *Mecosta County Parks Commission *Newaygo State Park *Big Prairie Township Parks *River Country Chamber of Commerce of Newaygo County *Consumers Energy Category:Buildings and structures in Newaygo County, Michigan Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Michigan Category:Michigan State Historic Sites Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1931 Category:Dams in Michigan Category:Consumers Energy dams Category:Dams on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Earth-filled dams Category:1931 establishments in Michigan Category:Dams completed in 1931 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Newaygo County, Michigan ","title":"Hardy Dam"},{"id":"20450558","text":"The Academy of Music is a historic theatre building located in Lynchburg, Virginia.

Corvax and Thimbo try to find Amanda, but fail. Muzzy, Nigel, Bob, Ezra and Sylvia enter the hideout and confront Corvax. Thimbo confesses to Nigel that this hut is an operations center. Meanwhile Amanda is found but she cannot be seen. Muzzy constructs another invisibility device and uses it to make Amanda visible. All then go back to the palace. In the end, Corvax and Thimbo ride with sheep, to receive the unknown ultimate punishment offscreen (although it is accordingly known that in Britain it means 250 years in prison). ==Cast== * Jack May as Muzzy (a furry greenish blue extraterrestrial) and Norman's friend (a human) * Willie Rushton as King Nigel (a lion) and Additional Voices * Miriam Margolyes as Queen Erza (a rat), Norman's wife (a human) and The Servant Maid (a bulldog) * Susan Sheridan as Princess Sylvia (a rat), Amanda (a rat) and Additional Voices * Derek Griffiths as Bob (a mouse), Corvax (a green goblin) and Additional Voices * Peter Jones as Thimbo the Terrible (a bulldog), Guest #1 (a mouse) and The Shepherd (a pink goblin) * Benjamin Whitrow as Norman (a human) ==Credits== * Directed by: Richard Taylor * Executive Producer: Joe Hambrook * Original English Scripts: Wendy Harris, Joe Hambrook, Richard Taylor * Language Course Designer: Diana Webster * Animation: Richard Taylor Cartoon Films Ltd. * Additional Animation: Bob Godfrey Films Ltd. * Music by: Peter Shade * Produced by Richard Taylor Cartoon Films for BBC English by Television ==External links== * * BBC Muzzy ‚Äî Demos * Early Advantage ‚Äì Muzzy Products Category:1989 films Category:BBC Films films Category:British television films Category:British animated films Category:English-language education Category:English-language education television programming Category:British films ","title":"Muzzy Comes Back"},{"id":"20450605","text":" The Matka class is the NATO reporting name for a group of hydrofoil missile boats built for the Soviet Navy (Baltic Fleet and Black Sea Fleet). The Soviet designation is Project 206MR Vikhr. Following the 1997 Black Sea Fleet partition treaty all Black Sea Fleet Matka class boats were passed to the Ukrainian Navy. ==Design== These boats are the descendants of the and are a heavily modified version of the . There is only a single foil, the aft part of the hull hydroplanes at high speeds. They are air-conditioned and NBC- sealed. The SS-N-2 launchers are the same type as carried on the Project 61MR (\\"Mod-Kashin\\")-class destroyers. Despite initial reports that they were good seaboats, later information revealed that the Soviets regarded them as cramped inside and top-heavy. Of thirteen planned ships, one was cancelled and another started but never completed. All were built in Leningrad. After the breakup of the USSR, Russia discarded many and five went to Ukraine, one of which was later transferred to Georgia after a complete refurbishment. ==Project 206.6== R-44 serves as a developmental ship for the Black Sea Fleet, and was the first vessel anywhere to carry the SS-N-25 \\"Switchblade\\" missile, in two quad- canisters. These were removed in 2000 but re-installed in 2003. In 1998, the SP-521 combat data system was installed. R-44 also has the AK-630–ú1-2 Roy CIWS which is two 30 mm gatling guns superimposed on each other, in place of the AK-630. More recently, the ship has been seen with no \\"Drum Tilt\\" radar and a large deckhouse between the bridge and mast. ==Combat usage== On 9 August 2008 during the 2008 South Ossetia war, several media outlets reported that Tbilisi had been sunk in a nighttime action, either by a SS-N-9 \\"Siren\\" (likely from a ship) or a SS-N-12 \\"Sandbox\\" (from the ) fired by the Russian navy, which was moving a flotilla into position to enforce a Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) around the Georgian Navy's main homeport of Poti. Tbilisi was in fact destroyed by Russian Airborne Troops on 8 August 2008 while in port at Poti. The ship lost at sea was most likely the P-21 Giorgi Toreli. This would have appeared very similar on radar to a Matka-class vessel, having essentially the same hull and superstructure but different armament. ==Trivia== In Russian language, the word \\"matka\\" (NATO given name) means literally \\"uterus\\". The word has also meaning \\"queen\\" (of insect hive), which is the most likely connotation, since previous missile boat classes were named Osa and Komar, meaning \\"wasp\\" and \\"mosquito\\". ==Ships== A total of 12 boats were built for the Soviet Navy. A gun boat version without hydrofoils was offered for export. * - 1 boat The Priluki in service (2017) * - 1 boat The Tbilisi (·Éó·Éë·Éò·Éö·Éò·É°·Éò) transferred from Ukraine, sunk by the Russian Airborne troops in Poti port during the 2008 South Ossetia war {  width=\\"100%\\" - !

This article details the history of the channel, which dates back its founding to around 1980. ==Prelaunch== Prior to the channel's launch, the original concept for providing continuous weather reports to the public over television stations stretched as far back as the late 1950s and early 1960s on the varying incarnations of CATV. Through those systems, which typically brought in up to a dozen stations to the viewer from across the region, twelve slots on a cable dial would often leave a few vacancies. Early cable providers then devised a system where a single black and white camera, often one that was formerly used for local news production after an upgrade, would be placed on a rotating pedestal, capturing various dials and gauges on different stations to which it would pan automatically and remain in a given view for a few seconds before moving on. The different stations featured the time, temperature, barometer, wind speed, wind direction, and wind chill factor. Slides with the day's complete forecast, brief news headlines and community events often drawn up by the station's art department rounded out the package. This was the same system as that used by the early Devotional Channels and for the Stations of the Cross during the Christmas season. The Weather Channel itself was the brainchild of veteran television meteorologist John Coleman (former chief meteorologist at WLS-TV in Chicago and Good Morning America forecaster), who took his idea to Frank Batten, the then-chief executive officer of Landmark Communications. A major part of the plan for the new network was that it would be able to provide localized weather information to its viewers. This would be done through the use of specialized computer units, known as WeatherStars (\\"STAR\\" being an acronym for \\"Satellite Transponder Addressable Receiver\\"), which would be installed at the headends of cable providers that agreed to carry the channel. These WeatherStars were able to insert current local conditions, forecasts and weather warnings over the national feed, with the weather data being received from the vertical blanking interval of the TWC video feed and via satellite, which is then transmitted to the WeatherStar unit; the WeatherStar systems would also be capable of adding or removing segments seen during each local forecast segment, and providing other forms of non-forecast data (primarily local contact and address information for businesses advertised on the channel's national feed, which the STAR unit overlaid on a static graphic seen after certain commercials). The Weather Channel, Inc. was founded in Atlanta, Georgia on July 18, 1980.USPTO filings: First Use (not First Use in Commerce date on various filings, including filing w/ serial number 73369821) ==The early years (May 1982‚ÄìMarch 1986)== The Weather Channel launched on Sunday, May 2, 1982. Programming began with an introduction to the channel by Batten and Coleman, which led into an inauguration ceremony that launched the channel's first official broadcast at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time that evening, anchored by meteorologists Bruce Edwards and Andr√© Bernier. The channel originally focused on strictly providing weather reports and other meteorological information for the United States and other countries. The Weather Channel originally gathered its national and regional forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its local forecasts were sourced from the various National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices around the country. After only one year in the role, in 1983, John Coleman was forced out as the channel's president and CEO; at that time, he returned to his previous occupation as a television weather anchor, first becoming employed at WCBS-TV in New York City. The original Weather Star I model often interfered with the channel 2 signal at the cable headend; this issue was fixed with the upgrade to the Weather Star II in January 1984. The channel later rolled out Weather Star III, the third-generation STAR unit, to cable providers ‚Äì which began upgrading to the system in early 1986; the Star III included additional hardware improvements, and also added several extra forecast and observation features. ==\\"You Need Us\\" (March 1986‚ÄìJanuary 1991)== In 1986, The Weather Channel unveiled its first major image campaign and slogan (\\"You Need Us For Everything You Do\\"). The campaign included a custom lyrical theme (which was remixed in 1989) ‚Äì two versions of which were created: a full one-minute theme that was rarely seen on-air, and a more commonly seen 30-second version. In 1989, the channel introduced Prime Time Tonight, a three-minute segment that appeared eight times daily from 7:57 to 11:27 p.m., which served as guide to programs airing on other cable channels and provided airtime information and video clips. 1990 saw the introduction of the first Weather Star 4000 models, which similar to the Weather Star III, originally generated only text-based products. Radar imagery was added to the units in June of that year, with graphical backgrounds being introduced in July, making the 4000 the first STAR to be capable of generating graphics and the first to incorporate the channel's logo in the forecast segments. Also in 1990, The Weather Channel began including snow condition reports at five minutes after the hour. ==\\"Weather You Can Always Turn To\\" (March 1991‚ÄìApril 1996)== Largely considered the height of the classic TWC by enthusiasts, The Weather Channel underwent a major graphical revamp (with the introduction of a new slogan, \\"Weather You Can Always Turn To\\") on March 6, 1991.USPTO filing for Weather You Can Always Turn To, First Use in Commerce date; Serial number 74229581 Graphic elements included heavy use of gradients and the Caxton typeface. On July 3,First Use in Commerce date for The Weather Channel Connection trademark, serial number 74192763 on USPTO The Weather Channel Connection, a toll-free phone service providing weather information, was launched. Originally 1-900-288-8800, the phone number was reassigned in 1992 to 1-900-WEATHER (or 1-900-932-8437), a number was also used to promote the service in on-air and print advertisements. On November 1, The Weather Channel filed for a trademark on TWC, a common shortening of the name that was sometimes seen on-air.USPTO trademark filing for TWC, First Use in Commerce date. Registration number 1925906 By 1993, The Weather Channel was available to 90% of U.S. households with cable television service. On January 10, 1994, TWC placed an order to build 1,000 units for a new STAR model known as the Weather Star Jr, a budget model developed by Wegener Communications, which builds equipment for cable headends. 1995 brought a variety of changes to TWC, setting the stage for more changes that occurred the following year. Minor graphical tweaks were made, while local forecast segments began incorporating Short Term Forecasts issued by local National Weather Service offices as the \\"Local Update\\" (which in turn destabilized flavor lineups and caused the discontinuation of narration). The 30-Day Outlook was discontinued by the National Weather Service (which required TWC to discontinue the product). New programs included the introductions of WeatherScope (a top/bottom of the hour weather discussion) and a special on how weather affected the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7. That year also featured the premiere of Sky on Fire, a documentary on lightning. The music of Trammell Starks, used on Weatherscan and emergency cases since 2000, premiered at the end of the year with Starks' various other music pieces being used by the channel until early 2012. ==Major modernization (April 1996‚ÄìMarch 1998)== The WeatherScope title screen between 1996 and 1998. In two years, The Weather Channel dramatically changed its on-air presentation. The first wave of change came on April 15, 1996, with the introduction of a new slogan (\\"No Place on Earth Has Better Weather\\"), that was heralded with a trio of humorous spots promoting the accuracy of TWC's weather coverage. Months later, The Weather Channel received its biggest graphical overhaul since 1991, the modernization of TWC's presentation included the introduction of a newer, flatter logo (although its previous logo remained in use on some segments, and some specialty segments retained narration by Dan Chandler and/or the previous TWC logo into late 1997Videos posted on twcdan.com), as well as a new graphics package featuring rotating globes and compass points for introductions, and new music. 1996 also saw the launch of The Weather Channel's website, weather.com. \\"Local on the 8s\\", a concept in which local forecasts aired in ten-minute intervals at times ending in \\"8,\\" beginning at eight minutes past the hour, also made its debut. The first iteration of \\"Local on the 8s\\" was somewhat short-lived, only lasting until early 1998. The concept was later revived in December 2001, and remains in use by TWC to this day. The Weather Channel logo used from 1996 to 2005; this logo was still used on the Weather Star 4000. On October 15, 1996, Landmark Communications purchased a building at 300 Interstate North (near the junction of Interstates 75 and 285 in Atlanta) to house The Weather Channel's operations. Landmark had been looking for new studio facilities for the channel, and requirements included 18-foot ceilings. Improvements were made to bring the building up to code before TWC moved into its new headquarters at the end of 1996 (but it did not begin broadcasting from the facility until early 1997). By 1996, The Weather Channel reached 63 million homes, with average ratings totaling at 130,000 viewers at that time. On March 31, 1997, the channel revised its programming schedule with the introduction of a news wheel format. On August 25, the channel debuted a memorable advertising campaign, The Front, created by ad agency TBWA Chiat/Day. The promos (which used the slogan, \\"Weather Fans, You're Not Alone\\") were set in something akin to a sports bar, with the major difference being that weather was the central focus. That October, 1997 World Series became the first major event that TWC covered with live reporters. New title bars were introduced for national segments on January 6, 1998. ==The second wave of change (March 1998‚ÄìJune 2001)== An example of the graphics seen on The Weather Channel from 1998 to 2001. On March 11, 1998, TWC introduced a graphical refresh, featuring heavy use of the Akzidenz-Grotesk typeface and footage of clouds at the core of the new identity (though maps with the new look had been in use since January of that year). For the first time in the channel's history, there was no slogan or unifying theme, aside from an oval symbol with a crescent shape seen frequently in graphics (such as the Weather Center titlecard on the right). WeatherScope was replaced with Weather Center, a program which essentially comprised The Weather Channel's entire 24-hour daily programming schedule at the time in the form of three separate programs (Weather Center AM, a morning program focusing primarily on business, commuter and leisure travel weather; Weather Center PM, an evening program with a focus on forecasts for the day ahead; and an afternoon broadcast simply using the Weather Center title, which focused on ongoing weather conditions). April 1998 saw updates to \\"The Front\\" image campaign; one of the new advertisements specifically mentioned the 36-hour text forecasts (which, at the time, were still supplied by the National Weather Service), but heralded new Local Forecast graphics. The machine that produced those graphics, the IRIX-based Weather Star XL,USPTO filing, serial number 75252018. Date of first use in commerce, October 30, 1996. was released to cable providers later that year as the first new mainline STAR unit manufactured in eight years. The catalyst for a top-to- bottom modernization of the local forecast segment, the XL's graphical and technological capabilities were significantly more advanced than the 4000, with an animated, high-quality output consistent with TWC's national graphics and new scalable icons that would be used for eight years on TWC (these icons remain in use by Weather Star XLs still in service and on certain downloadable web widgets). 1999 brought the removal of the unpredictable-length Local Update product on the Weather Star 4000, which stabilized flavor lineups. Also in 1999, The Weather Channel launched a spin-off network called Weatherscan Local (now Weatherscan), a channel offering continuous weather information 24 hours a day, which exclusively provided local forecasts generated by specialized STAR units. Originally exclusive to Comcast systems, cable operators could add optional packages featuring expanded weather information or specialty forecasts (such as golf, boat and beach, or marine weather) to their Weatherscan STAR systems. The Weather Channel also appointed Decker Anstrom to serve as president of the network. By 1999, The Weather Channel reached 70 million homes, or 98% of all households that subscribe to cable television. It also provided radio forecasts to more than 250 radio stations and weather information to 52 newspapers. Between 1999 and 2000, TWC aired weather observation reports from Mount Everest using battery-powered sensors. In 2000, the channel's Weather Star XL systems introduced an audio function, Vocal Local, which assembles narration tracks heard during local forecast segments to introduce forecast products, and read descriptive forecasts and primary weather observations; while most cable operators added the Vocal Local feature, some did not employ it on their Weather Star XL units. The cycling of music playlist changes was increased from a quarterly to a monthly basis; as such, 2000 is considered to be the year the split between the \\"classic\\" TWC and \\"modern\\" TWC occurred by several websites. On August 23 of that year, the channel debuted Atmospheres, a weekly newsmagazine-style program hosted by Jim Cantore and Mishelle \\"Mish\\" Michaels. Also in 2000, The Weather Channel starting moving away from showing 24/7 Weather Center with the introduction of two new morning programs: First Outlook (5-7am) and Your Weather Today (7-9am). Weather Center AM now only broadcast from 9am to noon on weekdays, however it continued to air full-time on weekends until early 2001. In 2001, Weatherscan introduced forecast products compiled by TWC, which replaced the zone forecasts sourced from National Weather Service forecast offices. Whereas the NWS forecasts were produced for various U.S. jurisdictions (counties, parishes and boroughs), the new TWC forecasts focused on more individual areas, beneficial to multi-county viewing zones served by one STAR. In May 2001, TWC launched \\"Rays Awareness\\", an initiative focused on sun safety, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and American Academy of Dermatology. ==The \\"Live By It\\" era (June 2001‚ÄìAugust 2005)== On June 25, 2001, The Weather Channel introduced completely redesigned introductions for its local forecast segments and forecast programs, as well as a new slogan (\\"Live By It\\"). The separate morning Weather Center AM and nighttime Weather Center PM programs were also discontinued, with Weather Center becoming a single general program rather than existing in the form of three separate daypart-specific editions, having been significantly pared down with the introduction of new programs such as Evening Edition (weeknights 9pm-3am (including long-form programs)) and Weekend Now (weekends 5-11am). The Weather Star XL received a graphical refresh for the first time in September 2001, which included the introduction of different colors on text boxes, a new cloud background, improved regional forecast and radar maps, and new title bars and fonts that, as with the previous version, matched the on-air graphics that were used by TWC at the time. In April 2002, the TWC-compiled local forecasts introduced the previous year on Weatherscan replaced the forecasts sourced by the National Weather Service on the WeatherStar systems. As NWS bulletins/warnings were included in the old forecasts, a Weather Bulletins page was introduced that displays the applicable watches, warnings and advisories (on WeatherStar 4000 units, The Weather Channel incorporates National Weather Service bulletins in the text-based local forecast, as the 4000 does not feature the Weather Bulletins slide among its products). TWC celebrated its 20th anniversary in May 2002; in honor of the event, the channel premiered a retrospective special, as well as a book chronicling the channel's history, The Weather Channel: The Improbable Rise of a Media Phenomenon, written by TWC founder Frank Batten and Jeffrey L. Cruikshank and published by Harvard Business Press. The first long-form programs debuted on The Weather Channel at the beginning of 2003, with Storm Stories becoming the first program that was not weather or a documentary-type special. Also in 2003, the \\"Live By It\\" campaign was refreshed slightly. Weatherscan received a new graphical design in February and moved to a modern STAR platform, known as the IntelliStar. The FreeBSD-based IntelliStar is more flexible than the IRIX- based Star XL for making software and product updates. Plans to revive \\"The Front\\" as a weather discussion board were proposed and scrapped that year.USPTO filing, serial number 76486135 STAR systems were introduced and decommissioned during 2004. The IntelliStar systems began to be rolled out to various cable providers around the U.S. to generate The Weather Channel's local forecasts and Lower Display Line. The Weather Star III was also discontinued from service as it did not meet DTMF tone and weather warning regulations. In October 2004, the United States Postal Service and TWC teamed up to create stamps depicting clouds and an accompanying \\"Cloudscapes\\" educational campaign ‚Äì aimed at kids in grades 3 through 5 ‚Äì to help learn about cloud types to tell of pending weather conditions that was sent to 200,000 educators around the U.S., was unveiled at the Blue Hill Observatory in Boston, Massachusetts. ==\\"Bringing Weather to Life\\" (August 2005‚ÄìJune 2008)== The current Weather Channel logo, used since August 15, 2005. In early 2005, The Weather Channel announced that it would undergo a major branding refresh in August. The rebranding was part of a long-running effort aimed at reducing the network's dependence on \\"commodity\\" viewers (those looking for forecast information) and attracting what then-TWC president Patrick Scott calls \\"vitalists\\" (those with an active interest in weather) and \\"planners\\" using the channel to plan the week. The new look officially debuted on August 15, 2005 at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time, which included the debut of a simplified square logo and a new slogan (\\"Bringing Weather to Life\\"). Additional long- form programs were also introduced, such as the climate-focused The Climate Code with Dr. Heidi Cullen (later renamed Forecast Earth) and It Could Happen Tomorrow. In May 2007, The Weather Channel celebrated its 25th anniversary. To commemorate the event, select past Weather Channel promotional campaigns were featured on-air during commercial breaks; a modified 25th anniversary edition of its logo was also used. On June 17 of that year, TWC entered into an exclusive partnership with MSNBC to provide weather content for the msnbc.com website. On September 26, The Weather Channel launched a high-definition simulcast feed; it also introduced a major refresh for the IntelliStar, with new titles and backgrounds on October 23. 2008 started with uncertainty, as reports surfaced about sexual harassment allegations regarding on-camera meteorologist Bob Stokes. Fellow TWC meteorologist Hillary Andrews filed a lawsuit against The Weather Channel in Cobb County district court alleging the abuse by Stokes (in which she alleged Stokes made suggestive statements to her such as \\"will you lick my swizzle stick\\" and that TWC \\"covered [the harassment] up\\"). Andrews won her lawsuit that May, and was awarded an undisclosed amount of money. During the proceedings, it was revealed that Melissa Barrington, who co-anchored alongside Stokes before Andrews was assigned the duties, was also harassed by Stokes. At the same time, Landmark Communications announced it would be selling most of its assets, including broadcast television stations, newspapers, The Weather Channel, and data center facilities. ==Sale to NBC/Bain/Blackstone consortium and transition to high-definition (June 2008‚ÄìNovember 2013)== right On June 2, 2008, The Weather Channel unveiled its first major modernization since 2005. This included the introduction of new graphics and opening title sequences for every TWC program, a new lower display line for IntelliStar units that incorporates tabs (another first) to serve as a rundown for the forecast data being shown on the LDL, and a full thrust into the channel's new high definition studio and set. By August 12, the channel stopped broadcasting its forecast programming from its former studio facilities at the Cumberland headquarters, which would eventually be converted into offices. On July 7, 2008, NBC Universal and private equity firms The Blackstone Group and Bain Capital purchased The Weather Channel and all related assets (including weather.com, Weather Services International and a 30% stake in Canadian company Pelmorex) from Landmark Communications for $3.5 billion. Later, Landmark announced it was halting the sales of most of the other properties except for one newspaper; The Weather Channel was the only property sold by Landmark (the company would resume the sale of its other remaining assets beginning in 2012, concluding with the 2014 sale of KLAS-TV in Las Vegas to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group). As a result of its new association with NBC, live programming such as Your Weather Today began featuring live video content sourced from the network's owned-and-operated and affiliated stations to provide supplementary coverage during significant weather events, as well as live or videotaped field reports from reporters employed by local NBC stations. TWC personalities and on-camera meteorologists, such as Jim Cantore and Mike Seidel, have also appeared on NBC News and MSNBC since the sale. In September 2008, TWC launched a new program airing from 4:30am to 5am every weekend, Sunrise Weather, presented by Ray Stagich alongside Mike Seidel on Saturdays and Alex Wallace on Sundays. It had the shortest runtime and placed more emphasis on straightforward forecasts than most other TWC shows. However, it was one of the channel's lowest-viewed show (as it broadcast in weekend early slot). In November 2008, The Weather Channel became part of NBC Universal's \\"Green is Universal\\" campaign to promote environmental awareness. The channel utilized a green version of its logo for use during the campaign; IntelliStar systems were sent an update that allowed them to display the logo when the campaign is ongoing during November and April (which is normally done from master control on other networks). Ironically, in the middle of \\"Green Week\\" (on November 20), The Weather Channel instituted major layoffs ‚Äì described as cost synergies ‚Äì including three active on-camera meteorologists and one former one, as well as of the marketing department, the Road Crew (originally including Jeff Mielcarz, although Mielcarz later appeared on some weather.com video forecasts in December 2008), significant portions of the TWC Radio Network, and the Forecast Earth/environmental unit (however, certain portions of the Forecast Earth unit remain with TWC). The layoffs took effect on November 30 (The Weather Channel later stated it would air other environmental programs). With the shutdown of NBC Weather Plus that month as a result of NBC Universal's partial acquisition of The Weather Channel, certain meteorologists from the digital broadcast network were eventually integrated into TWC's on-camera weather staff; forecasting, radar and graphics systems used by other NBC Universal television news properties (including NBC News, CNBC and MSNBC) replaced the Weather Plus-branded banner graphics to fit The Weather Channel's graphics scheme. Meteorologists that were employed with NBC Weather Plus continued to be based from NBC Universal's corporate headquarters at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, and appeared often on MSNBC until the 2009 closure of the entire division. One of the motives for the cuts was in order to aid a $500 billion budget cut at NBC Universal's parent company General Electric; NBC Universal and CNBC also made cuts to slash their budgets. In February 2009, The Weather Channel laid off four on-camera meteorologists. Midway through the month, it was discovered by members to a TWC fan forum and a leak on the channel's media kit that The Weather Channel would radically revamp its schedule; between February 21 and March 1, TWC would drop four programs (Evening Edition, Abrams & Bettes: Beyond the Forecast, Forecast Earth and Weekend Outlook), while dramatically revamping Weather Center and reassigning meteorologists Mike Bettes and Stephanie Abrams to host the block of the program that replaced Beyond the Forecast. It had already been announced that Storm Stories would return as part of \\"Tornado Week\\", a seven- day event featuring original specials and episodes of its original programs centering on tornadoes. The program changes were some of the most far-reaching since 2003, which saw the creation of programs such as Day Planner and PM Edition. In March 2009, TWC personalities and programs dramatically ramped up use of Twitter ‚Äì at the same time, other NBC Universal properties (especially MSNBC) did the same; programs now regularly feature tweets submitted by viewers. On March 5, 2009, TWC appointed Geoffrey Darby as Executive Vice President of Programming and Production. Under Darby, Abrams and Bettes were reassigned to host Your Weather Today; First Outlook was reduced by one hour to make way for Wake Up With Al, a new weather and entertainment program hosted by Today weather anchor Al Roker; the jazz music long featured during the channel's local forecast segments was also dropped and replaced with instrumental rock music at Darby's request; this particular change was even confirmed by Chris Geith, the only remaining jazz artist whose music was featured in the forecast playlists, who stated that TWC had sent out a request proposing the creation of production music branded with a common signature for the channel. TWC began showing weekly movies related to weather on Friday nights, beginning with the October 30, 2009 telecast of The Perfect Storm (other films aired by the channel, some of which had only marginal ties to weather at best, included March of the Penguins and Misery); this particular decision was heavily criticized by many viewers and media analysts. The move to air movies on TWC had been planned for some time, even before the NBC/Blackstone/Bain acquisition. After December 2009, these weekly movies were temporarily replaced by the primetime edition of Weather Center, which already aired in the time period during the rest of the work week. Despite the controversy, the Friday night film block returned on March 26, 2010 with the broadcast of Into Thin Air; additional viewer criticism stemming from both the broadcast of movies on a news and information channel and an incident during an April 2010 tornado outbreak in which a scheduled broadcast of the movie Wind aired instead of wall-to-wall severe weather coverage, resulted in TWC deciding to permanently drop its film block in May 2010. In January 2011, TWC announced that Australian-born landscape photographer Peter Lik would be starring in a new half-hour action-adventure nature reality series, From the Edge with Peter Lik, which debuted on March 31 and is produced by NBC's in- house production unit, Peacock Productions. Lik also served as a special contributor for TWC, providing segments from his frequent travels to weather- impacted locales. Later in 2011, the Intellistar 2, the first STAR unit capable of generating high definition graphics, began to be gradually rolled out to cable providers across the country. The Intellistar 2 is strictly used to generate data and graphics for the \\"Local on the 8s\\" segments seen on the high definition feed, while the first-generation Intellistar remains in use to provide weather information on The Weather Channel's standard definition feed. The Weather Channel marked the 30th anniversary of its launch in May 2012. In August 2012, former CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf joined TWC as a weather forecaster. On July 1, 2013, Eric Fisher left the network. On September 6 of the same year, Crystal Egger left the network. On the same night, Chris Warren and Jim Cantore counted down Crystal for a special Top 5. ==\\"It's Amazing Out There\\" (November 2013‚Äìpresent)== On November 12, 2013, at 4:00am during Weather Center Live (anchored by Jen Carfagno and Alex Wallace), The Weather Channel implemented a new graphics package on the Intellistar and IntelliStar 2 that closely resembles the graphical display of a mobile app. The LDL's display was also extended to be shown during commercial breaks (except for those locally inserted by cable providers) and long-form programming. In addition, First Forecast, Day Planner, On the Radar, Sunrise Weather, Weekend View and Weekend Now (respectively weekdays from 4-5:30 a.m., 11 a.m.-2 p.m. and 5-8 p.m. and weekends from 4:30 a.m.-2 p.m.) were all merged into the Weather Center Live umbrella title, as certain other editions of that program (specifically, the weekend 4:00 and 7:00 p.m., and nightly 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time broadcasts) were simultaneously replaced by additional long- form programming. A new set also debuted, replacing the high-definition capable set introduced in 2008. The Weather Channel also debuted two new slogans: \\"It's Amazing Out There\\" and \\"Weather All The Time\\". On December 2, 2013, The Weather Channel announced that Good Morning America weather anchor Sam Champion would be joining the network, serving as both the channel's weather editor and as an on-camera meteorologist. On March 17, 2014, Champion began hosting a new morning program on the channel, America's Morning Headquarters, which replaced Morning Rush on that date. On January 14, 2014, DirecTV became the first major pay television provider to drop The Weather Channel, as a result of the channel and the satellite provider being unable to come to terms on a new carriage agreement. TWC was substituted in its DirecTV channel slot (on channel 362) by WeatherNation TV (which traces its roots to The Weather Cast, a short-lived network that was intended to replace TWC on Dish Network due to a similar carriage dispute in May 2010 that was later resolved; DirecTV originally began carrying WeatherNation on the adjacent channel 361 on December 31, 2013); representatives for DirecTV stated that it added WeatherNation TV in response to subscriber complaints regarding the amount of reality programs on The Weather Channel, which it estimated had amounted to 40% of its daily schedule. On April 8, 2014, The Weather Channel and DirecTV both settled on a new agreement that in addition to restoring the channel to DirecTV on channel 362 the following day (although DirecTV would not restore the red button feature that allows subscribers to access TWC- supplied local forecasts until May 2, 2014), also resulted in the channel's decision to trim the amount of reality programming on its weekday schedule in half (relegating it to the nighttime hours daily and on weekend afternoons) in response to subscriber complaints regarding the decrease of forecast programming. On April 21, 2014, popular meteorologist Dave Schwartz returned to The Weather Channel after a nearly six-year absence, but he died on July 30, 2016 due to cancer. On March 10, 2015, Verizon FiOS pulled The Weather Channel and its sister network Weatherscan after the provider and The Weather Company were unable to come to terms on a new carriage agreement; both channels were respectively replaced by the AccuWeather Network (which launched on March 13) and a widget provided by FiOS featuring forecast content provided by WeatherBug. Verizon cited the wide availability of the internet and mobile apps for consumers to access on-demand weather content as the reason for dropping TWC and its services. Finally, on June 24, 2019, The Weather Channel returned to Verizon Fios after a four-year absence. On August 20, 2019, The Weather Channel updated its graphics for the first time since November 2013, which resulted in the removal of the \\"L\\" bar and also, a new graphics package optimized for the 16:9 widescreen format. As a result, TWC is now broadcast in near-full screen 16:9; all programs, including live forecast programming, is now aired completely in the format. ===Upcoming shift away from long-form programming=== The late-summer of 2015 saw the start of extensive changes to The Weather Channel's schedule and operations. First on August 24, the channel premiered Weather Underground, a two-hour early-evening program hosted by Mike Bettes, which is co-branded with the sister website of the same name (which was purchased by The Weather Company in 2012), featuring an in-depth look at the mechanisms of weather. On September 1, Vivian Brown announced that she would be departing The Weather Channel after 29 years, having worked at the channel since 1986. Then on September 2, 2015, The Weather Channel announced that it would cancel Wake Up with Al after six years on October 2 (with Al Roker remaining with the channel to contribute to its breaking weather news coverage). On September 9, 2015, the channel announced a major phased overhaul of its programming schedule ‚Äì which involves a gradual return to a forecast- based lineup ‚Äì beginning with the announcement of a format revamp of AMHQ, with the program's host Sam Champion being moved to prime time on November 2 in an undefined role, while Stephanie Abrams would co-host AMHQ (as a result of the cancellation of Wake Up with Al, on which Abrams had been a co-host, The Weather Channel also announced that it would cease production from its New York City studio at Rockefeller Center due to the prohibitive rental costs). The network also announced plans to stop greenlighting original long-form programming, and expand live forecast programming on its schedule during 2016 once all remaining long-form programs already in development conclude their runs. In a memo sent out to network staff by Weather Company CEO David Kenny, it cited the refocusing towards weather-based programs was done on the basis that \\"our most passionate fans come to us for the weather and the science behind the weather, not our original shows.\\" As part of the overhaul, The Weather Company would lay off around 50 of TWC's employees (or 3% of the channel's 1,400 staff members), including production, engineering and financial staff, while overall spending for the television channel would be reduced to focus more on the company's internet and mobile properties. The channel also announced that it would launch Local Now, a localized weather, traffic and news service similar in format to Weatherscan, that is intended for distribution to over-the-top streaming services operating similarly to traditional pay television providers (such as Sling TV). ==Sale to Entertainment Studios== On March 22, 2018, Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios announced its intent to acquire The Weather Channel's television assets from an NBCUniversal/Blackstone Group partnership. The actual value is undisclosed, but was reported to be around $300 million; the channel's non-television assets, which were separately sold to IBM two years prior, were not included in the sale. ==See also== * NBCUniversal * Landmark Media Enterprises * Entertainment Studios ==References== Category:The Weather Channel Weather Channel Weather Channel Weather Channel Weather Channel Weather Channel Weather Channel Weather Channel Weather Channel ","title":"History of The Weather Channel"},{"id":"20450848","text":"The Gloucester Centurions are an American football team based in Gloucester. They currently compete in the National South League of the BAFA National Leagues. ==History1985-1993=== American football has been played in Gloucester since its d√©but in the United Kingdom. The first league team to play in the area was the Gloucester Boars, who played in the 1985 United Kingdom American Football Association. The team progressed to the Budweiser League and played as the Cotswold Bears during 1986 and 1987. They won the SW conference; on the way they played at Kingsholm Stadium, (the home of Gloucester Rugby) against the Cardiff Tigers in front of a crowd of 3000. The Bears folded at the end of the 1987 season. A new team was set up at Plock Court, Gloucester playing under the name of the Severn Vale Royals. The Royals took part in the British National Gridiron League during the 1989 to 1993 seasons, reaching a Bowl Final in their rookie year, but losing out to their bitter rivals, the Cheltenham Chieftains. The Severn Vale Royals closed at the end of the 1993 season and the team was replaced the following year by the West Country Phoenix. But less than a year later, the Phoenix disappeared. Several youth teams emerged during the mid-1990s but without any real success. However, in 2007 American football returned to Gloucester. ===2007-2008=== In early 2007 a team called the Gloucester Banshees set up in the city of Gloucester. Many of the Banshees staff were involved in previous teams, such as the Severn Vale Royals, West Country Phoenix, Cheltenham Chieftains, Cotswold Bears and the Gloucester Boars. After a 10-month feasibility study (to see if the interest was still there for American football), training began in early February 2008. The Banshees' first fully kitted game was with Premiership \\"giants\\" Bristol Aztecs. This game was a one-sided affair with the Aztecs posting 50 points without reply. But, the Banshees were soon to taste their first win, when they beat a full-strength Reading Renegades. A late- season game with Division One Oxford Saints ended with victory going to the Saints but the Banshees had successfully completed their Associate campaign and awaited the deliberations of the assessor from League HQ. Going on the strength of superb facilities that included a full-sized 100-yard playing field, the British American Football League promoted the Banshees to full league membership in November 2008. The Banshees drafted players from the now- defunct Hereford Chargers in preparation for their first season as full members of the British American Football League. ===2009=== The Banshees were placed into Division 2 Southwest conference and scheduled to meet the Cornish Sharks, Berkshire Renegades, Plymouth Admirals, Hampshire Thrashers on a home and away basis with 2 cross conference games, home to the Shropshire Revolution and away to the Staffordshire Surge to make up the 10 games season. Head Coach Maurice Myers lead a squad consisting mainly of rookies supplemented by American quarterback Derek Yenerall to an impressive 3-1-6 (W-T-L) record in their first full league season, highlights including an early season 21-all draw at conference favourites Hampshire Thrashers and a win at Plymouth Admirals. ===2010=== With Coach Myers still at the helm the Banshees approached the season with confidence that they could improve upon the previous year, however the early season loss of American quarterback Yenerall and dominant nose tackle Marcus Campbell to the nearby Premiership giants Bristol Aztecs was a major setback. The Banshees did manage an impressive 34-0 victory over the Cornish Sharks early on but that was to be the only highlight of the season as after that the loss of key offensive linemen Iain Vanes (career ending knee injury) and Karl Friston (joined Bristol Aztecs) decimated the offence even further. Despite creditable performances away to Watford Cheetahs and Milton Keynes Pathfinders the Banshees ended the season with a 1-9 (W-L) record. ===2011=== At the start of the 2011 season, the club members elected a new committee at the annual AGM. Three games into the season both the head coach and administrator resigned due to an internal dispute with regards to player selection. The Banshees appointed Colin Branagh to fulfill the vacant head coach position. A tough schedule including perennial title favourites Cornish Sharks, Berkshire Renegades, Bournemouth Bobcats, Bristol Apache and Welsh powerhouse South Wales Warriors saw the Banshees finish the season with an 0-1-9 (W-T-L) record. Shortly after the end of the season, head coach Branagh tendered his resignation and subsequently took up the general manager's role at Leicester Falcons. As part of an entire club restructure a submission for renaming the team was made to and accepted by BAFANL, and from 2012 onwards the team has been called Gloucester Centurions. ===2012=== The 2012 season saw the Centurions scheduled against Oxford Saints, Bournemouth Bobcats, Cornish Sharks and Bristol Apache. They ended the season with two wins, six losses and two draws. ==Team colours== The Gloucester Centurions play in a purple home kit with silver trim and their alternative is the old Banshees second strip (white with red trims). ==Media== The Banshees were featured on BBC Radio Gloucestershire and The West Country Tonight. ==References * Gloucester Centurions Website * Gloucester Centurions on Facebook * Gloucester Centurions on Twitter Category:BAFA National League teams Category:American football teams in England Category:Sport in Gloucester Category:2007 establishments in England Category:American football teams established in 2007 ","title":"Gloucester Centurions"},{"id":"20450857","text":"L is Candy Lo's third EP.

At the time, he needed 57 days of Major League service to become a vested member of the players' pension plan, which also provides health benefits. The ChiSox named Babe to their coaching staff to enable him to qualify. At the same time the White Sox had another coach, batting instructor Charley Lau, who was battling colon cancer. Babe and Lau both survived the 1983 season while undergoing cancer treatments. Babe died on February 14, 1984 in Omaha, Nebraska.Chisox Loren Babe dies He was 56.

In 2012 the football department of the club left to merge with FC Heilbronn to form a new club, the FC Union Heilbronn. __TOC__ ==History== After having played in the tier-one Kreisliga W√ºrttemberg (1920‚Äì22) and then the Bezirksliga W√ºrttemberg-Baden (since 1926) and winning the title there in 1931, Union's most significant football achievement was their 1933 championship in the Gauliga W√ºrttemberg, one of 16 top-flight divisions formed that year in the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich. That title put the team into the opening round of the national finals in a qualifying group that included SV Waldhof Mannheim, M√ºhlheimer SV, and Kickers Offenbach where they won only two of six matches.Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag The next year the B√∂ckingen side crashed to a ninth place finish and were relegated. They immediately bounced back and earned a string of upper table finishes before again being sent down for a single season in 1941‚Äì42. After two more seasons in the Gauliga the team withdrew from competition in November 1944 as World War II overtook the country. In 1938, B√∂ckingen took part in the opening round of the Tschammerpokal, predecessor of today's German Cup, where they were put out by Bayern Munich (0:7). Following the conflict, B√∂ckingen played in the Amateurliga W√ºrttemberg (II). A second place finish there in 1950 was followed by a failed promotion attempt, and a poor campaign in the subsequent season saw the club fall from the 2. Liga S√ºd to the now third tier Amateurliga W√ºrttemberg. They returned to second division play for a two-year turn before slipping into lower level competition for most of the 50s. They reemerged in the Amateurliga Nordw√ºrttemberg in 1963 and spent all but one of the next 14 seasons there. Second place results in 1966 and 1970 earned the team a place in the opening rounds of the national amateur championship. They also made their second appearance in the German Cup, again bowing out in the first round, this time to Bayer Uerdingen (2:8). Following the 1977‚Äì78 season Union descended to lower level play. In recent years, the club has been a steady member of the tier eight Bezirksliga Unterland, spending a year in the Landesliga in 2004‚Äì05 and briefly dropping down to the Kreisliga in 2010‚Äì11, but each time returning to the Bezirksliga straight away. The 2010‚Äì11 season saw the team earnining promotion back to this league by winning 25 out of its 28 season games and only being defeated once.Kreisliga Unterland A3 table 2010-11 Fussball.de, accessed: 21 September 2011 In 2012 the football department of the club left to merge with FC Heilbronn to form a new club, the FC Union Heilbronn.

A conjugate eye movement is a movement of both eyes in the same direction to maintain binocular gaze (also referred to as ‚Äúyoked‚Äù eye movement). This is in contrast to vergence eye movement, where binocular gaze is maintained by moving eyes in opposite directions, such as going ‚Äúcross eyed‚Äù to view an object moving towards the face. Conjugate eye movements can be in any direction, and can accompany both saccadic eye movements and smooth pursuit eye movements.Hodgson, D. (n.d.). The Classification of Eye Movements. Retrieved from Conjugate eye movements are used to change the direction of gaze without changing the depth of gaze. This can be used to either follow a moving object, or change focus entirely. When following a moving object, conjugate eye movements allow individuals to stabilize their perception of the moving object, and focus on the object rather than the rest of the visual world. When changing focus, conjugate eye movements allow for the perception of a stabilized world relative to an individual, rather than the perception of the world ‚Äújumping‚Äù as the individual‚Äôs gaze shifts. Without conjugate eye movements, there would be no synchronicity of the information obtained by each eye, so an individual would not be able to willingly move their eyes around a scene while still maintaining depth perception and scene or object stability.Enderle, J. D. (2010). Models of horizontal eye movements: Part I: Early models of Saccades and smooth pursuit. S.l.: Morgan & Claypool. Several centers in the brainstem are involved. Horizontal conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of the Ocular Nerve, CN III, and the Abducens nerve, CN VI, the paramedian pontine reticular formation, and the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi-medial vestibular nucleus. Vertical conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of CN III and the Trochlear nerve, CN IV, the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF), and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal.Fine structure of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal of the cat. J Anat. 1995 August; 187(Pt 1): 141‚Äì150. Disorders of conjugate gaze typically consist of the inability to move one or both eyes in the desired direction, or the inability to prevent eyes from making vergence movements. Conjugate gaze palsy: Conjugate gaze palsies typically affect horizontal gaze, although some affect upward gaze. Few affect downward gaze. These effects can range in severity from a complete lack of voluntary eye movement to mild impairments in speed, accuracy or range of eye movement.Ruben, M. (2017, November). Conjugate Gaze Palsies - Neurologic Disorders. Retrieved from Internuclear ophthalmoplegia: Internuclear ophthalmoplegia affects horizontal gaze, such that one eye is capable of full horizontal movement, while the other is incapable of gazing in the direction contralateral to the affected eye.Toral, M., Haugsdal, J., & Wall, M.

The project is located between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, spanning a superblock from 129th Street to 133rd Street and is managed by the New York City Housing Authority. The project consists of six 20-story buildings containing 1,272 apartment units. == Development == The site formerly consisted of city blocks of tenements which were demolished via slum clearance, beginning in 1957. Manhattanville Houses were completed June 30, 1961 at a cost of $24 million. The project was designed by modernist architect William Lescaze in the \\"tower in the park\\" concept in vogue during the mid-20th century which emphasized view corridors that bring air and light to housing residents. Safety quickly began to decline in the development and tenants began to organize and patrol the lobbies. In 1962, NYCHA added six new guards to patrol the development. On June 4, 2014 the NYPD made the largest gang bust in New York history, arresting 103 individuals of gangs at the Manhattanville and Grant Houses with extensive help from the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. 95 of the 103 people arrested charged took plea deals. Since the raid, shootings have declined 34 percent but neighborhood residents and gang policing experts feel that the sweep didn't reduce gang crime or gang affiliation and anticipate more violence, citing historic tensions between the developments and institutionalized racism as motivations behind the bust. == Notable residents == * Tamika Mallory (1980‚Äì), Activist and co-president of the 2019 Women's March * Joe V.

He studied at Cooper Union, the Art Students League of New York, and abroad at the Royal Academy of Antwerp, Belgium. Early in his career he won the Temple Gold Medal of the Pennsylvania Academy for his portrayals of the Marvin Family. Chapin executed numerous portraits of well-known public figures; at least five of his portraits were commissioned by TIME as cover art. Other illustrators of Time covers during the period from 1942 to 1966, which has been called the golden age of Time covers, included Boris Artzybasheff, Robert Vickrey, Bernard Safran and Boris Chaliapin. Chapin's works have been acquired by many private collectors and for the permanent collections of the many institutions such as The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (where he taught portraiture), The Phillips Collection, The Art Institute of Chicago, The Newark Museum, Amherst College, The Dallas Museum of Art, Texas; The Asheville Art Museum, The Currier Gallery of Art, The Five College Museums Collections, The Harvard Art Museums, and The Indianapolis Museum of Art.

It was released through Jugoton in Yugoslavia. The album title is the closing line from the 1972 partisan film Walter Defends Sarajevo and it refers to the city of Sarajevo. The first track is the theme from the film. The album recording began in November 1983 in Studio 17 that was located in record producer Mahmud Pa≈°a Feroviƒá's house. Released by Jugoton, the record was out in limited circulation of 3,000 copies, indicative of the label's modest expectations, however, it started selling surprisingly well, eventually crossing the mark of 100,000 copies sold. It also received plenty of accolades, including making the list of top 100 albums in the history of pop and rock music in Yugoslavia published in the 1998 book YU 100: The Greatest Yugoslav Rock and Pop Music Albums. Das ist Walter is listed in the 87th place. The album was re-released in 2000 by Nimfa Sound. ==Recording== After gigging locally throughout 1982 and 1983 in their hometown Sarajevo at various university student clubs such as Kuk, Trasa, and CEDUS, Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje was ready to take the next step ‚Äî releasing a studio album. Consisting of seven energetic youngsters in their early 20s, itching to increase their profile on the scene, they recorded demos for some dozen tracks during spring 1983 in a studio in Kiseljak. The lineup that recorded the demos was ‚Äì frontman and vocalist Dr. Nele Karajliƒá, rhythm guitar player and main songwriter Sejo Sexon, lead guitarist Mujo Sna≈æni, bassist Samir \\"ƒÜera I\\" ƒÜeramida, drummer Zenit \\"FuDo\\" ƒêoziƒá, keyboards player Seid Mali Karajliƒá, and saxophonist Ogi Gajiƒá. At one of their gigs in Sarajevo's Trasa club sometime during summer 1983, the Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje youngsters were seen by 33-year-old Miliƒá Vuka≈°inoviƒá, established musician from Sarajevo at the time fronting his band Vatreni Poljubac having already experienced a measure of fame as former drummer of Bijelo Dugme during the 1970s. They also gave him their demo tapes at the gig. Liking what he saw and heard, Vuka≈°inoviƒá put them in touch with his friend and former ƒåiƒçak bandmate from the late 1960s, Mahmut \\"Pa≈°a\\" Feroviƒá, who now owned a modest recording studio located in his own house where he worked as producer. Going into the studio to record the album, Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje made some personnel changes compared to the lineup that recorded the demos six months earlier. The band got a new rhythm section with Munja Mitiƒá and ≈†eki Gayton becoming new bassist and drummer, respectively. Produced by Feroviƒá himself, the recording sessions began in November 1983 and took almost 7 months to complete due to various extenuating circumstances. Karajliƒá said the following about the recording sessions: The band's rhythm guitarist and main lyrics writer Sejo Sexon remembers the recording sessions as follows: Midway through the recording session, the young band got a hold of Raka Mariƒá, Bijelo Dugme's manager, who helped them find a record label that would release the material.

The innovative design Samuel Colt's first patent was granted in February, 1836, and Leavitt's granted shortly afterwards, in April 1837, indicating that both Colt and Leavitt were simultaneously working on designs for a new revolver. Leavitt's patent was granted before Colt had manufactured a single pistol, indicating that Leavitt was working on his own, without a Colt prototype to study. was manufactured only briefly before a patent suit by Colt forced the company to stop producing the Leavitt & Wesson Dragoon revolver. But Leavitt's early patents, and those of his partner Wesson, stoked competition and helped drive the technological and manufacturing boom that produced the modern firearms industry. ==Early life== Leavitt was born November 16, 1813, at Rye, New Hampshire, the son of Benning Leavitt, influential businessman, state senator, county commissioner and later Chicopee Selectman, and his wife Olive (Jenness) Leavitt. Daniel Leavitt married in 1838 at West Springfield, Massachusetts, Ruth Jeannette Ball. They had three children. ==Leavitt's early patent== Leavitt took out a patent on his new design on April 29, 1837, when the U.S. Patent Office When Daniel Leavitt secured the patent for his new revolver in 1837, the Commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office was Henry Leavitt Ellsworth of Connecticut. Ellsworth served as the first head of the U.S. Patent Office for a decade - from 1835 to 1845 - and was one of Samuel Colt's champions when the inventor started in business. granted him United States patent number 182 for an 'improvement in many-chambered cylinder firearm.' The early weapon, the second of its kind, was a .40-caliber percussion, 6-shot single-action revolver with a -inch octagon tip-up barrel. Leavitt took out his patent less than a year after Samuel Colt had obtained a patent on his seminal revolver, and before Colt had a chance to bring his new weapon to market. The patent was granted to Leavitt at his residence in Cabotville, Massachusetts, now part of Chicopee, Massachusetts.The selection of Chicopee by Leavitt and other early inventors and manufacturers would influence industrial New England for a century afterward. The legacy of machine-tool manufacture set up by early firearm manufacturers like Wesson, Leavitt, their employee Joshua Stevens, among others, later attracted the Duryea brothers, who chose Chicopee as the base of their early automotive manufacturing due to the town's depth of talent in machine tools and manufacturing. The design was radical in one respect. \\"The revolving cylinder which I use does not differ from such as have been previously employed in many-chambered guns,\\" Leavitt wrote in his patent application. \\"The improvement which I have made consists in giving a convex form to that end of the revolving cylinder which is in contact with the barrel.\\" Leavitt's innovation was the beveled face of the cylinder, which was designed to direct flash from the fired cylinder away from adjacent chambers, thus preventing multiple discharges, the major problem with early percussion revolvers. In his design, Leavitt attempted to solve the problem through the beveling and the new convex shape he imparted to the revolving cylinder.Leavitt built on his innovation for pistol design with a follow-up design some years later for a rifle using the same principle. Leavitt's design, wrote Philadelphia's Journal of the Franklin Institute in 1838, was \\"one of those fire arms which have several chambers bored in a cylinder, the axis of which is parallel to the axis of the barrel of the gun, and which chambers can be successively made to coincide with the said barrel.\\" But Leavitt's innovation, noted the Journal, was to make the end of the cylinder convex to draw off the fumes and flash of the cartridge explosions. ==Early firearm manufacturing== The inventor's early patent demonstrated that the firearms industry was attracting considerable innovation and competition as it was getting off the ground. (In the same year that Leavitt's patent was granted, the U.S. Patent Office granted two other men patents on innovations in many-chambered firearms). On February 25, 1836, Samuel Colt had been granted a U.S. patent (later renumbered X9430) for his patent for a 'revolving gun.'The first 10,000 U.S. patents issued between 1790 and 1836 were not originally numbered, and all records of them were lost in a fire at the Patent Office. The revolvers were produced in small quantities by the firm of Wesson, Stephens & Miller in nearby Hartford, Connecticut. In 1839 Edwin Wesson, principal of the manufacturing concern and himself an inventor, make some modifications to Leavitt's initial design, dubbing the new product the 'Wesson & Leavitt' revolver, which he began producing at a factory in Massachusetts, a concern which led to the formation of the Massachusetts Arms Company of Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. After a patent grant to Wesson in 1850, awarded posthumously, the first Wesson & Leavitt revolvers rolled off the line at Chicopee Falls. The enormous 40-caliber handgun weighed over 4 pounds and was nearly 15 inches long, with 7.1 inches of that in the barrel itself. In 1850/51 the firm produced some 800 copies of the new revolver, which could be reloaded by simply pressing a latch, raising the barrel and pulling the cylinder forward and off the axis pin. Along with the standard model, another thousand smaller .31-caliber Belt models were manufactured with a shorter barrel.Testing of the new revolvers by the United States Ordnance Department seemed to give the edge to the Colt weapons for their accuracy and penetration of targets, but some observers disputed the neutrality of the tests. The new revolvers were embraced by customers. General Winfield Scott, for instance, carried one of the smaller Wesson & Leavitt 32-caliber six-shot revolvers in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. ==Samuel Colt sues for patent infringement== 1851 Colt Navy revolver The success of the fledgling company's weapon soon attracted the attention of Samuel Colt, who sent his cousin Henry Sargeant to purchase one of the revolvers. Emboldened by the recent extension of his original patent until 1857, Colt sued Wesson & Leavitt, now run by Edwin's brother Daniel Wesson, who had gone to work for his brother Edwin in 1843 and who took over after Edwin's 1849 death. Colt's lawsuit alleged infringement of Colt's original patent on the revolver. The case went to trial in October 1852 before the United States circuit court for the District of New York. Both sides alleged tampering with the original U.S. Patent files as well as fraudulent exhibits. The case was extensively covered by the New York City newspapers.Colt's Revolvers, Important Suit for Infringement of Patent, The New York Times, October 14, 1852 A month later, Colt had overwhelmed the tiny manufacturer in court and won large damages. Massachusetts Arms Co. continued to manufacture revolvers based on alternate version of their revolvers with various less useful methods for revolving the cylinder to get around Colt's patents. The original company dissolved after the Civil War in 1866. Following Colt's victory, his attorney Edward N. Dickerson fired off a circular at the manufacturers in the firearms business. \\"You will please to take notice,\\" Dickerson wrote, \\"to desist forthwith from the sale of any REPEATING FIRE ARMS, in which rotation, or locking or releasing, are produced by combining the breech with the lock; or in which the cones are separated by partitions, or set into recesses; except such as are made by Col. Colt, at Hartford.\\" \\"Needless to say,\\" write the authors of Samuel Colt: Arms, Art, and Invention, \\"this circular had a chilling effect on the American arms industry.\\" A number of the firms warned by Dickerson capitulated and paid damages to settle with Colt. But despite this early victory, Colt's attorney warned his client not to persist with his patent infringement suits. \\"Nothing is easier than to get into a big law suit\\", said Dickerson, \\"but there are many easier things than to get out successfully. Your luck, as I suppose you will call it, has hitherto been very good - better than any other inventor in America by far, but it may turn, and another suit may bring out something which we know not of, and which may destroy us....\\" Dickerson may have been smarting from confrontations in the U.S. District Court battle, which turned into a jousting match between two of the foremost attorneys of the day: Dickerson representing Colt; and Rufus Choate representing the Massachusetts Arms Company. Nevertheless it was Dickerson - and his client Colt, who was away on business in Europe during the trial - who came out on top in the first courtroom dust- up. Despite the warning of Dickerson to his client not to press his luck, Colt's litigious salvos had one effect: they virtually shut down the output of his competitors for several years, and his firm became the largest manufacturer of civilian firearms during the 1850s. ==The aftermath of Colt's litigation== Samuel Colt, firearm manufacturer who crushed his competitors in his patent infringement case in 1852 Altogether the Massachusetts Arms Company - considered a predecessor of arms manufacturer Smith & Wesson - manufactured roughly a thousand of the .31-caliber belt models of the original patented revolver, 200 of which were purchased by the abolitionist Massachusetts-Kansas Aid Committee in 1856. Many of these firearms later found their way to abolitionist John Brown. The Massachusetts Arms Company continued in business, and after the expiration of some of Samuel Colt's original patents, as well as improvements in the design of its revolvers, the company manufactured an assortment of weapons. Several of its early employees, notably designer Joshua Stevens, went on to found other successful weaponry companies. (The J. Stevens Company, founded by former Wesson & Leavitt employee Stevens, was ultimately sold to New England Westinghouse Company in 1915 to produce military arms for World War I). The early inventor, although eventually crushed by the legal team of arms magnate Samuel Colt, had helped spur competition and drive technological improvements in the design of American pistols - guns later used in the Old West, the American Civil War and elsewhere, and the envy of the world's firearm manufacturers. Leavitt himself served in the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia in 1847 as Captain of Company F, 10th Regiment, 6th Brigade and was a member of the Chicopee Freemasons lodge. Leavitt did not confine himself to the design of firearms. On August 18, 1842 he was granted a patent (number 2755) for a 'Mode of Securing Bobbins in Shuttles for Weaving'. Leavitt's patent for an innovation for bobbins used in power looms demonstrated that the inventor had his eye on another emerging New England industry. It was an industry in which Leavitt had more than passing interest: his father Benning owned a Chicopee factory that produced bobbins. There is no indication whether Leavitt's patent for textile manufacturing was more successful than his firearm patents. ==Death== Leavitt died at Chicopee, Massachusetts on July 27, 1859. ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== * The Guns that Won the West: Firearms on the American Frontier, 1848-1898, John Walter, MBI Publishing Company, 2006, * Samuel Colt: Arms, Art, and Invention, Herbert G.

Prior to playing professionally, Brummett attended Wichita State University. With them, he won the 1989 College World Series Most Outstanding Player award while a senior. He is the only player from Wichita State University to win that award. In 1989, he tied for the Division I lead in wins with Kirk Dressendorfer and Scott Erickson. That total also tied him with Bryan Oelkers for most wins ever by a Wichita State pitcher. To close out his collegiate career, he had 13 straight victories. Overall, he had 43 wins, 59 starts and 424 innings pitched in his collegiate career. He also had 364 strikeouts. Brummett was drafted by the Giants in the 11th round of the 1989 amateur draft. He played for two different minor league teams in 1989, the San Jose Giants and the Everett Giants. For San Jose, he went 0-1 with a 5.59 ERA in two games. For Everett, he went 4-2 with a 2.88 ERA in 14 games (10 starts). In 1990, Brummett played for the Clinton Giants, going 2-2 with a 3.51 ERA in six games (four starts). He again played for Clinton in 1991, going 10-5 with a 2.72 ERA in 16 games. Brummett split the 1992 season with the San Jose Giants and the Phoenix Firebirds. He appeared in 19 games for the Firebirds, going 10-4 with a 2.61 ERA. In three games with Phoenix, he went 0-1 with a 7.71 ERA. He spent about half of the 1993 season in the minors and half in the big leagues. In the minors, he played for Phoenix, going 7-7 with a 3.62 ERA in 18 starts. On May 29, he made his major league debut, against the Atlanta Braves, pitching 6 innings, striking out three batters (all three were Ron Gant) and earning the win. He would end up pitching eight games for the Giants, going 2-3 with a 4.70 ERA. On September 1, 1993, he was the player to be named later in a deal that originally took place on August 28. The Giants sent a player to be named later (Brummett), Aaron Fultz and minor leaguer Andres Duncan to the Twins for Jim Deshaies. Brummett would start five games for the Twins, going 2-1 with a 5.74 ERA. Overall, he went 4-4 with a 5.08 ERA in 13 big league games. He played his final game on September 30. Although his big league career was over, his professional career was not. In fact, he played in 1994 for the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Boston Red Sox organization and the Salt Lake Buzz in the Twins organization. He went 1-1 with a 5.27 ERA in eight games for the Red Sox and 4-3 with a 5.53 ERA in 13 games with the Buzz. He did not play professionally in 1995, but in 1996 he played for the Tyler Wildcatters of the Texas‚ÄìLouisiana League. He went 4-9 with a 4.37 ERA in 13 games with them. He was inducted into the Wichita State University Hall of Fame in 1995. ==External links== * SABR *GoShockers.com Category:Living people Category:1967 births Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Minnesota Twins players Category:Salt Lake Buzz players Category:San Jose Giants players Category:Clinton Giants players Category:Phoenix Firebirds players Category:Pawtucket Red Sox players Category:Everett Giants players Category:Baseball players from Kansas Category:Sportspeople from Wichita, Kansas Category:Wichita State Shockers baseball players Category:College World Series Most Outstanding Player Award winners ","title":"Greg Brummett"},{"id":"20451418","text":"The Legend of the Book and Sword is a Hong Kong television series adapted from Louis Cha's novel The Book and the Sword.

Schmertz also had Mobil underwriting Masterpiece Theatre to improve Mobil's image, which Mobil has been sole supporter since the beginning of the series. He also considered having the company buy a newspaper, the Long Island Press. He instead settled on a \\"sort of TV network\\" as Mobil and Schmertz were frustrated with the network- developed anti-oil-company news and documentaries. ==History== Schmertz worked with SFM Media Service Corporation lining up 43 stations, primarily in the top 50 markets; half of these were network affiliates. Mobil paid $3.2 million to the stations for the 8 PM ET/PT Thursday time slot for 10 weeks. In the winter of 1976, Mobil launched its first show, Ten Who Dared, hosted by Anthony Quinn and adapted from a 1975 BBC documentary series, which was originally shown in the UK as The Explorers and presented by David Attenborough. The show dramatized the adventures of various explorers (including James Cook, Christopher Columbus, Roald Amundsen and Mary Kingsley), and was one of the highest budgeted BBC shows for its time. The commercials were exclusively for Mobil, with some of them in a \\"documentary\\" or reality-based format showing Mobil employees out in the field, and shown in a positive light. The show beat the networks in the ratings, defeating NBC's The Fantastic Journey, and even CBS's The Waltons.

It is spoken in the city of Kohat as well as in a string of villages running east along the road to Kushalgarh on the Indus. The dominant language of this area is Pashto, to which Kohati has been losing ground at least since Partition. Kohati forms part of the \\"Hindko proper\\" group of dialects alongside Awankari, Chacchi and Ghebi. It has borrowed words from Pashto to a higher extent than other Hindko dialects. A lexical similarity study based on a 210-item wordlist found out that it shares 79% of its vocabulary with the Hindko dialect spoken to the east in the city of Attock, and 76% each with the dialects further east in Talagang Tehsil and Haripur District, as well as the rural dialect spoken immediately north in Peshawar District. == Phonology == {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Kohati consonants; - ! ! Labial ! Dental/ Alveolar ! Retroflex ! Palatal ! Velar ! Glottal - ! Nasal     ()  ()  - ! Plosive       - ! Fricative      ()  - ! Rhotic       - !Lateral       - ! Approximant       } The plosive consonants of Kohati can take four phonation types: voiceless (), aspirated (), voiced (), and voiced aspirated (. The fricatives , and (and to a lesser extent ) are found in loanwords from Iranian languages, as well as in native words, where they are allophones of the corresponding plosives, normally before other consonants ( 'saying' vs. 'said'). Kohati has a single tone: the high-falling (indicated here using a circumflex accent over the vowel: ). This tone is present on vowels if they were historically followed by or by a voiced aspirate: 'way' <\\\\- , 'half' <\\\\- . Voiced aspiration, however, was preserved before a stressed vowel: 'brother'. Kohati shares with other Hindko varieties a historical \\"spontaneous\\" aspiration: 'one', as well as the preservation of the consonant cluster at the start of a word: 'three'. There are two phonological characteristics which distinguish Kohati from other Hindko varieties. One is the regular loss of nasalisation in rounded vowels at the end of a word (t≈© > tu 'you'). The other one is the peculiar realisation of historical -d í- as -i-, almost -yy-, in the word  åi 'today' and in forms of the verb 'to go', for example v åÃÉie 'let him go' (in contrast respectively to  åd í and v å…≥d íe in the rest of Hindko). == Grammar == Kohati has a peculiar distribution of the dative-accusative postposition. As in other Indo-Aryan languages, the form of the noun used before postpositions is the oblique: p ätt är 'son' for example has the oblique form p ätre. To this form Kohati appends the postposition √£ to form the dative-accusative: p ätre √£ '(to) the son', which is the pattern found in the rest of Hindko (in contrast to Punjabi where the postpostion is n≈© or Saraiki, where it is k≈©). But because the oblique form in the plural is also -√£, Kohati avoids the succession of identical vowels by switching to ko in the plural: thus p ätr√£ ko '(to) the sons'. == References  Bibliography == * * * A grammar sketch is found on pages 486‚Äì96.

It's released through Jugoton in SFR Yugoslavia. It is the band's first double album. Following the unexpected success of their debut album Das ist Walter (which sold more than 100,000 copies), the band's sophomore studio effort was somewhat of a commercial disappointment, selling just over 30,000 copies in Yugoslavia. The album was re-released in 2000 by Croatia Records. == Background == During the Das ist Walter promotional tour, at their concert in Rijeka on November 27, 1984, Nele Karajliƒá declared, referring to an amplifier that had just broken down, \\"Crk'o Mar≈°al. Mislim na pojaƒçalo.\\" (), which was recognized as a pun on Marshal Tito's death, landing the band in trouble. They were criticized by the media and a campaign against them resulted in the canceling of their concerts and the removal of Top lista nadrealista from the air. The affair got attention of the Yugoslav Security Administration (UDBA), as well. They were rescued by some leading liberal intellectuals, and magazines such as Polet, Mladina and Slobodna Dalmacija, who raise their voices in the defense of the group members and that affair snaps without prison sentences. In this atmosphere, the band recorded their this double album Dok ƒçeka≈° sabah sa ≈°ejtanom in the infamous SIM studio and released it in July 1985. The album has received widespread acclaim from critics, but was boycotted by the media. == Promotional tour == The promotional tour had extreme difficulties due to concern of the concert hosts and the enormous presence of the state police, as a reflection of the Marshall Affair. Despite several top concerts such as at Pionir Hall in Belgrade, Poljud in Split or Dom Sportova in Zagreb, tens of thousands sold tickets, the tour had a rather disappointing conclusion as the following year ≈†eki Gayton and Mustafa ƒåengiƒá left the band in search of a more secure means of making a living.

(German: S√§chsischer Bruderkrieg) was a war fought between the two brothers Frederick II, Elector of Saxony and Duke William III over Wettin ruled areas from 1446 to 1451. After a dispute over the division of certain family lands between Frederick II and William III, the Division of Altenburg eventually led to growing tensions between the two brothers and an inability to agree on who ruled which areas. After failed attempts at reconciliation, the war broke out and lasted for five years. The war was destructive and had no clear winner before being ended with a peace treaty at Naumburg. Following the war and subsequent divisions the Saxons lost much of their former power and influence within the different German states and families. ==Background== The House of Wettin and its line of Saxon princes gained a large amount of land over the years mainly through inheritance, including the Landgraviate of Thuringia, the Margraviate of Meissen, the Duchy of Saxony, and the Electorate of Saxony. Frederick I was the Elector of Saxony and Margrave of Meissen and ruled over all of the lands except for the lands in Thuringia. Frederick I's cousin Frederick IV of Thuringia was Landgrave of Thuringia and ruled over those lands.Carlyle, p.308 When Frederick I died in 1428, his four sons Frederick II, Sigismund, Heinrich, and William III inherited his lands jointly. Heinrich died in 1435, and in 1440 Sigmisund became Bishop of W√ºrzburg and renounced his claims to the land. Frederick, who was the eldest of the two remaining sons, now held the Electorate of Saxony and some land around Wittenberg in his own right, whilst throughout the remainder of the land he ruled together with William.Carlyle, pp. 308-309. This continued without serious incident for twelve years until, in 1440, Frederick IV of Thuringia died childless, and the two brothers inherited extensive land within Thuringia as well as the title of Landgrave of Thuringia.Carlyle, p.309 The division of this new land in Thuringia could not be agreed upon, and on 16 July 1445 the two remaining brothers tried to partition the land between them in the Division of Altenburg. When Frederick II chose the western part and not the Margraviate of Meissen on September 26, 1445 in Leipzig, William rejected the division. On December 11 of the same year they attempted to reconcile in the monastery of Neuwerk in Halle (Saale) in what was known as the Hallescher Machtspruch (English: the Power Dictum of Halle). The Archbishop of Magdeburg Frederick III of Beichlingen, the Margrave Frederick II of Brandenburg and the Landgrave Ludwig II of Hesse, actively participated as judges, however the two brothers failed to reach a peaceful resolution. ==War== War first broke out between Frederick II and William III in 1446 when they were unable to resolve their dispute.Czok, p. 163. Frederick proved stronger, and William brought in forces from Bohemia, including Hussites. Frederick's forces were led by commanders such as Kunz von Kaufungen, a captain from the tower of Kaufungen located near modern day Limbach-Oberfrohna. Frederick's forces under the command of Kunz won a victory at Gera and occupied the small town, however William's forces and Bohemian allies caused a large amount of damage to locations within Kaufungen in return.Carlyle, p. 310. Kunz himself had much of his property destroyed and was taken captive by Bohemians. Eventually he paid the sum of 4,000 golden gulden for his freedom, which was very extravagant for the time. No side could gain a clear advantage throughout the war and the fighting turned out to be an extended period of \\"ruinous confusion\\" for the region. The war lasted five years and ended on January 27, 1451 when a peace was reached at Naumburg.Historische Commission bei der K√∂nigl. Akademie der Wissenschaften, p. 779. This peace could not reestablish a joint rule, but let the two sides accept a peaceful division of the lands. ==Aftermath== After the war, Kunz von Kaufungen expected to be repaid by Frederick II for the massive losses of his property during the fighting. Frederick also had losses of his own and therefore followed the letter of his contract with Kunz and did not even repay the ransom Kunz paid to the Bohemians. Frederick stated that Kunz was just his hired soldier, and he was not bound to protect him or repay his losses. Frederick eventually agreed upon bringing in arbitrators to settle the case, but Kunz left the arbitration before hearing the verdict when he realized it would not reach his expectations.Carlyle, pp. 310-311. Kunz continued to complain and insult Frederick until Frederick banished him from the lands. Kunz left to Bohemia and lived in the castle of Isenburg.Carlyle, p. 311. Kunz eventually kidnapped Frederick's two sons, Ernest and Albert, from the castle of Altenburg in what was called the Prinzenraub (English: \\"The stealing of the princes\\").Carlyle, p. 312.Carlyle, p. 316. Prince Albert was found that very night when Kunz was caught, while Prince Ernst was released four days later when Kunz's allies released him for a pardon.Carlyle, pp.312-313. On July 14, 1455, Kunz von Kaufungen was beheaded by order of Frederick at Freiberg. The lands fought over during the war were ruled peacefully again, however this time separately instead of jointly. Eventually, Frederick II died, and his two sons Ernest and Albert inherited his lands jointly in 1464. When William III died in 1482, without any sons, they inherited his lands and split them between them by the Treaty of Leipzig in 1485.Carlyle, p. 317. The division of these lands and this war led to the Saxons losing a large amount of influence within the different German states and no longer being one of the most powerful German houses. ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:History of Thuringia Category:Wars involving the Holy Roman Empire Category:Wars involving Saxony Category:1440s in Europe Category:1450s in Europe Category:1440s conflicts Category:1450s conflicts Category:1440s in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1450s in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1446 in Europe Category:15th century in Saxony Category:Wars of succession involving the states and peoples of Europe ","title":"Saxon Fratricidal War"},{"id":"20451931","text":"Marko Wiz was a politician of the 17th century in Slovenia when the country was under the Holy Roman Empire.

Born in Tubber, County Clare, Taaffe first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Our Lady's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Clare minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He joined the senior panel during the 1993-94 league. Taaffe was a regular member of the team for much of the rest of the decade and won one All-Ireland medal and one Munster medal. At club level Taaffe played with Tubber Throughout his career Taaffe made 8 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 2000 championship. ==Playing careerColleges=== During his schooling at Our Lady's College in Gort, Taaffe established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team. In 1993 he a Connacht medal, a first provincial title for the school in almost a decade. St. Kieran's College provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. Taaffe's side were somewhat overawed by the occasion and were defeated by 3-15 to 1-10. ===Club=== Taaffe played both hurling and Gaelic football with Tubber and enjoyed some success during a lengthy career. After winning an under-16 championship medal he later added a senior B championship medal to his collection during the early stage of his club career. ===Inter-county=== Taaffe's underage career with the Clare minor and under-21 teams yielded little success. During the 1993-94 league campaign Taaffe was added to the Clare senior panel by manager Len Gaynor. He played in a number of games but was best known as a player on the fringes of the team. In 1995 a hamstring injury kept Taaffe off the starting fifteen, however, he collected a Munster medal as an unused substitute as Clare defeated reigning provincial champions Limerick by 1-17 to 0-11. On 3 September 1995 Clare faced reigning champions Offaly in the All-Ireland decider. Taaffe wasn't even named on the official list of substitutes but was introduced in the second half. After a long range speculative shot was sent towards the goalmouth Taaffe was at hand to send the sliotar to the net for the key goal for Clare. He was later substituted, however, Clare went on to win by 1-13 to 2-8 giving him an All-Ireland medal. Taaffe remained on the bench for the next few years, only starting one championship match. He won a second set of Munster and All- Ireland medals in 1997 as Clare triumphed over Tipperary in both deciders. In 1998 Taaffe won his first Munster medal on the field of play following a 2-16 to 0-10 defeat of Waterford in a tense provincial decider replay. After leaving the panel in 1999, Taaffe returned the following year and made a few cameo appearances as a substitute. His late championship game was a 2-19 to 1-14 Munster semi-final defeat by Tipperary that year. ==HonoursPlayer=== ;Our Lady's College, Gort *Connacht Senior Colleges Hurling Championship (1): 1993 ;Clare *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1995, 1997 (sub) *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (3): 1995 (sub), 1997 (sub), 1998 ==References== Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Hurling forwards Category:Tubber hurlers Category:Clare inter-county hurlers Category:All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners ","title":"√âamonn Taaffe"},{"id":"20451954","text":"The Francis Howell School District has provided education in St. Charles County, Missouri since 1830. Through mergers, it became the Consolidated School District No. 2 of St. Charles County in 1913, and the Francis Howell Reorganized School District #3 in 1951. Population growth in the 1970s and 1980s, and continued into the 1990s. In the last five years student enrollment growth has shown a slight decline from year to year. While annual fluctuations in growth rates are likely, enrollment projections indicate that student population during the next five years will continue its slow and gradual decline. Enrollment is expected to level off at approximately 17,000 students. The District currently provides education to approximately 18,000 students preschool through twelfth grade, and an additional 8,000 students in its early childhood education programs. The District encompasses approximately in the southeast corner of St. Charles County and is one of the largest school districts in the State of Missouri. The cities within the District‚Äôs boundaries including St. Peters, Cottleville, Weldon Spring, Harvester, southern portions of St. Charles City, and eastern portions of O‚ÄôFallon. The District‚Äôs educational facilities include ten elementary, five middle and three high schools; three early childhood centers, and two alternative education schools. The District was featured on the 2015 Jul 31 episode of This American Life. In 2013, the Missouri Supreme Court upheld a law that allowed students attending unaccredited school districts to transfer to other schools. A lawful decision was made that students from the neighboring Normandy School District would be able to attend schools within the Francis Howell School District. This led to Francis Howell district parents voicing concerns against the transfer of students even though they would pay out-of- district tuition. The town hall meeting went on for over two hours with almost 3,000 people in attendance. One parent stated : ‚ÄúI deserve to not have to worry about my children getting stabbed, or taking a drug, or getting robbed.\\" Many of these parents were later criticized by some as a result of these remarks. Other parents drew similarities between their current controversy and that of desegregation busing during the Civil Rights Movement.

He returned to England in around 1812, and was a partner in the East India Mercantile House (i.e. trading company) of Crawford, Colvin and Company. (See the Colvin family for more on the Anglo-Indian links.) He bought the estate of Pippbrook, near Dorking, Surrey in 1817 and made it his country home.Exploring Surrey's Past - Pippbrook From 1824 until his death, Crawford was a director of the Australian Agricultural Company.

He was returned as Member of Parliament for the City of London in August 1833, and sat until he lost the seat in the Tory swing of June 1841. He was in favour of the abolition of the window tax and opposed the Corn Laws and short parliaments. He died at Woodmansterne, Surrey and was buried in St Peter's Church there.

They have described their work as \\"mixing the arthouse with the dosshouse\\" and putting \\"highbrow performance in backstreet pubs and lowbrow performance in posh theatres\\". Supported by grants from the British Council and Arts Council England, Duckie is based in London but has played in Berlin, Germany, Greece and Tokyo as well as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Blackpool Tower Ballroom and the Sydney Opera House. It runs cabaret and club nights every Saturday at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern.. It won an Olivier Award for its show C‚Äôest Barbican. Duckie‚Äôs work is characterised by its engagement with the queer lifestyle and community, showcasing queer performers and performance art at its weekly Saturday club night and providing ‚Äúa creative forum for alternative gay and lesbian performance and culture‚Äù. Other focusses include anti-class and anti- corporate ideals, including a rejection of corporate culture and gay commercial culture. This latter is highlighted in Duckie‚Äôs highly successful Gay Shame events, produced annually between 1996 and 2009 as an alternative to Gay Pride. The company‚Äôs outlook is distinctly working-class, drawing influences in John McGrath, the Victorian music hall, punk culture and illegitimate theatre. == Background== The collective dates back to a club night called Duckie that started in November 1995 in south London pub the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, created by producer Simon Casson ‚Äì also known as ‚ÄúSimon Strange‚Äù ‚Äì and compere Amy Lam√©. They were joined by DJs Mark Wood and Mark Johnston - who called themselves The Readers Wifes [sic] - and box office artistes under the name of ‚ÄúFather Cloth and Jay Cloth‚Äù. Further members of the collective include Dicky Eton, Casson's co-producer, Mark Whitelaw and Robin Whitmore, director and designer for Duckie's larger shows respectively. Burston indicates that at the start of Duckie‚Äôs tenure the RVT was somewhat in decline: ‚ÄúLack of investment meant the venue remained dark during the week, only coming to life at the weekend with Duckie and ‚Ä¶ the Dame Edna Experience.‚Äù Burston also records that the opening of the gay nightclub Crash promoted Vauxhall‚Äôs potential for hosting such ventures, leading an influx of mainstream clubs into the historic gay area. The survival of Duckie, positioned in direct opposition to mainstream commercialised gay culture, highlights the effectiveness of their niche appeal. Despite this, and the potential in new audiences attracted by the larger clubs, Duckie‚Äôs growth was again challenged in 1998 when Lambeth Council and property developer CLS Holdings attempted to flatten the RVT to make way for a supermarket complex. Duckie was instrumental in defeating this threat: as Burston notes ‚ÄúThe performance club Duckie, which had breathed new life into Saturday nights, mounted a vigorous press campaign, protesting outside Lambeth Town Hall and saving it from the bulldozers.‚Äù In 2005, businessmen Paul Oxley and James Lindsay bought the RVT at public auction, bringing new investment to the venue and providing Duckie‚Äôs Saturday nightclub with a secure location into the foreseeable future. == Performance events == In December 2002, Duckie‚Äôs Christmas show at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern created the format of sitting guests at tables and offering them the chance to order short acts, using \\"Duckie dollars\\", from a menu. This was recreated at The Pit at the Barbican in December 2003 as C‚Äôest Barbican. It won four awards including an Olivier Award for best entertainment show and returned to the Barbican in 2004. The show toured to the Sydney Opera House as well as Berlin, Thessaloniki, Birmingham and Manchester. In December 2007, this show was recreated as C‚Äôest Duckie! at the CSV Cultural Center on the Lower East Side, New York City. In 2006, Duckie created The Class Club at The Pit, Barbican, a piece of event theatre that asked the audience to pre-select a social class for themselves, dress appropriately for the evening and then enjoy a meal and entertainment for their chosen grouping. Leading cabaret performers Chris Green and Ursula Martinez have worked as part of Duckie, and it has also attracted performers such as Dusty Limits, Janice Connolly, Scott Capurro, Kiki and Herb, Dina Martina and George Chakravarthi. ==Productions== As noted above, Duckie‚Äôs first theatrical venture was the creation of the Duckie clubnight at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, which has run weekly since its inception in 1995. * Gay Shame and Lesbian Weakness - an anti-Pride night that ran annually between 1996 and 2009.

She currently resides in California. Jenkins fled her home country during the Siege of Sarajevo and emigrated to London, where she studied at City University, London. ==Early life== Born in Sarajevo, Jenkins is the elder of two children in a middle- class Bosniak family. Her mother was an accountant and her father was an economist. She grew up in the concrete-block apartments that characterized communist-era Yugoslavia. Jenkins studied economics at the University of Sarajevo, but the outbreak of war in 1992 forced her to flee her home and spend more than a year in Croatia as a refugee before emigrating to London. ==Career== After graduating with a degree in Computer Science and Economics from City, University London, she acquired the swimwear line Melissa Odabash. In 2009, Sanela created and launched the Neuro line of functional beverages based in Sherman Oaks, California. ==Philanthropic activities== Sanela Diana Jenkins established The Irnis Catic Foundation in 2002 in memory of her brother who was killed during the Bosnian Conflict. The foundation provides essential funding to the medical facilities at the University of Sarajevo. In 2009, Diana Jenkins was awarded the Peace Connection prize by the Center for Peace and Multi-Ethnic Cooperation.

Miles was a native of the Eastern Shore. He had gone to school with Wallis Warfield. In 1924, he founded what would become one of Baltimore's more prominent law firms, Miles & Stockbridge. In 1952, he joined forces with Mayor Tommy D'Alesandro to bring a major league team to Baltimore. After a year of searching, they found an apparent candidate in the moribund St. Louis Browns. Their owner, Bill Veeck, had recently been broadsided by the sale of the St. Louis Cardinals to Anheuser-Busch. While Veeck had mounted a considerable effort over the past two years to drive the Cardinals out of St. Louis, he'd concluded he could not possibly compete against a team with Anheuser-Busch's resources behind it and was looking to move elsewhere. Veeck had wanted to move the Browns to Baltimore himself for the 1953 season, but was voted down. After the season, Veeck cut a deal with Miles and D'Alesandro in which Miles and other Baltimore investors would buy half of Veeck's 80 percent stake in the Browns, with Veeck remaining as principal owner. The proposal required six out of eight owners to vote in favor, but at an owners' meeting in New York City on September 27, only four voted aye, reportedly because Yankees co-owner Del Webb was rounding up support to move the Browns to Los Angeles. Miles realized that the owners merely wanted Veeck out of the way. In 48 hours, he lined up enough support from several of the Baltimore investors in the original deal with Veeck‚Äîsuch as brewer Jerold Hoffberger, investment banker Joseph Iglehart and real estate developer James Keelty‚Äîto buy out Veeck's interest for $2.5 million. This deal, along with the planned move to Baltimore, was unanimously approved. Almost immediately, Miles announced the team would be renamed the Orioles. With his fellow investors both frustrated with his domination of the team's business operations and dissatisfied with a pair of seventh-place finishes, Miles resigned in early November, 1955. Keelty succeeded him as president with Iglehart becoming board chairman.Miller, James Edward. The Baseball Business. Chapel Hill, NC: The University of North Carolina Press, 1990.

Ryman earned his BFA with Honors in Fine Arts and Art Education from The School of Visual Arts in New York in 1997. He is the son of artist Robert Ryman (1930-2019). Cordy Ryman is represented by Z√ºrcher Gallery, New York, NY. ==Works== Ryman‚Äôs early works were emotion based figurative sculptures but within his first year at art school he began to experiment with abstract representations. During his second year at The School of Visual Arts he was working on small scale collages. This is where Ryman began to develop his current casualist style. Ryman‚Äôs artwork is casual in style and fabricated with recycled wood and metal painted and reconstructed with sculptural elements, mimicking the traditional canvas in their display. The materials Ryman uses include wood, gorilla glue, scrap metals, studio sweepings, acrylic and enamel paints and other found objects. When working with wood, he often keeps the rough jagged edges visible. This creates a very tactile surface. Ryman alters the surfaces of his artwork to change the appearance but still allows for the character of the materials to be recognized. He sometimes combines mostly mute colors-white, silver, and creamy oranges- with small touches of bright hues on the edges and seams of his work. The end result is a fluorescent glow that is reflected onto the gallery spaces and the artwork itself. In a 2009 interview with Phong Bui in The Brooklyn Rail, Ryman says of his attention to the edges of his paintings: \\"I guess the main thing about the edges and the sides is that I think about them. In one way or another they are considered. When the sides are painted or accounted for in some way, it makes the piece as a whole seem more like a thing or an independent entity as opposed to a picture of something.\\" His works range from small to large and often interact with the spaces in which they are presented. When Ryman works on a smaller scale his paintings tend to be saturated with paint transforming the nature of the scrap materials he works with. The undulating surfaces of these works push the boundary between sculpture and painting. When Ryman creates work on a larger scale the pieces interact with unique properties of the installation space. Such pieces are found in the corners of spaces or rising and falling from the walls. In Ryman‚Äôs 2010 solo exhibition at DCKT Contemporary he showed the work Red Brick which consisted of a series of cut and painted wooden ‚Äúbricks‚Äù stacked upon one another in varying shades of red and pink. In this work Ryman questions geometry, order, and the nature of painting itself. ==Permanent Collections== *Microsoft Art Collection, Redmond, WA *Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, FL *Raussmuller Collection, Basel, Switzerland *Rubell Family Collection, Miami, FL *The Speyer Family Collection, New York, NY *Virginia and Bagley Wright Collection, Seattle, WA ==Awards== *2006 Helen Foster Barnett Prize, National Academy Museum, New York, NY *1997 Rhodes Family Award for Excellence, School of Visual Arts, New York, NY ==Solo exhibitions== *Z√úRCHER Gallery, New York, NY *DODGEGallery, New York, NY *Connor Contemporary, Washington, DC *DCKT Contemporary, New York, NY *Lora Reynolds Gallery, Austin TX *Kavi Gupta Gallery, Chicago, IL *Mark Moore Gallery, Santa Monica, CA *William Traver Gallery, Seattle, WA ==Group exhibitions== *Aberrant Abstraction: Keltie Ferris, Chris Martin, Cordy Ryman, Agathe Snow, Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, Johnson County Community College, Overland Park, KS *Nicole Klagsburn Gallery, New York, NY *One More, Esbjerg Art Museum, Esbjerg, Denmark *Lesley Heller Gallery, New York, NY *American Academy of Arts and Letters, New York, NY *National Academy Museum and School of the Arts, New York, NY *Greater New York 2005, P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, Long Island City, NY ==References * Cordy Ryman interviewed by Phong Bui, Dec. 2008 * Cordy Ryman reviewed @ Brooklyn Rail * Cordy Ryman reviewed by Art in America * http://www.markmooregallery.com/artists/cordy-ryman/ Category:Artists from New York City Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Casualist artists ","title":"Cordy Ryman"},{"id":"20452688","text":"__NOTOC__  The Nieuport-Delage NiD 42 was a fighter aircraft built in France in the early 1920s, the first in a family of designs that would form the backbone of the French fighter force over the next decade.Taylor 1989, p. 698.The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft 1985, p. 2612. ==Design and development== As first built, the NiD 42 was a highly streamlined parasol-wing monoplane with a monocoque fuselage and an open cockpit of which a single prototype was built.

Retrieved: 16 September 2012. While the NiD 42S was achieving these distinctions, development continued on the fighter version. Nieuport-Delage designed two further such variants in 1924; a single-seater designated NiD 42 C.1 and a similar machine with a second cockpit for a tail gunner with a machine gun in a ring mount, designated the NiD 42 C.2. One of the latter was exhibited at that year's Salon de l'A√©ronautique, along with a NiD 42 C.1 nose section to illustrate an alternative engine mount.\\"The Paris Aero Show 1924\\" 1924, p. 774. These differed from the original NiD 42 fighter in having a second, small wing added to the lower fuselage, turning the parasol monoplane into a sesquiplane, a design feature adopted from the NiD 37 Hartmann 2006, p. 15. which would be a key identifying feature through most of the versions developed from the 42. Only two examples of the two-seater were built, but Nieuport-Delage entered the single-seater in the 1925 concours des monoplaces, a competition by the Army's Technical Service to find a replacement for the NiD 29. The NiD 42 was selected from a field of eleven competitors, and an order for 50 aircraft was placed, of which 25 were eventually delivered. Although impressive at the time it was designed, technology had already surpassed the NiD 42 when it entered service in 1928, particularly with regard to its wooden structure, and most of the development work associated with the design was made in an effort to cure it of a tendency to enter a flat spin. Nevertheless, it provided the foundation for further development as the NiD 52 and NiD 62.Taylor and Alexander 1969, p. 117. ==Variants== ; NiD 42: prototype single-seat parasol-wing monoplane fighter with Hispano-Suiza 12Hb (one built) ; NiD 42S: shoulder-wing monoplane racer with Hispano-Suiza 12Hb (two built) ; NiD 42 C.1:Nieuport Delage NiD 44 C.1 photo from L'A√©ronautique January,1926single-seat sesquiplane fighter with Hispano-Suiza 12Hb (27 built, mostly for French AF, includes two for the Turkish Air Force ; NiD 42 C.2: two-seat sesquiplane fighter with Hispano- Suiza 12Hb (two built) ; NiD 44 C.1: prototype sesquiplane fighter, powered by a Lorraine 12Ew W-12 engine, to test alternate engine (one built) ; NiD 46 C.1:Nieuport Delage NiD 46 C.1 photo from L'A√©ronautique January,1926prototype sesquiplane fighter with Hispano-Suiza 12Gb to test alternate engine (one built) ; NiD 52 C.1: version for Spanish Air Force with Hispano-Suiza 12Hb (126 built, including 125 under licence in Spain) ; NiD 62 C.1: production fighter version for French military with Hispano-Suiza 12Hb (322 built) ;; NiD 621 :: advanced trainer powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Hb (three built) ;; NiD 622 :: production fighter powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Hb (314 built) ;; NiD 623 :: speed record aircraft modified from 62 powered by a Lorraine 12Fd Courlis W-12 engine, (one built) ;; NiD 624 :: experimental altitude aircraft powered by a Lorraine 12Fd Courlis W-12 engine, (one built) ;; NiD 626 :: variant for Peru with Lorraine 12Hdr V-12 engine (12 built) ;; NiD 628 :: testbed for testing Farman turbocharger powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Mc (two built) ;; NiD 629 :: production fighter powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Mdsh (50 built for French) ; NiD 72 C.1 : metalized version for Belgium and Brazil powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Lb (16 built for Brazil and Belgium) ; NiD 82 C.1 : metalized prototype with Hispano-Suiza 12Lb and entirely new wing and tail (one built) ==Operators== ; * Belgian Air Force ; * Brazilian Air Force ; * A√©ronautique Militaire ** 2e R√©giment d'Aviation ** 3e R√©giment d'Aviation ** 38e R√©giment d'Aviation *French A√©ronavale ; *Peruvian Air Force ; * Spanish Republican Air Force * Aviaci√≥n Nacional ; *Turkish Air Force ==Specifications (NiD 42 C1)== Nieuport Delage NiD 42 C.1 3-view drawing from L'A√©ronautique August,1927 ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * Hartmann, G√©rard. \\"Les avions Nieuport-Delage.\\" La Coupe Schneider et hydravions anciens/Dossiers historiques hydravions et moteurs, 2006. * The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft (Part Work 1982-1985).

The band was started by Neeraj Shridhar, Oscar S√∂derberg, and Mats Nordenborg, and became popular with remixes of old Bollywood hits such as \\"Kya Soorat Hai\\", \\"Woh Chali\\" and \\"Chod Do Anchal\\". The group was popular both in the Indian subcontinent, as well as overseas among the Indian music community, due to its unusual combination of classic Bollywood style and European experimentation. It was the first group to sing in Hinglish, a mix of Hindi and English, a brainchild of its front-man, Neeraj Shridhar. == History  Formation === Bombay Vikings were formed in 1994 in Stockholm, Sweden. The three experienced musicians met when Mats introduced Neeraj Shridhar and Oscar Soderberg to each other. The band was born primarily due to a common interest of Indian melodies from sources such as Hindi films and classical music. Neeraj became the lead vocalist and back-up guitarist, and also composed pop rock, jazz, hip-hop, soul, and reggae songs. Mats played the saxophone; as a jazz specialist, he used this knowledge while composing for the new band. Mats and Johan Folke, keyboard specialists, used their years of exposure to the different genres of music on the synthesizer. They were soon joined by Morgan on the drums, Par on the bass, and Staffan as the lead guitarist. Bombay Vikings began performing live shows in Sweden and Norway. When all the musicians got together and began jamming, they didn't know they would be coming out with a new form of music, but they wanted to do something creative for India. The leader of Bombay Vikings, Neeraj Shridhar, is from Jalandhar in Punjab, India. He moved to Sweden when he was 13, where he developed his interest for music. He enjoyed listening to western and Indian classical songs. He formed Bombay Vikings in 1994 and performed at many places in Europe. The band mainly performed English songs with Neeraj adding an Indian influence. After a few years, most of the band members disbanded, but Neeraj chose to keep the name of the band and form another band with the remaining members. === Kya Soorat Hai (1999) === Neeraj produced his first album, Kya Soorat Hai, in 1999, after stopping the project for almost four years. Most of the Indian music companies didn't think the album would be too popular among the Indians due to its strong English and Western influence and demanded changes. Finally, Sony BMG agreed to produce the album in India without any changes. The album consisted of eight tracks, all of which were remakes of old Indian songs. Every song was recorded primarily in English, with two to three songs containing a few lines of Hindi. In spite of this, the album was a huge success in India and opened the doors for westernisation of music. The songs \\"Kya Soorat Hai\\", \\"Mona Re\\" and \\"Night Is So Perfect\\" were popular among teenagers. The video of the song \\"Kya Soorat Hai\\" starred South- Indian star Prabhu Deva's brother Raju Sundaram, and was a hit due to its hip- hop sound as well as its comical style. The song \\"Mona Re\\" was also made into a video. === Woh Chali (2000) === Soon after the success of their first album, Bombay Vikings recorded another successful album, Woh Chali, in 2000. The album contained four remakes of old songs and five original songs, in which Neeraj Shridhar, who wanted to be known as a modern music composer, attempted to silence the critics who said he simply \\"copy and pasted.\\" All of the songs on this album were hits, especially \\"Woh Chali\\", \\"Jambola\\", \\"Angel Eyes\\", and \\"Jump Up\\". \\"Angel Eyes\\" was also an international success. Singer Lata Mangeshkar was impressed with the remake of her song \\"Main Chali\\" from the film Padosan and invited Neeraj to perform at her birthday function. Three songs of the album were made into videos: \\"Woh Chali\\", \\"Jambola\\" and \\"Angel Eyes\\". === Hawa Mein Udata Jaaye and Best of === In 2002, Bombay Vikings released another album, Hawa Mein Udati Jaaye. This album again revived old songs in a modern way, making the youth admire the beauty of the old songs. This time, Neeraj worked with guest singers Linnea Spores and Falguni Pathak to produce songs. The videos of the songs \\"Hawa Mein Udati Jaaye\\" and \\"Tera Mera Pyaar Sanam\\" became hits. In the same year, the album The Best Of Bombay Vikings was released, with a playback song of the film \\"Rules: \\"Pyaar Ka Superhit Formula, in which Neeraj sang \\"Kabhi Phool Dena\\" for music director Sandesh Shandilya. === Chhodh Do Aanchal Zamana Kya Kahega and Fusion Remixes (2004) === In 2004, Bombay Vikings came up with Chhodh Do Aanchal Zamana Kya Kahega. The title track had the main lines sung again by Linea and was a hit along with its video, which was played on every music channel in India for almost a year. In the video of the song, many confuse a background dancer to be Priyanka Chopra, but in reality it is not her. The youthful songs \\"Ik Badal\\" and \\"Aa Raha Hoon Main\\" were \\"milestones\\", and the video of the song \\"Aa Raha Hoon Main\\" was a commercial hit. In the same year, Neeraj produced a single titled \\"Hum To Anything Karega', a remake of the song \\"Hum To Mohabbat Karega'. This song with Neeraj's previous few hits, and the songs of other artists such as Falguni Pathak, were released in the album Fusion Remixes. === Zara Nazron Se Kehdo (2006) === The success of the band continued when they released their most recent album, Zara Nazron Se Kehdo. The song Zara Nazron Se Kehdo produced by Soundism and its video, which starred Bollywood actress Celina Jaitly, was a hit. The song \\"Mere Dil Ne\\" was made into a video. After this album, Neeraj chose to take a short break which has become an extended break. Bombay Vikings has announced a forthcoming album entitled \\"U n I\\" but a release date has yet to be announced. Neeraj started working as a Bollywood playback singer in 2006, and has sung for many Bollywood films. ==Discography== * Kya Soorat Hai (1999) * Woh Chali (2001) * Hawa Mein Udati Jaaye (2002) * The Best of Bombay Vikings (2002) * Hum To Anything Karega: Fusion Remixes (2004) * Chhodh Do Aanchal (2004) * Zara Nazron Se Kehdo (2006) * U n I (2011) ==References * Neeraj Shridhar Official Site Category:Indian rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Sweden ","title":"Bombay Vikings"},{"id":"20452717","text":"Penn Cage is a fictional prosecutor turned writer created by author Greg Iles in his novel The Quiet Game (1999).

Her father was Mr Llewelyn Edmunds, the precentor at Bethel Chapel, Wilton Square, in Islington, London (a chapel built by Welsh Calvinistic Methodists in 1853, rebuilt 1884). Such Welsh Methodists had their origins in the religious revival of the eighteenth century, and had been influenced by George Whitfield and his patron, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon. After attending a school in London, Dilys Edmunds studied at the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth where she gained a bachelor of arts degree, followed by completion of a teachers' training course. Her teaching career began in London, but in 1914 as war broke out in Europe, she sailed to India, funded by of a Welsh missionary society, to teach at a secondary school in Silchar. Two years later she was offered a post in charge of the Girls' School at Karimganj. Whilst there she wrote numerous articles about the customs and culture of local people for the Welsh monthly periodical Y Cenhadwr Returning to Britain after the end of World War One, arriving towards the end of 1920 and staying for about a year, she raised funds in London and Wales for a building programme to provide residential hostels for Indian teachers, accommodation for school children in the Karimanj District, and to establish a 'School of Weaving' for the Girls' School at Karimganj.

He married Mar√≠a Eugenia Silva Fuentes and together they produced two children, Carlos Alberto (lawyer), and Ra√∫l Eduardo (neurosurgeon).

They held meetings in their house with folklorists from all the countries of Latin America where their music was sung. Persons sometimes referred to these meetings as a small O.A.S. In their productions they sang songs from all the Latin American countries, each interpreted with the instruments typical of each country. They used more than sixty different instruments played all by themselves. They also recorded songs from the north, center and south of Chile. Some of their published CDs include: Arreo en el Viento, Nostalgia Colchaguina, An image of Chile, Human Landscape of Chile, Latin American Folkloric Panorama (published in Mexico, 2 longplays), Los de Ram√≥n in Family and Chilean Mass, among others. Ra√∫l de Ram√≥n also helped with the formation of new Chilean folk music groups such as Los Cantores de Santa Cruz, Los de Santiago and others. His impact went beyond the music. He contributed towards the construction of Chilean houses and the introduction of a Chilean Mass. He even published, in France, the creation of a still unpublished musical comedy. He opened a restaurant, El Alero de los de Ram√≥n, where Chilean music was played and typical Chilean food was eaten. He was named \\"Illustrious Son of Santa Cruz\\" for his collaboration to this city and has, together with his family, a place at the Museum of Colchagua in this city. He died in April 1984 at 55 years of age. ==Works== With his family, he recorded more than thirteen long plays, two of them in Mexico, using his own creations and with compilations of folklore music from throughout Latin America. He also published some books on Chilean literature, including, El Caballero y sus Dragones a rural Chilean novel; Ra√≠ces en la Bruma, a poetry book, and Arreo en el Viento, a compilation of important parts of his musical work. ==Recordings== *Los de Ram√≥n (1960) *Fiesta Venezolana (1961) *Arreo en el Viento (1962) *Nostalgia Colchaguina (1963) *Una Imagen de Chile (1964) *Paisaje Humano de Chile (1966) *Panorama Folklorico Latinoamericano (2) (1966) *Los de Ram√≥n en Familia (1967) *El Arca de Los de Ram√≥n (1968) *Los de Ram√≥n en Am√©rica (1969) *Viento en el Tamarugal (1968) *Misa Chilena (1965) *Lo Mejor de Los de Ram√≥n (1979) ==ReferencesLyrics from various Los de Ram√≥n songs * Memoria chilena (English: \\"Chilean Memory\\") * Canal 13 * Passage by Raul de Ramon as quoted in Chile, Memorial de la tierra larga: Cr√≥nicas, a book written by Manuel Pe√±a Mu√±oz * Cancionero del Patagonia (English: \\"Songbook of Patagonia\\") Category:1929 births Category:1984 deaths Category:People from Santiago Category:Chilean composers Category:Chilean male composers Category:Chilean musicians Category:20th- century composers Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Ra√∫l de Ram√≥n"},{"id":"20452893","text":"The Karapiro Power Station is a hydroelectric power station on Waikato River, in the North Island of New Zealand. The power station lies on Lake Karapiro, a major rowing regatta venue. Karapiro is upstream from the city of Hamilton and is the last of the eight hydroelectric power stations on the Waikato River. Karapiro is a baseload power station, as it is required to maintain water flow in the lower Waikato River even during low inflows to the catchment and during low electricity demand. Only two turbines are required to keep the river flow at a reasonable level, with the third turbine being available for peak generation and maintenance on one of the other turbines. Like all of the hydroelectric power stations on the Waikato River, Karapiro is operated by electricity generator Mercury Energy. ==History== Karapiro was the second power station built in the Waikato hydro scheme, after Arapuni. Construction of the dam and power station began in 1940, but a materials and labour shortage due to World War II meant progress was slow. The station was completed in 1947, four years behind schedule. The creation of Lake Karapiro behind the dam flooded the Horahora Power Station, the first power station built on the Waikato River. The first generator was commissioned on 10 April 1947, just six days after Horahora was flooded. However, problems with the guide bearing meant full generation didn't start until 21 April 1947. The second generator was commissioned on 21 September 1947. In the first 12 months (to 31 March 1948), the station produced 349,568 megawatt-hours of electricity, just over 20 percent of the North Island's electricity requirements. The third and final generator was commissioned in May 1948. Aerial view of Karapiro Hydro Power Station, Waikato River, February 1969 The bridge over the spillway is the only road access to the turbine hall. The first bridge had a supporting column in the center of the bridge. The bridge was destroyed by the water running through the spillway in a significant flood event (Source: Mighty River Photo archives). The replacement bridge is as you see today with no supporting column. To the left of the four spillway gates are three siphon tubes. These were designed for the management of the lake level under normal river flow and the spillway gates were to be used in only extreme conditions. The design of the siphon tubes was faulty: The flow of water was supposed to be stopped by a blast of air, but this never worked properly - resulting in the spillway gates to be used for lake level control. ==Generation== The Dam's spillway. Karapiro's powerhouse is located on the northern bank of the river, with a diversion tunnel and spillway also on the northern bank. The river is dammed by a concrete arch dam south of the powerhouse, with the electricity substation on the southern bank of the river. Water from Lake Karapiro runs through the penstocks to three Kaplan turbines. Each turbine turns a generator, outputting 32 megawatts of electricity each at 11,000 volts. Around of water every second is required to run through the turbines to generate 1 MW of electricity. Karapiro is controlled remotely by Mercury Energy's Waikato River control room in Hamilton. ==Transmission== As part of the power station's construction, a 110,000-volt double-circuit line was built from the station to Hamilton substation. The line was commissioned on 29 March 1947. This line remains in service today as the main connection from Karapiro to the rest of the national grid. In addition, 110,000-volt single-circuit lines connect Karapiro with Te Awamutu and Hinuera substations. All the lines are now owned and operated by national grid operator Transpower. ==See also== *Electricity sector in New Zealand *List of power stations in New Zealand ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1948 Category:Hydroelectric power stations in New Zealand Category:Waikato River Category:Buildings and structures in Waikato Category:1940s architecture in New Zealand Category:Waipa District ","title":"Karapiro Power Station"},{"id":"20452901","text":"Bart Jason Moore-Gilbert (8 December 1952 - 2 December 2015) was a Tanzanian born British academic, orientalist and political campaigner, most widely known for his work in the field of postcolonial literary studies and theory. ==Education== Moore-Gilbert graduated from Durham University (Grey College) in 1975 with a first-class degree in English Language and Literature. ==Career== His work has been translated into fifteen languages.

The name \\"PICO\\" combines the first letters of all four of its experiments (see below). PICOSat series are designed for a minimum of one year of on-orbit operations. ==Background== The name Picosat was coined by Peter P. Vekinis and was used to describe a constellation of amateur radio satellites, called the Picosat System, first analog, then digital, that would offer instant emergency communications, worldwide, using cheap amateur radio transceivers. The details were presented at AMSAT's conference in Orlando, Florida, in 1995 and in Tucson, Arizona, in 1996. ==HistoryEarly versions=== Tethered Picosats, Picosat 5, Picosat 6, Picosat 7, and Picosat 8 are hectogram mass satellites that were ejected from OPAL (2000-004C). The primary builders were by engineering students at Santa Clara University in California. They used off- the-shelf components and miniature batteries, for technology tests. The Tethered Picosats were a pair of Picosats tethered together by a short wire, was ejected on February 8, 2000, from an OPAL Launch System.Stanford University: Opal Launch Vehicle Picosats 7 and 8 on launched on 11 February, and Picosats 5 and 6 launched on 12 February. Alternate common names were given by the investigators: Picosats 7 and 8 are the Thelma and Louise pair and Picosats 5 and 6 are the JAK and Stensat pair. The Tethered Picosats were functional for a short time after ejection, communicating with each other by microwatt radio transmitters. There was no indication if the Picosats (5, 6, 7,and 8) were operational at the time of ejection into orbit. USSPACECOM's Picosat numbers extending to eight is erroneous. There were only six Picosats on board the OPAL, with possibly one or two still on the ground, with tests to communicate with the orbiters. The tests were managed by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA).NASA:Master Catalog 2000-004H ===Current version=== The current Picosat 9 is a British-built (US DOD-funded) microsatellite (67 kg) to test electronic components/systems in space conditions. Oboard this model carries four test payloads: Polymer Battery Experiment (PBEX), Ionospheric Occultation Experiment (IOX), Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography (CERTO) and On Orbit Mission Control (OOMC) an ultra-quiet platform (OPPEX). PICOSat flies in an 800 km circular orbit with a 67 degree inclination. PICOSat uses a gravity gradient boom for stabilization. The body mounted solar panels produce an average on orbit power of 22 W. The Ultra-Quiet Platform (UQP), developed by the US Air Force Research Lab, aims to provide a 10:1 reduction in vibration isolation over a 100 Hz bandwidth between the spacecraft bus and a science payload.NASA: Master Catalog of satellites ==PicoSat specificationsPicoSat 1 & 2 (tethered)=== *NORAD ID: 26080 *Int'l Code: 2000-004H *Perigee: 741.4 km *Apogee: 788.1 km *Inclination: 100.2¬∞ *Period: 100.0 min *Launch date: January 27, 2000 *Source: United States (US)PicoSat Home Page *Launch vehicle: Minotaur *Launch site: Vandenberg Air Force Base.Stanford University: OPAL QuckFacts ===PicoSat 9=== *NORAD ID: 26930 *Int'l Code: 2001-043B *Perigee: 791.0 km *Apogee: 806.5 km *Inclination: 67.0¬∞ *Period: 100.7 min *Launch date: September 30, 2001 at 02:40:00 UTCNASA: PicoSAT 9 Mainpage *Source: United States (US) *Launch Vehicle: Athena I *Launch Site: Kodiak Launch Complex ===Identifications=== International designation numbers with USSPACECOM Catalog numbers are in parentheses:NASA: SpaceWarn Bulletin 556 *2000-004H (26080) Picosat 1/2 *2000-004J (26091) Picosat 5 *2000-004K (26092) Picosat 6 *2000-004L (26093) Picosat 7 *2000-004M (26094) Picosat 8 *2001-043B (26930) Picosat 9 ==See also== * DRAGONSat * CubeSat *Los Angeles AFB ==ReferencesFurther reading== *DoD experiments launch aboard Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-126) *EOportal: PICOSat (STP P97-1) in-depth project review(Now a secure site, accessed tried: 15 Dec 2011) Category:Satellites orbiting Earth Category:Satellite meteorology Category:Picosatellites ","title":"PicoSAT"},{"id":"20452950","text":"The English Cross Country Association (ECCA) is the governing body of cross country running in England.

The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 16, 2006. ==History== The house was built in 1750; there was an addition added in the 1820s. The house may have been the site of a meeting between George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette in 1779.Harriet Phillips Eaton, Jersey City And Its Historic Sites, 1899: On August 24th, 1779, General Lafayette and his troops marched on a foraging expedition from near Fort Lee to Bergen. On the morning of the 25th they arrived at the brow of the Hill and encamped about the large, old tulip tree, known as \\"oude Boom\\" to the early settlers and as the \\"King of the Woods\\" to those of later date. The locality is now known as Waldo avenue, between Henry street and Magnolia avenue. The tree was cut down December 20th, 1871 Lafayette's headquarters were at the Van Wagenen place on the northwest corner of Academy street and Bergen square. Mr. Taylor states, \\"in the orchard on the old parsonage site on northwest side of Square,\\" where he entertained at dinner General Washington who came over from Hackensack. The dinner was cooked in the Van Wagenen weave-house and eaten under an apple tree. This tree was blown down in a gale on September 3d, 1821, and from a portion of it was made a very handsome cane, gold mounted and with this inscription, \\"Shaded the hero and his friend Washington in 1779; presented by the Corporation of Bergen in 1824.\\" When Lafayette visited America in 1824, when he was on his way from Jersey City to Newark, there was a gathering of all the people of this vicinity to meet him at Riker's Tavern, Five Corners, which is still standing on the southwest corner of Newark and Summit avenues. Upon this occasion Domine Cornelison presented him with the cane, making a very appropriate address. The name Apple Tree House is given to the home because of a former apple orchard and cider press that were located on the property. The house was purchased by the Quinn family and used as a funeral parlor for a number of years. In 1996, the house was on Preservation New Jersey's 10 Most Endangered Historic Sites list. The city of Jersey City purchased the building in 1999 for $450,000 and has been working to improve the condition of the building. The New Jersey Historic Trust gave Jersey City a grant in 2006 for interior restoration and accessibility improvements. Jersey City plans to use the house as a museum. Interior renovations were completed in 2014. An annual wreath-laying ceremony occurs at the house every President's Day that is hosted by the George Washington Society. ==Gallery== File:Van Wagenen House2.jpgSide view File:Van Wagenen House3.jpgRear view File:Van Wagenen House4.jpgFirst-floor hallway File:Van Wagenen House5.jpgFront parlor ==See also== * Newkirk House * Van Vorst House * List of the oldest buildings in New Jersey * National Register of Historic Places listings in Hudson County, New Jersey ==References * The Van Wagenen Family Website * Jersey City Past and Present * View of Van Wagenen House via Google Street View * https://books.google.nl/books?id=YV_1DQAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=New+Jersey%27s+Colonial+Architecture+Told+in+100+Buildings&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwj8yoXO2e_WAhWCaVAKHdnqBTcQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q;=New%20Jersey%27s%20Colonial%20Architecture%20Told%20in%20100%20Buildings&f;=false Category:Houses in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Category:History of Jersey City, New Jersey Category:Buildings and structures in Jersey City, New Jersey Category:Houses completed in 1740 Category:Stone houses in New Jersey Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:New Jersey Register of Historic Places ","title":"Van Wagenen House"},{"id":"20452997","text":"Neeraj Shridhar (born 1978) is an Indian film composer and singer-songwriter who was the lead vocalist of Indian pop and rock group Bombay Vikings. Bombay Vikings became popular with remix hits like \\"Kya Soorat Hai\\", \\"Woh Chali\\" and \\"Chod Do Anchal.\\" ==Early life== Neeraj Shridhar hails from Jalandhar, India. ==CareerBombay Vikings=== Bombay Vikings is a pop and rock group that combines Indian and classical music. It was formed in 1994. The band was originally started by Neeraj Shridhar. The group caused a sensation in India as well as overseas among the Indian music community due to its unusual combination of classical Bollywood style. It has been one of the most notable musical groups in India to emerge in the past decade. It is the first group to produce songs in Hinglish, i.e., a mix of Hindi and English. This idea of combining the two languages to produce a beautiful and melodious song first came to Neeraj Shridhar. Shridhar is now playback singer for many Bollywood films and has delivered many hits in recent years. Neeraj enjoyed listening to both western and Indian classical songs. \\"Bombay Vikings\\" performed at many places in Europe. The band mainly performed English songs with Neeraj adding a strong Indian influence. After some years, most of the band members separated, but Neeraj chose to keep the name of the band for forming another band with the remaining members, but this time, he was ready to perform in India. ===Career=== Neeraj started working as a Bollywood playback singer in 2006 with the song \\"Tumko Dekha\\" for the film God Tussi Great Ho starring Salman Khan and Priyanka Chopra, although this film got released later. In the year 2006 his songs \\"Halke Halke\\" in Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. and \\"Bhagam Bhaag\\" from Bhagam Bhaag were huge hits, which opened all the doors for him to be successful in Bollywood as well. The video of the song \\"Bhagam Bhaag\\" was the most expensive Bollywood video produced. After this, Neeraj tasted a huge amount of continuous success in Bollywood. Right from the beginning of 2007, he delivered hits like \\"Ticket To Hollywood\\" (Jhoom Barabar Jhoom), \\"Heyy Babyy\\" (Heyy Babyy), \\"Ishq Subhanallah\\" (Mere Baap Pehle Aap), \\"Ishq Ka Kalma\\" (Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal), and the biggest of them all \\"Bhool Bhulaiyaa\\" (Bhool Bhulaiyaa), commonly known as \\"Hare Raam Hare Raam.\\" This Akshay Kumar star song was the biggest hit of the year and was nominated for the Filmfare Awards with the songs \\"Ticket To Hollywood\\" and \\"Heyy Baby.\\" Neeraj also co-wrote the song \\"Bhool Bhulaiya\\" with Sameer. Success continued when Neeraj gave hit after hit. Soon he gained the experience of working with almost all the main Bollywood music directors. Till date he has worked with Sajid-Wajid, Salim- Sulaiman, Pritam, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, Vishal-Shekhar, Nadeem-Shravan, Anu Malik, Sandesh Shandilya, Aashish Pandit, and many more. He has mostly worked with Pritam. Although he has never worked with Salim-Sulaiman on a Bollywood song, he worked with them for the song of the famous television reality show Khatron Ke Khiladi, the Indian version of Fear Factor. ===Success in Bollywood=== In 2008, Neeraj had all of his songs superhits. He sang the following songs for their respective films: 'Race Saanson Ki', 'Race Is On My Mind' and 'Sexy Lady' (Race), 'Chandni Chowk To China' (Chandni Chowk To China), 'Love Mera Hit', and 'Rockin' And Reelin' (Billu), 'Vacancy' and 'Tha Karke' (Golmaal Returns), 'Aai Paapi' (Kismat Konnection), 'O Re Lakad' (Krazzy 4), 'Nobody Like You' (Mission Istanbul), 'Bas Ek King' and 'Talli Hua' (Singh Is Kinng), 'Sooni Sooni Raahein' and 'Main Ro Na Padoon' (Hum Phir Mile Na Mile), 'Pom Pom Pom' (Horn OK PLeasss), 'Samandar' (Mr. White Mr. Black), 'Khalbali' and 'Bhuri Bhuri' (Khalbali). This year he sang for a number of Bollywood actors, such as Saif Ali Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Ajay Devgn, and Shahid Kapur. Neeraj sang a Telugu song called 'Om Namaste Bolo' from the film Ready, starring Genelia D'Souza. Neeraj wrote and sang the songs 'Ae Aa o' (Billu), 'Vacancy' (Golmaal Returns), and 'Aayaare' (Kolkata Knight Riders- 2 Hot 2 Cool). Neeraj sang songs like ' Pal Yeh Aane Wala Pal' (Dhoondte Reh Jaaoge), 'Aaja Mahi' (8 x 10 Tasveer), Prem Ki Naiyya' (Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani), 'You Are My Love' (All The Best), 'Bebo' and 'Beautiful Woman' (Do Knot Disturb), 'Tension Lene Ka Nahi' (Jugaad), 'Jashn Hai Josh Hai' (Kal Kissne Dekha), 'Lakh Lakh Nakhre' (Kambakkht Ishq), 'Twist', 'Chor Bazari', and 'Aahun Aahun' (Love Aaj Kal), 'Tum Mile' (Tum Mile), 'Shiri Farhad' (Dulha Mil Gaya), 'Pe Pe Pein' (Chance Pe Dance). In the year 2010, Neeraj slowed down on working on Bollywood songs, due to his involvement in his own album.

E. W. Mason, the first to feature his character Inspector Hanaud. The story became Mason's most successful novel of his lifetime. It was adapted by him as a stage play in 1920, and was used as the basis for four film adaptions between 1920 and 1940. ==Plot summary== Inspector Hanaud, the well-known French detective, is on holiday in Aix les Bains when he is asked by a young Englishman, Harry Wethermill, to investigate the murder of a wealthy widow, Mme Dauvray. Mme Dauvray has been strangled and her valuable jewels, which she wore ‚Äòwith too little prudence‚Äô, are missing. Her maid H√©l√®ne Vauquier has been discovered upstairs, unconscious, chloroformed, and with her hands tied behind her back. Suspicion immediately falls on Mme Dauvray‚Äôs young English companion, Celia Harland, who has vanished. Celia is in love with Wethermill, and the latter pleads with Hanaud to take on the case in the unshakeable conviction that in spite of appearances Celia is innocent of the crime. Hanaud agrees to do so. Mme Dauvray had been fascinated by spiritualism and part of Celia‚Äôs role as companion had been to stage s√©ances for her and, as a supposed medium, to conjure up manifestations from the spirit world - which she did by acting and trickery. Hanaud discovers that she was to have conducted a s√©ance on the night of the murder. Ad√®le Tac√© (who calls herself Mme Rossignol) is a practised criminal who has come to Aix specifically to steal Mme Dauvray‚Äôs jewels. In league with H√©l√®ne Vauquier, she professes disbelief in spiritualism and goads the old lady into holding a s√©ance in which Celia will be expected to perform while bound hand and foot. To avoid being exposed as a fraud to Mme Dauvray and to her lover Harry, Celia agrees to co-operate, believing she can quite easily extricate herself. On the night, however, she is bound far more professionally and tightly than she had anticipated and, when unexpectedly secured to a pillar and gagged, realises that she is a prisoner. Seeing a man stealing in at the french window and recognising Harry Wethermill, Celia rejoices and expects release. But all he does is to check that her bonds are tight. Celia is unable to escape or to cry out as he strangles Mme Dauvray. Wethermill, H√©l√®ne and Ad√®le search without success for the jewels, and are forced to suspend their efforts when they hear footsteps outside. H√©l√®ne voluntarily allows herself to be chloroformed, to avoid suspicion falling on her. Celia, meanwhile, is abducted and taken to Geneva, being kept alive solely so that she can tell the gang where the jewels are hidden. When the newspapers report that the missing jewels have been found by the police, the gang have no further use for Celia and they prepare to drug her and dispose of her body in the lake. Hanauld arrives just in time.Cover of first Canadian edition ==Background== Mason left a fairly extensive account of the novel's genesis. Visiting a hotel in Richmond, Mason's attention was drawn to two names that had been scratched by a diamond ring in a window pane: Madame Foug√®re, a wealthy woman who had been murdered the year before at Aix les Bains, and that of her maid who had been found bound and chloroformed in her bed. He looked up the French newspapers and read the accounts of the real- life trial, keeping them tucked away in his mind for future use. The character of Celia came from a recollection of a conjurer and his daughter whom Mason had seen once or twice in provincial concert-rooms. A detail in the novel which fixes the time of the murder ‚Äì a passing policeman closes a door and later finds it standing open again ‚Äì came from a murder trial that Mason had attended at the Old Bailey. He recorded that the story, \\"detective and all, rolled itself out\\" over the course of two or three evenings while he dined in a restaurant in Geneva, overlooking the lake. ==Critical reception== On its publication in book form in 1910 the novel received a warm reception, and it achieved a circulation greater than any other of Mason's novels. According to The British Weekly, it was \\"one of the best, most artistic, most engrossing detective stories ever written\\", with other papers also echoing its praise. In 1940 Hugh Walpole called it \\"The best detective novel of the last thirty years\\". Writing in 2017, Martin Edwards called At the Villa Rose ‚Äúa landmark of the genre‚Äù in which real-life source material is blended with phoney spiritualism, baffling but logical detective work, and an unexpected villain. Its main flaw, he thought, is a lopsided story structure in which the murderer is revealed part way through the book, with the later chapters amounting to an extended flashback. ==AdaptationsRadio=== In July 1926 the novel became the first to be transmitted over the air as a BBC serial. Mason himself presented an introductory talk on the book's genesis, then read it (in abbreviated form) over five succeeding nights. ===Stage=== Mason's stage version of the novel, also called At the Villa Rose, opened at the Strand Theatre, London, on 10 July 1920, with Arthur Bourchier in the role of Hanaud, Kyrle Bellew as Celia [sic] and Harcourt Williams as Wethermill. The play was unusual in that the identity of the murderer is revealed from the start but with the tension maintained until the end. The play was a success and became the most financially satisfactory of any that Mason wrote. ===Film=== The novel has been adapted four times for the screen: * At the Villa Rose (silent, 1920) * At the Villa Rose (1930) * Le myst√®re de la villa rose [The Mystery of the Villa Rose] (in French, 1930) * At the Villa Rose (1940) ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Bargainnier, Earl F.

He studied classical piano at The Royal Conservatory of Music. He is a multiple Maple Blues Award winner as Piano/Keyboardist of the year and a Juno Award winner with the Downchild Blues Band. His distinguished musical career was so honoured by the Maple Blues Awards as early as 2000 and a Juno Award in 2014. == Biography == Fonfara's career as a professional musician commenced in 1963, when he started playing in the Toronto band, Lee Jackson & The Checkmates in 1963, which evolved into Jon and Lee & The Checkmates soon afterwards. Members of Jon and Lee & The Checkmates ultimately formed the nucleus of the later bands Rhinoceros and Blackstone, plus contributed significantly to the work of Lou Reed in the 1970s. When John and Lee & The Checkmates broke up in September 1967, Fonfara worked briefly with David Clayton-Thomas and then, during the months of November and December, 1967, toured and recorded with The Electric Flag, featuring Buddy Miles and Michael Bloomfield. Fonfara replaced keyboardist and founding Electric Flag member Barry Goldberg.Fonfara played with the band at the famous Fillmore West and Winterland ballrooms, both owned by Bill Graham, and recorded with the band in Los Angeles, having relocated from New York to do so. He was fired by the group's manager, Albert Grossman, following a drug arrest at the Tropicana Hotel in Los Angeles. See David Dann, An American Music Band: Mike Bloomfield's Electric Flag at p. 2; www.mikebloomfieldamericanmusic.com. It was at the same Tropicana Hotel that Fonfara encountered ex-Checkmates John Finley and Peter Hodgson, who encouraged him to audition for Rhinoceros. See Rhinoceros. He was then selected by producer Paul Rothchild as a member of the Elektra Records' hand- picked, \\"supergroup\\", Rhinoceros, in December 1967. Fonfara was the co-writer of the band's major hit, \\"Apricot Brandy\\", and recorded three albums with the group. Upon the dissolution of Rhinoceros in 1971, Fonfara joined with ex- Rhinoceros bandmates John Finley, Danny Weis, Larry Leishman and Peter Hodgson to form the group Blackstone. The band recorded one album in 1972, On The Line, again produced by Paul Rothchild, prior to splintering and then breaking up in 1973.The Canadian Pop Encyclopedia, Biography of Blackstone; www.jam.canoe.ca. Fonfara thereafter commenced working with Lou Reed, an association that continued throughout the balance of the 1970s. Fonfara caught Reed's attention for his work on The Everly Brothers' 1974 album Stories We Could Tell. In 1976, Fonfara was a member of controversial Toronto-based band Rough Trade, acting as keyboard player and arranger on their first album. He left the band at the end of 1977 in a dispute over payment for his work on Rough Trade's live revue show Restless Underwear. During the latter part of the 1970s and continuing to 1981, he was a member of the pop rock group Tycoon, based in New York City, which recorded two albums. He also played as a session musician on \\"Urgent\\" by Foreigner, a single that reached #4 in the US and #1 in Canada; the single's parent album Foreigner 4 hit number 1 on Billboard and was certified 6x platinum. In the 1980s, Fonfara returned to Toronto, where he became a key member of the Canadian R&B; band The Lincolns. The Lincolns had been founded by Prakash John, with whom Fonfara had first played in a later version of Blackstone in 1973The Canadian Pop Encyclopedia, Biography of Blackstone; www.jam.canoe.ca. and, thereafter, when both were playing and recording with Lou Reed, during the balance of the 1970s. Fonfara continues to play with The Lincolns, while remaining a member of The Downchild Blues Band, which he joined in 1990. In 2000, 2004, 2007 and 2009, he was the recipient of the Maple Blues Award, as piano/keyboard player of the year.

White, Farm Equipment of the Roman World (Cambridge University Press, 1975), p. 176.. is a squat, rounded pot or jar. An olla would be used primarily to cook or store food, hence the word ‚Äúolla\\" is still used in some Romance languages for either a cooking pot or a dish in the sense of cuisine. In the typology of ancient Roman pottery, the olla is a vessel distinguished by its rounded ‚Äúbelly,‚Äù typically with no or small handles or at times with volutes at the lip, and made within a Roman sphere of influence; the term olla may also be used for EtruscanW.J. Gill and Rosalyn Gee, ‚ÄúMuseum Supplement: Classical Antiquities in Swansea,‚Äù Journal of Hellenic Studies 116 (1996), p. 258 and plate III. and Gallic examples, or Greek pottery found in an Italian setting. In ancient Roman religion, ollae (plural) have ritual use and significance, including as cinerary urns.Entry on ‚Äúolla,‚Äù Oxford Latin Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1982, 1985 printing), p. 1246; David Noy, ‚Äú‚ÄòHalf-Burnt on an Emergency Pyre‚Äô: Roman Cremations Which Went Wrong,‚Äù Greece & Rome 47 (2000), p. 186. In the study of Gallo-Roman art and culture, an olla is the small pot carried by Sucellus, by the mallet god often identified with him, or by other gods. ==Cookery== Ollae of varying shapes in a reconstruction of a Roman kitchen; top shelf, and on the rack over the fire Olla is a generic word for a cooking pot, such as would be used for vegetables, porridge, pulse and such.White, Farm Equipment, p. 176. The 1st- century BC scholar Varro gives an \\"absurd\\" etymologyWhite, Farm Equipment, p. 178. that derives the word for vegetables, olera or holera, from olla; although as a matter of scientific linguistics the derivation may be incorrect, it indicates that cookery was considered essential to the pot's function.Varro, De lingua latina 5.108. Isidore of Seville said that the word olla derived from ebullit, \\"it boils up,\\" and describes a patera as an olla with the sides flattened out more broadly.Isidore, Etymologiae 20.8.1. It was a word of ordinary usage, and does not appear in literary works by Vergil, Horace, and Ovid. Unlike the aenum or cauldron, which hung over the fire from chains, the olla had a flat bottom for resting on a hot surface, though it might also be placed directly on logs or coals in rustic cookery.White, Farm Equipment, p. 178, citing Martial. The kitchen reconstructed at the House of the Vettii from Pompeii shows a large olla set on a tripod on the stove.White, Farm Equipment, p. 179. ==Funerary use== Ollae were used for funerary purposes from earliest times. In Italic inhumations, ollae might be placed with the body in the tomb as grave goods, sometimes with a ladle or dipper.Helle W. Horsnaes, The Cultural Development in Northwestern Lucania c. 600‚Äì274 BC (¬´L'Erma¬ª di Bretschneider, 2002), pp. 67‚Äì68, 89, 95, 148, 173. A tomb from a 7th-century BC necropolis at Civita Castellana yielded an olla decorated with a pair of horses and a Faliscan inscription.Gabriel C.L.M. Bakkum, The Latin Dialect of the Ager Faliscus (Amsterdam University Press, 2009), p. 414. From the 3rd century BC (Mid-Republic) into the 2nd century AD of the Imperial era, cremation was the most characteristic means of disposing of a body among the Romans. Ollae shifted function to hold cremated remains for entombment, a practice of Etruscan as well as Italic burials.Giovannangelo Camporeale, The Etruscans Outside Etruria (Arsenale-EBS, 2001), pp. 162‚Äì163, 197. The remains of those of modest means might be contained in earthenware ollae placed on the shelves of an ollarium or columbarium.White, Farm Equipment, p. 179. ==Sacrificial use== After the performance of an animal sacrifice, a designated portion of the entrails (exta) was placed either in an olla and boiled, or in oldest times on a spit and roasted,Robert Schilling, \\"Roman Sacrifice,\\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 79. as part of the \\"cuisine\\" of sacrifice. The exta were the victim's liver, gall, lungs, and the membrane covering the intestines, with the heart added after 275 BC.Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2001, originally published in French 1998), p. 9. The olla was one of the characteristic implements of sacrifice, and appears in reliefs as such, particularly in the Gallic provinces.Duncan Fishwick, Imperial Cult in the Latin West (Brill, 1990), vol. II.1, p. 527. The vessel is mentioned, for instance, in Livy's account of a sign (prodigium) that manifested divine displeasure: the official presiding over the sacrifice himself poured the cooking liquid out of the olla in order to inspect the remaining entrails, which were intact except for the mysteriously liquified liver.Livy, 41.15. ===Arval Brethren=== Ollae figured in the rituals of the Arval Brethren, the \\"Brothers of the Fields\\" who constituted a college of priests dating from Rome's archaic period. The exta of the victims used in their sacrifices were placed in an olla and cooked.Schilling, \\"Roman Sacrifice,\\" p. 79. Examples of these earthenware pots have been uncovered by archaeologists in the sacred groves of the Arvals. Their rudimentary technique suggests the great antiquity of the religious traditions associated with them.Schilling, \\"The Arval Brethren,\\" p. 113. After conducting their rites, the Arval priests opened the door to the temple, and cast the ollae down the slope leading up to it.William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People, (London, 1922), p. 489. ==Silvanus and the Mallet God== Gallic mallet god with olla, perhaps Sucellus The name of the woodland god Silvanus appears in inscriptions within the province of Gallia Narbonensis with representations of a mallet, an olla, or both. The mallet is not a regular attribute of Silvanus, and may be borrowed from the Celtic mallet god sometimes identified with Sucellus.Peter F. Dorcey, The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion (Brill, 1992), pp. 57‚Äì59. ==See also== * Olla * Ancient Roman pottery ==References== Category:Ancient Roman pottery ","title":"Olla (Roman pot)"},{"id":"20453493","text":"Tommy Fitzsimmons (born 21 October 1870) was a Scottish footballer.

In the same month, it was also on PBS as a series in two parts. It tells the story of a group of strangers whose lives intertwine following a devastating car crash. The crash opens a number of startling revelations as stories of everything from government cover-ups and smuggling, to embezzlement and murder start to unravel. The series is open-ended, with a number of unresolved issues; moreover, the story is ostensibly resolved in a metafictional manner with a flashback to an incident in the service station and the swatting of a wasp, which precipitates the initial crash, thus allowing the characters to continue on their journeys. The wasp as a motif and theme is frequently in evidence throughout the series. The original British broadcast of Collision was edited from the original 5 hours (shown in five parts) down to three and a half hours (210 minutes, shown in two parts). The American broadcast on PBS's Masterpiece Contemporary, the Australian broadcast on ABC1 and the Region 1 (America and Canada) DVD release all featured the shortened version.

In their 1999 paper, Gilles Brassard, Richard Cleve and Alain Tapp demonstrated that quantum pseudo-telepathy allows players in some games to achieve outcomes that would otherwise only be possible if participants were allowed to communicate during the game. This phenomenon came to be referred to as quantum pseudo-telepathy, with the prefix pseudo referring to the fact that quantum pseudo-telepathy does not involve the exchange of information between any parties. Instead, quantum pseudo-telepathy removes the need for parties to exchange information in some circumstances. By removing the need to engage in communication to achieve mutually advantageous outcomes in some circumstances, quantum pseudo-telepathy could be useful if some participants in a game were separated by many light years, meaning that communication between them would take many years. This would be an example of a macroscopic implication of quantum non-locality. Quantum pseudo-telepathy is generally used as a thought experiment to demonstrate the non-local characteristics of quantum mechanics. However, quantum pseudo-telepathy is a real-world phenomenon which can be verified experimentally. It is thus an especially striking example of an experimental confirmation of Bell inequality violations. == Games of asymmetric information == A Bayesian game is a game in which both players have imperfect information regarding the value of certain parameters. In a Bayesian game it is sometimes the case that for at least some players, the highest expected payoff achievable in a Nash equilibrium is lower than that which could have been achieved had there not have been imperfect information. Asymmetric information is a special case of imperfect information, in which different players differ in terms of the knowledge they possess regarding the value of certain parameters. A common assumption in classical Bayesian games of asymmetric information is that all players are unaware of the values of certain crucial parameters before the game begins. Once the game begins, different players receive information regarding the value of different parameters. However, once the game begins, players are forbidden to communicate and are consequently unable to exchange the information they collectively possess regarding the game's parameters. This assumption has a crucial implication: even if players are able to communicate and discuss strategies before the game begins, this will not enhance any player's expected payoff, because the crucial information regarding unknown parameters has not yet been 'revealed' to the game's participants. However, if the game were to be modified, so that players were permitted to communicate after the game has begun, once each player has received some information regarding the value of some of the unknown parameters, then it may be possible for the game's participants to achieve a Nash equilibrium which is Pareto optimal to any Nash equilibrium achievable in the absence of communication. The crucial implication of quantum telepathy is that although communication before a Bayesian game of asymmetric information begins does not result in improved equilibrium payoffs, it can be proven that in some Bayesian games, allowing players to exchange entangled qubits before the game begins can allow players to achieve a Nash equilibrium which would only otherwise be achievable if in-game communication were permitted. ==The Mermin‚ÄìPeres magic square game== When attempting to construct a 3√ó3 table filled with the numbers +1 and ‚àí1, such that each row has an even number of negative entries and each column an odd number of negative entries, a conflict is bound to emerge. An example of quantum pseudo-telepathy can be observed in the Mermin‚ÄìPeres magic square game. This game features two players, Alice and Bob. At the very start of the game, Alice and Bob are separated. After they are separated, communication between them is not possible. The game requires that Alice fill in one row, and Bob one column, of a 3x3 table with plus and minus signs. Before the game begins, Alice does not know which row of the table she will be required to fill in. Similarly, Bob does not know which column he will be required to fill in. After the two players are separated, Alice is randomly assigned one row of the table and asked to fill it with plus and minus signs. Similarly, Bob is randomly assigned one column of the table and asked to fill it with plus and minus signs. The players are subject to the following requirement: Alice must fill in her row such that there is an even number of minus signs in that row. Furthermore, Bob must fill in his column such that there is an odd number of minus signs in that column. Crucially, Alice does not know which column Bob has been asked to fill in. Similarly, Bob does not know which row Alice has been asked to fill in. Thus, this game is a Bayesian game with asymmetric imperfect information, since neither player has complete information about the game (imperfect information) and both players differ in terms of the information that they do possess (asymmetric information). Depending on the actions taken by participants, one of two outcomes can occur in this game. Either both players win, or both players lose. If Alice and Bob place the same sign in the cell shared by their row and column, they win the game. If they place opposite signs, they lose the game. Note that both players place all their plus and minus signs simultaneously, and neither player can see where the other player has placed their signs until the game is finished. It is easy to prove that in the classic formulation of this game, there is no strategy (Nash equilibrium or otherwise) which allows the players to win the game with probability greater than 8/9. If Alice and Bob meet before the game begins and exchange information, this will not impact the game in any way; the best the players can do is still win with probability 8/9. The reason why the game can only be won with probability 8/9 is that a perfectly consistent table does not exist: it would be self-contradictory, with the sum of the minus signs in the table being even based on row sums, and being odd when using column sums, or vice versa. As a further illustration, if they use the partial table shown in the diagram (supplemented by a ‚àí1 for Alice and a +1 for Bob in the missing square) and the challenge rows and columns are selected at random, they will win 8/9 of the time. No classical strategy exists which can beat this victory rate (with random row and column selection). If the game was modified to allow Alice and Bob to communicate after they discover which row/column they have been assigned, then there will exist a set of strategies allowing both players to win the game with probability 1. However, if quantum pseudo-telepathy were used, then Alice and Bob could both win the game without communicating. ===Pseudo-telepathic strategies=== Use of quantum pseudo-telepathy would enable Alice and Bob to win the game 100% of the time without any communication once the game has begun. This requires Alice and Bob to possess two pairs of particles with entangled states. These particles must have been prepared before the start of the game. One particle of each pair is held by Alice and the other by Bob. When Alice and Bob learn which column and row they must fill, each uses that information to select which measurements they should make to their particles. The result of the measurements will appear to each of them to be random (and the observed partial probability distribution of either particle will be independent of the measurement performed by the other party), so no real \\"communication\\" takes place. However, the process of measuring the particles imposes sufficient structure on the joint probability distribution of the results of the measurement such that if Alice and Bob choose their actions based on the results of their measurement, then there will exist a set of strategies and measurements allowing the game to be won with probability 1. Note that Alice and Bob could be light years apart from one another, and the entangled particles will still enable them to coordinate their actions sufficiently well to win the game with certainty. Each round of this game uses up one entangled state. Playing N rounds requires that N entangled states (2N independent Bell pairs, see below) be shared in advance. This is because each round needs 2-bits of information to be measured (the third entry is determined by the first two, so measuring it isn't necessary), which destroys the entanglement. There is no way to reuse old measurements from earlier games. The trick is for Alice and Bob to share an entangled quantum state and to use specific measurements on their components of the entangled state to derive the table entries. A suitable correlated state consists of an entangled pair of Bell states: : \\\\left\\\\varphi\\\\right\\\\rang = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\bigg(\\\\left+\\\\right\\\\rang_a \\\\otimes \\\\left+\\\\right\\\\rang_b + \\\\left-\\\\right\\\\rang_a \\\\otimes \\\\left-\\\\right\\\\rang_b \\\\bigg) \\\\otimes \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\bigg(\\\\left+\\\\right\\\\rang_c \\\\otimes \\\\left+\\\\right\\\\rang_d + \\\\left-\\\\right\\\\rang_c \\\\otimes \\\\left-\\\\right\\\\rang_d \\\\bigg) here \\\\left+\\\\right\\\\rang and \\\\left-\\\\right\\\\rang are eigenstates of the Pauli operator Sz with eigenvalues +1 and ‚àí1, respectively, whilst the subscripts a, b, c, and d identify the components of each Bell state, with a and c going to Alice, and b and d going to Bob. The symbol \\\\otimes represents a tensor product. Observables for these components can be written as products of the Pauli spin matrices: : S_x = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} , S_y = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\\\\\\\\\ i & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} , S_z = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} Products of these Pauli spin operators can be used to fill the 3√ó3 table such that each row and each column contains a mutually commuting set of observables with eigenvalues +1 and ‚àí1, and with the product of the observables in each row being the identity operator, and the product of observables in each column equating to minus the identity operator. This is a so-called Mermin-Peres magic square. It is shown in below table. {  style=\\"text- align:center; border;1px\\" - style=\\"height:80px\\"  +I \\\\otimes S_z  +S_z \\\\otimes I  +S_z \\\\otimes S_z - style=\\"height:80px\\"  +S_x \\\\otimes I  +I \\\\otimes S_x  +S_x \\\\otimes S_x - style=\\"height:80px\\"  -S_x \\\\otimes S_z  -S_z \\\\otimes S_x  +S_y \\\\otimes S_y - } Effectively, while it is not possible to construct a 3√ó3 table with entries +1 and ‚àí1 such that the product of the elements in each row equals +1 and the product of elements in each column equals ‚àí1, it is possible to do so with the richer algebraic structure based on spin matrices. The play proceeds by having each player make one measurement on their part of the entangled state per round of play. Each of Alice's measurements will give her the values for a row, and each of Bob's measurements will give him the values for a column. It is possible to do that because all observables in a given row or column commute, so there exists a basis in which they can be measured simultaneously. For Alice's first row she needs to measure both her particles in the S_z basis, for the second row she needs to measure them in the S_x basis, and for the third row she needs to measure them in an entangled basis. For Bob's first column he needs to measure his first particle in the S_x basis and the second in the S_z basis, for second column he needs to measure his first particle in the S_z basis and the second in the S_x basis, and for his third column he needs to measure both his particles in a different entangled basis, the Bell basis. As long as the table above is used, the measurement results are guaranteed to always multiply out to +1 for Alice, and ‚àí1 for Bob, thus winning the round. Of course, each new round requires a new entangled state, as different rows and columns are not compatible with each other. ===Coordination games=== In classical non- cooperative game theory a coordination game is any game with multiple Nash equilibria. The literature regarding pseudo-telepathy occasionally refers to games such as the Mermin‚ÄìPeres game as coordination games. On one hand, this is technically correct, because the classic variant of the Mermin‚ÄìPeres game does feature multiple Nash equilibria. However, quantum pseudo-telepathy does not provide any solution to the coordination problems which characterize coordination games. Quantum pseudo-telepathy's utility lies in resolving problems with asymmetric information in Bayesian games where communication is prohibited. For example, implementing pseudo-telepathic strategies in the Mermin‚ÄìPeres game can remove the need of Bob and Alice to exchange information. However, pseudo-telepathic strategies do not resolve coordination problems. Specifically, even after implementing pseudo-telepathic strategies, Bob and Alice will only win the game with probability one if they both coordinate their pseudo-telepathic strategies in a manner isomorphic to that described above. ==Current research== It has been demonstrated that the above- described game is the simplest two-player game of its type in which quantum pseudo-telepathy allows a win with probability one. Other games in which quantum pseudo-telepathy occurs have been studied, including larger magic square games, graph colouring games giving rise to the notion of quantum chromatic number, and multiplayer games involving more than two participants. Recent studies tackle the question of the robustness of the effect against noise due to imperfect measurements on the coherent quantum state. Recent work has shown an exponential enhancement in the communication cost of nonlinear distributed computation, due to entanglement, when the communication channel itself is restricted to be linear. ==See also== *Quantum refereed game *GHZ state ‚Äì an entangled 3-particle state. *EPR paradox *Kochen‚ÄìSpecker theorem *Quantum information science *Qubit *Tsirelson's bound *Wheeler‚ÄìFeynman absorber theory ==Notes * Understanding and simulating quantum pseudo-telepathy * Quantum Pseudo-Telepathy Category:Concepts in physics Category:Quantum information science Category:Quantum measurement Category:Quantum mechanics Category:Thought experiments in quantum mechanics Category:Game theory ","title":"Quantum pseudo-telepathy"},{"id":"20453673","text":"The Shelbourne Irish Open was a tennis tournament held in Dublin, Ireland between 2006 and 2008.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 19, 2008. This is the last episode of South Park to be broadcast in 480i standard definition. The episode was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode spoofs vampire films including the Twilight craze and The Lost Boys, where Butters believes that he sees vampires in the school. ==Plot== Butters Stotch mistakes older students following the vampire craze for actual vampires and tries to raise the alarm. Eric Cartman suggests that he go \\"document the vampires\\" simply to get rid of him. Taking Cartman's words literally, Butters sneaks into the school gym and hides to record the members of the South Park Vampires' Club on his dictaphone. One of the vampires talks about vampire- related customs and they \\"feed\\" by drinking Clamato juice. However, Butters' dictaphone malfunctions, exposing him in front of the vampires. Butters attempts to repel them with a crucifix before running away. Butters goes home, only to have his father, Stephen yell at him due to the fact that the food pantry is not organized and he found hamburger helper in his glass of milk. Stephen, without listening to anything Butters is saying, argues that \\"the only thing that keeps a family together is an organized pantry\\" and threatens to ground Butters. After being threatened to be grounded by his parents, Butters thinks aloud, concluding that nobody listens to him. Having come to believe that if he becomes a vampire he will no longer get victimized, he asks the vampire kids to let him join them. They take him to Hot Topic and change his appearance to match theirs. Butters returns home to his parents, who are angry at him because of his lateness and his dyed hair. Butters responds that he is now \\"ungroundable\\" and hisses at his parents, thus completely shocking them. Shortly after, Butters starts wasting away because he believes he is a real vampire and can only feed on blood. He sneaks into Cartman's room in the middle of the night in a failed attempt to \\"feed,\\" only managing to give Cartman a Love-bite. Butters' parents, alerted by Cartman's mother, ask him if he \\"got gay with one of his schoolmates [that] night\\". Stephen attempts to confine Butters to his bedroom, but he simply leaps out of the window. Throughout this episode, the school's Goth kids loathe the vampire kids with whom they keep getting confused by everyone, including Principal Victoria. Reluctantly, they decide to switch to a casual look to clear the confusion, but change their mind when they hear someone from the school soccer team describing them as \\"that fat girl, the big nose kid, the midget and the kid with pock marks on his face\\", which had caused them to become Goths in the first place. After discussing what they could do to stop the vampire craze, the Goth kids decide to get rid of \\"the head vampire\\", fifth grade student Mike Makowski, whom they kidnap and mail to Scottsdale. This however fails to solve the problem and just when the Goth kids are about to face defeat from the vampire kids, Butters informs them that Hot Topic is the source of the vampire craze. He takes them there and they burn down the store. At home, Butters tells his parents that the Goth kids burnt down the Hot Topic and thus has now \\"reverted\\" back to human and he becomes \\"groundable\\" once more, much to this parents' relief. In the end, the Goth kids ask for a school assembly in order to explain to everyone the differences between Goth kids and \\"douchebag vampire wanna-be boner\\" kids, exclaiming, \\"Because anyone who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded.\\" They receive a standing ovation, with the eldest Goth kid closing their speech with, \\"Fuck all of you\\" and flipping everyone off. ==Production== The initial idea for \\"The Ungroundable\\" was created the week before production, when the team at South Park Studios was working on \\"Elementary School Musical\\". In that episode, Parker had planned to have the school children simply move on to the next fad, which would have been the Twilight Saga film series. Twilight had opened in theaters several weeks before and was a phenomenon among tweens and teens, and Parker and Stone realized parodying it would be stronger material for a full episode, rather than a throwaway joke. In addition, they found that a reaction from the Goth kids to everyone suddenly dressing their style would be a \\"big emotional thing\\" for the characters, and decided to save it. \\"The Ungroundable\\" was the last of a series of seven episodes produced in the latter half of 2008, during a run that Parker described as \\"tough.\\" Like many South Park episodes, much of the storyline was crafted one week prior during a Thursday writer's meeting. The Goth kids first appeared in the season seven episode \\"Raisins\\" (2003), and had made appearances in the ensuing years; Parker went back and watched the episode to reacquaint himself with the characters. He noted that while that particular episode mocked Goth kids, later portrayals, such as those in \\"The Ungroundable\\", were more sympathetic, with both Parker and Stone calling the Goth kids some of their favorite characters in the series. Parker, in the episode's DVD commentary, related a story from not long after the episode's broadcast, in which he was approached by a \\"Goth\\" woman at a bar in Nashville, Tennessee following a Tennessee Titans game, who thanked him for writing an episode about the supposed differences between the subcultures. ==Reception== Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode a 7.4/10 rating, saying \\"[w]hile there are lots of funny bits in this episode, it's far from a home run. It's clever, and well put together and makes a few good points ‚Äì but it's just not as laugh out loud funny as you'd expect South Park to be. [...] Nonetheless, what often makes South Park work are the little moments, the vocal tics of the characters and so forth. I imagine \\"per se\\" will catch on, if only for a little bit, as the pseudo- intellectual affectation of vamp-douche-ese. While \\"The Ungroundable\\" isn't a home run in terms of laughs, given the current Twilight craze, the show continues to serve as a satirical chronicle of our times, which makes even a middling episode an argument for South Park's continual longevity.\\" ==Home release== \\"The Ungroundable\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's twelfth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two- disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 10, 2009. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and two special mini-features, The Making of 'Major Boobage and Six Days to South Park. The episode was also released on the two-disc DVD collection A Little Box of Butters. ==References * \\"The Ungroundable\\" Full episode at South Park Studios * \\"The Ungroundable\\" Episode guide at South Park Studios * * Category:Arson in fiction Category:Goth subculture Category:Gothic television shows Category:South Park (season 12) episodes Category:Vampires in animated television Category:Television episodes about child abduction Category:Television episodes about crime ","title":"The Ungroundable"},{"id":"20453799","text":"Antoni Jurasz (1847‚Äì1923) Antoni Stanis≈Çaw Jurasz (24 November 1847 - 12 August 1923) was a Polish laryngologist who was a native of Sp≈Çawie (Posen).

The government survived all of these votes. Rutherford largely placated the legislature by appointing a royal commission to investigate the affai. But pressure from Lieutenant-Governor George Bulyea and unrest within his own caucus forced Rutherford's resignation and his replacement by Arthur Sifton. The royal commission gave its report months after Rutherford resigned. The majority on the commission did not find Rutherford or his cabinet guilty of any wrongdoing, but criticized them for poor judgment, both in relation to the loan guarantees and in relation to the exemptions the A&GW; received from provincial legislation. A minority report was more sympathetic, and declared the allegations against them \\"disproved\\". James Cornwall, a Liberal backbencher who supported Rutherford, fared somewhat worse: his personal financial involvement in the railway gave rise to \\"suspicious circumstances\\", but he too was not proven guilty of any wrongdoing. Besides provoking Rutherford's resignation, the scandal opened rifts in the Liberal Party that took years to heal. Sifton eventually smoothed over most of these divisions, but was frustrated in his railway policy by legal defeats. He ultimately adopted a similar policy to Rutherford's, and the A&GW; was eventually built by private interests using the money raised from provincial loan guarantees. Sifton's Liberals went on to be re-elected in 1913 and 1917. ==Background== Alberta's first years as a province were optimistic ones. This optimism manifested itself in a desire for railroads. The public, media, and politicians all called for the rapid development of new lines and expansion of existing ones.Thomas 59 Rutherford's Liberals had set up a framework that allowed almost anybody to enter the railroad business, but few firms had done so by 1909.Thomas 58‚Äì59 The opposition Conservatives called for the government's direct entry into the industry.Thomas 60 Rutherford's government instead opted for a regime of loan guarantees: the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) had their bonds, which were to pay 4% per year over their thirty-year term, guaranteed at a rate of $13,000 per mile of railway constructed. The legislature had the right to increase this to $15,000. In exchange, the railways were subject to a minimum rate of line construction: the CNR was required to build and the Grand Trunk Railway before the end of 1909. Besides the established companies, guarantees were also offered to new companies. One company to take advantage of this was the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway, which was founded by two Kansas City bankers, William R. Clarke and Bertrand R. Clarke, and a Winnipeg accountant, William Bain. The company proposed to build a \\"line from Edmonton north- easterly to a point at or near the west end of Lac la Biche, thence to a point at or near Fort McMurray.\\"Thomas 61 Guarantees to the so-called \\"A&GW;\\" were more generous than to the established companies: $20,000 per mile for and $400,000 for its Edmonton terminal. The bonds also paid better interest (5%) over a longer term (fifty years) than those of the established companies. Upon the bonds' sale, the money was to be placed in a bank account controlled by the government, and paid to the railway as the line was constructed.Thomas 62 ==The scandal== The Rutherford government had just been resoundingly re- elected in the 1909 provincial election, winning 36 of the legislature's 41 seats, when the new legislature first met in February 1910. There was initially no sign of controversy in relation to the A&GW; Railway: William Clarke, A&GW; President, had several months earlier announced that the line would be completed by the end of 1912, ahead of schedule.Thomas 69 When the A&GW; bonds went on sale in London in November 1909, the issue was oversubscribed. The following month, the contract for ties was awarded.Thomas 70 Everything seemed to be progressing as planned when, at the beginning of the new legislative session, Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle asked the government a series of innocuous questions about the company and the guarantees made to it. Rutherford, Minister of Railways as well as Premier, responded to the questions in writing.Thomas 70‚Äì71 Before he did so, however, a rumour began to circulate that William Henry Cushing, Minister of Public Works, had resigned from the cabinet.Babcock 59 Boyle and Conservative leader R. B. Bennett questioned Rutherford about the rumours, but Rutherford initially refused to make any announcement. The next day, however, the rumour was confirmed when the Premier read Cushing's letter of resignation in the legislature. In this letter, Cushing gave his reasons for resigning as disagreement with the government's railway policy, which he claimed was developed without his involvement or consent. Rutherford disagreed with this claim, and expressed his regret for Cushing's resignation.Thomas 71 ===J. R. Boyle's resolution=== On February 21, Boyle gave notice of a resolution to expropriate the rights of the A&GW; and build the line directly. He asserted that the government had guaranteed to the A&GW; more than was necessary, as a line of , barely two thirds what had been guaranteed, was sufficient. The next day, Boyle further alleged that Deputy Attorney-General S. B. Woods had tampered with the government's files on the A&GW; before Boyle and Bennett had viewed them. Attorney-General Charles Wilson Cross strongly disputed this allegation. John R. Boyle took an early stand against his own leader and tried to bring down Rutherford's government over the scandal.Debate on Boyle's resolution began February 25, in front of a full public gallery. Cushing opened debate. He explained that the cabinet's original intention had been for $20,000 per mile to be the maximum guarantee, with less promised for more easily built portions of the line.Thomas 72 He claimed that he had taken ill at a time that this understanding was still in place, only to have Rutherford move responsibility for railways from Cushing's Public Works department to a new Railways department, headed by Rutherford himself.Thomas 72‚Äì73 He recounted his discomfort with Rutherford's refusal to consult with Public Works engineers on the actual costs of constructing the line, and his relief at Rutherford's assurance that Cushing himself would be consulted. He claimed that Rutherford had not followed-through on this pledge, and that, upon seeing the completed agreement between the A&GW; and the government, Cushing had decided to resign.Thomas 73 Rutherford disputed this version of events, noted that Cushing had been at all relevant cabinet meetings, and cited the report of government engineer R. W. Jones in disputing that the line could be constructed for less than $20,000 per mile.Thomas 73‚Äì74 Boyle followed, alleging that Rutherford had privately committed the government to the $20,000 figure as early as November 14, 1908, before a government engineer had even been appointed. He also accused the government of negligence in failing to verify the paid in capital of the A&GW; before committing $7.4 million of government loan guarantees to it. He closed by repeating his demand that the government expropriate the company's rights and build the line itself.Thomas 74 Cross rebutted for the government, questioning Cushing's sincerity and quoting a March 1909 speech in which the then-Minister of Public Works had defended the government's railway policy against Bennett's attacks. Cross also reminded the legislature that no money was to be paid to the A&GW; until tracks were actually constructed. R. B. Bennett led the tiny Conservative opposition during the scandal.On February 28 Liberal member and Cushing-ally Ezra Riley proposed an amendment to Boyle's resolution, striking out the proposals to expropriate and substituting a statement that \\"the contract and agreement entered into between the Government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company are not such as to commend them to the judgment and confidence of this house\\". The same day, an amendment to this amendment was moved by Liberal John William Woolf and seconded by Liberal John Alexander McDougall. Woolf and McDougall proposed redrafting the agreement along the lines proposed by A&GW; President Clarke in a letter to Rutherford. This letter suggested that the A&GW; should offer to the government its construction equipment and other assets in guarantee of its construction pledges. Though John A. McDougall seconded an amendment considered friendly to the government, he would prove not to be its ally.The Woolf-McDougall amendment was considered friendly to the government, but Rutherford was not yet in the clear.Thomas 75 Independent Edward Michener attacked the government for receiving only par value for the bonds when they had been sold at ten percent above par.Thomas 76 McDougall voiced his support for Michener's argument; though McDougall had seconded Woolf's pro-government amendment, it became apparent that his reasons for doing so were less support for the government than a principled aversion to the province using its law-making power to extricate itself from inconvenient contracts.Thomas 76‚Äì77 Opposition to the government came to a head March 2 when Conservative leader Bennett first spoke.Thomas 77 Bennett was renowned as one of the province's finest orators, and his five-hour speech earned plaudits even from the Liberal Edmonton Bulletin, which praised its \\"splendor in diction [and] the physical endurance of the orator\\" and called it a \\"high water mark for parliamentary debate in Alberta\\".Thomas 77‚Äì78 Bennett lashed out at the government's handling of the A&GW; file, accusing it of culpable negligence in failing to properly oversee the company's activities. He claimed to have been approached directly by \\"great financial interests\\" intent on preventing his participation in the debate. He argued that the discrepancy in the sale price of the bonds and what the government had received for them meant that Clarke and his associates had realized a profit of between $200,000 and $300,000 at the government's expense.Thomas 78 He closed with an accusation that Cross had sent an emissary to a telephone company that wanted to install an automatic telephone system in Calgary agreeing to reverse his opposition to the deal in exchange for a $12,000 contribution to Cross's campaign fund. These charges, corroborated by Cushing but hotly denied by Cross, were not related to the A&GW; affair, but were designed to damage the credibility of the government's de facto house leader on the eve of the vote on the Woolf-McDougall amendment.Thomas 79 The government side adopted similar tactics: Agriculture Minister Duncan Marshall accused Boyle of being motivated by bitterness over having been denied the solicitorship of the A&GW; Boyle admitted that he had applied for this position, but denied an accusation from Peace River MLA James Cornwall that he had requested Cornwall's assistance in lobbying for it.Thomas 79‚Äì80 The Woolf-McDougall amendment came to a vote the evening of March 3. In a victory for the government, the amendment passed twenty-three votes to fifteen.Thomas 71 In addition to Michener and the legislature's two Conservatives, the amendment was opposed by twelve of the legislature's thirty-seven Liberals, including Cushing.Babcock 60 Charles M. O'Brien, the legislature's lone Socialist representative, voted with the government.Thomas 80 ===Cabinet confusion=== William Henry Cushing (bottom left) and Charles Wilson Cross (top right), though both Liberal members of the provincial cabinet, found themselves on opposite sides of the Alberta and Great Waterways debate.On March 9, Cross suddenly resigned. His resignation was quickly followed by that of Woods, his deputy. The next day William Ashbury Buchanan, Minister without Portfolio, did the same; though he had voted on the government's side on the Woolf-McDougall motion, he harboured considerable doubts about the government's railway policy. Rumours circulated that Agriculture Minister Marshall and Minister without Portfolio Prosper-Edmond Lessard had also resigned, though these proved false. Buchanan, Marshall, Lessard, and Rutherford made no comment on the situation to either the press or the legislature, but Cross was more forthcoming: he said that Rutherford had told him that Cushing had been asked to re-enter cabinet and had accepted, leading Cross to conclude that, in light of his public conflict with Cushing, he \\"could not, under the circumstances, remain a member of the Alberta government.\\" (Woods, who as a deputy minister did not sit in the legislature, denied that his resignation had any political motivation at all; he said that he had received an employment offer carrying three times his current salary.) Cushing also made public statements and, as usual, his were not in line with Cross's. While acknowledging that Rutherford had invited him to rejoin the cabinet, he claimed that the Premier had offered Cross's resignation as one of the terms for Cushing's re-entry. He further denied that he had ever accepted Rutherford's offer, both because of persisting conflict between him and the Premier and because his re-entry was unanimously opposed by his fellow dissident Liberals.Thomas 82‚Äì83 He directly accused Cross of having fabricated his claim that Rutherford had told him that Cushing had agreed to re-enter cabinet.Thomas 83 Rutherford held his silence until March 11, when he told the legislature that he had not accepted any resignations. He said that the only vacant cabinet post was the ministry of Public Works previously held by Cushing, and that he hoped to fill it soon. In the meantime, he intended to continue governing. While he eventually acknowledged Buchanan's resignation March 14, Cross remained in cabinet. ===Further manoeuvring in the legislature=== Following the passage of the Woolf-McDougall motion, the government took the offensive. On March 9, Rutherford gave notice of a resolution to strike a provincial railway board, with a membership of Rutherford, Deputy Public Works Minister John Stocks, and provincial railway engineer R. W. Jones.Thomas 81 The board would have the power to discharge any government responsibility under the Alberta Railway Act.Thomas 81‚Äì82 Stocks, however, publicly repudiated the resolution, and announced that he would have nothing to do with it.Thomas 82 On March 11, government supporter Charles Stewart attempted to disclose a scandalous rumour about Boyle in the legislature, but was ruled out of order by Speaker Charles W. Fisher. The allegation was quickly printed in the Edmonton Bulletin instead: Boyle, who expected to be named Attorney-General in the event that Cushing formed a government, was accused of approaching Lucien Boudreau and Robert L. Shaw, two government supporters who were hoteliers in their extra-legislative careers, and offering them immunity from prosecution for liquor license violations in exchange for their support of the insurgency. That same day, Riley and Boyle moved a motion of no confidence in the government. It was defeated by a margin of twenty to seventeen. Ominously for Rutherford, two hitherto loyal Liberals, Buchanan and Henry William McKenney, switched their support to the rebels. More favourably, the ill member for Macleod, Colin Genge, was rumoured to be recovering from his illness and soon on his way to Edmonton, where he was expected to support the government (in fact, Genge would die without ever taking his seat).Thomas 93 The government was also encouraged by the motion of dissident George P. Smith to strike an apolitical commission to supervise the construction of the A&GW;, since it corresponded closely to its own proposal to appoint a royal commission. Rutherford gave notice of a resolution to strike this royal commission, to be composed of three judges of the provincial supreme court, March 14. After one final attempt by the rebels to defeat the government legislatively (which failed by three votes), the resolution to strike the royal commission passed the legislature unanimously the next day.Thomas 85 The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal was, for the time being, out of the legislature's hands. ==AftermathThe commission's inquiry=== The commission first met in Edmonton March 29.Thomas 86 The three commissioners‚ÄîJustices David Lynch Scott, Horace Harvey, and Nicholas BeckThomas 84‚Äîwere joined by counsel for the insurgents (including Bennett himself), Cross, Rutherford, the A&GW;, and Cornwall (who had been accused of using his involvement with the Athabasca Railway for personal benefit during the scandal). The evidence they heard was reported in great detail by Alberta's press, to the initial interest of the public. Before long, however, the details grew tedious, and the public became less engaged. The greatest surprise to emerge during the commission's inquiry did not come from one of the forty-six witnesses to testify, but from one who did not: A&GW; President Clarke moved back to the United States, and did not return for his scheduled testimony. While this disappearance did not prove the government's guilt, in the eyes of the press it did prove Clarke's. As the Edmonton Journal put it, the only question left to answer was \\"were the members of the government simple innocents whom Clarke worked through their credulity or were they in on it with him?\\" ===George Bulyea's role=== Though he had appointed him Premier in 1905, George Bulyea was not an admirer of Rutherford's.Though it was George Bulyea, Alberta's first lieutenant governor, who had invited Rutherford to form the province's first government in 1905, the Premier never fully enjoyed Bulyea's confidence. Bulyea preferred several other candidates to Rutherford, including federal Member of Parliament (MP) Peter Talbot,Babcock 23 but when these proved unwilling he acquiesced with Rutherford, the choice of Alberta Liberals.Thomas 19 Now, with Rutherford reeling, Bulyea saw his initial doubts validated and began the search for potential successors. The obvious choice was Cushing, but Bulyea felt little enthusiasm for him, doubting his political acumenThomas 87 (in this opinion he was supported by other Liberal Party luminaries, including Frank Oliver, federal Minister of the Interior and proprietor of the Bulletin). He continued to prefer Talbot, but found that the insurgent Liberals, who favoured Cushing, would not accept him. Oliver was also a possibility, but he had no interest in leaving Ottawa. Talbot suggested Arthur Sifton, the province's chief justice. Sifton was a Liberal, but as a judge he was remote from political mudslinging. However, he had been offered the office of Premier in 1905, when it had seemed more desirable than it did now; would he have any interest?Thomas 88 The question was answered May 26, when the legislature reconvened. Bulyea entered the house and announced that he had accepted Rutherford's resignation and that he had asked Sifton to form a government. Sifton had accepted.Thomas 89 The arrangement had nearly fallen apart at the last moment: MLAs loyal to Cross indicated on May 25 that they would accept Sifton only if Cross remained the Attorney-General, which Sifton refused. It appeared for a time that Rutherford would not resign; after considering the matter overnight, Bulyea decided the morning of May 26 that he was in a position to force the Premier's hand, but it proved unnecessary when Rutherford stepped down of his own volition. ===The commission's report=== The commission reported to the legislature November 10, 1910.Babcock 62 Its findings were split into two reports: a majority report from Justices Scott and Harvey, and a minority report from Justice Beck.Thomas 97 The majority report traced the origins of the A&GW; scandal to 1905, when a number of Albertans, including James Cornwall, were federally incorporated as the Athabasca Railway Company, chartered to construct a railway from Edmonton to Fort McMurray. The legal work for the incorporation had been done by the law firm of Charles Wilson Cross, Cornwall's close friend and personal solicitor. In October 1906 Cornwall sold the ARC's charter to a syndicate of Winnipegers for $2,500 and a one-sixth share in the syndicate. The syndicate costed out the construction of the railway, and found that cost per mile would be $13,700 from Edmonton to Lac la Biche, and one thousand dollars per mile more from Lac la Biche to Fort McMurray. It decided to undertake the venture if it could get a loan guarantee of $13,000 per mile from the Alberta government.Thomas 98 At the end of 1906, syndicate members visited Alberta, where Cornwall introduced them to members of the cabinet. Negotiations between the syndicate and the government continued for several years. During this time, new construction estimates prepared by the syndicate placed the cost of the railway at between eighteen and twenty thousand dollars per mile. February 2, 1907, Cornwall entered into an agreement with the syndicate whereby he would receive $544,000 in stock in the resulting railway company if he could secure the necessary loan guarantees; this amount was later changed to $100,000. James Cornwall was not formally found guilty of wrongdoing, but a shadow continued to hang over him. At the beginning of 1908, Clarke appeared on the scene, and eventually acquired the syndicate's full interest in the railway, including a purchase of Cornwall's interest for $14,500 (of an agreed-upon $25,000). Shortly thereafter, Clarke met with members of cabinet in Calgary; Cushing asserted that he had not been present for this meeting, while Rutherford insisted that he had been. While no formal guarantee was made at this meeting, Clarke left it confident that he would receive the necessary loan guarantee, and proceeded with construction plans. He obtained new cost estimates for the railroad of $27,000 per mile, though Clarke's engineer confidentially advised him that it could be built for half this amount. By November 14, 1908, the cabinet, led by Rutherford and Cross, had agreed to the $20,000 per mile guarantee.Thomas 99 The majority report was critical of Rutherford and Cross for this, and also for setting the bonds' interest rate at 5 percent rather than 4 percent. The stated reason for this discrepancy was that the proposed railroad was likely to be difficult and expensive to build, crossing hundreds of miles of wilderness; in response, the report pointed out that the provincial guarantee of $20,000 per mile took this difficulty into account, and that there was thus no need for a higher interest rate to lure investors.Thomas 100 The majority report also took a dim view of the exemptions from the province's railway legislation that were built into the A&GW;'s charter: unlike the province's other railways, the A&GW; was not required to have directors resident in Alberta and was exempt from the requirement that railway companies not commence business until 25% of their capital was subscribed and 10% paid up. The A&GW; was held to a figure of less than 1% for both, and even this requirement was met in an unusual manner: Clarke brought his personal account into overdraft to issue a $50,000 cheque to the company, thereby allowing the latter to meet its capital requirements and commence operations. The company then authorized a payment of the same amount to Clarke on account of expenses incurred by him on behalf of the company; he used this payment to clear his overdraft.Thomas 102 The majority declined to find Rutherford and Cross guilty of any wrongdoing beyond poor judgment, though its findings were hardly flattering: \\"As there is room for doubt that the inference of personal interest is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the circumstances related, and in view of the positive denial, it can only be said that, in the opinion of your commissioners, the evidence does not warrant the finding that there was or is any personal interest on the part of Dr. Rutherford or Mr. Cross\\".Thomas 104 Its findings with regards to Cornwall were similar: his receipt of $14,500 and his expectation of $10,500 more constituted \\"suspicious circumstances\\", but these \\"point to no definite conclusion; and he has denied that he received any other benefit, or was interested in any other way in the enterprise, and it must be held that the evidence does not establish the contrary.\\" Justice Beck's minority report was more sympathetic to all three men. Beck declared himself perfectly satisfied that Cushing, despite his protestations to the contrary, had been aware of all details of the negotiations. While acknowledging that \\"in some instances the wisdom of their course may be doubtful\\", he accepted Rutherford's and Cross's explanations for their actions and labelled the accusations against them \\"disproved\\". He felt similarly about Cornwall, concluding that by the time he was using his position to advocate for the construction of the A&GW;, he was free of any pecuniary interest in it.Thomas 105 ===Long-term effects=== Sifton was selected Premier in an effort to restore party unity, and his first cabinet reflected that. There were three ministers in addition to Sifton. Charles R. Mitchell had been, like Sifton, a judge during the scandal, and was therefore unattached to either side.Thomas 90 Duncan Marshall had been a Rutherford cabinet minister, but not one identified strongly with its railway policy. Archibald J. McLean had voted with the rebels, but not been a leader among them.Thomas 91 The cabinet thus included members of both factions, but none of those who inspired such strong opinions as to be overly divisive.Thomas 90‚Äì91 Arthur Sifton's ascendancy to the premiership was intended to provide a break from Rutherford's scandal-ridden government and smooth over divisions within the Liberal Party.In late 1910, the new government introduced legislation to revoke the A&GW;'s charter and confiscate the proceeds from the sale of bonds, which were still held by the province. In introducing the bill, Sifton made no commitment as to what would be done with the funds once confiscated.Thomas 110 Many northern MLAs, including Cornwall and Cross, suspected that the Premier's plans for the money did not include construction of a northern railway, and opposed the bill on that basis.Thomas 110‚Äì111 Clarke re-surfaced in Winnipeg to deny Sifton's charge that the A&GW; had defaulted on any of its obligations,Thomas 111 and Conservative leader Bennett opposed the confiscation out of stated respect for private property: \\"Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States I do not think it will allow this province to take his property 'without due process of law'.\\" The government won the vote 25 to 14.Thomas 112 Once the legislation was signed into law by Bulyea, the government immediately wrote cheques drawing on the bond money. The Royal, Dominion, and Union banks, where the funds were deposited, refused payment. The government sued, and the provincial supreme court ruled in its favour in 1912.Thomas 113 The Royal Bank subsequently requested that the federal government use its power of disallowance to invalidate the legislation and appealed the supreme court's decision to the British privy council, at the time Canada's highest court of appeal.Thomas 121 While the federal government declined to act, in 1913 the privy council found that the provincial legislature did not have the authority to confiscate money that had been raised from investors from outside of the province.Thomas 127‚Äì129 In its objective of smoothing over Liberal divisions, Sifton's succession was only partially successful. Rutherford himself became increasingly distant from the party, and sought re-election in the next election as an independent Liberal, opposed to Sifton's government. In fact, he offered to campaign for the Conservatives across the province if they would agree not to run a candidate against him in his own riding; the Conservatives declined his offer, and Rutherford was defeated.Babcock 70‚Äì73 He would go on to campaign for the Conservatives in the 1921 election.Roome 14 On the other side, Ezra Riley, a leader of the insurgency, resigned his seat in protest of Cushing's exclusion from the new administration; he was defeated in the ensuing by-election by a pro-Sifton candidate.Thomas 92‚Äì94 It is possible that supporters of Cross would have taken a similar tack, but Sifton brought him back into cabinet before the next election.Thomas 125 With the noisiest dissidents neutralized, the Liberals enjoyed a period relatively free of intra-party strife, until the Conscription Crisis of 1917 once again split the party. ==NotesReferences== * * * ==External links== * Category:1910 in Canada Category:Alberta political scandals Category:Rail transport in Alberta Category:1910 in Alberta ","title":"Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal"},{"id":"20453884","text":"Judy Weiss (born 31 May 1972 in Berlin) is a German singer who became internationally renowned after singing \\"Vivo per Lei\\" with Andrea Bocelli in a German-Italian duet in 1996; while Weiss sang in German, Bocelli sang in Italian.

He appeared at the Bayreuth Festival in 1963 as Loge in Rheingold and he was noted as a dramatic tenor in German, French, and Italian repertoire in opera houses in England, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, and Australia. His operatic career lasted 38 years, followed by ten years as lecturer in Voice and Opera Studies at the Richard Strauss Conservatorium in Munich. ==Biography== Ken Neate was born in Cessnock, New South Wales on 28 July 1914. He studied piano and voice in Newcastle and had further study in Sydney with Lute Drummond and Lionello Cecil. Neate joined the New South Wales Police Force, serving in inner-city stations in Sydney. He became a soloist in the NSW Police Choir and soon became known as \\"The Singing Policeman\\". NOTE: This obituary erroneously refers to Charles Kullman as Chester Kallman. He sang his first operatic roles as Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly in Brisbane in 1937 and the title role in a concert performance of Lohengrin with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Joseph Post. After hearing Neate sing in 1939, John Brownlee introduced him to the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, and recommended he study with his own teacher, Emilio de Gogorza, and with Elisabeth Schumann. In 1941, he toured New Zealand with Oscar Natzka. That year, he studied roles such as Don Jos√© (Carmen) with Brownlee, and Lohengrin with Lotte Lehmann. He auditioned for Bruno Walter, which led to his becoming understudy to Charles Kullman for The Magic Flute at the Met. In 1941, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, becoming a pilot officer. He had already appeared in opera and concert under the direction of Sir Thomas Beecham in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. After the war, he appeared as Don Jos√© in Carmen at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1947 in the very first performance by the Covent Garden Opera Company (later to become the Royal Opera); that season, he also appeared as Tamino in The Magic Flute, and as the Italian Singer in Der Rosenkavalier. That year he sang the title role in Gounod's Faust for the first time (he was to sing the role over 80 times until 1965, in Europe, the UK and Australia). In 1948 he sang Alfredo in La traviata opposite Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. In 1950 and 1951, Ken Neate sang the roles of Rodolfo (La boh√®me), Cavaradossi (Tosca), and Pinkerton (Madama Butterfly) in productions televised by the BBC. He often appeared with his fellow Australian Rosina Raisbeck at Covent Garden. He made the first of five tours to Australia in 1952. He returned in 1955 (when he appeared with an Italian touring company alongside singers such as Gabriella Tucci and the up-and-coming Donald Smith), 1960, 1968 and 1970 (that year as Florestan in Fidelio). In May 1956 at Bordeaux, Neate created the title role in Henri Tomasi's Sampiero Corso, which was repeated at the Holland Festival in June. That year, Neate sang in the first television recordings for Italian Radio and Television of La fanciulla del West, Turandot and Alfredo Catalani's Loreley. Neate's lyric tenor had developed into a heldentenor by the end of the 1950s. He sang Tannh√§user over 160 times in German. In Germany he met and married the German mezzo-soprano Gertrud Vollath. He also sang Stolzing in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg (Vienna State Opera and Zurich Opera), Eric, Lohengrin and Siegmund (Die Walk√ºre). At the Bayreuth Festival of 1963 he sang the role of Loge in Das Rheingold, at the invitation of Wolfgang Wagner and Rudolf Kempe, becoming the first Australian to sing a major role at Bayreuth. He studied heldentenor roles with Max Lorenz. In Italy in the mid-1950s, he had a major career in the houses of San Carlo (Naples), La Fenice (Venice), Parma and Bologna, in roles such as Faust, Calaf (Turandot) and Don Carlo, and appearing with such major names as Tullio Serafin, Carlo Tagliabue, Cesare Siepi, Ettore Bastianini, Gigliola Frazzoni, Antonietta Stella and Ebe Stignani. In 1956 he released his first solo LP Una Serata Dell'Opera with the Orchestre Philharmonique de Paris under Napoleone Annovazzi (now available on CD). The 1959 Franco Zeffirelli production of Lucia di Lammermoor at Covent Garden is famous for Joan Sutherland's breakthrough performance in the title role. The tenor role of Edgardo in that production was sung by Ken Neate, who replaced the scheduled tenor at short notice. On 26 October 1961, Neate created the role of Danforth in the world premiere of Robert Ward's The Crucible at the New York City Opera. That year he also sang there as Radames in Aida, Don Jos√©, and Stravinsky's Oedipus rex. In 1957 he became a principal tenor at the Paris Opera. In Paris and other centres in France, he sang Arnold (Guillaume Tell) at the Op√©ra Comique in 1954, Rom√©o (Rom√©o et Juliette) and Hoffmann (Les Contes d'Hoffmann). In Paris, he studied with Lucien Muratore, who presented Ken with several of his own costumes including that of Don Jos√© and his swords and daggers. In 1966 and 1967 he appeared opposite Birgit Nilsson in a new production of Tristan und Isolde at the Royal Opera in Stockholm, and at Expo 67 in Montreal. The role of Brang√§ne was sung by Kerstin Meyer. Ken Neate also sang the Richard Strauss roles of Aegisth, Bacchus and Apollo. However, his repertoire was not confined to opera. He sang in such works as Beethoven's 9th Symphony, Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand and Das Lied von der Erde, Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder, Handel oratorios, Dvo≈ô√°k's Stabat Mater, and the Requiems of Mozart, Verdi and Berlioz (Grande Messe des morts), under such conductors as Sir Thomas Beecham, Antal Dor√°ti, Eduard van Beinum, Jascha Horenstein, Josef Krips, Rudolf Kempe, Wolfgang Sawallisch and Carlo Maria Giulini. On his return to Australia to sing Tannh√§user in 1968, his voice was showing signs of degeneration. His last performance in opera was in the title role of Verdi's Otello at Tiroler Landestheater Innsbruck in 1975. Although he was then aged 61, his interpretation of Otello was highly praised, both vocally and dramatically. Neate also produced operas in Ireland and Austria, such as Il trovatore, Don Carlo, Tosca, Samson and Delilah, Tannh√§user and Fidelio. He also wrote some songs (Homeward calling; I am off to Kambalda). Ken Neate died in Munich, Germany on 27 June 1997. His book Great singing: Common Sense in Singing was completed at his death, and was published in 2001 by his widow. His maternal cousin was the tenor Jon Weaving. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Australian operatic tenors Category:Heldentenors Category:People from the Hunter Region Category:20th- century Australian singers Category:20th-century opera singers Category:20th- century male singers ","title":"Kenneth Neate"},{"id":"20453974","text":"James Argyle Smith (July 1, 1831 - December 6, 1901) was a United States Army officer, and a graduate of West Point.

One day, a soothsayer said he would one day become the penultimate Emperor of China. While he initially brushed it aside, a series of events and blunders would eventually make it come true. When the Qing Dynasty fell, Chu and his villager friends became bandits, only to be recruited by a warlord. Once under their command, Chu quickly rose through the ranks when many of his superiors died in accidents that are not of Chu's making. Chu eventually became a warlord himself, but was later defeated by Nationalist forces. Chu, along with his friends and family, made their way to Shanghai, where he eventually became an A-list movie star, even though Chu is illiterate, and can't read movie scripts. Chu then went from strength to strength, and eventually opened a department store. There, he was discovered by a Japanese spy, who wanted him to be a body double of Puyi, by then the Emperor of Manchukuo. The soothsayer's words have finally come true. Eventually, Chu found out about the Japanese's deeds, and decided to leave his life as Emperor. He was separated from his family members while they were escaping, and Chu eventually ended up in Hong Kong as a beggar. Only when a local reporter found out about his story did Chu reunite with his family, as well as his longtime lover, who now works as a maid for the reporter's family. Chu and his lover were reunited in the finale. At the same time, Chu discovered that he has won the Mark Six lottery drawing. However, realizing his desire to simply live out his life without dramatic ups and downs, Chu ripped up the lottery ticket. ==Casts== It is important to note that most of the character's name in the series are Cantonese homophones of another term. *Adam Cheng as Chu Gam Chun (Êú±Èå¶Êò•, homophone of the term \\"as Stupid as a Pig\\" (Ë±¨ÂíÅË†¢)) *Tang Bick Wan as Yau Yu See (Â∞§Â¶ÇÁµ≤, homophone of the term \\"Calamari Shreds\\" (È≠∑È≠öÁµ≤), a popular snack in Hong Kong) *Chun Wong as Chu Cheung Fun (Êú±Á••Ëä¨, homophone of the term \\"Rice noodle roll\\" (Ë±¨ËÖ∏Á≤â)) *Loong Tin Sang as Mok Yi Mo (Ëé´‰∫åÊØõ) *Tsang Cho Lum as Lo Dai Gau (ÂãûÂ§ßËàä) *Chan Gwok Kuen as Ngau Yuk Gon (ÁâõÁéâ‰πæ, homophone of the term \\"Beef Jerky\\" (ÁâõËÇâ‰πæ)) Category:1981 Hong Kong television series debuts Category:1981 Hong Kong television series endings Category:TVB dramas Category:Cantonese-language television shows ","title":"The Misadventure of Zoo"},{"id":"20454098","text":"Athletics events were contested at the 1959 Summer Universiade in Turin, Italy. ==Medal summaryMen=== { -  100 m 10.5 10.8 10.8 -  200 m 20.9 21.6 21.7 -  400 m 47.5 47.9 47.9 -  800 m 1:50.5 1:50.5 1:50.9 -  1500 m 3:50.9 3:52.0 3:52.1 -  5000 m 14:09.8 14:14.8 14:18.0 -  110 m hurdles 14.2 14.4 14.4 -  400 m hurdles 52.1 52.8 53.2 -  4 √ó 100 m relay  Guido De Murtas Salvatore Giannone Giorgio Mazza Livio Berruti41.0  Rudolf Sundermann Martin Reichert Burkhart Quantz Fritz Helfrich41.0  Ali Brakchi Jo√´l Caprice Jean-Claude Penez Guy Lagorce41.4 -  4 √ó 400 m relay  Albert Grawitz Burkhart Quantz Walter Oberste Otto Klappert3:09.5  Elio Catola Nereo Fossati Mario Fraschini Germano Gimelli3:11.4  Robert Hay Mike Robinson John Holt Norman Futter3:12.2 -  High jump 2.01 1.96  1.96 -  Pole vault 4.35 4.30 4.20 -  Long jump 7.46 7.43 7.42 -  Triple jump 15.74 15.55 15.44 -  Shot put 17.32 17.10 16.70 -  Discus throw 53.07 52.79 52.22 -  Hammer throw 63.65 63.61 62.32 -  Javelin throw 75.95 75.80 72.81 -  Pentathlon 4006 3530 3048 } ===Women=== { -  100 m 11.7 12.0 12.1 -  200 m 23.8 24.2 24.7 -  800 m 2:11.1 2:11.3 2:12.3 -  80 m hurdles 11.1 11.4 11.5 -  4 √ó 100 m relay 46.9  Anna Doro Fausta Galluzzi Giuseppina Leone Nadia Mecocci47.5  Inge Fuhrmann Antje Gleichfeld ? ?48.1 -  High jump 1.80 1.73 1.61 -  Long jump 5.94 5.76 5.71 -  Shot put 13.97 13.90 13.11 -  Discus throw 46.76 45.56 43.38 -  Javelin throw 49.95 47.02 46.86 } ==Medal tableReferences== *World Student Games (Universiade - Men) - GBR Athletics *World Student Games (Universiade - Women) - GBR Athletics Category:Athletics at the Summer Universiade Uni Category:1959 Summer Universiade Category:International athletics competitions hosted by Italy ","title":"Athletics at the 1959 Summer Universiade"},{"id":"20454136","text":"Lisbon Story can refer to: * Lisbon Story (1946 film) * Lisbon Story (1994 film) ","title":"Lisbon Story"},{"id":"20454142","text":"This is a list of appointments to the Australian Senate, which is the upper house of the Parliament of Australia, filling casual vacancies, from the Senate's creation in 1901 until the present day. There is a second list of invalid elections and appointments to the Senate. ==Appointment proceduresStates=== Section 15 of the Australian Constitution requires the parliament of the relevant state to choose a replacement. This is done in a joint sitting of the upper and lower house (except for Queensland, which has a unicameral parliament). In the event that the state parliament is not in session, the Governor of the state (acting on the advice of the state's executive council) may appoint a replacement senator, but such an appointment lapses if it is not confirmed by a joint sitting of the parliament within 14 days. Prior to 29 July 1977, the filing of casual vacancies was complex. While senators were elected for a six-year term, people appointed to a casual vacancy only held office until the earlier of the next election for the House of Representatives or the Senate, at which the vacancy would be filled by the electors of the relevant state. It was also an established convention that the state parliament choose (or the governor appoint) a replacement from the same political party as their predecessor, however this convention was not always followed. As a result of the 1977 referendum:Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) Act 1977 (Cth). *a state legislature must replace a senator with a member of the same political party, and *the new senator's term continues until the end of the original senator's term. ===Territories=== Replacement senators for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) or the Northern Territory (NT) are chosen by the relevant territory legislature, under s.44 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Where the legislature is not in session, the choice is made by the Administrator of the NT (acting on the advice of the territory's executive council) or the Chief Minister of the ACT. The procedure has been in use in the ACT since 1989 and in NT since 1980. Between 1980 and 1989, replacement senators in the ACT were chosen by a joint sitting of both houses of the Federal Parliament, under s.9 of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973. Prior to 1980, replacement senators in both the ACT or NT were to be elected in a by-election, though this never occurred. ==List of appointments to the Senate== __NOTOC__ {  - colspan=\\"9\\"  46th Parliament (2019‚Äì) - !State !!

It was centred on the town of Elliott, 254 km north of Tennant Creek and 419 km south of Katherine on the Stuart Highway. The Community Government Council covered an area of 5.4 km¬≤ and has a population of 501. The main towns are Elliott and Marlinja. ==History== The area's Aboriginal name is Kuliminindi; it is home of the Jingilu Mudburra tribe. Settlement by Europeans started with John McDowall Stuart and the Overland Telegraph line. A station was set up called Newcastle Waters. The station plus the nearby town was the regional centre prior to World War II. During the war, Elliott was set up as a stopover for convoys heading up to Darwin, 780 km North from Alice Springs, 720 km South of the town and is named after the commanding officer of the base, D. S. Elliott OBE. After the war, Elliott started to overtake Newcastle Waters in importance, and most functions were moved to Elliott. The Gurindji drovers strike of 1966 had repercussions here, with Union Camp being set up in Newcastle Waters Township and camps being set up in Elliott. Today there are Aboriginal communities on either end of town. The advent of equal pay and conditions resulted in many Aboriginal stockmen losing their jobs to helicopters. The road trains (triple trailer trucks) replaced the drovers, which resulted in many Aboriginal people settling permanently in Elliott. Recently there was a Native Title Case that saw Elliott Traditional Owners being given Native Title. Together with the Gurungu Aboriginal Land Trust, this means that 95 percent of the town is now back in Aboriginal hands. ==Facilities== Elliott facilities include a public bar, two roadhouses, and a caravan park. There is a rest area 23 km N of town near the Newcastle Waters /Marlinja turnoff. There is also a clinic, a police station, and an airstrip serviced by the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. The Community Development Employment Programme provides employment for many Aboriginal people. There are also public service jobs such as at the Council, as well as the roadhouses and a mechanic shop. Stations all around Elliott provide full-time work on a seasonal basis. ==Politics== The Elliott District Community Government Council consists of the President (Mayor) and four councillors. ==Attractions== Longreach Waterhole is 12 km West of town. It has coastal bird life on a fresh water perennial lake. Lake Woods is 40 km South; a four-wheel drive is required for the trip. ==References *Elliott District Community Government Council Website Category:Former local government areas of the Northern Territory ","title":"Elliott District Community Government Council"},{"id":"20454313","text":"\\"Jaimme's Got A Gal\\" is the third single from the album Sound as Ever by Australian rock band You Am I.

As a young man he married Sarah, a daughter of Anthony Lawrence, described as a \\"comfortable proprietor\\" of County Wicklow,Smith, G.B., 'Godkin, James (1806‚Äì1879)', rev. C. A. Creffield, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004) who was of Cromwellian settler ancestry.Lucas, C. P., 'Godkin, Edwin Lawrence (1831‚Äì1902)', rev. Roger T. Stearn, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) Together, they had three daughters and two sons, one of whom was Edwin Lawrence Godkin. ==Career== In 1834, Godkin was ordained as a Congregational minister and became a pastor in Armagh. He later worked as a missionary to Roman Catholics for the Irish Evangelical Society. In 1836, he published A Guide from the Church of Rome to the Church of Christ and in 1838 founded the Christian Patriot newspaper at Belfast. His counter-blast to the Oxford Movement, The Touchstone of Orthodoxy and Apostolic Christianity, or, The People's Antidote Against Puseyism and Romanism, appeared in 1842. His religious work was forceful but showed little bigotry. In 1842, Godkin became an ally of Charles Gavan Duffy on the Irish land question, and his interest in religion began to give way to his involvement in political protest. In 1845 it was revealed that he had written a prize-winning essay called The Rights of Ireland, and he parted company with the Irish Evangelical Society. Godkin became a journalist. He edited the Derry Standard, and in 1848 he decided to abandon the ministry. He next moved to London, where he worked as a contributor to many publications, including the British Quarterly Review, the North British Review, the Standard of Freedom, the Belfast Independent, and the Freeman's Journal. In 1850, he was an active member of the Irish Tenant League. After two years in England, he moved to Dublin, where he took up the chief editorial post on the city's new Daily Express newspaper. Simultaneously, he was the Dublin correspondent of The Times of London. Godkin was an influential writer on ecclesiastical and land questions. He published a treatise called Ireland and her Churches (1867), which advocated equal treatment of the churches in Ireland, as well as security of land tenure for the Irish people. It also contained outspoken views on the Famine, emigration, the Land War, and education.James Godkin at Ricorso A British government led by Gladstone decided to support the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, and the Irish Church Act 1869 took effect on 1 January 1871. In the 1860s, Godkin's work on Irish subjects appeared in the Fortnightly Review. In 1869, he travelled around much of Ulster and the rest of Ireland to test public opinion on the land question, which led to his book The Land War in Ireland (1870). This coined the name of the ensuing Land War rural agitation of the 1880s. The book was influential as it coincided with the Dublin Land Conference in 1870 and the Landlord & Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870, the first of the reforming Irish Land Acts. Godkin also published work on religion and education in India and a history of England from 1820 to 1861. In 1873, on the recommendation of Gladstone, Queen Victoria granted Godkin a pension from the Civil List. When he died in 1879 he was living in England at Upper Norwood, Surrey and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. One son, Edwin Lawrence Godkin, became a notable newspaper editor in America, editor-in-chief of The Nation and the Evening Post, and in 1870 declined the appointment of professor of history at Harvard.

Throughout that season, Yarran formed part of a short-lived forward-line structure consisting of tall full-forward Setanta √ì hAilp√≠n, and three small forwards (Betts, Yarran, and Yarran's Swan Districts teammate Jeff Garlett) who became known as \\"Setanta's Little Helpers\\". In 2011, coach Brett Ratten abandoned the tactic of playing three small forwards in favour of two: Betts and Garlett. Yarran was moved onto the half-back line, and within the year became a damaging rebounding defender, able to use his speed, agility and accurate disposal to set up much of Carlton's rebound play.

In 2008, he played eleven games for the Tasmanian Devils Football Club in the Victorian Football League, as well as two games for the Lauderdale Football Club seniors in the Southern Football League, and one game for the Tassie Mariners in the TAC Cup. He featured prominently at the AFL Under 18s Championship, winning Hunter-Harrison Medal as the best player in Division Two of the competition. He was drafted by the Carlton Football Club with its 3rd round selection (No. 40 overall) in the 2008 AFL National Draft, and made his debut in Round 1, 2009 against Richmond at the M.C.G., scoring three goals. Robinson played sporadically in the AFL in his first two seasons, playing 26 of 46 possible games for Carlton and spending the rest of the time with Northern Bullants. His breakthrough came in the 2011 season, when he won a regular place in the team, and became a key ball-winner in the midfield; at midseason, Herald Sun commentator Mark Robinson heralded him as the league's most improved player. He went on to finish seventh in the John Nicholls Medal count for the season, and was selected to represent Australia in the 2011 International Rules Series. Robinson quickly became popular with Carlton fans for his hardness at the ball - often in apparent disregard for his own safety, to the point where his style is sometimes described as \\"kamikaze\\". Robinson was involved in some off-field incidents during his time at Carlton. He was involved in a fight at the 2013 Big Day Out festival, and was fined $1,000 by the club as a result. Then in August 2014, Robinson suffered a fractured eye-socket when he and Jeff Garlett became unwittingly involved in a brawl outside a nightspot at 5am on a Sunday morning; Robinson lied about the incident, telling the club he had sustained the injury in a boxing session at training, and he was fined $5,000 by the club. Robinson was delisted by Carlton after the 2014 season, having played 100 games for Carlton, after lying to the club about being involved in an incident with teammate Jeff Garlett.

Al-Hussary committed the entire Qur'an to memory by age 8 and started reciting at public gatherings by age 12. In 1944, Al-Hussary won Egypt Radio's Qu'ran Recitation competition which had around 200 participants, including veterans like Muhammad Rifat. The quadrumvirate of El Minshawy, Abdul Basit, Mustafa Ismail, and Al-Hussary are generally considered the most important and famous Qurra' of modern times to have had an outsized impact on the Islamic world. ==Career Early Life === Mahmoud entered the Qur'an School at the age of four, and by age 8 (or by 11), he had already memorized the entire Qur'an. By age 11, he had enrolled for training at the acclaimed Ahmad al-Badawi mosque in Tanta. He later joined Al-Azhar University in Cairo and was conferred with diploma in al-Qira'at al-'Ashar (). === Service === He moved to Cairo and joined Egypt's official Qur'an radio station as a reciter making his first appearance on February 16, 1944. Just a year later, in 1945, al-Hussary was appointed reciter at the Ahmad al-Badawi mosque. On August 7, 1948, he was nominated mu'adhin of the Sidi Hamza Mosque and later, a Maqari () at the same mosque. He also supervised recitation centers in the al-Gharbia province. Though a conflicting report claims he served at the Ahmad al-Badawi mosque for 10 straight years. In 1955, he was appointed to the Al-Hussein Mosque in Cairo and remained in-service there for 29 years, until his death. === At Al-Azhar === After returning to Cairo, al-Hussary studied and taught at Al-Azhar University. In 1960, he led the department of wa al-Hadith bi Jam'i al-Buhuts al-Islamiyah () for correcting Quranic codexes present in the al-Azhar libraries. As one of the four top-ranking reciters in Egypt, he recorded the complete Quranic text in both styles of recitation, murattal (tarteel) and mujawwad (tajwid) and was, in fact, first-ever Qari to record and broadcast the murattal style. He recorded and wrote treatises on various Qur'an recital styles: Hafs an ‚Äò√Ñsim in 1961, Warsh an N√¢fi‚Äô in 1964, Q√¢l√ªn an N√¢fi‚Äô and Ad- D√ªr√Æ an Abi 'Amr in 1968. In the same year, he recorded the Qu'ran in Al- Mushaf Al-Mu‚Äôallim () style, a tarteel technique with exclusive focus on pedagogy. In his lifetime, Al-Hussary authored 12 books on Qur'anic sciences in a bid to end corruption of both, the text and the recitation styles. === Recognition and awards === In 1944, Al-Hussary won Egypt Radio's Qu'ran Recitation competition which had around 200 participants, among them some veterans like Muhammad Rifat, Ali Mahmud, and Abd Al-Fattah Ash-Sha'sha'i. Al- Azhar awarded him the title Shaykh al-Maq√¢ri () in 1957. He was also appointed to the board of Islamic research on Hadith and the Qur'an at Al-Azhar. He was a recipient of the Egyptian Medal of Honour for Arts and Sciences, First Grade, from the Egyptian president Gamal 'Abd Al-Nasir, in 1967. The same year, he was elected the President of the Islamic World League of Qur'an Reciters. === Tours === In 1960, he travelled to Pakistan and India, the first Egyptian Qari to do so, to recite at a conference in the presence of the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the first Egyptian President, Gamal Abdul Nasir. He accompanied the Rector of Al-Azhar University on their travels. He was invited to participate in the World of Islam Festival in London (1976). He has recited the Quran in front of the American Congress, the United Nations in 1977, and at the Buckingham Palace in 1978. He has been on Qur'an recital tours to the Philippines, China, France, and Singapore; in addition to touring other Muslim countries, mostly during the month of Ramadan. == Technique == Al Hussary was a strong proponent of preserving the qiraat art-form in its original scheme (tarteel) and was publicly apprehensive of innovation in recital delivery techniques. He once said: > The tarteel shapes every word with an evocative manner, a fact that cannot > be produced during a pure \\"chanted\\" interpretation where words are subjected > to a certain musicality which can be opposing to the necessary sound print > to reach the real meaning. And if we feel the melodic saturation during the > ‚Äúchanted‚Äù interpretation, we feel, on the other hand, calmness and > introversion during tarteel derived from the message of the holy Quran. In another instance, he said: > The tarteel puts us directly on the screen of the Quranic text. It puts us > in an active listening position and makes the listener feel the > responsibility to listen. However, \\"chanted\\" restitution borrows passages of > introversion by an envelope of jollity; the tarteel is more difficult > because it reveals faithfully the meaning. The roots of tarteel deal > basically with the koranic text and not the musical rhythms. In the preface of one of his books, Ma\` Al-Qur‚Äôan Al-Karim (lit. With the Holy Koran), Shaykh Mahmud Shaltut, the then chief Imam of the al-Azhar mosque, said about him: > God has given to many people the goods of this world and beyond, and granted > them by giving them happiness in the two shelters through this right path, > the path of the holy Koran. They learned it, recite it and honoured it as it > should be. They struggled to protect it and found joy in it because it > always guided them towards truth and the right path. Among those, I have > known our son Shaykh Khalil Al-Husari.

His last public recitals were at the Kaaba in Mecca and Masjid al Nabawi in Medina. == Legacy == Al-Hosary Mosque of Cairo inaugurated in 2005 A TV series titled Imam al-Maqar'ine () starring Hassan Youssef, created by Dr. Bahaa El-Din Ibrahim and directed by Mustafa Al-Shall, was based on Al- Hussary‚Äôs life and performances, and had backing from the Shaykh's children, Dr. Mohammed Al-Hussary and Yasmine Al-Khayam. At the time of his death in 1980, he left a third of his wealth to build a mosque on Al-Ajuzah Street in Cairo. In his will, he left the expenses for the mosque he had built in Tanta, as well as for the three Islamic institutes and a center dedicated to Quran memorization, Mahad Azhar (), in his village, Shobra al-Namla. In what's a testament to Al-Hussary's standing in the profession, Mohammed Burhanuddin, a strong proponent of Qur'anic sciences, education, and memorization, conferred his grandson, Husain Burhanuddin, with the title Hussary al-Hind (). The 26th International Quran Contest hosted by Egypt was named after him in his honour. Al-Hussary's family runs a charity called Shaykh Al Hussary Society (), chaired by his daughter, Yasmeen al-Khayam (). The Society built Al-Hosary, the largest mosque in 6th of October City, inaugrated in October 2005, in his honour. The mosque complex, a major landmark of the city, also has an orphanage, a Qur'anic institute, and multi-purpose auditoriums. The mosque rather remarkably hosts sermons from contrarians such as Amr Khaled as well as orthodox clergy of Al-Azhar, and government ministers. The Society has been instrumental in resettling Syrian refugees in Egypt. Al-Hussary's recordings are extensively used for Quranic memorization and recitation throughout the Muslim world. == References  * Al-Jazeera's (Arabic) * Al-Nahar TV's (Arabic) * Teaching Style Recitation on Islamway * Mujawwad Style Recitation on Islamway * Murattal Style Recitation on Islamway Category:Egyptian Quran reciters Category:Al-Azhar University alumni Category:1917 births Category:1980 deaths Category:People from Tanta ","title":"Mahmoud Khalil Al-Hussary"},{"id":"20455290","text":"Yanchi County () is a county under the administration of Wuzhong city in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China, bordering the provinces of Shaanxi to the east and Gansu to the south, as well as Inner Mongolia to the north.

The Zimbabwean constitution promotes freedom of the media and expression, however this is hampered by interference and the implementation of strict media laws. In its 2008 report, Reporters Without Borders ranked the Zimbabwean media as 151st out of 173.\\"Press Freedom Index\\" . Reporters Without Borders. ==History1965-1980=== Following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965, one of the main aims of the protracted political struggle launched by the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) during the Rhodesian Bush War was for a free press.Chavunduka, M. G. (2002). In The Right to Tell: The Role of Mass Media in Economic Development. Eds. Islam, R., Djankov, S. & McLeish, C. World Bank Publications. The independent Rhodesian press was also almost universally critical of UDI, and claimed to have been subject to physical intimidation by the authorities. New legislation was also passed declaring it illegal to print statements \\"likely to cause alarm, fear, or despondency among readers\\". In the 1970s, criticism was leveled at Rhodesia's Official Secrets Act, which made it a crime to publish articles related to \\"classified information\\" and the Law and Order Maintenance Act (LOMA), which allowed the state to impose exceptionally heavy sentences on those who violated the ban. Such acts were used to impose a media blackout on journalists reporting on allegedly excessive losses or setbacks suffered by the Rhodesian Security Forces as the bush war intensified. Media was ordered to focus on casualties among guerrillas and to report on their retreats to Zambia and Mozambique. Shortly after the Lancaster House Conference, media restrictions were again revised. Censorship of the foreign press ended, although the Joint Operations Command retained the power to apply internal media blackouts at its discretion. This was protected by Section 42a of the Law and Order Maintenance Act, and when general elections were held in February 1980 nothing had been done to alter it. Nevertheless, the security forces were also forbidden to abuse the legislation by banning the publication of political material. The Rhodesian government had also issued a number of \\"D Notices\\", which revoked publishing rights to photographs of two candidates, Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe, except through official sanction. These remained in force during the election. ===1980-1999=== After Mugabe's victory in the 1980 election, the new Republic of Zimbabwe did not implement the proposed media reforms carried over from the Rhodesian years, which were instead seen as useful for disseminating information approved by the government. The only act to be repealed was the Powers, Privileges, and Immunities of Parliament Act, which had made it illegal for media to report on debates in parliament. In January 1981, the government set up the Zimbabwe Mass Media Trust (ZMMT) as part of the government's new media policy, under widespread criticism of the national media, which at the time was inherited from foreign control.Allen, Tim; Seaton, Jim. (1999). The media of conflict: war reporting and representations of ethnic violence. Zed Books. p. 247. . It was originally intended to serve as an authority to oversee the transition of the media from white minority control to Zimbabwean society as a whole and to regulate the media.Park, Myung-Jin; Curran, James. (2000). The media and the state in Zimbabwe in De-Westernizing Media Studies. Routledge. . The government emphasised that the media be free, non-partisan, mass-orientated and serve the national interest; however, a growing presence of the Ministry of Information into the media effected its original function. Despite difficult working conditions for the media, they had contributed to improved governance in Zimbabwe. In 1987, despite threats from the Zimbabwe National Army where the disease was taking its toll, the Financial Gazette newspaper published its first article on AIDS.World Press Freedom Review 2000. International Press Institute, 2000. Vienna. The topic was vigorously covered in the private media, which later led to the government's decision to facilitate maximum publicity and education on the disease. Around the late 1980s, while the government was favouring a one-party state based on its alliances with other communist states, independent media launched a campaign against this style of governance, which was later joined by the public, churches and opposition groups. By 1988, the concept was abandoned and continued in its multi-party form. In 1989, Chronicle editors Geoffrey Nyarota and Davison Maruziva exposed what was known as the Willowgate scandal which exposed corruption of the authorities during a shortage of foreign currency in Zimbabwe. It emerged that foreign vehicles were sold at cheaper prices compared to the public which were sold the vehicles at highly inflated prices. Media coverage led to the resignation of six government officials, one of whom later committed suicide. This was followed by further scandals in the 1990s which involved the looting of funds set aside for government projects by government officials, which the media brought to the attention of parliament. The government responded with corrective actions, though not all of the suspects were punished. The looting of diamonds in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by the Zimbabwe National Army on a peacekeeping mission also led to a national investigation. A decline in popularity of the government in the late 1990s and growing instability saw the emergence of independent newspapers critical of the government, including the Financial Gazette, Daily News and The Standard. The independent press competed with the more dominant state media, particularly the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, which is currently the sole TV and radio broadcaster in the country. The emergence of this new media, along with civic groups and opposition parties, successfully changed government policy from a one-party state to a multi-party system. ===1999-present=== All news media in the country are careful to reflect the government line when reporting by self-censorship.\\"BBC Country Profile: Zimbabwe media\\", BBC News, November 20, 2008. Private press was common and still exists, however since the 2002 Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) was passed, (which replaced LOMA from 40 years earlier) a number of outlets were shut down by the government, including The Daily News the same year. As a result, many press organisations have been set up in both neighbouring and Western countries by exiled Zimbabweans. However, because the internet is currently unrestricted, many Zimbabweans are allowed to access online news sites set up by exiled journalists.2009 Map of Press Freedom: Zimbabwe. Freedom House. Reporters Without Borders claims the media in Zimbabwe involves \\"surveillance, threats, imprisonment, censorship, blackmail, abuse of power and denial of justice are all brought to bear to keep firm control over the news.\\" Opposition views are often skewed, scantly covered or not mentioned in the state media, which has also criticised demonstrations and strikes against the government. Until July 2009, a Zambian newspaper, The Post, was the only foreign newspaper allowed to work in the country, along with the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Al Jazeera and SABC news agencies.Zimbabwe relaxes media restrictions . The Post. July 31, 2009. After a power sharing deal was agreed by Zanu PF and the opposition MDC in February 2009, Morgan Tsvangirai announced he was to \\"democratise\\" the state media and repeal many strict laws in order for the media to have a more meaningful role in the rebuilding of the country.Tsvangirai to whip state media into line, Zimdaily, February 12, 2009.Change in Zimbabwe? , Morung Express, February 13, 2009.Prime Minister promises immediate media reform, The Zimbabwean, February 12, 2009.

Stabroek News. July 31, 2009. The Daily News newspaper re-appeared again on March 18, 2011, with its first article questioning whether Robert Mugabe should continue to rule at the age of 87. ==Relations with foreign media and governments== The Zimbabwean press at times has strained relations with foreign press and governments. Governments from neighbouring countries such as Botswana and Zambia, as well as Tanzania who have a tense relationship with Zimbabwe, have regularly protested against attacks on their countries by Zimbabwean state media.\\"Zambia protests over Zim attacks...Incessant blows on President Mwanawasa unjustified\\", Times of Zambia, accessed November 29, 2008. The government also banned many foreign broadcasting stations from Zimbabwe, including the BBC, CNN, Sky News, CBC, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Channel Four, ABC,NBC and Fox News. However, restrictions were lifted in July 2009, meaning the BBC and CNN could again operate in the country, however other aforementioned Western news media organizations are still forbidden to operate.Plunket, John; Holmwood, Leigh (July 29, 2009). Zimbabwe lifts reporting ban on BBC and CNN after eight years. The Guardian. News agencies and newspapers from other Western countries and South Africa have also been banned from the country.Dean, Chris (July 29, 2009). CNN and BBC to Report Again from Zimbabwe. DigitalJournal.com. Other stations that were allowed into Zimbabwe, such as Al Jazeera, were told to be \\"more objective\\" in their reporting by the Zimbabwean government during the presidential election. Rising media fees for reporting in the country have also caused condemnation from foreign journalists claiming that freedom of expression will deteriorate. The Ministry of Information claimed the rising costs were necessary to prevent foreign journalists for \\"distorting stories\\". Outrage over Zimbabwe media registration fees , African Press Agency, January 10, 2009. ==Newspapers== Zimbabwe is host to some of the oldest newspapers in Africa; The Herald, Zimbabwe's major newspaper, replaced the Mashonaland and Zambesian Times, which was present from the late 1890s. The Herald, once an influential paper, has seen a decline in readership from 132,000 to between 50,000 and 100,000 in recent years. The influential Daily News, which regularly published criticism of the government, was shut down in 2002, however its director Wilf Mbanga started The Zimbabwean soon after to continue challenging the Mugabe regime.Press Reference: Zimbabwe, accessed November 29, 2008. The first daily independent Zimbabwean daily newspaper, following Daily News, NewsDay, started publishing in 2010. Journalists can be fired by the Ministry of Information if content is deemed inappropriate. Other notable Zimbabwean newspapers in print include The Chronicle (Zimbabwe), The Financial Gazette, the Zimbabwe Independent, and the Zimbabwe Daily News. Newspapers are less readily available in the countryside, where radio is the main source of news. ==Television and radio== Most television and radio media are controlled by the government owned ZBC. There are 16 local radio stations and 1 local free to air television channel, ZBC TV. However, satellite stations are received in the country unrestricted, mainly through DStv, a digital satellite television and radio distributor. Zimbabwe transmits analogue terrestrial television on the VHF band, with digital not yet deployed as of 2019.http://crm.misa.org/upload/web/digital-terrestrial-television-migration- in-zimbabwe.pdf Coverage in rural areas is low, due to poor infrastructure. Overall, 30% of the population receives broadcasts by the ZBC, so radio is the main source of information. In 2006, a parliamentary committee in Zimbabwe called for an opening up of the broadcast media. Chinese technology has been used to jam frequencies used by foreign based radio stations in South Africa, the US and the UK that criticise the government. The vast majority of the media is practically propaganda, all of it either eulogizes Mugabe, features pan-African programming, and heavily spreads anti-British and anti-American sentiment on its TV and radio programming. In 2012 two private radio stations, Star FM and ZiFM Stereo were launched. StarFM is owned by the government- controlled Zimpapers. It offers political discussion from a heavily pro- government perspective and an expanded entertainment schedule. ZiFM, owned by ZANU‚ÄìPF MP Supa Mandiwanzira is more focused on entertainment although it also offers political and social opinion programmes that are heavily weighted towards pro-government positions. The two stations are seen as direct competition to ZBC's commercial radio station, Power FM. In 2015, the local broadcasting licensing board, BAZ granted broadcasting licences to 8 regional radio stations which included Bulawayo's Skyz Metro FM and Harare's Capitalk 100.4 FM, to mention a few. All the 8 radio stations were successfully operational by the end of 2017 despite the tough economic challenges. In 2018, state owned ZBC further added 2 more regional radio stations, Khulumani FM and 95.8 Central Radio in Bulawayo and Gweru respectively. In the presidential elections in 2008, the media gave significantly more coverage to the ruling party, Zanu PF, and rarely showed opposition broadcasts. It was also criticised for inciting violence against the opposition.Media in Zimbabwe , accessed November 29, 2008.\\"Poll run-up a 'dog's breakfast'\\", Cape Argus (IOL), March 22, 2008, page 12. ==Internet== Internet use is unrestricted by the government as 10.955% of the population are able to access it, due to high costs. However, this is one of the highest rates of usage in Africa. Due to the unrestricted nature of the internet, foreign based Zimbabwean papers and news sites are accessible from inside Zimbabwe. The government has considered monitoring emails and restricting internet sites for the purposes of \\"national security\\", but currently this is not in place. In 2007, according to the CIA World Factbook, 1.35 million Zimbabweans were able to access the internet. Currently, there are 27 internet service providers in Zimbabwe, reflecting the growing usage of the internet.Zimbabwe Internet Usage and Marketing Report, Internet World Stats. ==See also== *Telecommunications in Zimbabwe *Censorship and Entertainment Control Act, 1967 * List of Zimbabwean writers ==ReferencesBibliography== *N.C.G.

The forests around the city are populated by a wide range of wildlife, such as bears, wolves, hares, higher primates and deer. The population of wild boar and squirrels has been in decline for a number of years, as a result of extensive hunting. Wildlife conservation groups have been putting pressure on local and regional government to protect the dwindling populations of these species, but these pressures are being resisted, as hunting forms a substantial part of the local diet, along with roots and locally grown food such as kopria. The Thyamis River flows three kilometers to the north. There is a small lake (xhavouza) near the village, through which the river flows. The xhavouza is used as a dumping site for septic tanks from houses in Voutsaras and other cities in the Molossoi municipality, as the untreated water can then be washed away by the river. According to local legend, the xhavouza is the place where water nymphs used to wash their hair, and onlookers were turned to stone. ==Infrastructure== An architectural pattern typical for the village consists of a two-floor house: the top floor is fully walled and serves as the residential area for one or more families, whereas the ground floor is used for housing livestock (goats, sheep, swine). Less wealthy families, who cannot afford a two-floor house share living quarters with the livestock. There are plans to construct centralised plumbing facilities for the disposal of sewage in the near future, so as to replace the current practice of using septic tanks which drain in the nearby river Thyamis. ==Education== In an attempt to reverse emigration, the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs designated Voutsaras as an Area of Educational Priority in 2005. This led to the upgrading of the local primary school and high school, and financial incentives for the teaching staff who are employed there (these bonuses were revoked in the 2010 government deficit crisis). Also, a new vocationally focussed syllabus was created for High School, with standards that were better suited to the academic potential of the Voutsaras youth. The Voutsaras High School also operates a successful adult education programme, in which local residents attend classes on literacy, arithmetic and hygiene. The programme, which is partly funded by the EU, and is also generously supported by the School of Education of the University of the Aegean has received praise from the Molossoi mayor and local press. Despite promising beginnings, the funding of the program was withdrawn in 2011 due to austerity measures associated with the Greek deficit crisis. The deputy minister for education, Evangelia Christofilopoulou, who took the decision to discontinue the program was quoted as saying that it is time for bold measures to stop the bleeding of the government budget. ==Sights== One of the most noteworthy sights in the village is the Church of Ai Nikolas (St. Nicolas) which was erected by the alms donated by the sailors of Voutsaras, because in the Greek Orthodox tradition St Nicolas is regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The church, a basilica with three wings, dates back to 1534, and is one of the oldest churches in the region. Also of interest is the exhibition in the Cultural Centre, where visitors can find on display items of everyday life and agriculture, such as kypria (bells used for livestock), tsanakia (eating utensils), vitses (rods used by teachers) and glitses (walking sticks). Entry to the exhibition can be arranged by consultation with the Town Hall of Molossi. ==See also== *List of settlements in the Ioannina regional unit ==External links== *Voutsaras at the GTP Travel Pages ==References== Category:Populated places in Ioannina (regional unit) ","title":"Voutsaras, Ioannina"},{"id":"20455659","text":"Dash Berlin is a Dutch electronic music trio started in 2007 in The Hague by Eelke Kalberg and Sebastiaan Molijn. The frontman of the group is Jeffrey Sutorius, the seventh most popular DJ in the world according to DJ Mag in 2012; Kalberg and Molijn were record producers. Kalberg and Molijn left the group in 2019. Sutorius initially started playing drums influenced by his late father who was a drummer in a jazz band, before discovering electronic music. He worked at BPM Dance and Mid-Town Records specializing in vinyl, with both stores becoming meeting places for many established Dutch DJs. Molijn and Kalberg, who were deejaying as Pronti and Kalmani at the time, have credited Sutorius as a vital source of inspiration for some of their biggest records during that time. Kalberg and Molijn have been contributing to the international dance scene for over twenty years, with award-winning and platinum-selling hits for dance acts such as Alice Deejay, Vengaboys, Candee Jay, Pronti and Kalmani and Solid Sessions. Their track \\"Better Off Alone\\" was one of the first trance records that became big in the U.S. and was later sampled by French superstar DJ David Guetta in his song \\"Play Hard\\" and one of America's biggest rappers Wiz Khalifa in his breakthrough record \\"Say Yeah\\". They also had worked together with DJ Sander Kleinenberg on classic tracks like \\"This Is Miami\\" and \\"The Fruit\\" and remixes for major artists such as Justin Timberlake ('Rock Your Body' Remix winning the award for 'Best Remix' at the Dance Star USA Awards), Janet Jackson, BT, Usher, N.E.R.D., Lenny Kravitz, Junkie XL, R√∂yksopp, Mylo and Annie Lennox. On 18 June 2018, Sutorius announced his split from Dash Berlin while severing ties with Kalberg and Molijn, citing mismanagement and career neglect issues. Beginning October 2018, Sutorius has been producing and performing under his own name, while Dash Berlin continued as a duo. Sutorius later rejoined on 21 June 2019 while Kalberg and Molijn retired from Dash Berlin to pursue their own musical projects. ==HistoryFormation=== Dash Berlin was formed by Kalberg and Moljin in The Hague, Netherlands, with Sutorius joining soon after Jeffrey Sutorius was a fan of electronic music from his high school days and in his late teens worked in a record store and became a collector of vinyl trance music. Inspired by pioneering figures such as Sven V√§th, Oliver Lieb and Sander Kleinenberg, Sutorius began mixing and producing his own music. He released his first record on 'BPM Legends' records. He started performing in the Dutch underground music scene in early '95 and teamed up with fellow producers and close friends Kalberg and Molijn to form Dash Berlin into a trio in 2006. ===Sutorius' split from group and eventual return=== On 18 June 2018, Jeffrey Sutorius announced through a press statement that he would be leaving the group, while cutting his connections with Kalberg, Molijn, and the Vanderkleij Agency. He revealed that Molijn and Kalberg had registered the name \\"Dash Berlin\\" under their own names while leaving him out, thus leaving him legally unable to perform as Dash Berlin. Further attempts to reconcile through lawyers and courts had failed, and Sutorius was also blocked from accessing the group's social media accounts after severing ties with his former partners. Sutorius later announced that he would be producing and performing under his own name, beginning October 2018. In a second press statement with DJ Mag, Sutorius revealed that his intense touring periods had brought up health issues for him in late-2017, which in turn led him to take two months off for a physical checkup. During that time period, Sutorius was unable to perform, to his management's heavy opposition. He eventually stopped working with his booking company, while Kalberg and Molijn froze Sutorius out of Dash Berlin's social media accounts and filed a court claim against him for failure to fulfil his booked shows. The court later denied the claim. Kalberg and Molijn's reasons for registering the Dash Berlin name without Sutorius are still unclear due to their refusal to provide documents and information to Sutorius. On 21 June 2019, Dash Berlin released an official statement which announced the departure of Kalberg and Molijn from the group, leaving behind Sutorius to lead the group as a solo artist. The group concluded that the \\"chemistry between [Dash Berlin] is gone and that it is time for a change\\", with the former producers focusing on new musical projects. ==Recognition== The breakthrough for Dash Berlin came in early 2007 with \\"Till the Sky Falls Down\\". The track went to the top of the trance charts worldwide, due in part to Armin van Buuren who included it on the third chapter of his acclaimed Universal Religion mix album. Van Buuren subsequently signed Dash Berlin to the Armada Music label. Dash Berlin won the IDMA award for the track \\"Waiting\\" in the category 'Best High Energy Track' and was nominated three times at the International Dance Music Awards, during the WMC in Miami in 2009. His tracks \\"Waiting\\" featuring Australian singer Emma Hewitt and \\"Man On The Run\\", a collaboration with fellow Armada artists Cerf, Mitiska and Jaren were both nominated that year in the category 'Best Trance Track'. In Armin van Buuren's popular radio show A State of Trance the \\"Waiting\\" single was elected by the audience to the second best trance track of the year 2009. The music video is shot in Rotterdam and gained over twenty-five million views on YouTube. In 2010, Dash were nominated for the \\"Best European DJ\\" at the IDMA's and entered the DJ Mag Top 100 poll at number 15. They won the DJ Mag Top 100 Award for \\"Highest New Entry\\", during the Magazine's ceremony at the Ministry Of Sound in London, hosted by Boy George. Beating other famous Dutch DJs such as Armin van Buuren, Tiesto, Ferry Corsten as the highest Dutch entry till date. On October 20, 2011 DJ Magazine announced the results of their annual Top 100 DJ Poll for the very first time in Amsterdam, with Dash Berlin placed at number eight in the world. In 2012, Dash Berlin receives a nomination for \\"Best Trance Track\\" at the IDMA's for his track with Jonathan Mendelsohn entitled \\"Better Half Of Me\\". October 2012: In Mexico Dash Berlin are nominated for a prestigious Lunas Award in the category Electronic Music among other artists such as Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, and David Guetta, among others. Later that month, Dash were ranked number 7 in the DJ Mag Top 100 poll, making them the second most popular Trance DJ in the world, right after their mentor Armin van Buuren. In December 2012, Dash Berlin were nominated for a 'Tunisia Music Award', Africa's biggest award show till date. Also in December, Dash Berlin headlined the Sunset Music Festival in Sri Lanka for the first time. In February 2013, Dash Berlin headlined Ultra Chile and Ultra Buenos Aires with Avicii, Carl Cox and Armin van Buuren. In 2013, Dash Berlin received a nomination for the \\"Best Trance Track\\" at the IDMA awards for their single \\"When You Were Around\\" featuring British singer Kate Walsh. Dash Berlin was the first DJ to be announced for Armin van Buuren's A State Of Trance 600 event in 2013. Dash played at ASOT Den Bosch, ASOT Mexico City, ASOT Minsk, ASOT Sofia, ASOT Beirut, and ASOT Guatemala. In 2014, Dash Berlin were nominated for the 2014 Ibiza DJ Award, but lost out to Iban Mendoza. ==Aropa Records== In early 2009, plans emerged to expand the Dash Berlin influence with their own label called Aropa Records. The first release under the new label is \\"Man on the Run\\", a collaboration with fellow Armada artists Cerf, Mitiska and Jaren. The track rocketed to the top of the international trance charts and received a nomination for 'Best Trance Track' at the annual Trance Awards. The song is also the lead single of their debut album The New Daylight which was released later that year in October. In April 2012, Dash Berlin released their second artist album on Aropa and Armada Music titled #Musicislife. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of studio albums !

The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 2, 1977 and is located within the Van Vorst Park Historic District, which itself was dedicated on March 5, 1980 and is roughly bounded by Railroad Avenue, and Henderson, Grand, Bright, and Monmouth Streets. The house was one of two similar homes constructed by Cornelius Van Vorst, a founder of the Township of Van Vorst and mayor of Jersey City from 1860 to 1862.Jersey City Past and Present, Barrow Mansion / Ionic House, Accessed November 28, 2008. The Van Vorsts were a prominent family who trace their North American roots to the third superintendent of the patroonship Pavonia, whose bowery was located at nearby Harsimus. The family lends its name to the nearby Van Vorst Park which was part of the township. Cornelius Van Vorst's sister Eliza was married to Dr. William Barrow. Built between 1835‚Äì1837 and also known as the Ionic House, the wooden Greek Revival structure has five Ionic columns gracing a two-story portico. The columns divide the building into four equal bays, effecting an offset center hall. As the columns are evenly spaced, the front door is not in the center, but set off to the right The interior of late Federal-early Greek Revival style with some Victorian d√©cor features a ballroom, carved Italian marble fireplaces and twelve-foot ceilings. The mansion stood alongside the Van Vorst Mansion, separated only by a lawn, and near the Van Vorst family farmhouse. In 1874 Van Vorst sold his home to Dr. Benjamin Edge and it was later demolished in the 1920s. The Y.M.C.A. bought the Barrow Mansion in the 1890s, adding a rifle range and gymasium. St. Matthew's Evangelical Lutheran Church purchased the residence in 1897 and used it as a parish house. The pistol range was converted to a two- lane bowling alley in the basement. The following year St. Matthew's Church was built on the lawn between the Barrow and Van Vorst mansions. The church flourished until the 1920s and the former mansion and parish house became a lively and popular social center. As the neighborhood changed in the post-war era, the mansion fell into disrepair. In 1984 the Barrow Mansion Development Corporation was founded to renovate the mansion and operate it as a center for community service. The BMDC's board is composed of members from St. Matthew's Lutheran Church and the wider community. The BMDC leases the mansion from church, and received grants in 1992 and 1995 from the New Jersey Historic Trust and other grantors for building restoration. The mansion currently provides office space to small businesses and non-profits, is home to the Attic Ensemble theater company,http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2011/09/attic_ensemble_in_jersey_city_1.html Jersey City Children's Theater and is host to Hudson County's largest number of Twelve Step groups and other community meetings (over 1100 in 2010). ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hudson County, New Jersey *New Jersey Register of Historic PlacesNJ State Register of Historic Places in Hudson County *Barrow Mansion website *New Jersey City University website re: Barrow Mansion *New Jersey City University website re: Van Vorst Mansion *Jersey City Landmarks website re: Barrow Mansion *City of Jersey City website re: Van Vorst Mansion ==References * View of Barrow Mansion via Google Street View Category:Buildings and structures in Jersey City, New Jersey Category:Houses in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Category:History of Jersey City, New Jersey Category:Houses completed in 1837 Category:Historic district contributing properties in New Jersey Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:New Jersey Register of Historic Places ","title":"Barrow Mansion"},{"id":"20455817","text":" The USS LST-517 was a tank landing ship in the service of the United States Navy during World War II.

He was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles on June 8, 1965, in the third round of the 1965 amateur draft. He was then drafted from the Orioles by the New York Yankees on November 28, 1966 in the 1966 first-year draft.

Originally a sacred site for Native Americans, its hot springs were discovered by unknown Chinese miners, and settled by young German immigrant Fred C. Burgdorf in the late 1860s. Burgdorf had mined in nearby Warren to the east and turned the area at the hot springs into a resort by 1870. Following a new mining rush in 1898 at Thunder Gulch, the resort was refurbished and expanded in 1902 by Burgdorf and his new young wife, a singer from Denver named Janette Foronsard. Originally known as \\"Resort,\\" it became \\"Burgdorf\\" at this time, but the former name continued in usage for several years. Following Janette's death in 1923, Burgdorf sold his interest and moved to Weiser. Much of the community has now been deserted, although reconstruction has been attempted. The community possessed a post office as late as 1945, although it has since been closed. In 1972, the community was added as a historic district to the National Register of Historic Places. A new county road section through the hot springs property was constructed in the early 1980s.

When Hebrang resigned from both his posts as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Social Welfare in February 2005, he was replaced by Damir Polanƒçec (as Deputy Prime Minister) and Neven Ljubiƒçiƒá (who took over his portfolio). {  - !width=\\"160\\"Minister !colspan=2 width=\\"80\\"Party !Portfolio !width=\\"130\\"Term start !width=\\"130\\"Term end - Ivo Sanader style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Prime Minister 23 December 2003 6 July 2009 - Damir Polanƒçec style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Deputy Prime Minister 17 February 2005 12 January 2008 - Petar ƒåobankoviƒá style=\\"background- color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management 23 December 2003 12 January 2008 - Bo≈æo Bi≈°kupiƒá style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Culture 23 December 2003 29 December 2010 - Berislav Ronƒçeviƒá style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Defence 23 December 2003 12 January 2008 - Jadranka Kosor style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Family, Veterans' Affairs and Inter-generational Solidarity 23 December 2003 6 July 2009 - Ivan ≈†uker style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Finance 23 December 2003 29 December 2010 - Miomir ≈Ωu≈æul style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Foreign Affairs 17 February 2005 16 February 2005 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" rowspan=2 rowspan=\\"2\\"HDZ European Integration 23 December 2003 16 February 2005 - Foreign Affairs and European Integration 17 February 2005 12 January 2008 - Andrija Hebrang style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ rowspan=\\"2\\"Health and Social Welfare 23 December 2003 15 February 2005 - Neven Ljubiƒçiƒá style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ 16 February 2005 12 January 2008 - Bo≈æidar Kalmeta style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Sea, Tourism, Transport and Development 23 December 2003 23 December 2011 - Vesna ≈†kare-O≈æbolt style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" DC rowspan=\\"2\\"Justice 23 December 2003 9 February 2006 - Ana Lovrin style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ 10 February 2006 10 October 2008 - Marina Matuloviƒá-Dropuliƒá style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Environment Protection, Spatial Planning and Construction 23 December 2003 29 December 2010 - Dragan Primorac style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" Non-party Science, Education and Sports 23 December 2003 2 July 2009 - Marijan Mlinariƒá style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ rowspan=\\"2\\"Interior 23 December 2003 12 July 2005 - Ivica Kirin style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ 12 July 2005 2 January 2008 - Branko Vukeliƒá style=\\"background-color: \\" width=\\"2px\\" HDZ Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship 23 December 2003 12 January 2008 - } ==References *Official website of the Croatian Government *Chronology of Croatian cabinets at Hidra.hr Sanader, 1 Category:2003 establishments in Croatia Category:2008 disestablishments in Croatia Category:Cabinets established in 2003 Category:Cabinets disestablished in 2008 ","title":"Cabinet of Ivo Sanader I"},{"id":"20456332","text":"Viktors ArƒÅjs (13 January 1910 ‚Äì 13 January 1988) was a Latvian/Baltic German collaborator and Nazi SS officer, who took part in the Holocaust during the German occupation of Latvia and Belarus (then called White Russia or White Ruthenia) as the leader of the Arajs Kommando. The Arajs Kommando murdered about half of Latvia's Jews. Klee, Das Personenlexicon zum Dritten Reich, at page 18 == Life == Viktors Bernhard ArƒÅjs was born on 13 January 1910 in the town of Baldone, then part of the Russian Empire. His father was a Latvian blacksmith and his mother came from a wealthy family of Baltic Germans. ArƒÅjs attended Jelgava Gymnasium, which he left in 1930 for mandatory national defense service in the Latvian Army. In 1932, ArƒÅjs studied law at the University of Latvia in Riga, but completed his degree only in 1941 after the Soviet occupation. He was a member of the elite student fraternity \\"Lettonia\\", which may have helped him get a job with the Latvian police after he left the university. ArƒÅjs remained with the Latvian police until he left the service in 1938.Lumans, Latvia in World War II, at page 239. During the Ulmanis dictatorship in Latvia 1934‚Äì1940, ArƒÅjs was a \\"low ranking provincial police officer\\" who, as a loyal administrator, dutifully \\"distanced himself officially from the Pƒìrkonkrusts\\", the ultra-nationalist party in Latvia. Marƒ£ers Vestermanis (Leiter des Museum \\"Juden in Lettland\\" in Riga): Rezension zu \\"Der Tod des Henkers von Riga\\". In: Newsletter des Fritz Bauer Institut, Nr. 18 vom Fr√ºhjahr 2000. == Activities during World War II == The war between Germany and the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941. Shortly afterwards, the Red Army abandoned Riga to the advancing Wehrmacht. ArƒÅjs then took over an abandoned police precinct house at 19 ValdemƒÅra Street. ArƒÅjs' future commanders, Franz Stahlecker and Robert Stieglitz, had with them a Latvian translator, Hans Dressler, whom ArƒÅjs had known in high school and in the Latvian army. Because of this friendship, ArƒÅjs was introduced to Stahlecker, got on their best side, and gained their trust. Braune Helden ArƒÅjs recruited the core of his troops from his student fraternity and Pƒìrkonkrusts. On 2 July ArƒÅjs learned from Stahlecker during a conference that his unit had to unleash a pogrom that was supposed to appear spontaneous. On 4 July 1941, the German leadership turned loose \\"Security Group ArƒÅjs\\", generally referred to as the ArƒÅjs Kommando or Special Commando (Sonderkommando) ArƒÅjs. On the same day, the Germans ran a recruiting advertisement in the occupation-controlled Latvian language newspaper Tƒìvija (Latvian:: Fatherland): \\"To all patriotic Latvians, Pƒìrkonkrusts members, Students, Officers, Militiamen, and Citizens, who are ready to actively take part in the cleansing of our country of undesirable elements\\" should enroll themselves at the office of the Security Group at 19 ValdemƒÅra Street. Zeitung \\"Tƒìvija\\" vom 4.7.1941 On 4 July ArƒÅjs and his henchmen trapped about 20 Jews, who had not been able to take flight before the advancing Germans, in the Riga Synagogue on Gogoƒºa Street. There they were burnt alive while hand grenades were thrown through the windows. The ArƒÅjs commando consisted of 500‚Äì1500 volunteers. The unit murdered approximately 26,000 people, first in Latvia and then in Belarus. ArƒÅjs was promoted to police major in 1942, and in 1943 to SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer. Herberts Cukurs, the former Latvian pilot, was the adjutant to ArƒÅjs. Arajs Kommando were notorious for their ill treatment of women. Viktors ArƒÅjs raped a Jewish woman, Zelma Shepshelovitz, during the war. Her testimony served a crucial part in the trials of war criminals. == Post-war == Until 1949, ArƒÅjs was interned in a British prisoner-of-war camp in Germany. After that he is rumored in some sources to have worked as a driver for the British in the British military government in Delmenhorst, then in the British Zone of Occupation, but Richards Plavnieks, who extensively researched ArƒÅjs' life, believes this to be false. With assistance from the Latvian government-in- exile in London, ArƒÅjs took on the cover name of Victor (Viktors) Zeibots. He worked in Frankfurt am Main as an assistant at a printing company. On 21 December 1979, ArƒÅjs was found guilty in the State Court of Hamburg (Landgericht Hamburg) of having on 8 December 1941 conducted the Jews of the greater Riga Ghetto to their deaths by the mass shootings in the Rumbula forest. For participation in the murder of 13,000 people, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Justiz und NS-Verbrechen, Verfahren Nr. 856, LG Hamburg 791221. In 1988, ArƒÅjs died in solitary confinement in a prison in Kassel.Press, The Murder of the Jews in Latvia: 1941‚Äì1945, page 70. == Notes  References == * Braune Helden (russ.) * Klee, Ernst, Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich.

The powerhouse made possible the subway system between New Jersey and New York for the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (which became PATH in 1963). The powerhouse was closed in 1929 and used as a storage place for railroad equipment. In the 1990s, the building was cited by Preservation New Jersey as one of the state's ten most endangered historic sites. The powerhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 23, 2001.

Efforts to stabilize the powerhouse from further deterioration began July 2009 and continued through 2010. In 2011 the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed to transfer its 55% ownership of the building to its co-owner, Jersey City, in exchange for a nearby lot where they will build an underground electric sub-station.

The state secretary of health is a constitutional or at times a statutory official in several states of the United States. The position is the chief executive official for the state's state health agency (or equivalent), chief administrative officer for the state's Board of Health (or equivalent), or both. Following passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, during the first ten years of the program the state health departments were given new and important roles under the law. Due to new grants available, they had enhanced their programs and had many more resources to oversee and help utilities come into compliance with drinking water standards, and they were able to develop other related activities like the capacity for doing risk assessments on new contaminants of concern.EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, Video, Transcript (see p23). == Terminology == Although the vast majority of these agencies are officially called \\"departments,\\" the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials adopted \\"state health agency\\" as the generic term to reflect the fact that a substantial number of these agencies are no longer state \\"departments\\" in the traditional sense of a cabinet-level organizational unit dedicated exclusively to public health. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, at least 20 states and the District of Columbia merged these departments with other government agencies that provide social services, welfare, or other types of unrelated services. The result is that in those jurisdictions, the state government agency that actually provides public health services is but one of several units inside a large cabinet-level agency. == Responsibilities == State health departments have different names and responsibilities; in some states they are top-level administrative agencies, while in other states they are a division or bureau of another office. Health departments are usually responsible for public health, including preventive medicine, epidemiology, vaccinations, environmental health (sometimes including health inspections), and the licensing of health care professionals; the collection and archiving of vital records such as birth and death certificates and sometimes marriage and divorce certificates; health statistics; developmental disabilities; mental health; occupational safety and health; receiving and recording reports of notifiable diseases; and tobacco control. In some states, state health departments may additionally be responsible for social services and welfare, environmental protection/pollution control, or the operation of the state psychiatric hospital. Some states have a Surgeon General. ==State health agencies (SHAs)== The following are state health agencies as identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: {  - ! State ! SHA !

Frank Baum, the creator of the Land of Oz series of children's books. The stories (animal tales, comparable to Aesop's Fables or the Just-So Stories and Jungle Book of Rudyard Kipling) first received magazine publication in 1905. For several decades in the twentieth century, the collection was a \\"lost\\" book by Baum; it resurfaced when the International Wizard of Oz Club published the stories in one volume in 1969.L. Frank Baum, Animal Fairy Tales, Introduction by Russell P. McFall; Hong Kong, International Wizard of Oz Club and Opium Books, 1969; second edition, International Wizard of Oz Club, 1989. The nine stories in the collection were printed in consecutive monthly issues of The Delineator (a popular women's magazine of the time) from January to September 1905. The tales were part of the magazine's regular feature, \\"Stories and Pastimes for Children\\", and primarily illustrated by Charles Livingston Bull;Animal Fairy Tales, 1989, Introduction, p. 5. The Delineator published Baum's story \\"A Kidnapped Santa Claus\\" in December 1904 with illustrations by Frederick Richardson, who had begun illustrating Baum's serialized novel Queen Zixi of Ix the previous month in St. Nicholas. Baum favored book publication for the stories; when his health declined in 1918, he worked to prepare books for future publication in the event of his death. Baum readied three manuscripts, so his publisher (Reilly & Britton) could issue annual Baum books through 1921. Two of those books were the last two in his Oz series (The Magic of Oz and Glinda of Oz), which were published in 1919 and 1920; the third book was Animal Fairy Tales.L. Frank Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, Edited with an Introduction and Notes by Michael Patrick Hearn; revised edition, New York, W. W. Norton, 2000; Introduction, p. lxxxiv. It is unknown why Reilly & Britton did not publish the latter. ==Contents== The collection consists of: * \\"Prologue\\" (originally published January 1905) * \\"The Story of Jaglon\\" (January 1905) * \\"The Stuffed Alligator\\" (February 1905) * \\"The Discontented Gopher\\" (March 1905) * \\"The Forest Oracle\\" (April 1905) * \\"The Enchanted Buffalo\\" (May 1905) * \\"The Pea-Green Poodle\\" (June 1905) * \\"The Jolly Giraffe of Jomb\\" (July 1905) * \\"The Troubles of Pop Wombat\\" (August 1905) * \\"The Transformation of Bayal the Porcupine\\" (September 1905) Of the stories, \\"The Enchanted Buffalo\\" is the most-frequently anthologized.As in: Masterpieces of Fantasy and Wonder, Compiled by David G. Hartwell, New York, Doubleday, 1989; and The American Fantasy Tradition, Edited by Brian M. Thomsen, New York, Macmillan, 2003. The stories were probably written in 1903 and 1904; they resemble other animal tales that Baum wrote during the same period, some of which appeared in his American Fairy Tales (1901), The Twinkle Tales (1906) and as episodes in his novels.Animal Fairy Tales, 1989, Introduction, pp. 5-6. Baum's animal tales employ his highly-imaginative style (influenced by his interest in theosophy), and differ from the more-naturalistic tales of contemporaries such as Albert Bigelow Paine. In \\"The Story of Jaglon,\\" for example, an orphaned tiger is raised by \\"tiger fairies.\\" In 1953, Oz author Jack Snow's expansion of this story (entitled Jaglon and the Tiger Fairies) was published with illustrations by Dale Ulrey. This was the first in a series of expanded versions of all nine stories planned by Reilly & Lee, but the other eight were never published. Baum wrote another story for the collection; entitled \\"The Tiger's Eye\\", it is a grim, harsh story about evil magic enchanting animals and men which was not printed until 1962.

The words are put to the melody of the Scottish Minstrel \\"Common' Frae The Town\\". This is a variant of the tune to which Auld Lang Syne is usually sung‚Äîthe melodic shape is almost identical, the difference lying in the tempo and rhythm. == Origin and meaning == Drakemyre, Dalry G. W. Napier, in an 1876 Notes and Queries, wrote that, The protagonist, \\"Jenny\\", is not further identified, but there has been reference to a \\"Jenny from Dalry\\" and a longstanding legend in the Drakemyre suburb of the town of Dalry, North Ayrshire, holds that \\"comin thro' the rye\\" describes crossing a ford through the Rye Water at Drakemyre to the north of the town, downstream from Ryefield House and not far from the confluence of the Rye with the River Garnock. When this story appeared in the Glasgow Herald in 1867, it was soon disputed with the assertion that everyone understood the rye to be a field of rye, wet with dew, which also fits better with other stanzas that substitute \\"wheat\\" and \\"grain\\" for \\"rye\\". An alternative suggestion is that \\"the rye\\" was a long narrow cobblestone paved lane, prone to puddles of water. While the original poem is already full of sexual imagery, an alternative version makes this more explicit. It has a different chorus, referring to a phallic \\"staun o' staunin' graith\\" (roughly \\"an erection of astonishing size\\"), \\"kiss\\" is replaced by \\"fuck\\", and Jenny's \\"thing\\" in stanza four is identified as her \\"cunt\\". ==Burns' Lyrics== *weet ‚Äì wet *draigl't ‚Äì draggled *gin ‚Äì given, in the sense of \\"if\\" *cry ‚Äì call out [for help] *warl ‚Äì world *ken ‚Äì know *ain ‚Äì own ==Lyrics usually sung (\\"Ilka lassie\\")== Even the \\"cleaner\\" version of the Burns lyrics is quite bawdy, and it is this one, or an \\"Anglized\\" version of it, that is most commonly \\"covered\\". ==The Catcher in the Rye== The title of the novel The Catcher in the Rye (1951) by J. D. Salinger comes from the poem's name. Holden Caulfield, the protagonist, misinterprets a part of this poem to mean \\"if a body catch a body\\" rather than \\"if a body meet a body.\\" He keeps picturing children playing in a field of rye near the edge of a cliff, and him catching them when they start to fall off. ==Cover versions== *The first recording of the song was made in 1912 by Marcella Sembrich. \\"Comin' thro' the rye, Marcella Sembrich, Discography of American Historical Recordings, University of California: Santa Barbara Library *The song was covered by Marian Anderson in 1944 *The song was covered by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1956 as \\"Rockin' Through The Rye\\". Bill Haley had updated the lyrics to a more 1950's hip slang (included the lyrics, \\"All the lassies rock with me when rockin' through the rye\\"). In Sept 1956, when the record was climbing the UK charts, the single was banned by the BBC from its playlist because they felt the song went against traditional British standards. Nevertheless, the record peaked at No. 3 on the UK charts. *The song is covered by Alvin and the Chipmunks for their 1960 album Around the World with The Chipmunks. *Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961) *The song was sung by The Real McKenzies for their 2005 album 10,000 Shots. *The song is sung by Ava Gardner in the 1953 John Ford film Mogambo.1 The song sung by Ava Gardner in the 1953 John Ford film Mogambo *Jo Stafford covered the song on her album Songs of Scotland.http://www.allmusic.com/album/songs-of- scotland-r26476/credits *The song was parodied by Allan Sherman on his 1963 album My Son, the Celebrity. *The song is sung by Julie London on her 1959 album, Swing Me an Old Song. *Eddi Reader, Sings the Songs of Robert Burns (Deluxe Edition), 2009. ==References * Digitised copy of Comin' thro' the rye in James Johnson's Scots Musical Museum , \\"Written for this Work by Robert Burns\\", printed between 1787 and 1803.

The Execution of Isaac Hayne. Lexington, South Carolina: The Sandlapper Store, 1977 ==Biography== At the beginning of the War of Independence Hayne joined the rebellion, and was a commissioned a captain of artillery, and at the same time state senator. In 1780, on the invasion of the state by the British, he served in a cavalry regiment during the final siege of Charleston, and, being included in the capitulation of that place, was paroled on condition that he would not serve against the British while they held possession of the city. When in 1781 the fortunes of the British began to decline, he, with all the others who were paroled on the same terms, was required to join the royal army or be subjected to close confinement. Hayne would gladly have accepted imprisonment, but his wife and several of his children lay at the point of death from smallpox. He went to Charleston, and, being assured by the deputy British commandant, Patterson, that he would not be required to bear arms against his former compatriots, took the oath of allegiance. After the successes of General Greene had left the British nothing but Charleston, Hayne was summoned to join the royal army immediately. This being in violation of the agreement that had been made, he considered that this released him from all his obligations to the British. He went to the American camp, and was commissioned colonel of a militia company. Hayne then commanded an American rebel raid which captured Brigadier-General Andrew Williamson, an American Loyalist. Colonel Nisbet Balfour, the British commander in Charleston during the 1781 siege of Charlestown, fearing that Williamson would be hanged as a traitor, sent a column to intercept the raiding party. The interception was successful. There was a skirmish resulting in the defeat of the raiding party, the release of Williamson and the capture of Hayne. Hayne, although a prisoner of war, was sentenced to death by hanging by the British, because in the opinion of the British court martial, he had broken his earlier parole not to take up arms against the Crown. His sentence was carried out in Charleston on August 4, after which Hayne was buried on the family property in Jacksonboro. ==Further reading== * * ==Notes References == * Newspaper article about the capture of Williamson and Hayne from the Rivington's Gazette, August 1, 1881: \\"July 1.‚ÄîLast Thursday night a small party of mounted rebel militia ...\\" Attribution * Category:1745 births Category:1781 deaths Category:Executed people from South Carolina Category:American Revolutionary War executions Category:South Carolina militiamen in the American Revolution Category:People executed by the British military by hanging Category:People executed by the Kingdom of Great Britain Category:18th-century executions of American people Category:Deaths by hanging ","title":"Isaac Hayne"},{"id":"20457035","text":"Karnaaj Rally is a racing and vehicular combat game for the Game Boy Advance handheld video game console.

He had previously served as Secretary of Homeland Security in the Trump administration. Kelly enlisted in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War and was commissioned as an officer near the end of college. He rose through the ranks, eventually serving in his last military post from 2012 to 2016 as the four-star General leading United States Southern Command, the unified combatant command responsible for American military operations in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Kelly was selected as the first Secretary of Homeland Security in the Trump administration. Kelly earned a reputation for being an aggressive enforcer of immigration law. After six months, he was selected to replace Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff in an attempt to bring more stability to the White House. He was the first career military officer to serve in the position since Alexander Haig during the Nixon and Ford Administrations. Prior to joining the Trump administration in January 2017, Kelly had been on the board of advisors of DC Capital Partners, an investment firm that now owns Caliburn. Following his departure from the White House in January 2019, Kelly joined the board of directors for Caliburn International.

Before he reached the age of 16, he hitchhiked to Washington state and rode the trains back, including a freight-hop from Seattle to Chicago. He then served for one year in the United States Merchant Marine, where he says \\"my first time overseas was taking 10,000 tons of beer to Vietnam\\". In 1970, when his mother told him that his draft number was coming up, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. He served in an infantry company with the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and was discharged to the inactive reserve as a sergeant in 1972 so that he could attend college. He returned to active duty with the Marines in 1975, completed Officer Candidates School, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on December 27, 1975. In 1976, he graduated from the University of Massachusetts Boston and in 1984, he received a Master of Arts degree in National Security Affairs from the Georgetown School of Foreign Service.

Kelly testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee In 1999, Kelly transferred to joint duty and served as the special assistant to the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, in Mons, Belgium. He returned to the United States in 2001 and was assigned to a third tour of duty at Camp Lejeune, now as the assistant chief of staff G-3 with the Second Marine Division. In 2002, Kelly again served with the 1st Marine Division, this time as the assistant division commander. Much of Kelly's two- year assignment was spent deployed in Iraq. In March 2003, while in Iraq, Kelly was promoted to brigadier general, which was the first known promotion of a Marine Corps colonel in an active combat zone since that of another First Marine Division assistant division commander, Chesty Puller, in January 1951. In April 2003, Kelly took command of the newly formed Task Force Tripoli and drove it north from Baghdad into Samarra and Tikrit. Kelly has stated that during the initial assault on Baghdad he was asked by a reporter for The Los Angeles Times if, considering the size of the Iraqi Army and the vast supplies of tanks, artillery and chemical weapons available to Saddam's forces, he would ever consider defeat. Kelly's response, as recounted by him at a 2007 San Diego Military Advisory Council networking breakfast, was, \\"hell these are Marines. Men like them held Guadalcanal and took Iwo Jima, Baghdad ain't shit.\\" [sic] Kelly briefing reporters at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia His next assignment was as legislative assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Michael Hagee. In January 2007, Kelly was nominated for major general, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on September 11, 2007.

Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command on November 19, 2012. In a May 2014 speech regarding the War on Terror, Kelly said: > If you think this war against our way of life is over because some of the > self-appointed opinion-makers and chattering class grow 'war weary,' because > they want to be out of Iraq or Afghanistan, you are mistaken. This enemy is > dedicated to our destruction. He will fight us for generations, and the > conflict will move through various phases as it has since 9/11. Kelly was succeeded as commander by Navy Admiral Kurt W. Tidd on January 14, 2016. ==Secretary of Homeland Security== Kelly is ceremonially sworn in prior to President Trump's speech at DHS Headquarters on January 25, 2017. Kelly was actually sworn in five days prior. On December 7, 2016, then President-elect Donald Trump nominated Kelly to head the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a cabinet-level position. People familiar with the transition said that Trump's team was drawn to Kelly because of his southwest border expertise. On January 20, 2017, Kelly was confirmed as Secretary of Homeland Security by the United States Senate with a vote of 88‚Äì11. On that evening, he was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence. In an April 2017 speech at George Washington University, Kelly said, \\"If lawmakers do not like the laws they've passed and we are charged to enforce, then they should have the courage and skill to change the laws. Otherwise they should shut up and support the men and women on the front lines.\\" Kelly indicated days into the administration his interest in having the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border wall completed within two years. On April 21, 2017, Kelly said the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border wall would begin construction \\"by the end of the summer.\\" Two days later, Kelly said he believed \\"a border wall is essential\\" as there were \\"tremendous threats\\" such as drugs and individuals coming into the US. On May 2, Kelly stated his surprise in office holders \\"rejoicing in the fact that the wall will be slower to be built and, consequently, the southwest border under less control than it could be.\\" In May 2017, Kelly said of terrorism, \\"It's everywhere. It's constant. It's nonstop. The good news for us in America is we have amazing people protecting us every day. But it can happen here almost anytime.\\" He said that the threat from terrorism was so severe that some people would \\"never leave the house\\" if they knew the truth. In July, Kelly allegedly blocked Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke from taking a position in the DHS, though it was never confirmed. ===Assessment of tenure=== Of his tenure as Secretary of Homeland Security, USA Today wrote, \\"Kelly oversaw some of the most controversial policies of Trump's agenda, including a travel ban targeting several majority-Muslim countries, a reduction in refugee admissions and stepped-up deportations of undocumented immigrants.\\" According to the New Yorker, Kelly left the D.H.S. with a > reputation as one of the most aggressive enforcers of immigration law in > recent American history. His record belies the short length of his tenure. > In six months, Kelly eliminated guidelines that governed federal immigration > agents' work; vastly expanded the categories of immigrants being targeted > for deportation; threatened to abandon the Obama-era program that grants > legal status to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as > children; and has even broached the idea of splitting up mothers and > children at the border to \\"deter\\" people from coming to the U.S. The D.H.S. under Kelly \\"became one of the few branches of the federal government that has been both willing and able to execute Trump's policy priorities.\\" Unlike other agency heads, Kelly did not clash with Trump. ==White House Chief of Staff== MSC 2017 Trump appointed Kelly to the post of White House Chief of Staff on July 28, 2017, replacing Reince Priebus. Priebus's ousting and Kelly's appointment followed an internal power struggle within the White House. Kelly took office on July 31, 2017. That same day, with Trump's approval, Kelly removed Anthony Scaramucci from his role as communications director, just ten days after Scaramucci was appointed to that role. Reportedly, Kelly had requested permission to remove Scaramucci after \\"Scaramucci had boasted about reporting directly to the president, not the chief of staff.\\" On August 18, 2017, Kelly removed Steve Bannon from his role as White House Chief Strategist, on behalf of President Trump. Early into his tenure, media outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and FiveThirtyEight speculated that Kelly would bring moderation and discipline to the White House. In August 2017, early into Kelly's tenure, the Washington Post wrote that Kelly had \\"left no discernible imprint on the White House's philosophy\\" and that it was unclear if he would bring calm and rigor to the White House. In a lengthy article on Kelly's tenure, the New York Times in October 2017 wrote that \\"for all of the talk of Mr. Kelly as a moderating force and the so-called grown-up in the room, it turns out that he harbors strong feelings on patriotism, national security and immigration that mirror the hard-line views of his outspoken boss.\\" By February 2018, Kelly had emerged as a hardliner on several issues (immigration, in particular) and been embroiled in a number of controversies, and there were reports of pressure on Kelly to resign.Pressure grows on John Kelly amid reports he offered to resign The Guardian When Donald Trump arrived in Singapore in June 2018 for the North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit, the New York Times reported that Kelly had told a recent group of visiting senators the White House was \\"a miserable place to work.\\" The reported comment renewed months-long speculation that Kelly would resign from his job of White House Chief of Staff. According to several news outlets in early 2018, Kelly's influence in the White House had been diminished and Trump made several key decisions without his presence. On December 7, 2018, CNN and others reported that Kelly and Trump were no longer on speaking terms and that Kelly was expected to resign in the coming days. On December 8, Trump announced that Kelly would be leaving at the end of the year. On December 14, 2018, the White House announced that Mick Mulvaney would replace John Kelly as the White House Chief of Staff. ===Controversies=== DC Capital Partners conflict of interest In January 2017, The Intercept reported that Kelly failed to disclose his position as vice-chair on the Spectrum Group, a defense contractor lobbying firm, on his ethics, form while taking a position at the department of homeland security. Kelly's membership on the board of DC Capital Partners and its for-profit detention facilities at the Southern Border and Florida, operated by its subsidiary Caliburn International had called into question his neutrality as they have been described as private for-profit concentration camps. Caliburn CEO James Van Dusen said, \\"With four decades of military and humanitarian leadership, in-depth understanding of international affairs and knowledge of current economic drivers around the world, General Kelly is a strong strategic addition to our team.\\" Candidates in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries objected, including Cory Booker who said Kelly's actions in joining the board were \\"disgusting,\\" with Elizabeth Warren calling his role, \\"corruption at its absolute worst.\\"Ex-Trump aide joins company that operates largest facility detaining undocumented kids, Fox 11, Adriana Gomez Licon (AP), May 3, 2019. Retrieved December 14, 2019. In July 2019, the House Oversight Committee announced it was probing Kelly's conflict of interest in the camps while he was the White House Chief of Staff. Frederica Wilson dispute In October 2017, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson (D-FL) criticized Trump for his phone call to the widow of a slain U.S. soldier, saying his remarks had been insensitive. Wilson had been in the widow's car when Mr. Trump had called her. A few days later, Kelly held a press briefing where he defended Trump's phone call, which he had overheard, saying Trump \\"expressed his condolences in the best way that he could.\\" Kelly harshly criticized Wilson, calling her \\"the empty barrel that makes the most noise\\" and stating that in a 2015 speech Wilson had \\"stood up\\" to inappropriately claim credit for securing federal funding for an FBI building in her district. Video of her 2015 speech showed his description to be inaccurate. Later that month, while in an interview with conservative commentator Laura Ingraham, Kelly said he stood by his comments on Wilson and would \\"never\\" apologize for his comments. Kelly said he would \\"talk about before her comments and at the reception afterwards\\" as a \\"package deal\\", but refused to elaborate further. Civil War remarks In the same October 2017 interview with Laura Ingraham, Kelly said that \\"the lack of ability to compromise led to the Civil War.\\" He also described Robert E. Lee as an \\"honorable man\\" who \\"gave up ... his country to fight for his state,\\" and claimed, \\"men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had to make their stand.\\" Several historians of the Civil War described Kelly's remarks as ignorant, and as a misuse of history reminiscent of Lost Cause mythology. They also broadly reject Kelly's remark that a failure to compromise led to the Civil War, noting that the war was predominantly fought over slavery and that a number of compromises on slavery were made in the lead-up to the war. The White House defended Kelly's remarks, citing non-fiction writer and historian Shelby Foote. DACA remarks On February 6, 2018, Kelly made recorded remarks concerning a discrepancy between how many had enrolled in DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and how many were to be offered a path to citizenship, by saying \\"The difference between 690 [thousand] and 1.8 million were the people that some would say were too afraid to sign up; others would say are too lazy to get off their asses, but they didn't sign up\\". Firing of White House aide Rob Porter On February 7, 2018, White House staff secretary Rob Porter resigned in the wake of reports that his two ex-wives accused him of domestic abuse, allegations that Porter said are false and \\"a coordinated smear campaign\\". One ex-wife had a protective order from 2010 against Porter, and the other had photographic evidence of the alleged abuse. The protective order had prevented Porter from obtaining a full security clearance, though the order's associated ex-wife said Porter's \\"integrity and ability to do his job is impeccable\\". According to an unnamed senior administration official, Kelly was aware of the protective order and the domestic abuse allegations, and had promoted Porter within the White House. Approached by media about the allegations, Kelly initially praised Porter, saying he was a \\"man of true integrity and honor, and I can't say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him.\\" Per an unnamed White House official, Porter resigned over the objections of Kelly, who had worked closely with Porter since becoming White House Chief of Staff. In a February 8 email to White House staff, Kelly wrote, \\"While we are all processing the shocking and troubling allegations made against a former White House staffer, I want you to know that we all take matters of domestic violence very seriously. Domestic violence is abhorrent and has no place in our society\\". On February 9, 2018, The Washington Post reported that Kelly had instructed senior staff and aides to tell reporters that Kelly took immediate action to fire Porter upon hearing that domestic abuse allegations were credible; the Post noted this \\"version of events contradicts both the public record and accounts from numerous other White House officials in recent days as the Porter drama unfolded.\\" Kelly told reporters on March 2, 2018 that he sought Porter's resignation immediately after learning of the accusations on February 6 and regretted his handling of Porter's departure. Firing of Omarosa Manigault In August 2018, a tape was released of Kelly firing White House staffer Omarosa Manigault in the Situation Room, and allegedly threatening her legally as well as reputationally, stating to the employee: \\"I'd like to see this be a friendly departure,\\" Kelly says on the tape. \\"There are pretty significant legal issues that we hope don't develop into something that, that'll make it ugly for you.\\" When questioned whether the President knew of the firing, Kelly replied: \\"The [White House] staff, and everybody on the staff, works for me and not the president.\\" Kelly's use of the Situation Room to isolate and fire the employee also led to controversy about potential misuse of the high-security facility by Kelly, as well as the fact he was unknowingly recorded within it. ==Personal life== Kelly has been married to Karen Hernest since 1976. They raised three children together: Robert, John Jr., and Kathleen. On November 9, 2010, Kelly's 29-year-old son, First Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action when he stepped on a landmine while leading a platoon of Marines on a patrol in Sangin, Afghanistan. The younger Kelly was a former enlisted Marine and was on his third combat tour, his first combat tour as a U.S. Marine Corps infantry officer. At the time of his death, Robert Kelly was with Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. Robert Kelly's death made John Kelly the highest-ranking American military officer to lose a child in Iraq or Afghanistan. Kelly's other son is a Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel. ==Military awards== Kelly's military decorations and awards: { colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" -  21px22px  22px22px22px -     -  18px18px  18px18px -  18px18px18px   - 18px18px18px18px  106px  - colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"125px } {  colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"Defense Distinguished Service Medal - Defense Superior Service Medal Legion of Merit w/ Gold Star and Combat \\"V\\" Meritorious Service Medal w/ Gold Star Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal w/ 3 Gold Stars - Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal Navy Combat Action Ribbon Navy Presidential Unit Citation Joint Meritorious Unit Award w/ Oak Leaf Cluster - Navy Unit Commendation Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation w/ 2 Bronze Stars Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal National Defense Service Medal w/ 2 Bronze Stars - Southwest Asia Service Medal w/ Bronze Star Iraq Campaign Medal w/ 3 Bronze Stars Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal Global War on Terrorism Service Medal - Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon w/ 4 Bronze Stars Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon Grand Officer of the Order of San Carlos (Colombia) Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait) - colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge } ==See alsoReferences *Biography at U.S. Department of Defense * * - - Category:1950 births Category:American Marine Corps personnel of the Iraq War Category:American people of Campanian descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Catholics from Massachusetts Category:School of Foreign Service alumni Category:Living people Category:Military personnel from Massachusetts Category:People from Boston Category:Recipients of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Defense Superior Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Trump administration cabinet members Category:United States Marines Category:United States Marine Corps generals Category:United States Secretaries of Homeland Security Category:University of Massachusetts Boston alumni Category:White House Chiefs of Staff Category:Recipients of the Meritorious Service Medal (United States) ","title":"John F.

Captain Dugald McLachlan established Glengower station, sometimes employing the local aborigines from the Dja Dja Wurrung (Jaara people). His employees also gave out flour and sugar rations to aborigines on occasion. There is speculation that the massacre happened after the station hands found the cook hanging from a meat hook near the kitchen at the end of the day. Later the aborigines who had passed through on their way home were found at Middle Creek, a camping place on the aboriginal trading route from the Grampians to the Greenstone quarry at Mount William near Lancefield. The aborigines were found at the waterhole on Middle Creek west of Glengower Station. The aborigines sought to hide by diving into the waterhole, where they were shot one at a time as they came up for air.Aldo Massola, p88, Journey to Aboriginal Victoria, Rigby, 1969 as quoted by Ian D.

With Chomedahue --in the commune of Santa Cruz-- as their origin, they were dedicated to the investigation of Chilean and Latin American folklore interpreting its songs with the typical instruments of each country having in its presentations more of sixty different musical instruments played by themselves which were interchanged according to each country and region. They gave numerous concerts in the U.S.A. ( 92 concerts), Mexico as in the rest of Latin America. They recorded more than thirteen longplays two of them made in Mexico with music from Chile and also from Latin America. Some of them are Arreo en el Viento, Nostagia Colchaguina, An image of Chile, Latino America folkloric Panorama (2 discs), Los de Ramon in Family, Chilean Mass and others. They received several prizes in Chile as in Mexico and made popular many songs of Raul de Ramon like The Curanto, Rosa Colorada, Nostalgia Colchaguina, Camino de Soledad, Cancion de la Caballeria among others. They were the first in Chile in using the typical instruments of each country influencing in other musical groups that adopted this initiative later. They became part of the traditional folkloric music that gave impulse to Chilean music. They also created a Restaurant named El Alero de Los de Ramon, destinated to the diffusion of folkloric music and their traditions. They also contribute in the creation of new folkloric musical groups such as Los Cantores de Santa Cruz and Los de Santiago among others.

It is located at Hospital Road, Concord West, New South Wales, Australia. The historic buildings housing the facility are listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register. ==Description and history== Rivendell Unit was originally located at Broughton Hall, Lilyfield, before being relocated to Concord West in 1977. Its founding director was Dr Marie Bashir, later to become Governor of New South Wales. Dr Bashir was replaced by Professor Joseph Rey in 1988. Sydney South West Area Health Service:Retrieved 11 January 2009 Rivendell is, as of 2009, a twenty- bed facility offering mental health services for children and adolescents in the Sydney area and rural New South Wales. Care is provided on both an outpatient and inpatient basis. Around five hundred children and their families are helped by Rivendell each year. Rivendell is a teaching hospital of the University of Sydney. The Concord West premises are located on the banks of the Parramatta River and were originally known as the Thomas Walker Hospital. They were designed by Sir John Sulman and built from 1891-93 by A.M.Allan. The money came from the will of the philanthropist Thomas Walker, who had lived in the Italianate mansion Yaralla, also located at Concord West (and now known as the Dame Eadith Walker Hospital). The buildings are made of brick and sandstone, which is characteristic of the Federation Free Classical style.A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperley (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.104 They feature marble fireplaces and cedar joinery, and are considered an important example of John Sulman's work. They are now listed on the Register of the National Estate.

The book has 72 short discourses. ==Description The title and origin of the book === According to J. M. Sadeghi the title \\"Fihi ma fihi\\" has appeared on a copy dated 1316. Another copy of the book dated 1350 has the title Asrar al-jalalieh. Rumi himself in the fifth volume of Masnavi-i Ma'navi mentions that which most likely refers to this book. The title Maghalat-e Mowlana of copies of the book published in Iran follows this. Not much is known about the publication time and the writer of the book. According to B. Forouzanfar, the editor of the most reliable copy of the book, it is likely that the book was written by Sultanwalad, the eldest son of Rumi, based on manuscripts and notes taken by himself or others from the lectures of his father on Masnavi-i Ma'navi. In the Essence of Rumi, John Baldock states that Fihi Mafihi was one of Rumi's discourses written towards the end of his life. Rumi lived from 1207 to 1273 so Fihi Mafihi was likely written some time between 1260 and 1273 by Rumi himself. ==Significance== This book is one of the first Persian prose books after the so-called Persian literature revolution (enghelƒÅb-e adabi). Moreover, the book has become an introduction to the Masnavi. Also many concepts in Sufism are described in this book in simple terms. == English translations == The book has been (freely) translated into English under the title Discourses of Rumi by A. J. Arberry in 1961 and consists of 71 discourses. An authoritative translation by Dr. Bankey Behari was published in 1998 under the title Fiha Ma Fiha, Table Talk of Maulani Rumi (DK Publishers, New Delhi), . ==See also== *Masnavi *Pervane ==Notes * Discourses of Rumi (PDF; 695 KB) Category:Sufi literature Category:Persian books Category:Works by Rumi ","title":"Fihi Ma Fihi"},{"id":"20457263","text":"Randall Glenn Johnson (born June 10, 1956) is a former Major League Baseball third baseman.

East Fork Dairy Creek begins at in Columbia County, slightly north of its border with Washington County, and flows generally south for . West Fork Dairy Creek, also about long, forms at , near the unincorporated community of Tophill, and flows generally southeast. Before railroads displaced river boats on the Tualatin, some steamships also worked the lower section of Dairy Creek, with plans to go as far up stream as Centerville. ==CourseMain stem=== The roughly main stem of Dairy Creek begins at at the confluence of its east and west forks. Flowing southeast, it receives Council Creek from the right from the mouth and McKay Creek from the left less than later. It passes under Oregon Route 8 (Tualatin Valley Highway) west of Hillsboro about from the mouth before entering the Tualatin River about from its confluence with the Willamette River. ===West Fork=== For roughly its first , West Fork Dairy Creek flows south from near Tophill in northwestern Washington County. It passes under Oregon Route 47 twice, receives Cummings Creek from the right and Williams Creek from the left, and passes slightly west of Buxton from the main stem. Shortly thereafter, it crosses under U.S. Route 26 (Sunset Highway) and turns southeast. Running parallel to and south of Route 26 and the concurrent Route 47 for about , it receives Burgholzer Creek from the right and Mendenhall Creek from the left, before again passing under Route 26, still concurrent with Route 47. Flowing parallel to and north of the highway for about another , West Fork Dairy Creek receives Whitcher Creek from the left, Kuder Creek from the right, and Garrigus Creek from the left before flowing south under Route 26 for the third and last time from the confluence of the east and west forks. The west fork passes under Route 47, no longer concurrent with Route 26, from the confluence. Shortly thereafter, the stream flows by Banks, which lies to its left. Below Banks, the stream receives Cedar Canyon Creek from the right, passes under Oregon Route 6 at from the confluence, turns east about later and flows under Route 47 again. It receives Lousignont Canal from the right about from the confluence before joining the East Fork Dairy Fork to form the main stem. ===East Fork=== From its headwaters, East Fork Dairy Creek flows south for less than through Columbia County before entering Washington County from its confluence with the west fork. Over its next , it receives Campbell Creek and Roundy Creek, both from the right, Panther Creek and Rock Creek, both from the left, Denny Creek from the right, Plentywater Creek and Meadow Brook Creek, both from the left, and Murtaugh Creek and Big Canyon, both from the right. At from the confluence, the stream passes United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauge 14205400. East Fork Dairy Creek flows under U.S. Route 26 about later. About downstream from Route 26, it receives Bledsoe Creek from the right before joining West Fork Dairy Creek to form the main stem. ===Discharge=== Creek at Dairy Creek Park in Hillsboro The USGS monitors the flow of East Fork Dairy Creek at a station near the unincorporated community of Meacham Corner, from the confluence with the west fork and about from the mouth of Dairy Creek.

Trade week takes place shortly after the conclusion of each AFL season, but prior to the national draft. This is the only time during the AFL season or off-season when clubs are allowed to make trades. Clubs are permitted to exchange players, draft picks in the next national draft, or compensation draft picks during trade week; draft picks in the pre-season draft or the rookie draft, or non-compensation draft picks for future seasons cannot be traded. It is permissible for a club to trade a player in exchange for a very low draft pick that it does not ultimately use, serving effectively as a direct player transfer. The majority of trades are simple exchanges between two clubs, but more complicated exchanges involving three or more clubs are permissible, and are not uncommon. From the 2012 season onwards, the duration of trade week has been lengthened from one week to three. AFL Football Operations Manager Adrian Anderson explained that the AFL had decided to expand trade week due to the introduction of free agency. ==References== Category:Australian Football League draft Category:AFL Women's draft ","title":"AFL trade week"},{"id":"20457480","text":"Romance is David Cassidy's seventh studio album as a solo artist and his first released by Arista Records.

The occupation was an extension of the larger Seven Years' War between Britain and France, but which came to involve Spain. The British wanted to use Manila as an entrep√¥t for trade in the region, particularly with China.Danley & Speelman pp 463-64 In addition, a ransom for the city was delivered to the British on the basis that the city would not continue to be sacked or burnt. The resistance from the provisional Spanish colonial government established by members of the Royal Audience of Manila led by Lieutenant Governor Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar and their Filipino allies prevented British forces from taking control of territory beyond the neighbouring towns of Manila and Cavite. ==Background== At the time, Britain and France were belligerents in what was later called the Seven Years' War. As the war progressed, the neutral Spanish government became concerned that the string of major French losses at the hands of the British were becoming a threat to Spanish interests. France successfully negotiated a treaty with Spain known as the Family Compact which was signed on 15 August 1761. By an ancillary secret convention, Spain committed to making preparations for war against Britain. Britain first declared war against Spain on 4 January 1762, and on 18 January 1762, Spain issued their own declaration of war against Britain. On 6 January 1762, the British Cabinet led by Prime Minister John Stuart, agreed to attack Havana in the West Indies, and approved Colonel William Draper's scheme for taking Manila with his forces, which were already in the East Indies. Draper was commanding officer of the 79th Regiment of Foot, which was then stationed at Madras in British India. Weeks later, King George III signed the instructions which permitted Draper to implement his scheme, emphasising that by taking advantage of the 'existing war with Spain', Britain might be able to assure her post-war mercantile expansion. Manila was one of the most important trading cities in Asia during this period, and the British East India Company wanted to extend its influence over the Archipelago. As a result, there was an expectation that the commerce of Spain would suffer a 'crippling blow'. Upon arriving in India, Draper's brevet rank became brigadier general. A secret committee of the East India Company agreed to provide a civil governor for the administration of the Islands, and in July 1762, they appointed Dawsonne Drake for the post. ===British conquest of Manila=== On 24 September 1762,British naval calendar date a British fleet of eight ships of the line, three frigates, and four store ships with a force of 6,839 regulars, sailors and marines, sailed into Manila Bay from Madras. The expedition, led by Brigadier- General William Draper and Rear-Admiral Samuel Cornish, captured Manila, \\"the greatest Spanish fortress in the western Pacific\\". The Spanish defeat was not really surprising. The former Governor-General of the Philippines, Pedro Manuel de Arandia, had died in 1759 and his replacement, Brigadier Francisco de la Torre had not arrived because of the British attack on Havana in Cuba. The Spanish Crown appointed the Mexican-born Archbishop of Manila Manuel Rojo del Rio y Vieyra as temporary Lieutenant Governor. In part, because the garrison was commanded by the Archbishop instead of a regular military commander, many mistakes were made by the Spanish forces. On 5 October 1762 (4 October local calendar), the night before the fall of the walled city of Manila, the Spanish military persuaded Rojo to summon a council of war. Several times the archbishop wished to capitulate, but was prevented. That same day with very heavy battery fire, the British had successfully breached the walls of the bastion of San Diego. The pioneers had emptied the water in the ditch, dismounted the cannons of that bastion and the two adjoining bastions, San Andes and San Eugeno. In addition they set fire to parts of the town, and drove the Spanish forces from the walls. At dawn of 6 October, British forces attacked the breach and took the fortifications, meeting little resistance. During the siege, the Spanish lost three officers, two sergeants, 50 troops of the line, and 30 civilians of the militia, besides many wounded. Among the natives there were 300 killed and 400 wounded. The besiegers suffered 147 killed and wounded, of whom sixteen were officers. The fleet fired upon the city more than 5,000 bombs, and more than 20,000 balls. ==Occupation== Once Manila fell to British troops, \\"the soldiers turned to pillage.\\" \\"Rojo wrote that the sack actually lasted thirty hours or more, although he laid the blame on the domestics of the Spaniards, the Chinese and Filipinos, as much as upon the British soldiers.\\" Writing in his journal, Rojo described the events and said: \\"The city was given over the pillage, which was cruel and lasted for forty hours, without excepting the churches, the archbishopric, and a part of the palace. Although the captain-general (Simon de Anda y Salazar) objected at the end of the twenty-four hours, the pillage really continued, in spite of the orders of the British general (Draper) for it to cease. Rojo himself killed with his own hands a soldier he found transgressing his orders, and had three hanged.\\"Renato Perdon article in the Bayanihan News http://bayanihannews.com.au/2014/03/12/british-pillaged-looted- manila-for-40-hours/ The British had demanded a ransom of four million dollars from the Spanish government to which Rojo now agreed to avoid further destruction. Map of the British conquest of Manila in 1762On 2 November 1762, Dawsonne Drake of the British East India Company assumed office as the British Governor of Manila. He was assisted by a council of four, consisting of John L. Smith, Claud Russel, Henry Brooke and Samuel Johnson. When after several attempts, Drake realised that he was not getting as many assets that he expected, he formed a War Council, that he named Chottry Court, with power to imprison anyone. Many Spaniards, Criollos, Mestizos, Chinese, and natives were imprisoned for crimes, that was denounced by Captain Thomas Backhouse, were \\"only known to himself.\\" The British expedition was further rewarded after the capture of the treasure ship Filipina, carrying American silver from Acapulco, and in a battle off Cavite the Sant√≠sima Trinidad which carried China goods. The cargo of the Trinidad alone was valued at $1.5 million and the ship at $3 million. ===Resistance=== Sign at Fort Santiago, Manila, marking the departure point of Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar Map showing the chronological advance of British troops from Manila toward parts of Northern Luzon In the meantime, the Royal Audience of Manila had organised a war council and dispatched Oidor Don Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar to the provincial town of Bulacan to organise continued resistance to the British. The Real Audencia also appointed Anda as Lieutenant Governor and Visitor-General. That night, Anda took a substantial portion of the treasury and official records with him, departing Fort Santiago through the postern of Our Lady of Solitude, to a boat on the Pasig River, and then to Bulacan. He moved headquarters from Bulacan to Bacolor, Pampanga, which was more secure, and quickly obtained the powerful support of the Augustinians. On 8 October 1762, Anda wrote to Rojo informing him that he had assumed the position of Governor and Capitan-General under the statutes of the Council of the Indies which allowed for the devolution of authority from the Governor to the Audiencia in cases of riot or invasion by foreign forces, as such was the case. Anda, being the highest member of the Audiencia not captive by the British, assumed all powers and demanded the royal seal. Rojo declined to surrender it and refused to recognise Anda as Governor-General. The surrender agreement between Archbishop Rojo and the British military guaranteed the Roman Catholic religion and its episcopal government, secured private property, and granted the citizens of the former Spanish colony the rights of peaceful travel and of trade 'as British subjects'. Under British control, the Philippines would continue to be governed by the Real Audiencia, the expenses of which were to be paid by Spain. Anda refused to recognise any of the agreements signed by Rojo as valid, claiming that the Archbishop had been made to sign them by force, and therefore, according to the statutes of the Council of the Indies, they were invalid. He also refused to negotiate with the invaders until he was addressed as the legal Governor-General of the Philippines, returning to the British the letters that were not addressed to that effect. All of these initiatives were later approved by the King of Spain, who rewarded him and other members of the Audiencia, such as Jos√© Basco y Vargas, who had fought against the invaders. Anda eventually raised an army which amounted to over 10,000 combatants, most of them volunteer natives, and although they lacked enough modern weapons, they were successful in keeping the British forces confined to Manila and Cavite. On 26 November, Captain Backhouse dispersed Anda's troops from Pasig and soon after, established a post, manned by Lascars and sepoys so they could dominate Laguna de Bay. Then on 19 January, the following year, the British sent an expedition commanded by Captain Sleigh against Bulacan who was reinforced by 400 Chinese after Anda ordered their massacre. \\"In Bulacan alone 180 Chinese had been murdered in cold blood or had hanged themselves in fear.\\" The British took Malolos on 22 January, but failed to advance upon Anda in Pampanga and withdrew from there on 7 February. In the spring of 1763, Backhouse undertook another expedition against Anda, advancing as far as Batangas. Cornish and the East Indies Squadron departed in early 1763, leaving two frigates behind, and Seaford. On 24 July, news arrived of the cessation of fighting and on 26 August a preliminary draft of the Peace of Paris. The treaty stated that \\"All conquests not known about at the time of the signing of the treaty were to be returned to the original owners.\\" The impasse continued in Manila however, as the British order to withdraw would not arrive for another six months, and Anda reinforced his blockade of the city. \\"During the final winter of the British occupation all pretence of cooperation amongst the British leaders was abandoned.\\" ===Final months=== The Seven Years' War ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763. At the time of the signing, the signatories were not aware that Manila had been taken by the British, and consequently, it fell under the general provision that all other lands not otherwise provided for be returned to the Spanish Crown. After Archbishop Rojo died in January 1764, the British military finally recognised Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar as the legitimate Governor of the Philippines, sending him a letter addressed to the \\"Real Audiencia Gobernadora y Capitan√≠a General\\", after which Anda agreed to an armistice on the condition that the British forces withdraw from Manila by March. However, the British finally received their orders to withdraw in early March, and by mid-March the overdue Spanish governor for the Philippines, Brigadier Don Francisco de la Torre, finally arrived. This Spanish governor brought with him orders from London for Brereton and Backhouse to eventually hand over Manila to himself. Drake departed Manila on 29 March 1764, and the Manila Council elected Alexander Dalrymple Provisional Deputy Governor. The British ended the occupation by embarking from Manila and Cavite in the first week of April 1764. The 79th Regiment finally arrived Madras on 25 May 1765. ==Aftermath== Diego Silang, who was emboldened by Spanish vulnerability, was promised military assistance if he began a revolt against the Spanish government in the Ilocos Region, but such aid never materialised. Silang was later assassinated by his own friends, and the revolt was aborted after his wife, who had taken over the leadership, was captured and executed together with the remaining rebel forces.Zaide, Gregorio F, Philippine History and Government, National Bookstore, Manila, 1984 Sultan Alimuddin I of Sulu, who had signed a treaty of alliance with the British forces after they had freed him from Fort Santiago in Manila, where he had been imprisoned accused of treason, was also taken with the evacuating forces, in the hope that he could be of help to the aspirations of the East India Company in the Sultanate of Sulu.. A number of sepoys deserted the British forces and settled down in Pasig, Taytay and Cainta, Rizal. De la Torre claimed the British destroyed the archives, plundered the palace, removed all naval stores at Cavite and dismantled the city of Manila. The conflict over payment by Spain of the outstanding part of the ransom promised by Rojo in the terms of surrender, and compensation by Britain for the excesses committed by Governor Drake against residents of Manila, continued in Europe for years afterwards. The capture of the Spanish treasure galleons Santissima Trinidad and the Filipina however, made the expedition and the occupation rewarding more to the British rather than the East India Company as well as representing a severe loss to Spain. ===Assessment=== Postern of Our Lady of Solitude through which Anda escaped with most government papers and about half the treasury The British failure to extend control beyond Manila and Cavite made their occupation's continuation unviable. Captain Thomas Backhouse reported to the Secretary of War in London that \\"the enemy is in full possession of the country\\". The British had accepted the written surrender of the Philippines from Archbishop Rojo on 30 October 1762, but the Royal Audience of Manila had already appointed Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar as the new Governor-General as provided for under the statutes of the Council of the Indies, as was pointed out by Anda and retrospectively confirmed by the King of Spain, in his re- appointment of both Anda and Basco. It was not the first time that the Audiencia had assumed responsibility for the defence of the Philippines in the absence of a higher authority; in 1646, during the Battles of La Naval de Manila, it temporarily assumed the government and maintained the defence of the Philippines against the Dutch. As Francisco Leandro Viana, who was in Manila during the 20-month occupation, explained to King Charles III in 1765, \\"the English conquest of the Philippines was just an imagined one, as the English never owned any land beyond the range of the cannons in Manila\\". == See also == * Azim ud-Din I of Sulu * Great Britain in the Seven Years' War ==Citations, references, and additional sources== Citations References * * * Additional sources * Borschberg, P.

It was known for its mining of gold, its gold products and its extensive trade network across the Nusantara area. The kingdom had trading relationships with the ancient civilizations of Japan, China, India, Indonesia, Persia, Cambodia and areas now comprised in Thailand. The balangay (large outrigger boats) that have been found along the east and west banks of the Libertad river (old Agusan River) have revealed much about Butuan's history. As a result, Butuan is considered to have been a major trading port in the Caraga region during the pre-colonial era. ==HistoriographyChinese records=== The world in 1200 AD: Butuan and its neighbors. Evidence indicates that Butuan was in contact with the Song dynasty of China by at least 1001 AD. The Chinese annal Song Shih recorded the first appearance of a Butuan tributary mission (Lijehan ÊùéÁ´æÁΩï and Jiaminan) at the Chinese Imperial Court on March 17, 1001 AD. Butuan (or \\"Buotuan\\" Ëí≤Á´Ø in Middle Chinese) around that time was a gold mining and trading center in northeastern Mindanao, known for manufacturing metal tools and weaponry, musical instruments, and gold jewelry. The chief (or \\"king\\") of Butuan named Kiling sent an envoy under I-hsu-han, with a formal memorial requesting equal status in court protocol with the Champa envoy. The request was denied later by the Imperial court, mainly because of favoritism over Champa. A new ruler with the Indianized name Sri Bata Shaja later succeeded in attaining diplomatic equality with Champa by sending the ambassador Likanhsieh. Likanhsieh shocked the Emperor Zhenzong by presenting a memorial engraved on a gold tablet, some white dragon (Bailong ÁôΩÈæç) camphor, Moluccan cloves, and a South Sea slave at the eve of an important ceremonial state sacrifice.Song Shih Chapter 7 to 8 This display of irreverence sparked interests from China over the polity and the diplomatic relations between the two polities reached its peak during the Yuan dynasty. Chinese records about the polity stopped after the reign of Rajah Siagu, the last independent Rajah of Butuan. He was formally subjugated into the Spanish Empire after he and his brother, Rajah Kolambu of Limasawa, made a blood compact with Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. ==Excavated artifacts== The Butuan Ivory Seal, displayed at the National Museum of the Philippines. The Kawi script lettering says \\"But-wan\\" and the smaller lettering (similar to Baybayin) says \\"Bu-wa\\" (diacritics for the \\"Wan/Ban\\" in Kawi and \\"Bu/Ba\\" in the smaller letters have worn off). silver strip excavated from the 1970s in Butuan inside of a wooden coffin. The characters display a Hindu-Buddhist influence, probably a form of early writing in the Philippines (). Numerous jars have been found in the Butuan area that indicate the wealth of the kingdom and the existence of foreign traditions. Some of these jars have been dated as follows: * Sathing Phra (900‚Äì1100 AD) * Haripunjaya (800‚Äì900 AD) *Japanese (12th to 16th centuries AD) * Chinese (10th to 15th centuries AD) * Khmer (9th to 10th centuries AD) * Thai (14th to 15th centuries AD) * Champa (11th to 13th centuries AD) * Persian (9th to 10th centuries AD) Artifacts have been recovered from within the vicinities of Ambangan Archeological Site in Libertad that attest to the historical accounts that Butuan traded with India, Japan, Han Chinese, and Southeast Asian countries during these periods. ==Origins of the name== An illustration of the Garcinia morella, locally called batuan, one of which might Butuan's name came from. The name Butuan is believed to have existed long before the Spanish conquistadores arrived in the Philippine archipelago. One possible indication of this is a rhinoceros ivory seal with design carved in ancient Javanese or early Kawi script (used around the 10th century CE) which, according to a Dutch scholar, was deciphered as But-wan. Another account suggests the name derives from the word batuan, a mangosteen-related fruit common in Mindanao. Another alternative is that the name derives from Datu Bantuan, possibly a former datu of the region. ==Recorded monarchs== { width=70%  ! width=5%,  The Royal Title of the Reigning Rajah ! width=5%  Events ! width=1%  From ! width=1%  Until - Datu Bantuan-989 - Kiling The Embassy of I-shu-han (ÊùéÁ´æÁΩï)9891009 - Sri Bata ShajaMission by Likanhsieh (Êùé‰∫éÁáÆ)1011? -  Rajah SiaguAnnexation by Ferdinand Magellan?1521 - } ==Modern commentary== Spanish chroniclers, when they stepped foot on Butuan, remarked that gold was so abundant that even houses were decorated with gold; \\"Pieces of gold, the size of walnuts and eggs are found by sifting the earth in the island of that king who came to our ships. All the dishes of that king are of gold and also some portion of his house as we were told by that king himself...He had a covering of silk on his head, and wore two large golden earrings fastened in his ears...At his side hung a dagger, the haft of which was somewhat long and all of gold, and its scabbard of carved wood. He had three spots of gold on every tooth, and his teeth appeared as if bound with gold.\\" As written by Antonio Pigafetta on Rajah Siagu of Butuan during Magellan's voyage. Rajah Siagu was also a cousin of Rajah Humabon of the Cebu, thus suggesting that the two Indianized kingdoms were in an alliance together with Hindu Kutai against the Islamic Sultanates of Maguindanao and Sulu. Butuan was so rich in treasures that a museum curator, Florina H. Capistrano- Baker, stated that it was even richer than the more well-known western maritime kingdom of Srivijaya; \\"The astonishing quantities and impressive quality of gold treasures recovered in Butuan suggest that its flourishing port settlement played an until recently little-recognized role in early Southeast Asian trade. Surprisingly, the amount of gold discovered in Butuan far exceeds that found in Sumatra, where the much better known flourishing kingdom of Srivijaya is said to have been located.\\" ==See also== *Butuan *Balangay *Dimasaua *Agusan image *Butuanon people *Indian cultural influences in early Philippine polities ==References * Butuan silver strips * Flag and symbols * Butuan ivory seals Category:Former countries in Philippine history Category:Barangay states Category:Historical regions Category:History of the Philippines (900‚Äì1565) Category:History of Mindanao Category:History of Agusan del Norte Kingdom of Butuan Category:Historical Hindu kingdoms ","title":"Butuan (historical polity)"},{"id":"20457913","text":"Peerwana is a village in Faisalabad District near Chak Jhumra, Punjab, Pakistan. It is in Chak Jhumra Town's Union Council#2. It is situated on the Faisalabad to Pindi Bhattian Motorway M3 near Sahianwala Interchange. It is one of the newly built motorways of Pakistan which connects Islamabad and Lahore to Faisalabad. Many people nearby villages have used it as a starting point for Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar and Multan. It is 140 kilometers away from Lahore and 30 kilometers away from Faisalabad. It was named after Peer sahab, a prominent saint. Nearby towns are Salarwala, Sangla Hill, Chak Jhumra, Chiniot and Pindi Bhattian. By road, 43/JB Peerwana is connected to Salarwala, Sangla Hill, Chak Jhumra, Chiniot and Pindi Bhattian. The most famous things in Peerwana are Darbar Bawa Sardar Ali and Government Primary school for Girls and Boys. Bawa Sardar Ali a Muslim Sufi, Syed Yousaf Shah who gave people teachings of Islam. This village consists of Gudgor Families mainly except this Aasi Family is there. Ch. Muhammad Afzal Sahi, a former speaker, Punjab assembly of Pakistan, was a famous follower of Bawa Sardar Ali and used to visit darbar time and again. The town has a multi-ethnic population of ten thousand. Much of this population is uneducated. Conditions of civil amenities are poor. A government hospital exists three kilometer away from main population area which was established in the time of united India. It has shifted to a new building and its old land has been occupied by land mafia. Probably the biggest feature of Peerwana is its game of Shooting Volleyball. As the legend goes this game has been played for 60 or so years. Some outstanding shoot strikers of Punjab were produced in Peruana. The game is played in front of the Peruana Adda Bus Stop and can be seen morning and evening. Every spring there is a tournament in which teams from all nearby areas participate. ==Castes== Gadgor is the major caste in this village. Almost 85% families belongs to Gudgore Family. Gadgor is a sub-caste of Jut Family. Forefathers of Gadgor Family migrated from Sialkot from \\"Gudgore\\" Village in Tehsil Pasrur before independence of Pakistan and settled here. In those days this area was rich in plants/jungle. So, they started cutting trees and made land for agriculture purposes. Now there are four villages of Gudgor Family. Peerwana, Jalma'ana, Aa'lniawala and Ramowana. Gudgore Families also live all over the Pakistan. Aasi, Luhar, Mochi, Kumhar, Na'ee, Tarkhan, Maachhi, Muslim Sheikh, and Sheikh castes are also found in Peerwana. ==Economy== The economy is meager and agricultural in nature. Many people are employed in Pakistan Rangers Force. The canal Jhang Branch passes just two kilometers away from Peruana. Irrigation water for land comes from this canal. Land is very fertile.

These machines are located in ports and jetties to facilitate bulk material exportation. Generally shiploaders are engineered to suit specific project requirements. Those requirements often include: port design, material characteristics, loading capacity, vessel type, local law, and budgetary limitations. A shiploader mainly consists of a central column, an extendable arm or boom, a belt conveyor extending out of the boom structure, a slewing mechanism, and a loading chute to transfer product from a source conveyor or feeder. The boom can move front and back, up and down by separate drives so that it can fill the whole breadth of the ship hold and adapt to the ships increasing draught while it is loaded. The shiploader is essential to the global shipping industry. Globalization has promoted the need for international maritime ports to be equipped with efficient and durable shiploading machinery able to a handle the great variety of materials that enter into harbors within short time frames. This need for efficiency of loading and unloading has promoted advances in shiploader technologies. There are two main types of shiploaders, stationary and mobile. The distinguishing element between the two is portability versus immovability. == Stationary shiploaders == Most shiploaders are stationary installations. Relative simplicity of structure combined with initial lower acquisition and maintenance costs are the greatest advantages of the stationary shiploaders. Stationary shiploaders operate within the confines of the wharf length; no costly redesign of wharf length is required. This setup comes at a cost however; the greatest disadvantages lie in its operating costs and operating efficiency. Being a fixed apparatus, the stationary shiploader requires that the vessel itself be moved then secured relative to the shiploader to allow filling of each of the different cargo holds. This process exposes the ship and the docking structure to the hazard of accidental collisions. The movement of the ship for each of the holds is both time and manpower consuming, which results in a costly low average loading rate. == Mobile shiploaders == High- angle sandwich belt type shiploader. There are two standard types of mobile shiploaders available: the partially mobile, rail-travelling shiploader and the fully mobile, wheel mounted shiploader. Both types of mobile shiploaders benefit from portability of design. This design creates a loading process much less complicated than the stationary shiploader because both rail-travelling and wheel mounted mobile shiploaders reach all ship holds for loading without the movement of the vessel. This process also significantly reduces operating costs in the form of both time expended and manpower required. The disadvantage of the mobile shiploaders is found in its space requirements. Mobile shiploaders generally require either a substantial existing wharf site length or the necessity of a wharf length extension. The quantifying difference between the two mobile shiploaders is that the rail-travelling shiploader is relegated to linear rail lines installed along the length of the wharf, whereas the wheel mounted mobile shiploader allows for free movement. Rail-traveling loaders require the added expense of the purchase and installation of dock railings. Wheel mounted mobile shiploaders offer access to the vessel not limited by rail tracks. This increased mobility increases accessibility and flexibility. In addition, integrated tow hitches enable the storage of the unit away from the quayside when not in use. == Innovations in shiploading == In response to the challenges of standard shiploading choices, innovations in the industry have been created. A few companies (Superior, Telestack, TAKRAF) have designed mobile radial telescopic shiploaders. These machines utilize the mobility of the wheel mounted mobile shiploader combined with extendable and retractable radial boom lengths to access the cargo holds. This mechanical combination promotes the reduction of movements necessary for vessel loads, thereby increasing productivity. One of the most unique innovations to overcome the challenges in the shiploading industry has been the design of the wheel mounted, DSI Snake Shiploader. Standard mobile shiploaders require substantial wharf space in which to maneuver. Dockside real estate is expensive and limited; the DSI Snake Shiploader utilizes a high angle material lifting technology which radically reduces wharf space required. This technology utilizes high angles combined with the Sandwich belt conveying design to hold and hug the loading material between two belts to load the ship cargo. This use of height instead of length greatly reduces the loading footprint on an already limited sized wharf. This system also promotes industry efficiency via transfer point spillage elimination: ‚ÄúBecause conventional ship loaders involve movement of large volumes of cargo via a series of belt conveyor systems from the quayside to the discharge boom, there is a likelihood of material spillage occurring at the different belt transfer points. This problem has been avoided by Dos Santos International which, working in association with Cortex Resources, recently delivered a ship loader to Port Adelaide, Australia, which incorporates a Snake Sandwich high angle conveyor belt system which does not require transfer points. It has therefore eliminated spillage problems during ship loading of titanium ore.‚Äú ==References External links == Category:Merchant navy ","title":"Shiploader"},{"id":"20458029","text":"Societ√† Aerea Mediterranea (SAM) was an Italian cargo and passenger airline based in Rome, Italy, which operated between 1928 and 1939 as subsidiary of Ala Littoria and between 1959 and 1981 as subsidiary of Alitalia.

The tale was collected by Aleksandr Afanas'ev is his 1850s Narodnye russkie skazki (tale number 89). The story has been rewritten and adapted numerous times, and translated into other languages. ==Plot== It is a progressive story, in which a grandfather plants a turnip, which grows so large that he cannot pull it up himself. He asks the grandmother for help, and they together still cannot pull it up. Successively more people are recruited to help, until they finally pull the turnip up together. The specific ordering and set of people and sometimes animals varies. However, in the original Russian version the order is quite fixed, it is the grandfather (dedka), the grandmother (babka), the granddaughter (vnuchca), the female-dog (zhuchka), the female-cat (koshka) and finally the female-mouse (myshka). The humour in the story is that only with the help of the weakest and smallest creature (the mouse) can the giant turnip (repka) be pulled up. The moral of this story is that of collaboration, and that if we all work together, we can do anything. The story is very popular in Russia as the names of the participants rhyme: repka (turnip) ‚Äì dedka (grandfather) ‚Äì babka (grandmother); vnuchka (granddaughter) ‚Äì zhuchka (she-dog); koshka (she-cat) ‚Äì myshka (she-mouse). ==Derivative works== Several version for children have been penned, including by : Konstantin Ushinsky (1864), Vladimir Dal (1870), and Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy (1940). The fairy tale has had multiple treatments in English.

He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1967 and went on to attend State University of New York at New Paltz where he performed in a production of Carlo Gozzi's Turandot. He frequented on and off-campus poetry readings and performance gigs, reading his own poetry, playing the recorder and harmonica and performing with local musicians, including Raoul Vezina, Richard J. (Rich) Rizzi and others. In classic '60s style, he dropped out of college in 1970 to work full-time on the Gargoyle, the Hudson Valley's first alternative or \\"underground\\" newspaper, which he helped to start in 1969 in New Paltz, Ulster County, NY ‚Äî then a major center of student action, antiwar protest, assisted psychotropics, and artistic renaissance. While working on the Gargoyle Horowitz changed his name to Mikhail (\\"Mik\\") Horowitz, as he was often confused with Michael Horovitz, a widely published post-Beat British poet who was enamored of jazz and who orchestrated the Poetry Olympics in London, and Michael Horowitz, author, activist, friend of Timothy Leary and later father of Winona Ryder. The deciding straw was receiving a mistakenly delivered packet of galley proofs from one of Michael Horovitz‚Äôs publishers. Beginning in 1973, Horowitz spent five years on the road, mainly on the West Coast, as the 'Null' half of the comic duo Null and Void. 'Void' was his comedic partner Francesco (Frank) Patricolo. Horowitz referred to this collaboration as \\"a metaphysical stand-up tragedy team.\\" The partnership, but not the friendship, broke up in 1978. After this, he continued to perform on his own, with musicians and a variety of performance artists in the Mid-Hudson Valley, New York. In 1989, he teamed up with Paris born/American raised Gilles Malkine, a musician and composer. Malkine performed with Tim Hardin at the original Woodstock Festival, 1969; through the years he worked with many other musicians, including John Sebastian and Billy Faier. Horowitz and Malkine continue to perform together actively into 2009. They have presented more than 750 performances in New York, New England, Michigan, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington (state), Ohio, and Ontario to date. Their repertoire varies greatly but often contain audience favorites, particularly routines with literary motifs and references to American culture, particularly the 60s/70s and [Jewish culture]. In 1978 City Lights books published Big League Poets, baseball card collages of imaginary historical and literary baseball players. From 1986 through 1999, Horowitz's principal occupation was as a journalist, first with the Daily Freeman, a daily serving Kingston, N. Y. and then the Woodstock Times, where as arts editor he was listed on the masthead as \\"Cultural Czar.\\" From early in his career Horowitz was performing music. He plays blues harmonica and alto, soprano, and sopranino recorders, and occasionally blows kazoo, pennywhistle, and various wooden flutes. These instruments are a regular part of his performances. He maintains a singularly unique style of recorder playing, as it is cocked to the side of his mouth as one might imagine impish Pan might hold it. As a performance poet and stand-up cultural commentator/singer, Horowitz has performed at hundreds of diverse venues, from the Village Gate, Westbeth Theater, and the Image Theater, in New York City with repeated visits to the 92nd Street Y; the Bumbershoot Festival, Seattle, Washington, the Taos Poetry Circus, Taos, New Mexico, a variety of not-so orthodox synagogues; the Rosendale Caves, Rosendale, New York; a headliner at several the Woodstock Poetry Festivals and many other events in Woodstock; Unison, New Paltz, NY; Clearwater Great Hudson River Revival Festival in Croton, New York; and many other locales. His solo poetry, prose, and artwork continue to be published in numerous anthologies, including City Lights Journal, The Stiffest of the Corpse, The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry, Brilliant Corners, Elysian Fields Quarterly, and Yellow Silk Anthology. He has collaborated with or shared the bill with, Charles Mingus, Peter ‚ÄúP.D.Q. Bach‚Äù Schickele, Allen Ginsberg, Ed Sanders & The Fugs, Robert Bly, Bob Holman, David Amram, Marilyn Crispell, Andrei Codrescu, Artie Traum and Happy Traum, Jay Ungar, Molly Mason, Phil Donahue, Amy Goodman, Natalie Merchant, Kate Pierson (B-52s), Raoul Vezina, and Ron Whiteurs, among many others. Through the years, Horowitz's stage style and content has been compared to Lenny Bruce, Lord Buckley, and sometimes, mistakenly, to Brother Theodore. Horowitz's style is both more playful and erudite, with a Shakespearian penchant for satisfying the audience's predilection for the bawdy. As of 1989, Horowitz lives in Saugerties, New York with his partner of over 20 years, artist/illustrator Carol Zaloom. He has for several years remained on the editorial staff of Bard College Publications, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY. He is a member of Actors & Writers, based in Olivebridge, New York. ==Books== *Big League Poets (City Lights, 1978) *The Opus of Everything in Nothing Flat (Outloud/Red Hill, 1993) *Rafting Into the Afterlife (Codhill Press, 2007) *Ancient Baseball (Alte Books, 2019) ==Selected anthologies== *Laugh Lines (Vintage Books, 2007) *Line Drives (South Illinois University Press, 2002) *The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry (Thunder‚Äôs Mouth, 1999) *Baseball Diamonds (Doubleday) *Yellow Silk (Crown) *The Sacred Theory of the Earth (North Atlantic Books) ==Selected journals, magazines, and papers== Abraxas, Archae, Arson, Brilliant Corners, Chiron, City Lights Journal, Davka, Elysian Fields Quarterly, Exquisite Corpse, Graffiti Rag, Hanging Loose, Heaven Bone, Hunger, Io, Long Shot, Matter, New York Times, Pig Iron, Rattle, Spitball, White Pine Journal ==CDs== *The Blues of the Birth (Euphoria Jazz!/Sundazed, 1999) *Live, Jive & Over 45 (with Gilles Malkine, self-produced, 2000) *Poor, On Tour, & Over 54 (with Gilles Malkine, self-produced, 2007) ==DVDs== \\"Too Small To Fail\\" (with Gilles Malkine, a Carlos Fernandez Dish, 2011) ==Compilation CDs== *Bring It On Home, Vol. II (Columbia/Legacy Records) *Unison Arts 25 Years Compilation Album (private release) *Several of the Diamond Cuts CDs issued by Hungry for Music, 2002‚Äì08 *A Chanukah Feast (Hungry for Music) ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Conversation with Mikhail Horowitz, with Renee Samuels, Catskill Mountain Foundation *Secrets of a Dynamic Duo, Mikhail Horowitz and Gilles Malkine, by Gary Alexander, Clean Magazine *Interviews with friends and associates ==External links== *Official Website *M.

Relations were first established during the period of the Roman Republic, when the Ptolemaic Kingdom frequently interacted with Rome, culminating in the Roman annexation of Egypt in 30 BC. With the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD and Egypt's continuation as a province of the Eastern Roman Empire until the Islamic conquest in 642 AD, there were no independent states of Italy and Egypt, and as such no diplomatic relations. Cultural ties between Egypt and Italy distanced further over time with the Islamisation of Egypt and the strength of Catholicism in Italy. It would not be until Egypt's official independence from the British in 1914 that relations with Italy would be reestablished. With the rise of Mussolini and fascism in Italy and the eventual Italian invasion of Egypt during World War II, relations became severely strained. However, after the war, relations were re-established and the countries now have a cordial relationship. Egypt has an embassy in both Rome and Milan, while Italy has an embassy in both Cairo and Alexandria. Egypt and Italy are both members of the Union for the Mediterranean. Italy is Egypt's largest trade partner in the European Union, and is the third largest internationally following the United States and China. Furthermore, Italy's investments in Egypt are worth $2.6 billion, mostly concentrated in transport and banking services among other sectors, making it the fifth largest European investor in Egypt. By the end of 2014, the volume of trade between the two countries reportedly reached $6 billion. Embassy of Italy in Cairo In April 2016, diplomatic relations between the two countries were seriously strained when an Italian PhD student from the University of Cambridge was found brutally murdered in Cairo after he went missing in January of the same year. Subsequently, Italy withdrew its ambassador to Egypt for consultations in Rome regarding the criminal death of Giulio Regeni, who, at the time, conducted critical academic research on Egyptian labour rights and trade unions. Egyptian law enforcement then produced conflicting information on the fate of the Italian citizen, which was unacceptable to Italian investigators. As a result, the Italian press and foreign ministry pointed at the systematic human right violations in Egypt, and threatened with political sanctions unless police leadership and practices undergo significant revisions.Spalinger A (April 2016).\\"Ein Mordfall wird zur Staatsaff√§re\\".

The Reading, Ohio‚Äìbased company was founded by Ely Steinberg in 1921, and the Steinberg family continued to own the chain until its bankruptcy and liquidation in 1997. ==History== Ely Steinberg opened his first store in 1921. The first two stores were located in Cincinnati, Ohio, and focused on musical instruments and electronic audio equipment, such as The Victrola, an early record player, and crystal radio receivers. Notable customers included Powel Crosley Jr., whose WLW-AM later became Cincinnati's premiere radio station. Steinberg closed the two stores during the Great Depression and reopened one of them in 1937. The chain began to sell a greater variety of products, including stoves, refrigerators, dishwashers, and eventually television sets and desktop computers. By the 1990s, Steinberg's had grown to 22 stores in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Facing competition from larger retailers, such as Sun Television and Appliances and Roberd's Grand, Steinberg's abruptly closed its doors on September 22, 1997, in a manner reminiscent of another Cincinnati- based department store, Swallen's. Steinberg's quickly reopened its stores and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the next day in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio. ==References== Category:Defunct companies based in Cincinnati Category:Defunct department stores based in Ohio Category:American companies established in 1921 Category:Retail companies established in 1921 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 1997 Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1997 ","title":"Steinberg's (electronics store)"},{"id":"20458460","text":"This is a comprehensive discography of Face to Face, a Southern California- based punk rock band. The band has released eleven full-length studio albums (counting a covers album), eight EPs, two split albums, one official live recording, one compilation album, eleven music videos and twelve singles. This list is not intended to include material performed by members or former members of Face to Face that was recorded with Legion of Doom, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, No Use for a Name, The Offspring, Pulley, Saves the Day, 22 Jacks, Viva Death, Red Faced, or Real Space Noise. ==Biography== Face to Face traces its beginnings back to 1988 when singer/guitarist Trever Keith, bassist Matt Riddle, and drummer Rob Kurth formed a local metal band called Zero Tolerance. After forming, Kurth's friend Mark Haake joined the group in 1989 as an additional guitarist for a couple of months before getting orders to the Middle East with the Air Force. Although no formal studio recordings of Zero Tolerance exist, they had recorded a handful of demo tapes. As a three-piece, the band played a show at Spanky's in Riverside, California, and a couple of other local shows. When Haake left, the band continued as a three-piece and changed their name to Face to Face in 1991. In late 1991, Face to Face were signed to a local punk rock record label Dr. Strange Records. Dr. Strange issued the band's first single \\"No Authority\\" and their first studio album Don't Turn Away, which was released in 1992. Copies of Don't Turn Away sold quickly and Dr. Strange was unable to keep up with the demand, so Keith contacted NOFX's Fat Mike of Fat Wreck Chords to re-release it with wider distribution. In addition to re-releasing the album, Fat Wreck Chords released \\"Disconnected\\" as a 7\\" single in August 1993. Also in 1993, just after a three-week tour in Germany supporting their labelmates Lagwagon, Face to Face added Chad Yaro as an additional guitarist. Before the band could begin work on Don't Turn Away's follow-up, they made a decision to go with a new label that had major-label distribution. The label, Victory Music,signed them and then they entered the studio with producer Thom Wilson (of The Offspring fame) and began recording their second album, entitled Big Choice. The label was nervous about their distribution deal and wanted a test release to run through the system, and issued an EP of songs from 7\\"s and other rarities called Over It. A&M; Records signed the band and re-released Big Choice in 1995, yielding a minor hit on the L.A. local radio station KROQ with the re-recording of \\"Disconnected\\". After touring with bands such as NOFX, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and The Offspring during 1995, Riddle left Face to Face and went on to play in 22 Jacks and Pulley before settling on No Use for a Name. The band replaced Riddle with a then-unknown bassist named Scott Shiflett. Face to Face returned to the studio in 1996 to record another album for their label, resulting in their self-titled fourth album, which was a moderate success. To promote the album, the band joined the Warped Tour in 1997. After promoting the self-titled album, longtime drummer Rob Kurth left the band in early 1998. To finish out the touring cycle for the self-titled album, the band replaced Kurth with Jose Medeles, who was out with them on a co-headlining US tour with the Reverend Horton Heat band, before taking a break to write and record their next album. After 25 different drummers were auditioned to replace Kurth, the band finally found Pete Parada. After the release of two more albums, Ignorance Is Bliss (1999) and Reactionary (2000), Yaro departed from Face to Face in 2001. Instead of hiring a replacement for him, the band decided to continue as a three piece. After the release of one more album, How to Ruin Everything (2002), Face to Face decided to call it quits, and embarked on a farewell tour in 2004. The band released a holiday song \\"Merry Xmas\\" on the 2004 Kevin and Bean album Christmastime in the 909. After breaking up, Keith had been active in the mashup group Legion of Doom, among other bands such as Shiflett's brainchild Viva Death and a solo project called Pablum. Yaro had been missing from the public eye after his 2001 departure from Face to Face. After leaving Saves the Day, Parada joined The Offspring in 2007, replacing Atom Willard, During the recording of their new studio album at the time. After a four-year hiatus, Face to Face reunited in January 2008 for select shows in the US and internationally. In April of that year, they performed together for the first time since breaking up at The Glasshouse in Pomona, California, and have continued to perform numerous live venues since. The band released Laugh Now, Laugh Later, their first album in 9 years, on May 17, 2011. ==Studio albums== { style=\\"text-align:left;\\" ! Year ! width=\\"300\\"Title !

He was the author of dozens of scientific and research papers in French, German and Polish, and three ground-breaking medical textbooks. He graduated from the University of Vilnius in 1929. In the 1930s Frydman worked at the Department of Internal Diseases in Vilnius. During World War II he was arrested by the Soviets and exiled to the depths of the Soviet Union. In the Komi Republic and Krasnodar and in the Siberian camp, as a prisoner, he worked as a doctor treating other prisoners despite the poorest conditions and with few supplies, earning the respect of senior Russian officers. Dr. Frydman returned to Poland in 1945 following the war and decided to change his surname in Chlebowski. After the war Chlebowski was employed by the Klinik Internal Diseases in Krak√≥w and ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and by Habilitowa≈Ç in Lodz in 1948. In 1951 Chlebowski became involved in the founding of the Medical University of Bia≈Çystok and was appointed Professor of Medicine and Director of the Department of Internal Diseases. In 1953 Chlebowski stood up for one of his university students, who was removed from school at the request of the Board for concealing his connection with the underground anti-Hitler movement. During deliberations by the Appeals Board, Prof. Dr. Chlebowski was the only executive member who stood in defense of the university student. Between 1957 and 1959 Chlebowski held the post of Vice-Rector of the Medical Academy in Bialystok, and between 1959 and 1962 he was honoured with the appointment as rector. Chlebowski was removed from the university during \\"the March events.\\" on 22 April 1968 at an openly held party gathering, attended by all university staff and students.http://www.bialystokonline.pl/artykul.php?ida=28450 The documentation from the Medical Academy in Bialystok (the college PZPR letter dated 23 April 1968) reads as follows: \\"The Committee Campus Polish United Workers' Party of the Academy of Medicine in Bialystok, after consideration of the matter on 22 April 1968, seek a request to the National Minister of Health, by his Magnificent Rector of the local university professor on the appeal of Dr. Jakob Chlebowski, the position of Head of the Department of Internal Diseases of the Medical Academy in Bialystok, because of his hostile attitude of the People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union.\\" On 16 October 1968 Chlebowski and his family (wife Tamar Chlebowski, a dentist, and only daughter) emigrated to Israel. On 25 January 1969, Chlebowski was hit by a motorist whilst crossing the street. ===Posthumous honors=== In 1990 the Medical Academy in Bialystok and various authorities honored the memory of Chlebowski and rectified their actions of 1968. The University senate unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the decision to remove Chlebowski from the university. A lecture hall at the State Hospital has been named Clinical Professor. Dr. Jacob Chlebowskiego, and a bronze plaque has been placed commemorating the great patron. In 1996, the Medical Academy in Bialystok held a solemn meeting at the Bia≈Çostockiego Department of Internal Polish Society to honor their great professor. Chlebowski was awarded The Order Odrodzenia Polski (Order of Poland Reborn), one of Poland's highest civilian orders, conferred for outstanding achievements in the fields of education, science, sport, culture and arts. In 2005, to honor the centenary of Chlebowski's birth, the Academy of Medicine in Bialystok awarded its first, and now annual, prize, in honor of Chlebowski, to the top medical graduate student at the Medical Academy in Bialystok.http://www.amb.edu.pl/medyk/2005/img/grudzien.pdf This prize was founded and is sponsored by Chlebowski's daughter, Dr. Irena Chlebowska- Bennett, an eye specialist who now lives in Sydney, Australia with her husband and two sons. The first laureate was Magdalena Mlonek, dentist, who was handed her prize in person by Dr. Irena Chlebowska-Bennett on campus during a ceremony held on 25 November 2005 in high Auli Medical University of Bialystok. Polonia Restituta has described Chlebowski as \\"an institution whose principles are now tended by large numbers of his colleagues and students\\". \\"He came to Bialystok in 1951, young and quickly took over the management of the Academy of Medical Clinic - Interior Diseases. His long and hard day begun primarily as lecturer and moved to research and clinical practice. The Professor had a great ability to teach complex medical principles, which he later elevated to a higher level of complex medical findings, including through scientific work\\" says Professor Jan Stasiewicz. Professor Stasiewicz goes on to say \\"short descriptions and memories alone cannot reflect all the achievements, merits and successes the Professor and Chancellor of the Academy of Medical Sciences had, there were simply too many. The most important, that even today his disciples and students often say: \\"Explore, as he Chlebowski\\" or \\"if you fail to treat your patient as Chlebowski would have, you have no chance to successfully treat them\\", and most notable, \\"Chlebowski's medical ethics were not just slogans, they were simply his principle way of working\\". ==Selected bibliography== * The application of Perkal's discriminating function to differential diagnosis * Some aspects of the carbohydrate metabolism in the obese (Pol Arch Med Wewn. 1969;42(3):355-8) * Heparin and protease inhibitors in the prevention of experimental acute pancreatic necrosis in dogs (Digestion. 1969;2(1):7-16) * Influence of insulin and vasopressin on potassium distribution in tissues (Journ Annu Diabetol Hotel Dieu. 1968;9:133-7.

He occasionally threw a two-seam fastball and changeup, mainly to left-handed hitters. His slider was his most common 2-strike pitch to right-handers, and was responsible for a plurality of his strikeouts. His curve had the highest whiff rate, at 38% over his career. ==Death== On November 9, 2015, Hanson died at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, after falling into a coma with catastrophic organ failure. On December 11, 2015, a preliminary autopsy report was released, stating Hanson's official cause of death was from \\"delayed complications of cocaine and alcohol toxicity\\".

Cities within the District Boundaries include Soap Lake, Ephrata, Quincy, George, Royal City, and portions of Moses Lake, Washington. Service areas include most of Grant County and a small portion of Adams County. ==Delivery System== The water source servicing the irrigated lands within the district starts at Grand Coulee Dam, located in North Central Washington. The water is pumped up into the Banks Lake Reservoir. At the outlet of Banks Lake Reservoir is Dry Falls Dam, which regulates the amount of water entering into the irrigation project's Main Canal, which runs south from Dry Falls Dam to another reservoir called Billy Clapp Lake, formed by Pinto Dam. The Main Canal continues to a point North and East of Soap Lake, Washington, to the Main Canal Bifurcation. At this point, the Main Canal splits into the East Low Canal and the West Canal. The East Low Canal serves the East and South Columbia Basin Irrigation Districts, while the West Canal exclusively services the Quincy-Columbia Basin Irrigation District. ==Crops Served== Crops currently grown within the Irrigation District vary widely; one estimate claims over 60 different crops are grown annually. Over $2 billion worth of crops are grown annually within the Columbia Basin Project:alfalfa, wheat, soybeans, mint, potatoes, sweet corn, grain corn, livestock, apples, cherries, peaches, apricots, oats, barley, wine grapes, beans, sugar beets, carrots, squash, watermelon, and various other crops are commonly grown within the Irrigation District. ==Statistics== Irrigable land - District area - Over Initial capacity of West Canal - West canal length - Sub laterals length - Drains/wasteways length - Parcels of land served - 4,166 Number of employees - 113 Irrigable area per employee - \\"QCBID NEWS\\", Vol 1, Issue 1, November 2008 ==References== Category:Irrigation Districts of the United States Category:Local government in Washington (state) ","title":"Quincy-Columbia Basin Irrigation District"},{"id":"20458662","text":"Bhimbandh Wildlife Sanctuary is a wildlife sanctuary in Bihar in the south- west of Munger district near Jamui district. ==Etymology== According to Mahabharata; Bheema, one of the pandavas, constructed a dam (bandh) here and therefore it is called Bhimbandh. ==Geography== Bhimbandh Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the south west of Munger district. The forests cover an area or 681.99 km¬≤ on the hills and undulating tract of Kharagpur Hills. It is situated at a distance of 56 km from southern border of Munger, 20 km from Jamui Railway Station and 200 km from Patna Airport. Bhimbandh is situated south of the Ganges River, at the northern edge of Chota Nagpur Plateau and west of Santhal Pargana. it is surrounded on all sides by densely inhabited non-forestry areas. In the valley portions and at the foothills are several hot springs of which the finest are at Bhimbandh, Sita Kund and Rishi Kund. All the hot springs maintain nearly almost same temperature all year round. Of them, the Bhimbandh springs have the hottest temperature (52 ¬∞C to 65 ¬∞C) and discharge (0.84-1.12 cum/sec) and constitute the best area for the exploration of geothermal energy potential. There are number of places of tourist interest near the Sanctuary, including Rishi Kund, Sita Kund, Ha-Ha Punch Kumari, Rameshwar Kund, and Kharagpur Lake. ==Climate== The climate is normal for the Munger district. There are three distinct seasons in this zone, summer (March to May), monsoon (June to September) and winter (October to February). Average annual rainfall of this district is 1146 mm. ==Fauna== Fauna include: tiger (3), leopard (36), peafowl (637), wild bear (63), Indian hare (507), Langoor (3388), monkey (612), sahil (57), bear (96), cheetal (87), barking deer (559), Van Murgi (863), nilgai (255), python (39), newala (36), gaur (39), and hyena (36) are the major fauna of the Bhimband. Other fauna include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Small mammals include the rare hispid hare, Indian gray mongoose, small Indian mongooses, large Indian civet, small Indian civets, Bengal fox, golden jackal, sloth bear, Chinese pangolin, Indian pangolins, hog badger, Chinese ferret badgers, and particolored flying squirrel.Main fauna of Bhimband Crocodiles are found in Kharagpur lake and Kalidah near Rameshwar kund. Among snakes, cobra and kraits are of common occurrence while pythons are occasionally seen. Common bird species are peafowl, grey partridge, quail, Malabar hornbill, pied hornbill, swallow, nightjars, drongo, paradise flycatcher, kingfisher, bulbul, mynas, pigeon, wood pigeon, blue jay, owl, falcon, kite, eastern imperial eagle, greater spotted eagle, white-tailed eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, grey-headed fish eagle, lesser kestrel and vulture. Birds such as the lesser white-fronted goose, ferruginous duck, Baer's pochard duck and lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, and Asian openbill stork migrate from Central Asia to the park during winter. The main animals found at Bhimbandh Wildlife Sanctuary are tigers, panthers, wild boars, sloth bear, sambar deer, chitals, four-horned antelope and nilgais. However, the sanctuary is more famous for its bird life rather than the land animals. It is home to more than 100 species of resident birds, which stay here all year around. The number increases in the winter migratory season when there is an influx of birds from the Central Asia region. ==Flora== There are two major biomes present in Bhimbandh, grassland and forest. The sanctuary area has mainly sal forest, forest, Bamboo forest, grassland and many small forests of many miscellaneous species of flora. The top canopy of Bhimbandh mainly consists Shorea robusta (sal), Diospyros melanoxylon (kendu), Boswellia serrata (salai), Terminalia tomentosa (Asan), Terminalia belliriica (Bahera), Terminalia arjuna (Arjun), Pterocarpus marsupium (Paisar).

Moored in 1971 at Edgewater, Bergen County, New Jersey, United States, the ship was operated as a floating restaurant from 1975 to 2007. In 2017, following ten years of damage that effectively rendered the boat unrestorable, the ferry was dismantled. No structural components were salvaged. Binghamton was built for the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad's Hoboken Ferry Company to carry 986 passengers and their vehicles.Bergen County Historical Society Historic Site Markers. Accessed January 7, 2009. Added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 9, 1982, the Binghamton was possibly the last surviving steam ferry built to serve New York Harbor, where commercial steam navigation and double-ended steam ferries got their start, and which was profoundly shaped by vessels of this kind. ==Background== John Stevens of Hoboken inaugurated the world's first steam ferry service between Hoboken and Manhattan in 1811. Until the Pennsylvania Railroad built Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan and tunneled under the Hudson River, all New York-bound rail lines from the west terminated at the New Jersey shoreline of New York Harbor. Accordingly, a number of independent and railroad-affiliated ferry companies provided passenger and light freight service across the harbor. One particular type of ferryboat, the \\"double-ender,\\" was especially common in New York Harbor. Steam navigation met its first commercial success in New York Harbor, with the voyage of Robert Fulton's North River Steamboat (Clermont) from New York to Albany in 1807. Four years later, in 1811, John Stevens inaugurated what is thought to be the world's first steam ferry service on the Hudson River between Hoboken and Manhattan with the vessel Juliana. The first American double-ended ferries appeared the following year with the paddle- wheelers Jersey and York of Robert Fulton's York & Jersey Steamboat Ferry Company. Excellent for transporting vehicles, the double-enders were well adapted to New York Harbor, where there was considerable demand for speed and efficiency (vehicles could drive on and off from either end, and time- consuming turns were not necessary). It has been estimated that over 400 double-ended ferries operated in New York Harbor during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The peak years were 1906-1908 when approximately 150 double-ended ferries were in service in the Harbor. The Hoboken Ferry Company was a subsidiary of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;). The company had a fleet of six ferryboats when it ceased operations in 1967. These vessels took their names from principal stations on the DL&W; RR's main line from Hoboken, NJ to Buffalo, NY. Three of these - the Elmira, Scranton, and Pocono (n√©e Scandinavia) - the Binghamton's sisters, were also built in 1905. (Another, the Ithaca, was destroyed by fire in 1946.) Of these, the Binghamton is now the only survivor. The Binghamton's engine: 4 cylinder, double compound, marine steam engine. Like the double ended ferryboat Binghamton, this engine is of an axially symmetric design. Double compound engines were superseded by more efficient Triple expansion steam engines. ==History== DL&W; (left) before 1960 and of the Erie-Lackawanna RR (right) at the end of her career. The Binghamton (Hull #49) was one of five identical screw-propeller, double-ended ferryboats built by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry-dock Company at Newport News, Virginia in 1904‚Äì05 to designs by Gardner & Cox, naval architects. She was launched on February 20, 1905, with Miss Charlotte Emery, daughter of John M. Emery, the newly promoted superintendent of the Hoboken Ferry Company and Ferry Department of the DL&W;, serving as her sponsor. The Binghamton was completed a month later and left the Newport News yard on March 25 for the trip to Hoboken, New Jersey. She was placed in commission on April 3. Her Captain for the first crossing was Oren D. Relyea. Her normal run was from the Hoboken Terminal to Barclay Street, a twelve- minute journey of approximately 1 and 3/4 miles, a trip made continuously nearly every day for more than sixty years (on occasion she substituted on the Hoboken - 23rd Street run). As alternate methods of travel across the Harbor were implemented, ferry transport diminished. The opening of the Pennsylvania Railroad line to Penn Station in Manhattan (1907); the Hudson and Manhattan Rapid Transit Line (1907); the Holland and Lincoln tunnels (1927; 1937); and the George Washington Bridge (1931) all contributed to the decline of the ferries. In 1960, the DL&W; RR merged with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie- Lackawanna Railroad. The last ferry crossing of the Hoboken company, in operation since 1821, took place on November 22, 1967, when the railroad closed its trans-Hudson operations and offered its ferries for sale. The Erie- Lackawanna Railroad eventually filed for bankruptcy before being absorbed into Conrail in 1976. Hudson River ferry service later experienced a revival, beginning with services provided by NY Waterway in December 1986. These services are maintained by small, single-ended diesel-powered pedestrian ferries that carry on the tradition of their steam-powered predecessors. Traditional double-ended ferries (diesel-powered) meanwhile continue to serve in New York Harbor on the Staten Island Ferry. ==Appearance on film== In 1948, Marathon Pictures released a crime drama titled Close-Up. A \\"B\\" production, it was shot entirely in Manhattan. The film includes a dramatic pursuit scene shot outside of the Hoboken Ferry terminal, at Barclay Street, and on board the ferryboat Binghamton itself. Detailed interiors and exteriors of the ferryboat appear in this scene, as well as passengers and deckhands. The film starred Alan Baxter. ==Restaurant conversion== The Binghamton retired in 1967. The Binghamton was acquired in 1969 by Edward Russo, an Edgewater, NJ contractor, for conversion into a restaurant. Russo planned large dining rooms on the Upper and Main decks, plus two pubs in the former engine room. He leased a berth at Edgewater, NJ, and scheduled a grand opening for Labor Day, 1970. But a tug strike and delays in dredging her berth at Edgewater indefinitely postponed these plans.Cotterell, Harry Jr. \\"Ferryboat Binghamton, Edgewater, Bergen County, New Jersey.\\" National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form, February 1982. The Binghamton finally moved to Edgewater in 1971. Unable to find a concessionaire to operate the restaurant, Russo relinquished control of the vessel in 1973. In late 1974, the Binghamton was sold to Ferry Binghamton Inc., of Hackensack, New Jersey, for conversion to a restaurant and nightclub. On February 28, 1975, her new owners had the vessel moved to a new permanent berth about one half mile downstream. The restaurant opened later that year. The US Department of the Interior listed the Binghamton on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In 1997 the vessel made headlines when its owner, tycoon and former New Jersey Assembly Speaker Nelson Gross, was found murdered in Manhattan.Herszenhorn, David M. \\"3 Teen-Agers Plead Guilty in Businessman's Killing.\\" The New York Times, February 11, 1998. The restaurant, known as \\"Binghamton's\\", remained in business for ten years, but closed by Fall 2007. The Binghamton remained unused at her berth in Edgewater since then. In July 2011 the owner applied for a demolition permit. As of May 2012, the ferry had taken on water and was partially submerged. It was further swamped during Hurricane Sandy sometime between October 29 and 30, 2012. The ferry suffered a fire on Sunday, May 19, 2013, that was investigated by the Edgewater Police and the Bergen County arson squad. The owner, Daniel Kim, said that there was no damage to the boat. He further stated that he was closing on a deal to have a subtenant demolish and remove the ferry from the site, with plans to open a restaurant on a barge at that location. Demolition was expected to start in December 2016 and completed by Summer 2017. A replacement floating restaurant, named Binghamton II, was scheduled to open in Summer 2018, but as of today no progress has been made for the future restaurant. On July 26, 2017, the dismantling of the ferry began. Efforts to save the pilot houses were in vain when the demolition crew damaged the pilot houses in the process of removing them from the ferryboat's roof. ==Gallery== The Binghamton at Edgewater, NJ.

Brewer is credited with the first staging of a publicly promoted performance featuring the electric guitar, as well as the earliest recording using both the electric Hawaiian and electric Spanish guitar. Brewer never recorded a commercially released record, published a hit song or performed at any length as part of a nationally famous musical organization. His only known recording is a direct-to-disk 78rpm record made in Denver, Colorado in the mid 1930s [collection of the Wichita- Sedgwick County Historical Museum]. The record is of the Marion Harris hit \\"A Good Man Is Hard To Find\\" and contains what may be the earliest recording of an electric Spanish and electric Hawaiian guitar. Brewer maintained a career in music lasting over five decades. He notably acquired two pre-production electric guitars from what would eventually become known as the Rickenbacker Electro Instrument Company; a \\"standard\\" Spanish guitar and a Hawaiian \\"steel\\" guitar from his friend George Beauchamp late in the summer of 1932. Beauchamp, a talented guitarist himself, had long worked to develop a louder instrument, achieving marked success through the National resophonic guitar Company he helped form in 1927. On Oct. 15, 1931, George Beauchamp, Paul Barth and Adolph Rickenbacker formed the RO-PAT-IN Corporation, (elecktRO-PATent-INstruments or perhaps Rickenbacker Original-PATent-INstruments) and within a year, from Beauchamp's designs created the first successful electrically amplified guitar. Brewer was one of a very few orchestra leaders to use the guitar as his primary instrument so an amplified guitar was a dream come true. Brewer played primarily in the Hawaiian style with the guitar, face up, across the lap, intonated with a bar rather than fretted by hand. When he was born in Gage, Oklahoma Territory, Hawaiian music featuring the guitar would gain important public exposure at the 1904 Saint Louis World's Fair. This music inspired musicians across the continent and eventually worldwide. Its influence on the music of the mainland would be profound through the mid 20th century.Lorene Ruymar, The Hawaiian Steel Guitar and its Great Hawaiian Musicians, 1996, Centerstream Publishing By the age of 14 Brewer was entertaining the people of Shattuck, Oklahoma, giving lessons and working in the town's theater. In 1920 he traveled to California for the first of what would be many visits. There he studied with Victor Recording artist Sam P. Moore, who was a well-known artist of the Hawaiian Style Guitar. Moore was one of the earliest mainlanders to apply the Hawaiian Style of playing to more traditional American folk songs foreshadowing the instrument's prominence in country music. While in California, [according to ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who in the World of Music ‚Äì 1936‚Äù], Brewer also studied under Sol Ho ªopi ªi, Jack Miller, and D. S. Delano. Brewer's formal musical education continued when he returned to the mid-west and attended Northwestern Oklahoma Teachers College in Alva. At about this time Brewer also worked Vaudeville, Lyceum and Chautauqua circuits.Who's Who Today in the Musical World, 1937, Authors International Publishing Company, Pg 38 By the mid-1920s Brewer had relocated to Wichita, Kansas, where he would establish his home base and work into the 1960s. From Wichita he began touring with his own orchestra and broadcasting on radio to further promote his work. It's not known exactly when Brewer first met George Beauchamp. The purchase of National Resophonic Guitars for both his orchestra and to sell to students likely led to Brewer's patronage of Beauchamp's new product, the electric guitar, made available through what would become the world's first electric musical instrument company: Ro-Pat-In, later and more famously known as Rickenbacker.Bob Brozman, The History and Artistry of National Resonator Instruments, 1993, Centerstream Publishing Co., Pg. 36 In California during the summer of 1932, Brewer took possession of two of the earliest electric guitars made by Beauchamp. In Wichita he contacted the local newspaper about his marvelous acquisitions. The story ran in the October 2nd, 1932 edition of the Wichita Beacon announcing that the old guitar had been replaced with the new electric. The article states that Brewer was only the third person to play the amazing instrument (George Beauchamp, an accomplished guitarist himself, and Jack Miller, his friend presumably being the predecessors in research and development). The article went on to describe the new instrument, comparing it to the sound of a pipe organ or orthophonic speaker. A press release of the time promoted a series of Halloween themed concerts and promised that the new instrument was a ‚Äúcombination of natural personal technique and electrical perfection‚Äù. ==References== * * * Category:People from Ellis County, Oklahoma Category:1904 births Category:1985 deaths Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:People from Wichita, Kansas Category:Guitarists from Kansas Category:American male guitarists Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Gage Brewer"},{"id":"20458803","text":"Eduardo Francisco de Silva Neto, also known as Dudu (born February 2, 1980 in Brazil) is a Brazilian footballer, who has currently plays for Bonsucesso Futebol Clube.

The 24-pdr was the largest caliber available to French artillery in this system. The cannon used core drilling of the bore of cannons founded in one piece of bronze, a method developed by Jean Maritz, which allowed for much higher precision of the bore shape and surface, and therefore higher shooting efficiency. As with other de Valli√®re guns, the 12-pdr was also highly decorated and contained numerous designs and inscriptions. ===Front part=== Louis Charles de Bourbon, Comte d'Eu, Duc d'Aumale\\" on Le Tonnerre, 1736.

Under that appears the name \\"Louis Charles de Bourbon, comte d'Eu, duc d'Aumale\\", the Grand Ma√Ætre de l'artillerie de France (Grand Master of the Artillery of France), followed by a royal emblem. In the middle of the cannon are trunnions, used to position the gun in place and elevate or depress it. On top of the trunnions are dolphin-shaped ornaments, which are used in lifting the gun.Springfield Armory ===Back part=== The back part consists of, sometimes, an inscription showing the weight of the cannonball (for example a \\"12\\" for a 12-pounder), followed by a Latin inscription \\"Nec pluribus impar\\", meaning that the King is \\"Not unequal to many (suns)\\". This is followed by the royal crest of the Bourbon dynasty.

It led a general strike and protests in September-October 1990, causing the PCT regime to allow the creation of other political parties.I. William Zartman and Katharina R. Vogeli, \\"Prevention Gained and Prevention Lost: Collapse, Competition, and Coup in Congo\\", in Opportunities Missed, Opportunities Seized: Preventive Diplomacy in the Post-Cold War World (2000), ed. Bruce W. Jentleson, page 270. Bokamba-Yangouma joined the opposition shortly before the February-June 1991 National Conference, playing a key role in ending the PCT regime. He was the First Vice-President of the Higher Council of the Republic during the 1991-92 transitional period leading to multi party elections. Following the 1992 local elections, which were organized by the government of Prime Minister Andr√© Milongo and were widely criticized, Bokamba-Yangouma successfully worked to have Milongo's government deprived of its responsibility for organizing the subsequent parliamentary and presidential elections. Leading a political party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), he was then elected to the National Assembly and became the First Vice-President of the National Assembly. Bokamba-Yangouma, who was allied with President Pascal Lissouba, served as President of the Economic and Social Council until Lissouba was ousted at the end of the June- October 1997 civil war. Bokamba-Yangouma fled into exile at the end of the war. According to Bokamba-Yangouma, he turned to religion during his exile and became a devout Christian. He became the First Vice-President of the Patriotic Front for Dialogue and National Reconciliation (FPDRN), an opposition movement in exile,\\"Coup gagnant pour Sassou Nguesso; Adoption d'un projet de constitution √† l'issue du dialogue intercongolais; L'ancien Premier ministre, Kol√©las, n'a pas pu rentrer √† Brazzaville\\" , Afrique Express, number 227, 18 April 2001 . and in April 2001, he returned to Congo-Brazzaville to participate in a national dialogueJean-Dominique Geslin, \\"Retrouvailles √† Brazza\\", Jeune Afrique, 24 April 2001 . as part of the FPDRN delegation.\\"Congo: Opposition Front for Dialogue to attend all-inclusive dialogue\\", Agence France-Presse, 9 April 2001. He subsequently returned on a permanent basis and met with President Denis Sassou Nguesso. In December 2001, while still President of the UDPS, he became the head of an opposition coalition composed of 44 parties and associations.\\"Congo: Over 40 political groups form platform for electoral \\"transparency\\"\\", Africa No. 1 radio, 24 December 2001.\\"Une nouvelle plate-forme de l'opposition\\" , Afrique Express, number 242, 2 January 2002 . Bokamba-Yangouma later dissolved the UDPS and founded the General Movement of Christians of Congo (Mouvement g√©n√©ral des chr√©tiens du Congo, MGCC), a religiously-oriented party, in May 2004. As President of the MGCC, Bokamba-Yangouma said that the party would be inclusive and that non-Christians could join, \\"provided that they share the ideals of our party\\".\\"Jean-Michel Bokamba Yangouma cr√©√© le MGCC, nouveau parti politique d‚Äôob√©dience chr√©tienne\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 24 May 2004 . Due to a constitutional prohibition on religious political parties, the MGCC was subsequently renamed as the General Movement for the Construction of Congo (Mouvement g√©n√©ral pour la construction du Congo), retaining its acronym.\\"Premi√®re parution publique du Mouvement g√©n√©ral pour la construction du Congo\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 21 March 2005 . The MGCC held its first ordinary congress on 31 March 2007, stressing the importance of love and unity in the development of \\"a new and prosperous Congo\\".Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Le Mouvement g√©n√©ral pour la construction du Congo a tenu son premier congr√®s ordinaire\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 2 April 2007 . Bokamba-Yangouma called for the 2007 parliamentary election to be delayed due to the existence of what he described as a \\"legal vacuum\\"; this was a reference to the fact that a bill providing for the creation of an independent electoral commission had been approved by the National Assembly but not signed into law by Sassou Nguesso in time for the election. Like many other opposition parties, the MGCC boycotted the election.\\"Un collectif de partis d‚Äôopposition appelle au boycott des √©lections l√©gislatives\\", Agence France-Presse, 27 May 2007 . By early 2008, the MGCC identified itself as a centrist party and distanced itself from the opposition.Willy Mbossa, \\"Le Mouvement g√©n√©ral pour la construction du Congo r√©affirme sa participation aux √©lections locales\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 5 February 2008 . Together with another party, the Union for the Reconstruction and Development of Congo (URDC), the MGCC formed a coalition, the Coalition of Center Parties (CPC), in April 2008. Bokamba-Yangouma was designated as the first President of the Coalition.Faustin Akono, \\"Les partis MGCC et URDC forment la ¬´ coalition des partis politiques du centre ¬ª\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 16 April 2008 . Bokamba-Yangouma supported Sassou Nguesso's bid for another term in the July 2009 presidential election. He was included on the 91-member National Coordination of the National Initiative for Peace (INP), a political association promoting Sassou Nguesso's 2009 re- election in conjunction with the preservation of peace, which was launched on 28 February 2009.Thierry Noungou, \\"Plusieurs personnalit√©s proches du pr√©sident Denis Sassou N'Guesso s'organisent autour du concept de la paix\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 2 March 2009 . On 12 April 2012, Bokamba- Yangouma, who was serving as Vice-President of the CPC coalition at the time, was suspended from the coalition on the grounds that he had not respected its rules.Parfait Wilfried Douniama, \\"Vie des partis : Jean-Michel Bokamba Yangouma suspendu de la Coalition des partis du centre\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 12 April 2012 .

From the age of 16, Schmalzigaug travelled extensively. In 1905‚Äì1906 he made a tour of Italy, where he was especially impressed and influenced by Venice. Returning to Antwerp, he became a secretary to the art society of Kunst van Heden/L'Art Contemporain, and worked on the organisation of international exhibitions. Between 1910 and 1912 he lived mainly in Paris. There he had the opportunity to see the exhibition of Italian futurists in 1912, and, impressed, soon decided to move to Italy. His time in Italy between 1912 and 1914 was the happiest and most active part of his life and art. In 1914 he took part in the international exhibition of futurists in Rome.

He was selected with the second overall pick of the 1999 NBA draft and was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in his first season. He was a three-time NBA All-Star while playing for the Houston Rockets. Francis also played for the Orlando Magic and New York Knicks, finishing his career with the Beijing Ducks of the Chinese Basketball Association. He was known for his crossover dribble, driving ability, and flashy dunks. He was given the nickname Stevie Franchise. ==Early life and education== Francis was born and raised in Takoma Park, Maryland. He was nicknamed \\"Wink\\" as a child. After his mother (Brenda) died of cancer in 1995, his grandmother became a parent figure to him. He stopped playing basketball after his mother died. His father served 20 years in federal prison for bank robbery. Francis later described his stepfather, a garbage collector, as his best friend. As a youth, Francis received food stamps and lived in an apartment with 18 people. Francis began working for drug dealers at ten years old and began selling crack cocaine on the street as a teenager during the American crack epidemic. He attended six high schools and played in a total of two high school basketball games. He dropped out of school at 18 years old after his mother died. Francis completed his GED after receiving an offer to play college basketball for San Jacinto College, whose coaches had noticed him at an Amateur Athletic Union tournament. Francis attended San Jacinto College in 1996‚Äì97, and the Allegany College of Maryland in 1997‚Äì98. Francis became the first player to take two unbeaten teams into the National Junior College Tournament. In a game for Allegany, Francis recorded a quadruple double against Shawn Marion and Vincennes University. ==University of Maryland== Francis transferred to Maryland in 1998 for his junior season. The addition of Francis helped propel the Terrapins to a #5 preseason ranking. Francis made an instant impact as Maryland's starting shooting guard, scoring 17 points in the season opener against Western Carolina. Francis and the Terps gained national attention with impressive showings in the Puerto Rico Shootout and a 62‚Äì60 win over #5 Stanford in the BB&T; Classic. The Terps climbed to a #2 national ranking by early December. The Terrapins finished second in the ACC and Francis was named to the All-ACC first team and the All ACC Tournament team. The Terrapins were a number 2 seed in the NCAA tournament but were defeated by St. John's in the Sweet 16. Under Francis's leadership, Maryland finished with a school record 28 wins and only 6 losses and were ranked #5 in the final Associated Press poll. Francis finished the season averaging 17 points per game, 4.5 assists per game, and 2.8 steals per game. He was a consensus second-team All-American and was named a finalist for the Wooden and Naismith Player of the Year Awards. Although he stated he was \\"99% sure\\" he would return to Maryland for his senior season, he opted to enter the NBA draft. While a member of the Terrapins, Francis met Idan Ravin, who at the time was coaching youth basketball. Francis soon began attending Ravin's workouts and recommended Ravin as trainer to fellow college players, including Elton Brand. Ravin subsequently became a well-known trainer for a number of NBA players.Ballard, Chris (2009) The Art of a Beautiful Game: The Thinking Fan's Tour of the NBA. New York: Simon and Schuster, pages 150-160 ==NBA careerHouston Rockets (1999‚Äì2004)=== Francis was selected second in the 1999 NBA draft by the Vancouver Grizzlies. He publicly announced that he did not want to play for the Grizzlies, citing the distance from his Maryland home, taxes, endorsements, and God's will. Heavily criticized for his antics, especially in Vancouver, he relented and briefly considered joining the Grizzlies before contentious negotiations and an incident at Vancouver International Airport convinced Francis that he needed to go elsewhere. Francis got his wish, being traded before the 1999‚Äì2000 season began to the Houston Rockets in a three- team, 11-player deal that brought Michael Dickerson, Othella Harrington, Antoine Carr and Brent Price, plus first- and second-round picks to the Grizzlies. It was the largest trade in NBA history at that time. Though Francis shared Rookie of the Year honors with Elton Brand and finished as runner-up to Vince Carter in the 2000 Slam Dunk Contest, the Rockets finished the season with a 34‚Äì48 record. The next season, the Rockets improved to 45-37 but still missed the playoffs. In his third season, Francis was chosen by fans to start the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, but ended up playing only 55 games due to a foot injury and recurring M√©ni√®re's-induced migraines. As a result, the Rockets posted a dismal 28‚Äì54 record, landing them into the lottery, where they selected 7'6\\" Chinese center Yao Ming with the first pick in the 2002 NBA Draft. Francis and Yao gelled their first season together, and were selected as 2003 NBA All-Star Game starters. Francis scored a career-high 44 points in a nationally televised home win against the Los Angeles Lakers on January 17, 2003. The team went 43‚Äì39, again missing the playoffs. Rockets head coach Rudy Tomjanovich stepped down in 2003, and the team selected ex-New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy as his successor. Van Gundy's coaching style did not fit Francis's style of play. Even though Francis made the All-Star game for a third straight year his stats declined in 2003‚Äì04, dropping from 21.0 PPG, 6.2 RPG, and 6.2 APG to 16.6 PPG, 5.5 RPG, and 6.2 APG. The Rockets, however, made the playoffs for the first time since 1999, which would be Francis's only postseason experience. Despite his averaging 19.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, and 7.6 apg, the Rockets lost to the heavily favored Los Angeles Lakers in five games. As Francis's relationship with Van Gundy deteriorated it was apparent that the Rockets wanted to go in a different direction. While the coach sought to focus the team's offense on Yao Ming, the Rockets ended up trading Francis, along with his best friend on the team, Cuttino Mobley, as well as Kelvin Cato, for Tracy McGrady, Juwan Howard, Tyronn Lue, and Reece Gaines. During Francis's first tenure in Houston, he averaged 19.3 points, 6.4 assists, 6.1 rebounds, and 1.63 steals in 374 games (372 starts). Francis (left) talking with Chauncey Billups. ===Orlando Magic (2004‚Äì2006)=== At first, Francis was unhappy with the trade to Orlando, but he adapted to his new environment. Francis flourished in the run n' gun offense of interim head coach Chris Jent. After posting a career-low 16.6 points per game the previous year with the Rockets, Francis averaged 21.3 PPG, 5.8 RPG and 7.0 APG in his first season with the Magic. The Magic started out the year fast in the 2004‚Äì05 season, with Francis hitting several game-winning shots early in the season. In the middle of the season, Mobley was traded to the Sacramento Kings, which upset Francis. The Magic slumped late and missed the playoffs. The following season, a disgruntled Francis was suspended for conduct detrimental to the team. On February 5, 2006, there were rumors that he could be traded to the Denver Nuggets for Earl Watson but GM Otis Smith publicly announced that he would not trade Francis. Still, rumors persisted that Francis would be traded to the New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers, Minnesota Timberwolves, Denver Nuggets or even back to his former team the Houston Rockets. ===New York Knicks (2006‚Äì2007)=== On February 22, 2006, one day before the NBA's trade deadline, Francis was traded to the New York Knicks for small forward Trevor Ariza and the expiring contract of shooting guard Anfernee \\"Penny\\" Hardaway. Prior to the trade, the Nuggets reportedly offered both Watson and Kenyon Martin for Francis, but the deal never took place. He made his Madison Square Garden debut on Friday, February 24 when the Knicks faced the New Jersey Nets, and scored 16 points in a 94‚Äì90 loss for the Knicks. He wore jersey #1 with the Knicks as his usual #3 was already assigned to Stephon Marbury. Francis has endured a recurring injury, tendinitis in his right knee, and as a result began the 2006‚Äì07 season averaging only 11.3 ppg, as opposed to his career 18.4 ppg. He returned on February 10, 2007 vs the Utah Jazz. On March 10, Francis hit a game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer against the Washington Wizards, ending one of his best games as a Knick in his hometown. On 2007 draft night, June 28, the Knicks traded Francis and Channing Frye to the Portland Trail Blazers for Zach Randolph, Dan Dickau, and Fred Jones; Portland then bought out the remaining two years of Francis's contract for a reported $30 million, making him an unrestricted free agent. ===Return to Houston (2007‚Äì2008)=== The Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, and the L. A. Clippers pursued Francis. On July 20, he chose the Rockets, signing a two- year $6 million contract with them, although the Heat offered the most money. But he failed to make Rick Adelman's rotation coming out of the preseason. He averaged 5.5 points and 3 assists in ten games before undergoing season-ending surgery stemming from an earlier left quadriceps tendon injury. Francis used his contract option to come back to the Houston Rockets for the 2008‚Äì09 NBA season. He lost 15 pounds for training camp, but was not able to play in the beginning of the season due to the recovery period of his injury. On December 24, 2008, the Houston Rockets traded Francis back to the team that had originally drafted him, the Grizzlies, except now the team was in Memphis. This trade was for a 2011 conditional draft pick. The move allowed the Rockets to drop under the luxury tax threshold. On January 27, 2009, it was reported that Francis was waived by the Grizzlies, without having appeared in a game for them. No other NBA teams expressed an interest in Francis. ===Chinese Basketball Association=== In November 2010, Francis signed with the Beijing Ducks of China. He averaged 0.5 points and 0.7 rebounds over four games, playing 14 minutes, before leaving the team in late December of the same year to return to the United States. ==Personal life== On September 27, 2001, a tornado struck the University of Maryland, College Park campus, killing two students and displacing 700 more from their dormitory. Francis, who was on campus at the time, arranged to sponsor a dinner for the displaced students before he flew back to Houston for his third season with the Rockets. He said, \\"I remember all of the people here supporting me while I was a Maryland student, and this is just a small way that I can give back to those who have helped me.\\" Former Maryland star Francis returns to boost spirits after campus tornado, National Collegiate Athletic Association, October 8, 2001. On February 17, 2002, Francis's #23 jersey was honored by Maryland in a ceremony preceding the game against the #1 ranked Duke Blue Devils. Francis sat on the team's bench during the game and cheered as the Terrapins upset the Blue Devils 87‚Äì73. On election day 2008, Francis supported presidential candidate Barack Obama by wearing a red velvet sports jacket with \\"Barack Obama\\" spelled on the back in sequins. Francis said he had followed the presidential race closely. \\"It's important that there is an African-American candidate running\\", Francis said. \\"I never thought I'd see the day that would happen. Right now, we're at a pivotal point. It's a great feeling for me.\\" Francis has suffered from M√©ni√®re's disease, which causes episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and aural fullness.Down-shifting: with encouragement from the anxious Rockets, Steve Francis is restricting his high-flying game to reduce the risk of a crash landing, findarticles.com; accessed March 3, 2015.

After Francis left professional basketball and his stepfather committed suicide, he began drinking heavily.

He was also recognized by then-Mayor Vilma Santos as the second PBA player from his hometown in Lipa City after Melchor Teves, who also graduated from De La Salle Lipa. In 2006, Dimaunahan was also part of a controversial PBA seven player trade involving Rudy Hatfield, Billy Mamaril, Rafi Reavis, and Ervin Sotto. Because sister teams such as Ginebra and Coca-Cola are not allowed to trade directly, nor can their under-teams, which applied to San Miguel Beer and Purefoods. In order to circumvent the rules, a third team, Air21 was involved in the trade, which ultimately sent Dimaunahan to Air21. After playing 2 seasons with the Barako Bull Energy Boosters, he was signed by the Alaska Aces as a free agent during the 2011 Governors Cup. In 2012, while with the San Miguel Beermen, he was one of five players suspended for taking place in a Basket-Brawl involving the Beermen and the entire bench of the AirAsia Philippine Patriots. After retiring as a player, Dimaunahan began a coaching career, with stints both professionally and in women's college basketball. In 2015 he served as an assistant coach with the Blackwater Elite, and in 2017 he became an assistant coach for the Pinatumba ng Lady Bulldogs.

Rulemaking by the specialist agencies in the executive branch adds necessary detail to these laws. Rulemaking also provides an administration with an opportunity to exert political influence over government without having to go through Congress to change the law. U.S. federal law mandates a 60-day waiting period before any major regulatory changes become law. Thus, some presidents try to publish new major regulations on November 21, 60 days before the new president's inauguration on January 20. \\"Minor\\" regulations, or those that have less than US$100 million in effect on the economy or do not have major social policy significance, have a similar 30-day waiting period. Tom Firey, of the Cato Institute's Regulation magazine, argues that most midnight regulations are in fact primarily political symbolism rather than major regulatory change. Regulations that have not yet become law can be placed on hold by the incoming President. Regulations that take effect before a new president takes office can still be reversed by the same executive agencies, but this requires a considerable rule-making process. In addition, reversing recently enacted regulations may distract an incoming administration from its own regulatory agenda. Alternatively, because regulations are executive branch agencies' interpretations of statutes passed by Congress, Congress can effectively overturn the regulations by passing more explicit statutory mandates. But in each case the period in which the disfavored regulations are law may permit undesired results to take place. For example, a heavily polluting power plant could be built in the period that a federal regulation is law. A third option is for Congress to overturn the regulation under the Congressional Review Act of 1996, requiring congressional approval for any similar rule issued in the future. Of the 50,000 regulations enacted since the Act was passed, only fifteen have been so overturned. ==History== Jimmy Carter was the first president to make extensive use of midnight regulations. The term \\"midnight regulation\\" entered the lexicon in 1980‚Äì81, during the final months of Jimmy Carter's single term as president.Antony Davies and Veronique de Rugy (March 2008), Midnight Regulations: An Update, Mercatus Center, George Washington University, Working Paper No. 08-06 Carter's administration set a new record for midnight regulations by publishing more than 10,000 pages of new rules between Election Day and Ronald Reagan's Inauguration Day. The term is an allusion to the \\"midnight judges\\" appointed by John Adams in the final months of his presidency. Due to midnight regulations, since 1948, during the period between a presidential election and the inauguration of a president of a different party, the Federal Register has averaged 17 percent more pages than during the same period in non-election years.Cindy Skrzycki, Bush Wants Sun to Set on Midnight Regulations, The Washington Post, Tuesday, June 3, 2008; Page D03 ===Bill Clinton=== The Clinton Administration enacted a flurry of rules limiting logging and lead paint, raising appliance energy efficiency, and tightening privacy of medical records. One of Clinton's midnight regulations imposed a more stringent drinking water standard for arsenic after years of EPA study. Although Bush suspended the new regulation upon taking office, EPA head Christine Todd Whitman eventually approved it. When President George W. Bush took office in 2001, his administration acted to block the implementation of 90 final rules that were issued in the final months of the Clinton administration but that had not yet gone into effect. ===George W. Bush=== Bush Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten wrote a memo encouraging Administration agencies to pass rules in time for them to become law before the end of Bush's second term. The Bush administration also approved thousands of pages of dozens of new agency rules, setting a new record. Many of these regulations were promulgated in the hope of ensuring enactment before Barack Obama took office and could prevent the rules from becoming law. Bush Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten encouraged timely passage of the rules in a May 2008 memo to agencies suggesting that final versions be submitted by November 1. Finalized and proposed rules included: * A finalized rule that effectively deregulates industrial farms * An adopted rule that opens up public land to drilling preliminary to the development of oil shale extraction * A proposed rule that provides for a conscience clause for workers at hospitals receiving federal money (particularly state hospitals), allowing them to refuse to perform abortions or dispense contraceptives Several other rules were already adopted in late 2008, including one increasing truck drivers' maximum hours of service to eleven and another restricting employee time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act. The rules attracted considerable criticism. Hours after Obama took office, his administration ordered all executive branch agencies to halt enactment of any rules proposed during the Bush Administration until the incoming administration could review them. According to the environmentalist magazine Grist, these efforts were effective in only a few cases; for other environmental rules the Obama administration tried to reverse some rules through Congress and some through the same slow administrative rulemaking process while interest groups challenged other environmental regulations in the courts. A subcommittee on administrative law in the Democratic House of Representatives held a hearing on midnight regulations the month after Obama's inauguration. === Barack Obama === The Obama Administration recognized the potential for midnight regulations as early as the end of 2015. Howard Shelanski, the Administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), issued a memo to federal agencies directing them to: ‚ÄúTo the extent feasible and consistent with your priorities, statutory obligations, and judicial deadlines, however, agencies should strive to complete their highest priority rulemakings by the summer of 2016 to avoid an end-of-year scramble that has the potential to lower the quality of regulations that OIRA receives for review and to tax the resources available for interagency review.‚Äù In the Obama Administration‚Äôs final Unified Agenda, there were 25 notable rules in the ‚Äúmidnight period‚Äù with combined regulatory cost estimates (from the ‚Äúproposed rule‚Äù versions) of approximately $44.1 billion. Starting in November 2016 (the first month of the Obama ‚Äúmidnight period‚Äù), OIRA concluded review of 57 rule-makings ‚Äì a 26 percent increase over the monthly pace from the rest of 2016. Fourteen of these measures were ‚Äúeconomically significant‚Äù rule-makings. That represents the second-highest total in any November ‚Äúmidnight period‚Äù since at least 1996. Notable rulemakings from November 2016 include: * Conservation Standards for Ceiling FansOIRA Conclusion of EO 12866 Regulatory Review * Revision of Nutrition Facts for Meat and PoultryRevision of Nutrition Facts for Meat and Poultry * Passenger Equipment Safety StandardsPassenger Equipment Safety Standards * Renewable Fuel Standards for 2017Renewable Fuel Standards for 2017 House Republicans introduced legislation that would provide a check upon Obama administration midnight rules. Representative Darrell Issa introduced H.R. 5982, or the ‚ÄúMidnight Rules Relief Act of 2016‚Äù, that ‚Äúamends the Congressional Review Act to allow Congress to consider a joint resolution to disapprove multiple regulations that federal agencies have submitted for congressional review within the last 60 legislative days of a session of Congress during the final year of a President's term.‚Äù The bill passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 240‚Äì179. Senator Ron Johnson has written letters to Shelanski and multiple other agencies asking them to put a hold on regulatory activity during this ‚Äúmidnight period‚Äù. ==References== Category:United States administrative law Category:United States Presidential transitions ","title":"Midnight regulations"},{"id":"20459229","text":"Mark Neveldine (born May 11, 1973) is an American film director, film producer, screenwriter and camera operator.

The controversy involved the argument that his execution violated the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Atkins v. Virginia (2002), which held that executions of intellectually disabled criminals is cruel and unusual punishment, which is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Clark and his accomplice, James Richard Brown, were charged with capital murder for the June 7, 1993 killing of 16-year-old Jesus Garza, and the robbery, rape and murder of 17-year-old Shari Catherine \\"Cari\\" Crews in Denton County, Texas. However, Clark was never tried for the Garza murder, and Brown was found guilty of only the robbery charge, for which he was sentenced to 20 years. ==Early life== Clark was born in Caddo Parish, Louisiana. Court documents revealed that his father disappeared the day he found out Clark's mother was pregnant. Testimony from a psychologist at his appeals hearing stated that Clark told him he had his first drink when he was seven years old and was commonly drunk by the age of 13, at which point he also began to smoke cannabis regularly. After failing two grades and being placed in special education classes he dropped out of school in the ninth grade. At the age of 15 he was remanded into the Gainesville State School, a reformatory for boys and girls in Gainesville, Texas, for auto theft. At that time his mother told the Texas Youth Commission that he \\"has no friends in school ... because he steals from them all.\\" Clark was subsequently diagnosed as having a \\"conduct disorder, associated with psychological deprivation, coupled with features of immature personality.\\" At the Gainesville State School, Clark was able to complete his GED and was released at the age of 18 to find his mother had abandoned him, wanting nothing more to do with him. ==Criminal history== In 1989 Clark was convicted of a felony - the burglary of a building - and incarcerated in state prison. In 1991 he pleaded guilty to theft by a check and was confined to the county jail for 20 days, fined, and ordered to pay restitution. In 1992 he was convicted of burglary and received a 10-year sentence in prison, which is where he met Brown. On May 26, 1993, after serving only ten months of his sentence, Clark was granted parole due to the problem of overcrowding in the Texas prison system. Two weeks later Clark and Brown were arrested for the Crews and Garza murders. ==Murder of Catherine Crews and Jesus Garza== On June 4, 1993, Clark and Brown participated in breaking into vehicles, stole a shotgun and a rifle, and went in search of someone to rob. In the early morning hours of June 7, 1993, they came upon Crews and Garza at Clear Creek near Denton, Texas, and the following day their bodies were pulled from the water. Crews' body was discovered nude with a pair of shorts around her neck and her wrists bound with her own bra. She had been raped and had died from a shotgun wound to the back of her head. Garza had been also killed by a close- range shotgun blast originating below his chin. Also recovered from the creek were a .22 rifle with the stock sawed off and the murder weapon, a 12-gauge shotgun. That same morning, paramedics and police officers responded to a call of a gunshot victim at a local service station. Upon arrival they found Brown with a serious shotgun wound to the leg, attended by Clark, who claimed they had been attacked by a robber who shot Brown while they were fishing at Three Rivers Bridge. However, no evidence was found at that scene to support the claim of the crime, or that anyone had been present on the location or fishing at that time. Both suspects were covered with white sand consistent with the banks of Clear Creek. Confronted with this evidence, Brown led police to Garza's body. Subsequent investigation discovered that Brown had actually shot himself at point-blank range in the act of assaulting the teens. Due to Clark and Brown's conflicting statements, a search warrant was obtained to search the trailer Clark and Brown shared, in violation of their paroles, located in Aubrey, Texas. There police discovered the stock to the sawed-off rifle, which was a match to the rifle found in the creek, as well as ammunition and evidence that, days prior to the murder, Clark and Brown had purchased ammunition for the murder weapon. DNA evidence provided by Clark matched evidence taken from Crews' body, proving that Clark had sexually assaulted her. Additionally, blood determined to be that of Brown, Crews and Garza was found splattered on Clark's shoes. Both men were arrested at the Aubrey trailer after moderate resistance. They ultimately admitted they had been at Clear Creek, first claiming they witnessed Garza shoot Crews, before eventually admitting they had indeed robbed the teens. Each blamed the other for the actual murders. Clark claimed that it was Brown who instigated the crime and shot himself using the rifle as a bludgeon on Garza, after which he killed both teens. Brown countered that it was Clark who committed the murders. On September 12, 2000, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals would find in favor of Brown's version of the story, on the grounds that with Brown's injury occurring prior to the murders, Clark must have unloaded the spent cartridge and reloaded the shotgun. ==Conviction and appeals== The Ellis Unit housed the State of Texas death row for men until 1999. Allan B. Polunsky Unit houses the State of Texas death row for men. Huntsville Unit, the location of the Texas state execution chamber On April 29, 1994, a jury in Denton County convicted James Lee Clark of robbery and the murder and rape of Crews. On May 3, 1994 Judge Sam Houston sentenced Clark to death. Clark was initially located in the Ellis Unit, but was transferred to the Allan B. Polunsky Unit (formerly the Terrell Unit) in 1999.\\"Death Row Facts.\\" Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Retrieved on February 4, 2016. Clark filed an appeal asserting he had been denied effective assistance of counsel because his original trial attorneys, Richard Podgorski and Henry Paine, made no opening arguments, called no witnesses for guilt or innocence in either the trial or penalty phase, and did not perform adequate discovery, having made no attempt to contact or interview any members of Clark's family or other relevant persons from his past. In fact, there is no evidence they even pursued these avenues despite the Supreme Court ruling, Wiggins v. Smith (2003), that established standards for effective legal counsel, stating that counsel must perform a reasonable exploration of investigation in constituting defense strategy or risk creating an unconstitutional deprivation of rights to effective counsel. Brown's trial for the murder of Garza was delayed due to the injury of his leg, and at his trial he was depicted as appearing \\"young and defenseless as he sat at the defense table in a wheelchair\\". Brown admitted to the robbery, but denied involvement in the murders, describing how he was shot in the act of trying to prevent the crime, and expressed remorse for his acts. Ultimately, he was convicted of only the robberies, was sentenced to 20 years, and has since been denied for parole twice. On October 6, 1996, the court upheld James Lee Clark's conviction and sentence on direct appeal. On October 15, 1996, his trial attorneys informed Clark they would no longer represent him and were replaced by James Rasmussen. On April 19, 1997, Clark filed a writ of habeas corpus with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals challenging the validity of his conviction and sentence and asserting eleven grounds for relief, including his claim of ineffectual counsel. The courts denied his application on July 8, 1998, without ever holding an evidentiary hearing, choosing instead to simply review the court records. On July 27, 1998, Clark appealed this decision to the United States district court; the appeal was denied on December 13, 1999, again without allowing discovery or an evidentiary hearing. On January 12, 2000, he requested the district court review this decision, which was denied on January 28, 2000, including his petition to reexamine his claim of mental retardation being a mitigating circumstance to the crimes. After the landmark Supreme Court decision in Atkins v. Virginia (2002), which outlawed the execution of persons deemed mentally retarded, Clark moved his sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. The Supreme Court did not specifically outline exact definitions for \\"mental retardation\\" and suggested states follow the definition used by the American Association on Mental Retardation (which generally stated that an IQ less than 70 with two or more supporting limitations be used as the guideline), leaving ultimate decision to the individual states. The State of Texas adopted two definitions, both of which contain the same three basic elements, that mental retardation was a disability characterized by \\"significantly subaverage\\" intellectual functioning, accompanied with \\"related limitations in adaptive functioning\\" and a documented onset of these characterizations prior to the age of 18. Further, they determined that in testing for retardation \\"scores gathered through intelligence testing are necessarily imprecise and must be interpreted flexibly.\\" The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Clark did not meet any of the three criteria for retardation, and affirmed the lower court ruling to uphold his conviction and sentence. An execution date was set for November 21, 2002. However, on November 18, 2002 the execution was stayed pending further examination of Clark's assertion of being mentally retarded, pursuant to the Atkins ruling. In April 2003 Clark was assessed by clinical psychologist Dr. George C. Denkowski, who had previously assessed four other post-Atkins cases and concluded only one of the four had clear mental retardation under the statutes. Denkowski performed a six-hour examination of Clark, administering the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS). He determined that Clark had an IQ of 65 and had adaptive skills deficits in the areas of health, safety, social and work, thus clearly falling under the restrictions set by the Atkins ruling. Despite the fact that the Harris County Prosecutor cited Denkowski's expertise in upholding his findings in the other four cases, Denton County District Attorney Bruce Isaacks rejected the findings, fired Denkowski and hired Dr. Thomas Allen to assess the possibility that Clark was faking mental retardation. After interviewing Clark for two hours and 16 minutes, during which Allen did not perform any standardized tests to determine Clark's IQ, Allen determined that Clark was indeed faking his retardation by intentionally presenting himself as less intelligent to avoid execution. He cited the fact that Clark's prison cell contained copies of newspaper articles, crossword puzzles and a copy of the Charles Dickens book A Tale of Two Cities. It was ultimately revealed that none of the puzzles had been completed, the articles were about the Atkins case and had been sent to him from people outside the prison as gifts. Clark had stated that he had never read the book. The defense then hired their own doctor to do an assessment of Clark, choosing Dr. Denis Keyes, whose expert studies had been cited in the actual Atkins ruling. Keyes examined Clark over two sessions lasting a total of seven and a half hours, administering the Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and found that Clark had an IQ of 68. Keyes stated that he felt Clark's ability to behave appropriately for his age was \\"virtually nonexistent\\" and concluded that Clark should not be executed, citing both the Texas Mentally Retarded Persons Act and the Atkins ruling. Keyes stated, \\"Individuals with mental retardation typically have severe deficits in judgment potential, and are simply unable to understand the consequences of their behaviors. People with mental retardation have several characteristics; among these are defective intellectual capacity, shorter attention spans, poor memory, poor planning ability, lack of ability to appreciate the consequences of their actions, severe learning problems, marked deficits in adaptive skill areas, and limited ability to learn from previous experience. James's background confirms problems with virtually every one of the above characteristics.\\" Additionally, Keyes noted his support of Dendowski's findings, calling them \\"credible and correct\\" and his opinion that Allen's assessment did not meet the legally required guidelines for diagnosis and ruling out a diagnosis, based on his failure to perform accepted standardized testing. Both Denkowski and Keyes rejected Allen's diagnosis and agreed that Clark was not faking his mental retardation. On November 17, 2003 a hearing, presided over by Judge Lee Gabriel, was held to examine this evidence. Gabriel, over defense objections, ruled that Clark would appear in court handcuffed, shackled, and wearing an electroshock stun belt, On November 20, after a three-day hearing, Gabriel rejected the findings of both Keyes and Denkowski and accepted those of Allen, ruling that Clark did not meet the legal standards for mental retardation. She cited a 1983 IQ test administered at the Gainesville State School indicating Clark's IQ at 74, stating that as it was given to Clark as a youth it was a more reliable standard as he had \\"no reason to fake results at that point.\\" Dr. Jim Flynn, an expert on changes in IQ scores over time (the Flynn effect) wrote that \\"the best estimate\\" of Clark's IQ in 2003 would be 68.57 (similar to what Keyes determined), and \\"it is almost certain that [Clark's IQ] is not 70 or above.\\" In further support of her ruling, Gabriel allowed and gave weight to testimony from untrained lay people whose statements were of anecdotal nature and unreliable. One such witness was Clark's former landlord, who readily admitted she had memory problems, who testified that she believed that Clark's ability to pay his own bills, barter chores for rent reduction and capacity to play card games similar to Uno, meant he could not be retarded. This was in direct conflict with the Texas Persons With Mental Retardation Act which dictates, \\"'Person with mental retardation' means a person determined by a physician or psychologist licensed in this state or certified by the department to have subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive behavior.' That is, only a licensed physician or psychologist may determine who's mentally retarded. Anecdotal information, or the opinions of untrained laypeople is not meaningful.\\" None-the-less, Judge Gabriel declared Clark fit for execution. On January 20, 2005, the district court rendered final judgment denying the successive habeas corpus petition, which was overturned on March 16, 2005 when the district court granted Clark's application for a certificate of appealability. However, on July 20, 2006, the 5th Circuit Court affirmed the judgment January 2005 ruling and denied habeas relief. On August 29, 2006, the court denied Clark's petition for rehearing. Finally, on February 26, 2007, the Supreme Court denied Clark's petition for writ of certiorari. The trial court reset his execution date for April 11, 2007 and on February 28, 2007 Judge Gabriel signed the execution order. ==Execution== The case drew international attention and campaigns to stop the execution were waged by Amnesty International, Amnesty USA, Petitions Online, Urgent Action Network, Texas Moratorium Network and other anti-death penalty groups. On April 11, 2007, the day of the execution, the Steinway piano that John Lennon used to compose the 1971 song \\"Imagine\\" was placed outside the front door of the prison as a protest to the execution, a sign of peace and statement that there is too much violence in the world. That same day, Texas Governor Rick Perry refused to commute the death sentence. Two hours prior to the execution, the Supreme Court denied a last-minute appeal, and at 6:17 pm, James Lee Clark was executed in the Walls Unit of Huntsville Prison by means of lethal injection. He requested no final meal. When asked if he had any final words he gave a nervous chuckle and stated, \\"Uh, I don't know. Um, I don't know what to say. I don't know ‚Ä¶\\" He then seemed to notice the witnesses in the gallery and added, \\"I didn't know anybody was there,\\" he laughed again and said, \\"Howdy.\\" The lethal cocktail of medications were administered, and Clark made a gurgling sound and became still. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:2007 deaths Category:21st-century executions by Texas Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Texas Category:21st-century executions of American people Category:People executed for murder Category:People executed by Texas by lethal injection Category:People from Caddo Parish, Louisiana Category:American rapists Category:Executed people from Louisiana ","title":"James Lee Clark"},{"id":"20459277","text":"Savjibhai Korat (6 August 1953 ‚Äì 26 November 1998) was an Indian politician, a cabinet minister of Gujarat state.

It is common at depths greater than down to and can reach a diameter of 1.8 metres (6 feet). It is typically brownish-red to brownish-gray in color, with a hard or stony texture. The giant barrel sponge has been called the \\"redwood of the reef\\" because of its size and estimated lifespan of hundreds to a thousand or more years. It is perhaps the best-studied species of sponge in the sea; a population on Conch Reef, in the Florida Keys, has been monitored and studied since 1997. ==Description== The giant barrel sponge is variable in form. It is very large and firm, typically being barrel-shaped, with a cone-shaped cavity at the apex known as the osculum. However, some individuals within the same population may be low and squat or relatively tall and thin. Similarly, the surface can range from smooth to rough, rugged, and irregular, sometimes with buttresses. In shallow water the color is brownish-red to brownish-gray, but at greater depths and in caves and under-hangs, or when the sponge is undergoing cyclic bleaching events, it is pinkish or white. ==Distribution, habitat, and climate needs== The giant barrel sponge is common on reefs throughout the Caribbean Sea, the Bahamas, Bermuda and the reefs and hard-bottom areas of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. In terms of benthic surface coverage, it is the second most abundant sponge on reefs in the Caribbean region. On the reefs off the Florida Keys, it may be as common at two individuals per square metre (yard), and the total biomass of the sponge is greater than any other benthic invertebrate. The sponge grows on any hard surface; the smallest individuals observed are about 1 cm. Two or more closely related species that are visually indistinguishable from X. muta are found on reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans (particularly Xestospongia testudinaria). ==Biology== Two cleaner shrimp (Stenopus hispidus) using a giant barrel sponge as a cleaning station The giant barrel sponge is a filter feeder. Water is continually pumped into the sides of the sponge, through the sponge body, and out of the osculum at the top of the sponge. Small pores in the sponge body are connected to channels lined by collar cells, each with a flagellum, and the beating of these flagellae draws water through the channels. Incoming particles, particularly microscopic bacteria and prochlorophytes, are phagocytosed by the collar cells. Sponges like X. muta also absorb dissolved organic compounds directly from the seawater as part of their diet. The giant barrel sponge is probably dioecious, and spawns its eggs or sperm directly into the water column. Clouds of sperm from males are emitted from the osculum, while females produce flocculent masses of eggs that are slightly negatively buoyant. Spawning can occur at any time of the year, and occurs patchily on the reef, but usually with many individuals participating at the same time. Fertilization occurs in the water column. Resulting sponge larvae disperse with ocean currents, but there is some genetic differentiation among populations from Florida, the Bahamas and Belize. Growth models for X. muta have been formulated from digital photographs of the same sponges over a period of 4.5 years. Sponge growth rates ranged from over 400% per year to only 2% per year. The largest sponges on Conch Reef, about the size of an oil barrel, were estimated to be about 130 years old. The largest individual for which a photograph was available (now dead) was estimated to be 2300 years old. By using the growth model, the age of an individual X. muta can be estimated from the osculum diameter and the base circumference. ==Ecology== Xestospongia muta on Conch Reef, Florida Keys, dying of \\"sponge orange band.\\" 2 June 2015, 15 m depth. The tissues of the giant barrel sponge contain photosynthetic symbiotic cyanobacteria which give the sponge its color. Individuals may undergo periodic bleaching, but this is a cyclic event, and the sponge recovers its normal coloration over time. Unlike the circumstances for coral bleaching, X. muta does not appear to rely on its photosynthetic symbionts for nutrition, and they are considered commensals. Unrelated to cyclic bleaching is a pathogenic condition of X. muta called \\"sponge orange band\\" that can result in the death of the sponge. The cause and transmission of this pathogenic condition remains a mystery. The giant barrel sponge is an important member of the reef community. It serves as a habitat for various invertebrates which live on the surface or in the interior and is grazed upon by some parrotfish. It is also host to a diverse community of microbes, some of which are primary producers or involved in nitrification. ==References== Category:Petrosina Category:Sponges described in 1870 ","title":"Giant barrel sponge"},{"id":"20459371","text":" The Barnegat class was a large class of United States Navy small seaplane tenders (AVP) built during World War II. Thirty were completed as seaplane tenders, four as motor torpedo boat tenders, and one as a catapult training ship.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922-1946, p. 157 ==Design== Before World War II, the United States Navy foresaw a need for a large force of seaplane tenders in the event of a war in the Pacific, to allow air operations from undeveloped islands and atolls. Full-size seaplane tenders (AVs) were designed to support two squadrons of flying boats each, but they were more expensive to build and had a deep draft, precluding their use in shallow harbors. The U.S. Navy therefore also planned for \\"small seaplane tenders\\" (AVPs), with a shallower draft, capable of supporting only one squadron each, but cheaper to build and able to operate in shallow waters. The AVPs were not the descendants of the \\"seaplane tenders (destroyer)\\" (AVDs), which were converted from old destroyers because the Barnegat class could not be built quickly enough to meet the needs of the Navy at the start of the war. Both the full-size and small seaplane tenders were designed to provide supplies, spare parts, fuel, repairs, and berthing for assigned seaplane squadrons, and were well-armed so that they could serve as the primary line of defense of the seaplane bases they set up. The Barnegat-class ships were the first purpose-built AVPs, prior ships carrying that designation having been minesweepers. In addition to carrying out the above-described responsibilities, they were well-enough armed to be employed as escorts for larger seaplane tenders, having a substantial anti-air and anti-surface gunnery capability, as well as depth charge racks and sonar for antisubmarine work. The gun battery varied greatly, being envisioned originally as two 5-inch (127-millimeter) 38-caliber guns, being expanded to an assigned total of four such guns in 1942. Few ships mounted four of these guns, and batteries of three, two, or one 5-inch guns were mounted during World War II, accompanied by various combinations of 40-millimeter and 20 mm antiaircraft guns. The armament was reduced after the war; those ships in commission as survey ships were entirely unarmed by 1959. The ships were reliable, long- ranged, and seaworthy, and had good habitability. In the spring of 1943, the U.S. Navy concluded that the number of Barnegats ordered was excess to requirements. Four of them were converted during construction to motor torpedo boat tenders, while a fifth was modified during construction for use as a catapult training ship for battleship and cruiser floatplane pilots, her catapult equipment coming from that manufactured for canceled Cleveland-class light cruisers. Six other Barnegats were canceled‚Äîfour on 22 April 1943 and two more on 29 April 1943 ‚Äì without having been laid down, their diesel engines being needed for various escort ships and amphibious landing craft. Three Barnegats were selected in 1945 for conversion to press information ships in anticipation of the 1945-1946 invasion of Japan, but when the war ended without this invasion being necessary they were converted back into seaplane tenders. ==Naming== The class was named for its lead unit, Barnegat. A few of the ships were named after islands, but the vast majority were named after bodies of water, mostly bays and inlets, around the United States and the then-Territory of Alaska. ==Operations== The ships entered service between 1941 and 1946, and all but three of them were commissioned in time to participate in combat actions in World War II. The motor torpedo boat tenders served in the Pacific during the latter half of the war, while the seaplane tenders saw service in virtually every theater in which the United States Navy operated during the war.See the various ship articles in the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships at https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs.html and at NavSource.org Small Seaplane Tenders (AVP) at http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/43/43idx.htm. The combination of the post-World War II downsizing of the U.S. Navy and the decline of the seaplane and motor torpedo boat in U.S. naval operations meant that all but the newest ships decommissioned in 1946 and 1947. Those that did stay on in service as seaplane tenders decommissioned between the mid-1950s and 1960s, some seeing service in the Korean War (1950-1953). The last unit did not leave U.S. Navy service until 1973. However, the ships proved versatile and durable, and had long second lives postwar. One became a specialized flagship late in her life. Some became oceanographic and hydrographic survey ships, either in U.S. Navy, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, or Greek service. Eighteen were transferred to the United States Coast Guard ‚Äì where they became known as Casco-class cutters ‚Äì between 1946 and 1949 for service mostly as weather reporting ships, a role they played until the late 1960s and early 1970s; some of the Coast Guard ships saw service in the Vietnam War, and one survived as a cutter until 1988. A number of the units of the class were transferred to foreign navies, including those of Ethiopia, Italy, Norway, the Philippines, and South Vietnam, for use as patrol vessels and training ships, and a few saw commercial service as cruise ships in Greece. The murky information available on a unit incorporated into the Vietnam People's Navy after the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 suggests that she remained active until at least 2000 and may remain active today; even if reports of her longevity are inaccurate, the last member of this large and long-lived class of ships did not leave service until 1993, when the ship transferred to Italy was decommissioned by the Italian Navy. ==ShipsUSS Barnegat (AVP-10)=== , lead unit of the class, was commissioned in July 1941. She served in the Atlantic until February 1945, then finished World War II in the Pacific.

Leighton Hall is a listed grade I property. It is located on the opposite side of the valley of the river Severn to Powis Castle. The Leighton Hall Estate is particularly notable for the Hall which was decorated and furnished by the Craces to designs by Pugin in his Houses of Parliament style,Aldrich M.(ed), \\"The Craces:Royal Decorators\\", Murray, London, 1990 and for the Home Farm, a model farm, which was to be in the forefront of the Victorian industrialised High Farming. Leighton Hall was also the birthplace of the much disparaged hybrid Cupressocyparis leylandii hedge tree. The Hall is now in private ownership and is not accessible to the public, although it can still be viewed from the road. The Home Farm is currently under restoration. ==HistoryThe Earlier House and Deer Park=== The Estate was in the ownership of the Corbett family until the early years of the and passed by marriage to the Lloyds. A half- timbered house, dating from, was built for Humphrey Lloyd, High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire about 1541. Lloyd was elected the M.P. for Montgomeryshire in 1545 and 1547.A drawing of the house exists in the Vaynor papers in the National Library of Wales The house then passed back to Sir Uvedale Corbett around 1650 and a detailed map of the Leighton Estates in 1663, by William Fowler, exists in the Powis Castle Archives at the National Library of Wales.Silvester R. Mapping Montgomeryshire:Estate Maps from 1589‚Äì1840 Montgomeryshire Collections, Vol 100, 2012, 173, fig 2 The map shows The Inheritance of Sir Richard Corbett and the Manor of Leighton. A deer park is believed to have been established in the north park within this period, the park itself extending west and south to Kingswood village. Sir Richard, Uvedale Corbetts' son, took advantage of the wooded eastern slopes of the park in the early eighteenth century, felling large areas of oak for sale to the Admiralty.The Corbett and Lloyd ownership of Leighton is discussed in detail in (Rev) George Sandford, The Devolutions of the Manor, or Reputed Lordship, of Leighton, Montgomeryshire Collections, Vol13, 333‚Äì354 ===Purchase by the Naylors=== In 1845, the Leighton Hall estate was purchased from the Corbett family of Longnor Hall, Shropshire, by the Liverpool banker, Christopher Leyland. In 1847, he gave it as a wedding present to his nephew John Naylor (1813‚Äì1889), who then proceeded to rebuild the house and estate at a reputed cost of ¬£275,000, plus an additional ¬£200,000 on the farm technology. After John Naylor's death in 1889, his widow continued to live at Leighton until 1909, when parts of the estate were sold. A second sale in 1931, when the house, park, estate buildings and woodlands were sold, saw its final demise as a single entity. ==The Leyland/Naylor Family== The great wealth of the Naylor family was derived from the trading and banking activities of Thomas Leyland (1752‚Äì1827). Christopher Bullin, a Staffordshire Ware merchant, married Thomas Leyland's sister Margaret. Bullin became bankrupt in 1778 and Leyland acquired his premises. Thomas Leyland appears to have had a great regard for his sister's two sons, Richard and Christopher Bullin and her daughter Dorothy. In 1807 Thomas Leyland set up with Richard Bullin, the Leyland and Bullin Bank in Liverpool, which was changed in 1809 to Leyland and Bullins when Christopher Bullin became a partner. In 1809 Dorothy married John Naylor of Hartford Hill, Cheshire. Hartford Hill was then in Great Budworth Parish, but became part of Hartford parish, and Hartford Hill became known as Hartford Grange and is presently the Grange School. John Naylor and Dorothy had four children, Elizabeth, Thomas, John and Richard Christopher. On his death in 1827 Thomas Leyland instructed that his property should go to the lawful male heirs of his nephews Richard and Christopher Bullin, and, failing that, to the male heirs of his niece Dorothy, namely Thomas, John and Richard Christopher Naylor. After the death of Christopher Bullin in 1849, Thomas, John and Richard Christopher Naylor became partners in the Bank, after being sent to Eton and Cambridge. Thomas Naylor inherited name of Leyland and the wealth that went with it. Richard Christopher Naylor purchased Hooton Hall in 1849, which he extensively re-built and also established an important horse racing stud. He was very involved in the banking side of Leyland and Bullins Bank, and built the Albany in Liverpool. In 1843, he also acquired Nantclwyd Hall in Denbighshire, which has become the main family seat. Richard's branch of the family now also own Milton Hall in Cambridgeshire. JP of Leighton Hall c.1870. ===John Naylor (1813‚Äì1889)=== John Naylor was born to John Naylor and Dorothy Bullin on 15 April 1813 in Mount Pleasant, Liverpool. He was three years old when his father died and the family went to live with Dorothy's brother Richard Bullin in Liverpool. John was educated at Eton College around 1826‚Äì32 and then spent three years at Trinity College, Cambridge. On 20 August 1846, John Naylor married Georgiana Edwards, the daughter of John Edwards of Ness Strange, Shropshire. Georgiana was descended from the Duke of Athol. John and Georgiana had ten children: Dora b.1847, Margaret b.1848, Christopher John b.1849, Rowland b.1851, Emily b.1853, Georgina b.1854, John [Jack] b.1856, Frances b.1857, Eva b.1859 & Maud b.1863. Following their marriage, John and Georgiana went to live at Liscard Manor, Wallasey. It seems that John was also developing his farming interests at Hartford Hill. In 1844, John became a partner of Leyland Bullins Bank on the death of his uncle Richard Leyland (Bullin) From Richard Leyland, John inherited the Brynllywarch Estate in Kerry in Montgomeryshire. In 1845, John's uncle Christopher Leyland (Bullin) purchased the Leighton Estate for ¬£85,503 12s 7p, which he gave to John and Georgiana as a wedding present. On 13 July 1889, John Naylor died at the age of seventy-six. ===Christopher John Naylor/Leyland (1849‚Äì1926)=== Christopher John Naylor a naval officer and silviculturist, was born at Liscard, Wallasey, Cheshire, on 19 September 1849, the eldest of three sons and the seven daughters of John Naylor and Georgiana. He grew up at Leighton. Naylor inherited a love of the sea and sailing from his father (a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron and owner of the schooner Sabrina). He entered the Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, at the age of thirteen. He sailed as a midshipman on the Victoria, a three-decker, fitted with steam engines, which was the flagship of the commander-in-chief, Mediterranean. He saw brief service in the Pacific before joining the frigate Liverpool. Finally he went to the China Seas in temporary command of a gunboat. He left the Navy as a sub-lieutenant in 1872. In 1874 he married Everhilda Elizabeth Creyke (1851‚Äì1890), of Rawcliffe Hall, in Yorkshire, and they lived at Trelystan, close to Leighton Hall. His daughter, Hilda Georgina Leyland, married Richard Vernon Cholmondeley. He was a partner at Leyland and Bullins bank from 1879 until 1901. In 1889 Christopher John Naylor inherited the Leighton and Brynllywarch estates from his father, which he made over to his brothers and their heirs in 1891, on the death of his uncle Thomas Leyland. He also inherited the Haggerston Castle estate and changed his name from Naylor to Leyland in 1893. He moved to Haggerston and set out to create an estate with buildings that would more than rival those at Leighton. As a result of Christopher John inheriting Haggerston, John (known as Jack Naylor) became the owner of Leighton Hall and his brother Rowland Naylor the owner of the Brynllyarch Estate in Kerry, Powys. Nantclwyd Hall was now given to Thomas Leyland, son of Thomas Leyland, who had been disinherited. Haggerston, Leighton and Brynllywarch, were kept within the Leyland entailed estates, but Nantclwyd appears to have been outside the Entailed Estates. John (Jack) Naylor died in 1906 and his son John (Murray) Naylor inherited Leighton Hall. ===Disposal and later ownership=== By 1930, the Leyland entailed estates were experiencing considerable financial difficulties and the Leighton Estate, and Haggerston were all put up for auction while Brynllywarch had been sold in 1920. At Leighton, the North West Park was broken up into large and small parcels of land and with their associated dwellings auctioned off in separate lots to private buyers. The Home Farm and associated lands were sold to the Montgomeryshire County Council, who had already purchased the Brynllywarch Estate. A separate auction sale of the furnishings and furniture of the Hall was held by Harrods. The Hall and Gardens were purchased back by the daughter of John Naylor, Georgina, who continued to live at the Hall until her death in 1950. Leighton Hall was then sold to the Canadian Senator and newspaper owner Senator Rupert Davies, who owned Leighton Hall until his death in 1967. It was subsequently used as a school and an arts foundation and was sold again in 1996. ==Leighton Hall== The Hall was rebuilt on the site of the former house in a Gothic style between 1850 and 1856.\\"Scourfield and Haslam \\", 2013, 131‚Äì2. The work was supervised by Liverpool architect W H Gee, possibly to the designs of James Kellaway Colling, who worked extensively for the Naylor family.Attention is drawn to Colling's designs for Askwicke Hall, Marshfield, which was built at the same time and has similar detailing and octagonal tower The house consists of a main range with a clock tower in front, which provides an entrance porch. A short library wing is to the south and a longer north wing. Behind the main range, parallel to the north wing, is an L-plan service wing incorporating the main stairway. This forms two sides of a courtyard at the rear. The hall is full-height, the wings are 2-storey with attics. To the east is the tall six storey octagonal tower with a projecting circular staircase, built in 1854-5, which dominates the house.For an aerial view and description see:Musson C, 2011, \\"Montgomeryshire Past and Present from the Air\\", The Powysland Club, 106, Col. Plate The house is built of brick, but the main elevations are faced in coursed, rock-faced stone ashlar dressings from Cefn near Minera. The stone chimney stacks have tall patterned chimneys. These were probably made by John Marriott Blashfield of Stamford, Lincolnshire, who supplied terracotta for the Naylors at Garthmyl Hall, Berriew. The interior designs were by Augustus Pugin in Pugin's Houses of Parliament style.Pugin's interior designs for Leighton Hall are in the Victoria and Albert Museum with the Craces arranging the interior furnishings and decoration.Aldrich M. and Shifman B., 2005, \\"Crace, Pugin, and the Furnishing of John Naylor's Leighton Hall\\", Furniture History, Vol. 41. There are Minton floor tiles and stained glass probably by Forrest and Bromley who made the glass for Leighton church. The great hall was designed to display Naylor's collection of paintings and sculpture, which included works by Turner, Landseer, Delaroche and Ansdell. The Great hall has a hammerbeam roof with a frieze of Welsh family coats of arms and a fireplace by Pugin. The Great Hall also contained sculptures by Siddon and McBride which are now in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. ==Gardens== Naylor commissioned Edward Kemp, a pupil of Sir Joseph Paxton, to lay out the gardens from 1850 onwards. The gardens, now largely derelict, are of many kinds, from woodland to formal, arranged as a number of set-pieces with pools and stone sculptures linked by broad paths. A dry bridge leads from the library garden and the tower across a hollow to the main walk and over another bridge (carvings of creatures including an elephant). Below is a figure of Icarus falling headlong through the surface of a pond. The revised Powys Pevsner lists the statue as being in situ, following the original edition. It was in fact removed in the 1990s when the then owners of Leighton sought to sell it. Stored by Powys Council for 25 years, it is now due to be returned to the gardens. A Grade II listed structure, it was sculpted by Hippolyte Ferrat. At the end is a view to the spire of Leighton church, and another bridge leads back to the house. The High Bridge (1858), a lofty viaduct taking a high road above the valley has been demolished.\\"Scourfield and Haslam, 2013, 132 In 1874 Kemp laid out a decorative water cascade fed from a series of lakes, which sequenced down from the Moel y Mab on Long Mountain. He then developed the estate's Park Wood, making use‚Äîlike many Victorians of the time‚Äîof exotic species including monkey puzzle trees. The 1857 Charles Ackers Memorial Redwood grove ‚Äì the largest and oldest grove of coast redwoods in Europe ‚Äì and the historic Naylor pinetum are today listed Grade 1 locations, now managed by the Royal Forestry Society. ===Cupressocyparis leylandii=== Cupressocyparis leylandii 'Naylor's Blue' OB Wroc≈Çaw Kemp in his garden layout had placed two disparate Pacific coast North American species of conifers in close proximity to each other: Monterey Cypress, Cupressus macrocarpa (syn. Callitropsis macrocarpa) from California and Nootka Cypress or Alaskan Cypress Cupressus nootkatensis (syn. Callitropsis nootkatensis), family Cupressaceae The two parent species would never have met in the wild as their natural ranges are thousands of miles apart, but in 1888 the hybrid cross occurred when the female cones of Nootka Cypress were fertilised by pollen from Monterey Cypress, to create the first Cupressocyparis leylandii. Christopher John Naylor (1849‚Äì1926) inherited Leighton Hall from his father in 1889. Then, in 1891, Christopher John inherited Haggerston Castle from his uncle Thomas Leyland (n√©e Naylor), and he changed his surname to Leyland, and moved to Haggerston Castle in Northumberland. He further developed the hybrid at Haggeston, and named the first clone variant Haggerston Grey. Leighton Hall then passed to his younger brother John Naylor (1856‚Äì1906), and when, in 1911, the reverse hybrid of the cones of the Monterey Cypress were fertilised with pollen from the Nootka, that hybrid was baptised Leighton Green. ==Home Farm: Model Farm Buildings== Leighton Home Farm from the air. The Leighton Model Farm or Home Farm near Welshpool in Montgomeryshire was a pioneering Victorian farm built on an industrial scale. It was built between 1847 and the early 1860s for John Naylor of Leighton Hall to designs by the estate architects Poundley and Walker.Scourfield R and Haslam R, Buildings of Wales: Powys; Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire and Breconshire, 2nd edition, Yale University Press 2013, 133‚Äì134 It consists of a rectangular complex of red brick buildings, which includes 12 listed buildings, of which 10 are Grade II* listed buildings and two are Grade II. The farm was a gradual development structured either side of a central E-W axis in which a threshing barn was built with hay and fodder storage buildings either side of it, all of which were linked by a broad gauge railway. On the N and S sides of this axis stockyards were built, served by 2 N-S service roads.Naylor spent ¬£200,000 between 1848 and 1856 on developing the 4000-acre (1.620ha) farm on industrial principles. John Naylor's grandson, Captain J.M. Naylor, sold the estate in 1931, when the Leighton Farm was bought by Montgomeryshire County Council and subsequently split up into small industrial units and smallholdings. In 2010 the Potter Group of Welshpool purchased the historic Leighton Home Farm Complex. The formal transfer of the Victorian model farm, with seven houses and 200 acres of land, was completed between Powys County Council and James Potter, the Managing Director of Potter Group. This has paved the way for a comprehensive restoration programme of the Grade II* listed buildings which is currently proceeding, and has been grant aided by Cadw. James Potter's long term proposal is to create an equine centre at Leighton, building on his current National Hunt interests, and presents possibilities for future regeneration in the Welshpool area. In August 2013 Yorton Farm, a stud farm in Shropshire, announced it is relocating its entire operation, including its four stallions, to Leighton Farm Buildings. Owners David and Teresa Futter have integrated stables and stud facilities into the existing Home Farm buildings. ===Comparative Model and Industrial Farms=== The Model Farms of the Georgian period were designed by architects, in contrast to local vernacular layouts, and were normally in close proximity to major country houses. They were arranged around a square or rectangular farmyard, and the buildings were of Classical design.Robinson J M Georgian Model Farms: A Study of Decorative and Model Farm Buildings in the Age of Improvement 1700‚Äì1846. Oxford 1983. A change occurred in the later 1840s and particularly after the passing of the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 which ushered in the period of Victorian High Farming, which lasted until about 1870.Wade-Martins S Farms and Fields Batsford: Know The Landscape:, London 1995,101‚Äì112. This led to Model Farms changing to larger industrial farms, which were plainer and more utilitarian in their design, and normally designed by the estate's Land Agent or surveyor.S. Macdonald Model Farms in Mingay G E (Ed). The Victorian Countryside, 2nd imp. Routledge, 2000 A leading figure in this period was G. A. Dean, a land surveyor who extended the Model Farm for Coke of Norfolk at Holkham (1852‚Äì53) and designed the Home Farm in Windsor Great Park for Prince Albert. Dean wrote two books: Essays on the construction of farm buildings and labourers' cottages (1849) and The Land Steward (1851). These outlined the principles of the new model industrial farms. Dean advocated a rectangular layout and the use of tramways for moving feedstuffs for cattle, and recommended that the yards for the animals be open towards the south to let the sunlight in and give the greatest protection from the wind.G A Dean 1851, The Land Steward pp 173‚Äì201 Elsewhere in Wales the change came around 1850 when the Duke of Beaufort's Farm at Wolvesnewton in Monmouthshire was laid out in a cruciform shape and used a railway track to run through the haybarnsWade- Martin S 1995, pg92 to move the feedstuffs. This design was also copied at Ysgubor Coed-oer-le, Bwlch-y-Cibau, near Meifod in Montgomeryshire.‚Äò‚ÄòWilian‚Äô‚Äô, 1986, 99, fig. 80, which also provides a plan of Wolvesnewton Layout of a steading in Poundleys Cottage Architecture 1857 John Wilkes Poundley, who was John Naylor's estate surveyor at both Leighton and Brynllywarch in Kerry, appears to have anticipated some of Dean's ideas. The use of the cruciform arrangement of the buildings, so the mechanized water-driven power shaft drive could be made available to all the buildings, was in advance of Dean. The circular Pig and Sheep Rotunda were also highly innovative. The Leighton buildings can be compared with the smaller farm steading illustrated in Poundley's Cottage Architecture of 1857, which fairly closely resembles a smaller farm at Upper Pengelli on Naylor's Kerry estate. Leighton Home Farm is also imitated by Home Farm, Courtleaze, Coleshill, Oxfordshire, which was designed and laid out between 1852 and 1854 by E. Moore, Land Agent to the 2nd Earl Radnor. ==Buildings in the Home Farm ComplexWilian, 1986, fig 134, provides a plan of the Home farm layout Piggery and Sheep Shed or Rotunda === These are the two most remarkable buildings in the Home Farm complex and are listed Grade II*. They are at the north-west side of the farm and were built around 1855.Ironbridge Institute, Leighton Park Estate: Report of Student Survey, 1988, pp 19‚Äì21 The buildings consist of 2 circular sheds both of which are open in the centre; the W shed was a sheep house, the E shed was a piggery. These are joined by a long link range which housed sheep on the N side, facing the fields, and probably cattle on the S side facing the 2 stockyards.\\"Wilian\\" pg 178, fig 134 for plan The sheep house and piggery has louvres in the vent ridges of the roof. Its inner wall has drains at the internal floor level above a deep sump in which there are 8 radiating tunnels with round-headed openings. The slurry from the animals would drain in to the circular sumps, before being piped away for use as manure to fertilise the estate fields. The timber framing used to construct the very complex structure of the ridge of the circular buildings is remarkable. The roofs drain water both outwards and inwards, into the circular sump. It has been suggested that these circular buildings were developed from similar farm building on model farms in the U.S.A., but Wilian illustrates another circular cowhouse at Cae‚Äôr lan, Abercraf, Breconshire. This lacks the central sump, but is of the same date\\"Wilian\\" 97, fig. 79 { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"4\\" style=\\"margin:auto; border:2px solid #9d9d9d; background:#eee;\\" -  File:Leighton Model Industrial Farm 33.JPGLeighton Home Farm- sheep rotunda File:Leighton Model Industrial Farm 26.jpgLeighton Farm - interior of Piggery File:Leighton Model Industrial Farm 25.JPGPiggery, Timber framing and roof ventilators File:Leighton Model Industrial Farm 18.JPGExterior of Piggery } ===Feedstuffs Mill=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"4\\" style=\\"margin:auto; border:2px solid #9d9d9d; background:#eee;\\" -  File:Leighton Model Industrial Farm 23.JPGLeighton Home Farm, Feedstuffs Mill from E File:Leighton Model Industrial Farm 29.JPGLeighton Home Farm .

Originally the ground floor was as a 3-bay shed for parking traction and ploughing engines which could also be used to power ancillary machinery at the Leighton Home Farm, while the basement incorporated a smithy, a maintenance shop and a storage area. The building has stone rustication, typical of the style used on later buildings by the architects, Poundley and Walker. Converted to 2 dwellings by Herbert Carr, Montgomeryshire County Architect, in 1931 when Montgomeryshire County Council purchased Leighton Farm. ==Estate Buildings== See also Nantcribba for other estate buildings. The Model Farm is part of a much larger group of industrialised Estate building associated with Leighton Hall these include a smaller model farm at Glanhafren on the Welshpool side of the River Severn, the Cilcewydd Corn mill, a Gas Works with Retort House, Brickyard and Brickworks, a Poultry House, funicular railway, and a massive manure slurry tank on the Moel y Mab hill, which was used to distribute slurry through a system of copper pipes for fertilising the fields. In all there are 75 listed buildings or structures within the area of the Leighton Estate. ===The Park Gate and Lodges=== Leighton Hall Lodge It is likely that W H Gee was the architect for the Park gate and lodges.\\"Scourfield and Haslam, 2013, 132\\" The Hall is approached from the north-west through a three arched Gothic stone gateway set back from the road. The North or Front lodge stands on the right of the drive inside the gate arch. To its south is a second lodge, Back Lodge, which is a small two-storey house in similar but plainer style to Front Lodge. A third entrance lies south of the house, with a lodge, Pine Lodge, to its west. The drive from here runs northwards to the former stables. On the east side of the estate, an entrance side gate connects to Church Lodge. This is a single-storey stone buildings with an attic storey and slate roof. It is executed in the Tudorbethan/Gothic style. A small porch stands on the west side of the house and the roof is ornamented with central, twin stone stacks, an ornamental iron ridge and finials on the gables and probably dates from about 1851‚Äì52. ===Poultry or Fowl House and the Poultry Cottage.=== The Poultry House and the Poultry Cottage are to the east of Leighton Hall and are typical examples of Poundley and Walker's Cottage Ornee and Tudoresque styles. The Poultry House was built in 1861 by John Naylor for his daughter Georgina, to house an extensive collection of many species of ornamental fowl. It is timber framed, and has yellow brick nogging and a most elaborate ornamental bargeboard on the central gable. The adjacent house was the Poultry Keeper's cottage. Over the windows are Tudor style dripmolds with replacement bargeboards to the dormers.Scourfield and Haslam 2013, 133. The ornamental terracotta chimney stacks were probably supplied by John Marriott Blashfield of Stamford. Both the Poultry House, which retains all its original fittings, and the Poultry Cottage, now used for holiday accommodation, were restored by the Landmark Trust in 1998-9. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"4\\" style=\\"margin:auto; border:2px solid #9d9d9d; background:#eee;\\" -  File:Leighton Poultry House - geograph.org.uk - 924657.jpgPoultry or Fowl House at Leighton Hall File:Poultry or Fowl House and the Poultry Cottage 02.JPGPoultry or Fowl House at Leighton Hall File:Poultry or Fowl House and the Poultry Cottage 04.JPGPoultry or Fowl House at Leighton Hall.

Part of the Leighton Model Farm. Leighton Hall Top Engine House or Summerhouse Leighton Hall, Cable House In the valley of the Severn the river was diverted to drive a water-ram which pumped water to a huge stone faced tank on Moel-y-Mab, a spur of the Long Mountain. Feedstuffs were brought up to the adjacent Cowsheds by a funicular railway, where liquid manure was stored in the tank. The slurry was then distributed round the farm's fields in copper pipes. An Upper and Lower Cable House were built. The lower one is of brick, the upper of Cefn stone from Minera. Its upper stage is of decorative timber-framing with a steeply-hipped roof.Scourfield and Haslam, 2013, 133 The last functioned as a summer-house. The Lower Cable house also housed a water turbine. The Lower Cable house is brick on stone foundations. It has stone rustication quoining, which is typical of Poundley's architectural style. The railway was built in the 1850s. ===Estate Housing=== Hollybush Cottage Park House and the Lower Cable House There is a wide range of estate housing on the Leighton Hall estate, which reflects the various levels of those employed on the estate. The estate manager's house was probable the ‚Äò‚ÄòWhite House‚Äô‚Äô on the main road near Severnleigh, while some of the more important houses were in a Tudor style and constructed in stone with elaborate terracotta chimney pots. The labourers on the farm had simple double cottages, such as the brick cottages near Moel y Mab. Often much older timber framed buildings were refaced in brick and given a Cottage Orn√©e appearance, often by adding decorative bargeboards to the dormer windows. Hollybush Cottage is an example of this. Poundley also used this Cottage Orn√©e style on houses on the Naylor's Brynllywarch estate, as at Cilthriew. Poundley designed many houses using red brick, which would have come from the estate brickyard and typically, as at Park House, he used rusticated stone quoining. His partner, David Walker in contrast, favoured whitish or yellowish brick with ornamental gables, as on a double villa type house near the Mill at Cilcewydd, which can be attributed to him.\\"Scourfield and Haslam\\" 2013, 134 ===Severnleigh=Cilcewydd Corn Mill=== The main flour mill for the Naylor Estates. On the East bank of the river Severn and below a causeway which crosses the railway line and then bridges the river. The mill was built in two phases, the main block in 1862 (date on hopper head), the 2nd in 1868, in an identical style.Leighton Park Estate; Report of Student Survey 1986. Ironbridge Institute Research paper No. 1 20 April 1987, pp11-21 The mill is built of brick with stone rustication on the corners. Rustication of this type was widely used on later buildings by Poundley and Walker on the Leighton estate and is also used as a decorative feature on the Naylor's estate buildings at Brynllywarch in Powys. The mill had closed by the time of the sale of the Leighton Estate in 1931 and later became a Youth Hostel and then a creamery. It now functions as a vehicle bodywork repair shop, and for vehicle maintenance. The wide head race which drove the Macadam water turbines, manufactured in Belfast, at the N end, is now largely dry.Barton, P G, 1999, 'A history and conspectus of Montgomeryshire water corn mills', Montgomeryshire Collections 87, No 90, 75. ===Glanhafren Estate.=== Glanhafren. The 18th century house and the Great barn following the fire in 2005/6 Originally owned by the Griffiths family, but had been sold to the Pryce-Jones family by 1745, when it formed part of a small estate. It was purchased by John Naylor in 1854. The house is between the railway line and the river Severn to the S of Welshpool, approached via a track which leaves the A490 Montgomery Road immediately W of Cilcewydd. The house dates from the early 18th century and is Grade II* on account of important interior panelled rooms. There is an illustration of the house in 1794, by John Ingleby, commissioned by Thomas Pennant, which is now in the National Library of Wales. The house was extensively rebuilt and a complex of farm buildings were added for John Naylor by the estate architects Poundley and Walker. The great barn, which was typical of Poundley's work, was burnt down on 26 December 2005. ==See also== *Powis Castle ‚Äì a grade 1 National Trust property located on the opposite side of the valley *Haggerston Castle.

Over the course of his career BƒÖk was involved in 6 promotion winning seasons while playing for; Lechia Gda≈Ñsk (5) and Wis≈Ça P≈Çock (1). ==FootballLechia Gda≈Ñsk=== A trainee of Jantar Pruszcz Gda≈Ñski and Lechia Gda≈Ñsk, BƒÖk joined the Lechia first team in 2001. In 1998 Lechia Gda≈Ñsk formed a merger with Polonia Gda≈Ñsk to create Lechia-Polonia Gda≈Ñsk. After 3 unsuccessful years Lechia wished to play football again independently which resulted in them having to re-start in the regional divisions of the sixth tier. For an 18 year old BƒÖk this offered him the chance for consistent playing time with the football team he grew up supporting. In his first season BƒÖk played 22 times for Lechia, including scoring the final goal in the 15-0 win over LKS Waplewo from the penalty spot in stoppage time. In his first four seasons Lechia achieved four promotions winning each of the leagues along the way. By this point Lechia had reached the II liga, the second tier in Polish football at the time. After finishes of 10th and 5th the following two seasons, Lechia achieved promotion by winning the league in 2008. In his first season in the Ekstraklasa BƒÖk played a total of 12 league games, making 7 appearances in the first half of the following season as the second choice goalkeeper. To supporters BƒÖk become the symbol of a \\"new\\" Lechia Gda≈Ñsk due to him being the only player to stay with the team from the sixth tier right up to the Ekstraklasa, the first tier. ===Portugal, Poland and Bulgaria=== After losing his place in the first team BƒÖk moved to Portuguese side Mar√≠timo on loan for the second half of the season, with the view of it becoming a permanent deal. After failing to make any appearances during the loan spell Mar√≠timo decided against the permanent transfer. He returned to Lechia where he briefly played for the second team, Lechia Gda≈Ñsk II. BƒÖk moved to Wis≈Ça P≈Çock over the winter transfer window, and made 5 appearances for Wis≈Ça in 2011 helping the team to win promotion from the II liga. In July 2011 he joined Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Bia≈Ça on a two-year contract moving back to the Ekstraklasa.Mateusz BƒÖk pi≈Çkarzem Podbeskidzia 6.07.2011, 90minut.pl This was Podbeskidzie's first ever season in the Ekstraklasa, with BƒÖk making 12 appearances to help the team avoid relegation. The following season he only made 3 appearances in the opening half of the season, and joined Bulgarian top division club Etar 1924 in early 2013. For Etar he only made 3 appearances, of which included a 6-1 defeat and another game including a sending off for himself.Mateusz BƒÖk player profile and match log 20.04.2013, soccerway.com His time at Etar was part of a tumultuous time for the club, including 20 players signed during the January transfer window (BƒÖk included), death threats to players from the club's president, the club taking 80% of players wages, the club no longer paying for hotels for players to stay in, including food, and the club providing no training sessions after the club's head coach left. While BƒÖk and three other Polish players were only on 4 month contracts, the Polish Football Association helped them to get out of their contracts early due to the terrible conditions provided by the club. ===Return to Lechia Gda≈Ñsk=== After the unsuccessful spell in Bulgaria BƒÖk left Etar only 6 months after joining returning to Poland to play with Lechia in July 2013. His return to Lechia saw him once again playing regular football, something he hadn't experienced since his first spell at the club. In the first two seasons of his return made 27 and 21 times for Lechia in the league. With younger goalkeepers being transferred to the team BƒÖk found himself playing a bigger role in the development of these other goalkeepers. For the 2015-16 season BƒÖk was totally kept out of the first team, instead having to settle for Lechia Gda≈Ñsk II team, playing 20 times for the second team that season. With opportunities in the first team now limited for BƒÖk he announced his plans for retirement in 2016 aged 33. In the last home game of the season against Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin, Lechia celebrated the careers of Piotr Wi≈õniewski and Mateusz BƒÖk. Both players had played over 10 years for Lechia, while Lechia was the only professional club Wi≈õniewski played for. Both players came on as substitutes in the 4‚Äì0 win over Pogon, with Wi≈õniewski scoring the final goal of the game, while BƒÖk made an important save to keep a clean sheet for the team. After his retirement it was announced that BƒÖk would be staying with Lechia Gda≈Ñsk being given the role as a goalkeeping coach for the academy, before becoming Lechia Gda≈Ñsk II's goalkeeping coach at the start of the 2018-19 season. ==HonoursLechia Gda≈Ñsk=== *II liga (second tier) **Winners (1): 2007-08 *III liga (group II) (third tier) **Winners (1): 2004-05 *IV liga (pomeranian group) (fourth tier) **Winners (1): 2003-04 *Liga okrƒôgowa (group Gda≈Ñsk II) (fifth tier) **Winners (1): 2002-03 *Klasa A (group Gda≈Ñsk IV) (sixth tier) **Winners (1): 2001-02 ===Wis≈Ça P≈Çock=== *II liga (eastern group) (third tier) **Runners-up (1): 2010-11 ==Career statisticsClub=== { class= style=text-align:center + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2National Cup !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=10Lechia Gda≈Ñsk 2001-02 Klasa A (Gda≈Ñsk IV) 22180301 - 2002-03 Liga okrƒôgowa (Gda≈Ñsk II) 29050340 - 2003-04 IV Liga Pomorania 23040270 - 2004-05 III liga (group II) 12010130 - 2005-06 II liga 330colspan=2‚Äì330 - 2006-07 II liga 25010260 - 2007-08 II liga 80colspan=2‚Äì80 - 2008-09 Ekstraklasa 12020140 - 2009-10 Ekstraklasa 70colspan=2‚Äì70 - !colspan=2Total !17112101921 - rowspan=2Mar√≠timo 2009-10 Primeira Liga colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì - !colspan=2Total !colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì - rowspan=2Wis≈Ça P≈Çock 2010-11 II liga (Eastern group) 50colspan=2‚Äì50 - !colspan=2Total !50colspan=2‚Äì50 - rowspan=3Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Bia≈Ça 2011-12 Ekstraklasa 12010130 - 2012-13 Ekstraklasa 30colspan=2‚Äì30 - !colspan=2Total !15010160 - rowspan=2Etar Veliko Tarnovo 2012-13 A Group 30colspan=2‚Äì30 - !colspan=2Total !30colspan=2‚Äì30 - rowspan=6Lechia Gda≈Ñsk 2013-14 Ekstraklasa 27030300 - 2014-15 Ekstraklasa 21010220 - 2015-16 Ekstraklasa colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì - 2016-17 Ekstraklasa 10colspan=2‚Äì10 - !colspan=2Total !49040530 - !colspan=2Lechia Gda≈Ñsk Total !22012502451 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career Total !243!!1!!26!!0!!269!!1 } ==ReferencesLechia Gdansk Player Profile Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pruszcz Gda≈Ñski Category:Polish footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Lechia Gda≈Ñsk players Category:C.S.

The unfinished monument is attributed to Trajan, Roman emperor from 98 to 117 AD, due to his depiction as pharaoh seen on some of the interior reliefs. However, the majority of the structure dates to an earlier time, possibly to the reign of Augustus. The temple was originally built on the island of Philae, near the lower Aswan Dam, and served as main entrance to the Philae Island Temple Complex from the Nile river. It was relocated to Agilika Island in the 1960s by UNESCO to save it from the rising waters of the Nile that followed the construction of the Aswan High Dam. This 15-x-20 metre kiosk is 15.85 metres high; its function was likely \\"to shelter the bark of Isis at the eastern banks\\" of Philae island. Its four by five columns each carry \\"different, lavishly structured composite capitals that are topped by 2.10-metre-high piers\\" and were originally \\"intended to be sculpted into Bes piers, similar to the birthhouses of Philae, Armant, and Dendera though this decoration was never completed. The structure is today roofless, but sockets within the structure's architraves suggest that its roof, which was made of timber, was indeed constructed in ancient times. Three 12.50-metre-long, presumably triangulated trusses, \\"which were inserted into a ledge at the back of stone architecture, carried the slightly vaulted roof.\\" All the fourteen columns are connected by a screening wall, with entrances in the eastern and western facades. This building represents an example of the unusual combination of wood and stone in the same architectural structure for an Egyptian temple. The attribution to Emperor Trajan is based on a carving inside the kiosk structure, depicting the emperor burning incense before Osiris and Isis. ==Gallery== File:David Roberts Hypaethral Temple Philae.jpgThe Hypaethral Temple of Philae by David Roberts, 1838, in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia File:Kiosk of Trajan 1839.jpgKiosk in December, 1839, Pierre-Gustave Joly de Lotbini√®re File:John Beasly Greene (American, born France - The Kiosk of Trajan, Philae - Google Art Project.jpgKiosk in 1854 by John Beasley Greene File:Hypaethral Temple Philae.jpgThe Hypaethral Temple, Philae, by Francis Frith, 1857; from the collection of the National Galleries of Scotland ==References External links == Category:Philae Kiosk ","title":"Trajan's Kiosk"},{"id":"20459607","text":"Kiambu West District was a former district of Kenya.

Kasab, alongside fellow Lashkar-e-Taiba recruit Ismail Khan, killed 72 people during the attacks, most of them at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Kasab was the only attacker captured alive by police. Kasab was born in Faridkot, Pakistan and left his home in 2005, engaging in petty crime and armed robbery with a friend. In late 2007, he and his friend encountered members of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah, the political wing of Lashkar-e-Taiba, distributing pamphlets, and were persuaded to join. On 3 May 2010, Kasab was found guilty of 80 offences, including murder, waging war against India, possessing explosives, and other charges. On 6 May 2010, the same trial court sentenced him to death on four counts and to a life sentence on five counts. Kasab's death sentence was upheld by the Bombay High Court on 21 February 2011. The verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court of India on 29 August 2012. Kasab was hanged on 21 November 2012 at 7:30 am, and buried at Yerwada Jail in Pune. ==Early life== Kasab was born in Faridkot village in the Okara District of Punjab, Pakistan, to Amir Shahban Kasab and Noor Illahi. His father ran a snack cart while his elder brother, Afzal, worked as a labourer in Lahore. His elder sister, Rukaiyya Husain, was married and lived in the village. A younger sister, Suraiyya, and brother, Munir, lived in Faridkot with their parents. The family belongs to the Qassab community. Kasab briefly joined his brother in Lahore and then returned to Faridkot. He left home after a fight with his father in 2005. He had asked for new clothes on Eid, but his father could not provide them, which made him angry. He engaged in petty crime with his friend Muzaffar Lal Khan, moving on to armed robbery. On 21 December 2007, Eid al-Adha, they were in Rawalpindi trying to buy weapons when they encountered members of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah, the political wing of Lashkar-e- Taiba, distributing pamphlets. They decided to sign up for training with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, ending up at their base camp, Markaz Taiba. An interrogator and deputy commissioner of the Mumbai Police stated that Kasab spoke rough Hindi and almost no English. He said his father in effect sold him to Lashkar- e-Taiba so that he could use the money they gave him to support the family. His father denied it. Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a senior commander of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, reportedly offered to pay his family Rs.150,000 for his participation in the attacks. Another report said the 23-year-old was recruited from his home, in part, based on a pledge by recruiters to pay Rs.100,000 to his family if he became a martyr. Other sources put the reward at US$4,000. Villagers of Okara claimed on camera that he was at their village six months before the Mumbai attack. They said that he asked his mother to bless him as he was going for jihad, and claimed that he demonstrated his wrestling skills to a few village boys that day. ==Training== Ajmal Kasab was among a group of 24 men who received training in marine warfare at a remote camp in mountainous Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir in Pakistan. Part of the training was reported to have taken place on the Mangla Dam reservoir. ==Involvement in 2008 Mumbai attacks== Kasab was seen on CCTV during his attacks at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus along with another recruit, Ismail Khan. Kasab reportedly told the police that they wanted to replicate the Islamabad Marriott hotel attack, and reduce the Taj Hotel to rubble, replicating the 9/11 attacks in India. Kasab and his accomplice Khan, then aged 25, attacked the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus) railway station. They then moved on to attack a police vehicle (a white Toyota Qualis) at Cama Hospital, in which senior Mumbai police officers (Maharashtra ATS Chief Hemant Karkare, encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar and Additional Commissioner of Mumbai Police Ashok Kamte) were travelling. After killing them in a gun battle and taking two constables hostage in the Qualis, Kasab and Khan drove towards the Metro cinema. Kasab joked about the bulletproof vests worn by the police and killed one constable when his mobile phone rang. The two fired some shots into a crowd gathered at the Metro Cinema. They then drove to Vidhan Bhavan where they fired more shots. Their vehicle had a tire puncture, so they stole a silver ≈†koda Laura and drove towards Girgaum Chowpatty beach. The D B Marg police had received a message from police control at about , that two heavily armed men had gunned down commuters at CST. 15 policemen from D B Marg were sent to Chowpatty to set up a double barricade on Marine Drive. The ≈†koda reached Chowpatty and halted 40 to 50 feet from the barricade. It reversed and attempted a U-turn. A shootout ensued and Khan was killed. Kasab lay motionless playing dead. Assistant sub- inspector Tukaram Omble, armed only with a lathi, charged the vehicle, being shot five times. Omble held onto Kasab's weapon, enabling Omble's colleagues to capture Kasab alive. Omble died from the bullet wounds. A mob gathered and attacked the two terrorists, which was captured on video. Initially, Kasab pretended to be dead, and was being transported to the Nair Hospital when a police officer discovered Kasab was breathing. Seeing the mutilated body of another slain terrorist, Kasab begged doctors to put him on saline, saying \\"I do not want to die\\". The doctors who treated Kasab said he had no bullet wounds. Kasab told police he was trained to \\"kill to the last breath\\". Later, after interrogation in the hospital by the police, he said: \\"Now, I do not want to live\\", requesting the interrogators kill him for the safety of his family in Pakistan, who could be killed or tortured for his surrender to Indian police. (Fidayeen suicide squad terrorists were instructed not to be captured and interrogated, use aliases instead of their real names, and hide their nationality.) He is also quoted as saying \\"I have done right, I have no regrets\\". Reports also surfaced that the group planned to escape safely after the attack. Kasab told interrogators that all through the operation, the Lashkar headquarters from Karachi, Pakistan, remained in touch with the group, calling their phones through a voice-over-Internet service. Investigators succeeded in reconstructing the group's journey through the Garmin GPS that was found on Kasab. An email sent from a group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen claiming responsibility was traced to a Russian proxy, which was then traced back to Lahore with the help of the FBI. ===Nationality=== Police announced Kasab was a Pakistani national based on his confession and other evidence.Enough evidence, now Pak must act: Pranab Mukherjee Several reporters visited Kasab's village and verified the facts provided by him. Former Pakistan Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif confirmed that Kasab was from Faridkot village in Pakistan, and criticised President Zardari for cordoning off the village and not allowing his parents to meet anyone. Journalist Saeed Shah travelled to Kasab's village and produced national identity card numbers of his parents. His parents left town on the night of 3 December 2008. Mumbai Joint Police Commissioner of Crime Rakesh Maria said Kasab was from the Faridkot village in the Okara district of Pakistan's Punjab province, and was the son of Mohammed Amir Kasab. The Mumbai Police said much of the information that Kasab provided proved to be accurate. He disclosed the location of a fishing trawler, MV Kuber, that the terrorists used to enter Mumbai's coastal waters. He told investigators where his team put the ship captain's body, a satellite phone and a global-positioning device, which the police found. Pakistani officials, including President Asif Ali Zardari, initially denied Ajmal Kasab was Pakistani.Ajmal Kasab is Pakistani, says SharifAfter India, Sharif slams Zardari, says Kasab from Pak Pakistani government officials attempted to erase evidence that there was a Lashkar-e-Taiba office in Deepalpur. The office was hurriedly closed in the week of 7 December. On the night of 3 December 2008, the parents were whisked away by a bearded Mullah, and since then, there was evidence of a cover-up by plainclothes police. Villagers changed their stories, and reporters who visit there were intimidated. In early December, Kasab's father admitted in an interview that Kasab was his son. In January 2009, Pakistan's National Security Advisor Mahmud Ali Durrani admitted to Kasab being a Pakistani citizen while speaking to the CNN-IBN news channel. The Pakistan Government then acknowledged that Ajmal Kasab was a Pakistani, but also announced that Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani had fired Durrani for \\"failing to take Gilani and other stakeholders into confidence\\" before making this information public, and for \\"a lack of coordination on matters of national security.\\" ==Police interrogationNaming confusion=== On 6 December 2008, The Hindu reported that the police officers who interrogated him did not speak his language, Urdu, and misinterpreted his caste origin \\"kasai\\", meaning butcher, to be a surname, writing it as \\"Kasav\\". The Times of India reported a different version of the error. The paper stated that the police officers correctly understood that Ajmal Kasab does not have a surname. To satisfy an administrative requirement that people have surnames, the officers asked Kasab for his father's profession, and decided to use \\"butcher\\", or \\"Kasab\\" in Urdu, as his surname. The Hindu referred to him as either \\"Mohammad Ajmal Amir, son of Mohammad Amir Iman\\" or \\"Mohammad Ajmal Amir 'Kasab'\\". List of various names used to refer to Kasab: * Ajmal Kasab * Azam Amir Kasav * Ajmal Qasab * Ajmal Amir Kamal * Ajmal Amir Kasab * Azam Ameer Qasab * Mohammad Ajmal Qasam * Ajmal Mohammed Amir Kasab * Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasar * Amjad Amir Kamaal * Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab ===Confessions=== Ammunition, a satellite phone and a layout plan of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was recovered from Kasab. He described how his team arrived at Mumbai from Karachi via Porbandar. He said that they had received revolvers, AK-47s, ammunition and dried fruit from their coordinator. Kasab told the police that they wanted to replicate the Marriott hotel attack in Islamabad, and reduce the Taj Hotel to rubble, replicating the 11 September attacks in US. Kasab told police that his team targeted Nariman House, where the Chabad centre was located, because it was frequented by Israelis, who were targeted to \\"avenge atrocities on Palestinians.\\"Terrorist: We were sent to target Israelis, Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA),30 November 2008. Kasab told the police that he and his associate, Ismail Khan, were the ones who shot Anti-Terror Squad chief Hemant Karkare, encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar and Additional Commissioner Ashok Kamte. Kasab entered the Taj posing as a student from Mauritius and stored explosives in one of the hotel's rooms. In December 2009, Kasab retracted his confession in court, claiming he had come to Mumbai to act in Bollywood films and was arrested by the Mumbai police three days before the attacks.Ajab Kasab ki ghazab kahani, Banglore Mirror, 18 December 2009 Confessions on video Kasab repeatedly asked the interrogators to turn the camera off and warned them he would not speak otherwise. Nonetheless the following confessions were recorded on video: When police asked Kasab what he understood about jihad, Kasab told the interrogators \\"it is about killing and getting killed and becoming famous.\\" \\"Come, kill and die after a killing spree. By this one will become famous and will also make God proud.\\" According to an officer, Kasab spoke Pathani Hindi, and told the police that he vomited the moment he saw all the blood and gore. \\"Kasab said that he could not bear the sight of dead bodies and after creating enough havoc wanted to go back to Pakistan,\\" the officer said. \\"We were told that our big brother India is so rich and we are dying of poverty and hunger. My father sells dahi wada in a stall in Lahore and we did not even get enough food to eat from his earnings. I was promised that once they knew that I was successful in my operation, they would give 150,000 rupees (around US$3,352), to my family,\\" said Kasab. Police said they were shocked by his readiness to switch loyalties after he was apprehended. \\"If you give me regular meals and money I will do the same for you that I did for them,\\" he said. \\"When we asked whether he knew any verses from the Quran that described jihad, Kasab said he did not,\\" police said. \\"In fact he did not know much about Islam or its tenets,\\" according to a police source. ===Face to face with Abu Jundal=== On 9 August 2012, Kasab was brought face-to-face with Abu Jundal, the handler of Mumbai attacks, at the Arthur Road jail where they identified each other. Kasab also admitted that Jundal had taught him Hindi. ===Other reports=== In a press conference, the Mumbai city police commissioner said \\"The person we have caught alive is certainly a Pakistani. They were all trained by ex-army officers, some for a year, some for more than a year\\". On 23 November 2008, they set sail from Karachi unarmed to be picked up by a larger vessel. They hijacked the Indian fishing trawler Kuber and set sail for Mumbai. The Times reported on 3 December 2008 that Indian police were going to submit Kasab to a narco analysis test to definitively determine his nationality. According to DNA India, Kasab began reading the autobiography of India's non-violent leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in early March 2009, in response to coaxing by prison guards. ==Legal issues== Several Indian lawyers refused to represent Kasab citing ethical concerns. A resolution was passed unanimously by the Bombay Metropolitan Magistrate Court's Bar Association, which has more than 1,000 members, saying that none of its members would defend any of the accused of the terror attacks.Press Trust of India (6 December 2008) Lawyers refuse to take up arrested terrorist's case Rediff.com.

Towards the end of December 2008, Ujjwal Nikam was appointed as Public Prosecutor for trying Kasab and in January 2009 M.L. Tahaliyani was appointed the judge for the case.Mumbai Attacks: A Chronology of the Trial Outlook India. 20 July 2009. Retrieved 25 November 2012. Indian investigators filed an 11,000-page Chargesheet against Kasab on 25 February 2009. Due to the fact that the chargesheet was written in Marathi and English, Kasab requested an Urdu translation of the charge sheet. He was charged with murder, conspiracy and waging war against India along with other crimes. His trial was originally scheduled to start on 15 April 2009 but was postponed as his lawyer, Anjali Waghmare was dismissed for a conflict of interest. It resumed on 17 April 2009 after Abbas Kazmi was assigned as his new defence counsel. On 20 April 2009, the prosecution submitted a list of charges against him, including the murder of 166 people. On 6 May 2009, Kasab pleaded not guilty to 86 charges. The same month he was identified by eyewitnesses who testified witnessing his actual arrival and him firing at the victims. Later the doctors who treated him also identified him. On 2 June 2009, Kasab told the judge he also understood the Marathi language. In June 2009, the special court issued non-bailable warrants against 22 absconding accused including Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafeez Saeed and chief of operations of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Zaki-ur-Rehman Laqvi. On 20 July 2009, Kasab retracted his non-guilty plea and pleaded guilty to all charges. On 18 December 2009, he retracted his guilty plea and claimed that he was framed and his confession was obtained by torture. Instead he claimed to have come to Mumbai 20 days before the attacks and was simply strolling at Juhu beach when police arrested him. The trial concluded on 31 March 2010 and on 3 May the verdict was pronounced ‚Äì Kasab was found guilty of murder, conspiracy, and of waging war against India (which also carried the death penalty). On 6 May 2010, he was sentenced to death. A Bombay High Court bench, composed of Justice Ranjanaa Desai and Justice Ranjit More, heard Kasab's appeal against the death penalty and upheld the sentence given by the trial court in their verdict on 21 February 2011. On 30 July 2011, Kasab moved to Supreme Court of India, challenging his conviction and sentence in the case. Thus, a bench composed of Justice Aftab Alam and Justice Chandramouli Kr. Prasad stayed the orders of the Bombay High Court so as to follow the due process of law, and started hearing the case. On 29 August 2012, Kasab was again found guilty of waging war and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India. ==Execution== Kasab's plea for clemency was rejected by President Pranab Mukherjee on 5 November 2012. On 7 November, Minister of Home Affairs Sushilkumar Shinde confirmed the President's rejection of the petition. The following day, the Maharashtra state government was formally notified and requested to take action. The date of 21 November was then fixed for the execution, and the Indian government faxed their decision to the Pakistani Foreign Office. Everything so far on secret basis, Kasab was formally informed of his execution on 12 November, after which he requested government officials to inform his mother. On the night of 18‚Äì19 November, a senior prison official at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai read Kasab's death warrant to him, informing him at the same time that his petition for clemency had been rejected. Kasab was then asked to sign his death warrant, which he did. He was secretly transferred under heavy guard to Yerwada Jail in Pune, arriving in the early morning of 19 November. The death and funeral of nationalist politician Bal Thackeray also aided in diverting attention from Kasab. An officer at Arthur Road Jail stated anonymously: \\"Throughout the journey from Mumbai to Pune, he did not cause any trouble. Kasab's attitude was of resignation when he came to know that his mercy petition was rejected by the president. Kasab did not shed a single tear during the last few days.\\" Only the jail superintendent at Yerwada was made aware of Kasab's identity. Kasab was placed in a special cell when he was at Yerwada and no other inmates were informed of his presence. It was only a few minutes before Kasab's execution that the executioner was informed whom he would be hanging. Though reportedly nervous in the final minutes before his execution, Kasab remained quiet and offered prayers. He was hanged on 21 November 2012 at 7:30, according to an announcement by Home Minister Shinde. Kasab's execution by the Maharashtra government happened barely two weeks after President Pranab Mukherjee rejected his mercy petition on 5 November. After the government contemplated burial at sea, the decision was finally made to bury Kasab at Yerwada Jail. Following his execution, Kasab's body was given to a maulvi for burial in accordance with Islamic rites. Ansar Burney, a human rights activist in Pakistan, later offered to help repatriate Kasab's body to Pakistan citing humanitarian reasons. The Indian government stated it would consider a formal application if offered. Shinde later stated that Kasab's body was buried in India because Pakistan had refused to claim it. ===Reaction=== Authorities in Uttar Pradesh banned all celebrations and public gatherings and placed the state on high alert in response. Similarly, the Coimbatore City Police took a group of people in Coimbatore into preventive custody for celebrating Kasab's execution. K. Unnikrishnan, father of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, said though the execution was necessary, it was not something to \\"rejoice over\\" and that the ensuing celebrations were \\"foolishness.\\" In Pakistan, the general and official government response was muted, with the media treating the execution as another news item, according to The Hindu. Though some journalists attempted to elicit statements from villagers in Kasab's village of Faridkot, they met with a hostile response. A senior LeT commander issued an anonymous statement, saying Kasab was a hero who would \\"inspire more fighters to follow his path.\\" The Pakistani Taliban's spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan issued a statement threatening Indians with retaliation and declaring Kasab would be avenged. Ehsan also made demands for Kasab's body to be returned to his family. \\"If they don't return his body to us or his family we will capture Indians and will not return their bodies.\\" While commending on the well appreciated role of two women officers in the smooth handling of the execution, Patil later responded to threats to avenge Kasab's death by stating that anybody daring to attack the soil of Maharashtra would meet the same fate. Hafiz Saeed and thousands of others offered ghayabana namaz-e-janaza (funeral prayers in absentia) for Kasab at a Jamaat-ud-Dawah session in Muridke. Hundreds of others in Srinagar also offered similar prayers at the appeal of Syed Ali Geelani. ===Pakistan Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Proceedings=== Mudassir Lakhvi, headmaster of the Government Elementary School in Faridkot village, Okara, appeared before the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on 9 May 2014, during the trial of seven suspects, (Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Abdul Wajid, Mazhar Iqbal, Hammad Amin Sadiq, Shahid Jameel Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Younus Anjum), accused of involvement in the attacks on 26 November 2008. He claimed that he knew that Ajmal Kasab was alive, and he had met Ajmal only a few days ago. He repeated the claim in 2015. ==See also== * David Headley * Terrorism in India ==CitationsReferences== * . * .

A utility, tall and weighing , Watts had the ability to play in any position on the ground and has played for extended periods of time as a forward, defender, wingman and back-up ruckman. He was a talented sportsman at a young age, playing both basketball and Australian rules football. In basketball, he represented Victoria and Australia, before giving up the sport to focus on football. He was recognised as a gifted footballer at a young age when he represented Victoria at the under-12 level. He went on to represent the state in the 2008 AFL Under 18 Championships as a bottom-aged player where he won the Larke Medal as the best player in the championships and was named as the full-forward in the All-Australian team. Watts' performances in the championships saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 AFL draft at seventeen years of age, a year younger than most of his fellow draftees. The hype surrounding Watts in his first season was profound until he made his debut in the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood in the 2009 season. The management of his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club because he was played despite being unready for senior football. Instead, Watts was used as a promotional tool to create a sense of hope for long-suffering fans. Criticism has followed Watts closely throughout his career due to the expectations that were placed on him being the number one draft pick and many believing he was not living up to his potential. Despite the criticism that has followed Watts, he has maintained a spot in the senior side throughout his career and has played over one hundred matches. Furthermore, he has featured in the top ten of Melbourne's best and fairest count three times, including finishing fifth in the 2016 count. Drafted as a forward and playing the majority of his career in the forward line, he has kicked over one hundred goals, including a career-high season in 2016, in which he kicked thirty-eight goals. Although he has played a majority of his career in the forward line, he has been praised for his versatility which allows him to play in multiple positions on the ground. ==Early life== Watts was born to Janine and Andrew Watts on 26 March 1991 in Victoria, Australia. He proved himself as an adept Australian rules footballer at a young age when he represented Victoria at the under-12 AFL carnival. An equally talented basketball player, he represented both Victoria and Australia as a junior, earning a scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). In 2007, he was rewarded with a second scholarship with the AIS, this time for football, as part of the eleventh intake of the AIS-AFL Academy. He missed playing in the 2007 AFL under-16 championships for Victoria Metro and most of the basketball season after he broke his collarbone twice. Despite attempting to play both basketball and football at an elite level, he ultimately gave up his basketball scholarship with the AIS in mid-2008 to focus on a football career; at the time, he was considered the best point guard for his age in Victoria and potentially the best in the country. At seventeen years of age, Watts entered the 2008 season primarily playing school football with Brighton Grammar in the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS) competition, instead of under-18 level in the TAC Cup with the Sandringham Dragons. He was completing year eleven and could choose to nominate for the AFL draft in either 2008 or 2009; touted as a likely early draft pick despite being a year younger than most of his fellow draft prospects, he spent the majority of the season undecided on whether he would nominate for the 2008 draft. He did, however, state that he would remain in Victoria in 2009 to complete year twelve at Brighton Grammar even if he was recruited by an interstate team. For the first half of the season, Western Australian, Nic Naitanui was considered the likely number-one draft pick; however, after Watts received mid-year state honours representing Victoria Metro at the 2008 AFL Under 18 Championships, he established himself during the championships as one of the \\"best young talents in the country\\". The first round match of the championships against Victoria Country saw him take a pack mark with seconds left in the game and kick the winning goal, his fourth of the match; his resolve led to one recruiter stating \\"If the draft was on tomorrow and I had the first pick, I'd be choosing him ... without hesitation. He's just a natural player, he's an athlete and he's a very strong competitor.\\" He was rewarded with the Larke Medal as the best player in division one of the championships and was named the full-forward in the All- Australian team after he kicked fifteen goals during the championships. Watts announced in October that he would nominate for the 2008 draft, with he, Naitanui and another West Australian, Daniel Rich, touted as the most likely players to be recruited with the first selection in the 2008 AFL draft. He furthered his claim as the potential number one pick when he recorded the second fastest time by a non-Indigenous player in the twenty metre sprint with 2.82 seconds at the AFL draft camp, in addition to placing second in the agility test, fifth in the standing vertical jump and seventh in the repeated sprints. His rise during the year saw The Age journalist, Emma Quayle, describe him as the \\"most complete prospect in [the] draft, he has all the athletic qualities you could want in a key forward‚Äîhe's quick, agile, he's a good kick and he can mark\\". In the weeks leading up to the draft, it was widely accepted by the media that he would be the first pick in the draft. ==AFL career2009-2011: Early career=== Watts was recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 national draft. Drafted at seventeen years of age, he was in the last draft where a player could be recruited at seventeen, with the AFL requiring that, effective from the 2009 AFL draft, a player must turn at least eighteen years of age in the year they are drafted. The hype placed on him by the club was high when he was presented with the number four guernsey by six-time Melbourne premiership player, Ron Barassi‚Äîa guernsey number previously worn by club legend and the winner of ten premierships with the club as a player and coach, Norm Smith‚Äîin a ceremony at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) two days after being drafted. Completing year twelve in 2009, the need to manage school with football saw the club electing to not play him in pre-season matches during the NAB Cup. Watts played his first match for the year in the Victorian Football League (VFL) reserves for Melbourne's affiliate team, the Casey Scorpions, in the middle of April; against , he recorded twenty disposals and a goal. Spending two weeks in the VFL reserves, he was promoted to the VFL seniors for the forty-two point win against where he recorded sixteen disposals and three goals. A bye in the VFL a week later allowed him to return to APS football, playing for Brighton Grammar; a rare occurrence of an AFL-listed player playing school football, he kicked three goals in a draw against Melbourne Grammar. He spent the next three weeks in the VFL, where he recorded twenty- two and twenty-three disposals in the second and third week respectively, which saw him earn a spot in the AFL side for the annual Queen's Birthday clash against at the MCG in round eleven. With the Queen's Birthday match marketed as the club's biggest match during the year, then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, promoted the debut of Watts by imploring fans to come along so they \\"will look back at this time in three, four or five years to see where it all began and to be able to say I was there the day Jack Watts made his debut\\". His first touch saw him gang tackled by three Collingwood players, another contest saw him beaten by Martin Clarke, which led to a Collingwood goal; Collingwood captain, Nick Maxwell, gestured to Watts \\"that's your goal, mate! Welcome to real footy\\". The team ultimately lost by sixty-six points with Watts recording just eight disposals, a mark and a behind, playing on the half-forward line. He retained his spot the next week for a forty-eight point loss against at Etihad Stadium in which he kicked his first AFL goal. Recording nine disposals in his second match, the excitement surrounding Watts quickly turned to criticism with his school football coach and former AFL footballer, Robert Shaw, stating that he was not ready for AFL football. Premiership player and coach, Leigh Matthews, said he had not seen anything in Watts' first two matches to warrant him being the number one draft pick. He played his third and final AFL match of the year the next week in the fifty- five point loss against at the Gabba, where The Age journalist, Andrew Stafford, noted his confidence looked low. He spent the remainder of the year playing in the VFL. A quad strain in February 2010 curtailed Watts' pre- season, and a subsequent back injury further slowed down his preparation for the season. He was placed on a modified program, which meant he was unlikely to play in the AFL early in the season, instead easing him into VFL matches. He played his first match for the year in a VFL practice match against the Northern Bullants; he gathered nine disposals, playing in just the first half of the match. Round five in the VFL saw him kick four goals and he was named in the best players in the seventy-five point win against Coburg. His performance in the match saw him called up to the AFL side the next week for the round eight match against at the MCG. The match drew attention as it was the first time he would play an AFL match against Nic Naitanui, who was drafted with the pick directly after him in the 2008 draft. In the twenty-nine point loss, he recorded fifteen disposals and five marks. Watts retained his spot the next week for the round nine match against at TIO Stadium in Darwin, and kicked two early goals to help the club win by one point. He maintained his spot in the side for the remainder of the year, even after recording just three disposals against in round eleven, with the club opting to give him game time and reiterate he was a long-term prospect who would get better with time. He played fifteen games in his second season, kicking ten goals, with former Essendon forward and three-time Coleman Medallist, Matthew Lloyd, stating Watts would be \\"ecstatic\\" with his season and he \\"presented across half- forward so well and is building his body and engine to hold down that position for a sustained period for Melbourne\\". Shane Crawford, the 1999 Brownlow Medallist, noted he had improved that year and showed enough glimpses to predict he would be a top ten player in the competition in the next few years. A club post-season trip to China saw Watts play in an exhibition match against Brisbane known as the Shanghai Showdown; played at Jiangwan Stadium, Melbourne won the match by five points. Steve Johnson in round 19, 2011. Entering the 2011 season, Watts added significant muscle weight during the off-season, which saw him play with greater impact in the forward line, as evidenced in strong performances during pre-season matches and the NAB Cup. Forming a forward partnership with Liam Jurrah, pressure was expected to ease off of Watts who was still seen as a developing player. He started the home and away season slowly, struggling to make an impact during matches, and during the round three and four wins against Brisbane and respectively, he was the substitute in both matches‚Äîsubstituted off in round three and starting substitute in round four‚Äîto finish with six disposals in each of the matches. Head of football writer at the Herald Sun, Mark Robinson described him as an \\"almost player\\" who \\"almost took the mark, almost won the ball, [and] almost changed the game\\"; in addition, 1987 premiership coach, Robert Walls, noted he was \\"floundering\\". With the club having their first bye of the season the next week, Watts returned from the break with a turnaround in form; named in Melbourne's best players in the fifty-four point loss to West Coast at Patersons Stadium in round six, he was praised for his decision making and was one of teams' positive sparks according to The Age reporter, Simon White. He continued his good form and during the round ten loss against Carlton, he was entrusted with a new role in defence as the loose man; his new role was partly to help him gain confidence by having more disposals and to help with his forward development. After a few weeks of playing in both the forward line and off of half-back, he played as a forward for the entire round thirteen match against in the eighty-nine point win at the MCG; he recorded twenty-four disposals and a then-career high three goals. He backed this up the next week by kicking three goals and finished with nineteen disposals‚Äîeleven of which were contested‚Äîfour marks and four tackles in the twenty-seven point win against at the MCG; he earned his first Brownlow Medal votes in his career, receiving one vote, meaning he was the third best player on the ground as adjudged by the field umpires. Dean Bailey acknowledged after the match that Watts had had a consistent season to that point and then-teammate, Colin Sylvia, said his consistency was imperative for his development and he had established himself as an AFL footballer. A drop in Melbourne's performances saw Watts return to playing parts of games in the back line; the week after the club suffered a 186-point loss to at Skilled Stadium in round nineteen‚Äîthe second heaviest defeat in VFL/AFL history which ultimately cost Dean Bailey his job‚Äîcaretaker coach, Todd Viney, praised Watts for his performance in defence, stating he \\"really stood up\\" and \\"his work-rate was excellent\\" in the seventy-six point loss to Carlton. Playing every match for the year, his season was noted for his continual improvement, which was evident in his ninth-place finish in the club best and fairest count. ===2012-2013: Playing as a defender and inconsistencies=== With the off-season acquisition of Mitch Clark in the 2011 trade period, who was projected to be the number one forward in the team, the forward load was expected to be relieved off of Watts, who new coach, Mark Neeld, stated would play primarily as a forward alongside Clark, rather than as both a forward and back as was the case the previous season. He struggled for form during the 2012 NAB Cup where he had just three combined possessions in the first two matches against Brisbane and Gold Coast, before he was substituted out of the match against Collingwood the next week where he managed just seven disposals, which drew the ire of former Collingwood coach, Mick Malthouse, who said he lacked ambition when playing. He was subsequently omitted for the final pre-season match against Port Adelaide. After having an \\"impressive performance\\" playing for the Casey Scorpions in the VFL the week before the first round of the AFL season, Watts was named in the round one team for the match against Brisbane at the MCG. Struggling in the forward-line during pre-season matches, he instead started the match playing on the wing and finished with seventeen disposals. Playing the first five matches for the season, he struggled for consistency and was subsequently dropped for the round six match against Geelong at Simonds Stadium. With Neeld claiming Watts \\"had a few things [he needed] to work on\\", he played on the wing in the VFL where he kicked four goals and recorded twenty disposals and nine marks in the forty-six point win against in round seven. He stayed in the reserves the next week for the fifty-two point win against the and collected twenty-five disposals. His performances in the VFL saw him recalled to the senior side for the 101-point loss against at the Sydney Cricket Ground in round eight; he played the match as the loose man in defence and recorded a career-high thirty-four disposals, in addition to eleven marks, eight rebound-50s and fourteen intercept possessions, the second most by any player that season to that point. Watts maintained a spot in defence and was praised for his efforts there by the media; in the three-week period following his return to the AFL side, he ranked first in the league for intercept marks and intercept possessions, and second in rebound-50s. He played particularly well in the six point win against the second-placed team, Essendon, in round ten where he recorded twenty-four disposals, seven marks, seven rebound-50s and four tackles to earn three Brownlow votes, thereby being adjudged the best player on the ground by the field umpires. Three weeks later, he played his fiftieth AFL match in the seventy-eight point win against at the MCG in round thirteen. After playing every match from rounds eight to fifteen, he was forced to miss five weeks of football due to an ankle injury; he returned for the twenty-five point win against Greater Western Sydney at Manuka Oval in round twenty-one, to play the remainder of the season and finish with fifteen games in total. The recruitment of Chris Dawes during the 2012 trade period meant Watts would remain playing in defence for the 2013 season according to Mark Neeld; former Melbourne player, David Schwarz, said prior to the commencement of the season that Watts would flourish in defence and that he would ultimately become a consistent player. The opening round loss to Port Adelaide by seventy-nine points at the MCG where he managed just seven disposals saw the players booed by Melbourne fans as they left the field; things did not become easier the next week when the club lost to Essendon by 148-points at the MCG, a game in which he was substituted out and was jeered by the crowd when this was announced. His poor to start to the season led to him being dropped for the round three match against West Coast at the MCG; instead of playing for Casey in the VFL, he did not play any football for the weekend. Despite not playing and football for the week, he was recalled to the senior side for the forty-one point win against Greater Western Sydney at the MCG in round four. Watts returned to the forward line the next week in the twenty-eight point loss to Brisbane at the Gabba in round five where he kicked two goals and was named in Melbourne's best players. This was his last match before straining his hamstring and subsequently missing three weeks of football; he returned for the ninety point loss against Fremantle at Patersons Stadium in round nine. In the lead up to the match, reports emerged that he was unhappy at Melbourne due to the club's misfortunes and that he would seek a trade away from the club with Fremantle being a possible destination. After the sacking of Mark Neeld in mid-June, Watts stated he wanted to remain at the club, however, he put contract negotiations on hold at the end of July and stated he would not decide on whether he would re-sign with the club until a new senior coach was appointed. Interim coach, Neil Craig, opted to use Watts in a forward role and in Craig's second match in charge, he kicked a career-high four goals in the three point win over the at the MCG in round fourteen. In addition, he took a match-saving mark in defence and was awarded three Brownlow votes by the field umpires. His form improved under Craig, and Watts admitted he was not a fan of Neeld's hard-line coaching style, which was one of the reasons behind his poor form during Neeld's tenure. In the final round match against the Western Bulldogs at Etihad Stadium, he kicked an equal career-high four goals and in the eleven matches Neil Craig coached, Watts kicked eighteen goals. The end of season appointment of Paul Roos as senior coach resulted in Watts re-signing with the club on a three-year contract. ===2014-2017: Return to forward line and fulfilling potential=== Watts at training in July 2015 With the arrival of new coach, Paul Roos, Watts was assigned a new role in the midfield; after having a strong pre-season, Watts was predicted to play an on-ball role heading into the 2014 NAB Challenge. In the opening round match against at Etihad Stadium, he played primarily in the midfield and was named in Melbourne's best players; his new role saw him collect twenty-seven disposals and play with \\"confidence and flair\\" according to AFL Media reporter, Peter Ryan, who also claimed Watts \\"[looked] set for a big year\\". With not one of Melbourne's three big forwards available to play in the early rounds of the year, he was forced to spend more time in the forward line than initially intended. However, Roos said Watts would not revert to his former role as a permanent forward and would instead spend time in the midfield. After a promising performance in round one, Watts played inconsistently the next few matches and played with a lack of intensity, according to former Richmond and Western Bulldogs forward, Nathan Brown. Pressure mounted on him with the media debating whether he should be dropped for the round seven match against at the Adelaide Oval. Roos defended his position and said Watts would maintain his position in the side, and that he could not understand the public's fixation with Watts and his form. He turned his form around in the seventeen point win against Richmond at the MCG in round nine where he kicked three goals and recorded a career-high eleven marks; he was pivotal in the win and settled into a mid-forward role for the rest of the year. Watts played every match during the year and despite Paul Roos labelling Watts' season a success, he could not escape the disapproval of the media. Former player and The Age journalist, Matthew Lloyd, described his season as \\"disappointing\\", former Melbourne player and SEN reporter, David Schwarz, noted he was \\"treading water\\" and said that his season had been \\"underwhelming\\", and Leigh Matthews and Lloyd questioned his commitment to the sport. Although his season received mixed reviews, he finished inside the top ten of Melbourne's best and fairest count for the second time in his career, finishing tenth overall. With the intention of playing the 2015 season in the forward line alongside Jesse Hogan and Chris Dawes, a groin injury hampered Watts' pre-season training for three months heading into the season. He had a strong start to the season recording seventeen disposals, seven marks and three goals in the club's twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round one and was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media. After a buoyant start to the season, he quickly found himself facing negativity from the media after the round three loss to Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval where he dropped two marks in quick succession, with one leading to an Adelaide goal. Multiple media figures called for him to be dropped with David Schwarz stating he \\"might have to sit out a week\\" and Dermott Brereton professing \\"you have to make a stand as to what your team stands for, and that means you can't bring him back in until you are convinced he will not do that again\\"; Jason Dunstall supplemented these statements by noting \\"he can't relapse into these kind of performances\\", adding \\"I don't like using the word, but he looked a little soft at times\\". Two weeks later, he played his 100th AFL match in the sixty- eight point loss to Fremantle at the MCG in round five, a game in which he managed just seven disposals; after his milestone match he was condemned by Matthew Lloyd on the Nine Network's Footy Classified, saying \\"he's been gifted 100 games of AFL football\\". In the thirty-eight point loss against Sydney at the MCG the next week, he started as the substitute with Paul Roos attempting to ease the burden on Watts, although Roos later admitted starting as the substitute probably increased pressure on Watts. The relentless pressure on Watts saw him omitted the next week for the round seven match against , although it initially appeared he was dropped by the coaching panel, it was later revealed by Paul Roos that Watts asked to be dropped so he could find form playing in the VFL. Leigh Matthews described Watts' decision to drop himself as a shock because it never happened in his twenty years of coaching and he found it difficult to take seriously. Recording twenty-four disposals, eight marks and a goal in the VFL, his performance was described as \\"solid\\" by AFL Media journalist, Peter Ryan and he was recalled to the senior side after the one week in the VFL for the thirty-nine point win against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. Watts playing for Melbourne in the 2017 Queen's Birthday match. Watts' return to the AFL saw his form improve, particularly his average disposal count, which increased by six a match in the five weeks from rounds eight to twelve, compared with the first six weeks of the season; he credited the opportunity to play in the VFL as a key reason to his improved form and his mind frame was more \\"calm and relaxed\\" heading into matches. He continued his good form playing on both the wing and in the forward line and after his performance in the thirty-seven point win against Collingwood at the MCG in round eighteen where he recorded twenty-six disposals‚Äîeleven of which were contested‚Äîfour marks and a goal, Herald Sun journalist, Chris Vernuccio, stated he was starting to \\"fulfil his potential and silence the doubters\\" and The Age journalist, Michael Gleeson, noted he may have finally \\"turned a corner\\". The next few weeks saw Melbourne suffer heavy defeats and as Melbourne's form diminished, so did Watts' and he was omitted from the side for the final round clash against Greater Western Sydney at Etihad Stadium. Watts finished the season playing twenty matches in total. Entering the 2016 season, Watts was in his final year of his contract and would be eligible for free agency at the end of the season if he remained unsigned; before the start of the season, speculation began as to whether he would remain at the club beyond the year or instead explore his free agency options. His first match of the season‚Äîthe two-point win against Greater Western Sydney at the MCG‚Äîwas \\"superb\\" according to The Age journalist Jon Pierik; he recorded eighteen disposals, ten marks and a goal in the last quarter to help the team turn a twenty-one point deficit into a two-point win. Compared with previous seasons where he would play particularly well in the first match and then lose form quickly, he maintained his good form beyond the first match, which he credited to the team's improved performances. Watts' positive form was especially apparent in the thirty-five point win against Collingwood at the MCG in round four where he recorded seventeen disposals, eight marks and an equal career- high four goals to receive the maximum three Brownlow votes. The head of football writer at the Herald Sun, Mark Robinson, also attributed his consistency to stability in his position‚Äîwhereas in previous years he was moved around the ground, even multiple times during a match‚Äîhe was now used as a permanent forward playing alongside Jesse Hogan. With the late withdrawal of Cameron Pedersen from the team in the sixty-three point victory over Brisbane at the MCG in round nine, Watts was forced to play as the back-up ruckman, which further proved his versatility; the move surprised onlookers, but he was praised by the media, particularly by Fox Sports Australia journalist, Sarah Olle, who noted his athleticism led to a \\"surprisingly good\\" result. Being in career best form according to the media, Watts signed a three-year contract extension in July, tying him to the club until the end of the 2019 season. A week after his contract extension was announced, Watts was crucial in the two- point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round nineteen when he kicked the winning goal with two minutes left in the match, his third of the match, and took a goal-saving mark in defence with forty-four seconds left on the clock. He was labelled as \\"the difference\\" in the match by Fox Sports Australia journalist, Anna Harrington, and Mark Robinson noted his match-winning performance showed great leadership, an area he had previously been criticised as lacking in. His performance in the match earned him two Brownlow votes to be recognised as the second best player on the ground by the field umpires. He played every match for the season and kicked a career-high thirty-eight goals, in addition to achieving career-highs in marks, inside-50s, marks inside-50, and goal assists. His career-best season to date saw him finish inside the top-five of Melbourne's best and fairest for the first time in his career, finishing fifth overall, and he was named in the AFL Media's team of the week three times during the season. ===2018‚Äìpresent: Move to Port Adelaide=== Watts was traded to the Port Adelaide Football Club during the 2017 trade period. In September 2020, Watts announced his retirement effective immediately on the eve of Port Adelaide's 2020 finals campaign. ==Playing style== As a junior, Watts played in the forward line as a strong-marking tall and was an accurate shot on goal. Regarded as an incredibly quick player for his height, especially over the first twenty metres, his speed and athleticism saw him dominate in the forward line as a junior. After struggling to replicate his form from the juniors in the AFL, he was trialled as a defender in 2011 by then senior-coach, Dean Bailey, playing primarily as the loose man in defence. Bailey intended on using him as both a defender and forward; he recognised Watts would not be the main key forward at the club, which was intended when he was drafted, but when playing in the forward line, he would instead be used as a floating forward. He played a new role in 2012 under Mark Neeld in defence, where he was highly praised for his ability to read the play and take intercept marks. He played in defence for the duration of Neeld's tenure, until Neeld was sacked and replaced by Neil Craig in the middle of 2013 with Craig electing to return Watts to the forward line. After playing in the forward line and in defence, incoming coach in 2014, Paul Roos, saw an opportunity for Watts to play in the midfield due to his body size and elite kicking, in addition to the club needing an influx of midfielders. After the desperate need for midfielders dissipated, Watts returned to a half-forward role in the middle of 2014; he played as a half-forward throughout Roos' coaching term and was used as a back-up ruckman in 2016. Trialled in nearly every position on the ground, Watts is known for his versatility on the field and is regarded as a utility who can play multiple positions during a match. Despite his versatility, he does not have a strong endurance base and instead plays in bursts; he admitted in 2014 that he struggled for consistency early in his career due to becoming too tired during matches, and from then on, he utilised the interchange bench more often during a match so he could become a \\"burst player\\". Although he is not a strong endurance runner, he has been compared to two-time Brownlow Medallist, Adam Goodes, by The Age journalist, Michael Gleeson, noting that both did not have great endurance but could use their speed to impact matches. Furthermore, Watts acknowledged that he modelled his playing style on Hawthorn's Jack Gunston, who is regarded as one of the most damaging forwards in the league. ==Criticism== Considered to be one of the most maligned players in the Melbourne Football Club's history, Watts' career has been filled with criticism from the media, fans and members of the football industry. The seeds for the ongoing criticism were planted when he was announced as the number one draft pick in the 2008 AFL draft; the hype surrounding him meant that the expectations placed on him before he had even played a match were going to be difficult to live up to. Some of these lofty expectations included being seen as the replacement for club champion, David Neitz, who is the club's games and goals record holder, being labelled as a potential future captain, being one of the team's most valuable players, before he had even played an AFL match, with the club unable to afford him being injured, and claims he was the \\"great white hope\\" who would lift the club off the bottom of the ladder. With the number one draft pick described as a \\"poisoned chalice\\" by the Herald Sun journalist, Jon Anderson, Watts has been continually compared to the players who were drafted after him and who rivalled him for the number one pick, especially the number two pick, Nic Naitanui. The choice to choose Watts over Naitanui has been one of the most talked about draft decisions, with many deeming the decision to be incorrect, especially considering Naitanui's impact for West Coast which included earning All-Australian honours in just his fourth season. Daniel Rich at the time was also considered a potential first pick; with Rich winning the AFL Rising Star in his first year, the choice by Melbourne to recruit Watts was further questioned. Despite the comparisons to other players, many people in the media believe the label of \\"number one draft pick\\" placed too much unfair expectation on Watts, which he would never be able to live up to; some of these people include former player Nathan Brown, The Age journalists, Greg Baum and Brent Diamond, and former coaches, Mark Neeld and Paul Roos, who both said being the number one draft pick set him up to fail. It took Watts three months into his first season before he made his debut with the club choosing their biggest match of the year to name him for his debut, the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood. The fanfare and expectation the club placed on him for his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club about how they mismanaged his first match; five years after his debut, Paul Roos said he was appalled at how the club handled him for his debut. His first touch of the football saw him \\"gang tackled\\" by three Collingwood players, with some suggesting the tackle \\"ruined him\\"; teammate on the day, Russell Robertson, dispelled these thoughts and said the team did not do enough to protect him, with the Collingwood captain at the time, Nick Maxwell, admitting in 2016 that the hype surrounding Watts did lead them to purposely be rougher with him than a standard player to ensure they limited his impact. Despite then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, claiming he was ready to play and keeping him in the team for three weeks, the football industry disagreed and scrutinised the club for using him as a marketing tool to provide a sense of hope for fans rather than doing what was best for Watts' development. With much of the criticism placed on the club during his first year, the scrutiny turned to Watts during the next few seasons as it was deemed that he was not living up to his potential or the public's expectations. This was partly due to Watts displaying a lack of urgency and work-rate on the field according to former players Wayne Carey, Garry Lyon and coach Mick Malthouse. He played the early parts of his career in different positions, which Garry Lyon wrote led to an instability in his game and was a reason for why he, at times, lacked confidence and self-belief in his abilities. He was often very quickly scrutinised when he played poorly, and was the first to player to be blamed when the team played a bad match, which led to Paul Roos questioning why the public had such a fixation with Watts' form. He was also plagued with being known as the \\"great white hope\\" as soon as he was drafted and due to the club trailing near the bottom of the ladder from 2009 to 2015 and experiencing failed rebuilds, Watts was symbolically seen as a poster boy for Melbourne's failures during this period. The overall mismanagement of Watts by the club and general criticism from the media led to multiple media personalities calling for him to be traded, including Damian Barrett and Peter Ryan in 2013, Ben McKay and Mark Robinson in 2014, and Jon Pierik and Matt Murnane in 2015. The former list manager at Hawthorn, Chris Pelchen, wrote that Watts had become the greatest example of a list management trap, whereby the club's drafting decisions would look \\"silly\\" if they traded him. Mark Robinson also noted that social media is the AFL's most damaging opponent with the emergence of the platform further exposing players to public criticism and that there was not a name Watts had not been called on Facebook and Twitter. Watts had his career best season in 2016 which saw the criticism turning to praise; Watts credited his career turnaround to outgoing coach, Paul Roos. ==Statistics== : : Statistics are correct to the end of the 2017 season - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2009   4  3  2  2  16  11  27  9  1  0.7  0.7  5.3  3.7  9.0  3.0  0.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2010   4  15  10  4  115  74  189  70  15  0.7  0.4  7.7  4.9  12.6  4.7  1.0 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2011   4  22  21  11  198  157  355  124  53  1.0  0.5  9.0  7.1  16.1  5.5  2.4 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2012   4  15  5  1  149  129  278  83  23  0.3  0.1  9.9  8.6  18.5  5.5  1.5 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2013   4  18  22  12  157  110  267  95  29  1.2  0.7  8.7  6.1  14.8  5.3  1.6 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2014   4  22  13  8  200  185  385  109  58  0.6  0.4  9.1  8.4  17.5  5.0  2.6 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2015   4  20  10  6  169  156  325  102  29  0.5  0.3  8.5  7.8  16.3  5.1  1.5 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2016   4  22  38  18  226  125  351  139  39  1.7  0.8  10.3  5.7  16.0  6.3  1.8 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2017   4  16  22  9  129  122  251  77  42  1.4  0.6  8.1  7.6  15.7  4.8  2.6 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 153 ! 143 ! 71 ! 1359 ! 1069 ! 2428 ! 808 ! 302 ! 0.9 ! 0.5 ! 8.9 ! 7.0 ! 14.9 ! 5.3 ! 2.0 } ==Other work== In December 2015, Watts and two of his close friends, Adam Walsh and Jack Turner, started a men's clothing line called Skwosh which focuses primarily on swimming trunks.

At each time, it maintains its estimate of the target state as the mean and covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution. However, unlike the PDAF, which is only meant for tracking a single target in the presence of false alarms and missed detections, the JPDAF can handle multiple target tracking scenarios. A derivation of the JPDAF is given in. The JPDAF is one of several techniques for radar target tracking and for target tracking in the field of computer vision. ==The Coalescence Problem== A common problem observed with the JPDAF is that estimates of closely spaced targets tend to coalesce over time. This is because the MMSE estimate is typically undesirable when target identity is uncertain. Variants of the JPDAF algorithm have been made that try to avoid track coalescence. For example, the Set JPDAF uses an approximate minimum mean optimal sub pattern assignment (MMOSPA) instead of an approximate MMSE estimator. The JPDAF*, modifies how the target-measurement association probabilities are computed, and variants of the global nearest-neighbor JPDAF (GNN-JPDAF) (a best-hypothesis tracker) use the global nearest neighbor (GNN) estimate in place of the mean but compute the covariance matrix as in the normal JPDAF: as a mean-squared error matrix. ==Implementations== * Matlab: The PDAF, JPDAF, Set JPDAF, JPDAF*, GNN-JPDAF and multiple other exact and approximate variants of the JPDAF are implemented in the \`singleScanUpdate\` function that is part of the United States Naval Research Laboratory's free Tracker Component Library.

Growing up in Midvale, Naitanui attended Governor Stirling Senior High School, and played football for the Midvale Junior Football Club. After representing Western Australia in the 2007 and 2008 AFL Under 18 Championships, he debuted in 2008 for the Swan Districts Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). Naitanui was drafted by West Coast with the second pick in the 2008 National Draft. Naitanui made his AFL debut for West Coast in round 12 of the 2009 season, against . He played ten games in his debut season, and received one Brownlow Medal vote for a three-goal game against . In his second season, Naitanui played every game, primarily as a back-up ruckman to Dean Cox, taking over the position of Mark Seaby, who was traded the previous season. Having started the season as the favourite for the AFL Rising Star, Naitanui finished 5th overall. In the 2011 season, he played 23 games, including his first finals matches, and was also nominated for Mark of the Year. He was named in the All- Australian team the following season, as the first-choice ruckman. ==Early life== Along with his twin brother, Mark, Naitanui was born to Bola and Atetha Naitanui on 4 May 1990 in Penrith, New South Wales. His parents, originally from Suvavou, a small village near Suva, had emigrated to Australia from Fiji the previous year, with his two elder siblings, Georgie and Laisani, remaining in Fiji.

Many media commentators believed that Naitanui was in contention to be taken as the number 1 pick in the 2008 AFL Draft.The four tops; 1 October 2008 The Melbourne Football Club, who retained that pick, had looked at Naitanui, but raised concerns about his skill level, in particular his kicking, and instead selected Victorian Jack Watts. ==AFL career 2009‚Äì2015: Early career === Naitanui was taken at pick No. 2 overall in the 2008 AFL Draft by the West Coast Eagles. As a highly rated future player by John Worsfold, Naitanui was given the number 9 guernsey, becoming the first West Coast Eagles player to wear the number since Brownlow Medalist and former captain Ben Cousins left the club at the end of the 2007 season. His first game at the senior level was on 13 June 2009 when he was named to play against Richmond in game 12 of the 2009 season. His career suffered a setback, however, during pre-season training when he experienced knee soreness and had precautionary surgery. Naitanui impressed enough in the WAFL in a game where he accumulated 15 possessions, 21 hit-outs, 4 goals and a spectacular mark, to earn his selection in the round 12 against Richmond at Etihad Stadium. His debut game impressed many, demonstrating his athletic ability with another spectacular mark as well as 3 kicks, 8 handballs, 3 marks and 7 hitouts.Naitanui debut lives up to the hype In his second game against premiers Hawthorn at Subiaco, Naitanui was quiet for the first three quarters but dazzled in the fourth, kicking three goals and leading his team to a come-from-behind win.Naitanui leads Eagles to win over Hawks Naitanui was honoured with a nomination for the AFL Rising Star in round 4, 2010 in the West Coast Eagles win over the Essendon Bombers, a match where Naitanui dominated with 13 disposals, 5 tackles and 17 hitouts. Naitanui took out the West Coast's Rookie of the Year Award for the 2010 Season and finished fifth in the 2010 Club Champion Award. In March 2012, a viral video of Naitanui performing a slam dunk at a Perth Wildcats basketball game received over 100,000 views on YouTube.Perth Wildcats - Nic Naitanui Dunk ‚Äì YouTube. Uploaded 4 March 2012. Retrieved 18 March 2012. On 17 September 2012 Naitanui earned his first All Australian Team nomination being named as the starting Ruckman. On the Friday Night game against North Melbourne in round 8, 2013, Naitanui took a memorable pack mark 30m out with seconds left on the clock. He proceeded to kick a goal after the siren to win the game by 2 points, becoming the 35th AFL player to do so. Naitanui played his 100th AFL game in round 13, 2014, against the Gold Coast Suns. West Coast won by three points. === 2016‚Äì2018: ACL ruptures === In round 21, during the 2016 season, Naitanui kicked a goal with 4 seconds remaining against the GWS Giants, winning the game for the Eagles. He ruptured his ACL in the following game, and missed the rest of the 2016 season. Naitanui missed the entire 2017 season. Naitanui was in contention to play his first game for the season in the first semi-final against , but did not play. During the 2018 season, Naitanui was suspended for a week following a tackle on Port Adelaide's Karl Amon. The decision was heavily criticised by the AFL media and past players where it was believed he was punished for being the stronger player in the tackle. In round 17 of the 2018 season, after 15 games back from an injury to his left anterior cruciate ligament, Naitanui landed awkwardly in a contest just before half time of the match against the Collingwood Magpies, suffering the same injury to his right anterior cruciate ligament. He was expected to miss 10‚Äì12 months of football after a reconstruction. ===2019 Comeback=== After nearly a year out of the game, Naitanui returned to AFL football in round 15 against Hawthorn, after playing just one game with limited match time for the WAFL Eagles team. ==Statistics== : Statistics are correct to the end of the 2020 AFL Finals Series - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\"  2009   9  10  3  3  15  83  98  10  39  152  0.3  0.3  1.5  8.3  9.8  1.0  3.9  15.2 -  2010   9  22  9  9  94  163  257  31  74  366  0.4  0.4  4.3  7.4  11.7  1.4  3.4  16.6 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\"  2011   9  23  18  10  120  179  299  50  88  457  0.8  0.4  5.2  7.8  13.0  2.2  3.8  19.9 -  2012   9  22  24  14  116  171  287  66  75  543  1.1  0.6  5.3  7.8  13.0  3.0  3.4  24.7 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\"  2013   9  11  8  3  56  71  127  25  39  279  0.7  0.3  5.1  6.5  11.5  2.3  3.5  25.4 -  2014   9  20  9  7  85  164  249  31  77  438  0.5  0.4  4.3  8.2  12.5  1.6  3.9  21.9 - style=\\"background- color: #EAEAEA\\"  2015   9  23  17  13  132  136  268  33  82  782  0.7  0.6  5.7  6.0  11.7  1.4  3.6  34.0 -  2016   9  15  8  3  81  106  187  35  42  517  0.5  0.2  5.4  7.0  12.5  2.3  2.8  34.5 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\"  2017   9  0  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî -  2018   9  15  6  5  82  81  163  25  64  459  0.4  0.3  5.5  5.4  10.9  1.7  4.3  30.6 -  2019   9  5  0  2  37  25  62  7  17  146  0.0  0.4  7.4  5.0  12.4  1.4  3.4  29.2 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  2020   9  17  5  4  109  13  192  13  40  496  0.3  0.2  6.4  4.9  11.3  0.8  2.4  29.2 - ! colspan=3 Career ! 183 ! 107 ! 73 ! 927 ! 1262 ! 2189 ! 326 ! 637 ! 4635 ! 0.6 ! 0.4 ! 5.1 ! 6.9 ! 12.0 ! 1.8 ! 3.5 ! 25.3 } ==References*Nic Naitanui player profile page at WAFL FootyFacts Category:1990 births Category:All-Australians (AFL) Category:Australian people of I-Taukei Fijian descent Category:People educated at Governor Stirling Senior High School Category:Swan Districts Football Club players Category:Twin people from Australia Category:Twin sportspeople Category:West Coast Eagles players Category:Living people Category:People from Rewa Province Category:Australia international rules football team players Category:Sportspeople from Sydney Category:Australian rules footballers from Perth, Western Australia Category:West Coast Eagles (WAFL) players ","title":"Nic Naitanui"},{"id":"20459781","text":"DXDR (88.3 FM) - broadcasting as 88.3 Energy FM Davao - is the flagship music FM radio station owned and operated by Ultrasonic Broadcasting System Inc..

He attended Jesuit schools in Conitz (now Chojnice) and Thorn (Toru≈Ñ), then studied law in Rome. For a time he was a court scribe (pisarz sƒÖdowy) in Skarszewy, then was secretary to Crown Deputy Chancellor Andrzej Lipski and became an official in the Crown Chancellery. In 1730 Grabowski took holy orders and, as a trusted associate of Chancellor Jan Aleksander (?) Lipski, quickly accumulated lucrative benefices. He received canonicates in Lw√≥w and W≈Çoc≈Çawek, a deanery in Che≈Çmno, and presbyteries in Jaworowo, Skaryszew, and Tujce. In 1733 he became the Pozna≈Ñ suffragan. During the 1733‚Äì34 interregnum, Grabowski backed August III, later taking part in his coronation. In 1734 he worked to win the Royal Prussia szlachta (nobility) for August III, then was the king's envoy to Rome, where he obtained Pope Clement XIII's support for August III's election as King of Poland. As a reward for his mission to Rome, in 1736 Grabowski was appointed Bishop of Che≈Çmno. In 1737 he returned to Poland. In 1739 he was transferred to the more lucrative Kujawy Bishopric. He participated actively in the 1738 and 1740 sejms (parliaments). On 14 April 1741 he was preconized Bishop of Warmia. Grabowski allied himself with the Czartoryski Familia and carried out in Royal Prussia the court's policy of blocking the general sejmiks. In 1743‚Äì44 he was president of the Radom Treasury Tribunal. In a speech before the Grodno Sejm in 1744, he conditioned an expansion of the army on improvement in the national economy. He participated in the sejms of 1746 and 1748. In 1749 he was royal commissioner in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), where he resolved disputes between the Council and the burgher opposition. From 1746 he headed a commission that oversaw the reconstruction of a sluice dividing the Vistula River into the Nogat and Leniwka Rivers. Bishop Grabowski's coat-of-arms on a gun he commissioned. Polish Army Museum, Warsaw. During the Seven Years' War, Grabowski gave financial assistance to King August III and sought to protect Warmia from armies marching across her territory. In the face of mounting conflict between the Czartoryskis and the royal court, he declared in favor of the King and gradually withdrew from politics, maintaining his neutrality in a dispute between \\"Prussian patriots\\" and Pomeranian Governor (Wojewoda) Pawe≈Ç Mostowski. During the 1763‚Äì64 interregnum, he recognized Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski as king. In 1765 he sold his Warsaw palace for a national mint. At King Stanis≈Çaw August's request, not long before his death in 1766 he accepted Ignacy Krasicki as his coadjutor with right of succession. During his reign over Warmia, Grabowski was the first to use the metropolitan's pallium and cross, granted in Pope Benedict XIV's bull of 24 September 1742. Bishop Grabowski was a good husbandman and patron of the arts. At a 1748 conference of cities, he brought about a revision of 1718 tax rates and a more equitable distribution of fiscal burdens. At a conference of Warmia estates in Wormditt (Orneta) on 4 July 1766, he issued ordinances regulating the everyday lives of Warmians in relation to agriculture, trade and crafts. The ordinances had been discussed with the Warmia chapter. In the realm of cartography and land reclamation he collaborated with Jan Suchodolec, son of a Protestant Polish Brother who had found refuge at Alt Rosenthal (today Stara R√≥≈ºanka), near Rastenburg (today Kƒôtrzyn) in the Lutheran Kingdom of Prussia. At Grabowski's initiative, the chapel at Heilsberg Lidzbark Castle received a Rococo decor, and before the castle's eastern wing there appeared a new structure, \\"Grabowski's palace.\\" Grabowski also founded a church at Franknowo, financed the rebuilding of churches in Lamkowo, Bisztynek and K√∂nigsberg, and bestowed main altars upon the Dobre Miasto collegiate church, St. Nicholas' Church in Elbing (ElblƒÖg), and Frauenburg Frombork Cathedral. Grabowski also restored the bishops' summer residence at Smolajny. He gave financial support to Stanis≈Çaw Konarski's initiatives such as the Collegium Nobilium. He maintained close contacts with men of learning such as Jan Daniel Janocki. He passed on to Gottfried Lengnich for printing a 1426 manuscript of Kad≈Çubek's Chronicles that he had found, and the \\"Heilsberg manuscript\\" of Gallus Anonymus. It was thanks to Grabowski that Johann Friedrich Endersch'sRoyal Mathematician to King August III of Poland. map of the diocese (the Map of Holy Warmia) was published. He himself took an interest in the history of art and gathered extensive collections of books, statues, paintings and porcelain.

Back in the United States, he attended Vero Beach Senior High School (where he played bass in the school jazz band), the University of Florida, and the University of Miami. In Vero Beach, he was active in a number of acts, one of which, Axehammer, was popular in local nightclubs. Lyon later moved to Los Angeles, CA, with percussionist and Vero Beach native, Michael Rogers, who also attended the University of Miami. He was in many bands during the 1980s and early 1990s, including Jim Ehinger's Los Angeles China Club house band, which backed up artists as diverse as Rick James, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Herbie Hancock, John Entwhistle, Chaka Khan, and Joe Walsh, to name a few of the acts who played on Los Angeles' most notorious Monday jam nights. Lyon's first major tour was as keyboardist with the Australian band Divinyls during the 1986-87 Australian Made Tour with INXS and Jimmy Barnes, as well as several regional tours of Australia. Returning from this tour he spent thirteen months writing the novel Three Monkeys. During this time he also recorded with Paul Roessler and played in the band Twisted Roots, as well as with Priscilla and Rita Coolidge, David Baerwald, and others. After recording and touring with Mark Curry, recording with Jann Arden, and recording with Doc Lawrence, Lyon moved to New York, eventually recording and touring with The Lemonheads beginning in 1996.

He invented various methods to improve the rifled gun, particularly ball grooves (not to be confused with the Mini√© ball). ==Ball grooves== Captain Tamisier obtained a patent in 1841 for a method to improve the accuracy of cylindro-conical shot, by cutting three sharp grooves (French: \\"cannelures\\") on the cylindrical part of the shot.Military Dictionary by H. L. Scott p.510 1863 Before Tamisier's invention, the orientation of a cylindro-conical bullet would tend to remain along its inertial axis, progressively setting it against its trajectory and increasingly meeting air resistance, which would render the bullet's movement erratic. Compared to round shots, which offered a rather inefficient but symmetric and stable aerodynamic round profile, the aerodynamic stability of the cylindro-conical shot had been an issue in early rifled weapons of the type developed by Delvigne.Rifles by David Westwood, p.275-276 Through Tamisier's method, the resistance of the air behind the center of gravity of the shot was increased, thereby increasing its stability. The Tamisier grooves greatly improved the efficiency of the cylindro-conical bullet. However they rendered the forcing of the bullet against the grooves of the rifle bore in the Delvigne system rather difficult. To accommodate this difficulty, the stem rifle was developed by Thouvenin. These principles were later incorporated in the design of the Mini√© ball. ==Progressive rifle grooves== Tamisier also developed a method for making rifle grooves, which was original in that the grooves were deeper at the breech and progressively shallower towards the muzzle. This provided for a progressive forcing of the ball as it moved through the barrel, greatly improving its efficiency.Deanes' Manual of the History and Science of Fire-arms by John Deane p.237-238 The United Service Magazine 1853 p.501 ==Notes== Category:1809 births Category:1880 deaths Category:People from Lons-le-Saunier Category:Artillery of France ","title":"Fran√ßois Tamisier"},{"id":"20459984","text":"Zhidu Temple Pagoda The Zhidu Temple Pagoda () of Zhuozhou, Hebei province, China, is a pagoda dating from the Liao dynasty (907‚Äì1125). ==History== The pagoda remained intact until 1925.

(Pommersches Landesmuseum, German) From the Napoleonic Wars to the end of World War I, Pomerania was administered by the Kingdom of Prussia as the Province of Pomerania (Western (Hither) and Farther Pomerania) and Province of West Prussia (Pomerelia). After World War I Pomerania was divided between Poland and Germany. After the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II as Emperor of Germany and King of Prussia, Western Pomerania was part of the Free State of Prussia within the Weimar Republic, while the eastern part (Pomerelia) became a part of Poland, and organized into the Pomeranian Voivodeship. The Polish Corridor of the Second Polish Republic was established from the bulk of West Prussia, causing an exodus of the German minority there. Poland build a large Baltic port at Gdynia (Gdingen). The Danzig (Gdansk) area became the city state Free City of Danzig. The industrial revolution primarily affected the Stettin area and the infrastructure, while most Pomerania retained a rural and agricultural character.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 412, 413, 464ff, . Since 1850, the net migration rate was negative, German Pomeranians emigrated primarily to Berlin, the west German industrial regions and overseas.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 400ff, . Many also immigrated to the United States, especially the state of Wisconsin, which was founded in 1848. == Napoleonic Wars and its consequences == Prussian Field marshal August Neidhardt von Gneisenau congratulates Joachim Nettelbeck for defending Kolberg against the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte. Former memorial in Kolberg, sculpted by Georg Meyer-Steglitz in 1904. After Prussia lost the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in late 1806, French troops marched north into the Pomeranian province. Fortified Stettin surrendered without battle, and the province became occupied by the French forces. Only fortified Kolberg resisted, and the French laid a siege in March 1807. Ferdinand von Schill was among the defendants. The siege was not successful and was lifted only when Prussia surrendered to Napoleon Bonaparte in the Peace of Tilsit on July 2.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 360, . Napoleonic occupation also thwarted Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden's plans to construct a fortified port city on R√ºgen, Gustavia. Constructions had begun in 1806, but the unfinished town was levelled by the French forces already in the following year.* The terms of surrender included high war reparations (25,000,000 Taler from the Province of Pomerania alone). The agreed withdrawal of the French troops was delayed repeatedly. In November 1808, the French troops left the province except for Stettin, which forced the provincial government to move to Stargard in 1809. The Kriegs- und Dom√§nenkammer was renamed Royal-Prussian government (\\"K√∂niglich Preu√üische Regierung\\"), while the former government (\\"Regierung\\") was renamed Supreme State Court (\\"Oberlandesgericht\\").Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 363, 364, . In 1812, French troops invaded Swedish Pomerania, and also occupied Prussian Pomerania again. The Prussian troops took quarter in Kolberg. After Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, who commanded a Prussian corps with a significant Pomeranian share, had left the coalition with France in the Convention of Tauroggen of December 30, 1812, the Prussian military called the Pomeranians to arms in February 1813. Also in February, Russian troops reached Farther Pomerania. In March, all French forces left Pomerania, except for Stettin, which was held by the French until December 5, 1813. After the war, Prussia after diplomatic efforts of Karl August von Hardenberg in the Congress of Vienna gained Swedish Pomerania by paying 2,6 million Taler to Denmark and granting her the Duchy of Lauenburg, and paying an additional 3,5 million Taler to Sweden on June 7, 1815. On October 23, Swedish Pomerania was merged into the Prussian province, both now constituting the Province of Pomerania. After Napoleon's break-up of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Western Part was the member of the German Confederation. After foundation of the German Empire of 1871, the whole of Pomerania was included into the newly created state. == The Pomeranian provinces between 1815 and World War I  Province of Pomerania before World War I === The Province of Pomerania () was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia and the Free State of Prussia from 1815 until 1934.  Creation and administration of the province within the Kingdom of Prussia  Map of the Prussian Province of Pomerania (Pommern)in 1905 Karl August von Hardenberg Although there had been a Prussian Province of Pomerania before, the Province of Pomerania was newly reconstituted in 1815, based on the \\"decree concerning improved establishment of provincial offices\\" (), issued by Karl August von Hardenberg on 30 April, and the integration of Swedish Pomerania, handed over to Prussia on October 23.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 366, . The Hardenberg decree reformed all Prussian territories, which henceforth formed ten (later eight) provinces with similar administration. After the implementation of the reform, the new Province of Pomerania consisted basically of her predecessor and Swedish Pomerania, but also of the Dramburg and Schivelbein counties. The province was headed by a governor (Oberpr√§sident, literally \\"superior president\\") with his seat in the capital, Stettin. It was subdivided into government regions (Regierungsbezirke) headed by a president (Regierungspr√§sident). Initially, two such regions were planned (Regierungsbezirk Stettin, comprising Western Pomerania, and Regierungsbezirk K√∂slin, comprising Farther Pomerania). Hardenberg however, who as the Prussian chief diplomat had settled the terms of session of Swedish Pomerania with Sweden at the Congress of Vienna, had assured to leave the local constitution in place when the treaty was signed on June 7, 1815. This circumstance led to a creation of a third government region, Regierungsbezirk Stralsund, for the former Swedish Pomerania at the expense of the Stettin region.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 366‚Äì369, . In early 1818, governor Johann August Sack had reformed the county (Kreis) shapes, yet adopted the former shape in most cases. K√∂slin government region comprised nine counties, Stettin government region thirteen, and Stralsund government region four (identical with the previous Swedish Amt districts). The new parliament (Landtag) assembled first on October 3, 1824. Based on two laws of June 5Allgemeines Gesetz wegen Anordnung der Provinzialst√§nde. and July,Gesetz wegen Anordnung der Provinzialst√§nde im Herzogtum Pommern und im F√ºrstentum R√ºgen. 1823, the Landtag was constituted by 25 lords and knights, 16 representatives of the towns, and eight from the rural communities.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 375, . Subordinate to the provincial Landtag were two Kommunallandtag assemblies, one for former Swedish Pomerania (Western Pomerania north of the Peene river) and one for the former Prussian part.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 377, . The counties each assembled a Kreisstand, where the knights of the county had a vote each and towns also just one vote.\\"Kreisordnung des Herzogtums Pommern und des F√ºrstentums R√ºgen\\" of August 17, 1825. Throughout its existence, the province was a stronghold of the conservative parties.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 377ff, 439ff, .  Reorganisation of Catholic Church institutions in Pomerania  With the conversion of most Pomeranians to Lutheranism in the 16th and 17th centuries the Duchy of Pomerania turned into a Catholic diaspora. However, the repopulation policy under Frederick II of Prussia brought about the settlement of Palatine Catholics in Pomerania in 1748. So their three newly founded villages of Blumenthal (a part of today's Ferdinandshof), Hoppenwalde (a part of today's Eggesin) and Viereck formed the first new post-Reformation Catholic congregations in Pomerania. The Catholic Northern Missions took care of Catholic Pomeranians. Between 1709 and 1780 then Brandenburgian Pomerania was part of the Vicariate Apostolic for Upper and Lower Saxony, before this merged into the Vicariate Apostolic of the North, then also comprising other Lutheran states. The affairs of the Roman Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Prussia had been reorganised by the Bull \\"De salute animarum\\", issued in 1821. By that time there were six new Catholic congregations in the Prussian Province of Pomerania, besides the above-mentioned three also one in Demmin, Stettin (est. 1809), and Stralsund (est. 1785). In the eastern, rather newer parts of the province, in the districts of B√ºtow and Lauenburg (Pommern), which had not been part of the Duchy of Pomerania during the Reformation, the Catholic faith had survived. These districts, however, belonged to the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Culm (until 1922). In 1821 the rest of Pomerania was disentangled from the Vicariate Apostolic of the North and subordinated to a new jurisdiction of the Diocese of Breslau. This jurisdiction was titled the Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania (, ), since Emanuel von Schimonsky was invested to Breslau's see under the new honorary rank of prince-bishop in 1824. The delegate resided in Berlin and served in personal union as provost of then St. Hedwig's Church. Breslau's Prince-Bishop Heinrich F√∂rster (1853‚Äì81) gave generous aid to the founding of churches, monastic institutions, and schools, especially in the diaspora regions. Pope Leo XIII appointed as his successor Robert Herzog (1882‚Äì86), till then Prince-Episcopal Delegate for Brandenburg and Pomerania. According to the Prussian Concordat of 1929 Pope Pius XI elevated the Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania to the Diocese of Berlin on August 13, 1930, becoming a suffragan of the Diocese of Breslau simultaneously elevated to archdiocese. So all of Pomerania became part of the Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province, with B√ºtow and Lauenburg being part of the new Territorial Prelature of Schneidem√ºhl ().  Infrastructure  Narrow gauge railway \\"R√ºgensche Kleinbahn\\", operating since 1895 Binz, tourist resort since the 1860s In the 19th century, the first overland routes (\\"Chaussee\\") and railways were introduced in Pomerania. In 1848, 126.8 Prussian miles of new streets had been built. On October 12, 1840, construction of the Berlin‚ÄìStettin railway began, which was finished on August 15, 1843. Other railways followed: Stettin-K√∂slin (1859), Angerm√ºnde-Stralsund and Z√ºssow-Wolgast (1863), Stettin- Stolp (1869), and a connection with Danzig (1870). In rural areas, many narrow-gauge railways were built for faster transport of crops. The first gas, water, and power plants were built. Streets and canalisation of the towns were modernized.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 447ff, . The construction of narrow-gauge railways was enhanced by a special decreeGesetz √ºber Klein- und Privatanschlu√übahnen. of July 28, 1892, implementing Prussian financial aid programs. In 1900, the total of narrow-gauge railways had passed the 1,000 kilometer threshold.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 464, . From 1910 to 1912, most of the province was supplied with electricity as the main lines were built. Plants were built since 1898.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 462, . The Swine and lower Oder rivers, the major water route to Stettin, were deepened to 5 meters and shortened by a canal (Kaiserfahrt) in 1862. In Stettin, heavy industry was settled, making it the only industrial center of the province.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 413ff, 447ff, . Stettin was connected to Berlin by the Berlin- Stettin waterway in 1914 after eight years of construction. The other traditional waterways and ports of the province however declined. Exceptions were only the port of Swinem√ºnde, which was used by the navy, the port of Stolpm√ºnde, from which parts of the Farther Pomeranian export was shipped, and the port of Sassnitz, built in 1895 for railway ferries to Scandinavia.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 465, 467, . With the infrastructural improvements, mass tourism to the Baltic coast started. The tourist resort (\\"Ostseebad\\") Binz had 80 visitors in 1870, 10,000 in 1900, and 22,000 in 1910. The same phenomenon occurred in other tourist resorts.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 465, .  Agricultural reform  Pomeranian Coarsewool Sheep. Pomerania was the leading Prussian province in sheep breeding.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 457, . Already in 1807, Prussia issued a decree (\\"Steinsches Oktoberedikt\\") abolishing serfdom. Hardenberg issued a decree on September 14, 1811, defining the terms by which serfs were to be released (\\"Hardenbergsches Regulierungsedikt\\"). This could either be done by monetary payment or by letting soil to the former lord. These reforms were applied during the early years of the province's existence. The so-called \\"regulation\\" was applied to 10,744 peasants until 1838, who paid their former lords 724,954 Taler and handed over 255,952 hectaresThis data (ha of farmland substitute for monetary payment) is marked in the source as referring to Regierungsbezirk Stettin and K√∂slin only; note that the Stralsund district with its Swedish law had a somewhat different standing. of farmland to bail themselves out.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 393ff, . Tumults arose in 1847 in the towns of Stettin and K√∂slin due to food shortages, as a result, prices for some foods were fixed.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 406, . On March 2, 1850, a law was passedTitled \\"Abl√∂sung der Reallasten und die Regulierung der gutsherrlichen und b√§uerlichen Verh√§ltnisse\\". settling the conditions on which peasants and farmers could capitalize their property rights and feudal service duties, and thus get a long-term credit (41 to 56 years to pay back). This law made way for the establishment of \\"Rentenbank\\" credit houses and \\"Rentengut\\" farms. Subsequently, the previous rural structure changed dramatically as farmers, who used this credit to bail out their feudal duties, were now able to self determine how to use their land (so-called \\"regulated\\" peasants and farmers, \\"regulierte Bauern\\"). This was not possible before, when the jurisdiction had sanctioned the use of farmland and feudal services according not to property rights, but to social status within rural communities and estates.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 416, . From 1891 to 1910, 4,731 \\"Rentengut\\" farms were set up, most (2,690) with a size of 10 to 25 hectares.  Bismarck era administrative reforms  Otto von Bismarck in 1873. Otto von Bismarck inherited from his father the Farther Pomeranian estates K√ºlz, Jarchelin and Kniephof. Aiming at a farming career, he studied agriculture at the academy in Greifswald-Eldena. From 1867 to 1874, he bought and expanded the Varzin estates.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 420ff, . In 1869, Friedrich Albrecht Graf zu Eulenburg drafted a county reform (\\"Kreisreform\\") that was promoted by Bismarck. The reform passed the House of Lords on December 7, 1872. Most important, the reform cut the linkage between noble status and the right to vote, the latter now depended on property (one had to be above a certain tax threshold) and not on status, aiming against the overrepresentation of the knights compared to burghers. On June 29, 1875, a new constitution for the province was passed (\\"Provinzialordnung\\"Full name: \\"Provinzialordnung f√ºr die Provinzen Preu√üen, Brandenburg, Pommern, Schlesien und Sachsen\\".), which entered into force in 1876. It redefined the responsibilities of the provincial administration (headed by the Oberpr√§sident) and the self-administrative institutions (\\"Provinzialverband\\", comprising the provincial parliament (\\"Provinziallandtag\\"), a \\"Landeshauptmann\\" (head) and a \\"Landesausschu√ü\\" (commission)). The Provinzialverband was financed directly from the Prussian state budget. The Landtag was responsible for streets, welfare, education, and culture. Landownership was not a criterion to become elected anymore. The provincial Landtag (Provinziallandtag) was elected by the county representative assemblies (\\"Kreistag\\" for counties, \\"Stadtverordnetenversammlung\\" for town districts) for a six years' term. A subordinate Kommunallandtag only existed for Regierungsbezirk Stralsund, until it was abolished in 1881.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 420ff, 450‚Äì453, . In 1891, a county reform was passed,\\"Landgemeindeordnung\\" for the eastern provinces of Prussia. allowing more communal self-government. Municipalities hence elected a \\"Gemeindevorstand\\" (head) and a \\"Gemeindevertretung\\" (communal parliament). Gutsbezirk districts, i.e. estates not included in counties, could be merged or dissolved.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 453, .  Effect of Treaty of Versailles on territorial size  In contrast to the provinces of West Prussia and East Prussia, the Peace Treaty of Versailles of 1919 had comparatively little influence on the territorial size of the province of Pomerania. In the framework of the treaty some parts of the eastern rural administrative districts of Landkreis B√ºtow, Landkreis Lauenburg and Landkreis Stolp, amounting to altogether 9,64 km¬≤, where in 1910 a population of 224 inhabitants had been counted, went lost to Poland.Der Gro√üe Brockhaus. 15th edition, vol. 14, Leipzig 1933, p. 741.  Administrative subdivisions  Until 1932, the province was subdivided into the government regions (Regierungsbezirk) K√∂slin (Eastern part, Farther Pomerania), Stettin (Southwestern part, Old Western Pomerania or Altvorpommern), and Stralsund (Northwestern part, New Western Pomerania or Neuvorpommern). The Stralsund region was merged into the Stettin region in 1932. The provincial capital was Stettin (now Szczecin), the Regierungsbezirk capitals were K√∂slin (now Koszalin), Stettin, and Stralsund, respectively. === Demographics of Province of Pomerania ===  Number on inhabitants in years  * 1905: 1,684,326 (56 per km¬≤), among them 1,616,550 Protestants, 50,206 Catholics, and 9,660 Jews.Der Gro√üe Brockhaus. 6th edition, vol. 16, Leipzig and Vienna 1909, p. 134. * 1925: 1,878,780'' Languages * 1900: The native language of the vast majority of the population was German; in the neighbourhood of the border to the Province of West Prussia there lived 14,162 persons using Polish as the language of communication, and (in the vicinity of the Leba Lake and of the Garde Lake) 310 persons whose mother tongue was Kashubian. === Province of West Prussia === From 1807‚Äì1813 during the Napoleonic Wars, southern parts of West Prussia were added to the Duchy of Warsaw, a Napoleonic client state. In 1815 the province, restored to the Kingdom of Prussia, was administratively subdivided into the Regierungsbezirke Danzig and Marienwerder. From 1829‚Äì1878 West Prussia was combined with East Prussia to form the Province of Prussia, after which they were reestablished as separate provinces. The region became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany.

Most of the German-Prussian province of West Prussia fell to Poland as the so-called Polish Corridor, and constituted the Pomeranian Voivodeship (wojew√≥dztwo pomorskie) with the capital at Toru≈Ñ (Thorn). The western remainder were merged into Posen-West Prussia in 1922, while the eastern remainder became part of Regierungsbezirk West Prussia within East Prussia. The Danzig (Gdansk) area was made the Free City of Danzig. === Polish Corridor === The Polish Corridor in 1923‚Äì1939 In the course of the reestablishment of the previously partitioned Polish state as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, the Polish corridor\\" was established from 70%BPB on Poland of the dissolved former province of West Prussia, comprising Pomerelian areas and the Chelmno (Kulmer) Land. It cut Germany off from her province of East Prussia while at the same time it allowed interwar Poland access to the Baltic Sea. Within Poland the corridor mostly constituted the Pomeranian Voivodeship (wojew√≥dztwo pomorskie). The term was first used by Polish politicians and came into international use.Hartmut Boockmann, Ostpreussen und Westpreussen, Siedler 2002, p. 401. After the seaport workers of the Free City of Danzig harbour went on strike throughout the Polish-Soviet War the Polish Government decided to build a new seaport at Gdynia (Gdingen) in the territory of the Corridor. A large part of the German population of the Polish Corridor left the area after its cession to the Second Polish Republic in June 1919. Poland took over complete control on January 20, 1920. Those people who wanted to stay in their hometowns had to take Polish citizenship, as Poland refused to accept German citizens living in its territory. Former public officials were not accepted as Polish citizens and had to leave the area. Other people, declining to give up German citizenship, had also to leave the Corridor.God‚Äôs Playground. A History of Poland. Bd. 2. 1795 to the Present. Oxford University Press, Oxford 2005. , . Due to the reduced population German schools were closed and property of former Germans residents was confiscated. Throughout the East Prussian plebiscite in July 1920 Polish authorities tried to prevent traffic through the Corridor, interrupting any postal, telegraphic and telephonic communication. On March 10, 1920, the British representative on the Marienwerder Plebiscite Commission, H.D. Beaumont, wrote of numerous continuing difficulties being made by Polish officials and added \\"as a result, the ill-will between Polish and German nationalities and the irritation due to Polish intolerance towards the German inhabitants in the Corridor (now under their rule), far worse than any former German intolerance of the Poles, are growing to such an extent that it is impossible to believe the present settlement (borders) can have any chance of being permanent.... It can confidently be asserted that not even the most attractive economic advantages would induce any German to vote Polish. If the frontier is unsatisfactory now, it will be far more so when it has to be drawn on this side (of the river) with no natural line to follow, cutting off Germany from the river bank and within a mile or so of Marienwerder, which is certain to vote German. I know of no similar frontier created by any treaty.\\"Butler, Rohan, MA., Bury, J.P.T.,MA., & Lambert M.E., MA., editors, Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919‚Äì1939, 1st Series, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1960, vol.x, Chapter VIII, \\"The Plebiscites in Allenstein and Marienwerder January 21, ‚Äì September 29, 1920\\", p. 726-7. Due to these difficulties, ongoing after the East Prussian Plebiscite ended with a significant German success, the German Ministry for Transport established the Seedienst Ostpreu√üen (\\"Sea Service East Prussia\\") in 1922 to provide a ferry connection to the German exclave of East Prussia, independent of transit through Polish territory.  Land reform  In 1925, the Polish government enacted a land reform program intended to redistribute land from large landowners to small farmers. Because German landowners generally owned the biggest tracts of land, they were the first to be affected. The Polish voivode, Wiktor Lamot, stressed that \\"the part of Pomorze through which the so-called Corridor runs must be cleansed of larger German holdings.\\" Because the German landholders who had remained in the Polish part of Pomerania resented their loss of status and the privileged position they had enjoyed before the land reform, they then became nationalistic and anti-Polish in their outlook.Grzegorz Gorski, \\"Polskie Panstwo Podziemne Na Pomorzu, 1939‚Äì1945\\", Library Foundation of the \\"Archives of the Pomeranian AK\\" in Torun, Torun, 1999  Ethnic composition  Most of the area was inhabited by Poles, Germans, and Kashubians. Since 1886, a Settlement Commission was set up by Prussia to enforce German settlementAndrzej Chwalba ‚Äì Historia Polski 1795‚Äì1918, p. 461. while at the same time Germans migrated west during the Ostflucht. In 1910 42,5% of the population was German (421,029 Germans) including German soldiers stationed in the area and public officials sent to administrate the area. In 1921 Germans counted 18,8% (175,771). Over the next decade, the German population decreased by another 70,000 to a share of 9,6%.Page 244 (Appendix B. German Population of Western Poland by Province and Country). Also, there was a Jewish minority. in 1905, Kashubians numbered about 72,500.Otto B√ºsch, Ilja Mieck, Wolfgang Neugebauer, Handbuch der preussischen Geschichte, p. 42. = Exodus of the German population = The Versailles treaty had stipulated that Germans in the part of German Reich territory to be ceded to Poland, the Polish Corridor, had until 1922 to make the choice for Polish or German citizenship. The book, Orphans of Versailles, states that as result of disloyalty of German citizens, who openly expressed their joy at Polish defeats in Polish-Soviet war, \\"Other places witnessed violent demonstrations against the minority; in Che≈Çmno/Culm, the Starost reportedly encouraged Poles, 'If a German or Jew dares to say anything against the Polish State, [to] tie him up and drag him through the streets to the starost's office or to the court.' Although the Versailles Treaty gave Germans until January 1922 to make their choice for Polish or German citizenship, many were compelled to declare right away, either for Germany (and expulsion) or for Poland and induction into the Polish army.\\" In one village, four Germans were killed in mob violence and numerous others arrested on basis of denunciations by Polish neighbors. In addition, the area was abandoned by numerous Germans (a number estimated at 10% of Germans) who were public officials and other workers with no ties to the province or military personnel (German garrisons were included in Prussian censuses as part of population). === Free City of Danzig === The Free City of Danzig included the major city of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) as well as Zoppot (Sopot), Tiegenhof (Nowy Dw√≥r Gda≈Ñski), Neuteich (Nowy Staw) and some 252 villages and 63 hamlets. Covering a total area of 1,966 square kilometers (754 sq mi), the territory was roughly twice the size of the Napoleonic statelet.  Polish rights declared by Treaty of Versailles  The Free City was to be represented abroad by Poland and forced to be in a customs union with it. The German railway line that connected the Free City with newly created Poland was to be administered by Poland. Similarly, the Westerplatte (until then a city beach), was also given to Poland, which created a military post within the city's harbour. There was also a separate Polish post-office established besides the existing municipal one.  League of Nations High Commissioners  Unlike mandated territories, which were entrusted to member countries, Danzig like the Territory of the Saar Basin remained under the authority of the League of Nations itself, with representatives of various countries taking on the role of High Commissioner:  Population  The Free City had a population of 357,000 (1919), 95% of whom were German-speakers,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Year Book, 1938. with the rest mainly speaking either Kashubian or Polish. The Treaty of Versailles, which had severed Danzig and surrounding villages from Germany, now required that the newly formed state had its own citizenship, based on residency. German inhabitants lost their German nationality with the creation of the Free City, but were given the right within the first two years of the state's existence to re-obtain it; however, if they did so they were required to leave their property and make their residence outside of the Free State of Danzig area in the remaining part of Germany. It became clear almost at once that the overwhelming German majority population of the Free State resented the concessions which had been made to Poland and their dismemberment from Germany. Professor Burckhardt, the League of Nations' High Commissioner in Danzig found, by 1939, his position as absolute arbiter in the endless disputes almost untenable. === Province of Pomerania === During the First World War, no battles took place in the province. Nevertheless, the war affected society, economy, and administration. During the war, the provincial administrative institutions were subordinate to the military and headed by military officials. Mobilization resulted in work force shortage affecting all non-war-related industry, construction, and agriculture. Women, minors and POWs partially replaced the drafted men. Import and fishing declined when the ports were blocked. With the war going on, food shortages occurred, especially in the winter of 1916/17. Also coal, gas, and electricity were at times unavailable.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.468, 469, . When the Treaty of Versailles entered into force on January 10, 1920, the province's eastern frontier became the border to the newly created Second Polish Republic, comprising most of Pomerelia in the so-called Polish Corridor. Minor border adjustments followed, where 9,5 km2 of the province became Polish and 74 km2 of former West Prussia (parts of the former counties of Neustadt in Westpreu√üen and Karthaus)Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 469, . were merged into the province.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 443ff, .  Province of the Free State of Prussia  After the Kaiser was forced to resign, the province became part of the Free State of Prussia within the Weimar Republic. = German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919 = During the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919, revolutionary councils of soldiers and workers took over the Pomeranian towns (Stralsund on November 9, Stettin, Greifswald, Pasewalk, Stargard, and Swinem√ºnde on November 10, Barth, B√ºtow, Neustettin, K√∂slin, and Stolp on November 11). On January 5, 1919, \\"Workers' and Soldiers' Councils\\" (\\"Arbeiter- und Soldatenr√§te\\") were in charge of most of the province (231 towns and rural municipalities). The revolution was peaceful, no riots are reported. The councils were led by Social Democrats, who cooperated with the provincial administration. Of the 21 Landrat officials, only five were replaced, while of the three heads of the government regions (\\"Regierungspr√§sident\\") two were replaced (in Stralsund and K√∂slin) in 1919.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 471, . On November 12, 1918, a decreeLandarbeiterverordnung. was issued allowing farmworkers' unions to negotiate with farmers (Junkers). The decree further regulated work time and wages for farmworkers.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 472, . On May 15, 1919, street fights and plunder occurred following Communist assemblies in Stettin. The revolt was put down by the military. In late August, strikes of farmworkers occurred in the counties of Neustettin and Belgard. The power of the councils however declined, only a few were left in the larger towns in 1920. = Counter-revolution = Conservative and right-wing groups evolved in opposition to the revolutions achievements.Junker Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin after the Kaiser's abdication assembled the workers of his estate and stated in disgrace: \\"As long as the king of Prussia is by injustice hindered in his government, I will function as his substitute in the Schmenzin estate\\" (Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 471, ). Landowners formed the Pommerscher Landbund in February 1919, which by 1921 had 120,000 members and from the beginning was supplied with arms by the 2nd army corps in Stettin. Paramilitias (\\"Einwohnerwehr\\") formed throughout the spring of 1919. Pommerscher Landbund units participated in the nationalist Kapp Putsch in Berlin, 1920. Members of the \\"Iron Division\\" (\\"Eiserne Division\\"), a dissolved Freikorps in the Baltic, reorganized in Pomerania, where the Junkers hosted them on their estates as a private army. Also, counter-revolutionary Pomeranians formed Freikorps participating in fights in the Ruhr area. = Constitution of 1920 = In 1920 (changed in 1921 and 1924), the Free State of Prussia adopted a democratic constitution for her provinces. The constitution granted a number of civil rights to the Prussian population and enhanced the self-government of the provinces. The provincial and county parliaments (Landtag and Kreistag) were hence elected directly by the population, including women, in free and secret votes. The \\"Provinzialverband\\", which included all self-governmental institutions of the province such as the provincial parliament (\\"Provinziallandtag\\"), gained influence on the formerly Berlin-led provincial government: The Provinzialverband would hence elect the \\"Oberpr√§sident\\" (head of the administration) and appoint representatives for the Reichsrat assembly in Berlin. Furthermore, the Provinzialverband officials could hence self determine how to spend the money they received from Berlin.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 472ff, . = Economy = The border changes however caused a severe decline in the province's economy. Farther Pomerania was cut off Danzig by the corridor. Former markets and supplies in the now Polish territories became unavailable. Farther Pomeranian farmers had sold their products primarily to the eastern provinces, that were now part of the Second Polish Republic. Due to high transport costs, the markets in the West were unavailable too. The farmers reacted by modernizing their equipment, improving the quality of their products, and applying new technical methods. As a consequence, more than half of the farmers were severely indebted in 1927. The government reacted with the Osthilfe program, and granted credits to favourable conditions.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 481, . Stettin particularly suffered from a post-war change in trade routes. Before the territorial changes, it had been on the export route from the Kattowitz industrial region in now Polish Upper Silesia. Poland changed this export route to a new inner-Polish railway connecting Kattowitz with the new-build port of Gdingen within the corridor. As a counter-measure, Prussia invested in the Stettin port since 1923. While initially successful, a new economical recession led to the closure of one of Stettin's major shipyard, Vulcan-Werft, in 1927.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 485, . The province also reacted to the availability of new traffic vehicles. Roads were developed due to the upcoming cars and buses, four towns got electric street cars, and an international airport was built in Altdamm near Stettin.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 485, The Pomeranian agriculture underwent a crisis. Programs were started to regain soil that had turned into swamps during the wartime, and even to establish new settlements by setting up settlement societies. The results were mixed. On the one hand, 130,858 hectare of farmland were settled with 8,734 new-build settlements\\"Ansiedlungen\\" based on the \\"Reichssiedlungsgesetz\\" (law) of 1919. until 1933. The settlers originated in Pomerania itself, Saxony and Thuringia, also refugees from the former Province of Posen\\"Fl√ºchtlinge aus Posen\\". settled in the province. On the other hand, people left the rural communities en masse and turned to Pomeranian and other urban centers (Landflucht). In 1925, 50.7% of the Pomeranians worked in agricultural professions, this percentage dropped to 38.2% in 1933.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp. 479ff, . With the economic recession, unemployment rates reached 12% in 1933, compared to an overall 19% in the empire.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 446, . ==References== 7 Category:1815 in Sweden Category:History of Prussia Category:Province of Pomerania (1815‚Äì1945) de:Geschichte Pommerns ","title":"History of Pomerania (1806‚Äì1933)"},{"id":"20460037","text":"Dantmara union () is a union of Bhujpur Thana of Chittagong District, Bangladesh.

Born to a proletarian family, at the age of fourteen she went to work for the phone company but her interest in Social Democratic politics got her fired. She worked in publishing and agitprop theatre, and became secretary of the party's Lehreverband (1930) and worked at the Rote Revue. In 1931, she took a diction class from Brecht's wife Helene Weigel and became his lover. She was introduced to the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, playing a maid in Die Mutter (1932). In 1933 Brecht and Weigel went into exile in Denmark. Though soon replaced as Brecht's lover by Ruth Berlau, Steffin entered an arranged marriage to a Danish citizen to stay as Brecht's secretary and followed the Brechts to Finland and Moscow when war broke out. She died from tuberculosis (diagnosed already in 1931) while awaiting an American visa. Brecht wrote six short poems on hearing of her death, eventually published together as Nach dem Tod meiner Mitarbeiterin M. S. The second reads: My general is fallen My soldier is fallen My pupil has left My teacher has left My nurse is gone My nursling is gone. Brecht's 1955 Collected Works names Steffin as the collaborator on Roundheads and Peakheads, Se√±ora Carrar's Rifles and The Horatians and the Curiatians. In addition Brecht acknowledged her role in Fear and Misery in the Third Reich, Life of Galileo and Mother Courage.letter to Erwin Piscator, 27 May 1940 She is also thought to have had a large hand in Mr Puntila and his Man Matti, The Good Person of Szechwan, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, and The Caucasian Chalk Circle.

The conference ran from Monday 20 April to Friday 24 April 2009, and took place at the United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland. The conference was called under the mandate of United Nations General Assembly resolution 61/149 (passed in 2006) with a mandate to review the implementation of The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action from the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance which took place in Durban, South Africa. The conference was boycotted by Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, and the United States. The Czech Republic discontinued its attendance on the first day, and twenty- three other European Union countries sent low-level delegations.

European countries also criticized the meeting for focusing on the West and ignoring problems of racism and intolerance in the developing world. Controversy surrounded the attendance of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the conference due to his past statements on Israel and the Holocaust. On the first day of the conference, Ahmadinejad, the only head of state to attend, made a speech condemning Israel as \\"totally racist\\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/04/21/2548003.htm and accusing the West of using the Holocaust as a \\"pretext\\" for aggression against Palestinians. The distributed English version of the speech referred to the Holocaust as an \\"ambiguous and dubious question\\". When Ahmadinejad began to speak about Israel, all the European Union delegates left the conference room, while a number of the remaining delegates applauded the Iranian President. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed dismay at both the boycotts and the speech. Durban III, a follow-up conference that took place on 22 September 2011 in New York City, was boycotted by the ten aforementioned countries (including the Czech Republic), along with Austria, Bulgaria, France and the United Kingdom. ==Committee== The Durban Review Conference was run by the Bureau of the Preparatory Committee, which was chaired by Ms. Najat Al-Hajjaji of Libya.
