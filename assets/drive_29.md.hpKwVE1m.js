The source of the river is in Ulverscroft, near Charnwood Forest. The river runs through Bradgate Park before the river runs into the River Soar in Quorn. The river also feeds Cropston Reservoir and Swithland Reservoir. The river runs for around 17 kilometres between its source and confluence with the River Soar. The river is described as one of Leicestershire's shortest rivers. == Course == The source of the river is at the head of the Ulverscroft Valley, where a number of small streams converge. At this point, the river is named locally as the Ulverscroft Brook. The source of the river is 163m above sea level. Freshwater from the brook was diverted to feed Lord Stamford's Pond. The Stamford family were major landowners in the area, owning the land which later became Bradgate Park. The river passed close by Ulverscroft Mill. Water from the river would also serve Ulverscroft Priory. Water from the river feeds into Cropston Reservoir. The river passes through the village of Newtown Linford and through the lower area of Bradgate Park. The river gives its name to Newtown Linford, with the village being named due to its location as a ford over the river Lin. The river continues downstream through Bradgate Park towards Swithland Woods. Beyond Swithland Woods, the river continues towards the River Soar, with the confluence with the River Soar towards the town of Quorn. == Wildlife == The river supports a number of habitats, and is described as a high quality watercourse. The river itself is a habitat for a number of species, including white-clawed crayfish and species of fish. The river also supports a number of other habitats, providing a source of water for communities of animals including the deer in the ancient deer park at Bradgate Park.

Born in Briton Ferry, Thomas worked in the office of a tinplate works from the age of fifteen, then became a tinplate finisher. He joined the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union, and served on its executive from 1914 until 1916. He was a member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) for many years, and served on its National Administrative Committee, representing the Wales Division, from 1914 until 1920. About one in twenty residents of the town were members of the Briton Ferry ILP, and this has been credited largely to Thomas' enthusiasm. Like the majority of the ILP, he opposed the war, and was personally prominent in the No Conscription Fellowship. He arranged anti-war speakers from across the UK to visit Briton Ferry, with at least twenty anti-war meetings each year from 1916 until 1918. In 1916, Thomas became the first Welsh organiser of the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), although he was keen to stress that the NCCL as a whole did not oppose the war.

Her work is heavily influenced by her extensive education that she received throughout her life. Many of her more notable performances juxtapose fantasy with reality, while her later paintings are abstract and minimalist. == Personal life == === Early life and education === The daughter of Venezuelan painter Mary Brandt, Ani was constantly surrounded and influenced by art of all kinds, including music, drama, and dance. During the 1970s, Ani travelled in order to further her education, attending the Andr√©s Bello Catholic University in Caracas, the University of Essex in England, and the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes in Paris, studying psychology, political science, and Taoism respectively. === Collaborations and influence === Villanueva's work, often consisting of multiple mediums, was greatly influenced by the artistic education she received during her upbringing. Villanueva's influences and collaborations went beyond Latin American artistic trends and styles. For example, Iguana, her collaboration with Carlos Villanueva and two British artists, incorporates elements from two distinctly different art styles and methodologies. == Early artistic career == Villanueva began her career after departing the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes, dancing with the Parisian group, Macrodanza, during 1981 and 1982. She moved on to artistic and performance pieces during this time as well. Unlike many other Latin American artists at the time, Villanueva did not express her political opinions or views through her art. At this time in her career, Villanueva had a stylistically notable usage of movement, choreography, and theatricality in her works, with many of her works utilizing the aforementioned elements to great artistic effect. === Early works === ==== Cuadro m√≥vil (1982) ==== Medium(s) used: Video, color, sound; Runtime: approximately 22 minutes One of Villanueva's initial public works, Cuadro m√≥vil or \\"Moving Picture\\", was a collaboration with her mother, Mary Brandt, and performed in Villanueva's hometown of Caracas at the Sala Mendoza. A painting ominously moves through various parts of an art gallery, crawling through various display rooms and caressing paintings while a foreboding melody discordantly plays in the background. This work contains horror elements, such as the disturbing, humanoid painting and unsettling background music. Many of Brandt's paintings spread through the gallery rooms are abstract collages of color. Boa (1986) ==== Boa (1986) ==== Medium(s) used: Video, color, sound; Runtime: approximately 18 minutes In this performance, Villanueva slithered around while painted in a serpentine print to the sounds and backdrop of a rainforest. A projection of a boa constrictor eventually descends on Villanueva, thus giving the audience the impression that she has become one with the indigenous flora and fauna. This performance is one of the few that Villanueva displayed internationally, at the Astoria Theater in London. === Early awards === In 1985, Villanueva and director Diego Barboza won the prize for non-objective art at the Sal√≥n Arturo Michelena for their collaboration, De la escuela de Atenas a la nueva escuela de Caracas (From the school of Athens to the new school of Caracas). == Later artistic career == Villanueva's art shifted from provocative performances to art that delves into the motifs of flora and fauna. She travelled to the coastal regions of Choron√≠, Venezuela and began drawing inspiration for her new art, later producing installations related to marine and coral ecosystems. Today, Villanueva focuses on abstract art. === Later works === ==== Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz (2002) ==== This performance was named after mid-to-late 17th century female philosopher and scholar Juana In√©s de la Cruz and was performed at the Miami Art Museum. In this performance, Villanueva dresses and acts as the aforementioned de la Cruz. ==== Casos de Cosas (2004) ==== Casos de Cosas, literally translated into English as \\"cases of things\\", is an assemblage that incorporates six pack rings for soda cans held together by zip ties. This piece was part of her focus on marine and coral ecosystems, as well as an incorporation of her training in mixed media art. === Later awards === In 2005, Villanueva won first prize at the 8th Bienal Nacional de Escultura Francisco Narvaez (or the 8th Francisco Narvaez National Sculpture Biennial), an event in which artists submit sculptures or other installations for competition. == Collections == Many of Villanueva's notable works are not in museums or galleries today, as many of Villanueva's works incorporated mixed mediums and performance art. Villanueva's more recent abstract works are displayed in various museums across Venezuela. == References == == Bibliography == Guanipa, Moraima. \\"El acuario personal de Ani Villanueva.\\" El Universal (Caracas), October 21, 1994.

Nugent won the 39th Ward general runoff election on April 2, 2019, after advancing from the general election on February 26, 2019. ==Positions== Education Alderman Nugent acknowledges the Chicago Public School system's decreasing enrollment, however she believes the problem is larger than the school system itself. What has caused the enrollment's decrease is the poverty, violence, and inequality that the City of Chicago faces. So Nugent believes any \\"effective anti-violence strategy must include a long-term commitment to eliminating inequity and paving a pathway to opportunity.\\" With a flourishing community, Nugent believes people will be attracted to live, work, and attend school in the City of Chicago. Crime Alderman Nugent understands the interrelation of poverty, violence, and trauma so she believes investment in communities and working with anti-violence groups can and will reduce crime. Nugent also believes trust between police officers and their communities needs to be expanded. Public Safety Additionally, Alderman Nugent acknowledges that safety is a concern of many residents. So in office, Nugent strives to bring more public safety resources to the 39th Ward through collaboration with the Chicago Police Department and Fire Department. This collaboration enables the departments to be well resourced so that the safety of the community is ensured. Growth and Development Alderman Nugent also recognizes that the City of Chicago is in need of revenue and that Chicago residents can ill afford additional taxes. To mend these two issues, Nugent supports a Chicago casino, legalizing and taxing marijuana, sports betting, and video gambling. Additionally, Nugent is open to a real estate transfer tax over (at least) $1 million. Notably, she is opposed to regressive taxes since these taxes hurt those who can least afford it. Instead, Nugent recognizes that tax increment financing (TIFs) can be a great tool for economic development. Before utilizing TIFs, Nugent believes they need to be reformed. Firstly, there needs to be the ability to sunset TIFs earlier than 23 years. Additionally, Nugent holds the balances of the TIF accounts need to be more transparent so there is a greater understanding of how TIF money is spent. Lastly, Nugent seeks ways in which we could transfer excess TIF money into schools and parks so that residential real estate taxes can be lowered. ==Previous Political Experience== Previously, Nugent served as the Director of Executive Engagement for the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). As director, Nugent worked with stakeholders to ensure physicians meet Board Certification standards. Prior to this, Nugent served as the Chief of Staff for the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM). As chief of staff, Nugent worked with partners across government, business, and non-profit sectors to develop programs to help prepare for and respond to natural and man-made disasters. Additionally, Nugent worked as the Government Affairs Manager for W.W. Grainger where she created outreach campaigns and worked alongside government to facilitate emergency preparedness. Nugent also served as the Vice-Counsel for Political, Press and Public Affairs for the British Consulate. In this position, she served as the conduit between U.S. and UK leaders. ==Education== Samantha Nugent received her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of Connecticut and her Juris Doctor from the Loyola University of Chicago School of Law. ==See also== *List of Chicago aldermen since 1923 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1977 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Chicago City Council members Category:Illinois Democrats Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Women city councillors in the United States Category:Women in Illinois politics ","title":"Samantha Nugent"},{"id":"60405543","text":"Aizer is a surname.

He helped establish the London Marathon, with Chris Brasher. == Early and personal life == Bryant was born on 25 April 1944 and grew up in the village of Haselbury Plunknett in Somerset. He attended Sexey's School in Bruton. He studied law at Queen's College, Oxford where he was an Oxford Blue. Bryant was described as a reluctant interviewee, and quietly spoken, by those around him. He resided in Kingston upon Thames. == Athletics career == Bryant was a county running champion and since then entered coaching ‚Äì he coached, among others, Olympic athlete Zola Budd, accompanying her to the 1984 Olympics. In the 1950s, he was closely involved with major players in achieving the four-minute mile, and developed a relationship with Roger Bannister.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. ==History== The village of Homer was founded in 1832 when Milton Barney of Lyons, New York purchased land here and constructed a saw mill. Barney hired Oshea Wilder to plat a village along what was then the Territorial road (now M-60). The original village plat was between Platt, Burgess, Burt, and Byron Streets. A commercial district sprang up along Main Street, particularly around the public square, where Barney built a hotel. The area around Homer gradually became settled by farmers, and by 1856, the village had a population of about 350 people. In 1869/70, a rail line was built through the village, and two more lines were built through Homer in the next 15 years, making the village a transportation hum for the area. A fire in 1876 destroyed nearly all the frame commercial buildings in the downtown area, and subsequent structures were constructed of brick or other fireproof materials. The population was nearly 2000 people by 1890. Construction of new commercial and residential structures to serve this population continued into the 20th century. However, the rise of the automobile affected the village's economy, and growth slowed. The onset of the Great Depression exacerbated the slowdown. The village maintained a population of about 1200 people since that time, limiting additional growth. ==Description== The Homer Village Historic District contains much of the original plat of the village of Homer, including the two-block core commercial area, with the surrounding residential areas. The district contain 210 buildings and structures, 188 of which contribute to the historic nature of the district. The commercial section is substantially two-story brick commercial buildings. The most distinctive building is the three-story Lyon block. A public square is located at the western end of the commercial district, and the Cortright-Van Patten Mill formerly stood at the other end. The surrounding residential areas contain a mix of brick and frame houses on large lots along tree-lined streets. Architectural styles include Greek Revival, Italianate, and Queen Anne, along with simpler vernacular versions of the styles. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:Greek Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Italianate architecture in Michigan Category:Queen Anne architecture in Michigan ","title":"Homer Village Historic District"},{"id":"60405649","text":"David C. Fajgenbaum (born March 29, 1985) is an American immunologist and author who is currently an assistant professor at the Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania.

Like his east coast counterpart Richard Henry Pratt, Wilkinson was an assimilationist who believed that forced education was a solution to the ‚ÄúIndian question.‚Äù == Early life == Melville Cary Wilkinson was born in Scottsburg, New York, on November 14, 1835. He worked during his early years in the mercantile and railroad businesses. At the onset of the Civil War, Wilkinson enlisted in the Union army, and was promoted to lieutenant and captain of the 107th New York Volunteer Infantry. == Military and educational career == During the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, Wilkinson was injured and forced to serve the remainder of the war as an officer in the Veterans Reserve Corps. === Howard University === After the war, Wilkinson decided to turn to teaching. For a year he taught military science at Howard University, and then was appointed as an aide-de- camp to Major General Oliver Otis Howard‚Äì‚Äìthen President of Howard University and the Commissioner of the Freedman‚Äôs Bureau. It was during this time when Wilkinson made his first significant contribution to Indian education. While Howard University‚Äôs main focus at the time was to educate freed slaves, Wilkinson argued that there should also be an opportunity for Indians to attend the college. In 1872, Wilkinson spent a year with General Howard in the Southwest, helping to resolve problems with the Apache tribe. Between 1871 and 1875, Howard successfully enrolled several Indian children. This was an early milestone for the creation of off-reservation boarding schools, which Wilkinson would later be a part of. === Participation in Indian removal === In 1873, Wilkinson was present for the removal of the Modoc tribe from Fort McPherson, to Indian territory. Additionally, he participated in the Nez Perce War in 1877. ==== Paiute-Bannock War, 1878 ==== In 1878, Wilkinson was in the command of a gunboat near Wallula on the Columbia River. There, where his men were armed with guns and muskets, he ordered them to fire on a group of non- combatant Palouse Indians -- men, women, and children. The scene was so grotesque and horrifying that one eyewitness reported that, Wilkinson, after taking control of the field piece himself, unleashed a stream of bullets that when he was done, the Indians lay on the ground in all directions. Within several weeks of this incident, Wilkinson had taken a leave of absence and was in search of a new career. === Later career === In March 1879, Wilkinson moved to Washington, D.C. There, he befriended Richard Pratt, who shared similar views about Indian assimilation, specifically that a military solution was not the answer. In Washington, the two men successfully lobbied Secretary of Interior, Carl Shurz, Secretary of War George W. McCrary, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Ezra A. Hayt, who agreed to establish two off-reservation boarding schools. Two months later, the federal government had given its approval for Forest Grove Indian school in Oregon, and Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Under an 1886 Act of Congress, Wilkinson was named the superintendent of Forest Grove. This gave the President the authority to appoint army officers as military instructors and professors. Forest Grove Indian School, 1882 == Forest Grove Indian Training School == Wilkinson was an ardent assimilationist. United States Indian Policy shifted in the late 1870s from one of separation on reservations to one of assimilation. By 1880, the United States government had overtaken the Indians, and tribal sovereignty was no more. Students would now be forced to attend either day schools or boarding schools, many of which would be far from their homes. Wilkinson, like other reformers, wanted to prepare Native American children for assimilation into white society. Forest Grove was the second off-reservation school to be established by the U.S. government, and was structured similarly to that of the Carlisle School, established by Richard Pratt. === The Beginning of Forest Grove === After Forest Grove was approved in 1879, Wilkinson brought his first group of Native American children to the school from the Puyallup Reservation in Washington. The children themselves constructed the first school buildings. Wilkinson had extreme difficulty accumulating funding for his school. While he was originally given $5000 in funding, he was unable to accumulate any significant amount, most likely due to the unpopularity of the school in the surrounding areas. === Students and families === While Wilkinson was described as having a strong personality, he was also described as being erratic and unpredictable in his methods, which caused him to gain extremely harsh criticism. Because of his philosophical views about the boarding school education, Wilkinson went to great lengths to prevent students from contacting their parents. While he made the effort to correspond with the children‚Äôs parents and tribal chiefs to assure them that they were safe, he would not allow the children to contact their families themselves. Additionally, he would often remove Indian children from reservations, taking them to Forest Grove against the will of their parents, and often the children themselves. Upon the death of students at the school, Wilkinson alone where and how the children would be buried, with complete disregard to the wishes of the students‚Äô families. === Discipline === Discipline was modeled after army discipline; boys and girls were divided into groups based on gender, with four sergeants in charge of each group. One student described that everything was ‚Äúcarried on with military precision,‚Äù referencing the bell that was rung to signal the beginning and end of tasks and activities. Wilkinson used these military drills to promote the school‚Äì‚Äìall visitors would automatically be given a parade of military drills. === Removal === Wilkinson‚Äôs conduct earned him considerable criticism. While he was able to keep attendance high at Forest Grove because of his forcible recruitments, death and desertion continued to lower the attendance numbers. By 1883, Wilkinson was removed from superintendent of the school after an unfavorable report was submitted by a U.S. Indian inspector, when one of the school buildings was burned down by students. As a result, the United States government refused to extend Wilkinson‚Äôs leave from the army. Even his old friend, Richard Pratt, was unsympathetic, going to show just how much of a liability Wilkinson really was. == Death == Wilkinson was killed in the Battle of Sugar Point, a skirmish with a small group of Chippewa Indians. == References == Category:People from Salem, Oregon Category:1835 births Category:1898 deaths Category:Howard University faculty Category:Union Army officers Category:People from Livingston County, New York ","title":"Melville Wilkinson"},{"id":"60405668","text":"Constantin Bu»ôoiu (born 3 June 1941) is a Romanian wrestler.

Since 1955, the NKFM has carried out a mission to prevent kidney disease and improve the quality of life for those living with it. The nonprofit is based in Ann Arbor and has three additional statewide branches in Flint, Grand Rapids and Detroit. The charity has received 11 consecutive 4-star ratings from Charity Navigator, the nation's leading charity evaluator. == History and Mission == The NKFM was established as an affiliate of the National Kidney Foundation in 1955. Its mission is: ‚ÄúTo prevent kidney disease and improve the quality of life for those living with it.‚Äù Through legislative and program-based efforts, the organization seeks to prevent three major causes of kidney disease including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. The NKFM is the largest affiliate of the National Kidney Foundation and offers more programs and services to more people than any other region or state. In 2016, the Detroit branch opened a new office in the Henry Ford Medical Center - Detroit Northwest from a smaller office based in Detroit. In 2018, the Grand Rapids branch relocated their office to a larger space owned by the Breton Associates. In 2017, the charity spent over $5.5 million, with 86.7% of program expenses directed toward public education, 3.7% toward patient services, and 5.3% toward community services. == Education Outreach == Each year, the organization spends a significant portion of their program expenses on education and educational initiatives. In 2017, 86.7% of their expenses were directed toward public education. The NKFM has directed educational outreach initiatives and programs surrounding topics such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes prevention, nutrition education for children, general physical activity, and gestational diabetes. Since 2012, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has served more than 1,550 people by encouraging an active lifestyle and educating them about prevention of diabetes through nutrition. Through lifestyle changes, clients have lost, on average, 6 percent of their body weight and have been physically active for an average of almost 190 minutes per week. The program starts with 16 weekly meetings, during which participants learn healthy nutrition practices. For the rest of the year, the class meets monthly. Starting in 2016, the NKFM's Diabetes Prevention Program pre-diabetes class was one of five diabetes prevention programs in Michigan that was approved and covered by Medicare. In 2017, the NKFM published a new book, titled ‚ÄúRegie‚Äôs Rainbow Adventure: National Kidney Foundation of Michigan‚Äôs nutrition education program for disease prevention in the early childcare setting.‚Äù The book features Regie, a broccoli superhero, who acts as the face for the Regie program that served 24,000 children in Southeast Michigan in nutrition and physical activity education. During the early stages of 2018, roughly 1,200 adults 50 and older attended health workshops sponsored by the NKFM NKFM including the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), Personal Action toward Health (PATH) and Diabetes PATH. == Projects and Activities == The organization's activities focus on awareness, prevention and treatment. Initiatives include public and professional education, kidney health screenings, research, and patient services. According to the group, almost 90% of fundraising dollars goes into programs and services aimed at preventing kidney disease. The NKFM hosts several fundraising events each year including Kidney Walks and two Kidney Balls held in Detroit and Grand Rapids. In December 2018, the event raised over $420,000 through a silent auction, live auction and donations at the Westin Book Cadillac Detroit. Since 1976, the NKFM has hosted an annual Kids Camp in Fenton, Michigan at Camp Copneconic. During a traditional weekly camp session, the NKFM provides medical support necessary to allow kids with kidney disease ages 8‚Äì16 to attend the camp alongside other campers. The foundation enlists a team of Michigan-based nurses and doctors to assist the roughly 30 campers throughout the week. The foundation also provides financial support for children interested in attending the camp. The children are all kidney patients and come from one of three hospitals in the state ‚Äî Children's Hospital at the DMC in Detroit, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor and the Helen DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids. Nearly 950 children attended the camp as of 2016. == Governance == Dan Carney served as the president and CEO of the NKFM for over 30 years until 2017, when he was succeeded by Linda Smith-Wheelock. Smith-Wheelock served as the nonprofit's Chief Operating Officer for 17 years before being awarded the position, which she still holds. Carney remains on the board of directors after stepping down into a new role as President and CEO Emeritus. == Awards == Every year since 2006, the NKFM has received 4-star ratings from Charity Navigator, who named the NKFM the number 1 charity in the category of Diseases, Disorders & Disciplines in 2014. The same year, the Huffington Post named the NKFM as one of the top 11 charities that changed the world. In 2015, the Michigan Association of Health Plans recognized NKFM for ‚ÄúBusiness Practice Improvement‚Äù through their diabetes prevention program during the 15th Annual Pinnacle Awards. In 2015, the organization was awarded a $20,000 ‚ÄúFoundation Champions for Healthy Kids‚Äù grant from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The grant aimed to improve children's health and wellness by working to prevent or delay the onset of preventable diseases through the implementation of the Project for EArly Childhood Health (PEACH) program in southeast Michigan. == References == ==External links== * National Kidney Foundation Website * National Kidney Foundation of Michigan Website * American Journal of Kidney Disease Category:Charities based in Michigan Category:Kidney diseases ","title":"National Kidney Foundation of Michigan"},{"id":"60405684","text":"Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs is an anime series adapted from the manga of the same title by Tadahiro Miura.

She was born in Havana, Cuba and immigrated to the United States in 1961. Her early work stressed her Cuban roots with the use of Catholic and Renaissance icons while more recent projects have been installation and community-based. ==Biography== Castagliola was born in Havana, Cuba in 1946, but moved to Los Palos when nine years old. She immigrated to Miami in the United States in 1961 at the age of fourteen, separating herself from her parents. Castagliola has a B.A. degree in sociology plus B.F.A and M.F.A degrees from the University of South Florida and has taught art, as an assistant professor, at the same university. Castagliola now lives in St. Petersburg, Florida where she is a practicing artist. Castagliola came to art after a background in social services and religion. She is now considered one of the most thoughtful and respected Bay area artists. She has a collection of paintings, drawings, and a few mixed media projects that demonstrate her passion for Spanish literacy traditions. Her early work synthesized her Cuban roots with Catholic and Renaissance icons, but she also tried to incorporate personal things in her artwork. She then moved on towards installation and community-based projects. Castagliola discusses that it is within her work that we can see and comprehend her bicultural dichotomy. She focuses her artwork on Latin American traditions and incorporates Spanish and religious icons that were present or significant in her childhood. Maria Emilia Castagliola considers herself to be an \\"outsider\\" even though she works in the mainstream. == Artworks == === A Matter of Trust (1994) === A Matter of Trust is an artwork that was created by Castagliola in 1994. She arranged ordinary paper envelopes in quilt patterns of triangles, rectangles, and squares in order to create an artwork that represented intimacy and trust. Castagliolas's friends and family members provided her with their deepest personal secrets , and she then sewed them shut inside the envelope. She felt that it allowed others to share everything and trust that there would be support and understanding. She started this piece with the intention of never opening the envelopes which contained the secrets inside. In order to do this, she sealed the quilt between sheets of fiberglass window screen. This artwork was created with a paper on fiberglass screen with cotton thread. This is classified as a sculpture. Castagliola tends to mainly use dark colors such as gray and black on all her artworks, and this piece was not an exception. === The Birthing Album (1994) === This piece was created by graphite on paper sewn to wool; steel wire. It seems to represents a pregnant female's body and some have also interpreted it as life or birth. This work is classified as both a sculpture and an assemblage since it puts many distinct things together. The color on this piece are simply gray, black, white, and brown. === Martini Pink (1946) === This is a pop art serigraph that demonstrates a nude woman in pink, with pink elephants at the top and the bottom. This may be considered a self-portrait. The image can bebportrayed as something feminine simply because of its color. This piece is sold from one hundred to two hundred dollars. === Senos de duro ensano (\\"Bodice of the Moon\\") === Castagliola collaborated with Lorca by using the poets words and titles as \\"verbal launch pads\\" One of her works \\"Senos de duro ensano\\" represented the idea of moon and death. She incorporated symbols from Lorca's writing as well. Once she finished the piece, she realized that it represented her own psychological state of mind. == Exhibitions == *Tampa Museum of Art, Florida, solo exhibition.

The company was founded in 2014 by CEO Dan Teran as a management platform including vendors for cleaning and maintenance services. In 2017 the company launched their marketplace which expanded their services to include IT support, inventory management, administrative staffing, and security. Managed by Q was operating as an independently run business as part of shared workspace provider WeWork, and has offices in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Boston. On March 3, 2020, Eden bought the New York City-based Managed by Q from WeWork for an undisclosed price in a deal according to Eden CEO and co-founder Joe Du Bey. The company also closed on a $29 million Series B1 round, led by JLL, to help fund the purchase. ==History== Managed by Q launched out of beta in New York City in 2015, expanding to Chicago. Later in 2015, the company raised $15 million in Series A funding and expanded to San Francisco. The round was led by RRE Ventures; other investors included entrepreneurs Gary Vaynerchuk and Fabrice Grinda, American actress Jessica Alba, and former NBA commissioner David Stern. In 2016, the company raised $25 million in funding. Investors included Google Ventures (GV) and Kapor Capital. Following another fundraising round that increased to $30 million, M. G. Siegler of GV joined Managed by Q's board. Later in 2016, the company partnered with office supply retailer Staples Inc. Also that year, the company expanded to Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In 2016, Managed by Q announced its \\"Operator Stock Option Program\\", which, in addition to previously provided benefits such as 401(k) funds and health insurance, would provide stock option grants to field staff. U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez attended the announcement and commended the company. MIT Sloan conducted a case study in 2016 on Managed by Q's growth strategies. The study identified growth strategies employed by the company that were comparable to elements in \\"The Good Jobs Strategy\\", a book written by MIT Adjunct Associate Professor Zeynep Ton. The book's thesis argues that \\"when a company deploys its workforce in smart ways, its workers can be a driver of profit rather than a driver of cost.\\" In 2017, Managed by Q launched a marketplace platform accessible by customers and workers which expanded their services to include IT support, inventory management, administrative staffing, and security, along with standard cleaning and maintenance. Later in 2017, Managed by Q acquired the task management software provider Hivy. In 2018, Managed by Q launched in Boston. Later that year the company acquired NVS, an office space planning and management service. In January 2019, Managed by Q announced they had raised an additional $55 million as part of their Series C funding round. Investors included GV once again as well as RRE.

It is situated seven kilometers southwest of the City of Winnipeg, between Manitoba Highway (PTH) 3's intersections with PTH 100 (Perimeter Highway) and PTH 2. The community has a population of 1,051 as of the Canada 2016 census Oak Bluff overlaps the Central Plains and Winnipeg Metro Regions. It is not part of the smaller Winnipeg census metropolitan area. ==History== The Oak Bluff area was settled by British and Scottish settlers in the 1870s. Rail service arrived in the community in 1901 and a grain elevator was established soon after to serve the mainly agricultural area. Winnipeg's Perimeter Highway was constructed on the east side of the community in the 1950s, which greatly increased traffic through the area, as the highway is now part of the Trans-Canada Highway highway system. From 1960 to 1972, Oak Bluff was part of a region controlled by the City of Winnipeg under the Metropolitan Winnipeg Act, which led to commercial and industrial development in the area. Between 2011 and 2016, the community's population increased from 581 to 1,051, the second largest percentage increase (80.9%) of any community in Manitoba. ==Education== Oak Bluff's first school was constructed in 1889 and later replaced with new buildings in 1913, 1930, and more recently in the 1990s. The current Oak Bluff school houses students from Kindergarten to grade eight and is part of the Red River Valley School Division (formerly the Morris-MacDonald School Division). After the eighth grade, students attend the high school in nearby Sanford. ==Sports and recreation== Oak Bluff's indoor arena is one of five that serve the municipality. The community does not have its own youth ice hockey teams, rather it participates in the MacDonald minor hockey program that includes all communities in the municipality. Oak Bluff's recreation grounds also feature baseball diamonds and soccer pitches. Situated between Oak Bluff and Winnipeg is The Rink Training Centre (TRTC), a privately-owned arena and training complex that houses the Rink Hockey Academy and a high performance ice hockey clinic.. TRTC is also home to the Winnipeg Blues and Winnipeg Freeze of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League. A 4,000-seat arena, adjacent to TRTC, is currently under development, which will be the future home to the Winnipeg Ice of the Western Hockey League. ==See also== *List of communities in Manitoba by population ==References== ==External links== *Community Profile Category:Unincorporated communities in Manitoba ","title":"Oak Bluff, Manitoba"},{"id":"60406048","text":"C√©sar Solari (born 2 November 1946) is an Ecuadorian wrestler.

Reyes was consider the \\"godmother\\" of Latin American art for the portrayals of life struggles in her paintings. She was encouraged to write by Gabriel Garcia Marquez who's a Colombian writer. Those who knew her paintings described them as very old and very few. Reyes is known for her book The Book of Emma Reyes: A Memoir. == Biography == Emma Reyes was born in 1919 in Bogota, Colombia. Reyes died on July 12, 2003 at the age of 84. Much of her artwork draws on her life and the obstacles that she faced from living in poverty. She lived with her mother, sister, and a boy who she never knew his name. When she was bout 6 or 7 years old her mother abandoned her. Reyes was then taken to a convent along with her sister and escaped later. After she escaped the convent she reached Argentina where she began to paint. While at the convent, Reyes was not allowed to socialize with the outside world until the age of 19 which was the time of her escape. Reyes got married and had a child. Unfortunately her child was killed when a group of evil men invaded her home during a war in the economy. From there, Reyes flee to France, Paris to escape her sorrowful life of poverty and began her life of painting. == Career == Despite the cruelty Reyes experienced in her childhood, she still tries to send positive messages through her works by making her works colorful and mainly associated with animals and plants. She didn't get an education and therefore, was \\"illiterate.\\" As the result of her having no education, she instead write letters and put them together as a book. She was mainly known for her writing rather than her paintings. Reyes writes her letters from the perspective of the time she was living in rather than from her perspective now. == Works == A lot of her paintings didn't have a name and instead were called by what was visible. The image itself said it all. Most of her early works was a representation of the life she had left behind. \\"Unknown (Goat)\\" Reyes utilized vibrant colors and painted mainly plants and animals. Her goal was to use vibrant colors in order to represent her lively personality. Her paintings such as this one, was done by color pencils and a board. The background of this painting is a pastel yellow with pastel green grass while there's a white cow drinking milk from a blue bucket. \\"Figurine\\" This painting portrays a human figure build from garbage that implies children's imagination, but then destroyed by the evil in this world. \\"Burning Villages\\" In this painting Reyes intended to show loneliness in a town that's corrupted surrounded by economy issues, cruelty, and abandonment. It represents the struggle Reyes and her sister faced. == Collections== Most of Emma Reyes works are held in the Essex Collection of Art from Latin America which is an organization where people can make donations. Her work is also preserved at the Perigord Museum of Art and Archaeology. == Honors == Reyes began her painting career in 1943 when she received a scholarship to study in Paris. That's when doors opened for her and as an individual who came from nothing she took advantage of the opportunity. Not only did she take the opportunity to do what she enjoys, but also as mentioned before to live a better life than the one she had during her childhood. == Publications == Before publishing her book The Book of Emma Reyes: A Memoir, Reyes didn't want any changes in her grammar. Since she didn't get an education, the errors in her writing represent the struggle she went through writing the book and in addition relating to the struggles she survived in her childhood such as poverty. The book consist of 23 letters as the only format she was capable of writing. The dates of the letters start from 1969- 1997. It was known that Reyes had a difficult time organizing her thoughts when it came to writing. Luckily, her solution was writing letters. The first letter of the book opens up with the most obvious, her childhood from there leading to her life. == Bibliography == * Fajardo-Hill, Cecilia, et al.

This practice gained popularity in the mid-1980s to early 1990s in South Korea, where selective female abortions were commonplace as male children were preferred. Historically, much of Korea's values and traditions were based on Confucianism that dictated the patriarchal system, motivating the preference for sons over daughters. Additionally, even though the abortion ban existed, the combination of son preference and availability of sex-selective technology led to an increasing number of sex-selective abortions and boys born. As a result, South Korea experienced drastically high sex ratios around mid-1980s to early 1980s. However, in recent years, with the changes in family policies and modernization, attitudes towards son preference have changed, normalizing the sex ratio and lowering the number of sex-selective abortions. With that being said, there has been no explicit data on the number of induced sex selective abortions reportedly performed due to the abortion ban and controversiality surrounding the topic. Therefore, scholars have been continuously analyzing and generating connections among sex-selection, abortion policies, gender discrimination, and other cultural factors. ==Reasons for sex-selective abortions== ===Cultural preference=== During mid- Yi dynasty, confucianism greatly influenced traditions and values in South Korea. Confucianism emphasizes respecting elders and upholds the traditional idea of the father to be the head of the household and bear the responsibilities of taking care of the family. Thus, this began the tradition of a patriarchal family lineage. In Korea, there is a popular saying, samjongjido, which translate to the idea that women follow three people in their lives: her father, her husband, and her son. As a result, women were often pressured by their family members and in-laws to give birth to sons that will take care of the family in the future and continue the family bloodline as daughters typically end up marrying into different families, with less of an opportunity to take care of her own parents. This corresponds to another famous saying, cheolgawein meaning when a girl marries, she becomes an outsider to her biological family. Additionally, she remains an outsider to her husband's family as well until she bears a son. Historically, when an emperor's wife did not bear the royal family a son, the emperor took on more concubines to increase the chances of producing a son. Thus, this marginalization of women into these subordinate roles with increased pressure to reproduce and give birth to sons perpetuated gender discrimination and son preference, ultimately leading to an increase in female selective abortions in South Korea during the mid-1980s. These cultural preferences continue to affect South Korean families years after the influence of confucianism. In 1999, surveys have shown that 78% of Korean men and 70% of Korean women felt that having a son is necessary and desirable. While the rate of sex-selective abortions have slowed down after mid-1990s, gender discrimination and desire for sons prevailed. With that being said, with modernization, a series of law changes, and influence of western values in the early 2000s, attitudes towards traditional beliefs loosened. Younger generations were displaying more interest and preference for daughters for greater emotional connections, resulting in less prevalent sex-selective abortions and normalizing sex ratios. ===Population control policy and family law=== In 1948, abortion was prohibited by law and critically observed. Later in 1961, South Korea implemented a population control policy, in hopes of curtailing the growing population and decreasing unwanted pregnancies. The government campaigned this through slogans promoting small families and decrease in poverty rates. However, with the criminalization of abortion, many women turned to induced abortions. Despite the legalities, clinics that performed abortions were prevalent throughout the country. Thus, the availability of abortions, with the combination of motivation from the government to have fewer children and traditional patriarchal lineage preferences, many families opted to have sons rather than daughters. Family registries in South Korea adopted the Hojuje (male headship system) until 2005. Any son or daughter that is born to a family, was listed under the father in the family registry. As a result, children born to single, unmarried mothers were often pressured to be listed under a male relative in order to have a place in the official family registry or risk being unlisted. For that reason, many families would rather have a son to indefinitely continue the family line than a daughter who might not hold that power. This changed in 2005 when the mandatory patrilineal lineage system was abolished, loosening the need for a son in the family. The sex of the child did not make such a pertinent impact on the succession of the family now and this contributed to the normalizing sex ratio and decrease in pressure for women to bear sons. ==Human birth sex ratio== The increase in sex-selective abortions led to a distorted human sex ratio, that shot up to 108.6 in 1985 and 112.5 in 1990. These distortions had significant social and cultural effects on the demographics of South Korea. It is important to note that infant and child mortality may have had an effect on the high sex ration but the data is not significant enough to label it as a reliable reason for the high sex ratio as there were very few (9.9 in 1000 births in 1985) reported. ===Regional differences=== Although, these distortions varied across different cities and provinces. High sex ratio was more common in the south-eastern part of the Korean peninsula. Youngnam, while less so in the south-western part of the peninsula, Honam. Reasons for this may be that Youngnam has fewer Protestant and Catholic churches, which are generally pro-life, and has a long history of conservative cultural traditions. On the other hand, Honam is poor in terms of economic prosperity and political power compared to Youngnam, thus more likely to accept western values and new ideology. The author emphasizes that the religion of a given region is a factor in sex-selective abortions in South Korea. Buddhism is more similar to Confucianism and study showed that Buddhism is positively associated with the sex ratio at birth. However, later data depicts weaker effects of religion on sex ratio after 2000, with an overall decrease in sex ratio as well. Additionally, around 1985, sex ratios at birth rose sharply, particularly in Taegu and Pusan cities. The rural areas around them also exhibited a high sex ratio but at a slower pace. Taegu is fairly conservative with a history boasting three generals. Therefore, son preference is particularly strong there. Sex-selective abortion procedures also require fetal sex screening that is very expensive in South Korea and requires extensive medical equipment. As a result, a possible explanation for the lag in rising in rural areas may be due to lack of medical facilities in rural areas to determine the sex of fetus. ==Societal implications== ===Consequences of high sex ratio=== With greater male births to female births, there is a fear of a shortage of brides in South Korea. Young rural men are having more difficulty finding wives due to majority of young women going to urban areas for better employment and quality of life. However, further studies have found that this phenomenon may be more likely due to the overall declining fertility levels in South Korea in the recent years, rather than sex-selective abortions. Another negative social implication may be the increased use of pornography due to rarity of women and greater sex related crimes of violence targeting women. With a greater scarcity of women, men may be more inclined and desperate to seek out female partners. Data has shown that small families usually consisted of more sons while larger families have more daughters. The continuation of this trend may widen the social gap between males and females in which sons in small families will have more resources and more advantageous opportunities than daughters in larger families where there are less resources. However, this may also not be as prevalent in South Korea where kinship and sibling support is strongly encouraged. ===Possible positive effects=== On the other hand, there may be some positive implications as well. With sex-selective abortion, there is a reduction in number of unwanted children, preventing post neonatal infant mortality and abuse of girls. The rarity of women may result in women having increased value as well, eventually leading to more balanced birth sex ratios. Additionally, if a women has a son, they may be treated better by the families and her family position and social status is secured. == Sex-selection technology and methods == ===Prenatal sex screening=== In 1987, fetal screening was only legal for detection for genetic problems and monitoring fetal growth but banned for the sole purpose of prenatal sex screenings. Techniques included chronic villus sampling, amniocentesis, and ultrasounds. However, since there were no substantive penalties for prenatal sex screenings besides a fine, many families were still finding ways to screen for their baby's sex. Additionally, fetal screening for medical purposes often inevitably show the sex of the baby as a byproduct. Scholars have made a connection between the emergence of ultrasound and sex screening technologies in the mid-1980s to the large increase in male births between 1985 and 1995. In response to the high sex ratios, the government sharpened the penalties and in 1990, they arrested and suspended the medical licenses of physicians that performed these sex determination tests on fetuses. Each selective abortion required at least two tests of sex determination and these tests were often really expensive. Thus, not every women had equal opportunities to health care and abortion options. In combination with the high price of fetal screening and heightened penalties, the sex ratios began to lower and normalize after 1995, suggesting lower rates of sex-selective abortions during that time. ===Abortion methods=== Due to the criminalization of abortion in South Korea, many women had to find ways around the law to receive an abortion. However, this wasn't as difficult as it may have seemed. Numerous clinics across Korea secretly performed abortions. Despite possible health complications that could arise from receiving fast and cheap abortion procedures, women still sought out these clinics. Oftentimes, women would have an induced abortion early in pregnancy under the name of \\"menstrual extraction\\" in which a vacuum is used to suck the fetus out of the womb during the first trimester, resulting in heavy bleeding. This procedure is controversial because it is performed without full certainty that the women is actually pregnant since it is done so early in the term. Due to this, this process escapes the legalities behind abortion and is accepted in South Korea as part of \\"family planning\\" and \\"public health\\" services. Scholars have noted that this accessibility of abortions perpetuated the continued performance of sex-selective abortions during the mid-1980s to 1990s. == References == Category:Health in South Korea Category:Sexism in South Korea ","title":"Sex-selective abortion in South Korea"},{"id":"60406311","text":"Elisa Dalla Valle (born 16 January 1998) is an Italian professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team . ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Italian female cyclists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Elisa Dalla Valle"},{"id":"60406312","text":"CSOA Forte Prenestino is a large self-managed social centre based in a squatted fort in Centocelle, Rome. It was occupied on May Day 1986. Forte Prenestino is an \\"important node of production of cultural and political events\\" and hosts many groups and events across its 13 hectares. ==History of fort== Forte Prenestina was built between 1880 and 1884. It was one of fifteen Roman forts constructed in this time and never used in battle. By the 1950s it was derelict and from 1977 onwards it was used as a dump by the Municipality of Rome. ==Occupation== CSOA Forte Prenestino was occupied on May 1 1986, during a 'Festival of Non-Work.' CSOA (Italian: Centro Sociale Occupato Autogestito) means 'Occupied Self-Managed Social Centre.' The squatters cleaned the site and all the rubbish which had been dumped there was removed. ==Activities== Hip hop group Colle der Fomento performing at Forte Prenestino The size of the centre allows it to host many groups and activities. In 1996, Steve Wright wrote that: \\"Forte Prenestino plays an important role in its local community. It houses an exhibition gallery, practice rooms for bands, space for theatrical performances, a dark room, gymnasium, and cafe. Classes are held, there are regular film nights, courses on design and sculpture, and a documentation centre. Outside Rome, the Forte is best known for its music label, featuring local rap and reggae bands. It also produces the journal Nessuna Dipendenza, which documents the Forte's activities and engages in political discussion and debate.\\" The rap group Assalti Frontali built a recording studio at the fort in the 1990s. Many internationally known bands, for example Autechre, Fugazi (5 times) and Test Department have played at the centre. There is also an antifascist gym. Other activities include an infoshop, a bicycle workshop, a children's playground, a garden with flora guide and a herbalist shop. Organisations utilising different areas include a cinema, a bar, a theatre, a permanent exhibition area, a tattoo and piercing studio, a tea room and an organic farmers market. ==References== Category: Buildings and structures in Rome Category: Music venues in Italy Category: Squats in Italy Category:Infoshops ","title":"CSOA Forte Prenestino"},{"id":"60406321","text":"Peter Herceg de Szekcs≈ë (; born Peter K≈ëszegi, also known as Peter the Duke; ; died between 1353 and 1358) was a Hungarian lord in the first half of the 14th century. He was born into the powerful and rebellious K≈ëszegi family, whose members were considered the ardent enemies of Charles I of Hungary. After years of wars and failed revolts, Peter pledged allegiance to the king in 1339. He became the progenitor of the Herceg de Szekcs≈ë noble family. ==Family== Peter was born around 1285 as the younger son of the powerful oligarch Henry II K≈ëszegi and his unidentified wife, the daughter of Mojs II, Palatine of Hungary. He had an elder brother, John and an unnamed sister.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus H√©der 4. K≈ëszegi [and Rohonci] branch) He married an unidentified daughter of John Baboniƒá, Ban of Slavonia. She was still alive in 1366. They had a son, Peter II, who was born after 1351, when Peter was already in advanced age.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus H√©der 6. Herceg [de Szekcs≈ë] branch) Throughout his life, Peter was referred with the nickname \\"the Duke\\" (). After 1339, it became his family name (). His kinship flourished until the 17th century. ==Career== Following the death of their father in 1310, John and Peter jointly ruled the inherited large-scale domains in Upper Slavonia and Southern Transdanubia, owning dozens of castles and landholdings. Initially, they nominally supported the efforts of Charles I, but later turned against the monarch by the mid-1310s. At the course of two brief royal military campaigns in 1315 and 1316, Charles defeated them and crushed their power and province in Southern Transdanubia. The brothers withdrew to Upper Slavonia beyond the river Drava. There, they were defeated by John Baboniƒá, Peter's future father-in-law in 1317. Following that, John and Peter were able to retain their castles only in the region of Zagorje, where their father had started to expand his territory decades earlier. The brothers also fought in the army of their relative Andrew, whose province in Western Transdanubia was ultimately crushed by the royal troops in the first half of 1319. John and Peter surrendered by the spring of 1320, Charles I referred to them as \\"former rebels, now Our adherents\\". However, when their cousin John the \\"Wolf\\" rose up in open rebellion against Charles I in 1327, John and Peter joined to him. The king defeated them within months, the brothers lost another forts, further decreasing their number of castles. Kostel Castle, today in Slovenia John died sometime after 1327. Peter and the three sons of his late brother was among those members of the K≈ëszegi family, who made an alliance with the House of Habsburg against Charles I in January 1336, alongside the Baboniƒá family. When Charles signed a truce with his enemies on 13 December after a brief war, he called the members of the two families as the \\"traitors of the Holy Crown\\". The document put Peter's name in the first place among the traitors, before his nephews, his cousin John the \\"Wolf\\" and the Baboniƒái. According to Charles' narration, Peter invited the Austrian army to Slavonia in order to try to acquire the province for the Dukes of Austria. For the sake of success, he even handed over his two castles, Vrbovec (Orbolc) and ≈†trigova (Sztrig√≥) to the dukes. The war between Hungary and Austria continued until 1339. Charles obliged the K≈ëszegis to renounce their last fortresses along the western borders of the kingdom in 1339. While John the \\"Wolf\\" pledged allegiance to Albert II, Duke of Austria in June 1339, gradually integrating into the Austrian nobility, Peter and his nephews chose a different path: they returned to the loyalty of Charles. In exchange for his last fortresses in Zagorje ‚Äì including Belec, Kostel, Krapina (Korpona), Vrbovec, and O≈°trc (Oszterc), Charles donated Szekcs≈ë and K≈ëszeg (Batina) in Baranya County to Peter, both which he once co-owned with his brother before their rebellion. This effectively marked the end of the K≈ëszegis' rule and domination in Western Hungary after seventy years. Thereafter, he adopted the Herceg family name with the suffix \\"de Szekcs≈ë\\". Simultaneously with the royal grant of landholdings, Peter was made isp√°n of Bodrog County (which position was omitted as accessory to the dignity of Ban of Macs√≥ since then). In contemporary records, he was styled as isp√°n in the period between 1342 and 1347, but it is plausible that he held the office throughout from 1339 to 1353. Peter retained his position during the reign of Louis I of Hungary too. In March 1351, his late brother's three sons, Nicholas, Peter and Henry (ancestors of the Tam√°sis) persuaded by lawsuit the then-childless Peter Herceg to adopt them and make them the heirs of his wealth, if he dies without children. However, his only son, Peter was born soon, which made the contract null and void. Peter Herceg died before 1358. == References == == Sources == * * * - Category:1350s deaths Peter Category:13th-century Hungarian people Category:14th-century Hungarian people ","title":"Peter Herceg"},{"id":"60406325","text":"Laura Tomasi (born 1 July 1999) is an Italian professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team . ==References== ==External links== * Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Italian female cyclists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Laura Tomasi"},{"id":"60406328","text":"The 1939‚Äì40 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team represented the University of Idaho during the 1939‚Äì40 NCAA college basketball season.

Butler and Jason G. Butler, known together professionally as the Butler Brothers, are Canadian film directors, writers and producers. They are known for darkly funny, character driven movies, including First Round Down, Mourning Has Broken, and Confusions of an Unmarried Couple. The pair have been collaborating since 2005 and have also co-produced feature films from other writer/directors including Love in the Sixth by Jude Klassen and The Notorious Newman Brothers by Ryan Noel, which they also starred in. == Early lives == The Butler Brothers were born and primarily raised in Toronto, Ontario, by their parents, Robert and Barbara (n√©e MacPherson). They both graduated from Earl Haig Secondary School in Toronto. Jason attended Laurentian University and Brett enrolled at Carleton University. == Career == Opting out of his final year at Carleton, Brett moved back to Toronto and began working on a script with Jason that would eventually become their first feature film, Alive and Lubricated. Shot with a shoestring budget on 16mm film, it was a crash course in indie filmmaking for the Butlers who wrote, produced, directed, acted and edited the film. The Butlers quickly began production on their second feature, Bums, once again sharing duties as writer, producer, director and editor, eventually releasing both films independently. With two actors (one being Brett) and no budget the Butlers shot their third feature, Confusions of an Unmarried Couple, a story revolving around a former couple debating whether or not they should get back together - it was a critical success. In 2012 the Butlers were among thirty-five filmmakers that submitted to the $1K Film Challenge created by independent filmmaker Ingrid Veninger. Their pitch was one of five that were selected for production. With a budget of $1,000 it became their fourth feature, Mourning Has Broken. Around that same time the Butlers starred in the debut feature by Ryan Noel, The Notorious Newman Brothers, which they also co-wrote and produced with Noel. In 2016 the Butler Brothers released their fifth feature film, First Round Down, an action-comedy starring Dylan Bruce. All five of their films have been produced under their film production company banner, Substance Production and are known as \\"Butler Brother Brews\\". In 2015 the Butlers co-produced, edited and had supporting roles in Jude Klassen's debut feature film, Love in the Sixth. == Filmography == * Alive and Lubricated (2005) * Bums (2006) * Confusions of an Unmarried Couple (2008) * The Notorious Newman Brothers (2010) * Mourning Has Broken (2013) * First Round Down (2016) == References == == External links == * * Category:Canadian film producers Category:Film directors from Toronto Category:Living people Category:Sibling duos Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Butler Brothers (filmmakers)"},{"id":"60406351","text":"Martina Toffanin (born 23 June 2000) is an Italian professional racing cyclist, who last rode for the UCI Women's Team during the 2019 women's road cycling season. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Italian female cyclists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Martina Toffanin"},{"id":"60406352","text":"Toto is the surname of: * Anthony Toto (1498‚Äì1554), Italian painter and architect * Gerald Toto (born 1967), French composer and performer * Jonathan Toto (born 1990), French footballer of Cameroonian heritage * Ismet Toto (1908‚Äì1937), Albanian bureaucrat, publicist, writer and political activist * Paolo Tot√≤ (born 1991), Italian cyclist ==See also== *Tono (name) ","title":"Toto (surname)"},{"id":"60406358","text":"The South African National Bowls Championships is organised by Bowls South Africa (BSA).

The facility was constructed in the 1970s and planned to host an international trade fair upon completion. In 2002, jewelry, auto spare parts and other consumer goods traders from Balogun Market on Lagos Island relocated to the complex. Today, the complex host traders representing a number of trade groups including Balogun Business Association, Auto Spare Parts And Machineries Dealers Association (ASPMDA), and jewelers under the banner of Association of Progressive Traders. The facility was designed by Zoran Bojoviƒá and constructed by Energoprojeckt in partnership with the Nigerian government, it was opened in 1977 to coincide with the first Lagos International Trade Fair. At completion, it was the biggest project of Energoprojekt in Nigeria. The company and its designers including Bojovic also executed projects in Kano and Yola. It is theorized by Rem Koolhaas that Bojovic incorporated some of the architectural forms found in Kano into the designs of the trade fair complex. The design of the complex placed emphasis on exhibition pavilions, an exhibition hall was dedicated to the federal government while state governments also had their own halls, two halls were each dedicated to Nigerian and international corporations. Other facilities within the complex was an amusement park and an artificial lake adjacent to the park, a number of chalets, a press center, shopping stalls and a festival square. Over the years, the infrastructure within the complex have been poorly maintained. The complex was concenssioned to a private firm in 2007 but that agreement was revoked in 2018. == References == Category:Economy of Lagos Category:Buildings and structures in Lagos ","title":"Lagos Trade Fair Complex"},{"id":"60406445","text":"Clarity Haynes is a queer feminist American artist and writer. She currently lives and works in New York, NY. Haynes is best known for her unconventional depictions of the female torso. She is a former member of the tART Collective and the Corpus VI Collective. == Education == Haynes holds a BA in Film from Temple University, a CFA in Painting from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and an MFA in Painting from Brooklyn College. == Work == Haynes' work focuses heavily on the human body, she believes the moles, wrinkles, stretch marks, veins and such on our bodies are landmarks of our journey through our lives. Her themes often include aging, illness, and mortality. Her work pushes the social conventions of beauty, femininity, as well as gender and sexuality. Haynes‚Äô most controversial work is The Breast Portrait Project, portraying the nude female torso complete with wrinkles and blemishes, in the opposite style from a glamour portrait. The absence of a face compels the viewer to detect character and personality from these less-familiar indicators. This project initially began with a self portrait of her own torso in order to confront her own image issues. After feeling empowered by the portrait, Haynes began doing more of these portraits for friends and soon for complete strangers at festivals. Clarity explains: ‚ÄúI am interested in the many ways the body changes throughout a lifetime, and in the ways in which we create and change our bodies.‚Äù She even kept record and pictures of each sitter in handmade books for the project full of the women she painted to help heal just like she had. This project was very big in the LGBTQ and feminist communities of the 90s. == Exhibitions == Haynes has had solo exhibitions at Brandeis University's Kniznick Gallery, Payne Gallery at Moravian College, Stout Projects, Bogigian Gallery at Wilson College, and Artists' House Gallery. Her work was included in The Outwin 2016: American Portraiture Today at the National Portrait Gallery, which traveled to the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, the Tacoma Art Museum, the Ackland Art Museum and the Art Museum of South Texas. She has participated in many group exhibitions, including at the Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Rutgers University's Paul Robeson Galleries, Invisible-Exports Gallery, Mana Contemporary, and the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art. == Recognition == Haynes has received numerous awards, including a Pollock- Krasner Foundation award, a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Painting, a MacDowell Fellowship, a Brooklyn Arts Council/New York City Department of Cultural Affairs Community Regrant Award, a Leeway Foundation Window of Opportunity Grant, and a Barbara Deming Memorial Fund Grant.Haynes' work has been discussed in many publications, including the Washington Post, Hyperallergic, Two Coats of Paint, Juxtapoz Magazine, Beautiful Decay Magazine, and the Huffington Post, among others. Her work is included in The Body: Social and Cultural Dissections, Routledge, and Living Out Loud: An Introduction to LGBTQ History, Society, and Culture, Routledge. Her work was featured in Sinister Wisdom's July 2016 issue, Variations. Haynes' work is in the collections of the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art, and the Rena Rowan Breast Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. Her work is included in the Brooklyn Museum's Feminist Art Base, a digital archive. == Censorship == Haynes' work is frequently censored on social media.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Thompson, to the northwest. Portal Peak is situated east of the Wapta Icefield, and is a member of the Waputik Mountains. Portal Peak can be seen from the Icefields Parkway at Bow Lake. ==History== Portal Peak was named in 1916 by Charles Sproull Thompson (1869-1921), who participated in numerous first ascents in the Canadian Rockies. In August of 1897, Charles Thompson, Hugh Stutfield, and J. Norman Collie camped on the shores of Bow Lake; then proceeded to climb the Bow Glacier, which at that time descended farther down into the valley; then crossed the Wapta Icefield to attain the summit of Mount Gordon. Portal Peak flanks one side of Bow Glacier, which in 1897 was considered the portal to the Wapta Icefield. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of Portal Peak was made in 1926 by D. Duncan and L. Hudson. ==Geology== Portal Peak is an overthrust peak situated between the Bow Glacier and Peyto Glacier. Like other mountains in Banff Park, Portal Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Portal Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Portal Peak drains into the Bow River which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River. ==References== ==See also== *List of mountains of Canada *Geography of Alberta Portal Peak centered with Thompson to right ==External links== * Weather forecast: Portal Peak * Parks Canada web site: Banff National Park * Portal Peak photo: Flickr Category:Mountains of Alberta Category:Mountains of Banff National Park Category:Canadian Rockies Category:Alberta's Rockies ","title":"Portal Peak"},{"id":"60406480","text":"Gloma is a genus of flies in the family Empididae. ==Species== *G. fuscipennis Meigen, 1822 *G. fuscipes Melander, 1945 * ‚Ä†G. hirta Loew, 1850 *G. luctuosa Melander, 1928 *G. pectinipes Melander, 1945 ==References== Category:Empidoidea genera Category:Empididae ","title":"Gloma"},{"id":"60406481","text":"Margaret Eleanor Barbour Simpson was a Scottish archaeologist. She is considered as the first professional woman archaeologist in Scotland. She was a member of Prof. Gordon Childe's team of archaeologists at Skara Brae and Kindrochat, as well as the writer of some of the first guidebooks for state- owned historic properties in Scotland. == Early life == Margaret grew up in Edinburgh, within a family of medics. She was the daughter of George Freeland Barbour Simpson MD FRSE FRCPE FRCSE JP and Caroline Elizabeth Barbour, the granddaughter of Sir Alexander Russell Simpson (1838-1916), and the great- great niece of Sir James Young Simpson (1811-1870). == Career == She matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in 1925. From 1928-29 Margaret attended an archaeology class taught by Gordon Childe, entitled the First Ordinary Archaeology Class. From 1929-30 she was the first secretary of the Edinburgh League of Prehistorians. She was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1930. Her appointment in 1930 as the Assistant Inspector of Ancient Monuments is considered as the first professional female archaeologist in Scotland. In a letter to Margaret, regarding her application, Gordon Childe wrote: \\"I am really very keen that they should get the right person and I think that you are it. It‚Äôs good to have a woman.\\" She held the post until 1948. In 1941, she married Frederick Root and the couple lived in London before moving to Surrey in 1944. Some of her later publications are credited to Margaret E. Root, confusingly including some that are reprints of publications originally crediting her as Margaret Simpson. == Archaeology == === Skara Brae Excavation 1927-1930 === Margaret participated in the excavation at Skara Brae, led by Prof. Gordon Childe in the years 1927‚Äì1930, and was later acknowledged by him in a monograph on the subject. She also features in several photographs from the excavation (currently in the collection of Orkney Library and Archive), along with other female archaeologists (Margaret Mitchell, Mary Kennedy, and Dame Margaret Cole). They were initially considered to be either tourists or local women visiting the site, but are now identified as Prof. Childe's students and members of his excavation crew. === Kindrochat Excavation 1929-1930 === In 1929 Margaret was also one of the team of archaeologists who excavated the chambered cairn at Kindrochat (aka Kindrochet) in Perthshire, once more under the leadership of Gordon Childe. In his later correspondence he wrote that \\"she was entrusted with the examination of one of the megalithic chambers and produced, quite unaided, an excellent plan with elevations.\\" Her drawings and observations can be found in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. === Guidebooks === She collaborated with James Richardson on some of the first guidebooks for state-owned properties in Scotland. These include Stirling Full text of Second Edition 1948 available here and Balvenie Castles (1936) and Inchmahome Priory (1936) with Richardson, and Dunkeld Cathedral (1935) as a sole author. == References == Category:Scottish archaeologists Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Category:British women archaeologists Category:1906 births Category:1994 deaths ","title":"Margaret E.B.

This was on the same day as other local elections. The election resulted in the Labour Party retaining its control of the council with an increased majority. The Conservative Party suffered its worst defeat in Bassetlaw since 1973, winning only 5 seats of the 12 seats it was defending. Both Independents and Labour gained seats from the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats gained a seat from Labour in East Retford West, the first Liberal Democrat elected in Bassetlaw since 2006. ==Background== Bassetlaw is a shire district in Nottinghamshire, England. It is predominantly rural, with two towns: Worksop and Retford. The district was formed in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972. Local Government in Nottinghamshire is organised on a two-tier basis, with local district councils responsible for local services such as housing, local planning and refuse collection and Nottinghamshire County Council responsible for \\"wide- area\\" services, including education, social services and public transport. Bassetlaw District Council has been controlled by Labour for most of its existence, except for a brief period from 2006 to 2011 when it was controlled by the Conservatives. Bassetlaw District Council held local elections on 2 May 2019 along with other councils in England as part of the 2019 local elections. Bassetlaw is divided into 25 wards for electoral purposes, with each ward electing between one and three councillors. Until 2015, the council was elected by thirds, with district elections being held every year except the year in which elections to Nottinghamshire County Council took place. The council resolved in 2014 to hold all-out elections from 2015 onwards, with all 48 councillors elected in all-out elections every four years. Councillors defending their seats in this election were previously elected in 2015. At that election, Labour won a majority of seats and retained its control of the council, which it has controlled since 2011. ==Result== The election resulted in the Labour Party retaining its control of the councilhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/c34kqd05n0mt/bassetlaw-district- council ==Ward results== Asterisks denote incumbent Councillors seeking re- election. ===Beckingham=== Map of Beckingham ward. ===Blyth=== Map of Blyth ward. ===Carlton=== Map of Carlton ward. ===Clayworth=== Map of Clayworth ward. ===East Markham=== Map of East Markham ward. ===East Retford East=== Map of East Retford East ward. ===East Retford North=== Map of East Retford North ward. ===East Retford South=== Map of East Retford South ward. ===East Retford West=== Map of East Retford West ward. ===Everton=== Map of Everton ward. ===Harworth=== Map of Harworth ward. ===Langold=== Map of Langold ward. ===Misterton=== Map of Misterton ward. ===Rampton=== Map of Rampton ward. ===Ranskill=== Map of Ranskill ward. ===Sturton=== Map of Sturton ward. ===Sutton=== Map of Sutton ward. ===Tuxford and Trent=== Map of Tuxford and Trent ward. ===Welbeck=== Map of Welbeck ward. ===Worksop East=== Map of Worksop East ward. ===Worksop North=== Map of Worksop North ward. ===Worksop North East=== Map of Worksop North East ward. ===Worksop North West=== Map of Worksop North West ward. ===Worksop South=== Map of Worksop South ward. ===Worksop South East=== Map of Worksop South East ward. :‚Ä† Colin Barton was expelled from the Conservative Party in April 2019, however he remained a nominated Conservative candidate in this election as the deadline for withdrawals had passed. ==References== Category:2019 English local elections 2019 Category:2010s in Nottinghamshire Category:May 2019 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"2019 Bassetlaw District Council election"},{"id":"60406758","text":"The Seward County Courthouse is a historic building in Seward, Nebraska, and the county courthouse for Seward County.

A neighbor of Aluche, S√°nchez Mato, self-described as a \\"Communist and Christian\\", participated in Christian grassroot groups and was active in Nueva Claridad, a Trotskyist group. He reported a case of abuse of minors in his parish in 2002 and later founded the \\"Association Church Without Abuses\\", being in the receiving end of threats because of it. With a career as economist in the private sector, he entered ATTAC Madrid in 2011. === 2015 municipal election === A longstanding member of United Left (IU), as well as a member of its regional federation United Left of the Community of Madrid (IUCM), he was forced to leave the later organization before the 2015 Madrid municipal election in order to ran as candidate in the 14th slot of the Ahora Madrid list for the election.

He was educated at Westminster School in 1701 as a Kings Scholar. Corbett joined the navy as an ordinary seaman in 1704, serving under Admiral Sir George Byng as a clerk from 1704 to 1705, and as a secretary from 1705 to 1709. In 1711, he became Byng's personal secretary and trusted assistant. In 1712, when he was at Utrecht, he tried unsuccessfully to obtain the post of secretary to Lord Strafford. He was appointed a clerk in the Admiralty in 1715, when Byng was re-appointed to the board of the Admiralty and secretary to Greenwich Hospital in 1716. He accompanied Byng during the expedition to Sicily from 1718 to 1720 and afterwards published an account. In 1723, he was promoted chief clerk over the heads of all other staff when Byng was Treasurer of the navy, and was made deputy secretary in 1728, when Byng became first lord.

On the night of 10-11 June 1982, during the Battle of Sultan Yacoub in the 1982 Lebanon War, his unit was attacked and he and five other comrades were declared missing. One had been killed and was later found buried in Syria, and two were located alive in Syria and returned to Israel a few years later. But Baumel and two others remained unaccounted for. Until his death in 2009, Baumel's father Yona kept his son's case in the public eye, traveling around the world to uncover leads to verify the persistent rumors that his son was still alive, and criticizing the Israeli army for not pursuing the case vigilantly. On 3 April 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian army, in coordination with the Syrian military, had found Baumel's remains. The military operation was a result of a two-year cooperative effort between Israel and Russia to return bodies of missing Israeli soldiers buried in Syrian territory formerly controlled by ISIL; the operation was code-named Operation Bittersweet Song (, Zemer Noogge). Baumel's remains were handed over to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an official ceremony at the Russian defense ministry in Moscow on 3 April and interred the following day at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. The whereabouts of the other missing soldiers remain unknown. ==Early life and family== Zechariah Baumel was born on November 17, 1960, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Yona and Miriam Baumel. He was the youngest of three children. As a youth, he attended the Hebrew Institute of Boro Park. In 1970 he, his parents, and siblings immigrated to Israel, settling in the Kiryat Motzkin suburb of Haifa. He studied at a state religious school and advanced to Midreshiat No'am High School in Pardes Hanna. After high school graduation, Baumel enrolled in the hesder program at Yeshivat Har Etzion, a program that combines yeshiva studies with army service. ==Military career== Baumel served as a tank commander in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Close to the end of his military service Baumel was involved in the Battle of Sultan Yacoub in the 1982 Lebanon War. Serving in the 362nd Battalion, Baumel was assigned as the driver in a tank alongside gunner Arik Lieberman, communications operator Zvi Feldman, and commanding officer Hezi Shai.Levine, Eli. \\"Zechariah Baumel Finally at Rest\\". Ami, April 10, 2019, pp. 104‚Äì118. On the night of June 10‚Äì11, 1982, his tank was hit and the crew abandoned it. After the battle, Baumel, Lieberman, Feldman, and Shai, as well as two soldiers from a different tank, were reported as missing in action. Later on the day of the battle, Western journalists from Time, Associated Press, and La Stampa, as well as Syrian media sources, reported that three Israeli soldiers and their tank were paraded through Damascus in a \\"victory march\\". However, the images from this event were too blurry to verify the participants. A few weeks after the incident, Syria announced it had interred four bodies in a Jewish cemetery; however, the exhumation of the graves by the Red Cross in 1983 turned up only one Israeli soldier reported missing from the battle, who was returned to Israel, and three Arabs. Lieberman, who had been taken to Syria, was returned to Israel in a prisoner exchange on June 23, 1984, while Shai had been captured by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ‚Äì General Command and taken to Syria, where he was discovered two years later and returned to Israel in a prisoner exchange in 1985. IDF intelligence officers concluded that Baumel, Feldman, and Yehuda Katz, another soldier in the battalion, had been killed in the battle and buried in temporary graves in Lebanon, and that the bodies were subsequently reinterred in the Martyrs' Cemetery in the Yarmouk refugee camp. Fatah leader Abu Jihad stated to reporters on numerous occasions that his men had buried the bodies of the missing Israeli soldiers. The families of the missing soldiers, however, believed they were still alive. In the decades following Baumel's disappearance, his father Yona traveled around the world to uncover leads and interview \\"hundreds of witnesses and informants\\" to verify the persistent rumors that his son was still alive. Prior to the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, Yasser Arafat handed over to Israel half of Baumel's dog tag and claimed that he had more information as to Baumel's whereabouts; he later declined to give more details. Israeli intelligence officers believed that the dog tag had been removed from Baumel's body by a Palestinian doctor who assisted in the burial of the fallen soldiers right after the battle. Yet as late as 2005, the elder Baumel met with people in Syria who said they had visited his son that year. In 2006, the Baumels filed suit against Syria under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, charging the Syrian government and top officials with \\"Zachary's abduction and illegal imprisonment\\". In Israel, the elder Baumel maintained a high public profile to keep his son's plight before the nation and the military. He joined many protests and demonstrations, briefly engaged in a hunger strike, and was openly critical of the way his family was being treated by the IDF. In 2003 Baumel fought against the IDF's decision to declare his son dead. In the absence of an official government effort to locate the missing soldiers, he and other parents of those missing established their own group called The International Coalition for Missing Israeli Soldiers and followed up leads around the world. As a result of their lobbying efforts in the United States, President Bill Clinton signed into law \\"A Bill to Locate and Secure the Release of Zachary Baumel, an American Citizen and Other Israelis Missing in Action\\" on November 8, 1999. This law ordered the US State Department to discuss the issue of missing Israeli soldiers with Arab governments in the Middle East on \\"an urgent basis\\", and to \\"[link] U.S. economic assistance to those governments to their cooperation\\". ==Recovery of remains== On April 3, 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian army, in coordination with the Syrian military, had located Baumel's remains. The bodies of Baumel and 20 other people had been removed from the old Martyrs' Cemetery in the Yarmouk refugee camp south of Damascus earlier in April. The Israeli‚ÄìRussian cooperation was part of a two-year military operation called Operation Bittersweet Song, which endeavored to locate remains of missing Israeli soldiers buried in Syrian territory formerly controlled by ISIL. The operation reportedly opened \\"hundreds\\" of graves and exhumed hundreds of bodies for analysis. When Baumel's grave was opened, the searchers immediately noticed that the body was dressed in an IDF uniform and tzitzit. Both the uniform and military boots bore the name \\"Baumel\\". The body was moved to a neighboring country for testing and samples sent to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv, which confirmed Baumel's identity. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Moscow to meet with Putin, and then received Baumel's remains in a ceremony at the Russian defense ministry, where he was also presented with Baumel's uniform and military boots. Baumel was interred at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem on April 4, 2019, in the presence of Netanyahu and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. Thousands attended the nighttime funeral. In January 2020, Israel released two Syrian prisoners as a 'goodwill gesture' in relation to the transfer of Baumel's remains. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Israeli military casualties Category:Missing in action Category:Israeli soldiers Category:1982 Lebanon War Category:American emigrants to Israel Category:People from Brooklyn Category:Prisoners of war held by Syria ","title":"Zechariah Baumel"},{"id":"60406866","text":"Small Acts of Freedom is a 2018 Indian memoir written by activist Gurmehar Kaur and released by Penguin Random House.

Dell was raised on a ranch in Montana. She graduated from Cut Bank High School in Cut Bank, Montana, and then attended Montana State University, where she majored in sports medicine. After graduation, Dell taught high school science and worked as an athletic trainer in Texas. She and her husband moved several times, and after spending time in Pendleton, Oregon, they eventually returned to Montana. During the summers, when school was out and she was off of work, Dell began writing. Her first novel, Reckless in Texas, was published in August 2016. It received positive reviews from several major publishers, which led to it being chosen by a major distributor. The book reached number 19 in paperback romances the week it was released, and was number 42 on the Nielsen BookScan list for all genres. The book was successful enough that Dell was signed to write several more within the series. Her novels are set in the world of rodeo competitions and are inspired by cowboys she has known or seen compete. Unlike in many Western romances, Dell's depictions of the rodeo are given a major emphasis rather than be relegated to the background. Her novels contain many specific details, such as the texture of the shirts, as a nod to the experience and worldview of her son, who has Asperger's. Kirkus Reviews describes Dell's writing as \\"sexy\\" and \\"engaging\\", and applauds her character development. Her third novel, Tougher in Texas, was a finalist for a 2018 Romance Writers of America RITA Award for Best Long Contemporary. Dell competes in the rodeo sport of team roping and breakaway roping. She was the 2018 Canadian Senior Pro Rodeo champion in Ladies Breakaway. ==Notes== Category:Living people Category:American romantic fiction writers Category:American women novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:21st-century American women writers Category:Novelists from Montana Category:Roping (rodeo) Category:Montana State University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kari Lynn Dell"},{"id":"60406872","text":"Gemma La Guardia Gluck (24 April 1881 - 1 November 1962) was an American writer, of Italian Jewish origin, who lived in Hungary and was a survivor of the Holocaust. Her autobiography, published in 1961, tells of her experience as a survivor of the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, but also offers vivid memories of her childhood spent in America with her parents and brother Fiorello La Guardia, the future first Italian-American mayor of New York. == Biography == Gemma La Guardia (or LaGuardia as the surname is normally written in the United States) was born in New York on 24 April 1882. Her father, Achille La Guardia, was an Italian immigrant originally from a Catholic family of Cerignola [1]; by profession he was a musician and in 1885 he became director of the 11 US Infantry band. Her mother was Irene Luzzatto Coen, a Jewish Italian woman originally from Trieste, a niece on the maternal side of Samuel David Luzzatto. Gemma (with her brothers Fiorello, born in 1882, and Richard, born in 1885) followed the family to the various places where her father was posted: Fort Sully (South Dakota), Watertown (New York) and finally Arizona. She received a solid musical education from her father as a child and inherited from her mother the very rich Central European polyglot tradition. [2] In 1898 her father, seriously ill during the Spanish-American war, left the American army, and the family moved to the maternal home of Trieste, in the then Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the death of her father in 1904, the family moved to Budapest, where Gemma gave English lessons. In 1908, she married a Hungarian Jew, Herman Gluck, and settled there permanently, together with her mother who died and was buried there in 1915. Fiorello and Richard returned to New York, where Fiorello completed his studies and began his political career. Richard died of a heart attack in 1927. Gemma's life in Budapest between the two wars was not marked by any particular events. Her husband held an important position in a bank in Budapest. They had two daughters: the first-born Yolanda Gluck Denes (born in 1911) married in Hungary, while Irene Gluck (born in 1918) emigrated to the United States. With the outbreak of the Second World War, along with millions of other Jews, the family was overwhelmed by the tragedy of the Holocaust. [3] On 7 June 1944 Gemma La Guardia Gluck, identified as the sister of Fiorello La Guardia, the famous and influential mayor of New York, was arrested by the Nazis along with her husband, daughter, son-in-law and grandson. She was first detained in Mauthausen with her husband and then from 19 June 1944 interned in the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, where her daughter and grandchild were also taken without her knowledge. The Nazis spared Gemma from forced labor obligations in the hope of being able to use it for an exchange of prisoners, which never happened. The two women (and the grandson) survived their captivity; their husbands, however, both died in Mauthausen. After the war, they applied to emigrate to the United States. With the death of her husband Gemma had regained American citizenship, but her daughter and her grandchild as Hungarian citizens found themselves faced with the initial opposition of the American authorities and grueling expectations, first in Berlin and then in Denmark. Fiorello, very close to his sister but faithful to his upright attitude, helped his family in every possible way but insisted that no favoritism was applied to them; in the end, in May 1947, the family was able to meet in New York, a few months before Fiorello's death. [4] Gemma spent the last years of her life in a modest apartment in Queens. When she arrived in New York in 1947 she wrote a memoir (My Story) which was published in 1961 by SL Shneiderman (the book was republished in 2007 by Rochelle G. Saidel with the title of Fiorello's Sister: Gemma La Guardia Gluck's Story). It is an important testimony to the story of a Hungarian Jewish family who were victims of the Holocaust and the terrible living conditions in the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, but also offers vivid memories of the childhood spent in America with her brother Fiorello and their parents. She died in New York. == Notes == == Works == * Gemma La Guardia Gluck. My Story, ed. S. L. Shneiderman (1961) ** Gemma La Guardia Gluck, Fiorello's Sister: Gemma La Guardia Gluck's Story, ed.

Chef Michael Bradori is back, sober and ready to reclaim his former glory. Food, wine, greed and lust fuel the appetites in the room. Things take a shocking turn when the dining room is transformed into a minefield of political and personal danger where the characters come under threats of guns and violence. ==Cast== Rachel Skarsten at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival ==Themes and influences== Two Hands to Mouth is a violent film, but it is \\"also about where violence comes from\\". Michael DeCarlo asserts that the violence in the film, both physical and emotional, is informed by character: \\"I tried to create an emotional and physical world that explores intimate and tender moments as well as violence and cruelty.\\" The story is also politically-driven. The previous years' economic chaos informed the script: \\"At the same time, this is a narrative and dramatic film, not a political soap box.\\" In terms of aesthetics, DeCarlo kept in mind the words \\"lurid\\" and \\"elegant\\" in mind in preparation for Two Hands to Mouth: for visual inspriation, he and cinematographer Steve Cosens drew on the paintings of Francis Bacon, DeCarlo also citing Sidney Lumet, Luis Bu√±uel, Sam Peckinpah and Quentin Tarantino as cinematic inspirations: \\"I was aware of the cinematic tradition of violence\\". ==Production== ===Background and financing=== Brigette Kingsley had been President of Black Walk Productions since 2008, and became head of Decade Distribution in 2011. Two Hands to Mouth was her first Telefilm Canada-supported feature film. The funding was from production through to post. ===Writing and casting=== The dialogue in Two Hands to Mouth is highly stylized; \\"wall-to-wall talking\\", and yet, \\"the characters rarely sound like they're speaking in the same voice, genuinely coming across as \\"many voices and personalities [who] co-exist and interact with each other\\". Art Hindle in 2014 Sarah Jurgens was enthusiastic about playing Anya, \\"a woman so secure in her sexuality and power\\", as well as working with a Russian accent. During Rachel Skarsten's audition for the part of Leah, she was impressed by DeCarlo's passion: > As I was auditioning, Michael stopped me and then stepped in to take over > from the reader to run through the lines with me himself ... He pushed me to > go much further in my interpretation, and I thought to myself, \\"This is > someone I really want to work with.\\" Thankfully, he felt the same way. According to DeCarlo, Art Hindle had some real insight into his character because of \\"a previous life in the world of business\\": \\"He's an excellent actor. He's handsome and charming and has the intensity to reveal the darkness that lurks within that character.\\" ===Filming and editing=== Principal photography took place in Hamilton, Ontario, over fifteen days with a single camera on a crowded set: > On some days there were 14 actors in the room ... It is very unusual to see > a film with that many principals and more unusual to see them in a film of > our scope. This is an intense and demanding film for the cast. We shot a lot > of 15- and 20-minute takes and then we would do it again. And then again. > This is the most shooting I have ever done in one day. The experience of making the movie was accordingly challenging but rewarding, according to Skarsten. The small ensemble cast spent the entire shoot together, filming the majority of their scenes in one room and staying on the same floor of a hotel: \\"It was a very intense month, but I came away from it with some dear friendships ... and I would love to do more films like Two Hands to Mouth because it was so artistically thirst-quenching.\\" Jurgens also found it to be an invaluable learning experience, working with veterans like Kate Trotter, Ernie Grunwald, and Vincent Walsh. The film was edited by Andrew Kowalchuk, for which he was nominated for an award at the Madrid International Film Festival. ===Music=== Dave Hodge composed an original score for Two Hands to Mouth, pleased enough with the results that he hoped to create a new musical project based on a few of the pieces. In early 2013, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, he ran into Leah Siegel and asked if she was interested in collaborating on the project, and after a few months of writing, recording, and mixing, Hodge and Siegel decided to form the band Leisure Cruise, resulting in the release of their self-titled debut album in May 2014, an album which incorporated two tracks from Two Hands to Mouth. ==Release and reception== Two Hands to Mouth was released on 1 October 2012. ===Critical response=== Adam Nayman describes the film's singular setting as \\"a sort of bare existential space\\", a \\"Sartrean\\" dinner party, and \\"easily one of the most distinctive-looking Canadian first features in recent memory\\", with \\"strong, dynamic compositions and boldly colour-coded lighting to bolster the underlying (and at times overwhelming) sense of claustrophobia and mania.\\" The ensemble cast is \\"a vivid gallery of faces familiar from Canadian film and television\\", but for Nayman, the \\"star turn\\", belongs to \\"that old pro Art Hindle, who slips into the skin of a well-moneyed creep with serpentine finesse.\\" Two Hands to Mouth received two stars on Cin√©s√©ries. ===Nominations=== *Madrid International Film Festival ‚Ä¢ Best Editing ‚Ä¢ Best Actor (Art Hindle) (2013) ==References== ==External links== *Official clip (\\"Cheese debate\\") on Vimeo *Official clip (\\"No good deed\\") on Vimeo *Official clip (\\"Sorry about your friend\\") on Vimeo *Official page on Facebook *Two Hands to Mouth on IMDb Category:2012 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama films ","title":"Two Hands to Mouth"},{"id":"60406900","text":"The Mercedes-Benz N1300 is a light commercial vehicle designed and manufactured by the Spanish subsidiary IMOSA (Industrias del Motor SA) based in Vitoria-Gasteiz, in the Basque Country, north of Spain.

He was appointed secretary of the Embassy to Lord Carteret in Sweden in 1719, receiving ¬£200 p.a. with no extraordinaries as he was to live with the ambassador.

She is an expert in hypertension and ambulatory monitoring. She is a Fellow of the British Pharmacological Society. == Early life and education == Martin grew up in Ireland, where her parents were dentists. Her father was Dr Nicholas Martin and her mother was Josephine Mary (Maura) Martin. She studied medicine at the University of Dublin and graduated in 1983. During her studies she completed an intercalated degree in pharmacology. Martin trained to registrar level in cardiology in Dublin before moving to Edinburgh for her doctoral studies. Martin earned a PhD at the University of Edinburgh. == Research and career == Martin joined the University of Southampton as a lecturer in clinical pharmacology. She worked on allergic rhinitis and studied whether nitric oxide in exhaled breath could be used to diagnose asthma. She was made a senior lecturer at the University of Birmingham in 1996. She had just given birth to her first child. She identified that patients with hypertension experienced less pain than those with normal blood pressure. She wondered whether this diminished pain perception could be part of a larger impairment, eventually impacting memory. Whilst hypertension became characterised by cognitive deficits, Martin studied the reaction times of people with hypertension and found that reaction times did not differ between people with and without hypertension. Whilst diagnosis of hypertension is typically made using blood pressure measurements in a clinic, Martin pointed out that ambulatory monitoring is the most cost effective and correlates best with cardiovascular outcomes. Martin is the lead of the Hypertension Service at University Hospitals Birmingham. She has called for people with mild hypertension to try more healthy lifestyles before turning to pharmaceuticals for hypertension. She developed the NICE Clinical Guideline on Hyperternsion (CG127). She has studied the influence of ethnicity on blood pressure measurement. She has investigated the challenges in treating hypertension in elderly patients due to complications with medicine, as well as the risks of treating women of child-bearing age with antihypertensive drugs. The proportion of the UK population who are elderly is increasing, and they are the biggest consumers of drugs, often taking unnecessary medication and Martin has investigated when non-drug therapies can be used in the treatment of elderly patients. Martin has been part of various clinical trials using hypertensives, and has examined the effectiveness of personalised treatment. She has investigated how to manage and diagnose resistant hypertension. Martin has been involved in the development of undergraduate education; creating the Prescribers‚Äô Licence, which eventually became the National Prescribing Assessment. In 2009 she established the Dr Nicholas and Mrs Maura Martin Scholarship at University College Dublin, a ‚Ç¨2000 scholarship for clinical medical electives. She investigated the use of control charts to monitor clinical variables in four conditions; hypertension, asthma, renal function and diabetes. Martin became programme director of the Wellcome Trust Research Facility at the University of Birmingham in 2014 and was promoted to professor in 2015. She was elected to the editorial board of the British Journal of Cardiology in 2017. === Equality and advocacy === Martin is involved with activities to promote equality and diversity at the University of Birmingham. Since 2007 she has chaired the Women in Academic Medicine group at the University of Birmingham. She led the University of Birmingham Medical School silver Athena SWAN application in 2014. She was made deputy pro-vice-chancellor for equalities in 2015. Martin is leading on the University of Birmingham application to the Race Equality Charter. == References == Category:Irish women medical doctors Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Academics of the University of Birmingham Category:Women physicians Category:British women medical doctors Category:Hypertension Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Una Martin"},{"id":"60407227","text":"Charata Airport is an airport serving the town of Charata in the Chaco Province of Argentina.

Angma's post circulated widely online, mobilizing ordinary people (especially Korean youth) to demand SOFA reform and an apology from President George W. Bush with peaceful candlelight protests in Kwanghwamun. Since then, the Internet has been a space for open discussion of sociopolitical issues and grassroots activism in South Korea. Other examples of Internet activism in Korea are the 2008 U.S. beef protest, anti-Chosunilbo protests, and online feminist and LGBTQ movements with hashtags (such as #MeToo). According to Kookmin and Yeungnam University researchers Sujin Choi and Han Woo Park, the three stages of Internet activism are the organization of members in networks, the formation of a collective identity, and tactical actions (petitions and letter-writing) which mobilize people in on- and offline movements. The effectiveness of Internet activism is debated, and some argue that online political participation lacks meaningful effort. Internet activism, however, has opened doors for victims of sexual assault, empowered youth to demand justice and responsibility from the Korean government, and played a role in collective action. == Historical context == South Korea is known for its high- speed Internet and advanced IT infrastructure. With the development of Korea‚Äôs information infrastructure and growth of the broadband market in the mid-1990s, Internet usage increased dramatically. By 2002, 57.4 percent of Koreans had a high-speed Internet connection; this percentage grew steadily, reaching 95.1 percent in 2017. In the early 21st century, the internet began playing a transformative role in South Korea's activist landscape. It has become an accessible, multi-route medium through which users communicate, share opinions and create content, facilitating political participation for many (especially Korean youth). From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, Korean children and teenagers between the ages of seven and 19 had the highest Internet penetration rate; this was followed by people in their twenties and thirties. This phenomenon represented a significant shift from pre-Internet public discourse, which was dominated by older people. Before the political liberalization of the late 1980s, the Korean government under Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan strictly censored the press and media to suppress anti- regime rhetoric. The Korean government now exercises minimal Internet censorship, allowing extensive freedom of expression; as a result, Koreans can post and circulate politically-sensitive messages on the Internet without fear of persecution and build online communities as part of political movements. During the 2002 presidential election, Korean youth utilized the Internet to discuss political issues and support (and criticize) government leaders. The Internet has become a potent tool for grassroots activism in South Korea, facilitating the on- and offline mobilization of citizens who want to shape the political landscape and providing a social space for voicing opinions and forging alliances. == Examples == === 2002 candlelight vigils === On June 13, 2002, Shin Hyo-soon and Shim Mi-sun were killed by U.S. military vehicles in what became known as the Yangju highway incident. Under the U.S.-South Korea status of forces agreement (SOFA), the indicted American servicemen were tried in a U.S. court-martial in Korea and acquitted of negligent homicide. The acquittal enraged many South Koreans, spurring anti-American sentiment across the nation. As more people learned about the incident through the Internet, they engaged in online discourse which sparked protests demanding SOFA reform and justice for the victims. Funeral photographs of the two girls circulated widely on the Internet and were placed on the main pages of online communities such as Ko Sin Hyo-sun Sim Mi-son Yang Ch'umo Moim, generating disbelief, grief and anger in community members. Users displayed their collective identity as mourners and protestors, questioning the existing legal framework through usernames, ideograms, and commemorative letters dedicated to the deceased. Other online postings expressed strong anti-American sentiment (such as \\"The American GIs committed such a brutal crime without guilt. The U.S. is so arrogant\\" and \\"Koreans should unify and expel the American troops from Korea. We should boycott McDonald's and Burger King, too\\"), exemplifying Koreans' attempt to hold the U.S. accountable for the tragedy and free themselves from the U.S. military presence. On November 30, 2002, an anonymous citizen reporter for OhmyNews with the nickname \\"Angma\\" proposed holding peaceful candlelight vigils for the two girls in Kwanghwa-moon Square. Angma's message spread quickly throughout the Internet, as Korean netizens forwarded the suggestion on website bulletin boards and forums. The online exchange of shared grievances and anger was soon carried offline to Korea's first candlelight vigil, the Misun-Hyosun vigil, where over 10,000 people gathered to memorialize the girls and peacefully demand a public apology from President George W. Bush and reform of SOFA to establish an equal relationship between South Korea and the U.S. Between November 2002 and June 2004, 422 candlelight vigils were held. The 2002 candlelight vigils were a pivotal event in the history of Internet activism in south Korea, demonstrating the power of the Internet to spread information and gather participants in on- and offline activism. === 2008 U.S. beef protest === In April 2008, when newly-elected president Lee Myung-bak and his administration resumed beef importation from the U.S. under the United States‚ÄìKorea Free Trade Agreement despite growing public fear of mad cow disease, a netizen known as \\"Andante\\" posted a petition to impeach the president on the Agora online bulletin board on Daum.net (Korea‚Äôs largest web portal). The petition received over 1.3 million signatures in two weeks. Agora users also proposed a candlelight festival to protest the beef-import agreement and demand Lee‚Äôs impeachment, mobilizing 15,000 participants at the first gathering on May 2, 2008. The street protests were characterized by increased participation by teenagers under the voting age of 19. When the government announced that it would crack down on the protest organizers, Internet users forged alliances and began the Campaign for Ten Million Arrests by mass-posting on the National Police Agency bulletin board. Lee apologized on May 22, 20 days after the first demonstration. Public discontent continued as the beef-import issue remained unresolved, however, and the candlelight demonstrations persisted. Young people were at the center of the Internet-born protests, transforming social movements through what author Jiyeon Kang calls \\"new democratic sensibilities\\". Korean youth in the post-authoritarian and neo-liberal era found casual political participation possible in cyberspace; because they grew up during the early expansion of Internet culture in Korea, they were technologically knowledgeable and accustomed to expressing opinions online. On Facebook, Myspace and popular portals such as Daum and Naver.com, youth constructed a collective identity and increased pressure on the government to keep their school lunches safe. === 2010 anti-Chosun Ilbo protest === The Twitter-based online community Chopae, was launched on May 11, 2010 to demand the closure of The Chosun Ilbo, a conservative newspaper; within half a year, 700 members had joined. The anti-Chosun Ilbo protest was rooted in the alternative media movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which was led by progressive groups who sought to challenge conservative media with online citizen journalism; OhmyNews is an example of a progressive online newspaper. Chopae was organized by a Twitter user known as @parknife (a previous supporter of President Roh Moo-hyun), who shared news and content in the online community with tweets criticizing the G20, Lee Myung-bak‚Äôs administration, conservative daily newspapers and Samsung with hashtags such as #chopaegongsa, #weapon and #change of government. Chopae members retweeted these messages and posted an online banner calling for a boycott of South Korea's three major national conservative newspapers (Chosun Ilbo, JoongAng Ilbo and The Dong-a Ilbo) and Samsung. Many tweets contained hyperlinks which led to more anti-Chosun Ilbo content. Chopae also engaged in culture jamming, circulating caricatures, satirical novels about Lee and parody videos. These online activities were accompanied by offline meetings which encouraged the solidification of Chopae identity. == Online feminist movements == Korean women have used the Internet to engage in feminist discourse since the 1990s, especially through female-dominated online communities where they \\"gained a sense of belonging ... through their conversations with strangers who emotionally supported, assisted, and comforted them, and took these collectives of women as reliable interlocutors to share information and knowledge\\". For young girls participating in South Korea's new feminist movements, the main objectives are dealing with urgent issues which directly impact them (such as gender violence) and voicing their demand for gender equality. Furthermore, compared with the pre-democratization era, the new generation of activists is not limited to university students; it also includes teenagers and women from a variety of backgrounds who have united under a feminist agenda. Online feminist groups primarily recruit protest participants in feminist Internet caf√©s and disseminate information on Twitter and Facebook with hashtags. On- and offline activism are connected, with protestors using specific words and phrases (such as \\"uncomfortable courage\\") which are search terms on Twitter to increase exposure of the movement. === #MeToo === Prosecutor Suh Ji-Hyeon spoke on live television about personal experiences of sexual harassment in 2008, increasing visibility for victims of sexual assault and sparking the #MeToo movement in South Korea. Suh was followed by a number of others who felt empowered to go public with their own stories, drawing more media attention and galvanizing young girls and women to participate in hashtag activism. The movement quickly gained momentum and expanded to the use of the hashtag #MeToo across the Internet and a series of protests, which led to legal and organizational reforms to address sexual violence. Students at over 65 South Korean schools spoke out in 2018 about sexual abuse by teachers using the hashtag #SchoolMeToo, identifying fundamental problems in the education system and building solidarity among victims. Although the movement led to criminal investigations at some schools, few of the accused teachers were charged due to lack of evidence. === Radical feminism === Megalia, an online radical-feminist group, emerged in May 2015 to oppose online misogynistic culture and mirror its male perpetrators of targeted violence against, and objectification of, women by ridiculing their content and writing style. The movement began during the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic, when female Internet users uploaded parody posts blaming Korean men for the epidemic to a MERS discussion board. As their posts spread across women‚Äôs online communities, other young women joined their fight against online misogyny and created the Megalia website. The Megalia movement focused on criticizing state patriarchy and advocating for the eradication of non-consensual digital pornography with strategies including \\"trolling, linguistic violence, parodies of misogynistic discourse, and flaming.\\" In a Megalia post entitled \\"Misogyny That Has Infiltrated [Korea] Like Air\\", its author discusses the pervasiveness of misogyny in South Korea and uses a derogatory term to refer to misogynistic Korean men. == Online LGBTQ movement == In Korea, online activism in support of legislative reform to prohibit discrimination against individuals based on sexual orientation has faced opposition from conservatives and Christian organizations. Without access to traditional media (and its public profile), many Korean LGBTQ groups have struggled to obtain sufficient publicity for their campaigns and generate discussion by the general public. Conservative Christian groups have extensive access to traditional media (such as Christian newspapers and television broadcasts) and Internet outlets, including blogs and online communities. Online Christian communities which campaign against the anti-discrimination law include the Anti-Homosexual Citizens‚Äô Action Headquarters and The Truth About Homosexuality. The Internet was a forum for discussion of the 2010 Korean television series Life is Beautiful, about a gay couple and the difficulties they face in coming out to their families. Shortly after it was aired, there was an increase in online discussion of same-sex relationships on Twitter and the Seoul Broadcasting System‚Äôs online message board. A tweet by gay Korean gay celebrity Hong Seok-cheon, who criticized an anti-gay advertisement in The Chosun Ilbo in response to the series, went viral and inspired a number of bloggers and Twitter users to support the LGBTQ community. == Effectiveness == The effectiveness of Internet activism is debated by scholars. Some studies have found that the Internet helps mobilize ordinary citizens for political activism and form collective identities, providing a space for open discussion of socio-political issues. The 2002 candlelight vigils are examples of the extension of online activism to street politics. Research also indicates that the rise of social networking services and video broadcasting websites (such as YouTube) have contributed to a decline in the level of repressive violence at protests. Other scholars are more skeptical about the effectiveness of the Internet in bringing real change to government policies; online LGBTQ activists, in particular, have made little progress in reforming legal institutions due to their lack of access to traditional media. Internet youth activism is perceived by some scholars as ephemeral and episodic, with no solid goals or organization, and the term \\"slacktivism\\" has been coined to criticize the lack of effort and engagement of online activism. == See also == * Internet activism * Feminism in South Korea * LGBT rights in South Korea == References == Category:Internet activism Category:Internet in South Korea ","title":"Internet activism in South Korea"},{"id":"60407403","text":"Padamsen Chaudhary is an Indian politician.

Per the Federal Register, the Office of Portfolio Analysis serves the following goals: # Prepare and analyze data on NIH sponsored biomedical research to inform trans- NIH planning and coordination; # Serve as a resource for portfolio management at the programmatic level; # Employ databases, analytic tools, methodologies and other resources to conduct assessments in support of portfolio analyses and priority setting in scientific areas of interest across NIH; # Research and develop new analytic tools, support systems, and specifications for new resources in coordination with other NIH organizations to enhance the management of the NIH's scientific portfolio; and # Provide, in coordination with other NIH organizations, training on portfolio analysis tools, procedures, and methodology. After its establishment in 2011, George Santangelo was appointed as the first Director of the Office of Portfolio Analysis. ==Analytic tools== ===NIH COVID-19 Portfolio=== In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Office of Portfolio Analysis developed the NIH COVID-19 Portfolio to index and track ongoing COVID-19 research and disseminate it to the public. This portfolio is curated by scientific experts for COVID-19 relevance, and includes both peer-reviewed publications indexed in PubMed and preprints from bioRxiv, medRxiv, chemRxiv, arXiv, SSRN, and Research Square. ===iCite=== The NIH developed iCite as a bibliometrics dashboard to freely disseminate article-level citation metrics for scientific publications that are indexed in PubMed. One stated purpose of this analytic tool was to replace the use of journal level metrics like the Journal Impact Factor in research assessment and portfolio analysis. Bulk data are made available through database snapshots and an API.As of 2020, iCite hosts three modules focusing on different types of citation metrics: ====Influence==== The research community called for the use of article-level citation metrics for research assessment instead of journal-level metrics, in the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment. The influence module of iCite disseminates field- and time-normalized article-level citation metrics like the Relative Citation Ratio. ====Translation==== Because the NIH is particularly focused on science that improves human health, it developed article-level metrics that track the dissemination of basic research findings into clinical research, a process known as bench to bedside translation. The Translation module of iCite shows which clinical research articles have cited a given publication. For those publicationthat are not yet cited by a clinical research article, the Translation module shows the Approximate Potential to Translate, which is a machine learning estimate of the probability that the publication will be cited by a clinical research article in the future. ====Citations==== In order to maximize transparency, the Office of Portfolio Analysis generated a public- domain citation graph named the NIH Open Citation Collection. This citation graph underpins all citation metrics disseminated in iCite, and sources citation data from several sources, as well as extracting references from the PDFs of open access articles. ==References== Category:National Institutes of Health Category:2011 establishments in the United States ","title":"Office of Portfolio Analysis"},{"id":"60407490","text":"Aliza Nisenbaum (born 1977, Mexico City) is a painter living and working in New York, NY. She is best known for her colorful paintings of Mexican and Central American immigrants. She is a professor at Columbia University's School of the Arts. == Education == Nisenbaum holds a BFA and an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. == Work == Nisenbaum's paintings consist of still lives, figures in interiors, and portraits. In 2012, Nisenbaum worked with artist Tania Bruguera on her ongoing project Immigrant Movement International in Queens, New York. The community-based project creates a space where immigrants can engage with contemporary art in an empowering way. Nisenbaum taught English to Mexican and Central American immigrants as part of the project, and also painted their portraits. Nisenbaum has since also become known for her group portraits. When on a residency at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, she painted group portraits of guards employed at the museum, which were then displayed in the exhibition A Place We Share. In 2015, after receiving a fellowship from the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs in New York City, Nisenbaum painted a group portrait of fifteen women who worked at the agency. The work is said to pay homage to Sylvia Sleigh's group portrait of A.I.R. Gallery members. Nisenbaum recently completed a residency in the London Underground as part of a UK public commission to paint portraits of members of the Transport for London staff. The resulting large-scale group portrait is displayed in London's Brixton Station. Nisenbaum has said that she is influenced by Mexican muralists such as Diego Rivera, and writer Amy Sherlock has suggested that Nisenbaum's work is a form of social practice. == Exhibitions == Nisenbaum has had solo exhibitions at White Columns, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Mary Mary Gallery in Glasgow, Illinois State University, and the Shane Campbell Gallery in Chicago, among others. She has participated in numerous group exhibitions, including at the Flag Art Foundation, Anton Kern Gallery, and the Norwich Castle Museum. Nisenbaum was included in the 2017 Whitney Biennial. She is represented by the Anton Kern Gallery in New York City and the Mary Mary Gallery in Scotland. Nisenbaum was selected to be a part of the Institute of Contemporary Art's \\"When Home Won't Let You Stay: Migration Through Contemporary Art.\\" The exhibition lasted from October 23rd, 2019-January 26, 2019 and consisted of a diverse range of media. Nisenbaum's contribution was a series of paintings, the largest of which was figures in an interior, titled \\"La Talaverita, Sunday Morning NY Times.\\" It depicts two individuals named Veronica and Gustavo splayed out on a couch reading the New York Times. The painting is named for the patterned tiles in the Talavera style that provide much of the background. Nisenbaum is interested in power through representation and the politics of visibility. == Recognition == Nisenbaum's work has been discussed in ArtForum, the Brooklyn Rail, Hyperallergic, the New York Times, and Vogue, among other publications. She has received awards from the Rema Hort Mann Foundation, the Sharpe Walentas Studio Program, and the NYC Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs.

She collected the works of Peter Straub, Stephen King, Shirley Jackson, Edgar Allan Poe, and Christopher Pike. Their favorite story is that of the kuchisake-onna. She describes themself as a pansexual, liberal atheist. Chupeco is also nonbinary and uses she/they pronouns. Prior to becoming an author, Chupeco worked as a graphic designer. She is married and lives with their husband and two children in Manila. == Selected works == Chupeco's works often draw inspiration from Asian cultures. The Girl from the Well Series Their debut novel The Girl from The Well tells the story of Okiku, a vengeful spirit who hunts for abusers and eats their souls, who finds herself in a battle with another evil spirit when she falls for Tark, the boy that the spirit is tethered to. It was published by Sourcebooks Fire in August 2014 and received a starred review from Publishers Weekly. Chupeco says that it was inspired by Japanese horror, particularly the works of Bancho Sarayashi, whose movies she rewatched multiple times prior to writing the book. With the novel Chupeco aimed to try a spin on the topic that had not been done before by making the ghost character the sympathetic anti-heroine. A companion novel, The Suffering, continues the story of Okiku and Tark as they travel the country to search for more people Okiku can kill. The Bone Witch Series The first novel in the series, The Bone Witch, follows Tea, a teen with the ability to raise the dead, who finds herself caught in a struggle for power as she explores her newfound abilities after she accidentally resurrects her late brother. Chupeco says that her writing often is very experimental, mixing different styles and themes, which led to her writing The Bone Witch in order to tell the story of characters in two different time periods. The Bone Witch series was inspired by Filipino witch doctors, mangkukulam, who are revered by the general public yet approached when in need of help, similar to the dark asha in her series. She also drew on Middle Eastern folklore and influences, like the Ayyubid dynasty and Wahhabism. The witch aspect was inspired by real-life geisha. The Bone Witch was published by Sourcebooks Fire in February 2017 and received starred reviews from Shelf Awareness and Publishers Weekly. In the sequel, The Heart Forger, published in February 2019, Tea finds herself bound to a mythical dragon-like creature and embarks on a quest to find a cure. It received starred reviews from Booklist and Foreword Reviews. In the last novel in the series, The Shadowglass, protagonist Tea faces off with her resurrected brother while searching for a way to make him immortal for good. It was published in March 2019. == Bibliography == Series The Girl from the Well # The Girl from the Well (Sourcebooks Fire, 2014) # The Suffering (Sourcebooks Fire, 2015) The Bone Witch # The Bone Witch (Sourcebooks Fire, 2017) # The Heart Forger (Sourcebooks Fire, 2018) #The Shadowglass (Sourcebooks Fire, 2019) The Never Tilting World # The Never Tilting World (HarperTeen, 2019) A Hundred Names for Magic # Wicked as You Wish (Sourcebooks Fire, 2020) Short stories * in Lauriat: A Filipino-Chinese Speculative Fiction Anthology (Lethe Press, 2012) * in Hungry Hearts: 13 Tales of Food & Love (Simon Pulse, 2019) * in His Hideous Heart (Flatiron, 2019) == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century Filipino writers Category:21st-century Chinese writers Category:Writers from Manila Category:Pansexual people ","title":"Rin Chupeco"},{"id":"60407654","text":"Peter Dunstan Hastings (1920‚Äì1990) was an Australian journalist and editor.

He saw action in the Second World War and rose to the rank of vice-admiral, despite being demoted three times in his career. Born in 1908, Kulakov initially began studying in Kiev for a career as a railway worker, before coming into contact with the navy through the local Komsomol. Joining the navy in 1932, he entered the political branch, serving as a military commissar on several vessels, before sitting on the Military Councils of the Northern and then the Black Sea Fleets. Serving on the Black Sea during the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Kulakov took part in planning the defences of the Black Sea ports, and when they were overwhelmed, the counterattacks. The heavy human cost of these brought the Military Council under investigation and Kulakov suffered his first demotion, from rear-admiral to captain 1st rank, and reassignment. Returned to useful work and restored to his former rank by the Navy's commander in chief, Nikolay Kuznetsov, Kulakov repaid Kuznetsov by acting as his prosecutor in a trial on charges of giving away military secrets, and succeeded in having Kuznetsov demoted. Kulakov himself was demoted shortly afterwards for \\"unsatisfactory leadership of party political work\\", but once more returned to prominence and former rank with service with the Black Sea Fleet. Implicated in the loss of the battleship Novorossiisk in 1955, Kulakov was demoted for a third time and transferred to the Baltic Fleet. Here he rebuilt his career in the navy's political department once more, returning to the rank of vice-admiral and being awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. He retired in 1971 and died in 1976. ==Early life== Kulakov was born on in Ivanovo, Kimovsky District, then part of Tula Governorate, in the Russian Empire. His father was a railway worker, and after graduating from school Nikolai Kulakov entered the Kiev school which trained workers for a locomotive repair plant. The plant's Komsomol sponsored ships of the Black Sea Fleet, and through this Kulakov became acquainted with the navy. He joined the Communist Party in 1927, was elected to the plant's party bureau and was then transferred to party work in Leningrad. alt= Kulakov joined the navy in August 1932 and studied at the , graduating in 1937. From July 1937 he was appointed military commissar of the Baltic Fleet submarines and then , followed by a posting as commissar in August 1938 to the battleship Marat. In June 1939 he became a member of the Military Council of the Northern Fleet. With tensions with Nazi Germany rising, and the German invasion of Norway in 1940, Kulakov was involved in the decision to transfer some of the Baltic Fleet's ships to the Northern Fleet for operations in the ice-free parts of the Barents Sea. In April 1940 Kulakov became a member of the Military Council of the Black Sea Fleet, and on 8 August 1940 was appointed a divisional commissioner. ==Great Patriotic War== The ruins of Sevastopol harbour after the city's capture by German forces. The failed defence, and subsequent losses in counterattacks, caused Kulakov's first fall from grace. With the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Kulakov was involved in planning the defence of the Black Sea Fleet's ports, and in organising counterattacks by Soviet Naval Aviation and units of the Danube Flotilla. He oversaw the activities of the political bodies and party organizations of the Black Sea Fleet during this time. With the German advance to the Black Sea, Kulakov helped to organise the preparation of defences for Odessa, and when that city fell, those of Sevastopol. The German campaign through the Crimea forced the Soviet forces back and in 1942 Sevastopol also fell. Kulakov helped in the evacuation, and flew out of the city on the last military aircraft. On 13 December 1942 divisional commissioners like Kulakov were ranked as rear admirals, and he was sent to Gelendzhik to assist in preparing counterattacks. Kulakov had a hand in organising the amphibious assaults against Novorossiysk, including that led by Caesar Kunikov, but the heavy losses sustained in the Kerch‚ÄìEltigen Operation brought official disapproval, and the Military Council was condemned as unsatisfactory. In January 1944, Kulakov was dismissed from his post and on 3 February 1944 was demoted to captain 1st rank. From March 1944 he served as head of the Navy's Higher military-political courses. With the help of the Navy's Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Nikolay Kuznetsov, Kulakov was in June 1944 appointed Head of the Department of Propaganda and Agitation of the Main Political Directorate, and restored to his rank of rear-admiral on 21 July 1944. In March 1945 he was again assigned to the Military Council of the Northern Fleet. He was promoted to the rank of vice-admiral and became deputy commander-in-chief of the Navy for political affairs. ==Postwar== In 1948 Kulakov, as deputy commander-in-chief of the Navy for political affairs, served as judge and public prosecutor at the trial of admirals Lev Galler, Vladimir Alafuzov, vice-admiral Georgy Stepanov and the navy's former commander-in-chief and the man who had restored him to his former position, Nikolay Kuznetsov. They were accused of passing military secrets to the UK and the USA. Kuznetsov recalled how \\"The voice of the prosecutor N. M. Kulakov, who had already called us all sorts of obscene words, still demanded that we be punished as strictly as possible.\\" Admiral Vladimir Kasatonov observed that \\"N. M. Kulakov, who Nikolai Gerasimovich [Kuznetsov] once saved from responsibility for blunders and mistakes in the most difficult times, was not only the correct ‚Äúwatchdog‚Äù for the accusations, but also tried to humiliate the personal dignity of the accused.\\" Kuznetsov was found guilty and demoted. The other admirals were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Despite Kulakov's loyal participation in the trial, in December 1949 he too was accused, this time of \\"unsatisfactory leadership of party political work in the 8th Fleet\\" and was again demoted to rear admiral and dismissed from his post. In January 1950 he enrolled at the KE Voroshilov Higher Military Academy, but in April he was recalled and re-appointed a member of the Military Council of the Black Sea Fleet and reinstated to the rank of vice-admiral. The battleship Novorossiisk moored in Sevastopol. Her loss in 1955 was another blight on Kulakov's career. Kulakov's career continued to be blighted by misfortune. In 1955 the battleship Novorossiisk, the former Italian Giulio Cesare, was destroyed by a sudden explosion while in port at Sevastopol. An old wartime German naval mine was considered the most likely explanation, but Kulakov was among those discredited in the affair. He was once more demoted to rear- admiral on 8 December 1955 and in May 1956 sent to serve as head of the political department and deputy political director of the Kronstadt naval fortress. He once more rose in the ranks, in 1960 he was reinstated as vice- admiral and in April became Commander of the Leningrad Naval District. From July 1961 he became Head of the Political Department of the Leningrad Naval Base and the Naval Educational Institutions of Leningrad. On 7 May 1965, the 20th anniversary of the victory over Germany, Kulakov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. He retired from the navy in December 1971, and died on 25 March 1976. He was buried in the Bogoslovskoe Cemetery in Leningrad. ==Awards and legacy== Udaloy-class destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov, underway in 2016 In addition to being awarded Hero of the Soviet Union, Kulakov was twice awarded the Order of Lenin, in 1942 and again in 1965, received two Orders of the Red Banner, in 1944 and 1953, the Order of Nakhimov, 1st Degree in 1945, and the Order of the Red Star in 1947. He also received various medals, and a ceremonial weapon in 1958. A memorial plaque to Kulakov was installed on the building of the Kiev Higher Vocational School of Railway Transport where he had studied, and a street in Sevastopol was named after him. He was further honoured after his death with the naming of the Udaloy- class destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov, launched in 1980. His writings include Life of the Fleet/Guardian of the Baltic (, Zhizn flotu/Strazh Baltiki ‚Äì 1963), 250 Days in the Fire (, 250 dnei v ogne ‚Äì 1965), and his posthumously published memoirs Entrusted to the Fleet (, Dovereno flotu ‚Äì 1985). ==References== ==External links== * Category:1908 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Burials at Bogoslovskoe Cemetery Category:People from Kimovsky District Category:Soviet admirals Category:Soviet historians Category:Russian military writers Category:20th-century historians Category:Soviet military personnel of the Winter War Category:Soviet military personnel of World War II Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of Nakhimov, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner ","title":"Nikolai Kulakov"},{"id":"60407663","text":"Lloyd Robson's headstone at the old cemetery in Penguin, Tasmania Leslie Lloyd Robson (1931-1990) was an Australian historian and academic at the University of Melbourne.

From 1539, he is attested at the private botanical gardens of Luca Ghini in Bologna and in 1544 in Pisa. In 1546, he was the first director of the Botanical Gardens in Padua. There he remained until 1561, when an argument with the botanists Ulisse Aldrovandi (Director of the Orto Botanico di Bologna) and Pietro Andrea Mattioli led him to depart for Ferrara, where he served as Botanist of the Duke of Ferrara and continued his travels. Anguillara ranged widely over Greece, Italy, France, and Asia Minor and developed a very detailed knowledge of Mediterranean plants as a result. He may also have taught medicine in Ferrara and he probably died there from the plague. Anguillara is known for his sole work, Semplici, which was written between 1549 and 1560. It describes 1,540 plants, their medicinal properties, and where they are found. The descriptions are clear enough that historians are able to identify most of the plants described by him. He also provides bibliographic notes and alternative names. The work drew on the De Materia Medica of Pedanius Dioscorides and other ancient authors and is divided into fourteen chapters, each dedicated to a contemporary Italian doctor.

Between 1934 and 1951, he undertook part-time architecture studies, before switching to town planning studies, while working as a draftsman at AGL, the Commonwealth Department of the Interior, Commonwealth Department of Works and Housing, and the Cumberland County Council. He was appointed senior lecturer in town planning at the University of Sydney in 1951. Harrison was a member of the Royal Australian Planning Institute committee which argued in a submission to the Senate Select Committee on the Development of Canberra in 1955 that the Griffin Plan for the national capital should be adopted. == Professional life in Canberra == The Menzies Government established the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) in 1958, and in early 1959 appointed Harrison its first Chief Town Planner. From this position Harrison strongly advocated for development consistent with the Griffin Plan developed by Walter Burley Griffin. Harrison devised the 'Y plan', adopted by NCDC in 1967, which allowed for the expansion of Canberra consistent with the preservation of the open character of a city separated by bushland. In 1967 Harrison was appointed Senior Research Fellow at the Urban Research Unit at the Australian National University in Canberra. ANU Urban Research Unit colleague Pat Troy recalled one of Harrison's tools, in response to challenging planning proposals, was to apply the \\"mother test\\", \\"Would my mother live in it?\\". Fellow Urban Research Unit colleague Max Neutze described Harrison's influence there as \\"pervasive\\" with many theses and publications produced by staff and students there influenced by him. \\"Peter believed strongly that large city centres were inefficient creations of speculative development,\\" Neutze wrote. \\"He always insisted that development should serve the needs of people, not just line the pockets of investors.\\" The Papers of Peter Harrison are held at the National Library of Australia, Canberra. The suburb of Harrison, ACT, is named in his honour. He was awarded a life fellowship of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1971, which he resigned in 1990 in protest at the RAIA ACT Chapter's position on Canberra's development. He was awarded life membership of the Royal Institute of Planning Australia in 1979. He was awarded an AM in 1980, which he returned in 1985 in protest against trends in Canberra's development. To the end he was a staunch advocate of the Griffin plan and intervened publicly to defend it. == Selected publications == * Post-war planning in the capital cities of the mainland states (Canberra: Metropolitan Research Trust, 1972). * Walter Burley Griffin, Landscape Architect (Canberra: National Library of Australia, 1995). == References == Category:1918 births Category:1990 deaths Category:University of Sydney faculty Category:Australian urban planners Category:Former Members of the Order of Australia ","title":"Peter Harrison (city planner)"},{"id":"60407752","text":"Ekaterine Meiering-Mikadze Ekaterine Meiering-Mikadze () is a Georgian diplomat born in 1967.

Kiddle died on 3 May 1958 at Richmond, Melbourne. She spent her last moments working on the manuscript of what would, after her death, be published as Men of Yesterday. This posthumous masterpiece is considered her best memorial. The idea of writing this book came in 1949 from a family friend suggestion for her to write about the Western District. Kiddle was mesmerised about the idea of answering questions about the settlers' origins and colonial experiences by having access to their diaries and letters. She worked on the manuscript on and off throughout her life. She planned to write other books, but by 1957 was too ill to begin other projects.

As a leading historian, he wrote the book Industrial Labour and Politics, which examined the Australian labour politics. == Early life == Ian Turner was born on 10 March 1922 at East Malvern, Melbourne. His parents were Francis Herbert Blackley Turner, a wheat farmer, and Nina Florence, n√©e Lang. He attended Nhill State School, Geelong College, and the University of Melbourne (LL.B., 1948; B.A., 1949)., where he was exposed to political debates on topics about the Spanish Civil War, fascism, and communism. == Military service == In 1942, he served in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) at various headquarters as a driver. After he was demoted from lance corporal to private for insubordination, he remained attached to headquarters, I Corps, as an acting corporal in the Australian Army Education Service. On 7 February 1945, he was discharged from the AIF, and later returned to university. == Activism in the university == After military service, Turner returned to the University of Melbourne, where he became co- editor of the student union publication, Farrago, and joint-secretary of the Labour Club. He studied history and politics under Max Crawford, Percy Partridge and Manning Clark. Marxism became highly influential to his thought, while he began his lifelong exploration of the left in Australian politics and society. He spent remarkable years with the Communist Party. He became secretary of Australian Peace Council in 1949, the organised anti-war conferences in Australia. Later, the Communist Party gave him \\"proletarian industrial experience\\" as a railway cleaner, where he became part of the Australian Railways Union. After finding his expectations \\"absurdly romantic\\", the railway sacked him in 1952. During the Soviet Union's suppression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956, he protested against it, particularly the execution of then Hungarian premier Imre Nagy. This opposition led to his expulsion from the Communist Party in 1958. Despite his expulsion, Ian was a committed communist. In a special issue of Overland in 1956, he wrote to W. J. Brown that while criticism was essential in a living, vigorous party, it often came to be \\"only criticism of the means of fulfilling an already decided policy\\". What was most important was that it should not become \\"a substitute for serious discussion of basic questions of our policy and our theory ... we've all got a stake in our party and the sort of future it's trying to build in Australia\\". == As a historian == Turner took Ph.D. studies in the Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University (Ph.D., 1963). In his thesis he examined crucial questions surrounding the labour movement eastern Australia during the period 1900‚Äì1921. This thesis later was developed into his most important intellectual work, Industrial Labour and Politics. Moreover, the book focused on the internal politics surrounding the labour movement, as well as its most important moments, such as the general strike of 1917, and the split of the Labour Party over conscription. == References == Category:1922 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Australian National University alumni Category:Communist Party of Australia members ","title":"Ian Turner (Australian political activist)"},{"id":"60407788","text":"Abdelkrim Baadi (born 14 April 1996) is a Moroccan professional footballer who plays as a leftback for HUSA and the Morocco national football team. ==International career== Baadi made his professional debut for the Morocco national football team in a 0-0 tie with Malawi on 22 March 2019, in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification match. ==ReferencesCategory:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Agadir Category:Moroccan footballers Category:Morocco international footballers Category:Hassania Agadir players Category:Botola players Category:Association football fullbacks Category:2019 Africa Cup of Nations players ","title":"Abdelkrim Baadi"},{"id":"60407791","text":"≈†tƒõp√°n Matek (born 14 May 1987) is a Czech politician and former deputy chairman of the Christian and Democratic Union ‚Äì Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-ƒåSL).

Her father was Frank Samuel Donnison. She was educated at Wycombe Abbey, a renowned independent school for girls, and went on to study sculpture at the Slade School of Fine Art, at the University of London. She met her future husband Kenneth Bailey, a Rhodes Scholar from Melbourne, through her brother Vernon Donnison, who was at Corpus Christi College, Oxford with him. Despite the ill feelings of her mother, Yseult Bailey married Kenneth Bailey on 12 August 1925 at Queen's College Chapel at the University of Melbourne. Living in Melbourne in the 1930s and early 1940s, and mother of three sons, Yseult Bailey was active in the Kindergarten Union of Victoria, the establishment of the Lady Gowrie Centre for pre-school education and the University Women's Wartime Nursery. During World War II the family moved to Canberra, where Kenneth Bailey was Consultant to the Commonwealth Government and later head of the Attorney-General's Department. Yseult Bailey became active in the movement to establish a kindergarten in Canberra. In 1942 she was a member of an unsuccessful delegation to the Minister for Health and Social Services, E. J. Holloway, seeking the establishment of a nursery school in Canberra to free mothers for war work. After the focus changed to seeking provision of a nursery kindergarten, Yseult Bailey and two other members of the deputation were invited to Government House to advise Lady Gowrie on the progress of the project. Following this meeting, Yseult Bailey was appointed president of a provisional pre-school committee. She continued in this role when the Canberra Nursery Kindergarten Society (later the Canberra Pre-School Society) was formally constituted in November 1943. Yseult Bailey was prominent in the formation of the Australian Pre-School Association, served as president, was made a life member and remained an honorary life vice-president until her death.

Frank Lade  relatives =  family =  awards =  footnotes = }} Phyllis Evelyn Duguid (16 October 1904 ‚Äì 9 March 1993), n√©e Lade, was an Australian teacher and Aboriginal rights and women's activist, who was highly regarded for her long-term commitment to those she saw as members of an underclass in society. She was married to, and often worked alongside, Charles Duguid, medical practitioner and Aboriginal rights campaigner, the couple leading much of the work on improving the lives of Aborigines in South Australia in the mid-twentieth century. She founded the League for the Protection and Advancement of Aboriginal and Half-Caste Women, which later became the Aborigines' Advancement League of South Australia (AALSA). The Duguids' legacies include the Duguid Indigenous Endowment Fund at The Australian National University and the Biennial Duguid Memorial Lecture series (held in alternate years at the University of South Australia and Flinders University). == Early life and education == The third child of six children, Duguid was born on 16 October 1904 at Hawthorn, Melbourne, Australia. Her father, Frank Lade (1868-1948), was a Methodist clergyman, who travelled extensively to give lectures to members of the temperance movement.Duguid, Phyllis. Interview by Mary Hutchison, 13 August 1982. Transcript. Australian Federation of University Women Oral History Project. State Library of South Australia The family moved to Adelaide in 1911, and Phyllis attended Miss Henderson's school for girls, and then Methodist Ladies' College (later Annesley College). Duguid's mother Lillian Frances (n√©e Millard) strongly supported her daughter's study of Classics and English language and literature at the University of Adelaide (BA Hons, 1925), saying that \\"she wouldn‚Äôt allow any of us just to stay home and be what was called a homegirl, until we had done something else\\". Duguid worked briefly as an English tutor at the university, later became a senior English teacher at the Presbyterian Girls' College in Adelaide (now Seymour College), and married the medical doctor Charles Duguid on 18 December 1930 at the Methodist Church, Kent Town, South Australia. They had a son and a daughter. == Advocacy for women and Indigenous Australians == Duguid \\"epitomized the strength of gentleness\\" and co-promoted Charles' passion for the cause of Aboriginal justice, was a prominent activist for the welfare of Aboriginal women in her own right and edited Charles' writings. Together, they were described as being \\"a very powerful force\\". Duguid was inspired to campaign for Indigenous issues after hearing from one of Charles' patients about the poor conditions in central and northern Australia, and the widely reported Tuckiar v The King case in 1934, in which an unfair conviction against a Yolngu man (Dhakiyarr) in the Northern Territory seven months earlier was overturned by the High Court of Australia. She heard about her husband's trip to the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands in 1935, and supported his proposal to create the Ernabella Mission. ===League for the Protection and Advancement of Aboriginal and Half-Caste Women=== After a trip to Central Australia in 1938 with the president of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, W.E. Eaton, Duguid formed the League for the Protection and Advancement of Aboriginal and Half-Caste Women, consisting of group of non- Aboriginal women representing Christian and other women's organisations, the first of its kind in Australia. Duguid was the founding president of the League, and an active member of several committees, including the Equality Committee of the League of Women Voters. Within its first year of operation, the League had 205 members, with a core group of 20 women who formed the executive running the organisation. Its first main goal was \\"to establish and maintain a welfare and recreational centre in Alice Springs for Aboriginal and half-caste women and girls, in order that the need for the provision of such centres be demonstrated\\". Defending this work in the face of criticism from Rev. J.H. Sexton of the Aborigines' Friends' Association, Duguid said that the work her group proposed was essentially women's work, for women and by women. The Alice Springs centre was envisaged as a social centre, where both Aboriginal and mixed-descent girls and women could improve themselves and raise their status, and also obtain protection from exploitation or abuse of any kind if necessary. There were also plans for a residential hostel. The scheme showed the League's commitment to assimilation, exceeding anything proposed by the federal government at that time. Although the federal government viewed the idea positively, plans for the social and recreational centre were interrupted by priorities demanded by the advent of World War II. When the Aborigines' Protection League disbanded in 1946, it donated its remaining funds to the women's organisation, which then opened membership to men and became known as the Aborigines' Advancement League of South Australia (AALSA) in 1950. The evolution of these groups showed a shift in emphasis from protection to advancement. ===Other activities=== Duguid described herself as a \\"Christian socialist\\". In 1944 she fostered a six-year-old Aboriginal boy, Sydney James Cook, who had been enrolled at King's College, Adelaide, and who lived with the family until 1950, when the Duguids decided that he would be better off growing up in an Aboriginal community, and sent him to Roper River in the Northern Territory. In 1946‚Äì7 she actively supported Charles in his campaign against the creation of a rocket firing range at Woomera, South Australia. She and Charles were prominent in AALSA, and her work was instrumental in organising the meeting at the Adelaide Town Hall in 1953 which gave the floor to five Aboriginal people (George Rankin, Mona Paul, Peter Tilmouth, Ivy Mitchell, and Geoff Barnes) and resulted in the creation of the Wiltja Hostel for Aboriginal secondary school students in the suburb of Millswood. She continued to take a close interest in the Hostel, and the couple once hosted 34 of the girls at their home over six weeks. Duguid was active in the League of Women Voters of South Australia, becoming its final president in 1979 as well as holding other offices prior to this. She was chairperson of the first meeting of the Status of Women Council in South Australia. She was an executive member of the WCTU and the Women's Non-Party Political Association, and board member of the South Australian government's Children's Welfare and Public Relief Board for many years. ==Writing and speaking== Duguid had a flair for writing and public speaking, enriched by a love of literature. She wrote and spoke on issues such as equal pay for equal work, temperance, prison reform, and prostitution. In 1937 she wrote a pamphlet called A brief account of the Smith of Dunesk Bequest, about the bequest, comprising property in South Australia, left by Scotswoman Henrietta Smith in 1893, specifically for the benefit of Aboriginal people, which led to the foundation of the Smith of Dunesk Mission in Beltana. (Husband Charles wrote a letter to The Advertiser in 1948 which gives some details of the bequest, including that attempts had been made to divert the money from Aboriginals, and that three-quarters of the proceeds were to be used for the work of the Presbyterian Church among the aborigines at Ernabella.) She wrote a booklet entitled The Economic Status of the Homemaker in 1944, in which she advocated \\"homes founded on the true partnership of men and women who are free, equal and interdependent\\", that \\"the political emancipation of women can never be complete so long as a large proportion of them are economically dependent\\", and argued for paying wages to homemakers. She gave a talk arranged by the Marriage Guidance Council in 1953, in which she said it was important for young people to \\"realise the hardships involved in the unequal economic status of a husband and wife\\" and to plan accordingly. ==Later life, honours, legacy== Duguid was known as Kungka (woman) by Pitjantjatjara people. In the 1987 Australia Day Honours Duguid received the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for service to Aboriginal welfare. She died on 9 March 1993 at Linden Park and her ashes were buried next to those of her husband at the Ernabella Mission Cemetery. The Duguid Indigenous Endowment Fund was created at the Australian National University by Rosemary and Bob Douglas (the Duguids' daughter and son-in-law) and Dr Andrew Duguid (their son). The Duguid Travelling Scholarship is enabled by an endowment made in 2002 to the ANU's Endowment for Excellence by Andrew Duguid and Rosemary Douglas in recognition of their parents' contribution. In 1994, the Aborigines Advancement League made a large donation to the University of South Australia and Flinders University, to provide study grants for Aboriginal graduates and to conduct a memorial lecture every two years. The Biennial Duguid Memorial Lecture (held alternate years at the University of South Australia and Flinders University) is held in honour of Charles and Phyllis Duguid. == References == == Further reading== * - detailed description and analysis of the Duguids' fostering of Sydney, including notes on his later life.

She works with multiple mediums to convey the sense of light and color in its original form. She has had multiple exhibits and is in a group called the DIALOGUISTAS, a group consisting of three members that work in Detroit Michigan. == Biography== Graciela Bustos is a Colombian multi-media artist that moved to the United States to study. She received an Associate in liberal arts in 1998 from Oakland Community College, Michigan and then went to get a B.F.A degree from Eastern Michigan University in 1990 before going to the Center of Creative Studies at Pontiac, Michigan in 1992. == Artworks== While known for her mixed media style, her painting, sculpting are her strong points. Her works contain colors and pigments that are reminiscent of French Impressionism. The versatility of her works is shown in her many solo pieces and in her group efforts with the DIALOGUISTAS. She has had multiple exhibitions showcasing her multi media work and is currently working on photography. A lot of her works create a sense of controlled abstract expressionism and reflect a controlled chaos. Her amazement by the idea of light and the idea of it illuminating and creating shadows is also a theme that is prominent in her works. Alpha, Omega, Alpha (2004) This piece is a mixed media piece that uses a large amount of space to display a layout of ashes on the ground with a sound of mumbles in the background and the smell of charred. It also contains platforms made out of newspaper. It is meant to display the idea of the difference in classes and manipulation of the media along with the idea that the piece itself can resist that manipulation. Mother (1994) This piece uses acrylic on a 47x47 in. canvas to depict what looks like a female figure surrounded by splattered paint. The controlled manner of the painting along with the flow of the paint on the canvas combines to make a harmony between control and freedom. Bustos' common theme of life in her work is portrayed in its purest form through a mother as she is surrounded by color after color. This piece reflects abstract expressionism art through its several layers of pigment and multiple color sequences that are intermingled yet retain its singularity. Cross (1994) This mixed media piece, which is 75x42x36 in. deals with the theme of a cross as it contains a black vertical post with an electric guitar intersecting it near the top. This piece shows a simple view of the cross while also being reminiscent of assemblage. This sculpture is meant to depict death and blood, the black post representing the dark endless death and the guitar representing blood and how the two remain related one to the other. Building with Knowledge (1994) This piece is a structure, 52x45x9 in., made entirely of books stacked in three interwoven vertical rows. It depicts Bustos' versatility in terms of her works while showing the diverse approaches she has. This sense of controlled abstraction is evident in this piece along with others as the interweaving of the books shows a complex form of the books and reflects the ability of retaining information. ==Exhibitions== === Juried exhibitions === *Creative Arts Center, Pontiac, Michigan.

He is currently the manager of the Seattle University Redhawks and part of the broadcasting team for Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer. ==Playing career== Fewing graduated from Highline High School in Burien, Washington, where he led the team to a state championship in his senior year. After briefly attending Green River Community College, Fewing played for two seasons as a member of the University of Washington Huskies team from 1983 to 1984. He spent most of his freshman season as a substitute player, but broke away to become a regular starter under coach Denny Buck as a goalscoring midfielder. Fewing then entered professional soccer and spent six seasons with FC Seattle Storm of the Western Soccer Alliance from 1985 to 1990, appearing in more matches than any other player for the club. Fewing described his performances with the Storm as being \\"very average\\", noting that he was \\"never a key, star player\\". He later played several games for the indoor team Everett BigFoot in 1995. ==Managerial career== Fewing began coaching youth soccer while playing for the Storm, establishing an annual local soccer camp in 1981 and taking several teams to national tournaments in the 1980s. After a failed tryout with the Tacoma Stars, he accepted an offer to coach the Seattle University Chieftains in 1988, taking over a program that had a losing record in eight consecutive seasons. Fewing led the Chieftains to a winning record in his second season as coach and was named NAIA Division I coach of the year in 1991. The Chieftains won their first national championship in 1997 under Fewing, defeating the Rockhurst Hawks in the NAIA Men's Soccer Championship after going undefeated in 27 matches. The Chieftains, renamed the Redhawks, became an NCAA Division II program in 2000 and joined the Pacific West Conference alongside rivals Seattle Pacific University, coached by Cliff McCrath. In addition to earning winning records in Division II, the Redhawks also played in non-conference matches against NCAA Division I teams and won upsets over the Washington Huskies and Portland Pilots in 2003. Fewing led the team to an undefeated season in 2004, amassing 22 wins and one draw on their way to an NCAA Division II championship. Fewing was named the NCAA Division II National Coach of the Year, Far West Region Coach of the Year, and Great Northwest Athletic Conference Coach of the Year for the team's performance in 2004. In February 2006, Fewing announced his resignation from the Redhawks after 18 seasons as head coach, due to a disagreement with the university's athletic director over payments for assistant coaches and other issues. The athletic director resigned a month later, but Fewing declined to return to the program and was replaced by Brad Agoos. Fewing devoted more time to his youth soccer camps, including the development of a new youth soccer facility in North Bend that attracted controversy due to alleged preferential treatment by the county government. Fewing joined the broadcasting team for Seattle Sounders FC, a new Major League Soccer franchise, for their inaugural season in 2009 as a television and radio analyst. He was an assistant coach for the Tacoma Tide of the Premier Development League and served as a youth coach for Washington Crossfire alongside his broadcasting duties. Fewing was named the executive director of the Seattle chapter of America SCORES, a literacy and sports organization, shortly after leaving the Redhawks. Fewing also co-authored a book, Coaching Principles for the Development of Championship Teams, with assistant coach Herbert L. Hoffman. Fewing was hired in November 2009 as the head coach of the Kitsap Pumas of the Premier Development League on a two- season contract. In his two seasons with the Pumas, he led the team to a 32‚Äì6‚Äì5 record and won the league championship in 2011. The Pumas also reached the third round of the U.S. Open Cup, where the team lost to the Sounders‚Äîhis other employer. During the Open Cup match, Fewing prepared materials for the broadcasting team but did not participate in commentary. Fewing declined to continue as coach of the Pumas due to the commute and his broadcasting duties. Fewing returned to the Redhawks in 2012 after reconciling with the team after their dispute over paying of assistant coaches. The team won its first Division I title in 2013 and has enjoyed several successful seasons since his return. Fewing earned his 300th win as head coach at the collegiate level in October 2018. Fewing was awarded a Golden Scarf by the Sounders in 2010 and was inducted into the Washington Youth Soccer Hall of Fame in 2019. ==Personal life== Fewing is a Catholic and was a youth minister, while his brother is a priest. He lives with his wife, Patty, in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, where they also raised two sons and one daughter. Fewing has also officiated several weddings for former Redhawks players. ==References== ==External links== * Seattle University bio Category:1960s births Category:Living people Category:Association football midfielders Category:Highline High School alumni Category:People from Burien, Washington Category:Seattle Sounders FC non- playing staff Category:University of Washington alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:USL League Two coaches Category:Seattle Redhawks men's soccer Category:American soccer coaches ","title":"Pete Fewing"},{"id":"60408040","text":"≈†√°rka Jel√≠nkov√° (born 24 January 1968) is a Czech politician and social worker who has been Senator from Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ since March 2016.

She was a key member of the Chinese national team that won the 1981 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup and the 1982 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship. After retiring as a player in 1983, she served as assistant coach and later team manager for the national team, and as head coach for the national women's junior team. She later became Director of the Culture and Sports Bureau of the People's Liberation Army General Political Department and was awarded the rank of major general, making her the only Chinese sportsperson to become a military general. Chen suffered from cancer and died in 2013 at the age of 57. == Early life == Chen was born on 15 April 1955 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. She studied at Hangzhou No. 10 High School. In December 1970, she was selected to play for the Zhejiang Provincial Women's Volleyball Team at the age of 15. == Career == === Volleyball === In 1973, Chen was selected into the People's Liberation Army's Bayi Volleyball Team. In June 1979, she suffered an injury in an Asian Club Championship game against Japan's Hitachi Team and fractured the radial bone in her left arm. Two months later, she played for the Bayi team in the Fourth National Games of China with her left arm wrapped in bandage, henceforth earning the nickname \\"One-armed General\\". In 1976, Chen was selected by China women's national volleyball team to play as a setter. Coached by Yuan Weimin, the team won its first Asian championship in 1979. In 1981, the team won the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup for the first time, and Chen played a key role in that victory, together with her teammate and close friend Lang Ping. The following year, the team won the 1982 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship in Peru. The team won three more world titles in the next four years and its members were hailed as national heroes in China. Chen retired in 1983 as a player and was an assistant coach for the team when it won the gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Beginning in 1983, she studied at Beijing Institute of Physical Education. In 1986, Chen became the head coach of China's national junior team, which won the bronze medal at the 1987 Women's Junior Volleyball World Championships. However, she was diagnosed with cancer in 1988 and had to leave the post. After undergoing cancer treatment, she joined the reorganized national women's volleyball team in 1989 and served as team manager until 1992. In 1993, she became Vice President of the Chinese Volleyball Association. === Military === In 1993, Chen joined the Culture and Sports Bureau of the People's Liberation Army General Political Department (GPD). She was later promoted to director of the bureau and deputy chief of the GPD's publicity department, and was awarded the rank of major general in July 2006. She is the only Chinese sportsperson to become a military general. In that capacity, she made the decision to allow the basketball star Wang Zhizhi to return to play in China. Wang, a former player of the military's Bayi Rockets team, had reneged on his promise to join the Chinese national team in order to play in the National Basketball Association in the United States, and many had wanted to punish him by forbidding him to play again in China after the end of his NBA career. == Personal life == On 1 April 2013, Chen died in Beijing from cancer, at the age of 57. Her parents, two older sisters and a younger brother had all died from cancer. Nearly 1,000 people attended her funeral at the Babaoshan People's Cemetery. Chen's story was written into middle-school textbooks in China. == References == == External links == * Chen Zhaodi at WomenofChina.cn * Chen Zhaodi at fivb.org Category:1955 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Chinese volleyball coaches Category:Chinese women's volleyball players Category:Sportspeople from Hangzhou Category:Volleyball players from Zhejiang Category:Female army generals Category:People's Liberation Army generals from Zhejiang Category:Deaths from cancer in the People's Republic of China Category:Beijing Sport University alumni Category:Asian Games medalists in volleyball Category:Volleyball players at the 1978 Asian Games Category:Volleyball players at the 1982 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1978 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1982 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Asian Games silver medalists for China ","title":"Chen Zhaodi"},{"id":"60408046","text":"Dane Fischer (born September 20, 1979) is an American basketball coach who is currently the head coach of the William & Mary Tribe men's basketball team. ==Playing career== Fischer played college basketball at Ithaca College, where he graduated in the top 10 in career steals and assists while helping guide the Bombers to an NCAA Tournament appearance. ==Coaching career== Upon graduation, Fischer entered the coaching ranks, taking an assistant coaching position at Williams College under Dave Paulsen, where the Ephs reached the national championship game of the 2004 NCAA Division III Tournament.

The Revolution of 1719 led to the permanent end of proprietary rule in South Carolina and its 1720 recreation as a crown colony. ==Background== Between 1663 and 1665, Charles II of England granted the Province of Carolina to eight non-resident proprietary lords. European settlement of the area, however, was limited to Charleston and what later was called Albemarle County, the two places being geographically non-contiguous. By 1710 the two regions had effectively ceased operating as a single political entity, resulting in the creation of the Province of North Carolina ‚Äì composed of the area centered around Albemarle County ‚Äì and the Province of South Carolina. By 1719, South Carolinian legislative authority was vested in a bicameral body composed of the popularly elected Commons House of Assembly sitting as a lower chamber, and the Grand Council of the Lords Proprietors, which functioned both as an upper chamber and as a collegiate executive, though its day-to-day powers were exercised by a governor it appointed. Governance of South Carolina by the proprietary lords has been characterized as ineffective and erratic. Their failure to adequately prepare for defense of the colony during the Yamasee War created further strain between the people and the London-based proprietors. ==Revolution== In November 1719 word arrived in Charleston of an approaching Spanish fleet; the colonial militia was ordered mobilized to repel an anticipated invasion. On November 17, prior to the militia muster, several prominent residents of South Carolina ‚Äì among them militia officer Colonel James Moore, Jr. and Arthur Skeene, the Speaker of the Commons House of Assembly ‚Äì met and formed a committee for the purpose of the overthrow of the government. The committee made contact with senior officers of the militia and secured their support. Upon learning of the unfolding conspiracy, Governor Robert Johnson ordered the Commons House of Assembly dissolved. On December 21 the coup occurred; following the assembly's formal dissolution, its members reconvened in a tavern and declared themselves a \\"convention of the people\\" with penultimate political authority in South Carolina. Moore was elected to the office of provisional governor and the legislative role of the Grand Council replaced with a new chamber appointed by the revolutionary committee. Johnson, deposed as governor, was unable to resist as the whole of the militia ultimately sided with the plotters. As a result, the coup passed without fighting or bloodshed. Among the revolutionary government's first orders of business was to petition the Crown to withdraw the proprietary charter of South Carolina and recreate it as a royal colony instead. By the following year, the revolutionary government's wishes were granted and direct, royal rule established. While the revolutionary government requested that Moore continue as royal governor, Francis Nicholson was instead installed by royal appointment. ==Aftermath== After surrendering the government to Nicholson, Moore served as Speaker of the Commons House of Assembly until his death in 1724. Royal rule effectively ended in South Carolina on March 26, 1776, when the colony unilaterally declared itself a republic and elected John Rutledge as the first President of South Carolina. The following July it ratified the United States Declaration of Independence. The governor of the neighboring North Carolina would continue to be appointed by the Lords Proprietor until 1729. ==See also== * History of South Carolina * Proprietary colony * South Carolina National Guard * Sword of State of South Carolina ==References== Category:1719 in North America Category:Colonial South Carolina Category:Conflicts in 1719 Category:Military coups in the United States ","title":"Revolution of 1719"},{"id":"60408420","text":"Dating back to the California mission era, the pioneering Cordova family were the first settlers in the area near present-day Castaic, California. The family ancestry was a mixture of Native American and European blood lines. The family has played a notable role in the early history of southern California. ==Jes√∫s C√≥rdova== The progenitor of the family line, Jes√∫s C√≥rdova, was born in M√°tasan, Sonora (Mexico). Jes√∫s immigrated to California and worked as a vaquero (cowboy) for the priests at Mission San Fernando.The Indians of Mission San Fernando by John R.

Fr√©mont over Tehachapi Pass in 1844 during one of Fr√©mont's famous expeditions that mapped the Western frontier. Known as \\"the pathfinder\\", Fr√©mont's explorations encouraged Americans to migrate and settle in the west. Jes√∫s C√≥rdova also acted as a scout for the U.S. Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846. Jes√∫s C√≥rdova later worked for Fr√©mont's scout, Alexis Godey, who had acted as guide for John C. Fr√©mont's expedition through the Kern County area in 1843‚Äì44. Alexis Godey had met Jes√∫s C√≥rdova while Fr√©mont was camped on Caliente Creek, and meet him again in 1850.Historical Overview of Los Padres National Forest by E. R. Blakley and Karen Barnette, July 1985, page 26 Godey asked C√≥rdova about vacant lands in the area, and C√≥rdova showed Godey the Cuyama No. 2 Land Grant (later the Russell Ranch). With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that existing land grants would be honored. The Cuyama section had been granted in 1842 but was in dispute by 1852. Alexis Godey squatted on the land and Jes√∫s C√≥rdova went to work for him as his majordomo. It took over 20 years for the Lataillade heirs to establish title to the land grant during which time Alexis Godey had built an adobe house and was running large herds of cattle. When the title was finally resolved in 1879, Alexis Godey was forced to vacate the property. ==Tejon Ranch== Jes√∫s and Mar√≠a Antonia C√≥rdova left Cuyama to live and work on the Tejon Ranch.

Army records state he \\"Died of Wounds June 18, 1945.\\" Johnny was initially buried at Okinawa, but his body was exhumed and moved to the Ruiz-Perea Family Cemetery in San Francisquito Canyon. Patrick Cordova served in 163rd Infantry Division, William Cordova served with 101st Airborne, Michael Cordova trained at Ford Ord and was sent to the Aleutian Islands, Rudolph (\\"Rudy\\") Cordova also trained at Fort Ord and transferred to Fort Lee, Virginia. He became a driver for a Colonel Dalton who recognized that he had four brothers serving in combat. Since his brother John had been killed in action, the Colonel made sure Rudy was not deployed overseas. The oldest Cordova brother, Ignacio, known as \\"Natch\\" was not drafted due to medical issues and because he was married with a family to support. Natch worked with the Forest Service. Lawrence Cordova was not drafted because he was the last of the Cordova brothers who could manage their family ranch. ==St. Francis Dam disaster== Rosa Cordova was pregnant with her youngest son, Rudolph, when the St. Francis Dam failed on 12 March 1928. She was among those who helped identify the bodies of victims recovered in the wake of the disaster. Ignacio Cordova found the body of a school friend lodged in a treetop beside the Santa Clara River bed. According to family lore, the victim's apparent death rattle, which Ignacio described as a hiccup sound, had attracted the searchers' attention. ==Castaic Dam== Through eminent domain, the government resumed about a thousand acres of Cordova property for the planned Castaic Lake and dam. Construction started in 1967 and was completed in 1973. A large portion of the historic ranch disappeared underwater, including the site of the ancestral ranch-house, as the Castaic Lake filled to capacity. The family was given 90-days notice to vacate their property. The Cordovas salvaged what they could including the outhouse which was moved to higher ground on ranch land that was not resumed.Los Angeles Times, The Last Roundup by Tracey Kaplan, 15 June 1992 Prison workers from a facility in Lancaster were used to dismantle and remove the remaining ranch infrastructure including fences, out buildings used for storage of cattle feed, and the windmill. They burnt the ranch house to the ground as part of this clearing operation, a heartbreaking event for the Cordova family. With only about 100 acres remaining to continue the ranch operation, the family had to sell most of their cattle. In time, they were able to obtain grazing contracts for adjoining land, including U.S. Forest Service property, which allowed the family to resume cattle ranching. ==Long tradition== Cordova family members still reside in Castaic today. Nancy Lynette Cordova, daughter of Lawrence and Bettyrose Cordova, now runs the family ranch. She manages their remaining 100 acres and another 900 acres that have been leased. The annual cattle roundup in June has been a long-held tradition still carried on by family members and their friends. == References == Category:History of Greater Los Angeles Category:Families from California ","title":"Cordova family (California)"},{"id":"60408423","text":"Maplewood in Christian County, Kentucky, located off Mason Lane near Pembroke, Kentucky was built around 1820.

The first EP was released on November 8, 2019, through Beluga Heights Records and Warner Records. 2Sides is Derulo's first album since 2016's Platinum Hits but his first album of new material since Everything Is 4 (2015). None of the songs were premiered before the release of the EP, and following its release none were promoted as singles. The second part was due to be released in early 2020; Side 2 was confirmed to be cancelled in May 2020, along with confirmation that Derulo had left his longtime record label due to creative differences. ==Background and concept== During 2016, Derulo began recording music at his home in Los Angeles and previewed a new song called \\"Swalla\\". He subsequently announced the song as his new single on January 2, 2017, noting that it featured rappers Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla Sign. In May, during an interview at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards, Derulo confirmed that \\"Swalla\\" and subsequent singles were part of 21 songs that made up his new album, 777. The album would be released in three parts, each with seven songs being released three months apart. A number of other singles were released in 2017, including \\"If I'm Lucky\\" in September and \\"Tip Toe\\" (featuring French Montana) in November. Whilst on his 2Sides tour during 2018, Derulo confirmed that the album would no longer be called 777 and was instead named after the tour. Explaining his reason further, Derulo said: Upon the album's announcement, press releases explained the concept of 2Sides and Derulo's approach with the project. \\"2SIDES embodies the concept of duality. There's the side the public sees ‚Äî the star we know and love ‚Äî but there‚Äôs also a darker side, which is slowly revealed.\\" The release was also accompanied by a trailer posted on Derulo's Instagram account. \\"Goodbye\\", a joint-collaboration with David Guetta and featuring Nicki Minaj and Willy William, was released on August 24, 2018. This was followed by another new single, \\"Mamacita\\" (featuring Farruko), which was released on July 5, 2019. On August 27, 2019, Derulo released another single called \\"Too Hot\\". ==Release and cancellation of Side 2== During an interview with the Official Charts Company, Derulo confirmed his plans to release the album as two seven-track EPs in quick session. He said \\"I want to do it in doses so people will hear the songs. I still think it's nice to give people a body of work; I'm a touring artist and I like forming a concept on the tour which comes from the album title.\\" He also said that his previous singles \\"Swalla\\", \\"If I'm Lucky\\", \\"Tip Toe\\", and \\"Goodbye\\" will not be included on the album because \\"those songs have had their time. Even though putting them on an album would make it go platinum in two seconds, it's not about the numbers.

He then revealed the tracklist for Side 1 on Twitter on November 1. In May 2020, Derulo confirmed that Side 2 to 2Sides would no longer be released.

A native of Solingen, Portzline migrated to the United States in 1777, and settled in Franklin Township, York County, Pennsylvania, around 1800. There he operated a general store; its account book still exists in the hands of his descendants. He married Sabina Heiges, a member of a local family, and is believed to have been a schoolteacher at the Franklin Church. Achieving American citizenship in 1804, in 1812 he sold his York County property and moved to Perry County; some years later he moved again, to Snyder County, which would be his home until his death. His property was located along the Susquehanna River, in Perry Township, at the time part of Union County. While living there he continued to farm and teach. The Portzline family cemetery, containing the artist's grave, still exists in Perry Township. As an artist Portzline is remembered today for a handful of baptismal records for children in the neighborhood, distinguished by their border designs of brightly-colored animals. His work incorporates both German and English. Several pieces, primarily certificates for his own children, are known to survive. Six of his pieces are held by the Philadelphia Museum of Art; other collections holding examples of his work include those of the Winterthur Museum, which owns three works; the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, which owns two; and the Free Library of Philadelphia, which owns one, as does the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College.

While the origins of this compound are still unknown, it is thought that they are derived from diatoms due to their identification in diatom rich sediments and environments. In addition, it was found that 24-norcholestane levels increased in correlation with diatom evolution. Another possible source of 24-norcholestane is from dinoflagellates, albeit to a much lower extent. == Structure == 24-Norcholestane is a tetracyclic compound, with 20R,5Œ±(H),14Œ±(H),17Œ±(H) stereochemistry, derived from steroids or sterols. It consists of three 6-membered rings and one 5-membered ring, with carbon 24 removed from the side chain off of C17. == Background == 24-Norcholestane is a 26-carbon (C26) sterane created from the removal of carbon 24 from cholestane. It has been found that 24-norcholestane is relatively high in abundance, up to 10% of sterols, in Thalassiosira aff. antarctica, a diatom. It has also been found in the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium simplex, albeit at much lower levels (around 0.2% of sterols). === Origins === Since 24-norcholestane origins are still unknown, the synthesis of it is also unknown as well. However, some pathways have been proposed. Possible sources of 24-norcholestane include 24-norcholesterol, which is present in many marine invertebrates and some algae in addition to diatoms and dinoflagellates. == Measurement techniques == Since C26 steranes are generally present in an order of magnitude lower than the more common steranes (i.e. C27, C28, and C29), GC/MS/MS is used to obtain better analysis of the C26 steranes. (a) shows the summation of GC/MS/MS transitions of all steranes, whereas (b) shows the transitions for C26 steranes only and where the peaks map to in the summation. Samples are collected from rocks or crude oils. Asphaltenes are first extracted before the sample is fractionated by passing through a silica column and eluting with solvents of increasing polarity. Traditional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques are not used, as C26 steranes are present in samples in much lower quantities, generally a magnitude lower, as compared to more common C27, C28, and C29 steranes. Instead, GC/MS/MS (GC-tandem MS) techniques are used for better analysis of C26 steranes. == Use as a biomarker == A 1993 study found high levels of 24-norcholestane in Middle Miocene marine siliceous sediments from Japan. In a 1998 study, it was found that 24-norcholestanes were present in higher levels than their 27-norcholestane analogs in Cretaeous or younger oils and sediments. Diatom fossils were first recognized in the Jurassic age, with corresponding samples having NCR>0.2. Cretaceous age samples had NCR>0.4, and Oligocene age and younger samples had NCR>0.6. Thus, having higher NCR ratios is indicative of a younger age. It appears that 24-norcholestane is not present until the emergence of diatoms. A 2008 study found that 24-norcholestanes also correlated with dinoflagellates in lacustrine sediments in China. In a 2012 study, 24-norcholestanes were found in oils and Cambrian‚ÄìOrdovician source rocks from the Tarim Basin in China at much higher levels than in the 1998 study (NCRs were equivalent to Cretaceous source rocks). Since diatoms do not appear at this time, the authors contribute these abnormally high levels to dinoflagellates. == See also == * Biomarker * Cholestane * Nor- == References == Category:Steroids Category:Hydrocarbons Category:Biomarkers Category:Jurassic first appearances ","title":"24-Norcholestane"},{"id":"60408513","text":"Jacques Calmanson (; 1722, Hrubiesz√≥w ‚Äì 1811, Warsaw), born Solomon Jacob ben Kalman (), was a Polish Jewish maskilic writer, translator, and personal physician of King Stanislaw II. ==Biography== Jacques Calmanson was born in Hrubiesz√≥w, where his father served as rabbi. He studied medicine in Germany and France and was fluent in Yiddish, Hebrew, French, German, and Polish. Calmanson's travels also took him to Turkey and Russia. He eventually settled in Warsaw, serving as physician to King Stanislaw II. In 1784, Calmanson wrote a pamphlet to the king regarding taxes that the Jews were allegedly hiding from the royal court and in 1791 translated a Hebrew text into Polish, which invited representatives of the Jewish communities to come to Warsaw to meet with the king and help pay off the royal debt. During the proceedings of the Four-Year Sejm, Calmanson was the royal translator of the Hebrew and Yiddish magazines, and mediated between royal secretary Scipione Piattoli and the envoys of Jewish communities. For his services, he received a salary from the king and the Masonic lodge, which was maintained even after the king's death in 1798. ===Later life=== After Warsaw fell under Prussian rule in 1796, Calmanson published Essai sur l'√©tat actuel des Juifs de Pologne et leur perfectibilit√©, which he dedicated to , the Prussian commissioner for the annexed Polish areas. The pamphlet, which called for a reform of Jewish life, was translated into Polish the following year as Uwagi nad niniejszym stanem ≈ªyd√≥w polskich i ich wydoskonaleniem and dedicated to Tsar Alexander I who, in gratitude, send Calmanson a gift of cigarettes through the mediation of Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. Calmanson's proposals to the authorities included, among others, limiting the autonomy of Jews and the judicial power of rabbinic courts, replacing cheders with state-run public schools, state supervision of Jewish marriage, and compulsory adoption of \\"European\\" dress and customs. Parts of his proposal were adopted by the Prussian authorities in 1797. Particularly notable is Calmanson's critique of the growing Hasidic movement, which he depicted as antithetical to the Enlightenment and an obstacle to the reform of Jewish society and its integration into the state. Cleansing Judaism of the fanaticism represented by the Hasidim and Frankists, argued Calmanson, would revive the customs and morality of the Jews and return to its previous form‚Äîwhich, according to him, resembled the Enlightenment ideal of natural religion. He called the government to undertake firm measures against the movement and its adherents. ==See also== * Enlightenment in Poland ==References== Category:1722 births Category:1811 deaths Category:18th-century Jewish physicians Category:18th-century Polish physicians Category:Court physicians Category:People from Hrubiesz√≥w Category:Polish Freemasons Category:Polish Jews Category:Polish writers in French Category:Translators from Hebrew Category:Translators to Polish Category:Yiddish‚ÄìPolish translators ","title":"Jacques Calmanson"},{"id":"60408514","text":"John Rutherford Everett (December 27, 1918 - January 21, 1992) was a college administrator.

His first prosthetic limb was for William Singleton, a local man who lost an arm firing a cannon for a celebratory salute, which Gillingham made at no cost to Singleton. He then made prostheses on a permanent basis. Chard, as a result, became a major centre of the British artificial limb industry. Samples from Gillingham's workshop are on display at the Chard Museum.

It was officially announced on February 24, 2019. The device serves as the successor to the 2018 LG G7 ThinQ. ==Specifications== === Hardware === The LG G8 ThinQ utilizes a metal chassis with a glass backing, and is IP68-rated for water and dust-resistance. It is available in black, gray and red color finishes. The G8 features a 1440p FullVision AMOLED display, with a diagonal size of 6.1 inches and a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The G8 is the first G series phone to have an OLED display, as this had previously been reserved for V series phones starting with the V30. The G8 utilizes the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 system-on-chip with 6 GB of RAM. It is offered with 128 GB of internal storage, expandable via SD card. It supports wireless charging, and all models will support Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. All models in all markets will include quad Digital-to-analog converters (DAC) to enhance sound output. The G8 retains the G7's biometric options but introduces a new \\"Hand ID\\" technology which reads the user's circulatory and hand patterns. The G8 also features AirMotion gesture control. These are enabled by the addition of a time-of-flight sensor called the Z camera. Additionally, the G8 keeps the G7's Boombox speaker and adds \\"Crystal Sound\\" which vibrates the screen to work as a speaker in place of a traditional earpiece. However, the G8 still has a conventional bottom-speaking speaker. There is a button on the side of the phone similar to Samsung's Bixby button; while it cannot be remapped, it launches Google Assistant when held, rather than a different A.I. Double tapping the button launches Google Lens. The camera is a dual or triple setup depending on the market, with a primary lens, wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens; the primary and telephoto units are 12 MP, while the wide-angle unit is 16 MP. The telephoto lens is omitted in markets with a dual camera setup. On the front, an 8 MP selfie shooter lives inside the notch. The G8's battery is a 16.7% increase over its predecessor, totaling 3500 mAh. ===Software=== The G8 ThinQ ships with Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\" and LG's UX skin. In November 2019, LG began to release Android 10 for the G8 ThinQ. ==Reception== The Verge gave the G8 a 6.5, praising the ergonomics, Quad DAC, Face Unlock and battery life, while criticizing the piezoelectric earpiece and Hand ID and AirMotion, noting that it \\"may not receive timely software updates\\". Engadget gave the G8 a 73, calling it \\"a wasted opportunity\\". Velazco praised the design, display and performance and had similar complaints. CNET gave the G8 an 8.5, remarking that \\"the LG G8 ThinQ is an objectively great phone...with a high price tag and no standout features\\", but was critical of portrait mode for video. The G8x received mixed reviews as well, with a 7 from The Verge, a 74 from Engadget, an 8.3 from CNET, 4 stars from TechRadar and 3 stars from Digital Trends. The G8s received praise from Notebook Check for having decent battery life and good speakers, but was criticized for its poor low-light camera performance. The triple-camera variant of the G8 received an overall score of 96 on DxOMark, with a photo score of 99 and a video score of 89, tying it with the OnePlus 6. While not ranked among the top smartphone cameras on the site, its score is a 13-point improvement over its predecessor and a 2-point improvement over the V40. ==Variants== ===LG G8s ThinQ=== The LG G8s ThinQ was released in select markets in Europe, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East in July 2019. Visually, the G8s is differentiated from the G8 by a larger notch and more color options. It uses the same chipset as the G8 while having slower charging (18W compared to 21W on the G8), a marginally larger 3550mAh battery and a 64 GB model. The display is larger at 6.21 inches, but is 1080p (1080 √ó 2248). The G8s has a triple camera setup in all markets, but the camera sees some slight downgrades in terms of aperture and focal length while having a lower resolution ultrawide sensor. The G8s has stereo speakers like the G8, but lacks the G8's Crystal Sound technology. ===LG G8x ThinQ=== The LG G8x ThinQ was released in November 2019 with newer LG UX 9 software. A Dual Screen accessory is bundled with the device and connects via the USB-C port. It can run two apps simultaneously or extend the display when using a web browser. The screen is 6.4\\" with Gorilla Glass 6, and is 1080p (1080 √ó 2340). A monochrome panel on the opposite side shows the time, date, battery level, and a few notification icons. A dual camera setup is present on the rear, with no telephoto sensor. The selfie camera is 32 MP as opposed to 8 MP on the G8 and G8s. Additionally, while recording videos users can now switch between the front and rear camera. The device uses an under-display optical scanner, and the battery is larger as well at 4000mAh. The device was launched in South Korea as the LG V50S ThinQ with 5G capabilities. == See also == * LG G series * Comparison of smartphones ==References== Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:LG Electronics mobile phones Category:Smartphones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2019 Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras ","title":"LG G8 ThinQ"},{"id":"60408751","text":"Alexis Arias may refer to: *Alexis Arias (rower) (born 1969), Cuban rower *Alexis Arias (footballer) (born 1995), Peruvian footballer See also: *Alexis Mart√≠n Arias (born 1992), Argentine footballer ","title":"Alexis Arias"},{"id":"60408767","text":"Catherine Russell Gira (October 30, 1932 ‚Äì March 26, 2019) was an American educator and administrator who was president of Frostburg State University from 1991 to 2006. == Biography == Gira was born in Fayette City, Pennsylvania on October 30, 1932.

On May 5, 2020, Hawkins announced that former Socialist Party USA vice presidential candidate Angela Nicole Walker would be his running mate. Hawkins and Walker were nominated by the Green Party on July 11, 2020. Hawkins also sought the nomination of the various state-based left-wing parties, including the Peace and Freedom Party, Legal Marijuana Now Party, Oregon Progressive Party, United Citizens Party, Liberty Union Party, and Vermont Progressive Party. ==Background== In the 1980s, Hawkins joined the green movement. In 1988, Howie and Murray Bookchin founded the Left Green Network \\"as a radical alternative to U.S. Green liberals\\", based around the principles of social ecology and libertarian municipalism. In the early 1990s a press conference was held in Washington, D.C., that featured Charles Betz, Joni Whitmore, Hilda Mason, and Howie Hawkins to announce the formation of the Greens/Green Party USA. Later in December 1999, Mike Feinstein and Hawkins wrote the Plan for a Single National Green Party which was the plan to organize the ASGP and GPUSA into a single Green Party. Over the next decade he would run in multiple New York Senate and House races. In the 2010 New York gubernatorial election Hawkins surpassed the 50,000-vote requirement to stay on the ballot in the gubernatorial election. In the 2014 election, he received enough to move the Green Party line to Row D on the ballot as he had taken one-third more than the Working Families Party and twice as much as the Independence Party. In the 2018 election, Hawkins received 80,000 fewer votes than he did in his 2014 run. As a result, the party was lowered one row down to Row E, but retained ballot access. In 2012, Hawkins was approached over the possibility of running for the Green Party presidential nomination. He declined due to his employment commitments at UPS, which he maintained would interfere with a national campaign. Following his retirement from UPS, Hawkins was approached again to run by a draft movement via a public letter addressed to him. The letter was signed by former Green vice presidential nominees Cheri Honkala and Ajamu Baraka, former Green mayoral candidate and Nader's 2008 running mate Matt Gonzalez, and other prominent Green Party members. ==Campaign== On April 3, 2019, Hawkins announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to prepare for a potential candidacy for the Green Party 2020 presidential nomination and formally launched his campaign on May 28, 2019, in Brooklyn, New York. On June 21, 2020, Hawkins received enough delegates to win the Green Party's presidential nomination after winning delegates from the Green Party of Michigan and Lavender Caucus. On July 11, he received the Green Party's presidential nomination with 210 delegates at the party's virtual convention. On October 26, 2019, Hawkins won the nomination of the Socialist Party USA as part of his effort to unite smaller left-wing parties. In November, Hawkins was endorsed by Solidarity. On March 3, 2020, Hawkins lost the Peace and Freedom Party primary to Gloria La Riva. On August 13, 2020, he was endorsed by Socialist Alternative. Hawkins also received the nomination of the Legal Marijuana Now Party. ===Ballot access=== rightthumb300x300pxTotal electoral vote eligibility: 514 On July 15, Hawkins sued Oklahoma over its $35,000 filing fee for president. On September 1, the Green Party of Alaska nominated Jesse Ventura for president and Cynthia McKinney for vice-president instead of Hawkins and Walker. ====Rhode Island==== On May 28, 2020, the Green Party of Rhode Island announced that it would not place a presidential candidate onto the ballot for the first time since 1996 citing the danger of Donald Trump winning reelection. Hawkins later announced that he would petition as an independent candidate under the partisan label \\"Independent Left\\" in Rhode Island. However, only 897 of the 1,000 signatures needed were validated preventing Hawkins from appearing on the Rhode Island ballot. ====Pennsylvania==== A challenge was filed against Hawkins in Pennsylvania stating that the Green Party's stand-in candidates for president and vice- president had not submitted a declaration of candidacy. On September 9, Judge J. Andrew Crompton rejected a challenge to Hawkins being on the ballot in Pennsylvania although the challenge against Walker being on the ballot was accepted. Crompton ruled that Hawkins should appear on the ballot as the stand-in presidential candidate did submit a declaration of candidacy while the stand-in vice-presidential candidate had not. On September 10, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to remove Hawkins from the ballot. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered election officials to not print ballots until the court made a decision on whether or not Hawkins would appear on the ballot. On September 17, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled five to two in favor of removing Hawkins from the ballot. All five Democratic members of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court voted to remove Hawkins while both Republican members voted to keep him on the ballot. ====Wisconsin==== Hawkins' presidential petition in Wisconsin was challenged in August under the basis that Walker had changed her residence address within South Carolina. On August 19, the staff of the Wisconsin Elections Commission recommended that Hawkins be removed from the ballot due to his petitions not having enough signatures when the signatures for the out- of-date postal address for Walker were removed. On August 20, the commission voted three to three to remove Hawkins from the ballot; all of the Democratic members of the commission voted to remove Hawkins while the Republican members voted to keep him on the ballot. On September 3, Hawkins filed a lawsuit to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. On September 10, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ordered election officials to stop mailing out ballots until the court ruled on whether or not Hawkins and/or Kanye West could appear on the ballot. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled four to three in favor of the election commission on September 14, citing that Hawkins had waited too long to file a lawsuit and that it would cause too much disruption to place his name on the ballot. ==Campaign finance== On August 23, 2019, the Hawkins campaign announced they had met the requisite federal matching funds for California and New York. Only his campaign and Steve Bullock's applied for primary season matching funds. On July 9, 2020, the Hawkins campaign announced they achieved federal matching fund requirements in 20 necessary states, claiming they had raised $220,000 from 4,000 donors in over 7,000 total contributions. ==Political positions== ===Climate change=== Hawkins supports the Green Party's version of the Green New Deal that would serve as a transitional plan to a one hundred percent clean, renewable energy by 2030 utilizing a carbon tax, jobs guarantee, free college, single-payer healthcare and a focus on using public programs. He is a critic of the Democratic version of the Green New Deal written by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, stating that \\"unfortunately, they took the brand but watered down the content\\". === Democratic Party reform === Hawkins disagrees with the \\"party-within-the-party\\" approach to the Democratic Party advocated by organizations such as the Democratic Socialists of America or by individuals such as Bernie Sanders. Instead, he believes that socialists should build up an independent Left party. === Participatory democracy === Hawkins advocates for expansion of town meetings, expanding their powers to enact legislation and granting them the power to recall representatives. === Medicare for All === Hawkins views health care as a human right and a public good. His plan is to implement a single-payer National Health Insurance in which health care facilities are publicly owned, healthcare workers are salaried, and the system is governed by community boards elected by the public (two-thirds of the seats) and health care workers (one-third of the seats). The system will be funded by allocating current public healthcare dollars (about 70% of current spending) to the system. The rest of the funding would come from progressive taxes on individuals/families, both earned and unearned income, who earn more than 150% of the adjusted Federal Poverty Level and on large corporations. == Endorsements == == Controversies == === Dispute with Gloria La Riva=== On February 20, 2020, Hawkins published a statement critical of his opponent in the Peace and Freedom Party nomination primary, Gloria La Riva, alleging that she supported \\"a 'safe strategy' of supporting Bernie Sanders in the 'battleground' states\\" and stating \\"you didn't join the Peace and Freedom Party to support Democrats.\\" LaRiva responded stating that it was \\"not an honest critique\\" and \\"[f]or Hawkins to further imply that he is the stronger supporter of Peace and Freedom is not convincing.\\" LaRiva won the Peace and Freedom Party's only primary contest in California, receiving 67% to Hawkins' 33%. ===Allegations of Irregularities in the Green Party Primary=== On October 16, 2019, a joint candidate letter called for reform in the primary process in response to the party‚Äôs announcement that it would remove unrecognized candidates from its website list that November, allegations of conflicts of interest, and an alleged violation of Green Party rules regarding Hawkins‚Äô campaign for the Socialist Party‚Äôs nomination. After the 2020 Green Party Nominating Convention named Hawkins as their presidential candidate, candidate Dario Hunter announced via Twitter that he would continue to pursue the presidency as an independent candidate. Hunter cited alleged irregularities and undemocratic processes throughout the Green Party presidential primary, stating that party leaders had committed ‚Äúethical lapses‚Äù to ensure Hawkins nomination, and criticizing Hawkins‚Äô for what he saw as his ‚Äúimperialist perspective‚Äù and ‚ÄúCIA talking points.‚Äù ==Notes== == References == == External links == * Category:2020 United States presidential campaigns Category:Socialist Party USA presidential campaigns Category:Green Party of the United States presidential campaigns Category:Howie Hawkins ","title":"Howie Hawkins 2020 presidential campaign"},{"id":"60408825","text":"Salty Dog was an American rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1986 by guitarist Scott Lane, bassist Michael Hannon, and drummer Khurt Maier.

Upon its renovation in 2014, it was reopened as a major concert hall in the city. ==History== The city of Harbin was home to thousands of Jews. The number of Jewish diasporas living in Harbin was over 20,000 in the 1920s, making Harbin the largest gregarious center for Jews in the Far East. On 15 January 1909, the hall opened as Harbin General Synagogue (), the main Jewish religious site for the city. The former Jewish middle school was adjacent to the synagogue, whose site is still well preserved and was transferred into a music school. In June 1931, the building was devastated by a great fire and was refurbished. Abraham Kaufman, then leader of Harbin Jewish community, was working in the synagogue from 1919 to 1945.

It is an off-shoot of its sister channel GameTV, focused on programming relating to fantasy sports, sports betting (including programming simulcast from VSIN), Esports, outdoor recreation, poker, and other competition and sports entertainment programming. ==History== The channel's origins begin in January 2013, when Anthem Media's subsidiary, Fight Media, was granted approval from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a television channel called \\"The League ‚Äì Fantasy Sports TV,\\" described as \\"a national, English-language specialty Category B service devoted to fantasy sports, allowing viewers to act as owners and assume all the responsibilities associated with operating real sports franchises, and allowing viewers to create, monitor, trade and discuss players on their teams with others also playing fantasy sports.\\"Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-7 CRTC 2013-01-09 In February 2013, Anthem acquired two fantasy sports analysis websites‚ÄîRotoExperts and SportsGrid‚Äîto bolster content for the network. In March 2013, Anthem CEO Leonard Asper told the Toronto Star that the channel was expected to launch that September. He defended the network's concept by noting that \\"people thought 'How can there be an entire channel devoted to golf?' But now the Golf Channel is in 82 million homes\\", and that advertisers \\"leapt out of their chairs\\" when they learned that the network could appeal to both the traditional \\"baby boomer\\" demographic associated with fantasy sports, and the young male demographic that had also increasingly shown interest in fantasy.

Huawei has faced allegations, primarily from the United States and its allies, that its wireless networking equipment could contain backdoors enabling surveillance by the Chinese government. Huawei has stated that its products posed \\"no greater cybersecurity risk\\" than those of any other vendor, and that there was no evidence of the U.S. espionage claims. The company had also partnered with British officials to establish a laboratory to audit its products. These concerns intensified with Huawei's involvement in the development of 5G wireless networks, and have led to some countries implementing or contemplating restrictions on the use of Chinese- made hardware in these networks. In March 2019, Huawei sued the U.S. government over a military spending bill that restricted the purchase of equipment from Huawei or ZTE by the government, citing that it had been refused due process. Huawei exited the U.S. market due to these concerns, which had also made U.S. wireless carriers reluctant to sell its products. Huawei has also faced allegations that it has engaged in corporate espionage to steal competitors' intellectual property, and in 2019, was restricted from performing commerce with U.S. companies, over allegations that it willfully exported technology of U.S. origin to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. The company has also been accused of assisting in the mass-detention of Uyghurs in Xinjiang re-education camps. and employing forced Uyghur labour in its supply chain. ==Intellectual property and theft== === Cisco patent lawsuit === Huawei Dual Band LTE Wi-Fi modem In 2003 Cisco General Counsel Mark Chandler traveled to Shenzhen to confront Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei with evidence of Huawei's theft of Cisco IP. The evidence included typos from Cisco's technical manuals that also appeared in Huawei's, after being presented with the evidence Ren replied \\"coincidence\\". In February 2003, Cisco Systems sued Huawei Technologies for allegedly infringing on its patents and illegally copying source code used in its routers and switches. According to a statement by Cisco, by July 2004 Huawei removed the contested code, manuals and command- line interfaces and the case was subsequently settled out of court. As part of the settlement Huawei admitted that it had copied some of Cisco's router software. Both sides claimed success ‚Äì with Cisco asserting that \\"completion of lawsuit marks a victory for the protection of intellectual property rights\\", and Huawei's partner 3Com (which was not a part of lawsuit) noting that court order prevented Cisco from bringing another case against Huawei asserting the same or substantially similar claims. Although Cisco employees allegedly witnessed counterfeited technology as late as September 2005, in a retrospective Cisco's Corporate Counsel noted, \\"Cisco was portrayed by the Chinese media as a bullying multi-national corporation\\" and \\"the damage to Cisco's reputation in China outweighed any benefit achieved through the lawsuit\\". Huawei's chief representative in the U.S. subsequently claimed that Huawei had been vindicated in the case, breaking a confidentiality clause of Huawei's settlement with Cisco. In response, Cisco revealed parts of the independent expert's report produced for the case which proved that Huawei had stolen Cisco code and directly copied it into their products. In a company blog post Cisco's Mark Chandler stated that the settled case had included allegations of \\"direct, verbatim copying of our source code, to say nothing of our command line interface, our help screens, our copyrighted manuals and other elements of our products\\" by Huawei and provided additional information to support those allegations. Prior to Cisco providing conclusive proof in 2012 the story of Huawei's blatant plagiarism had obtained the status of folklore within the routing and switching community. === T-Mobile smartphone testing robot === In September 2014, Huawei faced a lawsuit from T-Mobile US, which alleged that Huawei stole technology from its Bellevue, Washington, headquarters. T-Mobile claimed in its filed suit that Huawei's employees snuck into a T-Mobile lab during the period of 2012‚Äì2013 and stole parts of its smartphone testing robot Tappy. The Huawei employees then copied the operating software and design details, violating confidentiality agreements that both companies signed. Furthermore, Huawei is now using the stolen parts and data to build its own testing robot. A Huawei spokesman stated to The New York Times that there is some truth to the complaint, but that the two employees involved have been fired. T-Mobile has since stopped using Huawei as a supplier, which T-Mobile says could cost it tens of millions of dollars as it moves away from its handsets. In May 2017, a jury agreed with T-Mobile that Huawei committed industrial espionage in United States, and Huawei was ordered to pay $4.8m in damages. Huawei responded to the lawsuit by arguing that Tappy was not a trade secret, and that it was made by Epson, not T-Mobile. According to Huawei, \\"T-Mobile's statement of the alleged trade secret is an insufficient, generic statement that captures virtually every component of its robot\\", and it had failed to point out any trade secret stolen with sufficient specificity. T-Mobile dismissed Huawei's arguments, and contended that Epson had provided only a component of the robot. === Motorola patent lawsuit === In July 2010, Motorola filed an amended complaint that named Huawei as a co- defendant in its case against Lemko for alleged theft of trade secrets. === Motorola‚ÄìNokia Siemens Networks sales dispute === In January 2011, Huawei filed a lawsuit against Motorola to prevent its intellectual property from being illegally transferred to Nokia Siemens Networks (\\"NSN\\") as part of NSN's US$1.2 billion acquisition of Motorola's wireless network business. In April 2011, Motorola and Huawei entered into an agreement to settle all pending litigation, with Motorola paying an undisclosed sum to Huawei for the intellectual property that would be part of the sale to NSN. === ZTE patent lawsuit === In a further move to protect its intellectual property, Huawei filed lawsuits in Germany, France and Hungary in April 2011 against ZTE for patent and trademark infringement. The following day, ZTE countersued Huawei for patent infringement in China. === Nortel === In 2012, Brian Shields, who was the senior cybersecurity analyst of the Canadian telecommunications company Nortel, alleged that state-directed Chinese networks had comprehensively penetrated the company's networks from at least 2000 until the company's bankruptcy in 2009. He alleged that Huawei (who had been a contract manufacturer for Nortel) was the primary beneficiary of the hack. As early as 2004, it was suspected that Huawei was copying Nortel's hardware and instruction manuals. === Circuit boards === In June 2004, a Huawei employee was caught diagramming and photographing circuit boards after-hours from a competitor booth at the SuperComm trade show. The employee denied the accusation, but was later dismissed. === Ahkan Semiconductor diamond glass === Huawei was under investigation by FBI in the United States for sending some diamond glass samples developed by the company Ahkan Semiconductor to China without authorization to test and destroy the product in order to steal intellectual property. ===CNEX Labs=== CNEX Labs claims that a Huawei executive, with the help of a Chinese university, attempted to steal CNEX's solid-state drive computer storage technology. ==Espionage and security concerns== Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei === 2000s === In the U.S., officials and politicians within the federal government have raised concerns that Huawei-made telecommunications equipment may be designed to allow unauthorised access by the Chinese government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, given that Ren Zhengfei, the founder of the company, served as an engineer in the army in the early 1980s. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States scrutinized a deal by Bain Capital to acquire 3Com with Huawei as a minority investor, and an attempt to acquire the virtualization firm 3Leaf Systems, both due to security concerns (with concerns that China could gain access to U.S. military-grade technology in the case of the former). Both deals fell through. In 2010, Sprint Nextel blocked bids by Huawei on a supply contract, after the company was contacted by the Secretary of Commerce. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party raised concerns about security over Huawei's bid for Marconi in 2005, and the company's equipment was mentioned as an alleged potential threat in a 2009 government briefing by Alex Allan, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. In November 2010, Huawei agreed to proactively allow local officials to perform cybersecurity examinations of its products, resulting in the opening of the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC). Its oversight board includes members of the National Cyber Security Centre and GCHQ. In October 2009, the Indian Department of Telecommunications reportedly requested national telecom operators to \\"self-regulate\\" the use of all equipment from European, U.S. and Chinese telecoms manufacturers following security concerns. Earlier, in 2005, Huawei was blocked from supplying equipment to India's Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) cellular phone service provider.BSNL Cancels Huawei GSM Tender Covering Southern India Cellular News. In 2010, the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) insisted on cancelling the rest of the Huawei contract with BSNL and pressed charges against several top BSNL officers regarding their \\"doubtful integrity and dubious links with Chinese firms\\".CBI to probe link between BSNL officers, Chinese firm Hindustan Times.PMO forced BSNL to remove top officials Hindustan Times. In June 2010, an interim solution was introduced that would allow the import of Chinese-made telecoms equipment to India if pre-certified by international security agencies such as Canada's Electronic Warfare Associates, US-based Infoguard, and Israel's ALTAL Security Consulting. === Early 2010s === In a 2011 open letter, Huawei stated that the security concerns are \\"unfounded and unproven\\" and called on the U.S. government to investigate any aspect of its business. The US-based non-profit organisation Asia Society carried out a review of Chinese companies trying to invest in the U.S., including Huawei. The organisation found that only a few investment deals were blocked following unfavorable findings by the CFIUS or had been given a recommendation not to apply. However, all large transactions had been politicised by groups including the U.S. media, members of Congress and the security community. However, another article unrelated to the report published by the Asia Society reported that, \\"fear that the P.R.C. government could strongarm private or unaffiliated Chinese groups into giving up cyber-secrets is reflected in the U.S. government's treatment of Chinese telecom company Huawei.\\" In December 2011, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. is invoking Cold War-era national security powers to force telecommunication companies including AT&T; Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. to divulge confidential information about their networks in a hunt for Chinese cyber-spying. The US House Intelligence Committee had said on 18 November that it would investigate foreign companies, and a spokesman for Huawei said that the company conducts its businesses according to normal business practices and actually welcomed the investigation. On 8 October 2012, the Committee issued a report concluding Huawei and ZTE were a \\"national security threat\\". However, a 2012 White House- ordered review found no concrete evidence to support the House report's espionage allegations. In March 2012, Australian media sources reported that the Australian government had excluded Huawei from tendering for contracts with NBN Co, a government-owned corporation that is managing the construction of the National Broadband Network,Australian Financial Review (2012). China‚Äôs Huawei banned from NBN . Retrieved 26 March 2012. following advice from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation regarding security concerns.Australian Financial Review (2012). ASIO forced NBN to dump Huawei . Retrieved 26 March 2012. The Attorney-General's Department stated in response to these reports that the National Broadband Network is \\"a strategic and significant government investment, [and] we have a responsibility to do our utmost to protect its integrity and that of the information carried on it.\\" On 9 October 2012, a spokesperson for prime minister Stephen Harper indicated that the Canadian government invoked a national security exception to exclude Huawei from its plans to build a secure government communications network. On 19 July 2013, Michael Hayden, former head of the U.S. National Security Agency and director of Motorola Solutions, claimed that he has seen hard evidence of backdoors in Huawei's networking equipment and that the company engaged in espionage and shared intimate knowledge of the foreign telecommunications systems with the Chinese government. Huawei and Motorola Solutions had previously been engaged in intellectual property disputes for a number of years. Huawei's global cybersecurity officer, John Suffolk, described the comments made by Hayden as \\"tired, unsubstantiated, defamatory remarks\\" and challenged him and other critics to present any evidence publicly.Huawei has spied for Chinese government, ex-CIA boss says  World news . The Guardian. (19 July 2013). Retrieved 9 December 2013. In 2014, The New York Times reported, based upon documents leaked by Edward Snowden, that the U.S. National Security Agency has since 2007 been operating a covert program against Huawei. This involved breaking into Huawei's internal networks, including headquarter networks and founder Ren Zhengfei's communications. In 2014, Huawei reached a sponsorship deal with the NFL's Washington Redskins to install free public Wi-Fi at FedExField, but the agreement was abruptly shelved weeks after it was announced due to unofficial action by a U.S. government advisor. In 2016, Canada's immigration department said it planned to deny permanent resident visas to three Chinese citizens who worked for Huawei over concerns the applicants are involved in espionage, terrorism, and government subversion. === Late 2010s === In 2018, an investigation by French newspaper Le Monde alleged that China had engaged in hacking the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia from 2012 to 2017. The building was built by Chinese contractors, including Huawei, and Huawei equipment has been linked to these hacks. The Chinese government denied that they bugged the building, stating that the accusations were \\"utterly groundless and ridiculous.\\" Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn rejected the French media report. Moussa Faki Mahamat, head of the African Union Commission, said the allegations in the Le Monde report were false. \\"These are totally false allegations and I believe that we are completely disregarding them.\\" On 17 April 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) held a preliminary, 5‚Äì0 vote on rules forbidding the use of government subsidies to purchase telecom equipment from companies deemed to be a risk to national security. A draft of the policy specifically named Huawei and ZTE as examples. The same day, the company revealed plans to downplay the U.S. market as part of its future business plans, citing the government scrutiny as having impeded its business there. In August 2018, U.S. president Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which contains a provision barring the U.S. government from purchasing hardware from Huawei or ZTE, under cybersecurity ground. In retaliation for the aforementioned campaigns and legislation targeting the company, Huawei sued the U.S. government in March 2019, alleging that it has \\"repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions\\", and that Congress failed to provide it due process. In March 2019, the HCSEC Oversight Board published a report stating that it had \\"continued to identify concerning issues in Huawei‚Äôs approach to software development bringing significantly increased risk to UK operators\\", and that it had \\"not yet seen anything to give it confidence in Huawei‚Äôs capacity to successfully complete the elements of its transformation programme that it has proposed as a means of addressing these underlying defects\\". The report cited, in particular, use of outdated versions of VxWorks in its networking equipment and inconsistent checksums between OS images, and during a visit to a Huawei development centre in Shanghai, it was found that Huawei had been using an \\"unmanageable number\\" of OpenSSL revisions between individual products. On 30 April 2019, Bloomberg News published a report alleging that between 2009 and 2011, Vodafone Italy had discovered several security vulnerabilities in its Huawei fixed-line network equipment, including unspecified backdoors in optical nodes and broadband gateways, and unsecured telnet on its home routers that could give Huawei access to Vodafone's network. The report claimed that despite having claimed to have patched them, some of them had persisted through 2012, and that the same vulnerabilities could be found in Huawei equipment used by other regional Vodafone subsidiaries. Both Huawei and Vodafone disputed Bloombergs allegations: Huawei stated that the alleged security vulnerabilities had been patched after they were discovered and reported, and described the alleged \\"backdoors\\" as \\"technical mistakes\\" that had been \\"put right\\". Vodafone stated that telnet was commonly used by the industry for performing diagnostics and \\"would not have been accessible from the internet\\", that it was \\"nothing more than a failure to remove a diagnostic function after development\\", and there was no evidence of any actual breaches. On 15 May 2019, Trump issued the Executive Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain, which gives the government power to restrict any transactions with \\"foreign adversaries\\" that involve information and communications technology. The same day, also citing violations of economic sanctions against Iran, the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei and its affiliates to its entity list under the Export Administration Regulations. This restricts U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei without government permission. On 19 May 2019, Reuters reported that Google had suspended Huawei's ability to use the Android operating system on its devices with licensed Google Mobile Services, due to these restrictions. The next day, it was reported that Intel, Qualcomm, and Xilinx had stopped supplying components to Huawei. On 16 May 2019, Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said Dutch intelligence agency AIVD was made aware of reports of backdoors on Huawei equipment belonging to a Dutch carrier. And that the reports came from unidentified intelligence sources. A spokesman for the AIVD said the agency would not comment on the Volkskrant report. The Dutch paper claimed AIVD was determining whether or not the situation were used for spying by the Chinese government In June 2020, the head of France's cybersecurity agency, the Agence nationale de la s√©curit√© des syst√®mes d'information, stated that he would encourage telecom operators not to use Huawei equipment while not outright banning Huawei. On 28 August 2020, President Emmanuel Macron said, France won‚Äôt exclude Chinese telecom giant Huawei for its upcoming 5G telecommunication networks, but favored European providers for security reasons. === Chinese law requirement === In December 2018, Arne Sch√∂nbohm, head of Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), stated that the country had not yet seen evidence that Huawei had used its equipment to conduct espionage on behalf of China. That month, it was also reported that the Japanese government had ceased future procurement of Huawei and ZTE products. The Czech Republic's cybersecurity agency issued a warning against Huawei and ZTE products, arguing that Chinese law required companies to \\"cooperate with intelligence services, therefore introducing them into the key state systems might present a threat\\". Huawei refuted the arguments, stating that it is not required to include backdoors in its products, nor has the company ever received any requests to do so. Shortly afterward, prime minister Andrej Babi≈° ordered that government offices cease using Huawei and ZTE products. However, the ban was reversed after the agency's claims were found to be without basis. Huawei commissioned attorneys of the London-based law firm Clifford Chance and Beijing-based law firm Zhong Lun to review two Chinese bills commonly cited in these allegations (the 2017 National Intelligence Law, and the 2014 Counter-Espionage Law). They concluded that there was no such requirement in Chinese law for backdoors to be included in telecom equipment, and that the laws were directed more towards the actual operators of telecom services, and not extraterritorial. These findings were published in a Wired (magazine) opinion piece by Zhou Hanhua. Follow up reporting from Wired cast doubt on these findings, particularly because the Chinese \\"government doesn‚Äôt limit itself to what the law explicitly allows‚Äù when it comes to national security. === 5G networks === Four members of the Five Eyes international intelligence alliance‚ÄîAustralia, Canada, New Zealand and the US‚Äîhave declared the use of Huawei telecommunications equipment, particularly in 5G networks, poses \\"significant security risks\\", while Canada is carrying out its own security review; only Britain is permitting the company to participate in the rollout of the new technology. In late November 2018, the New Zealand signals intelligence agency Government Communications Security Bureau blocked telecommunications company Spark from using Huawei equipment in its planned 5G upgrade, claiming that it posed a \\"significant network security risk.\\" The NZ ban followed a similar ban in Australia in August 2018. In October 2018, BT Group announced that it had been phasing out Huawei equipment from \\"core\\" components of its wireless infrastructure (excluding parts such as phone mast antennas), including its 5G services, and the Emergency Services Network project. In December 2018, Gavin Williamson, the UK's Defence Secretary, expressed \\"grave\\" and \\"very deep concerns\\" about the company providing technology to upgrade Britain's services to 5G. He accused Beijing of acting \\"sometimes in a malign way\\". Alex Younger, the head of MI6, also raised questions about Huawei's role. On 11 January 2019, Poland announced that two people working on a 5G Huawei network had been arrested: Wang Weijing (a Huawei executive), and Piotr Durbaglo, a consultant having worked for Polish domestic security, but currently working for Orange on 5G network testing. In November 2019, the Chinese ambassador to Denmark, in meetings with high-ranking Faroese politicians, directly linked Huawei's 5G expansion with Chinese trade, according to a sound recording obtained by Kringvarp F√∏roya. According to Berlingske, the ambassador threatened with dropping a planned trade deal with the Faroe Islands, if the Faroese telecom company F√∏roya Tele did not let Huawei build the national 5G network. Huawei said they did not kn–æw about the meetings. === Consumer electronics === In 2015, German cybersecurity company G Data alleged that phones from Huawei and several other Chinese manufacturers had been shipped with malware via infected versions of legitimate apps, that could record phone calls, access user data, and send premium SMS messages. A Huawei spokesperson told G Data these breaches were likely to have taken place further down the supply chain, outside the manufacturing process. Huawei Mate 10 Pro In January 2018, with the proposal of the Defending US Government Communications Act (which would ban the use of Huawei and ZTE products and equipment by U.S. government entities), calls for the FCC to investigate the company, as well as government pressure, it was reported that U.S. carrier AT&T; had abruptly pulled out of an agreement to offer its Mate 10 Pro smartphone, while Verizon Communications had declined to carry any future Huawei products. On 14 February 2018, heads of six U.S. intelligence agencies testified to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence against the use of Chinese telecom products by U.S. citizens, such as those of Huawei and ZTE. Christopher A. Wray, director of the FBI, stated that they were \\"deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks\\". Huawei responded to the allegations, arguing that its products \\"[pose] no greater cybersecurity risk than any ICT vendor, sharing as we do common global supply chains and production capabilities,\\" and that it was \\"aware of a range of U.S. government activities seemingly aimed at inhibiting Huawei's business in the U.S. market\\". In March 2018, it was reported that Best Buy, the country's largest electronics store chain, would no longer sell Huawei products. In May 2019 a Huawei Mediapad M5 belonging to a Canadian IT engineer living in Taiwan was found to be sending data to servers in China despite never being authorized to do so. The apps could not be disabled and continued to send sensitive data even after appearing to be deleted. === Security exploits === In July 2012, Felix Lindner and Gregor Kopf gave a conference at Defcon to announce that they uncovered several critical vulnerabilities in Huawei routers (models AR18 and AR29) which could be used to get remote access to the device. The researchers said that Huawei \\"doesn't have a security contact for reporting vulnerabilities, doesn't put out security advisories and doesn't say what bugs have been fixed in its firmware updates\\", and as a result, the vulnerabilities have not been publicly disclosed. Huawei replied that they were investigating the claims. In January 2019, Huawei patched a security flaw that was discovered by Microsoft in the \\"PCManager\\" software bundled on its laptops, after detecting that the software used a driver with behavior similar to the DoublePulsar exploit. In March 2019, the Oversight Board of United Kingdom government organization Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre found ‚Äúserious and systematic defects‚Äù in Huawei software engineering and their cyber security competence, and cast doubt on Huawei's ability and competence to fix security problems that have been found, although they do not believe these flaws are caused by Chinese government interference. In October 2019 a person named John Wu presented details regarding Huawei's Undocumented APIs which can poses security risk for Huawei clients (for example it let apps with Admin privileges install new system apps on the Mate 30). Those permissions are used by the \\"LZPlay\\" app to install the Google framework and services. Huawei has denied any involvement with the app or the \\"LZPlay\\" site. In February 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that Huawei has had the ability to covertly exploit backdoors intended for law enforcement officials since 2009. These backdoors are found on carrier equipment like antennas and routers. Huawei's equipment is widely used around the world due to its low cost. == U.S. business restrictions == In August 2018, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA 2019) was signed into law, containing a provision that banned Huawei and ZTE equipment from being used by the U.S. federal government, citing security concerns. Huawei filed a lawsuit over the act in March 2019, alleging it to be unconstitutional because it specifically targeted Huawei without granting it a chance to provide a rebuttal or due process. On 15 May 2019, the Department of Commerce added Huawei and 70 foreign subsidiaries and \\"affiliates\\" to its entity list under the Export Administration Regulations, citing the company having been indicted for \\"knowingly and willfully causing the export, re-export, sale and supply, directly and indirectly, of goods, technology and services (banking and other financial services) from the United States to Iran and the government of Iran without obtaining a license from the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\\". This restricts U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei without a government license. Various U.S.-based companies immediately froze their business with Huawei to comply with the regulation, including Google‚Äîwhich removes its ability to certify future devices and updates for the Android operating system with licensed Google Mobile Services (GMS) such as Google Play Store, as well as Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Xilinx and Western Digital. The German chipmaker Infineon Technologies also voluntarily suspended its business with Huawei, pending \\"assessments\\". It was reported that Huawei did have a limited \\"stockpile\\" of U.S.-sourced parts, obtained prior to the sanctions. On 17 May 2019, Huawei voluntarily suspended its membership to JEDEC, as a temporary measure, \\"until the restrictions imposed by the U.S. government are removed\\". Speaking to Chinese media, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei accused U.S. politicians of underestimating the company's strength, and explained that \\"in terms of 5G technologies, others won't be able to catch up with Huawei in two or three years. We have sacrificed ourselves and our families for our ideal, to stand on top of the world. To reach this ideal, sooner or later there will be conflict with the US.\\" Kevin Wolf, an international trade lawyer and former assistant secretary of commerce for export administration during the Obama administration, argued that Huawei could not even use the open source Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code, as it could fall under U.S. trade regulations as technology of U.S. origin because Google is the majority developer. In China, it is normal for Android phones (including those of Huawei) to not include Google Play Store or GMS, as Google does not do business in the region. Phones are typically bundled with an AOSP-based distribution built around an OEM's own software suite, including either a first-party app store run by the OEM (such as Huawei's own AppGallery) or a third-party service. Google issued a statement assuring that user access to Google Play on existing Huawei devices would not be disrupted. Huawei made a similar pledge of continued support for existing devices, including security patches, but did not make any statements regarding the availability of future Android versions (such as Android 10). On 19 May 2019, the Department of Commerce granted Huawei a temporary, three-month license to continue doing business with U.S. companies for the purposes of maintaining its existing smartphone and telecom products without interruption, whilst long-term solutions are determined. On 22 May 2019, Arm Holdings also suspended its business with Huawei, including all \\"active contracts, support entitlements, and any pending engagements\\". Although it is a Japanese-owned company based in the UK, Arm cited that its intellectual property contained technologies of U.S. origin that it believed were covered under the Department of Commerce order. This prevents Huawei from manufacturing chips that use the ARM architecture. It was also reported that several Asian wireless carriers, including Japan's SoftBank and KDDI, and Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom and Taiwan Mobile, had suspended the sale of upcoming Huawei devices such as the P30 Lite, citing uncertainties over the effects of the U.S. sanctions on the availability of the Android platform. NTT docomo similarly suspended pre-orders of new Huawei phones, without citing any reasoning. On 23 May 2019, it was reported that the SD Association had removed Huawei from its list of members‚Äîimplicating a revocation of its membership to the association. The same day, Toshiba briefly suspended all shipments to Huawei, as a temporary measure while determining whether or not they were selling U.S. made components or technologies to Huawei. Panasonic also stated that it had determined its business relationship to be in compliance with U.S. law, and would not suspend it. The next day, the Wi-Fi Alliance also \\"temporarily restricted\\" Huawei's membership. On 24 May 2019, Huawei told Reuters that FedEx attempted to divert two packages sent from Japan and addressed to Huawei in China to the United States, and tried to divert two more packages sent from Vietnam to Huawei offices elsewhere in Asia, all without their authorization. At first, FedEx China claimed that \\"media reports are not true\\". On May 28, however, they apologized on their Chinese social media account for the fact that \\"a small number of Huawei shipments were misrouted\\", and claimed that \\"there are no external parties that require FedEx to ship these shipments\\". On 29 May 2019, it was reported that Huawei was once again listed as member of JEDEC, the SD Association, and Wi-Fi Alliance. In addition, while the science organization IEEE had initially banned Huawei employees from peer-reviewing papers or handling papers as editors on May 30, 2019, citing legal concerns, that ban was also revoked on June 3, 2019. On 31 May 2019, it was reported that Huawei had temporarily stopped its smartphone production lines. On 17 June 2019, it was reported that Huawei was preparing for a sales drop of US$30 Billion, selling 40 million to 60 million smartphones less than last year in overseas markets. On 29 June 2019 at the G20 summit, Trump and Chinese president and general secretary Xi Jinping agreed to resume trade negotiations. Trump made statements implicating plans to ease the restrictions on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei, explaining that they had sold a \\"tremendous amount of products\\" to the company, that they \\"were not exactly happy that they couldn't sell\\", and that he was referring to \\"equipment where there's no great national security problem with it.\\" BBC News considered this move to be a \\"significant concession\\". On 25 October 2019, Arm Holdings stated that it would continue to allow Huawei to license its technology, as it determined that its recent architectures were sufficiently considered to be of British origin and not subject to the sanctions. On 15 May 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce extended its export restrictions to bar Huawei from producing semiconductors derived from technology or software of U.S. origin, even if the manufacturing is performed overseas. === Replacement operating systems === During the sanctions, it was noted that Huawei had been working on its own in-house operating system codenamed \\"HongMeng OS\\": in an interview with Die Welt, executive Richard Yu stated that an in-house OS could be used as a \\"plan B\\" if it were prevented from using Android or Windows as the result of U.S. action, but that he would \\"prefer to work with the ecosystems of Google and Microsoft\\". Efforts to develop an in-house OS at Huawei date back as far as 2012. Huawei filed trademarks for the names \\"Ark\\", \\"Ark OS\\", and \\"Harmony\\" in Europe, which were speculated to be connected to this OS. In June 2019, Huawei communications VP Andrew Williamson told Reuters that the company was testing HongMeng in China, and that it could be ready \\"in months\\". However, in July 2019, chairman Liang Hua and senior vice president Catherine Chen stated that Hongmeng OS was not actually intended as a mobile operating system for smartphones, and was actually an embedded operating system designed for Internet of things (IoT) hardware. On 19 August 2019, the BIS added 46 \\"non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei to the Entity List because they also pose a significant risk of involvement in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.\\" In September 2019, Huawei began offering the Chinese Linux distribution Deepin as an optional pre-loaded operating system on selected Matebook models in China, as an alternative to Windows. ===Support for Huawei from business partners=== In September 2019, Microsoft's top lawyer and president Brad Smith expressed concern about the continued US ban of Huawei products and services. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, he remarked that the ban shouldn't be imposed without a \\"sound basis in fact, logic, and the rule of law\\". Microsoft Corporation, which supplies Windows 10 for Huawei PCs, says the allegations by the Trump administration that Huawei is a genuine national security threat to the US are not supported by any evidence.Tung, L. (Sept. 2019). \\"Microsoft's top lawyer: Trump's Huawei ban makes no sense\\" . ZDNet. Retrieved January 1st, 2020. ==Human rights abuses== Huawei has been alleged to play a role in the Chinese government's persecution of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang and other ethnic and religious groups. It is also alleged to have forced labour by Uyghurs in its supply chain. On 15 June, 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the country will impose VISA restrictions on Huawei employees as the Chinese company Huawei, provides material support to the Chinese government in carrying human rights abuses. ==Opaque ownership== Huawei claims to be a privately held, employee-owned company: founder Ren Zhengfei retains approximately 1 percent of the shares of Huawei's holding company, Huawei Investment & Holding, with the remainder of the shares held by a trade union committee that also provides services for its staff. This is also due to a limitation in Chinese law preventing limited liability companies from having more than 50 shareholders (the employees' interest is treated as a single share via the union). Although employee shareholders receive dividends, their shares do not entitle them to any direct influence in management decisions. Ren has the power to veto any decision made by the board of directors. A 2019 research paper published by Donald Clarke of George Washington University and Christopher Balding of Fulbright University Vietnam accused Huawei of being \\"effectively state-owned\\" due to this structure \\"if the trade union and its committee function as trade unions generally function in China\\" (being required to be associated with a labor federation tied to the Communist Party). They also claimed that the arrangement was only a profit- sharing arrangement and not actual ownership. Chief secretary of the board Jiang Xisheng disputed the paper, stating that its authors had \\"an incomplete understanding of Huawei's corporate policies and a limited knowledge of its ownership structure\\". Spalding defended the research, telling The Nikkei that \\"believing Huawei would defy Beijing defies credibility. With the Communist Party actively overseeing and enforcing regulations and state interests abroad, it simply does not match the facts of Chinese interest in promoting companies and interests abroad that Huawei could refuse to assist if asked.\\" Some Huawei employees initiated legal challenges against the company regarding the employee stock for the year 2003 on a Chinese court, however both the Shenzhen city Intermediate people's court and the Guangdong province High people's court ruled that their stock ownership are for reference only and there are no legal basis to employees' claims on their ownership of Huawei's stock. On 7 October 2020, the U.K. Parliament's Defence Committee released a report claiming that there was evidence of collusion between Huawei and Chinese state and the Chinese Communist Party. The U.K. Parliament's Defence Committee said that the conclusion was evidenced by Huawei's ownership model and government subsidies it had received. == Treatment of workforce and customers == A U.S. Army Strategic Studies Institute report on Argentina published in September 2007 describes Huawei as \\"known to bribe and trap clients\\". The report details unfair business practices, such as customers framed by \\"full-paid trips\\" to China and monetary \\"presents\\" offered and later used by Huawei as \\"a form of extortion\\". According to a WikiLeaks cable, in 2006, Michael Joseph, then-CEO of Safaricom Ltd, allegedly struggled to cancel a contract with Huawei due to poor after-sales experience, after which the Kenyan government pressured him to reinstate the contract. When questioned regarding this incident, Joseph replied, \\"It [the cable] is not a reflection of the truth as evidenced by Safaricom being a major purchaser of Huawei products including all 3G, switching and the recent OCS billing system upgraded over the weekend.\\" In May 2010, it was reported in The Times of India, that security agencies in India became suspicious of Chinese Huawei employees after learning that Indian employees allegedly did not have access to part of Huawei's Bangalore research and development (R&D;) office building. Huawei responded that the company employs over 2,000 Indian engineers and just 30 Chinese engineers in the R&D; center in Bangalore, and \\"both Indian and Chinese staff have equal access rights to all our information assets and facilities\\". According to The Times of India, the intelligence agencies also noted that Chinese employees of Huawei had extended their stay in Bangalore for many months. Huawei stated that many of these employees were on one-and-a- half-year international assignments to serve as a technical bridge between in- market teams and China, and that \\"all the Chinese employees had valid visas and did not overstay\\". In October 2007, 7,000 Huawei employees resigned and were then rehired on short-term contracts, thereby apparently avoiding the unlimited contract provisions of the Labour Contract Law of the People's Republic of China. The company denied it was exploiting loopholes in the law, while the move was condemned by local government and trade unions. Huawei's treatment of its workforce in Guangdong, Southern China also triggered a media outcry after a 25-year-old software engineer, Hu Xinyu, died in May 2006 from bacterial encephalitis, as a result of what is believed to have been work- related fatigue. In its 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility report, Huawei highlighted the importance of employee health and safety. In 2010, Huawei provided annual health checks to all full-time employees and performed 3,200 checks to employees exposed to occupational health risks. In early 2018, Li Hongyuan was urged to resign by Huawei's HR in Shenzhen. Li asked for compensation based on the Labor Law of China. In late 2018, Huawei's HR transferred 300,000 yuan to Li via a personal account. Then Huawei reported to the police for racketeering and blackmailing because Huawei asserted that Li threatened to \\"report business fraud\\" as a condition of resignation. The police then detained Li on 16 December 2018 and arrested him on 22 January 2019. According to a secret recording tape provided by Li's wife, the two-hour negotiation between Li and Huawei's HR did not mention any Huawei's allegations. Li was released after 251 days in prison. In December 2019, The Guardian reported that police are commonly deployed against former employees, thereby raising questions on Huawei's links to the state. Reports and trending hashtags about the detentions have been censored in China, and the Communist Youth League of China posted an article online claiming that protesters in Hong Kong had passed information about Li's case to destabilise China after The Guardian reported the case. == State subsidy and dumping == According to a report, Huawei have been working closely with the China Development Bank in foreign markets since 2004. Huawei has been reported to be a key recipient of Chinese state subsidies, having acquired land for facilities and employee housing at significantly below-market prices, receiving state grants for its R&D; activities and being a key recipient of export financing with state loans being granted to overseas customers to fund their purchases of Huawei equipment. The Central Intelligence Agency has claimed that it is in possession of unreleased evidence that confirms that Huawei has been funded by China's military and intelligence agencies. In year 2011, the U.S. Export- Import Bank President Fred Hochberg alleged the China Development Bank credit as one of the main reason behind Huawei's rapid growth, however Huawei rejected the claim as \\"fundamentally incorrect\\" despite admitting the existence of those credits. In 2012, Huawei president Ren Zhengfei have stated that, \\"without government protection, Huawei would no longer be alive.\\" In 2013, European Union found that Huawei and ZTE have violated EU's anti-dumping and anti-subsidy guidelines, however Huawei denied the finding and claim they are always playing fairly. In 2016, The Indian government found that Chinese telecommunication equipment makers including Huawei have been continually dumping equipment into the Indian market and causing injury to local companies. As a result, the Indian government applied an anti-dumping duty to equipment imported from Chinese equipment makers, including Huawei. The duties applied to Huawei were levied at a rate of 37.73%. ==Alleged violation of economic sanctions and technology theft== === Iran === On 25 October 2012, the Reuters news agency published a report, based on documents and interviews, alleging an Iranian-based seller of Huawei (Soda Gostar Persian Vista) tried to sell embargoed American antenna equipment (made by American company Andrew LLC) to an Iranian firm (MTN Irancell). Specifically, the Andrew antennas were part of a large order for Huawei telecommunications gear that MTN Irancell had placed through Soda Gostar, but the MTN Irancell says it cancelled the deal with Huawei when it learned the items were subject to sanctions and before any equipment was delivered. Vic Guyang, a Huawei spokesman, acknowledged that MTN Irancell had cancelled the order; Rick Aspan, a spokesman for CommScope, said the company was not aware of the aborted transaction. In December 2012, Reuters reported the \\"deep links\\" existed as early as 2010 between Huawei through Meng Wanzhou (who was then CFO of the firm) and an Iranian telecom importer named Skycom. At least 1.3 million Euros worth of embargoed Hewlett- Packard computer equipment was sold to \\"Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in late 2010\\". The next month, Reuters detailed more Huawei behaviour, including direct governance by Meng of Skycom. Meanwhile, the US had long- standing sanctions on Iran, including against the importation of US technology goods into Iran. At some point in 2018, the US Attorney-General filed charges in court against Huawei and, in particular, Meng. In April 2018, it was reported that the U.S. Justice Department had joined the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, and the Department of Commerce, to investigate possible violations of economic sanctions by Huawei for its provision of equipment in Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela. The U.S. inquiry stems from an earlier sanctions-violation probe that ultimately led to penalties against ZTE.Sheridan Prasso (25 April 2018). \\"Huawei Said to Be Probed by FBI for Possible Iran Violations\\" . Bloomberg Technology. Retrieved 9 August 2018. On 1 December 2018, Huawei vice-chairwoman and CFO Meng Wanzhou, daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada at the request of U.S. authorities. She faces extradition to the United States on charges of violating sanctions against Iran. 22 August 2018 arrest warrant was issued by the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Meng is \\"charged with conspiracy to defraud multiple international institutions\\", according to the prosecutor. The warrant was based on allegations of a conspiracy to defraud banks which were clearing money that was claimed to be for Huawei, but was actually for Skycom, an entity claimed to be entirely controlled by Huawei, which was said to be dealing in Iran, contrary to sanctions. None of the allegations have been proven in court. On 11 December 2018, Meng Wanzhou was released on bail. On 28 January 2019, U.S. federal prosecutors formally indicted Meng Wanzhou and Huawei with thirteen counts of bank and wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and misappropriating trade secrets. The Department also filed a formal extradition request for Meng with Canadian authorities that same day. Huawei responded to the charges and that it \\"denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations\\", as well as asserted Meng was similarly innocent. The China Ministry of Industry and Information Technology believed the charges brought on by the United States were \\"unfair\\". In May 2019, Chinese authorities arrested Canadian former diplomat Michael Kovrig and consultant Michael Spavor on charges of espionage. This was widely seen as a retaliatory move from the Chinese authorities, and other subsequent arrests were also questioned. These arrests have been viewed as hostage diplomacy, as has the subsequent arrest of Australian Yang Hengjun. In November 2019, Huawei announced that it will pay RMB2 billion (US$286 million) in bonuses to its staff, and double their October salaries, as a reward for their efforts to counter the effect of recent U.S. trade sanctions on their supply chain. \\"Canada is not the only one grappling with the Gordian knot of national security, global alliance and competitive market issues that Huawei represents,\\" wrote the Financial Post in December 2019, noting that Australia and New Zealand have banned Huawei equipment, Britain is weighing its options, and the situation in the United States is \\"complicated\\". On 27 May 2020, Meng lost her bid for freedom in the B.C. Supreme Court of Heather Holmes. She remained held in Vancouver on the extradition matter while her file was processed. The B.C. Supreme Court judge ruling that extradition proceedings against the Huawei executive should proceed, denying the claim of double criminality brought by Meng's defense team. It was noted that Meng could appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and then finally to the Minister of Justice. In June 2020, it came to light that more paper trail existed between Meng and Skycom, the Iranian importer of sanctioned US technology. The paper trail purported to show how Meng attempted to insulate Huawei and herself by fig-leaf from clearly violating the sanctions regime. The charges against Meng include that she met the deputy head at HSBC of global banking for the Asia- Pacific region and that she made \\"numerous misrepresentations regarding Huawei's ownership and control of Skycom.\\" === Iraq === According to a report by Iraqi official, Huawei supplied \\"optic fibre and switching equipment\\" to Iraqi military in year 2001‚Äì2002 when the country was ruled by Saddam Hussein's government during the Ba'athist Iraq period, violating 1991 United Nation sanctions. Huawei denied the claims. === Syria === In 2019, Reuters reported that Huawei was linked to a suspicious front company in Mauritius which has conducted operations in Syria - despite Huawei's claim that they are unrelated. === Taliban === See #Taliban_2 section. === North Korea === In 2019, Washington Post reported that Huawei was linked to a suspicious Chinese state-owned firm which has conducted operations in North Korea. == Link to surveillance program == === China === Huawei have been reported as one of the key suppliers for China's Great Firewall of China internet censorship program. Huawei is also reported to have worked closely with the Communist Party of China to enable surveillance of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. In 2018, Huawei signed an agreement with the Xinjiang public security bureau for the creation of an \\"intelligent security industry\\" hub. === Iran === In October 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported that Huawei had become Iran's leading provider of telecommunications equipment, including monitoring technologies that could be used for surveillance. Huawei responded with a statement claiming the story misrepresented the company's involvement: \\"We have never been involved and do not provide any services relating to monitoring or filtering technologies and equipment anywhere in the world\\". === Russia === According to report, Russian telecom equipment manufacturer Bulat was in talk with Huawei to acquire technology to store user data when they are using the network. === Taliban === In 2001, it was alleged that Huawei Technologies India had developed telecommunications surveillance equipment for the Taliban in Afghanistan, and newspapers reported that the Indian government had launched a probe into the firm's operations. Huawei responded, stating that the company did not have \\"any link with the Taliban\\", as its only customers are telecommunications carriers and its facilities \\"always operate according to U.N. rules and the local laws of each country\\". On 15 December 2001, the Indian authorities announced that they had not found any evidence that Huawei India had any connection to the Taliban, although the U.S. remains suspicious. == Misleading marketing == === Benchmark cheating === In September 2018, AnandTech reported that recent Huawei and Honor phones, including the Huawei P20 and Honor Play, had been configured to activate a high-performance mode when certain benchmarking software was detected, causing increased frame rates at the expense of efficiency and battery life. A Huawei executive admitted that the company was attempting to compete with domestic vendors, including one it accused of providing \\"unrealistic\\" scores. However, he also expressed an opinion that manufacturers should evaluate their phones on benchmarks that more accurately reflect real-world use, and that the company would vet its benchmark scores via third-parties before publishing them as promotional material. After confirming the behavior with a version of its software that could not be easily detected, 3DMark delisted scores for several Huawei and Honor devices from its database. Huawei subsequently announced that it would add a \\"Performance Mode\\" feature to its EMUI 9 software, allowing users to enable this state on-demand to improve performance of apps such as games. === Cameras === On several occasions, Huawei has issued promotional materials promoting the camera capabilities on its smartphones, that were later found to have actually used professional DSLR cameras instead. In 2015, Huawei posted a promotional photo on Google+ featuring Ella Woodward bathed in a sunrise, asking readers to share their own photos of the sunrise taken with the Huawei P9‚Äîas aided by its low-light capabilities. It was pointed out that Exif metadata on the photo identified it as having been taken with a Canon EOS 5D Mark III, and the wording and intent of the post could potentially mislead readers into believing that the photo itself was also taken with a P9. Huawei pulled the post and apologized, stating that it was meant to \\"inspire our community\\", and that the caption should have been more clear. In 2018, behind- the-scenes photos from the filming of a Nova 3 commercial by Huawei's Egyptian branch revealed that a DSLR had been used for certain scenes, implied to have been taken with the phone itself during the commercial. An actor was seen miming the taking of a selfie, without actually having a phone in his hand. It is not explicitly disclaimed in the ad. In its promotion of the Huawei P30, the company was caught using stock photos on promotional posts for the device on Sina Weibo. The posts were later amended with fine print stating that they were for \\"reference\\" purposes only. A new AI mode on the P30 is designed for taking photos of the Moon, and states that it can \\"adequately capture the beauty of the moon along with fine details like moonbeams and shadows\\". However, it was later discovered that this mode merely composes existing imagery of the moon into the photo. ==National politics== ===China=== ====Huawei Mate 10 Islamic feature dispute==== In November 2017, Chinese users discovered the Salah (Islamic prayer) notification feature in Huawei Mate 10 phone, on the company's website for Mainland China. It was viewed as an unjustified promotion of Islam given that Muslims are a minority religious group in Mainland China that make up only about 1‚Äì2% of the population. Significant backlash has formed on the Chinese internet and some have even tried to boycott Huawei phones for including such feature, and make fun of the phone by calling it \\"the first phone with a Halal prayer feature\\" and describe the event as the \\"Islamic conversion of Huawei\\". Later, Huawei published an official statement via Sina Weibo, stating that the feature was only a personalized notification service designed for \\"certain overseas regions\\" that was not available in China. Netizens questioned why promotion of that feature was available on the company's Chinese website in the first place if that was not the intended area but those comments were deleted before getting any response. A Taoist priest commented that the mosque-finding service on the device was also available in mainland China, inconsistent with the official explanation about these religious features. After Huawei published the official statement, many news reports and discussions made on Chinese online media or Chinese discussion platforms were made inaccessible or removed from the internet. ====Chou Tzu-yu Republic of China flag incident==== In January 2016, people found out that Chou Tzu-yu, a Taiwanese artist performing at South Korea and endorsed the Huawei Y6 in advertisement beforehand, was displaying the flag of Republic of China in a Korean entertainment show and accused the artist's behavior as supporting Taiwanese independence. As a response to the discovery, Huawei announced on the official forum that the arrangement was decided by their South Korean carrier partner LG U+ and they have already told LG U+ to terminate their cooperation with Chou Tzu-yu and her agency company. However LG U+ rejected the statement and claim their contract with the artist are still valid despite disputes. Chinese netizens have called for boycotting Huawei phones as a form of protest. ====P-series phones listing Taiwan as a separate country==== In August 2019 Chinese netizens criticized Huawei because their P-series phones listed Taiwan as a separate country when set to use traditional Chinese characters. Chinese netizens called for a boycott of Huawei using the Weibo hashtag #HuaweiGetoutofChina (Âçé‰∏∫ÊªöÂá∫‰∏≠ÂõΩ) and accused the company of supporting separatism. == See also == * Mass surveillance ** List of government mass surveillance projects ** Mass surveillance in the United States *** Cisco Systems *** Crypto AG ** Mass surveillance in Australia ** Mass surveillance in China == References == Category:Huawei Huawei ","title":"Criticism of Huawei"},{"id":"60408995","text":"Yang Liu is a Chinese-American immunologist. He serves as director of the Division of Immunotherapy, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland Baltimore. == Biography == Liu was an associate research scientist at Yale School of Medicine, and then an assistant, and subsequently associate professor at the New York University Medical Center from 1992 to 1998. From 1998 to 2006, he was the Kurtz Chair Professor and the director of Division of Cancer Immunology, Department of Pathology, at the Ohio State University. From 2006 to 2012, he was the De Nancrede Professor and The director of Division of Immunotherapy in the department of surgery at the University of Michigan. From 2012 to 2017, he was the Bosworth Professor and the director for the Center for Cancer and Immunology Research at The Children's National Medical Center. He is currently professor and the director at the Division of Immunotherapy, the Institute of Human Virology and the department of surgery at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Liu is also the founder of OncoImmune, Inc. and serves as its chairman. == Research == Dr. Liu's research focuses on an age-old question: why do microbes induce life-long sterilizing immunity while cancer cannot? His interest in this question was kindled when he made the observation that viral activation of host antigen-presenting cells fundamentally altered the requirement for activation of CD8+ T cells when he was a graduate student at Australian National University. In his subsequent studies in Janeway laboratory at Yale University, he provided the first evidence that components from a diverse origin of microbes, which was called pathogen-associated molecular patterns by Janeway, induce co-stimulatory activity in antigen-presenting cells, and proposed that microbial induction of co-stimulatory molecules explains how the immune system distinguishes between ‚Äúinfectious non-self and non-infectious self‚Äù Liu Y, Janeway CA Jr. Cells that present both specific ligand and costimulatory activity are the most efficient inducers of clonal expansion of normal CD4 T cells. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992; 89(9):3845-9. . Later work from Dr. Liu's laboratory demonstrated that induction of B7-1 and B7-2 explains the function of infection on adaptive immunity.

Wagner was the first chairman of this agency and helped to consolidate the commonwealth's school districts. Wagner actually did not retire in 1964. Wagner had run for re-election on November 4, 1964 against Albert I. Nagle. The returns of the votes from the polls indicated that Nagle led by less than 600 votes.The Morning Call, Allentown, Pa., November 4, 1964, p.14 Attention then focused on 2,800 absentee ballots. When the Board of Elections met to count these, both candidates immediately entered challenges to a substantial number of the ballots before the envelopes containing those ballots were opened. After a hearing the Board filed its decision overruling the challenges in some instances and sustaining them in others. Both candidates then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County questioning the legality of the Board's decision. Subsequently, the court ruled to sustain the decision of the Board in part and reversing it in part. Wagner then filed an appeal. By the time the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided to affirm, the next election cycle had taken place (November 1966), and neither Wagner nor Nagle were able to claim the seat.See Westlaw, Pennsylvania Reporter, The Absentee Ballots Case, 423 Pa. 504 (1966) After he retired from politics, Wagner became president of the First National Bank, Tamaqua.

Nothing is known of Alsdorff's origins, and no record of his birth has been discovered. For many years he was a schoolmaster; his name appeared in a history of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, years after his death. His earliest dated Fraktur is a piece made for a student in Earl Township in that county in December 1791. Evidence shows that his career took him to Montgomery and Dauphin Counties as well as Lancaster County, and later in life to Mifflin County as well. Stylistically his paintings indicate a familiarity with the work of the brothers Johann Adam and Johann Friedrich Eyer; in turn, his work influenced the art of Christian Strenge. He also appears to have been aware of the work made at Ephrata Cloister. Much of Alsdorff's work was made for the Mennonite community. It includes books of musical notation, religious texts, writing examples, bookplates, and presentation pieces, all related in some fashion to educational endeavors. Five works attributed to Alsdorff, all originally from Earl Township, are in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:1838 deaths Category:American male painters Category:18th-century American painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:Fraktur artists Category:People from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Christian Alsdorff"},{"id":"60409035","text":"Peter John Streams (born 8 March 1935) is a former British diplomat.

It was constructed in two phases and has a total generating capacity of 570.4 megawatts (MW), becoming the largest such facility in the state upon its completion in 2012. ==Facility details== Flat Ridge 1 was jointly developed, financed, and continues to be jointly owned by BP Alternative Energy and Westar Energy. BP is also selling its share of the power generated to Westar, which is the largest electricity distributor in Kansas. This initial phase consists of 40 Clipper Liberty C96 wind turbines, each rated at 2.5 MW, for a total capacity of 100 MW. Construction began in May 2008 covering about 5,000 acres of farm and ranch land in eastern Barber County. Signal Wind Energy was awarded the contract to erect the turbines and build the balance of the plant; including all access roads, turbine foundations, and the electrical collection and transmission system. Flat Ridge 1 was fully online by the middle of 2009, and is operated and maintained by BP's AE Power Services. Flat Ridge 2 was initially developed by BP Alternative Energy for a capacity of 419.2 MW, and was then expanded by 51.2 MW to meet further demand. This phase consists of 294 GE 1.6 MW wind turbines. The electricity is being sold under separate power purchase agreements to utilities in Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana. BP and Sempra Energy jointly own and financed the nearly $800 million project. Blattner Energy was awarded the construction contract for phase 2. It is thus far one of the largest projects in the U.S. to be built in a single phase, creating about 500 construction jobs, and 30 long-term positions.

It has been reported that he returned to Germany, but this is uncertain, and it seems more likely that he remained in the United States at the conclusion of the war. In 1787 he established a business purchasing pre-printed baptismal records which he would then further embellish for sale; eventually he had forms of his own printed, many in Reading, Pennsylvania. He painted many handmade examples as well. The majority of his work consists of baptismal certificates, but he produced many other pieces as well. These include drawings of various sacred and secular subjects; broadsides of Adam and Eve, used as marriage certificates; mazes; a clock face; and handboxes.

The party contested the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections across all the constituencies in Karnataka. ==History== In August 2017, Kannada Actor and Director Upendra Rao, known for his realism in movie direction, announced that he will stepping into administration and governance by starting his own political party under a socialist concept Prajakeeya (translates to 'people- centric') as opposed to Rajakeeya (translates to 'politics'). ===Karnataka Pragnyavantha Janatha Party=== He extended his support to an already existing politician, Mahesh Gowda and jointly formed a party called Karnataka Pragnyavantha Janatha Paksha (KPJP) and invited suggestions from the general public on improving various aspects of administration. However, due to differences in ideologies with Mahesh, Upendra left the party in March 2018, stating that Mahesh's involvement in internal party corruption was not in line with his ideology of complete transparency and non-corruption. Mahesh Gowda alleged that Upendra was acting like a dictator within the party. Sources inside KPJP refuted this, stating that Upendra had not taken it well when a video of certain people offering money to Gowda in exchange for party seats, had surfaced. Upendra believed that this was against his core concept of Prajakeeya. In May 2018, KPJP elected legislator R Shankar won the Ranibennur assembly seat and was seen supporting Congress after having extended support to BJP earlier that morning, prior to the results. ===Uttama Prajaakeeya Party=== Following his exit from KPJP, Upendra launched his party called Uttama Prajakeeya Party (acronym UPP) with a new manifesto based on ART of governance (acronym for Accountability, Responsibility and Transparency). Upendra registered the party and had the symbol 'auto-rickshaw' registered with the Election Commission. UPP contested the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections with candidates in all 28 constituencies in Karnataka, with a strict rule against celebrities and only ordinary citizens with no criminal records or any corruption charges against them as the UPP candidates. [20] Upendra himself did not contest the said elections. ==Ideology== Upendra built the idea for a regional party in Karnataka based on Prajakeeya (people-oriented). This would focus mainly on the labour class with education, health and transparency in governance, detailed in his party manifesto. UPP has created a five-point program to convince people of their commitment to democratic principles: Selection, Election, Correction, Rejection, Promotion. The ideology is built around the fact that citizen take an active role in the selection and election process and the people reserve the right to expel or promote an elected representative, based on their performance. Prajakeeya revolves around the primary socialist sub-aspect of democracy as being \\"for the people\\". Additionally, administration is to be treated as a service and, as opposed to Rajakeeya, the elected administrators are supposed to be the servants of the people. Also, by conducting polls before sanctioning public projects, the control to make administrative decisions is extended to the general citizen. Upendra also stressed on the need for a regional party to exist, so as to understand the issues with a particular region and act accordingly. Party candidature is extended to the open public and candidates are chosen via a written test (based on the candidates reason for joining politics, their developmental plans, etc.,), an interview and extensive background check. Additionally, candidates are expected to wear a uniform resembling a working structure as in any private establishment. UPP has also eliminated the need for a party fund and the party runs without any monetary backup. ==Electoral Performance== As per EC of India, UPP is a registered, yet a non-recognized party as of 2019. UPP had candidates from various backgrounds contest the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections across all the constituencies of Karnataka. As a party, UPP was not involved in any extensive on-the-ground promotional campaigns for the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, as the party founder believes that the existence of technology in the current age negates the need for ground promotional campaigns and most of their campaigning was on social media. == References == ==External links== *Official Website Category:Political parties in Karnataka Category:Political parties in India ","title":"Uttama Prajakeeya Party"},{"id":"60409356","text":"Annie Maria V. Green and her husband William \\"Will\\" M. Green moved from Franklin, Pennsylvania, as pioneers of the Union Colony of Colorado (now known as Greeley, Colorado) in 1870. With their two children, and the addition of two more in Greeley, they were one white American farming family amid the great invasion of the North American West by many eastern U.S. families after the Civil War. Green was incredibly miserable throughout her sixteen years on the Great American Desert. She and her husband Will worked very hard to make their living in the newly established American town, and Green became one of the first published Colorado writers (although she would doubtlessly be resentful to be identified with Colorado.) She documented their struggles and her budding literary and thespian ambitions in her memoir, Sixteen Years on the Great American Desert; Or, The Trials and Triumphs of a Frontier Life.Sixteen Years on the Great American Desert; Or, The Trials and Triumphs of a Frontier Life (1887). == Family == Annie Maria Green was married to William \\"Will\\" M. Green, and had 2 children before moving to Greeley, Colorado. While she lived in Greeley, Colorado, she gave birth to two more children. There is not much known about the identities of her children other than her claim that they became \\"natural Coloradoans.\\" == Life in the New Union Colony == The Union Colony of Colorado (also known as Greeley, Colorado) was organized as a colony in late 1869 by Nathan Meeker and Horace Greeley as an irrigated farming settlement. Nathan Meeker worked for The New York Tribune at the time as the paper's agricultural editor and posted an ad for the establishment of a new colony in the Territory of Colorado. He used Greeley as an offer to start over and build a new life among \\"a middle-class community and sought settlers who abstained from alcohol, were literate, and possessed 'high moral standards.' \\"In April 1870, 144 families traveled westward on the railroad to settle in 'Union Colony.' This new society gained national publicity thorough the support and praise of Horace Greeley with his phrase \\"Go west, young man.\\" The settler families began building irrigation ditches and creating farming colonies. The Union Colony of Colorado \\"attracted hard- working, temperate, family oriented people. The colony survived and prospered because it placed emphasis on working together for the benefit of all, particularly by supporting public education and culture, but still allowed for exceptionally hard working and innovative people to become prosperous in their own right.\\" Green describes life in the early Union Colony as very difficult, and told friends that she regretted moving there. Due to her boredom, she decided to open the colony's first school but after two weeks she reluctantly gave it up to care for an ill friend. On July 4, 1870, Green received a letter from a friend back home asking her if she could join her in Colorado. Green replied to her letter stating that she should be content where she is, and to pray for her unfortunate and unhappy friend (herself). In order to make ends meet in their earliest days in the Union Colony, Annie's husband started a job at a coal mine which required him to be five miles away from his wife. While her husband Will was away, Annie began making and selling bread for people who would come by, but swore her children to secrecy so their father would never find out. This went on for some time until one night while they were eating dinner after Will's return, there was a knock at the door and the man who bought bread earlier had come back to buy more, outing Annie as working behind her husband's back. Will was understanding though, and instead of belittling her, he simply stated that if she thought it was the best option, he would support her efforts to help the family. == Memoir == Annie Maria Green wrote a memoir about her experiences in Greeley, Colorado and some experiences in Fort Collins, Colorado. In her memoir, Sixteen Years on the Great American Desert; Or, The Trials and Triumphs of a Frontier Life, she writes about Greeley, in \\"a sort of dark-comedy satire on settler hype reminding us once again that farming was much a gamble as mining.\\" Green began writing the memoir as a way to pass the time and ignore her loneliness. As time went on, she found herself writing in it more and more. She began writing everything in the memoir, her poems, songs, various letters she received, and some conversations she had. She documented many notable events in the early Union Colony, most of them unfortunate: floods, tornadoes, deaths in the family, and the ceremony for the late Nathan Meeker and his wife and daughter who were captured during the Meeker Massacre on Colorado's Western Slope in 1879. The book recounts multiple disasters that occur during Annie and Will's time in the New Union Colony. It begins \\"with a train wreck on the way out, and moving on to bad weather, locusts, and diverse calamities incidental to farming.\\" She describes the constant struggle to find a way to make money on the side as opposed to completely relying on farming because it was unreliable and there were many obstacles they had to overcome in order to be successful farmers. She states one of her side jobs in her memoir: \\"the only alternative was to mortgage our grain in order to raise the money.\\" As time goes on in her memoir, Green begins to grow fond of Greeley and the people in it, despite all the hardships she endured. She describes becoming a playwright in order to make ends meet, and founded an amateur acting troupe, the Union Colony Victim Company to stage her play \\"Ten Years on the Great American Desert\\" in Barnum Hall.https://history.weldgov.com/county_150/entertainment_in_weld/dullsville_usa She states in her memoir of 1887 that she is returning to her home in Franklin, Pennsylvania. However, she writes that \\"Greeley is now a 'handsome little city,' a 'prosperous city' with ' the best of hotel accommodation good theaters,' pure artesian water,' 'electric light,' excellent schools and churches.\\" == Significance == Annie Maria V. Green's memoir about her experiences in the Union Colony of Colorado is vastly different from any other previous writings on the west. Unlike the other writings and propaganda of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush and the California Gold Rush, Green's memoir is a sarcastic lament by an easterner about the challenges U.S. Americans could face moving west. Her memoir revolves around all of the pain, destruction, and lack of success her family faced as a result. She specifically tells her friend in her memoir not to move west because it is all a bunch of propaganda and she is not happy. On top of being a corrective to popular propaganda about the West, her memoir is a unique look into the lives of American women and farmers in the U.S. West after the Civil War. == References == Category:19th- century American women writers ","title":"Annie Maria V.

A non-empty family of sets is a delta-matroid if, for every two sets E and F in the family, and for every element e in their symmetric difference E\\\\triangle F, there exists an f\\\\in E\\\\triangle F such that E\\\\triangle\\\\\\\\{e,f\\\\\\\\} is in the family. For the basis sets of a matroid, the corresponding exchange axiom requires in addition that e\\\\in E and f\\\\in F, ensuring that E and F have the same cardinality. For a delta-matroid, either of the two elements may belong to either of the two sets, and it is also allowed for the two elements to be equal. An alternative and equivalent definition is that a family of sets forms a delta-matroid when the convex hull of its indicator vectors (the analogue of a matroid polytope) has the property that every edge length is either one or the square root of two. Delta-matroids were defined by Andr√© Bouchet in 1987. Algorithms for matroid intersection and the matroid parity problem can be extended to some cases of delta-matroids. Delta-matroids have also been used to study constraint satisfaction problems. As a special case, an even delta-matroid is a delta-matroid in which either all sets have even number of elements, or all sets have an odd number of elements. If a constraint satisfaction problem has a Boolean variable on each edge of a planar graph, and if the variables of the edges incident to each vertex of the graph are constrained to belong to an even delta-matroid (possibly a different even delta-matroid for each vertex), then the problem can be solved in polynomial time. This result plays a key role in a characterization of the planar Boolean constraint satisfaction problems that can be solved in polynomial time. ==References== Category:Matroid theory ","title":"Delta-matroid"},{"id":"60409400","text":"Lakovic or Lakoviƒç (Serbian Cyrillic: –õ–∞–∫–æ–≤–∏—õ) is a gender-neutral Slavic surname that may refer to *Elvir Lakoviƒá Laka (born 1969), Bosnian rock singer-songwriter *Jaka Lakoviƒç (born 1978), Slovenian basketball player and coach *Predrag Lakoviƒá (1929‚Äì1997), Serbian actor *Sasha Lakovic (1971‚Äì2017), Canadian ice hockey player ","title":"Lakovic"},{"id":"60409416","text":"Sargin, ≈†argin, Sargƒ±n or Shargin (Cyrillic: –®–∞—Ä–≥–∏–Ω) may refer to *Sargƒ±n, Gerc√º≈ü, a village in Turkey *Nada ≈†argin (born 1977), Serbian actress *Yuri Shargin (born 1960), Russian cosmonaut ","title":"Sargin"},{"id":"60409419","text":"Guariglia is a surname.

It will be deep with volume of approximately , making it the world's deepest pool upon its expected completion in 2021. The Blue Abyss pool will be used for training and development for commercial diving, space exploration, human life science, and submersibles. This pool could aid in reducing risk in extreme environments, including space and the sub-aquatic. == The pool == The pool itself will have several entrance points and includes a series of depths. The multi-level depths of the pool has many functions, including 'Astrolab' at . The total surface area of the pool is planned to be , and its deepest point at , giving a total volume of 42,000 m^3of water. The pool was designed by architect Robin Partington. The pool should officially open in spring of 2021. The facility itself includes: * A multi-layered pool * Sliding roof to facilitate insertion of larger objects into pool *Astronaut training centre *Hypobaric and hyperbaric chambers *Microgravity suite * Training center with six classrooms * Diving quality compressed gas supply (air and nitrox) * Secure workshops, lay down areas and storage * Onsite catering * Hotel == Commercial diving == The Blue Abyss will aid in testing, training, and pre-operational exercises for the commercial diving sector. The pools indoor facility will allow for diving any time and year round. The facility will not be dependent on weather. A 30-tonne crane and lifting platforms will allow for roof access to the pool, and the sliding room will facilitate access to insert larger training objects into the pool. The pool will allow for deep water training for offshore and inshore commercial divers and diving teams. This training will include scenarios and conditions that otherwise would be impossible for safe diving training. This would allow for an acceleration of emergency services, oceanographic research, archaeology, and civil engineering. == Submersibles == Submersible vehicles are a new alternative to classic diving methods. The indoor pool will permit a controlled environment allowing for submersible trials and training, including simulations. This would reduce the risk of subsea operations by moving trials and training into a safe and heavily monitored facility. Testing and training is expected to include hydrographic, pipeline and cable surveys, inspections of wind turbine foundations, vessel hulls and installations, oceanographic studies, and even film production. The pool will include roof access, as well as an R&D; capability for new ROV and AUV sub-systems. == Space exploration == The Blue Abyss will provide a tourism market for spaceflight simulation, like a mission to Mars simulation. Not only could this birth a tourist industry, but it will offer safety and experience for astronauts undergoing human spaceflight training. The facility will include a neutral buoyancy pool, parabolic flight and centrifuge training, hypo and hyperbolic chambers and micro-gravity simulation suite, and an environmental research centre. == Human life science == The centre will provides human physiology and human robotic interface R&D; capabilities. This will allow for extreme environment research, including human spaceflight. The Kuehnegger Human Performance Centre will have astronaut and athlete test and evaluation facilities, with full-body suspension and hypobaric chambers for altitude training. ==References== ==External links== * *Kuehnegger Human Performance Centre Category:Swimming venues in England Category:Buildings and structures in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral Category:Research and development in the United Kingdom Category:Space industry ","title":"Blue Abyss"},{"id":"60409431","text":"Stupica or Stupitsa (; Cyrillic: –°—Ç—É–ø–∏—Ü–∞) is a Slavic surname that means a trap, wheel hub assembly.

It is an unsigned route in the Philippine highway network classified by the Department of Public Works and Highways as a national tertiary road. The two-lane avenue is the longest of the city's national roads. Portions of it are prone to flooding from the Tullahan River which flows just north of the avenue in east-central Malabon. ==History== The avenue was named after Wenceslao Pascual, a native of Malabon who was the 17th Governor of Rizal from 1952-1955. The ancestral house in Hulong Duhat built in 1930 and designed by Juan Nakpil where the former governor was born is preserved by the government through a local ordinance. Construction of the avenue commenced in September 1954 under the governorship of Wenceslao Pascual. It was completed in August 1970 and inaugurated in December of that year by Governor Isidro Rodriguez and members of the Rizal Provincial Board. The avenue, initially named Concepcion‚ÄìPotrero Road, Isabel Avenue and also earlier called Bagong Daan by local residents, was converted by the Department of Public Works and Highways from a provincial road to a national road in 1984. ==Route description== Governor Pascual Avenue west of Sanciangco Street in Catmon Robinsons Town Mall Malabon on Governor Pascual Avenue Governor Pascual Avenue forms a major spine of Malabon connecting the villages of Potrero, Tinajeros, Acacia, Tugatog, Catmon, Baritan and Concepcion. It travels in a roughly east-west orientation following the curves of the Tullahan River from Potrero in the east to Concepcion in the west. From its eastern terminus at a small traffic circle called Pinagtipunan Circle that links up with MacArthur Highway in Potrero, the avenue runs to the northwest for through mainly industrial areas across Malabon's largest village. At its east end, the Malabon Zoo and Potrero Elementary School stand as notable landmarks. It turns to the west-southwest by the GIC Compound Industrial Road and crosses the Philippine National Railways line below the elevated North Luzon Expressway Segment 10 which marks the western boundary of Potrero. From this junction where the Governor Pascual railway station is located, the avenue serves as the dividing line between Tinajeros and Acacia and also links to the northern edge of Tugatog near the intersection of Marcelo H. del Pilar Street. Along this section of Governor Pascual Avenue are many commercial establishments including Robinsons Town Mall Malabon. The avenue then winds its way through the heavily populated village of Catmon where the Malabon People's Park is located at a small side road just off Sanciangco Street. It then heads for an open marshland just before crossing the Lambingan Bridge to Concepcion over the Tullahan River. West of the Lambingan Bridge, the avenue runs along the boundary between Baritan on the north side and Concepcion on the south. This section of the avenue north of Malabon's poblacion is known for its gastronomic culture and is home to several restaurants serving the city's native delicacies such as kakanin and Pancit Malabon, including Dolor's at Bernardo Street and Nanay's Pancit Malabon at Santa Ana Street. It is also the location of the Jos√© Rizal campus of Arellano University and the City of Malabon Polytechnic Institute. The avenue terminates at General Luna Street just north of the Concepcion Public Market. ==References== Category:Streets in Metro Manila ","title":"Governor Pascual Avenue"},{"id":"60409731","text":"This big LCBO warehouse is going to be the centre of an 11 acre knot of condos known as Sugar Wharf.

It is one of Cherryh's Merchanter novels and is set in the author's Alliance‚ÄìUnion universe. It is the first new novel in this universe to be published in 10 years, the previous being Regenesis in 2009, and the first Merchanter novel in 22 years, the previous being Finity's End in 1997. Alliance Rising is the first book in The Hinder Stars series, and is the first science fiction collaboration between Cherryh and her partner, Fancher. It takes place in the early Alliance‚ÄìUnion timeline, before the events in Downbelow Station (1981) and the founding of the Merchanter's Alliance. Alliance Rising won the 2020 Prometheus Award for best novel. ==Plot summary== Alliance Rising takes place on Alpha Station, a space station located at Barnard's Star, about 6 light-years from Earth. It was the first of nine star-stations constructed by the Earth Company during Earth's outward push into space, and they became known as the Hinder Stars. Further exploration led to the construction of new stations, which later broke away from Earth after the discovery of faster-than-light (FTL) travel. No FTL jump points were found between Earth and Alpha, which restricted EC's control of their stations. Trade between space stations was conducted by family-run merchanter ships. In an attempt to regain control of Alpha Station, EC sent Andrew Cruz to Alpha to manage the building of The Rights of Man, a large FTL ship using stolen plans for Finity's End, a merchant ship based at Pell Station. Earth neglected maintenance of Alpha and focused on the construction of Rights. Stationmaster Ben Abrezio attempted to placate both EC and the merchanters, upon whose trade the station became dependent. A decade later construction of Rights is complete, but its first test run is a disaster and has to be aborted due to system failures. Finity's End arrives at Alpha, fuelling speculation that Pell wants to wrestle control of Alpha from the Earth Company. But Finity's real purpose is revealed to be the establishment of an alliance between all merchanter ships that would unite them against the Earth Company and stations attempting to control them. Finitys senior captain, JR Neihart, tells the merchanter captains that once jump points between Earth and Alpha are found, the Earth Company, which is very likely building their own FTL ships at Sol Station, will come. Abrezio does not reveal that he has potential jump point coordinates for the Earth-Alpha run. They were discovered by a retired scientist on Alpha after trawling through data collected from slower-than-light ships travelling this route. Abrezio keeps the coordinates a secret because he fears that once Earth arrives, they will upset the balance of power in the region by monopolizing trade between the stations. But when Cruz threatens to take over Alpha, he sends the coordinates to Earth via the light-speed Stream. He hopes that once Earth arrives, they will see how Alpha has deteriorated, will find that the very expensive Rights cannot jump, and will remove Cruz. However, things on Alpha worsen and Abrezio decides to speed up the delivery of the coordinates to Earth by sending an FTL ship, using the untested jump points. That will cut down the transmission time from six years via the Stream, to less than one. He pleads with Galways captain Niall Monahan to undertake the dangerous trip. Abrezio assures him that by holding onto the coordinates, he will be the only FTL ship able to return to Alpha, and will be in a position to negotiate a good deal with Earth. Monahan agrees to undertake the risky run, and under a cloud of secrecy, sets off for Earth. But Cruz has gotten wind of Abrezio's plan and, after hiding on Galway with a handful of his staff, seizes control of the bridge. Ross Monahan, a navigator trainee on Galway, manages to escape with a copy of the jump points, and explains to Neihart and Abrezio that Cruz does not have the coordinates and is dependent on Galways navigator to get the ship to Earth. It becomes clear that Cruz wants to be the one to arrive at Earth with the coordinates and take the credit. ==Reception== A reviewer of Alliance Rising in Publishers Weekly stated that the authors focus on the characters in the story and how they cope with challenges, rather than turning to \\"pyrotechnics\\". The reviewer said that the \\"economics and sociopolitics are as riveting as space battles\\", and called the book a \\"welcome addition to the Alliance‚ÄìUnion saga\\". Writing in a review in Locus magazine, Liz Bourke described the book as \\"a measured, compelling work\\" with characters that are \\"well-drawn, and finely sketched, with believable motivations.\\" She was, however, critical of the viewpoint characters, saying that very few of them are women. She also felt that the way the characters behaved \\"seem[ed] reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s\\", and that there was not enough cultural diversity. But overall, Bourke found the book \\"intriguing\\" and \\"compelling\\" enough to want to pursue other books in this universe. In another review in Locus, Russell Letson said Alliance Rising is variation of the well-used theme of \\"colonists and settlers\\" seeking independence from \\"a distant, out-of-touch old order\\". But instead of a tale about \\"abstract political freedom\\", here it is \\"a detailed, textured, and tactile treatment of the material and cultural forces that underlie such struggles\\". Letson remarked that the book is not very \\"plotty\\". Much of the early chapters are devoted to providing a necessary backstory and context for the events that follow, and the rest are largely about the characters and how they interact with each other, express their hopes and fears, and speculate their possible futures. But Letson added that \\"there is a plot\\", a plot of the \\"sneaky sort\\" ‚Äì the book closes with \\"all speculation and hesitation [collapsing] into a storm of overt action\\". ==References== ==External links== * *Alliance Rising at Fantastic Fiction *Alliance Rising at DAW Books Category:2019 American novels Category:2019 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Science fiction novels by C.

It is part of the Archdeaconry of North West Europe in the Diocese in Europe of the Church of England. ==History== Interior, looking east In 1635 an English congregation shared St Peter's Church in the Hoogstraat of Rotterdam with French protestants but the Anglo-Dutch Wars dispersed the resident English community. In 1699, 17 families of English merchants in the city agreed to guarantee the stipend for a priest. Services began in a converted warehouse, but enough was raised through donations to construct a purpose-built building, the English Church of St Mary's in Rotterdam, consecrated in 1708. The many donors included Queen Anne, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Duke of Marlborough and the diarist Samuel Pepys; the chaplain's stipend was paid by the British government. The Church and its congregation flourished until most of the English population returned to England during the French Revolutionary Wars. The building was in a poor state when the congregation returned in 1815 after the French and later the Russian occupiers had used the church as prison, arsenal and granary. The tower was struck by lightning in 1864 and had to be removed and repairs were necessary because the Church was starting to subside. In 1878 St Mary's came under the patronage of the Colonial and Continental Church Society, now the Intercontinental Church Society (ICS), who still own the building and appoint the chaplain. At the end of the 19th century the Port of Rotterdam was flourishing. To meet the need for more pastoral care and support for sailors, St Mary's Church, together with the Scots Church, opened a seamen's centre. In 1893 the Missions to Seamen were invited to work in conjunction with St Mary's. In the early 20th century, the building on the Haringvliet was considered beyond repair and St Mary's Church and the Missions to Seamen were given permission to build a new church and seamen's club in Delfshaven, adjacent to the riverfront. The Rotterdam architect Jan Verheul designed the building in a neo-Gothic style and on 2 June 1913, Herbert Bury, Bishop of Northern and Central Europe, laid the foundation stone. When the Rotterdam church was demolished, English author and academic A. C. Benson bought the interior woodwork. He presented the pulpit from St Mary's to Lincoln Cathedral in memory of his father, Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury 1882‚Äì1896. The altar rails are in St Giles' Church, Cambridge and panelling was given to Magdalene College, Cambridge and Selwyn College, Cambridge. The organ of 1773 was purchased by Henry Elford Luxmoore and given to Eton College. The pulpit from the former St Mary's, now in Lincoln Cathedral Rotterdam Mission to Seamen After the completion of the church, in 1914-1915 an institute of the Missions to Seamen was built, also designed by Verheul. The two buildings are on the municipal monument list of Rotterdam. During the First World War, the church was used for the internment of prisoners of war. The chaplain, Rev Henry Haworth Coryton, ministered to the PoWs in Groningen and, as a thank-offering, Leonard A. Powell painted the three-panelled reredos. A Harrison & Harrison organ was added in 1920. In 1958, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip together with Queen Juliana, Prince Bernhard and the Princesses Beatrix and Irene made a visit on the 250th anniversary of the Church. Queen Beatrix visited St Mary's in April 2008 for the 300th anniversary. St Mary's Anglican and Episcopal Church continues to serve the English-speaking community in the Rijnmond conurbation. ==See also== *Pilgrim Fathers Church, Rotterdam *Scots International Church, Rotterdam ==References== ==External links== *St Mary's website Category:Anglican church buildings in Europe Category:Anglicanism in the Netherlands Category:Churches in Rotterdam Mary ","title":"St Mary's Church, Rotterdam"},{"id":"60409913","text":"Erna Denera (4 September 1881 ‚Äì 16 March 1938) was a German operatic soprano and voice teacher.

It was Irrfan Khan's last film, prior to his death in April 2020. ==Plot== Champak Bansal is a widower and a sweet-shop owner in Udaipur, Rajasthan. He often fights with his half-brother Gopi, who runs a competing sweet-shop, but they're greatly fond of each other. Champak's daughter Tarika has always harboured a dream to travel and study abroad. Though she is poor in studies, Champak is strongly supportive of her dream, and, with some effort, she secures a high rank in her final school examinations, enough for her to secure a scholarship from London's Truford University, which has partnered with her school. On the school's Annual Day, Champak notices that the chief guest is Judge Chheda, who had accepted a watch as a bribe from Gopi a few days before so that he could win the rights to the Ghasiteram name. He goes on stage and exposes the judge who had emphasised on honesty and values in his speech, not knowing that he is the principal's husband. The following morning, he meets the principal at her home and asks for forgiveness, only for her to tear Tarika's scholarship letter to pieces and throw it on his face. He vows to send Tarika to London, come what may. With the help of a London-based acquaintance, Bablu, Champak and Tarika along with Gopi proceed to London so that Tarika can find accommodation there till college opens. However, Champak and Gopi are caught and interrogated by the airport police. When they inadvertently say that they have 'drugs', they are deported and their passports blacklisted. Tarika, who had been calling Champak, Gopi and Bablu to no avail, goes to a rented home, and starts enjoying the free-spirited London life while also trying to fund her education. Meanwhile, Champak and Gopi are referred to a fixer in Dubai, Tony, who gives them Pakistani aliases and forged passports. They return to London, under the names of Abdul Razzaq and Saqlain Mushtaq, and are briefly accosted by Naina, a cop. They find lodging in a house owned by Mrs. Kohli, who is Naina's estranged mother. When they meet Tarika, Champak is aghast at her lifestyle, and demands that she leave her lodgings or he will sever ties with her. Gopi asks him why he says so, to which he replies that this is in order to avoid getting caught by Naina. The two visit a police station, where Bablu is lodged; they pay for his bail, and he tells them that he is now penniless. One night, Mrs. Kohli has invited the Bansals for dinner on the eve of her birthday, when Naina suddenly barges in and says that since her mother has not cared for her, she can do whatever she pleases. The next day, Champak and Gopi find the senior Kohli unconscious on the floor, and rush her to the hospital, narrowly saving her life. When Naina arrives on the scene, she breaks down and realises the value of caring for her. Champak, Gopi and Bablu hear of a fundraiser organised by Truford University and reluctantly agree to bid for its renovation, which costs 300,000 pounds. At their wits' end for arranging for such a large sum, they agree to sell the Ghasiteram family name. When Champak tells Tarika the news, she is nonplussed. The next day, as the three go to a scrapyard to collect the money, Champak pours his entire story to Tarika, who is convinced that she should not have put him and Gopi through so much trouble to fulfil her dream. Tarika later decides to give up her London scholarship and study back home in Udaipur, to which everyone agrees. The film ends with Champak and Gopi making peace over the Ghasiteram name. == Cast == * Irrfan Khan as Champak Bansal, Tarika's father * Radhika Madan as Tarika Bansal **Myrah Dandekar as young Tarika Bansal * Deepak Dobriyal as Gopi Bansal * Kareena Kapoor Khan as Officer Naina Kohli * Dimple Kapadia as Mrs. Sampada Kohli, Naina's mother * Ranvir Shorey as Balashankar Tripathi / Bablu * Pankaj Tripathi as Tony * Kiku Sharda as Gajju * Manu Rishi as Bheluram Bansal * Zakir Hussain as Judge Chedda * Meghna Malik as Principal Chedda * Poorvi Jain as Rashi Bansal * Manish Gandhi as Advait * Tillotama Shome as Consultant * Vipul Tank as Lagnesh * Ankit Bisht as Anmol ;Special Appearance in the promotional song \\"Kudi Nu Nachne De\\" * Anushka Sharma * Katrina Kaif * Alia Bhatt * Janhvi Kapoor * Ananya Panday * Kriti Sanon * Kiara Advani == Production == In June 2017 in an interview after the success of his film Hindi Medium producer Dinesh Vijan told Mid Day, \\"There is definitely scope for a sequel.

He is the author of four books on yoga. ==Life== Srivatsa Ramaswami was born in Madras (now Chennai) in 1939 into a religious family that practised ritual and chanting, following the Vedanta philosophy. He was schooled at the Ramakrishna Mission. His father was a personal friend of Krishnamacharya, \\"the father of modern yoga\\". He studied yoga in Madras under Krishnamacharya for 33 years from 1955. In India he taught for over 20 years at the Kalakshetra Foundation and other places, becoming well-known on Indian radio and television. He has run workshops in America at the Esalen Institute, the Himalayan Institute and many other centres. He lives and teaches in America. In Britain, he has taught programs on topics such as Vinyasa Krama Yoga, the yoga of Krishnamacharya, Pranayama Mantra and Meditation, Surya Namaskar (salute to the sun); and on Hindu scriptures including the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and the Bhagavad Gita. He is a registered yoga teacher with the Yoga Alliance. He is married to the gynaecologist Dr. Uma Ramaswami. ==Opinion of Krishnamacharya's methods== The yoga scholar Mark Singleton notes that Ramaswami asked Krishnamacharya where he could obtain the supposedly ancient text Yoga Rahasya that Krishnamacharya constantly cited in his teaching, alongside other supposedly lost texts like the Yoga Kurunta. Krishnamacharya reportedly told Ramaswami \\"with a chuckle\\" to go and look in the Tanjore library, which stated that the text did not exist. Ramaswami concluded from this, and from the continual changes in the supposed text, that it was Krishnamacharya's invention. Singleton notes also that Krishnamacharya told Ramaswami that the \\"dynamic sequencing\\" (vriddhi or shrushtimkri) of yoga postures (asanas) was \\"the method of practice for youngsters\\", especially for groups, and suggests that this may have been the origin of the vinyasa style of yoga taken up by another of Krishnamacharya's pupils, Pattabhi Jois. ==Reception== Reviewing Yoga for the Three Stages of Life (2001), Yoga Chicago comment that few of Krishnamacharya's thousands of students were as \\"diligent\\" as Ramaswami, staying for 33 years. The first chapter gives a \\"fascinating\\" account of Krishnamacharya's teaching style. The rest of the first part of the book summarizes yoga theory, while the remainder of the book looks at the practice of yoga, including asanas, pranayama, bandhas, detachment, renunciation, and mental transformation. The review concludes that while the book could help a beginner with a bad back, it was mainly for \\"the serious student\\" wanting an account of \\"the whole yoga story\\". Reviewing The Complete Book of Vinyasa Yoga (2005), Publishers Weekly notes that Ramaswami calls much Western yoga \\"blatantly aggressive\\" and lacking coverage of key aspects including pranayama, chanting, meditation, and yoga philosophy. The review notes that many of the 900 asanas and variations are highly advanced, though the sequences include some for beginners and intermediates. The review finds Ramaswami's approach \\"somewhat didactic\\", and the format like a reference manual, requiring the context provided by his earlier Yoga for the Three Stages of Life. Sarah Mata-Gabor, reviewing Yoga Beneath the Surface (2006) for International Journal of Yoga Therapy, writes that it \\"illuminates the virtue of inquiry in the pursuit of a comprehensive understanding of yoga.\\" In her view, Ramaswami \\"answers Hurwitz's questions with knowledge, experience, and generosity, providing a sturdy foundation for a modern Western student of Yoga.\\" She finds his answers \\"non-dogmatic but authoritative\\", providing insights into Krishnamacharya's teaching with \\"an exceptional balance of objectivity and subjectivity\\". Sharon Steffensen, reviewing the book for Yoga Chicago, comments that it reads \\"like a private conversation between a disciple and a guru\\". She finds Ramaswami's knowledge \\"vast and deep\\"; his answers to Hurwitz's questions increased her understanding of yoga, but also made her feel \\"uplifted, hope-filled and inspired.\\" Joelle Hann, reviewing the book for Timeout New York, writes that Ramaswami \\"illuminates issues as varied as the nature of the self, the hidden benefits of poses and whether to jump back to Chaturanga Dandasana on an inhale, exhale or no breath at all.\\" She calls the format \\"skimmable\\", but that to understand it fully, the reader might need other books, such as Ramaswami's Complete Book of Vinyasa Yoga, and warns that the book demands some effort from readers new to Sanskrit and the Yoga Sutras. ==Works== * (1982) Basic Tenets of Patanjala Yoga, Cambridge Yoga Publications. * (2001) Yoga for the Three Stages of Life: Developing Your Practice As an Art Form, a Physical Therapy, and a Guiding Philosophy, Inner Traditions. * (2005) The Complete Book of Vinyasa Yoga: The Authoritative Presentation - Based on 30 Years of Direct Study Under the Legendary Yoga Teacher Krishnamacha, Da Capo. * (2006) Yoga Beneath the Surface: An American Student and His Indian Teacher Discuss Yoga Philosophy and Practice (with David Hurwitz), Da Capo. == References == Category:1939 births Category:Modern yoga pioneers Category:Living people ","title":"Srivatsa Ramaswami"},{"id":"60410044","text":"George Garland (1900-1978) was a photographer known for his images of rural crafts and craftsmen taken in rural West Sussex. He was born in Brighton and attended Midhurst Grammar School, working for a short time in a bank in Hampshire before returning to Petworth in about 1922 to become a photographer. At a time when demand for studio portraits was declining, he specialised in photographs of rustic characters, hunting scenes and farming landscapes for newspapers and periodicals, mostly taken around Petworth or Amberley. Apart from portraits of notable personalities such as the artist Ivon Hitchens, his practice included also reproductions of artwork.Ivon Hitchens (2007); by Peter Khoroche, Lund Humphries , frontispiece and pages 80, 81, 82 > \\"It was in his awareness of what was passing and what was transient that his > genius lay.

His manuscript ‚ÄòTales of Old Petworth‚Äô, recalling Petworth before photography, encouraged illustrator Jonathan Newdick and Peter Jerrome to create Window Press to publish it in 1976, two years before George Garland died. ==Postcards== Garland published few postcards, mainly of Petworth and Fittleworth, sometimes stamped on the back in blue ink \\"G.G. Garland, Petworth\\" or \\"George G. Garland, Photographer, Petworth\\". These mostly recorded local events like fairs and football matches. ==Garland archive== His photographs of rural crafts and craftsmen were reproduced as prints.

In 1826 William Cobbett commented on what he found during one of his Rural Rides in his Political Register: > These poor creatures at Frome have pawned all their things, or nearly all. > All their best clothes, their blankets and sheets, their looms; any little > piece of furniture that they had‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.all the tolerably good clothes their > children had‚Ä¶.though this is a sort of manufacture cannot come to a complete > end; still it has received a blow from which it cannot possibly recover. In this situation, any new employment prospect was welcomed. On 10 November 1831, Mr Penny, a bookseller, stationer and circulating library owner, lit his shop in 3 Bath Street with gas for the first time, gas supplied by the upcoming enterprise of a Cockey. == Origins of the family == Lewis Cockey (1626-1711) was a brazier (a person who works in brass), bellfounder and clocksmith who worked in Warminster. His eldest son, William (1663‚Äì1748) became a clockmaker. By 1692 he moved to Wincanton, continuing making clocks (four of his lantern clocks are known today) and casting bells, as well repairing them. The youngest son, Edward (1669‚Äì1768) stayed with his father and became notable for his exceptionally complicated astronomical clocks, helped by local patronage, particularly for Lord Weymouth at Longleat. The second son, Lewis Cockey Junior (1666‚Äì1703) was a pewterer and bellfounder who moved to work in Frome in 1682 and was buried in the local church there in 1703. Lewes lived at 45 Milk Street, known as ‚ÄòThe Bell House‚Äô, probably using the space at the side, now its garage, for his bell casting. A foundry was soon established in the appropriately named Bell Lane, since demolished, a short distance from the Bell House. His son, William continued the family tradition until his death in 1762. At least 23 towers in Somerset and over 40 in Wiltshire and Dorset have Cockey inscriptions on their bells. Their standard inscriptions were ‚ÄòWilliam Cockey‚Äô plus the year, and little else. The fine ring at St John the Baptist, Frome contains such bells ‚Äì the two trebles dated 1724, and the 6th dated 1746. However, one of the bells in the Chapel of St Lawrence, Warminster has a more unusual inscription amongst other bells in the church, including those cast either by his father or grandfather. > God made Cockey and Cockey made me > 1743 After 1752 it seems the bells were cast elsewhere, placing the orders and collecting the accounts being undertaken in Frome. Christopher Cockey (1748‚Äì1792) had 7 children, among them Edward. == 19th century expansion == Edward Cockey established his own firm in 1816. He is listed as a brazier and iron founder in the Market Place in 1812 through to 1820 and then a brazier, tin man and ironmonger working in Bath Street in 1821. The family diversified, Edward becoming a successful iron-founder, and began casting for the gas industry as well as building his own gas works at Welshmill, managed by his son, Henry. Frome had gas street lighting as early as 1831. Over the years he held almost the whole of the trade of the West Country in the production of gas plant and carried out many contracts in Russia and elsewhere for gasholders and the like. in 1834 Edward and his son Henry were appointed as weights and measures inspectors for the Frome district of Somerset. The firm‚Äôs name has been seen on large cast iron weights. In 1844 Lawrence Hagley, a relative of Edward Cockey‚Äôs wife, was appointed the inspector in Frome. It was said that on Edward Cockey's daily inspection of the works if he met any item which displeased him, the person responsible, whether one of his sons, a foreman or workman, was liable to receive a heavy blow across the shoulders from a stick he always carried. Imperfect products were similarly battered. Edward was a stalwart of his community, which in part meant he took a lead in religious matters. His eldest son, also an Edward (1809‚Äì1880), had taken vows with the Anglican Church and became Warden of Wadham College, Oxford. In his study there, the first meetings of opponents to the Anglo-Catholic Tractarian movement were held. In 1851 a new vicar arrived in Frome, Father Early Bennett. He \\"was one of the first Ritualists, and a most aggressive one; the church at that time, as with most others, was very Evangelical....Father Bennett made no bones about it, preached a violent Anglo-Catholic sermon,....proposed immediately to introduce vestments, incense, confession.....practically the whole congregation left, some, it is stated, walking out during the sermon. The Cockeys.....and other influential members immediately joined the then new Church of Holy Trinity and carried on the Evangelical tradition, becoming churchwardens there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\\" Cockey's former Palmer Street factory: note crane at lefthand of building & window-gatesBy 1851 the company was employing 76 men and boys in the Palmer Street foundry, behind 10‚Äì15 Bath Street, as Edward Cockey & Sons. The company extended its work into iron foundry of all kinds: fences, gates, stairs, balustrades, boilers, valves, steam engines, roofs, gasometers. The firm made mileposts for the Salisbury to Shaftesbury road. As a growing company it supported the Gas Institute's contribution to the Great Exhibition of 1851. The gas works at Welshmill were serviced after 1854 by a railway siding for coal delivery, installed on the North Somerset Railway. They took out patents for some of their products: a cheese press (1853) and fluid regulators for gas production (1857), which were still in use well into the 20th century.Frome Museum, reprint from The Somerset Standard, January 23 1953, L464 After his death in 1860, two of his sons, Henry and Christopher Francis continued the management of the family business. In 1861 it was exhibiting agricultural equipment at the Royal Agricultural Exhibition in Leeds. In 1865, the firm was empowered to manufacture coke for sale. Gas pipe installation in Frome was not without its dangers. On the evening of 14 May 1871 a tremendous explosion took place next to the Ship at 6 Christchurch Street West: a 20 yard stretch of paving stones were torn up, a water closet exploded and two boys walking past were thrown into the air. Others nearby were knocked to the ground, but no one was seriously injured. It seems a newly installed gas pipe had leaked into the town drains. In 1874 a newspaper report recorded:Victorian gallery in the Dorset County Museum, ironwork by Cockey > The construction of a large gasholder for the Portsea Gas Co. The monster > will be 162 feet in diameter & when fully extended, 54¬Ω feet in height. It > will hold about 1,100,000 cubic feet of gas, or about 14 times the contents > of the biggest gasholder of the Frome Gas Co. The weight will be more than > 300 tons & this great weight will float up & down in a tank of water on a > bed of gas‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..the rivets used in putting the parts together will exceed 14 > tons in weight. The whole weight of iron will be between 700 & 800 tons. In 1883 it produced the ornate castings for the structure of the Victorian Gallery of Dorset County Museum. One unusual requirement in 1886 was to lay pipes in the town to supply a gas balloon for George Sanger‚Äôs circus.Frome Museum, reprint from The Somerset Standard, January 23 1953, L464 In 1886 the family firm became a limited company, Edward Cockey & Sons Ltd., Henry remaining as managing director till his death in 1891, severing the last family connection.Somerset & Wilts Journal, obituary 1891 The original foundry, with its warehouse frontage of lifting crane and window-gates overlooking Palmer Street, had a space behind that was too small for their expanding business. In 1893 the work moved to Garston, east of the town centre, on to a new open site. The 1904 25\\" OS maps shows an Iron Works immediately south of the east-west Frome-Radstock line (the North Somerset Railway), at the western end of the railway triangle, and immediately north of Garston Lane/Garston Street. A siding off the line into the works was constructed. The buildings were mainly concentrated towards the boundaries, leaving plenty of open space to pre-assemble gasometers, before dismantling them for delivery by rail.Cockey lamps in Frome: detail near St John's Church; St Catherine's Hill == 20th century == From 1903, the 200 gas lamp standards erected by Cockey in Frome were converted to electricity, after a generating station was built and cables laid. They were then fitted with a replacement art nouveau leaf pattern lampholder. Over 60 survive today, not all with the leaves, some with obtrusive modern lights, a number in poor condition of paintwork. Over 20 are listed Grade II by Historic England and attributed to Singer; a specimen entry illustrating the attribution is the one for the lamp post in front of No 9 Whittox Lane, near the centre of the town. Not all of the standards are Cockey originals. The town refers to them as 'Cockey Lamps' but records of Frome Urban District Council meetings suggest the art nouveau lamp heads were designed by Singer. By 1914 the limited company, with offices in London, were employing 250 people on the Garston site and elsewhere, working as gas engineers and contractors and making steel work. The foundry was used to pour metal into casts, making gas-holders, regulating valves and tar extractors, lamp standards and oil storage tanks.

Due to the scandal, PDVAL started being administrated by the Vicepresidency of Venezuela and afterwards by the Alimentation Ministry. Three former managers were detained, but were released afterwards and two of them had their positions restored. In July 2010, official estimates stated that 130,000 tons of food supplies were affected, while the political opposition informed of 170,000 tons. As of 2012, any advances in the investigations by the National Assembly were unknown. The most accepted explanation of the loss of food supplies is the organization of PDVAL, because the food network allegedly imported supplies faster than what it could distribute them. The opposition considers the affair as a corrupt case and spokespeople have assured that the public officials deliberately imported more food that could be distributed to embezzle funds through the import of subsidized supplies. == See also == *Local Committees for Supply and Production (CLAP) == Notes == == References == Category:2010 in Venezuela Category:Bolivarian Revolution Category:Corruption in Venezuela Category:Food and drink in Venezuela Category:Political scandals in Venezuela ","title":"PDVAL affair"},{"id":"60410176","text":"Life in Your Hands () is a 1958 Soviet drama film directed by Nikolai Rozantsev.–ö–∞–∫ –≤ –ó–∞–ø–æ—Ä–æ–∂—å–µ —Å–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª–∏ —á—Ä–µ–∑–≤—ã—á–∞–π–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –≤... –ö—É—Ä—Å–∫–µ–ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è –ö–ª–∞—Ä—ã –õ—É—á–∫–æ–£–º–µ—Ä –õ–µ–æ–Ω–∏–¥ –ê–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á–ö–ª–∞—Ä–∞ –°—Ç–µ–ø–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –õ—É—á–∫–æ. –ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∞ == Plot == The film is based on the real exploits of the sappers who were able to demine the ammunition depot in Kursk...–í —Ç–≤–æ–∏—Ö —Ä—É–∫–∞—Ö –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å == Cast == * Oleg Strizhenov * Iosif Kutyansky * Viktor Chekmaryov * Anatoli Yushko * Klara Luchko * Marina Strizhenova * Ye.

This theory states that the thinking, preferences and behavior of men and women follow the fundamental economic principles. It was proposed by psychologists Roy Baumeister and Kathleen Vohs. == Definitions == Sexual Economics defines sex as a marketplace deal. In this theory, sex is the thing that women have, and men want. Therefore, sex is considered as a resource that women hold overall. Women hold on to their bodies until they receive enough motivation to give it up, such as love, commitment, time, attention, caring, loyalty, respect, happiness and money from another party. On the other side, men are the ones who offer the resources that entice women into sex. Sexual Economics is based on social exchange theory: people are willing to give up something if they can get in exchange what they believe will benefit them more. As an example, assume one party holds a burger, and a hungry man wants the burger more than the money in his pocket. In this situation, the party who holds the burger has to want the money more than he wants the burger for the final exchange to take place. However, sometimes one party is more eager to exchange for what the other party holds, this causes a bargaining power imbalance. At this point, the party who is less willing to exchange what they have has a higher control in this relationship. In the example of a sexual relationship, if one side wants to have sexual intercourse less than the other, he or she can hold out until a more attractive offer is made. In the view of Mark Regnerus, the economic perspective is clear. The behavior he analyzed in the market place states that the majority rule is a political principle that often works in human society, but sex is an exception and minority rules work are applicable. == Female and male status == Sexual intercourse is often more attractive to men than to women. In primates, male aggression against females has the effect of controlling female sexuality for the male's reproductive advantage. Furthermore, the evolutionary perspective provides a hypothesis to help explain cross-culture variation in the frequency of male aggression against women. Variables include the protection of women by family or community, male alliances, and male strategies for protecting spouses and achieving adulterous mating and male resource control. According to sexual economics theory, males and females are different both physically and physiologically. Men give women resources, and then women will allow sex to take place. Under the context of sex, the trade of sex and resources keeps happening through eras and cultures, and society has acknowledged that female sexuality has more value than male sexuality. For instance, men and women have different feelings about their virginity. Women are more likely to think of their virginity as a precious gift and cherish it, while men see their virginity as a shameful condition and want to get rid of it early in life. It is also claimed that prostitution (the exchange of sex for money or equivalent items) may be a threat to women's status because sex is mostly considered as part of an intimate relationship instead of a contract. Moreover, that fact that sex is still used as a commodity can disenfranchise women and reinforce the patriarchy. == Society situations == === Domestic violence === Some examples could be used to prove that the theory of the sex economy valid. In a violent relationship, women are more likely to receive violence compared to men. In a research study, the results showed that jealousy is the most often used explanation for domestic violence for women, but for men two emotions lead to violence. The first one involves destructive thoughts (also refers to \\"critical inner voice\\") dominant like \\"She's trying to fool you\\" or \\"You are not man enough if you don't control her in mind and body.\\" The other element contains a detrimental illusion (also refers to \\"fantasy bond\\"), it brings a sense that another person constituted a whole with you, and it is essential for your happiness. Several advances in promoting equality between sexes have been made (such as abortion law modification in some areas), but most societies are still patriarchal societies. Men are thought of as stronger than women, especially physically. The expectation of being masculine and more powerful than women could be destructive for men by leading to violence. Therefore, a woman who has a violent partner would choose to offer sex to comfort and mostly distract them from abusing her. In this case, trading sex is considered as one useful way for women to escape emotional and physical abuse from men in a violent relationship. === Adultery === The punishment for adultery is different between different genders in some countries. In some cultures, adultery is considered a crime, and although punishments for adultery such as stoning are also applied to men, the vast majority of the victims are women. In some cultures, the wives' adultery can be a viable reason if the husband wants to divorce, however, husbands' adultery cannot justify divorce. This is the evidence for sex being considered a female resource. In this situation, sex is traded in exchange for getting married; therefore, if a wife has sex outside her husband, she's giving away what her husband sees as his. In the Philippines, the law differentiates based on gender. A woman can be charged as a criminal of adultery if she has had sexual intercourse with someone other than her husband. However, a man can only be charged with crimes such as concubinage, either keeping his mistress at home, or co-habitating with her, or having sexual relationships under scandalous circumstances. === Pornography === There is a big difference between men and women on the topic of their personal use and acceptance of pornography. It is shown in many research papers that men are more likely to view pornography compared to women, the most obvious evidence is that there are more male users on pornography websites than female users. Pornhub, as one of the biggest pornography websites in the world, reported of the year at the end of 2018. There were 29% female users in 2018, while 71% of Pornhub users were male, which means the number of male users was two times more than female users worldwide. Therefore, at least watching sex is more attractive to men than women based on the data derived. ==== Porn stars ==== Porn stars are people who perform sex acts in front of cameras for pornographic videos/movies. Female porn stars enter the industry for many different reasons, such as being repressed for a long time and wanting to abreact via this job. Receiving a satisfying pay after each movie ($390-$1950 for female actor) is also one of the attractive factors for entering the pornography industry. However, health care for porn stars is in a lack of security and in some porn women are degraded and used in some scenes. Women in porn can become dehumanized and treated as objects, abused, broken and discarded at the end. Therefore, even in commercial sexual culture, sexism and misogynist violence still exist in today's society. === Human trafficking === Human trafficking is a global issue and has consistently existed for centuries, nevertheless, it entered public consciousness around the beginning of the twenty-first century. Human trafficking is the process of enslaving people and exploiting them. Sex trafficking is one of the most common types of human trafficking. According to the data derived by The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime in 2016, 51% identified victims of human trafficking were women, children made up 28% and 21% were men. 72% of those who were exploited in the sex industry were women, while 63% of identified traffickers were men. Most victims are placed in abusive and coercive situations, but escaping is also difficult and life-threatening for them. global human trafficking from countries of origin and destination Countries of origin Yellow: Moderate number of persons Orange: High number of persons Red: Very high number of persons Countries of destination Light blue: High number of persons Blue: Very high number of persons According to The International Labor Organization, 4.5 million people are affected by sex trafficking in the world. Sex trafficking victims are often caught by various prosecuted criminal activities such as illegal prostitution. Besides the law, problems like long- lasting problems such as disease (AIDS), malnutrition, psychological trauma, addiction to drugs, and social ostracism against this group of people should be addressed as well. === Sex bribery in the work place === Sex bribery is defined as a \\"form of quid pro quo harassment in a sexual relationship with the declared or implicit condition for acquiring/retaining employment or its benefit\\" in an employment setting. A common example of sex bribery might come down to sexual activity or sexually related behavior accompanied by a reward such as a promotion opportunity or raise in payment. In a workplace, attempted coercion of sexual activity may under the threat of two major types of punishment: negative work performance feedback/evaluation and withheld chances of promotions and raises. According to the 2016 Personal Safety Survey, around 55% of women over 18 have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime, including receiving indecent phone calls, texts, emails; indecent exposure; inappropriate comments about the person's body and sex life; having unwanted touching, grabbing and kissing; and exposing and distributing the person's text, pictures, and sexual videos, without the person's permission. It is a serious, widespread problem, and the person who has a sexual harassment experience can feel stressed, anxious and depressed, sometimes withdrawing socially, becoming less productive, and losing confidence and self-esteem. == Social cases: sex as a female resource == There are several controversial cases in today's society that are relevant to sex economic theory. === Virginity Auction === A virginity auction is a controversial auction often published online. The person who tries to sell his/her virginity is often a young female, and the winning bidder will have the opportunity to be the first who have intercourse with the person. It is a controversial topic since many cases cannot be certified to be authentic. The person who auctions their virginity mostly do so for quick financial help. In this case, under the theory of sex economics, women are trying to use sex as a resource to trade financial help from men. === Sugar baby === Sugar baby is another controversial case that exists in today's society. A sugar baby and sugar daddy/mommy are in a beneficial relationship, which means sugar babies provide time and sexual services to please their partners, and sugar daddies/mommas give financial support back to sugar babies including helping them in student loans and also provide luxury lifestyles such as expensive items they couldn't afford on their own. According to the registered number on dating websites, sugar babies are mostly female and the number of sugar daddy is distinctly more than the number of sugar mommy. Therefore, it is another instance that corresponds to the theory of the sex economy. == References == Category: Human sexuality ","title":"Sexual economics"},{"id":"60410221","text":"Brusewitz is a German surname.

On 5 April 2018, Maduro imposed sanctions on Panamanian companies and as well as prominent Panamanian officials, including President Juan Carlos Varela in response to the sanctions imposed by Panama. The diplomatic crisis ended on 26 April 2018 when President Maduro announced that he had called President Varela and agreed to the return of the ambassadors and the return of air communication between both countries. == Background == Bilateral relations between the Panama and Venezuela have been suspended on two previous occasions under the Bolivarian government. In 2004, diplomatic relations were suspended by Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez (together with Cuba), when the Panamanian government refused to extradite a Cuban exile militant and CIA agent Luis Posada Carriles, claiming his life was in danger if extradited to those countries.Venezuela envoy to leave Panama, BBC News, August 28, 2004. In March 2014, Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro broke off diplomatic relations between the two countries, after President Ricardo Martinelli expressed support for the demonstrators during the 2014 Venezuelan protests. Relations were later restored in July 2014, after Vice President Jorge Arreaza attended the inauguration of President Juan Carlos Varela. == Start of the crisis == On March 29, 2018, the Ministry of Economy and Finance in Panama published a list of Venezuelan people, for their history of banking operations, were subject to investigations by cash or bank fraud laundering, so the list sought to warn both public and private institutions that limit their economic and financial operations with the listed group, considering them to be \\"high risk\\". The Panamanian government accuses these officials for alleged involvement with \\"money laundering, financing of terrorism and financing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\\" The list contained high-profile officials of the Bolivarian government including president Nicol√°s Maduro, 2017 Constituent National Assembly President Delcy Rodr√≠guez, Vice President of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) Diosdado Cabello, Head of Local Committees for Supply and Production (CLAP) Freddy Bernal, ANC member and brother of former President Hugo Ch√°vez Ad√°n Ch√°vez, Prisons Minister Iris Varela, President of the TSJ Maikel Moreno, Attorney General of Venezuela Tarek William Saab, President of the pro- government CNE Tibisay Lucena, Minister of Interior N√©stor Reverol and Head of SEBIN Gustavo Gonz√°lez L√≥pez. A group of Venezuelan opposition deputies, Freddy Superlano, Luis Florido and Ismael Garc√≠a traveled to Panama on April 3 to request the Panamanian Vice President and Foreign Minister, Isabel Saint Malo, the detailed list of the 55 Venezuelan officials. included in the list and the express reasons. In response, the foreign minister promised to provide all possible information in the way of cooperation between both countries, always respecting the applicable law. === Venezuelan government reaction === On 5 April 2018, the Venezuelan government imposed sanctions on 22 people and 46 Panamanian companies, among which were key officials of the government, including the President and Foreign Minister or Panama-based companies operating in Venezuela, such as Copa Airlines. === Panamanian government reaction === On 6 April 2018, the Panamanian government ordered to recall its ambassador to Venezuela, Miguel Octavio Mejia Miranda, in Caracas and urged the Venezuelan government to do the same with the Venezuelan ambassador, Jorge Luis Dur√°n Centeno, in Panama City. Copa Airlines was forced to suspend its operations from Caracas, Maracaibo and Valencia in response to the sanctions but resumed on 1 May 2018. According to President Varela, the sanctions imposed against Copa Airlines by the Maduro government will hurt Venezuelans since Panama is a logistic route for supplying medicine and food in response to the outgoing shortages. == Sanctions between both countries == === Sanctions on Panama by Venezuela === Venezuela imposed commercial sanctions by breaking commercial relations with Panama to 22 personalities and 46 Panamanian companies in response to the sanctions that Panama had imposed on Venezuela while reporting on the future publication of the list of Venezuelan personalities susceptible to money laundering. Venezuelan Vice President Tareck el Aissami announced that President Maduro has suspended commercial relations with several Panamanian companies, which will be added to the list of 46 announced originally on April 5.https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180411/442472041031/venezuela- suspende-relaciones-con-mas-empresas-de-panama-y-congela-cuentas.html The measure became effective on April 13, 2018, adding 50 more companies.https://m.prensa.com/economia/Venezuela-suspende-relaciones- empresas-Panama_0_5007249242.html === Sanctions on Venezuela by Panama === Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela indicated that his government would not recognize the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election results to persist the bilateral conflict. In addition, it is reported that his executive is preparing new sanctions in response to the \\"aggressive and disproportionate\\" measures that Venezuela done before the imposition of sanctions by Panama. The Government of Panama approved retaliation measures against the Venezuelan government, based on the Panamanian retaliation law and by virtue of the principle of reciprocity that governs international relations. The Cabinet Council ordered the suspension, for a period of ninety (90) days extendable, of all activities of air transport, passengers and cargo of Venezuelan airlines operating in Panama, the companies are as follows: *Aeropostal Alas De Venezuela, S.A. *Avior Airlines *Consorcio Venezolano De Industrias Aeron√°uticas y Servicios A√©reos, S.A. (Conviasa) *L√≠nea A√©rea De Servicio Ejecutivo, Regional (LASER) *Rutas A√©reas De Venezuela, S.A. (Ravsa) *Santa B√°rbara Airlines *Turpial Airlines, C.A.

Also at Diario Las Americas The Lima Group quickly positioned itself on the Panamanian side, condemned the Venezuelan sanctions imposed against Panama and assessed the possibilities of imposing additional international sanctions on the Maduro government, while at the same time recalling its non-recognition of the 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election and the repudiation of the upcoming presidential elections in Venezuela scheduled for May 20. The United States has welcomed the measures taken by Panama to expose and block Venezuelan money laundering and urged the international community \\"to follow Panama‚Äôs example and stand together against the Maduro regime‚Äôs corruption and illegitimate rule.‚Äù It also reiterated that Venezuela must restore democracy and end the repression and suffering of the Venezuelan people. == Mediation by Dominican Republic == At the request of President Maduro, the President of the Dominican Republic, Danilo Medina, was asked to act as mediator in a meeting in order to resolve the conflict with Panama. The meeting was held on April 11 in a secret manner by both sides, between Venezuelan Minister Wilmar Castro Soteldo and Panamanian Vice President Isabel Saint Malo, mediated by Dominican Foreign Minister Manuel Vargas. However, the talks collapsed on April 18, President Maduro himself revealed the existence of this meeting and blamed the head of the Panamanian delegation for \\"insults\\". Subsequently, the Panamanian government confirmed the meeting and argued that the commercial list published by Panama only formalizes lists published by the international community. == End of the crisis == On April 26, President Maduro announced that he made a phone call with President Varela and agreed to the return of the ambassadors of both countries, including the restitution of air communication between both countries, which was being affected from day. Likewise, an open diplomatic channel was left to discuss other pending issues, with a progress report that will be made in the next 30 days. The agreement was confirmed by the Panamanian Foreign Ministry. == See also == *International sanctions during the Venezuelan crisis *2019‚Äì20 Mexico‚ÄìBolivia diplomatic crisis == References == Category:2018 in Panama Category:2018 in Venezuela Category:Crisis in Venezuela Category:Foreign relations of Panama Category:Foreign relations of Venezuela ","title":"2018 Panama‚ÄìVenezuela diplomatic crisis"},{"id":"60410289","text":"Lucas L√≥pez may refer to: * Lucas L√≥pez (footballer, born 1994), Argentine defender * Lucas L√≥pez (footballer, born 1998), Argentine midfielder ","title":"Lucas L√≥pez"},{"id":"60410307","text":"Two Fyodors () is a 1958 Soviet drama film directed by Marlen Khutsiev.–í –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–ª–æ—Å—å –ø—Ä–æ—â–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Å –Æ–ª–∏–µ–π –ù–∞—á–∞–ª–æ–≤–æ–π–°–∫–æ–Ω—á–∞–ª—Å—è —Ä–µ–∂–∏—Å—Å—ë—Ä ¬´–í–µ—Å–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ –ó–∞—Ä–µ—á–Ω–æ–π —É–ª–∏—Ü–µ¬ª –ú–∞—Ä–ª–µ–Ω –•—É—Ü–∏–µ–≤–û–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ —Ä–∞—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–æ–≤ –û–¥–µ—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–∏–Ω–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª—è == Plot == After the end of the World War II, Fyodor returned to his homeland and met the homeless boy Fyodor the Small.

George Smart and Charles Neate were original members of the Philharmonic. Smart in 1814 gave the first performance in Britain of Beethoven's Christ on the Mount of Olives. Neate lived in Vienna from 1815 to 1816 and met Beethoven, who supervised his musical studies there. In subsequent years Neate corresponded with Beethoven, and publicized the composer's works at the Philharmonic. Ries, a pupil of Beethoven, lived in London from 1813 to 1824. He was introduced to the Philharmonic, and many of his compositions were performed at their concerts.Paul Nettl. \\"Ries\\" and \\"Neate, Charles\\" in Beethoven Encyclopedia. Philosophical Library, New York. 1956. Ries wrote to Beethoven on behalf of the Philharmonic in 1817, inviting him to London; the Society would pay him 300 guineas to stay for the season, and he would compose two symphonies for the Society. However, the visit did not take place. In 1822 Beethoven, considering a visit to London, wrote to Ries inquiring what remuneration the Society would give for a symphony; Ries forwarded the inquiry to the Society.The Philharmonic Society: The Ninth Symphony (1) Beethoven-Haus Bonn. Retrieved 4 April 2019. Later that year the Society decided to offer ¬£50 for a new symphony. The minutes stated: \\"10. November 1822. Resolved that an offer of ¬£50 be made to Beethoven for a M[anu].S[cript]. Sym[phony]. He having permission to dispose of it at the expiration of Eighteen Months after the receipt of it. It being a proviso that it shall arrive during the Month of March next.\\" Beethoven wrote to Ries several times during 1823, that completion of the new work was delayed. The manuscript was complete by April 1824; Neate confirmed receipt in December. Neate invited Beethoven to London for the 1825 season to conduct the symphony, offering 300 guineas for him to bring two new compositions; however, no visit took place. Meanwhile, the symphony had been performed in Vienna, on 7 May 1824.The Philharmonic Society: The Ninth Symphony (2) Beethoven-Haus Bonn. Retrieved 4 April 2019. ===Concert=== Sir George Smart, conductor of the symphony The first part of the concert on 21 March 1825 consisted of a symphony (\\"Sinfonia Letter T\\") by Joseph Haydn; the terzetto \\"Tutte le mie speranze\\" from Davide penitente by Mozart; an unspecified string quartet by Mozart; the song \\"Why does the God of Israel sleep\\" from Samson by Handel; a wind quintet by Anton Reicha; the aria \\"Per piet√†\\" from Cosi fan tutte by Mozart; and an overture Les deux journ√©es by Luigi Cherubini. The second part consisted of the new symphony by Beethoven. The programme described the work: \\"New Grand Characteristic Sinfonia, MS., with Vocal Finale, the principal parts of which to be sung by Madame Caradori, Miss Goodall, Mr Vaughan and Mr Phillips (composed expressly for this Society).\\" The leader of the orchestra was Franz Cramer, and the conductor was Sir George Smart. The text of \\"Ode to Joy\\" in the last movement was sung in Italian, the translation having been added in London. ===Reviews=== The reviewer in The Harmonicon wrote: \\"In the present symphony we discover no diminution of Beethoven's creative talent; it exhibits many perfectly new traits, and in its technical formation shews amazing ingenuity and unabated vigour of mind. But with all the merits that it unquestionably possesses, it is at least twice as long as it should be.... The last movement, a chorus... does not... mix up with the three first movements.... What relation it bears to the symphony we could not make out; and here, as well as in other parts, the want of intelligible design is too apparent.... [W]e must express our hope that this new work of the great Beethoven may be put into a more produceable form; that the repetitions may be omitted, and the chorus removed altogether....\\" The reviewer in The Quarterly Musical Magazine & Review wrote: \\"...[I]ts length alone will be a never-failing cause of complaint... as it takes up exactly one hour and twenty minutes... which is not compensated by any beauty of unity of design, taking the composition as a whole.... The fourth and last movement... is one of the most extraordinary instances I have ever witnessed, of great powers of mind and wonderful science, wasted upon subjects infinitely beneath its strength. But... parts of this movement... are really beautiful... ‚Äî but even here, while we are enjoying the delights of so much science and melody... we are snatched away from such eloquent music, to rude, wild and extraneous harmonies.... I must consider this new symphony as the least excellent of any Beethoven has produced, as an unequal work, abounding more in noise, eccentricity, and confusion of design, than in those grand and lofty touches he so well knows how to make us feel....\\" ==References== Category:British music history Category:Classical music concerts Category:Classical music in London Category:Events in London Category:1825 in England Category:Ludwig van Beethoven Category:Royal Philharmonic Society ","title":"British premi√®re of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9"},{"id":"60410415","text":"Padde Huli is a 2019 Indian Kannada language action drama film written by K.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. ==History== In 1835, Jonathan Hart and Joseph, Abraham, and Isaac Merritt purchased this site to establish a farm. In 1836 they platted what is now the heart of Battle Creek. As the settlement grew, Hart and the Merritts platted more of their property; in all of these plats, the lots fronting on Maple were unusually wide and deep. Beginning in the 1840s, Battle Creeks most distinguished residents built houses along Maple. These began with Jonathan Hart's own house, constructed in 1846, and Charles Merritt's, dating from the 1850s. By 1873, many of these lots had been filled. However, the area retained its cachet as a fashionable area to live, and over the next four decades many of these houses were expanded, substantially remodeled, or replaced, such that only three of the houses extant in 1873 are still in place in a recognizable form. Residents of the Maple Street Historic District included not only Merritt and Hart, but more of the Merritt family and other leading Battle Creek citizens of the late 19th and early 20th century. These include dry-goods merchant Benjamin F. Hinman, theatre owner Col. Walter Scott Butterfield, manufacturers Brainard Skinner, John Nichols, Irving L. Stone, and George Rich, as well as C. W. Post's daughter Marjorie Merriweather Post. ==Description== The Maple Street Historic District contains 46 residential buildings, of which 38 contribute to the historic character of the neighborhood. Of these, 24 are houses, twelve are associated garages or carriage houses, and two are churches. These houses are primarily substantial structures built on large city lots, and date from a late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Architectural styles are predominantly Italianate, Queen Anne, and Neoclassical, with a few Greek Revival, Colonial Revival, and Arts-and-Crafts inspired houses mixed in. Some of the houses have associated carriage houses or garages in the rear. The streets of the district are lined with old trees, primarily maple. ==References== ==Gallery== File:Kimball House.jpgKimball House (196 Capital) File:Seirn Cole House.jpgSeirn Cole House (145 Capital) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:Italianate architecture in Michigan Category:Queen Anne architecture in Michigan Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Michigan ","title":"Maple Street Historic District (Battle Creek, Michigan)"},{"id":"60410531","text":"Ghazi Abderrazzak (born 16 October 1986) is a Tunisian footballer for US Ben Guerdane on loan from Club Africain. ==References== ==External links== *Ghazi Abderrazzak at Footballdatabase Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Tunisian footballers Category:Tunisian expatriate footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:ES Hammam-Sousse players Category:Ohod Club players Category:√âtoile Sportive du Sahel players Category:Club Africain players Category:US Ben Guerdane players Category:Saudi Professional League players Category:Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 players Category:Expatriate footballers in Saudi Arabia Category:Tunisian expatriate sportspeople in Saudi Arabia ","title":"Ghazi Abderrazzak"},{"id":"60410554","text":"My Beloved () is a 1958 Soviet romance drama film directed by Iosif Kheifits.–î–µ–≤—è—Ç—å —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º–æ–≤ —Å –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–µ–º –ë–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≤—ã–º, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å–ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–µ–≥–æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞–ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π –∞—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–í—Å–µ–º–∏—Ä–Ω—ã–π –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π == Plot == The film tells about the doctor Vladimir Ustimenko, who loves his work with all his heart and Varya Stepnov, who as a child wanted to become a famous actress, but became a geologist.

Born in Brighouse, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Tattersall left school when he was nine, and found work in a silk mill. In 1880, he moved to Halifax to work at Clayton, Murgatroyd and Company, and began studying at night school. He joined a trade union of silk workers in 1884, and in 1889 was a founder of Halifax Trades Council. Tattersall was at first a supporter of the Liberal Party, serving on the Halifax Liberal Executive. He was a supporter of the Manningham Mills Strike, and this led him to promote the idea of Liberal- Labour candidates. However, the Liberal Party was not receptive to the idea of standing working men in elections. In 1891, Tattersall was a founder of both the Halifax Labour Electoral Association (LEA), and the Halifax Fabian Society. In January 1892 he stood in the Halifax School Board election as an LEA candidate, alongside Albert Thornton. The two topped the poll, winning seats on the board, and this inspired the LEA to found the new Halifax Labour Union, with Tattersall as its president. While he remained on the Liberal Executive until later in the year, he was now strongly opposed to the party, and at the 1892 UK general election, he chaired a meeting in support of Alfred Arnold, the Conservative candidate.Patricia A. Dawson, \\"The Halifax Independent Labour Movement: Labour and Liberalism 1890-1914\\". In: Keith Laybourn and David James (1991), The Rising Sun of Socialism, Hertford: Stephen Austin & Sons. pp.45-74 Tattersall was sacked from his job in July 1892, an action generally thought to be in retaliation for his labour activism. This led to large public meetings in his support, although Tattersall personally tried to play down the impact. In November 1892 he stood for Halifax Town Council as a Labour Union candidate in the Northowram ward, and was elected unopposed. The local Conservative and Liberal parties were alarmed by the success of the new group, and the Conservatives approached Tattersall to offer him a place as an alderman. He accepted this, to the dismay of much of the Labour Union. The Halifax Labour Union became part of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1893, but the small ILP group on Halifax Town Council struggled with disagreements over whether to reorganise the town clerk's office, and John Lister withdrew from the 1894 council election, due to conflicts with Tattersall. Tattersall was the only ILP member to win a seat, although he lost his School Board seat later in the year. The Clarion used this situation to attack the ILP's National Administrative Committee, on which Lister held a seat. Tattersall now reached the peak of his national prominence, winning election to the ILP's National Administrative Committee in 1894, and at the 1895 UK general election, he was the party's candidate for Preston. Unusually, in Preston, many trade unionists supported the Conservative Party, and Tattersall attempted to court their votes. He spoke against the disestablishment of the Church of England, and in favour compulsory rate contributions to church schools, and for compensation payments to any publicans who lost their licence. During the campaign, he wrote \\"An appeal to the working men of Halifax\\", calling for them to vote against the Liberal Party, and by implication, for the Conservative Party. He polled well, but did not win the seat. Back in Halifax, the Labour Union had become increasingly unhappy with Tattersall's close relationship with the Conservatives, and in November he was expelled from the Union, on a vote of 75 votes to 15. He found work as the full-time election agent for the local Conservative Party, remaining in the post into the 1900s. ==References== Category:1859 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Trade unionists from Yorkshire Category:Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members Category:Independent Labour Party councillors Category:Councillors in West Yorkshire Category:People from Brighouse ","title":"James Tattersall (politician)"},{"id":"60410760","text":"Basantia is a census town and gram panchayat in Deshapran CD block in Contai subdivision of Purba Medinipur district in the state of West Bengal, India. ==Geography== ===Location=== Basantia is located at . ===Urbanisation=== 93.55% of the population of Contai subdivision live in the rural areas.

Painting from 1772 depicting British and French sailors at battle with Dulcignottes (Ulcinj pirates). These pirates were defeated on 5 September, 1772. A period of Albanian piracy () occurred from the 15th to the 19th centuries, during which Albanian pirates plundered and raided ships. These pirates were based mainly in Ulcinj, but were also found in Bar and Ragusa, and had connections with North Africa. They plundered Venetian and Ottoman ships, disrupting the Mediterranean economy and forcing the Ottoman and European powers to intervene. Some of the pirate leaders from Ulcinj, such as Lika Ceni and Hadji Alia, were well known during this period. The Porte had such a problem with the Albanian pirates that they were given the \\"name-i h√ºmayun\\" (\\"imperial letters\\"), Maria Pia Pedani. The Ottoman- Venetian Border (15th-18th Centuries). p. 46 bilateral agreements to settle armed conflicts. The Ottoman Empire was also known to hire these pirates during periods of war. Some of the most famous barbary pirates of the Mediterranean Sea were the Ottoman Barbarossa brothers Oru√ß and Hayreddin (of Greek-Albanian origin) and Arnaut Mami (of Albanian origin). The pirates of Ulcinj, known in Italian as lupi di mare Dulcignotti (Alb. ujqit detar√´ Ulqinak√´, 'Ulcinian sea wolves'), were considered the most dangerous pirates in the Adriatic. They were not poor and violent criminals, but rather well- paid and established professionals; they were tactical merchants, traders, transporters, smugglers, diplomats and pirates whenever it suited them. They alternated between piracy and trading depending on season, enemies or local conflicts. Indeed, the captain of the Venetian galleys Alvise Foscari (1675‚Äì1751) wrote: == Origin == The first sign of piracy around the region of Ulcinj was documented during the Illyran period, with pirates raiding Roman ships. The Labeates-tribe was known to live off piracy. In 1405, Ulcinj was occupied by Venice and remained a pirate haven despite the Ottoman conquest in 1571. By the end of the 16th century, around 400 pirates from Malta, Tunisia, and Algeria were based in Ulcinj. The Albanian coast of Ulcinj, Durr√´s and Cape of Rodon was sailed by pirates since the year 1096. == Accounts of pirate activity == === 14th century === Between 1320-1347, Albanian privateers, among other pirates, attacked both Muslim and Christian vessels in the Ionian and Adriatic sea. === 15th century === Map of Vlor√´ in 1573 by Simon Pinargenti. The Dalmatian writer Coriolano Cippico published in 1442 a short story in Venice of the campaign of the Doge Pietro Moceniga describing the Dulcignotes: In 1479, Vlor√´ had become a pirate nest who raided both Venetian and when a peace agreement was signed between Venice and the Porte, Mehmed II ordered Gedik Ahmed Pasha to pay damages done by the pirates of Vlor√´. The locals did not obey. Maria Pia Pedani. The Ottoman-Venetian Border (15th-18th Centuries). page=44 In 1486, during the Venetian-Ottoman wars, Albanian pirates raided the lower Adriatic and Venice sent commander Dario to deal with them. Fernand Braudel notified in 1536 the Venetian senate that Albanian pirates were actively raiding ships between Corfu and Albania. In 1570, Albanian pirates were recorded to have inflicted heavy casualties on Venetian boats. In 1571, the pirates reached a climax with about 400 pirates from North Africa, Maltese, Serbian, Albanian Turks causing chaos in the region. There was also \\"The Pirate Dance\\" invented by Albanian pirates where after a successful attack, the pirates celebrate by roasting meat, eating halvah and dancing ritual dances. === 16th century === Map of Ulcinj in 1573 by Simon Pinargenti. During the 16th century, Ottomans attacked Ulcinj, the most notorious pirate haven of the Adriatic sea. There the Ottomans destroyed much of the pirate fleet. Nevertheless, the raids persisted. In October 1503, 6 ships sailing from Vlor√´ reached Santa Maria di Leucca cape, and captured 60 people and offered their liberation for a price of 30 dukats. The role of money in wartime.

In January 1537, the Venetian ambassador in Istanbul, Tomasso Mocenigo, according to a letter from Suleiman I to the sandjakbey of Elbasan, had complained that privateer ships had attacked the Venetian territories and taken slaves who were sold in Durr√´s. In 1554, 6 pirate vessels returned to Vlor√´ and were intercepted by a Venetian squadron who captured them, liberated their captives and then held the pirates under captivity.

The ship stopped at Durr√´s, where the pirates found protection under the Ottomans thus violating the agreement of 1540. Contarini ordered an attack and bombarded the harbor and the pirates had to surrender the goods and the ship, and when Contarini returned to Venice, he was removed from service and replaced. The sultan Q√¢n√ªn√Æ blamed the commander for having assaulted a merchant ship and Venice replied that they had negative experience with piracy and that Albanian merchants and pirates were not always discernible. The Sultan reacted rhetorically to Venice saying \\"I take care of my pirates, and you take care of yours\\" referring to Venice inability to deal with Maltese, Genoese and Cyprian pirates. In 1571, in preparation for the Battle of Lepanto, Kara Hace, an Albanian pirate lord, commander and aga from Vlor√´, gathered a fleet of ships. In 1573, after the peace between Venice and the Ottomans, Dubrovnik served as an intermediary for Albanian pirates and those wishing to liberate their captives who would be kept at the Ragusans houses until the money arrived. In May 1575, the pirates attacked a Spanish vessel, defeated the crew and towed the ship to the port of Ulcinj. The pirate leader Deli Topal Memi (Deli Topal Memi‚Äôye) was given the slave of Miguel Servantes. In 1580, the pirates seized 25 ships at the bay of Kotor and the locals of Dubrovnik sent for help at the local pashas. In 1581, Ulcinj pirate lord Cafer Reis (Xhafer Reis) gathered 18 ships and robbed ships in the southern and central Adriatic forcing locals in the coastal towns to enforce their defences. The Ulcinj pirates became known as \\"Pulya and Sicilian whip\\". The locals of Kotor were mobilised by the Venetians who handed out rifles and gun powder to oppose the pirates. In the spring of 1587, the pirates robbed a frigate from Dubrovnik carrying 3,000 ducats to Carcass to buy wheat. The captain was killed and the crew wounded and sold as slaves. Venetian studies at the time estimated that around 36% of all the cargo of the ships were damaged by the pirates. In 1586, Murad III ordered the sanjakbeg and the qadi of Vlor√´ to prevent the Albanian pirate Mehmed reis from shipping with his galliot to pillage Venetian lands. In 1590, a Venetian ship anchored in the Buna river, near Shkod√´r, to get water but were looted by the locals. In 1593, the Sultan ordered that ships built in Shkoder, fit for privateering, were to be prohibited and that pirate ships be burned. Maria Pia Pedani. The Ottoman-Venetian Border (15th-18th Centuries). page=44 In 1593, a conflict between Venice and Habsburg Spain emerged after the Venetian building of the fortress of Palma. For this reason, the Venetians were accused for getting too close to Habsburg territory with the rational of \\"to oppose the arms of the Turks\\". It also turned out that the Venetians targeted the region of Gradisca and were, according to Colemberg, financing Albanian pirates to raid Habsburg ships in the Gulf of Trieste. === 17th century === Map of Shkod√´r with the Buna river in 1571 by Giovanni Francesco Camocio. In 1602, the Venetian ambassador, Nicolo Molin, complained about the situation, describing the Albanian pirates as \\"unbearable.\\" In 1605, captain Bernardo Venier attempted to eliminate the pirates but failed. In the same year, the Sultan ordered that the pirates ƒ∞brahim aƒüa of Durr√´s, Mustafa aƒüa, Ahmed kahya, Bali, Mustafa, and Hasan kahya be arrested. Maria Pia Pedani.

Maria Pia Pedani. The Ottoman-Venetian Border (15th-18th Centuries). page=45 In 1612, Albanian pirates, hired by Ottomans, attacked Venetian ships as a retaliation for the Uskoks raid, according to the Sultan who wrote a letter to the beylerbey of Bosnia: \\"Uskoks raided the zone of Makarska (Macarsca) but some Albanian boats attacked them and freed the Turks they had made prisoners; thus, the inhabitants of Gabela and Makarska equipped some kayƒ±ks to protect themselves from the pirates\\". On May 8, 1607, 12 Uskok boats clashed in the Adriatic with Albanian-Muslim pirate ships and the Uskoks suffered a severe defeat. In 1615, Prince Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor of Styria hired Albanian Uskok pirates to harass Venetian ships which led to war with Venice. In 1617, Albanian pirate lords Avci Oglu, Kara Mustafa, Karaca Bali, and Aksak Hoca operated around Shkod√´r. By 1630, Albanian pirates became a severe problem again, forcing Venice to request assistance from the Ottoman Empire. In 1638, Venetian sources refer to the raids of the pirates of Ulcinj along the Dalmatian coast and in the Candian War (1648-1669). In 1653, Venetian war ships patrolled the ocean warning nearby ships of the pirates. In 1622, some pirates from Delvin√´ attacked ships in Venetian territory and 1623, Ulcinj pirates (√úlg√ºnlular korsanlarƒ±) attacked the subjects of Budva with vessels, which resulted in the Ottomans demanding that the stolen goods be returned and the pirates punished. In 1637, the cities of Modon, Coron and Navarino demanded that the Ulcinj pirates release two Venetian slaves who had been captured during peace time. √âCONOMES M√âDITERRAN√âENNES √âQUILIBRES ET INTERCOMMUNICATIONS XlIIe-XIXe si√®cles. 1983 Published by ACTES DU Ile.

In 1656, Ottoman pirates from Ulcinj and Santa Maura attacked and robbed Venetians ships into Trogir but were successfully chased away by the Venetian navy. In 1670, the Sultan ordered his commanders to stop the pirates from Ulcinj attacking Venetian ships. Antonio Baldacci wrote in the 17th century that there were at least 500 pirates around Ulcinj.Baldacci Antonio, L Albania, Roma 1929, str. 137. In 1672, Venice demanded that the sandjakbeys of Shkoder burn the armed ships of Ulcinj. In 1675, Krsto Zmajeviƒá (Cristoforo Zmajevich) from Perast was sent to eradicate the Ulcinj pirates for which he was rewarded with a golden necklace by the Venetian Senate. On March 31, 1685, the Republic of Ragusa requested from the Sulejman Pasha of Shkod√´r in a document stating that they wanted 19 captives back who had been taken by Ulcinj pirates. In July, the pirates had liberated 19 captives but instead captured another 16. In 1696, from August 9 to September 5, Venetian forces tried to invade Ulcinj which was defended by Ulcinj pirate lord Hajdar Karamindja (Hajdar Karamid≈æolu) who defended the city successfully. === 18th century === Map of Durr√´s in 1573 by Simon Pinargenti. Through out the 18th century, Venice complained that their economy was harmed because privateers of Ulcinj were smuggling and taking advantage of the fact that Venice demanded high taxes for the transportation of goods attracting merchants to Albania. At the end of the 18th century, after the withdrawal of the French government from Levant, Greek ships were given patents or passports, liberating them from cartaz, from the Grand Master of Malta and Greek notables. However these passports were resold to the pirates of Ulcinj who would use these passes at the corsair city of Tripoli. Privateers and governors of Ulcinj protected the pirates and Venice complained vehemently as their economy was severely damaged. On July 12, 1700, there was a complaint sent from Ponchartrain, the consul of the French consulate in Constantinople (1668-1708) to the Chamber of Commerce of Marseilles (Chambre de Commerce) after a certain Chateauneuf restituted a ship after it had been stolen by the Dulcignotes. Another letter was sent on August 4, 1700, complaining that the Chamber of Commerce had not yet repaid the consul in Constantinople after the French barque was taken by the Dulcignotes. A third letter was sent on August 24, 1700, once again demanding that the Chamber pay the sum for the barque of Dulcigno so that Constantinople could balance the accounts for the year. Eventually, the Chamber responded on June 13, 1701, that the receipt was acknowledged on March 2 and that the Chamber had begun working the case of Dulcigno as it now had turned into a dispute between France and Constantinople which resulted in the refusal of a payment. During the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1714‚Äì1718), trade relations were suspended and Ulcinj ships were ordered by Istanbul to stop Venetians from loading goods onto the Albanian coast and that all ships be suspended. This led the Ulcinj agas to kill the dizdar of Ulcinj who intended to implement the Sultans orders. As the piracy grew, the Sultan ordered Ibrahim Pasha of Bosnia to stop the pirates which was only possible after a joining of the Pasha of Shkoder. It is believed that Black slaves arrived in Ulcinj thanks to the Albanian pirates who traded with the Maghreb pirates. Mehmet Pasha of Shkoder burned down the ship of Ulcinj pirate captain Ajdar Piri in the city port in front to the inhabitants. Around 1713, Ottoman officials and Jean-Louis d'Usson (known as De Bonnac) exchanged letters on the \\"privateers of Ulcinj\\" where French ships had been plundered. This led to Ibrahim Pasha, governor of Alexandria, accompanying the Porte agent Osman Aga to Ulcinj. On April 13, 1715, the mayor of Rovinj was warned that the Dulcignotti (Ulcinj pirates) planned to sail the sea and use their convicts to run the Gulf. On August 18, several armed pirates boarded the port of Rovigno two miles outside of the city where they defeated the land forces and enslaved the locals, as well as stealing three trabaccolo ships. Many ships from the city fell into the hands of the Ulcinj pirates. On June 13, 1718, the pirates took a trabaccolo loaded with oil and almonds in the vicinity of Rovinj, and attacked a party of marciglianas with salt and wood as they were sailing through Venice. In 1715, Monsignor Matranga of Dionysius arrived in Rome and requested to be compensated for the expenses of his missionaries were raided by \\"Dolcignotti corsairs\\" and as a result the missionaries had to take refugee in Zara. In 1715, captain Giulio Ballovic met two Ulcinj pirate convicts at Safeno, Levant, and helped them escape and in a kidnapping which occurred in Novo Porto in Albania. Map of Dalmatia in 1715 by Guillaume Delisle. In December of 1707, corsairs from Ulcinj assaulted a French ship in the port of Gru≈æ's port and when Ragusans offered aid and managed to overpower the pirates, two Ragusans and a Frenchman were killed. In 1708, The General Provider of Dalmatia found that the strength of the pirates of Ulcinj had grown considerably. These pirates now fully controlled the trade routes of Draƒçe and Bojan. The pirates of Ulcinj were also quite active in Dalmatia, Istria, and Friuli.Isto, str. 126. During raids on merchant vessels, Albanian pirates habitually disguised themselves as pirates from the Maghreb. However, after the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, imperial orders were issued that targeted all groups of pirates. After the treaty, Venetian official Giacomo Diedo stated in a document of how Venetian ships faced difficulties in navigation after Spanish Habsburg repurchased territories lost in Utrecht thus forcing Venice to focus on the Adriatic. Here Venetian ships would continue to face threats from the Dulcignotti pirates, dressed as merchants and corsairs, who continued to raid ships on their way to Naples. The treaty had failed to protect Venetian commercial interests from constant raids and Ottomans failed to stop the piracy, sometimes even aiding them. Many ships were stopped by the maritime fleets for controls but sometimes it proved troublesome. In July 1735, the Spanish had stopped a turqoise \\"Veneto trabaccolo\\" and detained it, originating from Shkod√´r and carrying \\"many Turks and Christian subjects of the Porte\\". However it was a Dulcignotte ship which the Spanish had seized who then proceeded to take the slaves, according to the French consul in Ancona. The merchants of Shkod√´r complained to Venice. It turned out that the Spanish had confused the Shkod√´r ship with another as the former traveled with no Venetian sign of certificate for Pubblica Veneta Rappresentanza qualifying the Albanian merchants as subjects to Venice. In 1718, Jose Isnar, the French council in Durr√´s, wrote that the pirates terrorizing the Adriatic coast \\"respected neither Sultan nor any other authority.\\"The Pirates from Ulcinj, \\"‚ÄûThey keep terrorizing across the Adriatic‚Äú, wrote in 1718 the French consul in Durres Jose Isnar and he mentioned that the Ulcinj pirates did not respect the sultan nor any other authority in the world!\\" In the same year, an English merchant ship known as The Adventure, led by a commander Cleveland, met 12 ships from Dulcigno who went on board the English ship as friends. When they outnumbered the English, numbering 32, they were seized, had their hands tied and were then thrown over board. The pirates transported the ship to Durr√´s where they sold the goods. The English consul in the city immediately reported what he heard to the British ambassador in Istanbul who then ordered Ottoman captain Capighi Bassa (Pasha) to find and punish the pirates. In 1718, Venetian ships bombarded ships boarded by \\"Ulcinian corsairs\\" outside the coast of Durr√´s who had seized seven vessels, however, the attacks were too far away thus proving ineffective. In 1720, the merchant Ibrahim of Vlor√´ was killed on the Venetian ship of Puppa Rossa (eng. Red Stern) commanded by Ali Reis from Ulcinj, in the harbor of Venice. The victim had powerful relatives who wanted justice and the Ottomans demanded an investigation which showed that he had been killed by sailors from Ulcinj. On February 14, 1721, the captain of Piran had chased away a \\"tartan of Ulcinj\\" who was there to plunder. On February 28, the captain of Capodistria (Istria) give instructions to the representatives of Istria, so that they would be prepared if they met \\"dulcignote tartane\\" (Tartans of Ulcinj). On Januar 7, 1721, the Spanish agent Dom Felix Corv√®se arrived in Rome who together with the Cardinal of Altam was ordered to ask the Sacred College for money as the threat of the Ottomans was closing in. A Venetian ambassador in Ulcinj had discovered that at night, the Dulcignotes (Ulcinj pirates) were stealing muskets from the Spanish which they carried into their homes. The Inquisitors, after finding out, had the merchants arrested who eventually confessed that they had sold arms to the Ottomans. On September 15, 1721, The Weekly Journal : Or British Gazetteer published an article about an event which had occurred some time before in Venice. A crew of Dulcignote sailors were at the harbor and one of the pirates got in a fight with a butcher and the rest of the crew wielded arms and opened fire at bypassers killing five or six. The sailors were then killed by Venetian soldiers. The event was denied by the Grand Vizier and instead demanded compensation for the loss of his subjects. In 1826, the Austrian paper Geschichte der Republik Venedig published a volume mentioning an event which had occurred in 1722 during the war of Peter the Great against the Ottomans. A ship from Ulcinj flying the Turkish flag landed in the port of Venice. There was a dispute between the Slavonians and some of the crew. Several Dulcignottes were killed and the ship was set on fire. The Porte demanded compensation for the loss of their subjects, while the Venetians claimed that the death of the Dulcignottes was not a valid reason of compensation. The Porte stated that a foreign ship received in the port had to be under the rotection of the government of the country. After a long negotiation and threats from the Porte, Venice released 200 slaves and paid a sum of 12 000 pilasters. This led to the Venetian government fortifying the islands of Greek sea. In 1726 a Dulcignotte pirate and a Barbarian Tartan took refuge in the Maghreb, and the Sultan sent orders to Tripoli and Tunis to have the marcigliana they had stolen on returned. Again, in 1728-29 the inhabitants of Ulcinj were forbidden from helping the Barbary corsairs. A Venetian report from 1743 mentions a report from 1721 that a vessel of the Dulcignotes, alongside several Turks, have been seized and the ship burned by the order of the Senate, which resulted in the Sultan being offended considering the Peace of Passarowitz. The pirate problem had grown so large that in 1723 the Sultan forbade the inhabitants of Ulcinj from leaving their harbors and they were forced to use only their own ensigns. Maria Pia Pedani. The Ottoman-Venetian Border (15th-18th Centuries). page=46 An Italian study of the history of Rovinj from 2010 mentions the writings of a Paolo Paulovich who in turn mentioned the canon Constantini who in 1733 founded the \\"Confraternity for the liberation of slaves\\" with the goal of freeing the crews of Rovinj that \\"fell miserably into the hands of pirate ships of the Dulcignottes\\". In 1739, during The Treaty of Belgrade, the Ottomans were forced by Austria and Russia to stop the Dulcignotes (Ulcinj pirates), which led to a serious riot in Istanbul, in 1740. According to Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, most of the rebels were Albanian which resulted in them being sent home. In June 1742, Venice encouraged the Pa≈°troviƒái tribed led by Bo≈°ko Peraziƒá to attack and rob the pirates of Ulcinj. However Peraziƒá continued pirating resulting in the Providence Generale to arrest Peraziƒá in 1759. In September 1746, a certain Cristoforo Grillo was banished from Perast who irritated the Ottomans preying on their ships in Livorno. Eventually the pirates of Ulcinj captured him and hanged from a flagpole. The inhabitants of Perast, led by a Bujovich, avenged him by plundering a Dolcignatta tartana (Ulcinj ship) killing many Ottoman subjects. The Porte was much upset after the Dolcignotti complained and Venice promised to punish Bujovich. In order to please the Ottomans, the city of Perast had to pay a large sum. In 1748, a pirate captain named Hadji Mustafa from Ulcinj robbed a Venetian ship in the waters of Buna and took the captain along two other crew members. Banor√´t e zinj t√´ Ulqinit (Blacks of Ulcinj). (Translation) \\"Therefore, in cases like the one in 1748, when a pirate of Ulcinj origin, Haji Mustafa, violated the treaty and robbed a Venetian ship in the waters of Buna and took her captain along with two others from the crew, intervention had to be made.\\"11. \\". http://www.gsh.al/2019/11/11/banoret-e- zinj-te-ulqinit/ German author Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall writes in the Histoire de L'Empire Ottoman, published in 1840, of the \\"Barbaresques et les Dulcignotes\\" (Barbaresques and Ulcinj pirates) who inflect heavy damages on the Gulf of Naples in the year of 1750 costing over 1.000 000 piastres. Leaving Bologna in 1750, at the age of 25, a young Venetian traveler named Gian-Marco traveled to the Ottoman world. On his journey, he was serving a Venetian officer when he was captured by Montenegrin and then sold to the Ottomans. After a year, he fled and reached Shkod√´r where he set sail for Durr√´s where he was captured by the Dulcignotti pirates. From the 1750s, French and Neapolitan ships engaged in the Spanish war of succession and due to continuous raids from Ulcinj pirates, the locals of Ancona and Bar fled the cities. There were also Ulcinj pirates who sailed under French flags in order to pray on Ragusan ships. In 1755, Commander Angelo Emo was the ship governor protecting convoys from pirate attacks from the Dulcignotti. He continued doing so in 1770-71, where he participated in the naval campaign for the elimination of the Dulcignotti pirates from the islands of Zante, Corfu, Cerigo. On February 3, 1757, the Venetian ambassador wrote to the Senate describing an incident of piracy which had occurred in September 1756. A certain Paolo Caliga from Cephalonia had arrived in the port of Azder mentioning two armed Dulcignotti armed ships flying the flag of Tripoli. Before, he began speaking Venetian and managed to persuade the pirates to hand over the merchandise and arms which he placed in the house of the French consul. When the pirates, numbering 150 and led by Ulcinj pirate captains Hassan and Ibrahim, arrived in the harbor to make necessary provisions, they were suddenly approached by the poor peasants to which the pirates responded by raiding the Cephalonia vessel and the bay. The ambassador contacted the Porte and demanded that the Ulcinj inhabitants be suspended. The Porte sent the local reis from Shkod√´r who explained that it was impossible to gain compensation and that suspending Ulcinj from trade would result in innocent traders being punished for the crimes of a wicked few. On 17 December, 1757, the ambassador, again, wrote from Constantinople, Pera, mentioning a trabaccalo captain named Tiozzo who had been killed by Dulcignotti pirates in the waters of Puglia several months earlier. The ambassador also proposed to send an auctioneer to the Venetian Dalmatian general who would contact vice consul Anton Doda in Shkod√´r in order to settle complaints related to raids committed by Dulcignotte pirates. On Mars, 1759, the Ambassador wrote again to the Senate mentioning that on December 21, 1758, around 30 miles outside of Patras, opposite of Morea, Ulcinj pirate lord Sinan Komina was commanding a ship with eight roars on each side and new modern canons, on which 100 pirates served with 50 being from Ulcinj..Ibid In 1763, a large ‚ÄúDulcignotta‚Äù galley arrived at the port of Povijest at Drvenika. The inhabitants of Lugar tried to stop them but the Dulcignotte pirates beat them and proceeded to enter the village where a bloody fight ensued. One pirate was killed and others wounded on both sides. The authorities decided to ban the inhabitants from leaving the island of Vini≈°ƒáe. In 1765, the Dulcignottes decided to avenge themselves by banning ‚Äú23 schiavis‚Äù (slavs) on Drevnik and robbing the village. At the end of 1764, pirate captain, Sinan Komina, seized a ship from Livorno in Koron (Peloponnese) with a crew of 40 pirates. He then brought the seized ship to Bar. When Sultan Mehmed's men notified him the ship was missing, the Sultan ordered the arrest of Komina. Komina was forced to flee to Pa≈°tro, the home of his close allies, the Ka≈æanegra family. In spite of continued Ottoman opposition, the pirates of Ulcinj regrouped under Komina at the beginning of 1765.Slavko Miju≈°koviƒá, Turske mjere protiv ulcinjskih gusara, Godi≈°njak PMK, XII, Kotor, 1964, str.95. Led by Kara Mahmud Pasha, the Ottomans launched an attack on Montenegro in 1785, once again destroying the pirate fleet. This measure, although successful, did not prevent future sporadic raids. In January 1765, Albanian crews from Dulcino (Ulcinj) carried out frequent raid of all ships regardless of flag, taking advantage of the Russo-Turkish war. In 1767, Joseph de Cambis held a journal between April 1 and September 17, describing his service on the king ship The Chimera destined to meet C√©sar Gabriel de Choiseul in Naples and beyond with the intention of fighting in the coast of Morea against the \\"Dulcignottes and other privateers\\". The ship was placed under the command of M. Grasse-Brianson and left the harbour of Toulon on April 28, 1767 and returned August 31. On August 15, 1768, roughly 40 miles off the coast of Cape Passero in the south-east of Sicily, a Maltese ship spotted a pirate ship with two guns, four scuttles and 50 men led by captain Hossein Spahia Ra√Øs from Dulcigno, towing another ship from Lazio loaded with timber. The pirates released the ship and tried to escape but were eventually caught by the Maltese who threw overboard various equipments thus enabling speed. Fighting began where upon the Dulcignottes boarded the Maltese ship with the crew members opening fire with pistols and then using knives. The pirate captain was shot down with a blunderbuss and out of 28 Dulcignotte pirates and 8 Moors, 13 were killed, 12 wounded and 11 captured. The Maltese lost 5 men with 11 wounded with 2 being severe. The First Mate (second Ra√Øs) survived and was released and indeed, he continued as a captain of a new ship. On January 15, 1678, the Venetian head of administration of Dalmatia, Paolo Bold√π, wrote to captain Zuane Zusto of the feuds between the inhabitants of Dobrota and Dolcigno (Ulcinj) with the first village being under Venetian jurisdiction and the other under Ottoman. Antonio Orio, another Venetian official, had written to Venice of the useless attempts of stopping the feud calling the inhabitants \\"treacherous\\". Paolo Bold√π stated that the problems began when the two villages would not trade. In April 1770, the Albanian captains from Ulcinj destroyed the Russian navy commanded by Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov outside the coast of Navarino. In July, 1770, during the Battle of Chesma, part of the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774), Vice Admiral John Elphinstone of the Russian navy, engaged in a battle with the Ulcinjian pirates and privateers, hired by the Ottomans, who lost. In English newspapers at the time, the pirates were described as \\"the only people who had the courage or fidelity to put to sea with a fleet in search of the enemy\\". On August 2, 1770, Italian traveler Pietro Godenti reported in St. Petersburg that he had received a letter written from Trieste to Dmitri Alekseyevich Gallitzin that in Corfu and d'Ancona, the Ottoman fleet had been defeated by the Russian fleet led by Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov in the archipelago and that many \\"tartans of the Dolcignotti\\" had been sunk and dispelled. In 1771, Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov hired Albanian sailors to attack the Ottomans and allowing them to fly the Russian flag. However, 300 sailors soon deserted the Russian navy and joined the Albanian pirates, and Orlov was sent to stop them. Sometime in 1772, Albanian pirates seize two Russian ships and used them for piracy forcing Admiral Grigory Spiridov and Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov to warn the Ottomans as well as neutral ships in the Aegean sea. On December 9, 1772, Joseph-Dimitri Gaspary, French consul in Athens, sent a letter to the French minister mentioning that a fleet of 30 ships from Dulcign√© (Ulcinj) was destroyed by the Russians in the Gulf of Patras. Prior to this, four Dulcignote ships had enslaved 15 German and French soldiers from the island of Corfu and sold them to Salone. One of them, Joseph Vichel, from Alsace, escaped to the building of Captain Blanc of La Ciotat. On Mars 15, 1775, The Pennsylvania Gazette published an article from a letter in Istanbul dated on November 17, 1774, where the Russian navy had discharged Albanian sailors from service, which resulted in the seas being overtaken with pirates with two Albanian Ulcinj pirates being mentioned: Manoli and Doli Constantine, who had taken three French ships and massacred the crew. Another ship was wrecked outside of Caramania where only two crew members survived. In April 1775, Captain Ermanno Cinif Inglis set sail alongside Giovanni Patriarch, both under the Naples navy, from Trieste with knowledge of the armada of Tartane Dulcignotte numbering twice as big. Knowing this, the squad was split with two waiting in Ancona and Brindisi waiting for the Russian fleet to join them. In June, Ottoman corsairs alongside Dulcingotte pirates numbering 140 men attacked a Greek vessel in the port of Brindisi. The crew survived by covering under the cannons. According to an article by French journalist Louis-Fran√ßois Metra published in the German paper Correspondance litt√©raire secr√®te in Neuwied in 1781, originally published in Venice, six English officers were captured by Dulcignotes (Ulcinj pirates) who then proceeded to rob them, strip them naked and leave them on the shores of the Nile where a Ragusan captain helped them. The reason was that the English were planning a mission against the Dutch. In January 1781, French traveller and translator D√©rival de Gomicourt published in the Dutch correspondence \\"Lettres hollandoises, ou Correspondance politique, sur l'etat present de l'Europe, notamment de la r√©publique des sept Provinces-Unies‚Äù a letter from a London merchant destined for his correspondent in Ostend. The letter explains that the English government had sent six English officers to India to order Edward Hughes to launch an attack on British enemies. The same order was to be carried out in all the places where it was important that it be known. The English officers sailed along the coast of Egypt when a Dulcignote corsair captured them and stripped them of all they had. One of the officers wrote a letter at the end of the month from Venice to one of the parents in London and Gomicourt described it as \\"being sad\\". In 1783, Anne-Charles-Sigismond de Montmorency- Luxembourg (1737-1803), grand seigneur and franc-macon, proposed to recruit at his own expense a French legion of Dulcignotes and of Albanians of which one would form a large and respectable unit. In 1789, The Lady Magazine published an article from Trieste on June 4 describing a battle between \\"Dulcigno pirates\\", numbering 7 fleets, and the Russian fleet led by a major of Greek origin Lambros Katsonis outside the cost between Ulcinj and Kotor. The pirates lost 50 men and the Russians none. The Russians also freed a Venetian ship captured by Ulcinj pirates where 1000 Albanians then switched side. It is believed that the Ulcinj pirate lord Lika Ceni defeated and executed Lambros Katsonis in a duel, who himself had become a pirate before he joined Katsonis had joined the Orlov Revolt in 1770 In 1789, Gazetta universale published an article from June of a skirmish between Captain Constantine Livaditi, commander of a Russian fleet, against Dulcignotte trabaccolos, flying the Papacy flag, outside the port of Marina di Ragusa in modern day Italy. When they were spotted, the pirates left the trabaccolo and the captain opened fire resulting in five dead and one wounded. In the same time period, Major Lambros Katsonis reported while commanding the Russian fleet that seven Dulcignotti vessels were present in the Bay of Kotor. The Russian commander then proceeded to attack the pirates but to no avail. The Dulcignottes then placed themselves on the shores and prepared cannons from which they fired upon the Russians who themselves returned the fire with artillery sinking two Dulcignotti ships and resulting in 50 dead pirates.ibid. In 1798, the French traveler Fran√ßois Pouqueville boarded the Italian merchant ship La Madonna di Montenegro in Alexandria heading to Calabria when they were attacked by Uluc Alia and his pirates from Ulcinj. === 19th century === In 1813, the German painter and archaeologist, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, was sailing close to Salonica when his ships attacked by Albanian pirates. The artist was captured and held for a ransom of 60,000 piasters. In 1816, the British government was in a dispute with the Neapolitan ambassador in London regarding the failure of dealing with Albanian pirate. On August 14, 1817, journalists reported Albanian pirates raiding ships near Venice. James John Best wrote that an Albanian pirate attacked a British ship outside of Corfu in 1840. In 1818 more than 400 ships were counted among the Ulcinj navy.Hecquard H., Histoire et description de la Haute Albanie ou Guegarie, Paris 1858, str. 48. Parliamentary Papers wrote of an attack in 1837 where 100 Albanian pirates, part of a secret organization in European Turkey, attacked a village outside the coast of Otranto and massacred the villagers. The leader was a pirate named Rafil Bey. John Hobbhouse wrote in 1878 that the pirates of Dulcigno numbered some 6,000. The raids continued until the latter half of the 19th century and the piracy finally ended after the European powers united and forced the Ottomans to hunt them down. Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn noted in 1819 that Ali Pasha of Ioannina had some armed galliots manned by Dulcignotes. In 1863, Viscountess Emily Anne Beaufort Smythe wrote that the Dulcignote pirates used to the \\"terror of Italy\\" and that the sailors were requested by the Porte. ==Ottoman support for the pirates== The pirates played a role in the competition between the Ottoman Empire and its rivals, usually siding with the Ottomans. In 1687, when the Ottomans lost the city of Herceg-Novi, Venice attempted to fill the vacuum but was prevented from doing so by a population of 500 pirates from Malta, Tunis, and Algeria, many of whom were veterans of the Kandyan Wars of 1669. The Ottomans are reported to have provided support to the pirates as long as they focused their raids on Venetian ships. During this time period, the Ulcinj ship builders were the richest inhabitants of Northern Albania and they had a representative in Istanbul who would keep the pirates under control by bribing the Sultan. They were also supported from time to time by the Pasha of Shkod√´r who would warn them if England complained against the piracy. Evlia Celebi wrties that the Sanjak-bey of Scutari would receive one tenth of the booty of the Albanian pirates after they had looted and raided. ===Albanian Barbary corsairs=== ====Barbarossa brothers==== The most famous of the pirates in North Africa were the Ottoman brothers (of Greek-Albanian origin)Hayreddin Barbarossa, who would rise to become the ruler of Algiers, and later admiral of the Ottoman fleet, was of Greek origin and got his start raiding the southern and western shores of Anatolia on behalf of Korkud, son of Bayezid..., Virginia H. Aksan & Daniel Goffman, The early modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire, Cambridge University Press, 2007, , p. 106.Their father was former Muslim soldier, probably from a recent converted family of the European Provinces. Their mother is said to have been the widow of a Greek priest., Frank Ronald Charles Bagley et al, The Last Great Muslim Empires: History of the Muslim World, Brill Academic Publishers, 1997, p. 114. Oru√ß and Hƒ±zƒ±r Hayreddin. They, and two less well-known brothers all became Barbary corsairs in the service of the Ottoman Empire; they were called the Barbarossas (Italian for Redbeards) after the red beard of Oru√ß, the eldest. Oru√ß captured the island of Djerba for the Ottoman Empire in 1502 or 1503. He often attacked Spanish territories on the coast of North Africa; during one failed attempt in 1512 he lost his left arm to a cannonball. The eldest Barbarossa also went on a rampage through Algiers in 1516, and captured the town with the help of the Ottoman Empire. He executed the ruler of Algiers and everybody he suspected would oppose him, including local rulers. He was finally captured and killed by the Spanish in 1518, and put on display. Oru√ß's youngest brother Hƒ±zƒ±r (later called Hayreddin or Kheir ed-Din) was a capable engineer and spoke at least six languages. He dyed the hair of his head and beard with henna to redden it like Oru√ß's. After capturing many crucial coastal areas, Hayreddin was appointed admiral-in-chief of the Ottoman sultan's fleet. In 1537 Hayreddin captured the island of Aegina and populated it with Albanians. Under his command the Ottoman Empire was able to gain and keep control of the eastern Mediterranean for over thirty years. Barbaros Hƒ±zƒ±r Hayreddin Pasha died in 1546 of a fever, possibly the plague. ====Arnaut Mami==== The Prisoner by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, 1861. Arnaut Mami was an Ottoman (of Albanian origin) renegade, the squadron admiral and the supreme commander of all Islamic vessels in North Africa and Pasha Algiers. Leading a team of Ottoman vessels, on the morning of 26 September 1575 he attacked the Spanish galley \\"El Sol\\" in the Gulf of Lion, where Miguel de Cervantes was embarked from Naples. Despite an intrepid defense of the Spaniards, many of whom died in combat, the ship did not escape the corsairs and Cervantes was taken with other passengers to Algiers as captives. There, Cervantes became the slave of Arnaut Mami's second-in-command, Dali Mami. Cervantes was ransomed by his parents and the Trinitarians and returned to his family in Madrid after almost five years and four unsuccessful escape attempts. This period of his life influenced several of Cervante's literary works, notably the Captive's tale in Don Quixote and the two plays set in Algiers El trato de Argel (Life in Algiers) and Los ba√±os de Argel (The Dungeons of Algiers). ==Links to North Africa== Map of Tripoli in 1561. Following a siege in Tripoli, several hardened pirates fled to Albania and joined the ranks of the Albanian pirates. Ali Hoxha was noted for burning down the village of Mljet in 1725. Following this incident, he was expelled from Ulcinj and returned to Tripoli. In 1731 a new pasha defeated the pirates once again, and many fled to Tripoli.Vuk Vinaver, Dubrovnik i Turska u XVIII veku, Posebna izdanja CCCXXXI, Istorijski institut, knj. 11, Beograd, 1960, str. 31. ==Relations with local populations== Some pirate leaders maintained good relations with the local population. Hadji Alia earned the admiration of local peasants by generously sharing his booty, and became something of a legend after putting up fierce resistance to a powerful combined Venetian and British fleet, despite being significantly outmanned and outgunned. == Legacy == Today there are numerous memorials in Ulcinj of the pirate lords who lived in the city. Haxhi Ali's fame among the Albanians led to naming one of the most important caves of the Albanian coast with his name. == References == Category:Pirates by nationality Category:Ottoman Albania Category:History of the Adriatic Sea Category:Crime in Albania ","title":"Albanian piracy"},{"id":"60410779","text":"Notorious Gallagher is a 1916 American silent drama film directed by William Nigh and starring Nigh, Marguerite Snow and Robert Elliott.Parish & Pitts p.293 ==Cast== * William Nigh as Buttsy Gallagher * Jules Cowles as Michael Gallagher * Roy Applegate as Judge Winters * R.A.

It was erected in 1984 to commemorate the victims of various nationalities of the Buchenwald evacuation trains. Coming from the Buchenwald concentration camp, a train with 54 freight cars arrived at Nammering station on 19 April 1945 after a twelve- day journey. During the five-day stay, 794 prisoners lost their lives here. They had been starved to death, killed or shot. On 24 April, the train continued its journey through Passau, Pocking, and Munich to Dachau. Only 816 people arrived there alive and 2,310 dead were counted on the train at the Dachau concentration camp. Here in Nammering, the 270 prisoners who had already died during the transport were burnt in a quarry and the other 524 murdered were buried in a swamp meadow (Totenwiese). After the liberation of Germany by the Americans, the mass grave was only discovered three weeks later. The Americans ordered the half-rotten corpses to be excavated and laid out in rows on the meadow of the dead. Then the entire population had to pass by the dead. Each body had its own coffin and the victims were buried in five cemeteries in the surrounding area. In 1958 three cemeteries were exhumed, brought to Flossenb√ºrg and dissolved, 171 murdered people still lie in Eging and in F√ºrstenstein 39 dead are still buried. The KZ-Transport 1945 Memorial was erected about 300 meters east of the state road 2127 at the place where the transport came to a halt in 1945 for five days. On 24 April 2005, on the 60th anniversary of the murder of 794 prisoners, a commemoration ceremony was held at the described railway site in Nammering in the presence of survivors of the evacuation train, members of the German Bundestag, the Bavarian Landtag, the Bavarian State Government, representatives of the churches and local politics, and the population for the \\"greatest [...] terrible war crime in Lower Bavaria\\". At a commemoration ceremony on 19 April 2015, on the 70th anniversary of the transport, IG Metall also erected another memorial stone for the murdered trade union members of the train. Since then, the Arbeitskreis KZ-Transport 1945 has presented a permanent exhibition of the events of 1945 along the Danube-Ilz Biking Route.

The battery is larger at 4000mAh, and can be recharged at 18W wired over USB-C or 10W wirelessly (Qi). Biometric options include a capacitive (rear-mounted) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. An IP68 rating is also present. To compete with folding smartphones, the device offers a case accessory known as \\"LG DualScreen\\", which contains a second, 6.2-inch 1080p display panel. It is powered using pogo pin connectors on the phone, but communicates wirelessly. The camera layout is retained from the V40 as well, with a 12 MP primary lens, a 12 MP telephoto lens and a 16 MP ultrawide lens. Optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus are present on the primary and telephoto sensors. The V50 can record 4K video at 30 or 60 fps, and 1080p video at 30, 60 or 240 fps. On the front of the device, dual cameras are located within the notch, an 8 MP primary lens and a 5 MP wide lens. ===Software=== The V50 ships with Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\" and uses LG's UX 8. ==Reception== At launch, the V50 received mixed reviews from critics. Digital Trends was unimpressed by the V50, concluding that \\"the promise of 5G may not be enough to stir interest in the uninspired LG V50 ThinQ. Chokkattu stated that \\"we found the image quality to be lacking when compared to competitors\\" and criticized the user interface as being \\"clunky and cluttered\\", but praised the second screen for having a \\"polished experience\\". Several reviewers thought the phone was too expensive, with CNET stating that \\"unless you have a big budget and want to be on the absolute bleeding edge of network technology, investing in such a pricey 5G phone now is just not worth it\\". TechRadar praised the display and camera versatility, but criticized the design, calling it dated. PC Magazine was positive of the audio quality and performance, while noting that battery life was average despite the increase in capacity. Tom's Guide had similar views, stating that having faster 5G speeds \\"[isn't] enough to justify its steep price, especially when you consider its poor battery life and dated design\\". ==References== Category:Smartphones Category:LG Electronics mobile phones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2019 Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras ","title":"LG V50 ThinQ"},{"id":"60410990","text":"\\"Unbearably White\\" is a song by American indie pop band Vampire Weekend. It was released on April 4, 2019 by Columbia Records as a double A-side with \\"This Life\\", and the third single from their album Father of the Bride. ==Background== Discussing the track with The Sunday Times before its release, Koenig commented that \\"infighting among white people about who is marginally more or less white is not particularly interesting\\", and that the song partially explores that. The phrase \\"unbearably white\\" had previously been used as a criticism of the band, in reference to their race. ==Composition== The art pop song develops and shifts between isolated vocals, handbells, jazz fusion-inspired bass guitar, and orchestral swells, and lyrically explores a failing relationship. The track's title has been described as a \\"prank\\", as the song does not discuss Koenig's racial identity. ==Critical reception== For Pitchfork, Sheldon Pearce described the song as \\"gorgeous\\", concluding that \\"as the [song's] characters seek salvation from a bitter coldness, Vampire Weekend find a spark\\". ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Father of the Bride's liner notes. * Ariel Rechtshaid ‚Äì engineering, mixing * Chris Kasych ‚Äì engineering * John DeBold ‚Äì engineering * Hiroya Takayama ‚Äì engineering * Takemasa Kosaka ‚Äì engineering * Emily Lazar ‚Äì mastering * Chris Allgood ‚Äì mastering assistance ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2019) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - } ==References== Category:2019 songs Category:2019 singles Category:Vampire Weekend songs Category:Art pop songs Category:Songs written by Ezra Koenig Category:Song recordings produced by Ariel Rechtshaid Category:Song recordings produced by BloodPop Category:Columbia Records singles ","title":"Unbearably White"},{"id":"60410992","text":"Pankovo () is a rural locality (a village) in Dubrovskoye Rural Settlement, Yelovsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

All of the council's wards were up for election, meaning a total of 15 councillors were be elected. Before the election, the Labour Party held control of the council with 21 seats, a majority of one. They were aiming to defend the six seats they won at the 2015 election as well as another in Hednesford Green Heath which they gained at a by-election in September 2017. Labour lost four of the seven seats they were defending and only gained one, meaning they lost overall control of the council. Four Labour candidates stood as joint Labour and Co-operative candidates and one was elected adding to the three councillors who also represent the Co-operative Party on the council. The Conservatives had previously strengthened their position as the largest opposition group on the council at the previous elections and maintained their total of 15 seats. They lost one seat to the Green Party and another to Labour but also gained two seats from Labour, including one of the Hednesford seats they lost in the 2017 by-elections. The Green Party did not win any seats in 2015 but went on to gain a seat in 2016, at the 2017 by-elections and in 2018. They retained their by-election seat and gained two seats, one from Labour and another from the Conservatives, to take their total up to five seats. The Liberal Democrats only fielded two candidates this year: one in Brereton & Ravenhill and one in Rawnsley, both former strongholds of theirs. They succeeded in regaining Brereton & Ravenhill which they had lost to Labour in 2015. UKIP stood in six wards and increased their share of the vote compared to 2018 but did not gain any seats.

Sudmeier was involved with The Petticoat Panel, a report about the status of women in the CIA. == Early life and education == Sudmeier was born in Timber Lake, South Dakota, close to the Great Sioux Nation. Her father was fluent in the Sioux language. She studied English literature at The College of St. Catherine and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1933. Sudmeier returned to South Dakota in 1933, where she worked as an English teacher for five years. She joined a bank in 1935, where she worked as a secretary. == Career == In World War II Sudmeier joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps as a corporal. She had assignments in Edmonton and Fairbanks. She was awarded the World War II Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal. Sudmeier joined the Central Intelligence Group, where she worked as a stenographer in the Office of Reports and Excellence. She became a charter member of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947, and then transferred there from the Central Intelligence Group in 1951. Sudmeier was one of few women in the Junior Officer Trainee program in the 1950s. She worked as a reports operator, managing the Stations' Foreign Intelligence production. She was responsible for collecting information about priority targets and relaying information to the Central Intelligence Agency. During her first field assignment Sudmeier was involved in a counterintelligence operation. She was involved in a nine-year campaign in the Middle East where she coordinated an agent to assess Soviet military hardware. A report about the role of women in the CIA, which became known as the Petticoat Panel, was commissioned by Allen Dulles after a group of women employees questioned the gender pay gap. At the time, men were paid considerably more than women, and comments such as \\"Women are not qualified to perform in those positions which they do not now occupy,‚Äù were commonplace. Sudmeier was nominated for the Intelligence Medal of Merit, which caused controversy amongst members of the intelligence community who thought it was not appropriate for woman to be awarded such a distinction. She was supported by her colleagues in the Central Intelligence Agency North East region, and was eventually awarded the medal in 1962. Her supervisors continued to support her, included arguing that her 'gender [should not] prevent her' in her promotion. In 1966 Sudmeier was promoted to the GS-13 career grade. She was involved with raising the profile of the Reports Officers, making people recognise that it was more than \\"women's work\\". In 1972 Sudmeier took mandatory retirement. She died in Washington, D.C. in 1989. In 2013 Sudmeier was nominated as one of the Central Intelligence Agency Trailblazers. The award was received by her nieces, nephews and two grand-nieces. == References == Category:People from South Dakota Category:People of the Central Intelligence Agency Category:1912 births Category:1989 deaths ","title":"Elizabeth Sudmeier"},{"id":"60411281","text":"Anna R.

The twenty-fifth tropical storm, eleventh typhoon and 6th super typhoon of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season, Kong-rey originated from a tropical disturbance in the open Pacific. For a couple days, it went westward, organizing into a tropical depression on September 27. Then it intensified into a powerful Category 5 super typhoon early on October 2. Kong- rey underwent an eyewall replacement cycle after its peak intensity, causing it to weaken into a Category 3 typhoon under unfavorable conditions. Kong-rey then struck South Korea on October 6 as a tropical storm. Kong-rey transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day while impacting Japan. A total of 3 people were killed by the storm, including 2 people from South Korea. In South Korea, damage nationwide totaled at ‚Ç©54.9 billion (US$48.5 million). Although Kong-rey did not make a direct landfall on Kyushu or Shikoku, its outer rainbands affected the two islands. At an area in Shikoku, rain accumulated to 300 mm. In Nagasaki, more than 12,000 families lost power; in Fukuoka Prefecture, a person died because of the rain, mostly due to drowning. Agricultural damage in Okinawa and Miyazaki Prefecture were about JP¬•13.99 billion (US$123 million). == Meteorological history == In late September 2018, a tropical disturbance formed in the waters near Pohnpei Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also gave the storm, Invest 94W, a low chance of development. Over the next couple of days, the system moved westward and organized into a tropical depression on September 27, and the JMA initiated advisories on the storm, while the JTWC issued a TCFA. On September 28, the JTWC designated the system as 30W, while the JMA issued a gale warning for the system. As Tropical Depression 30W continued strengthening, the system became a tropical storm and was named Kong-rey by the JMA. On September 29, the system moved further west, found itself in favorable conditions for strengthening, and became a tropical storm. Later that day, Kong-rey strengthened into a severe tropical storm, and on September 30, the storm attained typhoon status at 03:00 UTC. Kong-rey continued strengthening, and at 18:00 UTC on October 1, Kong-rey became a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon. Early on October 2, Kong-rey strengthened into a Category 5 super typhoon. Unrelated to Kong-rey, Hurricane Walaka was a Category 5 hurricane and Kong-rey had Category 5 super typhoon intensity at the same time, marking the first time since 2005 when two tropical cyclones of Category 5 strength existed simultaneously in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected by vertical wind shear, low ocean heat content and decreasing sea surface temperatures, the storm gradually weakened to a Category 3 typhoon on October 3 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. Increased vertical wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures hampered Kong-rey's strength, and Kong-rey was downgraded to a tropical storm on October 4. Early on October 6, Kong-rey made landfall in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province in South Korea as a high-end tropical storm, and later on the same day, Kong-rey transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, while impacting southern Hokkaido, such as areas near Hakodate. == Impact == === Taiwan === Kong-rey was closest to Taiwan on the evening of October 4. Many parts of northern Taiwan are affected by their rain belts and strong gusts. The Meteorological Bureau issued special reports on heavy rains in five counties and cities, and also issued special reports on strong winds in 18 counties and cities. Many coastal areas and adjacent sea areas were strongly strengthened by grades 9-11. The gusts hit. === Japan === As the storm moved towards Japan, the Storm Alert was raised by the Japan Meteorological Agency, which was the highest wind alert raised locally. Kong-rey was an extratropical cyclone when it struck the Okinawa and Miyazaki Prefectures, resulting in agricultural damage of approximately JP¬•13.99 billion (US$123 million). As Kong-rey approached the Ryukyu islands, more than 200 flights to Japan were cancelled, including 6 flights from Hong Kong to Okinawa. Kong-rey was the second typhoon to hit Okinawa in the same week, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the local area which resulted in eight injuries and a total of 20,000 households facing power outages. Although Kong-rey did not directly impact the Kyushu and Shikoku regions, the rainband around it brought heavy rain to both regions. The Shikoku region recorded more than 300 millimeters of rainfall in one day, while approximately 12,000 households in Nagasaki faced power outages. Kong- rey also resulted in the death of an individual in Fukuoka. === China Mainland === Tropical Storm Kong-rey in the East China Sea on October 5, 2018 As Kong- rey entered the Chinese mainland, the National Meteorological Center of China issued a typhoon blue warning signal at 18:00 on October 3. The Fujian Provincial Meteorological Observatory issued a typhoon blue warning signal at 11:45 on October 3. On the evening of October 5, the coastal area of Zhejiang was affected by Kong-rey, and many tourists visited the shore in Shitang Town, Wenling City. As Kong-rey gradually approached Shanghai, the Shanghai Central Meteorological Observatory issued a typhoon blue warning signal at 17:00 on October 4, and the city flood control headquarters launched the city's flood prevention and prevention level IV emergency response. === Korea === Kong-rey made landfall in Tongyeong City, Gyeongsangnam-do at 9:50 am local time. The storm caused 2 deaths and 1 disappearance in the local area, and a total of 277 flights were canceled to and from the local area. There were severe flooding in Yingde County and Pohang City in Gyeongsangbuk-do, and more than 30 houses in Busan and Jeju Island were flooded. There were 55,000 power outages in Busan. The national economic loss was 54.9 billion won (a contract of 48.5 million US dollars). == See also == * Other tropical cyclones named Kong-rey * Other tropical cyclones named Queenie * Typhoon Tip ‚Äì A very large tropical cyclone that struck areas affected by Kong-rey * Typhoon Maemi ‚Äì Similarly typhoon that has a similar track and has struck South Korea * Typhoon Trami ‚Äì A typhoon that struck Japan before Kong-rey. * Typhoon Sanba ‚Äì Similarly typhoon that struck South Korea and Japan. == References == == External links == * JMA Best Track Data of Typhoon Kong-rey (1803) (in Japanese) * JMA General Information of Typhoon Kong-rey (1825) from Digital Typhoon * 30W.KONG-REY from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Category:2018 Pacific typhoon season Kong-rey ","title":"Typhoon Kong-rey (2018)"},{"id":"60411341","text":"Byron Sigcho-Lopez (born July 7, 1983) is a Chicago politician and community activist.

During his studies, he attended a seminar on modular forms and started to work in this area under the supervision of professor Anatoli N. Andrianov. After graduation, he continued research in the theory of modular forms, and in 1977 earned his PhD degree (Candidate of Sciences) from Leningrad Department of Steklov Mathematical Institute of USSR Academy of Sciences with the thesis \\"Euler products for congruence subgroups of the Siegel group of genus\\". During 1981‚Äì1993 he was a senior researcher of Laboratory of Theory of Algorithms at Leningrad Institute for Informatics and Automation of USSR Academy of Sciences. That time his scientific interests were switched to the computational complexity of algorithms in algebra and number theory. He was an active participant of a seminar on computational complexity headed by Anatol Slissenko and Dima Grigoriev. From 1993 he also began active collaboration with Ilia Ponomarenko, in algebraic combinatorics, which lasted until the end of his life. Many of the results obtained in this collaboration were included in his DSc thesis \\"Schurity and separability of association schemes\\", that was defended in 2004. Starting in 2005, he was a leading researcher in St. Petersburg Department Mathematical Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences. ==Scientific activities== During 1975-1982 Sergei had published a series of impressive papers on the arithmetic of Siegel modular forms. His PhD thesis contains very fine arithmetic constructions related to the ray classes of ideals of imaginary quadratic fields. Continuing his research on the theory of modular forms, he found an elegant analytical description of the Maass subspace of Siegel modular forms of genus 2, an explicit formula for the generating Hecke series of the symplectic group of genus 3, and the first explicit formulas for the action of degenerate Hecke operators on the space of theta-series In the mid-1980s, switching to the computational complexity of algorithms in algebra and number theory, he found a delicate and simple algorithm for factorization of polynomials over finite fields. The algorithm has a quasi-polynomial complexity under the assumption of generalized Riemann's hypothesis. Despite considerable efforts by mathematicians working in the theory of computational complexity, up to the present (2019), his estimate for the complexity of the factorization problem has not been improved. Starting in 1993, Sergei has been engaged into problems of algebraic combinatorics. Several profound results were obtained, including the refutation of the Schur-Klin conjecture on Schur rings over a cyclic group, a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing and testing isomorphism of circulant graphs, and building a theory of multidimensional coherent configurations .PDF The latter provided an algebraic explanation for the fact that the problem of isomorphism of finite graphs cannot be solved using only combinatoric methods. Another series of works was devoted to the problem of isomorphism and the algorithmic theory of permutation groups. In particular, a number of algorithms (which became already classical) for testing graph isomorphism were constructed. In the last years of his life, Sergei became also interested in p-adic analysis. Jointly with Sergio Albeverio and Maria Skopina he studied p-adic wavelet bases. These studies revealed an unexpected and highly nontrivial fact: unlike similar theories in other structures, the standard method in p-adic analysis leads to nothing except the Haar basis. Moreover, any p-adic orthogonal wavelet basis generated by test functions is some modification of the Haar basis. In his last work on this topic, an orthogonal p-adic wavelet basis generated by functions with non-compact support was constructed, while all previously known bases, as well as frames, were generated by the test functions. ==Notes== == References == *In memory of S.A.Evdokimov (in Russian) * Sergei Evdokimov on PDMI (in Russian) *Sergei Evdokimov in St. Petersburg Mathematical Societ == See also == *Evdokimov's algorithm Category:1950 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Russian mathematicians ","title":"Sergei Evdokimov"},{"id":"60411366","text":"Ministry of Economy and Trade (MOET; ; ) is a governmental ministry of Lebanon, headquartered on the 5th floor of the Azarieh Building in Beirut.\\"Contact Us.\\" Ministry of Economy and Trade (Lebanon).

He was the only nawab of the state who had his name inscribed on coins, and was noted for his extensive building projects. Though considered an ineffectual ruler and relatively unpopular during his lifetime, Ahmad's policies were later credited with ensuring communal peace in his small state during the widespread religious violence amid the Partition of India in 1947. As result, public opinion of his reign greatly improved after his death. ==Early life== Muhammad Ahmad Ali was born at Malerkotla in 1881. He was the second son of Nawab Ibrahim Ali Khan. ==Reign== Ahmad Ali Khan ascended the throne in 1908 after the death of his father. His formal investiture took place in 1909. From the beginning, his rule was troubled by property disputes among his family. Ahmad Ali Khan attempted to modernize his state and improve the living conditions of his subjects. He built a railroad, schools, hospitals, and a college. He also constructed a bazaar based on Jaipur's \\"pink city\\". These projects resulted in major debts for the Nawab, and his state. Malerkotla's administration reportedly went bankrupt soon after Ahmad's accession to the throne, and remained in this state during most of his rule. Corruption among the state's public services were also a problem. Despite his dire financial situation, Ahmad provided troops and money to the British government during World War I and World War II, incurring even more debts. Nevertheless, British officials generally had a low opinion of Ahmad, regarding him as easily influenced, and financially irresponsible. Ahmad's policies did not endear him to his subjects, and contemporary records indicate that he was not a popular ruler. He was criticised by local newspapers for his excessive spending, and religious attitudes. Ahmad generally tried to keep the religious peace in his domain, but when unrest and disputes occurred, such as during two religious riots in the 1930s, he would reportedly flee to Shimla, where he could be protected by the British. Both Hindus and Muslims in Malerkotla were regularly displeased with his decisions during disputes and accused him of sectarianism, although he wanted to stay out of the debates and did not favor one community over the other. In one of the most notable cases, Malerkotla's mufti led an exodus of Muslims out of the state in protest against Ahmad's perceived pro- Hindu bias. Religious studies expert Anna Bigelow credited local community leaders more with deescalating the religious conflicts in Malerkotla than Ahmad Ali Khan. The Nawab himself suspected, probably correctly, that some of the religious conflicts during his reign were at least partially engineered by his rival and cousin Ihsan Ali Khan. Nevertheless, Ahmad was notable insofar as he generally allowed public criticism of his rule, and attempted to keep both Muslims and Hindus somewhat satisfied. Whereas other Indian princes in the Punjab violently suppressed critics, and took part in religious pogroms, Ahmad's precarious situation as weak sovereign of a tiny state made him extremely cautious and interested in keeping communal peace. Ahmad's court culture was marked by the presence of qawwals who introduced Urdu and Persian qawwali. These songs were written by Amir Khusrow and contained verses from various religions. === The Partition of India and death === Unlike the other parts of eastern Punjab, there was no mob violence in Malerkotla State during the Partition of India in 1947. Ahmad Ali Khan maintained an army until the independence of India. Whereas other princely states in the region used their troops to carry out ethnic and religious cleansing campaigns, Malerkotla's forces tried to keep order, while thousands of refugees took refuge in the small state. In September 1947, the Nawab signed the Instrument of Accession to join the newly created Dominion of India, and requested that the Indian central government send the Indian Army to prevent chaos in Malerkotla. At the time, the Nawab was already very sick, and his son Iftikhar Ali Khan acted as regent for most of the time. Ahmad died on 16 October 1947 and was succeeded by Iftikhar who ruled just a few months until the monarchy of Malerkotla was abolished. Following his death, Ahmad was idealized by his son Iftikhar as \\"exemplary Indian prince\\" who had made possible the religious peace in Malerkotla due to his decades-long secular policies. Having witnessed the chaos and death in other states of the region, many locals in Malerkotla came to greatly improve their opinion of Ahmad, and to share Iftikhar Ali Khan's assessment of his father's rule. ==Coinage== Ahmad Ali Khan's full name was inscribed in the coins issued during his reign. He was the only nawab of Malerkotla to have his name inscribed on the state's coins. Previous rulers had instead inscribed the name of 18th century Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Durrani on their coinage; this tradition stemmed from Ahmad Shah Durrani having granted Malerkotla the right to mint coins in the first place. ==Personal life== One contemporary British official described Ahmad Ali Khan as \\"charming gentleman of no character or capacity\\" who, along with the rest of his family, had an \\"exaggerated sense\\" of self-importance. ===Marriages=== Ahmad Ali Khan married four times. On 6 August 1898, he married his cousin and first wife Dulhan Begum. In 1903, he married Mallika Zamani Begum, a cousin of Nawab Raza Ali Khan of Rampur.

The company's best known brand, introduced in 1951,Markenregister was called blend-a-med.Markenregister Since 1987, the company has belonged to Procter & Gamble. == Founding == The wordmark \\"Blendax\\" for toothpaste was registered in Germany on 4 January 1910,Markenregister and the Blendax factory was founded in 1932 by the brothers Rudolf und Hermann Schneider in Mainz; production started in 1936. The goal was to produce a brand of toothpaste that would be affordable by everyone. By the end of the 1930s, Blendax had become Europe's largest producer of toothpaste with 43 million tubes per year. The product portfolio was expanded to include other personal hygiene products like shampoo, soap, skin cream and Mouthwash. == Destruction and rebuilding == The main and original factory in Mainz on the Ingelheimer Aue (an island in the Rhine) was almost completely destroyed during World War II. The undamaged branch in Gera was appropriated after the war. At first it was known as VEB Blendax, later as VEB Gerana and after German reunification, as Gerana Cosmetic GmbH, before finally being closed in 2007 as a result of bankruptcy. The original buildings in Gera by the city moat are still extant. The Mainz work was rebuilt in 1946, with toothpaste production resuming in 1949. In 1956 the production was expanded to include shampoo and bath foam. A special toothpaste for milk teeth was introduced in 1956 under the name Blendi, and in 1957 the production of toothbrushes was started. In the 1970s, the toothpaste Strahler 70 was introduced. == Blend-a-med == In 1949 the Mainz pharmacist Hertha Hafer offered Blendax her original toothpaste recipe, and In 1951 they started production of blend-a-med, Germany's first medicated toothpaste, at first only available from pharmacies and dentists.

After training at Cardiff University, she worked as a physiotherapist in the National Health Service from 1983, eventually managing children and adult learning disability services for the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. ==Political career== Jones became involved with the professional body and trade union Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) as a steward, a regional steward, then a member of the CSP Council. In 2007 she was elected president of the Wales TUC for two years. In 2016 she became a full-time senior negotiating officer for the CSP. Jones joined Labour \\"when Tony Blair was leader\\", has \\"declared herself a socialist\\", but regarding Jeremy Corbyn acknowledges that there are \\"strong views for him and strong views against him.\\" She describes herself however as neither a member of the Blairite Progress nor the Corbynite Momentum group. She contested Monmouth for Labour at the 2015 and 2017 general elections. Jones was placed first on the party list in South East Wales at the 2016 National Assembly election. As Labour won 7 out of the 8 single member constituencies, Labour was not entitled to any extra seats from the Additional Member list, and Jones was not elected. Jones voted to Remain in the 2016 referendum. She argued following the referendum for the Prime Minister to seek a cross-party \\"consensus\\" on leaving the European Union, but says she is opposed to a \\"damaging Tory Brexit or a no deal outcome\\". She says that if \\"Parliament [is unable] to achieve a sensible Brexit\\", she would support a People's Vote. Jones was nominated as Labour's Parliamentary candidate for a third time, on this occasion for Newport West in January 2019 and was elected as an MP in April 2019 in the Newport West by-election, which had been caused by the death of the sitting Labour MP, Paul Flynn. On a relatively low turnout of 37.1%, Jones took 39.6% (9,308) of the vote, although the Labour majority dropped from 5,658 (in 2017) to 1,951. She was officially sworn in and took her seat in the House of Commons on 8 April 2019, and made her maiden speech on 1 May 2019 in a debate on climate change. Her constituency office at The Estates Office on Gold Tops was opened in June. Jones stated in 2019 that she supported the now-cancelled M4 relief road in order to relieve traffic congestion on the M4 motorway.. Jones became a member of the Environmental Audit Select Committee in May 2019. She has signed the Long Live the Local pledge to reduce beer duty and business rates. In August 2019 Jones joined 100 other MPs in calling for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to recall Parliament from the Summer Recess, and was one of 148 Labour MPs who wrote to the Prime Minister demanding he reverse the decision to prorogue Parliament in October for a Queen's Speech prior to the October 31 Brexit date. She voted in favour of the Benn Act, aimed at requiring an extension to Article 50 at the end of October to prevent a no deal exit on 31 October. Jones was re-elected in the 2019 United Kingdom general election on a slim majority of 2.1%. She was appointed to Labour's shadow Defra team, first as Shadow Minister for Flooding and Coastal Communities under Corbyn, and later as Shadow Minister for Natural Environment and Air Quality under Keir Starmer. She had been serving as PPS to Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Louise Haigh at the time of her promotion. == Personal life == Jones is married with two adult children, both of whom studied at Glasllwch Primary School where she is a School Governor. She lives in Allt-yr-yn with her husband and nine-year-old miniature dachshund named Monty. She volunteers at a local night shelter scheme as well as being a member of a choir. ==References== ==External links== *Ruth Jones website * - Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:UK MPs 2017‚Äì2019 Category:UK MPs 2019‚Äì Category:Welsh Labour Party MPs Category:British physiotherapists Category:Welsh trade unionists Category:People from Newport, Wales Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Welsh constituencies Category:21st-century British women politicians ","title":"Ruth Jones (politician)"},{"id":"60411695","text":"This was the first edition of the tournament.

On September 6, 2018, it was reported that production would begin in October 2018 and continue through March 2019 in Los Angeles. Diane Ruggiero-Wright and Dan Etheridge returned as executive producers. On September 20, 2018, Hulu officially confirmed the revival, and announced it would premiere in 2019. The season was originally scheduled for release on July 26, 2019, however, during the series' appearance at San Diego Comic-Con on July 19, it was announced that season would be available that day. Along with Thomas and Ruggiero, the writing staff consists of Heather V. Regnier, David Walpert, Raymond Obstfeld, and former NBA player and author Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Bell stated that the season was going to be darker and bigger and more cinematic, a little bit different\\" in comparison to the original series. Thomas stated the season takes place five years after the film and would \\"take Veronica Mars back to its hardcore So-Cal noir roots\\" and that it is \\"One big case [...] This is a detective show.\\" The revival features a new version of the original theme song, \\"We Used to Be Friends\\" by The Dandy Warhols, covered by Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders. ==Plot== Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) and her father Keith (Enrico Colantoni) are private investigators in Neptune, California, a popular spring break vacation destination. Real estate developer Richard \\"Big Dick\\" Casablancas (David Starzyk) campaigns for the enactment of city beautification laws; local business owners protest the likely expense of complying with such laws. Meanwhile, Veronica rejects a marriage proposal from her longtime boyfriend Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring). When a beachside motel is bombed, the Marses are hired to investigate by Congressman Daniel Maloof (Mido Hamada), whose brother's fianc√©e was killed in the explosion. A Mexican crime boss, whose nephew was another victim, sends two assassins, Alonzo (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Dodie (Frank Gallegos), to find and kill the bomber. Injured in the blast is Penn Epner (Patton Oswalt), a true crime enthusiast, who seizes the spotlight to accuse Maloof of the crime. The late motel owner's daughter, Matty Ross (Izabela Vidovic), investigates on her own; Veronica eventually takes her under her wing to supervise her. Veronica also befriends nightclub owner Nicole Malloy (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), and occasionally consults with Penn and his club of amateur crime-solvers. Their investigation implicates a local ex-con, who apparently commits suicide before he can be arrested. However, after his death, three more bombs explode in Neptune over several days. The Marses uncover evidence that Casablancas's fixer Clyde Pickett (J. K. Simmons) has been hiring the local juvenile delinquents, organized by Veronica's former friend Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro (Francis Capra), to mug spring break visitors, driving away tourism; Casablancas is then able to buy beachfront property cheaply, planning to redevelop the land for more upscale businesses. Veronica's ex-boyfriend Leo D'Amato (Max Greenfield), an FBI agent, arrives to investigate the case. His rekindled flirtation with Veronica eventually makes her realize how much she values her relationship with Logan. She loses her friendship with Nicole when she confesses to considering Nicole a suspect in the case and bugging her office, and decides to accept Logan's proposal. The Marses eventually conclude that Casablancas was responsible for the bomb at the motel, but the subsequent bombs were the work of a copycat. Casablancas is murdered by Alonzo and Dodie after Clyde tips them off to his guilt. The Marses arrest Penn as the copycat, but he hires them to prove his own innocence. Evidence is uncovered which briefly implicates Penn's fellow amateur crime-solver Don (Clark Duke), but Matty spots that the evidence has been tampered with: Penn was the copycat bomber all along, out for glory and attention. The Marses deduce the site of the next bomb, and Keith disarms the bomb with seconds to spare; but Penn gloats to Veronica as he is being arrested. Veronica and Logan are married that day. But a few hours later, Veronica's car explodes, killing Logan ‚Äî one last bomb that Penn had set earlier. The next year, when Neptune is fully gentrified and spring break tourism is a thing of the past, Veronica leaves Neptune to solve cases on the road. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars, a private investigator * Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, Veronica's father and a PI * Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls, Veronica's boyfriend and a Naval Intelligence Officer ===Starring=== * Francis Capra as Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro, leader of the Pacific Coast Highway biker gang * Clifton Collins Jr. as Alonzo Lozano, a mid-level hitman for a Mexican cartel * Percy Daggs III as Wallace Fennel, Veronica's best friend, a high school physics teacher and varsity coach who is now married with a child * Frank Gallegos as Dodie Mendoza, Alonzo's crime partner * Max Greenfield as Leo D'Amato, an FBI agent and former boyfriend of Veronica * Mido Hamada as Daniel Maloof, a Congressman * Ryan Hansen as Dick Casablancas, Logan's friend and now a movie actor * Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Nicole Malloy, the owner of a Neptune nightclub * Dawnn Lewis as Marcia Langdon, the new police chief of Neptune * Patton Oswalt as Penn Epner, a pizza delivery guy and true crime enthusiast who runs a websleuth group called \\"Murder Heads\\" * David Starzyk as Richard Casablancas, Dick's father and wealthy businessman who is a suspect of the bombings * Izabela Vidovic as Matty Ross, a teenager who loses her father in one of the bombings * Jacqueline Antaramian as Amalia Maloof, Daniel's mother * Paul Karmiryan as Alex Maloof, Daniel's younger brother * J.

Then he founded and ran in Palermo the newspaper \\"Prospettive Siciliane\\". From 1959 he worked as a correspondent for L'Ora of Palermo, for Il Giorno of Milan, for the agency ANSA, for Il Messaggero of Roma and for Il Gazzettino of Venice. === Murder === Young and ambitious, with the periodic founded by him, he followed with particular attention crime beat, the mafia phenomenon and its ramifications in the territories of Termini Imerese and Caccamo. Those activities led up to his death sentence by certain mafia clans . The circumstances of the murder were studied as if it had been a suicide. In fact he was found first of all dead on the tracks of the railways inside the tunnel Fossola near Termini Imerese, and this led the investigators to think it had been a suicide. His family was the first to raise the issue and to point out some particulars, then his colleagues that worked for L'Ora of Palermo, and also the brave journalist Mario Francese (also a victim of the mafia), but only 6 years later this case was reopened. In 1966 was carried out the autopsy on the journalist's body: the experts Marco Stassi e Ideale Del Carpio excluded that he had killed himself and they confirmed that he had been killed. From this moment Cosimo Cristina was totally forgotten. In 1999 the journalist Luciano Mirone from Catania dug up the case and he found out that the deputy commissioner of Palermo Angelo Mangano in 1966, famous for a photo known all over the world while he handcuffed the boss of Corleone Luciano Liggio, reopened the inquiry and wrote an explosive report that was neutralized by the result of the postmortem. Mangano found out that the reporter had been killed and then deposited on the tracks for feigned the suicide. The councilor of the Christian Democracy Agostino Rubino (one of the mafia bosses of Termini) and the boss Santo Gaeta were accused by the cop of being the instigators of the murder, who then were exonerated. After a lot of years, Mirone resumed that correspondence and brought it to light, by underlining contradictions in the autopsy report, brought to the attention of Vincenzo Milana, a teacher of Forensics at the University of Catania. He asked to the Public Prosecutor's Office of Palermo, through a collection of signatures, the reopened of the inquiry, but the outcome was negative. However the municipal administration of Termini Imerese dedicated a road in honor of the missing journalist in 2000. On 5 May 2010, Termini's associations, solicited under the local newspaper \\"Espero\\", deposed a tombstone out of the tunnel \\"Fossola\\", where was found the body of Cosimo Cristina. == References == == Bibliography == * * Luciano Mirone, recital-monologo: \\"Uno scandalo italiano.

It was described as being larger than the commoner Suncus murinus and without a musky smell. Males were shiny black with a white band or patch on the middle of the back. Females also had the white patch but were grey. Sonnerat described the shrew as being five and a half inches [149 mm] from the head to the base of the tail and the tail being one inch and one line or 29 mm. Since no specimen of the species exists, both its taxonomic description and its generic placement remain in question. Sonnerat's illustration of the holotype The supposed shrew species was given a scientific name by Anthony Cheke which was first published in 2012 but the description was not considered valid by some as the holotype was not explicitly designated (in this case the illustration, as there was no specimen) and it was therefore redescribed in 2018. The species was placed tentatively in the genus Diplomesodon which is nested within Crocidura according to a molecular phylogenetic study. Cheke placed the species tentatively in the genus based on the observation that the only other shew species with a piebald pattern was in the central Asian species Diplomesodon pulchellum.

The company was founded by Craig Thrupp, a former member of the Australian Defence Force. The directors of the company are Thrupp, David Saul and Dermot Casey. ==Operations== In September 2017, Paladin holdings was awarded an AUD contract to provide security, IT, local transport and some site management for three Australian immigration detention centers located in the town of Lorengau on Manus Island, Manus Province, Papua New Guinea. These centres are West Lorengau Haus, East Lorengau Refugee Transit Center, and Hillside Haus. They still held the contract as of April 2019. The contract has been reported, but not verified, as being valued at $423 million. In June 2019, after the contract had been renewed several times, the Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, said that Paladin's contract would probably be extended once again. However, a few days later the Papua New Guinean government indicated that they would cancel or terminate the contract. The PNG Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas said the PNG Government wanted a transparent tender process, and that ‚ÄúPapua New Guinean companies now have the capacity and expertise to do the job and should be given the opportunity to participate.‚Äù On 26 June 2019 the Australian Department of Home Affairs and the PNG Immigration and Citizenship Authority issued a statement confirming a limited extension of Paladin‚Äôs contract after which the PNG government would administer a tender process for a local party to take over the contract. In July 2019 media reports referred to an email from Paladin Managing Director David Saul that confirmed the contract had been extended for six months in a decision that ‚Äúrecognises the professionalism of Paladin. In April 2019, the company's website stated they employed 4,500 local nationals across the Asia-Pacific, including in Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and Singapore. In June 2019 Paladin announced that its strategy of nationalising its PNG workforce had reached the milestone of 98 per cent local staff after its expatriate staff numbers had been halved in two years with more nationals stepping into senior managerial and technical roles. Paladin also increased the shareholding of Peren, the local landowning group, to make it a fifty-fifty partnership as per the terms of an MoU that was signed in 2014. Prior to being awarded the large contract, Paladin's work included being a subcontractor providing security at East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre on Manus Island, which housed 60 people. Their contract was worth about $15 million a year as estimated by competitors, though currently unverified. In July 2019 Paladin sponsored an initiative by Australia-based not-for-profit Screens Without Borders to bring cinema back to Manus Island after forty years. A series of film screenings were held in remote communities across the island. Paladin's contract for Manus Island ended on the 30th of November 2019, they aimed for an orderly transition to a PNG company to provide care and maintenance at the ELRTC facility. ==Subsidiaries== Paladin's website states that they are Australian-owned.

On 21 February 2019, Paladin published a statement on its website clarifying that neither of these businesses were owned, managed or controlled in anyway by Paladin or its directors. ==Controversies== Registered office locations In February 2019 the company transferred its Australian office to a building in Canberra. Their main offices are located in Singapore. Government contract tender process Paladin were awarded the Australian Government contract by the Department of Home Affairs without an open tender process, which suggests they were the only company invited to bid, this is unverified. This was despite having little experience and a poor reputation, according to allegations made by the Australian Financial Review, now retracted. Paladin has had a record as a subcontractor providing services on Manus Island dating back to 2013. The Department of Home Affairs stated that it had previously run a closed tender but attracted little response partly because larger companies didn‚Äôt want the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù. The Australian Financial Review reported that Serco, Broadspectrum, Spotless Group, Blue Point Services, Anitua (PNG-based firm) and Canstruct (a Brisbane-based construction firm who later acquired a $591 million contract to manage Nauru Regional Processing Centre) indicated interest in the contract, but were not allowed to bid, this is unverified. Removal of Craig Thrupp from contract In April 2019, it was revealed that Craig Thrupp was removed from the contract at the request of the Home Affairs, out of concern about an email account. Money laundering case Kisokau Powaseu, a former colonel in the Papua New Guinean Defence Force, was detained in Port Moresby in January 2019 on charges of money laundering relating to his time in the Papua New Guinean Defence Force. He was for a brief period, a local director of the company in Papua New Guinea and no further action has occurred in relation to these charges. Civil case The company's former chief executive in PNG, Craig Coleman, was suing Paladin in February 2019 claiming breach of contract and that employees were sent to Manus under misleading pretences. Security dispute In January 2018, there was a dispute between Paladin and Kingfisher Security, a PNG security firm. Kingfisher officers prevented Paladin staff from entering the detention center. Refugees reported feeling unsafe due to the disruption caused by the local firm, however the situation was soon resolved. Alleged corruption In February 2019 it was reported that the family of one of PNG's most powerful politicians was directly benefiting from the business of Paladin. Paladin entered into a contract with Peren Solutions, a company with links to the family of Job Pomat, deputy leader of the ruling People's National Congress Party, speaker of the PNG Parliament, and key ally of Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. Job Pomat, who was elected Speaker of Parliament in 2017, has denied any links to the firm, a position supported by Paladin which stated that Peren represents the traditional landowners of the site that the Lorengau facility is located at, and that they are under the leadership of Kepo Pomat. The agreement with Peren predates the award of this contract and the election of Mr. Pomat. Labour disputes In 2018, Paladin Solutions acquired a leading local security services provider called Black Swan and there were some complaints over wages following this acquisition. All Paladin employees earn award wages and regulatory obligations to superannuation met. The same month, some Paladin employees walked off the job, demanding better pay (most were paid between $2‚Äì3 per hour), better security, meals, and overtime pay for long shifts. They also complained that some employees had their wages reduced. This industrial action was illegal under Papua New Guinea law and police intervened to help resolve the situation. Sexual assault case In April 2019 an Australian Paladin employee was arrested and jailed on Manus Island due to allegations of sexual assault. The employee was a former G4S employee and had returned to Manus to work for Paladin. The alleged victim is a Paladin employee. Australian government audit In March 2019, the Auditor General of Australia announced that he was reviewing all Australian Government contracts for the offshore processing of asylum seekers. This followed a request by the Australian Labor Party for the Auditor to review the Paladin contract. Though, the Auditor General stated that offshore contracts had already been suggested for a performance audit, before Labor's request. ==See also== * Paladin (disambiguation) * Paladin Group (fascist private military contractor), an unrelated, defunct fascist mercenary group that operated in Francoist Spain ==References== Category:Private military contractors Category:Security companies of Australia ","title":"Paladin Group (security company)"},{"id":"60411991","text":"Kromanti dance or Kromanti play (capitalised to Kromanti Dance or Kromanti Play) is a Jamaican Maroon religious ceremony practiced by Jamaican Maroons. It is rooted in traditional African music and religious practices, especially those of the Akan people of Ghana. The name Kromanti (or Coromantee) derives from Kormantin (or Cormantin ) where a historical slave fort in the coast of Ghana was located. Many slaves shipped to Jamaica during the Atlantic Slave trade originated from present‚Äìday Ghana in West Africa.Prahlad, Anand, Reggae Wisdom: Proverbs in Jamaican Music, Univ. Press of Mississippi (2001), p. 276, (Retrieved 4 April 2019)Bilby, Kenneth, The Kromanti Dance of the Windward Maroons of Jamaica, Nieuwe West-Indische Gids, 55/1&2 (1981), p. 52-102Rodriguez, Junius P., The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery, Volume 1; Volume 7, ABC-CLIO (1997), p. 195, , (Retrieved 4 April 2019)Bailey, Anne Caroline, African Voices of the Atlantic Slave Trade: Beyond the Silence and the Shame, Beacon Press (2005). p. 6 (Retrieved 4 April 2019) The pure form of Kromanti dance is not one of those contemporary dances of Jamaica, neither is it a Jamaican party or hall dance, but a sacred dance based on the tenets of traditional African religious practices. Although the dance has influenced some aspects of Jamaican culture, and is still practiced today, the religious aspects of the dance are no longer performed as in the past‚Äîdue to Jamaican Maroons' conversion to Christianity.Bilby, Kenneth, Caribbean Crucible [in] Repercussion: A Celebration of African-American Music (ed. Geoffrey Haydon and Dennis Marks), p. 130 [in] Academia.edu (Retrieved 4 April 2019) Despite its modern twist, it is still concerned with solving problems of day-to-day life, such as illnesses resulting from spirit possessions, infidelity, and any other life problems. The Maroons viewed Kromanti dance as a form of metaphorical warfare, a protection on a spiritual level rather than a physical one.Taylor, Patrick; Case, Frederick I.; The Encyclopedia of Caribbean Religions: Volume 1: A - L; Volume 2: M - Z, University of Illinois Press (2013), pp. 476-81 (Retrieved 4 April 2019) ==Rituals== The ritualistic aspects of Kromanti dance involves a \\"distinctive music and dance styles\\" which is \\"centered around possession by ancestral spirits.\\"Bilby, Kenneth, Caribbean Crucible [in] Repercussion: A Celebration of African-American Music (ed. Geoffrey Haydon and Dennis Marks), p. 132 [in] Academia.edu (Retrieved 4 April 2019) Some of the surviving elements derived from African tradition are Country, a music style that uses a drum language like the Dondo, in order to play songs and proverbs; and healing, which is achieved through a rhythmic dance, music, and possession. Like \\"many other African-derived healing ceremonies, a possessed medium attends to patients, employing song, dance, sacrifice, and herbal remedies.\\" The Kromanti dance usually begins after nightfall and continues until daybreak. After several hours, the dance losses its recreational momentum and the chief \\"fete-man\\" (ritual specialist, similar to an African high priest) becomes possessed. ==See also== *Akan religion *Obeah *Jamaican Maroon Creole *Kumina *Convince *Nyame ==References== Category:Afro-American religion Category:Afro-Jamaican culture Category:Obeah Category:Religion in Jamaica Category:Akan culture ","title":"Kromanti dance"},{"id":"60411996","text":"Le Vernet-Cham√©ane is a commune in the Puy-de-D√¥me department in Auvergne in central France.

He arrived on January 4, 1845, in Walvis Bay and arrived in Otjikango (Gross Barmen) on April 9 of the same year to work as an assistant to his fellow Rhenish Missionary Carl Hugo Hahn. He learned the Herero language so fast that he could preach in it by 1847. At the end of 1845, a major drought led to famine and the community was cut off from Walvis Bay, and Rath was assigned to go there by way of Windhoek to procure the necessary supplies. He set out on January 28, 1846, three days before his 30th birthday, but found no passage to Walvis Bay available from Windhoek and had to travel on to Cape Town. Difficulties en route to Cape Town led him to return to Otjikango on December 19, 1846. In 1848, he traveled to Cape Town once more. On March 21 of that year, he married Anna J√∂rris van Mettmann of D√ºsseldorf (Germany) in Walvis Bay. The couple had six children until a shipwreck killed Mrs. Rath and her four youngest children in Walvis Bay in 1859. The remaining children, Emma Cathrina and Anna Margaretha, were nine and ten years old respectively. Hermann was six, Johannes four, Mariechen two, and Leopold a newborn. == Founder of Otjimbingwe == By the decision of a missionary conference in Otjikango in April 1849, Rath was assigned to found a missionary between there and the coast. On July 9, 1849, he founded the Otjimbingwe mission on the banks of the Swakop River, at a location the Rev. Heinrich Scheppmann had already noted as ideal for such a waystation in 1845. The nomadic Herero chief Zeraura agreed to settle there, leading the first of his people there with the rains in January 1850. The Rev. Rath built a simple brick house for himself and his daughters and a rudimentary building with holes for doors and windows to serve as the local church and school. Fifty pupils attended the first class. At the end of 1852, the Herero's perennial enemies, the Nama people, attacked Otjimbingwe, and after their repulsion Rath journeyed to Cape Town once more in January 1853. He returned to his fields with Johanna Gertze (the first baptized Herero) and returned at the end of 1853 after seven months working in Bethanie. Along with Hahn, the big game hunter Frederick J. Green, and J.W. Bonfield, the Rev. Rath left once more on May 20, 1857 on a four- month journey to Ovamboland, mainly with an eye toward continuing the mission. They reached as far as Ondonga before local hostility forced them to flee for their lives. Rath and Hahn returned to Otjimbingwe on September 11, 1857. Hahn wrote of the perilous journey in the RMS journal Berichte der Rhenischen Missionsgesellschaft (1858), in Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen (nos. 11‚Äì17), and in a joint report of Rath, Hahn, and Green published under the title \\"Account of an expedition from Damara Land to the Ovampo in search of the river Cunene\\" (Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. II, 1857‚Äì1858). == Shipwreck in Walvis Bay == In October 1858, Anna, her five siblings, and others traveled by ship from Walvis Bay to Cape Town, where the two oldest (Anna and Emma) were to attend school and Rath was going to work on printing his 3,900-word Herero language dictionary. On the family's return on April 1, 1859, Johannes lost his wife and four of his children in their shipwreck. Adinda Vermaak's 2004 book Kroniek van ‚Äôn kontrei, die verhaal van die NG kerk Kuilsrivier (\\"Chronicle of a Parish: The story of the Dutch Reformed Church (NGK) Kuilsrivier\\") recounts the tragedy as follows: > In 1859, the Rev. Rath, his wife, his [four remaining] children, and his > Damaraland servant, Katuti, were travelling to Stellenbosch where their two > eldest daughters, Emma Cathrina (10) and Anna (8), were boarding at the > Rhenish Institute (now the Rhenish Girls' High School). Rath described the > family tragedy in a gripping letter to his daughters. On March 25, 1859, the > Rath family boarded the freighter Flora in Cape Town, en route to the > mission in Damaraland. They were near Walvis Bay already at suppertime on > April 1, when the Rev. Rath heard someone call out for the captain. Soon > afterwards, they could feel the ship run aground. Rath immediately called > out for his wife and fetched his four children from their beds. When they > reached the deck, the waves had already breached part of the bulwark. He > asked several of the crew to help his family climb higher up the rigging. > None volunteered; it was everyone for themselves. The only place the Rath > family and servant could stand was on the stairs. At the top stood the Rev. > Rath with the two-year-old Mariechen and the four-year-old Johannes in his > arms. Further down, where he could hear but not see them were his wife Anna, > the baby Leopold, Katuti, and the six-year-old Hermann, who tried bravely > not to cry. The icy waves continually crashed over them. When he realized > Mariechen had died in his arms, he thought it better not to tell Anna. The > two prayed aloud and read Bible verses to each other, as they prepared to > die. After about an hour in the icy water, Anna exclaimed \\"Father, Leopold > is dead.\\" They then decided to await death quietly. A while later, Katuti > said 'Hermann, na koka' ('Hermann is dead'). He heard nothing further from > Anna. Later, he heard from Katuti that‚Äîshortly after Leopold died‚Äîthe rope > Anna was holding slipped out of her hands, when she sunk into the icy > waters. The Rev. Rath then let the lifeless bodies of Mariechen and Johannes > slip from his arms into the waves. After a while, stunned by the crashing > waves, he focused on saving his own life and encouraged the still-living > Katuti to climb higher. Besides the five Rath family members, three crew > members had also perished. After he and Katuti were saved and eventually > reached Walvis Bay, the Rev. Rath desperately searched the coast for the > bodies of his wife and four children. All that washed ashore, however, was > his wife's suitcase. The lock was broken and all the contents stolen, except > for his Damara book. Also in the suitcase was a page from a sermon he had > delivered on May 16 of the previous year: 'Thy will be done, on earth as it > is in heaven.' (Matthew 6:10) At the end of the sermon, he could make out > the next words, 'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Praised be the > Lord.' (Job 1:21) In the last part of his moving letter, he encouraged his > two daughters in Stellenbosch to take courage. He compared their mother's > suffering to Christ's on the cross. To comfort them, he relayed her telling > him a short while before her death that she \\"was not wholly uneasy,\\" and > reminded them that even Jesus, for his part, felt compelled to cry out 'My > God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' (Matthew 27:45). == Moving to the Cape == Because his health had been affected by the shipwreck and he wanted to live closer to his two surviving children, he requested a transfer to the Rhenish mission at Sarepta near Kuils River. He returned to Otjimbingwe, but on June 13, 1861, he left the mission and South West Africa for good. In 1862, he began his long tenure as a missionary in Sarepta, where he worked until he was replaced on July 27, 1893, by the Rev. Friedrich Eich. Many of the local white farmers and their families attended his services, and he presided over many of their funerals. Vermaak writes: > 'The Rev. Rath closed his letter to his two motherless daughters by urging > them to follow the examples of their mother and Savior as diligent students > that they may serve God and their fellow man...They must learn, he closed, > so they could be of service. His two daughters apparently took their > admonition to heart.' Anna taught school from 1882 to 1898 in Sarepta. Her > sister, Emma, married a farmer from Kuils River, Dani√´l Francois > (grandfather Danie) de Villiers and settled on his farm, Annandale. She was > a lifelong citizen of Sarepta, including as a schoolteacher. It was largely > thanks to her that the residents of Kuils River, even before they had their > own congregation, were conscious of the mission. The De Villiers' daughters > both married missionaries: Anna Emma to Otto Sieb√∂rger,a Moravian > missionary; and Frederica (Frieda) to H.J. Groenewald. Before her marriage, > Frieda founded the Missionary Worker Society of Sarepta, conducted the > church choir, played the harmonium during worship, and taught Sunday school. In July 1882, Anna Rath took over the school in Sarepta with the young Maria Thomas as her assistant. The schoolhouse with its clay floor was already dilapidated. In October 1890, Rath informed the superintendent-general of education, Dr. Langham Dale, that the Cape government had not earmarked any funds for building schools, and her father accordingly took the lead, spearheading the demolition of the school to rebuild a new one that December. Local farmers and other community members each donated 500 or more bricks so the school, consisting of two classrooms, could open Easter Monday, March 30, 1891. After retiring, Rath initially lived in Stellenbosch, but after the marriage in November 1898 of his daughter Anna (Otjimbingwe, March 29, 1851 ‚Äì Wellington, January 26, 1940) to the Rev. Jacobus Pauw, he left for Wellington, Western Cape to live with his son-in-law. On a visit to his other daughter, Mrs. D.F. de Villiers of Kuils River, he died, and he was buried in Sarepta. == Writings == Rath and Hahn co-wrote the first hymns, scriptures, and Bible stories published in Herero (Omahungi oa embo ra lehova na Omaimpuriro mo Otjiherero, Cape Town, Saul Solomon & Kie, 1849). In the 1850s, just like Hahn, he apparently worked intensively toward publishing other works, especially a German-Herero dictionary. This yielded a primer (Omahongise nokulesa Motyi-herero, G√ºtersloh, 1862), but his other works survive only in manuscript. The Grey collection at the National Library of South Africa in Cape Town features, among others, a short English-Herero glossary (from roughly 1865); an 1865 manuscript, Materialien zu einem Otjiherero-Deutschen W√∂terbuche, in 17 notebooks, and an 1873 manuscript written in five notebooks: Otjiherero W√∂rtersammlung als Deutsches alphabethisches Register zu dem Otjiherero-Deutschen W√∂rterbuche von [J.

It is based on the 1904 Broadway play by Anne Crawford Flexner,https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/mrs-wiggs-of-the-cabbage- patch-5904 which itself is taken from the 1901 novel of the same name by Alice Hegan Rice.Goble p.877 == Plot == Mr. and Mrs. Wiggs, prior to their marriage, worked as a coachman and housekeeper to Colonel Vanderhurst, who removed his son, Jack, from his will for marrying a woman connected to the circus. Years later, Jack and his wife both pass away, leaving Lovey Mary with Jack‚Äôs wife‚Äôs sister and her sister‚Äôs husband, a temperamental circus proprietor. Along with Lovey Mary goes Jack‚Äôs marriage certificate, Lovey Mary‚Äôs birth certificate, and a locket with a portrait of Jack and his wife. Now, Mr. and Mrs. Wiggs are married with five children, suffering greatly, especially due to strikes at Mr. Wiggs‚Äô work. This place is controlled by wealthy politician Murphy, who‚Äôs stepson Bob pities the strikers, specifically Mr. Wiggs and his family. Bob becomes an attorney and Mr. Wiggs leaves the town in search of other work, meeting Lovey Mary‚Äôs uncle, the circus proprietor. With Mr. Wiggs absent, Mrs. Wiggs struggles greatly with poverty as she tries to take care of her family alone. Years pass, and Mrs. Wiggs continues struggling. Colonel Vanderhurst decides to make a will in Lovey Mary‚Äôs favor after regretting his harshness with his son. He releases advertisements to find Lovey Mary, which Mary‚Äôs uncle finds and plans to turn in Lovey Mary as his own daughter to receive the inheritance. Mr. Wiggs falls in love with a circus performer and has a child named Tommy with her, who Lovey Mary becomes fond of. When her uncle tells her the plan, she runs away with Tommy. Her uncle chases after her but she is rescued by Bob. She has another close call with her uncle, but escapes by train with Tommy, and stops near the Cabbage Patch. Noticed by one of the Wiggs children, she is taken to Mrs. Wiggs house. Soon, she is kidnapped by her uncle with Tommy still at the house. Her uncle takes her to claim the inheritance, but Bob‚Äôs firm represents the Colonel‚Äôs estate and Bob becomes suspicious. He visits the circus, which is currently in the Cabbage Patch, and goes to Mrs. Wiggs, discovering the truth. Bob follows Lovey Mary‚Äôs uncle under disguise and saves her as she is about to be murdered. The two later run into Mr. Wiggs and convince him to return to Mrs. Wiggs, who forgives him for abandoning her and their family, and Bob and Lovey Mary announce their decision to get married. == Production and Reception == Beatriz Michelena in Salomy Jane in which she acted alongside Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch co- star House Peters. Beatriz Michelena, who played Lovey Mary, and House Peters, who played Bob, had been on a film prior to the filming of Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch with the California Motion Picture Corporation called Salomy Jane. Though Michelena held a special relationship with the California Motion Picture Corporation and received star treatment, she felt upstaged by Peters due to his acting style, which caused many problems during the production of Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. Michelena did not like play the film was based from and was angry that her role of Lovey Mary was not the title role, believing her role was not glamorous enough. Peters also disliked his lack of screen time as Bob. This led to an argument between the two and Peters storming off and never returning to the set. Producer George E.

For reasons of race and politics, he was obliged to emigrate during the Hitler years, living his final decades in Queens, New York. Although sources sometimes describe him as an American journalist, his preferred working language remained German. West German newspapers for which he reported from New York during the 1950s and the 1960s included the Rheinischer Merkur and Vorw√§rts. His experiences as a soldier during the First World War turned Gro√ümann into a powerfully committed pacifist. He served as General Secretary of the German League for Human Rights between 1926 and 1933. ==Biography== ===Provenance and early years=== Kurt Richard Gro√ümann was born in Berlin-Charlottenburg, the second child of the businessman Hermann Grossmann and his wife Rahel (born Rahel Freundlich). Both parents were originally from East Prussia and had, like thousands of others during the closing decades of the nineteenth century, moved from the economically depressed countryside to the rapidly expanding German capital in pursuit of better financial security. Fifteen years older than his wife, and 48 by the time his son was born, Hermann Gro√ümann died following a heart attack in 1909, leaving Kurt and his elder sister Margaret to be bought up by their mother as a single parent. Margaret later recalled that as a boy Kurt Gro√ümann became an enthusiastic junior member of the city's Animal Welfare Association. He used to visit the Berlin carriage stands, which were the taxi ranks of the time, and distribute leaflet to the coachmen urging that they should treat their animals with consideration. ===School, apprenticeship and war=== Gro√ümann attended junior school locally and moved on to the nearby \\"Leibniz-Oberschule\\" (secondary school) in Charlottenburg. His academic progress was, in the context of his subsequent career, notably undistinguished, and in September 1913 he left the school \\"to get private lessons\\". In 1914 he embarked on a commercial apprenticeship with \\"Handelshaus Kosterlitz\\", an import-export business in the colonial goods sector. 1914 was also the year in which war broke out. Two years later, by now aged nineteen, and seized by the spirit of those times, he volunteered for military service, joining the imperial army in March 1916. For two and a half years he saw active service on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. Then, in September 1918, he was captured and detained by the British army. His commercial apprenticeship had included English language lessons, and in the prisoner of war camp in which he was held he was set to work as a simultaneous translator. The internment lasted approximately a year. ===Pacifist=== In September 1919 he returned to his job with \\"Kosterlitz\\". Early in 1920 he switched to the Darmst√§dter und Nationalbank, employed in the bank's Berlin branch. In his spare time he worked voluntarily for a Prisoners of War organisation. Kurt Gro√ümann had emerged from the British PoW camp as a committed pacifist and, in the face of significant opposition from populist elements, he took a lead in the international honouring of war victims. In Berlin, on Totensonntag (loosely, \\"Sunday of the Dead\\"), in 1921 he organised a \\"Feier zu Ehren der Toten des Weltkrieges\\". Reactions were mixed, but when the event was repeated in 1922 participants included the president of the Reichstag (parliament), Paul L√∂be. Gro√ümann's involvement with the German League for Human Rights dates back to this period. A few years later, on 11 November 1928, Gro√ümann teamed up with Stephan Fingal to stage the only formal commemoration in Germany of the 1918 armistice of the \\"Weimar\\" period. ===Human rights=== In 1926 Gro√ümann was elected General Secretary of the German League for Human Rights. Under his guidance the league campaigned against courtroom injustices. One particularly high-profile case in which Gro√ümann and the league involved themselves was that of the illiterate Polish (or Russian: sources differ) labourer, Josef Jakubowski who was found guilty of murder, sentenced and executed in 1925. The trial was widely regarded as flawed, and there was a sense that Jakubowski's status as an illiterate foreigner might have played a part in his wrongful conviction and sentencing. The campaign succeeded in obtaining a (posthumous) \\"partial rehabilitation\\" for Jakubowski after the \\"real murderers\\" had been caught and sentenced in 1929. However, the various officials responsible for the original mistrial and for the gratuitous delays in investigating it went unpunished. Another case in which Gro√ümann engaged prominently involved Walter Bullerjahn who was set-up by a commercial rival and then, in 1925, found guilty of treason and sentenced to a fifteen-year jail term. Bullerjahn's release was reported in 1932. ===R√©gime change and exile=== At the start of 1933 the National Socialists took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a post-democratic one-party dictatorship. Gro√ümann was one of the organisers of \\"Das Freie Wort\\", a large \\"antifascist protest meeting\\" held at Berlin's Kroll Opera House on 19 February 1933 (which was broken up by police after two hours). The targets of the protest were a number of major human rights threats and violations, including restrictons on freedom to assemble and on press freedom, which had been imposed during the three weeks since the Hitler government had taken power. A few days later he was telephoned by a friend. Robert Kempner informed Gro√ümann that he was about to be arrested. A few days later Kempner, deemed politically unreliable, was suspended from his position as a senior lawyer with the Prussian police service. Pausing only for long enough to destroy thousands of letters, notes and manuscripts that might have been of interest to the authorities, on 28 February 1933 Kurt Grossman took a trip to Prague. Keen to avoid drawing attention to himself at the border, Gro√ümann travelled alone, with 200 marks and a small suitcase. No one was there to meet him at 20.20 when he arrived from Berlin at Prague's Masaryk station. None of his friends in Prague was expecting him. The previous evening Kurt and Elsa Gro√ümann had been guests at a party in Berlin held by the Social Democrats to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Karl Marx. On his arrival he took a taxi to the home of a friend whom he knew through the Human Rights league, which became his first stop along the route of his long \\"escape from the Hitler terror\\". Elsa and the couple's son Walter joined him in Prague on 5 March 1933. Back in Germany, during the next few weeks thousands of high- profile Jews and anti-Nazis were arrested. Subsequently discovered German government records show that had he not escaped when he did, Kurt Gro√ümann would have been among the first of them. On 25 August 1933 the German government published a list of Germans to be deprived of their citizenship. In the end there would be 359 such lists. The first was relatively short, containing just 33 names. Almost half of those listed were of Jewish provenance. Kurt Gro√ümann was on the list, both on account of his Jewish provenance and because the authorities had identified him (correctly) as an enemy of National Socialism. In Prague he set up the \\"Demokratische Fl√ºchtlingsf√ºrsorge\\" (loosely, \\"Democratic refugees' welfare\\" organisation), which involved tapping into his skill at dealing with the authorities and a talent for finding sources of funds to provide support for many German political/race exiles in the Czech capital. He moved on to Paris in 1938. After the Munich Agreement in September of that year he made efforts, from Paris, to help extract endangered German anti-fascist exiles out of Czechoslovakia. ===New York=== Kurt Grossmann arrived in New York in 1939: that was the year in which, for France and Germany, war broke out. In New York he worked for the World Jewish Congress which had been intensifying its practical efforts on behalf of persecuted Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany since the √âvian Conference which had been convened in July 1938 at the instigation of the United States president. A formidable organiser and prodigious author of memoranda, letter, reports and articles for publication, he took a lead in organising and contributing to material support for refugees. Subsequently he also actively engaged with the Jewish Agency and, after the war was over, the Jewish Claims Conference. Having arrived as a stateless refugee, during the 1940s Grossmann acquired US citizenship. After1945 Grossmann took as his principal mission the forging of German-Jewish reconciliation. Already during - and in some cases before - the war he had been a frequent contributor to publications that were or had become \\"emigrant newspapers\\" such as Aufbau, Neue Weltb√ºhne, Neu Vorw√§rts, Pariser Tageblatt and Neue Tage-Buch. During the postwar period Grossmann was briefly employed as US correspondent for the SPD newspaper Vorw√§rts, and at various stages wrote for all West Germany's important left-liberal newspapers. He also worked for the (Swiss) Berner Tagwacht and the (Israeli) Jedioth Chadashoth. Over more than twenty years he published thousands of articles and a large number of books. One of his best known works, appearing in 1957, was \\"Die unbesungenen Helden: Menschen in Deutschlands dunklen Tagen\\" (\\"The unsung heroes: Individuals in Germany's dark days\\") which describes individual acts of resistance in opposition to National Socialist persecution. This book provided a launch-pad for a 1960 initiative by the Berlin Senator Joachim Lipschitz to commemorate, for the first time, the \\"antifascist\\" activities undertaken by a wide number of citizens never individually identified. In 1972 Kurt Grossmann was nominated as a candidate for receipt of the Carl von Ossietzky Medal to be awarded by the Berlin branch of the International League for Human Rights. Unfortunately he died unexpectedly before the matter could be progressed to a conclusion. ==Output (selection)== ==Notes== ==References== Category:Journalists from Berlin Category:20th-century German journalists Category:20th-century American journalists Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States Category:1897 births Category:1972 deaths ","title":"Kurt Gro√ümann"},{"id":"60412519","text":"Andrew Christian Zabriskie (May 30, 1853 ‚Äì September 15, 1916) was an American heir and real estate investor. ==Early life== Zabriskie was born in New York City on May 30, 1853. He was the son of Sarah Jane (n√©e Titus) Zabriskie (1822‚Äì1892) and Christian Andrew Zabriskie (1806‚Äì1879), who was prominent in Episcopal church circles in Bergen County, New Jersey. His father never engaged in business, instead preferring the \\"quiet enjoyments of county life.\\" His paternal grandparents were Mary (n√©e Ryerson) Zabriskie, a direct descendant of Joris Jansen Rapelje, and Andrew Christian Zabriskie, who was born in Paramus at the ancestral homestead. Besides his father, his paternal uncles were Martin, John, and John Jacob Zabriskie, all descended from Albrycht Zaborowski, who left Ducal Prussia after the Thirty Years' War, and came to New Amsterdam on the Dutch ship De Vos ship in 1662. Through his paternal aunt, Matilda Mary (n√©e Zabriskie) Greene, he was a first cousin of Alister Greene, who served as Zabriskie's best man at his 1895 wedding. Through his uncle Martin, he was also a first cousin of Eliot Zborowski, who married Margaret Astor Carey, a granddaughter of William Backhouse Astor, Sr. His maternal grandparents were Captain William M. Titus, who served in the War of 1812, and Maria (n√©e Gardner) Titus. Zabriskie was educated in private schools and, later, graduated from the School of Mines at Columbia University. ==Career== Zabriskie was one of the largest real estate owners in New York City and devoted much of his time to managing the estate. His office was located at 52 Beaver Street in a building built by his grandfather, William M. Titus, on land once owned by his great-grandfather, Thomas Gardner, \\"a wealthy resident of Paramus, and who was somewhat eccentric in disposition.\\" He also served as president of the Bergen Turnpike, which was originally incorporated in 1802 with Colonel John Stevens as its first president. After joining the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society in 1874, he became a life member in 1894, served as third vice-president from 1880 to 1883 and then as first vice-president from 1884 to 1896, and lastly, the president for ten years beginning in 1896. He resigned in protest in December 1904 (and was succeeded by Archer M. Huntington) following a financial crisis where he advocated for the merger of the Society with the New-York Historical Society, but was rejected by the membership. ===Military service=== In 1873, he joined Company B of the 7th Regiment, N.Y.N.G. and served as Inspector of Rifle Practice for the 71st Regiment, where he served as Captain of Company C until his resignation in 1897. He was known as Captain Zabriskie for the rest of his life. Zabriskie donated a bronze trophy, known as the Zabriskie Trophy, \\"which is annually shot for by the various companies of the 71st Regiment.\\" ===Political career=== In Duchess County, he was a member of the Democratic State Executive Committee and chairman of the Duchess County Board of Supervisors. In 1879, he served as treasurer of the Independent Republicans in the \\"revolt against Governor Cornell's reelection.\\" In 1908, he was nominated as the Democratic candidate to represent the 21st District of New York in the U.S. Congress. He ran against the sitting Assistant Treasurer of the United States, Hamilton Fish II, who was a son of former U.S. Senator and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish. Also from his district was neighbor and the incumbent Democratic Lt. Gov., Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, who was running for Governor against the incumbent Republican, Charles Evans Hughes (later the Secretary of State and Chief Justice of the United States). Both Zabriskie and Chanler lost in their bids. Fish received 22,832 votes to Zabriskie's 19,725 votes. ===Residences=== In New York City, the Zabriskies variously lived at 12 East 30th Street, 2 West 56th Street and 34 West 53rd Street. In addition, the Zabriskie's owned two country estates, Province Island on Lake Memphramagog and Blithewood at Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. Province Island, at 100 plus acres, was the largest island on Lake Memphramagog and was located mostly in Magog, Quebec, Canada with a few acres at the southern tip located in Newport, Vermont. Around 1886, Zabriskie built a large mansion, a boathouse, and wharf on the Canadian side and the island was known as Zabriskie's Island. Zabriskie kept his steam yacht Dodo docked at the island. In 1917, after his death, the island was bought by Benjamin Howard, father of Canadian Senator Charles Benjamin Howard and was renamed Howard's Island. Around 1968, the residence built by Zabrieskie was demolished due to the costliness associated with its maintenance. In 1899, Zabriskie purchased Blithewood from John Bard's 1,000 acre estate and commissioned Francis L. V. Hoppin, an McKim, Mead and White alumnus, to tear down the old home and build a new 42-room Georgian-style manor house in the Beaux-Arts style. Bard had purchased Blithewood in 1853 from Robert Donaldson Jr., who had hired landscape designer Andrew Jackson Downing to transform the grounds upon his 1835 purchase of the 92 acre estate, then known as Annandale (owned by John Church Cruger, the father of Stephen Van Rensselaer Cruger and son-in-law of Stephen Van Rensselaer). ==Personal life== Zabriskie's daughter, Julia Zabriskie, in costume in 1915. In June 1895, Zabriskie was married to Frances Hunter (1866‚Äì1951) at the Madison Square Presbyterian Church. Frances was the daughter of Juliana M. W. (n√©e Zabriskie) Hunter and Charles Frederick Hunter, former president of the People's Bank of New York. Frances' maternal grandparents were George Zabriskie and Susan Van Campen (n√©e Romeyn) Zabriskie. Together, were the parents of two children: * Julia Romeyn Zabriskie (1897‚Äì1931), a d√©butante who married Edward Powis Jones (1880‚Äì1927), a Harvard Law School educated lawyer, in 1918. * Christian Andrew Zabriskie (1899‚Äì1970), a noted bibliophile and collector of art. In 1937, he donated a Mortlake tapestry known as \\"The Seizure of Cassandra by Ajax from a set of The Horses\\", to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was a noted collector of medals, giving speeches and writing a book on the topic. He was \\"particularly proud of his collection of medallions of Abraham Lincoln.\\" Zabriskie was a member of the St. Nicholas Society, the Holland Society, the Society of Colonial Wars, the Military Society of the War of 1812, the Union Club of the City of New York, the Army and Navy Club, the Riding Club the Aero Club of America, and the Metropolitan Club. On September 15, 1916, Zabriskie died at Blithewood, his country home in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. His estate, consisting mainly of an estimated $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 of real estate, was left entirely to his widow. After the death of his widow in 1951, Zabriskie's son donated 825 acres of the Blithewood estate, including its manor house, seven other houses, three barns, and two garages on the property, to Bard College, in exchange for $1. Today Blithewood is home to the Levy Economics Institute. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources ==External links== * * The Seizure of Cassandra by Ajax from a set of The Horses, , at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (gifted by his son in 1937). * Snap the Whip, 1872 by Winslow Homer, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (gifted by his son in 1950).

It has alternately arranged leaves, and flower heads of about across, with 3‚Äì4 whorls of involucral bracts, and about 20 blue purple ray florets, surrounding many yellow disc florets in the centre. Very characteristic for the species are also the middle-long hairs with forked tips on the surface of its fruits. It is an endemic species that is restricted to a zone along the southern coast of the Western Cape province of South Africa. == Description == Felicia cana is an upright, richly branched shrub of up to high. All parts except for the florets are covered in dense white felty hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately, are succulent, inverted lance-shaped in outline, up to 1 cm (0.6 in) long and 1 mm (0.06 in) wide, set at an oblique upward angle. The flower heads sit individually at the tip of an inflorescence stalk of up to long. Just beneath the flower heads the indumentum is less dense. The involucre that envelops the florets is up to in diameter, and consists of three to four whorls of bracts that are lance-shaped. The bracts in the outer whorl are about long and wide, and covered in white felty hairs. The bracts in the inner whorl are about long and wide and these tend to loose the indumentum, and have a resinous vein along the middle. About twenty female ray florets have blue violet straps of about long and 1 mm (0.04 in) wide. In the center of the head are many yellow, bisexual disc florets of about 2 mm (0.1 in) long. In the center of the corolla of each disc floret are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. The style in both ray- and disc florets forks, and at the tip of both style branches is a broadly triangular appendage. Surrounding the base of the corolla are many white, deciduous pappus bristles of about 2 mm (0.1 in) long, that are strongly serrated near the base and weakly near the top. The eventually yellowish brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are inverted egg-shaped, about long and wide, with a prominent, ridge along the margin, and scales on its surface. The middle long hairs that also occur scattered along its surface have a forked tip, but the hairs along the edge are not widened near their tips. === Differences with related species === F. cana is closely related to F. hyssopifolia, but differs from it by its dense covering of white felty hairs, the hairs on the surface of the cypselae that fork at their tips and the slender habit. == Taxonomy == Augustin Pyramus de Candolle was the first to recognise the distinctiveness of this species from Felicia hyssopifolia, and he described it in 1836 as Felicia cana, based on a collection made by Ecklon in 1805 near Swellendam. William Henry Harvey regarded it as a variety of Aster hyssopifolia (now Felicia hyssopifolia), making the combination Aster hyssopifolia var. canus. J√ºrke Grau agreed with De Candolle in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia, and restored the taxon to a species within the genus Felicia. == Distribution and conservation == Felicia cana occurs in the Western Cape province of South Africa between Riversdale and Bredasdorp. The continued survival of this species is considered to be of least concern, because it has a stable population. == References == == External links == * line drawing of Felicia cana * distribution map of Felicia cana cana Category:Endemic flora of South Africa Category:Plants described in 1836 ","title":"Felicia cana"},{"id":"60412620","text":"Korukonda Mandal is one of the 64 mandals in East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh.

Its fossil was uncovered in 2011 in the Yumaque Formation of the Pisco Basin at Playa Media Luna by a team consisting of members from Belgium, Peru, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. Parts recovered include the jaw, front and hind legs, bits of spine, and tail. Olivier Lambert, a scientist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and lead author of the study, noted that Peregocetus \\"fills in a crucial [knowledge] gap\\" about the evolution of whales and their spread. Peregocetus is the first recorded quadrupedal whale from the Pacific Ocean and the Southern Hemisphere. The discovery reveals that protocetids reached the Pacific Ocean and attained a near circumequatorial distribution while retaining functional weight-bearing limbs. == Description == Peregocetus was essentially a four-legged whale: however, it had webbed feet with small hooves on the tips of its toes, making it more capable of moving on land than modern seals. It featured sharp teeth and a long snout which suggests it fed on fish and/or crustaceans. == References == Category:Protocetidae Category:Lutetian life Category:Eocene mammals of South America Category:Paleogene Peru Category:Fossils of Peru Category:Fossil taxa described in 2019 ‚Ä† ","title":"Peregocetus"},{"id":"60413310","text":"The following is a list of all current judges of the United States district and territorial courts.

Council, formally known as the Nottinghamshire Nottingham and Mansfield Trades Council, brings together trade unionists in Nottinghamshire, in England. ==Forerunners== In 1861, a group of employers in Nottingham established a local Chamber of Commerce. This inspired trade unionists in the city, including William H. Leatherland, to form the Nottingham Association of Organised Trades. They aimed to settle disputes through negotiations, rather than industrial action, and more generally to unite trade unionists and encourage local trade unions to be run more efficiently. The association maintained a low level of activity through the 1860s, supporting the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Miners' Association during its strike of 1866 and 1867,Alan R. Griffin, The Miners of Nottinghamshire, vol.I, pp.11-24 and the London tailors during their strike in 1867. It was represented at the short-lived United Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades, and also in early meetings of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). In 1872, it hosted the congress, and Leatherland served as President of the TUC. Soon after this, it changed its name to the Nottingham Organised Trades Council. In 1875, local disputes led to the formation of a rival Nottingham Federated Trades Council. Initially, the Organised Trades continued to grow, and by 1878 it represented more than 6,000 members, via an executive with forty members. The most important unions represented were the Amalgamated Society of Operative Lace Makers and Auxiliary Workers and the Rotary Framework Knitters. However, over the next few years, both councils declined in membership, and important unions such as the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (ASC&J;), Nottinghamshire Miners' Association, Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS), and Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE), were not affiliated to either. In 1884, the Organised Trades worked with the Federated Trades, and the local Building Trades Council, to form a United Trades Council of Nottingham. Initially, this consisted of a committee with four representatives from each council, but the secretaries of the local branches of the ASE and ASC&J; were soon added, and the council began practical solidarity work, supporting a local bricklayers' strike, and then organising a demonstration to encourage lace makers in Long Eaton to unionise. Other actions were unsuccessful, including lobbying against mistreatment of checkweighmen who were active trade unionists, and against Nottingham Town Council awarding building contracts to companies based outside the city. At the 1885 UK general election, John Burns of the Social Democratic Federation stood in Nottingham West. While some individual trade unionists supported him, the Organised Trades passed a motion stating that it was not backing any candidate. Most leading figures supported the Liberal-Labour movement, and after Henry Broadhurst won the seat at the 1886 UK general election, the union council wrote to William Gladstone to thank him for appointing Broadhurst as Under- Secretary of State for the Home Department. Sam Bower and William Bailey were both adopted as Liberal-Labour candidates for the town council in 1889, although the United Trades Council remained officially non-political. Four delegates to the Building Trades Council instead gave their backing to a Conservative Party candidate. The ill-feeling generated by this led the Building Trades Council to withdraw from the United Trades Council. This spurred the Organised Trades and the Federated Trades to merge, forming the Nottingham Trades Council. ==History== The trades council first met on 19 July 1890. It initially had affiliations from 21 trade union branches, but another 17 affiliated before the end of 1891, including the Miners, the ASRS, and the new National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers. Inspired by the New Unionism movement, one of its first acts was to host a talk by Emilia Dilke of the Women's Trade Union League, and this led to the establishment of a union of women hosiery workers. The council began supporting political candidates, the first being John Skerritt, who stood in Wollaton without the backing of the Liberal Party. Skerritt was a joiner, and this convinced the Building Trades Council to work with the Nottingham Trades Council and some local socialists, forming the Workers' Electoral Federation in March 1891. This organisation was affiliated to the Labour Electoral Association, and endorsed trade unionists who stood for any political party, including Harry Collier who stood for the Conservatives. Skerritt was elected, but three other candidates were unsuccessful, and the organisation was soon replaced by an Independent Labour Union. During the 1890s, the council spent much time supporting member unions who were involved in disputes, and also raised money for trade unionists who were unable to work. In 1897, it persuaded the town council to place contracts with suppliers which paid agreed trade union rates. It grew in scope in 1903, when the Beeston Trades Council affiliated. It stood candidates for the School Board and the Board of Guardians, and by 1905 had five members on the latter body. At the 1906 UK general election, Arthur Richardson was elected in Nottingham South, and he often consulted with the trades council on how to vote in Parliament. By 1908, the council represented 40,000 workers in 65 trade unions, and it grew further when the Building Trades Council finally merged in. Interest in syndicalism rose, although the city was not in the forefront of the movement. Later, the council became known for the Communist Party of Great Britain members among its leadership, with Ernie Cant important around 1930, and Jack Charlesworth becoming the secretary in 1950. The council was eventually renamed as the Nottingham and District Trades Council, then as the Nottingham and District Trades Union Council, and eventually as the Nottinghamshire Nottingham and Mansfield Trades Council. ===Secretaries=== :1890: John Jepson :1894: W.

After graduating from high school, he was accepted to Oberlin College. While a freshman at Oberlin, Young used the proceeds from part-time work to pursue a private pilot's license. He soloed in under four flight hours of instruction and earned his private pilot's license at 20 years old. Young was so taken with flight, that he discontinued his college studies to attend the Coffey School of Aeronautics in Chicago, Illinois to earn his commercial pilot's license. Young attempted to find work as a commercial aviator for three subsequent years but, due to racial discrimination, he was unable to find work as a pilot. ==Tuskegee Airmen instructor== Perry H. Young Jr. (right) at Tuskegee As America's entry into World War II approached, the US government enacted the Civilian Pilot Training Program in 1939 to fund pilot training at or near select colleges and universities. The program was expanded in 1941 and included some historically black colleges and universities. Most notably, this included Tuskegee University in Alabama where the famed Tuskegee Airmen were trained. Young landed a job as one of the 40 African American flight instructors for the newly formed 99th Pursuit Squadron. He trained more than 150 Tuskegee Airmen pilots during his tenure. This included Lee Archer who was awestruck when he learned that some of the instructors in the program were Black: > \\"Very few of us knew anything about flying -- few blacks did -- and we > thought our instructors were going to be white. When I saw men like Perry > Young, I was surprised and proud. They were like minor gods to me.\\" Although he wanted to serve, Young was not allowed. The instructors were considered too valuable to potentially lose in combat and were forbidden to join deploying units. His wife was quoted as saying: > \\"He didn‚Äôt want to be an instructor who trained cadets. He wanted to be a > cadet. He wanted to fly\\". ==International work== Even though Young was instrumental in training so many pilots for the war, he could not find employment as a pilot when the war ended. He briefly attended Howard University while working for the Public Building Administration's trucking service. But he soon began moving to wherever he could find aviation-related work. In 1946, he went to Haiti and established a small airline (Port-au-Prince Flying Service), but it soon closed. Young remained in Haiti, flying for the Soci√©t√© Haitienne-Am√©ricaine de D√©velopment Agricole until 1953. He worked for the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority as executive pilot from 1953-1955. On Baffin Island, Canada, Young worked as an aviation mechanic for Seaboard World Airlines. He then moved to the Virgin Islands to take a pilot position with KLM, ferrying passengers to the Dutch Islands. By December 1956, Young had 13,000 flight hours (with 200 of those hours in helicopters). ==New York Airways== New York Airways (NYA) was a helicopter airline which started carrying passengers in 1953. When they upgraded their aircraft to Sikorsky S-58s, they needed to hire additional aircrew as the S-58 required a co-pilot. Young had been rejected previously from NYA for not meeting their helicopter flight time minimums (he had 200 hours, they required 500 hours). However, NYA management had now decided to 'break the color line' in aviation to bring good publicity to their fledgling helicopter ferry service. They contacted Young in the Virgin Islands and hired him on December 17, 1956. After weeks of training with the company, Perry Young took his first official flight as a copilot on February 5, 1957. In doing so, he became the first African American pilot of a regularly scheduled commercial airline in the United States. The New York Mirror reported on the flight: > With Perry Young as the co-pilot, the 12-passenger helicopter rose three > feet from the ground, hovered gently for a moment, then, pointing its snub- > nose down, soared straight up from LaGuardia Airport. In nine easy > ‚Äúbumpless‚Äù minutes we were at Idlewild... Perry Young is unique because he > is the first Negro pilot hired by any scheduled airline in America. ==Later career== Young would fly for NYA for 23 years (until the company went out of business in 1979). Afterwards, he flew sightseeing helicopter tours in the New York area until he retired. He died at the Horton Medical Center in Middletown, New York on November 8, 1998. ==References== Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:American aviators Category:Helicopter pilots Category:Tuskegee Airmen Category:1919 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from Orangeburg, South Carolina ","title":"Perry H.

She showed some promise as a juvenile in 2015 when she won a minor race on the second of her two starts. In the following year she was moved up in class and made steady progress, ending her season with a win in the Grade 1 Shuka Sho. As a four-year-old she defeated an international field to take the Dubai Turf and won the JRA Award for Best Older Filly or Mare. In 2018 she failed to win a race but finished second in both the Dubai Turf and the Hong Kong Mile. On her final racecourse appearance she finished second in the 2019 Dubai Turf. ==Background== Vivlos is a black mare bred in Japan by Northern Farm. During her racing career she was owned by the baseball star Kazuhiro Sasaki and trained by Yasuo Tomomichi. She was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Vivlos' dam Halwa Sweet showed some racing ability, winning five minor races from 22 starts, but became an outstanding broodmare whose previous foals included Verxina and Cheval Grand. Her granddam Morn of Song was a full-sister to Rahy and a half-sister to Singspiel. ==Racing career== ===2015: two-year-old season=== Vivlos began her racing career by finishing a close second to Classic Lydia in an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1600 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 24 October. At the same track four weeks later she was stepped up in distance for a maiden race over 1800 metres and recorded her first success as she won from Ribbon Flower and nine others. ===2016: three-year-old season=== In March 2016 Vivlos was moved up to Grade 3 class but made no impact in her first two starts as she finished towards the rear in both the Tulip Sho at Hanshin Racecourse and the Flower Cup at Nakayama Racecourse. After three-month break she returned to winning form as she took a minor race over 2000 metres at Chukyo Racecourse in July. On 10 September at Nakayama Vivlos started at odds of 4.8/1 for the Grade 3 Shion Stakes (a trial race for the Shuka Sho) and finished second of the eighteen runners, beaten two and a half lengths by the favourite Biche. In the Grade 1 Shuka Sho over 2000 metres at Kyoto on 16 October Vivlos, ridden by Yuichi Fukunaga, started the 5.3/1 third choice in the betting behind Biche and Jeweler. After racing in mid-division she produced a strong late run,took the lead in the closing stages and won by half a length from Pearl Code, with Kaiserball and Jeweler close behind. After the race Fukunaga said \\"We were in a perfect position and the trip was smooth and in good rhythm. I was aware of Biche behind me at the third corner but we were able to pick our own timing for the move. Her sister (Verxina) had a lot of speed and staying power but this filly has a tremendous burst of speed\\". In the JRA Awards for 2016 Vivlos finished third behind Sinhalite and Jeweler in the voting for the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly. ===2017: four- year-old season=== Vivlos's trainer Yasuo Tomomichi On her 2017 debut Vivlos was matched against male opposition in the Grade 2 Nakayama Kinen over 1800 metres on 26 February in which she stayed on well from the rear of the field to finish fifth of the eleven runners, two lengths behind the six-year-old winner Neorealism. The filly was then sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Turf over 1800 metres at Meydan Racecourse on 25 March in which she was ridden by the Hong Kong-based Brazilian jockey Jo√£o Moreira and started at odds of 14/1. The French colt Zarak started favourite ahead of the British-trained Ribchester while the other ten runners included Decorated Knight (Irish Champion Stakes), Deauville (Belmont Derby) and Mondialiste (Arlington Million). After racing towards the rear of the field as Ribchester set the pace Vivlos began to make progress and moved up to make her challenge on the outside in the straight. The outsider Heshem gained the advantage from Ribchester inside the final furlong but Vivlos took the lead in the closing stages to win by half a length. Moreira commented \\"She was brilliant. From the time that I sat on top of her on Friday, she gave me the feel that she was going to be very competitive... She made the job very easy for me today. We were travelling nice and when I took her out and she had daylight, she was strong to the line.\\" Her trainer Yasuo Tomomichi said \\"She travelled very well from Japan and she was very relaxed in Dubai. She relaxed again in the back of the field and quickened very well. It kept raining but the ground wasn't too soft, which suited her.\\" After an absence of over six months Vivlos returned in the Grade 2 Fuchu Himba Stakes at Tokyo Racecourse on 14 October. She started the 2.2/1 favourite against thirteen other fillies and mares but despite finishing strongly she was failed by a neck to overhaul Crocosmia. Four weeks later the filly was stepped up in distance and started 1.8/1 favourite for the Grade 1 Queen Elizabeth II Cup over 2200 metres at Kyoto in which she was partnered by Christophe Lemaire. She was in contention throughout the race but was unable to make any significant progress in the closing stages and came home fifth behind the three-year-old Mozu Katchan. In January 2018 she topped the poll to take the JRA Award for Best Older Filly or Mare for 2017 with 194 of the 290 votes. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Vivlos given a rating of 117 making her the 129th-best horse in the world and the fifth-best four-year-old filly behind Minding, Marsha, Persuasive and Songbird. ===2018 & 2019: five and six-year-old seasons=== In 2018 Vivlos again began her campaign in the Nakayama Kinen. On this occasion she started at odds of 5.4/1 and finished eighth of the ten runners behind the four-year-old colt Win Bright, beaten three and a half lengths by the winner. On 31 March the mare returned to Meydan Racecourse in an attempt to repeat her 2017 success in the Dubai Turf. Despite never looking likely to trouble the winner Benbatl she stayed on strongly in the straight to take second place ahead of her fellow Japanese challengers Deirdre and Real Steel. Almost three months later she was one of sixteen horses invited to contest the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres at Hanshin Racecourse and kept on well in the closing stages to comehome fourth behind Mikki Rocket. After a summer break of over four months Vivlos returned for the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho over 2000 metres at Tokyo on 28 October. She started at odds of 16.4/1 and came home eighth of the twelve runners behind Rey de Oro. For her final tart of the year the mare was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Mile on 9 December. Starting a 57/1 outsider she exceeded expectations as she came from well off the pace to take second place behind the local champion Beauty Generation. Despite expectations that she would be retired at the end of 2018, Vivlos returned for a final run in the 2019 edition of the Dubai Turf on 30 March. As in the previous year she came with a strong late run to take second place, beaten one and a quarter lengths by Almond Eye. After the race Tomomichi said \\"everything went right. It was her third time here and she clearly seems to really like Dubai and we‚Äôre really grateful of all that she achieved at this place. She's calling it a career now but I hope to be back in Dubai with her kid one day.\\" ==Pedigree== *Vivlos was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Halo, meaning that this stallion appeared in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree. ==References== Category:2013 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Japan Category:Racehorses trained in Japan Category:Thoroughbred family 12-c ","title":"Vivlos"},{"id":"60413636","text":"Xavier Tillman Sr. (born January 12, 1999) is an American basketball player.

At the time this part of the city had not been touched by urban growth, as Gda≈Ñska or Dworcowa streets could have been at the end of the 19th century. Sielanka district never included this square as, at the time, it was a property of Province of Posen () and not owned by the municipality. After the rebirth of Poland in 1918, the area was declared to be constructed, but no project was ever completed. In the 1960s, a memorial has been built up to celebrate the Millennium of the Polish State (). Designed by Polish artist Stanislaw Lejkowski on July 22, 1967, the project has never been entirely completed. In 2011, the city had even projects to demolish it, but it turned out to be too expensive. The site has been given the name Lieutenant Leszek Bia≈Çy in November 2013. Leszek Bia≈Çy was a hero of the Home Army during the Second World War. Under the code name Jakub, he was arrested in February 1945 by members of soviet controlled Ministry of Public Security and was murdered during interrogations on March 3, 1945. In October 1956, his remains were discovered in the basement of the UB building at No.4. A renovated stone memorial to honor Leszek Bia≈Çy and his heroic comrades has been unveiled in 2013.

In the years 1966-1967, a link was built between the No. 4 and 6. After the expansion of the late 1980s, the hospital had 127 beds. It provided medical care for the benefit of the Ministry of Interior employees until 1990. Since the fall of communism, it provides services to all patients without any professional restrictions. Today the facility provides medical services in the field of basic health care, such as Dental and Oral Medicine, rehabilitation, occupational medicine, laboratory diagnosis and medical imaging. The dark past of No.4 as UBP building has been highlighted in 2019, by the uncovering of a memorial plaque.

It was named in memoriam of Wincenty Witos. Ludowy Park (People's Park) was founded at the place of an ancient cemetery, dating back to 1778, the oldest and largest in the city. In 1838 was built a house for the administrator, with a separate room for the morgue. In 1884, a cemetery was erected and in 1898 a massive brick fence, which survived after the liquidation of the cemetery. Entrance was made through two wrought iron gates to Markwart street, leading to the chapel located in the middle of the graveyard. A large square with outgoing path, like spokes, divided the cemetery into quarters. A lot of different trees were growing there: oak, chestnut, European beech, downy oak, sessile oak, oak red, locust, birch, lime, common spruce, prickly spruce and white spruce, and near the house were 10 Catalpa bignonioides. In 1938, 66 species of trees and shrubs were growing in the cemetery where a majority of German tombs could be found. After Bydgoszcz's liberation in 1945, the old cemetery was closed and transferred to the Lutheran cemetery in Za≈õwiat Street. The liquidation of the ancient graveyard was carried out in 1951-1952, the last bone exhumation to Za≈õwiat street was held in 1956. Many tombstones have been destroyed during the liquidation, along with sculptures, reliefs and catacombs. It has been the case for some famous people's tombstones: * Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Younger (1775-1843); * Carl and William Blumwe, owners of Factory of Machine Tools, where a copy of the sculpture of \\"Christ the Saviour\\" by Bertel Thorvaldsen was standing. This sculpture has been moved to the square by the Lutheran Church of the Savior in Bydgoszcz, it is today one of the most impressive religious monuments in the city. Once the cemetery liquidated, a city park, named \\"People's Park\\" (), has been set up on the very place, using part of the remaining elements of the gone necropolis. In 1956, a concert shell has been erected with a capacity of 5000 people. This building replaced the amphitheatre erected in 1946 in Park Casimir the Great. In addition to the concert shell, three blocks of flats on the western edge of the park, and pavilions in the east were constructed. In 1974, at the southern edge of the park has been built the \\"Youth Palace\\". On June 3, 1984, at the initiative of People's Party, the park has been given the name of Wincenty Witos: his bust has been realised by Witold Marciniak and funded by Bydgoszcz Voivodeship's Polish People's Party. Between the monument and the concert shell, a round pool with a gushing summer fountain has been built. In 2007 have been performed renovations of parkways, concert shell and park greenery. On April 24, 2007, a black granite obelisk commemorating the existence of the old cemetery has been unveiled in the south-east corner of the park, bearing the inscription: \\"In Binding Memory of the former Protestant cemetery. City of Bydgoszcz Lutheran Parish of Bydgoszcz Bydgoszcz 2007\\" Since 2018, a heavy revitalisation of the park is in progress, it will end in November 2019.

He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1978 as a member of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), a Sikh-centered regional political party. Talwandi was elected SAD president in 1978 and 1988. He became the President of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) in 2000. He was elected to the Punjab Vidhan Sabha thrice in 1967, 1969, and 1972, and was inducted as a Minister of State for Development and Animal Husbandry in the Gurnam Singh Ministry and the Minister of State for Jails, Sports and Transport in the Parkash Singh Badal government. He represented Punjab in the Rajya Sabha from 1980 to 1986. == Early life and background == Talwandi was born at Chak No. 52, Lyallpur District (now in Pakistan) on 24 June 1929. His father, Jathedar Chhanga Singh, was a landlord in Mullanpur village in Lyallpur district. Chhanga Singh had actively participated in all Sikh morchas , including those of Guru Kal Bagh, Gangsar, Jaitu Nabha, Nankana Sahib, and Duska. As he was a member of the Lyallpur District Board at the time, his lambardar, which entitled him to a free land holding of 25 acres, was forfeited because of his actions. When no one in the village accepted the lambardar, the Government was forced to pass it on to his Talwand, who did not have formal schooling. In an interview, he admitted that he had never attended school. \\"I am an illiterate person. I have no formal education. Whatever little I know is what I have learned from experience in these 70 years. I firmly believe religion is the guiding light in everyone's life\\". == Political career == After independence, Chhanga Singh settled at Talwandi village in Ludhiana district, and was unanimously elected the sarpanch in 1955 for a decade. He earned the title of for his role in early years of Akali politics followed by arrests in all Punjabi Suba morchas, along with his brother Master Dev Raj Singh. He was arrested on 9 July 1975 for being a part of the first jatha against the Emergency and spent 19 months in jail. In 1960 and 1965 he was chosen as a member of the SGPC. He was elected thrice to become a member of the Punjab Assembly in 1967, 1969, and 1972, and was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1977. He was inducted as the Minister of State for Development and Animal Husbandry in the Gurnam Singh Ministry, and was also unanimously elected Leader of the Akali Legislature Party in 1967. He was the Minister of State for Jails, Sports and Transport in the last Parkash Singh Badal Ministry. His son is Ranjit Singh Talwandi He was appointed Senior Vice-President of the Akali Dal after Fateh Singh's death, and remained a member of the Akali Dal Working Committee since 1960. He was detained under the MISA for eighteen months during the emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and remained in Patiala jail with the late Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, other leaders of the political parties, and the Akali Dal. As the emergency was lifted by Gandhi in January 1977, all the political leaders opposed to Indira Gandhi were released and there was a discussion to merge political parties to form one political party in the Centre. The Janata Party was created as a result. On Mr. Mohan Singh Tur's indisposition in April 1977, Jathedar Talwandi was appointed Acting President of the Akali Dal. As a member of the Dal Parliamentary Board and chief of the party, he helped it win 58 out of 116 Punjab Assembly seats. He declared that the Akali Dal would cooperate with the newly formed Janata Party but would not merge with it and would remain its separate entity. Talwandi brought Parkash Singh Badal back to Punjab politics after the latter fell sick. In the 1977 Vidhan Sabha elections that followed the Lok Sabha elections, The Akali Dal and Janata parties came into power with Badal as Chief Minister. The trio of Akali Dal (Talwandi, Jathedar Tohra, and Badal) dominated the political scene. Talwandi organized the All India Akali Conference in Ludhiana in the month of October 1978 after 13 Sikhs were killed in a fight between Nirankaris and Akhand Kirtani Jatha followers. The conference was a big success and the Anandpur Sahib Resolution was passed with some amendments. The Akali-Janata Government was working smoothly when issues of alleged corruption by education minister Sukhjinder Singh surfaced. Badal wanted to remove Singh while Talwandi and Tohra opposed. Sukhjinder Singh was ousted from the cabinet and two ministers, Jaswinder Singh Brar and Randhir Singh Cheema, resigned as a show of solidarity with Sukhjinder Singh. This widened the differences between Badal on one side and Talwandi and Tohra on the other. Tohra reconciled with Badal and a complaint against Talwandi was made to the Akal Takhat and he was summoned by the Jathedar Akal Takhat who declared he wasn‚Äôt \\"\\". In 1980 Talwandi parted ways with Badal and formed his own Akali Dal (Talwandi). Meanwhile, Gandhi returned to power and she dismissed the Badal Government. Talwandi led a jatha to Delhi where he was detained in Tihar Jail for more than 18 months. He was released on appeal from the Akal Takhat and Sant Harchand Singh Longowal, dictator of Dharam Yudh Morcha. Talwandi was willingly arrested in Dharam Yudh Morcha along with one thousand followers at Ludhiana. He was detained at Ludhiana jail with Badal. As the Punjab state was engulfed in militancy and the Operation Blue Star took place in 1984, all the senior leaders of the Akali Dal were detained in different jails. By 1987, the party was leaderless. In 1989, Talwandi became the president of the Akali Dal. In November 1989, an assassination attempt was made on him in his village by the militants. His loyal supporter Harjinder Singh Jind, a member of the SGPC, and his gunman were killed in the attack, and Talwandi and his personal assistant Ujagar Singh were badly injured. Talwandi was made the president of the SGPC in 2001. == Personal life == He married Mohinder Kaur and has two sons and two daughters. His younger son Jagjit Singh became an SGPC member and his elder son is Ranjit Singh Talwandi, an Akali Dal leader, who was elected as a Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA). He has authored a book titled Mool Manter Swami Ram Tirath. He played an active role in the telecast of the Gurbani program via the ETC Channel. == Death == Talwandi was admitted to the Hero DMC Heart Institute due to multiple infections in the heart, kidney, and stomach. Vishwa Mohan had treated his condition critical on 6th September. News of his death spread on the morning of 19th September at seven o'clock. However, the doctors later maintained that his heart was beating and could not be declared clinically dead. He was pronounced dead by the Institute‚Äôs chief cardiologist, Gurpreet Singh Wander, DMCH medical superintendent Rajoo Chinna, and the Ludhiana civil surgeon at 11.10 am on 21 August 2014. He was 85 years old. == Legacy == In September 2016, Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, while attending Talwandi's second Barsi Samagam (death anniversary), laid the foundation stone of the \\"Jathedar Jagdev Singh Talwandi College of Professional Studies\\" at Bassian Kothi, near Ludhiana. In March 2020, the SGPC installed a portrait of Talwandi in the Central Sikh Museum in Punjab. ==References== ==External links== *Shiromani Akali Dal *Official biographical sketch in Parliament of India website *https://www.bhaskar.com/news/UT-CHD-veteran-akali-leader-jagdev-singh- talwandi-passes-away-4750721-PHO.html *https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/jagdev-singh-talwandi-inherited- politics-from-akali-activist-father/story-w5wXiFygGt7Nvxebyd6njO.html *https://entranceindia.com/election-and-politics/shri-jagdev-singh-talwandi- member-of-parliament-mp-from-ludhiana-punjab-biodata/ Category:1929 births Category:Lok Sabha members from Punjab, India Category:People from Faisalabad Category:6th Lok Sabha members Category:Shiromani Akali Dal politicians Category:Sikh Jathedars Category:2014 deaths ","title":"Jagdev Singh Talwandi"},{"id":"60413944","text":"Janusz PajƒÖk (born 19 February 1944) is a Polish wrestler.

Poems was printed by John Wilson of Kilmarnock in 1789. Sillar's interest in poetry predated his friendship with Burns, but was one of several reasons for it. ==The publication and its contents== The title page has the same attractive and impressively fleuron decorated layout as the Kilmarnock Edition of Burns's poems and of John Lapraik's poems, with a quote from the poet Ramsay. A list of the subscribers was not included and no copies, if printed, of a 'Proposals' advertisement or prospectus are known to have survived. The work was prefaced with Burns's 'Second Epistle' to his friend, put into print here by Sillar for the first time. The publication was a failure despite Burns's assistance and high opinion of his friend's poetic ability. The Poems dedication was to Hugh Montgomery Esq. of Skelmorlie, later the 12th Earl of Eglinton. Burns much appreciated the literary companionship of both David Sillar and John Lapraik and his friends influence upon his poetry therefore has considerable historical and literary significance. In his second \\"Epistle to Davie. A Brother Poet and Brother Fiddler\\" Burns wrote: { cellpadding=10 border=\\"0\\" align=center -  bgcolor=#f4f4f4 :Auld Nibor, :Hale be your heart, hale be your fiddle; :Lang may your elbuck jink an' diddle, :Tae cheer you thro' the weary widdle :O' war'ly cares, :Till bairns' bairns kindly cuddle :Your auld, grey hairs. :But, Davie, lad, I'm red ye're glaikit; :I'm tauld the Muse ye hae negleckit; :An' gif it's sae, ye sud be licket :Until ye fyke; :Sic hauns as you sud ne'er be faikit, :Be hain't wha like. } The format was octavo on hand made paper, in half-sheets with the watermark fleuron as a classic fleur- de-lis. Measuring 21.4 x 14.1 cm the trimmed gatherings or signatures were bound originally in blue printer's paper boards. The signatures run from A to Hh4 and the first two leaves of each half-sheet are signed. The book is organised with a title-page; Registration; Dedication; Preface; Table of Contents; Text; Glossary and a blank sheet at the end. The publication is 247 pages long with forty-five poems, nine songs, two epigrams and five epitaphs. David Sillar was assisted in the sale of his 'Poems' by Robert Burns who wrote to him on 22 January 1790, enclosing ¬£2 4S 0d from eleven subscribers to David's poems, a letter now in the possession of the Irvine Burns Club, Indicating that the subscribers therefore paid 4s per copy. Others who gave assistance are not on record but his \\"...numerous subscribers\\" are acknowledged in the preface. It is recorded as being \\"Entered in Stationers Hall\\" of the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers and the work was effectively published by the author himself. The eleven page glossary or 'dictionary' of Scots words was added for the benefit of those unfamiliar with this language, Burns had included one in both his Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect and his Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (Edinburgh Edition) indicating that many of the Scots words were by that time unfamiliar to some readers, especially those amongst the aristocracy. Sillar also added annotations in the main text to clarify or enhance the understanding of his works such as with the \\"Epistle to John Lapraik\\". The number of copies printed would have related to the number of subscribers and at least 342 copies were issued as a George Darsie recorded his subscriber's number in his copy which has its original boards and was later passed on to a William Darsie. It is known how many copies survive outside of major libraries. The value of the 'Poems' is enhanced by its link with Robert Burns and one was advertised by a dealer in June 1869 at 21/- or 1 guinea (see Wikimedia Commons link) whilst by way of comparison that year a good copy of the 'Kilmarnock Edition' sold for ¬£14. Only one edition of the Poems was printed, however copies are readily available through print on demand websites. ===Original and holographic material=== Unlike the Kilmarnock Edition the fleurons are restricted to the title page despite the printer being the same for both publications. Burns's second \\"Epistle to Davie. A Brother Poet and Brother Fiddler\\" was first printed in David Sillar's Poems. The Irvine Burns Club in Ayrshire possesses two original letters from Robert Burns to David Sillar, purchased by the club in 1975 from the Rev. David Sillar, Wetherby, Yorkshire, a great-great- grandson. Both letters were written from Ellisland, Dumfriesshire, and are dated 5 August 1789, and 22 January 1790. They are warm friendly letters and deal with the aforementioned act of Burns obtaining eleven subscribers for Sillar's Poems.Burns Scotland Retrieved 4 April 2019 ===Aftermath=== Unfortunately David Sillar was \\"No poet.\\" The poems were mediocre and were not well received. Makinson comments that his poetry was ponderous, lacked humour and was somewhat coarse. It has been suggested that his later failure as a grocer and subsequent bankruptcy and imprisonment in Irvine was in part related to the time he spent on composing poetry and songs. The apparent print run of 1000 copies, an optimistic number, would have contributed substantially to the losses Sillar incurred.Robert Burns's Letters In the summer of 1791 David had been forced to write and ask Burns for a loan, however the poet was not in a position to help and replied that \\"I am extremely sorry to hear of your misfortune, & the more so, as it is not in my power to give you any assistance - I am just five shillings rich at present .... I trust your many rich and influential friends will enable you to ger clear of that flinty- hearted scoundrel whose name I detest.\\" == The poems and songs in David Sillar's 1789 publication Poems == 'To the Author' 'Auld Neighbor' - by Robert Burns.

It forms mat-like colonies on rocks, or sometimes on the mollusc shells occupied by hermit crabs. ==Taxonomy== Harry Beal Torrey described the species in the much larger genus Hydractinia in 1902. That placement remained unchallenged for over a century until phylogenetic studies began to be carried on the Hydractiniidae, which revealed that Hydractinia required splitting. H. milleri was amongst the species transferred to the newly erected Schuchertinia in 2010. ==Description== Colonies of this hydroid consist of a carpet-like mat of stolons, interspersed with long spines, from which arise singly three different types of polyp; feeding polyps known as gastrozooids, reproductive polyps known as gonozooids and finger-shaped polyps known as dactylozooids. The stolons have a chitinous covering known as perisarc but the polyps are naked. The gastrozooids are pink, up to tall with a ring of 12 to 20 tentacles surrounding the mouth. The colony is either male or female, so all the gonozoids are the same sex. Female gonozoids contain a single egg. ==Distribution and habitat== This hydroid is native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean, its range extending from Vancouver Island to Monterey Bay, California. It occurs in the low intertidal zone and the shallow subtidal zone. It grows on and under rocks and boulders, and on the mollusc shells occupied by hermit crabs. ==Ecology== Species of hydroid are sometimes found growing on the mollusc shells occupied by hermit crabs. In one such case, a colony of Schuchertinia milleri was found on the shell occupied by the whiteknee hermit crab Pagurus dalli (which is more usually overgrown by a species of sponge). The association seems to be symbiotic, with the crab benefitting from the protection provided by the hydroid with its stinging cells, and with the hydroid benefitting avoiding being buried in the sediment, and by being transported to new feeding locations. The crab has been observed, when \\"wearing\\" other species of hydroid, to wipe the flagellum of its second antenna across the surface of the hydroid colony, in order to gather larger planktonic prey items from its epibiont. ==References== Category:Anthomedusae Category:Animals described in 1902 Category:Fauna of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Schuchertinia milleri"},{"id":"60414098","text":"Percival Gilmore Baldwin (December 15, 1880 - December 26, 1936) was born in St. George, New Brunswick, Canada.

He is the first Eastern Orthodox bishop of Korean ancestry. ==Life== === Early life === He was born on January 19, 1976 in the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk at Sakhalin Koreans family. He attended school in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, graduating from the Vostochny Lyceum in 1993. Alexei continued his education at the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk branch of the Moscow Commercial Institute, graduating in 1997. In May 1995 he was baptized and since that time he sang in the choir in the church of St. Innocent of Irkutsk, and then the Resurrection Cathedral in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. === Monastic life and ordination === Theophanes at a conference of Eastern Orthodox bishops in Astrakhan in 2015 On August 14, 1997, Alexei was tonsured a monk by Bishop Jonathan (Tsvetkov) of Yuzhno- Sakhalinsk and the Kuril Islands with the name Theophanes in honor of St. Theophanes the Confessor, Bishop of Nicea. On August 17, 1997, Theophanes, who was a monk, was ordained a hierodeacon by Bishop Jonathan; Bishop Jonathan thereafter ordained him a hieromonk on August 19. During 1997 and 1998, Fr. Theophanes was a priest at the Resurrection Cathedral in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, while serving as director of the cathedral choir and editor of the diocesan newspaper. In 1998, he went to Smolensk to study at the Smolensk Theological Seminary. During this period he was assigned to Assumption Cathedral in Smolensk. In 2000 he graduated from Smolensk Theological Seminary was assigned as a priest to the Diocese of Abakan and Kyzyl. In September 2000, in response to the request of the Bishop Sotirios (Trambas) of Zelon, he was sent to South Korea to serve as pastor to Russian-speaking Eastern Orthodox people, being temporarily assigned as an employee of the DECR of the Moscow Patriarchate to the clergy of the New Zealand metropolis of the Church of Constantinople, which included Korea. To celebrate the church services in Church Slavonic language, he was given a small underground chapel dedicated of St. Maxim the Greek in Seoul, but sometimes he served in other parts of South Korea. At the time of his arrival to the country he did not speak Korean. To study the language he attended daily language classes at the Yonsei University durind two years. On May 16, 2001, he was awarded a pectoral cross at the request of Metropoltan Kirill. On May 6, 2006, he was named Honorary Citizen of Seoul. He received a diploma from the hands of the Mayor of Seoul Lee Myung-bak. On June 6, 2006, he was elevated to the rank of hegumen by Metropolitan Kirill at Holy Trinity Catheral of St. Daniel monastery. On October 6, 2011, Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church elected him bishop of the newly established Diocese of Kyzyl and Tyva within the borders of the Tyva Republic. On October 25, 2011, Archbishop Jonathan (Tsvetkov) of Abakan elevated him to the rank of archimandrite. === Bishop of Kyzyl and Tuva === Theophanes leading prayers at the Resurrection Cathedral in Kyzyl October 30, 2011 at the Assumption Church in Troitse-Lykovo he was consecrated to the rank of Bishop .

On November 12, 2011 Bishop Theophanes came to Kyzyl, and on November 13 he celebrate his first divine liturgy after election on Diocese of Kyzyl. At that time Eastern Orthodoxy was considered in Tuva as a religion of ethnic Russians: if a Tuvan was to becomes Eastern Orthodox, he had to forget about the culture of his ancestors and turn into a Russian. For this reason, and also because of the lack of systematic missionary activity, the number of Tuvans who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy was insignificant, while ethnic Russians, who represented 6% of the total population of Tuva, were an ethnic minority and their number were decreasinge over time. In these conditions, he began to study and master the Tuvan culture. All the Church bookstores in Tuva began to sell the Bible in Tuvan, translated by the Institute for Bible Translation, and the translation of liturgical texts into Tuvan began. Missionaries from other regions of Russia were actively invited. On December 4, 2017, in accordance with the new regulations on the awards of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and all Russia elevated Theophanes to the rank of Archbishop in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. === Archbishop of Korea === On April 4, 2019, by the decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodx Church, he was appointed Archbishop of the of the Patriarchal Exarchate in South-East Asia, becoming locum tenens of the Diocese of Kyzyl. == References == Category:Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Category:Russian people of Korean descent Category:Living people Category:1976 births Category:21st- century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:People from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk ","title":"Theophanes (Kim)"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(I,[["render",H]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/29.md","filePath":"drive/29.md"}'),F={name:"drive/29.md"},G=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
