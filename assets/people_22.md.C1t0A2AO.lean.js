She majored in psychology as an undergraduate at the University of Colorado, studied education at Harvard and blind education at the Perkins Institute and Columbia University. She moved to Hawaii in 1928, and earned a master's degree at the University of Hawaii in 1935, with a thesis titled \\"A survey of the Japanese schools in Hawaii\\". == Career == Hamman taught a sight conservation class at Kawananakoa until 1935. She was the founding director of the Bureau of Sight Conservation and Work with the Blind, a government agency in the Territory of Hawaii, appointed by territorial governor Joseph B. Poindexter in 1935. As head of the agency she oversaw rehabilitation, vocational and instructional services, vision screening for children, annual eye cllnics, and other community projects. In 1945 she was invited to join the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America's national committee on school lighting. In 1953, she took an extended leave to research blindness in Micronesia, working with Marshallese eye surgeon Isaac Lanwi. She retired in 1955. Hamman also co-authored research on blindness in the Pacific Islands, including a 1941 paper on \\"Causes of Blindness in Hawaii\\" (Archives of Ophthalmology 1941), and a technical report on blindness in Micronesia, titled Ophthalmological Survey of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (1954). In 1937, she was involved in welcoming Helen Keller to Hawaii for a visit. In 1954, Grace Hamman received the Migel Medal from the American Foundation for the Blind. Helen Keller gave a speech at the presentation ceremony, in New York concluding that \\"It must indeed be a source of pleasure and gratification to you that you have enabled the Hawaiian blind to form part of the universal brotherhood that shall bring inner light and cheer to every continent and island of darkness.\\" == Personal life == Grace Crosby married businessman Marshall Sherman Hamman.

However, Sir Archibald Bruce Charles Edmonstone, 17th of Duntreath is considered the Chieftain for the Edmonstones of Duntreath. It has been speculated that much, if not all, of the senior line of the Edmonstone Clan has died off. Most Edmonstones (and variants of the surname) are believed to be descended from the Edmonstones of Duntreath. == Origins == Eric Anundsson or Eymundsson (traditionally died 882) was a Swedish king who ruled during the 9th century. The Norse sagas describe him as successful in extending his realm over the Baltic Sea, but unsuccessful in his attempts of westward expansion. Queen consort of Scotland, Saint Margaret of Scotland \\"Margaret of Wessex\\" \\"The Pearl of Scotland\\" (1045 - 116 Nov 1093), Was born in exile in the Kingdom of Hungary. An English princess and a Scottish queen. Daughter of Edward the Exile. and granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of England. After the Danish conquest of England in 1016, King Canute the Great had the infant son of Margaret; prince Edward of Scotland exiled to the continent. He was taken first to the court of the Swedish king, Olof Sk√∂tkonung his kinsman, and then to Kiev. As an adult, he travelled to Hungary, where in 1046 he supported the successful bid of King Andrew I for the Hungarian crown. ==The naming of the Shire of Edinburgh== Edmundus or Admundus, a person of note in the lands of reigned of King David I \\"Dauid mac Mail Choluim\\" who reigned 1124 - 24 May 1153. who is witness to the charter granted by that prince of the lands of Riddel, Waltero de Riddle, militi, got from the same king lands in Laudonia, now the shire of Edinburgh, which, according to humour and custom of men calling their lands after their own name at the time, he called Admonston or Edmonston, and transmitted it as a surname of heraldry appellation to his descendants. Recorded in 1248 when Henricus de Edmundiston was witness to a charter. In 1359, in the reign of David II, an inquest before the Baillie of Musselburgh, declared that \\"Henricus de Edmundiston\\" had died and that \\"Johannes de Edmundiston\\" was his legitimate son and heir. It added that he held land of the Abbey of Dumfermline. In 1352 John Edmonstone was appointed Coroner to the district of Lothian. In 1363 he joined the escort which accompanied David II to England to negotiate a truce. In 1367 and in 1369 passports were issued to Sir John Edmonstone and others, to travel to England on the King's behalf. The truce concluded at Edinburgh Castle, on 20 July 1369, was signed by John de Edmondiston and other nobles. In 1372 Edmonstone he travelled to England with twelve men, and in 1373 was sent as part of an embassy to Rome granted ¬£406-13s-4d for its expenses.Exchequer Rolls A charter of Robert II, dated 31 January 1374, authorized Sir John to travel as one of his ambassadors to France. They carried his instructions to intercede with Charles V to influence the Pope and Cardinals on behalf of Margaret Logie (widow of David II) in a suit to be brought before the papal court. Also they demanded reparation for attacks by Norman pirates on Scots traders. In 1381 a passport was issued to John de Edmonstone with 16 men and 16 horses, to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, while another for the following year permitted their return. Sir John must have been a man of substance. He was granted a charter of the lands and barony of Boyne, in Banff, by David II in 1369, and some lands near Haddington, East Lothian by Robert II. Also he seems to have been a trader. It is recorded that Richard II of England allowed him to take 200 quarters of malt with his own vessels from a port on the coast of Lincolnshire to any port he pleases in Scotland. The date of his death, and likewise the identity of his wife, are unknown, but records show that he was succeeded by his eldest son, also named John. Also according to Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 3rd Bt., the Archibald, who founded the family of Duntreath was probably his younger son. (See Edmonstone of Duntreath) John Edmonstone the younger was a courtier like his father. He married Isabel, or Isabella, daughter of Robert II and widow of James, 2nd Earl of Douglas and Mar. The estate of Edenham, or Ednam, in Roxburghshire, was granted to them by Robert 11 in 1390. Sir John by this marriage had one son David. An \\"agreement by way of indenture\\", dated Perth, 7 April 1410, between Sir John Edmonstone of that ilk and Davy Edmonstone, his son and heir, with Patrick (Graham) Earl of Strathearn... of the lands and barony of Tillyallan (Tullyallan?) in Clackmannashire, proves their acquisition of this property. Sir David, according to the Ednam pedigree, married Agnes, daughter of Robert Maitland of Thirlestane. He must have died in the prime of life for, in 1426, there is an inquest serving James Edmonstone as heir to this father. In 1430 James Edmonstone, while still a boy, was amongst the sons of the nobility who were knighted by James I of Scotland at Holyroodhouse during the celebrations which followed the christening of the King's twin infant sons. Sir James married firstly Isabella, daughter of Sir John Forester (ancestor of the Lords Forester of Corstorphine) by whom he had a son named John. Secondly he married Janet, daughter of Sir Alexander Napier (ancestor of the Lords Napier) by whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. The estates of Tillyallan, and of Boyne, in Banffshire where divided between them thus went out of the family. Sir James was succeeded in the patrimonial estates of Edmonstone and Ednam by his son John. Subsequently the Edmonstones, styled of \\"that ilk\\" and \\"of Edenham\\" continued to use Edmonstone in Midlothian as their main residence until it was sold in 1624. The family then moved to Edenham, or Ednam, in Roxburghshire, but this estate was sold by James Edmondstoune, last male heir of the senior line of the family, who died unmarried in 1772. It then changed hands several times until bought in 1827 by the 1st Earl of Dudley who took Ednam as his second title. Sir James Edmondstoune, prior to selling Ednam, had purchased the estate of Cora on the Clyde. His sisters lived there until the death of the last in 1826, when she was reputedly over a hundred years old.A System Of Heraldry. by Alixander Nisbet Vol. II 1816 == Edmonstones of Duntreath == Duntreath is known to have been part of the Lennox by the mid 14th century. A charter, dated 9 February 1408, made by Donald Earl of Lennox, granted the lands of Duntreath to his brother Murdoch. The document states that Donaldus de Lefnax (Lennox) living at Catter, near Buchanan, confirmed Murdacho de Lefnax, his brother, in the land of \\"Dumgoyak cum reddyng una cum monte que vocatur Duntreth,\\" and other lands of Blargin and of Dumfyn in the Lennox, for the heritable reddendo of a pair of white spurs yearly. The word \\"monte\\" is taken to refer to what used to be known as \\"the Court Hill,\\" now Park Hill, which rises on the east side of the Blane Valley opposite to Dumgoyak (sik). The top has been levelled, possibly for a fort, or a \\"mons placiti\\" or Moot Hill where courts of justice were held. The feudal privileges attached to Duntreath, indicate its importance. The Edmonstones of Duntreath descend from Archibald, believed to have been the second son of the first Sir John Edmonstone, and therefore brother of the second John, who married Isabella, daughter of Robert II. Isabella's brother, also named Robert, became Robert III in 1390, but because of physical and mental debility, he was supplanted as ruler. His heir the Duke of Rothesay, and his brother, the Duke of Albany (the first two dukes in Scotland) were given control of the government. In 1398 Queen Anabella, wife of Robert III, \\"instituted a great hastitudium (passage of arms) of twelve knights, of which the chief was David Duke of Rothesay, on the north of Edinburgh\\". Then in the following year the King accepted the challenge of Robert Morley, an English knight, that he would take a golden cup from his table unless prevented by a Scottish knight. Morley was defeated in this purpose by James Douglas of Strabnock. Mortified he rode south to Berwick, where he engaged in single combat on the same day with two Scottish knights, one Hugo Wallace and the other Archibald Edmonstone. The Englishman \\"got the worst of it\\" and Archibald Edmonstone may have received his knighthood in reward. In 1406 King Robert III was a desperate man. His eldest son, David, Duke of Rothesay, had almost certainly been murdered with his brother Albany's connivance, and now his surviving son James, a boy of twelve years old, was all that stood between Albany and the throne. King Robert, to save James, secretly made arrangements for him to go to France. Leaving Rothesay Castle on Bute, supposedly for St Andrews, to continue his education at the College, he was taken instead to North Berwick, and rowed out to the Bass Rock. There he was joined by an escort of men his father could trust, amongst them Sir Archibald Edmonstone. At last, after a month, a merchant ship the Maryenknyght of Danzig, her master a Captain Bereholt, with a cargo of wool and hides, sailed down from Leith and took James and his retinue aboard. It seemed that they had escaped but, on 22 March, as she rounded Flamborough Head, the ship was captured by a band of pirates led by Hugh-atte-Fen. They sailed to London where a delighted Henry IV rewarded them with the ship's cargo. Prince James was sent to the Tower of London, but the English, unwilling to provide for Scottish prisoners, apparently released his escort. Robert III died of shock on news of his son's capture, and Albany became Regent during the young King's captivity which lasted for eighteen years. In I4II Sir Archibald Edmonstone was one of two visitors who carried back letters to Albany and the Scottish Estates, begging them to negotiate his release.National Records of Scotland, State Papers, No. 12. King James I, as he now was, returned to Scotland in 1424. His uncle Albany was now dead, but by an Act of Parliament of March 1425, he tried and executed Albany's heir, Murdoch Duke of Albany, together with all but one of his sons and his aged father-in-law, the Earl of Lennox. He then distributed their forfeited lands to his supporters, who included William, son of Sir Archibald Edmonstone. An entry in the Chamberlain's Rolls in the Compota Ballivorum ad extra, under the head of the Earldom of Lennox, dated 1434, states that the Bailiff of the Crown \\"non onerat se de fermis terrarum de Erlelevin (Arlehaven), Drumfyn, (Dumfoin), et Duntreyne (Duntreyve, or Duntreath),...quia Rex William de Edmonstone de eisdem.\\" (because the King has infeft William Edmonstone in them.) Sir William Edmonstone, 1st of Duntreath, is styled of Culloden, lands near Inverness acquired from the Setons, a further indication of their relationship. In 1425 he married the Princess Mary, sister of James I and widow of the Earl of Angus, as her fourth husband. Although probably in her late thirties she bore him a son and a daughter. She is buried in Strathblane church. On 20 July 1593 the Laird of Tullibardine hit William Edmondstone of Duntreath in the face with the hilt of his sword during a session of the Parliament in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, in the presence of James VI.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 129. == Duntreath == The estate of Duntreath lies on both sides of the Blane Valley some twelve miles to the north of the city of Glasgow. Today, in the 1990s, it comprises some 6000 acres. The original Barony of Duntreath consisted of Duntreath, with Craigbrock, Arlehaven Edmonstone and Auchentail, Dumgoiach (Dumgoyach), Blairgar, including Blairgarmore, Blairgar Begg, and Caldhame, Ballewan Edmonstone, or Middle Ballewan, and Cult Edmonstone, including Corriedale.John Guthrie Smith, The Parish of Strathblane (1886). The places so named are as follows: Arlehaven. The eastern part of this, known as Harlehaven Douglas, belonged from the 13th century to the Douglasses of Mains. In 1665 John Douglas of Mains granted a charter of Harlehaven to John Lyle, whose descendant, James Lyle, sold the eastern part to John Norwall (or Norval), \\"Weaver of Arlehaven\\" in 1782. Four years later, in 1786, Lyle sold the western part, called West Arlehaven, or Meadowhead, to Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 1st Bt. Consequently, in 1868, Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 3rd Bt., bought East Arlehaven from the Norwalls, descendants of the weaver. Ballewan. Mid Ballewan, or Meikle Ballewan, as it was once called, has remained largely unchanged. The Spittal of Ballewan, a small acreage of land on the western side (now known as the High Haggles Field), is believed to have been granted by one of the Earls of Lennox to the Knights Templars. After their suppression it was held by the Knights Hospitallers, from whom it passed into secular hands. It first appears in the writs of Duntreath when a charter of alienation of \\"The Temples Lands of the Hospital of Ballewan\\" was given by John Blair and others to James Edmonstone of Broich. James Edmonstone then sold them in 1696 to his nephew Archibald Edmonstone of Ballewan. The Archibald Edmonstone lairds of Spittal continued until 1833, when the then Archibald sold them to his distant cousin Archibald Edmonstone, 3rd Bt., of Duntreath (see p. 29). Blairgar, Blairgarbegg, and Caldhame. Blairgarrbeg includes the hill of Dumgoyne. Calhame, now a part of the Lettre sheep farm, stretches in a north- easterly direction to the top of the Earl's Seat, (traditionally the look out point of the Earls of Lennox) which, at 1896 feet, is the highest point on Duntreath. The hill of Dumfoyne stands upon its eastern march. The Cult, which became known as Cult Edmonstone, was included in the grant by the Duchess of Albany to Sir William Edmonstone, 2nd of Duntreath, in 1445. Sold to a family called Foyer in 1716, it was redeemed by Sir Charles Edmonstone, 2nd Bt., in 1820, sold again to the Foyers, and finally bought back from them by Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 3rd Bt., in 1825. Corriedale, or Corrieacre. This was probably detached from the then adjoining farm of Cult Craigbarnet so that hay could be brought down from the hills which belonged to the Edmonstones to the north. Dumgoyach. This also was included in the charter of the Duchess of Albany to William Edmonstone, 2nd of Duntreath in 1445. The land was at one time divided into small farms together with a mill and mill lands. Two little farms called Capponhill and Shenanend lay to the east of the hill but the whole was converted into one farm during the nineteenth century. Blairquhosh Edmonstone, included Roseyards, is an old holding of the Edmonstones, but not a part of the original Barony. Prior to 1394 it is known to have belonged to Adam Spittal who in that year sold it to his cousin Walter, laird of Buchanan. On 18 November 1488 Sir Archibald Edmonstone of Duntreath obtained the lands of Blairquhosh on the resignation of David Gilchriston, alias Dow of Blairquhosh, for security of ¬£46. Subsequently, in 1493, it was divided into three parts. The deed narrates \\"That the said Archibald Edmonstone and his heirs for ever shall have that east third part near the lands of Duntreath beginning from the burn of Croftelan, descending to the Water of the Blane by the ridge where the oak grows.\\" This oak, known as \\"The Meikle Tree\\", which stood by the roadside at Blairquhosh, was a favourite trysting place both for peaceful purposes and for the assembling of the Strathblane branch of the Clan Buchanan in times of war. It survived as a local landmark until the 1960s when, because it was dying and dangerous, it had to be cut down. The other two thirds of Blairquhosh were somehow acquired by a family called Cunninghame before 1535. \\"Blairquhosh Cunninghame\\" as the land was called, became the property of Lord Napier in 1638. It afterwards belonged to the Buchanans of Carbeth, with whom it remained until 1857 when it was bought by Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 3rd Bt., from John Buchanan of Carbeth. It comprises the farms of Blairquhosh Cunninghame, Burnfoot, and Drummickeich. The Lettre consists of the Temple lands of the Lettre, and the lands called Machar, which, like the Spittal of Ballewan, are believed to have been granted to the Knights Templar by one of the early Earls of Lennox. In 1461 the Commendator of the Torphichen Preceptory gave a charter of the lands to Thomas de Buchanane. In 1614 Thomas Buchanan of Carbeth sold them to Sir William Livingston of Kilsyth, who had a wadset, (security against a loan) of the estate of Duntreath. Then in 1630, when Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 7th of Duntreath, redeemed the loan the lands of the Lettre were included. The matter was completed by a charter from King Charles I, dated 28 June 1632, upon the resignation of William Livingston, erecting in favour of Archibald Edmonstone, the parts of the Barony of Duntreath which were redeemed and the lands of the Lettre (sic) into a free Barony for ever, as in the charter of King James II, 1452, to be held in free blench farm. Previous to this, in 1599, the \\"ten pound lands of Lettre\\" had been bought by Archibald's father, William, 7th of Duntreath, from the Stirlings of Cadder. This land then became the farms of the Westerton, Easterton, Baptiston (or Baptist Town of Lettre) and Middletown. By the beginning of this century however, Middleton had ceased to be a farm and the house was rebuilt and enlarged by Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 5th Bt., for his sister Lady Dunedin. In 1956, on the inheritance of the present laird, his mother Gwendolyn, the dowager Lady Edmonstone, moved into the \\"Lettre Cottage\\", as it then was called, where she lived until she died in 1989. Now, to avoid confusion with the former gardener's cottage which lies immediately to its rear, it has become the \\"Lettre House\\". The Ibert, which according to the authors of \\"The Parish of Killearn\\" means \\"The Sacred Place\\", lies on the western perimeter of the estate. The same source tells us that William Graham, son of the 2nd Earl of Montrose, who became a Canon of Glasgow Cathedral and Rector of Killearn in 1549, had a charter from his father for the lands of Killearn, Ibert and Drumbeg dated 1560. His descendants, the Grahams of Killearn, were Lairds until 1752. The Ibert was then acquired by the Buchanans of Carbeth who sold it to Sir William Edmonstone c.1883. The hill of the Ibert was then included in the Lettre sheep farm while the lower ground until recently, carried a herd of dairy cows. The Ibert House is now the home of Philippa, Sir Archibald's eldest daughter, and her children Louise and Tom. Duntreath Castle itself stands in the floor of the Blane Valley at a height of about 100 feet above sea-level. It was sited originally as a fortress in a place that was easy to defend. The conical wooded hill of Dumgoyach (composed of basalt volcanic rock which survived the erosion of the ice age) stands to the south west. On the opposite side of the valley, the summit of Park Hill has been artificially levelled. Upon these heights at one time sentries must have kept watch and marksmen been posted to mow down approaching foes. Also the Park, due west of the castle, was once so prone to flooding that horses were likely to be bogged. Now thanks to extensive draining by the present laird and his father, this ground is sound enough to be used for equestrian events, but once it proved a deterrent to enemies aimed upon attack. During the time of its existence Duntreath estate has changed in many ways. Houses have been built, woods planted and felled. The Glasgow water supply from Loch Katrine to Mugdock reservoir, was opened by Queen Victoria in 1859, and \\"The Water Track\\", built to facilitate the maintenance of the underground pipes, runs along the eastern side of the Blane Valley. Closely watched by the Home Guard during the last world war, it is now much used by walkers as a link between Blanefield and Killearn. The stretch of railway line, built by the Blane Valley Company between Lennoxtown and Killearn, was opened in 1867. Subsequently it was extended to Aberfoyle but was closed in 1951. Part of it now lies within \\"The West Highland Way\\", along which thousands of people walk each year. == Cadet branches == The Edmonstones of Spittal or Broich. Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 3rd Bt., wrote in 1851 that the cadet branch of Spittal or Broich was the only one then remaining in the male line. Both sides of this family were descended from sons of Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 3rd of Duntreath (see p. 29). For several generations they were hereditary baillies on the Duntreath estate. The name \\"Craigbrock\\" may signify that they lived there, perhaps in an earlier house, while factoring Duntreath estate. The Edmonstones of Cambus-Wallace. This branch of the family, according to Sir Archibald, may have ended with the death of Mr James Edmonstone of Newton, Doune, during the 19th century. Later, however, he mentions in a note that a direct branch of the Cambus-Wallace line was believed to be still living in Biggar, in a house called Cambus-Wallace. This may have been Archibald Edmonstone, who was Captain of Edinburgh High Constables and Major of No 13 Queen's Company Edinburgh. He married Lucy, daughter of Richard Smith of Harescombe Gloucestershire. They had two sons, Francis Richard and Charles Gordon, and one daughter Catherine but later descendants, if any, have not so far been found. This information came from a Miss Lucine Edmonstone, who claimed to be descended from a William Edmonstone, born about 1600, but did not give further details, saying that documents had been lost. The Shetland Family of Edmonston. Andrew Edmonston, a minister of the church, went to live in Shetland during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542‚Äì67). He would seem to have been connected with the senior line of the family. His descendants, their name spelt without the e, still live today in Unst, the most northerly island of Shetland. The National Dictionary of Biography, which gives the spelling Edmondston, (pp396‚Äì8) describes the family as \\"one of the oldest in Shetland\\". Laurence Edmondston, a surgeon in Lerwick, was, for most of his long life, the only medical practitioner in the islands. His eldest son Arthur, M.D. (1776?-1841) who followed his profession, entered the army and served under Sir Ralph Abercromby in Egypt before returning to Lerwick to succeed to his father's practice. He died unmarried in 1841. Laurence Edmondston M.D., the \\"udaller\\" (owner) of Unst (1795-1879) was the youngest brother of the above- mentioned Arthur. Laurence's eldest son, Thomas Edmondston (1825-1846) born at Buness in Unst, became well known as a naturalist and was elected to the professorship of Botany and Natural History in Anderson's \\"University\\" at Glasgow in 1845. But before beginning his lectures he accepted the post of naturalist on board the Herald, ordered to the Pacific and Californian coast. The ship having anchored off the coast of Peru, a boat was sent ashore, but on re-embarking a rifle was accidentally discharged and the ball, passing through Edmondston's head, killed him instantaneously. He was only twenty one. ==Variant spellings== Edmondson, Edmonson, Edminson, Edminston, Edmisten, Edmiston, Edmeston, Edmondon and many more. The spelling of the name from Edmonstone to Edmiston may have been done intentionally by some family members in attempt to differentiate from the Sir James Edmonstone, 6th of Duntreath (1544-1618) who was accused of a handful of nefarious acts. James is also the Laird of Duntreath who mortgaged off Duntreath for some time before it was ultimately reacquired by his grandson, Archibald. The spelling again changed for many American descendants due to scribe error in various census records over the years. ==Castles== Castles that have belonged to the Clan Edmonstone have included amongst many others: * Boyne Castle, in Aberdeenshire. Granted by King David II of Scotland in 1369, passing by marriage to the Ogilvie family, who built the current castle. * Ednam Castle, in Borders. Granted by King Robert II of Scotland in 1390, as a dowry for the marriage of John Edmonstone and Princess Isabella of Scotland. * Culloden Castle, in Highland. Granted by King James II of Scotland in 1455 to William Edmonstone, it was sold to the Strachan family in the 16th century. * Duntreath Castle, in Stirling. Lands granted by King Robert III of Scotland in 1435, as a dowry for the marriage of his grand daughter Princess Mary, daughter of Prince James of Scotland. The castle construction was started in circa 1452. ==Notes and references== http://edmonstone.com ==External links== *Edmonstone of Duntreath Category:Scottish clans Category:Armigerous clans ","title":"Clan Edmonstone"},{"id":"61373346","text":"The Ashangi Basalts are the earliest Tertiary volcanic rocks in north Ethiopia, hence they are in the lowest position. These dark porphyritic basalts are separated from the Mesozoic formations below it by basal conglomerates. The basalts hold phenocrysts that developed before the magma reached the earth surface. These basalts are weathered, partially eroded and have a sub-horizontal stratification, particularly at the lower part. This series was created during the first period of the flood basalt eruptions in north Ethiopia, in the Oligocene. ==Name and definition== The name was coined by geologist William Thomas Blanford, who accompanied the British Expedition to Abyssinia in 1868, after Lake Hashenge in Tigray, which is surrounded by large outcrops of the formation. So far the nomenclature has not been proposed for recognition to the International Commission on Stratigraphy. ==Stratigraphic context== The formation covers Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, particularly Amba Aradam Formation and Adigrat Sandstone. In many places, on its upper side, deposits of intra-volcanic sedimentary rock occur. ==Environment== These volcanic rocks formed through melting of the earth mantle. After magma generation, lava flowed out over the surface, in successive flows. Some part of it disappeared within the next 1 to 3 million years due to weathering and erosion, while other parts remained present. Within the basalt, columnar joints occur as a result of cooling; they are visible along the flanks of the ridges. The columnar joints are perpendicular to the surface of the lava flows; they are mostly vertical, but may also be strongly inclined. The lower succession, the one that overlies the Amba Aradam Formation and the Adigrat Sandstone holds vertical and closely spaced columnar joints.

The first historical information instead dates back to 1121 in a papal bull of Pope Callixtus II. In 1575 Pope Gregory XIII granted the church to the archconfraternity of the Dottrina Cristiana, founded in 1560 by Marco de Sadis Cusani: from the title of the church, the members of the association had the name of \\"Agatists\\".

The series follows international drifting drivers from across the globe competing against each other on one of the largest existing automotive courses. The full season of Hyperdrive, consisting of 10 episodes, was released on August 21, 2019. ==Premise== 28 international competitors drive around a race track and attempt to navigate specific obstacles and perform maneuvers on a custom made \\"Hyperdrive\\" course. Throughout the season, the number of competitors is whittled down until there are six competitors remaining; the competitor who outlasts all others is declared the Hyperdrive champion. ===Format=== The Hyperdrive course is a drifting course that includes a variable number of obstacles, each of which must be completed in the correct manner. Each obstacle has a series of targets that must be hit or a series of fixed elements that must be avoided. Time penalties are incurred for violating the obstacle's rules (e.g. not completing it within the time limit) or hitting a target in an illegal manner (which includes missing a target). The competition consists of a preliminary qualification round, a series of knockout rounds, and a final round. The first four episodes are qualifying rounds with ten or twelve competitors competing per episode; there are five or six obstacles on the course. The three competitors with the fastest times in each of the first three episodes automatically advance to the knockout round, while the three competitors with the slowest times are eliminated, including any competitors that did not finish. For the next three episodes, another group of four to six new competitors replaced any competitors who had advanced or were eliminated, and they compete against the six competitors who finished between fourth and ninth place in the previous episode; this continues until all twelve qualification spots are filled. A total of twelve competitors compete in the knockout rounds, where the difficulty of each obstacle is increased. In the first three knockout rounds, the number of competitors is reduced by two; the competitor having the slowest time is relegated to the wild-card round. The two competitors who are ranked just above the slowest competitor have to compete in a head to head race against each other; the competitor who finishes first in the race automatically advances to the next round. The five competitors who did not qualify for the fourth knockout round compete in the wild-card round, with the winner of the final head to head race in that round reentering the competition; the four competitors who lose their head to head races are eliminated. The fourth and fifth knockout rounds are played similarly to the previous three rounds (albeit with an increased amount of obstacles), but the loser of the head to head race is eliminated; this process continues until six competitors remain. In the final round, the six competitors who had advanced from the fifth knockout round compete against each other in a course that has nine obstacles. The competitor who posts the fastest time in this round is declared the winner of the competition. ==Personnel== The show is hosted by Michael Bisping, Lindsay Czarniak, Mike Hill and Rutledge Wood. Notable drivers in the series included Americans Brittany Williams, Fielding Shredder, Jordan Martin, and Sara Haro, Brazilians Jo√£o Barion and Diego Higa, French stunt driver Axel Fran√ßois, a Queen of Europe - Karolina Pilarczyk, a German husband-and-wife team consisting of Alexander and Corinna Gr√§ff, and Japanese competitors Kisaragi Awano and Atsushi Taniguchi.

Three (fantails) above symbolise the Trinity. The informal flower image represents youth. TƒÅrore holds a copy of the Gospel of Luke in te reo MƒÅori. The words around her head translate from te reo as \\"Peace be with you\\". Below is the tree of life, a Joshua Tree. TƒÅrore (?1824‚Äì1836) was the daughter of Wiremu NgƒÅkuku, a (chief) of the MƒÅori (tribe) NgƒÅti HauƒÅ in the North Island of New Zealand. She was considered a child prodigy, a Christian martyr and her story is treasured by the New Zealand church. ==Ministry== TƒÅrore was taught to read from the (MƒÅori language) Gospel of Luke, from the Bible, by Charlotte Brown of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) from the age of ten. She was considered a prodigy because of her ability to memorise much of the book. She would recite portions of the Gospel to crowds of 200‚Äì300 of her people and was supported by her father as a lay evangelist. ==Murder== In October 1836, TƒÅrore was evacuated with the other pupils from her CMS school in Matamata, because of a violent and cannibalistic conflict between iwi. She took her father's rare te reo MƒÅori Gospel of Luke in a small (basket) she wore around her neck. Whilst stopped for the night of 18 October near the Wairere Falls in the Kaimai Ranges, her party of 24, including her peace- loving father, was attacked by a NgƒÅti Whakaue war party from Rotorua, TƒÅrore was murdered and the book stolen by warrior Paora Te Uita. Her ritualistically mutilated body was carried back to the Matamata mission station and was given a Christian burial. The MƒÅori law of required revenge for her death, but at her (funeral) her Christian father spoke words of forgiveness and said \\"do not rise up to obtain satisfaction for her. God will do that.\\" ==Aftermath== Several weeks later, back in Rotorua, Uita asked visiting ex-slave, mission school educated Ripahau (aka Matahau) of NgƒÅti Raukawa to explain the book to him. This led him to become a Christian and to ask for forgiveness from NgƒÅkuku, leading to their reconciliation. The book, identified by Ngakuku's inscribed name, was then taken south and ended up in the hands of Ripahau again in ≈åtaki. It continued to play a key role in MƒÅori evangelising to MƒÅori for years to come, including the introduction of the Gospel to the South Island for the first time. ==Legacy== TƒÅrore's grave was located in 1976 at the Matamata (fortification) site near the village of Waharoa, and the following year a white cross headstone and plaque were created to commemorate her death, her father's forgiveness and the spread of Christianity through New Zealand that was influenced by her book. In 1997, The Legend of Tarore documentary was broadcast on New Zealand national television.

Oligocolius is known from two species, the type species O. brevitarsus and O. psittacocephalon. Oligocolius is a member of the family of modern mousebirds (Coliidae) and is broadly similar to them in shape. However, unlike modern mouse birds the skull and beak of Oligocolius closely resembles those of parrots, and appears to be specialised for a distinct lifestyle not found in living mousebirds. ==Discovery== The first specimen of Oligocolius was discovered in a clay pit at Frauenweiler, near Wiesloch in Germany, dated to the Rupelian approximately 32 million years ago during the early Oligocene from which its name derives. The specimen was described and named by palaeontologist Gerald Mayr in 2000, included much of the skeleton, but was disarticulated and missing its skull, as well as most of both its left wing and foot. The species was named O. brevitarsus for the unusually short length of its foot (from Latin brevis, short). A second specimen was later described by Mayr in 2013 from the late Oligocene (24.7 Ma) lagerst√§tte in Enspel (an ancient maar lake) near Bad Marienberg, Germany. Compared to the first specimen, this specimen was nearly complete (missing only the pygostyle of the tail) and was fully articulated. Although referable to Oligocolius, the two specimens could be distinguished by differing limb proportions, and so the new specimen was assigned its own species, O. psittacocephalon. The species was named for the distinctive parrot-like skull present in the specimen (from the Greek psittakos and cephalon). Oligocolius is the only coliid known from the Oligocene and is the most complete Paleogene coliid known, however, it is more unlike modern mousebirds than some older Eocene forms (such as Primocolius and Palaeospiza). Oligocolius demonstrates then that fossil coliids occupied a much more diverse range of lifestyles than those represented today. ==Description== Oligocolius was similar in size to living mousebirds (such as the speckled mousebird) with a superficially similar shape, as well as derived traits of the skeleton that ally it closely with living coliids. Like living mousebirds, it had a short, rounded skull with a short beak, short legs and presumably pamprodactyl feet. However, it is noticeably distinct in both the design of its skull and the proportions of its limbs. The skull of Oligocolius is remarkably parrot-like, particularly due to the broad intertemporal region between the eyes and the shape of the beak. The upper beak is deep and rounded, as well as possibly hooked at the tip, compared to the short finch- like beaks of modern mousebirds. The mandible has a particularly long retroarticular process, where the muscle for opening the jaws attaches to at the back of the lower jaw. The length of this bone would have provided Oligocolius with an increased gape compared to modern mousebirds. Furthermore, the beak is attached to the cranium by a hinge between the nasal bones and the frontals, meaning the upper beak was freely mobile like those of parrots and toucans. However, the combination of the long retroarticular process and the nasofrontal hinge is only found in parrots and Oligocolius, suggesting they share a similar degree of cranial kinesis. In addition to the parrot-like skull, Oligocolius also has notably shorter feet and longer wings than modern mousebirds. Particularly, the ulna and carpometacarpus of the hand are distinctly longer than those of modern mousebirds. The tarsometatarsus of the foot is much shorter than in any other known coliiform, much shorter than the humerus and ulna and only slightly longer than the carpometacarpus. The phalanx bones of the toes are shortened as in modern mousebirds, but uniquely the first phalanges of the forward pointing toes are all equally shortened. The fourth toe was capable of reversing as in modern mousebirds, and it was presumably pamprodactyl. It is unknown if Oligocolius had the characteristic long tail feathers of other mousebirds, however O. brevitarsus has a very well-developed pygostyle to suggest so. ==Palaeobiology== O. psittacocephalon was found with many fruit stones inside its body, mostly in a cluster beneath the skull and a few within the body cavity. The size of the stones are about as large as the biggest fruits swallowed by living mousebirds (0.5 mm) and are completely intact, indicating that Oligocolius not only consumed larger fruits than living mousebirds but that it also swallowed them whole. The flexibility of the short upper beak was likely a specialisation for eating such large food items, as it is in modern parrots. The presence of a crop in Oligocolius implies that it was feeding on fruits and vegetation that was tougher to digest than those in the diet of living mousebirds. Because the crop is absent in living mousebirds, and that mousebirds are not closely related to other birds with crops (such as the hoatzin and raptors), it is inferred that the crop was evolved independently in at least Oligocolius amongst mousebirds. The longer and more strongly developed wings of Oligocolius would have allowed it to fly for longer distances than living mousebird, while the shorter feet imply it was less competent on the ground than modern mousebirds. Oligocolius likely spent more time in the trees than living mousebirds, and was capable of dispersing more easily than other coliids. It's possible that unusual adaptations of Oligocolius were a response to a period of cooling climate in Europe between the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and the Miocene Climatic Optimum, although this is uncertain. ==References== * Category:Coliiformes Category:Paleogene birds of Europe Category:Oligocene birds ","title":"Oligocolius"},{"id":"61374018","text":"Prince Frederick Charles John Frederick, Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt Johann Ernst Heinsius (21 May 1731, Ilmenau - 18 October 1794, Erfurt) was a German portrait painter and miniaturist. == Biography == His father was Johann Christian Heintz (c.1706-1756), a gunsmith who had become an artist at the court of Rudolstadt. In addition to his father, he may have studied with Carl Christlieb Reinthaler (?-1770), a local decorative painter. He made his name as a portrait painter working for several noblemen of Thuringia. His presence is testified to in Heidecksburg, Rudolstadt and in Hildburghausen as well, until 1769 when his patron, Duke Ernst Frederick III, was compelled to declare bankruptcy. In 1772, he was engaged to oversee the picture gallery at Castle Wilhelmsburg in Weimar, but lost this position in 1774 when the castle burned down and the collection was destroyed. After the arrival of Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, who was still just a boy, he was occasionally employed by Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, the Grand Duke's mother. His portraits of them are among his best known, although some are reworkings of portraits by Johann Georg Ziesenis. Sometime during this period, he also created a portrait of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Despite this limited success, his work in Weimar was always dogged by illnesses in the family, debt, and clinging relatives. In 1781, the Grand Duke granted him a three-year leave of absence, during which he was mostly resident in Hamburg, working for the wealthy bourgeoisie. His best known work from this period was a portrait of , the wife of Georg Heinrich Sieveking. When he returned to Weimar, he found that his family had squandered all of the money he had sent them. They apparently remained in this destitute state until 1788, when Georg Melchior Kraus helped him obtain a teaching position at the Weimar Princely Free Drawing School. He was temporarily disabled by a stroke in 1792. Upon recovering, he went to Erfurt to carry out a commission, but died there in 1794. His brother, Johann Julius Heinsius, also became a painter and emigrated to France. Their styles are similar and they are often confused.

UserLAnd also provides a program library of popular free and open-source Linux-based programs to which additional programs and different versions of programs can be added. ==Overview== Unlike other Linux compatibility layer mobile apps, UserLAnd does not require a root account. UserLAnd's ability to function without root directories, also known as \\"rooting,\\" avoids \\"bricking\\" or the non-functionality of the mobile device while the Linux program is in use, which in addition to making the mobile device non-functional may void the device's warranty. Furthermore, the requirement of programs other than UserLAnd to \\"root\\" your mobile device has proven a formidable challenge for inexperienced Linux users. A prior application, GNURoot Debian, attempted to similarly run Linux programs on mobile devices, but it has ceased to be maintained and, therefore, is no longer operational. UserLAnd allows those with a mobile device to run Linux programs, many of which aren't available as mobile apps. Even for those Linux applications, e.g. Firefox, which have mobile versions available, people often find that their user experience with these mobile versions pales in comparison with their desktop. UserLAnd allows its users to recreate that desktop experience on their mobile device. UserLAnd currently only operates on Android mobile devices. UserLAnd is available for download on Google Play and F-Droid. ==Operation== To use UserLAnd, one must first download-typically from F-Droid or the Google Play Store-the application and then install it. Once installed, a user selects an app to open. When a program is selected, the user is prompted to enter login information and select a connection type. Following this, the user gains access to their selected program. ==Program library== UserLAnd is pre-loaded with the distributions Alpine, Arch, Debian, Kali, and Ubuntu; the web browser Firefox; the desktop environments LXDE and Xfce; the deployment environments Git and IDLE; the text-based games Colossal Cave Adventure and Zork; the numerical computing programs gnuplot, GNU Octave and R; the office suite LibreOffice; and the graphics editors GIMP and Inkscape. Further Linux programs and different versions of programs may be added to this program library. ==Reception== A review on Slant.co listed UserLAnd's \\"Pro's\\": support for VNC X sessions, no \\"rooting\\" required, easy setup, and that it's free and open-source; and \\"Con's\\": its lack of support for Lollipop and the difficulty of use for non-technical users. On the contrary, OS Journal found that the lack of a need to \\"root\\" your mobile device made using UserLAnd considerably easier than Linux compatibility layer applications, a position shared with SlashGear's review of UserLAnd. OS Journal went on to state that with UserLAnd one could do \\"almost anything\\" and \\"you‚Äôre (only) limited by your insanity\\" with respect to what you can do with the application. Linux Journal stated that \\"UserLAnd offers a quick and easy way to run an entire Linux distribution, or even just a Linux application or game, from your pocket.\\" SlashGear stated that UserLAnd is \\"absolutely super simple to use and requires little to no technical knowledge to get off the ground running.\\" ==See also== * OS virtualization and emulation on Android ==References== Category:2018 software Category:Android emulation software Category:Compatibility layers Category:Computing platforms Category:Cross- platform software Category:Free software programmed in Java (programming language) Category:Free system software Category:Linux APIs Category:Linux emulation software Category:Wine (software) ","title":"UserLAnd Technologies"},{"id":"61374442","text":"Jerome Alan Danzig (February 7, 1913 ‚Äì July 15, 2001) was an American reporter, news producer, and top adviser to New York Governor Nelson A.

Music writer Scot Miller described the song as being \\"closely based on \\"Eddie, My Love\\"\\", while \\"also slyly parodying\\" \\"I Met Him on a Sunday\\" by the Shirelles and \\"Be My Baby\\" by Ronnie Spector. Miller states: ==Recording history== The song appeared on the 1972 soundtrack of the musical, and was later recorded by Cindy Bullens for Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture. On the 2007 revival album, Grease: The New Broadway Cast Recording, the song is performed with Robyn Hurder in the lead, backed by Lindsay Mendez, Kirsten Wyatt, and Jenny Powers. In the musical, the song is performed in the first act, when the character Marty, one of the Pink Ladies, tells about her long- distance courtship with a Marine named Freddy; it is implied that she only maintains this relationship because of the lavish gifts he sends her from Japan. One early review described the tone of the song as \\"mocking\\", contrasted with the sentimentality of \\"Summer Nights\\" and the contagious excitement of \\"Born to Hand Jive\\",William Glover, \\"Early Rock 'n' Roll Comes On Uproariously in 'Grease'\\", The Daily Register (February 15, 1972), p. 10. while another singled it out as one of the outstanding numbers in the musical,Jack Gaver, \\"'Grease' Show Recalls Era of Rock and Roll\\", The Times (February 16, 1972), p. 7-B. and another identified it as \\"one of the tuneful rock numbers of the era\\", and describing the scene introducing the song as \\"one of the highlights of the first act\\".\\"Jack Meredith, \\"Vintage rock, fun as Grease revives moods of the 50s\\", The Windsor Star (April 24, 1973), p. 21 \\"Freddy My Love\\" was not included in the 1978 film Grease, although it is listed in the end credits and included on the soundtrack along \\"Alone at a Drive-in Movie (instrumental)\\" and \\"Mooning\\", which are also songs from the musical not present in the film.

Emulations of the original Jupiter-8 sounds were later released as a software instrument for both keyboards on Roland Axial as part of the Synth Legends series.http://axial.roland.com/articles/jupiter-80-synth-legends/ The Jupiter-50 is a multitimbral synthesizer oriented to stage and live use. That's why it has 3 parts (Upper, Solo, Percussion/Lower). Its inventors prefer to use the term Live Sets which are used to combine different tones from the collection of 1,500 in order to create a multitimbral sound and control it in real-time. The maximum count of Live Sets is 2,560. The Jupiter-50 utilizes MIDI control, D-Beam Control, a USB connection with MIDI implementation and audio interface functionality, and a USB song player/recorder that's compatible with WAV, AIFF, and MP3 audio file formats. ==Keyboard and controls== The Jupiter-50 is equipped with a 76-note/6 octave velocity-sensitive keyboard (no aftertouch). The front panel contains a large quantity of controls - including encoders, buttons, and sliders - but cannot be considered a \\"one knob - one function\\" interface, as controls may share functionality in different modes. Pitch/mod controls are combined via Roland's traditional lever. ==Size and weight== The concept was to create a travel- friendly version of the expensive and heavy Jupiter-80. The Jupiter-50 is indeed much more portable being more compact (127 cm wide) and weighing only 11 kg.

Hercules was a porter for the Indonesian army during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. Once moved to Jakarta, he formed his own preman gang in the Tanah Abang district, ruling the Jakartan criminal underworld during the 1990s. Today, Hercules retains a celebrity status as a fearsome gangster, occasionally appearing on TV programs as well as tabloid magazines. He is also notable for his political ties with the 2014 and 2019 Indonesian presidential election candidate Prabowo Subianto. ==Biography== Rosario was born in the 1960s in the Portuguese Timor, growing up during the chaotic era in the backdrop of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor (1975‚Äî1976) and the subsequent occupation by the Indonesian national army.Kisah Klasik Hercules, Tentara, dan Preman.

Boombastis. Retrieved July 27, 2019. He was then orphaned in 1978 after his parents were killed in a bombing hitting the town of Ainaro. Since then, he was incorporated as a courier who provides logistical assistance to the special forces Kopassus under the Tenaga Bantuan Operasi (TBO) program.Wilson, Ian. (2014). The perils of loyalty. New Mandala. Retrieved July 27, 2019. \\"Hercules\\" was a code name given to Rosario by the Kopassus' radio communication team. During his year as a TBO personnel, Hercules was being involved in a skirmish with the Falintil pro-independence resistance. His helicopter crashed during the fighting, leading to him losing his right eye and right hand. Hercules was then taken to Gatot Subroto army hospital in Jakarta for operation. Hercules thanked Prabowo Subianto, who was serving a commander of Nanggala commando units, for the support he received during this time. Hercules is known for having \\"unwavering\\" loyalty toward Prabowo since then. Since the late 1980s, Hercules settled in Jakarta along with several East Timorese youths, given a job of electrical parts engineer. He soon abandoned the job, moving to the commercial district of Tanah Abang after switching jobs. After settling in Tanah Abang, he formed a preman gang along with the fellow Timorese migrants, including Logo Vallenberg and Alfredo Monteiro Pires. He then immediately succeed to build his enterprise through racketeering and pimping businesses. He also carried out political extortion on behalf of the Indonesian army, to weed out and intimidate pro-independence Timorese movements in Jakarta. His preman empire collapsed in the late 1990s after some of the members of the Hercules gang refused to participate in the pro-integration rally. Since then, his gang lost military protection, and Prabowo allowed other preman gangs to take over Tanah Abang underground. He was dethroned after brutal fighting against Betawi and Madurese gangs, led by figures such as Bang Ucu and Abraham Lunggana. After being overthrown from the Tanah Abang underworld, he rebuilt his reputation through debt collecting and security businesses. He owned multiple lands as well as agricultural and fishery businesses, turning him into akin to philanthropist figure. He was a respected figure among the migrants from East Indonesia, providing newcomers jobs, networks as well and protections. He remained in rivalry against other organized crime figures as well, including John Kei and Basri Sangaji. Since 2008, Prabowo reapproached Hercules after founding the Great Indonesia Movement (Gerindra) Party. A social organization called the Peoples Movement for a New Indonesia (GRIB) was established in 2011 by Hercules to mobilize his network of preman gangsters, local strongmen, religious vigilante groups, and ex-militia for the grassroots level political support toward Prabowo. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Indonesian Muslims Category:Indonesian occupation of East Timor Category:Indonesian people of East Timorese descent Category:21st-century criminals Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Hercules (gangster)"},{"id":"61375018","text":"Teegarden's Star c (also known as Teegarden c) is a candidate exoplanet found orbiting in the habitable zone of Teegarden's Star, an M-type red dwarf star around 12 light years away from the Solar System. It orbits in a conservative habitable zone around its star. It is fourth closest potentially habitable exoplanet as of July 2019. == Discovery == It was discovered in June 2019. == Characteristics == Teegarden's Star c is the outermost known planet of the system. It has orbital period of 11.4 days. The minimum mass of the planet is one Earth mass, and radius is probably Earth-like, suggesting an Earth-like composition, with iron core and rocky crust. Teegarden's Star c probably has an ocean of water on surface, or ice because of temperatures. == Habitability == Ross 128, an example of quiet red dwarf that can support habitable planets, like Teegarden's Star. Kepler-438, an example for active red dwarf with powerful flares that can strip the atmosphere from a planet, making it uninhabitable. Teegarden c orbits in the conservative habitable zone. The equilibrium temperature for the planet is ‚àí47 ¬∞C., but if the planet has a thick atmosphere, its surface could be much warmer. Earth's equilibrium temperature is ‚àí18 ¬∞C, but our atmosphere maintains temperatures well above that. It has an Earth Similarity Index (ESI) of 0.68. One positive factor for habitability is its star. Most red dwarfs emit strong flares, which can strip the atmosphere and eliminate habitability. A good example is Kepler-438b, which has an ESI score of 0.88, but because its sun is an active star it is likely uninhabitable. Another example is Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the sun. Teegarden's Star is inactive and quiet, making the planet possibly habitable. Other quiet red dwarfs with potentially habitable exoplanets are Ross 128 and Luyten's Star. == Host star == Teegarden's Star is an ultra-cool red dwarf at around 9 percent the mass of the Sun with a temperature of around 2,900 Kelvin (2,623 ¬∞C or 4,760 F). The inherent low temperatures of such objects explain why it was not discovered earlier, since it has an apparent magnitude of only 15.1 (and an absolute magnitude of 17.22). Like most red and brown dwarfs it emits most of its energy in the infrared spectrum. It is older than the Sun, with an age of 8 billion years. It was discovered in 2003. Astronomers have long thought it was quite likely that many undiscovered dwarf stars exist within 20 light-years of Earth, because stellar-population surveys show the count of known nearby dwarf stars to be lower than otherwise expected and these stars are dim and easily overlooked. Teegarden's team thought that these dim stars might be found by data mining some of the huge optical sky survey data sets taken by various programs for other purposes in previous years. They reexamined the NEAT asteroid tracking data set and found this star. The star was then located on photographic plates from the Palomar Sky Survey taken in 1951. This discovery is significant as the team did not have direct access to any telescopes and did not include professional astronomers at the time of the discovery. The parallax was initially measured as 0.43 ¬± 0.13 arcseconds. This would have placed its distance at only 7.50 light-years, making Teegarden's Star only the third star system in order of distance from the Sun, ranking between Barnard's Star and Wolf 359. However, even at that time the anomalous low luminosity (the absolute magnitude would have been 18.5) and high uncertainty in the parallax suggested that it was in fact somewhat farther away, still one of the Sun's nearest neighbors but not nearly as high in the ranking in order of distance. A more accurate parallax measurement of 0.2593 arcseconds was made by George Gatewood in 2009, yielding the now accepted distance of 12.578 light-years. == References  Further reading == Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2019 Category:Aries (constellation) ","title":"Teegarden's Star c"},{"id":"61375020","text":"Carpena, C√°rpena or Carpe√±a is a Spanish surname of Italian origin.

Venier brought the find to the Museo Friulano di Storia Naturale at Udine. After partial preparation paleontologist Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia announced the discovery in the scientific literature in 2000.Dalla Vecchia F.M. 2000. \\"A wing phalanx of a large basal pterosaur (Diapsida, Pterosauria) from the Norian (Late Triassic) of NE Italy\\". Bollettino della Societ√† Paleontologica Italiana 39(2): 229‚Äì234 In 2003, Dalla Vecchia referred the specimen to Eudimorphodon.Dalla Vecchia F.M. 2003. \\"New morphological observations on Triassic pterosaurs\\". In: Buffetaut E, Mazin J-M, eds. Evolution and Palaeobiology of Pterosaurs. Vol. 217. London: Geological Society London, Special Publication, p 23‚Äì44 In 2009 however, further preparation made him conclude that it was a species new to science, not identical to either Eudimorphodon or Carniadactylus.Dalla Vecchia F.M. 2009. \\"Anatomy and systematics of the pterosaur Carniadactylus gen. n. rosenfeldi (Dalla Vecchia, 1995)\\". Rivista Italiana di Paleontologia e Stratigrafia 115(2): 159‚Äì186 In 2019, Dalla Vecchia named and described the type species Seazzadactylus venieri. The generic name combines that of the Seazza with the Greek daktylos, \\"finger\\". The specific name honours Venier as discoverer. The holotype, MFSN 21545, was found in a layer of the Dolomia di Forni Formation dating from the middle to upper Norian. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull and lower jaws. The skeleton is not articulated but the bones are in close association. It lacks the tail and most feet bones. It represents a subadult individual, not fully grown. ==Description== Reconstructed skull Dalla Vecchia established a number of apomorphic traits. In the praemaxilla the teeth are limited to the front half of the body. The jugal bone has a high front branch, tapering to the front and below into a sharp needle-like point. The main body of the jugal bone is pierced in the middle by a large foramen. The front branch of the pterygoid bone makes a right angle to the outer side. The ectopterygoid bone is positioned behind the pterygoid and has a recurved outer side branch in the direction of the jugal as well as a rear branch. Teeth in the maxilla and the dentary bone possess multiple cusps, sometimes as high as six or seven, while erupted teeth with three cusps are absent. The first, second and third maxillary teeth are recurved, with the curvature gradually diminishing along the series. The shoulder blade is fan-like expanded to the rear. The pteroid bone is small and slender, formed like an exclamation mark. ==Phylogeny== Seazzadactylus was placed in the Pterosauria in 2019, in a basal position outside of the Monofenestrata. A cladistic analysis showed it was part of a yet unnanmed clade also containing Arcticodactylus, Austriadraco, Carniadactylus, Raeticodactylus and Caviramus. In the evolutionary tree Seazzadactylus would be positioned directly above Austriadraco and below Carniadactylus. Eudimorphodon was not recovered as a close relative but in a more derived position instead, under Campylognathoides. ==See also== * Timeline of pterosaur research ==Notes== Category:Late Triassic pterosaurs of Europe Category:Fossil taxa described in 2019 ","title":"Seazzadactylus"},{"id":"61375044","text":"Illya Putrya (; born 15 May 1998) is a professional Ukrainian football midfielder who plays for Chornomorets Odesa. ==Career== Putrya is a product of Azovstal Mariupol and Shakhtar Donetsk sportive school systems.

Khanna was the first alumni of IMA alumni to be appointed Commandant. Following a recommendation in 1983 by the Ministry of Defence the need was felt that cadets needed to know about application of science in weaponry. Lt Gen Mathew Thomas and all following commandants took note of these changes and implemented them. Lt Gen M Thomas also suggested a change in syllabus, proposing new computer focused teaching methods as well as further emphasis on advanced training. This included sending cadets to the High Altitude Warfare School and the Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School among other things. Commandant Lt Gen Himmeth Singh appreciated the difficulties of modern warfare, but emphasized the human factor.

Twelve Forever premiered in the United States on Netflix on July 29, 2019. The original pilot was produced for Cartoon Network, by Cartoon Network Studios, and was originally released on their website on May 18, 2015. In December 2017, it was announced that Netflix had acquired the rights to Twelve Forever for a full series, with production duties being handled by The Cartel and Puny Entertainment. Shadi Petosky began working on the show sometime before July 2017, when she hoped for more episodes of Danger & Eggs. One of the executive producers of the series, Petosky, described Reggie as a queer character \\"coming to terms with her sexuality\\". The series also features a number of other LGBTQ characters: Mack and Beefhouse, a couple in the fantasy world of Endless Island, and Galaxander, who previously had a boyfriend. Ultimately, the series ended after its first season with no further plans to continue it, as noted by Petosky in a tweet. As such, GLAAD recognized the series as one of those shows released in 2019 with LGBTQ representation. ==Premise== The series centers on Reggie Abbott (Kelsy Abbott), an imaginative 12-year-old whose desire to remain a child is so powerful she can enter another world in which she never has to grow up: an island called Endless where her childhood toys and drawings are real. She is joined by her friends Todd (Antony Del Rio) and Esther Hopkins (Jaylen Barron), who visit this amazing world to live out their superhero fantasies and escape the responsibilities of impending adulthood. Life and reality often catch up with them in Endless as the preteens start dealing with growing pains and conflicts develop between them. The negativity the friends experience while dealing with their new complicated problems feed their enemy, the nefarious Butt Witch (Matt Berry), who seeks to destroy Endless. ==Voice cast== * Kelsy Abbott as Reggie, Wade, Kathy, Flaps, Flowery Woman, Billy Canyon, Tammy, Dr. Tenders, Swimple Jan, Plates, Mike, Omelet, Winged Moyse * Antony Del Rio as Todd, Chairold, Garrett, Sherbert * Jaylen Barron as Esther, Pretty Please, Tater Tot, Gorbis, Darla, Tori * Matt Berry as The Butt Witch * Steve Agee as Big Deal, Mack, Beefhouse, Galaxander, Hunk, Monster Brown Roger * Wade Randolph as Borbo, Dr. Champion, Mr. Christopherson, Label Maker Monster, Lump, Uncle Paul, AJ, Bobby * Laura Zak as Mrs. Krandle, Tanopy, Explorer Sally, Pancake, Rooty, Lorbis, Queen Limerick * Bridget Everett as Judy * Spencer Rothbell as Colin, Swimple Dan, Tasty Troy, Pitui-Terry, Squad Bro, Rance, Big Ol' Gordon, Jacques Board, Shaun * Nick Sumida as Bags of Marbles, Beth, Chewing Gum Stanley, Garrett, Se√±or Corduroy * Brandon Wardell as Dustin * Daniel Amerman as Aaron * Sam Brown as Manny, Schmaaron * Noel Fielding as Guy Pleasant * Kate Freund as Donna * John Eric Bentley as Mr. Kapusinski * Ron Funches as Manguin * Brittany Ashley as Kendra, Leslie * Amy Sedaris as Sadmantha * Maximus Riegel as Ogden * Stephanie Beatriz as Conelly * Chris Fleming as Mr. Fleming * Ashley Boettcher as Gwen * Curt Neill as Rodney * Paul Williams as Captain Elmer * Reese Hartwig as Shane (Pilot only) * Jorge Diaz as Tristan (Pilot only) ==Episodes Cartoon Network pilot (2015)= Season 1 (2019) =Reception== There have been a variety of reviews. Lacey Womack of ScreenRant praised the series while others praised the \\"great pedigree\\" of those working on the show. While some described the show as having a \\"sense of its Midwest, small town setting as the backdrop of conformist pressure\\" and compared it to Gravity Falls, and praised its LGBTQ representation, putting it alongside shows such as Steven Universe, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, The Dragon Prince, and OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes. At the same time, The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction contributor Steven Pearce gave a short positive review of the show, arguing that the show juggles dark and light, the real world and the imagined world, with Endless acting out \\"metaphorical versions of Reggie's real-world problems.\\" Pearce also argued that the series is good and inventive, bringing in surrealism, \\"pre-teen angst, humour and twelve year-olds using flame- throwers.\\" In January 2020, GLAAD nominated the show for its Outstanding Kids & Family Programming award, along with a host of other shows. ==Controversy, cancellation, and possibility of a second season== In September 2019, a Tumblr post from 2010 by Julia Vickerman, the show's creator and executive producer, was revealed which seemed to talk about self-described pedophilia involving a 14-year-old boy, putting the show in jeopardy. The same month, Shadi Petosky announced that the show had been cancelled in a now-deleted tweet, but did not mention the controversy around Vickerman. While Petosky was described as the executive producer on the show in a July 2019 AP article on LGBTQ representation in animation, she stated in September 2019 that she had no connection with the show since the show's first season had premiered on Netflix earlier that year.

In 1857, the British Association came to the conclusion that it would be a suitable project for the Royal Society to undertake.

It primarily focuses on social and political issues in Hong Kong. Stand News was ranked highest in credibility among online news media in Hong Kong in two public opinion surveys conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2016 and 2019. == Background == Stand News was founded after the closure of House News in July 2014. Instead of running the website as a limited company like House News, the owner company of the website, Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Limited, is legally managed by a trust company, while prohibiting any transfer of shares. == Incidents == Yuen Long. === Legal dispute with former Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying === On 24 August, 2018, former Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying filed for defamation against university professor Chung Kim-wah and Stand News in the High Court, alleging that an article in the website associated Leung with the triads is false. The article reported a dinner between Leung‚Äôs aides and alleged triad members. Chung responded that he would not retract the article, while Stand News chief editor Chung Pui-kuen stated that he does not believe that the article defamed Leung, and also invited Leung to write an article to Stand News. === Incidents during the 2019 Hong Kong protests === During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, Stand News have become a target of the pro-Beijing camp and the Hong Kong Police Force. On 21 July 2019, in the Yuen Long attack, reporter Gwyneth Ho was attacked during her live-stream report by triad members against the protesters. When the attackers were attacking commuters in the train station, some members turned to attack Ho. She was knocked over and hit by sticks and wooden batons while she continued filming. The news website later reported that she was taken to the hospital for treatment and received stitches. In 20 December 2019, there was a shooting incident in Jade Plaza in Tai Po. During the reporting of the incident, a policeman hit a Stand News reporter's hands and mobile phone six times with a baton. A few other reporters were attacked by police using pepper spray. Hong Kong Journalists Association condemned the attack and intentional provocation by the Hong Kong Police. Senior journalist Yau Ching-Yuen alleged that the police might have known that the victim reporter was working for the Stand News and thus intentionally aimed at the reporter. On 24 December 2019, a reporter of Stand News, including the recording equipment, was attacked by the police using pepper spray.

Its fossil remains were found as stomach contents of a Microraptor fossil specimen found in the Liaoning province, China in 2003. It was found by a team of paleontologists led by Professor Jingmai O'Connor from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), together with researchers from the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature. The stomach content of the Microraptor was not recognised by scientists when it was first uncovered. On further examination by scientists in 2019, the Microraptor stomach contents were revealed to contain the fully swallowed remains of a previously unknown lizard species. Following this, the new species was formally described and named in 2019. The species was named after Prof. Wang Yuan of IVPP, also the director of the Paleozoological Museum of China at the time of identification of the species and an expert on the paleoherpetofauna of China. The name Indrasaurus was inspired by a Vedic legend in which god Indra was swallowed by the dragon Vritra during a great battle (the dragon in the legend being equated with the Microraptor specimen that had swallowed the lizard specimen). == References == Category:Lizards Category:Fossil taxa described in 2019 ","title":"Indrasaurus"},{"id":"61376262","text":"Ravi Kant Garg is a leader of Bharatiya Janata Party Garg is a former member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly representing Mathura (Assembly constituency) .

The complex was first reported in 1841, and its chemistry has been revisited many times, particularly in relation to the isomerisation reaction between the cis and trans forms which was first reported in 1890. All forms are blue solids, with varying degrees of water solubility. A practical application of the compound is as a source of dietary copper in animal feeds. == Structure == Like most amino acid complexes, the glycinate forms a 5-membered chelate ring, with the glycinato ligand serving as a bidentate (Œ∫2Œü,Œù) species. The chelating ligands assume a square planar configuration around the copper atom as is common for tetracoordinate d9 complexes, calculated to be much lower in energy than the alternative tetrahedral arrangement. === Cis and trans isomerism === The unsymmetric nature of the ligand and square planar coordination thereof gives rise to two possible geometric isomers: a cis and a trans form. Multiple ways of differentiating the geometric isomers exist, an easily accesible one being IR spectroscopy with the characteristic number of C‚ÄìN, C‚ÄìO, and CuII‚ÄìN identifying the ligand configuration. Crystal appearance may also be of some value for isomer indication, though the ultimate diagnostic technique is X-ray crystallography. All forms of the complex have been characterized crystallographically, the most commonly isolated one being the cis monohydrate (x = 1). == Synthesis == A typical preparation of bis(glycinato)copper(II) (proceeding through a non- redox dissociative substitution mechanism) involves the heating of a copper(II) acetate solution in 1:1 aqueous ethanol, followed by the addition of aqueous glycine solution. The precipitate collected upon cooling is identified as the cis isomer when prepared in this manner; isomerisation to the trans form occurs at higher temperatures via a ring-twisting mechanism. ==References== Category:Coordination chemistry Category:Copper complexes Category:Glycinates ","title":"Copper(II) glycinate"},{"id":"61376287","text":"Hanna Grages (8 December 1922 - 27 August 2010) was a German gymnast.

It was decided that gender discrimination in the judiciary would be easier to combat with the forming of an international alliance. In October 1991, women judges in 15 countries approved the inaugural constitution of the IAWJ. Its first meeting was held in October 1992, bringing together 82 judges from 42 different countries in San Diego. The issue that interested them most was family violence. Female judges sponsored workshops and conferences around the world to teach about the prevalence of domestic violence, how to prevent it, and how to enact laws to define it as a crime with penalties. The IAWJ also took on a project to educate judges on how to apply international human rights instruments to cases affecting women in local courts. The IAWJ's first president was Arline Pacht. In May 1994, it held a conference on Rome on domestic violence. In 2010, when the UK's Baroness Hale was elected President of IAWJ, it had over 4,000 members from over 90 countries. By 2017, it had over 5,000 members. By 2019, it had over 6,000 members. ==Structure== The IAWJ is based in Washington DC and is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation. Its members represent all levels of the judiciary worldwide. It seeks to pioneer judicial education programs to advance human rights, uproot gender bias from judicial systems and promote women‚Äôs access to courts. It has a ten member Board of Directors and a seven member Executive Council. The IAWJ holds a biennial conference, meeting in London 2012 and in Arusha, Tanzania in 2014, where Teresita de Castro from the Philippines became President. The IAWJ is credited with creating the term \\"sextortion\\" in 2009 to describe the pervasive form of sexual exploitation that occurs when people in positions of authority seek to extort sexual favours in exchange of something within their power to grant or withhold. The IAWJ works with national associations in five regions to develop and implement training on issues concerning discrimination and violence against women, including its judicial training initiative, the Jurisprudence of Equality Program. ===Presidents=== * Arline Pacht, United States, 1992-1994 * Pacita Canizares-Nye, Philippines, 1994-1996 * Susan Devine, Canada, 1996-1998 * Carmen Argibay, Argentina, 1998-2000 * Mella Carroll, Ireland, 2000-2002 * Laeticia Kikonyogo, Uganda, 2002-2004 * Jane Mathews, Australia, 2004-2006 * Graciela Dixon, Panama, 2006-2008 * Leslie Alden, United States, 2008-2010 * Brenda Hale, United Kingdom, 2010-2012 * Eusebia Munuo, Tanzania, 2012-2014 * Teresita de Castro, Philippines, 2014-2016 * Susana Medina de Rizzo, Argentina, 2016-2018 * Vanessa Ruiz, United States, 2018-2020 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website Category:Women judges Category:Legal organizations based in the United States Category:International judicial organizations Category:International organizations based in the United States ","title":"International Association of Women Judges"},{"id":"61376359","text":"Sir Stephen Herbert Pierssen√© (9 August 1899 - 29 January 1966) was General Director of Conservative Central Office between 1945 and 1957 and credited with reviving the Conservative Party‚Äôs fortunes in the years following World War II.Obituary in The Times, Sir Stephen Piersenn√©, Reviving the Post-War Conservative Party, January 31, 1966, p.12 In conjunction with Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton, he was instrumental in the successful re- election of Winston Churchill as Prime Minister in 1951.

It is used as a prop in yoga as exercise. The use of wooden bricks was introduced by B. K. S. Iyengar, founder of Iyengar Yoga. Their use is now more widespread, including in Restorative Yoga and Yin Yoga. ==History== B. K. S. Iyengar, who founded Iyengar Yoga in the 1970s, introduced the use of yoga props including bricks and straps to assist his students towards correct alignment in the asanas. He recommended that yoga bricks be similar in size to a house brick, 9 x 4.5 x 3 inches (22.5 x 11 x 7.5 cm) in size. Iyengar yoga institutions sell unbranded props such as bricks, belts, bolsters and blankets. ==Considerations== Yoga bricks are manufactured in a variety of materials, sizes, and colours. Lydia Willgress, writing in The Independent, states that the key considerations are the hardness of the material, which influences the comfort and support they provide; size and weight; and appearance. Some brands, such as Lululemon, also provide \\"motivational messaging\\" on both the packaging and the actual block. Practitioners may choose to own only a single block, but some asanas require a block under each hand, or a stack of two blocks, so purchasing a set of two may be practical and economical on shipping costs. ==Materials== therapeutic use of yoga The earliest yoga bricks were made of wood, providing excellent support and durability but relatively little comfort. They are hard, often heavy, expensive, and tend to become slippery when wet. These considerations led to the development of yoga bricks in other materials, and to the marketing of hollow wooden blocks which are lighter but more costly and less durable. Woods used include hardwoods like birch and maple, and softwoods like pine; hardwood blocks are heavier (up to about 2.5 pounds or 1.1 kg) and more durable than those made of softwood. Lightweight wooden blocks made of balsa are available from some manufacturers. Bamboo blocks are durable but relatively expensive. Cork is a natural material, making it an attractive choice for yoga practitioners concerned about ecological impact. It provides good grip, and since it is naturally waterproof, it usefully resists absorbing sweat. All the same, they do eventually absorb odours and they also tend to crumble with use. Foam plastic or rubber blocks are lighter than cork, ranging between 200 and 400 grams (7 to 14 ounces), so are convenient to carry around, and they are often inexpensive, so they are widely used by yoga studios. Those of relatively soft foam are comfortable to sit on but provide less support for other parts of the body as may be needed in the more advanced asanas. Manufacturers such as Manduka make recycled foam blocks, offering the combination of a light and strong prop with a low ecological impact. ==Size and shape== The yoga teacher Benna Crawford notes that brick and block are usually synonyms for the same yoga props, but that manufacturers sometimes use \\"brick\\" for a slim one, about 2 inches (5 cm) thick, and \\"block\\" for a thicker one of 3 inches (7.5 cm) and above. Most yoga bricks are cuboidal blocks, often with chamfered edges for comfort. Well-designed blocks have unequal length, width, and thickness, offering three different heights for different uses in the yoga class. Some manufacturers have explored other shapes; for example, Yogamatters make an oval block, comfortable for sitting but less versatile as a support. ==Applications== Vasisthasana using props including a thin yoga block, yoga mats, and a folding chair The yoga teacher and author Candace Moore writes that yoga bricks can be useful for both beginners and advanced practitioners. Beginners can benefit from supporting their hand in asanas such as Trikonasana, Triangle pose, sitting on a block in a forward bend such as Paschimottanasana, or supporting one buttock in Eka PƒÅda RƒÅjakapotƒÅsana (King Pigeon pose), giving a beneficial forward tilt to the pelvis. Moore suggests that a pair of blocks can be used to support the knees in the seated Baddha Konasana, Cobbler's pose, while practitioners can work towards more advanced poses using a block under each hand to practice arm balances such as Eka Hasta Bhujasana (Elephant's Trunk pose), a preparatory asana for Astavakrasana. Similarly, in Iyengar Yoga, a pair of yoga bricks can be used under the feet in Urdhva Dhanurasana (Upwards Bow pose) to enable the lower trunk to lift better, or the hands can be placed on yoga bricks. Yin Yoga (founded c. 1975) uses props such as blocks to help get sensation into whichever area is of concern; the purpose may be to increase stress in an area, to reduce stress where it is not wanted, to make some poses accessible to the practitioner, to provide enough support to allow the muscles to let go, and to make poses more comfortable, permitting them to be held for longer. The Yin Yoga teacher Sarah Powers explains that \\"When the bones feel supported, the muscles can relax;\\" an example is the use of blocks to support the knees in Butterfly pose, the Yin equivalent of Baddha Konasana. Restorative Yoga (founded c. 2007) uses blocks extensively, for example arranging them under a bolster to create a ramp or to raise a part of the body. ==See also== * Yoga mat * Yoga pants ==References== Category:Exercise equipment Brick ","title":"Yoga brick"},{"id":"61376371","text":"Chand Mohammad is an Indian politician.

Five of his seven victims were female foreigners (from Nepal, the Philippines, and Romania) he had met on the online dating site Badoo. The remaining two victims were young children, and were the daughters of two of the women he had killed. The case came to public attention in April 2019 when unusually heavy floods brought the body of the first victim, Mary Rose Tiburcio, to the top of a mine shaft near Mitsero, where it was discovered by a German tourist. Another body was discovered in a well at a firing range by Orounta. Three of the victims were stuffed into suitcases and disposed of in the Red Lake near Mitsero, so named because the toxic chemicals present in the lake from nearby mining operations gave it a red hue. The latest body, that of Tiburcio's six-year-old daughter Sierra, was found in Lake Memi near Xyliatos in June. During his apprehension, Metaxas reportedly attempted to swallow a SIM card in front of police before they stopped him. After he was named as a suspect, multiple women came forward to accuse him of crimes such as rape, and he was also formally accused of evidence tampering and obstruction of justice; however, critical evidence for these charges was believed to have been destroyed or lost. Metaxas told investigators that he had strangled two of his victims and their daughters because he suspected that the women were planning to \\"pimp out\\" their daughters, and he wanted to punish the women and \\"free\\" the children. He pleaded guilty on 24 June and received seven life sentences, the biggest sentence ever handed down in Cyprus. The murders sparked criticism towards the negligence and incompetence of the island's police force, as many of the victims had been reported missing by relatives or friends as far back as September 2016, only to be met with indifference and a lack of progress in the investigationsPresident Nicos Anastasiades condemned the authorities' \\"sheer negligence and inefficiency\\", adding his belief that their actions were \\"definitely not guided by any racist motives\\". In the midst of the case, Justice Minister Ionas Nicolaou resigned and police chief Zacharias Chrysostomou was fired. As of July 2019, an investigation into the police's handling of the reports is underway. That same month, Cypriot MPs began meetings to address the fact that 37 women had been killed in Cyprus between 2000 and 2019. Cypriot businessman Sir Stelios Haji- Ioannou, founder of British airline easyJet, announced that he would donate ‚Ç¨10,000 to each of the closest relatives of each victim. As of July 2019, he has been unable to contact the relatives of two of the victims, and has said that he will donate the additional sums of ‚Ç¨10,000 each to Metaxas' eight- year-old son and six-year-old daughter for their education in the meantime. ==Victims== Metaxas confessed to the murders of five women and two children, all foreigners. All of the adults were migrant workers. At least four bodies have been dumped in lakes, and two were found in an abandoned mine. 36-year- old Romanian woman Livia Florentina Bunea and her eight-year-old daughter Elena, both killed in September 2016, are thought to have been the first victims. Two decomposed bodies, which the police believe to be those of Bunea and her daughter, were found stuffed into suitcases and dumped in a lake. A third suitcase which is believed to contain the body of Maricar Valtez Arquiola, a 31-year-old Filipino woman who disappeared in December 2017, has yet to be found. Filipina Mary Rose Tiburcio, a 38-year-old Filipino migrant worker, was the last woman killed but the first body found; her body was discovered in an abandoned mine on 14 April 2019 by a German tourist. Three bodies have been found naked, bound, and wrapped in sheets. The police believe them to be the bodies of two Filipino migrant workers and possibly that of a Nepalese woman, whose body was found at an army shooting range by investigators. The body of six-year-old Filipino girl Sierra Graze Seucalliuc was found in a lake on 12 June 2019. She went missing with her mother, Mary Rose Seucalliuc, in May 2018. ==Nikos Metaxas== Nikos Metaxas (; born in 1984) is a Greek Cypriot former army officer confessed to the Mitsero murders. He has been charged by the Supreme Court of Cyprus with seven life sentences. == Aftermath == Cypriot authorities are facing accusations of not fully investigating the reports when the women were first reported missing. ==References== Category:2010s in Cyprus Category:2010s murders in Cyprus Category:2019 in Cyprus Category:Murder in Cyprus ","title":"Mitsero murders"},{"id":"61376537","text":"Dr Helen Elizabeth Mair OBE FFCM FRCPsych FRCP (18 April 1924 - 14 March 2016) was an English physician and medical author.

Inter- trappean beds outcrop in many places of the Ethiopian highlands. They consist of fluvio-lacustrine deposits, that are generally a few tens of metres thick. Often, these interbedded fluvio-lacustrine deposits are very visible because their bright colours strongly contrast with the basalt environment. ==Name and definition== The formation, also called silicified limestone and interbedded lacustrine deposits was first extensively characterised in the 1930s by Merla and Minucci. ==Stratigraphic context== The formation is generally at the interface between the lower Ashangi Basalts, and the upper Alaji Basalts. ==Environment== The sediments were deposited in shallow lakes and marshes in large topographic depressions. The dense vegetation hosted mammals and birds, which found their food between the reeds of the lake shores. The decomposing vegetation sometimes deprived the water of oxygen, what led to large dy-offs, particularly when temperatures raised. In addition, water levels were variable, and annually some of the lakes could dry up completely. Relatively few species could adapt to such variable conditions. Dogu‚Äôa Tembien, Tigray Region ==Lithology== Rock sample collected east of Khunale The intra- volcanic rocks comprise silicified mudstone interfingered with diatomites. The term ‚Äòsilicified‚Äô points to the fact that the calcium atoms in the calcium carbonate molecules have been replaced by silicium taken from the environment (isomorphic substitution). These deposits contain fossils of molluscs and gastropods. Between the towns of Hagere Selam and Inda Maryam Qorar (Dogu‚Äôa Tembien), roadcuts show around 45 metres thick sedimentary deposits. The fossilised calcareous beds, locally contain cherty nodules and wavy laminations. The loose to massive sediments of the uppermost part of the formation show well-developed bedding; they are black in colour. This is peat, the result of organic decomposition, that was then covered by the Alaji Basalts, the second phase of basalt eruption. ==Life== The inter-trappean beds contain a silicified mollusc fauna: Pila sp.; Lanistes sp.; Pirenella conica; and land snails (Achatinidae indet.). In their diagenesis the gastropods have generally been preserved as internal moulds. Sometimes, shell remains may partially have been preserved. Though it is rare, well-preserved shell material does occur. The parts that were originally filled with sediment are preserved as quartzite; in the air-filled cavities translucent quartz has crystallised, sometimes with well-formed crystals. Depending on mineral inclusions, the colours of the quartzite range from black to pale white over yellowish and pink. The gastropods themselves, particularly their faeces, have contributed to the silicification, more in particular to the formation of pelletoidal wackestone, that ultimately changed into cherts. ==Geographical extent== The formation occurs widely in the Tertiary volcanics of Ethiopia. In Dogu‚Äôa Tembien, particularly around Hagere Selam they reach a thickness of around 100 metres lying above one hundred metres of basalts. ==The Geramba Rock-Hewn Church in Intra-volcanic Silicified Mudstone== In the Ethiopian flood basalts, rock-hewn churches are absent because the rock is too hard to excavate and vulnerable to underground water flow. However, the intra-volcanic sedimentary rock has been used in the Tembien highlands to sculpt the Geramba rock church. It is the only rock church carved from this formation. The church is designed as a basilica; it holds a flat ceiling and three bays. On the rock wall, there are some ancient paintings. ==References== Category:Geologic formations of Ethiopia ","title":"Intra-volcanic sedimentary rock in North Ethiopia"},{"id":"61376601","text":"Hounga v Allen [2014] UKSC 47 is a UK labour law case, concerning the right to equal treatment, wages, and the illegality principle. ==Facts== Mary Hounga sued Adenike Allen, the employer, for damages under race discrimination after dismissal under the Race Relations Act 1976 (now the Equality Act 2010). Hounga was brought to the UK fraudulently as the granddaughter of Mrs Allen, who used Hounga illegally as a domestic servant from January 2007 in Allen‚Äôs home in Hanworth, Middlesex. She was probably 14 years old, although her passport had been obtained fraudulently in Lagos, Nigeria by Mrs Allen, and so her true age was unknown. She had not received comprehensive education, and was assessed as having learning difficulties, but could speak English well. Hounga cared for Mrs Allen‚Äôs actual three smaller children. A contract of employment would have been a criminal offence under section 24(1)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1971. Hounga, although a child, was found to have known that coming to the UK was unlawful. She was never paid as she was originally promised, and while living with the family Allen beat and abused Hounga, until July 2008 when she was kicked out of the house, had water poured on her, and slept in her wet clothes in the front garden. When she tried to get back in at 7am and nobody answered, she went to the supermarket carpark, where she was found and taken to social services. She was given the assistance of the UK Human Trafficking Centre. Hounga also brought a claim for unpaid wages, but this was dropped in the first instances of the litigation, leaving the race discrimination claim. ==JudgmentTribunal=== The Employment Tribunal found that Hounga was treated badly and dismissed because she was an immigrant, and therefore allowed a claim of racial discrimination. However, it rejected a claim in contract for unpaid wages, as the claim required the assertion of an illegal contract. ===Employment Appeal Tribunal=== Silber J in the EAT upheld the outcome of the decision by the Tribunal, while criticising the poor quality of its reasoning and making significant errors in paragraph numbering. ===Court of Appeal=== Rimer LJ held the discrimination claim was ‚Äòinextricably linked‚Äô with the illegal conduct, because her immigration status meant that the claimant had a ‚Äòspecial vulnerability‚Äô. It would be condoning the illegality to allow the claimant to rely on her own illegal actions. ===Supreme Court=== Lord Wilson held that Ms Hounga‚Äôs claim was not barred for illegality. Unlawful discrimination is a statutory tort, and the connection was insufficiently close, and did not have an ‚Äòinextricable‚Äô link. According to him, ‚Äòthe application of the defence of illegality to claims in tort is highly problematic.‚Äô The public policy against trafficking and in favour of the protection of its victims outweighed any public policy considerations in respect of not encouraging illegality. Lord Kerr and Lady Hale concurred with Lord Wilson. Lord Hughes dissented on the reasoning. He would have allowed the claim on the ground that the discriminatory act was not intrinsically connected to the illegality, but said this was distinct from any claim based on contract. He felt that the policy on illegal immigration and human trafficking was not so decisive as the majority had indicated. Lord Carnworth concurred with Lord Hughes. ==See also== *UK labour law ==NotesReferences== *E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 4(1)(b) ==External links== * Category:United Kingdom labour case law Category:United Kingdom constitutional case law ","title":"Hounga v Allen"},{"id":"61376612","text":"Sonawari assembly constituency belongs to Bandipura district of Jammu and Kashmir.

He was a pioneer samba composer and participated in the first samba schools in Brazil. Later in life he became known by his paintings. == Early years == Heitor was born in the Rio de Janeiro, to Eduardo Alexandre dos Prazeres, woodworker and clarinetist in the National Guard band, and the seamstress Celestina Gon√ßalves Martins, living in the Cidade Nova (Pra√ßa Onze) neighborhood. He was known as Lino and had two older sisters, Acirema and Iraci. His father taught him to play the clarinet in various rhythms like polkas, waltzes, choros and marches, dying when he was seven. Dos Prazeres dropped out of school at the fourth grade and learned carpentry. His uncle, Hil√°rio Jovino Ferreira, a musician known as \\"Lalu de Ouro\\" gave him his first cavaquinho. Following his uncle steps, he learned the instrument and presented himself as Mano Heitor do Cavaquinho. He started playing in candombl√© religious gatherings in houses where other experienced musicians played and improvised African rhythms such as jongo, lundu, cateret√™, samba, etc., with percussion instruments or cavaquinho. Some of the most important gatherings he attended were at the houses of vov√≥ Celi, tia Esther, Oswaldo Cruz and tia Ciata, where musicians like Lalu de Ouro, Caninha, Jo√£o da Baiana, Sinh√¥, Get√∫lio Marinho (\\"Amor\\"), Donga, Saturnino Gon√ßalves (\\"Satur\\"), Pixinguinha, and Paulo da Portela played. While working as a shoe shiner and newsboy, he frequented nearby breweries and silent movies near Pra√ßa Onze and Lapa cafes, where he could hear the typical Belle √âpoque musicians and orchestras in Rio de Janeiro. At thirteen, Heitor was sent to prison for truancy and spent two months in the Correctional Colony Dois Rios on Ilha Grande. O limoeiro, Lim√£o e Adeus, √≥culo were his first compositions, dated of 1912. == Career == In the 1920s, assisted by other sambistas and composers such as Jo√£o da Baiana, Caninha, Ismael Silva, Alceb√≠ades Barcelos (\\"Bide\\") and Mar√ßal he helped to organize various samba groups from Rio Comprido, Est√°cio and other places nearby, so was known as Mano Heitor of Estacio. He attended meetings at Mangueira and Oswaldo Cruz with Cartola, Paulo da Portela, Joao da Gente, Man√© Bambambam and others, which led to the creation of the first samba schools: Deixa Falar, De Mim Ningu√©m se Lembra and Vizinha Faladeira at Est√°cio; Prazer da Moreninha e Sai como Pode in Madureira. The last two merged and became Portela, his favorite samba school, whose colors blue and white were chosen by him. Portela, in 1929 was the first winner of a competition between schools, with its composition N√£o Adianta Chorar. He participated in the formation of the Esta√ß√£o Primeira de Mangueira with Cartola. He also founded in 1928 the samba school Uni√£o do Est√°cio, with Nilton Bastos, \\"Bide\\" e Mano Rubem. Two of his most popular songs were Deixaste meu lar and Estas farto de minha vida, both from 1925 and recorded by Francisco Alves. Another song of his own from the same era was Deixe a malandragem se √©s capaz. In 1927, he won a samba contest organized by Z√© Espinguela with the song A Tristeza Me Persegue. In the same year he performed with pianist Sinh√¥ the first controversy of Brazilian popular music; when performing at the popular festival of Our Lady of Penha, where the songs for the upcoming Carnival were presented to the public, he discovered that the authorship of Cassino Maxixe, played by Francisco Alves, was attributed only to Sinh√¥ and his co-authorship was omitted. Something similar happened with Ora Vejam S√≥. Sinh√¥'s answer was: \\"Samba is like a bird, he who catches owns it.\\" Heitor's response was the samba Olha ele, cuidado, where he reported the episode. In turn, he was answered by Sinh√¥ with the samba Segura o Boi. Since Sinh√¥ was known as the \\"King of Samba,\\" Heitor composed the song Rei dos meus sambas (King of My Sambas) and could record it and distribute it despite Sinh√¥'s opposition. He reached an agreement whereby he reached 38,000 r√©is and recognition for co-authorship. Prazeres himself was accused of appropriating other sambas such as compositions by Paulo da Portela and Antonio Rufino's Vai mesmo, for which in 1941 a leader prevented him from parading with Portela. In 1931 he married Dona Gloria, with whom he had three daughters, Ivete, Iriete and Ionete Maria. After the death of his wife in 1936, he devoted himself to the visual arts, especially painting, at the encouragement of draftsman, journalist and art critic Carlos Cavalcante, painter Augusto Rodrigues and writer Carlos Drummond de Andrade. He also made percussion instruments and designed and made the costumes, furniture, and tapestry of his musical and dance groups. His residence in Pra√ßa Tiradentes was, in fact, a meeting point for people interested in his knowledge of Afro-Brazilian culture and its most important meeting centers. Among the visitors were the medical student and future composer Noel Rosa. Drummond, another of his frequent visitors, brought him a poem of his own to be set to music, O Homem e seu Carnaval(1934). Although he was unable to musicalize it, he was later inspired by this poem to create a painting of the same name. In 1937, he began exhibiting his paintings in which he portrayed life in the favelas: children playing, men playing or drinking, young people dancing samba, etc. It represented the faces of people in profile, their heads and eyes turned upwards. At the request of his friend Carlos Cavalcante, in 1951 he participated in the first Biennial of Modern Art of S√£o Paulo, winning the third prize at the national artists exhibition with his painting Moenda. At the second S√£o Paulo Biennial, in 1953, a room was reserved for the exhibition of his work. He created sets and costumes for the ballet of the commemoration of the fourth centenary of the city of S√£o Paulo, in 1954. In 1959, he exhibited for the first time individually at Rio de Janeiro's Galeria Gea. In 1965 Antonio Carlos da Fontoura directed a documentary about his life and work. == Death and legacy == Dos Prazeres died on 4 October 1966 in Rio de Janeiro, at 68 years old. He left a catalog of around 300 composed songs. In 1999, on the centenary of his birth, a retrospective of his pictorial work was held at Espa√ßo BNDES and at the National Museum of Fine Arts of Rio de Janeiro.

One of the most important and tangible issue in Iranian traditional architecture is to pay proper attention and awareness of climate conditions and human comfort in the environment and to make an effort to use climate elements and consider climatic designing to construct Iranian traditional houses. Iranian architects have attempted to create an optimal environment with proportion of intercalary direction and control dimensions and mass ratio and physical ratio of buildings in order to control climate conditions and even use climate elements appropriately. In this paper that is a descriptive article and has collected information by library and field methods has attempted to have a typologicalstudy on the physical structure and dimensions and sizes of traditional houses byDezfulclimate conditions taken into consideration, and it will discuss some questions: what are the structural parameters considered by the Iranian architects when designing the mentioned houses according to climate conditions? Do the structural elements and also ratios and dimensions of houses in Dezful could be effective on creating a physical optimal condition?

The Schippersgracht canal is an extension of the Nieuwe Herengracht leading to Nieuwe Vaart, and is about long. The quay along the north-west side of the water has the house numbers 2 to 16, with even and odd numbers alternating (not opposite each other). In the past there were higher house numbers, up to 423. The current numbering began in the 19th century. The southeastern bank of the canal is called Kadijksplein. The Schippersgracht owes its name to the fact that many skippers lived here. ==Architecture== There are a number of monumental buildings from the 17th century on Schippersgracht, including numbers 14 and 15.

Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts the biblical scene in which Jesus Christ is presented to the people by Pontius Pilate with the phrase \\"Ecce homo\\" (behold the man). The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. == Description  History === Originally from Vercelli, Giovanni Antoni Bazzi, commonly known as Il Sodoma, was educated in Lombardy in the art of painting. Like many other high renaissance painters, much of his work concerned Christian figures, scenes, and motifs. As a professional artist, Sodoma worked on commission for a number of clients throughout the early 16th century; some of these works were lost or incorrectly attributed to other artists. As noted in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's profile of Sodoma's Christ Presented to the People, the work was not identified as being Sidoma's until the mid 19th century. The Met and other scholars have attributed the work to between 1540 and 1549, making the painting one of Sodoma's late works. The work is comparable in some areas (subject material, composition) to an early work (dated to 1525) by Sodoma depicting Christ being tormented by Pontius Pilate's soldiers, though the works do differ in some respects. Christ Presented to the People's frame is itself historical, having been made in Sienna in 1540. The frame contains some gilding that may have been added in the 19th century. === Painting === The painting itself depicts a bound, crowned, bleeding Christ (center) being presented to the people by Pontius Pilate (left from center). The painting captures the moment in which Pilate announces to the crowd \\"Ecce homo\\" (behold the man), a line in keeping with biblical text in the gospel of John 19:5. Pilate (a Roman governor) himself is depicted wearing Middle Eastern clothing in place of Roman garb, and is described by one source as having \\"vaguely orientalizing costume\\"; such depictions possibly are in reference to the-then expanding Ottoman Empire, a major geopolitical force that often clashed with Christian nations in Europe. To Christ's right is a black African, a possible reference to the Arab slave trade (which resulted in black slaves being present in the Middle East) and the Muslim domination of Africa.Paul H. D. Kaplan, ‚ÄúIsabella d‚ÄôEste and Black African Women,‚Äù in Black Africans in Renaissance Europe, ed. T. F. Earle and K. J. P. Lowe, Cambridge, 2005 (2010 ed.), p. 132. Several scholars have also noted that, as the scene depicted in Christ takes place hours before Christ's execution, the presence of a black African is a likely continuation of the European tradition of associating black Africans with executioners. == References == Category:1540 paintings Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art ","title":"Christ Presented to the People (Il Sodoma)"},{"id":"61376729","text":"Serras da Desordem is a 2006 Brazilian film directed by Andrea Tonacci.

He has raced in six countries, namely France, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States and Hong Kong. He showed top- class form as a two-year-old in 2016 when he won two of his three races including the Group 1 Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud. He failed to win in the following year but ran second in the Prix du Jockey Club and fourth in the Irish Derby. In 2018 he won four consecutive races, namely the Prix d'H√©douville, Grand Prix de Chantilly, Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud (Group 1) and Prix Foy. In 2019 he won a third Group 1 race when he took the Prix Ganay and recorded his biggest win in October when he took the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. ==Background== Waldgeist is a chestnut horse with a white blaze bred in England by the Waldlerche Partnership. During his racing career he was owned by a partnership involving Gestut Ammerland, Newsells Park Stud and various members of the Coolmore Stud organization. He was sent into training with Andr√© Fabre in France. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became one of the world's leading stallions, earning his tenth champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland title in 2018. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found Minding and Ruler of the World. Waldgeist's dam Waldlerche showed high class form in France, winning the Prix Penelope in 2012. before becoming a successful broodmare whose other foals have included the Prix de Malleret winner Waldlied. Waldlerche was a half-sister to the St Leger winner Masked Marvel and closely related to the Deutsches Derby winner Waldpark. ==Racing career2016: two-year-old season=== Waldgeist made his debut in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 8 September in which he started odds-on favourite and won by two lengths from Called To The Bar, a colt who went on to win several Group races. He was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Prix de Cond√© over 1800 metres at the same track a month later but despite starting favourite he finished third in a three-way photo finish, beaten a neck and a short head by Frankuus and Prinz Hlodowig. Twelve days later the colt was moved up to the highest class for the Group 1 Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud over 2000 metres on soft ground and started at odds of 10/1 in a thirteen-runner field. After racing in mid-division Waldgeist made a strong run up the stands- side (the right hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint), took the lead 150 metres from the finish and won by a length from Best Solution with the favourite Capri half a length away in third. The unplaced horses included Prinz Hlodowig, Frankuus, Wings of Eagles and Rekindling. Boudot commented \\"He is still quite tender and has plenty to learn so we wanted to give him a good lesson last time. He still lacks a little strength but has a lot of quality and will make a good three-year-old. It is great to win the race for my boss and he is certainly a horse to watch out for next year\\". In the official European Classification of two-year-olds for 2016 Waldgeist was given a rating of 114, making him the tenth best juvenile colt of the season, eight pounds behind the top-rated Churchill. ===2017: three-year-old season=== Waldgeist began his second campaign by starting favourite for the Group 2 Prix Greffulhe over 2000 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 8 May and finished second of the five runners behind Recoletos. In the Prix du Jockey-Club at Chantilly four weeks later he produced a sustained late run to take the lead in the closing stages but was caught on the line and beaten a short head by the favourite Brametot. In the Irish Derby at the Curragh on 1 July he came home fourth behind Capri, Cracksman and Wings of Eagles, beaten less than two lengths by the winner.

Racing against older horses for the first time he was beaten a neck by the front-running four-year-old gelding Danehill Kodiac. He ended his season in Germany on 1 November when he ran fourth behind the five-year-old Guignol in the Grosser Preis von Bayern. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Waldgeist was given a rating of 117, making him the 129th best racehorse in the world. ===2018: four-year-old season=== Waldgeist at the 2018 Breeders' Cup On 8 April 2018 Waldgeist made a disappointing start to his third campaign when he came home fifth behind the nine-year-old British gelding Air Pilot in the Prix d'Harcourt over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Four weeks later at the same track he was made the 2.6/1 favourite for the 2400 metre Prix d'H√©douville. He produced a strong late run on the outside to take the lead inside the last 100 metres and won by one and a half lengths and a had from Way To Paris and Called To The Bar. On 3 June the colt started second choice behind Cloth of Stars in the betting for the Grand Prix de Chantilly. He took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths from the German challenger Dschingis Secret. The Group 1 Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud on 1 July saw Waldgeist start odds-on favourite against five opponents, namely Cloth of Stars, Coronet, Salouen (runner-up in the Coronation Cup), Iquitos (Grosser Preis von Baden) and Oriental Eagle (Gerling-Preis). After racing in third place he made a sustained run in the straight and got the better of a closely contested struggle with Coronet in the last 100 metres to win by a short head. After the race Gestut Ammerland's Dietrich von Boetticher said \\"It was a great performance and, although he has taken time to mature, he is stronger now as a four-year-old. He has proved himself since the start of the season and was given a great ride by Pierre- Charles Boudot today\\". Following a break of two and a half months Waldgeist returned to the track for the Prix Foy (a major trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) at Longchamp on 15 September. Starting the 0.6/1 favourite he won in \\"impressive\\" style as he took the lead in the last 100 metres and pulled away to win by two and a half lengths from Talismanic. The four other beaten runners were Cloth of Stars, Way To Paris, Capri and the Japanese challenger Clincher. In the 2018 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 7 October Waldgeist started at odds of 6/1, making him easily the best-fancied of the French-trained runners. After racing towards the rear of the field he made steady progress in the straight and came home fourth behind Enable, Sea of Class and Cloth of Stars. Four weeks later he was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs for which he started second favourite but finished fifth of the thirteen runners. In December at Sha Tin Racecourse Waldgeist started favourite for the Hong Kong Vase but after being hampered in the straight he came home fifth, beaten four and a half lengths by the locally trained winner Exultant. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Waldgeist was given a rating of 122, making him the 20th best racehorse in the world. ===2019: five-year-old season=== Waldgeist made his first appearance of 2019 in the Prix Ganay over 2100 at Longchamp on 28 April and started 3.4/1 second favourite behind Ghaiyyath (Prix d'Harcourt) in a five-runner field which also included Intellogent (Prix Jean Prat), Study of Man and Soleil Marin (Prix Exbury). He was settled in third place by Boudot before taking the lead 200 metres out and drawing away to win \\"readily\\" by four and a half lengths from Study of Man. Fabre commented \\"He's five now, and I can train him harder. He takes the work better. Remember, he was beaten a short head in the Prix du Jockey Club. He was unlucky and should have won that day, so he is competitive at this trip\\". In June Waldgeist was sent to Royal Ascot for the Prince of Wales's Stakes over ten furlongs. In a race run in driving rain he finished third behind Crystal Ocean and Magical. In the following month he returned to Ascot for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. After racing in mid-division he stayed on strongly in the straight to finish third behind Enable and Crystal Ocean. As on 2018, Waldgeist prepared for the Arc de Triomphe in the Prix Foy and won again, coming home two lengths clear of his three opponents at odds of 2/5. On 6 October Waldgeist started the 13.1/1 fifth choice behind Enable, Sottsass, Japan and Ghaiyyath in the 98th running of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Boudot settled Waldgeist in mid-division as Ghaiyyath set the pace from Fierement, Magical and Enable. Magical took the lead in the straight before giving way to Enable but Waldgeist produced a sustained run on the outside, caught the favourite 50 metres from the finish and drew away in the final strides to win by one and three quarter lengths. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Waldgeist was given a rating of 128, placing him in a three-way tie for first place alongside Enable and Crystal Ocean. ==Stud career== Waldgeist began his career as a breeding stallion at the Ballylinch Stud in County Kilkenny, standing at an initial fee of ‚Ç¨17,500. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Thoroughbred family 5-h Category:Arc winners ","title":"Waldgeist"},{"id":"61376793","text":"The National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/6221) are a statutory instrument under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 that elaborate rules on how to calculate whether someone is being paid the minimum wage, who gets it, and how to enforce it. ==ContentsSee also== *UK labour law *Tax Credits and Child tax credit, Working tax credit *Wage regulation ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== * Category:United Kingdom labour law Category:Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom Category:2015 in British law Category:2015 in labor relations ","title":"National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015"},{"id":"61376821","text":"Raymond Eric Cann (born 13 December 1937) is a male former diver who competed for England. ==Diving career== He represented Great Britain in the Diving at the 1956 Summer Olympics.

In its modern form it dates from March 1975 when it was founded by Daikirin, a former Nishonoseki stable wrestler. It produced many sekitori 11 in total such as Masurao, Enazakura, Daishi, Wakatoba and Wakakirin. In March 2005, with Oshiogawa approaching the mandatory retirement age and no obvious successor available, the stable was absorbed into the affiliated Oguruma stable. ==History== Founded in 1975 by Ozeki Daikirin after a succession dispute over Nishonoseki stable. The former head coach of Nishonoseki stable Saganohana died in 1975. His heir apparent and successor was thought to be Daikirin but after being unable to come to an agreement with Saganohana's widow. This was because wrestler Kong≈ç who retired at only 28 to marry Saganohana's daughter and take over the stable was the widow's choice as the next head. Daikirin realizing he now had no chance of taking over so instead he broke away and established his own Oshiogawa stable. He attempted to take a number of high- ranking wrestlers with him, such as Aobaj≈ç and Tenry≈´, but Nishonoseki stable objected to this. The Japan Sumo Association intervened and Tenry≈´ was forced to return to Nishonoseki and, disillusioned, quit to become a professional wrestler. The stable would produce its first homegrown sekitori in January 1981 following Kinoarashi promotion to Juryo. This would be followed by Masurao promotion in July 1983. The stable would continue this trend producing 9 more sekitori overtime. In March 2005, with Oshiogawa approaching the mandatory retirement age and no obvious successor available, his stable was absorbed into the affiliated Oguruma stable included in this was sekitori Wakatoba and Wakakirin.

She was raised in Washington D.C. and also lived in Niger for a short period as a child. She has an MBA in Finance from Columbia Business School, where she was a Robert F. Toigo fellow. She also obtained a BBA in Finance from Howard University in Washington DC, where she was the recipient of scholarships including one from the Wall Street Journal. She was initially interested in politics and her father encouraged her to be a journalist but during her time at Howard, her interest switched to Finance and she moved to the Howard University's School of Business. Later on, whilst working for Goldman Sachs, she won an MBA scholarship at Columbia Business School, where she is still involved, interviewing prospective students. She is the inaugural recipient of the Columbia Business School Young Alumni of the Year Award (2014). == Career == Essom√©'s investment banking career has spanned over 30 years with roles in equities, fixed income and investment management. She has worked in the US, UK and France. After university Essom√© started her career at Merrill Lynch in New York. She later moved to Goldman Sachs and, after business school, to Chase, (later JPMorgan Chase), where she spent time in London in Global Syndicated Finance and on the Securitisation Team. After leaving JPMorgan Chase, she went to Paris and worked for a woman‚Äôs organisation, promoting women in business. She was then recruited back to Lehman Bros in London in a strategic role to attract more women and ethnic minorities to the bank. Afterwards she moved to Nomura, when Lehman was bought by them in the UK..

She describes the reason for her recruitment as being to drive the company forward from its then position as a defunct association, into an organisation with global reach, able to provide world class research, networking and convening opportunities for fund managers and advocates on their behalf to the world. When she joined, she had to wind down the legacy entity and set up a new one in the UK, recruit the board and new members, establish good governance, attract a team and build up a research capability to prove Africa‚Äôs attractiveness as an investment location. From 2011-2020, AVCA grew both in size and services offered; its members are now made up of more than 150 companies that manage more than $ 1.5 trillion in assets and the number of attendees at its annual conference has more than doubled since 2011. From 2013-2018, PE investment in Africa totalled $17.8bn.

Given the many lateritic palaeosols and locally fossil wood fragments, the formation is interpreted as a deposit in estuarine, lacustrine-deltaic or continental environments. The upper limit of Adigrat Sandstone is of Middle-Late Jurassic age (around 160 million years or Ma ago) whereas the lower boundary is Triassic (200 Ma). There are numerous rock-hewn churches in this formation. ==Name and definition== The name ‚ÄúAdigrat Sandstone‚Äù was coined by geologist William Thomas Blanford, who accompanied the British Expedition to Abyssinia in 1868. The formation is named after the town of Adigrat, on the route of the invading British army. So far the nomenclature was not proposed for recognition to the International Commission on Stratigraphy. ==Stratigraphic context== The Adigrat Sandstone has been deposited upon a Triassic planation surface. The age of the Adigrat Sandstone is not well-defined and sedimentation has probably started at different times in different areas. Recent investigations using fossils determined a Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic age. ==Environment== A large part of the formation was deposited in a shallow sea, as indicated by the presence of fossils typical of brackish water and shallow marine environment (such as bivalves, foraminifera, and marine crocodiles). The sedimentary structures also suggest tidal environments and storm deposits. Other sediment and also sedimentary structures indicate that parts of the sands were deposited in a continental environment. Rock sample of Adigrat Sandstone, collected at Kalazban ==Lithology== The Adigrat Sandstone comprises thick sequences of cross-bedded sandstone with minor intercalations of siltstone and claystone and sometimes dolomite. The sandstones consist essentially of quartz, but hold also some feldspar. The grains are cemented by silica and clay minerals. The thickness of the Adigrat Sandstone increases from north to south: maximum values (600 metres) are west of the Mekelle Outlier at the edge of Kola Tembien and Dogu‚Äôa Tembien districts. ==Life== In the Adigrat Sandstone, fossil wood fragments and trace fossils have been recorded. In addition, remains of vertebrate animals, such as non-marine amphibians and reptiles, have been found. ==Geographical extent== The formation outcrops widely in north Ethiopia, particularly in the gorges formed by the Tekezze River and its affluents. In extends further to the southeast towards Soqota and to the northeast towards Gheralta, Adigrat and central Eritrea. Debre Sema'it rock chuch ==The Rock-Hewn Churches in Adigrat Sandstone== Most of the rock-hewn monolithic churches in the Tigray region are in Adigrat Sandstone. These churches are located in the districts Hawzen, Kola Tembien and Dogu‚Äôa Tembien. The precise ages of these churches are not well defined but they would mostly have been excavated between the 10th and 15th centuries. According to local belief, the carving of the churches was started by missionaries who came from the Mediterranean to Ethiopia (known as the ‚ÄòNine Saints‚Äô) during the fifth or sixth century. They promoted monasticism, hence the remote and inaccessible locations of many rock-hewn churches. The tradition continues until today, as new rock-hewn churches are being excavated. Although design and structure vary, most rock churches consist of a hall with basilica architecture holding three naves, often vestibule, domes, pillars, vast ceilings and archways. Ceilings and walls may be decorated with colourful frescoes and rock carvings. Most of these mediaeval churches are still in use today as Orthodox village churches. Dogu‚Äôa and Kola Tembien The mediaeval Siqurto foot tunnel has also been excavated in Adigrat Sandstone. == Geomorphology == The Adigrat Sandstone is intersected by an orthogonal network of joints. In thick and homogeneous sandstone, there is a distance of tens of metres between major joints. As the uplift of the Ethiopian Highlands during the Caenozoic resulted deep incision of the rivers, a remarkable Grand Canyon- like structural relief has been created, holding mesas, buttes, and pinnacles up to 300 metres high, beneath the main escarpment. The rectangular shape of these relief forms indicates that their formation has been influenced by intersecting joints. A dominant process in cliff formation is rockfall. Variations of slope steepness along the escarpments are due to the distinctive bedding of the rocks and to variability in rock type: on thick sequences of homogeneous sandstone vertical faces have developed, while intercalations of thinly bedded fine-grained sediments lead to steps in the slopes. Caverns and apses have formed along bedding planes and along curved joints. These natural cavities have sometimes been expanded into larger caves by the inhabitants of the area. == References == Category:Geologic formations of Ethiopia Category:Geology of Eritrea Category:Triassic System of Africa Category:Jurassic System of Africa Category:Sandstone formations Category:Shallow marine deposits Formations ","title":"Adigrat Sandstone"},{"id":"61377074","text":"Adunni Oluwole (1905-1957) was a Nigerian pre-independence politician and human rights activist who vehemently opposed independence.. She was born in Ibadan, Oyo State and was raised in Aroloyo, Lagos State. She was an itinerant preacher whose talent in public speaking contributed to her fame. She delved into politics in 1954, and founded the Nigerian Commoners Liberal Party. She died in 1957 after a brief illness. == Early life and education == Adunni Oluwole was born in Ibadan in 1905 to the family of an Ibadan warrior. After some family squabbles, her mother moved with her and her siblings to Aroloya, Lagos where they lived close to St. John's church. Adolphus Howells, the Vicar, contributed to the family's development while they remained in the area. She lived with Howells, who enrolled her in St. John's School, Aroloya. She however returned to her mother after her primary education. From 1925 to 1932, Oluwole took part in leadership and dramatic roles in St. John's church. As a youth, she wrote a play for the Girl's Guild which was directed by the nationalist Herbert Macaulay. She went on to establish the first female-owned professional theater in Western Nigeria. Oluwole soon after became an itinerant preacher. She vehemently opposed bringing dead bodies into the church for funerals, claiming to have seen a vision from God saying that He was God of the living not the dead. Her public speaking prowess gained her a vast audience and increased her popularity. == Political career == Oluwole's foray into politics began with the general workers strike of 1945; moved by the plight of the poor, she supported the workers, mobilizing women supporters and donating monetary gifts though she was not a rich woman. In 1954, she founded the Nigerian Commoners Liberal Party, the majority of whose members were men. Barely five months after it was established, it won a seat in Ikirun, Osun North, defeating the NCNC and AG. Oluwole was an anti- independence activist and opposed the vote for independence when a date was first proposed in 1956. Her reasons were that the politicians who were given power abused it and were simply African colonialists. Her message resonated with the rural people and they came to be known among Yoruba-speaking groups as \\"Egbe Koyinbo Mailo\\" which translates to \\"The White Man Must Not Go\\". The party was short-lived as it had to be shut down due to low funding. In 1955, she went before the Olubadan in Ibadan to air her political views, but she was shut down by Adegoke Adelabu who called her a harlot and threatened to hit her with broomsticks. She was later banished from Ibadan and relocated to Akure where she continued to spread her anti-independence message. Oluwole was also an advocate for women's rights and she continuously demanded women's participation in politics in constitutional conferences. == References == Category:Nigerian women activists Category:Nigerian politicians Category:Nigerian women writers Category:1905 births Category:1957 deaths ","title":"Adunni Oluwole"},{"id":"61377075","text":"The Onbekendegracht (Unknown Canal) is a short canal in Amsterdam, in the eastern part of the Grachtengordel (canal belt). ==Location== The Onbekendegracht, which connects the Nieuwe Prinsengracht and the Nieuwe Achtergracht, is located directly behind the Royal Theater Carr√© in the Weesperbuurt.

Approximately 6,650 athletes from 41 NOCs will participate in 419 events in 39 sports. The United States topped the medal count with 120 gold and 293 overall medals, its best result in the 21st century. Brazil pulled off its best performance in history, winning 54 gold and 169 overall medals, and finishing second in the standings. Mexico (37 golds) edged Canada (35), Argentina (33) and Cuba (33) in the battle for the third place. The Canadians, however, won the most total medals among the three, 152. For Cuba, it was their worst result since 1971 in terms of gold medals. ==Medal table== The ranking in this table is based on information provided by Panam Sports and is consistent with convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \\"nation\\" is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code. In badminton, boxing, judo, karate, racquetball, taekwondo, table tennis, and wrestling two bronze medals will be awarded for each event. Also in bowling, fencing and squash two bronze medals will be awarded in some events. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals will be greater than the total number of gold or silver medals. The following is the medal table maintained by the official website of the games. The British Virgin Islands won its first ever gold medal and its first ever Pan American Games medal after Chantel Malone won the women's long jump athletics event. Aruba also earned its first medal in the history of the Pan American Games, a bronze medal won by sailor Mack van den Eerenbeemt in men's RS:X. Barbados, Bolivia, Grenada and Paraguay won their first ever gold medals at the Pan American Games. ==Changes in medal standings== { style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:85%;\\" - !style=\\"width:8%\\"Ruling date !!style=\\"width:12%\\"Sport/Event !!style=\\"width:20%\\"Athlete (NOC) !!style=\\"width:2%\\" !!style=\\"width:2%\\" !!style=\\"width:2%\\" !!style=\\"width:4%\\"Total !!style=\\"width:50%\\"Comment -  colspan=8  List of official changes in medal standings (during the Games) -  rowspan=4  11 August 2019  rowspan=4  Bowling Men's doubles  style=\\"width:10px; text-align:left;\\"  ‚àí1    ‚àí1  rowspan=4 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Jean P√©rez Faure, a member of the Puerto Rican team that won the gold medal in the men's doubles has tested positive for doping with chlorthalidone, a prohibited diuretic.

A well known landmark, the boatshed was built in the 1930s, and since the 1940s has been owned mainly by the Nattrass family. By 2001, the boatshed had become very run down. Faced with government threats to demolish and remove it, the family began to rebuild it. At the suggestion of a family friend, the local federal member of parliament Julie Bishop, the boatshed was repainted in a bold blue colour. It was also given a facelift in 2015. In the 21st century, the boatshed has become an Australian icon, and star attraction for tourists visiting Perth from Asia. , the hashtag #blueboathouse had thousands of Instagram posts to its name. A CNN article published that month claimed that the boatshed was the most photographed travel attraction in Perth, ahead of Elizabeth Quay, Cathedral Square and the Bell Tower in Barrack Square. Another article published that month, on the website The Conversation, claimed that the boatshed had become Perth's second- most popular spot for tourist selfies, and that social media publicity about the boatshed had generated global awareness about Perth potentially worth millions of dollars. In March 2019, a group of tourists queuing up to take selfies at the boatshed included a woman from Singapore who told The West Australian, \\"Everyone from Singapore that visits Perth gets a photo here, it's all over social media.\\" One visitor from Thailand told ABC News in June 2019 that young couples from her country would travel to the boathouse to participate in pre-wedding photo shoots. Another visitor, from Malaysia, said that she had travelled to Perth specifically to take a photo with it. According to Tom Nattrass, images of the boatshed have been used in marketing material for Singapore Airlines, Qantas and in Japanese advertisements. At a meeting of the City of Perth held on 28 May 2019, the Commissioners of the City resolved, due to the increase in visitors to the boatshed, the nearby Eliza statue and the Old Swan Brewery, to spend AUD 400,000 on a new \\"stand- alone\\" solar powered toilet at Quarry Point, between the boatshed and the brewery. Construction of the toilet was due to be completed by August 2019. In mid-July 2019, the boatshed was temporarily and controversially wrapped in red plastic sheeting, as a tribute to the Manchester United football team, which was visiting Perth to play two friendly matches. On 14 July 2019, three of the team's players, Tahith Chong, Axel Tuanzebe and Joel Pereira, visited and were photographed at the wrapped boatshed. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Boathouses Edge Boatshed Category:Jetties in Perth, Western Australia Category:Swan River (Western Australia) ","title":"Crawley Edge Boatshed"},{"id":"61377231","text":"Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi is a Nigerian lawyer and civil rights activist.

He is known for his work on the Milwaukee Project, and for his subsequent conviction on charges of fraud and misuse of federal funds. As a result of this conviction, Heber was sentenced to a three-year term in a federal prison in Bastrop, Texas. ==Early life and education== Heber was born on January 12, 1932. He received his BA from the University of Arkansas in 1953. He then served as principal of the Manitoba School for Mental Deficiency for a year before enrolling at Michigan State University, where he received his master's degree in 1955. In 1957, he received his Ph.D. from George Peabody College. ==Academic career== In 1959, Heber joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison as coordinator of their special education program. He later chaired the President's Panel on Mental Retardation during the presidency of John F. Kennedy. Until December 1980, he was director of the University of Wisconsin's Center on Mental Retardation and Human Development. ===Milwaukee Project=== In the 1960s, Heber and his colleagues helped to initiate the Milwaukee Project, an early intervention program involving 20 ghetto children, with Heber later assuming the role of director of the project. A total of $14 million was eventually spent on the project, which led Ellis Batten Page to describe it as \\"grotesquely costly\\". Among the early results reported from the project were that the children's IQs had been raised by about 30 points, and that even children whose mothers had suffered from mental retardation were able to benefit from intensive mathematics education programs in the first several years of their lives. However, despite considerable popular media coverage of the project's purported results, few details of the project were reported in peer-reviewed journals. Soon after the project's results were first described in a brief 1972 conference presentation, its methodology was criticized by Page, who criticized it for \\"biased selection of treatment groups; contamination of criterion tests; and failure to specify the treatments\\". Kavale and Mostert concluded in 2004 that \\"the rather telling criticisms offered\\" of the project \\"were never really answered\\", despite Heber and his colleagues having numerous opportunities to do so. ==Criminal conviction== From January to October 1981, a series of articles were published in the Madison, Wisconsin newspaper The Capital Times revealing that Heber and his associates had inappropriately diverted research funds for personal use. Revelations from these stories included that Heber and his associate Patrick Flanagan had diverted $165,000 of such funds into their personal bank accounts, and that Heber's legal residence was in Colorado, despite the fact that he was being paid for \\"full-time\\" work in Wisconsin. Heber and several of his associates were subsequently charged with multiple federal offenses, including conspiracy to commit fraud, as well as multiple state charges, including embezzlement and tax evasion. On July 30, 1981, Heber was found guilty of multiple federal charges of diverting research funds in a federal court in Madison, for which he was later sentenced to three years in prison. Several months afterward, Heber was sentenced to four additional years in prison by a state court, to be served concurrently with his federal sentence. Heber and Flanagan were also both ordered to repay the funds that they had stolen. This conviction has led to questions about the validity of the Milwaukee Project's reported results. According to Cecil Reynolds and Marie Almond, \\"It is now questionable whether the project ever actually existed as it had been described by Heber.\\" Similarly, Gilhousen et al. argued in 1990 that \\"The failure of the principal investigator, Howard Garber, to respond to methodological criticisms and questions regarding the impact of Rick Heber's criminal activities on the integrity of the project data does nothing to quell the cloud of suspicion surrounding the research.\\" In contrast, Kavale and Mostert noted that \\"The consensus was that...it was a mistake to assume that convictions for fraud in any way implied the presence of fraudulent data.\\" ==References== Category:1932 births Category:Living people Category:Educational psychologists Category:American psychologists Category:University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison faculty Category:American people convicted of fraud Category:American people convicted of misusing public funds Category:People convicted of embezzlement Category:University of Arkansas alumni Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:Peabody College alumni ","title":"Rick Heber"},{"id":"61377302","text":"Adiri may refer to: * Adiri, Libya, a town in Libya * Adiri (Titan), a region on Saturn's moon Titan *people with the name: **Jonathan Adiri (born 1982), Israeli entrepreneur **Niv Adiri, Israeli sound engineer ","title":"Adiri"},{"id":"61377305","text":"For Dorian is a Canadian short drama film, directed by Rodrigo Barriuso and released in 2012.Cecilia Crespo, \\"For Dorian, por Rodrigo para conmover y hacernos pensar\\".

At the age of around 16 or 17, he taught himself to read and write. In 1869, he joined a narodnik circle in Moscow, organised by Sophia Bardina, which conducted propaganda among Moscow workers. The circle named itself the All-Russian Socialist Revolutionary Organisation. Alexeyev's role was to move from one town or village to another, take a job, talk to fellow workers, leave behind illegal literature, and move on. Arrested in February 1875, he was held in prison for two years, then arraigned with other members of the circle at the Trial of the 50, in March 1877. == His trial speech == His speech at his trial, delivered on 10 March, described in vivid language the squalid living conditions of Russia's working class. It concluded: \\"Russia's working people can rely only on themselves and no-one else, except the young intelligensia...Only they ... will march alongside us, without flinching, until the mighty hand of millions of working people is raised, and the yoke of despotism, ringed by soldiers' bayonets, is scattered to dust.\\" The speech was very soon printed on illegal printing presses. Three versions were circulating in pamphlet form in St Petersburg by June 1877. It was also smuggled abroad. Parts were printed in English translation in the Pall Mall Gazette on 20 April 1877. In 1900, Lenin lauded the speech as a \\"great prophecy\\". By the time of the Russian revolution, in 1917, it had been reprinted illegally more than 20 times by both Marxist and narodnik groups. == In exile == On 14 March, Alexeyev was sentenced to ten years in katorga. He was interned in Novo-Belogorodskaya prison, in European Russia, then transferred in autumn 1880 to Mtsensk political prison, then, soon after the assassination of the Tsar Alexander II, was moved again to Kara, in Yakutsk, in eastern Siberia.

The character has currently lost 3.5 out of 11 health points ‚Äì losing all would cost a life. In video games, a life is a play-turn that a player- character has, defined as the period between start and end of play. It is sometimes called a chance or a try, particularly in all-ages games, to avoid the morbid insinuation of losing one's \\"life\\". Generally, if the player loses all their health points, they lose a life. Losing all lives usually grants the player-character \\"game over\\", forcing them to either restart or stop playing. The number of lives a player is granted varies per game type. A finite number of lives became a common feature in arcade games during the 1980s and mechanics such as checkpoints and power-ups made the managing of lives a more strategic experience for players over time. Lives give novice players more chances to learn the mechanics of a video game, while allowing more advanced players to take more risks. ==History== Lives may have originated from the pinball mechanic of having a limited number of balls. A finite number of lives (usually three) became a common feature in arcade games. Much like in pinball games, the player's goal was usually to score as many points as possible with their limited number of lives. Later, checkpoints and saving allowed players that lost a life to continue the game at a specific point, rather than to start again. Refinements of health, defense and other attributes, as well as power-ups, made managing the player character's life a more strategic experience and made lost health less of the handicap it was in early arcade games. As video game design advanced, set numbers of lives became more uncommon. In modern games, checkpoints or save points are far more prevalent. Some games still track the number of deaths, offering rewards for completing objectives below a certain amount, or merely for bragging rights. ==Usage== It is common in action games for the player to have multiple lives and chances to earn more in-game. This way, a player can recover from making a disastrous mistake. Role-playing games and adventure games usually grant only one, but allow player-characters to reload a saved game. Lives set up the situation where dying is not necessarily the end of the game, allowing the player to take risks they might not take otherwise, or experiment with different strategies to find one that works. Multiple lives also allow novice players a chance to learn a game's mechanics before the game is over. Another reason to implement lives is that the ability to earn extra lives provide an additional reward incentive for the player. The problem that may arise when a player loses their lives frequently is that it discourages the player from continuing the game fairly. If losing a life causes a loss of equipment, skills or points, a player may feel inclined to reset a game to its previous save point whenever they are losing a life. In modern times, some free-to-play games, such as the Candy Crush Saga trilogy, capitalize on the multiple life system to create an opportunity to earn more microtransactions. In such games, a life is lost when the player fails a level, but once all lives are lost, the player is prevented from continuing the game for a temporary amount of time, instead of receiving a game over that would entail total failure or require a new beginning, as lives will re-generate automatically after a number of minutes or hours. Players can either wait for lives, attempt alternate activities to recover lives (such as asking for friends online to donate lives), or purchase items that can fully replenish lives or grant unlimited lives for a limited time to continue playing immediately. This system is more commonly known as The Energy system, which is popular in Free to play games. === Extra lives === A 1-up Mushroom from the Super Mario series. An extra life, also called a 1-up, is a video game item that increments the player character's number of lives. Because there are no universal game rules, the form 1-ups take varies from game to game, but are often rare and difficult items to acquire. The use of the term \\"1-up\\" to designate an extra life first appeared in Super Mario Bros., and the term quickly caught on, seeing use in both home and arcade video games. A number of games included an exploitable design flaw called a \\"1-up loop\\", in which it is possible to consistently acquire two or more 1-ups between a certain checkpoint and the following checkpoint. The player can thus acquire two 1-ups, make the character die, and restart from the first checkpoint with a net gain of one life; this procedure can then be repeated for as many lives as the player desires. ==References== Category:Video game terminology Category:Player progress tracking in video games ","title":"Life (video games)"},{"id":"61377537","text":"Heterodactylus septentrionalis is a species of lizard in the family Gymnophthalmidae.

It was the 68th running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The winner was Poet's Word, a five-year- old bay horse trained at Newmarket by Michael Stoute, ridden by James Doyle and owned by Saeed Suhail. Poet's Word's victory was the first in the race for both his owner and jockey. Stoute was winning the race for a record sixth time following his successes with Shergar (1981), Opera House (1993), Golan (2002), Conduit (2009) and Harbinger (2010). Poet's Word was the sixth five-year-old male to win the race following Aggressor, Mtoto, Opera House, Swain and Daylami. ==The contenders== The race attracted a field of seven runners, five from England and two from Ireland. There were no challengers from continental Europe. The race appeared to be sub-standard by King George standards as the only previous Group one winners in the race were Poet's Word, an improving five-year-old who had defeated Cracksman in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, and the Irish trained filly Hydrangea who had won the Matron Stakes and the British Champions Fillies & Mares Stakes in 2017. Another major contender was Crystal Ocean, a stablemate of Poet's Word, who had finished runner-up in the St Leger and recorded an impressive victory in the Hardwicke Stakes. John Gosden, who had won the race in 2017 with Enable was represented by Coronet, a four-year-old filly who won the Ribblesdale Stakes as a three- year-old and had been narrowly beaten in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. The only three-year-old in the field was Rotropovich, trained like Hydrangea by Aidan O'Brien, who had finished second in the Irish Derby. The other two runners were Salouen (runner-up to Cracksman in the Coronation Cup) and Desert Encounter. Crystal Ocean was made the 6/4 favourite ahead of Poet's Word on 7/4, Coronet on 15/2, Hydrangea on 10/1 and Rostropovich on 12/1. ==The race== Rotropovich took the early lead and set a strong pace from Salouen and Crystal Ocean. Hydrangea was settled in fourth place ahead of Coronet and Poet's Word while Desert Encounter started slowly and trailed the field. Shortly after entering the straight, Crystal Ocean overtook the weakening Rostropovich and opened up a clear advantage. Hydrangea was already well beaten and Salouen was unable to improve his position but Coronet began to stay on strongly. The only serious challenger to Crystal Ocean was Poet's Word who moved up on the wide outside and joined his stablemate a furlong from the finish. In a keenly contested struggle Poet's Word prevailed by a neck, with a gap of nine lengths back to Coronet in third. Four lengths back Salouen narrowly secured fourth place from Rostropovich while there were long gaps back to Desert Encounter and the tailed-off Hydrangea. ==Race details== * Sponsor: QIPCO * Purse: ¬£1,229,625; First prize: ¬£708,875 * Surface: Turf * Going: Good to Firm * Distance: 12 furlongs * Number of runners: 7 * Winner's time: 2:25.84 ==Full result== { class = \\"sortable\\"  border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse;\\" - 7d7; text-align:center;\\" ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" Pos. ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" Marg. ! style=\\"width:160px;\\" Horse (bred) ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" Age ! style=\\"width:160px;\\" Jockey ! style=\\"width:210px;\\" Trainer (Country) ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" Odds -  1   Poet's Word (IRE)  5  James Doyle  Michael Stoute (GB)  7/4 -  2  nk  Crystal Ocean (GB)  4  William Buick  Michael Stoute (GB)  6/4 fav -  3  9  Coronet (GB)  4  Olivier Peslier  John Gosden (GB)  15/2 -  4  4  Salouen (IRE)  4  Silvestre de Sousa  Sylvester Kirk (GB)  20/1 -  5  shd  Rostropovich (IRE)  3  Seamie Heffernan  Aidan O'Brien (IRE)  12/1 -  6  8  Desert Encounter (IRE)  6  Andrea Atzeni  David Simcock (GB)  33/1 -  7  18  Hydrangea (IRE)  4  Ryan Moore  Aidan O'Brien (IRE)  10/1 } * Abbreviations: nse = nose; nk = neck; shd = head; hd = head ==Winner's details== Further details of the winner, Poet's Word * Sex: Horse * Foaled: 5 April 2013 * Country: Ireland * Sire: Poet's Voice * Owner: Saeed Suhail * Breeder: Woodcote Stud ==References== King George 2018 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes Category:2010s in Berkshire King George VI ","title":"2018 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes"},{"id":"61377882","text":"Gabriel Myong is a Singaporean footballer currently playing as a midfielder for Geylang International. ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals - Geylang International 2019 Singapore Premier League 1000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì0010 - ! colspan=3  Career total !1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0 } ;Notes ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Singaporean footballers Category:Singapore Premier League players Category:Geylang International FC players Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Gabriel Myong"},{"id":"61377895","text":"The 2019 South Carolina State Bulldogs football team represented South Carolina State University in the 2019 NCAA Division I FCS football season.

In accordance with the South African Constitution of 1961, the South African Parliament had the task of electing a person as State President, the ceremonial head of state. On January 19, 1967, the caucus of parliamentarians from the National Party proposed D√∂nges to succeed Charles Robberts Swart as State President. In the group, he won against Jan de Klerk and against Jacobus Johannes Fouch√©, who was elected the South African head of state a year later in 1968. D√∂nges was elected as State President on February 26 with 163 votes in the second round against 52 votes for van der Byl, the United Party candidate. In May 1967, D√∂nges suffered a brain hemorrhage that plunged him into a coma, three weeks before his swearing in and the inauguration of his presidential term, which was to take place on June 1. As a result, the President of the South African Senate, Jozua Fran√ßois Naud√©, served as Acting State President until Donges was fit to take office. On June 10, D√∂nges suffered a delicate surgery on the brain. His condition improved, but on October 3, 1967, he suffered a stroke. It was through his lawyer that he resigned on December 6. He died on January 10, 1968 at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, without ever having regained consciousness and without being able to exercise the office of State President. == Bibliography == Category:Presidential elections in South Africa Category:1967 in South Africa ","title":"1967 South African presidential election"},{"id":"61377919","text":"The Things You Think I'm Thinking is a Canadian short drama film, directed by Sherren Lee and released in 2017.\\"Feature: Director Sherren Lee‚Äôs Give Us a Peek Inside ‚ÄúThe Things You Think I‚Äôm Thinking‚Äù\\".

The song was released on July 13, 2019, through Membran and Politur. The Swedish Grammy-nominated songwriter J√∂rgen Elofsson wrote the song. Hasselhoff chose Bl√ºmchen to sing the duet, when meeting backstage at one of the 90s Festivals. The track is a midtempo reggae fusion and pop song, which describes a couple leaving one another, having bad feelings afterwards. Critics were mixed, where some praised the summer tune being catchy and easy to listen, while others felt the 90s reggae fusion sound a bit out to date. The single release also marks a soft comeback for both of them. Hasselhoff and Bl√ºmchen promoted the single with performances at the \\"ZDF Fernsehgarten\\", \\"Willkommen bei Carmen Nebel\\" and music festivals. The music video, directed by photographer Reza Norifarahani, stars Hasselhoff and Bl√ºmchen in front of a simple white background on a photoshoot and singing session having fun and mocking around, with some of the songs' lyrics popping up. ==Background== When Bl√ºmchen has been asked by a fan at the program \\"MDR um 4 - G√§ste zum Kaffee\\" on May 14, 2019 with whom she would love to do a duet, she said that she would love to work with MC Fitti while hinting she was already planning a duet, but she wasn't allowed to talk about it yet. Hasselhoff revealed at \\"Willkommen bei Carmen Nebel\\", that he chose Bl√ºmchen to sing the duet, when meeting spontaneous backstage at one of the 90s Festivals. The song has been written by the Swedish Grammy-nominated songwriter J√∂rgen Elofsson and produced by J√ºrgen Engler. \\"Summer Go Away\\" is a midtempo reggae fusion and pop song. The official remix by Stereoact features a more modern up-to-date tropical house pop sound. The lyrics describe a couple leaving one another, having bad feelings afterwards. The song is inspired by super pop melodies with reggae fusion of the 90s, which were made famous most notably by Ace of Base. ==Release== The song has been digitally released and distributed on July 13, 2019 in Germany by Membran and Politur. ==Music video== The music video has been directed by the photographer Reza Norifarahani, who also did promotional photoshoots, prior the video shoot, with them. The copyright in this audiovisual recording is owned by Luna Studios, along with Norifarahani, Weimar Pictures and under exclusive licence to Membran Entertainment Group GmbH.

It solely stars Hasselhoff and Bl√ºmchen in front of a simple white background on a photoshoot and singing session having fun and mocking around, with some of the songs' lyrics popping up. The video used the Remix by Stereoact for the music video, possibly due to the more modern up-to-date tropical pop sounds. ==Live performances== Hasselhoff and Bl√ºmchen promoted the single with performances at the \\"ZDF Fernsehgarten\\" and music festivals.

Over 2,500 swell across Turkish-Syrian border in one day, the highest ever recorded. * July, 2012: Refugee flow ahead of fighting in Aleppo. * September, 2012: UNHCR reports that more than 11,000 Syrians flee into Turkey in a day's time. == Settlement (repatriation, transit) == In 2014, the capacity of the camps established in 2012 and 2013 became insufficient. In 2014, refugees according to their own preferences begin to migrate across provinces. About 30% live in 22 government-run camps near the Syrian border. The number of refugees in transit to Europe dramatically increased in 2015. \\\\ === Citizenship === Up to 300,000 Syrian refugees living in Turkey could be given citizenship under a plan to keep wealthy and educated Syrians in the country. == Conditions == Suru√ß refugee center Syrian refugee center on the Turkish border 80 kilometres from Aleppo, Syria (3 August 2012).

Over 13 million Syrians received aid from the Turkish Aid Agency (AFAD). Turkey has spent more than any other country on Syrian refugee aid, and has also been subject to criticism for opening refugee camps on the Syrian side of the border. Financial aid from other countries to Syrian Refugees has been limited, though ‚Ç¨3,200,000,000 was promised by the EU in November 2015. In March 2016, the EU and Turkey agreed on the EU-Turkey Statement, which involved a number of political concessions as well as 'another ‚Ç¨3 billion in aid, if Turkey agreed to a readmission of Syrians arriving in Greece and tighter border controls.' === Employment === Under Turkish law, Syrian refugees cannot apply for resettlement but only temporary protection status. Registering for temporary protection status gives access to state services such as health and education, as well as the right to apply for a work permit in certain geographic areas and professions. Over a third of urban refugees are not registered. A study which was supported by the Istanbul University Scientific Research Projects unit and conducted by academics from a number of universities, revealed that the vast majority of Syrians in Turkey are employed in unregistered work for significantly lower wages compared to their Turkish counterparts. However compared to the increase in refugees, benefits towards them weren't increased as much as only 712,218 were given residency permits only 56,024 work permits were given to the Syrians by 2017. === Housing === Turkey's response to the refugee crisis is different from most other countries. As a World Bank report noted: It is a non-camp and government financed approach, as opposed to directing refugees into camps that rely on humanitarian aid agencies for support. === Racism === Influx of Syrian refugees to Turkey has significantly increased anti-Arabian sentiments in the country. == Education == The goal of the Turkey is providing efforts to ensure that all refugee children can access a form of learning and be fully integrated into the formal education system. The facts are: As of [unknown date], Currently, 30% of Syrian refugee children have access to education, 4,000 businesses have been opened, and several Syrian refugee camps have grown into small towns with amenities from healthcare to barber shops.[?citation] As of March 2018, about 60% (600,000 primary and secondary education) of Syrian school-aged children under temporary protection remain in school.

The method works by taking several images, after each such capture moving (\\"shifting\\") the sensor to a new position. In digital colour cameras that employ pixel shift, this avoids a major limitation inherent in using Bayer pattern for obtaining colour, and instead produces an image with increased colour resolution and, assuming a static subject or additional computational steps, an image free of colour moir√©. Taking this idea further, sub-pixel shifting may increase the resolution of the final image beyond that suggested by the specified resolution of the image sensor. Additionally, assuming that the various individual captures are taken at the same sensitivity, the final combined image will have less image noise than a single capture. This can be thought of as an averaging effect (for instance, in a pixel shift image composed of four individual frames with a classic Bayer pattern, every pixel in the final colour image is based on two measurements of the green channel). ==List of cameras implementing pixel shift== * Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II * Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II * Olympus OM-D E-M1X * Panasonic Lumix DC-G9 * Panasonic Lumix DC-S1 * Panasonic Lumix DC-S1R * Panasonic Lumix DC-S1H * Pentax K-3 II * Pentax K-1 * Pentax K-70 * Pentax KP * Pentax K-1 II * Sony Œ±7R III * Sony Œ±7R IV * Hasselblad H6D-400c MS ==See also== * Pixel shifting ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:Digital photography Category:Image processing ","title":"Pixel shift"},{"id":"61378064","text":"Ronnie Lombard (born 28 July 1928) was a South African gymnast.

Sierra Club is a pending United States Supreme Court case involving the appropriation of funds used to expand the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier under the presidency of Donald Trump, colloquially known as the Trump wall. Congress did not grant direct appropriations to fund expansion of the wall, leading Trump to sign the National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States in February 2019 which, citing his powers under the National Emergency Act, took approximately of funds appropriated to military spending towards construction of the wall. Numerous states and non-governmental organizations filed suit shortly after the order, resulting in a Ninth Circuit ruling that deemed the transfer of funds inappropriate under the Appropriations Clause and leading to the Supreme Court challenge. ==Background== Portions of the U.S.-Mexico border have had barriers in place to restrict illegal crossings of immigrants from Mexico since 2006, though only about half of the border is barriered as of 2018. One of Donald Trump's presidential campaign pledges was to greatly expand and fortify the border wall to further restrict illegal immigration into the U.S. Shortly after his inauguration to office in January 2017, Trump issued Executive Order 13767 instructing the government to begin construction of the expanded wall, but as the Order lacked any funding directive, no such construction could begin. By 2018, Trump sought direct funding for the border wall construction from Congress to be given to the Department of Homeland Security through appropriations bills, with an estimated required to complete full construction of the wall; this included of new wall and improvements to of existing structures. For the 2018 United States federal budget that passed in March 2018, while Trump had requested a first trunch of for construction for the wall, these funds were denied by the Democratic party-controlled House of Representatives, and instead only was allocated for primary and secondary fencing, barrier planning and design, and border security technology, but no wall construction. As the 2019 United States federal budget was formulated, Trump again asked for for construction of the wall which the Senate had confirmed but the House refused to allocate, and Trump stated he would veto any budget without fund for the border wall. While parts of the budget were passed through the year, including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in August 2019, most other parts of the federal budget remained in limbo as the Preisdent and Congress engaged in partisan fighting over the border wall funding. This conflict was a major contributing factor to the 2018‚Äì19 government shutdown. By February 2019, both the House and Senate had came to a compromise position on the border wall, allocating about for a stretch of the border wall. While Trump signed the compromised budget and border wall bill to end the shutdown, he then announced his intentions to declare a national emergency as to evoke powers of the National Emergency Act and re-allocate funds to build the border wall. ===National Emergency Order and subsequent lawsuits=== Trump issued the National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States on February 15, 2019, two days after signing the 2019 budget into law. The order directed that about of previously allocated funds from Congress to departments within the Executive branch be re-allocated to construction of the border wall. This included from the Department of Defense's military construction, for the Department of Defense's drug interdiction activities, and from the Treasury Department's forfeiture fund. In the case of the , Trump argued that Section 8005 of the 2019 Defense Appropriations Bill, which states \\"[t]hat such authority to transfer may not be used unless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for which originally appropriated and in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the Congress.\\" allowed him to transfer funds from the Defense Department to the Department of Homeland Security for the building the border wall as an unforeseen requirement. The order was immediately challenged in a number of cases. Two challenges were filed at the United States District Court of the Northern District of California; one led by a group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, and a second by a coalition of 20 states led by California. Both suits challenged the re- appropriation of funds as unconstitutional under the Appropriations Clause. Judge Haywood Gilliam presided over both cases. Judge Gilliam issued a preliminary injunction in the Sierra Club case on May 24, 2019, blocking the use of the targeted funds for border wall construction on the basis that the plaintiff's challenge had a good chance of succeeding. Gilliam asserted that the re-appropriation of funds by Trump violated the separation of powers. Gilliam also stated that Trump's claim of being able to reallocate funds under the National Emergency Act for \\"unforeseen\\" events was belied since he had been asking for funding since 2018. Judge Gilliam's injunction was upheld on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on July 3, 2019. The administration petitioned the Supreme Court to challenge the injunction, and in a 5‚Äì4 ruling issued July 26, 2019, put a stay on the injunction as litigation continued, on the basis that the plaintiffs in the case may not have standing to challenge Trump's order. In the interveing year, about of new border wall was constructed. Judge Gilliam issued joint rulings on both cases on June 28, 2019, ruling against Trump's re-allocation of of Defense Department funds set by Congress. The administration appealed both cases to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit on review issued their ruling on both cases on June 26, 2020, finding in a 2‚Äì1 ruling in both that the re- appropriation of funds was unconstitutional violating the separation of powers. The Ninth also affirmed that the NGOs had standing in their suit as the ongoing wall construction was impacting the environment of which they had a vested interest in, and thus were damaged by it. As a result, the Sierra Club case plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court to reconsider their prior stay based on the findings of the Ninth Circuit in July 2020, but the Court declined to lift the stay in a 5‚Äì4 decision issued on July 31, 2020. ==Supreme Court== The Trump adminstration petitioned the Supreme Court challenging the Ninth Circuit decision of both the Sierra Club and the states' case, questing both the standing of the plaintiffs in the original suits, and the authority for the re-allocation of appropriated funds pursuant to Section 8005 of 2019 NDAA was lawful. The Supreme Court certified the case on October 19, 2020 to be heard during the 2020‚Äì21 term. ==References== Category:2020 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:Trump administration controversies Category:Immigration to the United States Category:Donald Trump litigation ","title":"Trump v.

Gates was also a member of Cal's 2002 NCAA Tournament team. ==Coaching career== After graduation, Gates served as a coaching intern for the Los Angeles Clippers before heading to the college ranks for two graduate assistant coaching positions at Marquette and Florida State for a season each. He would return to his alma mater as a full assistant coach in 2005 under Mike Montgomery. From 2007 to 2009, Gates served as an assistant coach at Northern Illinois before another two-year stint as an assistant coach at Nevada. In 2011, he rejoined the Florida State staff as an assistant coach under Leonard Hamilton and was part of the Seminoles' 2011‚Äì12 ACC Tournament championship squad. He was a part of seven Seminole NCAA Tournament teams, including two Sweet 16 and one Elite Eight runs. During a January 10, 2017 contest between Florida State and Duke Gates was shoved by Blue Devils guard Grayson Allen as the guard went for a loose ball near the Florida State bench.

He is standing in the middle of the photograph, second from the left in the back row. Andrew \\"Andy\\" Shearer (January 26, 1864 - February 6, 1944) was a Canadian lumber merchant and amateur ice hockey player. He was the father of Hollywood actresses Norma and Athole Shearer and sound designer and recording director Douglas Shearer, and an older brother of zoologist Cresswell Shearer. ==Biography== Andrew Shearer was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1864 to James Traill Shearer and Eliza Shearer (n√©e Graham).James Traill Shearer findagrave.com His father was born in Rosegill near Dunnet in Caithnesshire in northern Scotland in 1822 and his mother was born in Montr√©al in 1827. James T. Shearer was a carpenter and lumber manufacturer and Andrew Shearer later worked as a lumber merchant and as a director of the James Shearer Company in Montr√©al.Men of Canada. Cooper, John Alexander. 1901‚Äì1902. pg. 206. The Canadian Historical Company (Montreal and Toronto). He married Edith Mary Fisher in Montr√©al in 1899 and they had three children: Douglas (b. 1899), Athole (b. 1900) and Norma (b. 1902). The family lived in a well-to-do neighborhood of Montr√©al, but around 1919 the Canadian economy fell into a slump and he sold the business and lost most of the family money in the deal. He was forced to move the family to a more modest part of Montr√©al, and his wife Edith soon took her two daughters to New York City to find jobs in the entertainment industry, whereas Douglas stayed with his father. All of his three children would later pursue careers within the film industry in Hollywood, Norma and Athole as actresses and Douglas as a sound designer and recording director. Mental health issues also came to plague the family. Andrew Shearer was allegedly prone to manic depression and Norma described how he used to move like a \\"ghost like presence\\" around the house.Norma Shearer: A Life. Lambert, Gavin. 1990. Alfred A. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group (New York) (978-0-394-55158-6). Both his daughters also came to suffer from mental instabilities. Andrew Shearer followed his family to California and died in Los Angeles in 1944 aged 80. He is buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California where his wife Edith and two daughters also rest. === Career in ice hockey === While in his 20s in Montr√©al Andy Shearer played ice hockey in the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada, an early league organized to determine the Canadian champion. Shearer played with the Montreal Victorias between 1883‚Äì1891 and in 1888 he captained the club to a second place finish behind the Montreal Hockey Club, scoring four goals in seven games in the process. Shearer played at the forward position. ==Statistics== { BORDER=\\"0\\" CELLPADDING=\\"0\\" CELLSPACING=\\"0\\" width=\\"30%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"2\\"  League - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

In the adventure, the players take the role of some members of the Explorer Corps who are trying to sabotage a Clan Smoke warship and escape safely. The players encounter security guards as well as dinsosaurs. ==Reception== In the February 1996 edition of Arcane (Issue 3), Alex Bund gave a thumbs up, saying, \\"All in all this is a brilliant supplement - one which any Mech Warrior referee should consider as an addition to his collection, especially if his players get a little too cocky about their abilities. Let them see how good they really are.\\" Bund concluded by giving this adventure an above average rating of 8 out of 10. In the May 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue #229), Rick Swan called this \\"an action-packed adventure... good, goofy fun, and easy to run.\\" Swan warned that the authors of the adventure highly recommended that potential referees should read five other supplements before running this adventure, and concluded, \\"That's a lot of homework.\\" ==References== Category:Science fiction role-playing game adventures ","title":"Living Legends (MechWarrior)"},{"id":"61378345","text":"Prabodh Chandra was a freedom fighter and an Indian politician.Biodata of Lok Sabha member ==Early Life== Born at Rawalpindi (now in Pakistan) on 24 October 1911, to Satya Dev, Headmaster of a Government High School and Durga Devi, he did his matriculation from the Government High School, Gujrat, Pakistan in 1927 and his Intermediate as a private candidate in 1930 before completing his graduation and Post Graduation from the F.C.

It is native to tropical East Africa. It was first described in 1920 by the English botanist John Hutchinson, who named it Cyclostemon argutus. It was later transferred to the genus Drypetes. ==Description== Drypetes arguta is a small tree or large straggling shrub, growing to a height of about . The bark is grey, either smooth or with fine vertical furrows. The leaves have short stalks and a pair of yellow linear stipules at the base, and are arranged alternately on slender, greyish twigs. They are bright green, up to long, elliptical to lanceolate, with uneven bases and attenuated tips. There are glands at the tips of the marginal teeth. The flowers grow in clusters or singly in the axils of the leaves. They are unisexual, with male flowers being on a different tree from female flowers. They are yellowish-green and fragrant, and are followed by globular, fleshy fruit up to in diameter which turn orangish- red as they ripen. ==Distribution and habitat== Drypetes arguta is native to eastern Africa where its range extends from Tanzania and Zimbabwe, southwards to Mozambique, Swaziland, and South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape). It grows in forests and alongside water-courses, at altitudes of up to . It is also a major constituent of the flora of the Southern African Sand Forest, a habitat consisting of woodland growing on ancient sand dunes located on the border between southern Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal. ==Uses== Sections of branches of this tree have traditionally been used in hut construction, and the wood has also been used to make sticks. The fruits are edible and have been used to make a fermented alcoholic drink. ==References== Category:Drypetes Category:Flora of South Africa Category:Trees of Africa Category:Plants described in 1866 ","title":"Drypetes arguta"},{"id":"61378365","text":"The 1983 USFL Draft was the first Collegiate Draft of the United States Football League (USFL).

Depending upon the definition delineating its boundaries, the Hudson Valley encompasses a growing metropolis which is home to between 3 and 3.5 million residents centered along the north-south axis of the Hudson River. ==Pre-Columbian era== The Hudson Valley was inhabited by indigenous peoples ages before Europeans arrived. The Algonquins lived along the Hudson River, with the three subdivisions of that group being the Lenape (also known as the Delaware Indians), the Wappingers, and the Mahicans. The lower Hudson River was inhabited by the Lenape Indians. In fact, the Lenape Indians were the people that waited for the explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano onshore, traded with Henry Hudson, and sold the island of Manhattan. Further north, the Wappingers lived from Manhattan Island up to Poughkeepsie. They lived a similar lifestyle to the Lenape, residing in various villages along the river. They traded with both the Lenape to the south and the Mahicans to the north. The Mahicans lived in the northern valley from present-day Kingston to Lake Champlain, with their capital located near present-day Albany. The Lenape, the Wappingers, and the Mahicans were speakers of languages that were part of Algonquin language family. As such, the three subdivisions were able to communicate with each other. Their relations with each other were mostly peaceful. However, the Mahicans were often in direct conflict with the Mohawk Indians to the west, which was a part of the Iroquois nation. The Mohawks would sometimes raid Mahican villages from the west. The Algonquins in the region lived mainly in small clans and villages throughout the area. One major fortress was called Navish, which was located at Croton Point, overlooking the Hudson River. Other fortresses were located in various locations throughout the Hudson Highlands. Villagers lived in various types of houses, which the Algonquins called Wigwams. The houses could be circular or rectangular. Large families often lived in longhouses that could be a hundred feet long. At the associated villages, the indigenous peoples grew corn, beans, and squash. They also scavenged for other types of plant foods, such as various types of nuts and berries. In addition to agriculture, they also fished for food in the river, focusing on various species of freshwater fish, as well as several variations of striped bass, sturgeon, herring, and shad. Oyster beds were also common on the river floor, which provided an extra source of nutrition. Land hunting consisted of turkey, deer, rabbits, and other animals. ==Exploration, colonization, and revolution: 1497 to 1800Exploration of the Hudson River=== In 1497, John Cabot traveled along the coast and claimed the entire country for England; he is credited with the Old World's discovery of continental North America. In 1524, Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano visited the bay of New York, in service of Francis I of France. On his voyage, Verrazzano sailed north along the Atlantic seaboard, starting in the Carolinas. Verrazzano sailed all the way to New York Harbor, which he thought was the mouth of a major river. Verrazzano sailed his boat into the harbor and possibly sailed over what is now Battery Park (Battery Park was created with landfill). However, Verrazzano never sailed up the Hudson River and left the harbor shortly thereafter. A year later, Estevan Gomez, a Portuguese explorer sailing for Spain in search of the Northwest Passage visited New York Bay. The extent of his explorations in the bay is unknown. Yet as Charles H. Winfield has noted, as late as 1679, there was a tradition among the First Nations that the Spanish arrived before the Dutch, and that from them it was that the natives obtained the maize or Spanish wheat. Maps of that era based on Gomez's map labeled the coast from New Jersey to Rhode Island, as the \\"land of Estevan Gomez\\". In 1598 some Dutch employed by the Greenland Company wintered in the Bay. Eleven years later, the Dutch East India Company financed English navigator Henry Hudson in his attempt to search for the Northwest Passage. During this attempt, Henry Hudson decided to sail his ship up the river that would later be named after him. As he continued up the river, its width expanded, into Haverstraw Bay, leading him to believe he had successfully reached the Northwest Passage. He docked his ship on the western shore of Haverstraw Bay and claimed the territory as the first Dutch settlement in North America. He also proceeded upstream as far as present-day Troy before concluding that no such strait existed there. ===Dutch colonization=== After Henry Hudson realized that the Hudson River was not the Northwest Passage, the Dutch began to examine the region for potential trading opportunities. Dutch explorer and merchant Adriaen Block led a voyage up the lower Hudson River, the East River, and out into Long Island Sound. This voyage determined that the fur trade would be profitable in the region. As such, the Dutch established the colony of New Netherland. The Dutch settled three major outposts: New Amsterdam, Wiltwyck, and Fort Orange. New Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Hudson River, and would later become known as New York City. Wiltwyck was founded roughly halfway up the Hudson River between New Amsterdam and Fort Orange. That outpost would later become Kingston. Fort Orange was the outpost that was the furthest up the Hudson River. That outpost would later become known as Albany. New Netherland and its associated outposts were set up as fur-trading outposts. The Dutch attempted to form a trade alliance with the Mahicans, angering the Mohawk nation and provoking hostilities between the two tribes. The Natives began to trap furs at a quicker pace and then sold them to the Dutch for luxuries. This trade would eventually deplete the supply of those animals in their territory, decreasing the food supply in the process. The focus on furs also made the Natives economically dependent on the Dutch for trade. The Dutch West India Company operated a monopoly on the region for roughly twenty years before other businessmen were allowed to set up their own ventures in the colony. New Amsterdam quickly became the colony's most important city, operating as its capital and its merchant hub. The other outposts functioned as settlements in the wilderness. At first, the colony was made up of mostly single adventures looking to make money, but over time the region transitioned into maintaining family households. New economic activity in the form of food, tobacco, timber, and slaves was eventually incorporated into the colonial economy. In 1647, Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took over management of the colony. He found the colony in chaos due to a border war with the English along the Connecticut River, and Indian battles throughout the region. Stuyvesant quickly cracked down on smuggling and associated activity before expanding the outposts along the Hudson River, especially Wiltwyck at the mouth of Esopus Creek. Stuyvesant attempted to establish a fort midway up the Hudson River. However, before that could be done, the British invaded New Netherland via the port of New Amsterdam. Given that the city of New Amsterdam was largely defenseless, Stuyvesant was forced to surrender the city and the colony to the British. New Amsterdam and the overall colony of New Netherland was renamed New York, after the Duke of York. The Dutch regained New York temporarily, only to relinquish it again a few years later, thus ending Dutch control over New York and the Hudson River. ===British colonization=== Under British colonial rule, the Hudson Valley became an agricultural hub, with manors being developed on the east side of the river. At these manors, landlords rented out land to their tenants, letting them take a share of the crops grown while keeping and selling the rest of the crops. Tenants were often kept at a subsistence level so that the landlord could minimize his costs. They also held immense political power in the colony due to driving such a large proportion of the agricultural output. Meanwhile, land west of Hudson River contained smaller landholdings with many small farmers living off the land. A large crop grown in the region was grain, which was largely shipped downriver to New York City, the colony's main seaport, for export back to Great Britain. In order to export the grain, colonial merchants were given monopolies to grind the grain into flour and export it. Grain production was also at high levels in the Mohawk River Valley. During the French and Indian War in the 1750s, the northern end of the valley became the bulwark of the British defense against French invasion from Canada via Lake Champlain.Thomas, A and Smith, P; Upstate down: thinking about New York and its discontents University Press of America 2009, p78 ===Revolutionary War=== Map of Washington's retreat through New York and New Jersey The Hudson River was a key river during the Revolution. The Hudson River was important for a few reasons. First, the Hudson's connection to the Mohawk River allowed travelers to get to the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River eventually. In addition, the river's close proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain would allow the British navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City. In doing so, the British, under General John Burgoyne's strategy, would be able to cut off the patriot hub of New England (which is on the eastern side of the Hudson River) and focus on rallying the support of loyalists in the South and Mid-Atlantic regions. The British knew that total occupation of the colonies would be infeasible, which is why this strategy was chosen. As a result of the strategy, numerous battles were fought along the river, including several in the Hudson Valley. George Washington's Continental Army had retreated north to White Plains, New York in 1776, as the British pursued him and his army. While the British advanced towards him, Washington decided to take a stand in White Plains. In October 1776, Howe's army advanced from New Rochelle, and Scarsdale. Washington set up defensive positions in the hills around the village. When the British attacked, the British managed to break the Continental's defenses at Chatterton Hill, now known as Battle Hill. Once the British managed to reach the top of the hill, Washington was forced to retreat. The main positive for Washington after this battle was that he managed to avoid being enveloped by the British Army. Washington ordered his men to retreat across the Hudson River, eventually reaching New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Because Washington was able to preserve what was left of his army, this retreat would eventually lead to the successful surprise attacks on Trenton, New Jersey and Princeton, New Jersey in December of the same year. Fort Washington in Upper Manhattan later fell after this retreat. Once Washington retreated to Pennsylvania, New England militias had to fortify the Hudson Highlands, a choke point on the river north of Haverstraw Bay. As a result, the Continentals started building Fort Clinton on the other side of the river from Fort Montgomery. In the year 1777, Washington expected General Howe to sail his army north to Saratoga in order to meet up with General Burgoyne. This would result in the Hudson River being sealed off. However, Howe surprised Washington by sailing his army south to Philadelphia, conquering the Patriot capital. Washington was out of position and sought to defend Philadelphia, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Howe left Sir Henry Clinton in charge of a smaller force to be docked in New York City, with the permission to strike the Hudson Valley at any time. On October 5, 1777, Clinton's army did so. At the Battle of the Hudson Highlands, Clinton's force sailed up the Hudson River and attacked the twin forts. Along the way, the army looted and pillaged the village of Peeksill. The Continentals fought hard at the battle, but they were badly outnumbered and were fighting in unfinished forts. Washington's men were caught between defending Philadelphia and defending the Hudson Valley. In the end, the British took the fort, as well as taking Philadelphia around the same time. However, Clinton and his men returned to New York City soon afterward. The Continentals later decided to build the Great West Point Chain in order to prevent another British fleet from sailing up the Hudson River in a similar manner as during the previous battle. The chain that was by the forts was simply circumvented by the British army via attacking on the shores. The new chain, designed by engineer Captain Thomas Machin, could have theoretically been lowered in order to let friendly ships sail down the river, but the chain was never tested, and was later discarded after the war. The United States Military Academy on the Hudson River at West Point was established in 1802. During Benedict Arnold's control over West Point, he began weakening its defenses, including neglecting repairs on the West Point Chain. At the time, Arnold was secretly loyal to the British, and planned to hand off West Point's plans to British major John Andr√© at Snedeker's Landing (or Waldberg Landing) on the wooded west shore of Haverstraw Bay. On September 21, 1780, Andr√© sailed up the river on to meet Arnold. The next morning, an outpost at Verplanck's Point fired on the ship, which sailed back down river. Andr√© was forced to return to New York City by land; however, he was captured near Tarrytown on September 23 by three Westchester militiamen, and later was hanged. Arnold later fled to New York City using HMS Vulture. ==Industrial Revolution and 20th century== Following the building of the Erie Canal, the area became an important industrial center. The canal opened the Hudson Valley and New York City to commerce with the Midwest and Great Lakes regions.Stanne, Stephen P., et al. (1996). The Hudson: An Illustrated Guide to the Living River, p. 120. Rutgers University Press. . However, in the mid 20th century, many of the industrial towns went into decline. The first railroad in New York, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, opened in 1831 between Albany and Schenectady on the Mohawk River, enabling passengers to bypass the slowest part of the Erie Canal. The Hudson Valley proved attractive for railroads, once technology progressed to the point where it was feasible to construct the required bridges over tributaries. The Troy and Greenbush Railroad was chartered in 1845 and opened that same year, running a short distance on the east side between Troy and Greenbush, now known as East Greenbush (east of Albany). The Hudson River Railroad was chartered the next year as a continuation of the Troy and Greenbush south to New York City, and was completed in 1851. In 1866 the Hudson River Bridge opened over the river between Greenbush and Albany, enabling through traffic between the Hudson River Railroad and the New York Central Railroad west to Buffalo. When the Poughkeepsie Bridge opened in 1889, it became the longest single-span bridge in the world. The New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway began at Weehawken Terminal and ran up the west shore of the Hudson as a competitor to the merged New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. Construction was slow, and was finally completed in 1884; the New York Central purchased the line the next year. During the Industrial Revolution, the Hudson River became a major location for production. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast. Hundreds of factories were built around the Hudson, in towns including Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Kingston, and Hudson. The North Tarrytown Assembly (later owned by General Motors), on the river in Sleepy Hollow, was a large and notable example. The river links to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes, allowing manufacturing in the Midwest, including automobiles in Detroit, to use the river for transport. With industrialization came new technologies for transport, including steamboats for faster transport. In 1807, the North River Steamboat (later known as Clermont), became the first commercially successful steamboat. It carried passengers between New York City and Albany along the Hudson River. Tourism became a major industry as early as 1810. With convenient steamboat connections in New York City, and numerous attractive hotels in romantic settings, tourism became an important industry. Early guidebooks were providing suggestions on their itinerary. Middle-class people who read James Fenimore Cooper's novels, or saw the paintings of the Hudson River School, were especially attracted.Richard H. Gassan, The Birth of American Tourism: New York, the Hudson Valley, and American Culture, 1790‚Äì1835 (2008) In 1965, governor Nelson Rockefeller proposed the Hudson River Expressway, a limited- access highway from the Bronx to Beacon. An 8-mile section was built from Ossining to Peekskill, now part of U.S. Route 9; the rest of the highway was never built due to local opposition. ===Hudson River School=== Robert Havell, Jr., View of the Hudson River from Tarrytown, c. 1866Frederic Edwin Church, Morning, Looking East over the Hudson Valley from Catskill Mountains, 1848 In the early 19th century, popularized by the stories of Washington Irving, the Hudson Valley gained a reputation as a somewhat gothic region inhabited by the remnants of the early days of the Dutch colonization of New York (see, e.g., The Legend of Sleepy Hollow). The area is associated with the Hudson River School, a group of American Romantic painters who worked from about 1830 to 1870. Hudson River School paintings reflect three themes of America in the 19th century: discovery, exploration, and settlement. The paintings also depict the American landscape as a pastoral setting, where human beings and nature coexist peacefully. Hudson River School landscapes are characterized by their realistic, detailed, and sometimes idealized portrayal of nature, often juxtaposing peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness, which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley just as it was coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature in the form of the American landscape was an ineffable manifestation of God, though the artists varied in the depth of their religious conviction. They took as their inspiration such European masters as Claude Lorrain, John Constable and J. M. W. Turner. Their reverence for America's natural beauty was shared with contemporary American writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The D√ºsseldorf school of painting had a direct influence on the Hudson River School. The school characterizes the artistic body, its New York location, its landscape subject matter, and often its subject, the Hudson River. While the elements of the paintings were rendered realistically, many of the scenes were composed as a synthesis of multiple scenes or natural images observed by the artists. In gathering the visual data for their paintings, the artists would travel to extraordinary and extreme environments, which generally had conditions that would not permit extended painting at the site. During these expeditions, the artists recorded sketches and memories, returning to their studios to paint the finished works later. The artist Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School. Cole took a steamship up the Hudson in the autumn of 1825, the same year the Erie Canal opened, stopping first at West Point, then at Catskill landing. He hiked west high up into the eastern Catskill Mountains of New York State to paint the first landscapes of the area. The first review of his work appeared in the New York Evening Post on November 22, 1825. At that time, only the English native Cole, born in a landscape where autumnal tints were of browns and yellows, found the brilliant autumn hues of the area to be inspirational. Cole's close friend, Asher Durand, became a prominent figure in the school as well. Painters Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were the most successful painters of the school. ==Contemporary== On October 3, 2009 the Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge reopened as the Walkway over the Hudson. It is a pedestrian walkway over the Hudson River that opened as part of the Hudson River Quadricentennial Celebrations, and it connects over 25 miles of existing pedestrian trails. ==References== Category:Hudson Valley Category:History of New York (state) ","title":"History of the Hudson Valley"},{"id":"61378557","text":"Ossufo Momade (born 30 January 1961) is a Mozambican politician.

It was the 69th running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The winner was Enable, a five-year-old bay mare trained at Newmarket by John Gosden, ridden by Frankie Dettori and owned by Khalid Abdullah. Enable's victory was the sixth in the race for Dettori, the fourth for Gosden and the third for Khalid Abdullah. Enable became the third horse after Dahlia and Swain to win the King George twice, and the first to win the race in non-consecutive years. She was the second five-year-old mare to win the race after Park Top in 1969. ==The contenders== The race attracted a field of eleven runners, five from England and four from Ireland, one from France and one from Japan. The favourite for the race was Enable, a five-year-old mare who had won the race as a three-year-old in 2017 and had won two editions of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in the interim. On her most recent start she had won the Eclipse Stakes. Her main threat appeared to come from Crystal Ocean who had been narrowly beaten in the 2018 edition of the race and had won the Prince of Wales's Stakes on his last appearance. Crystal Ocean was rated the best racehorse in the world in the July edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings.https://www.ifhaonline.org/resources/WTRRankings/LWBRR_PressRelease.asp?pid=96 Another major contender was the improving five-year-old gelding Defoe who had won the Coronation Cup and the Hardwicke Stakes in his last two starts. The other two British-trained runners were Salouen, who was contesting the race for the third time and the Ormonde Stakes winner Morando. Ireland was represented by the four-horse entry from Aidan O'Brien's Ballydoyle stable headed by the Epsom Derby winner Anthony Van Dyck. The other Ballydoyle contenders were Magic Wand (Ribblesdale Stakes), Hunting Horn (Hampton Court Stakes) and Norway (third in the Irish Derby). The French challenger was Waldgeist a winner of three Group 1 races while Japan's entry was the 2017 Japan Cup winner Cheval Grand. Enable was made the 8/15 favourite ahead of Crystal Ocean on 7/2, Anthony Van Dyck on 7/1, Defoe on 10/1 and Waldgeist on 12/1. ==The race== Norway took the early lead and set a \\"blistering\\" pace from Magic Wand, Hunting Horn and Anthony Van Dyck. Crystal Ocean and Waldgeist raced in mid-division while Enable, who had been drawn on the wide outside settled towards the rear of the field. The leading group began to tire approaching the final turn and Crystal Ocean moved up on the outside to take the lead in the straight, closely followed by Enable and Waldgeist. The last quarter mile saw a sustained struggle between Crystal Ocean and Enable before the mare prevailed by a neck. Waldgeist was a length and three quarters back in third with the others finishing well strung out. Salouen got the better of Hunting Horn for fourth, with Cheval Grand taking sixth ahead of Norway while the remainder were tailed off. ==Race details== * Sponsor: QIPCO * Purse: ¬£1,229,625; First prize: ¬£708,875 * Surface: Turf * Going: Good to Soft * Distance: 12 furlongs * Number of runners: 11 * Winner's time: 2:32.42 ==Full result== { class = \\"sortable\\"  border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse;\\" - 7d7; text-align:center;\\" ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" Pos. ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" Marg. ! style=\\"width:160px;\\" Horse (bred) ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" Age ! style=\\"width:160px;\\" Jockey ! style=\\"width:210px;\\" Trainer (Country) ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" Odds -  1   Enable (GB)  5  Frankie Dettori  John Gosden (GB)  8/15 -  2  nk  Crystal Ocean (GB)  5  James Doyle  Michael Stoute (GB)  7/2 -  3  1¬æ  Waldgeist (GB)  5  Pierre-Charles Boudot  Andr√© Fabre (FR)  12/1 -  4  7  Salouen (IRE)  5  Jim Crowley  Sylvester Kirk (GB)  80/1 -  5  nk  Hunting Horn (IRE)  4  Seamie Heffernan  Aidan O'Brien (IRE)  66/1 -  6  3¬Ω  Cheval Grand (JPN)  7  Oisin Murphy  Yasuo Tomomichi (JPN)  33/1 -  7  7  Norway (IRE)  3  Wayne Lordan  Aidan O'Brien (IRE)  66/1 -  8  14  Morando (FR)  6  P J McDonald  Andrew Balding (GB)  66/1 -  9  nk  Defoe (IRE)  5  Andrea Atzeni  Roger Varian (GB)  10/1 -  10  5  Anthony Van Dyck (IRE)  3  Ryan Moore  Aidan O'Brien (IRE)  7/1 -  11  11  Magic Wand (IRE)  4  Donnacha O'Brien  Aidan O'Brien (IRE)  28/1 } * Abbreviations: nse = nose; nk = neck; shd = head; hd = head ==Winner's details== Further details of the winner, Enable * Sex: Mare * Foaled: 12 February 2014 * Country: United Kingdom * Sire: Nathaniel * Owner: Khalid Abullah * Breeder: Juddmonte Farms ==ReferencesSee also== *2019 British Champions Series King George 2019 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes Category:2010s in Berkshire King George VI ","title":"2019 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes"},{"id":"61378584","text":"Margaret Bryan is a retired British diplomat.

Her companions were Anne Carey, Elizabeth Roper, Mary Middlemore, Elizabeth Harcourt, and Mary Woodhouse.Linda Levy Peck, Court Patronage and Corruption in Early Stuart England (London, 1990), p. 69: Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1791), p. 228.See Helen Margaret Payne, 'Aristocratic Women and the Jacobean Court, 1603-1625 ', Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, PhD (2001), p. 283 for a list of the queen's maids of honour. In 1605 her cousin Philip Gawdy heard she might marry Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby, but he married Elizabeth Montagu.Isaac Herbert Jeayes, Letters of Philip Gawdy (London, 1906), p. 150. Gargrave was of sufficient status to give the queen New Year gifts, and in 1608/9 gave her a rich and expensive petticoat embroidered with Venice gold, silver, and coloured silks.Jemma Field, 'The Wardrobe Goods of Anna of Denmark', Costume, 51:1 (March 2017), p. 21 & Supplement p. 33 no. 310.

John Finet described the reception of Isabelle Br√ªlart, the wife of French ambassador Gaspard Dauvet, Sieur des Marets, at Denmark House in December 1617. She arrived by coach at the old portico built by Protector Somerset on the Strand, rather than by boat on the Thames. He brought her and her servants to a chamber in the first court. Lady Blanche Arundell, Mistress Barbara Sidney (daughter of the Viscountess Lisle), Mistress Southwell of the queen's privy chamber (later Lady Dudley), and Gargrave joined her. A gentleman usher then took Br√ªlart to the queen in the Privy Chamber.John Finet, Finetti Philoxenis (London, 1656), p. 40.

The strip ran Monday to Saturday for the three to four weeks leading up to Christmas Eve, and often promoted the latest Disney release or re-release. The strips were usually not published on the newspaper's comics page; they appeared at the bottom of the page somewhere else in the paper, so that the reader would have to hunt for it, and not-coincidentally pass by some of the Christmas advertising. The strip appeared every year until 1987. In 2017, the Christmas stories were collected in a hardback volume, Disney's Christmas Classics, published by IDW Publishing. The collection includes all of the Christmas stories except for 1986's story based on Song of the South. ==Development== Unlike most Disney comic strips, Disney Christmas Story actively mixed characters from different Disney films -- for example, in 1962, Ludwig Von Drake saved Princess Aurora from Maleficent's spell, and in 1976, the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio helped Santa Claus foil an evil plot hatched by Captain Hook, the Big Bad Wolf and Honest John to steal his toys and hold them for ransom. The 1963 sequence was the only comic strip appearance of the popular Disney comics character Li'l Bad Wolf, and the 1971 story features a rare comic-strip appearance by the Beagle Boys. The strip was written by Frank Reilly from its inception in 1960 until 1975, and then by Carl Fallberg from 1976 to 1984. Floyd Norman wrote the 1985 and 1986 sequences, and Fallberg wrote the last story in 1987. When Norman was given the assignment to write the Christmas Story in 1985, he was bothered by the way that the stories mixed up characters from different films. He recalled in a 2013 blog post, \\"I couldn't help but find this approach somewhat bizarre. Mickey and Pluto didn't fit in the same world as Dumbo and the seven dwarfs certainly didn't mix well with Jaq and Gus Gus from Cinderella. I decided if I was going to write a holiday story the characters used would have to be consistent... No more of this wacky 'mix and match' approach to Disney storytelling.\\" Norman's first story featured only characters from One Hundred and One Dalmatians, and his second characters from Song of the South.A detailed description of Norman's Song of the South story, which was not reprinted in the Christmas Classics collection, is included here: In 1992, the strip returned as Disney Holiday Story, telling more straightforward tales starring the characters from the most recent Disney animated release. This strip lasted for six years, until 1997. All six storylines were written by Floyd Norman (with Karen Kreider on the first year), and illustrated by Richard Moore. ==Disney Christmas Story== {  margin:auto;\\" - ! Title ! Dates !

The Article 98 of the Constitution of Costa Rica is the article that regulates free citizen association in political parties. The article was controversial for decades as, in its original writing, prohibited the existence of the Costa Rican Communist Party. Prohibition that was in place from the promulgation of the Constitution on November 8, 1949 until its reform on June 4, 1975. ==Text== The original text said: Which can be translated as: The 5698 bill of June 4, 1975 changed the text to: Or: A further reform on July 2, 1995 by the bill 7675 added: \\"Los partidos pol√≠ticos expresar√°n el pluralismo pol√≠tico, concurrir√°n a la formaci√≥n y manifestaci√≥n de la voluntad popular y ser√°n instrumentos fundamentales para la participaci√≥n pol√≠tica.

Its creation and the exercise of its activity will be free within the respect of the Constitution and the law. Its internal structure and functioning must be democratic.]\\" ==History== After the Costa Rican Civil War of 1948, the agreements of the Pact of the Mexican Embassy signed by the leaders of the enemy sides Jos√© Figueres Ferrer of the National Liberation Army and Manuel Mora Valverde of the Costa Rican Communist Party, established that would be respected the lives, freedoms and right to political participation of all sides. This was not kept and the new Junta government chaired by Figueres, the Founding Junta of the Second Republic immediately persecuted and imprisoned the communists and their party was banned. The first antecedent that the article had was the decree with the rank of law (since the Junta had suspended the Constitution of 1871 and enjoyed absolute powers) No. 1056 that expressly outlawed the People's Vanguard Party. During the fierce persecution, Vanguardia Popular continued to organize in hiding. Mora goes into exile while Arnoldo Ferreto Segura is elected secretary general while in prison. Subsequently, a general political amnesty would be granted for communists and Calderonistas in the administration of Mario Echandi that would normalize the policy and promote the transition to democracy, but although free, the communists would continue to be banned and their attempts to reorganize were stopped by the application of the article 98 in the elections of 1953, 1958, 1962 and 1966. As time passes, the system would tolerate the existence of political parties that were a clear screen of the old Popular Vanguard. The Socialist Action Party was founded in 1969, successfully electing Manuel Mora and Arnoldo Ferreto as deputies, and other leftist groups exist before 1975 although none was officially communist. The discussion about the right of the communists to participate in elections began to be discussed since the 1970 election when Figueres himself (who was a presidential nominee) advocated for it. Christian Democratic candidate Jorge Arturo Monge Zamora did the same in 1974. During the 1974-1978 legislature under the presidency of Daniel Oduber Quir√≥s, who sponsored the reform, the article was changed in 1975 to allow the communists to officially return to political life. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica Category:Anti-communism ","title":"Article 98 of the Constitution of Costa Rica"},{"id":"61378781","text":"Liquor is an alcoholic drink produced by distillation of grains, fruit, or vegetables that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation.

Ball was a member of the National Transport Workers Federation. He was an athlete and a 'championship sprinter' of the Midlands. According to the WSPU pamphlet 'Torture In An English Prison' neither he nor his family had any history of mental ill health. == Imprisonment and consequences == Ball's arrest and imprisonment in December 1911, was for breaking two panes of the Home Office windows in protest at the jailing of another man, Alan MacDougall who had supported the suffragettes attending political meetings. Ball also was against the Manhood Suffrage Bill which 'would bar the passage of a measure for votes for women'.Force feeding similar to that used on William Ball A first offence, but with a sentence of two months at Pentonville prison, Ball was denied the rights to wear his own clothes, like the women suffragettes at the same time. He refused prison clothing and went on hunger strike, was force-fed for the first time on Christmas Day and then twice daily for 37 days. This 'disgusting' process meant being held down by two warders, ' a tube thrust up his nose and down his throat' . Ball was forbidden from writing to his wife, Jennie and denied visits, despite her frequent letters of appeal to the prison governor, Major Owen Davies. With four dependent children and only one wage, Jennie wisely wrote to the Prison Commission, Home Office with a request to insure Ball's life - which would require a doctor's visit to assess his health. This too was denied with a statement from the prison that he was in is 'usual health' and due for discharge on 21 February; but on 12 February she was then informed that he was certified insane and transferred to a pauper's asylum. Solicitor Arthur Marshall, husband of WSPU's Kitty Marshall took Jennie to the Home Office to find out Ball was at Colney Hatch, Barnet. On visiting, Ball's wife found him 'very seriously ill and in an exceedingly emaciated condition with nose and throat swollen and inflamed from forcible feeding.' He could not talk, but in whispers said he had been in a locked punishment cell on two occasions. Arthur Marshall represented Ball's wife to the Lunacy Commission and got permission to move Ball to a private nursing home, paid for by his suffragette sympathisers. == \\"Torture In An English Prison\\" == The WSPU handbill, written by Henry Nevison, journalist and sympathetic to women's suffrage, described Ball's experiences and blamed the Home Secretary Reginald McKenna. It emphasised his working class origins, and lack of influence in society. It said Ball 'dared to protest against injustice, Mr. McKenna had him inhumanely punished and tortured till his mind, not his principles and courage, gave way under his sufferings\\". The WSPU made the point that he was secretly moved to the lunatic asylum. It also included Mary Leigh's description of force feeding: > 'the drums of the ears seem to be bursting, and there is a horrible pain in > the throat and breast' The Men's League for Women's Suffrage was told about the case at a March 1912 meeting in the Queen's Hall, Langham Place, London. This was on the same day that the shop windows in Regent Street, Oxford Street and Picadilly area were being broken by small groups of suffragettes, resulting in charges of 'conspiracy' on the women leaders of WSPU. The leaflet theme Brutality on the Increase and outrage at the treatment of Ball, was supported by influential male speakers: George Lansbury, M.P. for Bow and Bromley (Labour), Charles Mansell-Moullin and Victor Duval (brother of Elsie Duval), a founder of the Men's Political Union group. At her eighth trial, for suffragette activism, at Bow Street Court, for breaking Post Office windows, Ellen (Nellie//Nelliy) Crocker, cousin of Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence denounced the hard sentences given to Ball (and MacDougall) as part of the justification for her own actions. The leaflet can be seen at the Museum of London Ball gets a specific mention in the National Archive records of the 1000 women's suffrage supporters arrested and imprisoned during 1906-14. == References == Category:British suffragists Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:English suffragettes Category:Force-feeding Category:Torture in England Category:Hunger strikers ","title":"William Ball (suffragist)"},{"id":"61378858","text":"Story in Taipei (also translated as Story of Taipei) is a 2017 Taiwanese film written and directed by Huang Ying-hsiung (ÈªÉËã±ÈõÑ).

They mainly originate from Western Crete, but are also widespread in central and eastern Crete. Rizes (Greek: œÅŒØŒ∂ŒµœÇ = roots) are the foothills of the mountains.

Another view argues that ¬´the songs of the roots¬ª of the ancestors, were called by the people Rizitika-ika (-ŒπŒ∫Œ±) it's a plural suffix of adjectives which indicates nouns that derive from or belong to the stem of the adjective, in this case rizit- ika (œÅŒπŒ∂ŒØœÑ-ŒπŒ∫Œ±) are those who derive from the roots, ie the songs.

The songs do not always need to rhyme, and the verse does not always have fifteen syllables. ==Songs== Digenes is a monument of the Cretan music and for many the epitome of the Acritic circle, its lyrics are considered flawless. It presents the supernatural aspect that endue Digenes, not with feats and achievements, but by misplacing the feeling of fear. Men are terrified at the sight of the earth that is about to welcome them, and shudders at the sight of the grave slab that is about cover them, in the case of Digenes those feelings are misplaced. As he is dying, he does not ask for divine help to take him to heaven and relieve him of his misery, but he wishes to climb there on his own. { colspan=\\"2\\" border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"4\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse;\\" - style=\\"border: none; background: none;\\" ¬´·Ωâ ŒîŒπŒ≥ŒµŒΩ·Ω¥œÇ œàœÖœáŒøŒºŒ±œáŒµ·øñ, Œ∫Œπ ·º° Œ≥·øÜœÇ œÑœåŒΩŒµ œÑœÅŒøŒºŒ¨œÉœÉŒµŒπ Œ∫Œπ ·º° œÄŒªŒ¨Œ∫Œ± œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÑœÅŒπœáŒπ·æ∂, œÄ·ΩºœÇ Œ∏·Ω∞ œÑœåŒΩŒµ œÉŒ∫ŒµœÄŒ¨œÉŒ∑; ŒìŒπŒ±œÑŒØ Œ±œÄœå \`Œ∫ŒµŒπŒ¨ œÄŒøœÖ Œ∫ŒøŒØœÑŒµœÑŒ±Œπ, ŒªœåŒ≥ŒπŒ± ·ºÄŒΩœÑœÅŒµŒπœâŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖ ŒªŒ≠ŒµŒπ. \\\\- ŒùŒ¨ 'œáŒµŒΩ ·º° Œ≥·øÜœÇ œÄŒ±œÑŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ±, Œ∫ŒπŒÑ ·ΩÅ Œø·ΩêœÅŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ∫Œ≠ŒªŒπŒ± ŒΩ·Ω∞ œÄŒ¨œÑŒøœÖ œÑ·Ω∞ œÄŒ±œÑŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ±, ŒΩŒ¨ \`œÄŒπŒ±ŒΩŒ± œÑ·Ω∞ Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ∫Œ≠ŒªŒπŒ± ŒΩ' ·ºÄŒΩŒ≠Œ≤Œ±ŒπŒΩŒ± 'œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œø·ΩêœÅŒ±ŒΩœå, ŒΩ·Ω∞ Œ¥ŒπœÄŒªœâŒ∏·ø∂ ŒΩ·Ω∞ Œ∫Œ¨œÑœÉœâ ŒΩ·Ω∞ Œ¥œéœÉœâ œÉŒµ·øñœÉŒºŒ± œÑ' Œø·ΩêœÅŒ±ŒΩŒø·ø¶.¬ªPraktika Tetartou Symposiou Poiƒìsƒìs: aphier≈çma sto dƒìmotiko tragoudi, Ekdoseis \\"Gn≈çsƒì\\", 1985. p. 422. ¬´Digenes is dying, and the earth is terrified and the grave slab shudders, how she is gonna cover him?

The trail is a collaboration between local governments and the state, with development coordinated by the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation (NCDPR). ==History== In 2008, NCDPR along with the High Country Council of Governments developed a regional trail plan for North Carolina's High Country. A potential trail route along the Northwestern Peaks of the state was identified in the plan. In 2011, the Watauga County Tourism Development Authority published the Boone Area Outdoor Recreation Plan, which included a proposal for a Northern Peaks Trail. In 2017, NCDPR, the Watauga County Tourism Development Authority, Ashe County, the Ashe County Chamber of Commerce, the West Jefferson Tourism Development Authority, the Town of Boone, and High Country Pathways, Inc jointly commissioned a master plan for the Northern Peaks Trail. The master plan concluded the trail was eligible for state trail status and proposed its designation as part of the State Trail System. On July 1, 2019, the North Carolina General Assembly formalized the proposal by establishing Northern Peaks State Trail, and directed NCDPR to coordinate its development. ==ReferencesNorthern Peaks Trail * The Northern Peaks Trail Master Plan * High Country Regional Trails Plan Category:State parks of North Carolina Category:Protected areas of Ashe County, North Carolina Category:Protected areas of Watauga County, North Carolina Category:Protected areas established in 2019 Category:Hiking trails in North Carolina Category:2019 establishments in North Carolina ","title":"Northern Peaks State Trail"},{"id":"61379006","text":"Mihajlo Biberƒçiƒá (born 23 September 1968) is a retired Serbian football striker.Weltfussball He represented Yugoslavia U-16 in 3 games having scored once in 1985.Mihajlo Bibercic at 11v11.com ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Serbian footballers Category:FK Radniƒçki 1923 players Category:FK Borac ƒåaƒçak players Category:FC Prishtina players Category:√ç√ær√≥ttabandalag Akraness players Category:Knattspyrnuf√©lag Reykjav√≠kur players Category:Brei√∞ablik UBK players Category:Stjarnan players Category:Association football forwards Category:Serbian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Iceland Category:Serbian expatriate sportspeople in Iceland ","title":"Mihajlo Biberƒçiƒá"},{"id":"61379017","text":"Aliabad Yek (, Romanized as ƒÄlƒ´ƒÅbƒÅd-e Yek; also known as ‚ÄòƒÄlƒ´ƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Deh Bakri Rural District, in the Central District of Bam County, Kerman Province, Iran.

On 26 February 1960, the An-10 operating this flight crashed short of the airport runway while on final approach. 24 passengers and eight crew members were killed, one passenger survived. The Air Accident Investigation Commission concluded the cause of the accident was a combination of design flaw and icing. ==Accident== Flight 315 departed Vnukovo Airport at 14:38 Moscow time, and was cleared to climb to 7,000 meters. At 16:35 as the airliner approached Lviv the crew received clearance to descend to 4,000 meters. Weather was reported as a cloud base of 150-200 meters in icing conditions with visibility at three km. The descent was normal and the pilot reported reaching the marker beacon at an altitude of 200 meters, the flight was then cleared to land. When the aircraft penetrated the cloud base the crew switched to visual flight rules (VFR). While descending through 95 meters the flaps were set to 45 degrees and the Antonov began a rapid pitch down. The crew briefly regained control but the nose pitched down again and at 16:57 impacted the ground 1,400 meters short of the runway with pitch down attitude of 20-25 degrees. ==Aircraft== Construction of the AN-10 involved, serial number 9401801-18-01, was completed at the Voronezh aircraft factory on 24 January 1960 and it was transferred to the civil air fleet. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had sustained a total of 109 flight hours. ==Investigation== Because the aircraft was in operation for only six days after release from the factory the Air Accident Investigation Commission decided it was unlikely that mechanical failure was the root cause of the accident. The evidence gathered from the investigation of Aeroflot Flight 315 (1959) on 26 February 1960 three months earlier was further scrutinized. Testing eventually revealed that icing of the horizontal stabilizer created a supercritical angle of attack, that caused a sudden pitch down of the aircraft when the flaps are lowered to the maximum setting of 45 degrees. A contributing factor was the speed with which the flaps deployed. 35 degrees in eight seconds was deemed disproportionally rapid. To abate this concern ice protection systems for the stabilizer were improved and selection of flaps beyond 15 degrees in known icing conditions was disallowed. ==See also== *Aeroflot accidents and incidents *Aeroflot accidents and incidents in the 1960s ==References== Category:November 1960 events Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1960 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the Soviet Union 315 (1960) Category:1960 in the Soviet Union Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Antonov An-10 ","title":"Aeroflot Flight 315 (1960)"},{"id":"61379168","text":"Grzegorz Paw≈Çuszek (born 25 August 1970) is a retired Polish football striker.Weltfussball ==References== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Polish footballers Category:Lechia Gda≈Ñsk players Category:Zawisza Bydgoszcz players Category:GKS Katowice players Category:G√≥rnik Konin players Category:Polonia Warsaw players Category:Stomil Olsztyn (football) players Category:FC 08 Homburg players Category:Eisenh√ºttenst√§dter FC Stahl players Category:Unia Tczew players Category:Association football forwards Category:Polish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Polish expatriate sportspeople in Germany ","title":"Grzegorz Paw≈Çuszek"},{"id":"61379188","text":"Bwlch Rangers A.F.C. are a Welsh football club from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire in West Wales.

It commemorates the signing of the PKWN Manifesto on 22 July 1944.. ==History== The 5 year anniversaries in Warsaw, 1949. Known officially as the Manifesto of the Polish Committee of National Liberation, its writers were part of the Soviet-backed Polish government-in-exile in London known commonly by its acronym, the PKWN. The government of Stalin in the Soviet Union was originally critical of State National Council (KRN) until it developed ideas for Poland after the war and found it to be a catalyst for its plans. A delegation came to the Soviet capital of Moscow on 22 May 1944 for talks with Stalin and Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov.\\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918‚Äì1945 623-625\\" This was the framework for the signing of the manifesto between the KRN and the Union of Polish Patriots\\"Mrozik 2017 49\\" in Che≈Çm on 22 July. The document helped establish a mandate to assist in the liberation of occupied Polish territories from the ruling Military Administration and the General Government. It also condemned the April Constitution of Poland and Sanation movement as \\"fascist\\" and repealed it in favor of the 1921 March Constitution while urging support for the Red Army.. It also was the official founding date for the exiled PKWN government installed in Lublin on 26 July under the KRN and later a cabinet under Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz. On 31 December, the KRN replaced the PKWN into the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland led by Edward Os√≥bka-Morawski. The first anniversary was celebrated a year later and officially replaced the previous National Independence Day holiday on 11 November 1952. It was celebrated for the last time in 1989 as it was disestablished by the government on 28 April 1990.W kraju i ≈õwiecie, w: PrzeglƒÖd Katolicki, nr 15-16/1990, s.16 ==National observances== First Secretary Edward Gierek visiting workers in Zak≈Çadach. The holiday was the most important of all public holidays in the People's Republic, with elaborate events and customs being held on this day. There were organized fairs, folk events, and many large investments conducted by the government. A wreath laying ceremony takes place at national monuments such as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Victory Square. ===PZPR and government events=== A solemn meeting of the Polish Sejm and the PZPR Central Committee takes place on the morning or afternoon of the holiday. The Marshal of the Sejm is the keynote speaker in the former's case while the First Secretary of the Central Committee speaks at the latter event. All members of the PZPR Politburo are also on hand for the holiday. The First Secretary usually issued awards to distinguished individuals on the holiday. This occurred on the eve of the holiday in 1974 when Edward Gierek awarded Leonid Brezhnev with the Virtuti Militari, which also coincided with the latter's state visit to Warsaw that day.–ü–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –ü–ù–† –æ—Ç 21 –∏—é–ª—è 1974 –≥–æ–¥–∞ ‚Ññ 0-1227 The award would later be revoked and declared invalid by the President of Poland on 10 July 1990.–ü–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ü–æ–ª—å—à–∞ –æ—Ç 10 –∏—é–ª—è 1990 –≥–æ–¥–∞ ‚Ññ 0-116-215-621-90 ===Civil-military parade=== The Milenium parade in 1966. Every year on this holiday, a military parade takes place before the party and state leadership in Warsaw and demonstrations by members of the working-class, patriotic organizations and working people were held in all districts and district capitals. The military parade takes place on Warsaw's Parade Square, which is in front of the monumental Palace of Culture and Science (PKiN). Many anniversary parades have taken place in the holiday's history including on the following occasions: *1959 - Celebrated the Silver jubilee of the manifesto's signing. The parade was attended by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev *1966 - The Millennium Parade in honor of the anniversary of the Christianization of Poland which in the early 60s as well as that specific year. The parade inspector was Marshal of Poland Marian Spychalski while it was commanded by Major General Czes≈Çaw Waryszak. Besides troops of the LWP being on parade, it also featured ceremonial units and cadets of military academies dressed in Polish historical military uniforms dating back to the Piast dynasty. The parade is today regarded as the largest military parade organized in the history of Poland. *1974 - Celebrated the 30th anniversary of the manifesto's signing. The parade was attended by Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. It was inspected by General of the army Wojciech Jaruzelski and commanded by Major General W≈Çodzimierz Oliwa. *1984 - Celebrated the Ruby jubilee of the manifesto's signing. The big three figures who are on the grandstand in front of the palace are the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Prime Minister and the Chairman of the Council of State. The parade starts with the troops presenting arms to the tune of Poland Is Not Yet Lost performed by the Central Band of the Polish People's Army and the other bands that make up the massed bands of the Warsaw Garrison under the baton of the Senior Director of Music of the Bands of the Polish Armed Forces. A 21-gun salute is fired at this point. After this the troops, still in the present arms position look to the right to await the arrival of the Minister of National Defence to receive the report from the Commander, Warsaw Military District. Once this is done, the minister and the commander greet the formations on parade in their respective cars with Czolem ≈ªo≈Çnierzy (the Polish language version of Greetings Soldiers) while the inspection march (usually Marsz Generalski) plays in the background. After the inspection, the parade, after sloping arms, then executes order arms and stands at ease to listen to the minister's official speech. After the speech, a flypast of Polish Air Force aircraft takes place. After the flyover, the parade commander orders the start of the parade in the following manner: ::Parade... attention! Slope.... arms! Distance by a single lineman! The parade will now march off in quick time for the ceremonial past in review by battalions, Right... turn! By your units, eyes to the right, by the left, forward, quick march! Next, the parade car leading and the Representative Honor Guard Regiment of the Polish People's Army marching as the first contingent to the tune of Warszawianka. It is then followed by a combined colour guard holding historical Polish military colours from the Second Republic, the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War. Contingents from other agencies and units also march off, including the Milicja Obywatelska, the Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza, the General Staff Academy, the Dzerzhinsky Political-Military Academy, the Territorial Defense Forces and the Internal Military Service. After the ground column concludes, a mobile column of armoured units and the coastal defence troops and marines takes place. After this is done the bands march off to make way for the civil parade of athletes and civilians. This continues until the people leave the square to which the party leadership then leaves the grandstand to go into the palace. ===Cultural events=== Local festivities in 1984. Many youth and cultural events take place, including events in-line with traditional Polish customs. The Polish Socialist Youth Union and the preceding Union of Polish Youth often spearheaded any youth events throughout the country. The National Summer School and Student Youth Games were opened at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium. A solemn concert of choirs and orchestras and the Polish National Ballet are held at the Teatr Wielki (Grand Theater) in the evening. The government has completed and opened cultural buildings/structures in time for the holiday, such as the following:Karol Nawrocki, ‚ÄûImieniny‚Äù i ‚Äûurodziny‚Äù systemu komunistycznego w Polsce, \\"Histmag.org\\", 12.02.2008. *Poniatowski Bridge (1946) *Warsaw W-Z Route (1949) *Marsza≈Çkowska Housing District (1950) *10th- Anniversary Stadium (1955) *Palace of Culture and Science (1955) *≈Åazienkowski Bridge (1974)RozporzƒÖdzenie Prezesa Rady Ministr√≥w z dnia 30 listopada 1972 r. w sprawie utworzenia, zniesienia i zmiany granic niekt√≥rychmiast In 1984, a military tattoo took place in the 10th-Anniversary Stadium on the eve of the holiday featuring the Band of the Polish Air Force, the Band of the Navy of Poland, the Band of the Polish Border Guard, many of the 16 regional garrison bands performing all in front of First Secretary Wojciech Jaruzelski. ==See also== *Republic Day (East Germany) *October Revolution Day *Liberation Day (Hungary) *Victory Day (9 May) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Poland's National Day Aka Warsaw's National Day (1955) *National Day In Warsaw (1959) *March of the Polish People's Army (1950s) *CA≈ÅA DEFILADA TYSIƒÑCLECIA PA≈ÉSTWA POLSKIEGO/MILLENNIUM OF THE POLAND - PARADE (1966) *Polish Millenium Parade 966 - 1966 (English subtitles) *Wielka Parada Orkiestr Wojska Polskiego Poland Category:Public holidays in Poland Category:1945 establishments in Poland Category:Recurring events established in 1945 Category:Festivals established in 1945 Category:1952 establishments in Poland Category:Recurring events established in 1952 Category:Festivals established in 1952 Category:July observances Category:Summer events in Poland Category:Military parades in Poland ","title":"National Day of the Rebirth of Poland"},{"id":"61379265","text":"Edward Eugene Bogdanski (July 30, 1921 ‚Äì December 31, 1989) was an American professional basketball player.

Calipari is an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology at the Vanderbilt University Brain Institute. She looks to understand the brain circuitry that is used for adaptive and maladaptive processes in reward, associative learning and motivation. == Early life and education == Calipari is the oldest daughter of John Calipari, an American basketball coach, and Ellen Calipari. Calpiari took part in athletics whilst attending White Station High School. She played softball, basketball and hockey. She was part of the first generation in her family to attend to become an academic. Calipari attended University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she studied biology and played for the UMass Minutewomen. Calpari was a graduate student at Wake Forest University, where she earned a doctorate in neuropharmacology under the supervision of Sara Jones. She used analytical chemistry and operant behaviour studies to understand how dopamine kinetics are impact by drug self-administration. Calipari was a postdoctoral research associate in a genetics laboratory at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She focussed on how to understand neural circuit activity and transcriptional programs. == Research and career == Calipari joined Vanderbilt University in 2017. She works on the brain circuitry that is used for adaptive and maladaptive neurological processes including reward, associative learning and motivation, and how these are associated with psychiatric disease. In Tennessee, where Calipari grew up, there are more prescriptions for opioids than there are people living in the state. Calipari believes that drug addiction is a decision-making disease: people make decisions to choose to invest in drugs over other expenses. She looks at which parts of the brain are involved with making decisions, and how to reprogram them to make other choices. Her lab use fibre photometry calcium imaging, which monitors neural activity in subpopulations of neurons using an optical fibers, optogenetics, and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. She is interested in why women are vulnerable to drug addiction, and how the immune system could be used to fight the opioid epidemic. She believes that through the platform of sport it is possible to communicate the dangers of drug addiction. Whilst women are more susceptible to drug addiction, the majority of addiction studies are focussed on men. This means that medication development has focussed on correcting addiction in men, and may explain why women do not respond to treatment in the same way as men. Calipari found that when hormones related to fertility are high, women make stronger associations to clues in their environment and more likely to seek rewards, which makes them more prone to drug addiction and relapse. Her research can be used by treatment centres to educate women about their decision making mechanisms. == Selected publications == *L√≥pez AJ, Siciliano CA, Calipari ES.

In 1907 she married James Charles Downes, a retired widower with four adult children. She died 21 May 1920. She joined the Southport Society of Natural Science in 1902 and continued as a member after her marriage. The society included a botanical special interest section. Her skill as an artist is shown in her surviving paintings. There are 314 watercolours, held initially at the Botanic Garden Museum in Southport but now at the Atkinson in Southport. These are mainly of flowers but also include sea shells, bird's eggs and butterflies. Herbarium sheets that match some of the paintings are also in the collection. The paintings are dated between 1890 to 1917. They are predominately of plants from the Southport coast but also include some cultivated plants and ones from places that she either visited or received specimens from. These include Wensleydale, Dovedale, Bescar, Morecombe, Burnley, Ashover and Bridlington in the UK and Mount Pilatus and Rigi in Switzerland. As well as the artistic quality of her work, the watercolour are significant as evidence of the flora of the Sefton coast, a sand-dune system prior to changes caused by agriculture and urban growth during the twentieth century. ==Legacy== In 2016 and 2017, exhibits at the Atkinson were funded by The Royal Society, as one of their Local Heroes projects.

He also produced fiction, assembled anthologies and wrote a biography of William Shakespeare. He was a lifelong socialist, supporter of the Labour Party, and an anti-nuclear campaigner who set up a branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He was chairman of the Exmoor Society and campaigned for the preservation of its open spaces. ==Early life and family== Samuel Burton, known as Tim, was born on 30 November 1919 at Caverswall, Staffordshire, England. His father had various occupations and his mother was a village schoolteacher. He received a scholarship that enabled him to attend Longton High School and then Queen's College, University of Cambridge. He joined the British Army in 1939 but was discharged in 1941 due to injury. He met his future wife Phyl while he was in a military hospital. ==Career== Blundell's School, Tiverton Burton first taught at King Edward VI school in Stafford before becoming head of English at Blundell's School in Devon from 1945 to 1964. He subsequently worked at St Luke's College of Education in Exeter and as a lecturer for the British Council and the Workers' Educational Association.SH (Tim) Burton. John Burton, The Guardian, 14 December 2005. Retrieved 30 July 2019. When not teaching he produced a large number of English language textbooks, as well as anthologies, biography, fiction, edited editions of classic works and books on Devon and Cornwall. He compiled anthologies of science fiction that he used for teaching purposes and thought effective because so many pupils already read the genre. His first published book was The Criticism of Poetry (1950) which remained in print for nearly four decades. By working evenings, weekends and holidays, and only in longhand because he could not stand typewriters, Burton managed to produce nearly 50 books of various kinds, saying in 1984 that, \\"at present I have 14 royalty-earning books in print [that] bring me in a gross income of about ¬£3,000 a year ... to live, I have to write three books a year, and that's a cracking pace.\\" Exmoor landscape He was a Shakespeare scholar and edited an edition of Henry V that was published in Longman's Heritage of Literature series in 1975. The less serious Shakespeare Detective and Other Short Stories contained four mystery stories authored by Burton and set in modern Stratford upon Avon but drawing on the town's connections with William Shakespeare. It was published in Longman's Structural Readers series in 1986 where the text is designed to suit particular levels of English language proficiency. Shakespeare's Life and Stage (1989), the fruit of a lifetime's study, was a major work that included an extended discussion of the bard's education,\\"Shakespeare's Education, or the Circular Argument\\" by Christopher Dams in but the poor sales were a great disappointment to the author. He wrote extensively on Devon and Cornwall including three books on Exmoor. His 1952 book of that title was described by his son John as the standard work on the area. His 1953 book on The North Devon Coast. A guide to its scenery & architecture, history & antiquities, was followed by its partner on the south Devon coast in 1954. In Devon Villages (1972), Burton described the problems unseen by tourists, such as young people leaving to find work, clergymen spread between multiple parishes, and the difficulty of forming a cricket team.\\"By train to the West\\", Ion Trewin, The Times, 12 April 1973, p. 15.
