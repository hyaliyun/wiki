The palace faces the Straits of Johor and has a bird's eye view of Singapore, a former possession of the Sultanate. From historical records, the palace was completed in 1933. == Overview == Istana Bukit Serene has a tower measuring 35m in height and is among the famous tourist attractions in Johor Bahru. This historical building features unique carvings and is influenced by the Art Deco aesthetic. The palace has a huge sprawling garden which is a common site for many royal gatherings and celebrations. The palace is well guarded by the Royal Johor Military Force (JMF), the Sultan's own private army. ==History== Istana Bukit Serene was a gift from the Johor government to the late Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Abu Bakar in conjunction with the ruler‚Äôs 40th anniversary as the sultan of Johor. ===Japanese Occupation (1942-1945)=== Sultan Ibrahim became a personal friend of Tokugawa Yoshichika during the 1920s. Tokugawa was a scion of the Tokugawa clan, and his ancestors were military leaders (sh≈çgun in Japanese) which ruled Japan from the 16th to the 19th centuries. When the Japanese invaded Malaya, Tokugawa accompanied General Yamashita Tomoyuki's troops and was warmly received by Sultan Ibrahim when they reached Johor Bahru at the end of January 1942. Yamashita and his officers then stationed themselves at Istana Bukit Serene and the state secretariat building, Sultan Ibrahim Building to plan for the invasion of Singapore.Lee, Singapore: The Unexpected Nation, pg 37War for the Empire: Malaya and Singapore, Dec 1941 to Feb 1942 , Richard Reid, Australia-Japan Research Project From the palace, he had a splendid view of the positions of the Australian Army and Navy across the Straits of Johor. Yamashita used the palace tower as viewing point as it had a bird's eye view of Singapore. Although advised by his top military personnel that the palace was an easy target, Yamashita was confident that the British Army would not attack Istana Bukit Serene because it was the pride and possession of the Sultan of Johor. Yamashita's prediction was correct as the British Army did not dare attack the palace. Shortly before the Japanese surrendered in 1945, Sultan Ibrahim was expelled from his residence at Istana Bukit Serene and was forced to reside at Istana Pasir Pelangi, the crown prince's palace.Bayly, Harper, Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia, pg 132 ==Historical Events== Istana Bukit Serene seen from afar.

He scored over 270 points for the Midlands team including 52 tries with the highlight of his stay being the 2001-02 season where he was the league's top scorer with 25 tries, helping Dudley Kingswinford to a runners up spot and almost gaining promotion (they lost the playoff match). Perry's point scoring exploits saw him be picked up by another Midlands team, Coventry, whom he played for in National Division One for two seasons, during which time he scored a try in a match against his future club, Bristol. After eleven games for Bristol during the 2005‚Äì06 season, Perry was called up into the England A squad. He was given the captaincy for the match against Ireland A. Towards the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, Perry sustained a wrist injury which ruled him out for approximately eight weeks of play, and therefore also put him out of contention to represent England during the summer tests to Australia, for a two-test Cook Cup series. In August 2006, Perry was included in the 2006‚Äì07 England Elite Player Squad.

A poor performance against South Africa in the 2007 Rugby World Cup led to Perry being dropped from the 22 by England coach Brian Ashton. He missed the 2008 Six Nations Championship after sustaining a fractured windpipe against Harlequin F.C. where he was caught with a stray boot. Perry was a welder before turning to a career in professional rugby. Perry joined French club CA Brive for the 2009-10 Top 14 season.

Peter can be heard on ABC Local Radio program, Nightlife, every month with Tony Delroy, where listeners can call in and ask technological questions. == Personal == Blasina was married to a school teacher with whom he has four children. They separated in 1997. Blasina subsequently met journalist and publisher Anika Hillery, who has since taken up the role of Editorial Director at Blasina's company The Gadget Group. Blasina and Hillary have a child named Quinn. == Earlier career == In the early 1980s Blasina was a school teacher. He supplemented his income by working part-time as an aerobics instructor and photographer. During this time he was invited to do a photo shoot for Cleo magazine as its non-frontal nude male centrefold model for the month. The photos were published in 1981. Peter also pursued a career in rugby in his 20s representing Easts rugby union football clubs first-grade team. Interview ABC Local Radio Afternoons 12 May 2008 == Criticisms == Peter, not unlike other technology media personalities, has attracted criticism for a thin technical background in the technologies he showcases, and for not disclosing affiliations with particular companies and brands such as Philips and Samsung. His appearances on the My Business Show typically feature him presenting recommendations to business owners that appear on face value to prioritise low initial cost rather than best practices or value. Though his actual technical knowledge has been questioned from time to time, on 28 April 2009 Peter covered for the Sunrise program the issue of the \\"Internet Filling Up\\". During the segment there was a reference to the infamous internet tubes, a statement that the internet was founded in 1996, and a strong push towards naming Cisco switches as a solution to the crisis, Cisco being a company Peter has known connections with via the ZyNet television show. This segment has been debunked in the media and by technology specialists, including the Australian political site Crikey.

It was released as a single and did not chart in the United States, but peaked at No. 40 in the UK for the week ending August 27, 1977. It was re-released in 1994 as the second single from Petty's Greatest Hits album and peaked at No. 68 in the U.S. Cash Box Top 100. Despite limited chart success, \\"American Girl\\" became one of Petty's most popular songs and a staple of classic rock. It has been consistently rated as his best song and one of the best rock songs of all time, and has been called \\"more than a classic rock standard ‚Äî it's practically part of the American literary canon.\\" It has also been used in several movies and television shows, often during a scene in which a character, much like the protagonist in the song's lyrics, is \\"longing for something bigger than their current existence.\\" American Girl was the last song performed in concert by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. They played it to close out the encore of their performance on September 25, 2017, at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California, the final concert of their 40th Anniversary Tour. Petty died of complications from cardiac arrest after an accidental prescription medication overdose on October 2, just over a week later. ==Composition and recording== American Girl was written by Tom Petty around the time he and the Heartbreakers signed their first recording contract. It was recorded on the 4th of July in 1976, the Bicentennial of the United States. \\"American Girl\\" uses standard rock instrumentation of electric guitars, electric bass, drums, and keyboards. The tempo is fast and \\"urgent,\\" and is built on a repeated jangling guitar riff based on a \\"Bo Diddley beat.\\" As described in Rolling Stone, \\"The supercharged riff set the template for decades of Petty hits, but it was also an homage to the Byrds: Petty and Mike Campbell's twin guitars mirrored Roger McGuinn's 12-string, infusing the folk- rock sounds of the 1960s with New Wave energy.\\" === Lyrics and rumors === Beaty Towers on the University of Florida campus Due to the lyrics about a desperate girl on a balcony hearing \\"cars roll by out on 441,\\" the song was rumored to have been written about a college student who committed suicide by jumping from the Beaty Towers residence hall at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida. Beaty Towers is located on the edge of the university campus alongside U.S. Route 441 (called NW 13th Street through the city), and the residence hall opened in 1967, when Petty was still a teenager living in his hometown of Gainesville. According to Carl Van Ness, the University of Florida's former historian, there have been many suicides in the school's history, but since the university does not keep a file of them, he \\"doesn't know for sure\\" if any involved a jump from Beaty Towers.Wilmath, Kim. \\"Myths, legends and UF\\" The Independent Florida Alligator Online, August 15, 2007.

When asked directly about the story in the book Conversations with Tom Petty, Petty responded: In the same interview, Petty says that he wrote the song while living in California: The opening line lyric \\"raised on promises\\" echoes a line of dialogue in Francis Ford Coppola's 1963 film, Dementia 13.

The song has been featured in several Hollywood films and episodes of television shows, most notably FM (1978), Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), The Silence of the Lambs (1991), The Sopranos (1999), Scrubs (2001), Chasing Liberty (2004), Parks and Recreation (2009), Ricki and the Flash (2015) and The Handmaid's Tale (2017). Its use in The Silence of the Lambs made the list of Top 11 Uses of Classic Rock in Cinema at UGO. According to Tom Petty, The Strokes have admitted to taking the riff for their 2001 single, \\"Last Nite\\", from this song. In a 2006 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Petty said \\"The Strokes took 'American Girl', and I saw an interview with them where they actually admitted it. That made me laugh out loud. I was like, 'OK, good for you.' It doesn't bother me.\\" The Strokes played as an opening act for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers for several dates of their 2006 tour. ==Cover versions== Roger McGuinn of The Byrds (a major influence on Petty's music), released his own version of \\"American Girl\\" on his Thunderbyrd LP in 1977. The similarity between Petty's record and The Byrds' musical style was so strong that when his manager first played \\"American Girl\\" for him, McGuinn asked \\"When did I write that song?\\"\\"McGuinn Takes It Easy As Comeback Takes Off\\" Austin American-Statesman May 13, 1991: B8 \\"American Girl\\" has also been covered by the following artists: The Killers, The Shins, Jason Isbell, Green Day, Elle King, Cindy Alexander, Angel City Outcasts, Elvis Costello, Melora Creager, Cruiserweight, Dance Hall Crashers, Def Leppard (from Yeah! 2006), Val Emmich, The Dollyrots, Everclear, Fun, The Gaslight Anthem, Goo Goo Dolls, Gin Blossoms, Humble Gods, Ill Repute, Jack's Mannequin, Larkin Poe, Matchbox 20, Matthew Sweet, Of Montreal, Pearl Jam, Rasputina, Saints of the Underground, Six Going on Seven, Smith Westerns, Sugarland, Sum 41, Taking Back Sunday, Taylor Swift, The Hush Sound, Tokyo Police Club, Frank Turner, and Luke Sital-Singh. ==All appearances== *Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers *Pack up the Plantation: Live! *Greatest Hits *Playback *Anthology: Through the Years *Runnin' Down a Dream *The Live Anthology *Mojo Tour 2010 ==See also== *1977 in music ==References== Category:1976 songs Category:1977 singles Category:Everclear (band) songs Category:Songs written by Tom Petty Category:Tom Petty songs Category:University of Florida Category:Shelter Records singles Category:Island Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Denny Cordell Category:Songs composed in D major ","title":"American Girl (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)"},{"id":"6224726","text":"Love in the Fascist Brothel is the second and final studio album by San Diego post-hardcore band The Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower, released on Revelation Records and Three One G on February 15, 2005 on compact disc and vinyl formats respectively.

He is a PEN Honorary Member. He has served 17 years in prison on propaganda charges stemming from his writings about the Kurdish population in Turkey. ƒ∞smail Be≈üik√ßi Be≈üik√ßi studied at the Faculty of Political Sciences of Ankara University, and graduated in 1962. After his military duty he became an assistant professor at Atat√ºrk University in Erzurum. He prepared his first anthropological study, an investigation of one of the last nomadic Kurdish tribes, the Alikan, here, which he submitted in 1967 to the Ankara Faculty of Political Sciences. His second encounter with the Kurds was during his military service when he served in Bitlis and Hakk√¢ri where he first saw the nomadic Alikan tribe pass through Bitlis on their migrations from winter to summer meadows and back. His book \\"The order of East Anatolia\\", first published in 1969, in which he sought to adapt and apply Marxist concepts to the analysis of Kurdish society and to the processes of socio-economic and political change taking place, made him a public enemy. While the book did not cause much debate either in academic or left intellectual circles, the university took disciplinary measures against him which would lead to a trial after the 1971 coup. He was detained and put on trial for communist and anti-national propaganda where he was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for violating the indivisibility of the Turkish nation. Be≈üik√ßi did not have to serve his full 13 years and benefited amnesty in late 1974. He unsuccessfully applied for a position at the Faculty of Political Sciences in Ankara, which in 1970 had appeared willing to employ him. He never found academic employment again and was henceforth to do his research as an independent scholar, in economically precarious circumstances. For many years, Ismail Be≈üik√ßi was the only non-Kurdish person in Turkey to speak out loud and clearly in defense of the rights of the Kurds. Continuing to write and speak in spite of all attempts to silence him, Be≈üik√ßi has become a powerful and important symbol for the Kurds and for the human rights movement of Turkey. He was charged for over 100 yearshttp://www.etext.org/Politics/Arm.The.Spirit/Kurdistan/Articles/ismail- besikci.txt but released from jail in 1999. In 1987 he was a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. He has been described as \\"modern Turkey's pioneer of Kurdish studies\\". In 2010 he was again prosecuted, this time by the attorney general of Istanbul for ‚ÄúPKK propaganda‚Äù on account of an article on \\"The rights of the nations to self-determination and the Kurds\\" that he wrote for the \\"Association of Contemporary Lawyers\\". In March 2011 he was sentenced to 15 months in prison. He was announced the Person of the Year by Rudaw Media Network, a major Kurdish Media Network based in Kurdistan Region for his contribution to the Kurdish cause, and inspiring others to do so. Ismail Besikci has authored several important works on Kurdish social organization and the continuing plight of Kurds today. His most famous work is International Colony Kurdistan. Besikci argues that the Turkish state has been practicing a policy of genocide against Kurds over the past 80 years. International Colony Kurdistan is probably Besikci's most open critique of the present division of Kurdistan, an ethnically contagious area (mainly) between Turkey, Iran and Iraq - with a Kurdish population of several million people. Besikci argues that, for all their political differences, there is a longstanding understanding between these regional states to deny Kurds the right of self-determination and nationhood. Ismail Besikci's International Colony Kurdistan was originally published in 1991 and led to the imprisonment of the author in Turkey. The book remains a roadmap for our understanding of Kurdistan today. == Publications == 32 of the 36 books that he has published have been banned in Turkey.

Sjoko (born 1950, The Hague) is a Dutch-born recording engineer and producer who is now based in Carpinteria, California. He was the \\"sound guy\\" behind many successful Dutch bands in the early 70s, before going on to work with numerous high profile international artists. Since then, Sjoerd has built a solid background of expertise in the music industry, business development, and consultancy. Sjoerd's involvement in the music industry started in the mid 60s, when Dutch bands like Golden Earring, Focus, Shocking Blue and various others broke through on the International scene. Recognized as one of the leading engineers in Europe at the time, he worked with many top acts, from The Who, Pink Floyd, ABBA, the Doors, Jefferson Airplane, the Beach Boys to Elton John, Rod Stewart, the Faces, The Rolling Stones, the Doobie Brothers, J. Geils, Frank Zappa, and many more. His sound design expertise also lead to the establishment of I.M.S. (International Music Services), which grew to become Europe's leading Sound Corporation at the time, as well as the development of the first live surround-sound (quadraphonic) systems (Pink Floyd, Golden Earring). He left the music industry in the 80s in order to concentrate on \\"normal\\" business, and made a name for himself in corporate and logistics consultancy. After a period with Texas Instruments, where his marketing strategy and lobbying led to the acceptance of hand-held programmable calculators throughout the EEC's education system and a 78% market share for T.I., he accepted an offer from UK based Lex Service PLC. Starting with responsibility for project management and development strategy, he soon became an operating board member and strategist for Lex Specialist Transport division, consisting of a group of eight companies. After the Lex Group's decision to divest from their transport and logistics interests, Sjoerd had the task of arranging management buyouts and company sales ‚Äì and managed to do so without the loss of a single job of the 14.000 jobs involved. Left with the two largest of Lex's transport companies, he played a leading role in selling them to the US based Federal Express corporation, after which he joined the operating board of FedEx responsible for the launch and development of FedEx in Europe and the Middle East, a high profile and award winning corporate launch he completed in 1986. In 1988 Sjoerd left FedEx in order to establish a logistics and general business consultancy. He also decided that he wanted to bring his children up in a healthy environment and moved to a farm in rural North Yorkshire, U.K. Sjoerd's consultancy business thrived, and he developed an interest in sustainable agriculture and development. His farm operated in an environmentally friendly and efficient manner, without the use of chemicals. In addition he was involved in the development of alternatives to hardwood for stabling, non-harmful timber preservatives and many other environmentally friendly projects. In the meantime Sjoerd's consultancy practice undertook major corporate projects including; Massey Ferguson, the world's largest tractor manufacturer by restructuring their logistics and workflow practices, re-structuring logistics operations for corporations such as Mothercare, Jaguar, Boots, Saab, Volvo, Toyota, Fisher HiFi and others, before being recruited by the UK government to assist in the introduction of market economy practices to conglomerates in the former USSR. He returned to music in the late 1990s, while working as an advisory board member and consultant for audio industry corporations such as JBL, Lucid, Symeterix. In 2001, he established a recording studio, Tantrum Studios, based in Santa Barbara, California. The design incorporated all Sjoerd had learned over the years. The studio is now gaining International recognition for its high quality sound and productions. One of its unique features is that only recycled or organic products have been used in its construction. Recycled rubber flooring, sound diffusion panel made from pressed straw, naturally dyed hemp cloth. Sjoerd established Tantrum Records in 2005, a production company and record label representing popular African artists. As of the end of 2011 Sjoerd became the CEO of a new media corporation i.D.B. Media Group LLC, based in Carpinteria, California, USA. The corporation is in the process of building a new production facility. Incorporating the latest technology available the facility incorporates a sound stage, multi-room recording facility and editing suites. The corporation will incorporate Tantrum Records and its music production and will produce and distribute feature film and original television programming. Apart from in music and business, Sjoko has achieved success in sailing, speed skating, car racing, and horse breeding. ==References== *Sjoerd (Sjoko) Koppert's new studio *Stagetec central to new Rose Lane Studio Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch record producers Category:Dutch audio engineers Category:Musicians from The Hague Category:People from Carpinteria, California Category:Date of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Sjoerd Koppert"},{"id":"6224828","text":"The Taipei Metro Beitou station (formerly Peitou Station until 2003) is a station on Red Line (Tamsui Line and Xinbeitou Branch Line), located in Beitou District, Taipei, Taiwan.

All these institutions contribute a variety of services and perspectives towards human rights, covering topics including the enforcement, monitoring, and criticisms of human rights in Asia. There is no single body that covers all of human rights in Asia, as such a diverse and widespread region requires a number of institutions to properly monitor the multitude of elements that fall under the scope of human rights. There have historically been numerous criticisms of human rights in Asia, but a variety of new treaties and conventions now strive to accomplish a level of human rights as they are known on the international stage. Human rights in Asia are monitored by many organizations (both governmental and non-governmental), a few examples being the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) and Human Rights Watch. Tolerance of these organizations varies from state to state, with voluntary intergovernmental programs (i.e. ASEAN) often seeing more state-cooperation than neutral non-governmental organizations would typically receive. The number of criticisms towards Asian states has dramatically increased in recent decades, with many human rights advocates calling for increased transparency and greater international pressure upon Asian states to refrain from any human rights infractions. Aforementioned calls for international pressure have gone unanswered, however, as most of the international community finds it increasingly difficult to challenge the actions of the growing Asian powers: particularly China. While states have put forward somewhat muted complaints in recent years, non-governmental organizations continue to 'name and shame' states that have shown themselves to be guilty of human rights infractions. == History of human rights in Asia  Southeast Asia === Southeast Asian Region Southeast Asia has historically not adopted the same definition of human rights that could be found in Western European or North American countries. The first sign of human rights recognition came in the form of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) put forward by the United Nations. This declaration, however, was not binding and therefore not enforced. The UDHR had only 51 states worldwide ratify its existence (those who were members of the United Nations); many of the Southeast Asian countries had not yet acquired membership. This primarily Western-based notion of human rights had by no means permeated Southeast Asia; instead, the ideological opposite of human rights was true: there were no expectations of equal treatment based upon socioeconomic, cultural, religious, etc. status.Bell, Daniel A. (2000). East meets West : human rights and democracy in East Asia([Online-Ausg.] ed.). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 344. In the Philippines, the country has experienced a long struggle for instituting democratic ideals. It was the first nation in Asia to form a republic, and in the 1970s contested the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship, which eventually was ousted through a bloodless People Power Revolution in 1986.. Numerous human rights victims suffered under the administration, and in 1983, one of the first Southeast Asian organizations called the Regional Council on Human Rights in Asia formalized the first regional declaration on human rights called the Declaration of the Basic Duties of ASEAN Peoples and Governments. The non-government organization was composed of established Southeast Asian human rights lawyers led by the father of Philippine human rights Sen. Jose W. Diokno, who was the founder of the largest human rights law firm called the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG). The declaration was signed on December 9, 1983 in Manila. In the 21st century, the nation has faced a War on Drugs under the 16th President Rodrigo Duterte, who has made claims to declare martial law, similar to Ferdinand Marcos. Time Person of the Year Maria Ressa of Rappler was later charged with libel for her reports on the Duterte administration. In Singapore, certain fundamental freedoms are still restricted such as the freedom of assembly. Meetings of any kind are still heavily regulated, requiring a police permit for gatherings of 1 individual or more. Public gatherings for any cause are further restricted by the Singapore government, with many events in recent history being shut down under the pretense of the 'Public Order Act'. Singapore also regularly rejects applications for police permits to gather for assemblies \\"directed towards a political end\\". Singapore has retained and employed the death penalty numerous time throughout history, especially in drug related criminal cases. Executions often take place relatively quickly after conviction and almost never have any transparency. Singapore's LGBTQ community has seen heavy restrictions throughout history, such as the long- standing policy of criminalizing same-sex relations ‚Äì a policy that remains in place today. Indonesia has a long history of committing numerous human rights infractions that have gone unpunished. Numerous members of the Indonesian security forces have been found responsible for human rights violations including rape, beatings, unlawful detention, etc. but have not be brought to justice. Indonesia's media, while officially deemed 'free press', suffers from intimidation tactics employed by powerful government or business figures. Numerous journalists have been jailed under supposed violations of various criminal and civil defamation laws. Religious freedom has been an issue of Indonesia for numerous years, despite its constitution dictating complete religious freedom/tolerance. Legal restrictions upon any religion except the 6 sanctioned state religions have existed in Indonesia for decades and are not expected to be lifted any time soon. Labor laws in Indonesia continue to be harsh, with hundreds of thousands of girls in Indonesia being subjected to involuntary labor. These children are often prohibited from leaving their places of employment and are often abused physically, psychologically, and sexually. The Human Rights Watch in early May 2020 urged the Indonesian government to immediately release at least 70 Papuan and Moluccan activists. They were arrested during a peaceful protest against the government. HRW also requested the government to ensure freedom of expression in the eastern province of Indonesia in line with the 2018 court ruling. === Central Asia === Human rights in Central Asia have received less attention from media in recent years following the outbreak of conflict with Western powers than previous decades, but that is not to say that they are completely overlooked on the international stage by international governmental organizations or non- governmental organizations. Local interest in the adoption and upholding of human rights has also been relatively minimal, with proposed international governmental organizations (IGOs) such as the Central Asian Union (CAU) choosing to focus on other issues such as security, economic development, and cultural permeation. Central Asia Central Asia has many human rights issues that plague the lives of its citizens. For example, Human Rights Watch has compiled numerous reports with aims of drawing attention to the fact that Afghanistan remains in a state of conflict, seeing citizen death tolls either stay high or slowly grow; general safety of citizens is an uncertainty in Afghanistan, with human rights violations including torture, unlawful detainment, etc. by the government and other groups also going unchecked. These human rights violations have existed in Afghanistan throughout recent history and continue to exist today. Furthermore, numerous cases of sexual assault can be found throughout Afghanistan but often receive very little (if any) attention from the government; in fact, the opposite is true: the Afghan government often orders the performance of \\"virginity checks\\" upon women which essentially entails governmental sanctioned sexual assault or humiliation. Looking specifically at Kyrgyzstan, Human Rights Watch reported very few improvements to human rights in 2017 within the state, with the government acknowledging issues such as torture as an issue but doing nothing proactive to combat them. Human rights violations such as torture are considered to be de facto interrogation tools and are likely employed by the government and its police forces. Authorities in Kyrgyzstan registered 199 complaints of torture in 2015, with only 34 cases actually ever being looked into. Other questionable Kyrgyz actions have included the mid-June proposal of a foreign media blackout to avoid bad international coverage; these constitutional amendments were heavily condemned by both domestic and international journalists. Kazakhstan is another Central Asian country that has had issues in recent history with human rights violations. Human Rights Watch condemned the Kazakhstan government for the detainment and jailing of peaceful protesters in 2016, with other violations such as restriction of movement and torture also being suspected following detention. Land claim protests are of particular prevalence as of late, with peaceful protests resulting in violent conflict between activists and government forces. The Kazakhstan government has justified said violent reactions by pointing to domestic laws striking freedom of association and assembly from their citizens' human rights, but said revocations of rights has been subjected to heavy criticism by the United Nations, European Union, and Human Rights Watch. Other Central Asian countries share both similar situations regarding human rights violations and a lack of movement to rectify said violations. === South Asia === South Asian Region South Asia includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka ‚Äì each state having varying degrees of effective human rights policies and/or goals. This region of Asia has seen some dramatic improvements regarding human rights in past years but still has room to improve, especially in human rights genres such as children's rights or women's rights. Some improvements in recent years have included a number of pacts and declarations to combat the world's highest children marriage rate in Bangladesh. Numerous cases of stalking, sexual assault, and rape have persisted in Bangladesh in recent years and the number of cases reported have continued to increase annually. Sexual and gender orientation has taken strides forwards in Southern Asia recently, seeing the official recognition of a third gender for Hijras come into effect; policy regarding this third gender, homosexual relationships, etc. has remained somewhat stagnant however, seeing relatively slow implementation of existing goals and the slowing of upcoming rules or regulations. Enforced or involuntary disappearances also continue to be an issue in Southern Asia, with United Nations requests for investigation being continually denied and Human Rights Watch statements simply being ignored. One of the most prominent and long-lasting issues for Southern Asia, particularly Bangladesh, is the problem of arsenic in drinking water. The World Health Organization (WHO) have stated an estimated 40 million people have been poisoned in Bangladesh alone and that local governments have taken few (if any) steps to rectify the problem. The arsenic is thought to come from water filtering through arsenic-rich rocks and local mining activity; the latter of the reasons is difficult to show, however, due to the refusal of Bangladesh to sanction any kind of investigation into the matter. Bhutan Bhutan is one of the region's leading human rights advocates, adopting numerous pro-human rights policies and regulations in the past years. Bhutan has officially committed itself to the \\"enjoyment of all human rights\\" and has shown progress in recent history via a skyrocketing gross national happiness (GNH) rating. The GNH rating is a scale which most experts see as increasingly relevant to gauging success within a country and general citizen happiness. The GNH replaces the standard measurement, gross domestic product (GDP), and its adoption has been considered by many developed nations including Canada and Japan. While Bhutan has taken steps to rectify historical divisions within the country's population, a clear political inequality remains in Bhutan, rendering some citizens unable to exercise fundamental rights such as freedom of movement or freedom of association. India finds itself as one of the leading economic powers of the region, but still is plagued with numerous human rights issues and violations. India has had numerous issues with rape and sexual assault in past years, particular against women and children. The government has condemned these acts but has taken very few steps to truly combat said issues and as a result, they still remain immensely prevalent in Indian society today. Despite policies aimed at helping victims of rape or sexual assault being implemented, victims still face immense shame at hospitals or police stations; it is assumed that while the number of cases is already extremely high, there are many more unreported instances due simply to the potential of humiliation. Pakistan is potentially the most volatile country in Southern Asia, seeing citizen-targeting terror attacks stemming from racially or politically motivated conflicts bring about high civilian casualties. Following the appearance of terror groups such as Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Omar, bombings of hospitals, educational facilities, government buildings, etc. became common occurrences, each attack claiming an increasing number of civilian lives. Enforced disappearances and the use of child soldiers have also seen frequent use through recent years, both of which have received immense international condemnation. The government has taken few steps to fix many of these human rights issues, due both to a lack of motivation and lack of resources. Abuses of women remained a prominent issue for Pakistan in recent decades, seeing instances of rape, sexual assault, forced marriage, etc. rampant throughout the country. Religious minorities in Pakistan have continued to suffer greatly from both terror organizations and the government itself, falling prey to religious policies specifically aiming to eradicate cultural/religious minorities and immense violence by terror groups and government forces alike. Immense fighting in the country brought the creation of millions of refugees; most of which have yet to permanently settle due to the instability of the region. === East Asia === East Asia is home to many countries that have dominated the international community's attention in recent years. Human rights conditions in many East Asian countries have been the subject of numerous debates at the international level given the notable international actors being examined (i.e. China, Japan, etc.). The varying types of governments found in Eastern Asia have affected their respective countries' transparency regarding human rights; furthermore, these Eastern Asian countries have varying level of human rights, with some states choosing to uphold the strictest human rights issues while others sanction numerous human rights violations and atrocities. China In China being such a significant economic and political power on the international stage, naturally their human rights record has been called into question by the international community and numerous non-governmental organizations. After Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012, human rights in China have worsened. China has historically been harsh upon its critics and this trend has continued in recent history, seeing enforced disappearances remain a widespread occurrence across China. China has also held the title for the most annual executions in recent years; while official statistics remain state secrets, China still has 46 crimes punishable by death. The Chinese government has claimed that the number of executions has fallen by 60%, seeing only a few thousand executed every year, but there is no credible way to verify these statistics. General living conditions have improved in recent years, with China successfully lifting millions of people out of poverty and allowing them to meet their basic needs.Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights on his mission to China, available from http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/35/26/Add.2 Women's rights remain somewhat basic in China but the international community has pushed the Chinese government to adopt improved rights, especially regarding women's rights within the Chinese judiciary system which as of 2013, was slated on the Chinese legislative agenda for the first time as point of discussion.Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, available from https://www.hrichina.org/sites/default/files/outcome_report_of_the_working_group_on_upr.pdf China also received international criticism for Xinjiang re-education camps and other human rights abuses against Hui people and other ethnic and religious minority groups. While there has historically been suspicion of torture in China, the general attitude towards torture has shifted in recent years; the Chinese government now openly opposes torture and punishes those who partake in it. Regarding the suspicion of torture carried out by the government itself, there have been no official admissions of torture in recent years but the international community has continued to pressure China to adopt various anti-torture laws and ensure that confessions obtained via torture are not considered admissible in the judiciary system. Japan has held its human rights record in immensely high standing, strictly observing basic freedoms such the freedom of assembly, association, and expression. Domestic nationals have in recent history been protected by a strict set of codified working laws in Japan and enjoy a wide variety of workplace rights and freedoms to ensure safety and fair working conditions. The same, however, cannot be said for migrant workers from China and Korea; these foreign workers have historically had no real legislation protecting their working conditions and often fall prey to poorer working conditions and lesser wages. Migrant workers also suffer from other rights infractions, including the prevention of free movement, the prohibition of free communication (i.e. via cellphone, landline, etc.), etc. Japan has historically not had any anti-discrimination laws due to a lack of evidence of any consistent discrimination within the country; this, however, changed in 2017 with the adoption of an anti-hate speech law following the provision of evidence showing a growing anti-Korean sentiment within Japan. One of Japan's most notable human rights violations over the last decades was the provision of comfort women for their military services, namely before and during the Second World War. Most of these comfort women were not Japanese nationals, but in fact Korean or Chinese captives captured in combat or purchased on a black market. These women suffered countless instances of sexual assault and rape; something the Japanese government has pledged to reconcile for and find justice for the women. In 2017, Japan began taking steps towards reconciliation by offering official apologies to numerous comfort women and donating 1 billion yen (approximately US$10 million) to Korea's Foundation for Reconciliation and Healing. Japan has continued their usage of the death penalty in recent years, executing 2 prisoners in 2017 by hanging following their convictions. South Korea South Korea shares many of the same civil and political liberties as Japan, enjoying a vibrant and relatively liberal society. There have been some instances of the government using outdated laws as a means of detaining those who criticize the government, but these cases are somewhat rare. South Korea is relatively intolerant of the LGTBQ community and has seen numerous cases of discrimination in recent years in numerous arenas, ranging from the judicial system to corporate board rooms. Women in South Korea do not enjoy the same civil liberties as women in European or North American states, instead being pushed into traditional housewife and caretaker roles by their partners. Women have also been fined up to 2 million won when found to have had an abortion without their husband's consent. South Korea also has left their policies regarding North Korea active, meaning any citizen found to be spreading positive North Korean 'propaganda' can be jailed for up to one year. North Korea Mongolia has suffered from a poor record of human rights throughout history, seeing numerous cases of torture and assault on the part of both the government and individuals. Mongolia abolished the death penalty in 2017, but it has since been proposed to reintegrate the death penalty into the judicial system by the newly elected president. Mongolia has also seen a high number of domestic abuse cases in recent decades and has taken no real steps to rectify the situation. Mongolia is also the home to a number of migrant workers; these workers have yet to be officially recognized by the Mongolian government and therefore have been given no official rights.Mongolia Human Rights Report 2016. US State Department, Mongolia Human Rights Report 2016. North Korea has been and continues to be the home of some of the world's worst human rights conditions. Numerous reports documenting appalling human rights violations have been compiled by North Korean defectors, outside NGOs, etc. North Korea has been accused of a number of human rights violations including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and forced abortion. North Korea has also restricted all basic civil and political liberties for its citizens, including any kind of freedom of movement or association while also providing no forums for political input. Women in North Korea continue to face a wide range of abuses including non-criminalized marital rape, forced marriage, and sexual torture; these acts are undertaken by both the government and other family members (typically husbands, fathers, etc.). North Korean prison facilities have also historically provided some of the worst living conditions in the world, likely being the cause of hundreds of thousands of deaths of recent decades. These prison camps house mainly political prisoners and typically entail harsh (if not fatal) labor, regular torture, violent sexual assault and/or rape, and other appalling human rights violations. North Korea has fallen under harsh criticisms from the international community for years and their abominable human rights records remains a regular topic of conversation within the UN Security Council as a potential threat to global peace and security. == Monitoring and Regulatory Institutions == As the Asian region is home to a plethora of states each with varying degrees of human rights standards and general values or cultures, it comes as no surprise that Asia does not share one central authority regarding human rights. === Universal Declaration of Human Rights === Universal Declaration of Human Rights While a number of countries within today's greater Asian region were not members of the United Nations at the time it passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, most of those who were chose to vote in favor of it (i.e. Afghanistan, Pakistan, India). This declaration has 30 articles all pertaining to various facets of human rights; for example: * Article 1: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. * Article 9: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. * Article 19: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. The UDHR was created in hopes of establishing a standard of living for people around the world, ensuring humane conditions for people regardless of their state. The UDHR is still considered the central authority regarding human rights, though it holds no binding power over states and therefore is still regularly ignored by numerous states when alternatives better serve state-interests. === ASEAN Human Rights Declaration === As mentioned above, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) can be considered the most established socio-economic regional organization in Asia. ASEAN operates solely in South East Asia, with member states including Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Myanmar, Brunei, and Laos. While ASEAN initially focused on economic development in South East Asia, it has recently started to expand its scope of operation into other areas of South East Asian society (i.e. human rights). In 2009, ASEAN formed the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights hoping it would assist in the promotion and regulation of human rights conditions in the region. The commission created and later unanimously adopted the newly-drafted ASEAN Human Rights Declaration in November 2012 which called for basic and fundamental rights for all citizens in Southeast Asia. The declaration has 40 articles which include: * Article 3: Every person has the right of recognition everywhere as a person before the law. Every person is equal before the law. Every person is entitled without discrimination to equal protection of the law. * Article 11: Every person has an inherent right to life which shall be protected by law. No person shall be deprived of life save in accordance with law. * Article 22: Every person has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. All forms of intolerance, discrimination and incitement of hatred based on religion and beliefs shall be eliminated. * Article 33: ASEAN Member States should take steps, individually and through regional and international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights recognized in this Declaration. While the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration has been ratified by all ASEAN member states, there is still evidence of human rights transgressions in the region despite codified laws against said actions existing. The very existence of this declaration, however, shows progress regarding the acknowledgement of basic human rights in a region that traditionally expressed no interest in recognizing human rights regulations. === Center for Economic and Social Rights === 220px The Center for Economic and Social Rights (CESR) focuses on a collection of rights, including political rights, economic rights, social rights, etc. The CESR works throughout the entirety of Asia, often cooperating with the Asia Pacific Forum (APF) when working of improving rights situations in regions where the CESR does not have an established presence. The CESR opts to improve human rights conditions and regulations throughout Asia by supporting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs). Rather than attempting to enact change as an international actor, CESR and APF provide a variety of services and support options to NHRIs across Asia under the pretense that these domestic National Human Rights Institutions will be able to push for change much more efficiently than an international organization would. Some benefits to National Human Rights Institutions include: * NHRIs have a legally defined relationship with the state, which gives them authority to monitor compliance with international human rights norms * NHRIs rely on a broader set of advocacy tools than the judiciary or civil society groups as well as a quasi- judicial competence to receive complaints and scrutinize law and practice; they provide advice, assistance and capacity building to government * Uniquely positioned between government, civil society and the UN human rights system, NHRIs can bring together various governmental and non-governmental actors * As permanent institutions, NHRIs are able to track issues over extended periods to identify trends in the level of rights fulfillment === Association for Human Rights in Central Asia === 220px The Association for Human Rights in Central Asia (AHRCA) is a French independent human rights organization founded in 2006. This association focuses primarily on human rights monitoring, reporting on numerous human rights infraction including torture, abysmal working conditions, LGBTQ restrictions, media repression, etc. The AHRCA monitors states that lie within Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Rather than enacting change themselves, AHRCA heavily relies upon international rights mechanisms to bring change to Central Asia. The AHRCA focuses include but are not limited to: * Protection against torture * Support for political prisoners * Protection of Refugees * Freedom of Religion Recent activist initiatives include the AHRCA calling for an international boycott of Uzbek cotton as it relies heavily upon compulsory child labor when harvested. === Human Rights Watch === 220px Human Rights Watch (HRW) is widely regarded as one of the world's most reliable nongovernmental human rights organizations. HRW was established in 1978 and monitors countries around the globe, publishing more than 100 annual reports and generating extensive media coverage of human rights infractions. Furthermore, HRW meets regularly with state governments and intergovernmental organizations (i.e. the United Nations, European Union, African Union, etc.) to provide policy advice, briefings, etc. Aside from the extensive monitoring HRW published annually, the organization also focuses heavily on facilitating change in the regions they work within. For example, HRW actively organizes and covers protests or activist movements against a wide variety of issues (i.e. garbage burning in Lebanon). HRW has been involved in the Asian region for numerous years, regularly releasing various reports and criticisms on every Asian country. These reports focus on a number of issues, including fundamental freedoms, women's rights, child labor, etc. == Significant human rights violations  2005 Andijan unrest === Andijan Chapel The 2005 Andijan Unrest human rights violation took place in Uzbekistan and is one of the worst mass civilian executions in recent history, seeing civilian death tolls estimated to be between 200 and upwards of 1500. This human rights violation was prompted by the government's reluctance to release 23 local businessmen who had been charged with extremism, fundamentalism, and separatism. A small militia group gathered outside of the prison where these businessmen were being held and broke them out in the early hours of the morning, killing a number of prison guards and holding various government officials captive. Uzbek citizens took to the streets in support of this prison break, occupying Babar Square to protest governmental corruption, unjust judiciary systems, etc.Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Warsaw. 20 June 2005. Retrieved 28 March 2018. Government forces blocked all roads to the square in hopes to contain the protest, but many simply walked past military forces on foot and joined the protest.Council on Foreign Relations. Retrieved 28 March 2018. There were early reports of gunfire exchanged between civilians and military forces, but the protesters in the Babar Square were not deterred and remained in the same location. Between 5pm ‚Äì 6pm, the government initiated a large offensive upon the Babar Square without any warning. The Uzbek armed forces used sniper rifles, assault rifles, and armed personnel carriers (APCs) against the protesting civilians, indiscriminately firing upon men, women, and children alike. There were later reports of armed forces systemically executing immobile injured civilians and moving hundreds of bodies into mass graves. Despite the government claiming it took action solely against supposed terror groups embedded within the protest, Uzbekistan came under heavy international criticism following the Andijan massacre. === Khmer Rouge genocide === The Khmer Rouge genocide was carried out by Cambodian communists between the years of 1975 and 1979. This political group had been slowly increasing its population while simultaneously being armed by groups such as the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese army. Following the Khmer Rouge's victory in the Cambodian Civil War in 1975, the group began the mass killings that would plague the countries for the next half-decade. Death tolls during the Khmer Rouge genocide are estimated to be between 1.5 and 3 million, with at least half of those numbers being politically-motivated executions. Those who were not subjected to politically-motivated executions died either from abysmal work conditions or disciplinary torture followed by execution. The Khmer Rouge regime strictly enforced its social engineering policies, most of which focused on the recreation of an agrarian society.Frey, Rebecca Joyce (2009). Genocide and International Justice. Infobase Publishing. pp. 266, 267. . This focus brought the mass-eviction of the Cambodian urban population and later the forced marches of the urban population into rural areas in order to work farming (typically rice) institutions. Furthermore, the Khmer Rouge expected production of rice per hectare to triple from 1 ton to 3 tons; this expectation did not account for the immense inefficiency created by placing an urban population in typically rural jobs. The urban population simply did not have the required skill set to achieve the goals of the Khmer Rouge and many were executed as economic saboteurs (labelled as such due to their production rates). Executions were carried out at first with firearms, but following an ammunition shortage, Cambodian teenagers were armed with blunt melee weapons and forced to carry out executions on enemies of the Khmer Rouge. An estimated 20,000 mass graves have been discovered since the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. In 2014, Khmer Rouge leaders Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan received life sentences for crimes against humanity.Kiernan, Ben (1997). The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power, and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975‚Äì79. London: Yale University Press. pp. 31‚Äì158, 251‚Äì310. . === The Daoxian Massacre === Mao Zedong, leader of the Communist Party of China, meeting Richard Nixon, President of the United States The Daoxian Massacre occurred during China's cultural revolution and lasted for 66 days between the 13th of August and the 17th of October in 1967. Those who were massacred were suspected to be enemies of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Typically, local CPC members and revolutionary enthusiasts carried out unofficial arrests; those arrested and later executed by aforementioned local CPC members or militias received a brief, unjust trial where those judging were the same individuals who had ordered the arrests themselves. Victims were killed in a number of ways, including shooting, beatings, and decapitation. Furthermore, those who carried out these executions supposedly on behalf of the CPC would be rewarded with high wages, improved living conditions, etc. It is important to note that while the CPC did not officially sanction these militias and paramilitary groups executing counterrevolutionaries, it did not take any measures to stop these unsanctioned executions until numerous complaints from those who survived the Daoxian Massacre reached the top level of government. The killings ceased following the deployment of the 47th Field Army force but those who partook in the executions were never punished.\\"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, 1966‚Äì1976\\". www.sjsu.edu.

Retrieved 2015-11-15. === Genocidal rape in Bangladesh === The 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War saw members of the Pakistani military and their supporting militias rape between 200,000 and 400,000 women and girls in an attempt of ethnic extinguisher. The Pakistani military leaders had declared Bengali freedom fighters as \\"Hindus\\" and that their women were simply spoils of war for the military to use as they saw fit.Herbert L. Bodman, Nayereh Esfahlani Tohidi 1998, p. 208. Women were held in special camps where they were repeatedly raped by rotating Pakistani army groups; these women could only escape the camps by hanging themselves with their hair ‚Äì an action that led to the military shaving the heads of all the camp's inmates. Those who were not subjected to these rape camps would typically be raped, killed, and bayoneted in the genitalia.Arens 2010, p. 128. While the Pakistani military attempted to keep these systematic rapes out of international media, numerous human rights agencies and media outlets published reports or stories regarding this genocidal rape; Pakistan subsequently came under immense international criticism, reprimanding them for their actions.

He has recorded and performed with musicians including Steve Miller, Dave Mason, Lita Ford, Billy Joel and Rick James, and released an extensive catalogue of albums. ==The Just Us and The Tripp== Merryweather began his career in Toronto during the early 1960s performing under the name Bobby Neilson. During 1964, he joined forces with Gary Muir & The Reflections, a local group comprising Muir (vocals), Ed Roth (organ), Bill Ross (guitar), Brian Hughes (bass) and Bob Ablack (drums). Neilson's arrival prompted the group to part from Muir and the band briefly changed their name to The Ookpiks (after a native-designed stuffed toy owl that was being promoted by the Canadian government). As it turned out that another group was already using that name, they briefly switched to The Sikusis (after a different stuffed toy). After the Canadian government demanded payment for their name, they settled on The Just Us in early 1965. In 1965, the group recorded its lone single, \\"I Don't Love You\\" c/w \\"I Can Tell\\", for the local Quality Records label. (Some copies list the group as The Ookpiks, some The Sikusis, and some The Just Us). Soon afterwards, Ross and new drummer Al Morrison left to take part in the formation of The Bossmen around singer David Clayton-Thomas. Neilson, who now went by the name Neil Lillie, befriended ex-Mynah Birds singer Jimmy Livingston in Long & McQuade's music store where he worked in the backroom as an amp and guitar repairman and asked him to join a new line up of The Just Us. To complete the band, Lillie recruited former C.J. Feeney & The Spellbinders members Stan Endersby on guitar and Wayne Davis on bass. In early 1966, The Just Us recorded an album's worth of material at Arc Sound in Toronto, with the tapes being subsequently stolen by their manager. Undeterred, the band remained a popular local draw, regularly playing at Toronto clubs like the Hawk's Nest, the in Crowd and the Gogue Inn as well as local high schools. In June 1966, Davis left to play with Bobby Kris & The Imperials and Lillie learned to play bass in two weeks to fill the spot. Around this time, an American duo with the same name appeared on the charts and the group was forced to adopt a new name, The Group Therapy, for its show at the Varsity Arena on June 22, supporting The Byrds. When another local group surfaced with an earlier claim to The Group Therapy name, Neil came up with the new name, The Tripp, in September 1966. The new group never had the opportunity to record, but did appear on the first episode of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation‚Äôs TV show \\"The Sunday Show\\". The band remained a regular fixture on the Toronto club scene throughout late 1966 and early 1967, They opened for the top band in Toronto The Mandela and stole the show and afterwards were approached by Mandela guitarist and friend Domenic Troiano and his manager Riff Markowitz. Riff became the Tripp's manager. One of the Tripp's most prestigious shows during this period was a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens on September 24, 1966 alongside the cream of Toronto's rock bands. With its more experimental approach to performance, The Tripp began to perform at more colourful venues like Boris‚Äô Red Gas Room, the Devil's Den, the Flick and the Syndicate Club. Pianist Richard Bell from Ritchie Knight & The Mid-Knights briefly augmented the group in early 1967 but soon moved on to Ronnie Hawkins & The Hawks (and a few years later, Janis Joplin‚Äôs backing group Full Tilt Boogie, and the last edition of The Band). ==The Mynah Birds== Soon afterwards, Lillie left the group to take up an offer from singer Ricky James Matthews (later funk star Rick James) in a new version of The Mynah Birds. The band went to Motown studios in Detroit during August 1967 and recorded \\"It's My Time\\", a song written by James and Neil Young during the group's previous incarnation. The project was shelved when the band fell apart. James and Lillie returned to Toronto to find new musicians. Upon their return, Lillie recruited Marty Fisher (keyboards) and Gordie MacBain (drums) formerly of Bobbie Kris & The Imperials. While in search of a guitarist Neil ran into the drummer from The Staccatos (later to become The Five Man Electrical Band) who told him about guitarist Bruce Cockburn of The Children. Neil recruited Cockburn and the band was complete. Rick was picked up by the police for a breaking and entering charge involving a Yorkville Village clothes store and was being held in jail when it was discovered that he was also a draft dodger from the US Navy. It seemed like Rick would never be free to rejoin the new Mynah Birds so the band to stay alive decided to go it alone. Neil named the band The Flying Circus (this was before the Monty Python Flying Circus was formed). Signed to Harvey Glatt's management, the group recorded a number of unreleased tracks in Toronto, including Cockburn's \\"Flying Circus\\", \\"She Wants To Know\\", \\"I'm Leaving You Out\\", \\"Mother\\", \\"The Elephant Song\\" as well as Neil's \\"Last Hoorah\\" and Fisher and MacBain's \\"Where Is All The Love\\". At the same sessions, the band also recorded songs by Cockburn's former Children cohort, Bill Hawkins, such as \\"Merry Go Round\\", \\"It's a Dirty Shame\\", and \\"Little Bit Stoned\\". During late 1967, the band played at Le Hibou in Ottawa and the Riverboat in Toronto and opened for Wilson Pickett at the Capitol Theatre in Ottawa and Massey Hall in Toronto. They also opened for two nights for Roy Orbison at the Capitol theater in Ottawa. Motown records offered them a contract, but Cockburn rejected the deal, refusing to give up song publishing royalties. Neil was getting bored playing Cockburn's folk rock songs and longed to do a heavier form of rock. He left The Flying Circus in March 1968, and reunited with former Tripp members Ed Roth and Jimmy Livingston to form a new band. Adding ex-Fraser Loveman Group guitarist Dave Burt and drummer Gary Hall, the new group, initially dubbed 'New King Boiler' named after the iron furnace in Neil's grandmother's basement where they rehearsed. Gary Hall drank so much coffee that he was soon being called \\"Coffee\\" by Neil's grandmother (the name stuck, though he chose to spell it \\"Coffi\\"). The band got three demos together with the help of an engineer friend at Arc recording studio. Friend Bruce Palmer (former bassist for The Mynah Birds and now playing in LA with Buffalo Springfield) was in Toronto and sold the band on going to LA the way that he and Neil Young had done the years before, they decided to pile into a car and just drive to \\"La La Land\\". =='Merryweather' and subsequent recording career== The band adopted the name 'Heather Merryweather' after the title of one of the songs they recorded with lyrics by band friend, June Nelson. Nelson was Mo Ostin's secretary at Warner Bros. Records for many years. She was also responsible for pushing the band to go to LA. After they arrived in the summer of '68 the boys in the band were welcomed into the home of Linda Stevens in Topanga Canyon. Stevens was a folk singer and songwriter and friend of Buffalo Springfield. She offered not only a place to stay but allowed the band to rehearse in the house. Heather Merryweather's first gig was to be at the legendary Topanga Coral but the night before they were to play the Coral burned down. The Coral owners quickly rented a store on Ventura Blvd and opened the new club as Big Pink. Heather Merryweather were the first band to play the club. During their performances the band noticed that Jimmy Livingston seemed to change and his performance fell short of what was expected. Jimmy chose to party rather than play, and he and the band parted ways. Neil took over the vocals and began writing new material. Heather Merryweather soon found themselves sharing the bill with Chicago Transit Authority at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood. From that performance they were signed by the new A&R; rep John Gross. Gross became the band producer. The band decided to shorten their name to 'Merryweather' after the album was completed. Neil was at Capitol Records one day to oversee the final cover art and ran into Linda Ronstadt. Both being newly signed to Capitol they began a chat while sitting on the front steps of the Capitol Tower. Neil told her about the band and she was excited about her Capitol deal and was waiting to meet up with her Stone Poneys' producer Nick Venet. When Nick arrived she jumped up and turned to Neil and said \\"it was great meeting you Neil Merryweather!\\" Neil liking what Linda had called him immediately ran back upstairs to see the album's cover designer Robert Lockart and had the name Neil Merryweather added to the album credits. Neil legally changed his name and began a long recording career as Neil Merryweather. Merryweather's second album, Word of Mouth (released in September 1969), was a double-album of extemporaneous songs recorded in Los Angeles featuring the band jamming with numerous guests, such as Steve Miller, Barry Goldberg, Charlie Musselwhite, ex-Traffic guitarist Dave Mason, Howard Roberts and Bobby Notkoff. Although the album was reasonably successful, the group fragmented, with Neil quitting after a dispute. Neil ran into his old friend Rick James and told him if he wanted them he had a ready made band in Burt, Hall and Roth. Rick James recruited the guys and started the band Salt 'N' Pepper. Prior to the break, Merryweather turned down an offer from Stephen Stills to join Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young as bass player. Neil and Stephen had jammed at Stills' house in Topanga Canyon in the past and spent a day hanging out together. Merryweather flew back to Toronto to recruit replacements, then returned with them to record the album Neil Merryweather, John Richardson and Boers for the blues label Kent in early 1970. The resulting album, credited to Merryweather, ex-The Ugly Ducklings drummer Robin Boers, guitarist John Richardson from Nucleus (and before that Lords of London), and ex-49th Parallel member J.J. Velker attracted only limited interest. Merryweather agreed to do the album for the money to support the new band. They did a follow-up album for RCA, Ivar Avenue Reunion, featuring the same basic group plus Goldberg, Musselwhite, and Merryweather's new girlfriend, ex-C.K. Strong singer Lynn Carey. The duet of Merryweather and Carey impressed the A&R; department and RCA signed the duo as 'Merryweather & Carey'. Neil Merryweather and Lynn Carey, along with guitarist Kal David and former Merryweather bandmates Roth and Hall, recorded the Vacuum Cleaner album for RCA in 1971. Two tracks that they recorded at Kent Records under the name \\"Momma and Pappa Rock'n Family\\" (Kent 4522) were bought by RCA, also found their way onto the Vacuum Cleaner album. Neil was not happy with RCA firing the A&R; staff that signed them and found the replacement staff to be weak and he left with the idea to form a new group with Lynn out front. Neil recruited Coffi Hall as drummer and found guitarist Rick Gaxiola and keyboardist James Newton Howard. Merryweather had put together a new hard rock band which he named Mama Lion in 1972, featuring Carey on lead vocals. He produced a \\"demo\\" recording at Paramount studio and played it for some friends and it caught the ear of Ken Mansfield. Ken Mansfield became the new band's manager and within a week sold the band to Artie Ripp's new Family Productions label, which was a new affiliate of Famous Music. The band recorded two albums, Preserve Wildlife (which featured Neil's idea of a controversial photo of Carey appearing to nurse a tiger cub) in 1972 and Give It Everything I've Got in 1973. Merryweather also recorded with the Mama Lion lineup sans Carey, with this band calling itself Heavy Cruiser. They released two albums, the eponymous Heavy Cruiser (1972) and its followup, Lucky Dog (1973). The band was offered a management contract with Shep Gordon and was booked to open for Alice Cooper on his upcoming world tour. Ripp scuttled the deal by quickly stealing the management. The Alice Cooper tour was lost and the beginning of the end for the band started from that day on. After a few small tours of small clubs was arranged by Ripp's management Mama Lion wound up in Europe where a series of events due to bad management and internal disputes caused Neil to let guitarist Rick Gaxiola go. He replaced Rick with Alan Hertzberg from Billy Joel's band. Neil produced the second Mama Lion album Give It Every Thing We Got starting it in New York and finishing it in Los Angeles. The internal friction in the band partly caused Lynn Carey's substance abuse and Ripp's constantly saying that she was Mama Lion and not the band. Neil saw the band Mama Lion coming apart and after finishing the production of the album he quit. The double album that he produced was cut down to a single album and the title was changed to Give It Everything I Got. The cover featured Lynn Carey alone without a band member anywhere. Ripp and Carey achieved what they wanted and the band was sent back to Europe for another string of weak tour dates. The band broke up in Paris and the band members left, leaving Lynn Carey there to pick up the pieces. What Neil saw would happen came to a bitter end. Neil continued recording demos of his new songs with various members of Mama Lion. Neil invited friend and fellow label artist Billy Joel to the studio to play on some songs. At the time Joel was performing in a downtown Los Angeles bar under the name 'Bill Martin' in an effort to continue playing live, while hiding from Ripp and his label. On the second of two nights that Joel joined Neil in the studio they recorded Joel's \\"Piano Man\\" for the first time. Neil gave Joel the tape of the recording and it was used the next day to get Billy his recording contract with Columbia Records. In 1974 Merryweather put a new band together called the Space Rangers. Through friend Morey Lathower (VP of A&R; at Capitol) he was able to secure time at Capitol Records studios and in two nights he recorded the Space Rangers' first album. Neil used whatever funds he had left after the Mama Lion years and supported the new band until the money ran out. Unfortunately so did the band's keyboardist and guitarist. Neil's Mama Lion road manager Robbie Randal stuck with Neil and took the tape of the Space Rangers album into the office of Chip Taylor (Canned Heat). When the album was played Chip's brother Jim Taylor heard the new sound and offered to manage Neil. Taylor got a deal with Mercury Records and Neil was signed. Original Space Rangers drummer Tim McGovern remained loyal to the band and Neil hired keyboardist/guitarist Jamie Herndon and lead guitarist Michael Willis and the new band was ready to go. Neil bought a Chamberlin keyboard from Sonny & Cher. The Chamberlin was a key to the Space Rangers sound. The band was booked into the Whiskey when the Space Rangers album was released (1974). The album went to the No. 5 most added on radio airplay chart in two weeks. The label did nothing to support the album or the band. Six months later the small advance Neil got for Space Rangers was all but gone and in desperation to keep the band together Neil took the band into Village Recorders and in five days wrote all the songs, recorded and produced his second album for Mercury called Kryptonite. The label bought the album and it was released in 1975. The label still did not do anything to help the band or push the albums. Neil disbanded the Space Rangers due to lack of support and to weak management. The Space Rangers and Kryptonite albums received the highest praise from critics worldwide and Kryptonite was voted into the top five Psych Rock albums of the Seventies in an internet poll. Notable cuts included a cosmic psych rock version of The Byrds' \\"Eight Miles High\\" and the David Bowie-inspired single \\"Hollywood Blvd.\\", as well as the blistering autobiographical rocker \\"The Groove\\". The albums continue to gain a cult following to this day. Merryweather produced two singles for a three-girl- singing-trio he called \\"Band of Angels\\", one on Mums Records and one on Midland International. He did three albums at Sound City, The Hollywood Stars, solo artist Kyle, and his own album. Neil recruited Mike Willis and a bunch of his musician friends to record his new album with the help of engineer Mark Smith (Bachman-Turner Overdrive) at the controls. Neil then went to London England. Ann Munday, the head of Chrysalis Music Publishing signed Neil to a publishing deal upon hearing the Sound City recordings. It was through the Chrysalis Music deal that Dureco Records in Amsterdam heard Neil's Sound City recordings and signed Neil to a record deal to release the album. Neil named the album Differences due to the variety of writing styles it featured. Dureco asked Neil to produce a slew of Dutch bands that were signed to them. One band was called Carlsberg. Neil produced the Carlsberg album and it did well locally in the Netherlands. His deal with Dureco was to include a new Neil Merryweather album. While Neil recorded new demos for Chrysalis in London he found musicians Dave Sinclair (Matching Mole and Camel keyboardist) and Clive Edwards (Pat Travers, UFO and Wild Horses drummer) and guitarist Taff William (Bonnie Tyler and Eyes of Blue). Neil ran into Jethro Tull's road manager at Chrysalis and he told him of a great new studio in Miami. Neil called the studio and made arrangements to take his new group there to record the new album. Dureco refused to pay the bill to fly Dave Sinclair's custom Hammond organ to Miami. Dave wouldn't record without his personal gear so he was replaced by Roy Shipston, a friend of Clive Edwards. That was just the beginning of the Dureco Records situation as Neil was informed his budget was reduced by half when he arrived in Miami with the band. A week of sessions produced some fine recordings but only one song found its way onto the Differences album just before it was released. The other songs were only on a Dureco sampler. Neil turned to Cees Wessels the ex-head of Phonogram Holland. Cees was a huge fan of the Space Rangers and now was the new head of RCA in Amsterdam. Neil met Cees for coffee and they inked a deal for Neil to sign with RCA. Neil flew Mike Willis from the Space Rangers over to Amsterdam and they recruited Kees Meerman, the drummer from Herman Brood's Wild Romance and Ken Spence, a saxophonist from Nina Hagen's big band. Neil called the band 'Eyes' and the album Radical Genes was recorded. The band played locally around Amsterdam and they performed at the Hell's Angels Jamboree, but folded soon after due to friction between band members. Neil decided to return to LA. Upon his return to LA, Neil found old Krytonite keyboardist/guitarist Jamie Herndon. Through some Space Rangers fans he found drummer Dusty Watson. Neil took them into the studio and he wrote and recorded ten new songs in a few nights. Dusty had joined the newly formed Lita Ford Band and the bassist Ray Marzano asked Neil if he would consider managing the band. Neil had written two songs on the Differences album that Chrysalis music had sent to The Runaways manager Toby Mamis the year before. The songs were being rehearsed by The Runaways for their new album being produced by John Alcock (Thin Lizzy). The Runaways had broken up during the rehearsals and Lita had gone solo. Neil met with Lita and they became friends and on a handshake made a deal together. Neil got equipment endorsement deals for the band and a production deal with Fidelity Studios which included monetary support. Neil took the band into the studio and began producing tracks. He used his friendship with Russ Regan at Polygram to help negotiate a deal with the label and Lita. Neil secured a two album guaranteed deal and $300,000 for Lita with Polygram. During the recording sessions Lita fired Ray Marzano and asked Neil to play the bass on the album. The combination of Neil and Dusty was a super rhythm section for Lita's heavy guitar. Neil co-wrote four of the songs on the album including the title song \\"Out For Blood\\". Neil did everything he promised Lita he would do and the album was set for release. Neil wanted a better management situation for Lita and Shep Gordon was brought in to take over. To Neil's disbelief Lita rejected him. A manager named Alan Kovacs was then suggested by some people including the label's lawyer. Neil was never paid for his management or for the production of the Out For Blood album and was burned by Lita Ford and her new management. Neil had had enough of the music business and after a brief time trying to help Cees Wessels and his newly formed Roadrunner Records sign some LA metal bands and providing some management assistance to the band Hans Naughty, he quit. The Lita Ford betrayal was the last straw. Neil met and married Victoria Jane Zale. For a while Neil became a photographer and a model builder for the City Of Los Angeles Bureau Engineering under the title \\"Creative Resources\\" for Harris and Company, a consulting firm where his wife Victoria managed the West Coast office. When the computer age began to emerge Neil's wife Victoria encouraged him to make music again especially after finding pages of albums and history on the internet. She helped him build a studio in their house. Neil hooked up with Jamie Herndon (guitarist/keyboardist) and Dusty Watson (drums) and they picked up where they had left off before the Lita Ford fiasco. Neil was hired by DIC Entertainment to write and produce songs for two kids TV shows \\"Super Human Samurai Cyber Squad\\" (ABC) and \\"Tattooed Teenaged Alien Fighters From Beverly Hills\\" (USA). Neil and Jamie wrote and produced forty eight songs in a month's time for those shows. Jamie, Neil and Dusty recorded two albums Hundred Watt Head and The La La Land Blues Band together and continue recording to this day with Jamie and Dusty and Hundred Watt Head. The first Hundred Watt Head album is on iTunes on Ruth McCartney's iFanz label. Ruth's McCartney's Multimedia also designed Neil's website theneilmerryweather.com In 2015 Neil made a guest appearance on the Volume Three album by Janne Stark's Mountain of Power. Neil lent his voice to the tracks \\"Hey Serena/Wheel Of Fortune Turning\\". On the album Janne also covered Neil's songs \\"Give It Everything We Got/Kryptonite\\". The album was released on Grooveyard Records.http://www.grooveyardrecords.com/mountainofpowervolumethree.html This spawned further collaboration between Neil and Janne and in 2016 they started working on an album under the name Merryweather Stark . The album Carved in Rock was released on CD and double vinyl by GMR Music in 2018.http://jannestark.com/mymusic/merryweather%20stark/merryweather%20stark- biography.html Neil is now working on the production of Space Rangers 3 reuniting with drummer Dusty Watson. The album is due out by the end of 2020. Neil now resides in his Las Vegas home and continues to write and record songs in his Magicbox recording studio. He has also begun painting and has five paintings currently on display at Las Vegas City Hall. He recently had six of his art pieces in a show called \\"Soundsations\\" at UNLV . ==Discography== *Merryweather (with Merryweather) (Capitol, 1969) *Word of Mouth (with Merryweather) (Capitol, 1969) *Neil Merryweather, John Richardson and Boers (Kent, 1970) *Ivar Avenue Reunion (with Barry Goldberg, Charlie Musselwhite, Lynn Carey) (RCA, 1970) *Vacuum Cleaner (with Lynn Carey) (RCA, 1971) *Preserve Wildlife (with Mama Lion) (Family Productions, 1972) *Heavy Cruiser (with Heavy Cruiser) (Family Productions, 1972) *Lucky Dog (with Heavy Cruiser) (Family Productions, 1973) *Give It Everything I've Got (with Mama Lion) (Family Productions, 1973) *Space Rangers (Mercury, 1974) *Kryptonite (with Space Rangers) (Mercury, 1975) *Differences (1978) *Radical Genes (with Eyes) (1980) *Hundred Watt Head (with Hundred Watt Head) (2009) *The La La Land Blues Band (with The La La Land Blues Band) (2009) *Carved in Rock (with Merryweather Stark) (2018) *Neil Merryweather and Hundred Watt Head Too (with Hundred Watt Head) (2019) *Red (with Hundred Watt Head) (2019) ==Sources== * http://www.theneilmerryweather.com/ * https://web.archive.org/web/20060821214939/http://www.classicrockpage.com/everheardof/StanEndersby.htm * http://www.canadianbands.com/Merryweather.html * http://www.aftersabbath.com/2012/05/tdats-68-mr-invitation-neil.html * Bill Munson, interview with Ed Roth, 1976 * Nick Warburton, interview with Neil Merryweather, 2005 * The Toronto Telegram's After Four section * http://www.grooveyardrecords.com/mountainofpowervolumethree.html * http://jannestark.com/mymusic/merryweather%20stark/merryweather%20stark- biography.html ;Specific Category:Canadian rock singers Category:Canadian male singers Category:Canadian rock bass guitarists Category:Living people Category:1945 births Category:Musicians from Winnipeg Category:Male bass guitarists ","title":"Neil Merryweather"},{"id":"6225078","text":"Antipodocottus megalops is a sculpin of the family Cottidae, found on the continental shelf around New Zealand, at depths of between 400 and 600 m.

John Burgoyne's defeat at the Battle of Saratoga, in 1777, several thousand British and German (Hessian and Brunswickian) troops, of what came to be known as the Convention Army, were marched to Cambridge, Massachusetts. For various reasons, the Continental Congress desired to move them south. One of Congress' members, Col. John Harvie/Harvey, Sr. and sons offered some of his lands outside of Charlottesville, Virginia. The remaining soldiers (some 2,000 British, upwards of 1,900 German, and roughly 300 women and children) marched south in late 1778 - arriving at the site (near Ivy Creek) in January, 1779. As the barracks were barely sufficient in construction, the officers were paroled to live as far away as Richmond, Virginia and Staunton, Virginia. The camp was never adequately provisioned, and yet the prisoners did manage to make something of the site, including building a theater. Hundreds escaped Albemarle Barracks, owing to lack of an adequate number of guards. As the British army moved northward from the Carolinas, in late 1780, the remaining prisoners were moved to Frederick, Maryland, Winchester, Virginia, and perhaps elsewhere. ==Current status== The former site of Albemarle Barracks is on private property, northwest of downtown Charlottesville at the foot of Barracks Farm Rd.and marked by a Virginia State historical marker. In 1983, the Albemarle County Historical Society erected a plaque for the Albemarle Barracks burial site. Located on what is now Ivy Farm Drive, the spot marks the location of several graves found when the land was developed for residential use.

Together with Mandala, they spearheaded Toronto's R&B; scene during the mid-1960s. As the Jon-Lee Group, the band released a lone single for ABC Records before splitting up in September 1967. The group has more recently reformed, released its debut album in late 2006. ==High school origins== Lee Jackson and The Checkmates, formed at a Toronto high school during 1962 out of the remains of the Stereos, initially consisted of singer Michael Ferry (Lee Jackson), guitarist Al D'Orsay, bass player Dave McDeavitt, drummer Paul Carrier and saxophone player Hilmar Hajek. In late 1963, D'Orsay introduced classically trained pianist Michael Fonfara, who was responsible for bringing in a second lead guitarist, Larry Leishman. Leishman's arrival signaled a major upheaval in the band's line up, as D'Orsay departed and Leishman's former compatriot from the Silvertones and the Tempests, Peter Hodgson (born April 16, 1946, Toronto), succeeded McDeavitt on bass. Soon afterwards, the two new recruits (together with Fonfara) lobbied for the inclusion of another former Tempest, singer John Finley (born May 6, 1945, Toronto), whose recruitment in mid-1964 prompted a name change to Jon and Lee & The Checkmates. Throughout that year, the group also went through a succession of drummers as Dave Brown, who had come in for Carrier, left to join Jay Smith & The Majestics, and was replaced by Wes Morris. By the end of the year, however, Morris had moved on to join The Majestics and former commercial artist Jeff Cutler (born Rowland Jeffries Cutler, September 8, 1941, Toronto) completed the classic line up. ==1965: establishing their act== Jon and Lee & The Checkmates stamped their authority on the local scene with a performance at Toronto's Massey Hall in early 1965. The exposure from the performance aroused the interest of Afro-American √©migr√© Eddie \\"Duke\\" Edwards and Big Land music agency entrepreneur, the late Ron Scribner, who both became involved with the group's career. Edwards, a graduate of the Boston Conservatory, helped arrange material for The Checkmates as well as co-managing them. Another significant person in the audience, Cecil Farrell, proprietor at a Niagara Falls newspaper and AP correspondent, hired the band for his 16-year-old daughter's birthday party, where the group was introduced to Leo Pillott, director of public relations for the ABC-TV network. After hearing sample tapes, Pillott offered to represent the group and arranged a series of major network TV appearances; they would never come to pass. Meanwhile, Jon and Lee & The Checkmates, along with several local artists, were due to open for The Rolling Stones at Maple Leaf Gardens on April 25. However, the organizers booked too many groups and the band never got to play. For the next few months, Jon and Lee & The Checkmates found regular work on the local dance hall/teen club circuit and at the Devil's Den club which had become the band's home. Later in the summer came news the US Immigration & Naturalization Service had vetoed the TV bookings. Finally later in the year, Pillott and Farrell would be able to overcome the Immigration issue and book the band into the famous Peppermint Lounge for December. On September 13, the group joined local pop singer Bobby Curtola and others in opening Toronto's new city hall in Nathan Phillips Square. The exposure landed the band the opening slot at The Rolling Stones show at Maple Leaf Gardens on October 31, 1965. The following month, several US record labels, including Decca, Elektra, Motown and RCA approached the band with offers. Jon and Lee & The Checkmates recorded a few tracks in Toronto for RCA in November, but the results were disappointing. Shortly after a show at the Hawk's Nest on December 10, the group headed to New York to play at the Peppermint Lounge engagement and record three tracks for Decca (though again, the results were unsuccessful) ==1966: recovering from setbacks== Unable to record, Jon and Lee & The Checkmates concentrated on extending their fan base beyond southern Ontario into the northern United States, establishing pockets of support in New York and Philadelphia. In New York, they followed their engagement at the Peppermint Lounge with 2 weeks at the Phone Booth (early February 1966). In June, they appeared on a concert bill at Shea Stadium with The Temptations, The Chiffons and Junior Walker & the All Stars. Throughout 1966, the band also consolidated its Toronto following, holding down a residency at the Avenue Road Club, and appearing at other notable venues such as the Broom and Stone, the Gogue Inn and the Hawk's Nest. In the fall, while in New York again, an important production deal was struck with B.B.& D. Productions [Daniel Secunda (cousin of Procol Harum‚Äôs manager Tony Secunda), Billy Barberis and Bobby Weinstein]. The initial agreement called for the recording of 4 sides in late winter-early spring of \`67 ==1967: the Jon-Lee Group== In the early months of 1967, Jon and Lee & The Checkmates increasingly spent time in New York and Philadelphia, only returning to Toronto intermittently to play shows. It was at this time, the trio of Secunda, Barberis and Weinstein took the band into the studio to record the four sides, which were later leased to ABC Records to coincide with a show at Steve Paul's The Scene. A cover of John Sebastian's \\"Girl, Beautiful Girl,\\" (to have been the band's debut single) was put aside in favor of \\"Bring It Down Front\\", written by Nashville hit songwriter, Eddie Reeves and Bobby Weinstein (Teddy Randazzo co-writer of Little Anthony hits), b/w the Duke Edwards' instrumental \\"Pork Chops\\". Issued during July, \\"Bring It Down Front\\" failed to chart in the US but was a hit back home in Canada on Sparton Records, reaching #10 on the Toronto CHUM chart, and #23 on the national RPM chart in October. Sadly, the band soon began to unravel, unable to come up with the needed original material for an album as requested by B.B.& D. They played their final show in Philadelphia on September 16, 1967. ==Falling apart== Jackson, who had lost interest in being a singer, left the band to work initially as a road manager for Bruce Cockburn‚Äôs new group, The Flying Circus. He then became a promoter under his real name, Michael Ferry. Finley also left to reassess his musical future, leaving the remaining members to travel to New York with future Blood, Sweat & Tears singer David Clayton-Thomas and perform at The Scene. Billed as David Clayton-Thomas & The Phoenix, the group performed at least one set of shows (from October 19‚Äì22) before Thomas was deported back to Toronto for being an illegal immigrant. ==Aftermath== Finley and Fonfara went on to become founding members of Rhinoceros in early 1968; Hodgson joined in April 1969, with Edwards and Leishman being recruited later in August. Jeff Cutler, who also remained in New York, later joined The Crazy World of Arthur Brown for its second US tour in May 1968 and then worked with The Holy Modal Rounders. ==The Checkmates return== In 1999, Michael Fonfara, Peter Hodgson and Larry Leishman reformed The Checkmates for live dates in Toronto. In 2005, John Finley rejoined the band and the group released their debut album in 2006. ==Personnel== ;Current members *Michael Fonfara - piano (1963-1967, 1999-present) *Larry Leishman - guitar (1963-1967, 1999-present) *Peter Hodgson - bass (1963-1967, 1999-present) *John Finley - vocals (1963-1967, 2005-present) ;Former members *Lee Jackson - vocals (1962-1967) *Paul Carrier - drums (1962-1963) *Dave McDeavitt - bass (1962-1963) *Al D'Orsay - guitar (1962-1963) *Hilmar Hajek - saxophone (1962-1967) *Dave Brown - drums (1963) *Wes Morris - drums (1963) *Jeff Cutler - drums (1963) *David Clayton-Thomas - vocals (1967) ==Discography== *\\"Bring It Down Front\\" / \\"Pork Chops\\" - (Sparton P1617) - 1967 ==Sources== * John Finley, interviews with Bill Munson, 1978 and Nick Warburton * Michael Ferry, interview with Bill Munson, 1978 * Peter Hodgson, interview Nick Warburton * Larry Leishman, interviews with Bill Munson, 1978 and Nick Warburton * Michael Fonfara, interview with Nick Warburton * Rhinoceros-group.com * The Toronto Telegram's After Four section on Thursdays listed live dates in the city Category:Canadian rhythm and blues music groups ","title":"Jon and Lee &amp; the Checkmates"},{"id":"6225188","text":"A correctory (plural correctories) is any of the text-forms of the Latin Vulgate resulting from the critical emendation as practised during the course of the thirteenth century. ==Antecedents== Owing to the carelessness of transcribers, the conjectural corrections of critics, the insertion of glosses and paraphrases, and especially to the preference for readings found in the earlier Latin versions, the text of St. Jerome was corrupted at an early date. Around 550 CE, Cassiodorus made an attempt at restoring the purity of the Latin text. Charlemagne entrusted the same labour to Alcuin, who presented his royal patron with a corrected copy in 801. Similar attempts were repeated by Theodulphus, Bishop of Orl√©ans [787(?) ‚Äì 821], Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury (1070‚Äì1089), Stephen Harding, Abbot of C√Æteaux (1109‚Äì1134), and Deacon Nicolaus Maniacoria (about the beginning of the thirteenth century). ==Dominican== The general chapter of the Dominicans held in 1236 connects a corrected text of the Latin Bible with the members of the province of France; it ordained that all Bibles should be conformed to this. Little more is known of this work but the following correctories are more noted: * The \\"Biblia Senonensis\\", or the Bible of Sens, is not the Paris Bible as approved of by the Archbishop of Sens, nor is it a particular text adopted by the ecclesiastical authority of that city, but it is a correction of the Paris Bible prepared by the Dominican Fathers residing there. Whatever be the value of this correctory, it did not meet with the approval of the Dominican Order, as may be inferred from an ordination of the general chapter held in Paris, 1256. Quotations from it found in the \\"Correctorium Sorbonicum\\" resemble the readings of the Latin manuscript No. 17 in the National Library, Paris. The fathers of Sens failed to produce a satisfactory text because they were too sparing in their emendation of the Paris Bible. * Hugues of Saint-Cher tried to restore the primitive text of the Latin Vulgate, which in his day was practically identical with the Paris Bible, by removing its glosses and all foreign accretions. But instead of having recourse to the manuscripts of St. Jerome's text he compared the Paris Bible with the original Hebrew and Greek readings, thus furnishing a new version rather than a correctory. Roger Bacon calls his work \\"the worst corruption, the destruction of the text of God\\". Eight manuscripts of Hugues' correctory are still extant. * Theobald is the name of the Dominican Father who is usually connected with the next correction of the Latin Vulgate text, which appeared about 1248. The text of this too resembles that of the Latin manuscript No. 17 in the National Library, Paris, and is thus related to the \\"Correctorium Senonense\\". It may be identical with the \\"Correctio Parisiensis secunda\\", quoted in the \\"Correctorium Sorbonicum\\". * Another correctory was prepared about 1256 in the Dominican convent of Saint-Jacques, Paris. The manuscript thus corrected contains a text as bad as, if not worse than the Bible of Paris, the readings of which were carried into the new correctory. The principles of Hugues of Saint-Cher were followed by the correctors, who marked in red the words to be omitted, and added marginal notes to explain changes and suggest variants. They are more copious in the Old Testament than in the New. The autograph is preserved in the National Library, Paris, Manuscripts lat. 16,719-16,722. ==Franciscan== The Franciscan writer Roger Bacon was the first to formulate the true principles which ought to guide the correction of the Latin Vulgate; his religious brethren endeavoured to apply them, though not always successfully. * The \\"Correctorium Sorbonicum\\", probably the work of William of Brittany, was so-named because the thirteenth-century manuscript in which the emendations were made belonged to the Library of the Parsian Sorbonne university, though at present it is kept in the National Library, Paris, Manuscript lat. 15554, fol. 147-253. The marginal and interlinear glosses are derived from the Paris Bible and the correctory of the Dominican Father Theobald; the make-up of the work imitates the Dominican correctories. * The \\"Correctorium Vaticanum\\" owes its name to the circumstance that its first known manuscript was the Cod. Vaticanus lat. 3466, though at present eight other copies are known, belonging to the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century. Its author is William de Mara, of Oxford, a disciple of Roger Bacon, whose principles and methods he follows. Though acquainted with several Latin and Hebrew manuscripts, the Targum, the commentaries of Rashi, and the original texts, he relied more on the authority of the early manuscripts of St. Jerome's text. There are some faults in the correctory, resulting mainly from the author's limited knowledge of Greek. * G√©rard de Huy was a faithful follower of Roger Bacon's principles; the old Latin manuscripts and the readings of the Fathers are his first authority, and only when they disagree does he have recourse to the original texts. He knew no Latin manuscripts older than those of the ninth and tenth centuries containing a text of Alcuin's recension. But G√©rard knew the history of the versions and the origin of the textual corruptions of the Sacred Scriptures. He corrected the Paris Bible and gave an account of his emendations in his marginal notes. * Two more Franciscan correctories are Manuscript 61 (Toulouse), of the fifteenth century, which reproduces the correctory of G√©rard de Buxo, of Avignon, a work rather exegetical than critical in character; and Manuscript 28 (Einsiedeln), of the beginning of the fourteenth century, containing the work of John of Cologne. ==Allied== Mangenot mentions six other groups of correctories which have not been fully investigated yet. Two of them are allied to the Dominican correctory of the convent of Saint-Jacques; one is represented by the Manuscript lat. 15,554, fol. 1‚Äì146, National Library, Paris; the other by Cod. Laurent., Plut., XXV, sin., cod. 4, fol. 101‚Äì107 (Florence), and by Manuscript 131, fol. 1, Arsenal, Paris. Two other groups are allied to the Franciscan correctories; one, represented by Cod. 141, lat. class. I, fol. 121-390, Marciana (Venice), depends on William de Mara and G√©rard de Huy; the other, found in Manuscript 82, Borges. (Rome), depends on G√©rard de Huy. Finally two very brief correctories are to be found in Manuscript 492, Antoniana, Padua, and in Manuscript Cent. I, 47, fol. 127, N√ºrenberg. ==ReferencesSources== * Category:Bible versions and translations ","title":"Correctory"},{"id":"6225198","text":"231x231px Tiversk or Tiurinlinna (, ) is a site of ancient Karelian settlement and a ruined fortification near Melnikovo (R√§is√§l√§ in Finnish) in the Karelian Isthmus.

The island is approximately long and wide. The oldest findings indicating settlement on the site are dated between 500BC‚Äì300AD. Several researchers have come to the conclusion that the site served as a fortification in the 11th century and possibly even earlier. Anatoly Kirpichnikov asserts that the fortification was founded in the late 1330s. Archaeologists have found stone foundations of 19 buildings which varied in size between and . There has also been one much larger building with a floor area of and a hearth in the middle of the building. The Treaty of N√∂teborg established a Novgorodian-Swedish border in the immediate vicinity and left the fort on the Novgorodian side. Kirpichnikov believes that Karelian Vallittu who ruled the Korela Fortress started building Tiversk after the treaty. The fort is mentioned for the first time in the Nikon Chronicle in 1404 when the settlement was granted to Prince Yury of Smolensk as an appanage. Seven years later, the fort was sacked and destroyed by the Swedes during one of the Swedish-Novgorodian Wars. The site of Tiversk was first identified and described by Jacob Groot in 1847. The remnants were excavated in 1888‚Äì1891 by Hjalmar Appelgren, Theodor Schwindt and Alfred Hackman,Appelgren, Hjalmar. Suomen muinaislinnat. Suomen Muinaismuistoyhdistyksen Aikakauskirja XII.

In 1890, archaeological works revealed a treasure trove of 13th‚Äì15th century Arabic silver coins. Some remnants dated 10th‚Äìearly 12th century have also been discovered.

He played in Major League Baseball as an infielder from 1962 to 1971 for the Chicago White Sox and the New York Mets. A light-hitting batter with only seven career home runs, he is notable for hitting a dramatic home run in Game 5 of the World Series. He was a switch hitter until the end of the 1968 season, after which he batted exclusively right-handed. ==Early years== Weis grew up in Bethpage, New York, and graduated from Farmingdale High School in 1955. He was a high school teammate of pitcher Jack Lamabe, with whom he was teammates on the Chicago White Sox in and . Weis joined the United States Navy after high school. It was playing baseball at Naval Station Norfolk where Weis caught the eye of the White Sox, with whom he signed as an amateur free agent in . After four years in their farm system, in which he batted .266 with fifteen home runs and 159 runs batted in, Weis received a September call-up in , batting only .083 in seven games. ==Chicago White Sox== Weis played 99 games as a utility infielder in his rookie season of , with 48 of those games at second base and 27 at shortstop. Following the trade of Nellie Fox during the off-season, Weis became more of a second baseman in , although he still made nine appearances at shortstop, including 4 starts. He batted .247 and established career highs with 81 hits and 22 stolen bases, second in the American League to Hall of Famer Luis Aparicio. That year, the White Sox finished second in a tight American League pennant race, one game behind the New York Yankees and one game ahead of the Baltimore Orioles. Don Buford was named the everyday White Sox second baseman for the season, with Weis returning to utility infield duties. He remained in that role for the remainder of his tenure with the White Sox, which ended on June 27, 1967 when the Baltimore Orioles‚Äô Frank Robinson broke Weis' leg while sliding into second to break up a double play. After the season, he and former Rookie of the Year center fielder Tommie Agee were traded to the New York Mets for Tommy Davis, Jack Fisher, Buddy Booker and Billy Wynne. ==New York Mets== Though Mets manager Gil Hodges acquired Weis primarily for his glove, he earned the dubious distinction of being the player whose error ended the longest game by time in Major League Baseball history on April 15, in his Mets debut. In the bottom of the 24th inning against the Houston Astros in the Astrodome, Weis allowed Bob Aspromonte's bases-loaded ground ball to go through his legs, scoring Norm Miller with the lone run of the game. For the season, Weis batted .172 with one home run and twelve RBIs, backing up Bud Harrelson and Ken Boswell at the middle infield positions. Weis developed the flair for the dramatic home run during the season. On July 15, facing the first place Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, he hit a three run home run off former Met Dick Selma to lead the second place Mets to a 5-4 victory. Weis hit his second of two home runs for the season the following day, and the Mets won again to close the gap to just four games in the National League East. The Cubs widened that gap back up to ten games before the Mets began the improbable surge that saw them take first place on September 10, and win the division by eight games to face the Atlanta Braves in the first ever National League Championship Series. Ken Boswell was the star of the 1969 National League Championship Series, hitting two home runs, and leading his team with five RBIs. Weis, meanwhile, only logged one at bat, reaching first on a Clete Boyer error in the ninth inning of game two. However, he received far more playing time in the World Series. The National League and American League's Cy Young Award winners faced off in game one of the World Series. The Orioles scored four runs in five innings off Tom Seaver. Meanwhile, Mike Cuellar pitched a complete game, with Weis' sacrifice fly in the seventh inning accounting for the only Mets run. The Mets' slim chances of beating the heavily favored Orioles seemed even slimmer when Jerry Koosman and Dave McNally took the mound for game two of the series. Both pitchers were at their best, and the score was tied at one when Weis came to the plate with two outs in the ninth inning. With runners on first and third, Weis singled to left field to drive in the game winning run. Koosman and McNally faced each other again in game five, with the Mets holding a commanding three to one game lead. McNally got his team on the board first with a two run home run in the third. Three batters later, Frank Robinson hit a solo home run to bring the Orioles' lead to 3-0. Donn Clendenon's two run shot in the sixth brought the score to 3-2. Leading off the seventh, Weis took McNally deep to left field to tie the game. The Mets scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth to seal their improbable World Series win. For the series, the career .219 hitter batted .455 with three RBIs. Clendenon was named World Series MVP, while Weis received the Series' Babe Ruth Award. Weis' playing time in the second half of the season diminished substantially when former first overall draft pick Tim Foli was brought up to the majors. He was released by the Mets midway through the season, having appeared in just eleven games that year. ==Career statistics== {  - Games PA AB Runs Hits 2B 3B HR RBI SB BB HBP SO Avg. OBP Slg.

He batted .260 with two home runs and 25 RBIs in the month of July for his career, far better than any other month. Weis fared far better against lefties than righties, having hit five of his seven career home runs with a .235 average against southpaws. All seven of his regular season home runs were hit as a visiting player. The only home run he ever hit in a home stadium was the World Series home run off McNally at Shea Stadium. McNally is also the only pitcher Weis has hit two home runs against, serving up his second career home run on June 18, 1964. ==References *Al Weis at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Al Weis at Ultimate Mets Database * Category:1938 births Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:New York Mets players Category:Holdrege White Sox players Category:Lincoln Chiefs players Category:Charleston White Sox players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Baseball players from New York (state) Category:Living people Category:People from Bethpage, New York Category:People from Franklin Square, New York Category:People from Farmingdale, New York Category:People from Elmhurst, Illinois Category:Farmingdale High School alumni ","title":"Al Weis"},{"id":"6225320","text":"Carl Boberg Carl Gustav Boberg (16 August 1859 ‚Äì 7 January 1940) was a Swedish poet and elected official, best known for writing the Swedish language poem of \\"O Store Gud\\" (O Great God) from which the English language hymn \\"How Great Thou Art\\" is derived. ==Biographical details== Born in M√∂nster√•s, Kalmar County in Sm√•land, Boberg was a carpenter's son, worked briefly as a sailor, and served as a lay minister in the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden.

The current director of athletics is Peter Pilling. ==Ivy League athletics== The eight-institution athletic league to which Columbia University belongs, the Ivy League, also includes Brown University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The Ivy League conference sponsors championships in 33 men's and women's sports and averages 35 varsity teams at each of its eight universities. The League provides intercollegiate athletic opportunities for more men and women than any other conference in the United States. All eight Ivy schools are listed in the top 20 NCAA Division I schools in number of sports offered for both men and women. ==The Lions== Columbia's Mascot \\"Roaree the Lion\\" at a football game, 2018 Columbia University was founded in 1754 and currently fields 31 co-ed, men's, and women's teams. Women's teams are cooperatively organized with the affiliated Barnard College. All Columbia teams compete at the Division I level in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The school's football team competes at the NCAA Division I FCS level. In 1910, the school adopted the lion mascot as a reference to the institution's royal past. The University was originally named King's College since its charter in 1754 by King George II of Great Britain. It became Columbia College in 1784, after the American Revolution. It became Columbia University in 1896 with the move to its current location in Upper Manhattan. ===History=== A 19th-century football match between Columbia and Harvard Intercollegiate sports at Columbia date to the foundation of the baseball team in 1867. Men's association football (i.e. soccer) followed in 1870, and men's crew in 1873. Men's Crew was one of Columbia's best early sports, and in 1878 the Columbia College Boat Club was the first foreign crew to win a race at the Henley Royal Regatta‚Äîconsidered to be Columbia's greatest athletic achievement. The third ever men's intercollegiate soccer match was played between Columbia and Rutgers University, with Rutgers winning 6 to 3. Columbia joined the American football movement soon after Harvard and Yale played their first game in 1875‚Äîin 1876, Columbia, Harvard, and Princeton University formed the Intercollegiate Football Association.Harvard Athletics: A Timeline of Tradition In addition, the Lions' wrestling team is the nation's oldest. The Columbia football team won the Rose Bowl in 1934, upsetting Stanford University 7‚Äì0. Columbia also hosted the first televised sporting event: on May 17, 1939, the fledgling NBC network filmed the baseball double- header of the Light Blue versus the Princeton University Tigers at Columbia's Baker Field at the northernmost point in Manhattan.Baker Field: Birthplace of Sports Television == Sports sponsored == {  style=\\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\\" - -  Baseball  Archery -  Basketball Basketball -  Cross country  Cross country -  Football  Field hockey -  Golf  Golf -  Heavyweight rowing  Lacrosse -  Lightweight rowing  Rowing -  Soccer  Soccer -  Squash  Softball -  Swimming and diving  Squash -  Tennis  Swimming and diving -  Track and field‚Ä†  Tennis -  Wrestling  Track and field‚Ä† -   Volleyball -  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"; text-align:center\\"  Co-ed sports -   colspan=\\"2\\" Fencing -  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"\\"  } ===Archery=== The women's archery team became a varsity sport at Barnard in 1978 and was absorbed into the Columbia-Barnard Athletic Consortium when Columbia College became co-educational in 1983. Archers compete in both the recurve (Olympic) and compound divisions. Until 2003, the team consisted exclusively of walk-ons with little prior experience; as of 2020, most archers are recruited similar to other varsity sports. Columbia also fields a club- level archery team for male archers and female students interested in learning the sport. Columbia won outdoor national championships in 2005 (recurve), 2008 (recurve), 2011 (recurve), 2013 (recurve), 2015 (recurve and compound), 2017 (recurve and compound), and 2018 (compound). In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, five Lions archers were named to the Collegiate Archery All-American team. ===Football=== The Lions compete in the Ivy League, which is part of the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. Columbia was one of the first schools to take up the game; Columbia's 1870 contest with Princeton was the first football game played between future Ivy League Schools and their contest against Rutgers that same year was the fourth intercollegiate football game ever played. During the first half of the 20th century the Columbia Lions were a national power and at times the best football program in the nation. The 1875 squad was named National Champion and the 1915 squad went undefeated and untied.NCAA Records Books: Football Records ‚Äì 2006 Division I-A/I-AA Football Records Book The 1933 edition of the Lions won an unofficial national championship by upsetting the top-ranked Stanford Indians 7‚Äì0 in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day 1934. Lou Little, who coached the team from 1930 to 1956, is in the College Football Hall of Fame. Pro and College Football Hall of Fame inductee, Sid Luckman, an NFL MVP and 4-Time NFL Champion played his entire college football career at Columbia. Lou Gehrig additionally played for the Columbia Lions during this period. Between 1983 and 1988, a period of financial instability for New York City and Columbia University, the Lions lost 44 games in a row. The streak was broken with a 16‚Äì13 victory over archrival Princeton. That was the Lions' first victory at Wien Stadium (which was already four years old, having been opened during the streak). Pro Football Hall of Famer Sid Luckman played his college ball at Columbia, graduating in 1938. Luckman is also in the College Football Hall of Fame. Other Lions to have success in the NFL include offensive lineman George Starke, the Washington Redskins' \\"Head Hog,\\" during the 1970s and 1980s, quarterback John Witkowski in the 1980s, and defensive lineman Marcellus Wiley in the 1990s. Perhaps the most famous personality associated with Lions football was a running back who had limited success on the field: the writer Jack Kerouac left school and went on the road after one injury-marred season at Columbia. Another Lions back who became legendary for his accomplishments off the gridiron was baseball great Lou Gehrig, who was a two-sport star at Columbia. Norries Wilson is the first African-American head coach in the history of Ivy League football. He served as the Lions' head coach from 2005 to 2011. Former Penn Quakers football coach Al Bagnoli became Columbia's head coach on February 23, 2015. Columbia and Cornell play for the Empire Cup, emblematic for Ivy League supremacy in New York State. Beginning in 2018 the will play each other in their season finale. Bowl games { class= ! Season Bowl colspan=\\"2\\"  Champion  colspan=\\"2\\"  Runner-Up -  1934  Rose Bowl  Columbia  7  Stanford 0 } ===Baseball=== Lou Gehrig played college baseball at Columbia (he joined the New York Yankees in 1923, after his sophomore season) as well as Hall of Fame inductee Eddie Collins. In 1939 the first live televised sporting event in the United States, was a Columbia vs Princeton baseball game, broadcast from Baker Field in New York City. Other Columbia Lions who have gone on to play in Major League Baseball include Gene Larkin and Fernando Perez. The team plays at Hal Robertson Field at Phillip Satow Stadium, located at the northern tip of Manhattan. ===Men's basketball=== Columbia was one of the first schools to take up basketball. The Lions' rivalry with the Yale Bulldogs is the longest continuous rivalry in NCAA college basketball (tied with the Yale-Princeton rivalry): the two teams have played each other for 108 seasons in a row, going back to the 1901‚Äì1902 season. The Lions were retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA Tournament 1904 and 1905 national champions by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll, and as the 1904, 1905, and 1910 national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation. During the years just before the Ivy League formally became a sports conference, the Lions made it to \\"March Madness\\" on two occasions. In 1948, they were one of eight teams in the tournament, losing in the East regional semifinal to the eventual champion Kentucky. The 1951 team went undefeated in the regular season and were one of the 16 teams invited to the championship. The Lions lost 79‚Äì71 to eventual semi-finalist Illinois for a final record of 21‚Äì1 (best record in the nation that year with win-loss percentage of .956)NCAA Records Books: Basketball Records The 1951 team is, however, sadly best known for the tragic story of its brilliant but troubled star forward Jack Molinas, who eventually ended up in prison for crimes related his longtime involvement with gambling and who was murdered in 1975 in what appeared to be an organized-crime related assassination. Molinas still holds several school scoring records. In 1957 Chet Forte was a consensus All- American and UPI player of the year for NCAA Division I; he averaged 28.9 points (fifth in the nation.) He is even more famous for his later work as a producer for ABC Sports, especially on the program Monday Night Football. The 1957 team had 2,016 rebounds, fourth highest in NCAA Division I history, even though they played only 24 games. The Lions have only won the official Ivy League championship once, in 1968, when they reached the \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" in the NCAA national tournament. Two members of the 1968 team went on to play professional basketball: Jim McMillian and Dave Newmark. (NFL great George Starke was also a member of the Lions' basketball team in that era.) Jack Rohan was voted Coach of the Year in 1968. The Lions had a powerful squad in the late 1970s, even though they never won the Ivy League championship or made it to post-season play. In 1979, the diminutive point guard Alton Byrd won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award, given to the best player under 6 feet in height. Byrd never made it to the NBA, but he moved on to a legendary career in European pro basketball. ===Women's basketball=== Until the 1980s, the women's basketball team (like the other women's teams) was known as the Barnard Bears, playing under the aegis of Columbia's affiliated undergraduate women's college, Barnard College. When Columbia College went co-ed in 1983, the schools formed the Columbia-Barnard Athletic Consortium, and today all Barnard athletes compete on Columbia teams. The women's basketball team joined the Ivy League in 1986‚Äì1987, and for many years were a perennial cellar dweller, reaching their low point in 1994‚Äì1995, when they went 0‚Äì26. They had never finished higher than fourth in the league standings in their first 23 seasons. In 2009‚Äì2010, however, they finished third, putting together a 9‚Äì5 record in the Ivy League, and, at 18‚Äì10 overall, their first winning season. ===Soccer=== Columbia's soccer program traces its origins to the same Columbia-Rutgers game that the gridiron football program counts as its first contest. (The 1870 Columbia-Rutgers game was played by a set of rules which combined elements of present-day soccer and rugby.) The Lions soccer team has a long history of success, spanning three centuries, highlighted by national collegiate championships in 1909 and 1910 (Intercollegiate Soccer Football League), and a second-place finish in the 1983 NCAA championship.College Soccer Championships www.sover.net. URL accessed February 9, 2007NCAA Records Books: Soccer Records Dieter Ficken was named NSCAA Coach of the Year in 1983 after the Lions' 1‚Äì0 double-overtime finals loss to seven-time champion Indiana University. 18 Lions players have been first-team all-Americans, and Amr Aly earned the 1984 Hermann Trophy national player of the year award. The women's team was the 2006 Ivy League champions. In 2016, the men's soccer team were Co-Ivy League Champions. ===Women's cross-country=== * Caroline Bierbaum won the 2005 women's cross country Honda Sports Award (most outstanding NCAA women's cross country athlete of the year) and was NCAA Division I runner-up with a time of 19:46.0Columbia's Caroline Bierbaum Wins Honda Award www.sover.net.

Columbia University had a team represented early on in the American intercollegiate ice hockey circuit. Columbia had a team organized already during the 1896‚Äì97 season and during the 1897‚Äì98 campaign the university appeared in the Intercollegiate Hockey Association (IHA) alongside teams from Yale, Brown and University of Pennsylvania,Hockey Columbia Daily Spectator, Mar. 16, 1898. pg. 40 and the school was continuously represented in organized ice hockey league games against other Ivy League institutions (Yale, Brown, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth and Cornell) up until the early 1910s. As of 2020, Columbia does not have a varsity ice hockey team. Columbia does participate at the club level, competing in the American Collegiate Hockey Association. ===Men's rowing=== Columbia College, winners of the Visitors' Challenge Cup in 1878 Columbia's first intercollegiate regatta dates back to 1873, when it raced a six-oared shell in Springfield, Massachusetts. The next year, Columbia won the intercollegiate title at Saratoga. * In 2018, both the men's 1st and 2nd varsity lightweight eights and won gold medals at the Eastern Sprints.

The 1928 crew won over Penn by five boat-lengths. In 1929 the varsity lightweight eight was undefeated in match racing, and captured 2nd place at the American Henley before traveling to England where they won the Marlow Regatta and made it to the semifinals of the Thames Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. It was Columbia's first return to Henley since their 1878 victory, and it marked the first-ever appearance of a lightweight crew at Henley. They were the first lightweight crew to be awarded a Varsity \\"Major C\\" for creating a favorable impression abroad and adding rowing honors to Columbia and to the sport in the United States. * In 1895, with Cornell and Penn, the Lions competed in the first-ever race for the college championship and finished first. This would come to be known as the Poughkeepsie Regatta, a competition to award the national intercollegiate rowing crown. Presently, this race is known as the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta.

His winning time in the 60-yard dash was 5.9 seconds, breaking the world record of 6.2 seconds for the third time in the same day. His final time of 5.9 seconds was rounded up to 6.0 seconds, because the referees claimed it must have been a timing error, arguing that no human being could ever break 6 seconds in the 60-yard dash. * In 2007, Columbia won the Championship of America 4 √ó 800 m race at the prestigious Penn Relays. The team of Michael Mark, Jonah Rathbun, Erison Hurtalt, and Liam Boylan-Pett ran 7:22.64, outkicking the anchor legs of national powerhouses Michigan, Villanova, and Oral Roberts. The team has finished no lower than fifth in the past three years. *In March 2010, Kyle Merber became the first Columbia athlete to break four minutes in the mile, running 3:58.52 at the Columbia Last Chance Meet at the 168th St. Armory.

Dick,Indiewire.com though elements of the Nourse novel recur in a pair of 2002 films also largely adapted from Dick's work, Impostor and Minority Report. ==Plot== The novel's protagonist is Billy Gimp, a man with a club foot who runs \\"blades\\" for Doc (Doctor John Long) as part of an illegal black market for medical services. The setting is a society where free, comprehensive medical treatment is available for anyone so long as they qualify for treatment under the Eugenics Laws. Preconditions for medical care include sterilization, and no legitimate medical care is available for anyone who does not qualify or does not wish to undergo the sterilization procedure (including children over the age of five). These conditions have created illegal medical services in which bladerunners supply black market medical supplies for underground practitioners, who generally go out at night to see patients and perform surgery.

This was published as Blade Runner (a movie). Burroughs acknowledged the Nourse novel as a source, and prominently set a mutated virus and right-wing politics in the year 1999. No film was produced from the Burroughs treatment, but Hampton Fancher, a screenwriter for a film based on Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?), had a copy. He suggested \\"Blade Runner\\", as preferable to the earlier working titles \\"Android\\" and \\"Dangerous Days\\", for the Dick adaptation.Abraham Riesman (4 October 2017). \\"Digging Into the Odd History of Blade Runner‚Äôs Title\\". Vulture. Accessed 10 October 2017. In the film, released as Blade Runner in 1982, the term is never explained, and the plot has no connection to the Nourse and Burroughs stories. Ridley Scott bought any rights to the title Blade Runner that might have arisen from either the Nourse novel or the Burroughs treatment. Two more of Dick's short stories, \\"Impostor\\" and \\"The Minority Report\\", were adapted into 2002 films, Impostor and Minority Report, respectively; both films heavily feature underground medical smuggling and procedures among an underclass, as in Nourse's novel, and these elements are not present in either of the Dick short stories. ==References * Category:1974 American novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:1974 science fiction novels Category:Dystopian novels Category:Blade Runner (franchise) Category:Sterilization in fiction Category:Eugenics in fiction Category:Medicine and health in fiction Category:Infectious diseases in fiction ","title":"The Bladerunner"},{"id":"6225439","text":"Aanes is a Norwegian surname.

Recent reforms in the Russian Federation created a new network of federal universities. This trend towards integration and modernization in higher university education is typical of many countries. As international experience shows, additional financial support from government promotes the high quality of education and higher performance in international rankings. The North- Eastern Federal University is to become a strategic center for the formation of a common cultural, scientific and educational space, based on the values of indigenous culture of the peoples of the northeast of Russia, providing quality personal education in a multiethnic environment. The NEFU development program towards the year 2020 was approved by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on October 7, 2010. The following priority areas were identified: * the new quality of the university; * efficient environmental management and environmental security; * efficient use of mineral resources; * the use of science-based technologies and production in the North; * the quality of life in the north; * the preservation and development of languages and cultures; * the analytical and personnel support for innovative socio-economic development of the northeastern part of the Russian Federation. In all areas of university activities large-scale transformations have been initiated, primarily to create a unified scientific and methodological foundation.

Polatsk, Belarus Boris stone in Druya Boris Stones (, ; ), also called Dvina Stones (), are seven medieval artifacts erected along the bank of the Western Dvina between Polotsk and Drissa, Belarus. They probably predate Christianity in the area, but were inscribed in the 12th century with text and an image of Christ. The largest of the stones is 17 metres in circumference. ==History== Although these landmarks were described in the 16th century by Maciej Stryjkowski, it was Georg von Cancrin in 1818 who first brought them to scholarly attention. Cancrin discovered that a boulder near Orsha had the following inscription: \\"In the year 1171, on the 7th day of March, was completed this cross. Lord, please help your servant Basil, whose other name is Rogvolod, Boris' son\\".Franklin 74-75. Subsequently, several other boulders with Boris's name were discovered. In the 1930s, two of these were blown up by Communist authorities as religious objects and their remains used to pave the road between Minsk and Moscow. Another one was thrown into the river, where it lay until its discovery in 1988. When an attempt to recover it was made, the stone broke apart into three pieces. Three other boulders were moved to be exhibited near St. Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk, in the Museum of Boulders in Minsk, and in Kolomenskoe near Moscow. ==Description== Both names for the stones are somewhat misleading: only four of them are located along the banks of the Dvina, and one of the stones does not mention Boris at all. What unites them is their programmatic illustration: \\"In each case the centrepiece is an enormous cross flanked by abbreviated elements of the conventional Greek legend proclaiming Christ's victory\\".Franklin 74-75.

The spelling has changed however now, so it can also mean a kind of plant (Momordica charantia) that grows in swamps. ==Geography== Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Wiset Chai Chan and Pa Mok of Ang Thong Province; Bang Ban, Sena, and Bang Sai of Ayutthaya Province; and Bang Pla Ma, and Mueang Suphanburi of Suphanburi Province. ==Administration== The district is divided into 16 sub-districts (tambon), which are further subdivided into 128 villages (muban). { 1.Phak Hai‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏Å‡πÑ‡∏´‡πà - 2.Ammarit‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏§‡∏ï - 3.Ban Khae‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏Ñ - 4.Lat Nam Khem‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏Ñ‡πá‡∏° - 5.Talan‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ô - 6.Tha Din Daeng‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏î‡∏á - 7.Don Lan‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ô - 8.Na Khu‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏π - 9.Kudi‡∏Å‡∏∏‡∏é‡∏µ - 10.Lam Takhian‡∏•‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏Ñ‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô - 11.Khok Chang‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏Å‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á - 12.Chakkarat‡∏à‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä - 13.Nong Nam Yai‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏ç‡πà - 14.Lat Chit‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏î - 15.Na Khok‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏Å - 16.Ban Yai‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏ç‡πà } ==In media== Phak Hai is the setting of a Thai country song, (luk thung), titled (; ) 'Phak Hai Girl').

The song is in the key of F# minor at a tempo of 123 bpm. The verses of the song are an excerpt from the Lord's Prayer in German, followed by a bastardization in the second verse. For example, the second line \\"Geheilgt werde dein Name\\" (Hallowed be thy name), becomes \\"Geheiligt werde die L√ºge\\" (Hallowed be the lie). The chorus of the song features repeated chants of \\"Gott ist ein Popstar!\\" followed by lines likening religion to a stage show. In order to rhyme better, two of the chorus lines were rewritten for the English version \\"God is a Popstar\\" on the Truth or Dare album, rather than being a simple German translation. \\"Der Applaus ist gro√ü\\" (The applause is great), became \\"Hear the screaming crowd,\\" and \\"Ihm geh√∂rt die Welt\\" (The world belongs to him), became \\"Master of it all.\\" ==Video== The music video starts with the band pulling up to what appears to be a depiction of Jesus Christ in a back alley. They take the Messiah and transform him into a young and sexy pop idol. The end of the video ends with a bloodied popstar version of Jesus being revived in the same alley where he was in the beginning of the video. Dero, the singer, is shown as a depiction of the Grim Reaper. ==Controversy== After its release, the song caused a great deal of controversy and negative criticism from religious groups who condemned the song as heretical. The band's performance at the 2006 ECHO Awards was canceled due to the questionable nature of the song, and many radio stations throughout Germany boycotted the track. However, the band responded to these claims, by stating that the song is about hypocrisy in modern organized religion and was not intended to be heretical. == Track listing == CD Single # Gott ist ein Popstar # Ich will deine Seele (\\"I Want Your Soul\\") CD Maxi # Gott ist ein Popstar # Ich will deine Seele (\\"I Want Your Soul\\") # Wei√üt du wie viel Sterne stehen (\\"Do you know how many stars there are?\\") # Fragment # Gott ist ein Popstar!

Truro: Dean & Chapter; p. 105 Docco is said to have come with his sister Kew from Gwent in south Wales to Cornwall and founded at St Kew a religious centre known as Lan Docco. St Samson first visited Lan Docco when he came to Cornwall in the early 6th- century, was greeted by Junavius and well treated there. This implies that Kew and Docco were either dead or not in charge of the centre by that time.Ellis, P. B. (1992) The Cornish Saints.

The manor, which was dismembered in circa 1700, belonged to the Treharrick family many years before the Reformation and passed by marriage to the Cavell family.

The windows were the most \\"memorable\\" part of Nikolaus Pevsner's visit.Pevsner, N. (1970) Buildings of England: Cornwall (1951; 1970) (rev. Enid Radcliffe). Penguin Books (reissued by Yale U.

He notes the carved capitals, the wagon roof, the 15th century font, bench ends, a 15th-century cross-head and the Royal Arms, in stone. There is a curious Ogham stone, found in a local farm, in the church. According to Charles Henderson, writing in the Cornish Church Guide (1925), the tracery and stonework of some windows at St Kew may have been transferred here from Bodmin Parish Church. The dedication was originally to St Docco but in the mid-15th century the patroness of a chapel (St Kewa, Virgin) nearby was transferred to the parish church when the church building was enlarged. Two other chapels existed in the parish in the late medieval period, one of St Wenna, and another of St Aldhelm at Chapel Amble (in Cornish: An Heyle 'by the estuary').Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 119‚Äì121 Edward Benson, the Bishop of Truro reopened the church on 24 July 1883 following a restoration. ===Gallery: The church of St James=== File:DSCN1857StKewChurch.jpg Church with ancient cross File:DSCN1878StKewChurchCaptal.jpgDecorated capital in church File:DSCN1890StKewChurchPulpit.jpgPulpit of the church File:DSCN1886StKewChurchMemorial.jpgDetail of face ‚Äì slate memorial at the church File:DSCN1887StKewChurchWindow.jpgPassion of Christ at the church ==St Kew Highway railway station== Railway bridge at St Kew Highway St Kew Highway The station on the North Cornwall Railway opened on 1 June 1895, and had a passing loop and a single siding with headshunt that served a goods shed and loading dock. Both lines through the station had platforms although the down platform had no buildings and was only accessible via a foot crossing at the down end of the station. The station building itself, like the goods shed, was substantially constructed out of local stone, as was the locking room of the signal box. The passing loop was extended in 1939, but the up loop, sidings and signal box were taken out of use on 21 November 1965 as goods services had ceased on 7 September the previous year. Traffic was never very heavy and by the late 1930s was averaging five passengers per day, less than a third of that ten years earlier. The station was unmanned from 6 December 1965 and closed on 3 October 1966, although the building functioned for some time as a guest house but is now a private residence: it is partially visible from the A39. ==Walmsley Sanctuary== The Cornwall Birdwatching and Preservation Society owns the Walmsley Sanctuary which covers over on the River Amble, a tributary of the River Camel, with two bird-hides for use by its members. The sanctuary is nationally important for wintering waders and wildfowl. The sanctuary was purchased in 1939 with a legacy from Dr Robert Garrett Walmsley (d. 1939). The legacy was on condition that the society undertook \\"to provide and administer a Sanctuary for Migrating Waders within the Duchy of Cornwall\\".Ryves, B. H. (1948) Bird Life in Cornwall.

(german) === World War II === Karabinerbau, 1937, Suhl MKb 42H (Haenel), front gas port MKb 42W (Walther) rifle In 1937 the Sauer 'Karabinerbau' is erected in Suhl. By 1938 about 1,450 employees are working for the company. With beginning of World War 2 Sauer & Sohn is manufacturing more military firearms again, after 1941 production serves the war effort almost exclusively. Next to Mauser the company 'Sauer & Sohn' is becoming one of the most important manufacturers of the German standard rifle, the Karabiner 98k. Among the better known is the M30 Luftwaffe drilling, a survival gun for air crews. Meanwhile, the 'Maschinenkarabiner 42' (MKb 42) is developed by C. G. Haenel in the Suhl, and a competing model by Walther. It will become the 'Maschinenpistole 43' (MP 43) and later the Sturmgewehr 44 This weapon is manufactured in numbers by Sauer and other companies. Production will continue after the war for newly formed armed forces, e.g. the Volkspolizei of East Germany (DDR or GDR).  Sauer Modell 38H Pistol Modell 38H, Smolensk War Museum. Of particular note is the company's Sauer 38H, the first mass-produced semi-automatic pistol to feature a cocking/de-cocking lever. It was a very advanced pocket pistol design made in .25 ACP, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP. It was adopted as German alternate standard as 'Modell 38' and was widely used by air and tank forces. Full length is 158.75mm, barrel length is 84 2/3mm, mass is 737.088g with a magazine capacity of eight. The action has a cocker/de-cocker lever that can control the concealed hammer. The handgun has a re-strike capability should the round in the chamber fail to fire on the first trigger pull. === After World War II === At the end of World War II, the original Sauer company is located in what will become East Germany (DDR). In April 1945 the U.S. Army arrives in Suhl, in early July the area is ceded to the Soviets. The company assets were seized without compensation end of October. This is confirmed by Communists in 1948, Rolf Sauer will move to West Germany. Hans Sauer is deported by the Soviet occupational government and never heard from again, he probably dies in 1946. The machinery, as happened with most of the industrial companies that had been located in East Germany, was mostly dismantled and moved East. Beginning 1946 to 1948, formerly independent companies in East Germany, or what was left of them, were restructured and finally merged into industrial conglomerates. (german) In Suhl the original J. P. Sauer und Sohn company (now renamed to VEB Fortuna), along with other former weapons manufacturers like Greifelt & Compagnie and Gebr√ºder Merkel, (german) were merged into a group called VVB MEWA Suhl (MEWA short for 'Metallwaren' - metalwares, metal products), at first producing small machinery (e.g. typewriters and sewing machines) for the civilian market.  Nationalisation in East Germany  The former company C. G. Haenel (which had been renamed to VEB Ernst-Th√§lmann-Werk Suhl) is starting production again in 1948, by 1954 the Fortuna (ex Sauer & Sohn) and 'Merkel' plant parts were attached to the 'Th√§lmann Works' as 'Produktionsbereiche' (PB, production areas). Now hunting weapons, later also small calibre and sporting firearms and airguns are being manufactured again. The firm Simson & Co. (renamed to VEB Fahrzeug und Ger√§tewerk Simson Suhl), first producing bicycles, then mopeds, motorbikes and also firearms, is included to the group. The weapons manufacturing is taken over by the 'Th√§lmann Works', until all companies mentioned are finally merged into the VEB Fahrzeug- und Jagdwaffenwerk \\"Ernst Th√§lmann\\" in 1968. The well- known trademarks were also still being used by East Germany, e.g. to sell products abroad, until 1970 with the companies being united, the use of the trade names 'Sauer und Sohn (Suhl)', 'Fortuna (Suhl)', 'C. G. Haenel (Suhl)', 'Gebr. Merkel (Suhl)', and 'Simson (Suhl)' (the latter only for weapons) were dropped. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and other Communist regimes in the Revolutions of 1989 the former East German companies like the Simson & Co. continued to manufacture products separately again, with changing ownerships, sometimes into the 2000s.  Sauer & Sohn in West Germany  In 1951, Rolf-Dietrich Sauer sold the rights of the name and trademark and formed a new enterprise with a partner in West Germany, first in D√ºsseldorf, and in 1952 the company was reestablished in Eckernf√∂rde, Schleswig-Holstein as J. P. Sauer & Sohn. Experienced workers from Suhl had joined, and the production of hunting firearms, and later pistols, was begun the same year. Export markets were a.o. Scandinavia and the US, Brasil and Pakistan. The company grew bigger soon, and employed over 400 people by the mid-1960s. In 1966 the Kompressorenfabrik Wilhelm Poppe in Kiel is taking over the 'J. P. Sauer & Sohn'. In 1968 'Wilhelm Poppe' merged with other companies into J. P. Sauer & Sohn Maschinenbau GmbH, mechanical engineering becoming a main branch of business. An independent company Sauer Getriebe KG is established in 1969 in Neum√ºnster. In 1972 Rolf-Dietrich Sauer died. In 1975 'Sauer Getriebe' took over plants in Aachen and Kiel from 'Sauer Maschinenbau',Our corporate history _ Sauer Compressors and in 1976 the 'J. P. Sauer & Sohn Maschinenbau' sold their hunting arms business in Eckernf√∂rde to the Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG), a company which had developed firearms from the 1860s onwards. === Sauer as Part of SIG === Swiss law of neutrality limits the ability of firearms manufacturers to export. Companies which wish to do so may be using a foreign partner. These restrictions prevented 'SIG' from exploiting a new design concept they had developed. The design resulted from the creation at that time of a new form of industrial production equipment, known as the \\"Automatic Screw Machine\\", which was introduced by the company. While 'SIG' had produced a very high quality handgun in their P210 model, it was also expensive to manufacture, required machining operations at high levels of precision. This produced a firearm that was known for its accuracy, but too expensive to be sold to a wider market. Spurred by the necessity to partner with a foreign company in order to profit from their production machinery and the items it could produce 'SIG' chose the German firm of 'J. P. Sauer & Sohn'. In joining they also combined their expertise in firearms design. As a result, the SIG Sauer GmbH (Eckernf√∂rde) as small arms business was founded, the SAN SIG Arms AG (Neuhausen) as manufacturer being kept (later renamed to Swiss Arms AG), and the SIG Sauer branch and brand name created. The declared goal was to expand market share and to be of international relevance in the small arms industry. In 1985 the company SIGARMS, Inc. was established (in Virginia), to import and distribute firearms into the US market (later renamed to SIG Sauer, Inc.). * 1971 ‚Äî 'SIG' purchased sporting arms manufacturer H√§mmerli based in Lenzburg, Switzerland. * 1975/76 ‚Äî 'SIG' forms partnership with hunting arms manufacturer 'J. P. Sauer & Sohn' (Eckernf√∂rde) to expand their arms division. * 1997 ‚Äî German Blaser Jagdwaffen (Isny) and 'SIGARMS' merge. Blaser, now part of 'SIG', continues autonomously developing and producing. * 1999 ‚Äî The Rheinmetall AG sells civilian market part of 'Mauser' to Blaser/'SIG', it becomes Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH. The part owned by 'Rheinmetall' is named 'Mauser-Werke Oberndorf Waffensysteme GmbH'.  The first SIG Sauer handgun  To satisfy the needs of Swiss military and police, a new handgun model was created by the SIG Sauer GmbH, which incorporated some features from the 'SIG P210' and 'Sauer Modell 38H', simplified for more efficient cost of construction on the new 'SIG' developed machinery. Result was a new type of action for a locked-breech semi-automatic pistol, with a new high quality smooth operating double/single-action trigger, a safe hammer lowering device, automatic firing pin block, and easy disassembly for cleaning. This new concept handgun was named SIG Sauer P220. Prior to World War II, Sauer had been primarily a maker of shotguns and hunting rifles. During the war they produced a new handgun, the Sauer 38H, but afterwards withdraw from this market. The 'Sauer 38H' had been produced in competition with other German makers, such as 'Mauser' and 'Walther', at a time when new designs began to feature a double/single-action trigger. With 'SIG' as their partner/owner, 'Sauer' returned to the business of manufacturing handguns. In 1975 the SIG Sauer line of handguns began with the SIG P220. The double-action trigger mechanism combined with advanced safety features, including the hammer lowering decocking lever, were contributed by 'Sauer' to the new P220 design.  Some Arms by SAN SIG Arms and SIG Sauer  * 1957 ‚Äî The SIG SG 510 Swiss battle rifle or Stgw 57, produced to 1983. With ventilated barrel jacket, and roller-delayed blowback, as used on Spanish CETME Model 58 and German H&K; G3 rifles. * 1950s-60s ‚Äî The SIG 710, general purpose machine gun design based on German MG 42, offered in different calibres. * 1977 ‚Äî The SIG P220 handgun for Swiss military and police, to replace the 'P210'.

On right side of the slide are the words \\"SIG Sauer System\\". The first 'SIG Sauer P220' type sold in US. * 1980 ‚Äî When 'BDA' sales ceased the 'P220' was sold in its own form, and spawned a huge line of models. * 1984 ‚Äî The SIG Sauer P226 lost in the US military 'XM9' handgun procurement program, due to being underbid by Beretta by $6. Beretta was awarded a contract for the M9 pistol with the '92FS'. * 1986 ‚Äî The SIG SG 550, created for Swiss Army as Stgw 90. Over 600,000 were delivered, military production has now ceased. * 1992 ‚Äî Production of the SIG Sauer P229 begins with 'SIG Sauer' and 'SIGARMS' both in Europe and America. * 1999 ‚Äî The SIG Pro pistol series by 'SIGARMS', also offered in Europe (adopted e.g. by French police).  Developments in the US  * 1985 ‚Äî SIGARMS imports SIG Sauer line of pistols, notably P220 and P230, in 1987 the P225, P226, P228. * 1990 ‚Äî SIGARMS moves to Exeter, New Hampshire, where production facilities had been established. * 1992 ‚Äî SIGARMS offersSIG P229, and program of Sauer rifles, H√§mmerli target pistols and rifles. * 1998 ‚Äî SIGARMS brings in the first shotguns designed for them by B.

Their railway tech division was sold in 1995 to Fiat Ferroviaria, automation solutions and arms branches in 2000. Packaging technology is SIG's main business activity today. In the late 1990s the Swiss arms industry as a whole faced a period of thorough restructuring. In the autumn of 2000 the firearms divisions of 'SIG', including their arms brand SIG Sauer, were sold to the L√ºke & Ortmeier Gruppe. For some time renown names like 'H√§mmerli', 'J. P. Sauer & Sohn', 'Blaser', 'Mauser' Jagdwaffen, and 'Kettner International GmbH' (hunting, shooting, outdoors accessoires) were consolidated under one roof by the 'L√ºke & Ortmeier' holding. The parts 'L√ºke & Ortmeier' took over in 2000 from 'SIG' included: * ‚Äî 'SAN SIG Arms' (Neuhausen), renamed Swiss Arms AG, and the SIG Sauer brand. * ‚Äî 'SIG Sauer' and Sauer & Sohn (Eckernf√∂rde), 'H√§mmerli' (Lenzburg), and 'SIGARMS, Inc.'. * ‚Äî 'Mauser Jagdwaffen' brand and 'Blaser Jagdwaffen', both remained in operation. * 2000 ‚Äî SIGARMS separated from 'SIG Sauer GmbH' in Germany, both produce pistols. * 2001 ‚Äî SIGARMS expanded with contracts in law enforcement market and new products for the civilian market. * 2007 ‚Äî Former 'SIGARMS, Inc.' renamed SIG Sauer, Inc., invests in manufacturing facilities and equipment. * 2006 ‚Äî 'H√§mmerli' becomes part of 'Carl Walther' (Ulm), also brand of Umarex (Arnsberg) (acquired 'Walther' in 1993). Rest of 'Kettner' trading company with rich tradition is sold. * 2000-08 ‚Äî Production of 'J. P. Sauer & Sohn', 'Mauser Jagdwaffen' is relocated to 'Blaser', Isny im Allg√§u. == J. P.

J. Sukselainen's Agrarian minority government, and two civil-service caretaker governments, led by the Governor of the Bank of Finland, Rainer von Fieandt and the Chief Justice of Finland's Supreme Administrative Court, Reino Kuuskoski. The Social Democrats and Agrarians found it difficult to work together in the government, which significantly reduced Finland's chances of having a stable government, because the two other large or fairly large parties, the Finnish People's Democratic League and National Coalition Party, were excluded from the government. The Social Democrats had been split into two parties since V√§in√∂ Tanner, a veteran Social Democrat and a former political prisoner (one of the eight \\"war culprits\\" after World War II), had very narrowly been elected the Social Democratic leader over Fagerholm in July 1957. The Social Democrats were among Kekkonen's chief opponents and wanted to defeat him in the 1962 presidential elections. After becoming President, Kekkonen wanted to defeat the Social Democrats politically, and thus their split into the majority and the minority, the so- called Skogists (after former Defence Minister Emil Skog) helped him move closer towards that goal. In addition, Finland was suffering from a recession and, by that time's standards, a high unemployment rate, which helped the Finnish People's Democratic League to increase their support. After these elections, Fagerholm formed his third government, which included the Social Democrats, Agrarians, National Coalitioners, Swedish People's Party and the People's Party of Finland, in August 1958. Already when he appointed Fagerholm's government, President Kekkonen indicated that he would not help if it encountered problems. Soon the government ran into difficulties: the Soviet Union interrupted its trade negotiations with Finland, and in November or December 1958, the Soviet ambassador to Finland returned to the Soviet Union. These \\"night frosts,\\" along with President Kekkonen's and the other Agrarians' opposition (Foreign Minister Virolainen resigned from the government at the beginning of December 1958, and former Assistant Finance Minister Karjalainen wrote that it was time for the wise people to leave the government), caused Fagerholm to tender his resignation in December 1958. Sukselainen formed another centrist minority government in January 1959, while Kekkonen visited the Soviet Union where the Soviet leader Khrushchev assured him that all was again well in the Finnish-Soviet relations.Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds.

It is the seventh and final track on the Machine Head album and its lyrics talk of space travel. Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore claims in Classic Albums: Deep Purple ‚Äì The Making of Machine Head that the song composition started with the half- step riffs in the refrain, which were inspired by the theme music for the Batman TV programme composed by Neal Hefti. Blackmore asked singer Ian Gillan if he could write any lyrics over the riff, and the rest of the song evolved from there. ==Live performances== When it was first performed live, the band appended an instrumental that was originally part of the song \\"Mandrake Root\\" from their first album but gradually evolved into a showcase for Jon Lord's Hammond organ and Ritchie Blackmore's guitar solos. This usually took the length of the overall song to over twenty minutes, and it was always performed as the last number of the main set. A good example of this arrangement can be found on the Made in Japan album, wherein Blackmore also quotes the \\"cello\\" solo of \\"Fools\\" off Fireball. Jon Lord played his solo through a ring modulator or played some of it on an ARP synthesizer. Meanwhile, Ritchie Blackmore usually split the guitar solo into two halves, a quiet section with just drums, then a loud section with the full band. The second half was often when Blackmore would smash his guitar, play it with his feet or throw it into the air. One of the most infamous incidents where that happened was at the California Jam festival in 1974, where he dropped one guitar over the edge of the stage, smashed a second against a TV camera, then set his amplifier on fire, which then subsequently exploded. When Deep Purple reformed in 1984, this extended arrangement was reworked, and later included snippets of other songs. During the Man Of All Ages tour, the final part of the song, which originally featured high-pitched screaming by Gillan (now 71), instead featured high-pitched guitar in the same key as his original vocals. On the remastered version of their 1982 album Live in London (recorded in 1974), there is a 31-minute-long live version of the song. It consists of a lot of improvising from the band members and in one part of the song they play the main riff from \\"Child in Time\\". ==In pop culture== *The intro was featured on the TV show WKRP in Cincinnati on the episode \\"The Airplane Show\\". (Later syndicated reruns of the episode replaced this track with generic music.) *The song is featured as a downloadable track for the Rock Band series of music video games as of 30 December 2008. *The song appeared in the film Lords of Dogtown, the documentary Warren Miller's Dynasty and video game Guitar Hero: Van Halen. *The 1997 remix of the song was featured in the first and last episodes of Ash vs Evil Dead.https://www.tunefind.com/show/ash-vs-evil-dead *\\"Space Truckin'\\" played in orbit as a wake-up call for the Red Team on Flight Day 3 of the crew of STS-107; it was specially played for Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla, who was later one of the seven crewmembers killed in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. She was a fan of the band and traded e-mails with several group members while in space. Guitarist Steve Morse, vocalist Ian Gillan, bass guitarist Roger Glover, drummer Ian Paice and keyboardist Don Airey were in the midst of recording \\"Bananas\\" when the disaster occurred. Chawla had taken three CDs onboard Columbia: Deep Purple's landmark 1972 album Machine Head, 1996's Purpendicular and Rainbow's 1978 album Down to Earth (Glover and Airey were both members of Rainbow at the time).

Supporting the girls is their employer Jerry from the World Organization of Human Protection (WOOHP). The show has spawned a variety of characters including students from their high school and university, fellow WOOHP agents, and a cast of villains, many of whom have returned in later episodes. ==Conception and development== The show's conception came from the rise of girl band and female singers in the music industry. Wanting to capitalize on the niche, David Michel and Vincent Chalvon-Demersay put their idea into development, which later shifted into production within a year. According to Michel, the series' animation style was intended to incorporate anime influences. The production company, Marathon Media, intended on building on the series brand by forming a three-piece girl band, utilizing German talk show Arabella to create it. Using a panel of judges, 20 demo videos were selected and the winners were selected based on the strength of their performance and the show's viewers. The band was selected and released a single in the spring of 2002, through EMI. According to managing director Dirk Fabarius, \\"The plan is to eventually create an entire album and establish and promote Totally Spies as a real band.\\" In an interview with WorldScreen.com, Michel said that prior to his show, there were a lot of boy action-adventure shows and practically nothing for girls, yet in pop culture, there was Britney Spears and Spice Girls. He said that the characters are heavily inspired by the movie Clueless and wanted to mix that with a James Bond format. When they first pitched the show, it had a moderate response, but when the first season was broadcast, the Charlie's Angels film came out, and suddenly the market was full of girl show properties. The character design was originally done by Gil Formosa. ==Main charactersSam=== has long slightly wavy red hair, emerald green eyes and fair skin; she dons a green catsuit on missions. She is described by her T√©l√©toon and film profiles as rational, logical and mature, like a big sister, although she is known to easily become gullible at times, especially when it comes to romance. She thinks up plans and diversions so that the girls can defeat the villains. Although she is fairly serious during her missions, she enjoys hanging out, shopping, and visiting salons. She is not as boy crazy as the other girls, she has fallen for a few in the series, but without much success. One of the running gags is that she is frequently brainwashed. Her last name is not mentioned in her profiles, however, in \\"Do You Believe in Magic?\\", where she is undercover as a reporter, she introduces herself as Samantha Simpson. She is voiced by Jennifer Hale in the English version and by Claire Guyot in the French version. In an interview regarding Sam's development in the first three seasons, Hale described Sam as \\"smart and adventurous, but now you see more of her wacky side and her girly side as well.\\" ===Clover=== Clover has short blonde hair, light blue eyes, and medium-toned skin; she dons a red catsuit on missions. Of the three girls, she is the most expressive with the Beverly Hills teenage fashionista attitude, with a strong valspeak dialect, being the first to court the newest available good-looking boy, concerning herself with the latest clothes, diets, and trends, and often competing against Mandy in all sorts of popularity contests. Her T√©l√©toon profile describes her as athletic, agile, strong, and especially impulsive, reacting spontaneously and jumping into action; and ready to teach the bad guys a lesson even if she has no chance of winning. Clover is voiced by Andrea Baker (who was credited as Andrea Taylor for the first two seasons) in the English dub, and by Fily Keita in the French version. In an interview, Baker said Clover has a thing for musicians, likes to get pampered, and is all into fashion. She likes that the girls have fun and kick butt. ===Alex=== Alexandra has short black hair, light brown eyes, and dark skin; she dons a yellow catsuit on missions.According to her movie profile, Alex chose the yellow color for her spy uniform because it symbolizes strength. She is described in the T√©l√©toon profile as the best friend character, affectionate and not afraid to show her feelings. She enjoys sports and athletics but also shares her friends' fashion interests. She is the most naive and absent-minded of the three, sometimes interpreting figures of speech literally, often thinking it was literally going dark just because something is blocking her sight, or picking up and eating foodstuff at crime scenes that is potentially harmful. In the episode \\"Do You Believe In Magic\\", it is revealed Alex is the youngest of the three girls (and Clover the oldest). Her driving ability becomes a running gag in some episodes, despite the fact that she keeps getting to take the wheel and proves to be capable of improvising dangerous car stunts. She is sensitive and sometimes gets down on herself. Starting with season 3, Alex reveals interests in Taekwondo, skateboarding, soccer and video games. Alex appears to be racially mixed at first, having a dark-skinned mother and a white father in the season 4 episode \\"Alex Gets Schooled\\"; however, her father later appears with a completely different physical appearance, notably with dark skin in the season 6 episode \\"Evil Ice Skater\\". In Totally Spies! The Movie, which takes place when the girls first transfer to Beverly Hills High, she adopts a baby pig whom she names (), who does not appear in seasons 1-5 but recurs in season 6 when the girls have already gone to college. Although Alex says she is allergic to cats in season 1 episode \\"Wild Style\\", she later works in a university cat lab in season 6 episode \\"Nine Lives\\" without problems. Alex is voiced by Katie Leigh for the first two seasons and by Katie Griffin in the following seasons for the English dub. In voicing Alex, Griffin used a higher vocal register than usual. She was worried about nodules developing and about being recast when the series returned for season 6 following a hiatus, but was happy when she could return. She found the part to be really fun, easy to play, and liked that Alex was so lovely to animals. Alex is voiced by C√©line Mauge in the French dub. ==Recurring charactersJerry === The founder and chief administrator of World Organization Of Human Protection (WOOHP, pronounced like \\"whoop\\"), as the girls' supervisor. Jerry is a middle-aged British gentleman who briefs the girls on their missions and provides their various gadgets, most of which are in the form of women's accessories such as boots, hairpins, lipsticks, eyelash curlers, hair dryers, and are very mission-specific as if he knew everything beforehand. Some of the accessories are named with convoluted acronyms (such as RASH (\\"Rocket-powered Amphibious Stealth Hydrofoil\\"), AWFUL Boots (\\"All-Weather Fleece Ultra-Light Boots\\"), or CATS (\\"Crystalline Airtight Trisect Shield\\")). He usually summons the girls (or \\"WOOHPs\\" them) using trap doors or portals from random items and places (e.g. closet door, trash can, vacuum cleaner), sends them off in similarly over-the-top manners (in roller coasters or even rockets), most of which are practically impossible, or as noted by Sam, \\"sometimes defy the laws of physics\\". He also tends to make a lot of bad puns, which the girls sometimes find annoying. During the missions, he looks up information for the girls and analyzes items they send over. His movie profile notes that he cares a lot for the girls and acts like a second father to them. In the episode \\"Totally Switched\\", Jerry's last name is revealed to be Lewis. Jerry was voiced by Jess Harnell for first two seasons and then by Adrian Truss for seasons 3‚Äì6 in the English dub. In the French version, Jerry has been voiced by Jean-Claude Donda. Jerry also appears in the spin-off series The Amazing Spiez!. ===Mandy=== Mandy is the girls' primary antagonist for their non-spy adventures starting at Beverly Hills High. She has long black hair and violet eyes, with a beauty mark under her left eye. The film website profiles her as the popular girl, charismatic, cute, very rich, and hyper- fashionable. However, she is \\"the spies' worst nightmare ‚Äì a pest that does everything to ridicule\\". She has a high, squeaky voice with a nasal laugh. Her rivalry with Clover is most pronounced, as they often compete over boys, popularity, and bragging rights. Mandy will go out of her way to annoy the girls and will even use dishonest means in order to do it. In the first four seasons, she is accompanied by her crony friends Dominique and Caitlin. In season 3, when the spies move into their villa, Mandy ends up becoming their next-door neighbor. In season 5, she ends up attending college at Malibu University, where she shares a room with her cousin Mindy in the same dorm as the spy girls. In season 6, she employs an intern named Trent. Despite frequently interacting with Clover and the girls, she is not aware that they are spies. In turn, the girls put up with Mandy's shenanigans and try to protect or rescue her when she is in serious danger from the real villains. Usually when she does discover they are spies, she gets her memory erased following the situation. Jerry makes her a WOOHP spy for the episode \\"Evil Coffee Shop Much?\\", and dons a purple uniform. Some episodes have her in a villain role, such as: \\"Futureshock!\\" where she is the top media celebrity in an alternative future and tries to \\"Mandify\\" everyone and \\"Attack of the 50 Ft. Mandy\\" where she transforms into a giant and captures the other girls. In the multi-episode season finale \\"Totally Busted\\", she, Caitlin and Dominique are infected by a chemical called SUDS and become spy hunters or \\"spy-'ssassins\\". In the English dub, Mandy has been voiced by Jennifer Hale, who also voiced Sam. In an interview where she was asked about her impressions of Sam and Mandy, Hale said that she enjoyed voicing such opposite characters: \\"I love spy/action stuff and it always rocks when I get to be one of those characters. Plus I get to be a total snot, which is fun too.\\" In the French dub, Mandy is voiced by C√©line Mauge, who also voiced Alex. ===G.L.A.D.I.S.=== Gadget Lending And Distribution Interactive System (G.L.A.D.I.S.) is Jerry's new personal assistant that is introduced as a main character in season 3 and 4. Michel describes her as a \\"robot with a SERIOUS attitude\\". She takes the form of an assembly line with a bunch of robotic arms that can outfit the girls with the gadgets. Although Jerry created her, she often expresses her own attitude, picking out gadgets on her own and disobeying Jerry's orders. Following her disapproval by the show's fans, G.L.A.D.I.S. was written off the show, where it is mentioned in a season 5 episode that she is sent to a recycling facility. G.L.A.D.I.S. is voiced by Stevie Vallance. ===Arnold Jackson=== is a classmate who regularly shows up in the side stories at Beverly Hills High; he is portrayed as a nerd with glasses who has helped out the girls on the condition that they go on a date with him. In the series opener, he successfully campaigns for Clover to win a popularity contest, and gets to date her for a day, and in \\"A Spy Is Born\\" double-episode, he asks Sam out as a secret admirer with the initials \\"A.J.\\" Despite being turned down \\"a few, uh, hundred times\\" by Clover, he is still attracted to her, and works on her publicity campaign in \\"Super Agent Much?\\"; he is also a member of Mandy's fan club. He participates in school events including the Halloween costume contest, Most Charitable Teen contest, local raves, student president elections, and the head cheerleader contest, the last of which he beats Mandy and Clover. Arnold serves as the episodic villain In \\"Super Nerd Much?\\", where he acquires a magic ring that allows him to steal the \\"coolness\\" from other people. In the episode \\"Arnold the Great\\", he is inspired to dress as comic book superhero Admiral Admirable, but it is manipulated by villain Geraldine Husk into thinking the girls are his enemies. His final appearance was in the season 5 opener, \\"Evil Graduation\\" where, as class valedictorian, he tells the class off with a \\"Goodbye and good riddance!\\" ===Blaine=== Blaine is a Mali-U student introduced in the season 5 episode \\"The Granny\\" as the captain of the beach volleyball team. He is a freelance assassin whose mission to get Clover to fall in love with him, and then to kill her off. After realizing that Clover is working for the good side, he goes after his boss, revealed to be Geraldine Husk. He later joins WOOHP's Australian branch along with Britney. He appears in the season 5 finale \\"Totally Dunzo where he is captured by Mr. X, but when he reunites with Clover, they almost kiss. In the season 6 episode \\"Baddies on a Blimp\\", he stows away on the WOOHP blimp to help out the spies when things go awry and the prisoners are released. However, he turns down Clover's affections, saying that he is done with dating LA girls after having dated the \\"high-maintenance\\" Mandy. Blaine makes a guest appearance in an episode of The Amazing Spiez! where he is abducted by the spiez' nanny. ===Britney=== Britney is introduced in the season 2 episode \\"Alex Quits\\" as a new teenage WOOHP spy. She has long, dark bluish/black hair, violet eyes, a yellow complexion, and her uniform is blue. She quickly befriends Clover when she says that she is the captain of her high school's cheerleading squad, and Sam when she says she loves playing chess; however, her introduction to WOOHP and her immediate competence and leadership as an agent makes Alex jealous. Following the completion of the mission, Jerry announces that she has completed her training, and deploys her to another branch. She reappears in the season 3 episode \\"Escape from WOOHP Island\\" where she is forced on land on a prisoner's island, but is rescued by the girls as they team up again to re- capture the villains. She reveals that she has two agent co-workers, both of whom are good-looking guys. Following Britney's appearance on \\"WOOHP Island\\", producer David Michel noted she would reappear in some special episodes. In the season 5 episode \\"Virtual Stranger\\" she gets stuck in a virtual simulation as the result of an accident, causing a cyber demon using her as a host to manifest as three incarcerated villains in the real world. After being freed by the spy girls, she transfers to Mali-U for three more episodes, causing Alex to become jealous of her again. In the episode \\"Whoopersize-me\\", The girls and Britney discover that a new exercise trend has been going around campus, and it involves moves taught at WOOHP. Jerry has them track down who's responsible. \\"Evil Hotel\\", Britney and Alex become friends again, having common interests such as their favorite movie actor who they are assigned to protect. Britney is assigned to WOOHP Australia and partnered with Blaine, much to Clover's disdain. She returns in the multi-episode finale \\"Totally Dunzo\\" as one of the spies captured by Mr. X. Britney makes a guest appearance in an episode of The Amazing Spiez where she is abducted by the spiez' nanny. ===Carmen=== Carmen is Alex's mother. She has a darker skin/eye tone and originally her hair was dark brown but has since appeared the same color as Alex's. Her main goal and focus is for Alex to get a boyfriend. Carmen made an appearance in the Season 2 episode \\"Mommies Dearest\\", the Season 4 episode \\"Alex Gets Schooled\\", and her final appearance in the Season 4 finale \\"Totally Busted\\".

He is introduced in the season 2 episode \\"It's How You Play The Game\\". He has many varied interests such as painting and poetry, but also dabbles in extreme sports such as rock climbing and street luge. He is oblivious to the girls' attempts to garner his attention and thinks of them as just friends, or like a sister. In his interviews when producer David Michel was asked if he could share some inside jokes that were put into episodes, he said: \\"In season II, guess what's the name of the totally hunky, totally clever boy that the 3 girls fall in love with at the same time? David.\\" When asked about why David did not return in the third season, Michel said, \\"David never was a recurring character. He was present in a few season II episodes so we didn't have to justify his not being in our stories anymore. But we have realized how important he is to the fans, and decided to have him back in season 4.\\" ===Dean=== Dean is a WOOHP agent who first appears in the season 3 multi-episode finale \\"Evil Promotion Much?\\" where he and the girls undergo special training to become super spies. He wears a blue uniform. Ever since he was a baby he has demonstrated exceptional agility and was recruited to join WOOHP. Following the first day of the super spy training, he is captured by Terence and used as ransom in order for the girls to eliminate Jerry and steal his microchip. He briefly sides with Terence when the girls return but then reveals he has been siding with WOOHP all along, and that he is the actual training instructor. He then helps the girls rescue Jerry and defeat Terence. He was later shown in \\"Deja Cruise\\" where he pretends to be a lifeguard who turns down Clover's advances. He returns in \\"WOOHP-tastic!\\" where he is put in charge of the WOOHP gadget lab. In the season 5 finale, he is one of the agents who was abducted by Mr. X. He also appears in the spin-off series The Amazing Spiez!. ===Dominique and Caitlin === Mandy's two crony friends who accompany her at school and other events. Both have snobby attitudes and high nasal voice inflections like their leader. They were not given names in the first two seasons.

Dominique has dark red hair styled in way similar to Alex's hair, blue eyes, and peach skin. Caitlin has long and curly black hair and dark skin. Caitlin was voiced by Katie Griffin and Dominique was voiced by Andrea Baker. They only appeared scarcely in episodes of the first four seasons, and the movie, when the story was set at Beverly Hills High; when the story was shifted to set at Mali-U starting from season 5, they were written off entirely. Their most notable appearance was in the \\"Totally Busted\\" arc of season 4, in which they were brainwashed along with Mandy and actively attacked the Spies. In portraying the girls, Baker said that she and Griffin both tried to do their own versions of Mandy. ===Gabby=== Gabby is Sam's mother. She wears her hair long like Sam's, though slightly curlier.

However, in \\"Ski Trip\\", he escapes and follows the girls to a ski resort where he tries to kill them off in a series of accidents. When he kidnaps Clover, he mistakenly grabs Mandy instead because she wears a red snow outfit that resembles Clover's spy suit. Regardless, he uses Mandy as a hostage to capture the girls. He is last seen at the side of the mountain where he tries to fire a laser at the girls, only to have it bounce off and cause an avalanche that buries him. ===Geraldine Husk=== Geraldine Husk first appears as the head of a spy agency called Super Protection International (S.P.I.), which during its introduction, becomes extremely successful in capturing criminals, and practically puts WOOHP out of business.

The exact number for the Qarapapaq population worldwide is unknown but is likely to be in the hundred thousands. ==Origins and history== Sometimes referred to as Terekeme or Tarakama (from Arabic: \\"ÿ™ÿ±ÿßŸÉŸÖÿ©\\" (TarƒÅkameh), the Arabic broken plural for Turkmen‚Äîa term traditionally used for any Turkic nomadic people, Qarapapaqs are often identified as a sub-ethnic group of Azerbaijanis, Azeris.

Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary Theories of Qarapapaqs descending from Kumyks (a Turkic ethnic group in Dagestan) have also been brought forward by scholars like Fahrettin Kƒ±rzƒ±oƒülu and Zeki Velidi Togan.

Here they were given the name Karapapakh (\\"black hat\\") by the Anatolians reflecting the element of the Terekeme ethnic outfit that distinguished them from the local population. Russia's expansion to Kars (in Eastern Turkey) in 1878 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War led to some Qarapapaq settlements becoming part of Russia once again. With the Russian Revolution and Soviet expansion south in late 1910s and 1920s, Qarapapaqs became a new nationality group in Soviet Union. Late in 1930s, the Soviet Union stopped classifying Qarapapaqs as a separate people and in 1944, they were included in the mass deportation of Meskhetian Turks from Georgia to Central Asia.Ronald Wixman.(1984).The Peoples of the USSR: An Ethnographic Handbook. Even though the Qarapapaqs left in the Caucasus had largely assumed Azeri identity by the mid-20th century and despite lack of record of Qarapapaqs in modern censuses of the South Caucasus states, nowadays small groups may still identify themselves as Qarapapaq or Terekeme in the regions originally inhabited by them. Qarapapaqs are also found in Central Asia where many of them were deported along with the Meskhetian Turks in 1944 during the Stalinist population transfers. The last census to mention Qarapapaqs as a separate ethnic group was the 1926 Soviet census, according to which there were 6,311 of them throughout the South Caucasus.

As with its male counterpart The Boy's Own Paper, the magazine was published by the Religious Tract Society (which subsequently became Lutterworth Press). In October 1929, the title became The Girl's Own Paper and Woman's Magazine but in 1930 the Woman's Magazine became a separate publication. In December 1947 the name was changed to The Girl's Own Paper and Heiress. By 1951 it was called Heiress incorporating the Girl's Own Paper. In 1956 Heiress closed down, and the name \\"Girl's Own Paper\\" ceased to exist. Facsimile reprints of volume 1 to 4 were published by Eureka Press, Japan, in 2006. Several editions are available online from Project Gutenberg. == Contents == The story paper provided a mix of stories and educational and improving articles, with 'Answers to Correspondents' and occasional coloured plates, poetry and music. The paper funded and serialised the exploits of the explorer Kate Marsden in the 1890s when she was lauded by the Royal Geographical Society. From 1908, the weekly magazines were dropped and the paper included more information on serious careers for girls and advice on style and dress. Long serials became less common, being replaced by shorter stories. From the 1930s, a greater proportion of its material was directed at younger readers. There were school stories, stories of kidnapped princesses and articles about film stars, although the contents became more serious during World War II. Volumes 39 and 40 of 1917‚Äì18 were entitled The Girls Own Paper and Woman's Magazine; presumably the two publications were merged for economy purposes as a result of World War I. == Famous contributors == Many contributors are unknown outside the G.O.P. pages, but they include Noel Streatfeild, Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd, Rosa Nouchette Carey, Sarah Doudney (1841‚Äì1926), Angela Brazil, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Richmal Crompton, Fanny Fern, and Baroness Orczy.

Located in the northern part of the Strait of Georgia, it is northwest of Vancouver. It is approximately 0.8-1.5 km wide and long. It has a permanent population of about 100, expanding to perhaps 2,000 or more in the summer months. Savary Island lies within the traditional territory of the Tla'amin Nation. ==History== Lund Water Taxi. ===First Nations Settlement=== Sometime after the end of the glaciers, First Nations peoples arrived in the region. Archaeological evidence documents the occupation by Coast Salish peoples in this area of the Strait of Georgia for over 4,000 years. The island is within the territory of the Tla'amin (Sliammon) First Nation. In the language îay îajuŒ∏…ôm spoken by the Tla'amin peoples, the whole island is known by two names: Ihohs (previously spelled √Åyhus), meaning 'double-headed serpent' and Kayaykwon which is an allusion in  îay îajuŒ∏…ôm to the three main water sources found in the island. The western tip of the Island -- named Indian Point by colonial settlers -- is called Thetik in  îay îajuŒ∏…ôm, meaning 'broken off'.Riley, Syd, Steve Acheson, Bjorn Simonsen, and L Webster (1976) DlSf-10, Detailed Site Report. Archaeology Branch. Victoria, BC. The area known by locals as The Meadow is called T‚Äôit‚Äômay in  îay îajuŒ∏…ôm, meaning 'wild cherry trees'. The area of the spring at Beacon Point is called Xixajayis in the îay îajuŒ∏…ôm language. Over 13 archaeological sites, protected by the BC Heritage Conservation Act, have been registered on the Island, including a large habitation and use site on the eastern edge, a signal site atop the high south-southwesterly crest of the island, and numerous ancestral remains. These fragile archaeological sites reflect life in the pre-contact era. ===European exploration (18th century)=== It is possible that European ships were in the vicinity of the island in the mid-18th century. Tla'amin (Sliammon) First Nation oral history records the destruction and sinking of a ‚Äútrading‚Äù ship (well known for pirating) in their traditional territory in that period. In 1791 Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez commanded a small schooner, the Santa Saturnina, on an expedition to chart the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Strait of Georgia. He reached Jervis Inlet and was able to determine that Texada Island was in fact an island. In the distance to the north he saw a couple points of higher land, one probably Cape Mudge on Quadra Island, and another to the east, of unclear identity. In June 1792 the Spanish ships Sutil and Mexicana, under Galiano, and the British ships Discovery and Chatham, under Vancouver sailed by the island on their way to Desolation Sound. On or about June 25, 1792, Vancouver gave the name \\"Savary's Island\\". In early July a boat survey team led by Peter Puget and Joseph Whidbey charted Savary Island and spent at least one night on shore, meeting a group of Indigenous people at island's eastern end. Puget did not refer to the island as Savary, instead simply calling it \\"Indian Island\\". ===European settlement (Late 19th century)=== Permanent European settlement on the island did not begin until well into the 19th century. In the 1870s the government subdivided the island into lots for homesteading despite Indigenous establishments on the island. Jack Green, the first non-Indigenous permanent resident, was an early settler who built a cabin and store in or about 1886. Green Point (now known as Mace Point) was named for him. In or about 1893 Green and his friend and business partner, Taylor, were murdered on Savary, during a store robbery. Strangely, the events of the robbery and murder mirror the robbery by the Flying Dutchman in Union Bay. Green's murderer, Hugh Lynn of the Lynn Valley clan, was eventually captured in a multi-thousand mile, multinational chase and sent to the gallows. ===Development (Early 20th century)=== By the turn of the 20th century, CPR coastal ships and Union Steamships called in, popularizing the place. Savary has always been a popular island for clamming and swimming owing to the sandy beaches. A government wharf was built near Green Point, close to Dinner Rock and Lund. In 1910 Savary Island was subdivided into over 1400 lots. Savary became a favourite summer cabin location. Further subdivision resulted in a total of over 1700 (mostly 50 foot) lots on Savary. Roads were built and cabins established. The first hotel seems to have been \\"The Savary\\", built in 1914, near the Government Wharf. This hotel remained in operation until 1932 when it was destroyed in a fire. At the other end of the island, the Ashworth family built the Royal Savary Hotel at Indian Point. Gradually, private boats and water taxis from Lund provided the most common access to the island. The steamship services ended in the 1940s (Union Steamships) and 1950s (Gulf Steamship Line). For a brief time an airstrip was operating on the island, but it was later closed due to safety concerns (two children were killed while riding on ATVs). The main air access to Savary has been by seaplane and boats that come from Lund, a nearby town. In the summers, many island commuters from away come and go on seaplanes, especially on Friday and Sunday evening flights. ===Shipwrecks=== Over the years there have been several shipwrecks (including the Union Steamship Steamer Capilano in 1915) and aircraft crashes (including a small single engine crash in Seaweed Bay in the 1960s). The incidents include: an RCAF Hurricane fighter that crashed off Savary in 1943; lone survivor (12-year-old Fred Ilott) of the PowRivCo Tug Teeshoe sinking who washed up on Savary in the 1950s (Teeshoe: A Powell River Story by Filmmaker Jan Padgett); a Cessna on the airstrip; two fishboats, one in the Gulf and one in Malaspina Strait, each with loss of life; and a Gulf ship that sank on Dinner Rock in 1947. There have also been swimming and pleasure boating incidents over the years. In the 1960s human remains were found on Savary and these were transferred to the Laboratory of Archaeology at UBC. These ancestral remains were returned by UBC to the Tla'amin (Sliammon) First Nation in a repatriation ceremony for burial at Sliammon in June 2006. In 1982 the Royal Savary Hotel was demolished and, for many, this was the end of an era. Since then several B&Bs; have opened on the island. ==Geology and soils== Southern Savary Island, seen from a floatplane This island is composed mostly of unconsolidated material such as glacial till, marine clay, and sand. This comes primarily from the Pleistocene era as material deposited by meltwater streams from glaciers which advanced southward through the Strait of Georgia over 20,000 years ago. The Ice Age materials are overlain by Holocene (Recent) era deposits; their features include sand dunes. Bedrock is exposed only at the eastern end around Mace Point. Most of Savary's soils are sandy, with brown podzolic and podzol profile development. Since deglaciation (approximately 10,000 years ago), continued erosion under the general influence of prevailing south easterly storm waves, has caused the disappearance of much of the \\"original island\\". What remains today is very much in flux as the twin forces of erosion and accretion gradually move or shift the boundaries of the island. As one study described it, \\"With no exterior sources of sediment, the Island will continue to cannibalize its south coast.\\" ==Climate== In the rainshadow of Vancouver Island, Savary receives between 950 and 1,300 mm of precipitation annually, with maximum amounts in late fall through mid-winter. No permanent streams exist on the island, but at least one spring may be found mid-island called Indian Springs. The dry warm summers and erodible soils condition distinctive ecologic settings and surface processes (including wind erosion and deposition). In addition, storm waves, which are predominantly from the southeast, have important erosion and sediment transport effects along the south shore of Savary. It is this unique combination of \\"ecologic settings\\", \\"surface processes\\" and \\"transport effects\\" which gives rise to the wonderful beaches of Savary. ==EcologyFlora=== Common trees are Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western red cedar, lodgepole pine, grand fir, red alder, bigleaf maple and arbutus. It is claimed that one of the largest arbutus trees in the world is on the island. A few western white pine are present. A tiny population of Garry oak occurs at the eastern end -- the northernmost natural occurrence of this species along the coast. It has splendid beaches, arbutus groves, meadows, and sand cliffs. Salal is the most plentiful shrub in the forest understorey. Red huckleberry, evergreen huckleberry and red flowering currant are among the other shrubs present. Many of the open areas have been conquered by alien species such as Scotch broom, gorse and Himalayan blackberry. ===Fauna=== The animal population includes birds (bald eagles, barred owls, kingfishers, cliff and northern rough-winged swallows, seagulls, sandpipers, and herons), mammals (black-tailed deer, mink, harbour seals, sea lions, otters, bats), reptiles (garter snakes and possibly northern alligator lizard), and numerous invertebrates. Surprisingly, the raccoon is absent; its failure to become established on the island has allowed ground-nesting birds to maintain their populations. Mink is the only native predatory mammal on land and has many mice to prey on. ==Governance== Prior to colonization, Savary was governed by the Tla'amin Nation under Tla'amin law. For many decades after colonization, there was no government to speak of on Savary. Although the island fell under the jurisdiction of one entity or another, island politics and political activity remained in the background. Eventually, Savary Island became part of the Powell River Regional District, now qathet Regional District. In the late 1990s, the Regional District set down the long path to establish an official community plan for the island. Draft OCPs were prepared in 2001, 2002, and 2006. On February 22, 2007, the Savary Island Official Community Plan, Bylaw No. 403, 2006 was adopted by the Powell River Regional District. The principal aim of the OCP is to maintain Savary Island's unique character and rustic island lifestyle while protecting the island's ground water resources, its sensitive ecosystems, and its unique biophysical characteristics. ==Culture== Savary Island has inspired a great deal of creativity; artists whose work features Savary include Stephanie Aitken, Helen Griffin, Charles Hepburn Scott, Anne-Marie Harvey, David Burns, Sheldon Heppner, Toni Onley, E. J. Hughes, Keith Pepper and Michael Kluckner. From the early 1900s Savary Island was visited regularly by visual artists working in various media. In the 1930s it became the site of summer sketch camps of the Vancouver School of Art, which were often based at the Royal Savary Hotel. An artefact of these camps is a mimeographed newsletter produced by the students, The Savary Pudding. The natural surroundings of Savary inspired poet Alice Brewer to verse found in her 1926 chapbook entitled Spring in Savary. Alt URL ==Further reading== Bloomfield, Gladys (2005).

Cocchi was probably born in Naples in about 1712, although his place of birth has also been given as Padova. His first works were performed in Naples and in Rome; the most successful was La maestra, written in Naples in 1747. It was performed at the Teatro Nuovo sopra Toledo of that city in the spring of 1747, and at the Teatro Formagliari of Bologna in October of the same year; on 11 March 1749 it was given at the King's Theatre, and in 1752 at the Teatro de' Fiorentini of Naples, with the title La scaltra governante. As La scaltra governatrice it was given at the Acad√©mie de Musique in Paris on 25 January 1753, and as Die Schulmeisterin was performed in 1954 at the Schlosstheater in Berlin. The work established a solid international reputation for Cocchi. From 1749 to 1757 Cocchi was in Venice, where he became maestro di cappella of the Ospedale degli Incurabili, standing in for Vincenzo Legrenzio Ciampi, who had been given permission to visit London for an extended period. Cocchi also taught composition to Andrea Luchesi (1756/57). In 1757 he travelled to London, where he stayed until about 1772, when he returned to Venice.

In 1998 the commune had a total population of 10,688. ==Situation== A street in Stidia. Stidia is located from Mostaganem, the wilaya (province) capital, and from Oran, the country's second largest city. A four-lane highway links both cities, via Stidia. The city is located on the Greenwich meridian. ==Name== The name of Stidia derives from an old fountain named A√Øn Stidia. The town was first named La Stidia, before being renamed Georges Cl√©menceau by the French, after World War I. According to Salim Ammar who was born in the territory of Stidia, this town was named in the 15th century by the Moors Istija (ÿ•ÿ≥ÿ™ÿ¨ÿ©) in honor of their lost city in Andalucia, the current √âcija. The German settlers later in the 19th century mispronounced the Arabic name and it became Stidia or Stidya. ==History== A beach in Stidia Before the foundation of the European settlement down the hill, the Moors who were expelled from Spain after 1492, founded the original Stidia on the hill and it is called now \\"Douar\\" Stidia to differentiate it from \\" Village\\" Stidia which is the part built during the French occupation. The moorish influence is obvious in the territory of Stidia and Fornaka. The ethnic groups living in the territory keep the remembrance of the epic History of the fighting against the Spanish crusades. Although the fountain A√Øn Stidia existed for some time, the town was founded in 1846, by German settlers who tried to emigrate to South America, but were directed to Algeria, after being abandoned in Dunkerque, France by a dishonest conveyor. The settlement was first helped by French soldiers who left in 1948. Although Algeria was a French colony at the time, the inhabitants continued to speak German until about the first World War. At the independence of Algeria (1962), the town was renamed Stidia (from Georges Cl√©menceau). ==Demographics== Greenwich meridian in Stidia * 1866 : 486 * 1958 : 1.301 * 2002 : 11.500 ==AttractionsBeaches=== The beaches in the Stidia region attract many tourists (mainly Algerians from Mostaganem and surroundings) during the summer. Although not the best ones of the western Algerian coast, they still offer good recreation opportunities. There is often a guarded parking (for a small fee) in front of the beach. The nearest accommodation is in Mostaganem (15 km), or, to a greater extent, in Oran (65 km). There are no hotels in Stidia. ===Greenwich meridian=== A plate indicates the crossing of the Greenwich meridian, on the Mostaganem-Oran highway. ==References== Category:Communes of Mostaganem Province ","title":"Stidia"},{"id":"6225842","text":"Melopsittacus undulatus at Chai-Negev, Revivim, Israel. The science of budgerigar color genetics deals with the heredity of mutations which cause color variation in the feathers of the species known scientifically as Melopsittacus undulatus. Birds of this species are commonly known by the terms 'budgerigar', or informally just 'budgie'. ==Background== The wildtype (natural-coloured or wild occurring) budgerigar's color is called Lightgreen. The feathers of most parrot species, including budgerigars, contain both a black type of melanin named eumelanin along with a basic yellow pigment named psittacofulvin (psittacin for short). Some other parrot species produces a third pigment named advanced-psittacin which enables color & tones ranging from oranges, peaches, pinks to reds. When these feathers are exposed to a white light source, such as sunlight, only the blue part of the spectrum is reflected by the eumelanin granules. This reflected blue light passes through the yellow pigment layer, resulting in the green colouration known as lightgreen in only the budgerigar and/or green in any other naturally green coloured parrot species. The many color variations of budgerigars, such as albino, blue, cinnamon, Clearwinged, the various Fallows, Grey, Greygreen, Greywing, Lutino, Mauve, Olive, Opaline, Spangled, Suffused and Violet are the result of mutations that have occurred within specific genes. There are actually at least thirty-two known primary mutations established among budgerigars. These can combine to form hundreds of secondary mutations and color varieties which may or may not be stable. As is true with all animal species, color mutations occur in captivity as do in the wild. This has been demonstrated when captive-bred budgerigars have developed mutations that had only been previously recorded amongst wild populations. ==Classification of mutationsBasic groups=== Each of the thirty-two primary mutations belong to one of the four basic groups of mutations classified in parrot species genetics: Because of albinism this budgerigar has virtually no eumelanin pigment. This, together with the Blue mutation which removes the yellow pigmentation, produces a nearly pure white colouration along with clear (orange) beak, pink feet/skin, white-tipped clear (pink) toe nails and red eyes. *Albinism: where eumelanin is either partially or completely reduced in all body tissues and structures. *Dilution: where eumelanin is partially reduced in only feathering. *Leucism: where eumelanin is completely reduced from total or localized feathering. *Melanism: where eumelanin is increased in the feathering. ===Dominance relationship=== These mutations are inherited through one of the following dominance relationships. *autosomal-Co-Dominant (A-Co-D), *autosomal-Complete-Dominant (A-C-D), *autosomal-Incomplete-Dominant (A-I-D), *autosomal-recessive (A-R), *autosomal-Poly-Genic (A-P-G) *Sex- Linked-recessive (S-L-R) ===Table of primary mutations=== { style=\\"width:100%;\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" - Mutation(s) Common names & varieties Type Wild-type symbol (Locus) Allele Symbol Dominance Relationship - Dark D Green (Dark Green), D_Blue (Cobalt), DD Green (Olive) & DD_Blue (Mauve) Structural D+ D A-I-D - Blue 1 Blue-series color b+ b1 recessive with other b-locus alleles except b2, else A-R - Blue 2 Blue-series color b+ b2 recessive with other b-locus alleles except b1, else A-R - Blue 1-Blue 2 Yellowface I color b+ b1 / b2 (Hetero-allelic mutation produced by crossing Blue 1 & Blue 2 varieties) - Yellowface Yellowface II color b+ byf Dominant with other b-locus alleles except gf , else A-R - Goldenface Goldenface color b+ bgf Dominant with other b-locus alleles, else A-R - Crest-Factor (C-F) Circular Crested, Semicircular Crested & Tufted Structural Cr+ Cr A-P-G - Dominant Grey (Australian) Grey & Greygreen Structural G+ G A-C-D - English Grey English Grey & Greygreen Structural g+ g A-I-D (rare or extinct) - Anthracite Anthracite Structural An+ An A-I-D (rare) - Recessive Grey & Greygreen Australian recessive greygreen & grey Structural rg+ rg A-R (extremely rare or extinct) - Slate Slate (bluish-gray) Structural sl+ sl S-L-R - Violet  SF Violet (SF Violet Green), SF Violet Blue (Violet Skyblue), DF Violet Green (pure Violet Green) & DF Violet Blue (pure VIOLET), SF Violet D_Blue (show Violet), DF Violet D_Blue (VIOLET Mauve) Structural V+ V A-I-D - Dilute Suffused Green (Dilute Yellow) and Suffused Blue (Dilute White) Dilution dil+ dils A-R - Clearwing (CW) Clearwing Green (Yellowing) & Clearwing Blue (Whitewing) Dilution dil+ dilcw A-Co-D with dilgw allele, A-D over dild allele, else A-R - Greywing (GW) Greywing Green & Greywing Blue, Dilution dil+ dilgw A-Co-D with dilcw allele, A-D over dild allele, else A-R - Greywing-Clearwing Fullbodied-Greywing Green & Fullbodied-Greywing Blue Dilution dil+ dilcw / dilgw (Hetero- allelic mutation produced by crossing Clearwing & Greywing varieties) - ADMpied a.k.a.

Consequently, various mutations occurred and were soon established during this period. ===Timeline=== *1870‚Äì75 The very first registered sudden captive-bred color mutations were Suffused Green (a.k.a. Dilute Yellow), Greywinged Green and either one of the two types of Lutino (NSLino &/or SLino) mutations. All three occurred in aviaries in Great Britain or Europe. Of these three mutations, only the Suffused Green (a.k.a. Dilute Yellow) has survived. The latter was easily reproduced in great numbers and is nowadays very well established. The first Lutino mutation quickly vanished but it was re-established in Europe some time between 1931 and 1933. *1878‚Äì85 The Skyblue mutation suddenly occurred in continental Europe, most probably in Uccle, Belgium. Surprisingly, this variety was not imported in England until 1910. *1915 Single-Factored Dark-Green (a.k.a. Dark-Green) in France (where they were then commonly called 'Laurel' which is the French word for Bay (leaf &/or tree)) *1916 Double-Factored Dark-Green (a.k.a. Olive) in France. *1918‚Äì28 Respectively, Greywinged Green and Greywinged Blue appeared in England and continental Europe. *1920 **Crest-Factor in Australia. **Suffused Blue (a.k.a. Dilute White) in England and France. **Single-Factored Dark_Blue (a.k.a. Cobalt) in France. *1921 Double-Factored Dark_Blue (a.k.a. Mauve) in France. *1930 **Single-Factored Violet-Green (a.k.a. Violet Factor) in Australia (and were then 1st commonly called 'Satin Green') **The first Clearwinged Green (Yellowinged) appeared, developed by H. Pier in Sydney. *1931 **Cinnamon in England, Australia & Germany. **An unknown type of Fallow in California, U.S. This soon vanished. **The Germanfallow in Germany, recently been genetically classified and identified as the Bronzefallow (a.k.a. Brownfallow). **A plum-eyed mutation, similar looking to Fallow mutations, occurred in England. This vanished or at least became very rare. This mutation was most probably the Brownwings, one of the rarest color mutations of the species. **The first Albino specimens were produced in both England and continental Europe. *1932 **Three Fallow mutations occurred in England which became known as the Englishfallow. In Australia these have been genetically classified and identified as the Dunfallow or Greybrownfallow (a.k.a. Australianfallow). The Beigefallow or Palebrownfallow has been classified in South-Africa, but no reference seems to be available on this particular mutation. **The recessive Anti-dimorphic Pied (a.k.a. Danish Pied a.k.a. Harlequin) in Denmark. **The Australian (a.k.a. Banded) Pied in Australia. *1933 **Green Clearwinged (a.k.a. Yellow Wing) and Dominant Grey- Factor appear in Australia. **Both the NSL & the SL Lutino gene occurred in England and continental Europe. **Three Opaline mutations occurred. An Opaline Green hen was captured in the wild and sold to S. Terril in Adelaide. It was later-on reproduced and is most probably the ancestor of all Opaline specimens in Australia. Two sudden captive-bred Opaline mutations occurred in England and the Netherlands. *1934 Recessive grey factor in England. *1935 The various Yellowfaced_Blue and Goldenfaced_Blue occurred in several locations. *1939‚Äì46 Clearflighted_Dutchpied in Belgium. *1948 **Texas Clearbodied (a.k.a. SL- Clearbody) in the U.S. **Dominant Clearbodied (a.k.a. Easley's Clearbodied) in the U.S. **The first Cinnamon-Ino (a.k.a. Lacewings) cross-over mutation was produced in Australia. **The first Dark-Eyed-Clear (DEC) variety was produced in Belgium by combining the ADM Pied (a.k.a. Danish/Recessive pied) with either one of the two Dutchpied varieties (Continental or Clearflighted). *1970‚Äì74 Single-Factored and Double-Factored Spangled specimens were produced in Australia. *1975 Saddleback specimens were produced in Australia. *1992 Blackface specimens make their first appearance in the Netherlands. *2010 White Cap bred in Australia. These birds have a yellow face, but with a white cap. ===Notes=== It is possible that the Greywings mutation survived as the ancestor of all actual Greywings. However, it could be that the mutation lay dormant in asymptomatic mutant specimens until it was re-established between 1918 and 1925. Blue Greywing specimens were produced later on in 1928. It is possible that all Suffused mutation specimens and their varieties are descendants from the first captive mutant specimens. This would mean that Suffused is the oldest sudden captive-bred color mutation of the Budgerigar species. ==References== * * ==External links== * Martin Rasek's Budgerigar Genetic calculator * Inte Onsman's MUTAVI Research and Advice Group * Clive Hesford's The Genetics of Colour in the Budgerigar and other Parrots website * Budgie Colors and Mutations Guide * World Budgerigar Organization's Colour Standards * Down Under Aviary's Genetics page * Budgerigar Galore's Genetics Articles * Budgie Genetic Explorer Category:Aviculture Category:Vertebrate genetics ","title":"Budgerigar colour genetics"},{"id":"6225845","text":"Paul McEuen (born 1963) is an American physicist.

Locals refer to it as the Moab Tailings Pile. In 1952 U.S. geologist Charles Steen found the largest uranium deposit in the United States near Moab, Utah. The uranium was processed by the Uranium Reduction Company and the waste slurry was stored in an unlined pond adjacent to the river. The Uranium Reduction Company was sold in 1962 and renamed the Atlas Uranium Mill. Aerial view of the Atlas Mill Site near Moab, Utah, prior to the removal of the tailings pile After the mill was closed in 1984 the pond was capped. There was also a pile of mine tailings that was over tall at its highest point.http://www.gjem.energy.gov/moab/documents/Crescent_Junction/RAS_RAP_July2008/RAS_RAPJuly2008.pdf It is believed that pollutants from the waste tailings are leaching into the river, inferred from the lethal effect on fish, primarily from high concentrations of ammonia. The site was transferred to the United States Department of Energy for remediation under Title 1 of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act in 2001. In August 2005 the Department of Energy announced that 11.9 million short tons (10.8 million tonnes) of radioactive tailings would be moved, mostly by rail, and buried in a lined hole. The proposed holding site is public land at Crescent Junction, Utah, about from the Colorado River. In February 2006 a final Environmental Impact Statement met with United States Environmental Protection Agency approval. The cost of the relocation was originally estimated to be $300 million, but 2008 Department of Energy estimates are in excess of $720 million.Salt Lake Tribune Editorial August 8, 2008 http://www.sltrib.com/ci_10144500\\" The contract for the first transfer of the tailings has been awarded and the first relocation is expected to occur in late 2008. A series of works to extract and evaporate the water and ammonia from the pile before it reaches the Colorado River has been completed. ==DOE plan for re-location== The tailings pile in November, 2010, during the DOE's excavation and cleanup. The current Department of Energy plan to move the tailings is contracted out to Portage-North Wind LLC who has begun hauling the tailings from the current Atlas Uranium Mill site to the tiny town of Crescent Junction, Utah by railroad. This plan is based on the most current funding schedule which will provide for a complete removal by 2028. A series of amendments to the Defense Authorization Act, sponsored by Rep. Jim Matheson are attempting to move the completion date to 2019. If these become law, the rate of removal would be doubled. According to the current plan, huge \\"dirty\\" trucks pull 40-ton containers filled with tailings to a structure that will be located between the talings and Potash Road. Once in the structure the containers would be covered by lids. A radiological survey verifies that they have no radioactive material on the outside, and the containers will then be hauled by \\"clean\\" trucks up to a railroad line to be placed on rail cars for the transportation to the disposal site near Crescent Junction. Dirty trucks will never travel to the clean side of the lidding structure, and clean trucks will never be on the dirty side. Once at Crescent Junction the process will be reversed, with the exception that the tailings will be dumped out of end gates rather than from the top to minimize dust as well as prevent contamination to the outside containers. A knife-edge seal will be employed to ensure no materials dribble out of the end gates during the transfer. Six clean trucks will make 22 to 23 loops per day, on a 21.2-minute cycle, between the lidding area and the rail line. About 136 containers will be transported daily with a four-day-per-week schedule. An overpass is to be built across Potash Road so haul trucks will never encounter highway traffic. Rail shipments began in April 2009. The clean trucks were replaced by the rail line, with the containers still needed to be lidded as before. On March 3, 2010, the Department of Energy announced it had shipped one million tons of tailings. As of September 2019, 10 million tons of tailing (62%) have been removed.https://www.gjem.energy.gov/newsreleases/Moab_UMTRA_Project_Reaches_Cleanup_Milestone.pdf A well field is located between the tailing pile and the river, which extracts and purifies groundwater before it enters the Colorado river. As of February 2014 of ammonia and of uranium have been extracted from the wells. During low water periods, fresh water is injected into the wells. On July 29, 2014 the 7 millionth ton of tailing was placed in the disposal cell. ==Disposal site== The tailings and other contaminated material are being buried near Crescent Junction, Utah, northeast of the junction of Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 191, about 30 miles from the tailing pile. Excavation occurs in phases, two of which are complete as of July 2014. Each phase is about and is excavated to about . The contaminated material is first covered by a minimum layer of interim fill, then by a radon barrier composed of weathered mancos shale, a layer of sandy gravel as an infiltration and biointrusion layer, and of a frost protection layer composed of both soil and weathered shale. The cell is then topped with of rock. Cover material is sourced locally and from Fremont Junction, Utah. When finished, the cell will be about long and wide. It is estimated to be about above ground and will be fenced. Currently the DOE owns of land and has another in a 20-year withdrawal for the disposal cell, buffer space, support area, and access road. == References  *MoabTailings.org *Decommissioning of Moab, Utah, Uranium Mill Tailings Category:Geography of Grand County, Utah Category:Uranium mining in the United States Category:Moab, Utah Category:Mining in Utah ","title":"Moab uranium mill tailings pile"},{"id":"6225867","text":"Maxine Sullivan (May 13, 1911 ‚Äì April 7, 1987), born Marietta Williams in Homestead, Pennsylvania, was an American jazz vocalist and performer. As a vocalist, Maxine Sullivan was active for half a century, from the mid-1930s to just before her death in 1987. She is best known for her 1937 recording of a swing version of the Scottish folk song \\"Loch Lomond\\". Throughout her career, Sullivan also appeared as a performer on film as well as on stage. A precursor to better-known later vocalists such as Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, Maxine Sullivan is considered one of the best jazz vocalists of the 1930s.Will Friedwald, \\"A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers,\\" 64 (2010). Singer Peggy Lee named Sullivan as a key influence in several interviews. ==Career== Sullivan began her music career singing in her uncle's band, The Red Hot Peppers, in her native Pennsylvania, in which she occasionally played the flugelhorn and the valve trombone, in addition to singing.Linda Dahl, \\"Stormy Weather: The Music and Lives of a Century of Jazzwomen,\\" 133, (1995). In the mid 1930s she was discovered by Gladys Mosier (then working in Ina Ray Hutton's big band). Mosier introduced her to Claude Thornhill, which led to her first recordings made in June 1937. Shortly thereafter, Sullivan became a featured vocalist at the Onyx Club in New York City.Arnold Shaw, \\"The Street that Never Slept: New York's Fabled 52nd St.\\" 93 (1971). During this period, she began forming a professional and close personal relationship with bassist John Kirby, who became her second husband in 1938. Sullivan in 1947Early sessions with Kirby in 1937 yielded a hit recording of a swing version of the Scottish folk song \\"Loch Lomond\\" featuring Sullivan on vocals.Ebony, Vol. 29, No. 9, 138 This early success \\"branded\\" Sullivan's style, leading her to sing similar swing arrangements of traditional folk tunes mostly arranged by pianist Claude Thornhill, such as \\"If I Had a Ribbon Bow\\" and \\"I Dream of Jeanie\\".Richard Cook, Brian Morton, \\"The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD\\", 1516 (2004). Her early popularity also led to a brief appearance in the movie Going Places with Louis Armstrong. In 1940, Sullivan and Kirby were featured on the radio program Flow Gently Sweet Rhythm, making them the first black jazz stars to have their own weekly radio series. During the 1940s Sullivan then performed with a wide range of bands, including her husband's sextet and groups headed by Teddy Wilson, Benny Carter, and Jimmie Lunceford. Sullivan performed at many of New York's hottest jazz spots such as the Ruban Bleu, the Village Vanguard, the Blue Angel, and the Penthouse. In 1949, Sullivan appeared on the short-lived CBS Television series Uptown Jubilee, and in 1953 starred in the play, Take a Giant Step. In 1956, Sullivan shifted from her earlier style and recorded the album A Tribute to Andy Razaf; originally on the Period record label, the album featured Sullivan's interpretations of a dozen tunes featuring Razaf's lyrics. The album also highlighted the music of Fats Waller, including versions of \\"Keepin' Out of Mischief Now\\", \\"How Can You Face Me?\\", \\"My Fate Is in Your Hands\\", \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\", \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\", and \\"Blue Turning Grey Over You\\". Sullivan was joined by a sextet that was reminiscent of John Kirby's group of 15 years prior, including trumpeter Charlie Shavers and clarinetist Buster Bailey. From 1958 Sullivan worked as a nurse before resuming her musical career in 1966, performing in jazz festivals alongside her fourth husband Cliff Jackson, who can be heard on the 1966 live recording of Sullivan's performance at the Manassas Jazz Festival. Sullivan continued to perform throughout the 1970s and made a string of recordings during the 1980s, despite being over 70 years old. She was nominated for the 1979 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical (won by Carlin Glynn) for her role in My Old Friends, and participated in the film biography Maxine Sullivan: Love to Be in Love, shortly before her death. ==Personal life== Sullivan married four times; her second husband was the band leader John Kirby (married 1938, divorced 1941), while her fourth husband, whom she married in 1950, was the stride pianist Cliff Jackson, who died in 1970. She had two children, Orville Williams (b. 1928)Jet magazine Vol. VII No.3, p. 57, 25 November 1954. Johnson Publications. and Paula Morris (b. 1945). ==Death== Maxine Sullivan died aged 75 in 1987 in New York City after suffering a seizure.

It is named for Thomas Cass, an important pioneer surveyor in the area.Peter Bromley Maling, \\"Thomas Cass\\", 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand. State Highway 73 passes near the town, and the Midland Line between Christchurch and the West Coast was opened to the town in 1910, with the full line opened in 1923 when the Otira Tunnel was completed. Since November 1987, the world-famous TranzAlpine passenger train has run through the town. There are 5 houses in Cass today, but only one resident (currently Barrie Drummond), making it one of the few places in the world with a population of one resident. The Cass Trust Hotel and Tavern Still Operates in the Old Ministry of Works Shed. Cass is home to the large civil contracting company, Cass Contracting which employs over 170 highly skilled staff. For some time from 1910, while the Midland Line was under construction (and in particular, the tunnel at Arthur's Pass), Cass was the railhead coming from the east coast. At that time, Cass had a population of around 800. The Cass railway station was painted in 1936 by Rita Angus; it is \\"one of New Zealand's best-loved works of art\\". The University of Canterbury has a field station at Cass, commonly used for undergraduate field trips and research. == References  * Rita Angus‚Äôs ‚ÄòCass‚Äô Cass Contracting * https://sites.google.com/site/casscontractingltd/home Category:Selwyn District Category:Populated places in Canterbury, New Zealand ","title":"Cass, New Zealand"},{"id":"6225898","text":"Mills of Ap√∫lia.

In terms of overall tone and style, the series is based principally on the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko and Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. runs on The Amazing Spider-Man comics, with a similar balance of action, drama and comedy as well as a high school setting. However, it also tends to blend material from all eras of the comic's run and other sources such as the Ultimate Spider-Man comics by Brian Michael Bendis and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.Interview with Greg Weisman (Part 1) by Sean Elliott: March 7, 2008 The Spectacular Spider-Man premiered on March 8, 2008, during the Kids' WB programming block of The CW. The series aired its second season on Marvel's sister network Disney XD in the United States and ended its run on November 18, 2009. The entire series was broadcast in Canada on Teletoon. Although a third season was initially planned, the series was cancelled before production could begin due to legal problems between Disney (who purchased Marvel during the show's run) and Sony Pictures Television (who created the series). Despite the legal troubles and cancellation, the series has received widespread universal acclaim from both critics and fans, with much of the praise being aimed at the faithfulness and fidelity to the classic Spider-Man comics, the fresh, unique yet faithful re-imagining of classic Spider-Man concepts and themes, the unique art style, character designs, voice acting, writing, along with Josh Keaton's portrayal of the titular character, and the balance of comedy, drama, action and the exploration of surprisingly mature themes and the realistic insight into the titular character's internal struggles with the burden and problems of being a superhero. Many have praised the series as being, arguably, the best adaptation of Spider-Man to date. ==Synopsis== The two seasons of the series are each set during a semester of Peter's high school years, with season one running from September to November and season two from December to March. Producer Greg Weisman has stated that the show's theme is \\"The Education of Peter Parker.\\"SDCC 07: The Spectacular Spider-Man July 27, 2007 In keeping with this theme, each of the series arcs is named after courses of study: season one's arcs are Biology 101, Economics 101, Chemistry 101 and Psychology 101, and season two's arcs are Engineering 101, Human Development 101, Criminology 101 and Drama 101.Ask Greg June 3, 2009 ===Season 1=== The first season features Peter Parker beginning his junior year at Midtown Manhattan Magnet High School, having only been bitten by the genetically-modified spider and acquired his powers and alias as Spider-Man in recent months. While harassed at school, particularly by football star Flash Thompson, he is close friends with classmates Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn. In order to help support his Aunt May after the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter gets a job as a freelance photographer at the Daily Bugle, owned by the loudmouth, irascible, egotistical, and gruff publisher J. Jonah Jameson, by obtaining pictures of his alter-ego in action so he could carry out a smear campaign against Spider-Man that has, at least temporarily, turned much of the city against the hero. Peter and Gwen are also given junior lab assistant positions under Dr. Curt Connors at Empire State University, where they join their friend and mentor Eddie Brock. As Spider-Man uses his powers to fight against petty crime, he gains the attention of the Big Man who orchestrates crime in New York City, with attention initially drawn to his fights with the Enforcers, Vulture, Electro and the Lizard. With the help of Norman Osborn, his chief scientist Dr. Otto Octavius and criminal Hammerhead, the Big Man (alias of crime lord Tombstone) oversees the development of a project to create \\"supervillains\\" designed to distract Spider-Man from other crimes and stop damaging his profits. These new enemies include Sandman and Rhino, both petty criminals who regularly fell victim to Spider-Man. However, the Big Man's plans become greatly complicated when the mysterious Green Goblin enters the picture. Throughout the first season, the other opponents are introduced are Black Cat who has a crush on him, Shocker and Chameleon. Quentin Beck and Phineas Mason appear as Chameleon's associates. After the Green Goblin is vanquished, Spider-Man's symbiote black suit makes an appearance, eventually leading to Eddie Brock's transformation into Venom. ===Season 2=== Peter Parker's life becomes significantly more complicated as he finds himself torn between both Gwen Stacy and Liz Allan, both of whom have confessed their feelings for him; he eventually chooses Liz. Norman Osborn takes on the role of Peter's mentor, pulling strings to re-establish his job as Dr. Connors' lab assistant, as well as overseeing the installment of the conniving Dr. Miles Warren into the ESU Labs. Meanwhile, as Spider-Man, Peter encounters new villains Mysterio and Kraven the Hunter, leading him to investigate the activities of a mysterious new crime lord known as the \\"Master Planner\\". When the Master Planner's first scheme fails, Spider-Man is faced with a three-way gang war between the Planner's super-villain forces, the Big Man's established order, and the old guard of Silvio \\"Silvermane\\" Manfredi's family. Peter's search for Eddie Brock also leads to the return of Venom, who attempted to expose Spider-Man's secret identity and remove his powers. Finally, when the three major crime lords are arrested, Spider-Man once again goes up against the Green Goblin, who is once again bent on eliminating the wall-crawler once and for all. The series ends with a cliffhanger due to the show being cancelled before a third season could be produced. Other new characters introduced in the second season include Calypso, Sha Shan Nguyen, Silver Sable, Roderick Kingsley and Molten Man. Quentin Beck and Phineas Mason return as Mysterio and the Tinkerer respectively. ==Characters== The timeline of the original Spider-Man story-arcs has been condensed and reconfigured in order to include classic and important characters who originally appeared much later. Characters such as Mary Jane Watson, Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn are depicted not completely as direct equivalents to their older counterparts from the comics, but rather as characters who evolve into their established roles from the comics. The series also sports a very wide supporting cast. Every named character who appears in the series, even very minor characters, is based on a character who appeared in the original comics, Ultimate Spider-Man series (such as Kenny Kong), or film series (such as Bernard Houseman). The series also incorporates a number of villains from different eras of the Spider-Man universe, almost all of whom are introduced as regular characters in first episodes before they transform into established villain identities (an example is Eddie Brock, who was introduced at the very beginning of the series, but only became Venom in the season 1 finale). ==CastMain cast=== *Josh Keaton - Peter Parker / Spider-Man *Benjamin Diskin - Eddie Brock / Venom *James Arnold Taylor - Harry Osborn, Fredrick Foswell / Patch *Lacey Chabert - Gwen Stacy *Alanna Ubach - Liz Allan *Kevin Michael Richardson - L.

The series was planned for a 2007 release on DVD while international distributing to TV channels including Sony's. The DVD format was to be four discs with three episodes each. Greg Weisman and Victor Cook developed the show. The Spectacular Spider-Man was announced by Kids' WB Senior Vice President and General Manager Betsy McGowen on June 18, 2007 as being picked up and slated for an early 2008 premiere by the Kids' WB! on The CW. Weisman and Cook were assigned to the series at the time as supervising producer and producer/supervising director, respectively. The art style of the series is more simplified than in previous incarnations but retain their iconic elements. This choice was made to ensure Spider-Man would move as he should and replicate the fluidity from Sam Raimi's movie incarnation. The series was produced by its television animation studio, Adelaide Productions (due to Sony's holding of the Spider-Man film franchise rights) with Hanho Heung-Up Co., Ltd., Dong Woo Animation and MOI Animation, Inc. contributed some of the animation for this series. The title sequence for the show was directed by Victor Cook with the theme song written and performed by The Tender Box. Weisman has explained that in adapting the comics for the show, the producers \\"tried to follow what [they] came to call \\"The Five Cs\\": Contemporary, Cohesive, Coherent, Classic and iConic.\\"Ask Greg May 14, 2009 \\"The advantage of hindsight\\" allowed the show to be \\"more coherent and cohesive than the original\\" comic continuity, which contains \\"considerable duplication, a false start here and there, [and] conflicting interpretations.\\" Weisman studied all of the characters to find their \\"core essence,\\" and the show often combined characters and storylines when necessary for the sake of coherence. For example, Flash Thompson was found to be \\"a bully, who deep down is actually an honorable guy,\\" while Shocker was found to be an \\"iconic costume\\" with no character, so he was combined with Montana. The Spectacular Spider-Man debuted on March 8, 2008 with back-to-back episodes, \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" and \\"Interactions\\", under the banner \\"Spectacular Saturday\\". The series debuted under a cloud as The CW had just indicated that the network would end its kid's block for a brokered outsourced block. While Culver had already started producing the second season. ==Cancellation and future plot events== Greg Weisman was hoping to reach 65 episodes.Ask Greg (Weisman): May 03, 2008 26 episodes of The Spectacular Spider-Man were produced in total.Press Release For Upcoming \\"The Spectacular Spider-Man\\" DVDs, Season Two Updates by James Harvey: January 30, 2009 The series stopped production with a renewal dependent upon the ratings for season 2 on the U.S. Disney XD channel and the sales of the DVDs. On September 1, 2009, the television rights for Spider-Man were returned to Marvel by Sony. At the time, President of Marvel Animation Eric Rollman further stated that \\"no decisions have been made either way\\" regarding the fate of the series. November 1, 2009 Newsarama reported that the series' cancellation occurred just after The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment in December 2009.Pepose, David. \\"ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN: The Animated Series, Disney XD 2011\\". Newsarama. April 13, 2010. On April 13, 2010, Marvel announced that a new series loosely based on the Ultimate Spider- Man comic book storyline would air on Disney XD in the fall of 2011, which actually aired on April 1, 2012. The same day the new series was announced, Weisman told IGN: \\"I've heard nothing directly from Marvel, but I think the Ultimate Spider-Man announcement makes it fairly clear that Spectacular is over.\\"Goldman, Eric. \\"Ultimate Spider-Man Comes to TV\\". IGN. April 14, 2010. Marvel Animation and Sony also commented on this to Marvel Animation Age, confirming that the series had ceased production. Weisman would later write that in 2009, in exchange for concessions on the movie rights, Sony had relinquished to Marvel its license to produce television works that used Spider-Man and associated characters, but had retained ownership of The Spectacular Spider-Man series and all of the production elements created specifically for it, such as character designs and storylines. Therefore, neither Sony nor Marvel could continue production of the series, as each lacked some of the essential rights to do so. Additionally, at approximately the same time that Sony returned the Spider-Man television rights to Marvel, Marvel was acquired by The Walt Disney Company.Ask Greg (Weisman): February 09, 2012Ask Greg (Weisman): August 31, 2009 Due to the show's cancellation, many storylines were abandoned. In season three, Curt would have moved in Florida and begun working on a cure for Electro and a planned DVD Spring Break movie would have also been set in Florida between season 2 and 3, as well as movies between season 3 and 4, and between season 4 and 5. Scorpion, Hydro- Man, and Hobgoblin were confirmed to be major villains for season three, in addition to Carnage and Mister Negative. After the initial 65 episode series plan and movies, Weisman had wished to produce DVD sequels covering Peter's college years and his eventual marriage to Mary Jane. ==Reception== The series was released to universal critical acclaim, with many proclaiming the show to be the best Spider-Man adaptation. Before the series premiere, Matt Sernaker of ComicsOnline interviewed some of the Spectacular Spider-Man development team at WonderCon 2008 after a preview screening and stated: \\"This new Spider- Man series truly is SPECTACULAR... surpasses all of the previous incarnations with ease. If you are a Spidey fan you will not want to miss this.\\" Early in the series' run, Alan Kistler of ComicMix called the series \\"one of the best superhero adaptations I've ever seen (and trust me, I've watched more than anyone will probably consider reasonable). It's fun, it's smart, it's mature, it's witty and every episode leaves me wanting more.\\" In an article entitled \\"8 Reasons to Watch Spectacular Spider-Man\\", Reggie White, Jr. from Spiderfan wrote: \\"If you aren't watching The Spectacular Spider-Man on CW Kids' WB, you are missing out on what is quickly becoming one of the greatest Spidey cartoons of all-time.\\" Stu from Marvel Animation Age writes in his review of the series: \\"At time of writing, The Spectacular Spider-Man stands as Marvel's finest animated effort and surpasses most of DC's finest efforts ‚Äì the only shows in Spectacular's league really, is Batman: The Animated Series itself. With more episodes, it may just surpass it.\\" IGN stated that Greg Weisman \\"has only cemented his reputation for quality television animation with his work on Spider-Man.\\" IGN also named The Spectacular Spider-Man the 30th in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows in January 2009. The Spectacular Spider-Man was awarded Best Animated Series in both 2008 and 2009 with the series' version of the main character being named TV's Best Hero in 2008. Subsequently, it was placed second in the Top 25 Comic Book TV Shows in 2011. Outside of comic resources, Variety highlighted that \\"although seemingly conceived largely to push a new line of Hasbro toys... the soon-to-fadeout Kids' WB (on the CW!) delivers a credible new version of 'Spider-Man,' emphasizing his relatable headaches as a 16-year-old superhero.\\" TV Guide listed the series as one of the sixty greatest animated series of all time. ==Home media== The series was initially developed so that each three to four episode arc could be edited together into a feature-length home video release. The first DVD for the show, entitled \\"Attack of the Lizard\\", followed this plan with the first three episodes edited together to form a stand-alone story with additional footage. The region 1 version was released on September 9, 2008.TVshowsonDVD.com by David Lambert: June 28, 2008 This release strategy changed with the region 1 release of the second and third DVDs of the series on March 17, 2009. Originally promoted with the titles \\"Rise of the Supervillains\\" and \\"The Goblin Strikes\\" respectively, these releases were revised to feature the televised versions of the episodes and were ultimately released as numbered volumes. Since then, retailer stores have stopped releasing \\"Attack of the Lizard\\", and have replaced it with volume 1.

The town is part of Llantrisant Community Council. ==Geography== Talbot Green is located at the mouth of the short and mountainous Ely Valley, between Mynydd Garthmaelwg (Llantrisant forest) and Y Graig (Llantrisant). The River Ely runs through along the town boundary before continuing to Pontyclun, running alongside the Warehouses of A F Blakemore & Son ltd, who run a portion of the SPAR UK retail chain. The town is bordered by the hill town of Llantrisant to the east, the Village of Pontyclun to the South and Llanharan a few miles to the West. ==Transport== Sign showing the transport links in the area The area has links to the rest of Wales with the A4119 linking it in the south to the M4 Motorway, and to the north to the South Wales Valleys. The Talbot Green by- pass opened in 1991 to relieve traffic in the town through disabling access to or from Pontyclun via Cowbridge Road, and provided a shorter route for the A473 Bridgend to Pontypridd Road. In September 2010, a ¬£90m by-pass linking Talbot Green to Pontypridd was opened. The by-pass is notable for its three dormouse bridges, built to protect the endangered animals. A single track railway runs north from Pontyclun railway station (which is the towns nearest railway station), turning west at Talbot Green to run roughly parallel to the Afon Clun, alongside the north of the A473, and originally ran to the Cwm Coking Works at Tynant, Beddau. All the original railway infrastructure remains intact between Talbot Green and Pontyclun, including the track, signals and bridges. The track is still embedded in the road where it crosses the A473, the warning lights remain at the roadside and the roadsigns warn drivers to stop if they see warning lights flash at the level crossing. A recent consultative study (Sewta Rail Strategy Study‚ÄîJanuary 2006) has considered the possibility of reopening the Pontyclun to Beddau branch line, as a passenger line rather than just for freight. This would require new stations at Talbot Green, Llantrisant, Gwaun Meisgyn and Beddau (Tynant). ==Retail parks== Talbot Green has two large retail parks, Glamorgan Vale retail park and Talbot Green shopping park. ===Glamorgan Vale retail park=== Glamorgan Vale retail park was opened circa 1996 and an extra unit was built in 2004 around the same time as the expansion of Talbot Green shopping park. It is located on the A473 Talbot Green bypass. It has the total of 11 shopping units and 1 fast food/drive thru restaurant. ===Talbot Green shopping park=== Talbot Green shopping park was opened circa 1996 initially with 3 units, then later to 14 shopping units and 1 fast food restaurant and 2 coffee shop within the store concessions in 2004/05 and expanded further again after one unit was divided into two in 2012 thus having a total of 15 shopping units. It expanded once again due to a conversion of a former Comet unit into a food quarter containing 3 restaurants and a coffee shop. The conversion started in May 2014 and was completed in late November with the restaurants and coffee shop opening in December 2014, thus dropping the shopping units back down to 14 and the food and drink outlets and concessions up to 7 now known collectively as 'Taste @ TG'. In early 2015, another retail unit was divided into 2 thus raising a total of shopping units back up to 15. Some units are located alongside the A4119 Talbot Green to Ynysmaerdy Dual Carriageway which are the older units (one of which has been converted to a food and drink outlet) and the other units are located on the former Tesco site and Newpark shopping precinct (which had independently run businesses that have subsequently moved elsewhere in the area or closed completely) after the former relocated in 2003 to the former site of the Homeworld Department store, which closed in 1999 and was demolished the following year and left derelict for several years. There is also a Tesco Extra store, that was once the largest in Wales, after the store was expanded in 2005, but overtaken by the store in Culverhouse Cross, and later Fforestfach. ==Facilities== The town also has a golf club, and industrial estates including Coedcae Lane and Lanelay Industrial Estate. The Department Store Leekes is also situated in Talbot Green at Cowbridge Road, near Pontyclun. The town also has a development of Offices, Hotel, Pub and a private Health facility which is located in Magden Park on the Ely Meadows alongside the A4119 Talbot Green to Ynysmeardy dual carriageway near the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. It also has the Avionics department of British Airways and is also the headquarters of the Welsh Blood Service. Talbot Green's most significant building is Lanelay Hall, until recently the headquarters of the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, who moved just over two miles away, to the former Buy As You View head office at Forest View Business Park, Ynysmaerdy, Llantrisant, in February 2009. ==Governance== Talbot Green is also an electoral ward within the Llantrisant community, bounded to the east by the A4119 road. It elects a county councillor to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council.

Talbot Green is also a ward for Llantrisant Community Council, electing three community councillors.Councillors, Llantrisant Community Council. Retrieved 29 October 2018. ==Future Developments== Improvements to the road network, in particular the A4119 linking the Rhondda Valleys to the M4, through Tonyrefail and Talbot Green, brought development pressure to the area around Llantrisant. Extensive housing development has taken place recently in the towns along the A473, the main Pontypridd to Bridgend road‚Äîlinking Llantwit Fardre to Llantrisant, Talbot Green, Llanharan and Pencoed‚Äîthe road that runs parallel to the Afon Clun from Rhiwsaeson to Pontyclun. ==New Town centre scheme== On June 2011, it was announced there are proposals to make Talbot Green a \\"new town centre\\" by building a new supermarket, 40 shops, a multi screen cinema, cafes, restaurants, bars and a hotel. There will also be offices for local businesses, a range of civic and community facilities, apartments and houses. They are to be located on the former sites of Staedtler and Purolite and the surrounding brownfield land. The new scheme will include a new Leekes store to replace the existing one on the same site. The scheme is expected to create up to 1,900 jobs in the area. The scheme as of March 2013 had been given the greenlight by the local council, however development won't begin until the planning consent for the supermarket and a petrol filling station is granted. In May 2014 the new Sainsbury's supermarket had been given the green light to anchor the new town centre scheme with infrastructure works scheduled to begin in the autumn of 2014 and the development of the rest of the scheme will take place in due course. Work on the scheme officially began in February 2015 and is expected to be completed in the next 2 to 3 years. It has since stalled for unknown reasons. ==References External links == * photos of Talbot Green and surrounding area * Talbot Green shopping park Category:Villages in Rhondda Cynon Taf Category:Wards of Rhondda Cynon Taf Category:Llantrisant ","title":"Talbot Green"},{"id":"6225949","text":"Cross Keys or Crosskeys may refer to: ==PlacesUnited Kingdom=== * The village of Crosskeys, Wales, UK ** served by Crosskeys railway station ** location of Crosskeys College, a campus of Coleg Gwent ** home to Cross Keys RFC, a rugby union team * Crosskeys Bridge, a swing bridge in Lincolnshire, England * \\"The Cross Keys\\" is a common name for pubs in the United Kingdom ** Cross Keys, Covent Garden, London pub * Walpole Cross Keys, a village and civil parish in Norfolk, England ===United States=== (by state then city): * Cross Keys, Delaware, USA, an unincorporated community in Sussex County * Cross Keys, Georgia, now part of Brookhaven, Georgia * Cross Keys, Lexington, Kentucky, USA, a neighborhood in southwestern Lexington alternatively called West Gardenside * Crosskeys, Louisiana, an unincorporated community * The Village of Cross Keys in Baltimore, Maryland * Cross Keys, New Jersey, USA, an unincorporated area in Monroe Township, Gloucester County ** location of Cross Keys Airport * Crossed Keys Tavern, an historic stone building located in Turtlecreek Township near Lebanon, Ohio * Cross Keys, Pennsylvania, USA, an unincorporated community in Adams County * Cross Keys, South Carolina, USA, an unincorporated community in Union County * Cross Keys, Virginia, USA, an unincorporated community located in Rockingham County ** location of the Battle of Cross Keys in the American Civil War ==Other== Crossed keys and triple tiara, (see Papal regalia and insignia) * The crossed Keys of Heaven, the symbol of Saint Peter, an element in: ** Papal regalia and insignia ** the Coat of arms of the Holy See ** the arms used by the Guild of Cathedral Vergers ** The coat of arms of the Cathedral City of Peterborough * The symbols of Peterhouse Boat Club and by extension of Peterhouse, Cambridge * Cross Keys Boat Club, associated with Peterhouse, Cambridge * Official drink of St Peter's College, Oxford ","title":"Cross keys"},{"id":"6225980","text":"Llanharry () is a village, community (civil parish) and electoral ward in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales.

At the age of fourteen she won a scholarship to the National Art School at East Sydney Technical College. In the dramatic architectural surroundings which had previously comprised Darlinghurst Gaol, Isherwood learned an appreciation of linear perspective and accurate draughtsmanship which she later applied with great skill to her rural landscapes. In 1929 she commenced work as a fashion artist with an advertising agency, continuing her studies for a further five years at the National Art School and Royal Art Society as an evening student. She later worked as a freelance artist and illustrator. Isherwood's first exhibited work with the Australian Watercolour Institute in 1934 was a small painting of a building site. From that time she became a frequent exhibitor in major art exhibitions. She was a student of Antonio Dattilo Rubbo.Dabron (2006) p. 29 She became part of the Sydney bohemian art scene, and met John Dabron whom she married in 1940. They moved to Springwood in the Blue Mountains and had two children, Josephine and Jacqueline. They divorced in 1948 After the divorce, she returned to fashion drawing and illustration to support herself, pursuing her art interests, as she had before, on the weekend. She took up full-time painting in 1952. From 1961 to 1974, Isherwood taught at the National Art School. This was a period of conflicting views in the teaching of art in Sydney, a time when a disciplinary approach to the skills of perspective, anatomy and design was considered by many of both the teachers and students alike as pass√© and unnecessary to the creation of works of art, the stylistic vogue in teaching being Abstract Expressionism. Jean Isherwood was one of the several teachers who determinedly maintained the opposite position. An exacting teacher, she stalked her perspective drawing students with a kneadable putty eraser in hand, challenging their skills with arrangements of battered metal rubbish bins, piles of broken chairs and, on rainy days, a dripping sixteen-rib umbrella. It was said of Miss Isherwood that no student escaped her class without being able to draw parallel lines and precise ellipses, freehand. In 1959 Isherwood travelled around New South Wales by car. From that time onwards, she became primarily a landscape painter, and, through her attachment to the countryside, a major exhibitor in the art competitions held in conjunction with the shows run by the local Agricultural Societies and culminating each year in the Sydney Royal Easter Show with its exhibition attracting hundreds of entrants. From 1950 until her death Isherwood won more than 100 first prizes in various art competitions. ==\\"My Country\\"== In 1974 Isherwood made a trip to Central Australia. On her return journey, passing through Tamworth, New South Wales, she was struck by the beauty of the countryside of that region and in 1976 purchased a property at Moonbi, where she was to live until 1987 when she moved to Tamworth. Isherwood, as a child, and like most other Australian children for many years, learnt by heart Dorothea Mackellar's iconic poem, \\"My Country\\", in which an Australian explains to an English listener how she is not moved by the gentle landscape of England with soft, dim skies and green lanes, but by the harsh beauty of Australia. In 1982 Isherwood heard on the radio that a statue was to be erected as a memorial to Dorothea Mackellar at Gunnedah, on Australia Day, 26 January 1983. Isherwood had long had it in mind to create a series of works illustrating the writer's most famous poem. Prompted by the imminent celebration, Isherwood created a series of thirty four watercolour paintings for exhibition in Gunnedah in conjunction with the unveiling of the statue. Parched landscape with storm clouds The images represent the diversity of the Australian landscape and include \\"the filmy veil of greenness' seen from Isherwood's own window, a flood on the Darling River, a bushfire in the Blue Mountains and a forest of ringbarked trees near Armidale. This latter painting is one of Isherwood's most masterly works, showing her exceptional control over both the watercolour technique and perspective. As is usual in a watercolour, those parts of the painting which are white are left unpainted, in this case a forest of dead tree trunks. In the narrow spaces between the array of trees Isherwood has painted a landscape that rolls away in layers to the distance. The subject would have been impressive, in oils. In watercolour, however, the technical demands are extraordinary, as is the facility with which it has been achieved. The paintings were eventually put on permanent display in the Gunnedah Bicentennial Regional Gallery. Isherwood set about painting a series of oils based on the watercolours. These were exhibited at the Artarmon Galleries in Sydney in 1986. In November 2004, Isherwood exhibited with seven other well-known Australian artists, all over the age of eighty at an exhibition called Eighty and Over, at Max Taylor's Gallery at Summer Hill, Sydney. Jean Isherwood died at home on 6 January 2006, aged 94 years. Her funeral notice requested that those attending should wear bright colours. ==Exhibitions, societies and awards== From 1946, Isherwood had nineteen exhibitions, of which three were with her daughter, Jaqueline Dabron, in the state capitals of Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. A retrospective exhibition was held in the New South Wales regional galleries of Tamworth and Muswellbrook. In 2012, thirty-two of Isherwood's watercolors were featured in Sister Cities, the inaugural exhibition of Gallery Lane Cove on Sydney's north shore. Her portrait of Marjorie Cotton was exhibited in First Ladies: Significant Australian Women 1913-2013 at the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra. Her work is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; the Art Gallery of NSW; the Howard Hinton Collection, Armidale Regional Gallery; the Tamworth Art Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra and many other regional galleries and private collections. Isherwood was a member of the Australian Watercolour Institute from 1948 and a member of the Royal Art Society from 1976, being elected a Fellow in 1982. In 1994 Jean Isherwood was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for her contribution to the Arts for painting in oils and watercolours. ==Notes References == * The Australian Watercolour Institute * Dabron, Joe (2006) \\"Vibrancy was the core of her work: Jean de Courtenay Isherwood, Painter, 1911-2006\\", in The Sydney Morning Herald, 29 March 2006, p. 29 * Isherwood's Obituary ABC News * Dorothea Mackellar Society * Artnews ==External links== * Art Gallery of NSW * National Gallery of Australia * National Portrait Gallery, Canberra * New England Regional Art Museum, Armidale, NSW * Dorothea Mackellar Society * The National Art School, Sydney * The Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales * Gunnedah, NSW * Jean Isherwood at Australian Art Category:1911 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia Category:Australian women painters Category:People from Marrickville Category:Australian watercolourists Category:20th-century Australian painters Category:20th-century Australian women artists Category:Women watercolorists ","title":"Jean Isherwood"},{"id":"6226015","text":"Crimes Against is the fourth album by Mitch Benn, released in 2005 under the name of 'Mitch Benn and The Distractions' and featuring his backing band composed of Kirsty Newton (of Siskin) and Tasha Baylis (of Hepburn).

She appeared in films including South Pacific. As a teenager, she co-starred in the Errol Flynn film Cuban Rebel Girls, and had a relationship with him. ==Early years== Aadland was born in Hollywood, California. She entered show business as a youngster, appearing in the film Death of a Salesman (1951). ==Biography== Beverly Elaine Aadland was 17 at the time she was with actor Errol Flynn when he died of a heart attack on October 14, 1959, in Vancouver, British Columbia at the age of 50. In 1961, Aadland's mother, Florence Aadland, alleged in the book The Big Love that actor Flynn had a sexual relationship with her daughter starting at age 15, yet there is also speculation he was led to believe she was 18. The book would be turned into a one-woman Broadway show starring Tracey Ullman as Florence. The memoir was reissued in 2018 by Spurl Editions. Beverly Aadland gave an account of her relationship with Flynn in People in 1988, confirming that she had had a sexual relationship with Flynn in her teens. Her relationship with Flynn was the subject of the 2013 movie The Last of Robin Hood. Aadland was played by Dakota Fanning. Alt URL === Personal life === In 1960, William Stanciu, her then boyfriend, died in her apartment after being shot in a struggle between the two. That event led to her being a ward of the court for the following year. Aadland was married and divorced twice before she married Ronald Fisher in the late 1960s. The couple had a daughter.

The number of MPs belonging to this group was rather small at first, but it gained influence as the military situation worsened. After the signing of armistice, Paasikivi established his cabinet, which included members of the previous opposition group. ==Background== Paasikivi, the leading statesman of the group had concluded by 1943 that Germany was going to lose the war and Finland was in great danger. However, his initial opposition to the pro-German line was too well known, and his first initiatives for peace negotiations were met with little support both from Field Marshal Mannerheim and Risto Ryti, who was the war-time President. Negotiations were conducted intermittently in 1943‚Äì44 between Finland and its representative Juho Kusti Paasikivi on the one side, and the Western Allies and the Soviet Union on the other, but no agreement was reached. However, by autumn 1944, the need for peace was becoming more evident: Mannerheim had repeatedly reminded the Germans that in case their troops in Estonia retreated, Finland would be forced to make peace even at very unfavourable terms. Soviet-occupied Estonia would have provided a favourable base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Finnish cities, and would have strangled Finnish access to the sea. When the Germans indeed did withdraw, the Finnish desire to end the war increased. President Risto Ryti resigned, and Finland's military leader and national hero, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, was extraordinarily appointed president by the parliament, accepting responsibility for ending the war. On September 4, 1944 the cease-fire ended military actions. An armistice was signed in Moscow on September 19 between the Soviet Union and Finland. Finland had to make many limiting concessions. Immediately after the ceasefire, Mannerheim appointed Paasikivi, so far leader of the Peace opposition, as the Prime Minister. For the first time in Finland a Communist, Yrj√∂ Leino, was included in the Cabinet. Paasikivi's policies were radically different than those of the previous 25 years. His main effort was to prove that both parties would gain from confident peaceful relations. He had to comply with many Soviet demands, including the War Crimes trial, which sentenced leading politicians (at the time of the Continuation war) into jail. When Mannerheim resigned, parliament selected Paasikivi as the succeeding president.

There are actually two mills: one was purpose-built to grind flint for use in the pottery industry, and the other was converted to the same purpose from use as a corn-mill. The mill complex includes a miller's cottage, two flint kilns, a drying kiln and outbuildings, and is adjacent to the Caldon Canal.

They are part of the outer fibrous layer of periosteum, entering into the outer circumferential and interstitial lamellae of bone tissue. Sharpey's fibres are also used to attach muscle to the periosteum of bone by merging with the fibrous periosteum and underlying bone as well. A good example is the attachment of the rotator cuff muscles to the blade of the scapula. In the teeth, Sharpey's fibres are the terminal ends of principal fibres (of the periodontal ligament) that insert into the cementum and into the periosteum of the alveolar bone. A study on rats suggests that the three-dimensional structure of Sharpey's fibres intensifies the continuity between the periodontal ligament fibre and the alveolar bone (tooth socket), and acts as a buffer medium against stress. Sharpey's fibres in the primary acellular cementum are mineralized fully; those in cellular cementum and bone are mineralized only partially at their periphery. In the skull the main function of Sharpey's fibres is to bind the cranial bones in a firm but moveable manner; they are most numerous in areas where the bones are subjected to the greatest forces of separation. In the spine, similar fibres join the intervertebral disc to the adjacent vertebrae. Each fibre is accompanied by an arteriole and one or more nerve fibres.

It is the birthplace of Sri Ramakrishna. It is the block headquarters of the Goghat -II community development block. ==GeographyLocation=== Kamarpukur is located at . ===Area overview=== The Arambagh subdivision, presented in the map alongside, is divided into two physiographic parts ‚Äì the Dwarakeswar River being the dividing line. The western part is upland and rocky ‚Äì it is extension of the terrain of neighbourng Bankura district. The eastern part is flat alluvial plain area. The railways, the roads and flood-control measures have had an impact on the area.The area is overwhelmingly rural with 94.77% of the population living in rural areas and 5.23% of the population living in urban areas. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. ===Around Kamarpukur=== A mile to the north of Kamarpukur, is situated the village of Bhursubo where a well-to-do person named Manik Raja lived. The renowned tanks of Sukhasayer and Hatisayer excavated by him as also the mango- grove now almost extinct in the nearby meadows, testify to some of his noteworthy acts. On the western border of Kamarpukur, the canal Bhutir-Khal flows in a zigzag course from the north to the south and joins the Amodar River at a little distance. Two cremation grounds called Budhui Moral and Bhutir-Khal lie on the north-east and north-west of the village respectively. Along the eastern border of the village a spacious road runs from Burdwan (32 miles from Kamarpukur) to Puri in Orissa. To the south-east are the ruins of Gar Mandaran and the ancient temple of Saileswara Shiva, which bear witness to the prosperous days of the Pathan rulers. About 30 miles to the east, is the temple of Tarakeswar Shiva, which is connected with Kamarpukur by a road running via Jahanabad (or Arambagh). Besides this, Ghatal (18 miles to the south) and Vishnupur (30 miles to the west) are joined with Kamarpukur by another road that abuts on the aforesaid road to Puri, after passing through the village via Kotulpur and Koalpara. Three miles to the west, is Jayrambati, the village in which the Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi was born.

A number of ponds, tanks and old buildings and dilapidated temples still bear witness to its old glory. In olden days Kamarpukur was surrounded by extensive fields, looked like an island floating in a vast sea of green. Apart from agriculture, it was noted for cottage industries also. Sweet-meats like jilapi and nabat, hookah pipes of ebony, yarns, towels, cloth, etc., were prepared here and sent out for sale to Kolkata and also to nearby markets. To this day, in the month of Chaitra (March--April), Kamarpukur reverberates with songs during the worship of Goddess Manasa and festival of Shiva, and in the following month, devotional choral songs of Hari are sung for three days at a stretch. Even now people belonging to the different strata of society live in peace in the tranquil atmosphere of the village. ===Ramakrishna=== The small house at Kamarpukur where Ramakrishna lived (centre). The family shrine is on the left, birthplace temple on the extreme right It was at Kamarpukur that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was born in 1836 in a poor brahmin family. With his advent and on account of the frequent visits of his disciples and devotees, this hamlet has become a place of pilgrimage. Thousands visit it every year from the various parts of the world and get spiritually refreshed and elevated. Through the help of the devotees and the management, and of the monks of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, the temple of Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna, with his marble statue installed in it, was built in 1951 at Kamarpukur. Later developments include the construction of guest houses, a library, a dispensary and schools and the re-excavation of the tank called Haldarpukur. Vishalakshi Temple - Situated at Anur, around 2 km from Kamarpukur, goddess Vishalakshi is a popular deity. People vow offerings to the goddess with the hope that the goddess will fulfil their desire. Not very long ago the goddess resided under the open sky at the place where the present temple is situated. Villagers were used to construct an ordinary leafy shed every year before the Makar Sankranti (Mid January) when a fair was organised. The tradition of the fair is being followed till today. One anecdote, associated with goddess Vishalakshi, states that Gadadhar (Sri Ramakrishna in his childhood) was accompanying a group of pious ladies in their way to offer worship to goddess Vishalakshi. When he was singing the glory of goddess Vishalakshi, suddenly his body became stiff and tears flowed down his cheeks. Seeing this ladies realised that it might be due to the mystic influence of the goddess on the simple hearted child. They immediately started praying to goddess Vishalakshi to save Gadadhar. Wonder! Gadadhar woke up with a brightened face.

In contrast to the original DST the TBM propagates the open-world assumption that relaxes the assumption that all possible outcomes are known. Under the open world assumption Dempster's rule of combination is adapted such that there is no normalization. The underlying idea is that the probability mass pertaining to the empty set is taken to indicate an unexpected outcome, e.g. the belief in a hypothesis outside the frame of discernment. This adaptation violates the probabilistic character of the original DST and also Bayesian inference. Therefore, the authors substituted notation such as probability masses and probability update with terms such as degrees of belief and transfer giving rise to the name of the method: The transferable belief model. ==Zadeh‚Äôs example in TBM context== Lofti Zadeh describes an information fusion problem.Zadeh, A., L., (1984) \\"Review of shafer's a mathematical theory of evidence\\". AI Magazine, 5(3). A patient has an illness that can be caused by three different factors A, B or C. Doctor 1 says that the patient's illness is very likely to be caused by A (very likely, meaning probability p = 0.95), but B is also possible but not likely (p = 0.05). Doctor 2 says that the cause is very likely C (p = 0.95), but B is also possible but not likely (p = 0.05). How is one to make one's own opinion from this? Bayesian updating the first opinion with the second (or the other way round) implies certainty that the cause is B. Dempster's rule of combination lead to the same result. This can be seen as paradoxical, since although the two doctors point at different causes, A and C, they both agree that B is not likely. (For this reason the standard Bayesian approach is to adopt Cromwell's rule and avoid the use of 0 or 1 as probabilities.) ==Formal definition== The TBM describes beliefs at two levels: # a credal level where beliefs are entertained and quantified by belief functions, # a pignistic level where beliefs can be used to make decisions and are quantified by probability functions. === Credal level === According to the DST, a probability mass function m is defined such that: :m: 2^X \\\\rightarrow [0,1] \\\\,\\\\\\\\! with :\\\\sum_{A \\\\in 2^X} m(A) = 1 \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where the power set 2^X contains all possible subsets of the frame of discernment X. In contrast to the DST the mass m allocated to the empty set \\\\emptyset is not required to be zero, and hence generally 0 \\\\leq m(\\\\emptyset) \\\\leq 1.0 holds true. The underlying idea is that the frame of discernment is not necessarily exhaustive, and thus belief allocated to a proposition A \\\\in 2^X, is in fact allocated to A \\\\in 2^X\\\\cup{e} where {e} is the set of unknown outcomes. Consequently, the combination rule underlying the TBM corresponds to Dempster's rule of combination, except the normalization that grants m(\\\\emptyset)=0.

Hence, probability masses m(A) are equally distributed among the atoms of A. This strategy corresponds to the principle of insufficient reason (also denoted as principle of maximum entropy) according to which an unknown distribution most probably corresponds to a uniform distribution. In the TBM pignistic probability functions are described by functions P_\\\\text{Bet}.

Philip Smets introduced them as pignistic to stress the fact that those probability functions are based on incomplete data, whose only purpose is a forced decision, e.g. to place a bet. This is in contrast to the credal beliefs described above, whose purpose is representing the actual belief. ==Open world example== When tossing a coin one usually assumes that Head or Tail will occur, so that \\\\Pr(\\\\text{Head}) + \\\\Pr(\\\\text{Tail}) = 1. The open-world assumption is that the coin can be stolen in mid-air, disappear, break apart or otherwise fall sideways so that neither Head nor Tail occurs, so that the power set of {Head,Tail} is considered and there is a decomposition of the overall probability (i.e. 1) of the following form: : \\\\Pr(\\\\emptyset) + \\\\Pr(\\\\text{Head}) + \\\\Pr(\\\\text{Tail}) + \\\\Pr(\\\\text{Head,Tail}) = 1. ==See also== * Dempster‚ÄìShafer theory == Notes References== *Smets Ph.

It was composed in 1885 in Maidanovo, Russia. The libretto was written by Yakov Polonsky, and is based on the story \\"Christmas Eve\\", part of a collection called Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka, by Nikolai Gogol. The opera is a revision of Tchaikovsky's earlier opera Vakula the Smith. The work was first performed in 1887 in Moscow. ==Composition history== Nikolay Gogol (1809‚Äì1852) The opera was composed between February and April 1885 at Maidanovo. Both Vakula the Smith and Cherevichki were set to Polonsky's libretto, which was originally intended for Alexander Serov, but had remained unused on account of his death. Additions and revisions for this second version were made by the composer and Nikolay Chayev. The main thematic material of the second version of the opera is the same as in Vakula the Smith. The alterations were caused by a wish to help the opera \\"out of the river of oblivion\\" (letter by Tchaikovsky of 4 March 1885). The editing primarily simplified some elements of musical texture. The lyric sphere of the opera was deepened by the introduction of a new aria inserted for Vakula: ... (Who knows, my girl, if your heart can feel my pain...). But the addition of the song of the School Teacher and the verses of His Highness enrich the genre part of the opera. Tchaikovsky also changed the cast of the chorus scenes, as in No. 13 (Kolyadka). ==Performance history== The premiere was given on 31 January 1887 [OS January 19] at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow conducted by Tchaikovsky (it was his debut as a conductor) with stage direction by A. I. Bartsal and scenic design by K. F. Valts. During the 20th century the opera was performed very rarely, revived almost exclusively within Russia and the USSR. It received its Polish premiere in the Baltic Opera House in Gda≈Ñsk on 28 June 1952.The list of premieres at Baltic Opera House Wexford Festival Opera presented five performances of a new production in October 1993.

The Devil is annoyed with Solokha's son Vakula who painted an icon mocking him. The Devil decides to create a snowstorm to prevent Vakula from seeing his beloved Oxana. While the storm rages, Solokha rides up to the sky and steals the moon, while Oxana's father Chub and the Deacon are unable to find their way. Oxana is alone and lonely at home. She passes through several moods and the music follows her with gradually accelerating tempos. At one point, Vakula enters and watches her admiring herself. She teases him, and he says he loves her. Chub comes back out of the storm, and Vakula, not recognizing him, chases him out by striking him. Seeing what he has done, Oxana sends Vakula away in a miserable state. Young people from the village come around singing Ukrainian Christmas carols. Oxana realizes she still loves Vakula. ===Act 2=== In a peculiar and amusing first scene three men and the Devil wind up in three sacks at Solokha's hut after successively trying to seduce her, and Vakula winds up hauling the heavy sacks away. Outside three groups of carollers contend. Oxana shames Vakula into getting her the Tsaritsa's boots or else she won't marry him. He runs threatening suicide, leaving two bags which turn out to have the Deacon and Chub. ===Act 3=== A forest sprite warns water nymphs that Vakula is coming and that he wants to commit suicide. The Devil jumps out of Vakula's sack and tries to get his soul in exchange for Oxana but Vakula instead climbs on the Devil's back. Vakula forces the Devil to take him to St. Petersburg. The Devil puts down Vakula in the tsaritsa's court and disappears into the fireplace. Vakula joins a group of cossacks who are going to see the tsaritsa. In the hall of columns, a chorus sings the tsaritsa's praises, a polonaise. Vakula requests the tsaritsa's boots in a minuet, and it is granted because it is an unusual and amusing thing to ask. The Devil takes Vakula away as Russian and Cossack dances commence. ===Act 4=== The Act opens in the town square on a bright Christmas morning. Solokha and Oxana think Vakula has drowned himself, and mourn for him. Oxana runs off weeping when villagers invite her to the Christmas feast. Vakula returns with the boots, asks Chub to forgive him for the beating and asks for Oxana's hand in marriage. She enters, tells Vakula that she wants him, not the silly boots. Chub calls for the kobzari (the lutenists), and everyone celebrates. ==Structure== :Overture Act 1 Scene 1 :No. 1 Scene and Duet (Solokha, Devil) :No. 2 Snowstorm Scene 2 :No. 3 Aria (Oksana) :No. 4 Scene and Arioso (Oksana, Vakula) :No. 5 Scene (Oksana, Chub, Vakula) :No. 6 Scene and Duet (Vakula, Oksana) :No. 7 Final Scene (Oksana, Vakula, Choir) Act 2 Scene 1 :Entr‚Äôacte :No. 8 Scene (Solokha, Devil) :No. 9 Scene (Pan Golova, Solokha) :No. 10 Scene (Deacon, Solokha) :No. 11 Scene and Quintet (Chub, Solokha, Vakula, Deacon, Devil) :No. 12 Arioso (Vakula) Scene 2 :No. 13 Choral Scene :No. 14 Scene and Cherevichki Song :No. 15 Finale (Oksana, Vakula, Chub, Choir) Act 3 Scene 1 :Entr‚Äôacte :No. 16 Chorus of Rusalkas :No. 17 Scene and Vakula's Song (Vakula, Devil) Scene 2 :No. 18 Scene (Devil, Vakula, an Old Zaporozhian Cossack, Choir) Scene 3 :No. 19 Polonaise (Vakula, Master of Ceremonies, His Highness, Choir) :No. 20 Couplets (His Highness, Choir) :No. 21 Minuet and Scene (Vakula, Catherine II, His Highness, Choir) :No. 22 Russian dance and Cossack dance :No. 23 Scene (Master of Ceremonies, Devil, Vakula Act 4 :No. 24 Duet (Solokha, Oksana) :No. 25 Finale (Oksana, Chub, Pan Golova, Panas, Solokha, Vakula, Choir) ==Related works== *Tchaikovsky: The opera Vakula the Smith (1874) *Rimsky-Korsakov: The opera Christmas Eve (1895) Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve, Tchaikovsky's Vakula the Smith, and its revision, Cherevichki, are all based on the same story by Gogol. ==Recordings== Image:Cherevichki-Album cover Melik-Pashayev.jpg1948 Bolshoy Theatre Image:Cherevichki-Album cover.jpg2000 Cagliari Lyric Theatre *1948, Aleksandr Melik-Pashayev, Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra and Chorus, G.

The remaining episodes aired over the non-ratings period in 2006‚Äì2007, with the final episode airing on 16 January 2007. Hosted by Mark Beretta, the show had a potential prize of $1,000,000. It was produced by Grant Rule and Seven Melbourne. ==Format== Five players fought out a series of rounds involving general knowledge questions. This was both against each other and the clock, all under the eyes of the Master - Martin Flood - who sat in a chair watching to find the contestants' weaknesses. The player who won earned the right to face the Master for his title and for the prize of $1,000,000. The five played against each other in a series of general knowledge rounds, winning $100 for each correct answer in general knowledge rounds and $200 in \\"Master's Choice\\" rounds (where Flood chose the category). Each round lasted for 90 seconds. If a contestant answered incorrectly, he or she was locked out from answering the next question. Players with the lowest score were gradually eliminated until three remained. If at the end of a round, two contestants were on the same score, the Master would choose which contestant to eliminate. After two contestants have been eliminated, there is a round where the three remaining contestants were each subjected to a round of questions on their \\"preferred category\\" called the \\"mean minute\\". In this round, correct answers worth $100 and incorrect answers result in a deduction of $200. After the \\"mean minute\\" round there is another general knowledge round and the contestant with the highest score at the end of that final round won the right to play against the Master. Each eliminated contestant took home what he or she earned in the general knowledge rounds. The winner was given $50,000 to \\"bet\\" on their best- of-five questions game with the Master. The contestant could bet either $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 or the entire $50,000. If the contestant risked any amount below $50,000, the Master will choose the category of questions to be asked and if the contestant is successful they would win ten times the amount staked. If the contestant bet the entire $50,000 they selected the category of questions and played for $1,000,000 and the chance to become the new Master. If they, however, risked the entire $50,000 and failed, they also lost all the money they had won in the previous rounds, walking away empty-handed. This meant that if a contestant risked less than $50,000, they played for either $100,000, $200,000, $300,000, or $400,000. ==Ratings== Seven boss David Leckie ordered it off air when it rated just 744,000 capital city viewers.

At the time the election of Eugene was being challenged by Zinzinnus, the candidate of the Roman populace. Eugene agreed to several concessions to imperial power in central Italy in return for receiving the military and juridical support of Lothair. The Constitutio was divided into nine articles.It can be founded edited by A. Boretius in Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Capitularia regnum Francorum, I, no. 161, 322‚Äì324. It introduced the earliest known Papal Oath, which the Pope-elect was to give to an imperial legate before receiving consecration. It also restored the custom established by Pope Stephen III in 769 whereby both the laity and clergy of Rome would participate in Papal elections. There has been some debate between modern scholars whether the Constitutio was a \\"dead letter\\" with little practical impact, or marked a stage of the road to imperial domination of the Papacy.Marios Costambeys, Power and Patronage in Early Medieval Italy (Cambridge: 2007), 342‚Äì343. ==Contents== The constitution advanced the imperial pretensions in the city of Rome, but also established a system to check the power of the nobles. It decreed that those who were under the special protection of the pope or emperor were to be inviolable, and that proper obedience be rendered to the pope and his officials; that church property was not to be plundered after the death of a pope; that only those to whom the right had been given by the deceased Pope Stephen III, in 769, should take part in papal elections; that two commissioners were to be appointed, one by the pope and the other by the emperor, who should report to them how justice was administered, so that any failure in the administration might be corrected by the pope, or, in the event of his not doing so, by the emperor; that the people should be judged according to the relevant law (Roman, Salic, or Lombard) under which they had elected to live; that the Church's property be restored to it; that robbery with violence be put down; that when the emperor was in Rome the chief officials should appear before him to be admonished to do their duty; and, finally, that all must obey the Roman pontiff. By command of the pope and Lothair, the people had to swear that, saving the fidelity they had promised the pope, they would obey the Emperors Louis and Lothair; would not allow a papal election to be made contrary to the canons; and would not suffer the pope-elect to be consecrated save in the presence of the emperor's envoys and an oath of homage from the newly elected Pope. ==Revocation== Sixty years later, the Constitutio Romana was temporarily revoked by Pope Marinus I when he issued a decree stating that the emperors would not interfere, either directly or through their ambassadors, in the election of a pope. However, in 962, many of the clauses of the Constitutio Romana were reintroduced into the Diploma Ottonianum.Mann, Horace K., The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages, Vol. IV: The Popes in the Days of Feudal Anarchy, 891‚Äì999 (1910), p. 252 ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Bertolini, Ottorino. \\"Osservazioni sulla Constitutio Romana e sull Sacramentum Cleri et Populi Romani dell'anno 824.\\" Studi medievali in onore di Antonino de Stefano.

It is based upon the first part of the Icelandic \\"Volsunga Saga\\". It received positive reviews from The Guardian, Kirkus Reviews, and Publishers Weekly, and was followed in 2007 by a sequel, Bloodsong. ==Plot introduction== This is the first in the series of two novels based in this universe. The book deals with two warring gangs, named the Volsons and the Connors. Each controls a large portion of London, since the city was blockaded from the outside world. Val, head of the Volsons, wishes for peace between the two and offers his daughter Signy as Conor's wife in order to broker a treaty. His hopes are to unite London and destroy the half-men who occupy the outer rim of London. Once they have been destroyed, he wishes to rise up against the rest of the world and claim it all in the name of the Volson clan. Standing between these dreams are humans, half-men and even the almighty Gods themselves, who have recently begun to reappear throughout the world. The book is difficult to categorize, with much of it dealing with sci-fi, fantasy, philosophical and even religious elements. ==Plot summary== This story takes place in the future, where London is a wasteland where two clans war. The two main characters of this story are twins Siggy and Signy. They are the children of Val Volson, leader of the largest territory that was once London. Val wishes for peace and believes the only way to do so is to unite London under one ruler. He offers his daughter Signy as Conor's wife, in order to show his complete commitment to the Treaty. Conor agrees and shows his trust, by visiting the Volson's territory. The visit goes as planned until a banquet is interrupted by an unusual guest. A believed spy, who was strung up by his ankle returns to life and shows it was not a one time trick, as he crashes down head first from thirty or so feet up. After returning to life for the second time he walks up and down the hall. He acknowledges only Siggy and Signy, before plunging a knife deep into a believed to be unbreakable substance. All others try, but no matter how hard they pull, the knife remains within the wall. But one person knows he is the chosen one. Siggy (who wishes for anything but the responsibility of leadership) removes the knife with ease, as his father acknowledges that it was a gift from Odin himself, blessing the treaty in his own way. Conor wishes to have the knife himself and asks Siggy, claiming that as the guest of honour he is entitled. But Siggy refuses, even going so far as to plunge it into wood. But Conor cannot remove it and laughs it off, before leaving with Signy. Signy is disappointed with Siggy for not giving the knife to Conor and heads to Conor's territory annoyed at her brother. Conor and Signy are very happy together, and everything seems to be perfect. Although she is disappointed at being kept in a tower (which Conor assures her is for her own protection), she is still happy because she loves Conor. During a half-man hunt, Signy makes a shocking discovery. The half-men are not what they are reputed to be. After being cornered by a hyena-man, she is informed that Conor wishes to kill her family and claim London for his own. The hyena-man surprises her further by giving her a kitten named Cherry (who is said to have more than one shape), before leaping to the ground and meeting his end by Conor's convoy. After over a year within Conor's territory, her family come to visit. They come (as expected) heavily armed but are caught off guard by Conor's surprise attack. He has betrayed them. Val is killed and the three brothers are forced to surrender. The Volsons are taken to Conor's lair, being disrespected by the guards and townspeople as they go. After a few days of torture, Conor has them left out to die in the half-men lands. Their fate is to be dinner of a berserk pig who roams nearby. First Hadrian is eaten, then Ben. Before long only Siggy remains. Siggy wishes for death, but knows somehow that it is not to be. Signy (following being hamstrung under Conor's orders) discovers that her kitten Cherry is a shapeshifter. She informs her master that Siggy is still alive and in the hopes of pleasing Signy, rushes to his aide. Cherry helps him escape from the pig, before ensuring he is found by Melanie (another pig-woman). Melanie originally intends to sell him as a slave or at worst eat him. But she quickly begins to like Siggy and decides to help him recuperate. She helps his wounds heal and assists in his convalescence. Before long Siggy is back to normal and has struck up a deep friendship with Melanie. Signy has become bitter and twisted and begins to think of nothing but her revenge against Conor. Signy realizes that Conor desperately wants her to have a baby, but she does not want it to be his. Instead, Signy changes shapes with Cherry. She changes into a bird and goes to meet Siggy. She seduces him and has him bear her a child unknowingly. When Signy has the baby, she pretends to have it kidnapped and lets rebel troops clone it. The original baby is named Victor, and the cloned one is named Styr. The cloned one is given special features, making it stronger, faster, and designed for war. == Reviews == Julie Eccleshare, writing in The Guardian, gave the novel a positive review. She wrote that \\"Melvin Burgess is shocking, and deliberately so, in his descriptions of stomach-turning cruelty, but his carefully constructed retelling of the Nordic Volsunga saga is rich enough in other ways to carry it.\\" Kirkus Reviews summarized its review by saying that the novel was \\"relentlessly inventive\\". Publishers Weekly also wrote positively, \\"Given such a gory framework, Burgess's development of sympathetic characters is as surprising as it is convincing. Rapidly shifting perspectives and deft dialogue expose minds as frighteningly real as growly gangsta rap and as unexpectedly compassionate as unconditional animal love, pivoting on Old Norse gods‚Äîor are they constructs of genetic breeding tanks?‚Äîwho watch but cannot change the weaving of human fate.\\" == Stage adaptation == The novel was adapted for the stage by Marcus Romer for Pilot Theatre in 2004. Writing in The Guardian, Albert Hinkling gave the production a negative review, writing that \\"Romer's adaptation is pretty starved of poetry, and what there is has mostly been transplanted from Macbeth. Pilot can usually be relied on to provide edgy, aggressive and innovative work, but ultimately, Bloodtide is a great deal of sound and fury signifying nothing.\\" ==Sequel== Bloodsong (2007) is the sequel to Bloodtide. Kathryn Hughes of The Guardian gave the book a positive review, writing \\"By rights none of this should really work as narrative prose, sounding instead more like the jumbled backstory to a particularly complicated computer game. But Burgess has imagined his future world so precisely ... that Bloodsong reads like the most reasonable of realistic fiction.\\" == References == Category:1999 British novels Category:1999 fantasy novels Category:Post-apocalyptic novels Category:Young adult fantasy novels Category:British young adult novels Category:Novels by Melvin Burgess Category:Novels set in London Category:V√∂lsung cycle Category:Andersen Press books ","title":"Bloodtide (novel)"},{"id":"6226224","text":"\\"My Sugar Cat\\" is Mika Nakashima's 19th single.

It is located in the Southern Alps and a pass in the Harper River headwaters leads into the Waimakariri River catchment. One of the most popular tramping routes in Canterbury enters the East Harper via Cass Saddle and exits via Lagoon Saddle at the head of the West Harper. The waters of the Harper River and its major tributary, the Avoca River, are channelled into Lake Coleridge via a structure known as the Harper Diversion which was constructed in 1921 as part of a hydroelectricity project. The Harper Avoca catchment has been the site of much ecological research since the mid-1950s. It is well serviced by huts on Lagoon and Cass Saddles, the West Harper, Hamilton Hut at the junction of the two branches of the Harper, Avoca Hut in the headwaters of the Avoca, two huts at Back Basins Creek, a small two man hut up Back Basins Creek and a larger hut that can be rented off Glenthorne Station near the junction of the Avoca and Harper Rivers.

The thirteen-foot-tall figure is of a partly clad male figure with arms outstretched standing on a square base. The base is flanked by a square exedra, created by Henry Bacon, that encloses a small raised platform. The statue was erected by the Women's Titanic Memorial Association. The memorial sits at Fourth and P streets, SW, in Washington Channel Park next to the Washington Channel and Fort Lesley J. McNair. It was designed by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who won the commission in open competition, and sculpted by John Horrigan from a single piece of red granite furnished from Westerly, Rhode Island, by the Henry C. Smalley Granite Co. It was unveiled May 26, 1931, by Helen Herron Taft, the widow of President Taft. Originally located at the foot of New Hampshire Avenue, NW in Rock Creek Park along the Potomac River, the monument was removed in 1966 and placed into temporary storage to accommodate the Kennedy Center. The memorial was re- erected without ceremony in 1968 at its current location.

For a small fee they provide an informal means for Ghanaians to securely save and access their own money, and gain some limited access to credit, a form of microfinance. Money looked after for an individual by a Susu collector is held in a Susu account. The sus informal accounts used in the Caribbean and among West Indian immigrants to the United States are similar. ==History== In the Akan language susu means \\"plan\\". In this context, planning with a group of people to save a certain amount of money. The concept is also known in Jamaica as Paadna Money(Partner Money) or simply as Paadna. The 1990s saw significant growth in the number of clients per susu collector in other African countries, and growth in the size of individual deposits, according to Aryeetey and Udry (1995).Aryeetey, Ernest and Udry, Christopher.\\"The Characteristics of Informal Financial Markets in Africa\\" October, 1995. Today, Susu collectors provide many Ghanaians who would otherwise be denied credit with access to money they need to start up small venture projects that in many cases benefit the community as a whole. ==Banking sector== According to the Overseas Development Institute,\\"Linking formal and informal financial intermediaries in Ghana\\", Overseas Development Institute November 2000. Retrieved on January 9 2015. the banking sector in Ghana is made up of the central bank, eight commercial banks, three development banks, three merchant banks and 133 rural banks. With the exception of the rural banks, their distribution is weighted towards urban areas, and towards the south. Seven out of the thirteen districts in the Northern Region have no banks and the ratio of clients to banks in northern Ghana is much higher (100,000:1) than in the country as a whole (16,000-26,000:1). The semi-formal financial sector in Ghana includes Credit Unions, Savings and Credit Co-operatives and a number of NGOs. Informal financial agents include: moneylenders; susu collectors (savings mobilisers); traders, agricultural processors and input distributors; susu groups/ROSCAs (Rotating Savings and Credit Associations), and friends and relatives. Susu collectors are represented by an apex organisation, with whom 850 are registered, though it is estimated another 150 unregistered collectors operate in the North. Whereas banks in Ghana offer high-value, long-term loans, Susu collectors can offer low-value advances or credit in the short term (usually less than a month) that is interest free. If larger sums are required, and they know the client personally, they can offer credit at higher rates than the banks, but without collateral to secure the loan. The Ghana Co-operative Susu Collectors Association (GCSCA) established in 1990, has been trying to mobilize, organize, and regulate the operations of Susu collectors whose activities are sometimes fraudulent. Some Third World charities such as Action Aid, work closely with Susu collectors, using them to efficiently distribute financial information and loans funded by the charity. ==Operation== Susu collectors usually run their businesses from kiosks located in the market place and act as mobile bankers. Otherwise they can often be recognized by their distinctive coats with many pockets. Deposits, often of low but regular value, are usually taken on a daily basis over the course of a month. At the end of this period the susu collector returns the accumulated savings to the client but keeps one day's savings as commission. Susu collectors may also provide advances to their clients. ==Susu collectors vs. mutual Susu== The word susu is also used in reference to rotating savings and credit associations in Ghana and the Caribbean. K. Little's 1957 article in American Anthropology, as well as the book Traditional Peoples of the World by National Geographic describes susu groups in this context. Both Aryeetey and Gockel (1991) and Little (1957) are cited by Ellen Bortei-Doku and Ernest Aryeetey in Chapter 5 of the 1995 edited volume, Money-go-rounds. ==References* Category:Microfinance in Africa Category:Rotating savings and credit association Category:Informal economy in Africa Category:Financial services in Ghana ","title":"Susu collectors"},{"id":"6226288","text":"The Roman Catholic Bona Mors Confraternity (Bona Mors is Latin for \\"Happy Death\\") was founded 2 October, 1648, in the Church of the Gesu, Rome, by Father Vincent Carrafa, seventh General of the Society of Jesus, and approved by the Popes Innocent X and Alexander VII.Bona Mors Confraternity - Catholic Encyclopedia article In 1729 it was raised to an archconfraternity and enriched with numerous indulgences by Benedict XIII. He authorized the father general of the Society of Jesus, who in virtue of his office, was the director, to erect confraternities in all churches of the Jesuit order. In 1827 Leo XII gave to the director general the power to erect and affiliate branch confraternities in churches not belonging to the Society of Jesus, and to give them a share in all the privileges and indulgences of the archconfraternity. The object of the association is to prepare its members by a well-regulated life to die in peace with God. The longer title: \\"Confraternity of Our Lord Jesus Christ dying on the Cross, and of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, his sorrowful Mother,\\" expresses the chief means to attain that end: devotion to the passion of Christ, and to the sorrows of Mary. Besides this union of prayers and good works of the associates and the special instructions at the public meetings help powerfully to prepare for a 'happy death '. The conditions for membership are to present oneself to the director; to express to him one's desire to become a member; to receive from him an outward sign of acceptance, usually in the form of a certificate of admission; and to have one's name registered in the local Bona Mors register.

His father, August Burgm√ºller, was the director of a theatre. His mother, Therese von Zandt, was a singer and piano teacher. He had two brothers, Franz and Friedrich. Friedrich was also a composer. After the death of their father, the family had financial troubles. They were given support from Count . Burgm√ºller studied with Joseph Kreutzer in D√ºsseldorf, and Louis Spohr and Spohr's pupil Moritz Hauptmann in Kassel. After his study he became their piano teacher. He became engaged to Sophia Roland, but in 1830 the relationship ended, to Norbert's distress. He became epileptic and began to drink excessively. In the same year he returned to D√ºsseldorf to live with his mother. There he befriended Felix Mendelssohn. He became engaged to Josephine Collin, but this relationship ended too. After Mendelssohn left for Leipzig in 1835, Burgm√ºller made plans to leave for Paris, where his brother Friedrich had gone. In 1836 he went to a spa in Aachen, where he drowned during an epileptic seizure. Robert Schumann, who arranged for the posthumous publication of Burgm√ºller's two symphonies, and completed the orchestration of the scherzo of the unfinished Symphony No. 2, wrote in a memorial notice that no death was more deplorable than that of Norbert Burgm√ºller since the early death of Franz Schubert.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. 1954, Eric Blom, ed. ==Works== The opus numbers do not correspond with the order of composition. ===Orchestral works=== * Piano Concerto in F-Sharp Minor, Op 1 (1829) * Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 2 (1831‚Äì33) * Symphony No. 2 in D major, Op. 11 (1834/35, unfinished - the third part of this symphony, Scherzo, was completed by Robert Schumann: there is no Finale). * Ouvert√ºre in F minor, Op. 5 (1825) * 4 Entr'actes ===Vocal works=== * \\"Dionys\\", Opera after Schiller's Ballad \\"Die B√ºrgschaft\\" (1832/34, Fragment) * 6 Songs, Op. 3 (pub. 1838) * 5 Songs, Op. 6 (pub. 1839) * 5 Songs, Op. 10 (pub. 1840) * 5 Songs, Op. 12 (pub. 1864) * Fr√ºhlingslied in G major (pub. 1840) * Morgenlied in E flat major (1834, Fragment) ===Chamber music=== * String Quartet No. 1 in D minor, Op. 4 (1825) * String Quartet No. 2 in D minor, Op. 7 (1825/26) * String Quartet No. 3 in A flat major, Op. 9 (1826) * String Quartet No. 4 in A minor, Op. 14 (1835) * St√§ndchen in E flat major for clarinet (or cello), viola and guitar (1825) * Duo in E flat major for clarinet and piano, Op. 15 (1834) ===Piano music=== * Sonata in F minor, Op. 8 (1826) * Waltz in E flat major (1827) * Mazurka in E flat major * Polonaise in F major, Op. 16 (1832) * Rhapsody in B minor, Op. 13 (1834) ===Lost works=== * Instrumentation of Karl Blum's Quodlibet \\"Die Wiener in Berlin\\" (1827) * Psalm 117 (1828) * Song: In des Irrtisch weisse Fluten (1831) * Male chorus for the \\"Epilog to Goethe's funeral eulogy\\" (1832) * Incidental Music to \\"Albrecht D√ºrer's Dream\\" (1833) * Festival chorus for the All-Highest Birthday Celebration of His Majesty (1834) * Easter Cantata (1836) ==Recordings== * Carus 83.226: Symphonies Nos. 1 & 2\\\\.

Bishnupur and Arambag are twenty-seven miles and twelve miles distant respectively from Joyrambati. The village, surrounded on all sides by green pastures, untrimmed meadows, trees and shrubs, has a rural atmosphere. The area that extends for about half a mile between this village and the Amodar is very fertile and yields all kinds of vegetables and other agricultural products. ===Area overview=== The map alongside shows the Bishnupur subdivision of Bankura district. Physiographically, this area has fertile low lying alluvial plains.It is a predominantly rural area with 90.06% of the population living in rural areas and only 8.94% living in the urban areas.It was a part of the core area of Mallabhum.O'Malley, L.S.S., ICS, Bankura, Bengal District Gazetteers, pp. 21‚Äì46, 1995 reprint, first published 1908, Government of West Bengal Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. ==HistoryPeace and prosperity=== After the birth of Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, who is worshipped as Holy Mother, the spiritual consort of Sri Ramakrishna, the village began to show signs of prosperity which was not so much in evidence before her advent. The main source of irrigation of the nearby cultivable lands is the big lake called 'Aher' or'Mother's Tank' or 'Mayer Dighi'; where the visitors and the village-folks take their bath and get refreshed. It is said that the Holy Mother in her girlhood used to cut grass for cows in neck- deep water from this very tank. At present water is supplied to this reservoir from the river Amodar by means of an electric pump and is used for the irrigation of the surrounding fields. There is another tank called 'Barujjey Pukur' (i.e. Banerji's tank) which lies on the south-eastern corner of this village and is surrounded with palmyra trees. ===Birth place of Sri Sarada Devi=== Sri Sarada Devi was born in this village in 1853. This village with its sacred traditions has become a holy place of pilgrimage, particularly among followers of Sri Ramakrishna. On one occasion, the Holy Mother, after touching the dust of this place with her forehead, remarked, One's own mother and the land of birth are even far superior to Heaven. ===Communication=== Joyrambati can be reached from different directions such as [1] From Howrah by train up to Arambagh or Goghat Railway station and then by bus or car [2] From Kharagpur by bus via Kamarpukur [3] From Bishnupur by bus via Kotulpur or via Bakadah. One can also come by road directly from Kolkata-Arambagh-Joyrambati. Buses are available from Esplanade to Bishnupur via Joyrambati in its route. ===Temples=== The main temple of this village belongs to Ramakrishna Math and Mission, Belur Math, and named as \\"SRI SRI MATRI MANDIR\\" dedicated to Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, the spiritual consort of Sri Ramakrishna. The temple was constructed on the birthplace of Ma Sarada Devi. The deity in the Sri Sri Matri Mandir is positioned exactly on the spot where Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi was born on 22 December 1853. The Holy Mother's Temple is consecrated on 19 April 1923 by Saradananda Swami on Akshay Tritiya day and he placed Holy Mother's oil paintings in the temple which was replaced by a white marble statue of Holy Mother in April 1954. The village hosts another temple of Vivekananda monks and the orphanage school for boys that the monks operate. The school hosts around 250 boys, providing them with an education through junior high. There is a temple called \\"Naranarayan Temple\\" where a child of below 5 years of age is worshipped as \\"God Narayan\\" at 10:00 A.M daily. This is a unique experiment started by Swami Nityanandaji Maharaj of Vivekananda Math to manifest the saying of \\"Shiva in Jiva\\". The offerings in this puja are unusual which suits the need of a child like, a pair of shirt and trouser, toys, books, pen and pencil, etc. In nearby Shihar village there is an old temple dedicated to Shantinath Shiva. Both Sri Ramakrishna and the Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi visited this temple. A grand fair is organized on the last of day of chaitra (Bengali Calendar)on the occasion of Gajan. ==Jayrambati picture gallery== File:Sri Sri Matri Mandir, Joyrambati.jpgSri Sri Matri Mandir, Joyrambati File:Sri_Sri_Maa_Sarada_Devi.jpgSri Sri Maa Sarada Devi File:Sri_Sri_Maa_Sarada_Devi_2.jpgSri Sri Maa Sarada Devi File:Holy Mothers Shayan Kaksh (Bedroom).jpgHoly Mothers Shayan Kaksh (Bedroom) File:Holy_Mothers_Old_House,_Joyrambati.jpgHoly Mothers Old House, Joyrambati File:Sri_Sri_Matri_Mandir_Joyrambati_Temple_peak.jpgSri Sri Matri Mandir Joyrambati Temple peak File:Naranarayan Temple.jpgNaranarayan Temple at Joyrambati File:Mangal_Arati_in_the_temple.jpgSandhya Arati in the temple File:Shantinath Temple.JPGShantinath Temple at Shihar ==Education== Ramakrishna Mission Sarada Vidyapith is a Bengali-medium coeducational institution established in 1910.

During his lifetime he was considered the foremost academic authority on the Chinookan people of the middle Columbia River, especially the Wasco-Wishram Chinooks of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in Oregon. His research focused on ethnobotany and language. ==Education== French attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, for three years (1935-1939), studying under Morris Opler. When Opler moved to Pomona College and the Claremont Graduate School, French transferred there to continue studying with him and completed his B.A. there in 1939. (He was later made an honorary alumnus of Reed.) He earned an M.A. at Claremont as well, in 1940. Around this time he did archaeological work in Oregon under Luther S. Cressman. French's Ph.D. work at Columbia University involved studying under Ralph Linton and Ruth Benedict (he was Benedict's research assistant). He was heavily influenced by the milieu surrounding Franz Boas, who died while French was at Columbia. Later in life French always considered himself a \\"Boasian,\\" an approach characterized by meticulous and thorough anthropological research in the \\"recovery ethnography\\" mode, as well as a preference for conducting linguistic and ethnographic research in tandem. He did dissertation fieldwork at Isleta Pueblo in the Southwest (1941-1942). His dissertation on factionalism at Isleta Pueblo was defended in 1943, but he did not receive his Ph.D. until 1949. ==Family and career== In 1943 French married Kathrine Story (1922-2006), whom he had met at Pomona and who was also pursuing a Ph.D. at Columbia. From 1943 to 1946, the Frenches served as relocation advisers and community analysts with the War Relocation Authority, monitoring conditions at relocation centers for Japanese-Americans, as part of a program to mitigate abuses. ===Teaching=== French taught at Reed from 1947 until his retirement in 1988 and he presided over the establishment of Anthropology as a separate department there. Given that French's father, Delbert R. French, was a member of Reed's first graduating class (1915) (French co-founded the informal children-of-alumni group, Offspring of Reed Graduates of yesteryear, or ORGY) and that French remained involved with the Reed community (living across the street from campus) until his death, he may indeed have had a longer association with Reed College than anyone else before or since. He also held visiting positions at Columbia University (1954-1955), the University of Washington (1959), and Harvard University (1960-1961). In 1949, David and Kathrine French began a decades-long research involvement with the Warm Springs people. Their many contributions to Warm Springs ethnography included an exhaustive ethnobotanical inventory, numerous published articles on topics such as oral narrative and the relationship between language and culture, and a still unpublished dictionary of Wasco-Wishram (Kiksht). In the mid 1960s French facilitated the inaugural fieldwork, on Chinookan, of a young Michael Silverstein, who was later to become a leading linguist and semiotician. The Frenches' ethnobotanical research also included fieldwork among peasants of France's Massif Central in the 1960s, accompanied by Claude L√©vi-Strauss. ==Research== Among French's unique contributions were the inclusion in ethnobotanical surveys of which plants were not named, and, in a 1955 article, \\"The Concept of Culture-Bondage,\\" an exploration of the relationship between culture and individuality which, in true Reed form, anticipated many of the concerns and ideals of the counterculture. But his most significant publications remain a long 1961 article on culture change at Warm Springs (a monograph-length ethnographic sketch, in many ways) and several definitive articles co-authored for the Smithsonian Institution's Handbook of North American Indians, namely contributions on Plateau subsistence, naming practices, and the Wasco-Wishram-Cascades peoples. At one point he was the Reed faculty member with the most numerous publications to his credit. Many of French's students pursued careers in anthropology or allied fields. The most prominent of these were probably Dell Hymes (anthropologist and linguist, whose research also focuses on Chinookans) and Hymes's friend the Beat Generation poet Gary Snyder. Snyder's Reed B.A. thesis (1951) was later published as a book, He Who Hunted Birds in His Father's Village: The Dimensions of a Haida Myth (1979), and it is largely thanks to French that American Indian themes and concerns with folklore and language use have enriched nearly all of Snyder's work. Snyder dedicated his book Myths and Texts to French. Other students of French's included Gail M. Kelly, May Ebihara, Katherine Verdery, Robert A. Brightman, and Robert E. Moore. In 1988 French received the American Anthropological Association's prestigious Distinguished Service Award, his discipline's highest honor. ==Death== French died February 12, 1994, in Portland, Oregon. ==Selected works== * (1955) \\"The Concept of Culture-Bondage.\\" New York Academy of Sciences, Transactions, Series II, vol. 17, no. 4, pp. 339‚Äì345. * (1958) \\"Cultural Matrices of Chinookan Non-Casual Language.\\" International Journal of American Linguistics, vol. 24, pp. 258‚Äì263. * (1961) \\"Wasco-Wishram.\\" In: Perspectives in American Indian Culture Change, edited by Edward H.

He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the seventh round of the 2004 NFL Draft. He played college football at Tennessee. Jones was also a member of the New York Giants, San Diego Chargers and Carolina Panthers. ==College career== After leading Strath Haven High School to two PIAA state championships, Mark Jones played all over the field at the University of Tennessee, seeing action at wide receiver, safety, punt returner, and kick returner. For his career, he caught 36 passes for 556 yards (a 15.4 avg.) and five touchdowns, all during his senior season in 2003. He also rushed seven times for 65 yards. As a defensive back, Jones racked up 116 career tackles, four interceptions, ten defended passes, two forced fumbles, one tackle for a loss, and one recovered fumble. On the special teams side of the ball, he returned 46 punts for 543 yards and one touchdown; he also returned four kickoffs for 138 yards and one touchdown. His longest kickoff return was 82 yards for a touchdown against the University of Alabama in his junior year (2002). In his senior year, he ranked second in the SEC and third in the national standings, averaging 15.7 yards per punt return. Jones majored in psychology. ==Professional careerFirst stint with Buccaneers=== Jones was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 206th pick of the 2004 NFL Draft. However, he was waived on September 5, 2004. ===New York Giants=== Jones was then picked up by the New York Giants the next day. Jones was the primary punt returner for the Giants, starting in 14 games at the spot. He also lined up at wide receiver and defensive back occasionally throughout the season. Jones finished the season with 227 yards on 34 returns (6.7 average) and his longest return was for 29 yards. He also returned two kickoffs for 37 yards, with a long of 20 yards. Jones, however did not make an impact with the Giants, and after missing the last two games with an injury, was released. ===Second stint with Buccaneers=== The Giants released Mark Jones on September 3, 2005, and he was picked up by the Bucs on September 7. He started in all sixteen regular season games and the Buccaneers' only playoff game against the Washington Redskins. Because of the Buccaneers' #1 defense, the opposing team was forced to punt to Jones, which is why he led the team with an NFL-best 51 punt returns for 492 yards. In a game against the Atlanta Falcons, Jones returned a punt in overtime 28 yards to set up a game-winning Matt Bryant field goal. Jones returned four punts for 37 yards in the NFC Wild Card game. Following a season-ending knee injury suffered on October 21, 2007, Jones was placed on IR October 24. ===San Diego Chargers=== On June 20, 2008, Jones signed with the San Diego Chargers. He was released on August 30 during final cuts. ===Carolina Panthers=== Jones was signed by the Carolina Panthers after the team waived wide receiver Dominique Thompson. He returned 39 punts and 40 kickoffs for 1,433 yards in 2008, his only season with the team. In Carolina's first-round playoff loss to Arizona, he returned 5 kickoffs for 151 yards. Despite his short tenure, 's NFL off-season, Mark Jones held at least 4 Panthers franchise records, including: * Kick Returns: playoff game (5 on 2009-01-10 ARI) * Yds/Kick Ret: playoffs (30.2), playoff season (30.2 in 2008) * Yds/Punt Ret: career (11.36) ===Tennessee Titans=== Jones was signed by the Tennessee Titans on March 18, 2009 after incumbent returner Chris Carr signed with the Baltimore Ravens. The Titans released Jones on September 4. He was re-signed on September 29. On May 25, 2010 his contract was terminated. ==Personal life== Mark Jones was a community contributor with the Giants in 2004, helping out as a professor at the Giants' \\"Football 101\\" program in New York City. He also spoke to children in New York elementary schools about staying healthy and making right choices. In high school, he was a starting tailback and defensive back for four years at Strath Haven High School in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. He was the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Player of the Year and USA Today Player of the Year for Pennsylvania in 1999. Jones led his high school team to a 15-0 record as a senior and was named Class 3A All- State. ==External links== *Tennessee Titans bio Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:People from Nether Providence Township, Pennsylvania Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania Category:American football return specialists Category:American football wide receivers Category:American football cornerbacks Category:Tennessee Volunteers football players Category:New York Giants players Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Carolina Panthers players Category:Tennessee Titans players Category:Tampa Bay Storm players ","title":"Mark Jones (American football)"},{"id":"6226347","text":"Narcissus Hut is an alpine hut located in the Central Highlands of Tasmania.

The black and white, silent film was shot in the mid-1940s in the Spanish Harlem section of New York City. Helen Levitt, Janice Loeb, and James Agee were the cinematographers; they used small, hidden 16 mm film cameras to record street life, especially of children. Levitt edited the film and, subsequent to its first release, added a piano soundtrack composed and performed by Arthur Kleiner.From 1939 through 1967, Arthur Kleiner was the musical director for the film department of the New York Museum of Modern Art. He composed and performed piano scores for many silent films; his collection of 700 musical scores for silent films, which includes his own score for In the Street, is now archived at the University of Minnesota. See ==Production== In the Street (1948) The film is generally considered as an extension of Levitt's (now famed) street photography in New York City, and Levitt subsequently re-used the title, In the Street, for a volume reproducing her photographs. Arden also notes that In the Street was an influence on Stan Brakhage's and Andy Warhol's filmmaking. Loeb was a painter and photographer. James Agee was a noted writer; both Loeb and Agee subsequently collaborated with Levitt on a second film, The Quiet One (1948). Manny Farber summarized the film at the time, \\"The movie, to be shown around the 16mm circuit, has been beautifully edited (by Miss Levitt) into a somber study of the American figure, from childhood to old age, growing stiffer, uglier, and lonelier with the passage of years.\\" This book is a collection of Farber's reviews; the original review appeared in The Nation. The artist Roy Arden recently summarized the film somewhat differently, \\"In The Street is reportage as art. It reports the facts, but for their useless beauty above all. While it could be argued that the film tells us how working class residents of Spanish Harlem lived in the 1930s and 1940s - how they looked and behaved, the addition of expository narration could have told us so much more. Statistics and other facts could have helped us put what we see into context and multiplied the use-value of the film. The absence of narration or other texts proves the artist's intent that we are intended to enjoy the film as a collection of beautiful appearances.\\" ==Reception== In 2006, In the Street was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". ==Release== A videotape version of the film was released in 1996, but is apparently out of print. ==References * Category:1948 films Category:American documentary films Category:American silent short films Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:1948 documentary films Category:American films Category:American short films Category:1948 short films Category:Black-and-white documentary films Category:Short documentary films Category:Documentary films about New York City Category:Films set in Harlem Category:American black-and-white films ","title":"In the Street (film)"},{"id":"6226415","text":"Roch Pinard, (July 26, 1910 - April 23, 1974) was a Canadian politician.

The energy which is radiated from the sources must scatter to infinity; no energy may be radiated from infinity into ... the field.\\"A. Sommerfeld, Partial Differential Equations in Physics, Academic Press, New York, New York, 1949. Mathematically, consider the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation : ( abla^2 + k^2) u = -f \\\\mbox{ in } \\\\mathbb R^n where n=2, 3 is the dimension of the space, f is a given function with compact support representing a bounded source of energy, and k>0 is a constant, called the wavenumber. A solution u to this equation is called radiating if it satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition : \\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} x^{\\\\frac{n-1}{2}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} - ik \\\\right) u(x) = 0 uniformly in all directions :\\\\hat{x} = \\\\frac{x}{x} (above, i is the imaginary unit and \\\\cdot is the Euclidean norm). Here, it is assumed that the time-harmonic field is e^{-i\\\\omega t}u. If the time-harmonic field is instead e^{i\\\\omega t}u, one should replace -i with +i in the Sommerfeld radiation condition. The Sommerfeld radiation condition is used to solve uniquely the Helmholtz equation. For example, consider the problem of radiation due to a point source x_0 in three dimensions, so the function f in the Helmholtz equation is f(x)=\\\\delta(x-x_0), where \\\\delta is the Dirac delta function. This problem has an infinite number of solutions, for example, any function of the form :u = cu_+ + (1-c) u_- \\\\, where c is a constant, and : u_{\\\\pm}(x) = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\pm ikx-x_0}}{4\\\\pi x-x_0}. Of all these solutions, only u_+ satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition and corresponds to a field radiating from x_0. The other solutions are unphysical.

He was a member of Lok Sabha from the Mandi constituency of Himachal Pradesh. He won the Vidhan Sabha elections five times and the Lok Sabha elections three times. ==Early life== Sukh Ram was born on 27 July 1927 in a poor family of 10 children in Kotli, Himachal Pradesh. He attended the Delhi Law School and practised as a lawyer at the Mandi District law courts in 1953. In 1962 he became a Member of the Territorial Council in Himachal Pradesh. ==Political career== He represented the Mandi Assembly seat from 1963 to 1984. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1984 and served as a junior minister in the Rajiv Gandhi government. He served as minister of state for defence production and supplies, planning and food and civil supplies. Sukh Ram was the Union minister of state (independent charge) holding the communications portfolio from 1993 to 1996. While Sukh Ram represented the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency, his son contested and won the Assembly seat in 1993. Sukh Ram won the Mandi Lok Sabha seat in 1996, but the two were expelled from the Congress party after the telecom scam. They formed the Himachal Vikas Congress, entered into a post-poll alliance with the BJP and joined the government. Sukh Ram contested the Assembly Elections in 1998 from Mandi Sadar and won by a huge margin of 22000+ votes; that was highest in the State. His son Anil Sharma was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1998. In the 2003 Assembly poll, Sukh Ram retained the Mandi Assembly seat but joined the Congress in the run-up to the 2004 Lok Sabha polls. Anil Sharma won the Mandi Assembly seat in 2007 and 2012 as a Congress candidate. In 2017, prior to elections, Sukh Ram joined BJP along with his son Anil Sharma and Grandson Aashray Sharma. It is considered as impact of Sukh Ram that BJP won 9 out of 10 seats in DISTRICT Mandi and one seat i.e. Joginder Nagar was won by an independent candidate. His son Anil is now Power Minister in the state of Himachal Pradesh under BJP regime. The family has a significant influence among the Himachal's Brahmins, who comprise nearly 20 per cent, or a fifth, of the state's electorate (the second-highest for any state in India, next to Uttarakhand). His another grandson is married to Salman Khan's sister. Sukhram crossed over to Bharatiya Janata Party in 2017 before reverting to the Congress in 2019. == Controversies == Sukh Ram was Telecom Minister in P. V. Narasimha Rao's cabinet. In 1996, the Central Bureau of Investigation seized from his official residence Rs. 3.6 crores in cash concealed in bags and suitcases, which he was alleged to have collected in connection with irregularities in awarding a telecom contract. He was sentenced to three years‚Äô rigorous imprisonment by a Delhi court in 2002. He was convicted again on 18 November 2011 on the charges of following fraudulent procedures in the purchase of polythene-insulated jelly-filled cables for the Department of Telecommunication during his tenure as the minister of that department. He had previously been sentenced for amassing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. Although convicted and sentenced by different courts in three different but related cases, Ram has said he will fight his case in higher courts.The Chor from mandi has still not returned the money which was not seized and its value has increased 2o times in these 20 years In March 2018, the Supreme Court consented to hear his appeal in May of that year. ==See also== *List of scandals in India *Licence Raj *Mafia Raj *Lok Ayukta ==References== Category:Living people Category:Indian National Congress politicians Category:People from Mandi, Himachal Pradesh Category:Indian politicians convicted of crimes Category:Indian prisoners and detainees Category:Lok Sabha members from Himachal Pradesh Category:8th Lok Sabha members Category:10th Lok Sabha members Category:11th Lok Sabha members Category:Crime in Himachal Pradesh Category:1927 births ","title":"Sukh Ram"},{"id":"6226444","text":"(meaning the City Theatre) is one of the two theatres built in the 19th century by Baron Haussmann at Place du Ch√¢telet, Paris, the other being the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet. It is located at 2, place du Ch√¢telet in the 4th arrondissement. Included among its many previous names are Th√©√¢tre Lyrique, Th√©√¢tre des Nations, and Th√©√¢tre Sarah-Bernhardt. ==Early historyTh√©√¢tre Lyrique=== The theatre, which until the fall of Napoleon III in 1870 was officially known as the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique Imp√©rial, was designed by the architect Gabriel Davioud for Baron Haussmann between 1860 and 1862 for the opera company more commonly known simply as the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique. That company's earlier theatre, the Th√©√¢tre Historique on the Boulevard du Temple, where it had performed since 1851, was slated for demolition as part of Haussmann's renovation of Paris.Walsh 1981, pp. 149‚Äì150. During the company's initial period on the Place du Ch√¢telet, it was under the direction of L√©on Carvalho and gave the premieres of Bizet's Les p√™cheurs de perles (1863), Berlioz's Les Troyens √† Carthage (1863), Gounod's Mireille (1864), Bizet's La jolie fille de Perth (1867), and Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette (1867). Carvalho also presented the first performance of Verdi's revised and expanded version of Macbeth (in French) in 1865.Walsh 1981, pp. 149‚Äì239, 316‚Äì321. Jules Pasdeloup took over as director in 1868 and gave the first Paris performances of Wagner's Rienzi in 1869.Walsh 1981, pp. 241‚Äì267, 321‚Äì322. The Th√©√¢tre Lyrique on the Place du Ch√¢telet was nearly completely destroyed by fire on 21 May 1871 during the recapturing of Paris by the forces of the Adolphe Thiers at the end of Paris Commune, and the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique opera company went bankrupt not long after.Walsh 1981, pp. 274‚Äì275. ===Th√©√¢tre Historique and Th√©√¢tre des Nations=== The theatre was rebuilt in 1874 on the same plans and was at first called the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique-Dramatique, but was soon renamed to Th√©√¢tre Historique, which it retained until 1879, when it became Th√©√¢tre des Nations.Lecomte 1905, p. 38 (Th√©√¢tre Lyrique-Dramatique), p. 32 (Th√©√¢tre Historique), p. 43 (Th√©√¢tre des Nations).Based on the corresponding article in the French Wikip√©dia (version 12 juin 2012 √† 11:13). Victor Maurel produced a season of Italian opera at the Th√©√¢tre des Nations in 1884. It included on 1 February 1884 the first Paris performance of Massenet's H√©rodiade, in the Italian version entitled Erodiade. The cast included Fid√®s Devri√®s as Salom√©, Guglielmina Tremelli as H√©rodiade, Jean de Reszke as Jean, Maurel as H√©rode, √âdouard de Reszke as Phanuel, and Giuseppe Villani as Vitellius. In the tenth and final performance of Erodiade on 13 March three De Reszkes could be heard, as Josephine de Reszke sang Salom√©.Irvine 1994, p. 139. ===Op√©ra-Comique=== In 1887 the Op√©ra-Comique moved into the theatre after its previous home, the second Salle Favart, had been destroyed by fire. The name Th√©√¢tre Lyrique was restored, and the Op√©ra-Comique continued to perform in the theatre until 1898, when it returned to the newly built, third Salle Favart. During the company's sojourn on the Place du Ch√¢telet, it presented several operas by Massenet, including the premieres of Esclarmonde (1889) and Sapho (1897), as well as the first Paris performances of Werther (6 January 1893) and La Navarraise (3 October 1895).Simeone 2000, p. 203.Wild & Charlton 2003, pp. 97, 339. ==Later history Th√©√¢tre Sarah-Bernhardt === Sarah Bernhardt as Hamlet (1899) In 1899 the theatre was renamed Th√©√¢tre Sarah-Bernhardt after the renowned actress Sarah Bernhardt, who produced there from 1899 for nearly two decades. She opened with a revival of one of her great roles, Victorien Sardou's La Tosca. Other productions included a revival of Edmond Rostand's La Samaritaine and the premiere of his L'Aiglon in which she played Napoleon's son (the Duke of Reichstadt). Another well known breeches part was the title role of Marcel Schwob's adaptation of Hamlet. After her death in 1923 the theatre continued under her son Maurice for several years. After his death in 1928 the theatre kept the name Sarah Bernhardt until the Occupation of France by the Germans in World War II,McCormick 1995. when the name was changed to Th√©√¢tre de la Cit√© because of Bernhardt's Jewish ancestry. Diaghilev's Ballets Russes presented several premieres at the Th√©√¢tre Sarah-Bernhardt, including Stravinsky's Apollon musag√®te (12 June 1928) and the revised Renard (21 May 1929; with choreography by Serge Lifar), and two ballets by Prokoviev, Le pas d'acier (27 May 1927) and Le Fils prodigue (21 May 1929).Program of the Ballets Russes for 21 May 1929: Renard and Le Fils prodigue at Gallica. ===Th√©√¢tre de la Ville=== The theatre first acquired the name Th√©√¢tre de la Ville in 1968. Since the late 1970s the institution, under the direction of Jean Mercure (1968‚Äì1985) then of G√©rard Violette (1985‚Äì2008), has been internationally recognised for its contemporary dance productions and has showcased major choreographers such as Pina Bausch, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, Jan Fabre, Sankai Juku, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, Merce Cunningham and Carolyn Carlson. ==References== Notes Sources * Banham, Martin (1995).

It was founded in 1972 by the merger of six former independent municipalities. Otzberg consists of seven villages: Habitzheim, Hering, Lengfeld with Zipfen, Nieder-Klingen, Ober-Klingen and Ober-Nauses, and Schloss-Nauses. One place of interest in Otzberg is its eponymous castle, a medieval fortress that was first mentioned in 1231. It is widely known for its white tower. The castle itself has been slowly reconstructed to resemble its medieval appearance. == Partners == * Lenclo√Ætre, D√©partement Vienne, France, since 1983 * Langenwei√übach, Landkreis Zwickauer Land, Germany, since 1990 ==GeographyLocation=== The town is located in the northern Odenwald in southern Hesse.

In clear conditions one can see from here to Frankfurt am Main and the Taunus. ===Geology=== The Otzberg is an extinct volcano made of B√∂llstein gneiss, formed on an old fault zone (the Otzberg column), which continues to the south and separates the eastern B√∂llsteiner, which is about 50 million years younger than western Bergstr√§√üer Odw.

It thrives in ordinary to dry soil in full sun; partial shade is preferred in hot climates. It is self-sowing and can be propagated by seed, by division of the roots, layering of the stems or cuttings from growing shoots. Deadheading extends the blooming period. The flowers sit atop stems approximately 25‚Äì45 cm tall, while the gray-green linear leaves form a mat at the base of the plant 20‚Äì30 cm wide. Because D. superbus is low to the ground, those who want to enjoy its fragrance find planting it in groups desirable. The leaves are edible when young, and can be eaten when boiled. The flowers contain sweet nectar, and the foliage can be eaten or boiled to make a drink. The plant contains toxic saponins, but not enough to be harmful. It has historically been used in Chinese herbology as a contraceptive, diuretic, and anti-infective; its Chinese name is q√∫m√†i (ÁûøÈ∫¶).Plants for a Future: Dianthus superbus ==Cultural significance== The yamato nadeshiko, (D. superbus longicalycinus), is metaphorically associated with traditional, idealized feminine beauty, in Japanese culture. ==References== superbus ","title":"Dianthus superbus"},{"id":"6226485","text":"The Alaska State Pension Investment Board (ASPIB) is the state pension scheme of the state of Alaska, United States, based in Juneau, Alaska.

Designed for his intended voyage through the Northeast Passage, the vessel was built in Asker, a suburb of the capital, Oslo. Maud was launched in June 1916Unsinking a ship: Maud returns home - Roald Amundsen and Maud or 17 June 1917Maud Returns Home at Vollen and ceremonially christened by Amundsen crushing a chunk of ice against her bow: ==Career and fate== She lived up to her christening, as she remained in the ice until 2016. Whereas other vessels used in Amundsen's polar explorations, Gj√∏a and Fram, have been preserved at the Norwegian Maritime Museum, Maud had a more rugged fate. After sailing through the Northeast Passage, which did not go as planned and took six years between 1918 and 1924, she ended up in Nome, Alaska and in August 1925 was sold on behalf of Amundsen's creditors in Seattle, Washington. The buyer was the Hudson's Bay Company, which renamed her Baymaud. She was to be used as a supply vessel for Company outposts in Canada's western Arctic. Prior to her final voyage Baymaud was given a refit in Vancouver, British Columbia. (The work was supervised by Tom Halliday, who later designed the RCMP vessel St. Roch, based on Maud.) In the winter of 1926 she was frozen into the ice at Cambridge Bay, where she sank in 1930. The wreck lay just offshore, across the inlet from the community's former Hudson's Bay Company store. Nearby is the site of the former Cambridge Bay LORAN Tower, built in 1947. In 1990 the ship was sold by the Hudson's Bay Company to Asker with the expectation that she would be returned to the town. Although a Cultural Properties Export permit was issued, the price tag to repair and move the ship was 230 million kroner ($43,200,000) and the permit expired.Underwater Treasure of Cambridge BayNunavut News/North Monday August 20, 2007 \\"Saving the Maud\\"Cambridge Bay , Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre (1996) In 2011 an Asker-based company, Tandberg Eiendom AS, in the project Maud Returns HomeMaud Returns Home announced a plan to return Maud to Norway.

Unlike the other encryption system used by Top Up TV, Mediaguard, the Xtraview Video Encryption System was not a true encryption system. Instead, an MHEG application directed the user's set-top box to a hidden videostream when a correct PIN is entered. Unlike traditional channel encryption methods, Xtraview did not require a viewing card. This is an advantage over digital terrestrial television in the UK, where the vast majority of set-top boxes have no ability to decrypt pay channels. Access to a channel protected using the Xtraview technology was granted by calling a premium rate telephone number. During the call, users were asked to give a number displayed on screen. In response, they were given a PIN to unlock the service. a similar system is in use by Babestation Xtreme, Red Hot TV, Television X and briefly by the now defunct TView on digital terrestrial television. ==Criticism== The PIN system has been subject to widespread hacking. Without encryption, the system was easily circumvented by set-top boxes that are able to access individual videostreams when individual stream PIDs are entered. More recently, the PIN algorithm itself was cracked, allowing others to access the service. Another downfall is that because the application is MHEG generated, if the set-top box was switched off, access to these channels was lost. It is also stated on-screen before purchase that not all boxes are compatible. Another factor is that a few cheaper boxes do not have MHEG support at all, and therefore cannot access the service. ==External links== #Top Up TV Homepage Category:Digital rights management systems Category:Television technology ","title":"Xtraview Encryption System"},{"id":"6226518","text":"Krause (German for ruffle) is a common German surname. ==Geographical distribution== As of 2014, 64.9% of all known bearers of the surname Krause were residents of Germany (frequency 1:531), 20.6% of the United States (1:7,541), 3.5% of Brazil (1:24,831), 2.4% of South Africa (1:9,550), 2.1% of Poland (1:7,891), 1.4% of Canada (1:11,446) and 1.2% of Australia (1:8,488).

Singh was born in 1860 at Sarhali, in Amritsar District of British Punjab province (India). In 1914 he chartered a Japanese ship, the Komagata Maru, to go to Canada, reaching Vancouver on 23 May 1914. The government did not allow the ship to anchor and the ship was attacked by the police at night. The attack was repulsed by the passengers and it created a great stir among Indians in Canada. ==Early years== His grandfather, Sardar Rattan Singh was a high- ranking military officer in the Khalsa Army and had fought against the British during the Anglo-Sikh wars. He declined the British offer of a jagir after the annexation of the Punjab. Later on, his father Sardar Hukam Singh went to Malaya where he settled down as a contractor. ===Education=== Gurdit Singh received little education in his childhood, partly due to the harsh treatment of his teacher which caused him to leave school. However, at the age of 13, he privately acquired elementary education so as to be able to correspond with his father in Malaya. ===British Malaya=== Gurdit Singh visited Malaya in about 1885 and conducted business in Singapore and Malaya as a contractor. He returned from there in 1909. In 1911 he raised his voice against forced labour. He wrote to the government complaining against officials who forced poor villagers to work for them without remuneration, and when he received no response, he exhorted the people of his village to refuse to be subjected to begar (forced labour). ==Legacy== Though he himself was a well-to-do fisherman in Singapore, Gurdit Singh chartered a Japanese ship, the Komagata Maru, in 1914 to go to Canada, with the aim of helping his compatriots whose journeys to Canada were being blocked. The government of Canada had put restrictions on the entry of Indians. The ship, renamed as Guru Nanak Jahaj, had a total of 376 passengers out of whom 351 were Sikhs and 21 Punjabi Muslims. The ship sailed from Hong Kong to Vancouver on 3 April 1914. The obstructions put up by the alien authorities and the hardships faced by its passengers turned them into staunch nationalists. The ship reached Vancouver on 22 May 1914, it was not allowed to anchor and was attacked by the police at night. The attack was repulsed by the passengers and it created a great stir among the Indians in Canada. This is known as the Komagata Maru incident. An agreement was reached and the ship sailed back to India. It reached Calcutta on 29 September 1914. However, the passengers were not allowed to enter Calcutta; they were rather ordered to board a Punjab-bound train especially arranged for the purpose. They refused to do so and many of the passengers were killed, though a great many escaped. Gurdit Singh was aware of the problems that Punjabis were facing in getting to Canada due to exclusion laws. He was apparently also aware of the January 1914 regulations when he chartered the Komagata Maru, with the purported goal of challenging the continuous journey regulation and opening the door for immigration from India to Canada.Johnston, H., op. cit., p. 26. He believed he could circumvent this law by hiring a boat to sail from Calcutta to Vancouver. At the same time, in January 1914, he publicly espoused the Ghadarite cause while in Hong Kong.Johnston, H., op. cit., pp. 24 and 25. The Ghadar Party was an organisation founded by Indians of the United States and Canada in June 1913 with the aim of liberating India from British rule. It was also known as the Hindi Association of the Pacific Coast. ==Later years== Baba Gurdit Singh escaped and remained underground for many years until 1920 when, on the advice of Mahatma Gandhi, he made a voluntary surrender at Nankana Sahib and was imprisoned for five years. In 1937, Pratap Singh Kairon, the future Chief Minister Punjab and then an Akali nominee, entered the Punjab Legislative Assembly, defeating the Congress candidate, none other than Baba Gurdit Singh of Sarhali. Baba Gurdit Singh had one son, Baba Balwant Singh. Baba Balwant Singh had two sons, Ajit Singh & Jaswant Singh, and five daughters: Harbhajan Kaur, Sawant Kaur, Amarjit Kaur, Balbir Kaur & Dalbir Kaur. His sons both died in late seventies and early eighties. He has two paternal grandsons, one of them lives in Zira and the other (Tejpal Singh Sandhu) lives in Canada while their mother (his daughter-in-law) is settled in the US. His grandson, living in Zira, died in 2014 in a car accident near Sarhali. Later, he settled in Calcutta. He died on 24 July, 1954, in Amritsar and was cremated at his native village Sarhali Kalan, Tarn taran. == References == Category:1860 births Category:1954 deaths Category:History of human rights in Canada Category:Indian revolutionaries Category:International maritime incidents ","title":"Baba Gurdit Singh"},{"id":"6226536","text":"Herbert James Symington, (November 22, 1881 - September 28, 1965) was a Canadian lawyer and businessman.

He studied up to matriculation at a church Mission School of Ludhiana and was a school-mate of Kartar Singh Sarabha. He attempted to join the army, but he could not be enlisted due to medical reasons. ===Komagata Maru=== In 1914, he boarded the ship Komagata Maru after being hired by a Japanese firm to go to Canada. At Hong Kong, he learned about the new restrictions imposed by the Canadian Government. Upon reaching Canada, the passengers were not allowed to disembark, and had to return to India. The ship landed at the Budge Budge Ghat in Calcutta, a clash occurred between the passengers and the local police. Gurmukh Singh escaped and was captured three days later and imprisoned in the Alipur jail. Three months later, he was brought to the Punjab. ===Ghadr movement=== While placed under orders of internment, under the influence of Kartar Singh Sarabha and Rash Bihari Bose he made efforts to establish secret contacts with Indian soldiers in some of the Punjab cantonments. But all plans of Gurmukh Singh and his companions went awry on account of betrayal of one of their colleagues. He was arrested among the many revolutionaries after the disclosure of the plot and was incarcerated in the Lahore Central Jail and tried in the First Lahore Conspiracy Case along with others.

Within the span of a few years, he had proceeded to Kabul via Khybr Pass in company with Teja Singh Swatantar. In 1934, after he came back he was arrested again on suspicion of being in correspondence with Ghadrites and transported to Kala Pani to complete the remainder of his incarceration which was now increased by six months for his misconduct. He remained in confinement on the Andaman Islands until 1945, after which he was transferred to the Punjab and stayed in the Multan jail. From there he was released in 1947 after India achieved independence. ==See also== *Indian independence activists ==References== 4.^ ƒêi·ªÅu tr·ªã tho√°t v·ªã ƒëƒ©a ƒë·ªám Truy c·∫≠p ng√†y 20-3-2019 Category:Indian revolutionaries Category:People from Ludhiana Category:Punjabi people Category:1888 births Category:1977 deaths ","title":"Baba Gurmukh Singh"},{"id":"6226542","text":"The Kenyon Observer, founded in 1989 by David Horner and Alex Novak, began as a conservative, undergraduate political journal at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.

Lili Kraus (3 April 19036 November 1986) was a Hungarian-born pianist. ==Biography== Lili Kraus was born in Budapest in 1903. Her father was from Czech Lands, and her mother from an assimilated Jewish Hungarian family. She enrolled at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, and at the age of 17 entered the Budapest Conservatory where she studied with Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, and B√©la Bart√≥k. In the 1930s, she continued her studies with Severin Eisenberger, Eduard Steuermann in Vienna and Artur Schnabel in Berlin, who focused her interest in the classical tradition. Lili Kraus soon became known as a specialist in Mozart and Beethoven. Her early chamber music performances and recording with violinist Szymon Goldberg helped gain the critical acclaim that launched her international career. In the 1930s, she toured Europe, Japan, Australia and South Africa. In 1940, Kraus embarked on a tour of Asia where, while in Java, she and her family were captured and interned in a concentration camp by the Japanese from June 1943 until August 1945. After the war, she settled in New Zealand where she spent many happy years playing, performing, and teaching. She became a NZ citizen and resumed her career, teaching and touring extensively. In the early 1950s she performed the entire Beethoven sonata cycle with violinist Henri Temianka. From 1967 to 1983, she taught as artist-in-residence at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. After that she made her home in Asheville, North Carolina, where she died in 1986. Kraus' husband was Otto Mandl (b. 1889 d. 1956), a wealthy Jewish (later converted to Catholicism) mining engineer and philosopher. They were married on October 31, 1930 and Mandl sold his business in order to devote himself to the furtherance of Kraus' career. The couple had two children, Ruth and Michael. ==External links== * Biography at Bach Cantatas * European Archive Copyright free LP recording of Lili Kraus playing two Haydn piano sonatas at the European Archive (for non-American viewers only). * Naxos: Lili Kraus * 'Camera Three' episode: Lili Kraus on Schubert 'Grazer' Fantasy (11/2/1969) (audio only) == References == Category:1903 births Category:1986 deaths Category:20th-century Hungarian people Category:20th-century classical pianists Category:Hungarian classical pianists Category:Hungarian women pianists Category:New Zealand classical pianists Category:New Zealand women pianists Category:Jewish classical pianists Category:Franz Liszt Academy of Music alumni Category:Texas classical music Category:Hungarian refugees Category:Hungarian expatriates in Italy Category:Hungarian expatriates in Indonesia Category:Hungarian emigrants to New Zealand Category:Hungarian people of Czech descent Category:Hungarian Roman Catholics Category:Hungarian people of Jewish descent Category:Musicians from Budapest Category:Women classical pianists Category:20th-century British musicians Category:Pupils of B√©la Bart√≥k Category:Pupils of Artur Schnabel Category:20th-century composers Category:Music & Arts artists Category:20th-century women composers ","title":"Lili Kraus"},{"id":"6226587","text":"integer partition (set partitions up to rotation and reflection) chiral, so there are 4 necklaces. Compare box(6,9) in the triangle. The 11 bracelets with 2 red, 2 yellow and 2 green beads. The leftmost one and the four rightmost ones are chiral, so there are 16 necklaces. Compare box(6,7) in the triangle. 16 Tantrix tiles, corresponding to the 16 necklaces with 2 red, 2 yellow and 2 green beads. In combinatorics, a k-ary necklace of length n is an equivalence class (a grouping for which there exists an equivalence relation) of n-character strings over an alphabet of size k, taking all rotations as equivalent. It represents a structure with n circularly connected beads which have k available colors. A k-ary bracelet, also referred to as a turnover (or free) necklace, is a necklace such that strings may also be equivalent under reflection. That is, given two strings, if each is the reverse of the other, they belong to the same equivalence class. For this reason, a necklace might also be called a fixed necklace to distinguish it from a turnover necklace. Formally, one may represent a necklace as an orbit of the cyclic group acting on n-character strings, and a bracelet as an orbit of the dihedral group. One can count these orbits, and thus necklaces and bracelets, using P√≥lya's enumeration theorem. == Equivalence classes  Number of necklaces === There are :N_k(n)=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{d\\\\mid n}\\\\varphi(d)k^\\\\frac{n}{d} different k-ary necklaces of length n, where \\\\varphi is Euler's totient function. This follows directly from P√≥lya's enumeration theorem applied to the action of the cyclic group C_n acting on the set of all functions f : \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\} \\\\to\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,k\\\\\\\\}. There are also :L_k(n)=\\\\frac{k!}{n}\\\\sum_{d\\\\mid n}\\\\varphi(d)S(\\\\frac{n}{d}, k) different necklaces of length n with exactly k different colored beads, where S(n, k) are the Stirling number of the second kind. N_k(n) and L_k(n) are related via the Binomial coefficients: :N_k(n)=\\\\sum_{j=1}^k\\\\binom{k}{j}L_k(n) and :L_k(n)=\\\\sum_{j=1}^k(-1)^{k-j}\\\\binom{k}{j}N_k(n) === Number of bracelets === There are total :B_k(n) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\tfrac12 N_k(n) + \\\\tfrac14 (k+1)k^\\\\frac{n}{2} & \\\\text{if }n\\\\text{ is even} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10px] \\\\tfrac12 N_k(n) + \\\\tfrac12 k^\\\\frac{n+1}{2} & \\\\text{if }n\\\\text{ is odd} \\\\end{cases} different k-ary bracelets of length n, where Nk(n) is the number of k-ary necklaces of length n. This follows from P√≥lya's method applied to the action of the dihedral group D_n. == Case of distinct beads == For a given set of n beads, all distinct, the number of distinct necklaces made from these beads, counting rotated necklaces as the same, is = (n ‚àí 1)!. This is because the beads can be linearly ordered in n! ways, and the n circular shifts of such an ordering all give the same necklace. Similarly, the number of distinct bracelets, counting rotated and reflected bracelets as the same, is , for n ‚â• 3\\\\. If the beads are not all distinct, having repeated colors, then there are fewer necklaces (and bracelets). The above necklace-counting polynomials give the number necklaces made from all possible multisets of beads. Polya's pattern inventory polynomial refines the counting polynomial, using variable for each bead color, so that the coefficient of each monomial counts the number of necklaces on a given multiset of beads. == Aperiodic necklaces == An aperiodic necklace of length n is a rotation equivalence class having size n, i.e., no two distinct rotations of a necklace from such class are equal. According to Moreau's necklace-counting function, there are :M_k(n)=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{d\\\\mid n}\\\\mu(d)k^\\\\frac{n}{d} different k-ary aperiodic necklaces of length n, where Œº is the M√∂bius function. The two necklace-counting functions are related by: N_k(n)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum olimits_{dn} M_k(d), where the sum is over all divisors of n, which is equivalent by M√∂bius inversion to M_k(n)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum olimits_{dn} N_k(d)\\\\,\\\\mu(\\\\tfrac{n}{d}). Each aperiodic necklace contains a single Lyndon word so that Lyndon words form representatives of aperiodic necklaces. == See also == * Lyndon word * Inversion (discrete mathematics) * Necklace problem * Necklace splitting problem * Permutation * Proofs of Fermat's little theorem#Proof by counting necklaces * Forte number, a representation of binary bracelets of length 12 used in atonal music. == References  External links == * * Info on necklaces, Lyndon words, De Bruijn sequences Category:Combinatorics on words Category:Enumerative combinatorics ","title":"Necklace (combinatorics)"},{"id":"6226589","text":"2/3 may refer to: * Two Parts of Three Parts * 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines of the United States Marine Corps * February 3 * March 2 ","title":"2/3"},{"id":"6226592","text":"The Jordan News Agency (In Arabic: ŸàŸÉÿßŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ±ÿØŸÜŸäÿ©) (Shortly Petra) is the news agency of Jordan. ==History== Petra was established in 1969, as an independent body linked to the ministry of information.

Born in the southwestern town of Bansko (or possibly in the village of Guliyna Banya) of Pirin Macedonia, Benin was educated to become a teacher, initially by his father Petar, and later at the Rila Monastery, where he studied iconography and had access to Greek and Church Slavonic books. He went to Melnik in 1822, where he spent four years as a student of the noted teacher Adam and perfected his Greek and Greek literature knowledge. Initially working as a teacher in the Rila Monastery, he also spent time working in Samokov (1827‚Äì1831), then back in the monastery, then went to Gabrovo and Koprivshtitsa (1835‚Äì1839) and returned to the monastery as a teacher to join the theological school on the island of Halki, where he spent four and a half years.

Because William I abdicated between 24 April and 6 December, the holiday was celebrated twice in 1840. Under William III (1849‚Äì1890), the date was set at 17 June until 1859, after which his birthday was celebrated on 19 February, two days after his actual birthday. With the separation of the orders of succession, the Dutch and Luxembourgish thrones split in 1890. The Nassau-Weilburg monarchs celebrated their official birthdays on their actual birthdays. In 1947, the day was declared the 'national holiday'. As both the then-reigning Charlotte and the heir apparent (and regent) Jean were born in January, it was feared that their actual birthdays, therefore the nation's holiday, would be marred by poor weather.

He was one of the most successful amateur footballers of his generation. Lewis, educated at the Monoux School, Walthamstow, began his football career as a 16-year-old with the famous amateur side Walthamstow Avenue (his father had also played for them) and in three stints with the club scored 423 goals in 522 appearances, mainly as a centre forward. He had briefly left Walthamstow in November 1950 to play for Leyton Orient, but after playing as an amateur in 4 League games he rejected their contract terms. Lewis was a key part of the Walthamstow side which reached the FA Cup fourth round in 1953, beating sides such as Stockport County and Watford and drawing 1‚Äì1 with Manchester United at Old Trafford, before losing 5‚Äì2 in the replay. Just days later, Lewis received a telephone call from Chelsea manager Ted Drake, and promptly signed for the club. In the days when the disparity between the pay of amateur and professional footballers was minimal, Lewis never turned professional, although his Chelsea teammate Derek Saunders, who also played for Walthamstow, did. He juggled his playing time with working as a salesman for Thermos flasks which, unlike many of his fellow players, allowed him to have a car. With Roy Bentley established as the Chelsea's centre forward, Lewis was switched to either outside or inside left. He made his Chelsea debut in October 1952 against Charlton Athletic and scored in a 2‚Äì2 draw. His most noteworthy contribution to Chelsea was to be a member of their 1954‚Äì55 championship- winning side. He played in 17 league games that season, and scored 6 goals, including crucial goals in wins over Bolton Wanderers, Sheffield United and Tottenham Hotspur. Chelsea's professional players each received a suit to commemorate the success, but Lewis instead received an illuminated address from the club. Lewis remained with Chelsea until 1958, and scored 40 goals in 95 appearances for the club. He was also a member of the representative London XI which competed in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1958. He played in the 6‚Äì0 second-leg loss in the final against FC Barcelona. Lewis won 49 caps for the England amateur national side, and also played for the Great Britain football team at the 1952, 1956 and 1960 Olympic Games. ==References== Category:1927 births Category:2011

He represented T√©miscouata in the 1st Canadian Parliament as a Conservative member. He was born Charles-Fr√©d√©ric Bertrand in L'Isle-Verte, Lower Canada in 1824, the son of Louis Bertrand, who purchased the seigneury of √éle-Verte in 1849. He attended the Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec. In 1850, Bertrand married Arth√©mise Dionne, daughter of Benjamin Dionne, and, that same year, his father gave him control over the seigneury. He owned several mills, a factory producing agricultural implements, a foundry and four schooners. He owned cutting rights for timber and operated a sawmill; he also owned a store in L'Isle-Verte. He served as mayor there in 1859 and from 1881 to 1885. Bertrand was also a director of the T√©miscouata Railway. He died in L'Isle-Verte in 1896. Just before his death, the industrial empire that he had built there began to fall apart, due to competition from other companies, bad luck, his son's lack of interest in the business and the unexpected death of Jean-Baptiste Raymond, whom he had been grooming to take over the operation. ==References== *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * Category:1824 births Category:1896 deaths Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867‚Äì1942) MPs Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Quebec Category:Pre-Confederation Canadian businesspeople Category:Mayors of places in Quebec Category:People from Bas-Saint-Laurent ","title":"Charles Bertrand (politician)"},{"id":"6226628","text":"Ferguson, LLC, headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, United States, is the largest U.S distributor of plumbing supplies, PVF, waterworks and fire and fabrication products. It is also a major distributor of HVAC equipment and industrial products and services. It ended the 2019 fiscal year with sales of $18.4 billion. This is an increase of 12.2 percent from the previous fiscal year. ==History== Ferguson was founded in 1953. The company started with two locations: Lenz Supply and Smither Supply. Expansion continued throughout the Southeast and Ferguson established its headquarters in Newport News, Va. By 1982 Ferguson began to double in size every five years and had locations in 11 states. Wolseley plc then acquired Ferguson. In 1989, Ferguson integrated with West Coast wholesale suppliers Familian and Familian Northwest. In the late 2000s, Ferguson‚Äôs growth began to slow as the recession hit traditional construction markets. In response to the market change, Ferguson shifted the business focus on efficiency. Wolseley plc changed its name to Ferguson plc in 2017. Ferguson Enterprises accounts for 90 percent of Ferguson plc‚Äôs trading profit and is traded on the London Stock Exchange. In 2019, the Board of Ferguson announced an intention to demerge their UK operations so that Wolseley UK and Ferguson could focus on serving their respective customers. In the same year, activist fund Trian Fund Management LP became an investor of Ferguson Plc with a 6% stake. ==Ferguson Today== Ferguson‚Äôs 2019 growth trended on an upward trajectory.

In recent years, it has become one of the world's most widely used pesticides. It is typically used as a rodenticide, but is also used to control larger pests such as possum.Eason, C.T. and Wickstrom, M. Vertebrate pesticide toxicology manual, New Zealand Department of Conservation Brodifacoum has an especially long half-life in the body, which ranges up to nine months, requiring prolonged treatment with antidotal vitamin K for both human and pet poisonings. It has one of the highest risks of secondary poisoning to both mammals and birds.Rodenticides: Topic Fact Sheet, National Pesticide Information Center Significant experience in brodifacoum poisonings has been gained in many human cases where it has been used in attempted suicides, necessitating long periods of vitamin K treatment. In March 2018, cases of severe coagulopathy and bleeding associated with synthetic cannabinoid use contaminated with brodifacoum were reported in five states of the US. ==Chemical synthesis== Brodifacoum is a derivative of the 4-hydroxy- coumarin group. Compound 1 is the starting ester needed to synthesize brodifacoum. To obtain this starting compound, a simple Wittig condensation of ethyl chloroacetate with 4‚Äô-bromobiphenylcarboxaldehyde is accomplished. Compound 1 is transformed into 2 by consecutive hydrolysis, halogenation to form an acid chloride, and then reacted with the required lithium anion. This is done using KOH and EtOH for hydrolysis, and then adding SOCl2 for chlorination to form the acid chloride which reacts with the addition of lithium anion. Compound 2 is then transformed using organocopper chemistry to yield compound 3 with good stereoselectivity of about 98%. Typically, a Friedel-Crafts type cyclization would then be used to obtain the two-ring system portion of compound 4, but this results in low yield. Instead, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid in dry benzene catalyzes the cyclization with good yield. The ketone is then reduced with sodium borohydride yielding a benzyl alcohol. Condensation with 4-hydroxycoumarin under HCl yields compound 5, brodifacoum. Stereospecific formation of Brodifacoum using an asymmetric organocopper compound. ==Toxicology== Brodifacoum is a 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant, with a similar mode of action to its historical predecessors dicoumarol and warfarin. However, due to very high potency and long duration of action (elimination half-life of 20 ‚Äì 130 days), it is characterised as a \\"second-generation\\" or \\"superwarfarin\\" anticoagulant. Brodifacoum inhibits the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase, which is needed for the reconstitution of the vitamin K in its cycle from vitamin K-epoxide, so brodifacoum steadily decreases the level of active vitamin K in the blood. Vitamin K is required for the synthesis of important substances including prothrombin, which is involved in blood clotting. This disruption becomes increasingly severe until the blood effectively loses any ability to clot. In addition, brodifacoum (as with other anticoagulants in toxic doses) increases permeability of blood capillaries; the blood plasma and blood itself begin to leak from the smallest blood vessels. A poisoned animal suffers progressively worsening internal bleeding, leading to shock, loss of consciousness, and eventually death. Brodifacoum is highly lethal to mammals and birds, and extremely lethal to fish. It is a highly cumulative poison, due to its high lipophilicity and extremely slow elimination. Following are acute values for a variety of animals: {  * rats (oral) 0.27 mg/kg b.w. -  * mice (oral)  0.40 mg/kg b.w. -  * rabbits (oral) 0.30 mg/kg b.w. -  * guinea-pigs (oral) 0.28 mg/kg b.w. -  * squirrels (oral) 0.13 mg/kg b.w. -  * cats (oral)Published LD50 values of brodifacoum for cats vary widely, from 25 mg kg-1(Rammell et al., 1984;Godfrey, 1985) to 0.25 mg kg-1(Haydock and Eason, 1997) 0.25 mg/kg b.w.Brodifacoum at InChem.com ‚Äî 25 mg/kg b.w.KAUKEINEN, D.E. 1979.

It is an extremely effective antidote, provided the poisoning is caught before excessive bleeding ensues. As high doses of brodifacoum can affect the body for many months, the antidote must be administered regularly for a long period (several months, in keeping with the substance's half-life) with frequent monitoring of the prothrombin time. If unabsorbed poison is still in the digestive system, gastric lavage followed by administration of activated charcoal may be required. Further treatments to be considered include infusion of blood or plasma to counteract hypovolemic shock, and in severe cases, infusion of blood clotting factor concentrate. === Case reports === Cases of brodifacoum intoxication have been reported in the human medical literature. In one report, a woman deliberately consumed over 1.5 kg of rat bait, constituting about 75 mg brodifacoum, but made a full recovery after receiving conventional medical treatment. In another case reported in 2013, a 48-year-old female patient reported 4 days of mild dyspnea, dry cough, bilateral popliteal fossae pain, and diffuse upper abdominal pain. She had no history of liver disease or alcohol or illicit substance abuse. Initial physical examination was remarkable only for mildly pale conjunctivae and mild abdominal tenderness and pain in the left popliteal fossa. A complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were normal. Prothrombin time (PT) was above 100 s, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was above 200 s and international normalized ratio (INR) was reported as above 12.0. Urinalysis revealed hematuria (blood in the urine). Venous Doppler ultrasound of lower extremities demonstrated left popliteal vein thrombosis. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen demonstrated transmural hematoma, and a fecal occult blood test was positive. A full anticoagulant work-up showed critical reduction of vitamin K-dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X. PT and PTT corrected with mixing studies proving factor deficiency as the cause of the coagulopathy. Lupus anticoagulant studies were negative. Superwarfarin toxicity was suspected and confirmed with an anticoagulant poison panel positive for brodifacoum. The patient was hospitalized and successfully treated with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and vitamin K. In conclusion, paradoxical thrombosis and hemorrhage should raise the suspicion for superwarfarin toxicity in the appropriate clinical setting. Concomitant presentation for thrombosis and hemorrhage with remarkably abnormal PT and PTT should raise the suspicion for brodifacoum poisoning. In another report, a 17-year-old boy presented to the hospital with a severe bleeding disorder. He was found to have habitually smoked a mixture of brodifacoum and marijuana. Despite treatment with vitamin K, the bleeding disorder persisted for several months. He eventually recovered. In 2015, 19 inmates in New York City's Rikers Island jail claimed that they had been poisoned with the chemical. The inmates had noticed \\"what appeared to be blue and green pellets in the meatloaf\\" they were eating on March 3, and felt ill afterwards. A sample was analyzed and tested positive for brodifacoum; the NYC Department of Corrections stated it was investigating the incident.Sydney Lupkin, \\"22 Rikers Island Prisoners Sickened By Rat Poison in Meatloaf, Lawyer Says, Daily News April 29, 2015 A 20-year-old female college student presented with abdominal pain and blood in urine. She was tested for warfarin, a common anticoagulant also used in some rodenticides, which returned a negative result. Vitamin K and fresh plasma were administered to treat symptoms. Three weeks later, she returned with bleeding into her calf, and was subsequently tested for superwarfarin chemicals. The test showed that brodifacoum was in her bloodstream. She later admitted to consuming seven packets of rodenticide. A 48-year-old businessman was admitted with a severe nosebleed and abnormal coagulation parameters. Standard treatment of vitamin K and fresh plasma was administered to stem the nosebleed. Two weeks later, he presented again with bleeding into the calf. Continual doses of vitamin K were necessary to counteract the brodifacoum. He denied taking any of the brodifacoum found in his home contained within packages of Contrac. As of November 26, 2018, at least eight fatalities and 320 cases of severe coagulopathy and bleeding associated with synthetic cannabinoid use had been reported in Illinois, Wisconsin, Maryland, Missouri, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. The first case occurred in Illinois on March 7, 2018. Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology, Iowa Department of Public Health Coagulopathies Associated with Contaminated Synthetic Cannabinoids April 6, 2018 Brodifacoum was suspected to be present in these products in Illinois.

Franklin (born 1966) is an American photographer for The Bergen Record, best known for his photograph Raising the Flag at Ground Zero, which depicts firefighters raising the American flag at the World Trade Center after the September 11, 2001 attacks. ==Biography== Franklin is a 1988 graduate of the State University of New York at Purchase. He has been with The Record since 1993, and has been a professional photojournalist and documentary photographer for over 20 years. He has won numerous awards for his photography, and his work has been widely published and exhibited. In 2005, his documentary film Ford's Toxic Legacy won the New Jersey Film Festival's Best Jersey Film award and the New Jersey Press Photographers Association's New Jersey Understanding award. Based on The Records award-winning Toxic Legacy series, which exposed toxic dumping by the Ford Motor Company and its impact on the Ramapough Indians and the environment, Franklin was part of a team of reporters who received the 2005 IRE Medal‚Äîthe top national investigative award‚Äîthe 2006 Grantham Prize for Environmental Journalism, and the 2005 Sigma Delta Chi Award, for Toxic Legacy.www.toxiclegacy.com Franklin has appeared on radio and television many times to discuss his photography. He has been a guest on many national programs, including The Today Show, Good Morning America, CNN, and Oprah. He has been a guest lecturer at major colleges and universities around the country and remains a highly sought-after public speaker in his local community, where he frequently speaks to civics groups, schools, corporations, and local organizations as a motivational speaker, sharing his unique experiences of 9/11 and his career. He produced a weekly photo-column in The Record called 'Picture This', featuring colorful aspects of life in North Jersey. In 2007, Picture This, received an Award of Excellence from POYi (Pictures of the Year International) and a First Place award in Feature Photography from the New Jersey chapter of Society of Professional Journalists (NJ-SPJ). Franklin is an assistant professor in the School of Communication and Media at Montclair State University. ==9/11 photos== Franklin rose to national acclaim for his coverage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York. His now iconic image of three firemen raising a flag above the rubble of the World Trade Center, taken hours after the attacks, is one of the most identifiable and powerful images in history. Life Magazine listed it as one of the \\"100 Photographs That Changed the World,\\" and the photo is part of the permanent collection of the Library of Congress. A Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2002 for his photographs from 9/11, Franklin has received dozens of national awards from MSNBC, Society of Professional Journalists, Editor & Publisher, the Deadline Club, and National Headliners, among others. ===Flag-raising photo=== The flag-raising photo was made shortly after 5 p.m. on September 11, 2001. He was standing under a pedestrian walkway across the West Side Highway, which connected the World Trade Center to the World Financial Center at the northwest corner. Franklin said the firefighters were about 150 feet away from him and about 20 feet (6 m) off the ground, while the debris was about 90 feet beyond that. In 2002, the United States Postal Service introduced the \\"Heroes\\" stamp, featuring the flag-raising photo. Proceeds from the stamp have raised over ten million dollars to help families and rescue workers of 9/11. Also in 2002, an autographed original print signed by Franklin and the three firemen pictured in the photo, sold for $89,625 at Christie's Auction House, with proceeds benefiting two 9/11 charities. The photo has also been instrumental in raising money for other charitable causes, including juvenile diabetes, autism, cerebral palsy. ==References *Thomas Franklin Website - Includes photo galleries of 9/11 and other events *Ground Zero Spirit - Contains information about the 9/11 photo and memorabilia, and 9/11 charity relief fund Category:1966 births Category:American photojournalists Category:Living people Category:State University of New York at Purchase alumni Category:People from Ramsey, New Jersey Category:Photographers from New Jersey Category:20th- century American photographers Category:21st-century American photographers ","title":"Thomas E.

The rocks found in The Lizard area are analogous to those found in such famous areas as the Troodos Mountains, Cyprus and the Semail Ophiolite, Oman. ==Lithologies== The Lizard comprises three main units; the serpentinites, the 'oceanic complex' and the metamorphic basement. Since the pioneering work of BromleyBromley, A.V. (1975). Is the Lizard Complex, South Cornwall, a fragment of Hercynian oceanic crust?.

London, 132, p. 114. and KirbyKirby, G. A. (1979). The Lizard Complex as an ophiolite. Nature, London, 282, pp. 58‚Äì61. these suites have been understood to represent a slice through a section of ocean crust, including the upper level of the mantle, thrust onto continental crust. ===Serpentinites=== The serpentinites are actually the metamorphosed and deformed remains of the upper layers of the mantle. The metamorphosis has in most cases taken the form of ductile deformation and serpentinisation. In many cases the rocks have also been subject to varying degrees of later brittle deformation. Pre-deformation they would have been a combination of undepleted mantle in the form of lherzolite peridotite and depleted harzburgite mantle from which basaltic phases had been removed. On the Lizard these two types of peridotite are represented by a heavily foliated orthopyroxene (enstatite)-rich serpentinite and less foliated, less orthopyroxene rich serpentinite which is typified by the presence of amphibole (tremolite). The boundary between these two types of serpentinite can be studied at Kynance Cove, and geologically represents the boundary between shallow mantle peridotites from which material has been extracted by melting and deeper peridotite from which no material has been removed. In the area of Ogo dour at the Northern reaches of Predannack, dunite, a highly depleted peridotite derivative which consists of almost pure olivine, is found. Earlier theories, most notably the BGS publication \\"Lizard & the Meneage\\"Flett, J. S. (1947). Lizard and the Meneage. (Memoir 359). British Geological Survey that summarised thinking up to the point of publication, proposed that the serpentinite body represented an intruded mass of ultra-mafic material. They believed that the foliations were the result of mass flux within the cooling magma body, and that the different types of serpentinite were the result of an igneous cooling alteration rim. ===Oceanic complex=== The oceanic complex consists of the Crousa Gabbro, locally intruded by a suite of dolerite dykes, and a number of schists, split into two broad groups: hornblende schist and mica schist. The hornblende schist, found in contact with the serpentine mass directly to the North (at Ogo Dour) and to the South (at Pentreath and Church Cove) is the metamorphic remnant of basaltic intrusives into the upper crust. It is typified by a schistose texture and visible crystals of black or dark green hornblende. Structural studies of the hornblende schist indicate that it has been subject to at least three stages of deformation. Folding of the schist at Housel Bay indicates that the formation was also subject to more than one subsequent stage of shear stress. On the South-east tip of the Lizard the hornblende schist is \\"inter- bedded\\" with pale yellow/green veins and pods of epidosite. These bands can extend laterally for many metres and lie in line with the schistose foliations of the surrounding rock. It is unclear what the provenance of these bands is, but theories include that they are the remains of volcanic ash fall during the deposition of the schist protolith, or the calcic remains of thin beds of ocean floor material deposited during less active periods of emplacement of the protolith. Chemical analysis of the schist draws parallels between it and mantle-derived material found at mid-ocean-ridge and back-arc settings. ===Basement=== The basement comprises a group of schists and gneisses of the Old Lizard Head Series and the Man of War gneisses. The Man of War Gneiss is interpreted as a sequence of metamorphosed igneous rocks, possibly intruded as part of the break-up associated with the formation of the ocean.

The earliest structures seen in the ophiolitic rocks are steeply-dipping foliations thought to represent deformation in lithosphere scale shear zones, associated with continental break-up in the early Devonian.Cook, C.

The northward dip of thrusts at the base of, and within, the ophiolitic rocks is interpreted to be caused by rotation of initially south-dipping thrust planes due to the dominantly south-dipping post-Variscan extensional faults. ==Timing== The formation of the oceanic crust found at the Lizard, its obduction and final emplacement are thought to have happened over a short period of approximately 35 Ma during the Devonian period.

It is about three single female friends who live in Penge, south-east London. It was co-written by Sharon Horgan and Dennis Kelly and stars Horgan as Donna, Tanya Franks as Karen, Rebekah Staton as Louise and Cavan Clerkin as Karl. Pulling was the last comedy show developed by Harry Thompson before his death. The first series of six episodes was first shown in 2006 on BBC Three, then repeated on BBC Two in early 2008. A second six- episode series of Pulling aired on BBC Three from 23 March to 27 April 2008 and a final one-hour episode aired on BBC Three on 17 May 2009. In Australia, series one and two was first aired back-to-back on ABC2 each Thursday at 10pm from 5 March 2009, although the final one-hour episode is yet to be screened by the network. Repeats have been screening on rotation through UKTV. In 2007, the series was BAFTA nominated for Best Situation Comedy while Horgan won a British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Entertainment Actress in 2008. In the same year, it was announced that Pulling had been cancelled by BBC Three. ==Main characters== In writing the series both Sharon Horgan and Dennis Kelly agreed that the main roles needed to be female and have the funny lines. Horgan: \\"There was nothing out there for me; I had to give myself a break! Peep Show has very funny female characters but they're generally girlfriends or incidental women who are just helping the story along.\\" Kelly: \\"When we were writing Pulling, we wanted to make sure the comedy was with the women. Even with comedies that are about women, it's often the blokes who get the funnies. In Pulling we even err too much the other way and make the men too two-dimensional. But it was important for the women to get the funny lines.\\" The main characters are : ===Donna=== * She is in a five-year relationship with Karl, to whom she is engaged. * 29 years old at the start of the series. * Works in an office. ===Louise=== * Naive, unrealistically hopeful. * Works in a cafe * Happens to find herself in bizarre situations, e.g. meeting up with voyeurs in a carpark believing it to be a dating site, and stalking a man who frequents her cafe. ===Karen=== * Heavy drinker. * Promiscuous, outgoing, chaotic and aggressive. * A primary school teacher who is not suited to her job. * Several years older than Donna and Louise. ==Series 1== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:98%;\\" - ! width=\\"20\\"# !!

Ramokgwebana lies at the northern end of the only railway line in Botswana, which runs from Ramatlabama on the South African border north through Lobatse, Gaborone, Pilane, Mahalapye, Palapye, Serule, and Francistown. Trains once ran along this line from Johannesburg to Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, but that service no longer operates.

It is officially recognised as a locality by LINZ. The 2018 New Zealand census gave Glentunnel's population as 1,191. It is located on State Highway 77 and the tourist route Inland Scenic Route 72. Glentunnel is 260 meters above sea- level. == History  1800's-2000's === Glentunnel was served by the Whitecliffs Branch, a branch line railway, from the line's opening on 3 November 1875 through to its closure on 31 March 1962. However, the station was not open until 22 April 1876. Few remnants of the railway remain in the town, with the station's platform incorporated into the backyard of a private residence.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 71-2. An Anglican church used to be situated on the corner of State Highway 77 and Victoria Street, but it caught fire and was demolished. These grounds have also been incorporated into a private residence. === 2010 Canterbury earthquake === The historic Homebush Homestead, located four kilometres east from Glentunnel was extensively damaged by the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, so much so that it has been described as being \\"practically in ruins\\". It was later demolished and a new homestead was built on the same site. Five kilometres south in Hororata, the historic St John's Church, built in 1911 had its bell tower partially collapsed, causing damage to the nave and destroying the organ. == Education == Glentunnel Primary School is Glentunnel's sole primary school. == Industry == Industrial activity such as lignite coal mining and the manufacture of pottery and bricks used to take place in the region around Glentunnel. This was the reason the railway was built, but activity declined sharply in the 20th century and has been effectively non-existent since the 1980s. However, one open-pit coal mine is still operated by Bathurst coal Ltd. == Services == Glentunnel has a general store. Two churches are also located here: a Brethren Church and a combined denominational church of Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian. Caf√©s, a community centre, garage, library, museum, playground and a post office are also located in the town. === Recreation === Glentunnel has many recreational walkways. These include the River Walk, a walkway that follows the Selwyn River from the camping ground to the one-lane bridge at the western end of Glentunnel, and the Millennium Walkway, which follows a now, non-existent tramway route up to the disused tunnel which gave the township its name. This walkway was opened in 2000. Glentunnel also has a domain, where cricket, football or rugby can be played. To the south of the domain is the Glentunnel camping ground, which is popular during the summer months for its location next to the Selwyn River. Adjacent to the domain is the Hororata Golf Club. == Gallery == St Andrews of the Glen, Glentunnel.jpgSt Andrews of the Glen Glentunnel Library and Post Office.jpgHistoric octagonal brick library and post office.

In 1899 he married Bertha Chitz. In 1890 he began to study jurisprudence and philosophy under Friedrich Jodl and Anton Marty, who introduced him into Franz Brentano's philosophy. Kraus made his Doctor of Philosophy in 1895 and attained the habilitation in philosophy in 1902. In 1909 he became Professor extraordinarius and in 1916 Professor ordinarius. After the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia in 1939, Kraus was put into a concentration camp; however, after he was released he fled to Great Britain. At the University Edinburgh he held Gifford Lectures in 1941. In 1942 he died, aged 70, in Oxford, of cancer.Gifford Lectures: Oskar Kraus , (Publications taken from this source) Family: *Wally Oskarovich Kraus (1930 ‚Äì 21 October 1981) ‚Äî son, died in an accident *Yuriy Voldemarovich Kraus (b. 30 March 1966 in Tallinn) ==Work== During World War I, Kraus worked on topics in relation to war and ethics and wrote important works in the field of public international law. Influenced by Brentano, Kraus developed an a priori value theory, which was formulated in opposition to Marxian value theory. He also applied this method on economics. Based on his ideas on law and duty he developed a juristic hermeneutics in the field of jurisprudence, and criticized historism and positivism. Kraus was also known for his criticism of the theory of relativity, which was according to him an accumulation of \\"absurdities\\" (like the constancy of the speed of light) and \\"mathematical fictions\\". ==References Publications == * Das Bed√ºrfnis.

However, all its rapid and some local trains continue westwards to end at using the Dosan Line tracks. ==Layout== The station consists of two island platforms serving four tracks. Track/platform 0 (a siding) and track/platform 1 (bidirectional) is used by Asa Line trains while tracks/platforms 2 and 3 (both bidirectional) are used by Dosan Line trains. A passing loop runs alongside track 3. The present station building is a structure where passenger facilities are located on a bridge which spans the tracks. The station entrance is on the south side of the tracks from where elevators and stairs lead to the bridge structure on level 2 which houses ticket gates, a waiting area and a JR ticket window (with a Midori no Madoguchi facility) and a JR travel centre (Warp Plaza).

Players, also known as fantasy team owners, select a roster of drivers to earn points according to actual race results. Player scores, as determined by their drivers' actual racing results, are sorted within a league of players to determine weekly, periodic and championship winners. Games can be free or pay- to-play with cash or merchandise as prizes. Inspired by the popularity of Fantasy football, American fantasy auto racing games began in the late 1980s but didn't become popular until the advent of the internet. Games are usually based on activities and race results from the most popular, broadcast-live forms of motor sports like Formula One, NASCAR, IndyCar, Daytona Prototype and the American Le Mans Series racing. Fantasy auto racing games can be run season-long, from Winter Speed Weeks at Daytona through the last major race weekend of the season, or they are segmented to award quarterly prizes and attract new players throughout the year. Fantasy racing rules, formats and point systems vary widely. Most American games follow NASCAR Cup racing and award driver points based on the official NASCAR points system. To reduce the likelihood of ties, game rules can restrict driver starts according to criteria based on salary caps, driver rankings or frequency of selection. Games that follow one specific series combine driver or roster salary caps with a point system based on predictions for driver pit strategy, advancement or retreat from starting position, fastest lap or qualifying performance. Other games follow the results of all the top stock car racing, open wheel racing, drag racing and sports car racing series and require players to pick at least one driver from each race per weekend in filling out a seven driver roster. For 2018, Yahoo Sports will no longer offer Fantasy Auto Racing, providing the following message to users: \\"The Yahoo Sports Fantasy Auto Racing season has concluded. Thank you for your participation this year and congratulations to all the winners. We will not be offering Fantasy Auto Racing in 2018. We thank you very much for playing our game over the years and hope you will continue to play our other fantasy games.\\" ==NASCAR Fantasy Live== NASCAR Fantasy Live allows fantasy owners to select 5 drivers per race. Each driver is given points based on their finishing position, place differential, pass differential, laps led, and fastest laps. ===Driver Selection=== Owners are given a salary cap of $100 each week to select their team. Drivers' salaries are adjusted on Wednesdays before the next weekend's race. ===Points=== Finishing position awards points as follows: 1st = 43, 2nd = 42, 3rd = 41,...43rd = 1 Place differential points are determined by the number of positions a driver gains or loses from their starting position. For example, if a driver starts on pole and finishes 12th, that driver will be penalized -11 points. However, if that driver started 12th and finishes 1st, the driver will be awarded +11 points. Pass differential points are determined based on the number of green flag passes and driver has minus the number of times the driver was passed under green. Pass differential can also penalize drivers with negative points. Laps led points are determined by dividing the number of laps a driver led by 2. Fastest laps points are determined by dividing the number of fastest laps a driver had by 2.http://fantasygames.nascar.com/live/pages/how_to_play ==Yahoo Fantasy Racing== Yahoo's point structure is depicted in the tables below. A driver can only be used 9 times each season by an owner. Additionally, drivers are ranked each week in 3 tiers (A, B, and C). Tiers A and C, owners select 1 starter and 1 bench driver. For Tier B, owners select 2 starters and 2 bench drivers. Driver selection deadline is 2:00 a.m. PT on the day of qualifying. After this deadline, owners are able to replace their starter drivers with their bench drivers up to 5 minutes prior to race start. ===Driver Selection=== Yahoo does not use a salary cap to structure its driver selection. Instead, it uses a 3 tiered system (A, B, & C) that is ranked each week. Owners select 1 starter and 1 bench driver for tiers A and C. For tier B, owners select 2 starters and 2 bench drivers. ===Points=== A driver that in on pole earns 10 points, followed by 5 for 2nd, 3 for 3rd, and 1 for 4th. Drivers that qualify below 4th do not earn qualifying points. Finishing points are determined as follows: 1st = 90, 2nd = 88, 3rd = 86,...43rd = 6 Leading a lap earns a driver 10 points and leading the most laps adds an additional 10 points.http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/sports/fantasysports/racing/rules/?pir=fQ8svbNibUkwkxpjS07Q3caA8PA.FFWdsxjRW91CpUidiKgC7Zo_AvSwVWbCVBt4nYsQuV1p ==Wind Tunnel Super 7 Sweep== SPEED's Wind Tunnel Super 7 Sweep follows seven different series: NASCAR Sprint Cup, Nationwide and Camping World Trucks; Formula 1, IndyCar, American Le Mans Series and Grand-Am Rolex. Players select a roster of seven starters before each weekend's races and they must select at least one driver or car (for the sports car races) per scheduled race. Lineups are due by 12:00 am on the day of each weekend's first race. ===Driver Selection=== Players select from a collection of all known potential entries per series; starter lists do not reflect official entry lists. Players must select at least one starter per each race each weekend in order to complete their full seven starter roster. There are no tiers, salary caps or other restrictions on selecting starters. ===Points=== Points are awarded to the top 16 finishers per race. Points are awarded by finish position, qualifying performance and whether the car or driver led one lap or the most laps. Points are also awarded to the highest finishing driver or car per manufacturer; no bonus points are awarded to drivers that finish lower than 16th and it is possible for a driver who finishes behind another to score more points. ==NASCAR Fantasy Live vs. Yahoo Fantasy Racing== The most notable difference between Yahoo and NASCAR Fantasy Live is the way finishing position is weighted. Yahoo places a greater emphasis on finishing than NASCAR Fantasy Live. For example, a driver who qualifies in the top 5, but slips to the mid 20s during the race and never recovers can have a negative point total in NASCAR Fantasy Live. Alternatively, in Yahoo‚Äôs format that driver would likely have around 50 points or about 50% of the points that the race winner would likely have. Another difference between the two formats is that Yahoo requires owners to lock in their drivers before qualifying. NASCAR Fantasy Live places a strong emphasis on place differential. It is important to understand the upside and downside risk that starting position affects. For example, the average points for position differential when starting 1st are -11.6. Conversely, starting 43rd has an average of +9.2 for position differential. Another important point scoring category is passing differential. This category is strongly correlated to who the driver is than it is to starting position. While finishing points are typically the largest point contributor to total points in NASCAR Fantasy Live, place and passing differentials collectively can often provide a driver with more points than simply finishing 1st. ==Super 7 Sweep vs. NASCAR Cup games== The Super 7 Sweep is based on a game that was developed to mimic fantasy football games; i.e. fantasy team owners would start weekly lineups with NFL players at different gridiron positions. In that respect the NASCAR game participants are only concerned with quarterbacks, e.g. Sprint Cup drivers. Super 7 Sweep players select QBs plus running backs, receivers, kickers and defenses; i.e. NNS and Camping World Truck drivers, IndyCar and Formula 1 drivers, ALMS and Rolex Series sports cars. Most NASCAR games are for Sprint Cup fans exclusively while Super 7 Sweep -type games appeal to motorsports fans who are aware and interested in other series as well. The Super 7 Sweep persuades players to follow the results and activities of those other series in order to score maximum points. ==References== Category:Fantasy sports ","title":"Fantasy auto racing"},{"id":"6226882","text":"is a JR West railway station located in Masuda, Shimane Prefecture, Japan.

In 1386 a war broke out between Algirdas' sons, Skirgaila and Andrei of Polotsk. The latter fled from Polotsk to Smolensk and asked Yury's father for help. The armies of Smolensk and Skirgaila clashed near Mstislavl in the Battle of the Vikhra River. After Yury's father was killed in battle and his brothers were taken prisoner, the Lithuanians approached Smolensk and allowed Yury to assume the throne on certain conditions, after exacting a sizable indemnity from him. In 1395, while Yury was visiting his father-in-law, Oleg Korotopol of Ryazan, Grand Duke Vytautas the Great (Vitovt) of Lithuania took Smolensk and installed his governor there. Four years later, Vytautas was routed by the Tatars in the Battle of the Vorskla River. In 1401, Yury and Oleg made use of his plight to retake Smolensk and Bryansk, where the pro-Lithuanian boyars were promptly executed. In fall 1401, Vytautas laid siege to Smolensk but was forced to retreat after signing an armistice. Two years later, Smolensk withstood a two-week siege by Vytautas. Solicitous to preclude a new attack, Yury went to the Grand Duchy of Moscow to ask Vasily I for help against Vytautas (who was Vasily's father-in- law). Although Yury promised to bequeath his possessions to Vasily, the Muscovite ruler hesitated to accept this proposal, until the boyars of Smolensk opened the city gates to Vytautas and surrendered Yury's capital to his old enemy in 1404. Thus Smolensk was lost to Russians for more than a century. As Vasily was eager to accuse Yury of shortsightedness, the latter left Moscow and proceeded with his son to Novgorod, where he was treated honourably and was given an appanage of thirteen towns, including Porkhov and Tiversk. In 1406, he returned to Moscow, reconciled himself with Vasily and was sent to govern Torzhok in his name. While there, he attempted to seduce the wife of his cousin, Prince Semyon of Vyazma. When she refused his advances, Yury killed her and her husband and, afraid of the imminent punishment, fled to the Golden Horde, where he died soon thereafter, in 1407. Yury had two daughters, Anastasia, wife of Grand Duke ≈†vitrigaila of Lithuania, and Elena, wife of Yury of Zvenigorod and mother of the famous Dmitry Shemyaka. He also had a son Fedor who joined the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in 1412. == References == Category:Princes of Smolensk Category:1407 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Rostislavichi family (Smolensk) ","title":"Yury of Smolensk"},{"id":"6226989","text":"Morndi or Billy Munro was the last fluent speaker of the Unggumi language of Western Australia. ==References== * Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:1990s deaths Category:Indigenous Australians from Western Australia Category:Last known speakers of an Australian Aboriginal language ","title":"Morndi Munro"},{"id":"6227001","text":"Liverpool Hospitalite badge The Liverpool Hospitalit√© is a voluntary organisation associated with the annual Liverpool Archdiocesan Pilgrimage to Lourdes. The Hospitalit√© of Our Lady of Lourdes (Liverpool Branch) spend their pilgrimage caring for those who need support both while travelling and whilst in Lourdes. They also provide support for registered sick and disabled pilgrims who are able to stay in hotels. Like all Hospitalit√©s of Lourdes it is connected to the shrine's own Hospitalit√© Notre Dame de Lourdes. The first official Liverpool Pilgrimage took place in 1923, during which Mr Jack Traynor, a man with severe war wounds, was spontaneously cured. He lived to return to Lourdes acting as a Brancardier many times and was one of the pre- war Presidents of the Brancardiers Association. Until November 1927, when Liverpool Association of Handmaids was formed, the volunteers to help the nursing staff with the care and transportation of the sick pilgrims were obtained by simply appealing to actual pilgrims either just before departure or in Lourdes itself. With the ever increasing numbers of sick cases it was realised that a permanent organisation of voluntary helpers who would be prepared to work in raising funds and to go as often as possible with the Liverpool Pilgrimage was needed. The Association came into being at a meeting held in St John's Hall, Kirkdale in November 1927 and so regular work in assisting with the Pilgrimage on a year-round basis began. During 1928 the Confraternity of the Hospitalit√© of Lourdes was raised by the Pope to the rank of an Archconfraternity with the power to affiliate similar diocesan organisations and in July 1928 a petition was sent to Lourdes for affiliation of the Liverpool Association. This was granted and so all our registered members are entitled to gain the indulgences of the Archconfraternity. Hospitalite service medal In the years of World War II there were no Pilgrimages and the opportunity was taken after consultation with the Lourdes Hospitalit√© to revise the constitutions of the Brancardiers and the Handmaids Associations. The new constitutions were approved and signed by the Archbishop of Liverpool on May 14. 1948, with subsequent revision in 1974. In 1998 the constitution was comprehensively amended and this combined Brancardier and Handmaid associations. Hospitalit√© members are all now known as Hospitaliers The Hospitalit√© present their members with service medals. After three years service a Hospitalier will receive a heart shaped medal with a blue bar, after five this will be replaced by one with a red bar and for 10 years service a yellow bar is received. These medals are not worn as a decoration - they are merely to indicate the level of experience that member has. This is reflected by the fact that there are no further medals received after 10 years despite some members having served with the Hospitalit√© for as many as fifty or more pilgrimages. ==Related== *Hospitalit√© Notre Dame de Lourdes *Catholic Association Pilgrimage *Liverpool Archdiocese ==External links== * Liverpool Hospitalit√© official webpage Category:Hospitalit√©s of Lourdes ","title":"Liverpool hospitalit√©"},{"id":"6227008","text":"Henning Kraggerud (born 23 June 1973) is a Norwegian musician and composer. == Career == Kraggerud was born in Oslo.

Like many other terpenes, boswellic acids appear in the resin of the plant that exudes them; it is estimated that they make up 30% of the resin of Boswellia serrata. While boswellic acids are a major component of the resin, the steam or hydro distilled frankincense essential oil does not contain any boswellic acid as these components are non-volatile and too large to come over in the steam distillation process (the essential oil is composed mainly of the much lighter monoterpene and sesquiterpene molecules with small amounts of diterpenoid components being the upper limit in terms of molecular weight). ==Structure== The boswellic acids are organic acids, consisting of a pentacyclic triterpene, a carboxyl group and at least one other functional group. Alpha-boswellic acid and beta-boswellic acid, C30H48O3 both have an additional hydroxyl group; they differ only in their triterpene structure. Acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid and acetyl-beta-boswellic acid, C32H50O4, replace the hydroxyl group with an acetyl group. Other boswellic acids include the keto-boswellic acids and their acetyl counterparts. ==Uses== Beta-boswellic acid, keto-beta-boswellic acid, and acetyl-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) have been indicated in apoptosis of cancer cells, in particular brain tumors and cells affected by leukemia or colon cancer. Acetyl-boswellic acids also exhibit anti-inflammatory behaviour by inhibiting leukotriene synthesis. It inhibits the activity of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase through a non-redox reaction. Specifically the 3-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid binds as an allosteric partial inhibitor, initiating a shift in regioselectivity of the catalyzed reation. Clinical trials have investigated the effectiveness of boswellic acids in treating ulcerative colitis, but a study on chemically induced colitis in mouse models showed little effectiveness. A latter study showed that low doses of Boswellia serrata extract may have hepatoprotective effects. The higher dose was found to have a milder hepatoprotective effect than the lower dose. Boswellic acids are also thought to decrease the symptoms of asthma; a small 1998 placebo-controlled trial of Boswellia extract for the treatment of asthma showed good results. Boswellia extracts are sold in tablet, capsule and tincture form, but no dosage guidelines have been developed. The risk of hepatotoxicity due to Boswellia administration has not been assessed. ==References *Lipid Molecular Structure Database * Category:Triterpenes Category:Beta hydroxy acids ","title":"Boswellic acid"},{"id":"6227028","text":"is a railway station in Minami-ku, Hiroshima, Japan, operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). Hiroshima Station is the terminal station for several lines, and all San'y≈ç Shinkansen trains stop here. ==Station layout== The former south entrance of Hiroshima Station, now permanently closed. Hiroshima Station has two main entrances: the north ‚Äî or Shinkansen ‚Äî entrance, and the south entrance. Until the 1975 opening of the Shinkansen service, the Shinkansen entrance was called the \\"north entrance\\", and many local residents, newspapers, and real estate advertisements continue to refer to it as the \\"north entrance\\". A pedestrian tunnel connects the area in front of the Shinkansen entrance to an underground plaza underneath the south entrance to Hiroshima Station. The tunnel includes many gift shops and restaurants, as well as two exits to Fukuya, one to the Hiroshima Station Tram Stop, one in front of the Hiroshima Higashi Post Office, and one directly in front of the south entrance to Hiroshima Station. Elevator and escalator access is available for several of the entrances. Events are sometimes held in the large area of the underground plaza in front of the entrance to Fukuya. Prior to 2017, the south entrance connected the plaza outside directly to the platform for track 1; passengers wishing to access any other track from the south entrance were forced to first enter onto the track 1 platform and then ascend to the concourse above. Similarly, passengers wishing to exit the south entrance after arriving on any other platform were forced to descend from the concourse level to the track 1 platform to exit. To eliminate this bottleneck, the concourse level was expanded and a new south entrance was added slightly to the east of the old one. This design, which is standard for major Japanese rail stations, enables direct access to the concourse level from the south entrance. The new south entrance of the station was opened on May 28, 2017, and the old south entrance was permanently closed. ===Platforms=== Shinkansen at Hiroshima Station Platform sign at Hiroshima Station, between Tenjingawa and Shin-Hakushima Stations The Shinkansen station has two island platforms which serve a total of four tracks.

In 1766 Boch was licensed to build a ceramics kilnworks nearby at Septfontaines, Luxembourg, where it operated a porcelain factory. In 1785 Nicolas Villeroy became sole owner of the faience manufactory at Wallerfangen. In 1812 Jean-Fran√ßois Boch began construction of kilns at the nearby town of Mettlach, Saarland. In 1824 Boch commenced transfer printing on porcelain from engraved copper plates. On 14 April 1836, the Jean Fran√ßois Boch company merged with that of the competitor, Nicolas Villeroy, and became Villeroy & Boch, (V&B;, also simply 'VB'). In 1869, Villeroy & Boch opened the first manufactory specializing in architectural tiles. The company is today operating in two divisions: Tableware, and Bathroom and Wellness. The Tiles division became a separate company (V&B; Fliesen GmbH) in 2006. In 2007 the Villeroy & Boch AG sold 51% of the V&B; Fliesen GmbH to the (Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ± Holding). Today there is only a 2.29% holding in the share capital of V&B; Fliesen GmbH. Among its innovations in Mettlach at the end of the nineteenth century was Phanolith, a kind of semi-transparent porcelain that combines the characteristics and benefits of jasperware and pate-sur-pate. The creator of the Phanolith was the ceramics artist Jean-Baptiste Stahl, who headed the modelling section of Villeroy & Boch. Phanolith gained first wide public attention at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1900). Villeroy & Boch has continued to base its broadest market in Germany. == Technology == TitanCeram is a special compound of clay, quartz, feldspar and titanium dioxide which, in combination with special production steps, makes it possible to create exceptionally precise shapes without sacrificing durability.

Seahorses are members of the family Syngnathidae, and are teleost fishes. They are found in southeast Australia and New Zealand, and are listed on Appendix II of CITES. == Habitat == The big-belly seahorse is found among algae, seagrasses, and rocky reefs in shallow water, and attached to sponges and colonial hydroids in deeper areas. They also attach to jetty piles and other manmade objects, and can be found in estuaries. They usually inhabit waters less than deep, but have been found as deep as .Lourie, S. A., Foster, S. J., Cooper, E. W. T. and Vincent, A. C. J. 2004. A Guide to the Identification of Seahorses. Project Seahorse and TRAFFIC. 114 pp. Juveniles are pelagic or attached to drifting seaweed. == Description == Pot- bellied seahorses, Shedd Aquarium The big-belly seahorse has a forward-tilted, a long-snouted head, a distended but narrow pot belly, and a long, coiled tail. It swims using its dorsal fin with a vertical stance; when not swimming, it coils its prehensile tail around any suitable growth, such as seaweed, waiting for planktonic animals to drift by, when they are sucked up by the small mouth set at the tip of the snout much like a vacuum cleaner. Seahorses are voracious feeders, eating mainly crustaceans, such as shrimp, and other small animals living among the seaweed, such as copepods and amphipods. They do not chew, so they can eat to excess because of their small gut tract. Each eye moves separately, making it easier for them to see food and predators. Distinguishing males from females is easy: The male has a smooth, soft, pouch- like area at the base of its abdomen where the stomach meets the tail on the front side. Males also have a fin there, but it is less obvious. The female has more of a pointed stomach with a very obvious fin at the base of it. == Reproduction == In the wild, breeding can commence when the seahorses are about one year old, and this can be reduced to about eight months when in captivity. Breeding in big-belly seahorses year-round, with peaks in the warmer months. Courtship initiation involves a series of colour changes and postural displays. Dilating the opening of the brood pouch slightly, the male inflates the pouch to balloon-like proportions with water by swimming forwards, or by pushing his body forwards in a pumping action, then closing the pouch opening. At the same time, he lightens his pouch in colour to white or light yellow. The male also brightens his overall body colouration, typically intensifying the yellow. A male repeatedly approaches his selected female with his head tucked down, and dorsal and pectoral fins rapidly fluttering. A dried big-belly seahorse specimen If the female is not receptive, she ignores the male, which then looks for another potential mate. If no females are receptive, the male stops displaying and deflates the pouch by dilating the pouch opening and bending forwards, expelling the water inside. If a female is receptive to a courting male, she reciprocates with her own color changes and head tucking, typically intensifying the lighter colours such as yellow and white, highlighting the contrast between these colours and her overall darker blotching and banding patterning. A series of short bursts of swimming together in tandem then ensues, sometimes with tails entwined, or with the female tightly rolling her tail up. This has often been described as ‚Äòdancing‚Äô. After coming to rest, the male attempts to get the female to swim towards the water surface with him by repeatedly pointing his snout upwards. If the female responds by also pointing her snout upwards, then the final stage of courtship follows. This involves both the male and female swimming directly upwards towards the water surface with both their heads pointing upwards and tails pointing straight down. If they reach the water surface, one or both seahorses can often be seen and heard to snap their heads. To transfer her eggs to the male, the female faces the male, slightly above him. Pressing the base of her abdomen against the male's pouch, she then squirts her eggs through the opening in the front of his dilated pouch. The male seahorse brood 300-700 young at a time, and can have up to four broods in summer. Their colouring is a variable shade of brown, mottled with yellow-brown and with darker splotches. The tail is often circled with yellow bands. In deeper water where the tail is anchored to other colourful forms of life, such as sponges and hydroids, they often take on these colours. == Aquaculture == The big- belly seahorse is a popular aquarium species and dried specimens are sold as traditional medicine in Asia. Stocks come from the wild or are aquarium- reared. They are easy to keep in aquariums and feed on small shrimp and crustaceans. H. Abdominalis.jpg H. Abdominalis -2.jpg == References == * A. B.

In 1822 Wilson jointly founded Thomas Wilson Sons & Co., commonly known as the Wilson Line, a shipping company. ==Wilson Line== Thomas Wilson founded Beckington, Wilson and Company in 1822 as a joint venture with his partner John Beckinton and two others. He did not come to the business with a background in shipping but through the use of ships for shipping of ore he quickly saw the potential opportunity and became a noted specialist shipowner. By 1825 he owned his first steam ship and saw the company become a prominent figure in promoting the Port of Hull to the third largest port in United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland during the emergence and rise of steam shipping in Britain. In 1841 Thomas Wilson took full control of the company, after the other partners left, and so he brought his eldest son David into the business as his partner, making the name Thomas Wilson & Son Ltd. In 1850 his other sons Charles and Arthur joined and became active partners, the name changing to Thomas Wilson & Sons Co Ltd, though usually known as the Wilson Line of Hull. Thomas died in 1869 and the company was taken over by Charles and Arthur, with David as silent partner. A few years later when they were beginning to question their own sons ability to continue running the firm, Charles and Arthur brought in a non-family member to become the new Managing Director, Oswald Sanderson. Parts of the company merged with the North Eastern Railway forming Wilson's & North Eastern Railway Shipping Co. Ltd; the majority was acquired in 1916 by Sir John Ellerman and renamed Ellerman's Wilson Line. ==Family== Thomas was the son of David Wilson (1745‚Äì1810) and Elizabeth n√©e Gray (born c. 1750).

Evans, \\"Otto Frankel 1900‚Äì1998\\", Biographical memoirs, www.science.org.au. Originally published in Historical Records of Australian Science, vol.12, no.4, 1999.\\"Frankel, Otto Herzberg (1900‚Äì1998)\\", Biographical entry, Encyclopaedia of Australian Science. In the 1960s and 1970s he was among the first to warn of the dangers of plant biodiversity loss. == Early life and family == Otto Herzberg-Frankel was the third of four sons of a prominent and wealthy lawyer. Otto's paternal grandfather, a well-known author, added Herzberg from his mother's name to become Herzberg-Frankel. After his father's death, Otto dropped the hyphen. Ludwig Herzberg-Frankel, Otto's father, was a highly successful barrister in Vienna. He was related to Lewis Namier, who played a significant role in Otto's career. Max, Otto's oldest brother (1895‚Äì1983), qualified in law but after joining Otto in New Zealand in 1938 he became an accountant. Theo (1897‚Äì1986), who had to flee Vienna hurriedly in 1938, became a progressive paper manufacturer in Great Britain, establishing the Scottish Pulp and Paper Mills enterprise in the Scottish Highlands. Paul (1903‚Äì1992) also moved to Britain, from Poland in 1937. An economist by training, he founded Petroleum Economics Ltd. in 1955 and became a distinguished international authority on the oil industry. In Otto's early years, his father employed a tutor for his sons as well as a French governess. From 1910 to 1918 Otto attended the Piaristen Staatsgymnasiums Wien VIII, where he met Karl Popper. Otto claimed to have had no education, as this was a classical rather than a modern school, with poor mathematics and next to no science but eight years of Latin and four of Greek. None of his teachers inspired him. == University education == The end of school coincided with the end of World War I, when there was little chance of a young man without military service being admitted to the University of Vienna. However, under Otto's leadership, a group of young people took over a disused military laboratory, got a copy of the practical course work from the Chemical Institute of the University, worked through it together without any lectures and subsequently gained credit for the course. Otto then went to University of Munich to be interviewed by the professor of chemistry there, Richard Willst√§tter. He was admitted to the university (1919‚Äì1920) to study chemistry, botany and physics. However, after three semesters he lost his enthusiasm for chemistry, preferring something more practical like agriculture. He went to the Agricultural Institute of the University of Giessen and he studied there under Professor Paul Gisevius for two semesters in 1920/21. Otto disliked him and left. His aunt persuaded him to go back to university, with her support. In the autumn of 1922 he joined at the Agricultural University of Berlin, having been given credit for his earlier studies in Vienna, Munich and Giessen, as well as for his practical work on his family's farm. He attended a lecture on plant genetics by Professor Erwin Baur. He was challenged by Baur's claim to be able to work with genes and the genetic combinations of plants exactly like the chemist with his molecules and his formulae. Otto asked Baur in 1923 if he could begin research under him before his diploma was completed. His research problem was one of the earliest studies of genetic linkage in plants. Baur suggested that he clarify the linkage relations between one specific mutant (A, fuchsin red) and another nine mutants in Antirrhinum majus, the common snap dragon. In this Otto was unlucky because, after an extensive crossing and back-crossing programme, he found that all but one of the mutations segregated independently of A, and to a large extent of one another. However, the introduction to his thesis was a comprehensive review of linkage in plants that brought high praise from Baur and earned his doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1925. == Career == Otto worked for two years (1925‚Äì1927) as a plant breeder on a large private estate at Dioseg, near Bratislava. Lewis Namier persuaded Otto to emigrate to Palestine to help establish a plant and animal breeding programme there and to act as a bridge between the Zionist Organization and the Empire Marketing Board under the direction of John Boyd Orr. There, Otto began his cytological career by counting the chromosomes of the Jaffa orange. He did not like Palestine and moved to England. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1953. ==Conservation of Biodiversity== Beginning in 1964 Frankel worked as a member of the International Biological Program (IBP) focusing on the issue of genetic resources. ('Genetic resources' is a term coined by Frankel and Erna Bennett after a nearly all night brainstorming session to find a neutral term at the 2nd International Conference (1967) on Crop Plant Exploration and Conservation, FAO, Rome).Wilkes, G., 2007.

Maydica, 52(1) In this role, he chaired a joint committee of experts the UN Food and Agriculture Organization organised several international conferences, and worked to raise awareness of the issue of biodiversity loss among scientists, the international community, and the public. In 1981 he co-wrote the book 'Conservation and Evolution' with Michael E. Soul√©. In 1995 he co-wrote the book 'The conservation of plant biodiversity' with Anthony H. D. Brown and Jeremy James Burdon. ==References *Australian Academy of Sciences Category:1900 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Austrian emigrants to Australia Category:Austrian scientists Category:Australian people of Austrian-Jewish descent Category:Australian geneticists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science Category:Farrer Medal recipients Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of New Zealand Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences ","title":"Otto Frankel"},{"id":"6227135","text":"Fukui Station is the name of multiple train stations in Japan. * Fukui Station (Fukui) - (Á¶è‰∫ïÈßÖ) in Fukui Prefecture * Fukui Station (Okayama) - (Á¶è‰∫ïÈßÖ) in Okayama Prefecture * Fukui Station (Tochigi) - (Á¶èÂ±ÖÈßÖ) in Tochigi Prefecture ","title":"Fukui Station"},{"id":"6227145","text":"Computer-assisted reviewing (CAR) tools are pieces of software based on text- comparison and analysis algorithms.

Prior to the 2016 update to Version 5.0, the program was one-dimensional, meaning that there is no direct modeling of the hydraulic effect of cross section shape changes, bends, and other two- and three-dimensional aspects of flow. The release of Version 5.0 introduced two-dimensional modeling of flow as well as sediment transfer modeling capabilities. The program was developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in order to manage the rivers, harbors, and other public works under their jurisdiction; it has found wide acceptance by many others since its public release in 1995. The Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) in Davis, California, developed the River Analysis System (RAS) to aid hydraulic engineers in channel flow analysis and floodplain determination. It includes numerous data entry capabilities, hydraulic analysis components, data storage and management capabilities, and graphing and reporting capabilities. == Functionality == The basic computational procedure of HEC-RAS for steady flow is based on the solution of the one-dimensional energy equation. Energy losses are evaluated by friction and contraction / expansion. The momentum equation may be used in situations where the water surface profile is rapidly varied. These situations include hydraulic jumps, hydraulics of bridges, and evaluating profiles at river confluences. For unsteady flow, HEC-RAS solves the full, dynamic, 1-D Saint Venant Equation using an implicit, finite difference method. The unsteady flow equation solver was adapted from Dr. Robert L. Barkau's UNET package. HEC-RAS is equipped to model a network of channels, a dendritic system or a single river reach. Certain simplifications must be made in order to model some complex flow situations using the HEC-RAS one-dimensional approach. It is capable of modeling subcritical, supercritical, and mixed flow regime flow along with the effects of bridges, culverts, weirs, and structures. Version 5.0.7 as of March 2019 supports Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 64-bit only.https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/documentation/HEC- RAS_5.0.7_Release_Notes.pdf == Usages == HEC-RAS is a computer program for modeling water flowing through systems of open channels and computing water surface profiles. HEC-RAS finds particular commercial application in floodplain management and [flood insurance] studies to evaluate floodway encroachments. Some of the additional uses are: bridge and culvert design and analysis, levee studies, and channel modification studies. It can be used for dam breach analysis, though other modeling methods are presently more widely accepted for this purpose. == Advantages == HEC-RAS has merits, notably its support by the US Army Corps of Engineers, the future enhancements in progress, and its acceptance by many government agencies and private firms. It is in the public domain and peer-reviewed, and available to download free of charge from HEC's web site. Various private companies are registered as official \\"vendors\\" and offer consulting services and add-on software. Some also distribute the software in countries that are not permitted to access US Army web sites. However, the direct download from HEC includes extensive documentation, and scientists and engineers versed in hydraulic analysis should have little difficulty utilizing the software. == Disadvantages == Users may find numerical instability problems during unsteady analyses, especially in steep and/or highly dynamic rivers and streams. It is often possible to use HEC-RAS to overcome instability issues on river problems. == Version history == The first version of HEC-RAS was released in 1995. This HEC-RAS 1.0 solves the same numerical equation of the 1968 HEC-2. {  - ! Version !

Features related to HEC-RAS include: * Undo and redo HEC- RAS editing * Multiple document interface (MDI) of HEC-RAS projects * Use of AutoCAD and MicroStation CAD drawings and terrain surfaces * Use of GIS databases * Automated cross section generation * Automated production of floodplain maps * Design and analysis of roadway crossings (bridge and culvert) * Adaptive 2D mesh generation that extends HEC-RAS' rectangular (structured) mesh == WMS == WMS (watershed modeling system) is a hydrology software that provides pre and post-processing tools for use with HEC-RAS. The development of WMS by Aquaveo was funded primarily by The United States Army Corps of Engineers. Features related to HEC-RAS include: * Using feature objects (centerline, cross section lines) and a TIN to develop the geometry of a HEC-RAS model. * Editing, merging, and creating cross sections in a database for use with HEC-RAS and other hydraulic models. * Delineating flood plains from water surface elevation data. Water surface elevations can be computed by HEC-RAS, defined interactively, or imported from a file. * Linking multiple simulations of HEC-1 to HEC-RAS to determine the uncertainty in modeling parameters on a delineated flood plain. Curve Number and Precipitation can be stochastically varied among HEC-1 parameters and Manning's n value for HEC- RAS. ==See also== *Hydraulic engineering ==References External links == *HEC-RAS home page at the US Army Corps of Engineers, Hydrologic Engineering Center * An output video of a flood analysis done with HEC-RAS and visualization in ArcGIS Category:Hydraulic engineering Category:Scientific simulation software Category:Hydrology software ","title":"HEC-RAS"},{"id":"6227152","text":"Colonel William Kelsey Lanman Jr., (October 9, 1904 ‚Äì March 27, 2001) was an American philanthropist and benefactor of Yale University. He served as an aviator in the United States Marine Corps from 1935 to 1955, and later took up real estate and investment management. His father, William K. Lanman Sr., was chairman of the Columbus Bolt Company in Ohio. William K. Lanman Jr. graduated from Yale University in 1928 (B.S. from Sheffield Scientific School), as had his ancestor United States Senator James Lanman, who graduated from Yale College in 1788. Colonel Lanman's two brothers graduated from Yale College: Henry Reese Lanman in 1932, and Jonathan Trumbull Lanman in 1940 and from the Yale School of Medicine in 1943. Colonel Lanman was a member of St. Anthony Hall. ==Naval career== Lanman was also a United States Naval Aviator, graduating from the Naval Aviation School in 1931. He served in the Pacific theater during World War II, with South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command (SCAT) where he was executive officer of the legendary World War II \\"Flying Boxcar\\" SCAT squadron. He won the Distinguished Flying Cross, four Air Medals, a Bronze Star and a U.S. Navy Commendation for action in the Solomon Islands campaigns. In 1949 he was commissioned Colonel. ==Yale benefactor== Grave at Arlington National Cemetery Lanman made a series of major gifts to Yale, reported to total $40 million. He funded major renovation projects and endowed several chairs, in Economics, Sociology, Computer Science, International Studies, and Anthropology and International Affairs. In addition, Lanman was the major donor supporting the university's Tercentennial celebration in 2001. In 1974, he made a gift of John Trumbull's painting \\"Lady of the Lake, from Scott's The Lady of the Lake\\" c. 1811, to the Yale University Art Gallery. Lanman was awarded the Yale Medal in 1996. Colonel Lanman died on March 26, 2001, the 300th anniversary year of the founding of Yale. He was survived by his sister, Harriet Lanman Fulton, and his friend, Isabel Pollen. Colonel Lanman was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Of interest, Lanman's childhood home at West Fifth and Roxbury Road in Columbus, Ohio was just around the corner from that of his friend, Prescott Sheldon Bush, who also attended Yale as did his son U.

In February 2009, Hartwick inducted Lawrence into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame. Five months later, he became a Football League player, when he joined Wycombe Wanderers, for ¬£20,000. He made 21 appearances for Wycombe before moving on to Fulham, for an undisclosed fee. He spent 20 months at the west-London side, making over 60 appearances, before going back to Wycombe, on a free transfer, following Fulham's failure to gain promotion to Division One. He had a more successful spell at The Chairboys this time, before going to Millwall in March 2000, for ¬£200,000. At Millwall, he began a new role, as a right-back, and starred, only missing one game and being voted the fans' \\"Player of The Year\\", as Millwall were promoted to Division One as champions in 2000‚Äì01 season. He started the 2001‚Äì02 season well, but sustained concussion, the results of which kept him out of the side for some time. On his return, he found his best form to date for the club, as they reached the Division One play-offs. At the start of the 2003‚Äì04 campaign, Lawrence fell out with Lions boss Mark McGhee, and looked to be on his way out The New Den. However, McGhee was replaced by Dennis Wise, and Lawrence got his place back. It was then that he switched to central defence, playing alongside Darren Ward, and the duo stood out, with the Lions reaching the 2004 FA Cup Final, for which Lawrence was captain, and thus qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Boss Wise left the club at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season, and defensive partner Ward left for Crystal Palace, and Lawrence found himself playing in a number of positions, under a variety of different managers, during the disastrous 2005‚Äì06 campaign, as the Lions were relegated back to League One. Nigel Spackman was appointed manager at the New Den, but Lawrence did not play competitively under him, as he moved to rivals Crystal Palace, to rekindle his partnership with Darren Ward. After an average first season, Lawrence began to excel under the leadership of Neil Warnock at Selhurst Park. He scored his first goal for Palace against Sheffield Wednesday on 22 March 2008. His contract at Selhurst Park expired at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, and in August 2010 he joined Gillingham of League Two on a one-year deal, and made his debut for them in goalless draw away to Hereford United on 14 August. In July 2012 he joined non-League side Whitehawk. ==Life outside football== In preparation for the 2007‚Äì08 season, Lawrence wrote a weekly \\"pre-season diary\\" for The London Paper. This appeared every Monday for five weeks, a popular piece which led to him being given a regular column in the matchday programme over the season. He was signed up to write a weekly column for The Mirror. Lawrence joined the Sporting Kansas City broadcast team as a color commentator ahead of the 2017 Major League Soccer season. ==References *Matt Lawrence player profile at cpfc.co.uk * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Sportspeople from Northampton Category:Association football defenders Category:Hartwick Hawks men's soccer players Category:Grays Athletic F.C. players Category:Wycombe Wanderers F.C. players Category:Fulham F.C. players Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Whitehawk F.C. players Category:Burgess Hill Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players ","title":"Matt Lawrence (footballer)"},{"id":"6227166","text":"The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is a group of 96 cities around the world that represents one twelfth of the world's population and one quarter of the global economy.

Working across multiple sectors and initiative areas, C40 convenes networksC40 Networks of cities providing a suite of services in support of their efforts, including: direct technical assistance; facilitation of peer-to-peer exchange; and research, knowledge management & communications. C40 is also positioning cities as a leading force for climate action around the world, defining and amplifying their call to national governments for greater support and autonomy in creating a sustainable future. C40's work is made possible by three strategic funders: Bloomberg Philanthropies, Children's Investment Fund Foundation and Realdania. ==History== C40 started in October 2005 when London Mayor Ken Livingstone convened representatives from 18 megacities to forge an agreement on cooperatively reducing climate pollution and created the 'C20'.History of the C40, http://c40.org/history, accessed 2015-08-24. In 2006, Mayor Livingstone and the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI)‚Äîled by the efforts of former U.S. President Bill Clinton‚Äîcombined to strengthen both organizations, bringing the number of cities in the network to 40 and helping to deliver projects and project management for participating cities to further enhance emissions reductions efforts. Serving as C40's first chair, Livingstone established the C40 Secretariat in London, set up the C40 Steering Committee, and initiated the use of C40 workshops to exchange best practices amongst participating cities. In 2008, former Mayor of Toronto David Miller took over as C40 chair. Highlights of his tenure included the Copenhagen Climate Summit for Mayors and the C40 Cities Mayors Summit in Seoul, both in 2009, as well as the launch of practical action initiatives for cities, such as the Climate Positive Development Program and the Carbon Finance Capacity Building program. Three-term Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg served as Chair from 2010 to 2013. During his three-year tenure, Mayor Bloomberg demonstrated unwavering commitment to building a professional organization and establishing measurable and uniform benchmarks for success, as well as expanding knowledge-sharing between cities and partner organizations with similar priorities. Key milestones during his chairmanship include the full integration of the CCI Cities Program into the C40, and the C40 Mayors Summits in Sao Paulo and Johannesburg. Under Mayor Bloomberg's leadership, C40 grew to include 63 cities. In December 2013 former Mayor of Rio de Janeiro Eduardo Paes became Chair of C40. During his tenure Mayor Paes oversaw the addition of more than 20 new member cities (particularly those in the Global South) several groundbreaking research reports, successful international events, and thriving global partnerships, all of which are helping cities make real contributions to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks. He also helped launch the Compact of Mayors (now the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy), put in place the C40 Cities Finance Facility, and oversaw the opening of a permanent C40 office in Rio de Janeiro, at the Museum of Tomorrow.

Bloomberg during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In August 2016, Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo became C40's first chairwoman after being voted in unanimously by the Steering Committee.Mayor Hidalgo elected as C40 Chair Mayor Hidalgo has announced an ambitious agenda for the organization, including plans to focus on securing green financing, supporting compliance with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, encouraging inclusive and sustainable growth in cities, and recognizing the leadership of women in tackling climate change. In December 2016, C40 held its sixth biennial Mayors Summit in Mexico City.sixth biennial Mayors Summit in Mexico City The global Summit, hosted by Mayor of Mexico City Miguel √Ångel Mancera, was attended by 1,400 people, including representatives from more than 90 cities. ==C40 cities== C40 has 96 participating member cities across seven geographic regions. * Africa: ** ‚Äì Addis Ababa ** ‚Äì Accra ** ‚Äì Nairobi ** ‚Äì Lagos ** ‚Äì Dakar ** ‚Äì Freetown ** ‚Äì Cape Town ** ‚Äì Durban ** ‚Äì Johannesburg ** ‚Äì Tshwane ** ‚Äì Dar es Salaam * East Asia: ** ‚Äì Beijing ** ‚Äì Chengdu ** ‚Äì Dalian ** ‚Äì Guangzhou ** ‚Äì Nanjing ** ‚Äì Shanghai ** ‚Äì Shenzhen ** ‚Äì Wuhan ** ‚Äì Hong Kong ** ‚Äì Tokyo ** ‚Äì Yokohama ** ‚Äì Seoul * West Asia: ** ‚Äì Istanbul * Europe: ** ‚Äì Copenhagen ** ‚Äì Paris ** ‚Äì Berlin ** ‚Äì Heidelberg ** ‚Äì Athens ** ‚Äì Milan ** ‚Äì Rome ** ‚Äì Venice ** ‚Äì Amsterdam ** ‚Äì Rotterdam ** ‚Äì Oslo ** ‚Äì Warsaw ** ‚Äì Moscow ** ‚Äì Barcelona ** ‚Äì Madrid ** ‚Äì Stockholm ** ‚Äì Basel ** ‚Äì London * South America: ** ‚Äì Buenos Aires ** ‚Äì Curitiba ** ‚Äì Rio de Janeiro ** ‚Äì S√£o Paulo ** ‚Äì Salvador ** ‚Äì Santiago ** ‚Äì Bogot√° ** ‚Äì Medell√≠n ** ‚Äì Quito ** ‚Äì Lima ** ‚Äì Caracas * North America: ** ‚Äì Montreal ** ‚Äì Toronto ** ‚Äì Vancouver ** ‚Äì Mexico City ** ‚Äì Austin ** ‚Äì Boston ** ‚Äì Chicago ** ‚Äì Houston ** ‚Äì Los Angeles ** ‚Äì New Orleans ** ‚Äì New York City ** ‚Äì Philadelphia ** ‚Äì Portland ** ‚Äì San Francisco ** ‚Äì Seattle ** ‚Äì Washington, DC * South and West Asia: ** ‚Äì Dhaka ** ‚Äì Bengaluru ** ‚Äì Chennai ** ‚Äì Jaipur ** ‚Äì Kolkata ** ‚Äì Mumbai ** ‚Äì New Delhi ** ‚Äì Tel Aviv ** ‚Äì Amman ** ‚Äì Karachi ** ‚Äì Dubai * Southeast Asia & Oceania: ** ‚Äì Melbourne ** ‚Äì Sydney ** ‚Äì Jakarta ** ‚Äì Kuala Lumpur ** ‚Äì Auckland ** ‚Äì Quezon City ** ‚Äì Singapore ** ‚Äì Bangkok ** ‚Äì Hanoi ** ‚Äì Ho Chi Minh City ==Membership== While C40 originally targeted megacities for their greater capacity to address climate change, C40 now offers three types of membership categories to reflect the diversity of cities taking action to address climate change. The categories consider such characteristics as population size, economic output, environmental leadership, and the length of a city's membership. 1\\\\. Megacities ::* Population: City population of 3 million or more, and/or metropolitan area population of 10 million or more, either currently or projected for 2025. OR ::* GDP: One of the top 25 global cities, ranked by current GDP output, at purchasing-power parity (PPP), either currently or projected for 2025. 2\\\\. Innovator Cities ::* Cities that do not qualify as Megacities but have shown clear leadership in environmental and climate change work. ::* An Innovator City must be internationally recognized for barrier- breaking climate work, a leader in the field of environmental sustainability, and a regionally recognized ‚Äúanchor city‚Äù for the relevant metropolitan area. 3\\\\. Observer Cities ::* A short-term category for new cities applying to join the C40 for the first time; all cities applying for Megacity or Innovator membership will initially be admitted as Observers until they meet C40‚Äôs year- one participation requirements, for up to one year. ::* A longer-term category for cities that meet Megacity or Innovator City guidelines and participation requirements, but for local regulatory or procedural reasons, are unable to approve participation as a Megacity or Innovator City expeditiously. ==C40 global initiatives== C40 networks help cities replicate, improve and accelerate climate action. These city-only working groups provide for honest knowledge exchange, enabling cities to tap into the global expertise of their peers as well as connect with technical partners. Through networks, cities find opportunities to undertake joint projects in areas of mutual interest and benefit. C40 networks also amplify individual city solutions by providing a global platform for showcasing city successes. Networks are designed to be dynamic and nimble, responding to the changing needs and priorities of participating cities. C40 has established a data-driven approach to identify and launch networks, ensuring that resources are strategically deployed by mapping city priorities to focus areas with the greatest potential GHG and climate risk impact.C40 Networks, http://www.c40.org/networks, accessed 2016-01-06 ==C40 research== The C40 Research, Measurement and Planning team leverages their unprecedented database of city actions, extensive network of partnerships, and unique organizational insight to demonstrate the power of cities to address climate change.

On 16 January 2009, Huysegems signed a contract at K.R.C. Genk lasting until 30 June 2013. In September 2010, he went out on loan until the end of the season to the Dutch Eredivisie club Roda JC, but his deal was terminated on 22 March 2011. Before the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season of the Belgian Pro League, he was deemed surplus to requirements at Genk and his contract was terminated by mutual consent. Some weeks later, he signed an achievement based one-year contract with Lierse on 3 September 2011. As the contract between Genk and Huysegems had not been terminated before 30 June 2011, the Royal Belgian Football Association ruled that he was not allowed to play for his new team before 2012, causing him to be sidelined for almost 5 months, earning only a basic wage without bonuses. On 14 September 2012 he was signed by Wellington Phoenix of New Zealand playing in the A-League. Huysegems scored on his Wellington Phoenix debut on 6 October 2012 in a 2‚Äì0 home win over Sydney FC in the opening game of the season. He increased his tally to three goals after four games ‚Äì scoring away to Adelaide United and at home against the Brisbane Roar. Huysegems lost his form somewhat during the middle of the season, but rediscovered it later on. He broke his goal scoring drought on 17 March 2013, the second-to-last game of the season, with a header that saw the Phoenix beat Perth Glory 2‚Äì1. Huysegems scored his fifth goal for the Phoenix in his last match of the season vs. Melbourne Victory from a well-controlled chested volley. In the 2013‚Äì14 A-League season, Huysegems finished the season with 10 goals in 26 games for the Phoenix, including a double in a match-winning performance away to Western Sydney Wanderers. He finished the season tied with Alessandro Del Piero of Sydney FC on the goal scoring table, 6 goals behind golden boot winner Adam Taggart of the Newcastle Jets. Huysegems was released by the Wellington Phoenix on 13 April 2014 after the club would not offer a two-year deal to Huysegems, stating they would only offer him a one-year deal, which both parties couldn't agree to, so Huysegems and the Phoenix both parted ways. In November 2014, Huysegems signed with Belgian Second Division club Dessel. ==International== Huysegems has represented the Belgium national football team 16 times. ==Honours== Genk *Belgian Cup: 2008‚Äì09 ==References * *Stein Huysegems returns to Lierse *Belgium stats at Belgian FA Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Belgian footballers Category:People from Herselt Category:Flemish sportspeople Category:Belgium youth international footballers Category:Belgium under-21 international footballers Category:Belgium international footballers Category:Eredivisie players Category:Belgian First Division A players Category:Belgian Second Division/Belgian First Division B players Category:A-League players Category:Lierse S.K. players Category:AZ Alkmaar players Category:Feyenoord players Category:FC Twente players Category:K.R.C.

While living in Europe he first encountered the music of Varese, Stockhausen, and Pierre Henry, as well as music of India, Africa, and Japan. After studying electrical engineering at MIT, he continued studies in music at the Boston School of Electronic Music, later as a teacher and designer of synthesis systems. He graduated with a degree in music from Hampshire College, and shortly thereafter became the technical director of electronic music studios at Amherst College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He has since taught electronic music at Hampshire College, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Holyoke Community College. MW Gilbert has been composing and recording actively from the 1970's through the present. In 1978 he released his first LP, ‚ÄúMoving Pictures‚Äù, with the goal of humanizing electronic music, using wooden flutes, percussion, and voice to complement synthesized sounds and textures. ‚ÄúThe Call‚Äù (1980), his second LP, grew out of a desire to set jazz-influenced solo lines against a backing of drone, percussion, and soundscapes, also evoking aspects of Eastern music. ‚ÄúThe Call‚Äù marks MW Gilbert's first work with multi-wind and reed player Tim Moran, experimental percussionist/vocalist David Moss, and acoustic bassist Salvatore Macchia. The LP ‚ÄúIn the Dreamtime‚Äù (1982) followed and is a refinement of ideas germinated on the first two records. It uses a theme of dream imagery, exploring and merging distinctions between electronics, new jazz, and world music, and features work with Moran, Moss, and Macchia, as well as master drummer Royal Hartigan. Moving to compact disc as one of the first indies to do so, MW Gilbert released ‚ÄúThe Light in the Clouds‚Äù (1987), and ‚ÄúPoint of Views‚Äù (1988). A collaboration with master percussionist Tony Vacca, bassist Salvatore Macchia, and synthesist Roy Finch, ‚ÄúThe Light in the Clouds‚Äù brings together African, Jewish, Christian, and Shinto music traditions and melds them with crystal clear sounds and rhythms. ‚ÄúPoint of Views‚Äù is a solo recording realized entirely in his (then new) MIDI/computer- based studio, weaving elements of jazz, world, and electronic into ‚Äúan ethereal and beautiful blend!‚Äù ‚ÄúPoint of Views‚Äù received 4 stars in Downbeat Magazine. It successfully creates the sound of an ensemble yet is a purely solo work, with only percussion by Tony Vacca on one track. MW Gilbert signed a recording contract with Penta Disc Recordings (WEA) for releases in Canada of music from this repertoire. After a few long breaks from recording, two new CD projects were released. ‚ÄúOther Voices‚Äù (2000), with more collaboration with Tony Vacca and Roy Finch. This was followed by ‚ÄúI Can See from Here‚Äù (2010), a complex weave of jazz, folk, electronic soundscape, world music, and electroacoustic ambience. It features a track with guitarist and friend Peter Kaukonen (Black Kangaroo, Jefferson Airplane, Jefferson Starship, Johnny Winter). MW Gilbert's first three LP recordings, ‚ÄúMoving Pictures‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Call‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIn the Dreamtime‚Äù were remastered and rereleased on CD, making the complete catalog to date available again, on both disc and digital distribution channels. Composed with the aim of creating music for potential live performance, ‚ÄúSecret Stories‚Äù (2015) is a complex work encompassing many faces of electronic music old and new, jazz, contemporary classical, and influences from multicultural folk music. He released ‚ÄúRadio Omnibus‚Äù (2018), with cutting edge electronic music, two acoustic chamber pieces, and features collaborations with Adam Holzman (Miles Davis, Steven Wilson) and Mark Walker (Oregon, Lyle Mays). His latest album is ‚ÄúVoice Ping Strum‚Äù, a vinyl only release. It has two extended suites, one on each side. It was realized in the studio using Eurorack modular, voice, and piano. It comes on the 40th anniversary of the release of his first album, ‚ÄúMoving Pictures‚Äù. MW Gilbert's music has been played in concerts and festivals in North America and Europe and has been used by choreographers in conjunction with modern dance works, including Susan Waltner, Valerie Feit, Jan Wodynski, and Paula Josa-Jones. MW Gilbert retired from an almost 30-year career as Adviser for Technology Initiatives and Services for the University of Massachusetts Amherst, having engaged in research on internet media technologies, mobile devices, virtual teaching, strategic planning, and developing/supporting internet and technology cloud services to the campus and community. He is now able to work full time on music and is a co-principal with his son Daniel of Tall Dog Electronics, which has a growing line of Eurorack modules, all used on ‚ÄúVoice Ping Strum‚Äù! ==Discography== * Moving Pictures (Gibex 001), 1978 * The Call (Gibex 002), 1980 * In The Dreamtime (Palace of Lights 02/2000), 1982 * The Light in the Clouds (Gibex 003), 1986 * Point of Views (Gibex 004), 1988 * Other Voices (Gibex 005), 2000 * I Can See from Here (Gibex 006), 2010 * Secret Stories (Gibex 007), 2015 ==References== Category:American male composers Category:21st-century American composers Category:Living people Category:University of Massachusetts Amherst faculty Category:1954 births Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Michael William Gilbert"},{"id":"6227212","text":"is operated by JR West in Yamaguchi City, and is served by the Yamaguchi Line, which connects the station to Shin-Yamaguchi Station, a stop of the Sany≈ç Shinkansen.

During his career he trained 5,333 winners including 524 individual Group or Listed winners. He won 28 Adelaide and 13 Melbourne Trainers' Premierships. The C S Hayes Stakes is named in his honour and run annually at Flemington Racecourse. Hayes was elevated to Legend status in the Australian Racing Hall of Fame in 2018, a feat only achieved by two other horse trainers, TJ Smith and Bart Cummings. ==Early days== Hayes was born in Semaphore, South Australia on 16 February 1924. His father died when he was 10 years old. On leaving school he gained employment with the South Australian Electricity Trust as a boilermaker, but his love of horses soon led him to purchase a steeplechaser named Surefoot for ¬£9. As an amateur rider, Hayes rode Surefoot himself with his best result being a third in the 1948 Great Eastern Steeplechase run at Oakbank. Popular legend has it that Hayes bet his honeymoon money on Surefoot, which ran third at odds of 60/1, enabling him to recoup the money and a little profit. His wife Betty was apparently very angry about the incident at the time. His son David followed in his footsteps and is a horse trainer. His other son was also a trainer, but Peter Hayes, who at the time was training Fields Of Omagh, died in an airplane crash in 2001. ==Initial success== Hayes's initial moderate success with Surefoot drove him to expand his operations and he set up stables called 'Surefoot Lodge' at Semaphore. He won his first Adelaide trainers' premiership in 1956 but decided he wanted to expand his operations into breeding winners as well. Hayes chose a place in the Barossa Valley approximately 80 kilometres north-east of Adelaide, with many people saying it was too far out of the metropolitan area to succeed. A syndicate of people was formed to purchase the property known as Lindsay Park, an 800-hectare property of very rich pasture land and superb paddocks. The centrepiece of the property is a magnificent 38-room mansion built in 1840 by George Fife Angas from sandstone and marble quarried on the property. In making the move Hayes lost several owners and promising horses, reducing his stable from 40 to 16 horses. He officially began training there on 1 August 1970 and over the next 29 years created one of the most successful breeding and training establishments in the world. A sign of his success is the world record 10 individual winners in a day, a feat he achieved on 23 January 1982. ==Major wins== Amongst the many thousands of races won by Hayes and his horses were the following major race wins: VRC Melbourne Cup * 1980 Beldale Ball * 1986 At Talaq VATC Caulfield Cup * 1976 How Now MVRC W.S.Cox Plate * 1978 So Called * 1979 Dulcify * 1989 Almaarad STC Golden Slipper Stakes * 1985 Rory's Jester VRC Newmarket Handicap * 1977 Desirable * 1985 Red Tempo * 1988 Special * 1989 Grandiose VRC Australian Cup * 1974 Bush Win * 1979 Dulcify VRC Derby * 1974 Haymaker * 1976 Unaware * 1978 Dulcify * 1988 King's High AJC Derby * 1979 Dulcify * 1981 Our Paddy Boy SAJC Adelaide Cup * 1962 Cheong Sam * 1972 Wine Taster * 1980 Yashmak * 1990 Water Boatman ==Breeding== Hayes also played a major role in the Australian breeding industry by standing quality stallions such as Romantic, Without Fear and Godswalk.

Its primary advantage was that it could be machine- assembled, which potentially led to lower prices than the hand-assembled core. Instead of threading individual ferrite cores on wires, plated wire memory used a grid of wires coated with a thin layer of iron-nickel alloy (called permalloy). The magnetic field normally stored in the ferrite core was instead stored on the wire itself. Operation was generally similar to core memory, with the wire itself acting as the data line and the magnetic domains providing the individual bit locations defined by address (word) lines running on either side of (and perpendicular to) the data wire. Early versions operated in a destructive read mode requiring a write after read to restore data. Non-destructive read mode was possible but this required much greater uniformity of the magnetic coating. Increasingly high density semiconductor memories such as the 1K Dynamic RAM provided the higher storage densities and higher speeds needed for large scale application such as mainframe computers. Plated wire memory has been used in a number of applications, typically in aerospace. It was used in the UNIVAC 1110 and UNIVAC 9000 series computers, the Viking program that sent landers to Mars, the Voyager space probes, a prototype guidance computer for the Minuteman-III, the Space Shuttle Main Engine Controllers, KH-9 Hexagon reconnaissance satellite and in the Hubble Space Telescope. ==References * technikum29.de - Description of Plated wire memory Category:Computer memory Category:Non- volatile memory ","title":"Plated wire memory"},{"id":"6227254","text":"Hokusai is a city located in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 23,158 in 9987 households,Uenohara City official statistics and a population density of 140 persons per km¬≤.

The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.5 ¬∞C, and lowest in January, at around 2.2 ¬∞C.Uenohara climate data ==History== The area around present day Uenohara was heavily settled in the J≈çmon period, and numerous J≈çmon sites have been found within city limits. However, there are fewer Yayoi period sites. During the Nara period ritsuryo organization of Kai Province, the area came under Tsuru County. From the middle of the Kamakura period, much of the province came under the control of the Takeda clan, although as a border area adjacent to the holdings of the Uesugi clan and the Odawara H≈çj≈ç clan, it was the location of many skirmishes and battles. During the Edo period, all of Kai Province was tenry≈ç territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate. During this period, the K≈çsh≈´ Kaid≈ç, one of the Edo Five Routes, passed through Uenohara, which had four of the 45 post stations on that route. The area was also a noted center for sericulture. After the Meiji restoration, the village of Uenohara was established on December 27, 1897 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Uenohara became a town on April 1, 1955 ny annexing seven neighboring villages. The modern city of Uenohara was established on February 13, 2005 by the mergers of the former town of Uenohara (from Kitatsuru District), absorbing the village of Akiyama (from Minamitsuru District). ==Government== Uenohara has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 16 members. ==Economy== The economy of Uenohara is dominated by agriculture, sericulture and textile manufacturing. ==Education== Uenohara has five public elementary schools and three public junior high schools operated by the city government and one public high school operated by the Yamanashi Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school. The city also hosts the private Teikyo University of Science. * Universities ** Teikyo University of Science * High Schools ** Uenohara High School ** Japan University Meisei High School * Middle schools ** Uenohara Middle School ** Akiyama Middle School ** Nishi Middle School * Primary Schools ** Nishi Elementary School ** Shimada Elementary School ** Uenohara Elementary School ** Saihara Elementary School ** Akiyama Elementary School ==TransportationRailway=== *20px Central Japan Railway Company - Ch≈´≈ç Main Line ** ‚Äì ===Highway=== *alt=E19 Ch≈´≈ç Expressway * * K≈çsh≈´ Kaid≈ç ==Local attractions== *Mushono-Dainembutsu dance (National Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property) ==Notable people== *Ken Mizorogi, actor ==References *Official Website Category:Cities in Yamanashi Prefecture ","title":"Uenohara, Yamanashi"},{"id":"6227261","text":"Bart, around 1930 Hugo Hirst, 1st Baron Hirst (26 November 1863 ‚Äì 22 January 1943), known as Sir Hugo Hirst, Bt, between 1925 and 1934, was a German-born British industrialist.

It is named after its white (leuco-), unmarked belly (gaster). No subspecies are currently recognized. ==Description== Echis Leucogaster It grows to an average total length (body + tail) of , with a maximum total length of . The scalation of the head is similar to E. carinatus. The body is rather stout, the cross-section of which is circular or subtriangular. The dorsal scales are rough and heavily keeled. At midbody, there are 27-33 rows of dorsal scales. The ventral scales number 165-180. Coloration and pattern are both variable. Color ranges from brown to gray to reddish and everything in between. Pattern generally consists of a series of light, oblique, dorsal crossbars or saddles set against a darker ground color. The flanks are lighter in color, normally with a series of triangular, subtriangular, or circular, dark markings with light or white edges. The belly is an unbroken pale cream, white, or ivory. ==Geographic range== In West Africa it is found in northern Nigeria, western Niger, Burkina Faso, central Mali, northern Guinea, and Senegal. In Northwest Africa it is found in southern Mauritania, Algeria (Ahaggar), Western Sahara, and the extreme south of Morocco. Roman (1975) described the type locality as \\"Boubon, √† 20 km au Nord de Niamey, Niger\\". According to Golay et al. (1993), the range includes Nigeria, Niger, Upper Volta, southern Algeria and Mauritania. Spawls and Branch (1995) describe the range as extending from the southern half of Mauritania, Senegal and northern Guinea, through central Mali to northern Burkina Faso and western Niger. However, they are not sure whether or not the specimens from southern Morocco and the Ahaggar are connected to the main population. They also regard some of the specimens from Senegal and northern Mali as problematic. ==Habitat== Not a true desert animal, it is found along edges of deserts. It is associated with arid savannah, semi-desert, Sahel, and well-vegetated dry river beds (wadis) and oases. ==Diet== It eats a wide variety of prey, including invertebrates (especially scorpions and centipedes), small mammals and reptiles. ==Reproduction== It is known to lay eggs. Hatchlings are in total length. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Cherlin VA. 1990. [A taxonomic revision of the snake genus Echis (Viperidae). II.

His usual position is on the wing. Saubade was originally playing with Biarritz Olympique, where he had been developed, though he moved to US Dax, playing in the Pro D2, initially for the 2003 season, but he ended up staying there until July 2005, since he could not get the opportunity to play in Biarritz's first team. He was the second division's top scorer with 12 tries. The club did not seem to be ready to trust him despite his selections in the French U-19 and then U-21 teams (alongside Julien Arias and Arnaud Marchois whom he was to join in Paris). Therefore, he moved to Paris to play for Stade Fran√ßais, among the √©lite of French rugby. At the start, the transition from the Pro D2 to the Top 14 was quite hard for him, and Saubade made several unusual mistakes for such a promising player like him, notably one which made Paris' coach, Fabien Galthi√©, furious and which cost his team to lose a match in Montpellier. As a consequence, Saubade was advised to readapt through the Stade Fran√ßais' Espoirs (Juniors) team for a time, to gain experience from training with many of his new international teammates, to work physically, and then, thanks to some injuries among the starters he was given another chance to show his talent again and he seized it well. During the Six Nations Championship and after, he played all the matches, and scored 6 tries. Saubade also played in his club's semi-final of the 2005-06 Top 14, which they eventually lost to Toulouse, 12 to 9 and in Heineken Cup matches.

It commonly contains a few percent chromium-rich spinel as an accessory mineral. Garnet-bearing harzburgite is much less common, found most commonly as xenoliths in kimberlite. Harzburgite typically forms by the extraction of partial melts from the more pyroxene-rich peridotite called lherzolite. The molten magma extracted from harzburgite may then erupt on the surface as basalt. If partial melting of the harzburgite continues, all of the pyroxene may be extracted from it to form magma, leaving behind the pyroxene-poor peridotite called dunite. Harzburgite may also form by the accumulation of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene in large magma chambers of basalt deep in continental crust (layered intrusions). ==Occurrence== Harzburgite is the most commonly found variety of peridotite in ophiolites, which are fragments of oceanic crust and the underlying oceanic mantle obducted and exposed during collision with continental crust. Examples of ophiolites with extensive harzburgite include the Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus, the Semail Ophiolite in Oman, the Coast Range ophiolites of California, and the Bay of Islands Ophiolite in Newfoundland. Harzburgite may also be found in some Alpine peridotite massifs that consist mostly of lherzolite. Alpine or orogenic lherzolites represent subcontinental mantle lithosphere (the upper mantle below continental crust) exposed during the plate tectonic collision of continental plates. Examples of orogenic lherzolite massifs with harzburgite include the Lherz Massif in France (Pyrenees Mountains), the Lanzo Massif in northern Italy, and the Horoman Massif in Japan. Garnet-bearing harzburgite is found as xenoliths in some kimberlite pipes, which are found almost exclusively in ancient continental cratons of Archean or Paleoproterozoic age. The mantle lithosphere under these cratons is particularly thick (up to 200 km or more) and cool. Garnet harzburgites are less depleted in the basalt component than most ophiolite harzburgites. Garnet harzburgite xenoliths from kimberlites in South Africa have been particularly well-characterized. Cumulate harzburgite is found in some large layered igneous intrusions. At the Earth's surface, basaltic magmas typically crystallize the minerals: olivine, plagioclase, and augite (a high-Ca pyroxene); low-Ca pyroxenes can only co- exist with olivine at low pressure in magma that is high in both MgO and SiO2 (boninites). At pressures greater than 5 kilobars (0.5 GPa, or 5000x atmospheric pressure), olivine and low-Ca pyroxene (enstatite or bronzite) may crystallize together from normal basalt magmas to form harzburgite. These conditions were common in some layered mafic intrusions, most of which are Proterozoic in age, which formed from enormous sill-like intrusions of basalt into lower continental crust. The classic example of a Proterozoic layered intrusion with cumulate harzburgite is the Stillwater igneous complex of Montana, U.S.A. It is also found in the Bushveld Igneous Complex, a large layered intrusion in South Africa. ==References== * Blatt, Harvey and Robert J.

Plotin. 7 Originally a student of the works of Numenius of Apamea, he began attending the lectures of Plotinus in the third year after Plotinus came to Rome,Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 3 and stayed with him for more than twenty years, until 269, when he retired to Apamea in Syria, the native place of Numenius.Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 2. He is erroneously called Apameos by the Suda. Amelius was not his original name; he seems to have chosen it to express his contempt for worldly things, as the word (ameleia) means negligence in Greek. Porphyry stated of Amelius in the Life of Plotinus, \\"Amelius preferred to call himself Amerius, changing L for R, because, as he explained, it suited him better to be named from Amereia, Unification, than from Ameleia, Indifference.\\" Amelius read and wrote voraciously, memorized practically all the teachings of Numenius, and, according to Porphyry, wrote over 100 volumes of sayings and commentaries. Plotinus considered Amelius one of his sharpest disciples. It was Amelius who convinced Porphyry of the truth of the doctrines of Plotinus,Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 18 and joined with him in the successful effort to induce Plotinus to commit his doctrines to writings.Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 5 His principal work was a treatise in forty books arguing against the claim that Numenius should be considered the original author of the doctrines of Plotinus.Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 16-18 Amelius is also cited by Eusebius and others as having quoted with approval the definition of the Logos in the Gospel of John.Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica xi. 19Theod.

Ruins of its temples and theatres and other public buildings are at Henchir-Zenfour. == Bishopric == At an early stage Assuras became the centre of a Christian diocese. Records are extant of the names of seven of its bishops. The first of these is Fortunatianus. He was deposed because of defecting from the Catholic faith in the Decian persecution. Saint Cyprian of Carthage speaks of him in a letter that he wrote to the Christians of Assuras in about 252,Cyprian, Epistola LXXIV. which shows that he tried to recover the see from which he had been driven. He was replaced by Epictetus, who died before 256, the year in which his successor Victor took part in a council at Carthage convoked by Cyprian to deal with the problem of the lapsi.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 464Stefano Antonio Morcelli, Africa christiana, Volume I, Brescia 1816, pp. 85‚Äì87Joseph Mesnage, L'Afrique chr√©tienne, Paris 1912, pp. 168‚Äì169Anatole Toulotte, G√©ographie de l'Afrique chr√©tienne, vol.

The participants were condemned in the following year by a council that the main Donatist body, which recognized Primianus as Bishop of Carthage, held at Bagai. Saint Augustine says Praetextatus was one of the twelve bishops who consecrated Maximianus as Bishop of Carthage.Augustine, The Letters of Petilian, the Donatist, book 1, chapter 10 The successor of Praetextatus, Rogatus, was converted to the Catholic faith some time after 397. The Catholic Bishop of Assuras Evangelus took part in councils held at Carthage in 397, 401, and 411. The last of these was a meeting of Catholic and Donatist bishops, but Assuras was represented only by Evangelus, since the Donatist bishop of the town had died shortly before. The last Bishop of Assuras known by name was Peregrinus, who was one of the Catholic bishops summoned to a meeting in Carthage in 484 by the Vandal King Huneric and then exiled to Sardinia. Assuras is still mentioned as a bishopric in an early 8th- century Byzantine Notitiae Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Alexandria. No longer a residential diocese, Assuras is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 840 == References == Category:Catholic titular sees in Africa Category:Populated places in Africa ","title":"Assuras"},{"id":"6227521","text":"Manseng grapes in the Jurancon Juran√ßon is a wine region in South West France in the foothills of the Pyrenees, around the commune of Juran√ßon.

Though the first Bengali novel was Karuna O Phulmonir Bibaran (1852), the Bengali novel actually started its journey with Durgeshnandini written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in 1865. According to Ananda Sanker and Lila Ray, 'when the novel was introduced in Bengali in the middle of the 19th century, the form itself was new, the prose in which it was written was new, the secular tone was new in a country hitherto wholly dominated by religion, and the society in which and for which it was written was new' (p. 168). But some great novelists like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Rabindranath Tagore, Manik Bandopadhyay, Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay developed the newly introduced genre in such a way that 'new' changed into 'matured' through their works. Almost all these literary activities went on in full swing in Kolkata. Dhaka, on the other hand, could not participate in the early stage, but literature created by and of the people of Bangladesh area later on flourished with notable success. ==Bangladeshi novels== Novels of Bangladesh fall almost fifty years behind the Bengali novels. (First Bengali novel Alaler Ghore Dulal was published in 1858 and Anowara was published in 1914.) In its history of about one hundred years, novels of Bangladesh got a good number of novels where creative emancipation of the writers has been established. ===Themes of Bangladeshi novels=== In the early stage, glorification of the religious beliefs and lives was the theme of most of the novels. Later on, picturization of real Bengali life became a common topic. By the end of the fifties, the novelists gradually turned to human mind and its analysis. A great change of the theme came after 1971. Novels about the Liberation War of Bangladesh began to come forth. Even till now it has not ceased to be an interesting topic. The content and form of the novels saw various changes in the last fifty years. Starting from ordinary narration, now it has reached to magic realistic presentation through stream of consciousness, realism, surrealism etc. ===History of Bangladeshi novels=== To many, Anowara was the most significant one among the earlier novels written in Bangladesh. This novel was written by Mohammad Najibar Rahman in 1914. But the milestone in the modern novels of Bangladesh is Syed Waliullah's Lalsalu (published in 1948). The history of Bangladeshi novels can be categorized in 3 major parts. * Pre-partition (1947) era * East-Pakistan era * Bangladesh era Pre-Partition era Before 1947, events like Partition of Bengal in 1905, Foundation of Muslim League in 1906 and Unification of Bengali in 1911 inspired the Muslim community of Dhaka to establish a new identity in the horizon of literature. Mohammad Najibar Rahman, Kazi Imdadul Huq, Kazi Abdul Wadud, Sheikh Idrish Ali, Akbaruddin, Abul Fazal, Humayun Kabir, etc. were among the novelists who tried to enrich the novels of the then East Pakistan, present Bangladesh. Mohammad Najibar Rahman's Anowara was the first notable novel and it moved the whole Bengali Muslim community after publication. According to Rafiqullah Khan, 'The novel could not create any novelty from artistic point of view, but it carried great importance for its picturization of socio-economic and political culture and ideals of the uprising populace' (p. 25, Translation). The main themes of most of the novels in this era were Muslim society, beliefs, and orthodoxy. Examples of novels incorporating these themes are Najibar Rahman's Premer Somadhi (published in 1919) and Goriber Meye (1923), Sheikh Idris Ali's Premer Pothe (1926). In this time, for the first time the life of the Bengali farmers took an artistic delineation through Kazi Abdul Wadud's Nodibakshe (1919). Then Kazi Imdadul Huq sprinkled a new wave. His famous novel Abdullah was published in periodicals in 1920 and it came into book form in 1933. According to Biswajit Ghosh, this novel was a 'bourgeois and humanitarian revolt against devotion to Peers, religious dogmas, purdah-system and disparity between Ashraf and Atraf'.Biswajit Ghosh page 134, translation Later, 'Kazi Abdul Wadud and Humayun Kabir extended this attitude'.Syed Akram Hussain:page 97 Another novelist, Abul Fazal, exposed human psychological analyses in his novel Chouchir (1927). He afterwards continued with his own style and wrote Prodip O Patongo (1940) and Shahoshika (1946). It is well accepted that this type of psychological approach was a first attempt in novels of Bangladesh, though not for the first time in Bengali novels. A progressive novelist Humayun Kabir wrote an English novel, Rivers and Women, which was published in 1945. The Bengali form was published in 1952 by the name of Nodi O Nari. East Pakistan era The independence of India and Pakistan from British rule bore more importance for the people of then Bengal. Since then the Bengali speaking community were divided into two parts ‚Äì the East and the West Bengal. It turns into the smashing of the millennium-old culture and unity of Bengali nation. Moreover, the existence of language became a great question just after the creation of Pakistan. The West-Pakistan ruling government tried to impose Urdu as the principal language on the Bengali people. But the whole society reacted strongly. This leaves a permanent impression on Bengali literature. In this tumultuous era, Syed Waliullah's Lalsalu (Tree without roots) (1948) was published. It was the foremost successful novel, both from art and reality points of view. Later Syed Waliullah translated it in English by the name Tree Without Roots. Mahbub-ul Alam wrote Mofijon, also published in 1948. In the first years of the Pakistan regime the authors mostly took village life as their theme, but they gradually diversified their interests. Newly born urban society began to establish itself as worthy to be literary contents. Along with them political developments also took place in fiction. Among the first novelists of Pakistan period, Abul Fazal, Akbar Hossain, Shaukat Osman, Abu Rushd, Kazi Afsaruddin, Daulatunnessa Khatun, Syed Waliullah, Sarder Jayenuddin, Abu Ishaque, and Shamsuddin Abul Kalam were the most prominent ones. Then came a whole generation of extraordinary novelists. Chowdhury Shamsur Rahman, Satyen Sen, Abujafar Shamsuddin, Ahsan Habib, Nilima Ibrahim, Abdur Razzak, Khondkar Md. Eliash, Rashid Karim, Shahidulla Kaisar, Anwar Pasha, Abdar Rashid, Alauddin Al-Azad, Abdul Gaffar Choudhury, Zahir Raihan, Syed Shamsul Haq, Humayun Kadir, Shahid Akhand, Razia Khan, Shawkat Ali, Dilara Hashim, Indu Saha, and Ahmed Sofa were notable names. In this time, diversity of contents of the novel was noticeable. Village life was the core theme of a huge number of novels. Sometimes it centered the superstitious village mind or the oppression by the influential groups on the common people, some other times depressed womanhood took this place. Love between men and women in pastoral context were also a subject of many novels. Lalshalu by Syed Waliullah, Kashboner Konna by Shamsuddin Abul Kalam, Surjo Dighol Bari by Abu Ishaque, Meghabaran Kesh by Ishaq Chakhari, Adiganta by Sardar Jayenunddin, Mohuar Desh by Tasadduk Hossain, Janani by Shaukat Osman, Jhar by Syed Sahadat Hossain, Karnafully by Alauddin Al-Azad, Sareng Bou and Sangsaptak by Shahidulla Kaisar, Aranya Mithun by Badruddin Ahmad, Modhumoti by Rabeya Khatun, Hazar Bachhar Dhore by Zahir Raihan, Bobakahini by Jasimuddin, Pannamoti by Sardar Jayenuddin etc. incorporated these themes. Middle class society began to evolve in this time. Urban life, its problems and complexities, uprising middle-class people, their social context and love in their life started to be portrayed in a good number of novels. Jibon Pother Jatri by Abul Fazal, Pother Porosh (1957) by Daulatunnessa Khatun, Bhorer Bihongi (1958) by Satyen Sen, Surjer Niche (1958) by Atahar Ahmad, Pathasranta (1959) by Nilima Ibrahim, Shesh Bikeler Meye (1960) by Zahir Raihan, Kanyakumari (1960) by Abdur Razzak, Uttam Purush (1961) by Rashid Karim, Ek Path Dui Bank (1962) by Nilima Ibrahim, Akash Jodi Nil Hoi (1962) and Ihai To Prem (1963) by Syed Sahadat Hossain, Prasanno Pashan (1963) by Rashid Karim, Pingal Aakash (1963) by Shawkat Ali, Akasher Rong (1964) by Zobeda Khanam, Panna Holo Sobuz (1964) by Shahid Akhand, Nirjan Megh (1965) by Humayun Kadir, Ghar Mon Janala (1965) by Dilara Hashim, Aronyo Nilima (1965) by Ahsan Habib, Antahshila (1967) by Kazi Md. Idris, Digonter Swapno (1967) by Razia Majid, Mon Ek Shet Kopoti (1967), Shaheb Bazar (1967) and Ananto Aneysha (1967) by Rabeya Khatun, Bipani Mon (1968) by Mir Abul Hossain, Sourav (1968) by Anis Chowdhury, Anishchita Ragini (1969) by Abu Rushd, Borof Gola Nodi (1969) by Zahir Raihan, Rajabagh Shahimar Bagh (1969) by Rabeya Khatun etc. are significant novels of this stream. But the background of another major event was being prepared in this time. The country began to experience turmoil. The political situation of the country became more and more prominent in the novels also. In novels like Nongor by Abu Rushd and Mon Na Moti by Anis Siddique, Jibon Khuda by Abul Monsoor Ahmed exposed the context of Pakistan Movement. Communal picture out of this movement and the restoration of Hindu- Muslim harmony also became core content in a number of novels including Ranga Probhat by Abul Fazal, Khuda O Asha by Alauddin Al-Azad, Neer Sandhani and Nishuti Rater Gatha by Anwar Pasha etc. Then came the historic event of the Bengali Language Movement. The keen eyes of the novelists were nowhere but on this tremendous incident. Jahir Raihan's Aarek Falgoon was the most significant effort on language movement. Other political incidents like the class conflict, socialism, and movement in the cultivators was depicted in the novels like Dui Mohol (later on renamed as Alamnagorer Upokotha) by Shamsuddin Abul Kalam, Surjo Tumi Sathi by Ahmad Sofa etc. Shaukat Osman wrote wonderful symbolic political novels Kritodasher Hashi and Raja Upakhyan. Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury's Chandradwiper Upakhyan and Nam Na Jana Bhore portrayed the uprising farmer society and its conflicts. There were some historical novels also. Abujafar Shamsuddin's Bhaowal Gorer Upakhayan about the Faraizi Movement, Sardar Jayenuddin's Nil Rong Rokto about the Indigo revolt, Satyen Sen's Kumarajiva about the spread of Buddhism, and Oporajeyo about the Sepoy Revolt etc. are a few examples among them. Some novelists favoured psychological complexities. With his unique presentation and language of his own, Syed Waliullah wrote Chander Amabashya and Kando Nodi Kando keeping psychological analysis in the centre. Another trend of novels having emphasis on the sexual behaviours and deviations of the characters began to mark its own place during the sixties. Razia Khan's Bot-tolar Uponyas, and Anukolpo was among the first novels of this trend. Alauddin Al-Azad's Teish Nambor Toilochitro, Shiter Sheshrat Boshonter Prothomdin and Syed Shamsul Haq's Ek Mohilar Chhobi, Anupama Din, Simana Chhariye etc. are mentionables in this regard. Afterwards came the most memorable days of Bangali nation. After ten- month long war Bangalis became independent nation. After the massacre of three million people and huge violation and harassment of womenfolk and loss of property Bangladesh emerged as a secular and democratic nation on 16 December 1971, and Bangladeshi novel enters into a new era. Bangladesh era Most of the writers who were contributing in the pre-liberation period were also very creative in this period. Rashid Karim wrote novels based on middle-class society and their societal and psychological analysis. Alauddin Al-Azad, Shawkat Ali, Razia Khan and Dilara Hashim, Mahmudul Haque, Ahmad Sofa, Syed Shamsul Haq is among other notable names. Syed Shamsul Haq, commonly known as Syed Huq, wrote a good number of novels along with a huge number of books of other genres. He is always very experimental in both technique and form. Khelaram Khele Ja placed him in great controversy for his open delineation of human sexual behaviour. In his novels like Duratto, Mahashunye Poran Master, Ek Juboker Chhayapoth etc. Liberation war, its consequences, hopeless human existence and analysis of human mind and society take sharp pen-picture. Another powerful writer Shawkat Ali wrote Prodoshe Praakritojon, which is a real representation of the twelfth century Bengali during King Lakhkhan Sen. His trilogy Dakshinayaner Din, Kulaya Kalasrot and Purbaratri Purbadin deserve much compliment. Mahmudul Haque wrote Anur Pathshala before liberation war in 1967. He wrote Nirapod Tondra, Khelaghar (written 1978, published 1988), Kalo Borof (written in 1977, published in 1992), and Matir Jahaj (written in 1977, published in 1996). Ahmad Sofa, wrote novels with different tone. In Onkar (1975) he portrayed the suppressed Bangali mind of the pre-liberation period in a very artistic and symbolic way. In Gaavi Brityanto he presents the contemporary picture in a meticulous allegory. Ardhek Nari Ardhek Ishwari, a novel of romantic love, is widely considered as his masterpiece. His Pushpa Brikhkha Ebong Bihongo Puran is a narration of true human affinity to nature. After the liberation war, freedom fight became a unique subject. The first of this discipline is Anwar Pasha's Rifle Roti Awrat that he wrote during the war. Shaukat Osman's Jahannam Hoite Bidai, Nekre Aranyo, Dui Soinik, Rashid Haider's Khanchai, Andho Kothamala, Shawkat Ali's Jatraa, Selina Hossain's Hangor Nodi Granade, Mahmudul Huq's Jiban Aamar Bone, Syed Shamsul Haq's Nil Dangshon, Nishiddho Loban, Harun Habib's Priyo Joddha Priyotoma, Humayun Ahmed's Jochona O Jononir Golpo etc. are examples of novels which directly deal freedom fight as their subject. Besides this, novels like Amar Jato Glani by Rashid Karim, Ferari Surjo by Rabeya Khatun, Abelay Ashamoy by Amjad Hossain also portray the different facets of liberation war. Rashid Karim's Prem Ekti Lal Golap, Ekaler Rupkotha or Sadharon Loker Kahini are presentation of the hopeless picture of Bangladesh after the war. 'Critics say that though after the liberation huge number of novels was written about our war, none of them could depict the historic incident in necessary epic form'. New faces appeared in the literary world after the liberation. Among them, Selina Hossain, Humayun Ahmed, Hasnat Abdul Hye, Rizia Rahman, Jubaida Gulshan Ara Hena, and Bashir al-Helal were the most prominent. Selina Hossain started with Jalochchhwas and till now she has authored more than twenty-one novels. Her Hangor Nodi Granade is a success written on Bangladesh Liberation War. She has written novels like Taanaporen on coastal life and natural disaster. Gayatree Sondhya (3 volumes: published in, 1994, 1995, 1996), Kalketu O Fullora, Chandbene are some of her historical novels. Abdur Rouf Choudhury's novel Natun Diganta (three volumes: published in 1991, 1992, 1993 and complete collection in 2005 by Pathak Shamabesh) is a quality work of art by any standard and most successful writing on pre- Bangladesh Liberation War. Choudhury most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel Natun Diganta (New Horizon) (vols. 1-3). Reason and humanity ‚Äì these are its two eternal pillars. The essence of Choudhury's thought is a complete faith in the efficiency of these two immeasurable forces. Its most striking characteristic is its insistent association of work, precept and practice. It appeals not to controversial tests, not to any appearance of sweet reasonableness but to trials in the rough and tumble of life, and it will accept no other judgment. Natun Diganta gives warning against: 1) dogma, mysticism, ceremonial, hypnotism, the binding of the mind and will by oaths, and other inventions of external authority in religion and politics, 2) participation in violence, individual or social, and organisation's dependence on violence, 3) exploitation, luxury and material property, 4) self-degradation and 5) devotion to self-sacrifice. Humayun Ahmed, perhaps the most popular novelist in Bengali after Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, appeared with his novel Nondito Noroke and then Shonkhoneel Karagar. Later he gradually turned to less serious things. Almost all of his novels are best sellers. Some of his titles are 1971, Daruchinir Deep, Brihonnola, Joyjoyonti, Kobi etc. Humayun Ahmed's Tomader Jonno Valobasa is the first science fiction novel in Bangladesh. A serious poet, essayist and literary researcher Abdul Mannan Syed published his first novel Pariprekshter Dasdashi in 1974. Later on he wrote Kolkata, Poramatir Kaaj, O Te Ojogor, Hei Songsar Hei Lota, Khudha, Prem, Aagun, Shyamoli Tomar Mukh etc. Hasnat Abdul Hye, arrived with his Suprobhat Bhalobasa. By now he has written at least twenty novels. Along with his other novels he has introduced a different form of novels called biographical. Sultan, Ekjon Aaroj Ali and Novera are example of this form. All of these novels are based on the biographical sketches of giant Bangali characters. Rizia Rahman's Uttar Purush came in black and white in 1977. She wrote some fifteen novels in the eighties. Her voluminous Bongo Theke Bangla is an epic composition about the past culture and heritage of Bangali nation. Her other major novels are Rokter Okhkhor, Alikhito Upakhyan, Ekal Chirokal, Prem Aamar Prem, Ekti Phuler Jonyo, Harun Fereni etc. Bashir al-Helal's Kalo Elish was published in 1979. His other novels include Ghritokumari, Shesh Panpatro, Nurjahander Modhumas etc. In the eighties, Bangladeshi novel got some senior writers who wrote novels for the first time along with some promising young ones. Among the earlier writers Abubakar Siddique's Jalarakshas and Kharadaha appeared with much novelty. His important later novel is Ekatturer Hridoybhashma. Makbula Manjoor started in the late years of the sixties, but most of her novels came out in the eighties and nineties. Kaler Mondira is one of her most notable work. Rahat Khan wrote novels about middle class city people, their joys and sorrows, love and separation. His significant works include Omol Dhabol Chakri, Ek Priyodorshini, Chhayadampoti, Hai Shunyota, Sangharsho, Shahar, Hai Anonter Pakhi, Modhyomather Khelowar etc. Akhtaruzzaman Elias, one of the most artistic but least productive writers, wrote only two novels. He has started his journey with Chilekothar Sepai. His most prestigious work Khoabnama, which came out in 1996, is considered a milestone in the history of Bengali novels. Another senior novelist Abu Ishaque's second novel Padmar Palidwip was published in 1986, after thirty-one years of his debut novel Surjo Dighal Bari. Appearance and disappearance of Chars (strip of sandy land), their effect on nearby humanity etc. have taken a keen narration in Padmar Palidwip. Haripada Datta is also a worthy name. His two-volume novel Ojogor (Vol. I -1989, Vol. II-1991) chronicles the recent past history very remarkably. His previous novels are Eshane Ognidaho and Ondhokupe Janmothsob. In 2000 he wrote an epic volume titled Jonmo Jonmantor. From the early years of the eighties, the arrival of some young novelists who, later on, obtained enough popularity, was heard. Monju Sarkar, Imdadul Haq Milan and Moinul Ahsan Saber are the few but most common names in this regard. Monju Sarkar's Tamosh, Nagno Agontuk, Protima Upakhyan and Abashbhumi, Imdadul Haq Milan's Jabojjibon (written in 1976, published in 1900), Nodi Upakhyan, Bhumiputro, Poradhinota, Rajakartontro, Moinul Ahsan Saber's Adomer Jonye Opekhkha, Pathor Somoy, Char Torun Toruni, Manush Jekhane Jai Na, Dharabahik Kahin, Opeksha, Kobej Lethel, Tumi Amake Niye Jabe, Prem O Protishodh, Songsher Japon got much recognition from the literati. Shahidul Zahir, wrote his first novel Jibon O Rajnoitic Bastobota, published in 1988 while his second, till now the last, Shei Rate Purnima Chhilo came out in 1995. Magic realism, which is a recent trend of the Latin American novels, takes place in Shahidul Zahir's narration. The last decade of twentieth century is comparatively fruitful for Bangladeshi novels. Al Mahmud's novelistic exposition, Bipradas Barua's Buddhist life, Humayun Azad's brave creations, Akimun Rahman's novels about womanhood, Nasreen Jahan's novels of magic realism, Shamsuddin Abul Kalam's historic work Kanchongram is few mark of this decade. Syed Shamsul Haq's masterpiece Bristi O Bidrohigon, published in 1998, is a milestone on the past heritage and liberation war. Senior poet Al Mahmud's debut novel Dahuki came out in 1992 which was followed by Kobi O Kolahol, Upamohadesh, Kabiler Bone, Purush Sundor, Nishinda Nari etc. Bipradas Barua's major novels are Somudrochar O Bidrohira, Muktijoddhara, Shromon Goutam etc. Humayun Azad commenced his novelist carrier with Chhappanno Hajar Borgomile in 1994, which was a courageous slap on martial law and dictatorship. In no time the novel brought its writer much name and popularity. His later novels include Sab Kichu Bhene Pare, Subhabrata, Tar Samparkita Susamachar, Rajnitibidgon etc. Mohammad Nurul Huda, a renowned poet, had also two attempts in novel. Excepting Janmajati and Moinpahar he did not make any third attempt. Akimun Rahman is the first novelist ever in Bengali language in whose writing the untold and unknown secrets of womanhood are getting tongue. She has by now written four novels, Purusher Prithibite Ek Meye, Roktopunje Genthe Jawya Machhi, Pashe Shudhu Chhaya Chhilo, and Jeebaner Roudre Udechhilo Kayekti Dhulikana. Another notable novelist is Nasreen Jahan. Her first novel Urukku arrived with much appreciation. In her novels like Chondrer Prothom Kola, Chondrolekhar Jaadubistar, Sonali Mukhosh, Ure Jai Nishipakhkhi etc., she manipulated the elements of magic realism. Anisul Hoque, a journalist by profession, has established himself as a renowned writer. His Andhokarer Ekshaw Bachhar presented him a very honourable place but Ma (The Mother) has given him international reputation. Imtiar Shamim is also a young but promising name for the novels of recent Bangladesh. In Dana Kata Himer Bhetor he presented an NGO-world. His Amra Hetechhi Jara encompassed a very touching story of the sorry saga of post-independence Bangladesh life. In the first decade of 21st century, literary critic and essayist Syed Manzoorul Islam wrote some experimental novels like Adhkhana Manush, Tin Parber Jiban etc.; he also co- authored Jogajoger Gabheer Samasya Niye Kayekjan Eka Eka Lok which is one of few metafiction novels in Bengali. Agunpakhi by Hasan Azizul Huq received wide critical acclaim both in Bangladesh and India and two important literary award Prothom Alo book of the year prize in 2007 and Ananda Purashkar in 2008. Among other notable works, Shahaduz Zaman's novel Bishorgo Te Dukkho is a pioneer work of the genre of metafiction in Bengali, and his Crutch-er Colonel is a popular historical novel on the life of Colonel Taher. ==Top novels of West Bengal, India== Bankim Chandra Chatterjee {  style=\\"border:1px solid black; background-color:#F4F9FF\\" - ! 98CFFF\\"# ! 99CCFF\\"Novel ! 08CCFF\\"Author - align=center1  Durgeshnandini  Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay -  align=center2  Kapalkundala  Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay -  align=center3  Madhabi Kankan  Ramesh Chandra Dutta -  align=center4  Gora  Rabindranath Tagore -  align=center5  Ghare Baire  Rabindranath Tagore -  align=center6  Char Addhyay  Rabindranath Tagore -  align=center7  Shesher Kabita  Rabindranath Tagore -  align=center8  Noukadubi  Rabindranath Tagore -  align=center9  Pather Dabi  Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay -  align=center10  Shesh Prashna  Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay -  align=center11  Apur Sansar  Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay -  align=center12  Pather Panchali  Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay -  align=center13  Aranyak  Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay -  align=center14  Debjan  Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay -  align=center15  Ganadevata  Tarasankar Bandyopadhyay -  align=center16  Nagini Kanyar Kahini  Tarasankar Bandyopadhyay -  align=center17  Hansuli Banker Upakatha  Tarasankar Bandyopadhyay -  align=center18  Putul Nacher Itikatha  Manik Bandyopadhyay -  align=center19  Dibaratrir Kabya  Manik Bandopadhyay -  align=center20  Padma Nadir Majhi  Manik Bandyopadhyay -  align=center21  Jagari  Satinath Bhaduri -  align=center22  Antarjali Jatra  Kamal Kumar Majumdar -  align=center23  Ekhon Amar Kono Asukh Nei  Sandipan Chattopadhyay -  align=center24  Rubi Kakhan Asbe  Sandipan Chattopadhyay -  align=center25  Jiban Je Rakam  Sunil Gangopadhyay -  align=center26  Prathom Alo  Sunil Gangopadhyay -  align=center27  Sei Somoy  Sunil Gangopadhyay -  align=center28  Uttar Jahnabi  Syed Mustafa Siraj -  align=center29  Aleek Manush  Syed Mustafa Siraj -  align=center30  Trinabhumi  Syed Mustafa Siraj -  align=center31  Panchyajanya  Gajendrakumar Mitra -  align=center32  Ghunpoka  Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay -  align=center33  Purna Apurna  Bimal Kar -  align=center34  Kharkuto  Bimal Kar -  align=center35  Banpalashir Padabali  Ramapada Choudhury -  align=center36  Dweeper Naam Tiarong  Ramapada Choudhury -  align=center37  Mirar Dupur  Jyotirindra Nandi -  align=center38  Baaro Ghar Ek Uthon  Jyotirindra Nandi -  align=center39  Ei Taar Puroshkar  Jyotirindra Nandi -  align=center40  Nilkantha Pakhir Khonje  Atin Bandyopadhyay -  align=center41  Aloukik Jalajan  Atin Bandyopadhyay -  align=center42  Manusher Gharbari  Atin Bandyopadhyay -  align=center43  Dubjaley Jetuku Prashwas  Malay Roy Choudhury -  align=center44  Kheladhula  Basudeb Dasgupta -  align=center45  Bramhavargab Puran  Kamal Chakrabarty -  align=center46  Brikhu  Kamal Chakrabarty -  align=center47  Herbert  Nabarun Bhattacharya -  align=center48  Matam  Barin Ghosal -  align=center49  Suryaheen  Arupratan Ghosh -  align=center50  Lohitparer Upakatha  Samar Deb -  align=center51  Tungabhadrar Tire  Sharadindu Bandopadhyay - } ==Further reading== * Bangla Academy Lekhak Obhidhan, Bangla Academy, Dhaka, 1998 * Bangla Uponyase Chitrita Jiban O Somaj, Sudhamoy Das, Dhaka, 1995 * Purba O Pashchim Banglar Uponyas, Shahida Akter, Bangla Academy, Dhaka, 1992 * Amader Uponyase Bisoy Chetona : Bivagottor Kal, Muhammad Idris Ali, Bangla Academy, Dhaka, 1988 ==References== * Bangla Academy Charitabhidhan, Bangla Academy, Dhaka, Second Enlarged Edition, 1997 * Rafiqullah Khan, Bangladesher Uponyas: Bishay O Shilparup, Bangla Academy, Dhaka, 1997 * Syed Akram Hossain, 'Bangladesher Uponyas: Chetanaprabaha O Shilpajijnansha', Prosango Bangla Kathashahitya, Mawla Brothers, Dhaka, 1997 * Annada Sankar and Lila Ray, Bengali Literature, Pashchimbanga Bangla Academy, Kolkata, 2000 * Biswajit Ghosh, Bangladesher Uponyas, Sahitya Patrika, Vol. 28 No. 01, Dhaka University, Dhaka, 1984 * Bangladesher Uponyase Char Doshok, Kalyan Mirbar, Kolkata, 1992 * Bangladesher Koekjon Ouponyashik, Subrata Kumar Das, Dhaka, 2005 * Anya Dahan Bela, Pradip Kumar Bhadury, Aruna Prokashoni, Kolkata, 2002 Category:Bangladeshi novels Category:Bengali-language literature Category:Bangladeshi literature ","title":"Bengali novels"},{"id":"6227602","text":"==2002 D1 Grand Prix Point Series== n.b.

His father was Thomas Wilson, owner of the Thomas Wilson Sons & Co. shipping business. His brother was Charles Wilson, who was later created Baron Nunburnholme. Like his brother, he was educated at Kingston College in Hull. He was associated with Charles throughout his life, and became the head of the business after his brother's death in 1907. Before this, he served as director of the North Eastern Railway, and chairman of the shipping committee of the Hull Chamber of Commerce. He became High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1891. For the last twenty years of his life, his London home was 17 Grosvenor Place, a building which now serves as the embassy of Ireland. Wilson's son Arthur entered Parliament as a Unionist for the Holderness division of Yorkshire in 1900. Wilson himself was active in protecting the Liberal interest in Yorkshire, but spoke against Gladstone's Home Rule bill, and joined the Liberal Unionists. In 1909, he spoke in favour of Tariff reform. In 1907, Wilson became head of the shipping business following the death of his brother Charles. He died of cancer, two years later. Wilson was a generous benefactor to Hull, and is especially remembered for the Victoria Children's Hospital, for which he served as Chairman. ==Royal baccarat scandal== Arthur Wilson is best remembered for playing host, at Tranby Croft in 1890, to Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. During the Prince's stay, one of the party, William Gordon-Cumming, was accused of cheating at the game of baccarat. Baccarat was illegal in England at the time. Several members of Wilson's household at Tranby Croft claimed to have independently witnessed Gordon-Cumming cheating at the game, and when this was brought to the attention of the Prince, Gordon-Cumming signed a document promising never to play cards in the future. This event remained secret for a time, but it was revealed to the press in early 1891. As a result, Gordon-Cumming attempted to bring the accusers, including Wilson, to trial on the charge of defamation. Gordon-Cumming lost the court case, but it brought the Prince much bad publicity, and he never returned to Tranby Croft. == See also == *Oswald Sanderson ==References== * == External links == *Link to details of a book on the Wilson Line history *Glasgow Archives Wilson Line collection *Hull in print history *Hull Maritime museum *University of Hull archives Category:1836 births Category:1909 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Kingston upon Hull Category:High Sheriffs of Yorkshire Category:Alumni of Kingston College (England) ","title":"Arthur Wilson (shipping magnate)"},{"id":"6227615","text":"ACT is a lossy ADPCM 8 kbit/s compressed audio format recorded by most Chinese MP3 and MP4 players with a recording function, and voice recorders.

He attended the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, and was captain of the Cadet golf team. He suffered from a debilitating illness known then as manic-depressive illness, but today it is more commonly called bipolar disorder. His illness first manifested itself during his senior year at West Point. He spent nine months in an Army psychiatric hospital in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, before being honorably discharged. Yancey's condition was largely in remission until 1974, which allowed him to participate in competitive golf. He won seven PGA Tour events in 13 seasons. He also had six top-5 finishes in major championships: 1967 Masters (3rd), 1968 Masters (3rd), 1968 U.S. Open (3rd), 1970 Masters (4th), 1973 British Open (5th), 1974 U.S. Open (T-3). In 1974, Yancey's illness resurfaced and led him to be involved in a series of bizarre incidents, for which he was at various times arrested, incarcerated, and institutionalized. One such incident occurred at LaGuardia Airport in 1975. Yancey climbed up on a ladder in the terminal and ordered all white people to one side and all black people to the other, and then proceeded to preach on the evils of racism. During the same incident, he claimed to have all of Howard Hughes' money and stated that he was going to use it to cure cancer. Yancey credited Dr. Jane Parker of Payne Whitney Hospital for correctly diagnosing his condition and prescribing lithium. Lithium, however, caused him to have hand tremors, which forced him to retire from competitive golf. He was able to resume competitive play, however, when Tegretol became available. Yancey was eventually able to return to life as a productive member of society. In 1984, he took a teaching pro job at three South Carolina clubs. He joined the Senior PGA Tour after reaching the age of 50 in August 1988. During the last five years of his life he became a devoted public speaker and advocate for those with mental illnesses. He formed Bogeys, Birdies & Bert, a group ‚Äúfor the education and support of depressive illnesses‚Äù in an effort to spread the message on manic depression and mental illness. He also put on seminars, golfing clinics, tournaments and other charitable events to raise money to treat illness and educate the public. ==Legacy== Yancey suffered a fatal heart attack in 1994 at age 56 at the Franklin Quest Championship in Park City, Utah. While on the practice tee preparing for the first round, he experienced discomfort and made a second visit to the first aid tent; he went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later. Yancey is interred at Oakland Cemetery in Tallahassee, Florida, not far from his boyhood home. He was survived by his wife, Cheryl, their daughter, Andrea, Bert's children from a previous marriage, daughter Tracy and three sons Charles, Scott and Jeffrey, and two grandchildren. The Bert Yancey Mental Health Golf Tournament, based in Augusta, Georgia, is held annually to benefit local chapters of non-profit national organizations Mental Health America, National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. ==Professional wins (10)PGA Tour wins (7)=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !To par !Margin of victory !Runner(s)-up - align=center1 align=rightApr 17, 1966 Azalea Open Invitational 74-69-67-68=278 align=center‚àí10 1 stroke  Bob Johnson - align=center2 align=rightJun 5, 1966 Memphis Open Invitational 63-69-67-66=265 align=center‚àí15 5 strokes  Gene Littler - align=center3 align=rightSep 18, 1966 Portland Open Invitational 68-68-68-67=271 align=center‚àí17 3 strokes  Billy Casper - align=center4 align=rightApr 24, 1967 Dallas Open Invitational 68-69-67-71=274 align=center‚àí6 1 stroke  Roberto De Vicenzo, Kermit Zarley - align=center5 align=rightMay 25, 1969 Atlanta Classic 71-68-69-69=277 align=center‚àí11 Playoff  Bruce Devlin - align=center6 align=rightJan 25, 1970 Bing Crosby National Pro-Am 67-70-72-69=278 align=center‚àí10 1 stroke  Jack Nicklaus - align=center7 align=rightJul 23, 1972 American Golf Classic 69-68-67-72=276 align=center‚àí4 Playoff  Tom Ulozas } PGA Tour playoff record (2‚Äì2) {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent(s)!!Result -D0F0C0;\\" align=center1 1969 Atlanta Classic  Bruce Devlin Won with birdie on second extra hole -F08080;\\" align=center2 1970 Kaiser International Open Invitational  Ken Still, Lee Trevino Still won with birdie on first extra hole -F08080;\\" align=center3 1971 Robinson Open Golf Classic  Labron Harris Jr. Lost to birdie on third extra hole -D0F0C0;\\" align=center4 1972 American Golf Classic  Tom Ulozas Won with par on first extra hole } ===Other wins (3)=== this list is probably incomplete *1962 South Carolina Open *1963 Pennsylvania Open Championship *1969 Argentine Masters ==Playoff record== Japan Golf Tour playoff record (0‚Äì1) {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result -F2C1D1;\\" align=center1 1973 Taiheiyo Club Masters  Masashi Ozaki Lost three-hole aggregate playoff; Ozaki: ‚àí1 (3-3-4=10), Yancey: +2 (4-5-4=13) } ==Results in major championships== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1964 !1965 !1966 !1967 !1968 !1969 !1970 !1971 !1972 !1973 !1974 !1975 - align=leftMasters Tournament eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"3 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"3 T13 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"4 CUT T12 T51 eeeeee;\\" T30 - align=leftU.S. Open WD eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" T42 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"3 T22 T22 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T9 T11 T25 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T3 CUT - align=leftThe Open Championship eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" T43 T42 T16 T13 T11 T19 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"5 eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftPGA Championship eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" T49 WD T23 CUT T22 T22 T29 T24 T32 eeeeee;\\" } WD = withdrew CUT = missed the half-way cut \\"T\\" indicates a tie for a place ===Summary=== { class= style=text- align:center !Tournament !!

His mother, Penka, died during the birth but miraculously, he survived. In the village of his mother, Vishovgrad, Petko saw nightingales (slavey in Bulgarian), which impressed him so much that he decided to change his family name to Slaveykov. Slaveykov studied consecutively in Tarnovo, Dryanovo, Tryavna and the Transfiguration Monastery, and also self-educated himself by reading books in the monastery libraries near Tarnovo. He also read the noted Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya by Paisius of Hilendar, and later studied in Svishtov (under Emanuil Vaskidovich), extended his knowledge of Greek and got acquainted with the works of Western European and Serbian literature. Slaveykov became a teacher in his home town in 1843, but was expelled for the famous satirical poem Tarnovo became famous for renowned Greek bishops, and consecutively taught in various towns, including Vidin, Vratsa, Pleven, Berkovitsa, Lyaskovets, Byala and Elena. He taught according to the Bell-Lancaster method and meanwhile continued to educate himself. Slaveykov worked as a teacher in the first class school in Elena and named it Daskalolivnitsata (\\"the Teacher Moulder\\"). ===Cultural activity and Istanbul period=== Slaveykov engaged in important cultural and educational activity and had collected 2263 folk songs, sayings and proverbs until 1847. Nikola Mihaylovski introduced him to the Russian poets and writers of the time. Since 1852, Slaveykov began to print his first books: Smesena kitka, Pesnopoyka, Basnenik. He wrote the poem Boyka voyvoda in 1853 influenced by the revolutionary events surrounding the Crimean War (1853-1856), as well as many revolutionary songs. After the unsuccessful Uprising of Dyado Nikola in Tarnovo in 1856, Slaveykov concentrated his efforts in the awakening of the national consciousness among Bulgarians. As a teacher in Targovishte he issued the satirical newspaper Gayda and after working in Varna for some time left for Istanbul, where he was invited in 1864 to edit a full Bulgarian translation of the Bible (in an east Bulgarian dialect) by the Bulgarian Bible Society. The entire translation was printed in Istanbul in 1871 and was of great importance for the establishment of the east Bulgarian vernacular as the common one. In Istanbul Slaveykov issued the newspapers Gayda (1863-1867) and Makedoniya (1866-1872) and the magazines Ruzhitsa (1871), Pchelitsa (1871), Chitalishte (1872-1873), Zvanchatiy glumcho (1872), as well as the newspapers Shutosh (1873-1874) and Kosturka (1874). He established himself as arguably the most famous Bulgarian writer in Istanbul in the time, issued more than 60 books, newspapers and magazines, both original and translated. He took part in the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian church and later became a teacher in the newly established Bulgarian Exarchate. He was arrested for the article Dvete kasti i vlasti in the Makedoniya newspaper and accused of relations with the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee in Bucharest. Pencho (left sculpture) as immortalized on Slaveykov Square in Sofia ===Revolutionary and political activity=== In 1873 Slaveykov created the well-known poem Izvorat na Belonogata (\\"The Spring of the White-Legged\\") and founded the Bulgarian high school in Odrin in 1874, where he countered the Greek influence over the Bulgarians. Later a teacher in Stara Zagora, Slaveykov wrote revolutionary poems and was enchained and imprisoned after the April Uprising. During the fire in Stara Zagora he lost his manuscripts and the 15,000 collected folk sayings. During the Russo- Turkish War of 1877-78 he drew closer together with the Russian forces, led the detachment of General Mikhail Skobelev through the Balkan Mountains, witnessed the Battle of Shipka and accompanied the army to San Stefano near Istanbul. After the Liberation of Bulgaria of Ottoman rule in 1878 Slaveykov struggled for a democratic constitution together with Petko Karavelov as a deputy in the first Grand National Assembly, became the Chairman of the National Assembly of Bulgaria in 1880, Minister of the Enlightenment and the Internal Affairs (1880-1881), issued the newspapers Osten (1879), Tselokupna Balgariya (1879), Nezavisimost (1880-1883), Tarnovska konstitutsiya (1884), Istina (1886), Sofiyski dnevnik (1886) and Pravda (1888). Because of his pronouncedly democratic ideas and his participation in the political struggles he was arrested, forbidden to teach and his pension was reduced. Deeply embittered, he died on 1 July 1895 in Sofia. Slaveykov had a total of eight children, among whom the politicians Ivan Slaveykov and Hristo Slaveykov, the publicist Racho Slaveykov and the fellow poet Pencho Slaveykov. ==Works== Both in his original and imitative works Slaveykov further developed the Bulgarian language. He wrote patriotic songs and poems, love and landscape lyric poetry under the influence of Russian poets Aleksandr Pushkin, Afanasy Fet and Nikolay Karamzin. Parts of his historical patriotic poems likely influenced by Paisius' Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya have been preserved: Krumiada, Kralev Marko, Samuilka, Gergana. He issued two collections of folk songs, in 1860 and 1868, and restored the collected proverbs, numbering 17,000. Besides being a poet, writer and journalist, Slaveykov also left his mark on the Bulgarian literature as a translator, philologist, folklorist, the originator of Bulgarian children's literature and author of textbooks. He also worked in the spheres of geography, history and biography. He printed Balgarski pritchi, poslovitsi i harakterni dumi, researched the Bulgarian customs, ritual system, demonology and psychology, and wrote under many pseudonyms. ==Honour== Petko R. Slaveykov's Grave in Sofia Central Cemetery Slaveykov Peak in Imeon Range on Smith Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Petko Slaveykov. ==NotesFurther reading== * ==External links== * * *Gabrovsko- to Uchilishte i Negovy-tie P≈≠rvi Popechiteli, (The Gabrovo School and Its First Trustees) From the Early Bulgarian Imprint Collection at the Library of Congress *Smietka na dusheprikashtiky-tie V.E.

The firm was made up of engineers and focussed on shipbuilding and repair. Its most notable association was with the Wilson Line, for whom the yard produced many ships. Earle's also built vessels for many other British shipping firms, especially those operating on North Sea routes such as the Great Eastern Railway and the Hull & Netherlands Steamship Co. Ltd. In 1871, Earle's was restructured as a joint-stock company and for a short time Sir Edward James Reed served as its chairman and managing director. Earle's built two steam yachts for Tsarevitch Alexander: Slavanka in 1873 and Czarevna in 1874. Also in 1874 Earle's built the unsuccessful , Sir Henry Bessemer's experimental swinging-cabin paddle steamer, which made its maiden (and only) public voyage in 1875. Earle's built the yacht Bosphorous for Khedive Isma'il of Egypt and later built other yachts for wealthy clients. Earle's was an early adopter of triple-expansion engines, for example installing them in the liner that the company built for Wilson Line in 1882. Reed had been chief constructor to the Admiralty and helped Earle's to win a number of naval orders including the ironclad warships (1874) and (1875) for the Chilean Navy Later naval orders included two s for the Royal Navy (RN): launched in 1891 and launched in 1892. In 1895 the company built two s for the RN. ==Liquidation and takeover== Earle's faced difficulties when Charles died and William was taken ill. In the latter part of the 1890s, the firm suffered both cash-flow problems and a labour shortage, and in 1900, it entered voluntary liquidation. However, Charles Wilson bought the firm for about ¬£170,000, keeping the Earle's name, but making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilson Line. In 1904, Earle's built for the Peruvian Corporation, a UK-owned company that ran Peru's railways. She was built as a \\"knock down\\" ship; that is, she was bolted together at Earle's shipyard, then all her parts were marked with numbers, unbolted and packed into crates, and then shipped in kit form to Peru, where they were transported inland, reassembled with rivets, and in 1905 launched on Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world. In the 1920s Inca needed a new bottom, so Earle's made one in kit form and shipped that to Peru as well. In 1929, Earle's built a larger \\"knock down\\" ship for the Peruvian Corporation, , which was launched on Lake Titicaca in 1931. By now, manufacturing in the UK was declining in the Great Depression and after Ollanta, Earle's built only three more ships. The UK government sponsored a rationalisation of the shipbuilding industry, and in 1932, the National Shipbuilders Securities (NSS) took over Earle's. NSS sold Earle's tools and machinery, shipping the yard's large crane and other equipment to Kowloon in Hong Kong. The terms of Earle's closure included a restrictive covenant on the site of the yard proscribing any shipbuilding there for the following 60 years. ==Surviving Earle's ship== At least one Earle's-built ship survives. Ollanta, now retired from scheduled ferry service, is leased out by PeruRail for charter tourist cruises on Lake Titicaca. ==References== Category:Defunct companies of Kingston upon Hull Category:Defunct shipbuilding companies of the United Kingdom Category:British companies established in 1845 Category:British companies disestablished in 1932 Category:Industry in Kingston upon Hull ","title":"Earle's Shipbuilding"},{"id":"6227696","text":"The Amory Wars is an ongoing series of science fiction comic books and novels created by Coheed and Cambria frontman Claudio Sanchez and published by Evil Ink Comics. The name also refers to the fictional conflict at the center of the story, which is told across the published works and is also the primary focus of most of the band‚Äôs music. Each of Coheed and Cambria‚Äôs studio albums (with the exception of 2015‚Äôs The Color Before the Sun) tells a chapter in the saga originally narrated by Sanchez‚Äôs lyrics. The band also makes use of recurring melodies, self-referencing musical and lyrical cues in certain songs that reference key moments in The Amory Wars mythology. Some individual songs on these albums (e.g., \\"The Crowing\\", \\"Everything Evil\\", \\"Three Evils\\") use a particular song structure known as \\"terminally climactic form\\" in order to depict a particularly violent action from the story. Because the mythos isn‚Äôt wholly comprehensible through the music and lyrics alone, Sanchez created The Amory Wars comics and novels to better depict the story‚Äôs events and characters. ==Plot summary== The Amory Wars is set in Heaven‚Äôs Fence, a collection of 78 planets and seven stars, held in place by interconnecting beams of energy known as the ‚ÄúKeywork‚Äù. Year of the Black Rainbow and Second Stage Turbine Blade narrate the struggle of Coheed Kilgannon and Cambria Kilgannon against Wilhelm Ryan, the Supreme Tri-Mage who launches a war campaign with the intended goal to rule over Heaven‚Äôs Fence. The story arcs In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3, Good Apollo, I‚Äôm Burning Star IV: Vol. 1 ‚Äì From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness, and Good Apollo, I‚Äôm Burning Star IV: Vol. 2 ‚Äì No World For Tomorrow focus on the heroic journey of Claudio Kilgannon, son of Coheed and Cambria, and his journey to assume the mantle of The Crowing, foretold savior of Heaven‚Äôs Fence. Set long before the events of the previous chapters, The Afterman: Ascension and The Afterman: Descension tell the story of Dr. Sirius Amory, a scientist who enters the Keywork in an attempt to understand its mysterious energy. Vaxis ‚Äì Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures is the first of five story arcs that continue the original Amory Wars saga and follows the story of Creature and Sister Spider, who are incarcerated within the prison planet known as the Dark Sentencer. ==Timeline== The story arcs within The Amory Wars universe follow a fictional timeline, and are connected by continuity of events, characters, and locations. Coheed and Cambria‚Äôs first four studio album releases told the main story in chronological order, with each release picking up the story where the last album left off: # The Second Stage Turbine Blade # In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 # Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness # Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow Although No World For Tomorrow has yet to receive a published comic or novel, and therefore its events are largely left to speculation, it acted as a conclusion to the original Amory Wars tale. 2010‚Äôs Year of the Black Rainbow acts as a prequel that sets up the events that take place in the previous four albums, following many of the same characters. Together, The Afterman: Ascension (2012) and The Afterman: Descension (2013) told a new story set even earlier in the timeline than the first five releases. These albums focused on new characters while elaborating on previously introduced concepts. The 2018 album Vaxis ‚Äì Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures is the first story arc to take place after the original tetralogy. Much like The Afterman albums, it focuses on an entirely new cast and setting within the Amory Wars universe. This chapter is set to be the first of five in the Vaxis story arc, and its connections to the previous events in the timeline will become more apparent in the coming iterations. ==Production== In 2004, the first graphic series related to the Amory Wars was published with Evil Ink‚Äôs release of The Bag on Line Adventures: The Second Stage Turbine Blade, written by Claudio Sanchez and illustrated by Wes Abbott. However, after two issues were published, the project was discontinued due to creative roadblocks including Sanchez‚Äôs touring schedule with Coheed and Cambria. These original issues were later included in The Amory Wars: The Second Stage Turbine Blade Ultimate Edition. Evil Ink then released the Good Apollo, I‚Äôm Burning Star IV: Volume One ‚Äì From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness graphic novel in 2005 to accompany the release of Coheed and Cambria‚Äôs third studio album of the same name. This publication was again written by Sanchez, and illustrated by Christopher Shy. Unlike the previous release for Second Stage Turbine Blade, this graphic novel told the entire story of the Good Apollo Vol. 1 album, though many details were still unclear. During a 2006 interview, Claudio cited financial constraints for the irregular and unfinished release of the story‚Äôs publications, and explained that Evil Ink intended to publish new comics under the title The Amory Wars that would retell the concept chronologically. Throughout 2007, Evil Ink released the first volume of The Amory Wars: The Second Stage Turbine Blade, which consisted of five issues written by Claudio Sanchez and illustrated by Gus Vasquez (Chapters 1 and 2) and Mike S. Miller (Chapters 3 - 5). The second volume was released over the course of 2008, consisting of five more chapters written by Sanchez with artist Gabriel Guzman providing illustration. On August 15, 2017, BOOM! Studios released The Amory Wars: The Second Stage Turbine Blade Ultimate Edition, which included all 10 issues, as well as the both issues original out-of-print Bag On Line Adventures: The Second Stage Turbine Blade, and a new bonus story ‚Äì 33 written by Sanchez and illustrated by Dave Hamann. On April 13, 2010, Coheed and Cambria released their fifth studio album Year of the Black Rainbow. The deluxe version of the album included a novel co-written by Sanchez and Peter David, which narrates the album‚Äôs story, which takes place prior to the events of The Second Stage Turbine Blade and acts as a prequel to The Amory Wars saga. In 2010, Claudio again enlisted David to co-write the comic adaptation of the band‚Äôs second studio album. Evil Ink released the first issue of The Amory Wars: In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 on May 26, 2010. The story was told across a series of 12 comics released throughout 2010 and 2011, with Chris Burnham illustrating chapters 1 ‚Äì 7, and Aaron Kuder illustrating the remaining 8 ‚Äì 12. All twelve chapters were later compiled and released as The Amory Wars: In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 Ultimate Edition by BOOM! Studios on April 10, 2018. Coheed and Cambria‚Äôs sixth and seventh albums, respectively titled The Afterman: Ascension (released 2012) and The Afterman: Descension (released 2013), each had their story told in a similar manner to Year of the Black Rainbow. The albums‚Äô Deluxe Editions each included a limited-edition coffee table book that featured the story of each song written by Sanchez and illustrations Nathan Spoor. The band announced on January 24, 2017, that Evil Ink would be releasing a The Amory Wars: Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness to coincide with their anniversary tour for their third studio album (dubbed Neverender: GAIBSIV). Co-written by Sanchez and his wife Chondra Echert, this new adaptation told the full version of the album‚Äôs story than depicted in the 2004 graphic novel. The story was illustrated by Rags Morales, and released across twelve issues that ran from April 5, 2017, through October 10, 2018. As with the first two installments of The Amory Wars comics, BOOM! Studios released a hardcover Ultimate Edition on October 8, 2019, which includes all twelve issues as well as the original graphic novel. After taking a break from their mythology on their 2015 album, The Color Before the Sun, Coheed and Cambria released their ninth album, Vaxis ‚Äì Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures, on October 5, 2018. The album began a new story set after the events of the previous album‚Äôs mythology, and the deluxe box-set version of the album included a novella written by Sanchez and Echert with illustrations by artist Chase Stone. While there has yet to be an official release of the story told in the band's fourth studio album, Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow, the band has confirmed that the comic is next to be released. On February 4, 2020, Coheed and Cambria announced the No World For Tomorrow Neverender Tour, during which the band will tour the United States and perform the album in its entirety at each show from May 5, 2020, through May 29, 2020. In an official email sent to fans, the group stated that ‚ÄúAfter the tour, we look to launch the NWFT series of The Amory Wars,‚Äù meaning that the story for No World for Tomorrow, and the conclusion of the original Amory Wars story, will be officially published for the first time since its release in 2007. ==The Bag.On.Line Adventures== The original name of the story was The Bag.On.Line Adventures of Coheed and Cambria. This would also be the name of the first chapter of their story and the respective album (chronologically, from the story's standpoint, Bag.On.Line Adventures would come before Second Stage Turbine Blade). The Bag.On.Line Adventures would essentially work as a prequel and would follow the story of Coheed, Cambria, and Jesse as part of an anti-terrorist agency called the K.B.I., which stood for the Knowledge (referring to Cambria and her ability to see the future and other events), the Beast (referring to Coheed and his ability to fight his way out of basically any tight situation), and the Inferno (referring to Jesse, the burning heart and soul of the KBI). The name \\"Bag.On.Line\\" came from a shop across from Claudio Sanchez's apartment during the trip to Paris in which he first conceptualized the Coheed and Cambria saga. Since then, Coheed & Cambria have released the prequel to Second Stage Turbine Blade, titled Year of the Black Rainbow. ==The Amory Wars Sketchbook== After Sanchez changed the name to The Amory Wars, he also released a sketchbook, illustrated by Gus Vasquez, which plots out the next comic. Originally dubbed \\"Comic Zero\\" , \\"The Amory Wars Sketchbook\\" was released at ComicCon. Later, the Evil Ink website began selling the sketchbook in limited release. This comic explains the very beginning of the Keywork and Heaven's Fence. Years pass and the comic ends introducing Coheed Kilgannon on his home planet of Hetricus. ==The Second Stage Turbine Blade== First released in the summer of 2004, the original two comic books narrate the events of approximately the first third of Coheed and Cambria's concept album The Second Stage Turbine Blade of 2002. They introduce central characters, including the villains Wilhelm Ryan and Mayo Deftinwolf who orchestrate a sinister plot to murder the children of Coheed and Cambria Kilgannon in order to use the dormant Monstar virus hidden within Coheed to destroy the Keywork. Claudio Kilgannon escapes murder at the hands of his parents, who have been tricked into believing that their children may cause the destruction of humanity if left alive, and becomes the protagonist of later chapters. These early issues, which were inked by Wes Abbott, are now out of print. Gus Vasquez began illustrating the re-release of The Amory Wars, which begins with the first issue of The Second Stage Turbine Blade. Vasquez's participation in the production of this series was short-lived as Mike Miller took over after the second issue and illustrated 3-5. The first five issues in the miniseries represent \\"The Second Stage Turbine Blade: Volume 1\\" and cover the first half of the chapter. The first issue was released June 13, and subsequent issues were released monthly. It was published by Claudio's company Evil Ink Comics along with the help of Image Comics and 12 Gauge Comics,12 Gauge Comics :: The Amory Wars :: from Coheed & Cambria's Claudio Sanchez and cover art was illustrated by Tony Moore of The Walking Dead fame. The first five issues were released as a paperback graphic novel with a brand new cover by usual cover artist Tony Moore. A special variant cover was released as well and only sold in Hot Topic retail stores. The 5 issues (6-10) in Part II were illustrated by Gabriel Guzman and were released as a paperback graphic novel with cover art by Tony Moore on December 9, 2009. In August 2010, these two volumes of five comics were released together in a single hardcover edition titled \\"The Amory Wars: Ultimate Edition\\". The two original issues by Wes Abbott, as well as the cover artwork for all twelve comics are also included in the back of this 350-page release. ==In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3== The second part of the Amory Wars, In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 is a twelve-part comic series written by Claudio Sanchez and Peter David, who both co-wrote the Year of the Black Rainbow novel, with artwork by Chris Burnham. The first issue was released on May 26, 2010, and the second issue was released on June 23, 2010. The series was later collected into three trade paperback volumes each containing four issues. The corresponding album of the same name from Coheed and Cambria was released in late 2003. A small summary of the chapter's plot was published on the former Evil Ink Comics website: > Ten years after the \\"‚Ä¶Turbine Blade\\", son Claudio emerges from the depths of > Shylos Ten, the Fence's \\"quiet\\" planet where the Red Army performs its > brutal interrogations and imprisonments. In finding out that his entire > family has been murdered, Claudio begins his quest for vendetta. His foes, > Supreme Tri-Mage Wilhelm Ryan and General Mayo Deftinwolf sense that he is > still alive and holds special powers. They know they must stop him before he > defeats them. Meanwhile, Inferno (Jesse Kilgannon) takes up arms against the > Red Army (‚ÄúMan your Battlestations‚Äù) in an effort to seek the same kind of > vengeance on him. In Claudio‚Äôs re-emergence he teams up with Ambellina, the > Prise who is cast out by her peers and forced to be his guide. The pair > along with Sizer, a disassembled IRO-bot, seek out Inferno to find answers > as to why his family were killed, but their plans take an unexpected turn in > a ship called The Camper Velourium, piloted by a believed to be racist > psychopath named Al. ==Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness== thumb A graphic novel titled Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness, illustrated by Christopher Shy, was released in September 2005 along with the album of the same name. The story of Good Apollo takes a step outside the science fiction narrative of the first three chapters and examines the life of The Writer, a character who is crafting the lives of the protagonist Claudio and his companions in the form of a fictional story. Through a series of delusional conversations with his ten speed bicycle about an unfaithful former lover, The Writer decides he must kill the Prise Ambellina to properly end his story. The events in the narrative itself build up to a final confrontation between Jesse's rebel forces and the Red Army of Supreme Tri-Mage Wilhelm Ryan under the command of General Mayo Deftinwolf, as well as a literal meeting of the Writer and Claudio culminating in the death of Ambellina and Claudio's emergence as the Crowing. The new Amory Wars series, illustrated by Rags Morales, retells the story of Good Apollo. Claudio stated that a lot was lost from the graphic novel because of financial constraints. He further explained that although Christopher Shy's art is beautiful, it was not the best medium for Good Apollo's story-telling. Claudio looks forward to releasing a new version in chronological order so that the story will make more sense. ==The Amory Wars: Good Apollo== The first issue of The Amory Wars: Good Apollo released on April 5th, 2017 by Evil Ink Comics and BOOM! Studios. Illustrated by Rags Morales with colors by Emilio Lopez, this series chronicles the main plot points of the original graphic novel and also sets the stage for the next series with a twist in the final confrontation between Jesse and Mayo Deftinwolf. That series is currently in the outlining stage. The Good Apollo series concluded on October 10th, 2018. It is currently collected in three trade paperbacks with an ultimate collected edition coming soon. ==Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow== Apart from the album, no story mediums for Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow have been released, but the new series will introduce its story. ==Year of the Black Rainbow== Year of the Black Rainbow is the prequel of the Amory Wars. The album of the same name was released April 13, 2010, and with it came a 352-page novel detailing the events of the story. It tells of how Wilhelm Ryan came to power by killing or abducting all the other Mages. A mysterious black rainbow also appears in the sky the day Ryan takes supremacy. A civilian, named Doctor Leonard Hohenberger, is dissatisfied with the Supreme Tri-Mage's rule and is inspired by the Prise to create three IRO-bots, known as the KBI: Cambria (\\"Knowledge\\"), Coheed (\\"Beast\\"), and Jesse (\\"Inferno\\"). While the KBI are out on the other planets of Heaven's Fence, destroying everything Ryan had made, Hohenberger's wife, Pearl, is kidnapped by Mayo Deftinwolf. Deftinwolf offers the Doctor an ultimatum; if the Doctor will help Ryan create a virus that has the potential to destroy Heaven's Fence (the Monstar virus), Pearl will be returned to him. If Hohenberger refuses, Pearl dies. Leonard creates the virus, but locks it inside the bodies of Coheed and Cambria so Ryan cannot immediately use it, giving the Doctor time to create a cure. Ryan takes Coheed and Cambria to his stronghold to figure out how to extract the virus. In return for his treachery, the Tri-Mage sends Pearl back with a gun, after telling her that Leonard had helped Ryan cause the downfall of the universe. However, back home, Pearl finds she cannot kill her husband, and instead kills herself. Leonard leaves a set of instructions for Inferno, and sets out to get revenge by attempting to kill Mayo Deftinwolf. The assassination fails, and the Doctor himself is killed instead. Meanwhile, Inferno follows the Doctor's instructions and discovers he has made a cure for the Monstar in the form of another IRO-bot, named Josephine. With new hope, Inferno flies to Ryan's stronghold, the House Atlantic. He breaks in and saves Coheed and Cambria, mutilating Deftinwolf in the process. While Inferno is gone, his troops rain down firepower on the House Atlantic from their ship, the Grail Arbor. After the KBI have left, the Grail Arbor fully destroys House Atlantic. Ryan himself almost dies, but is rescued at the last moment by Vielar Crom, a soldier taken from one of the opposing Mages' armies. Ryan vows for revenge as he flies off. The black rainbow also disappears once he is gone. Meanwhile, in the epilogue of the story, Inferno, still following Hohenberger's orders, wipes the minds of Coheed and Cambria to make them think they are an ordinary couple and Josephine is their newborn daughter. He wishes them the best as they begin their new lives with no memory of the KBI or the events of this story. ==The Afterman== A compilation of the lyrics, artwork, and story content associated with The Afterman: Ascension, written by Claudio Sanchez and co-written by Peter David, was released with the deluxe edition on October 9, 2012. The story chronologically precedes the events that take place in the Year of the Black Rainbow. However, it is technically not a part of The Amory Wars saga, even though it takes place within the same universe. ===Ascension=== Focusing on the famous cosmonaut Sirius Amory (pronounced SY- rus A-mer-EE), the story describes Amory's scientific investigation of \\"the Keywork\\", which, up until this point, has only been identified as a mysterious energy source that supplies nutrients to the 78 planets that make up Heaven's Fence. This expedition is overwhelmingly discouraged by Amory's wife, Meri, who considers it to be nothing short of suicide. Despite Meri's disapproval, Sirius goes forward with his mission. As the sole passenger on his spacecraft, the Meriwell, Amory's only companion is a computer system known as the All Mother, which also operates inside his spacesuit. The All Mother is tasked with analyzing and reporting Sirius' vital conditions throughout his mission as well as recording his findings. In order to obtain samples of the Keywork, Sirius leaves his ship and enters the energy source, his suit and the All Mother being the only things preventing him from instantaneous death. Quickly, Amory identifies the true source of the Keywork's energy as being the souls of those that have died. The souls maintain the characteristics and personalities of their previous lives and have the ability to infuse themselves with Amory. The first entity to come into contact with Sirius is Domino the Destitute. As the entity takes control of the cosmonaut, Amory relives the life of Domino. Domino the Destitute In life, Domino was an up-and-coming boxer who, with the help of his brother Chess, achieved victories and attracted the attention of a crime boss, Kriptor Noncruss. Despite initial success, Domino allowed the world of fortune and fame to corrupt him. Over-indulgence in alcohol and drugs resulted in him faltering in the abilities he had worked so hard to achieve and severely strained the relationship between him and his brother. The final effort to save his career, which involved him going toe-to- toe with a champion boxer known as the Saul \\"the Ghostmaker\\" Maven, resulted in Domino getting knocked out in the last round. After this failure, Domino was left bankrupt and homeless. As the last chance to redeem himself, Kriptor ordered Domino to rob an armored truck. He then enticed his brother to join him with the promise of fortune, a proposal to which Chess agreed. The robbery went awry, resulting in the death of Chess. After watching his brother die, Domino committed suicide. Back in the Keywork, the entity of Domino the Destitute releases a destructive frequency through the All Mother, destroying Sirius' ship and severely injuring Amory in the process. The destruction of his ship is identified by scientists and it is declared that Sirius Amory had died in the explosion. Meri curses Sirius for being selfish and taking it upon himself to find the answers of Heaven's Fence. She goes to a bar in order to deal with her emotions and is almost drugged with a benzodiazepine, saved only by a police officer who witnessed a man slip the pill into her drink. It is then foreshadowed that this police officer would become Meri's new love interest. In the Keywork, Sirius remains vulnerable to the entities. The next spirit to take control of him is Holly Wood the Cracked. Holly Wood the Cracked In life, Holly Wood was a fanatical follower of an artist known as Madame Crisis Maroe (MCM). Through plastic surgery and physical alterations, Holly Wood attempted, at all costs, to become an exact replication of MCM. The surgeries backfired and left her physically deformed. Coping with insanity, Holly Wood decided that the only way to become MCM was to kill the artist and take her place. Witnessing the events first hand, as if he were Holly Wood, Sirius tries at all costs to stop the murder but is unsuccessful. Immediately after being released from the entity of Holly Wood the Cracked, a third entity takes control of Sirius. Vic the Butcher In life, Vic the Butcher was a decorated military general. He committed atrocious war crimes but hid them from the public by harming the soldiers under him and threatening their families if they reported him. One soldier, known as Sentry, refused to cave to these threats and stood up to Vic. This resulted in Sentry being hanged and Vic moving on with his life. Years later, Vic is indicted for his human rights violations. Instead of facing his inner demons, Vic sets his apartment, room 184, on fire. This results in the entire building burning down, including a nursery on the first floor. Sirius is then released from Vic the Butcher and receives severe health warnings from the All Mother. He is on the verge of death and has no method of going home. Just in time, a completely different type of entity takes control of him, protecting him from the grasps of Domino, Holly and Vic, and begins to soothe his wounds. Evagria the Faithful In life, Evagria was a wonderful human being. She spent countless hours helping those in need and attempting to improve the lives of everyone around her. As she aged, Evagria was diagnosed with a rare and incurable bone disease. Surrounded by her loving friends and family, Evagria succumbed to the disease and died. Inside the Keywork, Evagria takes Sirius (now identified by the entities as The Afterman) to the next plane of the afterlife. The end of The Afterman: Ascension describes Sirius' admittance that he was unfair to Meri, putting his own ambitions before her well being and emotional security. He becomes regretful of his decisions as he slips even further into the Keywork. ===Descension=== The Afterman: Descension begins with Sirius still encompassed in the protective aura of Evagria; however, she has become weakened due to the cost of energy necessary to keep The Afterman alive. As her power drains, Amory is convinced that these will be the last moments of his life. It is at this crucial time that Sirius is saved by the entity of Sentry the Defiant, the soldier who gave his life to evince the brutality of Vic the Butcher. Sentry the Defiant In life, Sentry was the opposite of Vic. He worked his way up the ranks through hard work and conviction. When ordered by Vic to bomb an off-world structure, which would undoubtedly cause the deaths of innocent people, Sentry defies the order and tells another Sergeant about Vic's ruthlessness. Planning to report the incident to the field marshal, Sentry is hanged in the barracks by Vic. Out of fear, the murder was not reported for years until an overwhelming amount of evidence against Vic entices individuals to speak out against his war crimes. As the entities of Vic and Sentry continue to battle in the Keywork, Sirius realizes that Sentry must forgo his worldly emotions and move on in the afterlife. Conversing with Sentry, Amory convinces him that the entity's existence is not defined by one event. Realizing this, Sentry crosses over into the second plane of the Keywork, known as the dimension of enlightenment, or, the Samaritaine. Sirius is left defenseless against a swarm of malevolent entities that are approaching to occupy his body and mind. Once again, Evagria intervenes and carries Sirius with her to the dimension of enlightenment. Unable to remain in this dimension, Evagria shows him how to exit the Keywork. Once released, the All Mother unsuccessfully attempts to reestablish communication with the remains of the Meriwell. The Afterman's only other option is to use the suit to land on an orbiting space station. At this time the All Mother reveals that, although what seemed to Sirius to be a week inside the Keywork, it has actually been 547 days since he began his mission. Sirius successfully lands on the space station and is offered assistance in returning home. Post-Keywork events Upon returning to his home planet of Valencine, Sirius is conflicted with the idea of sharing what he has learned. He seeks the advice of his long-time mentor, Dr. Allen Linkev, who argues that the discovery of an afterlife, where the acceptance of one's soul is not determined by that person's actions in life, could cause mass chaos and a fundamental existential crisis. Sirius' indecision causes the intervention of the Prise, an angelic species tasked with the protection of Heaven's Fence. The Prise explain to Amory that the secrets of the Keywork were meant to be known by them, and \\"God\\", alone and that any disclosure of his findings would be considered an act of war. Heeding the Prise's directions, Amory lies to the public about his findings and substitutes a physics laden explanation of how the Keywork operates. Having pleased the public with his explanations, Sirius turns to the daunting task of mending his relationship with Meri, who has come to terms with The Afterman's assumed death and has engaged in a relationship with Colten, the police officer who prevented her from consuming a spiked beverage. Sirius is awarded The Amory Award, a recognition of scientific achievement created in his honor. After the ceremony, Sirius and Meri are driving home for the first time in over a year. Meri reveals that although she loves Sirius, she can no longer be with him. She confesses her relationship with Colten and the fact that she is 3 months pregnant with his offspring. Shocked by the news, Sirius loses control of the vehicle and wrecks, causing both of them to be ejected. At the hospital, Sirius' life is saved. Meri suffers a miscarriage and, despite the doctors' best efforts, dies. Meri then enters the Keywork as a spiritual entity. Devastated, Sirius contemplates suicide and blames himself for not providing Meri with the two things she desired most: his attention and a child. Returning from the hospital, Sirius encounters Colten, who interrogates The Afterman as to why he couldn't selfishly let Meri go and remain in the Keywork. An unknown amount of time passes. Sirius reconnects with the All Mother and acquires a new ship, Saudade, through funding from the scientific community. He programs the coordinates to reach the Keywork and is questioned by the All Mother regarding his overarching goals. His sole mission has become to re-enter the Keywork, find Meri, and help her transcend into the Samaritaine. ==Main characters== * Coheed Kilgannon - Husband of Cambria and harbors the Monstar virus, which, when triggered, causes the cooling of the star transformers that hold planets in the Keywork. Previously a member of K.B.I., Coheed being the B: Beast. He possesses blades in his left arm and can transform his right into a gun. He is killed by Cambria during a conflict when he becomes the Monstar. * Cambria Kilgannon - Wife of Coheed, and possesses some type of psychic or clairvoyant ability. Previously a member of K.B.I., Cambria being the K: Knowledge. She commits suicide after killing her husband to save Earth III. * Claudio Kilgannon - Son of Coheed & Cambria and the only known survivor of his family. After meeting his 'uncle' Jesse, the two plan to destroy Heaven's Fence and kill Wilhelm Ryan. Ambellina explains to Claudio that he is also The Crowing, a messiah who will save the souls of the Keywork by destroying it; however, he is not willing to accept this fate until the climax of Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV Vol.1: From Fear Through The Eyes Of Madness. * Jesse - Although commonly referred to as Coheed's brother, Jesse (like Coheed) is an IRO-bot. Jesse leads the rebels in war against Wilhelm Ryan. The third member of K.B.I., Inferno, Jesse is said to have created five new IRO-bots. Jesse is also a boxer and goes by the name of The Prize Fighter Inferno. * Mariah Antillarea - Originally believed to be the Messiah, Mariah is the leader of a rebellion against Wilhelm Ryan.

She represents the future the Writer could have had with his former girlfriend Erica Court. * Wilhelm Ryan - The Supreme Tri-Mage of the Keywork. He gained control of the Keywork during the Mage Wars when he claimed dominion over the other Mages. Ryan tried to use Coheed and Cambria to destroy Mariah because of her threat to his rule. When his plan failed she was killed by Mayo Deftinwolf. He now fights the rebel army, which is led by Jesse. * The Writer - Also referred to as The Writing Writer, the issues in his own life make him see delusions that cause him to take out his own suffering on the characters in his story. The story gets darker as his own problems grow. He doesn't want The Character (Claudio) to feel the same pain that he feels, so he interferes with the story. He sees the visions of Ten Speed who manipulates his thinking. * Ten Speed - The manifestation of The Writer's ill will and malice that takes the form of his 10 speed bicycle. Ten Speed convinces the Writer that he needs to kill off Ambellina in order to end the story. * Erica Court - The Writer's former lover, memories of whom cause him to descend into madness and interfere with the story of Heaven's Fence. It is hinted that The Writer once asked Erica Court to marry him (The Suffering), and that at some point in the relationship he turned hostile (Welcome Home). * Josephine Kilgannon - Oldest child of Coheed and Cambria and fianc√© of Patrick McCormick. An IRO-Bot created by Dr. Hohenberger to serve as the antidote to Coheed's Monstar virus, Josie possesses a telepathic link with Cambria. Josie is assaulted and raped by a gang called the Jersey City Devils and is later murdered by Coheed after he was deceived by Mayo. * Leonard Hohenberger - Scientist that created the K.B.I. and Josephine, he also created the Monstar virus to save his wife Pearl from the hands of Ryan by giving Ryan himself the weapon that would start the end of the worlds. * Sirius Amory - Cosmonaut that identified the source of The Keywork and the 7 suns that make up Heaven's Fence. On a mission to collect data on The Keywork, Sirius is stranded in the energy source and becomes a vessel for which souls relive their lives. ==Film adaptation== On December 2, 2012, Mark Wahlberg announced he will be producing a film adaptation of The Amory Wars. In 2019, conversation once again turned to adaptation of The Amory Wars when a petition created on the platform Change.org the prior year began to gain traction. Though no official reports from the creators have confirmed a project, support from fans and news reports sparked a campaign displaying interest in a series on Netflix. ==References *Coheed and Cambria official website *The Amory Wars official website *A BRIEF AMORY WARS CHAT WITH TONY MOORE, August 2, 2007, Newsarama *Claudio Sanchez graphic novel signing, August 8, 2008 Category:Coheed and Cambria Category:Concept album series Category:Multimedia works Category:Science fiction comics ","title":"The Amory Wars"},{"id":"6227706","text":"A light blue ribbon is the symbol for prostate cancer National Prostate Health Month (NPHM), also known as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, is observed every September in North America by health experts, health advocates, and individuals concerned with men‚Äôs prostate health and prostate cancer. Designating a month for the issue serves the purpose of: * Increasing public awareness of the importance of prostate health and prostate cancer awareness * Providing easily accessible prostate health screenings and prostate cancer screenings * Educating about risk factors and symptoms of prostate health and prostate cancer * Advocating for further research on prostate health issues and prostate cancer ==Origins== September was first designated National Prostate Health Month by the American Foundation for Urological Disease (AFUD) in 1999. AFUD is now known as the Urology Care Foundation. Originally the aims of observing NPHM were more proscribed, concentrating on making the public better informed about prostate health issues In 2001, Senate Resolution 138 sponsored by Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) endorsed the week and affirmed that Prostate Health Month would be observed annually. In a 2003 presidential proclamation, President George W. Bush voiced his support for the month, but instead of designating the month to be for prostate health in general, specifically named the month ‚ÄúNational Prostate Cancer Awareness Month.‚Äù September 2015 was designated National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month by the Obama Administration. ==Related observances== In 1989, decade before the creation of National Prostate Health Month, the week of September 17 to September 24 was chosen as Prostate Cancer Awareness Week. After the creation of NPHM, September came to incorporate observances of other related health weeks. Prostatitis Awareness Week is observed from September 10 to September 16 and Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH) Awareness Week is observed from September 24 to September 30. However, not all men‚Äôs health issues are commemorated in September. Testicular Cancer Awareness Week, for example, is celebrated during the week of April 1 to April 7. * 9/10 ‚Äì 9/16: Prostatitis Week * 9/17 ‚Äì 9/24: Prostate Cancer Week * 9/24 ‚Äì 9/30: Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH) Week * 4/1 ‚Äì 4/7: Testicular Cancer Awareness Week ==Events== Oncology funds, health systems, medical centers and NGOs, such as Men's Health Network, are just a few of the US organizations that sponsor events during National Prostate Health Month. Free screenings for prostate- related diseases are offered at hospitals, health centers, and the workplace. Physicians are sent information on how NPHW can be used as a way to remind their patients about prostate health. The Prostate Cancer Education Council uses the popularity of sports to spread awareness of prostate health effects and resources. For example, NFL teams dedicate home games to prostate cancer awareness, and golf tournaments and 5k races distribute informational material to audiences and participants in exchange for the incentive of prizes. Men's Health Network maintains the Prostate Health Month website at http://www.prostatehealthmonth.com and the Prostate Cancer Awareness Month website at http://prostatecancerawarenessmonth.com which lists links to organizations that are actively promoting events and prostate cancer education during that month. ==References== * ==Sources== * * ==External links== *Urology Care Foundation *Prostate Health Month *Prostate Cancer Awareness Month *Prostate Cancer Education Council *Men's Health Network *Prostate Health Guide Category:Prostate cancer Category:September observances Category:Cancer awareness Category:Month-long observances Category:Observances in the United States Category:Health observances Category:Public awareness campaigns Category:Awareness months Category:Health in the United States Category:Men's health ","title":"National Prostate Health Month"},{"id":"6227714","text":"Sakichi (written: ‰ΩêÂêâ) is a masculine Japanese given name.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on February 18, 1999. In this episode, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) struggles in his relationship with over-physical girlfriend Katie (Soleil Moon Frye). Chandler (Matthew Perry) becomes insecure about his relationship with Monica (Courteney Cox) when their friends joke about long-term relationships, and Ross (David Schwimmer) struggles to fit in with the tenants in his apartment, no thanks to the efforts of Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow). ==Plot== Having discovered about Monica and Chandler by seeing them going at it from the window of his new apartment, Ross confronts them. He is initially furious at Chandler, mistakenly thinking the latter is taking advantage of his sister, but when he realizes that the two are in love, his anger at them vanishes on the spot. Since he is the last of the group to discover the relationship, Chandler and Monica do not have to hide anything anymore, and they quickly become a much-discussed subject of talks in the group. Chandler starts to freak out about the relationship when his friends start to make long-term- relationship jokes, such as he and Monica having kids and having Ross as brother-in-law. His concerns are amplified when Rachel asks him to consider the fact that Monica does want to get married someday and that she broke up with Richard when she found out that he did not want any more children. When Chandler talks to Monica about all the jokes the friends have kept making, he reacts immaturely by trying to pass off their relationship as \\"casual\\". Monica gets angry with him and storms out, avoiding him when the two get within talking range. When he insists to talk to her, she tells him to start figuring out how to solve relationship problems himself. Now in a desperate situation, Chandler tries to make up with her by taking Ross and Joey's advice of making a big gesture. What he manages to do, however, is screw up again ‚Äì this time in a good but very unnatural sense ‚Äì by proposing to Monica in front of everyone just to say sorry. Monica calms Chandler down by telling him that he does not have to worry about marriage with her and he is clearly not ready to solve relationship problems by himself. The friends also get to meet Joey's new girlfriend, Katie, who is very nice and energetic ‚Äì so energetic, in fact, that she playfully punches Joey, who does not appreciate this because she is rather strong and keeps accidentally hurting his arm, but she thinks he is only joking when he tells her this. When he decides to break up with her, he wears six sweaters on top of each other to cushion the punches, but Rachel saves him the trouble of transforming into a punchbag when, after Katie playfully punches her a few times and accidentally hurts her also, she retaliates by angrily kicking Katie's ankle, hurting Katie, who is furious and demands that Joey stick up for her. He refuses, however, hoping that she will consequently break up with him ‚Äì which she does, without touching him, much to his delight. At his new apartment, Ross receives a visit from Phoebe with an assortment of house-warming gifts. At the same time, the president of the tenants committee, Steve, greets Ross and tells him of Howard, the retiring handyman and a party they are throwing for him. When Ross reasonably refuses to contribute $100 for the handyman he has never even met, Steve thinks that Ross is a cheapskate. He vilifies Ross as this to everyone in the apartment block, causing everyone in the building to hate Ross. Annoyed by this, he tries to organize a party for everyone to explain the reason behind the refusal, but is interrupted by the party everyone is having for Howard next door. He is even more surprised to find Phoebe there, especially when he finds out that she paid the $100 and that everyone likes her. Things get even worse for him when he cuts and eats Howard's cake. Just as he is about to be kicked out of the party, Phoebe jumps in to defend Ross, but ends up criticizing and insulting her new friends, who kick her and Ross out of the party. In the epilogue, the group makes jokes about how Chandler apologized by proposing, and Monica says they will be doing that for a long time based on how insane his actions were. However, Ross then ruins it by doing it on Rachel with the \\"We were on a break\\" thing, resulting in the group walking out on him. ==External links== * *\\"The One With The Girl Who Hits Joey\\" at TV.com Category:Friends (season 5) episodes Category:1999 American television episodes ","title":"The One with the Girl Who Hits Joey"},{"id":"6227728","text":"Birrwil is a municipality in the district of Kulm in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland. Aerial view (1964) ==History== Isolated finds of artifacts indicate settlement during the Neolithic, Roman and Alamanni eras. The beginnings of the modern town go back to an Alamanni named Bero (meaning Bear), who founded the village Beriwilare (meaning Bero's village) in the area.Birrwil website accessed 15 April 2010 Birrwil is first mentioned in 1185 as Beriuuillare. Between 1185 and 1331 there was a noble von Birrwil family. No traces remain of their family castle. The village was part of the lands of the Counts of Lenzburg, the Kyburgs and the finally the Habsburgs. The power of Zwing und Bann (Manor rights as well as low justice) over the village, was held by the Lords of Hohenklingen through the von Birrwil family. In 1326 those rights were acquired by the Lords of Liebegg who held them until the 1798. Following the Bernese conquest of the Aargau in 1415 became part of Bern until the end of the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1798. The village became part of the Canton of Aargau following the 1803 Act of Mediation. The former manor houses were only fully incorporated in the 19th and 20th century into Birrwil (Schwaderhof 1822, Wilhof 1905). The village church was first mentioned in 1275. In 1528, during the Protestant Reformation, the church converted to the new religion. In 1689 the old church was replaced by a new one. Economically, both in the 18th and 19th century the cotton industry was a major source of income. In 1857 the tobacco industry also entered the village.

It is situated 5 miles (8 km) west of Yeovil, with which it is linked by the A3088 road. The parish is located near the River Parrett, and includes the village of East Stoke. ==History== The village stretches around Ham Hill which is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Iron Age hill fort, Roman site, and country park. The hill has given its name to the distinctive quarried hamstone which is quarried from a ridge of sandy limestone rock that is elevated above the lower lying clay vales and nearby Somerset Levels. It is of particular importance to geologists because of the assemblages of fossils which it contains, the sedimentary features which it displays and the way it relates to other rocks of equivalent age in the close vicinity. The Bronze Age and Iron Age hill fort was occupied by the Durotriges tribe. A Roman milestone was found at Venn Bridge in 1930: apparently it was made as an element in a colonnade and afterwards converted to a milestone inscribed with the name of the emperor Flavius Severus who ruled in 305-306 AD. In the 10th century the estate passed to Glastonbury Abbey, but after the Norman Conquest was held by Robert, Count of Mortain and granted to Robert FitzIvo. It then passed down through the Beauchamps of Hatch, becoming known as Stoke Beauchamp. It was acquired by the Duchy of Cornwall in 1443 and is still held by the Duchy. The parish of Stoke was part of Tintinhull Hundred. The village is the site of the 14th century Stoke sub Hamdon Priory which is a former priest's house of the chantry chapel of St Nicholas, which was destroyed after the dissolution of the monasteries. The priory has been owned by the National Trust since 1946, and designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. ==Governance== The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village is in 'Hamdon' electoral ward. The ward stretches south to Norton sub Hamdon The total ward population taken at the 2011 Census was 2,711. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. ==Religious sites== The church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, dates from the 12th century, and has a tower and six bells. It shows various medieval carving including abstract corbels, an astrological tympanum, and St Michael slaying the dragon. Two of the carvings are thought to be Sheela na Gigs. The village's now-redundant United Reformed Church was opened in 1866 and closed in 2017.https://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/som/vol3/pp235-249http://www.stoke-sub-hamdon.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2014/07/Stoke-sub-Hamdon-Newsletter-January-2017.pdf It is a Grade II* listed building. ==Education== Secondary education for pupils between 11 and 16 is provided at Stanchester Academy, and Norton Sub Hamdon primary school for reception to year 6, and Castle Primary School in Stoke sub Hamdon itself, for reception to year 6. ==References *Village information *Stoke Sub Hamdon at GENUKI Category:Villages in South Somerset Category:Civil parishes in Somerset ","title":"Stoke-sub-Hamdon"},{"id":"6227750","text":"Nate Kelley (born February 15, 1978 in Rockford, Illinois) is the original drummer and backing vocalist for the progressive rock band Shabutie (now called Coheed and Cambria).

They can be implemented via BIOS- level firmware, or alternatively, via a device plugged inline between a computer keyboard and a computer. They log all keyboard activity to their internal memory. ==Description== Hardware keyloggers have an advantage over software keyloggers as they can begin logging from the moment a computer is turned on (and are therefore able to intercept passwords for the BIOS or disk encryption software). All hardware keylogger devices have to have the following: * A microcontroller - this interprets the datastream between the keyboard and computer, processes it, and passes it to the non-volatile memory * A non-volatile memory device, such as flash memory - this stores the recorded data, retaining it even when power is lost Generally, recorded data is retrieved by typing a special password into a computer text editor. The hardware keylogger plugged in between the keyboard and computer detects that the password has been typed and then presents the computer with \\"typed\\" data to produce a menu. Beyond text menu some keyloggers offer a high-speed download to speed up retrieval of stored data; this can be via USB mass- storage enumeration or with a USB or serial download adapter. Typically the memory capacity of a hardware keylogger may range from a few kilobytes to several gigabytes, with each keystroke recorded typically consuming a byte of memory. == Types of hardware keyloggers == A connected hardware-based keylogger. # A Regular Hardware Keylogger is used for keystroke logging by means of a hardware circuit that is attached somewhere in between the computer keyboard and the computer. It logs all keyboard activity to its internal memory which can be accessed by typing in a series of pre-defined characters. A hardware keylogger has an advantage over a software solution; because it is not dependent on the computer's operating system it will not interfere with any program running on the target machine and hence cannot be detected by any software. They are typically designed to have an innocuous appearance that blends in with the rest of the cabling or hardware, such as appearing to be an EMC Balun. They can also be installed inside a keyboard itself (as a circuit attachment or modification), or the keyboard could be manufactured with this \\"feature\\". They are designed to work with legacy PS/2 keyboards, or more recently, with USB keyboards. Some variants, known as wireless hardware keyloggers, have the ability to be controlled and monitored remotely by means of a wireless communication standard. #Wireless Keylogger sniffers - Collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver and then attempt to crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices. #Firmware - A computer's BIOS, which is typically responsible for handling keyboard events, can be reprogrammed so that it records keystrokes as it processes them. #Keyboard overlays - a fake keypad is placed over the real one so that any keys pressed are registered by both the eavesdropping device as well as the legitimate one that the customer is using. #Key commands - exist in much legitimate software. These programs require keyloggers to know when you‚Äôre using a specific command. ==Countermeasures== Denial or monitoring of physical access to sensitive computers, e.g. by closed-circuit video surveillance and access control, is the most effective means of preventing hardware keylogger installation. Visual inspection is the easiest way of detecting hardware keyloggers. But there are also some techniques that can be used for most hardware keyloggers on the market, to detect them via software. In cases in which the computer case is hidden from view (e.g. at some public access kiosks where the case is in a locked box and only a monitor, keyboard, and mouse are exposed to view) and the user has no possibility to run software checks, a user might thwart a keylogger by typing part of a password, using the mouse to move to a text editor or other window, typing some garbage text, mousing back to the password window, typing the next part of the password, etc. so that the keylogger will record an unintelligible mix of garbage and password textHardware Keylogger Detection , SpyCop. See also Keystroke logging countermeasures. The main risk associated with keylogger use is that physical access is needed twice: initially to install the keylogger, and secondly to retrieve it. Thus, if the victim discovers the keylogger, they can then set up a sting operation to catch the person in the act of retrieving it. This could include camera surveillance or the review of access card swipe records to determine who gained physical access to the area during the time period that the keylogger was removed. ==References * Open Source PS/2 Hardware Keylogger * Presentation about detection of hardware keyloggers Category:Cryptographic attacks Category:Surveillance ","title":"Hardware keylogger"},{"id":"6227780","text":"Durham-Sud, also known as South Durham, is a small farming community in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, west of Richmond and south of Drummondville.

He is the older brother of fellow Supercars driver and former Bathurst 1000 winner, Rick Kelly. He drove for the Holden Racing Team from 2003 until 2007, and Perkins Engineering in 2008. Since 2009, he has been with his family team Kelly Racing (now known as Nissan Motorsport Australia). He is the youngest driver to have reached 100 starts in the series. ==Supercars Championship== Season 2001 was Kelly's first full-time season in V8 Supercars (although he had previously raced in the category in 99' and 00'), he drove for the K-Mart Racing Team alongside Greg Murphy. He and Greg finished 3rd at Bathurst. He finished his first full season in 6th and broke through for his first-round victory in the last round of the season at Sandown Raceway. Season 2002 saw him take four second places, and fifth in the championship. After two successful years with K-Mart Racing Team, the departure of Jason Bright left a vacancy at the Holden Racing Team in 2003. Kelly and new team-mate Mark Skaife won the Sandown 500 in very wet conditions and in controversial circumstances with a late race tussle with the Team Dynamic Commodore of Jason Richards and Simon Wills. Kelly finished ninth in the championship, behind his brother Rick in eighth. Kelly was part of the two-car Holden Monaro assault by Garry Rogers Motorsport on the 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour race. With co-drivers Jason Bright, Greg Murphy and Peter Brock, Kelly won the race with Murphy crossing the line only 0.3505 seconds ahead of the teams lead car (and the 2002 race winner) driven by Garth Tander and co-driven by Steven Richards, Cameron McConville and Nathan Pretty. Season 2004 saw him finish behind his brother in the Championship, but this time two places up in seventh. Season 2005 was Kelly's most successful year in V8 Supercars, claiming five podiums. Three of them were wins, including the Bathurst 1000 with Mark Skaife which was Todd's 26th birthday and also the V8 Supercars China Round, the series' only ever event to be held in China. He finished 4th in the standings, ahead of teammate Skaife in fifth. Kelly's 2006 season was fairly average throughout the first six rounds, albeit largely through mechanical failures, however after strong driving performances at the next three rounds including second in both the Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000 when he paired up with younger brother Rick Kelly. Kelly's seat was taken by HSV Dealer Team driver Garth Tander. He was just starting to show some of the form that had him finish fourth in the championship in 2005. He finished the year off strongly, with a second and first place in the last two rounds which left him in sixth place at the end of the year. Todd Kelly (left) and Garth Tander at a press conference in 2007 Season 2007 was another average year for Kelly, he won the Clipsal 500 but was not able to continue that edge. He came second at Phillip Island and at the Grand Finale, finishing seventh in the championship. In doing so, helped secure Garth Tander the driver's championship. At the conclusion of the season, Kelly announced he would drive for Jack Daniel's Racing from 2008 onwards after a five-year association with HRT.Jack Daniel's Racing Signs Todd Kelly This move is believed to have also been supported by 2007 champion Garth Tander confirming he will be moving from HSVDT to HRT. Kelly's 2008 proved to be inconsistent. After starting the year well at Clipsal, where he finished fifth for the round, the middle part of the season saw a lack of the results expected from Kelly. After a major suspension geometry issue was resolved during the course of the Bathurst weekend, the car showed a sudden turn of speed. He finished 4th at Surfers Paradise, then scored a stunning race win in the wet at Symmons Plains, the first victory of any kind (race or round) for a Perkins Engineering entry since 2006. Kelly finished the season in 12th position. ==Career results== Nissan Altima L33 of Todd Kelly at the 2015 Clipsal 500 Adelaide Kelly at his final Supercars event, the 2017 Coates Hire Newcastle 500 {  style=\\"font- size: 95%;\\" - !

The group works against the social stigma that is associated with prostitution, and the poverty that is sometimes its cause. It provides information, help, and support to individual prostitute women and others who are concerned with sex workers' rights, civil, legal, and economic rights. The organisation was founded in 1975, and its first spokeswoman was Selma James. ==Origins== The ECP was formed as part of the highly politicised prostitutes' rights movement that emerged in Europe in the mid-1970s. The 1975 prostitutes' strike in France and the subsequent formation of the French Prostitute Collective inspired the formation of a similar organisation in England. ==International== The ECP and the US PROStitutes Collective (US PROS) are part of the International Prostitutes Collective, which has a network of sex workers in many countries of the world. The ECP is said to work closely with the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective who spearheaded legislation in New Zealand to decriminalise prostitution. A recent government review found that after five years, there had been no increase in the numbers of women working. ==Safety First Coalition== In the aftermath of the Ipswich serial murders of five young women in December 2006, the ECP initiated the Safety First Coalition to decriminalise sex work, and prioritise safety. Members include the Royal College of Nursing, the National Association of Probation Officers, bereaved families, some anti-poverty campaigners, church people, residents of red-light areas, medical and legal professionals, prison reformers, sex workers, anti- rape organisations, drug rehabilitation projects. ==Policing and Crime Act== The English Collective of Prostitutes campaigned against the Policing and Crime Act 2009, which originally included proposals to criminalise anyone involved in the sex industry, whether or not there was force or coercion; target safer premises; seize and retain money and assets, even without a conviction; increase arrests against street workers; arrest men on \\"suspicion\\"; imprison sex workers who breach a compulsory rehabilitation order. The ECP argued that these measures would force prostitution underground, exposing sex workers to greater danger and preventing them coming forward to report violence and access health and other services. ==Trafficking== The ECP argues that discredited academic work has falsely labelled most sex workers as victims of \\"trafficking\\". Its website provides critiques of such work.More or Less BBC Radio 4 1:30 pm Friday 9 January 2009. ==Decriminalisation== In 2015, the ECP organised a symposium in the House of Commons, presenting evidence to parliament in support of the decriminalisation of sex work. ==Universal Credit== In 2019 Laura Watson from the ECP gave evidence to the Work and Pensions Select Committee which was examining the link between sex work and poverty caused by the introduction of Universal Credit. She said that payment delays had led to \\"increased destitution and homelessness\\" and pushed some women into \\"survival sex\\". ==Local issues== The ECP has been involved in local campaigns aimed at making life safer for prostitutes following incidents in certain areas, for example, the Ipswich murders of 2006 in which all the victims were prostitutes. It also objects to the actions of Reading Borough Council and the Thames Valley Police, which have been targeting prostitutes working in the Oxford Road area of Reading, Berkshire, for several years. ==See also== * COYOTE * Prostitution in the United Kingdom * Sex-positive movement ==References * International Prostitutes Collective ;News * Keith Dovkants, \\"Soho brothel to re-open after judge throws out police case\\", London Evening Standard, 18 February 2009. * Ben Russell, \\"Sex & the citizens: New prostitution laws explained\\", The Independent, 20 November 2008. * \\"Jam, Jerusalem and Prostitutes\\", Sky News On-line * \\"Should Sex Laws Be Tougher\\", BBC Two, 19 November 2008. * \\"Critics hit out at sex law plan\\", BBC News, 19 November 2008.

The manor and village were in dispute about ownership through the first half of the 13th century. These disputes culminated in a Papal Court which decided that the two warring parties would submit a champion each in a duel. The abbot of Mont St Michel feared for his life, and that of his champion, and so renounced all claims on the village. The winner was Sir Robert Marmion, whose family were already resident at West Tanfield and who built their castle (Marmion Tower).

In 1627, Luigi Guglielmo Moncada, Prince of Patern√≤, founded a new centre named after his wife, Maria Alfan di Ribera; the new centre developed rapidly, thanks to the fertility of the soil and the accessibility of the area. It is the birthplace of Prime Minister Francesco Crispi. ==Main sights== The Chiesa Madre, founded in the 18th century, facing the Piazza Duomo (\\"Cathedral Square\\"). The Town Hall (19th century) is in the same square. In Via Crispi is the house where Francesco Crispi, leader of the Italian government between 1887 and 1896, was born. The Garibaldi Garden offers a botanical itinerary. Just outside the town, on a gorge overlooking the Verdura river is the Castello di Poggio Diana, built by Guglielmo Peralta in the 14th century. A Bronze Age necropolis (13th century BC) was discovered near the town. It includes some 30 tombs in two types, \\"chamber\\"- or \\"grotto\\"-like; some are preceded by a corridor up to long. Also outside the town is the Borgo Bonsignore, a village founded under Fascism as part of the \\"colonization\\" policy that encouraged the creation of new villages; it has now grown as a summer resort. ==Economy== Agriculture is the commune's main industry, notably involved in the cultivation and marketing of the Washington navel orange ‚Äì here introduced by emigrants returned from the United States ‚Äì and strawberries. Such businesses are enhanced both by excellent climatic and environmental conditions and a supporting policy by the local authorities. ==Twin towns== * Oinousses, Greece * Elizabeth, USA ==See also== *Caltabellotta ==External links== * Official website *Ribera - Photos, history, traditions, news *Arancia di Ribera D.O.P.

The name of the village derives from Old English and means the town of the huntsmen, or where the hunts hounds were kept. The small village's local amenities include a combined post office/village shop and The Countryman's Inn, a pub and restaurant. The village also has a primary school, the Hunton and Arrathorne Community Primary School, which has an Ofsted rating of good. In 1985, the landlord of the pub started a small traction steam engine gala in the village. It has since become a yearly event and has outgrown the original showground in the village. The Hunton Steam Gathering is now a popular annual event. There used to be a church in the village (St John's) which was rebuilt in 1794, but this is now a private dwelling.

The only member of the genus is Sardinops sagax. It is found in the Indo-Pacific and East Pacific oceans. Its length is up to . It has numerous common or vernacular names, some of which more appropriately refer to subspecies, including blue pilchard, Australian pilchard (S. s. neopilchardus), blue-bait, Californian pilchard (S. s. caeruleus), Peruvian Pacific sardine(S. s. sagax), South American pilchard, Chilean sardine (S. s. sagax), Japanese pilchard (S. s. melanostictus), Pacific sardine, and Southern African pilchard (S. s. ocellatus). == South Australian sardine fishery == South Australian sardine fishery - Total catch (1990-2012) The South Australian sardine fishery targets Sardinops sagax and is the highest yielding single species fishery in Australia by volume. The fishery employs the technique of purse seining. Schools of sardines are encircled by a net up to 1 kilometre in length which is then drawn closed at the bottom. The catch is then pumped on board the fishing vessel where it is stored in refrigerated holds at below freezing temperatures. 94% of the catch is used as feed in Southern bluefin tuna ranching operations off Port Lincoln, South Australia. The remaining 6% of the catch serves human consumption, recreational fishing bait and premium pet food markets. The industry commenced in South Australia in 1991 with an annual catch quota of . In 2003, the fishery's annual quota was set at . By 2014, the annual quota had increased to . The fishery's total landed catch peaked at in the financial year 2004-05 stabilising at around per year thereafter. A key area of concern for industry compliance in 2004 was quota evasion. Quota evasion had previously occurred in several forms: unloading catch directly to tuna farms, failing to report prior to unloading catch and dumping excess catch at sea. ==Gallery== School of sardines at the Monterey Bay Aquarium (12056).jpgalt=Visitors watch a school of thousands of Pacific sardines form a tornado in an exhibit at Monterey Bay AquariumA school of S. sagax in the Open Sea exhibit at Monterey Bay Aquarium Sardines.ogvPacific sardines in the Sunshine Aquarium Catch of Pacific sardines.jpgCatch of Pacific sardines Sardine photo4 exp.jpgPacific sardines are blue-green on the back and have white flanks with 1 to 3 lengthwise rows of dark spots. ==See also== * Sardine run * Southern bluefin tuna == References == * * ==External links== * Category:Clupeidae Category:Commercial fish Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean Category:Fish of South America Category:Fish of the Western United States Category:Western North American coastal fauna Category:Western South American coastal fauna Category:Fish of Australia Category:Fish of Chile Category:Fish of New Zealand Category:Fish of Peru Category:Monotypic fish genera Category:Fish of Korea Category:Fish of Japan ","title":"Sardinops"},{"id":"6227883","text":"Cell physiology is the biological study of the activities that take place in a cell to keep it alive. The term physiology refers to normal functions in a living organism. Animal cells, plant cells and microorganism cells show similarities in their functions even though they vary in structure. ==General characteristics== There are two types of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotes were the first of the two to develop and do not have a self- contained nucleus. Their mechanisms are simpler than later-evolved eukaryotes, which contain a nucleus that envelops the cell's DNA and some organelles. === Prokaryotes === Typical prokaryotic cell structure Prokaryotes have DNA located in an area called the nucleoid, which is not separated from other parts of the cell by a membrane. There are two domains of prokaryotes: bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotes have fewer organelles than eukaryotes. Both have plasma membranes and ribosomes (structures that synthesize proteins and float free in cytoplasm). Two unique characteristics of prokaryotes are fimbriae (finger-like projections on the surface of a cell) and flagella (threadlike structures that aid movement). === Eukaryotes === Typical eukaryotic animal cell structure Eukaryotes have a nucleus where DNA is contained. They are usually larger than prokaryotes and contain many more organelles. The nucleus, the feature of a eukaryote that distinguishes it from a prokaryote, contains a nuclear envelope, nucleolus and chromatin. In cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) synthesizes membranes and performs other metabolic activities. There are two types, rough ER (containing ribosomes) and smooth ER (lacking ribosomes). The Golgi apparatus consists of multiple membranous sacs, responsible for manufacturing and shipping out materials such as proteins. Lysosomes are structures that use enzymes to break down substances through phagocytosis, a process that comprises endocytosis and exocytosis. In the mitochondria, metabolic processes such as cellular respiration occur. The cytoskeleton is made of fibers that support the structure of the cell and help the cell move. ==Physiological processes== There are different ways through which cells can transport substances across the cell membrane. The two main pathways are passive transport and active transport. Passive transport is more direct and does not require the use of the cell's energy. It relies on an area that maintains a high-to-low concentration gradient. Active transport uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport a substance that moves against its concentration gradient. === Movement of proteins === The pathway for proteins to move in cells starts at the ER. Lipids and proteins are synthesized in the ER, and carbohydrates are added to make glycoproteins. Glycoproteins undergo further synthesis in the Golgi apparatus, becoming glycolipids. Both glycoproteins and glycolipids are transported into vesicles to the plasma membrane. The cell releases secretory proteins known as exocytosis. === Transport of ions === Ion Transport: Direction of Na/K flow Ions travel across cell membranes through channels, pumps or transporters. In channels, they move down an electrochemical gradient to produce electrical signals. Pumps maintain electrochemical gradients. The main type of pump is the Na/K pump. It moves 3 sodium ions out of a cell and 2 potassium ions into a cell. The process converts one ATP molecule to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and In a transporter, ions use more than one gradient to produce electrical signals. Endocytosis in Animal Cells === Endocytosis in animal cells === Endocytosis is a form of active transport where a cell takes in molecules, using the plasma membrane, and packages them into vesicles. === Phagocytosis === In phagocytosis, a cell surrounds particles including food particles through an extension of the pseudopods, which are located on the plasma membrane. The pseudopods then package the particles in a food vacuole. The lysosome, which contains hydrolytic enzymes, then fuses with the food vacuole. Hydrolytic enzymes, also known as digestive enzymes, then digest the particles within the food vacuole. === Pinocytosis === In pinocytosis, a cell takes in (\\"gulps\\") extracellular fluid into vesicles, which are formed when plasma membrane surrounds the fluid. The cell can take in any molecule or solute through this process. === Receptor-mediated endocytosis === Receptor- mediated endocytosis is a form of pinocytosis where a cell takes in specific molecules or solutes. Proteins with receptor sites are located on the plasma membrane, binding to specific solutes. The receptor proteins that are attached to the specific solutes go inside coated pits, forming a vesicle. The vesicles then surround the receptors that are attached to the specific solutes, releasing their molecules. Receptor proteins are recycled back to the plasma membrane by the same vesicle. ==References * Overview at Medical College of Georgia (archived) * * Category:Cell biology Category:Physiology ","title":"Cell physiology"},{"id":"6227894","text":"Denver Thunder were an indoor soccer club based in Denver, Colorado that competed in the National Professional Soccer League.

Today, it houses the mus√©e d'Arch√©ologie nationale (National Museum of Archaeology). == History  12th‚Äì13th centuries === Sainte-Chapelle The first castle, named the Grand Ch√¢telet, was built on the site by Louis VI in 1124. The castle was expanded by Louis IX in the 1230s. Louis IX's chapelle Saint Louis at the castle belongs to the Rayonnant phase of French Gothic architecture. A 1238 charter of Louis IX instituting a regular religious service at the chapel is the first mention of a chapel having been built at the royal castle. This was a Sainte Chapelle, to house a relic of the Crown of Thorns or the True Cross. Its plan and architecture prefigure the major Sainte-Chapelle which Saint Louis built within the Palais de la Cit√© at Paris between 1240 and 1248. Both buildings were built by Louis's favourite architect Pierre de Montreuil, who adapted the architectural formulae invented at Saint Germain for use in Paris. A single nave ends in a chevet, with almost all the wall areas filled by tall narrow glass windows, between which are large exterior buttresses. The ogives of the vault rest on columns between the bays and the column bases are placed behind a low isolated arcade. The building can thus be open and empty of all internal supports. This large number of windows is also enabled by the pierre arm√©e technique, with metal elements built into the structure of the walls to ensure the stones' stability. The west wall is adorned by a large Gothic rose window in the Rayonnant Gothic style. It was in this chapel in 1238 that Baldwin II of Constantinople presented Louis with the relic of the crown of thorns and, though they were intended for the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, they were housed here until the Paris chapel was consecrated in April 1248. The castle was burned by the Black Prince in 1346; of it, only the Gothic chapel remains from the site's medieval phase. This Ch√¢teau Vieux was rebuilt by Charles V in the 1360s on the old foundations. === 16th‚Äì18th centuries === Ch√¢teau-Neuf de St-Germain-en-Laye, a new addition to the palace that was later demolished The oldest parts of the current ch√¢teau were reconstructed by Francis I in 1539, and have subsequently been expanded several times. On 10 July 1547 a political rivalry came to a head in a bloody game here. Against the odds, Guy Chabot, 7th baron de Jarnac triumphed over Fran√ßois de Vivonne, seigneur de la Chasteigneraie, giving rise to the coup de Jarnac. Staircase tower in the corner of the court Henry II built a separate new ch√¢teau nearby, to designs by Philibert de l'Orme. It stood at the crest of a slope, which was shaped, under the direction of √âtienne du P√©racKarling 1974, p 10 into three massive descending terraces and narrower subsidiary mediating terraces, which were linked by divided symmetrical stairs and ramps and extended a single axis that finished at the edge of the Seine; the design took many cues from the Villa Lante at .F. Hamilton Hazlehurst, Jacques Boyceau, pp. 20, 77‚Äì79, 100, noted by Karling. \\"√âtienne du P√©rac had spent a long time in Italy, and one manifestation of his interest in gardens of this type is his well-known view of the Villa d'Este, engraved in 1573.\\"Karling 1974, p. 11 The gardens laid out at Saint-Germain-en-Laye were among a half-dozen gardens introducing the Italian garden style to France that laid the groundwork for the French formal garden. Unlike the parterres that were laid out in casual relation to existing ch√¢teaux, often on difficult sites originally selected for defensive reasons, Even the parterres at Fontainebleau bear no direct relation to the fa√ßades of the ch√¢teau. these new gardens extended the central axis of a symmetrical building fa√ßade in rigorously symmetrical axial designs of patterned parterres, gravel walks, fountains and basins, and formally planted bosquets; they began the tradition that reached its apex after 1650 in the gardens of Andr√© Le N√¥tre.Sten Karling, in \\"The importance of Andr√© Mollet and his family for the development of the French formal garden,\\" in The French Formal Garden, Elizabeth MacDougall and F. Hamilton Hazlehurst, editors, (Dumbarton Oaks, 1974), in making this point, notes Ancy-le-Franc, Anet, Maune, Charleval, Verneuil and Saint-Germain-en-Laye. According to Claude Mollet's Th√©√¢tre des plans et jardinageThe book was not published until 1652, but it had long been in preparation (Karling 1974). the parterres were laid out in 1595 for Henry IV by Mollet, trained at Anet and the progenitor of a dynasty of royal gardeners. One of the parterre designs by Mollet at Saint-Germain-en-Laye was illustrated in Olivier de Serres' (1600), but the Ch√¢teau Neuf and the whole of its spectacular series of terraces can be fully seen in an engraving after Alexandre Francini, 1614.Francini's engraving is illustrated by Karling, fig. 8. Silvestre's view of the uppermost terrace of the Ch√¢teau Neuf, shows (with artistic license) its neglected state. Louis XIV was born at Saint-Germain-en- Laye in 1638. One of du P√©rac's retaining walls collapsed in 1660, and Louis undertook a renovation of the gardens in 1662. At his majority he established his court here in 1666, but he preferred the Ch√¢teau Vieux: the Ch√¢teau Neuf was abandoned in the 1660s and demolished. From 1663 until 1682, when the king removed definitively to Versailles, the team that he inherited from the unfortunate Fouquet‚ÄîLouis Le Vau, Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Andr√© Le N√¥tre laboured to give the ancient pile a more suitable aspect. The gardens were remade by Andr√© Le N√¥tre from 1669 to 1673, and include a 2.4 kilometre long stone terrace which provides a view over the valley of the Seine and, in the distance, Paris. The Ch√¢teau is at the centre of the town of Saint-Germain-en- Laye, close by its RER A railway station. Louis XIV turned the ch√¢teau over to King James II of England after his exile from Britain in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. King James lived in the ch√¢teau for thirteen years, and his daughter Louise-Marie Stuart was born in exile here in 1692. King James lies buried in the nearby Church of Saint-Germain; his wife Mary of Modena remained at the ch√¢teau until her death in 1718. Their son James left the ch√¢teau in 1716, ultimately settling in Rome. Many Jacobites‚Äîsupporters of the exiled Stuarts‚Äîremained at the ch√¢teau until the French Revolution, leaving in 1793. The Jacobites often consisted of former members of the Jacobite court, and the apartments left empty in the chateau by the Jacobite court pensioners upon their death, were often passed down to their widows and children by the caretaker of the chateau, Adrien Maurice, the Duke de Noailles.Edward T. Corp: A Court in Exile: The Stuarts in France, 1689‚Äì1718 (2004) The Jacobite colony at Saint-Germain was still dominant in the 1750s, when they were however treated with increasing hostility. After the death of the Duke de Noailles in 1766, who had been responsible for the continuing Jacobite dominance because of his preference to give rooms to Jacobites, the British dominance quickly decreased and more French inhabitants were given lodgings in the chateau: the last member of the Stuart court was Theresa O'Connel, who died in 1778.Edward T. Corp: A Court in Exile: The Stuarts in France, 1689‚Äì1718 (2004) The last descendants of the British Jacobites, by then mostly bearing French names, were evicted when the building was confiscated by the government during the French revolution in 1793.Edward T. Corp: A Court in Exile: The Stuarts in France, 1689‚Äì1718 (2004) === 19th‚Äì21st centuries === In the 19th century, Napoleon I established his cavalry officers' training school here. Napoleon III initiated restoration of the castle by Eug√®ne Millet, starting in 1862. It became the Mus√©e des Antiquit√©s Nationales (National Museum of Antiquities) in 1867, displaying the archeological objects of France. Auguste Lafollye took over responsibility for the restoration on Millet's death in 1879, continuing until 1889. His goal, and that of his successor Honor√© Daumet, was to restore the French Renaissance style of Francis I. On September 10, 1919 the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, ending hostilities between the Allies of World War I and Austria, was signed at the ch√¢teau.\\"Austrian treaty signed in amity,\\" The New York Times, Sept. 11, 1919, p. 12.

It was first serialized in the newspaper Di√°rio do Rio de Janeiro, but due to its enormous success Alencar decided to compile his writing in a volume. A plausible explanation for this success might be in the fact that the novel spoke of freedom and independence, arguing for a nativeness that could be found in tropical Nature and in the indigenous people of Brazil. Years later the novel was turned into an opera performed in Italian and called Il Guarany (1870), by Carlos Gomes, among other places it was presented in Milan and New York (it is a known fact that the author did not appreciate the final result). The Guarani is regarded a foundational text of Brazilian Romanticism, but it gained international projection by being translated into Spanish, German (Der Guarany, Brasilianischer Roman, Maximillian Emerich, 1876) and English (The Guarany, Brazilian novel, James W. Hawes, 1893). The novel is still widely read nowadays, especially at Brazilian schools as an introduction to novel reading, but also by anyone who enjoys a thrilling adventure story. Literary criticism has tended to link The Guarani to the works of Fenimore Cooper, Chateaubriand and the noble savage from the Rousseauian tradition. However, this interpretation of the novel has become outdated as recent academic works show also how dark, sexual, gothic and lyrical (over narrative, unlike the Fenimore Cooper model) the novel is. Serravalle de S√°, Daniel, Tropical Gothic. Rome: Aracne, 2010. ==Plot introduction== The Guarani is set back in 1604, a period when Portugal and its colonies submitted to Spanish dominion due to a lack of heirs to ascend to the throne. Alencar takes advantage of this dynastic complication to resurrect the historical figure of Dom Ant√¥nio de Mariz, one of the founders of the city of Rio de Janeiro and a pioneer settler. This historical (factual) background, which orients the novel throughout, is set in the first two chapters; then fantasy, both violent and erotic, starts to prevail. D. Ant√¥nio establishes himself in a deserted inland region, a few days‚Äô travel from the seaside city of Rio. The land was granted to him through his services to the Portuguese crown, whose legitimacy the nobleman now distrusts. To be politically independent (if not economically) and keep to the Portuguese codes of honour, he builds a castle-like house to shelter his family in Brazilian soil where he lives like a feudal lord with his family and retainers. His family consists of his severe wife D. Lauriana, his angelic fair, blue-eyed daughter Cec√≠lia, his dandyish son D. Diogo and the \\"niece\\" Isabel, a cabocla who is in fact his illegitimate daughter by an Indian woman. Other people are also attached to his household, a few loyal servants, forty adventurers/mercenaries kept for protection, the young nobleman √Ålvaro de S√°, an appropriate suitor for his lawful daughter Cec√≠lia, and Peri, an Indian of the Guaran√≠ people, who once saved Cecy‚Äôs life (as the romantic/romanticised Indian endearingly calls Cec√≠lia) and who has since deserted his tribe and family. Peri is the hero who gives title to the book, he is treated as a friend by D. Ant√¥nio and Ceci and as a nuisance by Mrs. Mariz and Isabel. The life of the characters is altered by the arrival of the adventurer Loredano (former friar Angelo di Lucca) who insinuates himself into the house and soon starts subverting the other vassals, planning to kidnap Cec√≠lia and scheming against the house of Mariz; along with the accidental murder of an Aimor√© Indian woman by D. Diogo. == Comic adaptations == The Guarani is the Brazilian novel with the largest number of adaptations for comics.Cirne, Moacy (January 24, 2011) Quadrinhos - Nos bra√ßos de Peri .

The hamlet is north of the town of Hawes across the River Ure. Sedbusk is in the civil parish of High Abbotside along with Hardraw and Simonstone. The name of the hamlet derives from the Old Norse Saetr buskr, which means \\"the bush by the shieling\\". In 1280, it was recorded as setebuskste. Sedbusk is situated just off the \\"high road\\" in Wensleydale (the road on the opposite side of the valley to the A684). The road that goes through the hamlet is part of an old drovers road that is said to have been the route that Mary Queen of Scots travelled along on her way to Castle Bolton. The hamlet sits in the shadow of Stags Fell (to the north) which was formerly a centre of quarrying for stone and at one point even had a small colliery, though it is believed to have been only sourcing coal for lime burning. Stone produced at Stag Fell was Yoredale Sandstone and whilst production ceased in the 1930s, the tunnels cut into the hillside are still there and are dangerous to enter. ==References Category:Villages in North Yorkshire Category:Wensleydale ","title":"Sedbusk"},{"id":"6227943","text":"The Winter Gardens in Cleethorpes, England, was an entertainment venue on the town's sea front. It accommodated over 500 people and held conference, dance, dinner and live band events. ==History== Design commenced for the venue as an amusement hall in the 1920s. It started out as the art deco style Olympia in 1934, and it was built with compensation which local railway worker George Eyre received from an accident which resulted in his legs being amputated. George's wife, Rose, owned the land on which Olympia was erected. After the post-war refurbishment in December 1947, the establishment was reopened as the Winter Gardens. The Winter Gardens held a range of events including rock gigs, a Melody Night and a Tea Dance. On 15 August 2013, plans were unveiled for a ¬£3.5-million housing development on the former Winter Gardens site in Cleethorpes.http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/Mixed-response-Winter-Gardens- development-plan/story-19668158-detail/story.html ==Entertainment Music and showmanship === Musicians that played the venue include AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Brix, Caravan, The Clash, Colosseum, Dexys Midnight Runners, Dr. Feelgood, The Damned, Edgar Broughton Band, Egg, Family, Free, Genesis, The Hamsters, Hawkwind, The Heartbreakers, Elton John, Judas Priest, Suzi Quattro, Queen, Roxy Music with Brian Ferry, the Sex Pistols, The Stranglers, Taste, Thin Lizzy, and Wishbone Ash, some of these up-and-coming during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Annual folk festivals were hosted for many years, featuring concerts, ceilidhs, craft stalls, and workshops and performances by local dance teams. One of the most popular events was presented by the Colin Chamley Band along with local singer Sandra Browne. Northern soul events also took place at the winter gardens and established it as one of the major venues for Northern Soul in the UK and up there with Wigan Casino and The Twisted Wheel. Melody Night took place every Wednesday evening, through to 2 am, and was famous throughout the county of Lincolnshire and beyond, thanks to the local economy needing to bring in contractors from all over the country. However its nickname of \\"The Bags Ball\\" still lives in the memory of those that frequented it, much more than its official name of \\"Melody Night\\". It also became famous during the early 1990s through to 2001 with the rise of the house music scene, drawing visitors from across the United Kingdom, holding monthly events such as After Eight, Democracy and Freedom, which saw the likes of Italian duo Fulvio Perniola and Gianni Bini of the production team Fathers of Sound, Nigel Benn, JFK, Chris & James, Renaissance (club) DJ's Ian Ossia and Nigel Dawson playing there. ===Sport=== Boxing On 28 February 1939, Olympia as the Winter Gardens was known then held its first boxing event in association with the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC). Many boxing matches have been held in Winter Gardens main room since the late 1970s. Local Grimsby boxing promoter Joe Frater, who was the first black promoter at the time, he organized dinners and many sell out boxing events over the years. Football Former Grimsby Town player Dave Boylen held sports dinner charity events for the Artie White Foundation at the Winter Gardens since 1997, which saw the likes of Denis Law attend the venue.

Prior to demolition there had been local representations for and against closure. After demolition an apartment development began on the site, but was halted because of the economic downturn.

The members are entertained and informed by a tradition of speakers and musical performance. == Background to the name == It was the wife of the first Secretary, C. G. Lowinger, who coined the name. Soon after the genesis of the idea of its formation, four men sat in the twilight in the garden of the Lowinger's house in the Gardens (a suburb of Cape Town) discussing what it should be called. And then: ‚ÄúInto the gathered darkness came Mrs Lowinger with the natural inquiry, ‚ÄòWhy are you all sitting here in the dark like a lot of owls?‚Äô ‚ÄòThe very name for our Club!‚Äô they cried, and the Owl Club it was called and remains‚Äù (Malcolm, 1959). Members are designated as ‚ÄúBrother Owl‚Äù or Owl so-and-so. The first formal meeting of the Owl Club took place on 1 October 1894. == Location of the Club == Down the years, the Club has met in various venues in the City of Cape Town. Between 1975 and 1998 it met at the Cape Town Club (formerly the City and Civil Service Club) in Queen Victoria Street. Since 1998, the venue for meetings has been the Kelvin Grove Club at Newlands, Cape Town, usually in the Grill Room. == The Club today == The Owl Club maintains a tradition of monthly dinners for members and their male guests; ‚Äúblack tie‚Äù is the customary plumage. The normal pattern of each meeting comprises a main speaker, always a guest, followed by a musical item which may be provided by an Owl or by an outside performer. There follows a bar interval, when the Owls and their guests move around to chat, often congregating around the bar. The second part of the meeting features a shorter talk by an Owl which, because of its purposeful inconsequence, is nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Waste Paper Basket‚Äù. A second musical item closes the evening. By convention, speakers are requested to avoid such references to religion, sexual matters and party politics that may give offence; English is the only language used for the addresses. If possible, the delivery should be ‚ÄúA light touch with something behind it‚Äù. The speaker is not subjected to interjections, nor is he required to answer questions after his address; and experience has shown that it is generally undesirable to invite them. The press are not present but the proceedings are recorded and a monthly digest is circulated to members. == Membership == Members are classified into one or more of five \\"faculties\\" which best describe their main interest: Art, Drama, Literature, Music or Science. The category might mirror a member's profession, though there are many members who have an interest in one or more of the Membership categories without engaging in it professionally. Membership is by invitation only. The fitness of a prospective member is judged initially by his proposer and seconder, who present his curriculum vit√¶ for consideration by the Committee of the Owl Club. He should have demonstrated some distinction in his area; but the overriding criterion should be his ability to dwell in harmony with his fellow Owls. So, on occasion, members have been elected more for their ‚Äúclubability‚Äù than for their distinction, and this is perfectly acceptable. Over its long history the Club has hosted many prestigious writers, artists, scientists, explorers and politicians but it remains charasterically discreet about it. == Opening hours and reciprocal arrangements == The Club meets on the third Tuesday of each month, with the exception of January; in December, to avoid a ‚Äúbump‚Äù with the Christmas meeting of the Oxford and Cambridge Club, the meeting may take place on the previous Tuesday. Meetings commence at 8.00 p.m., preceded by a dinner (6.30 p.m. for 7.00 p.m.) and last until about 10.30 p.m. The Owl Club enjoys reciprocal arrangements with the Savage Club and the Eccentric Club, both of London, and the Melbourne Savage Club in Australia. == Further information == The origins and history of the Owl Club from 1894 to 1950 are recorded by W. E. Ranby in The Owl Club 1894-1950 (Cape Town: The Owl Club, 1952). Eric Rosenthal and other Owls continued the account for the years 1951 to 1981 in a collective history, The third Tuesday (Cape Town: The Owl Club, 1982). For its centenary publication, the Club decided to compile an anthology based on the addresses to Owl Club members in the period since 1981: The unjealous years: an Owl Club anthology, selected and edited by James A. Henry, with illustrations by Tony Grogan, Joe Lister and Townley Johnson (Cape Town: The Owl Club, 1996). == References == MALCOLM, J. 1959, The Early History of 'The Owl Club', Cape Town 1894-1900.

The addiction later extended to other drugs such as oxycodone (Percocet). In 1995, her drug problems had developed to the point that she gave a \\"disastrous\\" performance at the Met in A√Øda, where she recalled that she could not hit a note at one point during the performance. The Met bought out her contract and dismissed her from the company. She sang in a few engagements at the Seattle Opera and at the Vienna State Opera in the 1990s, but was later asked not to return either to Vienna or the Salzburg Festival. She subsequently began rehabilitation at the Hazelden clinic in Minnesota over a period of 1.5 years.

In 1963 he decided to dedicate his time to electroacoustic composition utilising natural sounds. Performances in public of his music are done using the French \\"diffusion\\" technique over multiple loudspeakers. His work consists exclusively of tape pieces using natural, or \\"found\\" sounds, exploring morphological interplay and the ambiguities between sound and the images it may create. Dhomont's work has won many international awards including at the Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition (France), the Magisterium Prize in 1988, Prix Ars Electronica in 1992 (Linz, Austria) and others. In 1997, as the winner of the Canada Council for the Arts' Lynch-Staunton Prize, he was supported by the DAAD for a residence in Berlin. He was recently awarded a prestigious career grant by the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Qu√©bec. Dhomont is the editor of several electroacoustic music journals, and has produced many radio programs for Radio-Canada and Radio-France. From 1978 to 2005, he divided his time between France and Qu√©bec, where he taught at the Universit√© de Montr√©al from 1980 to 1996. He was a founding member of the Canadian Electroacoustic Community. He now lives in Avignon, France, and regularly presents his works in France and abroad. A great traveller, he frequently participates in juries. ==Recordings== * et autres utopies (empreintes DIGITALes, IMED 0682, 2006) * Jalons (empreintes DIGITALes, IMED 0365, 2003) * Cycle du son (empreintes DIGITALes, IMED 0158, 2001) * Frankenstein Symphony (Asphodel, ASP 0978, 1997) * For√™t profonde (empreintes DIGITALes, IMED 9634, 1996) * Sous le regard d'un soleil noir (empreintes DIGITALes, IMED 9633, 1996) * Les d√©rives du signe (empreintes DIGITALes, IMED 9608, 1996) * Cycle de l'errance (empreintes DIGITALes, IMED 9607, 1996) * Mouvances~M√©taphores (empreintes DIGITALes, IMED 9107/08, 1991) ==List of works== * √Ä cordes perdues (1977), doublebass, and tape * L'air du large (1997‚Äì98) * √Ä propos de K (2006) * Asie (1975), audiovisual presentation (images by Giovanni Biaggini) * Assemblages (1972) * AvatArsSon (1998) * Brief an den Vater (2005) * Cath√©drale d'images (1977), large-scale audiovisual presentation * Chiaroscuro (1987) * Chroniques de la lumi√®re (1989, 2005) * Cit√© du dedans (1972) * Convulsive!

The school was named after John Rennie (1904‚Äì1952), the Union Nationale Member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for Huntingdon from 1947 to 1952. Pointe-Claire was and remains in a riding that has voted for the Quebec Liberal Party; thus, when local representatives made their case to Premier Maurice Duplessis for the building of a new high school to meet the needs of the burgeoning post- World War II school population, Premier Duplessis' stipulation for the funding was for the building to be named after his recently deceased fellow Union Nationale MNA and longtime party fundraiser. However, this was not completely a partisan political decision of Premier Duplessis, as John Rennie had been the Assistant Director of Protestant Schools in Pointe-Claire from 1930 to 1936, as well as Principal of the Valois Park and Cedar Park Schools. John Rennie is administered by the Lester B. Pearson School Board. ==Extracurricular and Programs == John Rennie High School has taken part in the Canadian Improv Games for the past ten years, winning the Montreal games for eight of those years. Originally, every year it supported just one team, but as of 2004-2005, it started supporting a second team, sending both teams to compete in the CIG. John Rennie is proud to be the 2011 Canadian Improv Games' National champions. \\"We Need a Ride Home\\" has brought great pride to John Rennie by being the first Montreal team in over 10 years to bring home the gold. The Sport-√âtudes program was launched at John Rennie High School in the 2000-2001 school year. The Sport Federations involved have concluded protocols with the Lester B. Pearson School Board and John Rennie High School, local clubs/associations; and Ministry of Education, Leisure and Sports (MELS). Entrance criteria and practice requirements are set by the individual Federations. For the 2010-2011 school year, John Rennie's Sport-√âtudes program offers boxing, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, hockey, ringette, soccer, basketball, swimming, synchronized swimming, tennis, track & field and water polo. Actors' Studio, formerly run by Louise Chalmers before her retirement in 2010, has been very successful in producing many theatrical productions, including those written by Shakespeare, each with its own modern twist. Other programs include Academic Plus & Renniessance. As a member of Peaceful Schools International which declares a commitment to creating and maintaining a culture of peace within the school, John Rennie High School was the first school in Quebec to accommodate the award-winning experiential programme Challenge Day (2008). The Challenge Day mission is to provide youth and their communities with an opportunity to demonstrate the possibility of love and connection through the celebration of diversity, truth, and full expression. John Rennie brought Challenge Day back in 2011 for three days. The Respect Committee of the school will work to endorse the principles of peace and connection among the John Rennie High School community. == Expansion == In 1969, John Rennie was expanded nearly doubling its size and enrollment. A new cafeteria and a new library surrounded a new courtyard (now known as the Haden Garden), two new gymnasiums were added, and a state of the art auditorium/theater and music rooms were built. Also added were new science labs, more classroom space, art studios and a vocational-technical hall featuring wood, metal, and automobile repair shops. Due to the split-level design of the original building, the floors of the new two-story addition were floors \\"2\\" and \\"4\\". ==Notable alumni== * Adam Kelly, actor, writer, and filmmaker * Donovan King, performance activist and experimental theatre artist * Tetsuro Shigematsu, radio broadcaster and filmmaker * Jonas Tomalty, rock musician * Simon Despr√©s, National Hockey League (NHL) Pittsburgh Penguins * Vincent Lecavalier, NHL Philadelphia Flyers * Mike Matheson, drafted by NHL Florida Panthers * Tony Proudfoot, Canadian Football League Montreal Alouettes * Ian Turnbull, NHL Toronto Maple Leafs * Peter Worrell, NHL Florida Panthers * Wendy Crewson, actress * David I.

It looked like an enlarged version of the Messerschmitt Bf 110. It was not put into production; just three Me 261s were built and used primarily for testing and development purposes. 3D-model of the Me 261 ==Design and development== In 1937, Messerschmitt began Projekt P. 1064, a study for a long-range reconnaissance aircraft, and took the design of the Bf 110 twin-engine heavy fighter (and derivative Bf 161 reconnaissance / Bf 162 light bomber projects) as its basis. The P. 1064 had a long, slim fuselage with two wing-mounted engines. The aircraft was planned from the outset as a record-breaking aircraft, but after becoming convinced that the aircraft was capable of taking the world long-distance flight record, the German Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) approved the project and gave it the airframe designation number of 8-261.Green 1970, p. 617. The intended goal of the project was for an example of the aircraft to carry the Olympic flame from Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany (site of the 1936 Winter Olympics) to Tokyo, Japan for the 1940 Summer Olympics in what would be a record- breaking nonstop flight (5870 mi / 9445 km). The plan captured the imagination of Adolf Hitler at an early stage in its design and in tribute, the aircraft carried the unofficial name: Adolfine.Smith 1971, p. 99. The Me 261 incorporated a number of features which were highly advanced for its day. The single-spar all-metal wing was designed to serve as a fuel tank and its depth at the wing root was only slightly less than the height of the fuselage. The fuselage was of virtually rectangular section with space for five crew members, consisting of two pilots seated side-by-side with the radio operator directly behind in the front compartment, while a navigator and a flight engineer were housed in the rear fuselage under a stepped, glazed station.Green 1970, p. 617. Power came from four Daimler-Benz DB 601 engines, coupled together in pairs in a \\"power system\\" known as the DB 606, weighing 1.5 tonnes apiece and debuting in February 1937. The DB 606 \\"power systems\\" were originally developed for both the \\"single\\"-engined Heinkel He 119 high- speed reconnaissance aircraft, and the Heinkel He 177 strategic bomber, but the Me 261's design housed the DB 606 \\"power systems\\" in nacelles that afforded significantly better access for maintenance and ventilation of the \\"twinned\\" DB 601 component engines in each one, than the Heinkel heavy bomber possessed. Each pair of engines drove a variable-pitch propeller, intended to be a pair of counter-rotating propellers (as the He 177A had used for its fourth prototype onwards) with each four-blade propeller driven through a gearbox shared between the \\"twinned\\" DB 601 engines forming the \\"power system\\", generating 2,700 PS (1,985 kW) each.Green 1970, p. 618. The Me 261 had a conventional landing gear with unusually large and bulky low-pressure tires, much like modern day aircraft tundra tires, which prevented the aircraft from becoming bogged down on rough grass landing strips. The main gear's design appears to use main struts that rotated through 90¬∞ during their rearwards retraction sequence, with sizable main wheels resting atop the retracted struts (similar to those used on production examples of the contemporary Junkers Ju 88). Even the Me 261's fully retractable tailwheel possessed a larger-than-average, low-pressure pneumatic tire. ==Operational history== Construction of three prototypes began at Messerschmitt's Augsburg works during the spring of 1939, but progress was slow due to the realisation that war would probably soon break out and the 1940 Summer Olympics would be cancelled. The Me 261's original design brief as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft had been forgotten; now viewed as non-strategic, it was nearly abandoned with all work stopping in August 1939.Green 1970, p. 618. The Air Ministry subsequently realised that the Me 261 could still be a useful vehicle for evaluating long-range operations, and work resumed in the summer of 1940. ;Me 261 V1 The first flight of the Me 261 V1 was on 23 December 1940, flown by Messerschmitt's test pilot Karl Baur. Willy Messerschmitt wrote to Ernst Udet in early 1941 with the results of the first flight, predicting a range of over for the type. The decision to use the DB 606 engine was a problem because only a few were available for development projects, as most were needed for types already in production such as the Heinkel He 177. The Me 261 V1 was badly damaged during an Allied bombing attack on the Lechfeld Air Base in 1944 and eventually scrapped.\\"Messerschmitt Me 261 \\"Adolphine\\"\\" histaviation.com, 5 July 2006. Retrieved: 9 June 2010. ;Me 261 V2 The first flight of the Me 261 V2 was in early 1941. Official thinking now saw the Me 261 as a long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft. Messerschmitt had realised that the fuel- carrying nature of the aircraft's wings ruled out fitting armaments to them, and so both prototypes were tested for endurance through to 1943. There was a suggestion that one or both be used to drop propaganda leaflets on New York City, but nothing came of the idea before the aircraft were destroyed.Brian J Ford Secret Weapons Osprey Publishing 2011 p. 61 The Me 261 V2 was damaged during the same Allied bombing attack as the V1 and like it was later scrapped. ;Me 261 V3 The V3 differed from its predecessors in having two of the June 1940-debuted, DB 610 \\"power system\\" engines (which used two DB 605s each, instead of the paired 601s) and room for two additional crew members. The first flight of the Me 261 V3 was in early 1943; this aircraft had the longest series of flight tests. On 16 April 1943, the Me 261 V3 was flown by Karl Baur over a distance of in an elapsed time of 10 hours, setting an unofficial endurance record which could not be confirmed due to war conditions. In July 1943, the Me 261 V3's hydraulics failed on landing and the port undercarriage leg collapsed. The V3 was transported to Oranienburg for repairs, and after that used on a few long-range missions for the Luftwaffes reconnaissance division. Its ultimate fate is unknown. ==Specifications (Me 261 V3)== 3D computer generated view of the Me 261 from the top, front and left sides. ==See alsoReferencesFurther reading== * Green, William.

He also represented Scotland twice at full international level. ==Club career== Kenneth, who was brought up in Dundee, played for Dundee United Social Club and St.Josephs, before he returned with a second spell at Dundee United Social Club. Kenneth, who is a keen Dundee United supporter and came through the Jim McLean School of Excellence, made his debut for United in February 2005, playing in the 3‚Äì0 Scottish Cup win at Queen of the South. Playing in the remaining thirteen games of the season, Kenneth's introduction to league football saw eleven goals conceded in just four games. However, following the Cup semi-final win over Hibernian, his contribution helped United concede just four goals in the final six league games. Kenneth was part of the United team who lost the 2005 Scottish Cup Final against Celtic. Kenneth signed a new contract in October 2006, taking him to 2010. In March 2007, Kenneth moved to Cowdenbeath on loan for the remainder of the season, after losing his place in the United first team. Kenneth regained his place in the team in early 2008, playing in the League Cup final defeat to Rangers. In mid-January 2010, Dundee United rejected a ¬£75,000 bid from Blackpool for Kenneth, stating that the offer was \\"ridiculously small\\". On 29 January, and with the transfer window coming to a close, Blackpool manager Ian Holloway confirmed that the club had made a vastly improved offer for Kenneth. The offer believed to be in the region of ¬£500,000, was rejected by Dundee United, who after a fantastic 2009‚Äì10 season, valued the player at around ¬£2m. Kenneth helped Dundee United get to the 2010 Scottish Cup Final and started in The Terrors 3‚Äì0 win over Ross County. Kenneth stated in November 2011 that he would be leaving United at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, in the hope of earning a move to the Football League Championship. Kenneth played as a trialist for Airdrie United in a closed doors friendly against Rangers in July 2012. ===Bristol Rovers=== At the end of July 2012, he signed a three-year deal with League Two side Bristol Rovers. He made his Bristol Rovers d√©but in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Plymouth Argyle on 18 September 2012, playing the full 90 minutes of the match. He made his home debut on 22 September 2012 in a 1‚Äì1 draw to Fleetwood Town. He scored his first goal for Bristol Rovers on 6 October 2012, against Northampton Town, in a 3‚Äì1 win. After an injury-plagued 16 months, in December 2013 Bristol Rovers announced Kenneth had left the club by mutual consent. ===Later career=== On 12 February 2014, Kenneth signed for Scottish League One club Brechin City until the end of the season. On 21 August 2014, he signed for Junior club Carnoustie Panmure on a two-year deal. On 11 January 2015, it was announced that Kenneth had signed for Australian club Adamstown Rosebud playing in the Northern NSW NPL for the 2015 season. He then joined Latvian club Skonto Riga in July 2015 before returning to junior football in Scotland, signing for Forfar Albion in November 2015. On 15 February 2016, Kenneth signed a long- term contract with Lowland Football League side Selkirk. As of 2017, he was pursuing a career outside of football. On 5 August 2018, Kenneth signed for Lochee United.http://www.locheeunited.co.uk/news ==International career== Kenneth was part of the Scotland under-19 team who lost in the final of the 2006 European Under-19 Football Championship. Kenneth also played two warm-up games for the Scotland under-20s as preparation for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, featuring again in May and July 2007. Kenneth made his d√©but at under-21 level in the 3‚Äì2 defeat to Finland in September 2007, going on to win eight caps over the next twelve months. He was selected in the full national team for the first time along with teammate Paul Dixon for the friendly with the Czech Republic. He made his debut for Scotland in August 2010, playing 90 mins against Sweden. ==Honours== Kenneth playing for Dundee United in 2011 Dundee United *Scottish Cup : 1 :: 2005 (Runner-up), 2010 * Scottish League Cup :: 2008 (Runner-up) Scotland U-19s * European Under-19 Championship Runner-up: 1 :: 2006 Personal * Scottish Premier League Young Player of the Month: 1 :: March 2008 ==ReferencesCategory:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Dundee Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland youth international footballers Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Dundee United F.C. players Category:Cowdenbeath F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Brechin City F.C. players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Skonto FC players Category:Carnoustie Panmure F.C. players Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Scottish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate soccer players in Australia Category:Expatriate footballers in Latvia Category:Selkirk F.C. players Category:Lowland Football League players Category:Lochee United F.C. players ","title":"Garry Kenneth"},{"id":"6228076","text":"This Is an Exercise is an album by experimental electropop artist Anna Oxygen, released in 2006 on Kill Rock Stars.

Vargas Museum and Filipiniana Research Center located at the University of the Philippines, Diliman campus, Quezon City. Filipiniana, based on the definition by Isagani Medina from \\"Collection Building: Filipiniana\\", in his In Developing Special Library Collections, Filipiniana: Proceedings (November 1992), refers to Philippine-related books and non-book materials (such as Culture; figurines, games, fashion and others). The materials may be produced inside or outside the Philippines by Filipino or non-Filipino authors. The product could be literature written in any of the languages and dialects in the Philippines or a foreign language.Arlante, Salvacion M. and Rodolfo Y. Tarlit \\"Filipiniana\\", Nature and scope of Filipiniana materials, The State-of-the-Art of Filipiniana Collections in the Philippines, The State of Filipiniana, Filipino LibrarianFilipiniana Online, Filipino Librarian ==Etymology== Based on former dean and professor Rosa M. Vallejo of the Institute of Library Science of the University of the Philippines the term Filipiniana was a derivation from two root words: namely Filipinas, the Spanish-language version of the country name of the Philippines and -ana or -aniana, which means ‚Äúcollected items of information‚Äù which may be anecdotal or bibliographical in nature. ==Other definitions== Filipiniana is also defined as publications dealing with the Philippines in whatever language they may be written and place where they may have been printed. Filipiniana could also be materials published by Filipinos encompassing any subject matter regardless of the imprint of the publication. Filipiniana also include printed materials prior to the American period (1898‚Äì1946) in Philippine History regardless of the author and the topic. The De La Salle University Library defined Filipiniana as all book publications regarding the Philippines and the peoples and culture of the Philippines regardless of author, imprint and language. The definition encompasses, in general, works written by Filipinos, books written in the Philippine languages, publications and yearbooks produced by the government of the Philippines, publications include \\"substantial portions\\" and chapters about the Philippines (except publications containing only a small portion or a chapter about the Philippines), and works that deal with the \\"application of scientific thought and methodology to national and local ‚Äúneeds and circumstances\\" in the Philippines. ==Significance and purpose== As a collection, Filipiniana materials are required for studying the Philippines. The materials are helpful in providing information on the \\"extent of the intellectual faculties of [persons] born\\" in the Philippines and the industries, likings, and inclinations of these people, and the like. ==Scope== As a collection, there are two views related to Filipiniana, namely: the comprehensive Filipiniana collection and the specific Filipiniana collection. From these views and scope emerged other definitions or criteria for literary and non-literary items in order to be considered as Filipiniana materials. Wenceslao Retana defined Filipiniana in his Aparato Bibliogr√°fico de la Historia General de Filipinas (1906) as any book printed in the Philippines, regardless of the topic, that is \\"indispensable to the complete study of typhography\\" of the Philippine Islands. Luis Montilla defined Filipiniana in his A Brief Survey of the Bibliographical Accomplishments of the Past: A Plan for a New Philippine National Bibliography (1940) as writings and printed or published materials employing the languages of the Philippines regardless of the chosen topic by the author and irrespective of the place of publication. The scope extends to any work that has \\"distinct chapters\\" and \\"passages\\" or sections about the Philippines that can be used for ‚Äúlocal historical investigation and research‚Äù. == See also== *Compa√±√≠a General de Tabacos de Filipinas ==References== Category:Philippine literature ","title":"Filipiniana"},{"id":"6228094","text":"Book of Horizons is the fourth studio album by Secret Chiefs 3, released May 25, 2004.Web of Mimicry: SC3 accessed June 22, 2018 Book of Horizons was the first Secret Chiefs 3 album to reveal the satellite bands that form the actual band under their own names.

The song \\"Book T: Exodus\\" is the theme of the 1960 film The Exodus composed by Ernest Gold. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by William York stated \\"Secret Chiefs 3's first three studio albums were not exactly stripped- down affairs, but Book of Horizons is by far an ambitious release ... this is a frequently jaw-dropping album that should silence Spruance's anti-Bungle critics and, more importantly, challenge and entertain devoted fans of his past work\\". Daniel Lukes of Lollipop Magazine called the work \\"plaintive, harsh, witty, baffling, and thrillingly alien\\" and \\"the overall effect is akin to the imaginary soundtrack to an uncanny, Burroughs-esque parallel universe where gumshoes mix with Arabian mystics, cowboys, and aliens in search for the Ultimate Truth.\\" The overall effect is akin to the imaginary soundtrack to an uncanny, Burroughs-esque parallel universe where gumshoes mix with Arabian mystics, cowboys, and aliens in search for the Ultimate Truth. Music that is at times plaintive, harsh, witty, baffling, and thrillingly alien. Pitchfork contributor Jonathan Zwickel noted \\"Over three years in the making, Book of Horizons is Secret Chiefs' most expansive and coherent statement, an alchemical fusion of Morricone-esque cinematic grandeur, midnight surf guitar, traditional Middle Eastern rhythms and time signatures, demonic death metal, and electronic deviance that yields a work of undeniable force\\"Zwickel, J. Pitchfork Review, accessed June 22, 2018 The Scene Point Blank review warned \\"If you have a short attention span you are probably going to get lost mid-way through Book of Horizons. If you're looking for something straightforward, this will be a waste of your time.

It rises in a pool within Watnall Coppice close to the M1 motorway at the foot of the Misk Hills, coordinates 53.034471 N, 1.248907 W. It flows southeastwards through the Misk Meadows, passing very briefly into Broxtowe District, before returning to Ashfield District, then Pennine View, and Nabbs Lane Estates, where several parks and open spaces are centred on flood prevention lagoons. The Brook flows past Hucknall Aerodrome and into Farleys Lane Nature Area, following the A611 Hucknall Bypass. Farleys Lane Spring rises in the Brook close to this point and a deep pool is formed which is used for paddling and bathing. The Brook flows into the River Leen close to Moorbridge, Bulwell. ==Developments== As part of a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) scheme for farm conservation, a permissive path has been established alongside the brook from Farleys Lane to the dismantled railway embankment further to the east. As well as providing access to the waterside grassland for visitors, the hedgerows have been improved, and the pond to the east of Farleys Lane has been cleared, to provide a better habitat for invertebrates and birds. The lower reaches of the brook have been designated as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). However, the status of this section is under threat, due to proposals for a new industrial park and the construction of 900 new homes. Access roads for the development would cross the conservation site, and objections have been raised by the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, particularly because of its effect on local populations of water voles and lizards which are protected species. The developers and council have approached the Environment Agency about the possibility of culverting the watercourse in the area. ==Points of interestReferences== Category:Rivers of Nottinghamshire 2Farleys ","title":"Farleys Brook"},{"id":"6228113","text":"The Florida ThunderCats were an indoor soccer club based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida that competed in the National Professional Soccer League.

It can refer both a wider choice of services and better access for different socioeconomic groups. Financial deepening can have an effect on both individuals' and societies' economic situations. ==Features== The following are examples of different forms of financial deepening. Provision for the unbanked and underbanked in a society. Development of financial markets. Development of financial institutions and increasing the diversity in financial instruments. One of the key features of financial deepening is that it accelerates economic growth through the expansion of access to those who do not have adequate finance themselves. Typically, in an underdeveloped financial system, it is the incumbents who have better access to financial services through relationship banking. Moreover, incumbents also finance their growth through internal resource generation. Thus, in an underdeveloped financial system, growth is constrained to the expansion potential of incumbents. In mature financial systems on the other hand, financial institutions develop appraisal techniques, and information gathering and sharing mechanisms, which then enable banks to even finance those activities or firms that are at the margin, thereby leading to their growth-inducing productive activities in addition to the incumbents. The assumption is that the availability of external finance to budding entrepreneurs and small firms enables new entrepreneurship, while also providing competition to incumbents and consequently encouraging entrepreneurship and productivity. However, research indicates that widely available formal finance can produce informal intermediation, an unintended form of entrepreneurship. Hence, maintaining a sceptical approach when researching the effectiveness of initiatives is advisable. ==Macroeconomics== Financial deepening can have a macroeconomic effect for a country. Financial deepening generally can increase the ratio of money supply to GDP or some price index. It can have the effect of increasing liquidity. Having access to money can provide more opportunities for investment and growth. A developed financial system broadens access to funds; conversely, in an underdeveloped financial system, access to funds is limited and people are constrained by the availability of their own funds and have to resort to high cost informal sources such as money lenders. Lower the availability of funds and higher their cost, fewer would be the economic activities that can be financed and hence lower the resulting economic growth. Promoting well-managed financial deepening in low-income countries (LICs) can enhance resilience and capacity to cope with shocks, improve macroeconomic policy effectiveness, and support solid and durable inclusive growth. Financial deepening and macro-stability has been identified as a priority area in the years ahead for the Fund, as reflected in its Financial Surveillance Strategy paper. Managing Volatility and Supporting Low-income Country Growth Enhancing macro-economic policy effectiveness Shallow financial systems limit fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policy choices; hamper macroeconomic policy transmission; and impede opportunities for hedging or diversifying risk. This is of particular concern because LICs are vulnerable to external shocks, such as sharp swings in commodity prices and fluctuations in external financing. Limited policy space and instruments to mitigate the ensuing macroeconomic volatility often translate into large growth and welfare costs for these countries. ===Economic growth=== The association between economic growth and financial deepening has been a wide-ranging subject of experiential research. The practical evidence suggests that there is a significant positive relationship between financial development and economic growth. Many economists support the theory that financial development spurs economic growth. Theoretically, financial development creates enabling conditions for growth through either a supply- leading (financial development spurs growth) or a demand-following (growth generates demand for financial products) channel. A large body of empirical research supports the view that development of the financial system contributes to economic growth. Empirical evidence consistently emphasises the nexus between finance and growth, though the issue of direction of causality is more difficult to determine. At the cross-country level, evidence indicates that various measures of financial development (including assets of the financial intermediaries, liquid liabilities of financial institutions, domestic credit to private sector, stock and bond market capitalisation) are robustly and positively related to economic growth.(King and Levine, 1993; Levine and Zervos, 1998) Other studies establish a positive relationship between financial development and growth at the industry level. Some supporters of the view that internal factors determine growth (endogenous growth theory) nevertheless assign a special role to finance.(Aghion and Hewitt, 1998 and 2005) Financial systems in developing countries became inclusive in the twenty first century. However, they are still undiversified and small. ==Personal finance== Financial deepening can play an important role in reducing risk and vulnerability for disadvantaged groups, and increasing the ability of individuals and households to access basic services like health and education. This can have direct impact on poverty reduction. ==Limitations== In developing countries policy and exogenous influences determine whether financial deepening achieves optimum results. ==Country specific experienceIndia=== The All-India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), 2002 raised concerns about financial inclusion, it may have reduced since 1990. After the green revolution focus has been on financing crop loans connected largely with food grains. The Reserve Bank of India views the provision of banking to the poor as a viable business opportunity. It notes that costs and benefit exercises need to be attempted by the banks to make financial inclusion congruent with their business models. ==See also== * Development economics * Economic development * Financial ethics * Financial social work ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Financial Deepening and Economic Growth: Evidence From Asian Economies * Rethinking Financial Deepening : Stability and Growth in Emerging Markets Category:Economic development in India Category:Microfinance Category:Macroeconomic policy Category:Development economics Category:Economic growth ","title":"Financial deepening"},{"id":"6228125","text":"Kathy Sierra (born 1957) is an American programming instructor and game developer. ==Education and career== Sierra attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a major in exercise physiology and spent 10 years working in the fitness industry. She changed careers after attending programming classes at UCLA, later returning to teach a course on \\"new media interactivity\\" for UCLA Extension. She also led the new media team at Mind over Macintosh, a Los Angeles training center that provided training to advertising and entertainment corporations adapting digital technologies in the mid 1990s. She was the lead programmer on the computer games Terratopia, a 1998 children's adventure game released by Virgin Sound & Vision, and All Dogs Go to Heaven, a film-based game released as a free cereal premium by MGM. She also worked as a master trainer for Sun Microsystems, teaching Java instructors how to introduce new Java technologies and developing certification exams. In 1998, she founded the Java programmer's online community JavaRanch . She is the co- creator of the Head First series of books on technical (primarily computer) topics, along with her partner, Bert Bates. The series, which began with Head First Java in 2003, takes an unorthodox, visually intensive approach to the process of teaching programming. Sierra's books in the series have received three nominations for Product Excellence Jolt Awards, winning in 2005 for Head First Design Patterns, and were recognized on Amazon.com's yearly top 10 list for computer books from 2003 to 2005. In 2005 she coined the phrase \\"The Kool- Aid Point\\" to describe the point at which detractors emerge purely due to the popularity of a topic being promoted by others. Sierra says that her interest in cognitive science was motivated by her epilepsy, a condition for which she takes anti-seizure medication. \\"My interest in the brain began when I had my first grand mal seizure at the age of four,\\" she wrote on her personal weblog. After years of being mostly absent from the open internet, in July 2013 she started the site \\"Serious Pony\\" including a blog, together with a Twitter account, although as of October 2014 the latter had been deleted due to ongoing harassment. ==Harassment and withdrawal from online life== In March 2007, Sierra abruptly canceled her appearance at the O'Reilly ETech conference in San Diego due to threatening blog posts and emails, including death threats. Sierra's harassers posted doctored images of her face next to a noose or being strangled. The harassment increased after the threats were reported in the news. The hacker and self-professed \\"Internet troll\\" Andrew Auernheimer, known as weev, told the New York Times that he was responsible for posting false information about Sierra online, along with her address and Social Security number, a form of harassment known as doxxing. Sierra gave up her technology career as a result of the harassment, withdrawing from most public-speaking events and no longer blogging. In her final post, she wrote that she did not want to be involved with the culture of the Blogosphere as long as such harassment was accepted. She later wrote, \\"I had no desire then to find out what comes after doxxing, especially not with a family\\".Sierra, quoted in The issue triggered public discussion on the concept of a bloggers' code of conduct. Some bloggers, including Robert Scoble, author of the technology blog Scobleizer, temporarily suspended their blogs in a show of support for Sierra. One of the larger issues Scoble felt was highlighted by the incident was online hostility to women: \\"It's this culture of attacking women that has especially got to stop,\\" Scoble said \\"[W]henever I post a video of a female technologist there invariably are snide remarks about body parts and other things that simply wouldn't happen if the interviewee were a man.\\" ==Selected publications== *Mike Meyers' Java 2 Certification Passport (McGraw- Hill Osborne, 2001) *Sun Certified Programmer & Developer for Java 2 Study Guide (McGraw-Hill Osborne, 2002) *Head First EJB (O'Reilly Publishing, 2003) *Head First Servlets and JSP (O'Reilly Publishing, 2004) *Head First Design Patterns (O'Reilly Publishing, 2004) *SCJP Sun Certified Programmer for Java 5 Study Guide (McGraw-Hill Osborne, 2005) *Head First Java (O'Reilly Publishing, 2005) *OCP Java SE 6 Programmer Practice Exams (Exam 310-065) (McGraw-Hill Osborne, 2010) *OCA/OCP Java SE 7 Programmer I & II Study Guide (Exams 1Z0-803 & 1Z0-804) McGraw-Hill 2014 *Badass: Making Users Awesome (O'Reilly Media, 2015) *OCA Java SE 8 Programmer I Exam Guide (Exams 1Z0-808) 1st Edition McGraw-Hill 2017 *OCP Java SE 8 Programmer II Exam Guide (Exam 1Z0-809) 7th Edition McGraw-Hill 2018 ==See also== * Gamergate controversy ==References *Sierra's Creating Passionate Users weblog *The Java programmer's community JavaRanch *Kathy Sierra interview at The Web 2.0 Show - Hosted by Adam Stacoviak and Josh Owens *Kathy Sierra interview at Benjamen Walker's Theory of Everything podcast *Badass ‚Äî An Interview with Kathy Sierra on the Society for Technical Communication's \\"Notebook\\" blog, with Nicky Bleiel Category:1957 births Category:California Polytechnic State University alumni Category:American bloggers Category:American technology writers Category:Living people Category:O'Reilly writers Category:People from California Category:People with epilepsy Category:Victims of cyberbullying Category:Video game developers Category:Sun Microsystems people Category:Women video game developers Category:Women technology writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American women bloggers ","title":"Kathy Sierra"},{"id":"6228137","text":"Bluewater Bay is an unincorporated residential and golf resort community located between Niceville and Destin in Okaloosa County, Florida.

Her early theatrical appearances included Stop Thief, Officer 666, The Only Son and with Richard Mansfield in Cyrano de Bergerac. A winsome and pretty blonde, Martin entered the motion picture industry in 1914. Her first role was in The Wishing Ring: An Idyll of Old England (1914) for the World Film Company, in which she played Sally, a parson's daughter. Martin subsequently became a contract player for the Famous Players Film Company, where she achieved popularity as a rival to Mary Pickford. Among her other credits are The Third Kiss (1919), Her Official Fiancee (1919), The Innocent Adventuress (1919), and Louisiana (1919). She made forty-four movies in all, including some for the Fox Film Corporation. In the early 1920s, Martin started her own production company and released her films through the Goldwyn Corporation. Her career entered into a downward spiral soon afterwards as a result of a lawsuit for payment of studio rentals. Although eventually settled out of court, the case did irreparable damage to her standing among her peers. In April 1921 Martin left movies and returned to the stage. Her theatrical revival began with a three-act comedy entitled First Night Out by Adelaide Matthews and Ann Nichols. Vivian Martin died in New York City in 1987, aged 93. Her obituary in the New York Times noted her philanthropy and association with the Professional Children's School in New York. She contributed to the lives of young performers as both a friend and benefactress. At one time Martin was married to actor William Jefferson.

In seventy-two career Busch Series starts, Cooper recorded one win and one career top-10 points showing. ==1988== Cooper made his debut with his own #56 Buick, and started 1988 with the intent to run all the races. Cooper would only qualify for 25 of the 30 races, but it was a solid season nonetheless. After finishing 18th in his series debut at Rockingham, Cooper earned his first top-10 at South Boston, finishing 6th. Cooper would earn three other top-10 finishes on the year, highlighted by his first career top-5 with a fifth at Dover. His qualifying was solid, too, with an outside pole at Lanier being the best of six top-ten starts. Despite missing five races, and not finishing five more, Cooper finished an impressive 15th-place points finish in the final tally. ==1989== Cooper's best career year came in 1989, when he recorded eighth place in the series. The highlight of the season had to be his first (and only) career victory, as he paced the field at Lanier, his home track. However, Cooper was solid elsewhere, recording four top-fives and ten top-tens. Eight top-ten qualifying efforts also helped the driver to the final points effort, but five DNFs hindered Cooper's effort to move up any higher. ==1990== Sadly, Cooper's team began to run out of money, as it was a small family-owned team. Cooper would only make eight starts as a result in 1990. It did not help the team's situation that they struggled early, crashing out of three out of the first four races of the year. The team was solid in the other four, finishing no worse than 16th in the final four starts, highlighted by a fifth place at Dover. The financial situation did not approve and Cooper's team folded following Dover. ==1993== Cooper got his team to restart for three races in 1993, driving the #56 Johnny Cotton Chevy late in the season. The races were solid for Cooper, as he finished 16th, 14th and then 12th at Atlanta. ==1994== Cooper's #56 team was back for only seven more starts in 1994. Cooper, whose career had been made of saving his equipment, only managed to finish two races on the year. However, they were both solid as he recorded a pair of sevenths at Rockingham and Charlotte. Cooper's team, though, had to fold again, and Cooper has not raced in NASCAR since. ==Motorsports career resultsNASCAR=== (key) (Bold ‚Äì Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Plewa Memorial Lake Parkway or the Lake Parkway, is a state highway in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It runs north‚Äìsouth in Milwaukee County from downtown Milwaukee to its southern suburbs. WIS 794 is the highest numbered Wisconsin state highway in the state trunk highway system. WIS 794 is one of only two numbered state trunk highways, along with WIS 39, that share a number designation with an Interstate or US Highway within the state's borders. Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) policy prohibited dual designations within the state trunk highway system, prior to the commissioning of I-39. ==History== The Lake Parkway was originally planned to be a lakeside freeway, named the Lake Freeway, extending from just north of downtown Milwaukee all the way south to the Illinois state line connecting with the Amstutz Expressway and possibly following all the way to Lake Shore Drive. Due to protests over construction, the Lake Freeway was never completed, and the Amstutz Expressway in Illinois was similarly never completed. Before the Lake Freeway project was cancelled, a portion of the route was built immediately south of downtown Milwaukee. The Hoan Bridge, a bridge spanning the mouth of the Milwaukee River connecting downtown and Bay View, was constructed. However, the bridge stood unused for three years subsequent to its completion, unconnected to any other road, and locally it was known as the \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\". The unfinished bridge was used as the site of a car chase scene in the movie The Blues Brothers. In 1977, the freeway was connected to the East‚ÄìWest Freeway and Carferry Drive, causing traffic from the Lake Freeway to exit and crowd onto surface streets. In the 1990s, construction on what would become the Lake Parkway began along the Union Pacific/former Chicago and North Western Transportation Company right-of-way. The whole project took approximately eight years. The Lake Parkway opened in October 1999. Cudahy The freeway section of WIS 794‚Äîthe John R. Plewa Memorial Lake Parkway, as it is formally known‚Äîwas finally completed to the corner of East Edgerton Avenue and South Pennsylvania Avenue, after six years of terminating at the Layton Avenue off-ramp. Officially, the parkway has four exits. The Oklahoma Avenue exit, however, requires a traffic light for southbound vehicles to enter. The stoplight is a major reason why the parkway is not considered an Interstate Highway for its entire length.

He was also a renowned statesman, writer, and politician. Tom√°s Borge also held the titles of \\"Vice-Secretary and President of the FSLN\\", member of the Nicaraguan Parliament and National Congress, and Ambassador to Peru. Considered a hardliner, he led the \\"prolonged people's war\\" tendency within the FSLN until his death. In 2010, he stated in an interview: \\"I am proud to be a Sandinista, to continue being faithful to the red and black flag of our party, to continue being faithful to our revolutionary organization; and to die proud of raising the front, and not having been disloyal to my principles, nor disloyal with my friends nor my companions, nor with my flag, nor with my cries of war.\\"Tom√°s Borge: 80 a√±os no es nada.25 July,2010El 19 Digital ==Early life== Borge was born in Matagalpa on August 13, 1930. His father, Tom√°s Borge Delgado, was one of Augusto C√©sar Sandino's deputy commanders during the United States occupation of Nicaragua, from 1926 to 1932. From a young age, Borge integrated himself in the fight against the Somoza family dictatorship, which had ruled Nicaragua since the assassination of Sandino. In 1943, he began participating in revolutionary activities, and in 1946, he was editing the newspaper \\"Espartako\\" against the regime of General Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a. ==Meeting Fonseca== After his secondary education, Borge enrolled into the Law Faculty of the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua-Le√≥n in 1956. The following year, he met Carlos Fonseca with whom Borge would forge a strong friendship. Borge was six years older than Fonseca, which influenced Borge strongly. With Fonseca, Borge read the first few books that would forge their political philosophies: \\"Utopia\\" by Thomas More, some works by John Steinbeck, works by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as well as some works by Lenin. Along with Fonseca, Borge participated in a group of Marxist Nicaraguan students, who formed the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN), which was based on Marxist thought and pro-Soviet leanings.¬´Tom√°s Borge Mart√≠nez formaba parte de la direcci√≥n nacional hist√≥rica del FSLN¬ª, article from May 1, 2012 in the daily journal La Jornada (Nicaragua). He was put under house arrest from 1956 to 1959 during the government crackdown following the assassination of Somoza by poet Rigoberto L√≥pez P√©rez. In 1959, he escaped to Honduras, where he was captured by the Honduran border patrol. Otto Castro, a friend of both Borge and the president of Honduras at the time, arranged for Borge's release. Borge then travelled using a false passport to El Salvador and Costa Rica,Borge, Tomas: The Patient Impatience, pp. 91‚Äì106. Curbstone Press, 1992 where he would found the Juventud Revolucionaria Nicarag√ºense (Nicaraguan Youth Revolutionaries).Coordinadora Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (2014): ¬´Tom√°s Borge Mart√≠nez, tambi√©n es \\"de los muertos que nunca mueren\\"¬ª, article from April 30, 2014 from Aporrea. ==Foundation of Sandinista National Liberation Front== After the victorious Cuban Revolution, Fonseca, Borge, and a few companions decided to use militant tactics to fight against the Somoza regime. They participated in the formation of a militia under the command of Rigoberto L√≥pez P√©rez to face off against the National Guard of Nicaragua. The results were disastrous on July 24, 1959, when Fonseca was gravely injured. Then, Borge was in Costa Rica with Silvio Mayorga; they thought Fonseca had perished. Upon reuniting with Fonseca, the three left to Cuba and formed friendships with Che Guevara and Tamara Bunke, who had helped them with the guerilla. In Cuba, Mayorga reunited with a group of young Nicaraguans from Venezuela, and they formed what would later be the \\"Frente Sandinista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional\\" (National Sandinista Liberation Front). The name was derived from Augusto Sandino to convince Nicaraguans that Sandino's revolution was not dead. Also, the name Sandino was widely used to elicit strong emotion for the cause using the fallen leader's popularity. Fonseca traveled to Honduras to prepare the logistics that would permit the establishment of the group. On July 23, 1961, in Tegucigalpa, Borge, along with Carlos Fonseca, Francisco Buitrago, Jorge Navarro, Silvio Mayorga, Jos√© Benito Escobar, Noel Guerrero, and Germ√°n Pomares, formed the FSLN, which would be the key to the downfall of the Somoza regime and the start of the Sandinista Revolution. The FSLN was established in Honduras on the banks of the Patuka River. In 1962, the FSLN had 60 men in its ranks. Borge crossed into Nicaragua to recruit more members to the Sandinista cause. ==Insurrection== Between 1965 and 1966, Tom√°s Borge headed the Sandinista newspaper \\"The Republican Mobilization.\\" The next year, he tried again to create an active guerrilla group in the mountains near the Pancas√°n region, which was defeated. In 1969, the National Directorate of the FSLN (Borge was a member) named Fonseca as Secretary General. In January 1969, along with Ruiz, Borge was arrested for arms smuggling on the border with Costa Rica. Both are deported to Colombia; there begins a period of exile that took him to Cuba and Peru. In that time, he also visited the base of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon, passed by Mexico, and eventually returned to the ranks of the FSLN in Nicaragua. On February 4, 1976, he was arrested again and sent to prison, where he was tortured. While in prison, the FSLN suffered several defeats and heavy losses. Fonseca perished in Zinica (Waslala, North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region of Nicaragua). Borge was in prison in Matagalpa; a colonel in the National Guard told him the news of Fonseca's death, to which Borge said In August 1978, Borge was one of the highest ranking Sandinistas released from prison after the spectacular Sandinista raid (Operation Chanchera) on the Nicaraguan National Palace by 19 commandos, headed by Ed√©n Pastora (Commander Zero) that took the entire Congress hostage. The FSLN is divided into three factions and Tom√°s Borge lead the Prolonged Popular War fraction (GPP). On January 7, 1979, the FSLN came to an agreement on reunification, which was formalized in March, and Borge became one of the nine members of the National Directorate. The triumphant guerrilla troops entered Managua on 19 July 1979. Days earlier, on July 11, Borge attended a meeting of the National Directorate along with Daniel Ortega, Sergio Ramirez and Miguel d' Escoto in Costa Rica at the home of President Rodrigo Carazo Odio in Puntarenas with William Boudlerom, representative of the US government. At that meeting, Borge rejected the proposal to replace Somoza with Urcuyos Malia√±os Francisco, President of the Congress, as established in the Constitution of 1974 would take place in the absence of the president. Somoza fled on 17 July and Urcuyos was named president. Not too long after, Urcuyos was overthrown and power was passed to the Joint Government of National Reconstruction. Borge landing in Cuba off a C-130 Venezuelan Airforce plane on August 25, 1978, after being released as a political prisoner after the Sandinista hostage standoff operative at the National Palace in Managua, 3 days earlier. ===The revolution=== On July 19, 1979, FSLN troops entered Managua and proclaimed the Sandinista Revolution. Borge, reputed to be the most radical of the nine commanders of the Front, was a member of the National Directorate of the FSLN and took charge of the Ministry of Interior (overseeing the Sandinista Police, prisons, immigration, Directorate General of State Security and Fire), a position he maintained until the loss of the presidential election in February 1990. His first task in office was the dissolution of the National Guard and the reviewing of the cases of former Somoza government officials. He also attempted to eliminate crimes (moderate and minor), vagrancy, gambling and drinking. Tom√°s Borge was part of the first revolutionary government delegation which visited the Soviet Union on March 17, 1980. On the trip, he described the situation in his country as follows: On July 19, 1981, in celebration of the third anniversary of the revolution, Borge reiterated that national unity, pluralism and a mixed economy were designed to strengthen, not to destabilize the revolutionary process. It was another warning to the opposition and entrepreneurs. At the same time, he ordered the dismissal of any officer who abused their authority. In 1982, Tom√°s Borge was elected vicepresident of the Permanent Conference of Political Parties in Latin America, an association of social democratic, socialist, liberal and nationalist parties on the continent. ===After defeat=== After the electoral defeat of 1990, some members of the National Directorate abandoned politics, and the FSLN underwent a transformation into the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS). Borge and Bayardo Arce with Daniel Ortega were the only members who remained in the FSLN.Nicaragua Fallece fundador del FSLN, Tom√°s Borge Mart√≠nez \\"Es de los muertos que nunca mueren\\", dice Rosario Murillo Between 1997 and 2002, he was a member of the Central American Parliament, Parlac√©n, and since 2001, a member of the National Assembly. ===Return to power=== In the presidential elections held on November 5, 2006, the Sandinista candidate Daniel Ortega won with 38% of the vote. Borge increased his influence in the government. On March 22, 2007, at his request, he was appointed Ambassador of Nicaragua to Peru, where he served until his death. His appointment was seen as a retreat from political life. ===Death=== On April 6, 2012, Borge entered the Military Hospital Alejandro D√°vila Bola√±os in Managua where he underwent a video-assisted thoracic surgery for a lung condition which had been progressing (according to some unofficial sources, he had cancer because he traveled to Cuba without being treated first). On April 9, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit after a respiratory complication developed while staying under medical supervision. Tom√°s Borge en estado delicado.

The Misquitos accused Borge, among others, of the displacement and killing of those who opposed the Sandinista government, as told by the President of the Permanent Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States(OAS), Marcos Carmona, to the FSLN and opposition in the context of an election campaign.El Nuevo Diario - Managua, Nicaragua - Ortega acusado de genocidio contra miskitos Another accusation against Borge was that he gave the order to kill 37 dissidents imprisoned in Granada during the first term of Ortega. He was charged, along with the rest of the Sandinista government, after the victory of Violeta Chamorro in 1990, of the \\"Pi√±ata Sandinista\\", where they were accused of confiscating public properties. The charges were always rejected by Borge. He created the Council of Sandinista Defense (CDS), like the Cuban's CDR, and the current Council of Citizen Power. He founded the open prisons, where prisoners were without custody, and the women's prison \\"La Esperanza\\", a novelty in Nicaragua.Fallece Tom√°s Borge, √∫ltimo sobreviviente fundador Sandinista Por Por FILADELFO ALEMAN y MARJORIE MILLER In an interview with the newspaper Nuevo Diario of Nicaragua for the 30th anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution, Borge said: ==Private life== His first wife, Yelba Mayorga, was killed in 1979 during the guerrilla struggle and had a son. Later, he married Josephine Cerda and had several children with her. In 2007, he married the Peruvian actress Marcela Perez Silva and had three children with her.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/tomas-borge-last- surviving-founder-of-the-sandinistas-7704217.html ==Writings== Borge was the author of several works of poetry, essays, and an autobiography. The Cuban poet Roberto Fernandez Retamar believes that Borge's book \\"Carlos, el amanecer no es s√≥lo un sue√±o\\", which he wrote in prison, is comparable in literary merit to the documentary prose of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez.

It ran for six seasons from 1993 to 1998. The programme was hosted in the studio by Johnny Vaughan together with a female reporter - Laurie Pike in the first season, Sally Gray in series 2-3 and Alex McLeod in series 4-6 - who would generally be based in LA. Moviewatch was produced by Chapter One productions and filmed at the Channel 4's Horseferry Road headquarters in London. Each week four members of the public would watch four forthcoming films. They would then discuss each film in turn, along with Johnny. There would also be interviews with actors and directors as well as news about upcoming films. The guest reviewers would mark each film out of ten. The film with the highest rating at the end of the show was declared the Moviewatch Film of the Week. During the show's run, very few films achieved a perfect 10/10 from all four reviewers - most notably Spike Lee's Malcolm X, and in the final episode of the last season, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's Good Will Hunting, for which they went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay at the 70th Academy Awards. ==References== Category:1993 British television series debuts Category:1997 British television series endings Category:Film criticism television series Category:Channel 4 original programming ","title":"Moviewatch"},{"id":"6228166","text":"Chekhov Library in Taganrog (full name The Central Municipal Public Library named after Anton Chekhov, ) is the oldest library in the South of Russia. ==Foundation history== The public library along with a small bookstore were officially inaugurated on 23 May 1876 by the Governor of Taganrog Admiral Johan Hampus Furuhjelm. The City Council gave to the library some of its vacant offices on Grecheskaya Street. Before, there were only private libraries and libraries at the Boys Gymnasium, Mariinskaya Girls Gymnasium and the Taganrog Naval School. In March 1878, the Public Library moved into another building granted by the City Council on Petrovskaya Street. ==School years of Anton Chekhov== Among the first subscribers were the future world- famous writer Anton Chekhov, historian Pavel Filevsky, Vladimir Bogoraz, artists Seraphima Blonskaya and Dmitri Sinodi-Popov. Andrei Drossi, the classmate of Chekhov wrote later in his memoirs: \\"..every Sunday and every holiday we came early in the morning in the city library and spent there hours and hours, forgetting about food, sitting and reading magazines...\\". At that time, Anton Chekhov lived in Taganrog alone, as the whole family had moved to Moscow. According to archive records, the first books read by Chekhov were books on travel and adventures, then Miguel de Cervantes, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ivan Turgenev and Ivan Goncharov, later - Dimitri Pisarev, Vissarion Belinsky and Nikolay Aleksandrovich Dobrolyubov. Thanks to the library of his home city, Chekhov being a gymnasium student learnt about the periodicals that later published his short stories. ==Books from Chekhov the writer== In 1890, mayor of Taganrog Konstantin Foti asked Chekhov to send his books with author's dedications to the Taganrog Public Library. Anton Chekhov considered this request as recognition from the home city, and replied I am happy to be helpful to my homecity, to which I owe a lot and that I love very much. The first three books were collections of his stories and a book by Leo Tolstoy with the author's dedication. Chekhov kept the tradition of sending his books, rare books, books with autographs and foreign books with every opportunity from 1890 up until his death in Badenweiler in 1904. ==The Chekhov Library and Museum== In 1904, following Chekhov's death, the library was named after the world-famous playwright and short-story writer. A room of the library was also dedicated for the first Chekhov Museum in Russia. In 1906-1907, the City Council discussed the construction of a new building that would house both Chekhov Library and Chekhov Museum. After thorough analysis, the council decided to build a library, paying tribute to the late author Anton Chekhov, assigning for this purpose 25,000 rubles. The commission addressed the friend of Chekhov, architect Fyodor Schechtel in March 1910. He gave his agreement along with the library project in July 1910. The small house built in 1878 was demolished and the new library was officially laid down on 14 September 1910. It was completed in August 1911 and opened its doors in 1912. The music department of the library is located at the historical Tchaikovsky House in Taganrog. ==Gallery== Image:Taganrog cityhall19th.jpgThe old City Hall, home to the City Public Library in 1876-1877, photo taken in 2006.

He made seven full international appearances for the Scottish national team between 2009 and 2013. Conway started his career with Ayr United before moving to Scottish Premier League side Dundee United in 2006. Ayr did not receive compensation for the deal until 10 months after he left. In 2011, he moved to Championship side Cardiff on a free transfer. In September 2013, he signed for Brighton & Hove Albion in the English Football League Championship on a three-month loan. In January 2014, Conway joined Championship side Blackburn Rovers on a -year deal. After leaving Blackburn in 2019, he had a short spell with Salford City, before signing for St Johnstone in 2020. ==CareerDundee United=== Born in Irvine, North Ayrshire, Conway started his career with Caledonian Boys Club in Prestwick and later signed with Ayr United, making 61 league appearances for the club and scoring seven times. Conway's good form alerted then-Dundee United manager Craig Brewster and he agreed a pre-contract deal with Conway to bring him to Tannadice, with the transfer completed on 1 June 2006, with compensation decided ten months later. Largely used as a substitute under Brewster, Conway started the majority of matches under Craig Levein and assisted more goals than any other United player in 2006‚Äì07. In February 2007, Conway suffered a broken foot which appeared to end his season prematurely. However, Conway appeared in the final four matches of the season. Although playing at the start of the following season, it transpired that Conway was suffering similar issues and it was discovered that a bone graft was needed, ruling Conway out for the last three months of 2007. Conway returned to action in 2007‚Äì08, playing three matches before being sidelined for four months, returning in December. He scored his first goal for the club a month later in the 2‚Äì1 win over Kilmarnock in January and two matches later, scored the third goal in the 4‚Äì1 League Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen.

Conway returned in time for pre-season. He made his competitive return on 14 August 2012 against Northampton in a 2‚Äì1 League Cup defeat. Following a lack of first team football during the season, Conway put in a transfer request on 23 November 2012 after starting only two games out of his four total appearances. The request was rejected by manager, Malky Mackay. Conway was included in the squad for the next two games following the request and he made an appearance against Derby County. His first goal of the season came on 2 December, where he scored the winner against Sheffield Wednesday, which ensured Cardiff beat their Club record of nine successive home wins. Following a run of successful performances, Conway withdrew his transfer request on 21 December, and went on to play a crucial role in Cardiff's Championship-winning season, including scoring the goal that sealed the title in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Turf Moor against Burnley in April. Loan to Brighton & Hove Albion On 13 September 2013, Conway joined Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion on a 93-day short-term loan, running until 14 December 2013.

Dr. Herring proposed that the problem of defining the physical domain in a computer or cyber-infrastructure, providing real time and appropriate fidelity, required a cyber-spatial reference or index combining both Internet Addressing and Hierarchical Spatial Addressing. As such, the Geoweb would be characterized by the self synchronization of network addressing, time and location. The Geoweb would allow location to be used to self organize all geospatially referenced data available through the Internet. The interest in a Geoweb has been advanced by new technologies, concepts and products, specifically the popularization of GPS positioning with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Virtual globes such as Google Earth and NASA World Wind as well as mapping websites such as Google Maps, Live Search Maps, Yahoo Maps, and OpenStreetMap have been major factors in raising awareness towards the importance of geography and location as a means to index information. The increase in advanced web development methods such as Ajax are providing inspiration to move GIS (Geographical Information Systems) into the web. Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) has emerged as an academic community interested in technical aspects of helping people find information about places. In order to make information accessible from geographically oriented applications, coordinate metadata must be created via some form of geocoding or geoparsing process. After obtaining geographic coordinates, they must be indexed in useful ways that allow people to interact with the non-geographic nature of the content, e.g. viewing photographs or keyword searching. The semi-annual Geoweb Summits in New York have covered the emerging geoweb industry since 2010, connecting GIS and mobile LBS with Internet of things and augmented reality. ==Related References== * Papadimitriou, Fivos.

He switched to guitar when their ex- guitarist Fredrik Johansson quit, but recorded bass again once on Construct when the band had no bassist at the time. He composed much of the band's music throughout his tenure, especially between Projector and Fiction. Although Henriksson had been inactive with the band since 2015 it wasn't until January 2016 that he started to realize he didn't want to be in the band anymore. His official resignation became effective March 31, 2016 when Dark Tranquillity announced Henriksson's departure from the band. ==Style== In Dark Tranquillity, he plays both rhythms and melodies. He is known for his smooth playing style, while Niklas Sundin, Dark Tranquillity's other guitarist, has a more harsh style. He normally does not play solos (Sundin usually performs them). Some exceptions to that are the songs 'Focus Shift' and 'Lost to Apathy', in whose videos Martin is seen playing slow, smooth leads. His riffs are sometimes complemented with pick slides and harmonics. When he was on bass (using picks), he also played melodies. ==Equipment== Martin's main stage guitars include a Gibson Explorer and a Gibson Les Paul Studio Lite. He previously used Rocktron Prophesy rack mounted pre-amps, but after the Damage Done tour, he and Niklas Sundin begun using Peavey 5150 and Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier amplifiers along with Behringer V-AMP 2 PRO modeling processors. In the making off We Are The Void, they show a Peavey 6505s. ==References *Dark Tranquillity Category:Living people Category:Swedish songwriters Category:Rhythm guitarists Category:Swedish heavy metal guitarists Category:1974 births Category:Dark Tranquillity members ","title":"Martin Henriksson"},{"id":"6228209","text":"Anne Patricia Kerr (24 March 1925 ‚Äì 29 July 1973) was a British Labour Party politician who was elected for two successive terms as a Member of Parliament. ==Early life== Before entering politics she was an actress and television interviewer.

It is found off the coasts of East Asia and is closely related to Portunus armatus. ==Fishery== P. trituberculatus is the world's most heavily fished crab species, with over 300,000 tonnes being caught annually, 98% of it off the coast of China. This is because it is considered highly nutritious, especially in regard to crab cream (roe). ==Distribution== P. trituberculatus is found off the coasts of Japan, Korea, China, Palau and Taiwan. ==Description== The carapace may reach wide, and from front to back. P. trituberculatus may be distinguished from the closely related (and also widely fished) P. armatus by the number of broad teeth on the front of the carapace (three in P. trituberculatus, four in P. armatus) and on the inner margin of the merus (four in P. trituberculatus, three in P. armatus). ==Taxonomy== P. trituberculatus was first described by Edward J. Miers in 1876, under the name Neptunus trituberculatus. To better understand the species development, evolution and reproduction a reference genome has been sequenced, assembling to 1.0 Gb in size and anchoring to 50 chromosomes.

Situated on the south shore of Lake Tornetr√§sk, it lies at the edge of the Abisko National Park. The station conducts ecological, geological, geomorphological and meteorological research in subarctic environments and each year about 500 scientists visit from all over the world. The varied geological, topographical and climatic conditions of the area allow it to be inhabited by a range of flora and fauna. These features, which have caused the area to be given National Park status, also make it an important place for scientific research, particularly of alpine and subalpine ecosystems. ==The station== The first proper field station to be established in the area dates back to 1903, however the official station has only been affiliated with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences since 1935. The station holds meteorological datasets extending back to 1913, including air and soil temperature, precipitation and UV radiation. The research station has been the site of many long-term experiments investigating climate change impacts and is part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) which is an international collaboration investigating the effects of environmental change on plants in circumpolar ecosystems. Since December 2010 the station is managed by the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat. The research station today consists of laboratories and general workrooms containing a variety of scientific equipment, and also of various 'outposts' where research is carried out in situ. It is used for research, teaching and meetings, and has a large collection of scientific books and papers available on site. ==Current research== PMMA chambers used to measure methane and CO2 emissions in Storflaket peat bog near Abisko. Though many research projects are carried out at the station regarding geography and biology in general, particular emphasis is placed on meteorology and plant ecology. Many of these projects overlap as the station hosts research into climate change in the region and the resulting changes to plant communities. In recent years, research has included work on permafrost degradation, the importance of winter climate change and tree-line dynamics.

He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from through , most notably as a member of the Cincinnati Reds dynasty that won three National League pennants and two World Series championships between 1972 and 1977. Billingham's 0.36 earned run average over the 1972, 1975 and 1976 World Series was the lowest in World Series history until it was surpassed by Madison Bumgarner in 2014. He also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Houston Astros, Detroit Tigers and the Boston Red Sox. In 1984, Billingham was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. ==Baseball career== Billingham was born in Orlando, Florida and graduated from Winter Park High School in 1961. He believes that he is a distant cousin of Baseball Hall of Fame member Christy Mathewson although, the exact relationship is not known. He was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent on June 12, 1961. He spent seven years in the Dodgers‚Äô minor-league system, where he was groomed as a relief pitcher. Billingham made his major league debut with the Dodgers on April 11, 1968 at the age of 25. He didn't give up a run until his seventh appearance as a relief pitcher for the Dodgers. In his only appearance as a starting pitcher, he shut out the Pirates through eight innings. Billingham finished the season with a 3-0 win-loss record with a 2.14 earned-run average however, the Dodgers left Billingham unprotected and he was selected by the Montreal Expos in the 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft. In January 1969, the Expos traded Donn Clendenon to the Houston Astros for Rusty Staub. Clendenon refused to report, and Billingham was later sent to Houston to complete the trade. In 1969, Billingham was again used as a reliever (52 games, 6‚Äì7 record, 4.25 ERA). In 1970 he was moved into the starting rotation (46 games, 24 starts), before becoming exclusively a starting pitcher in 1971. On November 29, 1971, Billingham was involved in one of the most significant trades in the history of the Cincinnati Reds when he was acquired from the Astros along with Ed Armbrister, Cesar Geronimo, Denis Menke and Joe Morgan. The trade helped to transform the Reds into the into the juggernaut known as the Big Red Machine that would dominate the National League for the next five seasons. Billingham's best season was 1973, going 19-10 with a career-best 3.04 ERA. He led the National League with 40 starts, 293 innings pitched and seven shutouts and earned a berth on the National League All-Star team in the 1973 All-Star Game. He followed that with a 19-11 season in 1974. On April 4, 1974, Billingham gave up Hank Aaron's 714th career home run, which tied Aaron with Babe Ruth for No. 1 on the all-time home run list at the time. Billingham was one of the most effective pitchers in World Series history. In the 1975 World Series, he was the starting pitcher for Cincinnati in their Game 2 victory where, he gave up a first-inning run before holding the Boston Red Sox scoreless for the next four innings. His scoreless streak continued in Game 6 where he appeared as a relief pitcher and allowed one hit in one inning pitched. In the climactic Game 7, Billingham entered the game in the bottom of the fifth inning as a relief pitcher with the Reds trailing the Red Sox by a score of 3-0. He held the Red Sox scoreless for two innings, allowing the Reds to come from behind to take a 4-3 victory and clinch the 1975 World Series championship. In seven games (including three starts) for Cincinnati, he went 2‚Äì0 with a 0.36 ERA, allowing just one earned run in 25 innings pitched. In 1979, he posted a 10-9 record with the Detroit Tigers to finish his tenth consecutive season of ten or more wins. ==Career statistics== In a 13-season major league career, Billingham posted a 145-113 record with 1,141 strikeouts and a 3.83 earned run average in 2,231.1 innings pitched, including 27 shutouts and 74 complete games. He posted a 1.93 earned run average in 42 innings of postseason pitching. ==Awards== * Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame inductee: 1984 * National League All-Star: 1973 * Johnny Vander Meer Award (Reds' Most Outstanding Pitcher): 1973 ==NL leader== * Innings pitched: 1973 (293) * Shutouts: 1973 (7) * Hit batsmen: 1971 (16) and 1977 (10) ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career hit batsmen leaders ==References , or Retrosheet, or SABR Biography Project, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League) Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Albuquerque Dodgers players Category:Arizona Instructional League Dodgers players Category:Baseball players from Florida Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Florida Instructional League Astros players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Minor league baseball coaches Category:National League All-Stars Category:Orlando Dodgers players Category:Orlando Juice players Category:Salisbury Dodgers players Category:Santa Barbara Dodgers players Category:Spokane Indians players Category:Sportspeople from Orlando, Florida Category:St. Petersburg Saints players Category:Baseball coaches from Florida Category:Winter Park High School alumni ","title":"Jack Billingham"},{"id":"6228324","text":"Ask Father is a short, 13-minute, slapstick-style comedy made by Harold Lloyd in 1919 before he got into his classic full-length feature films.

WALLS, The World's Deadliest Snakes, Reptiles (magazine) An antivenom called Echitab-plus-ICP is manufactured by the Costa Rican Instituto Clodomiro Picado and another called EchiTabG is manufactured by MicroPharm Ltd in the UK. ==Taxonomy== Othmar Stemmler described the species in 1970. It was considered a subspecies of the E. carinatus. The specific name, ocellatus, is a reference to the distinctive series of \\"eye- spots\\" (ocelli) which runs the length of the body. Common names include African saw-tailed viper, ocellated carpet viper and West African carpet viper. ==Description and behavior== The maximum total length (body + tail) is , possibly more, while the average total length is . They are characterized by their bulging eyes and short snout, typical of species of the genus Echis. E. ocellatus is terrestrial, nocturnal and crespuscular, it usually goes out to hunt its preys at the first hours of the night, preys like small vertebrates, like mammals, birds, lizards and amphibians, it has already been reported hunting small ivertebrates like centipedes and scorpions.

There are also reports of single specimens found in the Bangui in the Central African Republic, and in central Sudan. It is rarely found north of the 15th parallel, after which E. leucogaster becomes more common. The geographic range of E. ocellatus extends to the coast via the Dahomey Gap, they can mainly be found in savanna and occasionally in wooded areas. ==Reproduction== Sexually mature females lay between 6 and 20 eggs, usually at the end of the dry season in February to March.

He also appeared in the final of the 2017 Slovenian Football Cup, where Olimpija lost 1‚Äì0 to Dom≈æale. ===Vara≈ædin=== On 20 August 2018, Benko signed for the Croatian second tier club Vara≈ædin. On 18 May 2019, he scored two goals in Vara≈ædin's 3‚Äì1 home win against ≈†ibenik, which secured his team a promotion to the Prva HNL. ==International career== Benko has been capped for the Croatian national under-21 team and he subsequently went on to make his debut for the country's A-team by appearing in both of their two matches at the 2006 Carlsberg Cup in Hong Kong. Benko was once again included in the roster for the friendly match against South Korea on 10 September 2013. He provided a crucial assist for Domagoj Vida who scored the first goal in 65th minute of the match. Croatia went on to win the match, being their second match and second win against South Korea side in the year of 2013 alone. His prolific goalscoring form in his club earned him another call-up, this time for the Croatia crucial 2014 World Cup play-off matches against Iceland on 15 November 2013. ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  Continental ! colspan=2  Total - !

It is a supernatural/suspense novel which tells the story of a girl with a psychic gift. ==Plot summary== The protagonist of The Third Eye is eighteen-year-old Karen Connors. While in high school, she began dating Tim, a popular classmate. For the first time, Karen begins to feel as though she is finally fitting in. Her mother is pleased that she is dating Tim, as she has always pushed Karen to fit in and be popular. Karen gets a job as a babysitter for the Zenner family, watching Stephanie and her older brother, Bobby. Bobby leaves to go and play with his friends, but doesn‚Äôt show up at lunchtime. Karen asks nearby families if they had seen him, and when they all reply they haven‚Äôt, she contacts the police. Officer Ronald Wilson arrived to question Karen, and the first thing she notices about him is that he has vivid blue eyes and seems much too young to be a police officer. Wilson does not seem too concerned about the disappearance, saying that Bobby was probably at a friend's house. Karen starts having visions of where Bobby is, seeing he is unconscious and stuck in a box. When Bobby's parents arrive home, Bobby is still missing. The policeman returns to the Zenner home. Karen realizes that the box she saw in her vision is the trunk of a car, and that the car is headed her way. She also realizes that the car she envisions belongs to her boyfriend, Tim. When he arrives to take her home, she confronts Tim, and they find Bobby in the trunk, unconscious, but alive. Afterward, Karen is asked by Officer Wilson if she would be willing to help locate a missing girl named Carla Sanchez. Going against her parents' wishes, Karen agrees to help. Officer Wilson drives Karen to Ms. Sanchez‚Äôs house that afternoon. Alone in Carla's bedroom, Karen picks up various items of clothing and toys in an attempt to receive a vision of Carla. After this approach fails, Karen and Officer Wilson leave the Sanchez residence. While in the car with Officer Wilson, Karen receives psychic messages, leading them to a riverbank. They find a pair of sandals and a bicycle that belong to Carla. Karen feels weak and nauseated. Karen then has a vision of the events that led up to Carla's death. Police later find her body in the river. Among the following events, Tim breaks up with Karen and graduates high school. That summer, Karen is hired at a daycare center. On her way to work one day, a lady pulls over and asks for directions to the daycare center. The woman offers Karen a ride, and Karen agrees. The lady driving the car says she is named Betty Smith. When Betty calls Karen by name, Karen becomes suspicious as she had not introduced herself. Believing Betty has other intentions, Karen tries to escape from the car. The doors are locked. Betty drives her to an apartment where a guy named Joe ties her down and hits her head on a stove, knocking her out. After Joe and Betty leave, Karen is visited by a vision of a little girl that she feels compelled to protect. She cannot save her while she is unconscious, so she forces herself out of her slumber to find that she is bound and gagged in the apartment with nobody to save her. She has almost lost all hope when she sees the little girl again, who points to the smoke alarm. (The little girl still has yet to speak or show her face. She keeps her back turned to Karen, so she can only see her blonde hair.) Karen then uses her feet to start a fire, which triggers the fire alarm, getting the attention of the apartment manager. She then learns that Betty and Joe stole most of the babies at the daycare center. One of these babies was Officer Ron Wilson's nephew. Karen's mother wants her to leave on a vacation to San Francisco, but Karen decides to help Ron locate the missing babies instead. Karen and Ron visit psychic Anne Summers, who had been shot because she was closing in on the kidnappings. Luckily, she held up a bag with a broken meat cleaver in it to slow down the shot, which would have hit her in the heart. Karen knows she is the only one who can help locate the children now. Karen then decides to help Ron, and envisions the children on the way to Colorado. Karen and Ron camp out at the state park, where she discovers she is falling in love with Ron. The next morning, they arrive at the house in which the babies are being held. They find out that Betty and Joe stole the babies to illegally sell them. Ron goes up to the house to try to get a look at the babies when Karen has a vision of a dog guarding the house. Ron was terrified of dogs, so Karen had to go warn him. As she gets to him, the dog attacks, Ron shoots him, and Karen screams. Jed then comes out and shoots Ron in the shoulder. They were taken inside, and Karen tries to keep Ron from losing much blood. Soon, the police come and rescue them both, returning all of the missing babies. Karen‚Äôs mother was the one who alerted the police, after receiving a vision. Karen's mother then tells her how she has always been psychic too, but does not want to be thought of as a freak, so she tried to hide it. She also reveals that she had never been popular and that her first date was with Karen‚Äôs father. She wants Karen to hide it as well and try to find someone to fall in love with her. She also explains that she had seen Karen in visions before she was born, and these visions saved her life twice. Karen then tells her mother that she will find someone who loves and accepts her just as she is, and that she intends to use this gift for the good. ==References== * Duncan, Lois.

She was laid down at Canadian Vickers Ltd., Montreal on 2 October 1942 and launched on 30 April 1943. She was transferred on 12 August 1943 while still under construction from the USN to the RN under the auspices of the lend-lease program. She was commissioned 2 days later into the RN as HMS Lossie and was named after the River Lossie in Moray, Scotland which flows into the Moray Firth at Lossiemouth. ==War service== Lossie saw extensive service on North Atlantic convoy escort missions and also saw service in the Indian Ocean. It was during a patrol mission in the Indian Ocean that the freighter Nellore was sunk on 29 June 1944. Lossie picked up 112 crew from the Nellore the following week near the Chagos Archipelago and landed them at Addu Atoll. { style=\\"border-spacing:0;\\" +Convoy escorts  d0cece;border:0.5pt solid #00000a;padding-top:0cm;padding- bottom:0cm;padding-left:0.199cm;padding-right:0.191cm;\\" Convoy code  d0cece;border:0.5pt solid #00000a;padding- top:0cm;padding-bottom:0cm;padding-left:0.199cm;padding-right:0.191cm;\\" Route  d0cece;border:0.5pt solid #00000a;padding- top:0cm;padding-bottom:0cm;padding-left:0.199cm;padding-right:0.191cm;\\" Convoy departure  d0cece;border:0.5pt solid #00000a;padding-top:0cm;padding-bottom:0cm;padding-left:0.199cm;padding- right:0.191cm;\\" Began escort duty  d0cece;border:0.5pt solid #00000a;padding-top:0cm;padding- bottom:0cm;padding-left:0.199cm;padding-right:0.191cm;\\" Ceased escort duty  d0cece;border:0.5pt solid #00000a;padding- top:0cm;padding-bottom:0cm;padding-left:0.199cm;padding-right:0.191cm;\\" Convoy arrival -

NASA's IV&V; Program was founded under the NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) as a direct result of recommendations made by the National Research Council (NRC) and the Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Since then, NASA's IV&V; Program has experienced growth in personnel, projects, capabilities, and accomplishments. NASA IV&V; efforts have contributed to NASA's improved safety record since the program's inception. Today, Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V;) is an Agency-level function, delegated from OSMA to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and managed by NASA IV&V.; NASA's IV&V; Program's primary business, software IV&V;, is sponsored by OSMA as a software assurance technology. Having been reassigned as GSFC, NASA IV&V; is Code 180 (Center Director's direct report). NASA's IV&V; Program houses approximately 270 employees and leverages the expertise of in-house partners and contractors. Its facilities are located in Fairmont, West Virginia. In the summer, high school and college interns are employed in addition. On February 22, 2019, the facility was renamed to the Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility in honor of Katherine Johnson, an African-American woman who worked as a mathematician at NASA for 35 years and who is featured in the film Hidden Figures. == Affiliations == NASA's IV&V; Program is affiliated with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the Educator Resource Center (ERC), funded through a partnership with Fairmont State University, is part of a nationwide network of training sites at NASA centers and facilities. == Projects == NASA's IV&V; Program is the lead NASA organization for system software IV&V;, and is responsible for the management of all system software IV&V; efforts within the Agency. NASA's IV&V; Program's role is to provide value-added service to the Agency's system software projects, primarily by appropriately performing IV&V; on system software based on the cost, size, complexity, life span, risk, and consequences of failure. === Independent Technical Assessments of NASA Systems === NASA's IV&V; Program also provides independent technical assessments of NASA systems and software processes/products to identify developmental and operational risks. This effort helps to provide assurance that safe and reliable software is being provided to NASA missions and projects as they work toward successful systems and software development. Independent assessments can address any aspect of software engineering and can be applied within any SDLC phase. This capability provides for multiple spot-checking throughout the SDLC and addresses those issues that can jeopardize mission safety and quality. === Simulation-to- Flight 1 (STF-1) === Simulation-to-Flight 1 (STF-1) is West Virginia‚Äôs first CubeSat, or small satellite. It was built under NASA‚Äôs CubeSat Launch Initiative, where potential launch opportunities are provided to select CubeSat proposals from NASA Centers, accredited US educational or non-profit organizations. NASA's main goal in this initiative is to provide CubeSat developers access to a low-cost pathway to conduct research in the areas of science, exploration, technology development, education or operations. JSTAR‚Äôs main goal in this mission is to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the NASA Operational Simulation (NOS) technologies, most notably its development of the NASA Operational Simulation for Small Satellites, or NOS3. JSTAR had a huge outreach opportunity with West Virginia University through the support of NASA IV&V; and West Virginia Space Grants Consortium (WVSGC). By being partnered with JSTAR engineers and scientists, WVU Engineering, Computer Science, and Physics departments got to learn first-hand the rewards and challenges involved in working in any STEM career such as with NASA. More specifically, WVU provided their experimental ideas and worked alongside the JSTAR team to incorporate their scientific instruments into STF-1. Along with offering their professional project management, JSTAR has supported WVU in their scientific development and research. By offering their software resources to this CubeSat, STF-1 has the capability of recording data once it is launched into orbit around Earth‚Äîdata that can be sent directly to WVU for STEM research and the education of future scientists. While community outreach is a huge component of this mission, major benefits for NASA and JSTAR have come of it as well. In the development of these NASA Operational Simulation technologies and their demonstrations in the STF-1 mission, the IV&V; tool-set has been matured to better support current and future NASA missions. For example, these NOS technologies, among them NOS3, have demonstrated significant value in several areas such as: the James Webb Space Telescope, Global Precipitation Measurement, Juno, and Deep Space Climate Observatory in the areas of software development, mission operations/training, verification and validation, test procedure development, and software systems check-out. STF-1 launched into Low Earth orbit on a Rocket Lab Electron rocket on December 16, 2018. As of now, STF-1 is orbiting earth in LEO and operating nominally. The fully assembled STF-1 CubeSat. == Educator Resource Center == Thanks to a grant with Fairmont State University, the Independent Verification and Validation Program Educator Resource Center (ERC) provides resources and training opportunities for approximately 1,000 in-service, pre-service, and informal educators and in West Virginia annually. The materials and training cover a wide range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. The ERC also loans hands-on STEM kits to trained teachers which impact over 10,000 students per year in the state. The on-site student outreach program brings over 2,000 youth to the facility annually to experience workshops on robotics, rocketry, aviation, and other STEM topics. The ERC also runs numerous student STEM competitions in the fields of robotics and aviation. Starting in 2012 the ERC became the partner for the FIRST LEGO League competition and has overseen a rapid growth in robotic competitions that now include over 100 teams at 10 tournaments statewide each fall. == See also == *Verification and validation == References  External links == *Current projects *NASA IV&V; Facility *NASA ERC Network Category:Buildings and structures in Marion County, West Virginia Category:Goddard Space Flight Center Category:Government agencies established in 1993 Independent Verification and Validation Program Category:Space technology research institutes Category:Aerospace research institutes Category:Aviation research institutes ","title":"Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility"},{"id":"6228411","text":"The Constitution of Estonia is the fundamental law of the Republic of Estonia and establishes the state order as that of a democratic republic where the supreme power is vested in its citizens. The first Constitution was adopted by the freely elected Estonian Constituent Assembly on 15 June 1920 and came into force on 21 December 1920. The second Constitution was adopted on 24 January 1934, following a referendum in 1933, and was in force until the third Constitution was enacted on 1 January 1938. It remained in force, de facto, until 16 June 1940, when the Soviet Union occupied Estonia and, de jure, until 28 June 1992, when the fourth and current Constitution of the Republic of Estonia was adopted by referendum. ==HistoryFirst Constitution (1920‚Äì1933)=== The first Constitution was a reflection of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's idea of national sovereignty. Power was split between the judiciary, the executive and the legislature according to the principles of Montesquieu. The Constitution provided for a high degree of public initiative and for referendums. Despite the Constitution being modelled upon Montesquieu's ideas, there was an imbalance in the distribution of power. The document was radically parliamentarian, vesting the single-chamber Riigikogu with extensive power over the executive and the judiciary, leading to instability and frequent changes of government. A State Elder, a post equivalent to that of president, served as both head of state and head of government. ===Second Constitution (1934‚Äì1938)=== Due to chronic government instability (18 governments headed by 10 State Elders), attempts were made to redraft the Constitution. In a referendum held in 1932, voters rejected two proposed drafts of a new Constitution, but a third draft, proposed by the populist Estonian War of Independence Veterans' League or Vaps Movement was adopted in a referendum in 1933 and came into force on 24 January 1934. This second Constitution vested broad powers in the head of state‚Äîstill called the State Elder‚Äîwhile reducing the size and power of the Riigikogu. The State Elder had the power to issue decrees with the force of law. In order to prevent the Vaps Movement coming to power under this new Constitution, Konstantin P√§ts, who was serving as \\"Prime Minister in Duties of the State Elder\\" pending elections, seized power in a bloodless coup d‚Äôetat on 12 March 1934. Believing that the 1934 constitution was too authoritarian, P√§ts pressed for the adoption of a new Constitution. ===Third Constitution (de facto 1938‚Äì1940, de jure 1938‚Äì1992)=== In 1936, a referendum approved the formation of a National Assembly to draft a replacement document. This Constitution, which came into force on 1 January 1938, created a bicameral National Assembly, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the National Council. The National Council, which was to review and ratify legislation from the Chamber of Deputies, consisted of representatives from local government, professional and vocational bodies, and high officials, while the Chamber of Deputies was directly elected by the people. The head of state was given the title of \\"President\\"; he was no longer directly elected by the people, but instead was chosen by an electoral college consisting of both chambers of the National Assembly and additional representatives of local government. The President was vested with fairly broad powers, but was somewhat less powerful than the State Elder of the 1934 constitution. A Soviet-style \\"constitution\\" was introduced illegally, not having been subjected to referendum as required by the third Constitution, by a Soviet-backed puppet government on 25 August 1940. It was based on the 1936 Soviet constitution. The Soviet Estonian 1940 constitution was replaced by another constitution in 1978, based on the 1977 Soviet constitution. ===Fourth Constitution (1992‚Äìpresent)=== The present Constitution was enacted after a referendum on 28 June 1992. It incorporates elements of the Constitutions of 1920 and 1938. While retaining the presidency created in 1938, it restores the unicameral legislature established in 1920. It explicitly asserts its continuity with the Estonian state as it existed between 1920 and 1940, and thus provides a restitutive basis for Estonia‚Äôs independence. Like the 1920 Constitution, the head of state‚Äîtitled as President after some debate about restoring the old title of State Elder‚Äîis a largely ceremonial post. However, like the 1938 Constitution, the government is headed by a separate Prime Minister. ==Composition== The current Constitution contains a preamble and several chapters. The Preamble reads: :\\"With unwavering faith and a steadfast will to strengthen and develop the state, :which is established on the inextinguishable right of the people of Estonia to national self-determination and which was proclaimed on 24 February 1918, :which is founded on liberty, justice and law, :which shall protect internal and external peace, and is a pledge to present and future generations for their social progress and welfare, :which shall guarantee the preservation of the Estonian nation, language and culture through the ages, :the people of Estonia, on the basis of ¬ß 1 of the Constitution which entered into force in 1938, and by a referendum held on 28 June 1992, adopted the following Constitution.\\" Tulemused ‚Äì Tekstid ===Chapters=== The current Constitution contains fifteen chapters. * The first chapter makes general provision for the nature of the state. It contains seven articles. * The second chapter sets out the people's rights, liberties and duties. * Chapter 3 defines the people and citizenship of Estonia. * Chapter 4 deals with the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu). * Chapter 5 pertains to the President of Estonia, and his or her duties, responsibilities and rights. * Chapter 7 addresses the process of legislation. * Chapter 8 addresses financial issues and the budget. * Chapter 9 addresses international relations and treaties. * Chapter 10 addresses military affairs. * Chapter 11 pertains to the function and the role of National Audit Office, and the Auditor General. * Chapter 12 pertains to the rights, functions and appointment of the Chancellor of Justice. * Chapter 13 pertains to the structure and operation of the judicial system and the courts. * Chapter 14 pertains to the jurisdictional, administrative and budgetary aspects of local government in Estonia. * Chapter 15 pertains to mechanisms and procedures related to amending the Constitution. ==Fifteenth anniversary of the fourth Constitution== For the celebrations of the fifteenth anniversary of the current Constitution, A.

He was primarily a central midfielder although his versatility saw him play in most defensive and midfield positions. Duff began his career with Dundee United, going on to make 171 first team appearances in nine years at the club. He later played for Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, before leaving Scotland for spells with Qormi in Malta and Kairat in Kazakhstan. He joined Cove Rangers in 2014, then signed for Inverurie Loco Works in 2017. He is a former Scotland under-21 internationalist, having made ten appearances between 2002 and 2003. ==CareerDundee United=== Having been developed as a player through Dundee United's youth scheme, he turned professional with the club in July 1999. He was given his debut by then- manager Alex Smith in December 2001, when he was used as a right wing back in a match at Kilmarnock, and went on to make nine appearances that season, collecting the April 'Young Player of the Month' award. In 2002‚Äì03, Duff had his best run of league games, playing 34 times. When Ian McCall was appointed at the start of the 2003‚Äì04 season, Duff found himself more often as a substitute, playing in just 18 league games. During that season, Duff was part of the Scotland under-21 side that narrowly missed out on qualifying for the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, with Scotland losing to Croatia in the play-off. The following season, Duff played 25 league games, earning him a new three-year contract in March 2005. Shortly afterwards, Duff was part of the United side that lost narrowly to Celtic in the Scottish Cup final, with his 83rd-minute substitute appearance earning him a runners-up medal. In 2005‚Äì06, with Gordon Chisholm the new manager, Duff played more first team games, with 29 league appearances. During February 2006, Duff alleged he was spat on by Hearts midfielder Rudi Skacel, a claim repeated two months later by Celtic captain Neil Lennon. No action was taken against Skacel in either incident. Duff scored an important goal in the 1‚Äì0 win over Rangers at Ibrox during the season, which helped United avoid relegation. Duff started the 2006‚Äì07 season as an attacking midfielder under Craig Brewster and scored once, although was used in a variety of defensive roles under Craig Levein. ===Aberdeen=== In January 2008, Levein told Duff he was free to leave Tannadice and find himself a new club. He was released on 17 January, after playing 170 games for the club, scoring four times. Duff began training with fellow SPL side Aberdeen and a short-term move to his home town club was confirmed the following day, seeing him become the third player to move from Tannadice to Pittodrie in eighteen months, following Lee Miller and Lee Mair. Within six weeks of arriving, however, Duff was one of several players manager Jimmy Calderwood threatened to release at the end of the season, due to the club's poor performances. In May 2008, Duff instead signed a two-year contract extension with Aberdeen. ===Inverness Caledonian Thistle=== Duff was loaned to Inverness CT for a month in December 2009. After his release by Aberdeen, Duff had a trial spell with St Johnstone and turned down an approach from St Mirren before signing for Inverness CT. Duff agreed a deal that was to run until the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season. Throughout the 2010/11 season he was a regular starter for Caley, and featured in most of their surprising results. These included a 1‚Äì1 draw against Rangers at Ibrox and a 2‚Äì2 draw with Celtic at Parkhead. His contract expired with ICT at the end of the 2010/11 season, and he stated his desire to stay with Inverness and said he would accept their contract offer after returning from holiday. In the summer of 2011, a contract was offered, but no deal was agreed and the contract offer was eventually withdrawn. ===Playing Abroad=== Duff played three games for Ayr United as a trialist in September 2011. In November 2011, Duff agreed to join Qormi, in the Maltese Premier League, for the remainder of the season. ===Kairat=== In February 2012, Duff agreed to join Kazakhstan Premier League side FC Kairat on a lucrative one-year deal and was given the number 21 shirt. Duff scored his first goal for Kairat in their 2‚Äì0 victory over FC Sunkar on 8 April 2012. Kairat finished the season in 10th place.https://int.soccerway.com/national/kazakhstan/premier- league/2012/regular-season/ Duff had his contract extended for another year, keeping him at the club till the end of the 2013 season. Duff left Kairat at the end of the 2013 season, as Kazakhstan Premier League rules state that foreign players over the age of 30 must be playing for their national team in order to play in their league. ===Highland Leaguue=== On 14 October 2014, Duff signed a short-term deal with Highland Football League side Cove Rangers.

It has a Renaissance castle and is mentioned in the letters that Madame de S√©vign√© wrote to her daughter, Madame de Grignan, in the 17th century. ==Geography== Grignan is located in the south of the Dr√¥me department, near the border of the neighbouring Vaucluse department, and close to Mont Ventoux, the highest mountain in Provence. To visit Grignan, take the A7 autoroute and use either exit #18, Mont√©limar Sud, or #19, Boll√®ne. ===Agriculture=== Market in Grignan The main crops produced in the area are lavender, truffles, wheat, and sunflowers. Nearby is the village of Nyons, world-famous for its olives. ==History== View of Grignan Statue of Madame de S√©vign√© in Grignan Several archeological excavations have shown that the rocky promontory of Grignan has been occupied since the Iron Age. There is evidence of a former Bronze Age society here, as well as Roman occupation in the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Historians have noted that in the year 1035, a cartulaire (a ledger of church or monastery property titles) from the Abbey of Saint-Chaffre in the Haute-Loire, makes mention of an obscure castellum Gradignanum. Over the next century, the name steadily evolved to become the castrum Grainan (1105), then Graigna, Grazinam ... We know very little about the birth of the castle or those who built it. The existence of a certain Christophe de Grignan has been established some time around the year 1030, and in 1035, the cartulaire of Saint-Chaffre, speaks of a 'Rostaing du ch√¢teau de Grignan,' Rostagnus de castello Gradignano. A century later, according to various documents, the Grignan family appears to have become well established. It is precisely during this time that the Grignans seem to have lost the ownership of the castle which bears their name. Beginning in 1239, the records show that Grignan ceased to belong to the Grignans ... but to the Adh√©mar de Monteil family. The expansion of the castle coincided with the rise in power of the Adh√©mars of Grignan. The Adh√©mars were up-and-coming so their castle necessarily had to follow. Beginning in the 13th century, the Adh√©mars rose from Barons to Dukes, finally being elevated to the rank of Counts by Henry II, King of France. Grignan Castle progressively became an imposing stronghold. The Adh√©mar family line ended when Louis Adh√©mar died without an heir in 1559. The titles and possessions of Louis Adh√©mar, Count of Grignan, fell upon his nephew Gaspard de Castellane, son of Louis' sister Blanche Adh√©mar. Although the Adh√©mars were an illustrious family, in terms of sheer glory they were rivalled by the Castellane clan. The castle was eventually inherited by Fran√ßois de Castellane-Ornano-Adh√©mar de Monteil de Grignan, who carried among his titles the Duke of Termoli, Count of Grignan, Count of Campobasso, and the Baron of Entrecasteaux, as well as a knight in the service of King Louis XIV. He was governor general of Provence, and through the Dutch of their c√≠ty of Orange. Fran√ßois, the last Count of Grignan, was two-times a widower (his wives Ang√©lique-Clarisse d'Angiennes, daughter of the Marquis de Rambouillet, and Marie-Ang√©lique du Puy-du-Fou having died in quick succession). For his third marriage, he chose a certain Fran√ßoise-Marguerite de S√©vign√©, daughter of the marquise of the same name whose illustrious letters have perpetuated the memory of her son-in-law‚Äîand his castle to this very day. Madame de S√©vign√© travelled three times to Provence (that is to say, Aix and Grignan) in order to spend time with her daughter and son-in-law: a 14-month stay beginning in 1672; another 14-month stay beginning in 1690 taken before a quick trip to Brittany; and a third stay of 22 months leading right up to her death in 1696. In other words, Madame de S√©vign√© spent only a little less than four years total in the part of France which occupied so much space in her heart and letters. ==PopulationSights== Ch√¢teau de Grignan Louis Adhemar, governor of Provence, remodelled the medieval castle from 1545 to 1558. From 1668 to 1690, Fran√ßois de Castellane-Adhemar turned it into a sumptuous Renaissance palace. Construction on the site of Grignan's present castle was originally begun in the 12th century, but it wasn't until the 13th century that the Adh√©mar family expanded it into a mighty fortress. In the 17th century, Fran√ßois Adh√©mar de Monteil transformed the fortress into a luxurious residence. Reduced to ruins in 1793, it was reconstructed in the early 20th century by Madame Fontaine who spent her entire fortune to restore the castle to its former grandeur. Presently, the castle belongs to the Dr√¥me ' and is a major tourist attraction. ===Collegiate Church of the Holy Saviour=== Coll√©giale Saint-Sauveur Located under the castle terrace, the collegiate church was constructed between 1535 and 1539 at the request of Louis Adh√©mar. The Renaissance fa√ßade is flanked by two square towers and a Gothic rose window. Inside is a 17th-century altar and organ loft. On the floor in front of the altar is a marble funerary stone marking the sealed entrance to the tomb of Madame de S√©vign√©. ===Rochecourbi√®re Cave=== Located about a half kilometre from Grignan, this shallow, natural cave sheltered from the Proven√ßal sun, was a favourite writing spot of Madame de S√©vign√©. ==Notable people== * Morton Beiser (born 1936), member of the Order of Canada * Roger Duch√™ne (1930‚Äì2006), biographer specializing in the letters of Madame de S√©vign√© * Bruno Durieux (born 1944), mayor of Grignan * S√©rgio Ferro (born 1938), Brazilian painter, architect, and professor * J.

He won the Scottish Cup with Dundee United in 2010 and represented the Scotland under-21 team. Robertson retired from football in January 2017, after a civil case determined that he and David Goodwillie had committed an act of rape. ==CareerDundee United=== Livingston-born Robertson joined Dundee United as a youth player and was the top scorer in the 2004‚Äì05 SPL Youth League, despite playing from midfield. Robertson made his debut for United in January 2006, in the 1‚Äì1 draw against Aberdeen, when he came off the bench in the last few minutes to replace player/manager Craig Brewster who was injured while making his second debut. Robertson scored his first goal three months later in 3‚Äì1 league defeat to Livingston, and his late extra-time winner sent United through to the Scottish League Cup third round at the start of the following season. Further league goals came against Inverness Caledonian Thistle (twice) and Celtic, with a cup strike against St Mirren ensuring that Robertson's goals in 2006‚Äì07 saw him never finish on the losing side. Indeed, Robertson's form saw him sign a new two-year contract during February of that season. In September 2007, Robertson won his first Scotland under-21 cap and later that season came on as an extra-time substitute in the 2008 Scottish League Cup Final against Rangers, missing one of United's penalties in the defeat. In January 2009, Robertson signed a further extension to his contract, committing himself to the club until May 2011. On 24 March 2010, Robertson scored a vital last minute winner against Rangers in the quarter-final of the Scottish Cup, which Dundee United went on to win for only the second time in their 100-year history. In the 2010 Scottish Cup Final Robertson played as a substitute. ===St Johnstone=== Despite being offered a new contract by United in 2011, Robertson opted instead to sign for St Johnstone. Robertson made his debut for St Johnstone in a league game against Aberdeen on 23 July 2011. On 28 November 2012, Robertson was injured during St Johnstone's match against Hibernian and the following day, it was confirmed by the club's manager Steve Lomas that Robertson had broken his leg. On 13 December 2013, St Johnstone announced that Robertson would not be given a new contract when his current deal expired. In December 2013, Robertson went on trial at Greenock Morton. ===Greenock Morton=== On 3 January 2014, Robertson signed for Greenock Morton. Robertson's father Dougie played almost 200 games for Morton between 1983 and 1990. ===Livingston & Ayr United=== In the summer of 2014 Robertson left Morton to sign for Livingston. He scored on his competitive debut for the club, coming on in the 112th minute against Queen of the South and scoring just minutes later to secure the extra-time victory. After seven months with Livingston, Robertson transferred to Scottish League One side Ayr United on a short term deal. At the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Robertson was released by The Honest Men. ===Selkirk & Cowdenbeath=== On 18 December 2015, Robertson signed for Lowland League club Selkirk.https://www.facebook.com/selkirkfootballclub/?fref=nf After six months with Selkirk, Robertson returned to the SPFL, signing for Scottish League Two side Cowdenbeath in June 2016. Robertson retired from football in January 2017, after a judge ruled that he had raped a woman. ==Personal life== Robertson and David Goodwillie, who was then a teammate of Robertson at Dundee United, were accused of committing rape against Denise Clair in January 2011. Goodwillie was charged with rape, but the Scottish legal authorities decided not pursue a criminal prosecution. Ms Clair then took a civil action against Robertson and Goodwillie. On 17 January 2017, Robertson and Goodwillie were ruled to be rapists and ordered to pay ¬£100,000 in compensation. The civil case was judged on the balance of probabilities and did not need corroboration of evidence, unlike in a Scottish criminal case. Robertson's club, Cowdenbeath, issued a statement indicating that he would not be considered for selection until further information had been received and considered. Robertson subsequently announced his retirement from football. In November 2017, three appeal judges at the Court of Session upheld the ruling. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !! colspan=\\"2\\"League !! colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !! colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !! colspan=\\"2\\"Other !! colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !

Previously, he drove for the HSV Dealer Team with whom he won the Bathurst 1000 alongside Greg Murphy in 2003 and 2004. In 2006, Kelly extended his success by winning the V8 Supercar Championship for the HSV Dealer Team. His older brother Todd Kelly was also a racing driver who won the Bathurst 1000 in 2005. His parents John and Margaret Kelly formed Kelly Racing in 2009 with Rick and Todd Kelly as lead drivers, expanding to a 4 car operation. ==2006 Supercar Championship== In 2006, Kelly won the Australian V8 Supercar Championship Series after being one of the most consistent performers throughout the season. The victory, however, was not without its share of controversy. Despite not winning a single round overall (though he did win an individual race), or scoring a pole position in any individual race, Kelly entered the final round of the series at Phillip Island seven points ahead of his nearest competitor, Craig Lowndes, (who had won four rounds) due to consistent high points finishes in all twelve of the previous 2006 rounds. Coming into the third and final race of the round, Lowndes had managed to pull back the deficit to be even on points with Kelly, meaning that the driver out of the two who finished first would clinch the championship. Two laps into the final race, Kelly collided with Lowndes, who then slid into Todd Kelly. Damage to Lowndes car resulted in him finishing 29th, whereas Rick Kelly finished 18th and was awarded the series title despite not having won a single round.McKay, Peter (11 December 2006) Kelly emerges in dramatic finaleStanford, James (11 December 2006); Stewards reject Lowndes' appeal; The Herald Sun ==Charitable work== Kelly has joined other publicly known figures in support of the \\"Oscar's Law\\" campaign, a protest against the factory farming of companion animals. The campaign is named after a neglected dog found in central Victoria, Australia, and was launched in 2010. The list of supporters includes Kate Ceberano (singer), Jon Stevens (singer) and Sia (musician). Kelly not only appears on the campaign's website, but he has also promoted the campaign on his Twitter account.

Located 34 kilometres north-east of the Queensland city of Mackay, Keswick Island is part of the Cumberland Islands of islands that lay protected inside the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The island is inhabited by a small number of residents. It is a semi-popular tourist destination set to expand with planned development. Visitors can stay in a small number of catered and self-catered accommodation. The island has its own airstrip and is accessible from Mackay Airport by a short plane flight or by private boat. ==Origin of the name== Identified as part of the Cumberland Isles Group by Captain James Cook in 1770. Keswick Island and neighbouring St Bees Island were first designated together as ‚ÄòL1 Island‚Äô by Lieutenant Matthew Flinders, RN, in HMS Investigator in 1802. Keswick Island was later individually named in 1879 after the town of Keswick in England's Cumbria Lake District by Staff Commander E. P. Bedwell, RN, in SS Llewellyn. ==Environs== Keswick Island is approximately 530 hectares (1300 acres) in area, with the majority being national park. It is part of the pristine Cumberland Group of islands that consists of St Bees Island, Keswick Island, Aspatria Island, Scawfell Island, Calder Island, Wigton Island and Cockermouth Island. The island is near to the South Cumberland Islands National Park. Neighbouring islands in the Cumberland Group are accessible by private boat. The nearest developed neighbouring island is Brampton Island some 7 km to the north. Keswick Island is separated from its nearest neighbour, St Bees Island by only a few hundred metres by the Egremont Passage. The eucalypt woodlands of St Bees Island are occupied by a healthy koala colony currently being researched by Queensland universities to examine their equilibrium with their environment. Ergmont Passage and St Bees Island The island is located 360 km north of the Tropic of Capricorn. Temperatures vary from 17 ¬∞C to 24 ¬∞C in winter (water temperature is a steady 20 ¬∞C), and 24 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C in summer (water temperature is a steady 26 ¬∞C). ==Development== The overall land development lease area, which is situated in the north-eastern and eastern area of the Island, totals around 117 hectares and occupies over 4¬Ω km of ocean front land. Resort complexes and residential housing capable of supporting a tourist and residential community are expected to be developed at some stage. The island already has some existing infrastructure such as an airstrip, sealed roads, communications services, and various utilities. The development company changed hands in 2002, and again in March 2008 to Keswick Developments Pty Ltd. Located in a World Heritage Site and being within the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park requires that building and construction is governed by environmental guidelines, detailed architectural and design codes to facilitate an eco-friendly development. thumb Development in the Whitsunday Islands is limited. Keswick Islands still remains relatively undeveloped. The island is inhabited by a small number of private residents and visitors. With more than 100 sub-leased land lots already established on ninety-nine year leasehold (through to the year 2096), the numbers of residents and tourism should be expected to grow significantly with any planned development. ==Activities== Visitors can undertake activities such as swimming, snorkeling, diving, fishing, beachcombing and bushwalking. Narrow walking tracks in the National Park wind through pockets of tropical rainforest to its beaches. The island is fringed by colourful coral reefs and abundant marine life which provides favourable conditions for diving or snorkeling at mid-low tide. Three wrecks sites, including the protected historic wreck sites of The Singapore (a two master sail and steam vessel) and The Llewellyn (a former coastal steamer) are accessible from the island within a few minutes by boat. Whales can be frequently seen around the island during their annual migration through the Whitsundays between July and September. ==Transport== The closest transport hub is the city of Mackay. The island has its own sealed airstrip and is accessible from the old side of Mackay Airport on a short 10-minute flight with Keswick Development Pty Ltd's charter airline. It is also accessible from Mackay Harbour via chartered or private boat. Moorings are available. Transport around the island is restricted to electric and petrol golf buggies. ==Accommodation== Self-catered holiday homes are available for short-term rental. ===Sale=== While most of the island is designated as National Park, the islands head-lease (117 hectares) was sold to a Sydney property consortium in January 2008.Sydney group to develop pristine Keswick Island. Michelle Hele. 2 April 2008. Planned developments are said to include villas, condominiums, cafes and shops.Sale gives Keswick Island new lease of life . 3 April 2008. Work on a deep-water jetty and improved barge ramps is expected to commence in the future to improve access to the island. The new owners plan to develop the islands residential and eco-tourism potential in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. ==Gallery== Image:KeswickIsland AwsomeBlue 01 small.jpgResidential Precinct Image:KeswickIsland ConnieBay 01 small.jpgConnie Bay Image:KeswickIsland BasilBay 02 small.jpgBasil Bay Image:KeswickIsland_BasilBay03.jpgBasil Bay Image:KeswickIsland_AwsomeBlue_Residential_01.jpgResidential Precinct ==See also== * List of islands of Australia ==References== Category:Islands of Queensland Category:Whitsunday Islands ","title":"Keswick Island"},{"id":"6228558","text":"WYMX (99.1 FM) is a classic hits formatted radio station licensed to Greenwood, Mississippi, United States.

He is known for his ability to save penalties and his accurate goal kicks. == Club career  Kaizer Chiefs === Following a great season with The Students, Fern√°ndez was signed by Kaizer Chiefs from Wits University in 2001 along with midfielder Stanton Fredericks. Fern√°ndez was to be an understudy to Brian Baloyi, who was on the verge of landing a lucrative contract in Europe. Fern√°ndez initially struggled to break into the first team, as Baloyi put up solid performances week in and week out. The big break finally came, when he made his debut in the Vodacom Challenge against Ghanaian side Hearts of Oak at Royal Bafokeng Stadium on 30 June 2001. Chiefs won the game 2‚Äì0. He made his PSL debut for Chiefs in a 2‚Äì1 win against Classic on 22 August 2001. \\"Spider\\", as he is known due to his amazing love for creepy crawlies (snakes and spiders), was hospitalised in April 2003 after he was bitten by one of his spiders. He had also battled to command a first team place in the same season and only got a run in the 5‚Äì0 ABSA Cup first round victory against Sporting at Ellis Park. However, the 2003‚Äì04 season started off very well for Fern√°ndez who was handed the number one jersey as Baloyi struggled with a niggling injury. The former national under-23 star began his playing career at Benoni amateur side Benoni Northerns before joining Wits where he caught the eye of the under-23 selectors. He has six under-23 caps. During the 2006‚Äì07 season he scored two goals. He kicked his way into the history books in February 2007 when he pounced on the rebound, after Brian Baloyi of Mamelodi Sundowns could only parry his retaken spot kick and knocked the ball home from close range. The fact that Rowen had missed the kick and scored on the rebound meant that his thirty second-minute equaliser against Sundowns was not classified as a penalty, but instead it was recorded as a goal scored from open play. The other goal resulted from a spot kick in a match against his former club Wits in September 2006. === Arminia Bielefeld === Fern√°ndez joined German Bundesliga side Arminia Bielefeld in June 2007 on a free transfer after being out of contract with Chiefs to team up with former Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp who then coached Arminia. Fern√°ndez lost his place as first choice goalkeeper to Dennis Eilhoff after injury. On 1 January 2011, during the January transfer window, Fern√°ndez left Arminia Bielefeld for SuperSport United. ==International career== He made his full international debut in a 2‚Äì0 win against Tunisia in August 2004. He had hoped to be a part of his country's squad at the 2010 FIFA World Cup to be held in South Africa, but was omitted from the final 23 by coach Carlos Alberto Parreira in favour of Itumeleng Khune, Moeneeb Josephs and Shu-Aib Walters. ==References* Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:South African soccer players Category:South Africa international soccer players Category:South African expatriate soccer players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Association football goalkeepers who have scored Category:SuperSport United F.C. players Category:Arminia Bielefeld players Category:Kaizer Chiefs F.C. players Category:Bidvest Wits F.C. players Category:Bundesliga players Category:2.

One of his neighbors was Pittsburgh Penguins general manager Jack Riley, who would provide tickets for the poorly attended games. Steigerwald developed an interest in hockey and played at the club level while attending Kent State University. After graduating, Steigerwald would start his broadcast career with the Johnstown Red Wings of the Eastern Hockey League. WJNL, the local radio affiliate of the Johnstown Red Wings paid Steigerwald $110 a week to provide commentary for all 70 games that season. With a 24-45-1 and a failing economy within the Johnstown area, the Johnstown Red Wings ceased operations in 1980. The Eastern Hockey League later folded the following year. Steigerwald was the radio play-by-play announcer for the Altoona Curve, the AA affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, from 2005 to 2007. ==Pittsburgh Penguins== The Penguins hired Steigerwald as their marketing director at age 25, and he became their radio color analyst in 1985. FSN Pittsburgh (now AT&T; SportsNet Pittsburgh) hired him on 29 June 2006, as its TV play-by-play announcer after it declined to renew the contract of fellow Penguins broadcaster Mike Lange, who was later hired by the team exclusively as its radio play-by-play announcer. On 18 August 2011, Steigerwald and color analyst Bob Errey were re-signed by Root Sports to multi-year contracts. During a Penguins/Capitals game on 19 March 2013; two fans were spotted with a large picture of Steigerwald on a stick. Bob Errey referred to the prop as \\"Steigy on a Stick,\\" which became an instant viral hit with Penguins fans. On 16 May 2017, Root Sports and the Pittsburgh Penguins announced that, starting in the 2017-18 hockey season, Steigerwald would transition to the Penguins' front office in a new role with the communications and marketing department. Steve Mears, an NHL Network broadcaster and former radio play-by-play voice of the New York Islanders, replaced Paul Steigerwald as the network's TV play-by- play broadcaster for Penguins games. ==Cameo== Steigerwald appeared in the Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie Sudden Death. Playing himself alongside Mike Lange, he provided commentary for a hockey game during which Van Damme's character fought off terrorists; his part climaxed with him exclaiming \\"holy shit!\\" when the scoreboard above the arena was damaged. ==Personal== He is the brother of fellow Pittsburgh sports media member, John Steigerwald, former Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter and Pittsburgh Tribune-Review libertarian columnist Bill Steigerwald, and blues rock guitarist Danny Stag.

He has played for Heart of Midlothian, Leicester City, Livingston, Queen of the South, Raith Rovers, Formartine United, Airdrieonians and Bonnyrigg Rose. ==Career== Hamill had a spell as a teenager playing for East Stirlingshire Boys Club until he joined the youth development scheme at Hearts, graduating from there to the youth academy in 2000. Known as a hard working and tricky winger, he was promoted in April 2002 to the first team squad after major roles in the Under-18s and Under-21s. He was featured in the side that won Youth League championship in season 2000‚Äì01. Hamill was on the fringes of the first team squad in season 2002‚Äì03, however during the following season he started to play more games for the first team, making 20 competitive appearances. He also obtained a massive confidence boost when, in May 2004, he scored the only goal in a SPL match against Rangers at Ibrox. During the 2004‚Äì2005 season, Hamill gained competitive European experience by playing during the Tynecastle outfit's UEFA Cup campaign. He also scored the winner in the Edinburgh derby against Hibernian on 24 October 2004. In August 2005, Hamill was signed by his former Hearts boss Craig Levein for Leicester City in the English Championship, joining former Jambo teammates Mark de Vries, Alan Maybury and Patrick Kisnorbo. He scored his first goal for the club after 37 minutes of his debut in a League Cup defeat of Bury and made his league debut a week later, coming off the bench in the 1‚Äì1 draw away to Hull City. On 28 July 2006, it was announced that Hamill had parted ways with Leicester City after just 11 months at the club, having his contract terminated by mutual consent. His then manager Rob Kelly, who had replaced Levein in early 2006, said that Hamill had left the club to seek first team football elsewhere. He also said Hamill was a smashing lad and never caused an ounce of trouble at the club. On 2 August 2006, he joined Scottish First Division club Livingston on a free transfer. On 29 January 2010, Dumfries club Queen of the South confirmed that Hamill had signed on loan with Steve Tosh moving in the opposite direction. After returning to Livingston, Hamill went out on loan again, this time to Swedish club √ñstersunds FK on a six-month deal. Upon his return to Livingston, Hamill was involved in the squad as the club won the Second Division title.

Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98 (2001), held that when a government operates a \\"limited public forum,\\" it may not discriminate against speech that takes place within that forum on the basis of the viewpoint it expresses‚Äîin this case, against religious speech engaged in by an evangelical Christian club for children.. ==Facts== Under New York law, public schools may adopt regulations under which they open their facilities to public use during non-school hours. In 1992, Milford Central -School adopted regulations under this law, allowing district residents to use the school for \\"instruction in any branch of education, learning, or the arts,\\" and making the school available for \\"social, civic, and recreational meetings and entertainment events, and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that such uses shall be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general public.\\" The Fourniers, who reside in the district, applied to use the Milford Central School for meetings of a Good News Club. Their proposed use‚Äîto have \\"a fun time of singing songs, hearing a Bible lesson and memorizing scripture\\"‚Äîwas deemed to be the equivalent of religious worship, and the Fourniers' application was denied on that basis; the school also claimed that its community use policy forbade use \\"by any individual or organization for religious purposes.\\" The Fourniers contacted the school superintendent stating that they did not believe it was lawful for the school to allow other groups to use the school building, yet because they were religious in nature, teaching morals and values from a Christian perspective, they were denied access. The school concluded that \\"the kinds of activities proposed to be engaged in by the Good News Club were not a discussion of secular subjects such as child rearing, development of character and development of morals from a religious perspective, but were in fact the equivalent of religious instruction itself.\\" The full school board rejected the club's application to use Milford's facilities. The Fourniers and the Good News Club filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983 against the school. The club alleged that the school's denial of its application violated its free speech rights under the First Amendment, as well as its right to religious freedom under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The club won a preliminary injunction allowing it to conduct its meetings at the school from April 1997 to August 1998. In August 1998, however, the district court ruled against the club, finding that the club's \\"subject matter is decidedly religious in nature, and not merely a discussion of secular matters from a religious perspective that is otherwise permitted\\" by the school. Because the school forbade all religious instruction under its policy, the court ruled that it was not engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. The club appealed to the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the school's restriction was not unreasonable. In light of the \\"quintessentially religious\\" nature of the club's activities, the court further held that the school district was engaging in \\"constitutional subject discrimination\\" rather than \\"unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination\\" when it excluded the club from meeting on its premises. In light of a split among the federal appeals courts regarding whether speech may be excluded from a limited public forum by reason of its religious content, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the Second Circuit's ruling in this case. Thomas Marcelle represented the Good News Club at oral argument, and Frank Miller represented Milford Central School. ==Majority opinion== When the government establishes a \\"limited public forum,\\" it is not required to permit any and all speech within that forum. It may \\"reserve its forum for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics\\". However, the government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint, and any restriction it imposes must be reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum. The Court saw no distinction between the viewpoint discrimination in this case and the viewpoint discrimination in two of its earlier cases: Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District, ,. and Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, .. In Lamb's Chapel, the Court held that a school district violated the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause when it excluded a private group from presenting films at the school solely on the basis of the religious perspective of the films on family values. And in Rosenberger, the Court held that a university's refusal to fund a student publication because of that publication's religious perspective violated the Free Speech Clause. Milford's exclusion is indistinguishable from the exclusions at issue in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger, and so the Court did not need to decide \\"whether it is unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum.\\" \\"Milford has opened its limited public forum to activities that serve a variety of purposes, including events pertaining to the welfare of the community.\\" Milford had asserted before the Second Circuit that it would have allowed a public group to use Aesop's fables to impart moral values to children. Milford also allowed the Boy Scouts to \\"influence a boy's character, development, and spiritual growth\\". Likewise, the Good News Club also sought to teach moral values to children, albeit from an explicitly Christian viewpoint. According to the majority, the Court's prior decisions in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger determined the outcome of the Good News Club's free speech claim. In Lamb's Chapel, the Court had ruled that a different New York public school had engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination when it forbade a religious group from using its facilities to show films that taught \\"family values from a Christian perspective\\". It saw no difference between the films that the religious group in Lamb's Chapel proposed to show and the songs and lessons the Good News Club used in this case. And in Rosenberger, the fact that a state university subsidized the publication of some student newspapers but refused to subsidize a student newspaper with a religious viewpoint was also unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. In spite of these decisions, the Second Circuit had ruled in this case that the religious nature of the Good News Club's message meant that it \\"fell outside the bounds of\\" speech related to \\"pure moral and character development\\", and hence was not entitled to First Amendment protection. The majority on the Supreme Court \\"disagreed that something that is 'quintessentially religious' or 'decidedly religious in nature' cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. What matters for purposes of the Free Speech Clause is that we can see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons.\\" Instruction related to morals and values from a religious perspective does not somehow \\"taint\\" that instruction so as to alter the viewpoint such instruction takes. Accordingly, Milford's exclusion of the Good News Club constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. ===The Establishment Clause claim=== Milford also argued that its interest in not violating the Establishment Clause justified its excluding the Good News Club from its facilities. In Widmar v. Vincent, , the Court held that \\"a state interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation may be characterized as compelling, and therefore may justify content-based discrimination\\" on the part of the state entity.. But in Lamb's Chapel, the Court left open the question of whether such a concern could also justify viewpoint discrimination. The Court ruled that it could not, and gave four reasons for distinguishing content-based discrimination from viewpoint discrimination on this score. First, the exception created in Widmar rested on the fact that the government program was neutral toward religion. \\"The Good News Club seeks nothing more than to be treated neutrally and given access to speak about the same topics as are other groups.\\" Milford's policy was not neutral with respect to religious speech‚Äîit allowed some speech that took a particular viewpoint, but forbade speech that took the same viewpoint on the basis of the religious nature of the speech. Second, to the extent the Club's speech would be perceived as coercive, that coercion would be felt by the parents rather than the children. After all, parents must give their children permission to attend the Club's activities. Milford did not suggest that the parents would be confused about the religious nature of the Club's message. Third, and relatedly, the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence never \\"extended ... to foreclose private religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present.\\" In Lee v. Weisman, , the religious speech involved was a prayer at a mandatory high school graduation function.. In Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, , the religious speech involved was a student-led prayer before a high school football game which, of course, is a school-sponsored event.. In Edwards v. Aguillard, , the religious speech involved was a prohibition on teaching evolution in public school science classes.. Unlike these three cases, the religious speech at issue in this case took place after school and not during a school-sponsored event. Fourth, the children required their parents permission to attend the Club's activities; they were not permitted to \\"loiter outside classrooms after the schoolday has ended\\". The Club was using space on the school grounds into which elementary school children did not typically venture during school hours, and elementary school students of all grade levels attended the Club's activities. The instructors are not schoolteachers. The Court doubted that even small children would perceive that the school was endorsing religion in these circumstances, and that doubt was even more attenuated by the fact that the children were just as likely to perceive official condemnation of religion from the school's excluding the Club from its facilities. All these considerations suggested that there was no Establishment Clause violation involved in Milford's permitting the Club to meet on its premises after school hours. Accordingly, Milford's fear of an Establishment Clause violation did not justify forbidding the Club from using its facilities. ===Scalia's concurring opinion=== Justice Scalia concurred in the Court's opinion, but wrote separately to express his own views. He did not believe that the Club's activities were coercive at all. \\"As to endorsement, I have previously written that religious expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause where it (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a traditional or designated public forum, publicly announced and open to all on equal terms. The same is true of private speech that occurs in a limited public forum, publicly announced, whose boundaries are not drawn in favor of religious groups but instead permit a cross-section of uses.\\" Milford could not justify excluding the Club simply because its speech was religious in nature, and so Scalia did not worry whether the discrimination was content- based or viewpoint-based. In any event, Scalia stressed that Milford was engaging in viewpoint discrimination. ===Breyer's concurring opinion=== Justice Breyer disputed the majority's assumption that the perception of the children was irrelevant. Even in Lamb's Chapel, the Court had relied in part on the perception of the children in determining whether there had been an Establishment Clause violation. \\"The critical Establishment Clause question here may well prove to be whether a child, participating in the Good News Club's activities, could reasonably perceive the endorsement of religion\\" on the part of the school. Breyer pointed out that the Court's decision merely overturned a grant of summary judgment in favor of Milford, and denying summary judgment to one party was not the same as granting it to the other party. Denials of summary judgment simply mean that there are \\"genuine issues of material fact\\" that require a trial. The extent of the coercion perceived by the children was, in Breyer's view, one such issue. ==Dissenting opinions== For Justice Stevens, speech that embodied a religious purpose fell into three categories. One category included speech that approached a particular topic from a religious perspective. Another category included speech that \\"amounts to worship, or its equivalent.\\" Between these two categories, Stevens posited a third category‚Äîreligious proselytizing. This case, then, involved a government entity attempting to open its facilities to allow the first category of religious speech on its property but not the other two categories. > Distinguishing speech from a religious viewpoint, on the one hand, from > religious proselytizing, on the other, is comparable to distinguishing > meetings to discuss political issues from meetings whose principal purpose > is to recruit new members to join a political organization. If a school > decides to authorize afterschool discussions of current events in its > classrooms, it may not exclude people from expressing their views simply > because it dislikes their particular political opinions. But must it > therefore allow organized political groups‚Äîfor example, the Democratic > Party, the Libertarian Party, or the Ku Klux Klan‚Äîto hold meetings, the > principal purpose of which is not to discuss the current-events topic from > their own unique point of view but rather to recruit others to join their > respective groups? I think not. Such recruiting meetings may introduce > divisiveness and tend to separate young children into cliques that undermine > the school's educational mission. School officials may reasonably believe > that evangelical meetings designed to convert children to a particular > religious faith may pose the same risk. Even if the Club's speech was not properly classified as religious worship, it certainly was religious proselytism, and the school was within its rights to exclude the Club from campus. Justice Souter was more direct. > It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the public school > premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, > Christian point of view, but for an evangelical service of worship calling > children to commit themselves in an act of Christian conversion. The > majority avoids this reality only by resorting to the bland and general > characterization of Good News's activity as 'teaching of morals and > character, from a religious standpoint'. If the majority's statement ignores > reality, as it surely does, then today's holding may be understood only in > equally generic terms. Otherwise, indeed, this case would stand for the > remarkable proposition that any public school opened for civic meetings must > be opened for use as a church, synagogue, or mosque. Souter also disputed that it was proper for the Court to reach the Establishment Clause claim. Neither the district court nor the Second Circuit had based their rulings on the Establishment Clause, because they had found no First Amendment violation stemming from Milford's actions. Consequently, the facts relating to the Establishment Clause claim were not as well developed as they otherwise might have been. Furthermore, Souter disagreed that this case was so similar to Widmar and Lamb's Chapel as the majority claimed. Widmar involved a university student group, one of over a hundred on campus, that used university space for religious worship. In that case, Souter pointed out, the risk of the university being seen as endorsing the worship was low in light of the number of student groups on campus and the level of maturity of the students. The film in Lamb's Chapel was open to the general public and aimed at adults, not children, and the school facilities had been used by a wide variety of private organizations, just as there were a large number of student groups in Widmar. The Good News Club, by contrast, began setting up its meetings almost half an hour before the school day ended and in a classroom adjacent to the third- and fourth-grade classroom, so that those students, at least, would see the Club every time it came to campus. In view of the state of the record, the \\"facts we know (or think we know) point away from the majority's conclusion, and while the consolation may be that nothing really gets resolved when the judicial process is so truncated, that is not much to recommend today's result.\\" ==See also== * List of United States Supreme Court cases * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 533 * Support Our Scouts Act (2005) ==ReferencesAmicus brief of the ACLU * Transcript of symposium held by Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life * Good News Clubs * Milford Central School * The Good News Club: The Christian Right's Stealth Assault on America's Children by Katherine Stewart Category:Establishment Clause case law Category:United States Free Speech Clause case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:2001 in United States case law Category:2001 in religion Category:Education in Otsego County, New York Category:2001 in education Category:Alliance Defending Freedom litigation ","title":"Good News Club v.

He was formerly the host of the nationally syndicated, public radio call-in program On Point, from which he was dismissed after an investigation concluded he had created a hostile work environment. Prior to working with On Point, he was a foreign correspondent in Asia, and foreign editor of The Boston Globe. He currently hosts a podcast, Tom Ashbrook-Conversations. ==Early life and education== Born in 1956 on a farm in Bloomington, Illinois, he studied American history at Yale University and Gandhi's independence movement at Andhra University in India. ==Early career== Ashbrook worked in Alaska as a surveyor and dynamiter of oil fields to help pay for college. After leaving for Asia, he produced English-dubbed kung fu films in Hong Kong where he spent a decade as a foreign correspondent in India, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. His first newspaper job was at the South China Morning Post. During the late 1980s Ashbrook became foreign editor for The Boston Globe. As a correspondent Ashbrook covered the \\"refugee exodus from Vietnam and the post-Mao opening of China, and has covered turmoil and shifting cultural and economic trends in the United States and around the world, from Somalia and Rwanda to Russia and the Balkans.\\" Ashbrook was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University during which time he decided to leave the Globe in 1996 and create an Internet startup with college friend Rolly Rouse. This company eventually became homeportfolio.com. Ashbrook wrote a book called The Leap: A Memoir of Love and Madness in the Internet Gold Rush about his experience in Internet entrepreneurship. ==On Point, dismissal, and subsequent work== Ashbrook joined public radio following the September 11, 2001 attacks, when he was enlisted by NPR and WBUR-Boston for special coverage. He hosted the National Public Radio show On Point. Ashbrook oversaw a staff of 10 who assisted with research and show preparation ‚Äì typically compiling information relating to the topics to be discussed on the following day's program for Ashbrook to take and read. In December 2017, Ashbrook was placed on leave because of unspecified accusations of misconduct. His final broadcast was on December 8, 2017. WBUR later reported 11 men and women came forward detailing behavior including tirades, belittling critiques of show ideas, and name calling during meetings. Ashbrook allegedly would then give neck or back rubs, hugs, and \\"creepy\\" sex talks after criticism or critical comment. Boston University hired two law firms to investigate allegations against Ashbrook. One examined allegations of unwanted contact and the other looked into bullying behavior. On February 14, 2018, Ashbrook was dismissed from WBUR after both investigations concluded he had created a hostile work environment, although neither investigation concluded the harassment was sexual in nature. Ashbrook made a statement on the same day, saying that the decision was ‚Äúprofoundly unfair.‚Äù In subsequent news interviews, he described himself as \\"chastened\\" but determined to return to radio broadcasting \\"somewhere, sometime soon.\\" In June 2018, Ashbrook started recording shows of his own podcast, \\"Tom Ashbrook-Conversations\\". He launched the podcast via Twitter on August 1, 2018. The conversations cover issues of global importance such as racism, social media, and the global balance of power. Featured guests on the show so far have included Steve Locke, Kori Schake, Salman Habib, Maya Jasanoff, and Sir John Sawers. ==Personal life== Tom Ashbrook has a daughter and two sons. On November 6, 2014, his wife of 39 years, Danielle Guichard- Ashbrook, died of cancer. Ashbrook subsequently married Cathryn Ann Cl√ºver in June 2017, after meeting in March 2016 regarding an On Point story concerning refugees. He lives in Newton, Massachusetts. Ashbrook underwent heart bypass surgery in November 2007 and was off air until January 2, 2008, when he discussed his medical journey in a show with his doctors and nurses. ==Awards== Livingston Award for National Reporting ‚Äì 1996 ==References * Tom Ashbrook's Official Twitter Account * Interview for The Leap Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:American radio journalists Category:American radio reporters and correspondents Category:American male journalists Category:Nieman Fellows Category:NPR personalities Category:Writers from Bloomington, Illinois Category:People from Newton, Massachusetts Category:Yale University alumni ","title":"Tom Ashbrook"},{"id":"6228722","text":"Alfred Hamilton Barr Jr. (January 28, 1902 ‚Äì August 15, 1981) was an American art historian and the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. From that position, he was one of the most influential forces in the development of popular attitudes toward modern art; for example, his arranging of the blockbuster Van Gogh exhibition of 1935, in the words of author Bernice Kert, was \\"a precursor to the hold Van Gogh has to this day on the contemporary imagination.\\" ==Life and education== Barr graduated from the Boys' Latin School of Maryland. Barr received his B.A. in 1923 and his M.A. in 1924 from Princeton University, where he studied art history with Frank Jewett Mather and Charles Rufus Morey. In 1924, he began doctoral work at Harvard, but left after completing PhD course requirements to pursue teaching. He was not awarded his PhD until 1946. He married the art historian Margaret Scolari on 8 May 1930 in Paris. They had one daughter, Victoria Barr, who is a painter. ==Career== Barr was hired as an associate professor to teach art history at Wellesley College in 1926, where in the same year he offered the first-ever undergraduate course on modern art, \\"Tradition and Revolt in Modern Painting.\\" This course was notable not only for the novelty of its subject- matter but also for its unconventional pedagogy: Barr referred to all nine students in the class as \\"faculty\\", making them each responsible for mastering and teaching some of the course content. Although, per its title, the course ostensibly focused on painting, Barr thought a broad understanding of culture was necessary to understand any individual artistic discipline, and accordingly, the class also studied design, architecture, film, sculpture, and photography. There was no required reading aside from Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and The New Masses, and the numerous class trips were not to typical locations of art-historical interest. For example, on a trip to Cambridge, the class passed over the wealth of Harvard's museums to experience the \\"exquisite structural virtuosity\\", in Barr's words, of the Necco candy factory. In 1929, Barr was awarded a Carnegie Fellowship, which he intended to use to complete the requirements for his PhD by writing a dissertation during the following academic year on modern art and Cubism at New York University. But greater ambitions obliged him to shelve that intention when Anson Conger Goodyear, acting on the recommendation of Paul J. Sachs, offered Barr the directorship of the newly founded Museum of Modern Art. Assuming the post in August 1929 aged only twenty-seven, Barr's achievements in it accumulated quickly; the Museum held its first loan exhibition in November, on the Post-Impressionists Vincent Van Gogh, C√©zanne, Gauguin, and Seurat. Perhaps Barr's most memorable and enduring accomplishment in his directorial capacity was the Picasso retrospective of 1939‚Äì1940, which caused a reinterpretation of the artist's work and established the model for all future retrospectives at the Museum. In 1930, Barr married Margaret Scolari, whom he met at the inaugural exhibition of MoMA in 1929. According to Sybil Gordon Kantor in her book Alfred H. Barr Jr. and the Intellectual Origins of the Museum of Modern Art, Frank Crowninshield art critic, journalist and editor of Vanity Fair, was one of Barr's mentors and one of the founding trustee members of the Museum of Modern Art along with several others.Kantor, Sybil. Alfred H. Barr Jr. and the Intellectual Origins of the Museum of Modern Art In 1941, in collaboration with his wife and Varian Fry, he helped many artists escape from France, occupied by the nazis, one of them being Marc Chagall. The Barr helped secure American visas as well as the sponsorship of 3000 dollars requested to get the visa. In 1943, Museum of Modern Art president Stephen Carlton Clark dismissed Barr as director of the Museum, though he was allowed to stay on as an advisory director (working with his successor Rene d'Harnoncourt); later Barr was given the title Director of Collections. By the time Barr left MoMA in 1968, modern art would be considered as legitimate an art-historical field of study as earlier eras such as the Renaissance. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952. In recognition of Barr's legacy as an art historian and first director of MoMA, the College Art Association established the Alfred H. Barr Jr. Award for museum scholarship in 1980. The award is given annually to the author of an outstanding catalogue produced through a museum, library, or public or private collection. ==Selected worksBooks=== *Picasso: Fifty Years of His Art (1946) *Matisse, His Art and His Public (1951) *Cubism and Abstract Art Cambridge: Belknap Press (1986). *Art in America in Modern Times (1934) ===Essays=== *\\"Chronicles.\\" Painting and Sculpture in The Museum of Modern Art 1929‚Äì1967.

After retiring from football, Stillie pursued a career in English law, and contested the 2019 UK general election as the Conservative candidate for the Central Ayrshire constituency. ==Football career== Stillie started his career as a youth player at Aberdeen and signed a professional contract in August 1995, at the age of twenty-one. In his first few months at the club, Stillie was an unused substitute as the \\"Dons\\" won the Scottish League Cup. In four years at Pittodrie, Stillie managed only twenty-six appearances and in 1999 moved to Wigan Athletic. At the Lancashire club, Stillie played 57 times, twice helping them reach the Division Two play-offs. In July 2002, Stillie moved back to Scotland to sign for Fife club Dunfermline Athletic where he was a virtual ever-present for the \\"Pars\\", making a total of 117 appearances after replacing first-choice keeper Marco Ruitenbeek in November 2002. During the 2003‚Äì04 season, Stillie was part of the \\"Pars\\" team that were runners-up to Celtic in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final. Former Dundee United manager, Gordon Chisholm signed Stillie at the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season for the \\"Terrors\\" by bringing Stillie to Tannadice for an undisclosed fee from the \\"Pars\\", after first-choice keeper Tony Bullock signed for Gillingham. Stillie was named in two Scotland squads, most recently in October 2003 but never won a cap, although he was an unused substitute in the Future Cup match versus Germany later that month. In May 2007, Stillie confirmed that he would be leaving the \\"Terrors\\" to relocate to England to pursue his English law career. Stillie helped the club to a clean sheet in the final day goalless draw at home to Motherwell. During the 2013 close season, Stillie signed a one-year contract with Gillingham, making his debut in the 4‚Äì0 away defeat to Nottingham Forest on 22 September 2007. Stillie announced his retirement at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season to pursue his career as a lawyer. In May 2012, Stillie gained his first international cap for Sealand, playing alongside Ralf Little versus Chagos Islands, in which he conceded three goals as the match finished 3‚Äì1. ==After football== After retiring as a footballer, Stillie became a lawyer. He acted in defence of the footballers David Goodwillie and David Robertson, who were accused of rape.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east- fife-38651041https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/crime/david- goodwillie-fails-overturn-damages-decision-647864 This legal case made history as the first time a rape victim had successfully sued her attacker for civil damages.https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/rape-case-appeal-for-disgraced- footballer/ As part of the defence of Goodwillie, Stillie as his solicitor lodged court proceedings to seek to revoke legal aid support from the rape victim.https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/rape-case-appeal-for-disgraced- footballer/ In November 2019, Stillie announced that he would be contesting the general election as the Conservative candidate for the Central Ayrshire constituency.

Keen is a theorist of contemporary conflict, notably in African society. He has done fieldwork in Sudan, Sierra Leone and Iraq, and archival research. In Endless War and in several articles he has argued that \\"winning war is rarely an end in itself; rather, war tends to be part of a wider political and economic game that is consistent with strengthening the enemy\\". The \\"war on terror\\" is, for Keen, an extension of the Cold War. The Benefits of Famine explored how the 1980s famines in Sudan were of use to certain groups.

It is owned and operated by Clalit Health Services, Israel's largest health maintenance organization. In January 1996, Beilinson Hospital and Hasharon Hospital were merged and renamed Rabin Medical Center. It has a capacity of 1,300 beds. ==HistoryBeilinson Hospital=== Beilinson hospital ward in the 1950s Beilinson Hospital was founded in 1936 to serve the nearby agricultural settlements. All Jewish workers in central Palestine agreed to donate two days' worth of wages toward its construction. The hospital opened with 70 beds. It was named for Dr. Moshe Beilinson, one of its founders. HaSharon Hospital was built in 1942 as an extension of Beilinson. In 1954, a new building in the International Style was designed by Arieh Sharon and Benjamin Idelson, pioneers of Israeli modernist architecture. In 1938, the country's first blood bank was established at Beilinson. Beilinson Hospital was the first medical institution in the country to have a dermatology department, a nephrology institute, and a dialysis unit. In 1968, the first heart transplant in Israel was performed there. The first implantation of an artificial heart in Israel was performed at Beilinson in 1995. ===Schneider Children's Medical Center=== Shmuel Flatto-Sharon art gallery, Rabin Medical Center On October 29, 1991, the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel was founded on the hospital grounds, the largest such facility in Israel. It opened to the public in April 1992. It spans an area of 35,000 sq. meters. It was named after two major benefactors, Irving and Helen Schneider. It was designed by Marvin Bostin and Jerry Switzer. In 2007, over 52,000 children were treated at the emergency ward of the center, over 15,000 staying for prolonged treatment. 21 children underwent organ transplants, including a heart transplant. 8,360 children underwent miscellaneous operations, of which 450 were heart and blood system operations. ===Golda‚ÄìHaSharon Hospital=== HaSharon Hospital was founded in 1942 by a team of surgeons from the Beilinson Hospital as a satellite surgical unit. It was originally established in a 1-floor building, and named Beilinson II. It originally had 28 beds. Beilinson II was renamed HaSharon Hospital several years later. In 1982, Golda was appended to the hospital's name, after the late Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir. Golda-HaSharon Hospital currently has 400 beds. ===Merger=== Grounds of Rabin Medical Center While physically separated, the two hospitals were officially merged in 1996 in a budget saving consolidation and the umbrella organization renamed the Rabin Medical Center, in memory of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister who had been assassinated in the previous year. ==Clinical research== In 2012, the hospital received NIS 63.5 million in revenue for clinical research, after a 70% increase from 2011, topping the list for Israeli hospitals. ==See also== *Health care in Israel *Medical tourism in Israel ==References *Official website *Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel Category:Hospitals in Israel Category:Buildings and structures in Petah Tikva Category:1936 establishments in Mandatory Palestine Category:Buildings and structures in Central District (Israel) Category:1996 establishments in Israel ","title":"Rabin Medical Center"},{"id":"6228847","text":"This is a list of running jokes and catchphrases in the 1950s British radio programme The Goon Show. ==Catchphrases== ;Bluebottle's catchphrases *Bluebottle reads his own stage directions out loud (though he might argue that they would otherwise be lost in a radio programme format). (\\"Enter Bluebottle wearing doublet made from mum's old drawers\\"; \\"Enter Bluebottle, waits for audience applause... not a sausage\\"; or \\"Strikes heroic pose, but trousers fall down and ruin effect\\"). He also says his inner thoughts out loud, preceded by the stage-direction \\"Thinks...\\". *Bluebottle would say, \\"I don't like this game!\\", especially when he was about to be, or had just been \\"deaded\\". *Bluebottle says \\"You rotten swine, you!\\" when something bad happens to him like being \\"deaded\\". At one point in the episode \\"The Sinking of Westminster Pier\\", he complained that he was always being \\"deaded\\", and that Eccles never was. This was followed by an explosion and a call of \\"You rotten swine, Bluebottle!\\" from Eccles. *Other Bluebottle catchphrases include: \\"I heard you call me, My Capitaine!\\", which was usually addressed to Seagoon. *Variations of \\"Ooh! Liquorice! I must be careful of how many of them I eat!\\" *Often in reference to one of the many dangers facing him in various Goon Show episodes: \\"Harm can come to a growing lad like that!\\". This latter quote can also be found in two of the many Songs released by the Goons, the \\"Bluebottle Blues\\", and the Goons' own recording of \\"Unchained Melody\\". *The intention to use sweets to win the favours of girls: \\"with these two ounces of jelly babies I will be able to influence Mavis Pringe\\". ;Eccles' catchphrases *Introducing himself \\"I'm the famous Eccles\\". *The phrase \\"fine, fine, fine\\", often said when confused, or at seemingly incongruous moments. *When someone orders Eccles to \\"shut up\\", Eccles himself starts shouting \\"Shut up\\" or \\"Shut up, Eccles\\", usually being the last to finish. ;Grytpype-Thynne's catchphrases; *Hercules Grytpype-Thynne, instead of offering cigarettes to smoke, gave strange items such as gorillas, brass instruments, and pictures of Queen Victoria. Neddie Seagoon would often decline: \\"Have a Gorilla?\\" \\"No thanks, I'm trying to give them up.\\" Later in the show this might be followed with \\"Have a Gorilla?\\" \\"No thanks, I've just put one out.\\" *\\"You silly twisted boy, you!\\" In the fifth series, Grytpype-Thynne says this to Neddie Seagoon on a regular basis in regard to his silly behaviour. In \\"The White Box of Great Bardfield\\", a running gag during the show is Seagoon's attempts to win a reward of ten shillings after being chained up by Ellington in the first scene; he has complete confidence in his ability to escape: after all, he is the son of Houdini!! Grytpype-Thynne says the phrase after witnessing Neddie's long and agonising contortions. Ray Ellington himself gets to say this quote in \\"The End (Confessions of a Secret Senna-Pod Drinker)\\", and Grytpype also lets Greenslade say it (with permission) in \\"The Six Ingots of Leadenhall Street\\". It is also heard in \\"China Story\\", following Ned Seagoon's admission that he is the British ambassador, and in \\"The Whistling Spy Enigma\\", after Neddie arrives at MI5, giving a long list of patriotic and foolhardy deeds he is willing to do for his country. Other catchphrases *Regularly one-liners are responded to with the music hall catchphrase: \\"I don't wish to know that!\\" *Moriarty (but sometimes other characters) exclaims \\"Sapristi\\" followed by a second word. This varied, including \\"nobolas\\", \\"needle nardle noo\\", \\"nyuckobakakas\\", \\"Fred\\", \\"pompet\\", or something to do with the day's plot. *Moriarty used the catchphrase \\"and there's more where that came from\\". The line was also occasionally used by Bloodnok, at least once by Minnie (\\"The Scarlet Capsule\\"), and at least once by Grytpype-Thynne. *Bloodnok was usually introduced by his theme music, followed by explosions or gurgling liquid noises. These are used to reference Bloodnok's uncontrollable flatulence, and are usually accompanied by Bloodnok yelling in pain, followed by some explanation of the noise, such as \\"Curse this Spanish food,\\" or \\"No more curried eggs for me.\\" Sometimes the music failed to cue the noises, whereupon Sellers usually covered up by saying \\"I'm cured!\\". *Other Bloodnok catchphrases include \\"you filthy swine\\" and variations on \\"that's done me a power of good\\", \\"quick, get behind the screen, Gladys\\", \\"we're just good friends, I tell you\\" and \\"it was hell in there\\". *Little Jim's only line in most episodes is simply to say \\"He's fallen in the wah-taa!\\", in a childish voice. It is often commented by various characters, usually Grytpype-Thynne, that they do not know what they would do without him, once even extending to Bloodnok actually attempting to do the catchphrase for him when Jim himself had been thrown into the water. On the BBC Radio show Dad Made Me Laugh Peter Sellers' son Michael revealed he was the source of the phrase, when as a small child he used it to talk about people jumping into their swimming pool. *Miss Minnie Bannister used many opportunities to say \\"We'll all be murdered in our beds!\\" or something along similar lines; after being swallowed by a tiger: \\"We'll all be murdered in our tigers!\\", or in \\"Shangri-La Again\\": \\"We'll all be murdered in our monasteries!\\" **In \\"The End Confessions Of A Secret Sennapod Drinker\\", Minnie gives a legitimate reason for her catchphrase - as Jack the Ripper was never caught, she believes he's waiting until the outcry about his murders have died down...\\"And then we'll all be murdered in our beds!\\" * In the fifth series, Eccles would often state, \\"It's good to be alive!\\" at the most inopportune moments. In \\"1985\\" (a parody of the George Orwell novel Nineteen Eighty-Four), Eccles modified this catchphrase as \\"It's good to be alive...in 1985!\\" * Henry Crun would often start mumbling \\"you can't get the wood, you know\\" when asked to do any sort of job, even though the job (such as the building of a \\"waterproof gas stove\\" in The Siege of Fort Night) would never require any wood. Sometimes he would also complain about \\"a shortage of shortages\\". * Announcer Wallace Greenslade would often end episodes with the line, \\"It's all in the mind, you know\\". This catchphrase would later be taken up by The Beatles in their 1968 movie, Yellow Submarine. * Scenes set in the House of Commons often featured someone asking, \\"who is responsible for the drains at Hackney?\\" * Seagoon is often heard making a blatant word-twisting joke to a fellow character or the audience to which both he and the audience will start to laugh. When the audience dies out, Seagoon is often left laughing hysterically. He then notices his mistake in laughing at his own joke, stops and pretends to be clearing his throat. * Neddie's stock catchphrase was the phrase \\"Needle-nardle-noo!\\" which he would use as an exclamation and to punctuate his lines. He would also occasionally utter the phrase \\"isotopes peru\\" as a general nonsense phrase e.g.; \\"I didn't study Astro Navigation in the isotopes peru for nothing, you know!\\" (\\"taken from \\"The Treasure in the Lake\\") Seagoon would also use the nonsense phrase, \\"Ying tong iddle-i po\\", usually followed by some member of the cast yelling \\"GOOD\\". * In the same seasons, whenever the orchestra would strike up a dance number, the following dialogue would take place between Grytpype-Thynne and Neddie, as they were dancing: Q: \\"Do you come here often?\\" A: \\"Only in the mating season!\\". Later, in \\"The Choking Horror\\", Moriarty and Grytpype dance together upon learning that they are to be bombed, and the second sentence is modified to \\"Only during an Air Raid...\\" * Moriarty would be regularly introduced by Grytpype-Thynne with a different nickname and accompanying sound effect. A key example of this is Count Jim \\"Drop 'Em\\" Moriarty followed by the sound of a slide-whistle to give the impression of trousers falling down. More than once he was introduced as \\"Count Jim 'Thighs' Moriarty\\", and Spike, as Moriarty, gave a knowing \\"Ooohh!\\". In another episode he was introduced as \\"the champion barbed-wire hurdler of France - until his tragic accident\\". * In \\"Shangri-La Again\\", the issue of catchphrases was addressed directly; Greenslade wearily exclaimed to the audience, \\"Ying-Tong-Iddle-I-Po. Needle-Nardle-Noo. Spling- Splang-Splong. All's Well That Ends Well, and this is Wallace Greenslade, lover of good English, wishing he were dead!.\\" The immediate response was the sound of a gun being fired, with Peter Sellers joyously exclaiming \\"Wish granted!\\" * Occasionally during an episode, a voice can be heard declaring \\"I don't like it at all, Pat\\", an example of which can be found in the opening of \\"The White Neddie Trade\\", and possibly a mock complaint to the shows producer, Pat Dixon. The phrase is sometimes altered to \\"I don't like it Jim\\". ==Regular plot devices== *Bluebottle would often be killed, or \\"deaded\\", during the course of an episode. He would often comment on his demise, usually with his catchphrase, \\"You dirty rotten swines, you! You have deaded me.\\" ‚Äì or variations on same. Bluebottle, if he survived to the end of the episode, would sometimes note his escape. *Bluebottle often proclaimed he was brave and manly, yet when called upon to do something of that ilk, would often refuse. However, he would soon change his mind when offered a paltry reward, such as in \\"The Hastings Flyer ‚Äì Robbed\\". Seagoon: \\"Come, come, little two-stone Hercules ‚Äì now, tell me if you saw two men and you can have this quarter of dolly mixtures.\\" Bluebottle: \\"Cor, dolly mixture ‚Äì thinks ‚Äì with these-type sweets I could influence certain girls at playtime ‚Äì that Brenda Pugh might be another Rita Hayworth.\\" *In the 1954‚Äì55 season, the show would often start: \\"The highly esteemed Goon Show presents the BBC!\\" Occasionally, this would be rephrased as: \\"The highly steamed Goon Show presents the BBC!\\" *Eccles and/or Bluebottle were usually employed in some capacity at which they are completely useless. *People would travel very long distances in very short spaces of time with a great \\"whooshing\\" sound. *Neddie Seagoon is often referred to as very fat and very short ‚Äì in \\"The Greenslade Story\\", after Neddie exclaims to John Snagge, \\"Not so fast, Mr John Boat Race Snagge!\\", Snagge dryly remarks \\"Those words came from a small ball of fat that sprang from behind a piano stool\\"; similarly, in \\"The Mummified Priest\\", Bloodnok recognises Seagoon for his ability to walk underneath a piano stool. In \\"Wings Over Dagenham\\", Grytpype refers to Neddie as \\"Little square pudding\\", and in \\"World War I\\", Mr Lalkaka, playing the part of a tailor, has been given Neddie's vital statistics, so that he (Lalkaka) can make Neddie's demob suit. He is at a loss to work out how a person with these measurements can live. Then Neddie enters, and Lalkaka cries: \\"It's true!\\" *Neddie would either be very rich and important (such as the Prime Minister) with Grytpype-Thynne and Moriarty trying to swindle him, or he would be very poor and become their patsy in an implausible money making scheme. *Wallace Greenslade, the announcer, was portrayed as an idol and heartthrob with his own fan-club, \\"The Greensladers\\". At one point he addresses them with the message \\"I should like to thank the fifty thousand members of the Wallace Greenslade Society, who clubbed together to send me last year's birthday honours. How nice to have such nice, sweet friends.\\" Grytpype immediately stage-whispers \\"He's a bit of a crawler, Moriarty!\\" *Greenslade often refers to the Radio Times magazine, frequently praising it for its low price and interesting content, for example in \\"The Yehti\\". In \\"The Sinking of Westminster Pier\\", he repeatedly announces that the Goons are performing \\"The Six Ingots of Leadenhall Street\\", as stated in that week's Radio Times, insisting that \\"the Radio Times never lies!\\" The show had been changed at short notice, and was indeed billed as \\"The Six Ingots of Leadenhall Street\\" in the Radio Times. *The fact that Ray Ellington was black was commonly joked about. Most of these \\"politically incorrect\\" statements and jokes were later edited out, and were consequently lost. However, the above episodes are broadcast on Goon Show Radio, and (with the exception of \\"The Affair Of The Lone Banana\\"), contain the supposed cuts outlined below. **When Seagoon narrates in \\"Under Two Floorboards\\", \\"At the mention of the police, we all turned white\\", Ellington responds, \\"Get me a mirror!\\" **In \\"The Childe Harolde Rewarde\\", Neddie is looking for a blacksmith to help him withdraw the sword from the stone. He meets Ellington and asks, \\"Are you a blacksmith?\\" Ellington replies, \\"My name's Smith, and you've got eyes!\\" **In \\"Ye Bandit of Sherwood Forest\\", Bluebottle tells him \\"If I had my arms free, I'd black your eyes.\\" Ellington parries by asking, \\"What's the matter, son? Are you colour blind?\\" **In \\"The Greatest Mountain In The World\\", Eccles picks up a stick of dynamite, thinking it to be a cigar, and it explodes in his face. Henry Crun comes along, mistakes Eccles for Ellington, and when Eccles corrects him, Henry says, \\"Oh yes ‚Äì yours rubs off, doesn't it?\\" Similarly, Bluebottle says \\"Don't touch me, Ellington ‚Äì you will rub off on me!\\" **In \\"the Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI\\", Ellington holds the post of Black Rod within Parliament. **In \\"The Flea\\", Ellington plays the role of a sergeant in a Scottish regiment (a not-too-subtle reference to the Black Watch), reporting to Major Bloodnok in a distinctly non-Scottish voice; Seagoon asks incredulously, \\"How did he get into a Scottish Regiment?\\", to which Bloodnok replies: \\"He lied about his age\\". **In \\"The Affair of the Lone Banana\\", Bloodnok remarks that all of his regiment have \\"turned yellow\\"; upon Ellington's demand that he speak for himself, Bloodnok apologises profusely, \\"I'm sorry Ellington, I know you Irish are very brave!\\" **In \\"ill Met By Goonlight\\", Seagoon is told (by Grytpype) he will be sent ashore with three men with blackened faces, whereupon Seagoon says he's only been given enough blacking for two. The response comes back: \\"One of the men is Ray Ellington! Any Questions?\\" Ellington promptly replies, \\"It's not fair ‚Äì just 'cos I've got a sunlamp!\\" *A recurring rambling conversation between two South Asian Indians (one often called Mr Banerjee), about nothing in particular and with Indian accents and syntax. *OBEs were often joked about as though they were very easy to obtain (and perhaps even undesirable). **In \\"The Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI\\", Seagoon is the Prime Minister, and as a stimulant has to swallow an OBE daily, applied by his butler Grytpype-Thynne (\\"friend and confidante, and author of 'Ten Years As A Russian Spy at No. 10'\\"). Grytpype also tells Moriarty in the same episode that he will get \\"A Russian OBE for that!\\" . **In \\"The Dreaded Batter Pudding- Hurler (of Bexhill-on-Sea)\\", Seagoon congratulates Henry Crun for striking down Minnie Bannister. When he admits he didn't do it, Seagoon thunders, \\"Coward! Hand back your OBE!\\" **In \\"World War I\\", Willum is found in a labour exchange, and says to the manager, played by Secombe, \\"You gotta be careful, there's a lot of work about, mate. Only two more days and I celebrate me fifty years without work.\\" Secombe replies \\"Fifty years unemployed? Good heavens! Fill in this form for your OBE.\\" **In \\"Queen Anne's Rain\\", Secombe, on being asked what he would do with an OBE, replies that he would sing it, and does so to the tune of \\"Shenandoah\\". Greenslade responds by singing \\"Oh OBE, the pipes, the pipes are frozen\\" to the tune of the \\"Londonderry Air\\". ==Very long jokes== A number of episodes seem to contain jokes which take a minute or more to get to the punchline, either due to the need to use up time, or more likely, for comic effect. Some examples are below: *In \\"The Great Tuscan Salami Scandal\\", Henry claims to have an idea, forgets it, remembers it, tells Minnie, forgets it again, is told by Minnie and then declares, \\"What a good idea\\". Minnie then goes on to ask what was a good idea. This part of the scene goes on for 4 minutes. *In \\"The Affair of the Lone Banana\\", before sending Neddie to South America, Henry Crun spends two minutes apparently taking down Neddie's details, asking him to spell everything, usually more than once, and even falling asleep before finally saying, \\"It's no good, I'll have to get a pencil and some paper and write all this down.\\" *In \\"The Whistling Spy Enigma\\", Grytpype and Neddie sit down to think of a solution to Neddie's inability to whistle. Greenslade then explains that while they are thinking, the well-known tenor, Webster Smogpule, will fill in time. The tenor then introduces his number, signals for music, waits for three bars, begins to sing \\"I shine...\\" only to be interrupted by Grytpype's \\"I've got it, Seagoon, I've got it!\\". Smogpule tries again later in the show, only to be shot down in the middle of the second line. *In \\"The Mummified Priest\\", Crun makes a rather lame joke, and bursts into hysterical laughter with Eccles, only for them both to begin 'ha' -ing to a tune, singing 'Ah ha ha ha ha ha ho,' etc. Greenslade then appears: \\"Listeners will note the cunning way in which the Goons fill in time on their programme!\\" *In \\"China Story\\", Neddie is instructed by Grytpype to go to the Tea House of the August Goon, knock 6000 times and ask for Ah Pong. He does so to actual gradually sped-up sound-effects. Then, when Milligan, as Throat, answers the door, Neddie asks: \\"Teahouse of the August Goon?\\", Throat replies \\"No!\\" and slams the door. \\"Curse!\\" cries Seagoon, \\"it's next door! It's always next door in China!\\" More time elapses as Neddie knocks 6000 times on the correct door. When the door is opened, this time Milligan, in a mock Chinese accent, says \\"Someblody knock??\\" Neddie, exhausted, gasps, \\"Tea House of August Goon?\\" When Milligan confirms this, Seagoon says, \\"Are you Ah Pong?\\" Milligan says, \\"Yes, we are ah pong (we are open) till 11 o'clock.\\" *In \\"The White Neddie Trade\\", Henry and Minnie tell each other they must not waste any time, and then break into a spontaneous song about not wasting time. Milligan ends the song by saying (almost off-microphone), \\"We filled out the time like the producer asked!\\" *In \\"The Junk Affair\\", Bloodnok telephones a warehouse he owns to see if it is on the phone. When the phone in the warehouse rings, he asks Seagoon to answer it, and then asks to speak to the owner. Seagoon replies that the owner is outside, and goes to get Bloodnok. Bloodnok asks Seagoon to hold the phone outside while he goes in to answer the other one. When Bloodnok answers the phone inside the warehouse, Seagoon calls him to speak on the one outside, and Bloodnok asks him to hold the phone inside. Bloodnok, once more outside, again asks to speak to the owner. This routine is repeated several times, from the third time onwards as a gradually speeded-up recording. *In the episode \\"The Man Who Tried to Destroy London's Monuments\\" there is a long scene when Neddie Seagoon goes to Minnie Bannister and Henry Crun's house and knocks on the door. Inside the house Minnie keeps calling Crun's name over and over again to get him to answer the door. Crun however cannot hear her over the knocking on the door and after a long drawn out two minutes he goes down to get Neddie to stop knocking, after which he can finally hear her. After this he then goes to the door and says \\"You can start knocking again now\\" before going back inside. The knocking starts again and Min starts calling his name again to get him to answer the door and he still can't hear her. After about five minutes of this they let Neddie inside. *In \\"The Giant Bombardon\\", Captain Ned Seagoon gives a report to parliament on the Russian fortifications at Sebastopol, claiming the walls are twenty feet thick. A nasal-toned MP (voiced by Sellers) immediately asks for clarification ‚Äì \\"You say the walls are twenty feet thick? Why do you say that?\\" ‚Äì and continues to interrupt Seagoon's speech, further asking if the walls have been measured. When he introduces the possibility that the walls might be ten feet six inches thick and refuses to accept the blame for this shortcoming, their argument causes an uproar until a second, elderly MP (voiced by Milligan) calms the two down. The first MP apologises to Seagoon, who accepts his apology. Before he can continue his speech, the first MP interrupts again: \\"Captain Seagoon! You say you accept my apology. Why do you say that?\\", causing Seagoon to collapse in tears and parliament to descend into chaos. ==FootnotesBibliography== * ‚Äî includes chapters from Milligan, Secombe & Sykes. * ‚Äî remains the definitive book on the series Running jokes ","title":"The Goon Show running jokes"},{"id":"6228876","text":"Joel C.

It is written by Stewart Stern, based on a story by Hopper and Stern, and stars an extensive supporting cast that includes Stella Garcia, Don Gordon, Peter Fonda, Julie Adams, Sylvia Miles, Samuel Fuller, Dean Stockwell, Russ Tamblyn, Tomas Milian, Toni Basil, Severn Darden, Henry Jaglom, Rod Cameron, and Kris Kristofferson & Michelle Phillips in their film debuts. The plot centers on a disenfranchised stuntman (Hopper), who begins a filmmaking-centric cargo cult among Peruvian natives after going into self- imposed exile. Greenlit after the success of Hopper's previous film Easy Rider, Universal Pictures gave the director/star complete creative control over the project, which was budgeted at $1 million and was shot on-location in Peru. Hopper only loosely followed the script by Stern, filming hours upon hours of footage built around friends whom he invited to the set, including several of his collaborators Fonda and Basil. The film's elongated post- production came from Hopper's constant editing and re-editing of the film while suffering from the effects of ongoing substance abuse, leading to allegations of self-sabotage and missing the film's initial deadline to deliver a final cut nearly six months later. Despite initially high expectations including a well-received screening at the 1971 Venice International Film Festival, the film was a critical and financial disaster. Disatissfied with the finished product, Universal Pictures gave the film a staggered, limited release under multiple alternative titles. Its poor reception led to Hopper's self-imposed exile from Hollywood for several years, not directing another film until Out of the Blue (1980). In the decades since its initial release, it has undergone a critical reappraisal, and has become a cult classic. ==Plot== Kansas (Hopper) is a stunt coordinator in charge of horses on a western being shot in a small Peruvian village. Following a tragic incident on the set where an actor is killed in a stunt, he decides to quit the movie business and stay in Peru with a local woman. He thinks he has found paradise, but is soon called in to help in a bizarre incident: the Peruvian natives are \\"filming\\" their own movie with \\"cameras\\" made of sticks, and acting out real western movie violence, as they don't understand movie fakery. == Cast Analysis== The film touches on the ideas of fiction versus reality, especially in regards to cinema. The movie is presented in a way that challenges the viewer's traditional cinematic understanding of storytelling, by presenting the story in a non-chronological fashion, and by including several devices typically only seen behind the scenes of film-making (rough edits and \\"scene missing\\" cards), and the use of jarring jump cuts. ==Production== The Last Movie was a long-time pet project of Hopper and writer Stewart Stern, who had written Rebel Without a Cause, in which Hopper played a small role. After developing the script in the early 1960s, Hopper tried for several years to secure financing for the film, intending it to be his directorial debut. Due to the artistically challenging nature of the film, no studios were interested until Hopper's actual first film as a director, Easy Rider, became a massive hit in 1969. Based on the success of Easy Rider, Universal launched a project to give five young film makers $1 million each, and give them free rein to create a movie with little to no intervention from the studio (as had been done on Easy Rider). The other four were The Hired Hand, Taking Off, Silent Running, and American Graffiti, directed by Peter Fonda, Milo≈° Forman, Douglas Trumbull, and George Lucas, respectively. Given this freedom, Hopper spent much of 1970 in Peru, bringing many of his actor and musician friends to Peru‚Äîincluding singer Kris Kristofferson and director Samuel Fuller‚Äîand shooting the film under the working title Chinchero. With hours and hours of footage, Hopper holed up in his home editing studio in Taos, New Mexico, but failed to deliver a cut by the end of 1970. He was in a period of severe alcohol and drug abuse (as shown in an extremely rare and barely released documentary called The American Dreamer, which was directed by Lawrence Schiller and L.M. Kit Carson), but managed to put together a fairly straightforward cut in terms of conventional storytelling. He was mocked over it by his friend, cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky, who urged him to edit the film unconventionally and attempt to break new cinematic ground, which caused Hopper to destroy that edit and craft the more disjointed narrative that is known today; he finally completed that final edit in the spring of 1971. ==Reception== The movie won the Critics Prize (CIDALC Award) at the Venice Film Festival but despite this, it failed financially and critically after a two-week run at New York City's Cinema 1.Biskind, P. (1998). Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. New York, NY: Simon & Schuster. (Contrary to some sources, including statements by Hopper himself, the film did play in other theaters across the country after its New York premiere, even playing at drive-ins under the name Chinchero.) Owing to its resulting demise, Hopper did not direct again until 1980's Out of the Blue. The book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time recounts the film's production in some detail, saying that the studio was so eager to cash in on the youth market following the success of Easy Rider that they gave Hopper carte blanche, and they were horrified with the results. ==Legacy== The film's initial failure led to Hopper's virtual exile from Hollywood, one that lasted well over a decade. Nonetheless, Hopper later announced he was very proud of the film, and hosted many screenings. While he had disparaged the film in the past, Hopper said it was ahead of its time, and only now had audiences and critics started to understand his artistic vision. In 2006, Hopper told Playboy that he had re-acquired the rights to the film and was planning a DVD release. The magazine even mentions at the time that Hopper held a screening of the film at the Playboy Mansion for Hugh Hefner and several Playmates. Hopper did not realize his plans to release the film on DVD before his death in May 2010. On August 16, 2018, Arbelos Films, Vidiots & American Cinematheque hosted the Los Angeles 4K restoration premiere at Sid Grauman's Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, California. A Blu-ray of the film was announced for release on November 13, 2018. ==See also== * List of American films of 1971 *Cargo cult ==References* *Review by Vincent Canby of The New York Times *Critique of the film at Reverse Shot *Account of the shoot from Life magazine Category:1971 films Category:Films directed by Dennis Hopper Category:American drama films Category:1971 drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Peru Category:Films shot in Peru Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films with screenplays by Dennis Hopper Category:Films with screenplays by Stewart Stern Category:American films Category:Cargo cults ","title":"The Last Movie"},{"id":"6228911","text":"David Spencer (born 1958) is a British playwright.

It was delivered in 346 BC and constitutes a political intervention of Demosthenes in favor of the Peace of Philocrates. ==Historical background== Just after the conclusion of the Peace of Philocrates, Philip II of Macedon passed Thermopylae, and subdued Phocis,Demosthenes,On the Crown, 36. which was not helped by Athens.Demosthenes, On the Peace, 10. Supported by Thebes and Thessaly,Demosthenes, On the Crown, 43. Macedon took control of Phocis' votes in the Amphictyonic League. The Athenians had not been present at the council meeting that had voted for Philip's election into the council. However, Philip thought it proper to send letters to the states that had not been present, inviting them to assemble at Delphi so that they could ratify his election. Athens, among others, received the invitation. The invitation raised much ferment in the Athenian assembly, with many members indignant and opposed to Philips' election into the council. Yet, despite some strong and continuing opposition,Demosthenes, On the False Embassy, 111-113. Athens finally legitimised Philip's entrance into the Council of the League. Demosthenes was among those who recommended this stance in his oration On the Peace. ==The speech== The real subject of the oration is not peace, but the legitimation of Philip's participation in the Amphictyonic League.A. Galinos, Comments on Demosthenes, 327 etc. Ecclesia convened in order to take the final decision and Demosthenes was among those who expressed their opinion. He first argues that the current situation is unpleasant for the Athenians because of their own negligence (par. 1-3). He then refers to previous misjudgments of his countrymen (4-12) and asserts that Athens must avoid a war that would unify against it all the Greek cities (13-14) He argues that, if they do not recognize the new status quo in the Council of the League, they will cause a rift with the other members of the League (18-19). In order to convince ecclesia, he reminds his countrymen of the fact that in the past Philip had efficiently exploited Thebes' and Thessaly's interests, in order to use them for his own purposes. He is thus capable of repeating such a plot (20-23). Finally, the orator enumerates Athens' sacrifices for the sake of peace and argues that it would be unintelligent to break the peace because of the incident in Delphi. Nonetheless, he underscores that they must not accept any further concession to Philip (24-25). According to A. W.Pickard, the Assembly were persuaded to give way. To have refused would have brought the united forces of the Amphictyonic States against Athens: and those they could not have resisted. It was therefore prudent to keep the peace, though Demosthenes evidently regarded it only as an armistice. A. Galinos regards Demosthenes' oration as model of the art of diplomacy and emphasizes on the pain and the psychological pressure Demosthenes must have suffered, arguing in favor of Philip's demands.A. Galinos, Comments on Demosthenes, 330. ==References *Preface and translation of the oration by A.

Until resigning as the whip in July 2019, Darzi sat as a Labour member of the House of Lords, but now sits as an independent peer because of his perception that Jeremy Corbyn failed to control anti-semitism within Labour. ==Early life and family== Darzi was born in Baghdad, Iraq to Armenian parents displaced by the 1915 Armenian Genocide. His family had lived in Erzurum, Ottoman Empire (now Turkey). His paternal great-grandparents, Tatyos and Elbiz Shiroian, had one daughter and four sons. Elbiz and her daughter, Arevalous (Darzi's grandmother), were the only survivors of the genocide. They fled on foot to northern Iraq with the aid of a friend of Tatyos. Darzi's father was born in Mosul and his mother was born in Baghdad. Darzi is fluent in Armenian and served as a choirboy for Armenian religious services, growing up in Baghdad . He graduated from Baghdad College, but the situation in Iraq in the late 1970s led to his family's emigration. At 17, he moved to Ireland to study medicine,http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island- discs/castaway/42d3c3a3, Ara Darzi: Desert Island Discs Castaway, first broadcast on 22 June 2008 while his parents and sister eventually settled in London. \\"We were refugees. We had thrived in Iraq. But it was quite clear that we had to move on again. The first Gulf war was looming. I remember my father saying: 'The kids need to get out of here,'\\" Darzi recalled in 2015. He studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, obtaining the degrees of LRCP&SI; MB BCh BAO in 1984, and subsequently obtained the postgraduate degree of MD at Trinity College, Dublin. He moved to the UK from Ireland in 1990 to further his career in surgery. In 1991, he was appointed as a consultant surgeon at Central Middlesex Hospital at the age of 31 and then moved to St. Mary's Hospital in 1994. His wife, Wendy, is Irish. They have two children, Freddie and Nina. ==Medical career== Darzi joined Imperial College London in 1994, obtained his Professorship in 1996 and became the Chair of Surgery and Head of Department in 1998. Darzi holds the Paul Hamlyn Chair of Surgery at Imperial College London and the Institute of Cancer Research. He is also an honorary consultant surgeon at St Mary's Hospital, and the Royal Marsden Hospital. He has held many senior administrative appointments within the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College, Research Council, Editorial Board of Scientific Journals, and medical royal colleges. Darzi was educated in Ireland, awarded an MD from Trinity College Dublin and the fellowships of essentially all the Royal Colleges of Surgeons in the British Isles (Ireland FRCSI, England FRCS, and both Scottish Colleges FRCSEd, FRCPSG). He also holds the fellowship of the American College of Surgeons and has been elected as a fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and more recently a foreign associate of the Institute of Medicine. From 2005 to 2008 he was president of Bath Institute of Medical Engineering (BIME). In December 2008 he received an honorary degree (Doctor of Engineering) from the University of Bath. In 2010 he was made a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, and an honorary fellow of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. Darzi's main clinical and academic interest is in minimally invasive surgery and allied technologies in which he and his team are internationally recognised. He leads a team of researchers covering a wide spectrum of engineering and basic sciences research topics including Medical Image Computing, Biomedical Engineering, Clinical Safety, surgical education and training at post-graduate and undergraduate levels and Robotics. He has published more than 800 peer review papers and authored, co-authored or edited several books. This work has received international recognition including the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Excellence in Higher and further education 2001, Hamdan Award for Medical Research Excellence in 2004.Hamdan Award for Medical Research Excellence, awarded by Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates In 2006 Darzi and his department were awarded the Rector's Research Excellence Award for their work on surgical robots. He has also delivered many named lectures around the globe. On 2 May 2013, Lord Darzi was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. Darzi is an enthusiastic advocate of Patient record access arguing that interested patients and carers, especially those accustomed to self-management of their condition, should take the lead in creating apps and other means of accessing records that are customised to the needs of patient groups. ==Political career== In December 2006 NHS London asked Darzi to \\"develop a strategy to meet Londoners' health needs over the next five to ten years\\" and so his report Healthcare for London: A Framework for Action was published on 11 July 2007. Largely implemented, it recommended the development of academic health science centres and the introduction of more primary services in one place: polyclinics. The plan for moving care from hospitals to GP-led polyclinics was not successful. Nick Clegg called it \\"the central imposition of a polyclinic on every primary care trust, regardless of the geography, demographics and clinical needs of the area\\". However, his call for trauma, acute stroke and heart attack services to be centralised in specialist units succeeded and has been widely copied. He was also National Advisor in Surgery to the Department of Health. Darzi's report in this role 'Saws and Scalpels to Lasers and Robots: Clinical case for change‚Äô (April 2007), argued for a change to the way surgery is organised to maximise patient benefits. On 29 June 2007 Darzi was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Health in the House of Lords at the Department of Health by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. He was duly raised to the peerage on 12 July 2007 as Baron Darzi of Denham, of Gerrards Cross in the County of Buckinghamshire.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/26287 His appointment was a small part of a political shift by government to incorporate more talents, with historical predecessors such as the Ministry of All the Talents: however, he only lasted two years in the post.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brown-completes- government-of-all-talents-with-team-of-outsiders-455341.html Darzi was tasked with leading a national review to plan the course of the NHS over a decade, reporting to the Prime Minister, Chancellor, and Secretary of State for Health in June 2008. He cooperated with the Department of Health to undertake the ‚ÄúNHS Next Stage Review‚Äù. Darzi was quoted in The Times as saying that \\"...This Review should be both led and evidence-based\\". The final report of the Review, High Quality Care for All, was published in June 2008 to considerable public and academic acclaim. The Financial Times stated that it was \\"the world's most ambitious attempt to raise the quality and effectiveness of an entire nation's healthcare\\". The Lancet said that: Through High Quality Care for All, academics suggested that Darzi has updated traditional notions of professionalism and described a new accountability in clinical practice. Following publication, Darzi remained in his ministerial post. He was associated with the plan to develop Polyclinics in England. The plan for moving care from hospitals to GP-led polyclinics was quietly reversed when the costs became apparent, but his call for trauma, acute stroke and heart attack services to be centralised in specialist units was seen as successful and was widely copied. In June 2009, Darzi was appointed as a member of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council. In July 2009, Darzi relinquished his post as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. The Prime Minister praised his \\"outstanding contribution\\" while The Guardian said that: Since 2018, Darzi has been leading the National Health Service‚Äôs Accelerated Access Collaborative.New chair appointed to improve patient access to innovation in the NHS Department of Health and Social Care, press release of June 19, 2018. Darzi resigned as a Labour peer on 9 July 2019 to sit as an independent, citing alleged tolerance of antisemitism by the party leadership. Labour rejected the claims on antisemitism as \\"false and offensive\\", pointing to the extra resources put into addressing cases, the number dealt with and the low number relative to Labour's membership. ===Armenian issues=== In October 2016 Darzi joined other prominent Armenians on calling the government of Armenia to adopt \\"new development strategies based on inclusiveness and collective action\\" and to create \\"an opportunity for the Armenian world to pivot toward a future of prosperity, to transform the post-Soviet Armenian Republic into a vibrant, modern, secure, peaceful and progressive homeland for a global nation.\\"; text also available at In November 2019, after the US House of Representatives recognized the Armenian Genocide, Darzi wrote in The Guardian that he \\"remain[s] dismayed by the British government‚Äôs refusal to acknowledge the slaughter of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians in a wave of violence that followed the fall of the Ottoman empire.\\" He added that it is \\"a source of intense pain and regret to me and my compatriots that our own government persists in denying the genocide out of fear of offending Turkey.\\" ==Global health and innovation== After July 2009, Lord Darzi returned to his clinical and academic work and has expanded his involvement in global health issues. In June 2010 he was appointed Chairman of the Institute for Global Health Innovation at Imperial College, a body dedicated to improving healthcare around the world and reducing health inequalities in developed and developing countries. In November 2010, under David Cameron, Darzi became a United Kingdom Global Ambassador for Health and Life Sciences; a role he continued until 2012. In 2012 the Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI) hosted the inaugural Global Health Policy Summit in London, during the London 2012 Olympic Games. This event brought together global healthcare leaders, academics and industry to debate key topics on global health and included a keynote address by Prime Minister David Cameron. In September 2013, Darzi was appointed by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson to lead a review of health and wellbeing and services in London. The London Health Commission which reported in October 2014 proposed the toughest measures seen in the UK to tackle the \\"obesity emergency\\" that leaves one in three 10-year-olds overweight or obese, including Ofsted-style ratings highlighting the best and worst schools at promoting healthy eating, and requiring chain restaurants to include \\"traffic light\\" calorie warnings on menus. He called for the Mayor to rewrite the London Plan to give borough councils greater protecting in banning takeaways from within 400m of the school gates. Also in 2013, Lord Darzi hosted the World Innovation Summit for Health in Doha, Qatar, under the Patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser al Missned and Qatar Foundation. This international event attracted more than one thousand delegates from industry, academic and the healthcare sector and world-renowned political and royal figures including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, His Royal Highness The Duke of York, Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco, HRH Princess Ghida Talal of Jordan and Princess Dina Mired of Jordan. He has also run training courses for doctors in Armenia and helped Armenian doctors come to London for clinical training. He has also performing several laparoscopic surgeries in Yerevan, and supplied hospitals in Armenia with equipment and surgical kits. ==Other activities== Darzi, along with Amal Clooney, was involved in the release of two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, from Myanmar on 7 May 2019. ===Corporate boards=== * Evelo Biosciences, Member of the Board of Directors (since 2018)Board of Directors Evelo Biosciences. * AbbVie, Member of the Advisory Board ===Non-profit organizations=== * Africa Research Excellence Fund (AREF), Member of the Advisory Panel (since 2015)Advisory Panel Africa Research Excellence Fund (AREF) . * Aurora Prize, Member of the Selection Committee (since 2015)Selection Committee Aurora Prize. * Duke Institute for Health Innovation (DIHI), Member of the Global Advisory BoardGlobal Advisory Board Duke Institute for Health Innovation (DIHI). * Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), Member * Foundation for Armenian Science and Technology (FAST), Member of the Advisory Board * Rangoon General Hospital Reinvigoration Charitable Trust, Member of the Board of Trustees * Qatar Foundation, Member of the Advisory Board * Sidra Medical and Research Center, Vice Chair of the Board of Governors ==Awards and honours== In 2002, Darzi was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his services to medicine and surgery and subsequently was created a Life Peer on 12 July 2007, as Baron Darzi of Denham, of Gerrards Cross in the County of Buckinghamshire. He was appointed to Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council in June 2009. Darzi was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2013.

A civic amenity site (CA site) or household waste recycling centre (HWRC) (both terms are used in the United Kingdom) is a facility where the public can dispose of household waste and also often containing recycling points. Civic amenity sites are run by the local authority in a given area. Collection points for recyclable waste such as green waste, metals, glass and other waste types (including WVO) are available. Items that cannot be collected by local waste collection schemes such as bulky waste are also accepted. In the United Kingdom, civic amenity sites are informally called \\"tips\\" or \\"dumps\\". In continental Europe, there are usually several types of collection sites: * sorted waste container stands: a group of containers of the most common recyclable household waste, such as plastics, paper, glass, metal cans, liquid packaging board, electrotechnical waste, recyclable clothing and so on. Such stands should be freely accessible by walking. They are often found near bus or tram stops, city squares, village commons, shops etc. A city or a country can have any colour convention to distinguish containers by type of waste. * waste collection courtyards: except for the mentioned household waste, they are specialized for large waste from citizens: furniture, construction waste, compostable gardening waste ‚Äì or special types of waste (chemical or other hazardous waste etc.). The waste is usually delivered by cars, vans or trucks and the station has an overseeing staff and opening hours, but services are free of charge. Smaller towns have one such site, cities can have more such courtyards in various neighbourhoods. * waste purchase stations: especially for metal scrap (iron and other metals), but also for paper, glass etc. Such stations have been in existence longer than modern disposal stations.

He was inspired by an appeal in a church magazine for missionaries to revive the Eastern Orthodox Church in Madagascar. There had been two Eastern Orthodox Churches in the country, mostly supported by Greek expatriates, but a military coup in 1972 had resulted in the expulsion of the clergy. Nectarios pleaded with his bishop (the Bishop of Adelaide) to let him go to Madagascar, but the bishop at first refused, saying that he was too useful to him where he was. Eventually, however, the bishop relented, saying that he knew Nectarios would just be miserable if he were forced to stay. Nectarios made contact with the publisher of the Greek magazine that contained the appeal, and asked who had written it, and was rather taken aback to learn that it was not an appeal from Eastern Orthodox Christians in Madagascar asking for a priest, but that the publisher himself had thought it would be a good idea. Nectarios realised that it would be pioneering missionary work. Nevertheless, he went to Madagascar, which is part of the Greek Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa. He made contact with the families who were looking after the church buildings, and took the son of one of the families with him on his missionary journeys, travelling around the island to villages where there seemed to be no churches, and arranging with the headman of the village to preach the gospel there if anyone was interested. In this way he established several parishes. He sent the young man who had first accompanied him to the theological seminary in Nairobi, and established a school and an orphanage. On 11 September 2004 he was killed in a helicopter crash along with Petros VII, Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa, and several other clergy. ==See also== * Eastern Orthodoxy in Madagascar ==References== Category:Eastern Orthodoxy in Madagascar Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Australia Category:Australian people of Greek descent Category:Christian missionaries in Madagascar Category:Australian Christian missionaries Category:2004 deaths Category:Victims of helicopter accidents or incidents Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Greece Category:Bishops of the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria Category:Year of birth missing Category:Australian expatriates in Madagascar Category:Eastern Orthodox missionaries ","title":"Nectarios Kellis"},{"id":"6229104","text":"Route 96 may refer to: *Melbourne tram route 96, Australia *OC Transpo Route 96, a bus rapid transit route in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada *Winnipeg Route 96, Canada *Route 96 (Iceland) *London Buses route 96, UK In the U.S.: *U.S. Route 96 *U.S. Route 96 (1926) *Alabama State Route 96 *Arizona State Route 96 *California State Route 96 *Georgia State Route 96 *Illinois Route 96 *Kentucky Route 96 *Maine State Route 96 *Maryland Route 96 (former) *Massachusetts Route 96 *Missouri Route 96 *New York State Route 96 *Ohio State Route 96 *Pennsylvania Route 96 *Rhode Island Route 96 *Tennessee State Route 96 *Utah State Route 96 *Virginia State Route 96 *Washington State Route 96 ==See also== *List of highways numbered 96 96 ","title":"Route 96"},{"id":"6229111","text":"Marion Tinsley Bennett (June 6, 1914 ‚Äì September 6, 2000) served as a member of the United States Congress, as a Judge of the United States Court of Claims and as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. ==Education and career== Born in Buffalo, Missouri on June 6, 1914 to Philip Allen Bennett and Mary Bertha (Tinsley) Bennett, he received his Artium Baccalaureus degree from Southwest Missouri State College (now Missouri State University) in 1935 and earned a Juris Doctor from Washington University School of Law in 1938, after which he entered private practice.

Churchill Forge Mill, situated in the Worcestershire village of Churchill, is one of the last water powered forge mills remaining in an intact state in the UK and as such is an important example of the industrial heritage of the West Midlands. Part of the site has been restored to working condition and is now maintained and operated by the Churchill Forge Trust. The article‚Äôs main details are drawn from the forge website ==History== Churchill Forge lies in the valley of the Ganlow Brook. In Mediaeval times it was dammed to provide a pond, from which a sluice led the water to turn the mill‚Äôs wheels. The earliest evidence of Churchill Forge is found in a charter dating from 1238 by which Robert de Hurcote granted Hugh Drugel \\"the whole land of Churchill, with the advowson of the church and the mill\\" on Hugh‚Äôs marriage with his sister Margery. Robert had paid twenty shillings to the Lord of Hagley for the settlement and a yearly rent to the Prior of Dudley for the mill. It changed hands at various times thereafter, and a blade mill and pool are mentioned in another account toward the end of the sixteenth century. The Bache family, who were responsible for developing the surviving brick mill during the nineteenth century, had long lived in the area and their descendants still own Churchill Forge. In the 18th century, William Bache (1743-1817) ran the nearby Stakenbridge Forge, just a few fields away, and his son William combined the businesses after marrying the daughter of the previous owner of Churchill Forge in 1796. Thereafter one or other of the family were in ownership, although some later entered the learned professions while keeping a share in the business.Nick Hildick-Smith, ‚ÄúChurchill Forge and the Bache Family‚Äù After World War 1, Benjamin Bache returned from working in a Stourbridge forge to re-open the one at Churchill after it had been closed due to shortage of manpower during the war. Together with his son Claude he commenced trading as \\"Benjamin Bache and Son, Spade, Blade, Shovel and Ladle Works\\". Claude Bache then carried on the business after his father‚Äôs death until he retired in 1969.A short cine file shot in 1964 showing Claude Bache at work can be viewed at YouTube At the head of the steps leading down to the mill, there is still an ornamental gate with the family name in plain block capitals running vertically down the centre. ==The working mill== The forge was used from 1700 onwards to produce edged agricultural tools such as spades, shovels, forks, rakes, hoes, and cultivator blades; it also catered to local industries with special shovels (known as skippets) for the nearby salt workings at Droitwich, and pouring ladles for the Stourbridge glass industry and the Black Country metal refineries. The main wheel driving the forge machinery in the present building has a diameter of 17 feet and is 5 feet 3 inches wide. It is mounted on an 18 foot cast iron axle which carries two of the original flywheels that once operated trip hammers. There is now a spur wheel which meshes with a smaller one and in turn powers a flat belt that drives various hammers, presses and other machines. A crank on the axle also operates a crocodile shear capable of cutting mild steel. An older wheel dating from the 19th century is 17 feet in diameter, but only 2 feet 3 inches wide. This has an oaken axle and was formerly used to power the furnace blower for the forge and two wet grindstones.Further details and drawings are available online In 1979 a small group, which included some of the Bache descendants, formed a preservation trust which became Churchill Forge Trust Limited in 1981. This has been responsible for keeping the building in repair and the machinery in working order. On various days the mill is open to visitors and can be seen in operation. ==References *Churchill Forge Mill web site Category:Buildings and structures in Worcestershire Category:Watermills in England Category:Tourist attractions in Worcestershire Category:Museums in Worcestershire Category:Industry museums in England Category:Wyre Forest District ","title":"Churchill Forge Mill"},{"id":"6229129","text":"Abilio dos Santos Diniz (born December 28, 1936) is a Brazilian businessman. He is the chairman of the board of directors of Pen√≠nsula Participa√ß√µes, chairman of the board of directors of BRF and member of the board of directors of both Carrefour Group and Carrefour Brasil. Through GPA, Diniz became one of the wealthiest individuals in Brazil. In 2016, Forbes ranked him 477th richest person in the world and 14th in Brazil. In 2009, √âpoca magazine named him one of the 100 most influential Brazilians of the year. He previously served as a partner of Companhia Brasileira de Distribui√ß√£o, a distribution company which owns the brands Varejo Alimentar, P√£o de A√ß√∫car and Extra, wholesaler Assa√≠, and appliance company Ponto Frio (Globex). He was also a shareholder of Casas Bahia, through Globex S/A. ==Early life and education== Diniz is the first of the six children born to Floripes Pires and Valentim Diniz. His father, Valentim, was born in 1913 in the countryside of Portugal, and immigrated to Brazil in November 1929. Diniz studied at Anglo-Latino school and Mackenzie high school. He graduated in 1956 from the School of Business Administration of Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas. In 1965, Diniz traveled to the United States to study Marketing at Ohio University and Economics at Columbia University, in New York. ==Career== Diniz's father, Valentim Diniz, founded the company P√£o de A√ß√∫car in September 1948. Abilio Diniz began to work for his father at Doceria P√£o de A√ß√∫car at the age of 12. In April 1959, the same year he graduated from FGV in Business Administration, he partnered with his father to create the first P√£o de A√ß√∫car supermarket store, located on Brigadeiro Luiz Ant√¥nio Avenue, in S√£o Paulo. In 1960, after the first store was established, Diniz traveled for four months throughout Europe and the United States to observe the operation of the retail sector abroad. The second P√£o de A√ß√∫car location on Maria Antonia Street, downtown S√£o Paulo, was established in 1963. One year later, P√£o de A√ß√∫car acquired Quiko and Tip Top supermarkets. During the 60's and 70's, Grupo P√£o de A√ß√∫car was the first supermarket chain to set up a store in a shopping mall (Iguatemi, in S√£o Paulo), to have a 24-hour pharmacy, and to set up a data processing center. Diniz studied the operations of Paris-based Carrefour in 1967 after Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira, who worked at P√£o de A√ß√∫car, introduced him to Carrefour cofounder Marcel Fournier. Diniz was a co-founder of the Brazilian Association of Supermarkets in 1968. Inspired by the Carrefour hypermarket model, Diniz founded Jumbo, the first hypermarket in Brazil, in Santo Andr√© in 1971. In 1976 he acquired Eletroradiobraz, the second largest chain of supermarkets and hypermarkets in Brazil at the time,. The company consisted of eight supermarkets, 26 hypermarkets, 16 stores and a warehouse. In 1979, Diniz moved away from P√£o de A√ß√∫car and became part of the National Monetary Council at the urging of the Minister of Planning, Mario Henrique Simonsen. There, he coordinated the production of economic bulletins. In 1989, Valentim asked Diniz to take over the leadership of P√£o de A√ß√∫car. Valentim remained part of the group's board of directors. In March 1990 the Collor government implemented an economic plan which put P√£o de A√ß√∫car on the verge of bankruptcy. Diniz implemented the practice \\"cut, concentrate and simplify\\" and made cuts across the company. He sold the building which had served as the company's headquarters since 1986 in 1992. The company, which had 626 stores in 1985, was reduced to 262 stores by 1992. However, family conflicts threatened the company. In an agreement signed in November 1993, Diniz was given the majority control of Grupo P√£o de A√ß√∫car. His parents received 36.5% of the company shares and his sister, Luc√≠lia, held 12% of the company shares. Diniz led Grupo P√£o de A√ß√∫car through an IPO in 1997 and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the first 100% national controlled company to conduct a global stock issue (in Brazil, the United States and Europe). In 1999, the French group Casino acquired 24.5% of the voting capital of the group for $854 500 million. In 2000, Diniz transitioned the company into Companhia Brasileira de Distribui√ß√£o, which became one of the largest retail chains in the country. In 2005, Diniz sold a large stake to the French company Casino Group for an estimated $860 million and stepped down as CEO, but remained as chairman. In 2009, in one of the most expensive transactions of the Brazilian business history, Grupo P√£o de A√ß√∫car bought Casas Bahia from Samuel Klein, giving Abilio control of P√£o de A√ß√∫car, Casas Bahia, Ponto Frio and Extra Hipermercados. In 2012, Casino Group took control of Grupo P√£o de A√ß√∫car and Diniz no longer had operational functions within the group but remained as chairman.New era dawns at P√£o de A√ß√∫car, Casino takes helm, Reuters, June 22, 2012 In 2003, Diniz became a member of the Economic and Social Development Council, a group of civil representatives which advise the President of the Republic of Brazil. In 2006, Diniz founded Pen√≠nsula Participa√ß√µes, an investment company created to manage the assets of the Diniz family through private and liquid investments. He later became the chairman of the company's board of directors. In April 2013, Diniz was elected as chairman of BRF, He helped lead the company through a broad restructuring. The company's profit went from R$700 million in 2012 to R$2.2 billion in 2014. The company's market value went from R$37 billion to R$55 billion.Kassai, Lucia (April 9, 2013). \\"Brasil Foods Names Diniz Chairman to Lead Growth\\". Bloomberg. Retrieved November 25, 2013. In September 2013, Diniz signed an agreement with his partner Jean-Charles Naouri to leave Grupo P√£o de A√ß√∫car. His shares were converted into voting privileges and he resigned from his position as chairman and the position was filled by Naouri.Cowley, Matthew & Winterstein, Paulo (September 6, 2013). \\"Brazil Businessman Diniz to Step Down as P√£o de A√ßucar Chairman\\".

In April 2015, Diniz announced he was wrapping up talks to raise his 5.07 percent stake in Carrefour and that he had shareholder support to take a seat on the board of the supermarket. Through Pen√≠nsula Participa√ß√µes, Diniz acquired 10% of the shares of Carrefour Brazil. Pen√≠nsula Participa√ß√µes continued to acquire shares of Carrefour, and by March 2016, it was the third largest global shareholder of the Carrefour chain. In 2017, it had 11.46% of the shares of Carrefour Brasil and 7.7% of Carrefour. Diniz serves on the group's board of directors. ==Writing== In 2004, Diniz released the book Caminhos e Escolhas ‚Äì O caminho para uma vida mais feliz (Paths and Choices ‚Äì Smart Choices for a Successful Life), which discusses major moments in his life and the transformations he went through as a result. In 2015, journalist Cristiane Correa wrote the book Abilio ‚Äì Determinado, Ambicioso, Pol√™mico (Determined, Ambitious, and Controversial), released by publisher Sextante, which details his life from childhood to becoming one of the biggest businessmen of Brazil. The book discussed Diniz's departure from Grupo P√£o de A√ß√∫car and his career after the departure. In October 2016, Diniz launched his second book, Novos Caminhos, Novas Escolhas (New Paths, New Choices), released by publisher Objetiva (Companhia das Letras Group), which discussed the transitions in his life over the previous 12 years. In March 2017 the French version of the book was released, and later an English version was sold in the American market. ==Controversies== In August 2011, Diniz was notified by the Federal Public Ministry of Brazil to give explanations in a criminal investigation. Diniz's next move was to then call criminal lawyer Marcio Thomaz Bastos, one of the most well-known criminal lawyers for those who had wealth.Brazil's GPA unable to account for payments to former minister, Reuters, July 8, 2015 At this time, Diniz was president of the board of directors for P√£o de A√ß√∫car. During the 2010 elections, the offices of Bastos had helped Diniz pay 5.5 million reais, to congressman Antonio Palocci to help fund the presidential campaign of Dilma Rousseff.Auditoria do P√£o de A√ß√∫car diz que Palocci recebeu R$ 5,5 mi sem prestar servi√ßo, Epoca Globo, June 19, 2015 After the discovery of contracts, drafts, notes, emails and other internal documents by TIME story, which all aimed to justify the payments to Palocci, the company GPA decided to establish an audit team to investigate the money given to Palocci in attempt to set things right. Two months after this, the audit team found no evidence that states Palocci aided the group whatsoever, giving the notion of corruption in this particular case.Soup√ßon de corruption pour Abilio Diniz, LSA Conso, July 10, 2015 ==Kidnapping== In December 1989, Diniz was the victim of a sensational political kidnapping, followed by a police rescue. He was confined for six days in a small space under a house, with a duct leading to the kitchen fan as his only source of oxygen. The kidnapping took place in the morning of the Brazilian presidential elections in Brazil in 1989. Among the kidnappers were Canadians David Spencer and Christine Lamont, who were students at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. Lamont and Spencer denied any participation in the kidnapping, but their participation was proved when a secret weapons cache in Managua exploded (among the material exposed by the explosion were documents that linked both Lamont and Spencer to the Diniz kidnapping). Faced with these revelations, Lamont admitted that they had been involved in the kidnapping. Lamont and Spencer were sentenced to 28 years in prison for their involvement, but were kept in private cells, away from the mass of the prison population. The Canadian press and public started a major movement to secure their release, straining relations between Brazil and Canada. However, two Canadian investigative journalists, Isabel Vincent of The Globe and Mail and Caroline Mallan of the Toronto Star, wrote books concluding that Lamont and Spencer were likely guilty, and they were being treated well by Brazilian authorities. Lamont confessed to involvement in the kidnapping, which was meant to raise money for Sandinista guerrillas, and the two were released and deported to Canada in 1996. ==See also== *List of kidnappings *List of solved missing persons cases ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Isabel Vincent, See no evil.

Its population is around 9,319. ==History== Numerous archeological finds from various epochs bear witness to the ancient past of Isola Vicentina. These finds include pottery dating back to the Iron Age, a column with an inscription in a Venetian language, a Roman tombstone, and several Lombardic tombs. It is evident from these discoveries that the territory where Isola Vicentina now lies was already very important in very ancient times. This was due mainly to its geographical position along important roads to Vicenza and Schio. The earliest written record in which we find Isola Vicentina mentioned dates back to 753 A.D. During the Middle Ages, the territory was owned first by the bishop, later by the Conti family (until the twelfth century), and finally by the Da Vivaro family. The area was repeatedly the scene of conflict between the powerful ruling families of the day. All of the territory of Vicenza, including Isola Vicentina, became part of the Venetian Republic in the fifteenth century. Several centuries of peace followed, to be interrupted only by the arrival of Napoleon‚Äôs troops in the late eighteenth century. Isola Vicentina was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866, along with the rest of the Veneto Region. ==Arts== Villa Branzo Loschi-Drago in Vallugana is an eighteenth-century building that was designed by architect Domenico Cerato. Villa Cerchiari. ==Churches== *The Isola Vicentina Parish Church is dedicated to St. Peter. It is a very old church, and is thought to have been founded by St. Prosdocimus. It is mentioned in records from as early as the thirteenth century as being the parish church. Throughout the centuries, it has been renovated various times, and was completely rebuilt in the latter part of the nineteenth. *The Sanctuary of Santa Maria del Cengio is without doubt the most famous church in Isola Vicentina. It is also a very old church. We find it mentioned for the first time in records from the twelfth century, although it probably existed even earlier than that as a shelter for wayfarers and pilgrims. The church building was renovated and given to the monks at San Brigida in the early fifteenth century. It served to house the monks until the monastery could be built. In 1462, the Lateranense canons from San Bartolomeo di Vicenza took over the church. The fifteenth-century style of the building has been preserved in spite of the numerous changes that have been made to it. ==Twin towns== Isola Vicentina is twinned with: * M√ºhlhausen, Upper Palatinate, Germany, since 1998 * Marau, Brazil, since 2012 Category:Cities and towns in Veneto ","title":"Isola Vicentina"},{"id":"6229152","text":"Baron Marley, of Marley in the County of Sussex, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

They were not named after the American television programme Hullabaloo. Their name came from the city of Hull, England, whence they hailed. The band consisted of Geoffrey Mortimer (bass guitar and harmonies, born 1945), Harry Dunn (drums and harmonies, born December 1947, Kingston upon Hull), Ricky Knight (lead singer and rhythm guitar, born Ronald Mitchell, 1944) and Andy Woonton (lead guitar and harmonies, born Andrew Charles Wooton, 19 July 1943, London). They all sang harmony vocals. The group's look (featuring long dyed blonde hair) and music was put together by Luigi Creatore and Hugo Peretti of Roulette Records to take advantage of the popularity in the United States of British Invasion bands. Signed to Roulette in the US, their UK records appeared on the Columbia label. They made numerous television appearances, most notably the Hullabaloo show. They recorded two albums: England's Newest Singing Sensations and On Hullabaloo (both 1965). Both albums are now available on a single CD. Their music was reminiscent of Buddy Holly. The group split up soon after they started. Knight left first and was replaced for a short time by Mick Wayne (born Michael Wayne, 1945, Kingston upon Hull -- died 24 June 1994) but the group broke up for good in 1966. In May 2010, original members Knight, Dunn, and Woonton re-united for one-off concert. Mortimer was unable to attend. On 17 December 2016, Geoffrey Mortimer died from cancer, at the age of 71.

Avram's development of the MARC format in the late 1960s and early 1970s at the Library of Congress had a revolutionizing effect on the practice of librarianship, making possible the automation of many library functions and the sharing of bibliographic information electronically between libraries using pre-existing cataloging standards. ==Early years== Henriette Regina Davidson was born in Manhattan on October 7, 1919, to a father who was a watch material distributor and a mother who was a Philadelphia Ledger reporter. Although she never intended to become a librarian, Henriette did spend many Saturdays of her childhood reading in neighborhood stores, which, at that time, housed mini-public libraries. Henriette Davidson dreamed of finding a cure for cancer, which was prevalent in her family. She therefore majored in pre-medicine at Hunter College. In 1941, she married Herbert Mois Avram, who was enlisted in the Navy. By the end of World War II, Herbert Avram was a decorated Lieutenant Commander who had been assigned to both the Atlantic and Pacific Theatres. The Avrams had three children: Marcie, Lloyd, and Jay, and maintained residence in New York until 1951, when Herbert Avram took a job with the National Security Agency in Washington, D.C. Herbert Avram would also work for the CIA, eventually becoming a pioneer in the digital court reporting industry, which developed Closed Captions for television. == Career beginnings == The couple moved first to Arlington, and later to Silver Spring. Once settled in Virginia, Avram left her life of homemaking behind. She began studying mathematics at George Washington University, and joined the NSA herself in 1952. Working with the IBM 701, she soon became one of the first computer programmers. Reminiscing about her time with the NSA, Avram said, \\"Learning programming in those days was ... a bootstrap operation. You were on your own with far less than perfect tools to learn from ... and the numbers of people that made it through to become programmers were few indeed. It was an exciting time.\\" In the early sixties she moved to the private sector, working first with the American Research Bureau and later for a software company, Datatrol Corporation. Both jobs consisted of systems analysis and programming, but it was at Datatrol that Avram had her first professional experience with libraries. Asked to design a computer science library, she quickly read several library science text books in order to learn the appropriate jargon. She also hired a librarian to assist her in the design process. It was through this project that Avram was introduced to the Library of Congress Card Division Service. She also did consulting work with Frederick Kilgour, father of the Online Computer Library Center, on OCLC's first attempt at computerizing bibliographic information. In March 1965, Avram heard of an opening at the Library of Congress, and was hired as a systems analyst in the Office of the Information Systems Specialist. == Library of Congress == Avram, considered a \\"librarian by achievement\\" by the American Library Association (ALA), owed much to the Library of Congress, about which she said, \\"... when I speak of and refer to it as 'the Great Library,' I do so with sincerity and appreciation for everything that I learned within those walls.\\" Avram was often noted for her petite stature, New York accent, and indefatigable drive. She was also an adept leader. \\"She was able to foster a cooperative spirit among the computer specialists and librarians on her staff. In her typical fashion, she stepped into the world of libraries and learned libraries' problems, adopting them as her own.\\" Her first assignment at the Library of Congress (LC) was to analyze cataloging data for computer processing. In keeping with her training at NSA, where she learned \\"the prime necessity of thoroughly understanding the subject before tackling the computer solution,\\" Avram, along with two librarians, began this process by examining the information contained in a catalog record. A separate mathematical algorithm would be needed for each piece of information, and there were millions of items in the catalog, in hundreds of different languages. She also studied ALA rules and LC filing rules to learn all that she could about bibliographic control. When Avram had thoroughly examined every aspect of the bibliographic record, \\"she translated what she learned into a set of fields ... bearing a name (the tags), handling instructions (the indicators), and parts (the subfields).\\" Avram's title at LC changed to Assistant Coordinator of Information Systems in 1967. In this position, she continued to direct the MARC Pilot Project, which concluded in June 1968; she directed the MARC Distribution Service, which began in March 1969; and she began the RECON Pilot Project, which was never completed. The RECON Project was a plan to convert retrospective materials to MARC format. Because this project was not embraced by LC, retrospective conversion has taken place across the country, rather than as a nationwide coordinated effort. Avram said, \\"This failure has severely impacted all libraries.\\" She also called lack of support for RECON the \\"single most disappointing experience\\" of her career. Avram became a part of the development of the International Standard for Bibliographic Description for Monograph Publications (ISBD(M)) when she attended an International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts sponsored by the International Federation of Library Association (IFLA) in 1969. A year later, Avram became Chief of MARC Development Office at LC. She continued to head the MARC and RECON projects, but was also responsible for all of the automation involved with LC's processing activities. Her duties further expanded when she became the Director of the Network Development Office in 1976. She was then in charge of coordinating library networking and bibliographic resources and standards at both the national and international levels. In addition, she became chair of the LC Network Advisory Committee, a position which she held for over a decade. At this time she was also chair of the IFLA Working Group on Content Designators, which used the ISBD to develop the international version of MARC format known as UNIMARC. By 1980 Avram was directing a staff of seven hundred in the Processing Department of LC. In her position as the first Director for Processing Systems, Networks and Automation Planning, she was responsible for networking, automation activities, and bibliographic products and services. When Avram became the Assistant Librarian for Processing Services three years later, her staff doubled. She was now in charge of cataloging, acquisitions, overseas operations, and development of networking and automation planning. This position lasted for six years. In speaking of her decision to remain with LC, despite other, more lucrative opportunities, Avram said, \\"I stayed because I loved the place, the people, and the challenge.\\" When she retired from LC in 1992, Avram was the Associate Librarian for Collections Services. Her staff of seventeen hundred was responsible for acquisitions, cataloging, preservation, collection development, overseas operations, network and automation planning, and processing and servicing special format materials. == MARC == MARC, MAchine-Readable Cataloging, is the method by which paper-and-ink card catalogs were converted to computer catalogs. This automated library systems, in turn greatly enhancing the feasibility of interlibrary lending and paving the way for networking capabilities. Avram was a key figure in the revolution of librarianship into information science. MARC, in her words, is \\"an assemblage of formats, publications, procedures, people, standards, systems, equipment, etc., that has evolved over the years stimulating the development of library automation and information networks ... nationally and internationally.\\" MARC has had many incarnations through the years, from the initial Planning Memorandum Number Three, which resulted from that first catalog card analysis at LC, to MARC 1 (as the format was subsequently named after the MARC Pilot System, November 1966-October 1967), and eventually to MARC 21, the format that is used today. Avram is the author of the book, MARC, its history and implications, published by the Library of Congress in 1975. In order to ensure that MARC would be adopted nationwide, she worked with the American Library Association and the American National Standards Institute to make it a national standard. Not content with earning the national standard in 1971, Avram continued lobbying until MARC became an International Organization for Standardization standard in 1973. Largely due to her efforts, MARC is now used as the basis for library automation and bibliographic communication throughout the world. Avram was also one of the original planners of the Linked Systems Project. In this role, she was \\"tireless in spreading the gospel of using international standards to link databases housed on disparate computer systems.\\" Though she never intended to be a librarian, Avram became a \\"towering figure in library automation and bibliographic control.\\" ==Retirement== After retirement, Avram and her husband moved to California, Maryland. The couple remained active through St. Mary's College, where Henriette often arranged for Library of Congress officials to be guest speakers. After Herbert, her husband of sixty-four years, died in their home on January 15, 2006, Henriette relocated to Florida. She died of cancer at Miami's Baptist Hospital on April 22, just three months after the death of her husband. She was 86 years old. Avram once said, Her energetic, diplomatic leadership and remarkable contribution to automation and bibliographic control are proof that she achieved this goal. Though proud of her accomplishments, Avram's famous drive never quit. \\"We must not sit back and be satisfied, though,\\" she said, \\"there is much more to do.\\" ==Awards and honors== *1971 Margaret Mann Citation in Cataloging and Classification from the American Library Association * 1974 Federal Women's Award *1977 Honorary Doctorate of Science from Southern Illinois University *1979 Academic/Research Librarian of the Year from the Association of College and Research Libraries *1980 Achievement in Library and Information Technology Award from Library and Information Technology Association *1981 Melvil Dewey Medal from the American Library Association *1986 Appreciation Award from the National Central Library of Taipei, Taiwan *1987 Honorary Fellow of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions *1988 Joseph W.

The speech constitutes an Athenian response to a letter of Philip II of Macedon, with which the King of Macedon proposed the amendment of the most important term of the Peace of Philocrates (\\"each side should keep the territory possessed at the moment of the official conclusion of the peace treaty\\"). In exchange he offered to the Athenians the island of Halonnesus. The orator rejects Philip's demands and proposes instead the mediation of arbitrator, in order to settle their differences. Libanius, who wrote 57 hypotheses or introductions to Demosthenes' orations predicates that On the Halonnesus does not belong to Demosthenes, but to Hegesippus, another prominent member of the anti-Macedonian faction.

Organised as a holding company, it provides freight by rail and road as well as passenger services. Its administration is located in Windhoek. ==History== A first local railway was constructed in 1895 by the Damaraland Guano Company for commercial purposes. The first public railway, and the core of the present system, was constructed by the German Colonial government. The 383 km connection between Swakopmund and Windhoek was inaugurated on June 19, 1902. The German colonial railway was taken over by the Railways of South Africa after World War I, and linked into the network of South Africa. After the independence of Namibia, TransNamib took control of the national rail network. ==Operations== TransNamib operated 2,883 km of rail in 1995. Since then, further track has been added to the network through the Northern Extension. It operates on Cape gauge. While focus has been primarily on freight services, passenger services are an important component of TransNamib and provided under the Starline logo.

After the pogroms following the May Laws, he helped found the Hovevei Zion in Warsaw, and convinced Baron Edmond James de Rothschild to financially support a settlement called Ekron (now Mazkeret Batya). Mohilever was made the Rabbi of Bia≈Çystok in 1883. He dedicated himself to promote Zionism by convincing Bia≈Çystok's Jews to move to Petah Tikva, then a struggling settlement. In 1884, Mohilever was elected to the presidency of the Hovevei Zion conference, with Leon Pinsker serving as chairman. Mohilever served as chairman in the 1887 and 1889 conferences. Many of his contributions were of a religious nature - Mohilever insured that Jewish farming in Palestine complied with Jewish laws and tradition by setting up a rabbinical committee to oversee it. In 1893 there were a series of differences between Rabbi Mohilever and the main offices of Chovevei L'Tzion in Odessa, which was largely secularist and directed by Leo Pinsker. This led to a decision for Chovevei L'Tzion to make another Centre under Mohilever's leadership. This new branch, was named Mizrachi, (A Hebrew abbreviation of merkaz ruhani ‚Äì \\"spiritual centre\\"). Their task was to educate orthodox Jews about the concept of Zionism. But despite the religious differences, Rabbi Mohilever made the wise decision to remain part of the Chovevei L'Tzion movement. Nonetheless, Mohilever put constant pressure on the national movement to meet with the requirements of the Orthodox Jews. In 1897 Mohilever sent a message to the First Zionist Congress: 'It is essential', he wrote, 'that the Congress unite all \\"Sons of Zion\\" who are true to our cause to work in complete harmony and fraternity, even if there be among them differences of opinion regarding religion.' Rabbi Mohilever and his colleagues continued their work, especially among Orthodox Jews, and as a result, Mizrachi became the foundation of the religious Zionist movement. In 1902, four years after Rabbi Shmuel‚Äôs death, Mizrachi officially joined the Zionist Organization. When in 1901 Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines and other of Mohilever's disciples re-established the organization, they did so with the same stance, spirit and name. Mohilever had successfully inspired the amalgamation of traditional Jewish orthodoxy with practical Zionism.Arthur Hertzberg, The Zionist Idea, (Meridian, New York, 1960), p.400-402. His last letter to the Jews of Russia before his death urged them to work to achieve a deep attachment to the commandment to settle in Israel, which he said is ‚Äúthe foundation of the existence of our people.‚Äù The kibbutz Gan Shmuel was named after Mohilever. Mohilever was active in the propagandist and organizational affairs as well as labors on behalf of colonization in Palestine. As early as 1882, he went to Paris to meet a young Baron Edmond de Rothschild, and convinced him to take an interest in the struggling settlers in Israel. With the help of Rabbi Mohilever, Rothschild stayed and was the single greatest benefactor of Zionist work there. ==References== *Isidor Schalit, obituary of Shmuel Mohilever, Die Welt II/24, June 17, 1898, pp. 2‚Äì3 *David Bridger, Samuel Wolk: The New Jewish Encyclopedia.

Founded in 1831 by Mother Catherine Spalding, foundress of the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, it is the oldest school in continuous operation in Louisville. ==History== Mother Catherine Spalding founded Presentation in 1831. The school began in a rented house, but in October of the same year moved to its own building on Fourth Street where it would remain for over fifty years. Presentation was the second school founded in Louisville. A public school effort started in 1828 quickly failed due to lack of funds, and thus Presentation became the oldest school in continuous operation in the city. The school expanded, and in 1891 NLBI, the corporate arm of the religious community operating Presentation, bought a lot and house at the corner of Fourth and Breckenridge for $35,000. In June 1892, arrangements were made to replace the house, which had been built in 1867 by Thomas Jacobs, with a new building designed by D. X. Murphy. The building was to cost approximately $66,000. A gym and auditorium were added in 1938 and another class room addition to the rear was made in 1948. The school initially offered primary and secondary education, but closed the elementary section in 1945 to accommodate an increasing enrollment in the all-girls secondary school. The building features a distinctive Richardsonian Romanesque tower, which was rebuilt after a fire in 1977. It was designed by D.X. Murphy, who also designed the famous twin-spired clubhouse at Churchill Downs.; \\"The Tower:Special 175th Anniversary Edition\\", p.5 The building was listed in 2004 as one of Louisville's Ten favorites, according to the Courier-Journal. Generations of students have signed their names to the interior walls of the tower. Enrollment was consistently around 800 students during the 1950s and 1960s, but by 1993 it had dropped to just 230 students, and the school was over $760,000 in debt. It was announced that the doors would close in May 1995. However, a successful grassroots campaign by alumnae, students, and parents paid off the debt; and the Sisters of Charity relinquished control of the school to nearby Spalding University. The school became independent again in 2004, after becoming financially stable with a $6.2 million budget, and created its own Board of Trustees. In 2006 the school purchased a property across the street to serve as the current location of an Arts and Athletic CenterArts and Athletic Center that replaced the past gym/auditorium (built in 1938 and now owned by Spalding University). Construction of this new $5 million building at 900 South Fourth Street, cattycorner to the existing campus, formally began with the ground breaking on May 5, 2008.\\"The Tower\\" Winter 2009 On Friday, January 23, 2009, Presentation Academy marked the placement of the final beam in the Arts and Athletic Center with a\\"Topping Off\\" ceremony. The center was dedicated on September 13, 2009, and awarded the Best New Landmark of 2009 by www.brokensidewalk.com.\\"The Tower\\" Winter/Spring 2010 The Tower ==Traditions== A long-standing tradition allows only seniors to use the front carpeted staircase. The front entrance is used by freshmen on their first day at Pres and by seniors on their last day. Also on their last day of school, seniors sign their names on the inside of the Tower. Presentation's annual Walk-A-Thon is held every fall to raise money for students in need of financial assistance. Each year has a different theme and a different T-shirt designed by a student. After money is raised and a pep rally is held, the girls walk three miles around downtown Louisville to show their school spirit. ==Campus== Because Presentation Academy is located near the heart of Downtown Louisville, the students have after-school access to 4th Street Live!, the Main Library, and various Spalding University resources. Field trips are usually taken on foot, such as to The Courier-Journal building, the Louisville Hall of Justice, the Muhammad Ali Center, and the Frazier History Museum. Presentation's Arts and Athletic Center The new $5 million, 29,600-square-foot Arts and Athletic CenterArts and Athletic Center opened in August 2009, replaced the 1938 gymnasium, and houses the school's arts programs and Topper athletic teams. Designed by Gil Stein & Associates and built by Whittenberg Construction Co., the facility is a result of Tower Vision, Presentation Academy's first capital campaign. The Arts and Athletic center contains a 700-seat gymnasium, 300-seat auditorium, art & dance studios, and offices. ==Uniform== Like many other private schools, Presentation Academy has a dress code. Uniform shirts include the white polo, white oxford, and light blue polo. The navy blue vest, v-neck sweater, and pants may be worn, as can the original navy blue skirt or the new plaid skirt. Presentation also has the winter uniform, a navy blue jacket and pants set that may be worn during the colder months. ==Sports== Presentation offers archery, volleyball, field hockey, soccer, cross country, golf, cheer leading, lacrosse, dance, basketball, swimming, softball, track, and tennis.Tower Yearbook 2009 ==Clubs== Extracurricular activities include the Interact Club, Book Club, Student Council, Believe Club, Language and Culture Club, STEAM Club, Math and Robotics Club, ATL Ushers, Podcasting Club, Environmental Club, Y Club (KYA/KUNA), National Honor Society, National Art Honor Society, Science National Honor Society, International Thespian Society, Bowling Club, Mission Club, Drama Club, Anime Club, St. Joseph of Arimathea Society, Governor's Cup, and Prezettes.

All three buildings are step- like and triangular shaped, built in a circle so it always visually appears than one is between the other two. Buildings, styled Rudo 1, Rudo 2 and Rudo 3, were settled in 1976, but never fully completed, as the facade wasn't finished.

In Harlequin he is involved in battle in Brittany and subsequently at the Battle of Cr√©cy. The archers are the first soldiers to be deployed along the crest of the hill at Cr√©cy, providing cover before the battle starts for the knights building a system of ditches, pits and caltrops below to maim and bring down the enemy cavalry. The battle is a decisive victory for the English, even though they were outnumbered. It is after this battle that Thomas' family's links to the Grail come to the attention of the King and in Vagabond he is sent back to England to discover its whereabouts and becomes involved in the Scottish invasion of 1347. He soon discovers that his cousin, Guy Vexille, is working with powerful figures within the Catholic Church in France to discover the Grail for their own ends.

Like all the eels of the genus Anguilla and the family Anguillidae, it is catadromous, meaning it spawns in the sea, but lives parts of its life in fresh water. The spawning area of this species is in the North Equatorial Current in the western North Pacific to the west of the Mariana Islands. The larvae are called leptocephali and are carried westward by the North Equatorial Current and then northward by the Kuroshio Current to East Asia, where they live in rivers, lakes, and estuaries. The Japanese eel is an important food fish in East Asia, where it is raised in aquaculture ponds in most countries in the region. In Japan, where they are called unagi, they are an important part of the food culture, with many restaurants serving grilled eel, which is called kabayaki. ==Life history and habitat== Japanese eel The Japanese eel and other anguillid eels live in fresh water and estuaries where they feed and grow as yellow eels for a number of years before they begin to mature and become silver eels. The silver eels then migrate out of fresh water into the ocean and start their long journey to their spawning area. Adult Japanese eels migrate thousands of kilometers from freshwater rivers in East Asia to their spawning area without feeding. The spawning area of this species was discovered in 1991 by collecting small leptocephali about 10 mm in size, and then in 2005 the same team of Japanese scientists at the University of Tokyo found a more precise location of spawning based on genetically identified specimens of newly hatched preleptocephali only 2 to 5 days old in a small area near the Suruga Seamount to the west of the Mariana Islands (14‚Äì17¬∞ N, 142‚Äì143¬∞ E). Since then, more pre-leptocephali have been collected at sea, and even Japanese eel eggs have been collected and genetically identified on the research vessel. The collections of eggs and recently hatched larvae have been made along the western side of the seamount chain of the West Mariana Ridge. Mature adults of the Japanese eel and giant mottled eel were captured using large midwater trawls in 2008 by Japanese scientists at the Fisheries Research Agency. The adults of the Japanese eel appear to spawn in the upper few hundred meters of the ocean, based on the recent catches of their spawning adults, eggs, and newly hatched larvae. The timing of catches of eggs and larvae and the ages of larger larvae have shown that Japanese eels only spawn during the few days just before the new moon period of each month during their spawning season. After hatching in the ocean, the leptocephali are carried westward by the North Equatorial Current and then northward by the Kuroshio Current to East Asia. In the open ocean, the larvae feed on marine snow, before they metamorphose into the glass eel stage. The glass eels then enter the estuaries and headwaters of rivers and many travel upstream. In fresh water and estuaries, the diet of yellow eels consists mainly of shrimp, other crustaceans, aquatic insects, and small fishes. The Japanese eel population, along with anguillid eel populations worldwide, have declined drastically in recent years, presumably due to a combination of overfishing and habitat loss or changing water conditions in the ocean interfering with spawning and the transport of their leptocephali. In the case of the Japanese eel, spawning is likely affected by the north-south shifts of a salinity front created by an area of low-salinity waters resulting from tropical rainfall. The front is thought to be detected by the adult spawning eels and to affect the latitudes at which they spawn. A northward shift in the front that occurred over the past 30 years appears to have occurred, which could cause more larvae to be retained in eddies offshore in the region east of Taiwan, and southward shifts in the salinity front have been observed in recent years that could increase southward transport into the Mindanao Current that flows into the Celebes Sea. These types of unfavorable larval transport are thought to reduce the recruitment success of the Japanese eels that reach river mouths as glass eels. ==Commercial fisheries== Total production of Japanese eel in thousands of tonnes as reported by the FAO, 1950‚Äì2010Based on data sourced from the FishStat database, FAO. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" - !

Line 3) The MF 67 is a fleet of steel-wheel electric multiple unit trains for the Paris M√©tro. The first MF 67 trains entered service on Line 3 in June 1968, and became one of the biggest orders for the M√©tro, with 1,482 cars constructed. The need to replace the Sprague- Thomson fleet, as well as increasing costs associated with the later-cancelled plan to introduce rubber-tyred trains on all M√©tro lines, were the main factors for the size of the order. At its peak, during the late-1980s and the early-1990s, the MF 67 operated on eight of the (then) fifteen M√©tro lines (Lines 2, 3 and 3bis, 5, 7bis, 9, 10 and 12): the MF 67 also operated on Lines 7, 8 and 13 (including the old Line 14), all before the introduction of the MF 77 in 1978. Many of the MF 67 trains have been removed from service: throughout 1994, the MF 88 displaced the MF 67 from Line 7bis, and from 2008 to 2016, the MF 01 replaced the MF 67 on Lines 2, 5, and 9. The MF 67 remains in service on Lines 3, 3bis, 10 and 12, where the √éle-de-France Mobilit√©s intends to replace the remaining MF 67 trains with new trains provisionally known as the MF 19 (fr). ==Conception== It was originally envisioned by the RATP to convert all Metro lines to rubber-tyred pneumatic operation. However, this plan was later abandoned due to high costs, which in turn, would have prolonged the service of the aging Sprague-Thomson trainsets to 80 years. Therefore, a new class of steel-wheel rolling stock was developed. During the development phase, the MF 67 was known as the MF 65. ==Series== The MF 67 actually comprises seven different series; however, two series of these trains were prototypes. *Series A (now retired): 200 cars (40 trains) were delivered to Lines 3 and 9 between 1967‚Äì1969 **One train in this series was the Z√©bulon, a stainless-steel prototype that never saw passenger service. It was used as a training train for many years, until it succumbed to heavy vandalism in 2010. All cars except for one driving car were scrapped as of 2011. *Series B (now retired): 6 cars were delivered in 1968 as prototype trains that never saw commercial service. *Series C (now retired): 340 cars (68 trains) delivered to Lines 3 and 7 between 1972 and 1975. *Series CX (now retired): 16 prototype cars that were fitted with \\"plug\\" type door openers, similar to that of the MF 77. These ran on Line 9. *Series D: 363 cars that were originally deployed to Lines 3, 5, and 9 between 1973 and 1975. They now operate on Lines 3, 3bis, 10, and 12. *Series E (now retired): 56 trains that were originally deployed to Lines 2, 7bis, and 8 between 1974 and 1976. Many trains were replaced by the MF 01 cars between 2009 and 2011, though some were displaced much earlier by the MF 88 cars to Line 10. The trains operating on Line 10 were retired between 2014 and 2016. Five trains were retained for training in the USFRT tunnel, replacing the Zebulon, but they were retired in 2017. *Series F (now retired): 51 trains that were originally deployed to Lines 7 and 13 between 1975 and 1978. They were redeployed to Line 5. Despite being the youngest series, they have suffered from excessive wear and tear, as well as weather impacts sustained from being stored in the outdoor Bobigny depot. They were replaced by the MF 01 cars between 2011 and 2013. ==Technical specifications== * Train-sets delivered: 297 (1482 cars including 9 in reserve) * Configuration: M+R+M+R+M (except 3bis M+R+M) * Length: (all motor coach), (trailers) * Maximum width: * Power: (12 traction motors on twin-motor bogie) or (6 traction motors on single-motor bogie) * Braking: rheostatic brake and electric brake on the series E and F * Bogies: single or twin with pneumatic suspension on the series E and F * Maximum speed: * Authorized speed: * Doors: 4 doors by vis-√†-vis manual opening, opening of * Air-conditioning: None ==Service trains== The MF 67 service train Currently, the RATP uses a string of MF-67 \\"Auteuil Convoy\\" trains (retired MF 67C trainsets from Line 2 in four car compositions), to supply the Auteuil and Vaugirard Depots, these trains are colored yellow and brown and serve as auxiliary equipment of the work of the RATP (VMI).

Canon William Turnbull, who was vicar at the church 1855‚Äì1915, while the stainless steel weathervane on top of the tower, in the shape of a fish, was a handmade gift from local resident; Arnold Lesley Smith (1916‚Äì1986), in 1975. The fish is an early Christian symbol and its stainless steel represents local industry. The church windows contain a large amount of stained glass, much of it many hundreds of years old. New glass has been installed, most notably in 1992, to celebrate the 600th anniversary of Penistone Grammar School. The church tower has two clockfaces ‚Äì one on the west side, and another on the south side. The tower holds a total of 8 bells. In 2006 the church was the location of a service attended by Mayors and civic heads from across Yorkshire as part of the Yorkshire Day celebrations being hosted in Penistone. The same year saw the creation of a new Heritage and Sensory Gardens (St Johns Gardens) in the lower end of the church yard, including millstones with historical local dates and a memorial to Nicholas Saunderson, who was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University.

This experience prompts him to realise that his anti-metahuman prejudice is excessive when he is given the file on the deaths of Grace's parents and acknowledges that the circumstances suggest an accident rather than a deliberate attack. However, he is killed by the future version of Grace, who has become consumed by her vendetta. * Sarah Carter portrays an adult Grace Gibbons, also known as Cicada II. After Orlin is cured, the adult Grace appears as a new Cicada, having traveled back in time from a future where metahumans thrive to complete what she believes is still her uncle's mission. She shares her uncle's powers in addition to energy manipulation. She originally adopted Orlin's hatred of metahumans after overhearing him while in her comatose state, but when Orlin reveals his change of heart and tries to get his niece to abandon her plan, Grace kills him. She develops a plan to weaponize S.T.A.R. Labs' metahuman cure so it would kill all metahumans rather than just curing them. Grace's future self is erased from existence when the Flash destroys Cicada's dagger with a mirror gun, while her younger self awakens from her coma, abandons her anti-metahuman feelings, takes the cure, and is placed in foster care. * Chris Webb portrays David Hersch, the original timeline version of Cicada and someone that The Flash, Green Arrow, Supergirl, and the Legends all failed to catch. In fact, Hersch exists as Cicada across the multiverse, with Sherloque Wells having captured him on 37 different Earths. However, with XS inadvertently altering Earth-1's timeline at the end of season four, Dwyer becomes Cicada instead while Hersch was apprehended by the police for serial bombing. == References  External links == *Hyperborea entry for Cicada *Crimson Lightning ‚Äì An online index to the comic book adventures of the Flash.

He worked in the Portuguese consular service and was stationed at Newcastle upon Tyne from late 1874 until April 1879; from then until 1888 he was at Bristol. During this period he published O Primo Bas√≠lio (\\"Cousin Bazilio\\") and Os Maias (\\"The Maias\\"), but he was also writing occasional London letters for the Lisbon daily newspaper Di√°rio de Not√≠cias. Some of these afterwards appeared in book form as Cartas de Inglaterra. The collection was published in English in 1970 as Letters from England with a translation by Ann Stevens.Six of the letters from this book were subsequently published, together with many other letters written by E√ßa when he lived in the United Kingdom, as E√ßa's English Letters, with additional translations by Alison Aiken. == Outline of Cartas de Inglaterra == In its final published form Cartas de Inglaterra includes the following chapters: # Afeganist√£o e Irlanda, \\"Afghanistan and Ireland\\": a prophetic analysis, full of black humour, of two overseas adventures in which the British Empire was currently mired # Acerca de livros, \\"About books\\": London's autumn \\"seasons\\": yachting, shooting, hunting, angling, burglary, lectures, scientific congresses.

At one time, the company was the largest U.S. producer of dairy and pasta products. Its food division, Borden Foods, was based in Columbus, Ohio, and focused primarily on pasta and pasta sauces, bakery products, snacks, processed cheese, jams and jellies, and ice cream. It was best known for its Borden Ice Cream, Meadow Gold milk, Creamette pasta, and Borden Condensed Milk brands. Its consumer products and industrial segment marketed wallpaper, adhesives, plastics and resins. By 1993, sales of food products accounted for 67 percent of its revenues. It was also known for its Elmer's Glue and Krazy Glue. After significant financial losses in the early 1990s and a leveraged buyout by KKR in 1995, Borden divested itself of its various divisions, brands and businesses. KKR shuttered Borden's food products operations in 2001, and divested all its other Borden operations in 2005. Borden dairy brands are currently used by Borden Dairy Company for milk and by Dairy Farmers of America for cheese. ==Founding== Advertisement for Borden's Eagle Brand Condensed Milk and Peerless Brand Evaporated Cream in an 1898 guidebook for travelers in the Klondike Gold Rush The company was founded by Gail Borden, Jr., in 1857 in Connecticut as \\"Gail Borden, Jr., and Company.\\" Its primary product was condensed milk. Struggling financially, the company was saved when Jeremiah Milbank, a partner in the wholesale food distributor I. & R. Milbank & Co. and the son-in-law of banker Joseph Lake, agreed to invest and acquired 50 percent of the stock. The company changed its name in 1858 to the New York Condensed Milk Company. The company prospered during the Civil War by selling condensed milk to Union armies. Borden began selling processed milk to consumers in 1875, and pioneered the use of glass milk bottles in 1885.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 22, 1998. Borden began selling evaporated milk in 1892, and expanded into Canada in 1895. ==Growth== The company changed its name to Borden's Condensed Milk Company in 1899. It suffered a legal setback in 1912, when a federal appellate court held that the Borden Ice Cream Co. (a competitor whose ownership included one \\"Charles Borden\\") could sell ice cream under the Borden name because Borden's Condensed Milk sold only milk, not ice cream. But the limit on its products was short-lived. It became the Borden Company in 1919 and expanded rapidly, buying numerous dairies, ice cream manufacturers, cheese producers, and mincemeat processors. Taking advantage of its many herds of cattle, the company became involved in rendering and the manufacture of adhesives. In World War II, Borden pioneered the American manufacture of non- dairy creamer, instant coffee and powdered foods. Borden Company, York Ice workers packaging product, 1938 Borden became a holding company in 1929, but its operations were re-unified in 1936 and its subsidiaries became divisions. Borden and other dairy companies were investigated in 1938 for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, but the charges were dropped after Borden signed a consent decree in 1940. Borden's fictitious spokesperson, Jane Ellison, was introduced in 1929. Borden milk products in Canada began with condensed milk in Quebec and East Coast with headquarters in Montreal. Borden's Canadian operational head office moved to Toronto in 1931 when it acquired City Dairy. The old City Dairy Stables on Spadina Crescent was renamed Borden Stables and now part of the University of Toronto. Borden's Canadian operations slowly disappeared with Quebec operations to Agropour in 1976 and Ontario operations to Silverwood Dairy in 1980. In the 1950s, Borden moved into the printing ink, fertilizer, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics business. By 1961, it was making 7 percent of all raw PVC in the United States. By 1968, Borden's international chemical and petroleum divisions had grown so large that Borden created the Borden Inc. International division to manage them. The company owned the Danish company Cocio from 1976 to 1999. In 1987, Borden spun off some of its chemicals business in a public offering. Borden retained a small financial investment in the new company, known legally as Borden Chemicals & Plastics Operating Limited Partnership (BCPOLP) === Borden Food === The food products division was spun off as Borden Food Corporation when Borden, Inc., became a holding company in 1929. The holding company reversed itself thirteen years later when it reacquired its child company. In the 1950s, the parent company went on a buying spree, swallowing up companies such as Wyler's, which made bouillon and powdered soft drinks; ReaLemon, a manufacturer of synthetic and reconstituted lemon juice; Cracker Jack (sold to Frito-Lay in 1997); Campfire brand marshmallows; Wise Foods, a makers of potato chips and other snack foods; and Bama, makers of jellies and jams. Although Borden retrenched in the inflationary 1970s, it embarked on a second wave of mergers and acquisitions in the 1980s. It purchased Guys Snack Foods in 1979. It also purchased the Prince pasta manufacturing concern (giving Borden 30 percent of the domestic pasta market). In 1986, it purchased the dairy products division of Beatrice Foods, including the Meadow Gold brand. Stockholders blamed the company's decline on mismanagement, the incurrence of excessive debt to finance its numerous acquisitions, and several recent restructurings. ==Demise== Borden suffered significant losses for the period 1991‚Äì1993. A 1991 restructuring failed to integrate the company's brands and marketing efforts. When whole milk prices dropped in 1992, Borden Food did not lower its prices‚Äîcausing a significant drop in market share from which it was not able to recover. Borden divested itself of nearly a third of its businesses in 1993 but could not find a buyer for its snack food concerns. In deep financial difficulty, Borden was bought out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) in 1995. KKR increased the pace of divestiture, but was unable to right the company. The company's Borden/Meadow Gold Dairies subsidiary was sold in September 1997 to Southern Foods, controlled by the Mid-America Dairymen (later the Dairy Farmers of America). Borden licensed the use of Elsie the Cow, but retained ownership of the trademark.Jensen, \\"Crackerjack Plan? Borden to Sell Some Food Brands,\\" Wall Street Journal, March 21, 1997. Southern Foods was acquired by Suiza Foods (now Dean Foods) The dairies are now owned by Dean Foods and Borden Milk Products. Dairy Farmers of America retains Borden cheese. In 1997, KKR focused the company solely on its pasta and pasta sauces lines. But the new strategy failed as well. In June 2001, Borden Food sold several pasta lines to the American Italian Pasta Company and its pasta sauce and soup businesses (including Wyler's) to the H. J. Heinz Company. In July 2001, Borden Foods sold its remaining pasta lines to the New World Pasta.Buchanan, \\"Borden Foods Turns Out the Lights, Sells Final Holding,\\" Business First of Columbus, August 27, 2001. Borden, Inc., sold its final food product line, It's Pasta Anytime, to Kraft Foods in 2001 and shuttered its Foods division. With the Chemicals business the sole remaining operating company, in 2001, KKR merged Borden, Inc., into Borden Chemical, Inc., with the resulting company named Borden Chemical to emphasize the fact that Chemicals were the company's sole remaining product line. In 2004, KKR sold Borden Chemical to Apollo Management, a private equity firm. Borden Chemical was merged with Resolution Performance Products, Resolution Specialty Materials, and the German firm Bakelite AG to form Hexion Specialty Chemicals. With the merger (which settled in 2005), the last vestige of Borden, Inc., ceased to exist except as spin- offs and brand names.\\"Apollo Buys Borden Chemical for $649 Million,\\" New York Times, July 7, 2004. Hexion retained control over the Elsie the Cow trademarks and Borden name until Dec 2014 and has now assigned all Borden/Elsie trademarks in the U.S. to Grupo Lala of Durango, Mexico. Borden's Ice Cream, corner of Johnston and Jefferson Sts., Lafayette, Louisiana in 2010 Borden once operated a chain of ice cream stores called Borden's Ice Cream, but only a single location in Lafayette, Louisiana, remains, under local ownership. == Bankruptcy == On January 5, 2020, Borden Dairy Company and sixteen affiliated companies filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In his affidavit, Jason Monaco, the company's CFO, mentions that the company intends to reorganize and not liquidate its operations. He describes a difficult environment for milk producers that includes decreasing demand for milk, increased competition with non-dairy alternatives, the growth of discount grocery retailers, and the growth of private label alternatives. ==Legacy== Several firms continue to use the name Borden and Elsie the cow: * Borden Milk Products is a dairy distributor in Dallas, Texas, with products sold in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, among others. * J.M.

Specific campaign groups include the Construction Safety Campaign, the Centre for Corporate Accountability (CCA), the UK WorkStress Network, Families Against Corporate Killers (FACK), asbestos victims' support groups, and RSI Action. The campaign works by: sharing information and skills; campaigning on specific issues; acting as a national voice; issuing press releases; holding conferences; establishing national initiatives, including Workers Memorial Day; lobbying MPs, MEPs and statutory bodies like the Health & Safety Commission and the Health & Safety Executive, and organising demonstrations and protests. The Campaign is a worker-oriented organisation, and promotes trade union organisation in workplaces, increased worker involvement and participation in decision-making, and a radial perspective on the issues. It currently (2006) promotes and supports a number of emerging safety representative networks in different parts of the UK.

Other songs showcase a new direction for the band. For example, Brandon Boyd describes the curious recording technique behind \\"Paper Shoes\\": \\"There's a song called 'Paper Shoes' where Michael and I mic'd our bodies with ambient mics and did the percussion tracks pounding on our chests and skulls. The galloping rhythm is us pounding on our chests. It was really funny. We were trying so hard not to laugh because we were sitting there like cavemen beating our chests!\\" ==Themes== When asked about the album title, Boyd explained: \\"There's a song called that on the record and it felt like the most pertinent conceptual aspect of the album, the idea of throwing ideas at problems and the ideas explode with light and good results and intention on consciousness. So I started imagining imagery of students in different countries protesting and throwing Molotov cocktails with masks over their faces. But there's one brave student who runs up to the police line and, as opposed to throwing rocks or things that destroy, there's this concept of that one courageous, lonely student running up and throwing ideas and having them actually change things. It just seemed kind of a cool concept: the redefining of weaponry.\\" ==Track listingPersonnel== Incubus *Brandon Boyd ‚Äì lead vocals, percussion, guitar *Mike Einziger ‚Äì lead guitar, piano, Rhodes, string arrangements, bass guitar *Jose Pasillas ‚Äì drums *Ben Kenney ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals *Chris Kilmore ‚Äì turntables, Hammond B3, Moog Voyager, Rhodes, Mellotron, piano, Marxophone, theremin Production *Brendan O'Brien ‚Äì producer, mixing *Nick DiDia ‚Äì engineer *Billy Bowers ‚Äì additional engineering *Mike Einziger ‚Äì additional engineering, engineering and mixing on \\"Quicksand\\" *Suzi Katayama ‚Äì strings conductor *Tom Syrowski ‚Äì assistant engineer *Matt Serricchio ‚Äì assistant engineer *Glen Pittman ‚Äì assistant engineer *Kevin Mills ‚Äì assistant engineer *Tom Tapley ‚Äì assistant engineer *Bob Ludwig ‚Äì mastering ==Singles== *\\"Anna Molly\\" ‚Äì was briefly available online on September 20.

The Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning was responsible for economy, business and industry including Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, trade and inward investment, further and higher education, science, corporate social responsibility, community business and co-operative development, European Structural Funds, energy, lifelong learning, training and skills. ==Areas of responsibility== *Enterprise/Business **Energy - Markets, BETTA, Oil/Gas, Consents, Nuclear **Enterprise Networks (Sen and HIE) **Innovation **Regional Selective Assistance **Drinks Industry **Construction Industry **Retail Industry **All other industries **Post Offices **Defence - Regiments **European Structural Funds - general **Future of ESF **Union liaison (STUC) **DTI Department of Trade and Industry and trade body liaison **PACE and redundancies **Economic statistics/analysis **Personal Bankruptcy and Diligence (Official support will be provided by Justice Department) **Corporate Social Responsibility **Community Business and Co-operative *Lifelong Learning **Determined to Succeed - schools enterprise **SUfI and Learn Direct Scotland **Lifelong Learning Strategy **Adult literacy and numeracy **Skills **Beattie Implementation **Training Policy **Business Learning Accounts **Modern Apprenticeships **Welfare to Work ==Responsibility breakdownEnterprise=== To work with the Enterprise Networks to help deliver the enterprise strategy. As part of its commitment to fostering long- term, sustainable economic growth in Scotland, the Executive works with the Enterprise Networks to help deliver the enterprise strategy aimed at creating a smart, successful Scotland. ===Enterprise Networks=== To foster long-term, sustainable economic growth in Scotland. The Executive is committed to fostering long-term, sustainable economic growth in Scotland. Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise are the key economic development agencies in Scotland. The Executive's document \\"A Smart, Successful Scotland\\" gives them their strategic direction. At the local level Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and islands Enterprise operate through a network of Local Enterprise Companies (LECs). There are 12 in the Scottish Enterprise area and 10 in the Highlands and Islands Enterprise area. ===Business in the Parliament=== To work in partnership with business and establish an Annual Business Forum. The Partnership Agreement commits the Scottish Government to work in partnership with business and establish an Annual Business Forum to develop ideas and maximise the drivers for growth. The Executive jointly hosted a business conference with the Scottish Parliament on 22 and 23 April 2004. The aim of this unique partnership event between the Executive and the Parliament was to engage Scottish business in continuing to grow Scotland's economy. The Executive has considered the main issues raised at the Conference and in September 2004 produced a formal response to each of these issues. In July 2005, an updated response was published, to show policy development and implementation progress. ===Convention of the Highlands and Islands=== The Convention is a meeting between the Executive and its main partner agencies, represented by the Chairperson of each organisation. It is currently held twice yearly, and is hosted by a different local authority each time with the location alternating between a mainland and an island. The Convention is intended to strengthen co- ordination between member organisations, the Executive and other representative bodies to better inform the development and realisation of strategic economic, environmental, cultural and social justice objectives. The Convention is unique to the Highlands and Islands because the level of remoteness, rurality and sparseness of population here is not mirrored elsewhere in Scotland. It recognises the diversity and differing needs of Highland and Islands communities, and the distinct nature of the challenges and opportunities that exist in the area. The Convention's focus will be on delivering these strategic objectives to the long-term benefit of the people of the Highlands and Islands, and Scotland. ===Education and Training=== To ensure that everybody has access to learning opportunities that can help them achieve their full potential - giving children and young people the best possible start in life as they move from school to university and college or into the workforce, ensuring employability and adaptability throughout life. ===Schools=Universities and Colleges=Work based training=== To provide Work-based training opportunities designed to improve individual's skills and qualifications for work. ===Lifelong learning and post-school transition=== To provide strategic policy direction to all stakeholders in Scotland and sets out the Executive's policies and targets for five years. ===Social work and social care=== To ensure social work and care support services are adequate for the 21st century. ==See also== *Politics of Scotland Category:Former Ministerial posts of the Scottish Government ","title":"Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning"},{"id":"6229593","text":"The A685 is a road in Cumbria, England, that runs 28 miles (45 km) from Kendal to Brough. ==Route== Looking Eastwards on the top and western edge of Ash Fell Edge with the new A685 cutting.

Montgomery's mostly instrumental solo works have elements of post-rock, lo-fi, folk and avant-garde experimentation. His signature sound might be described as atmospheric or cinematic, often featuring complex layers of chiming, echoing and/or droning guitar phrases. He is currently head of the Environmental management department at Lincoln University in New Zealand. Montgomery has played in several New Zealand bands since 1980, most notably The Pin Group, Dadamah, Dissolve and Hash Jar Tempo. He has also released solo albums on labels including Kranky and Drunken Fish. == Biography == Montgomery was born in 1959 in London, England and moved with his family to Cologne in Germany where he lived until the age of four. His father was German and his mother was from the UK. As his mother worked for the British Forces Broadcasting Service, Montgomery was exposed mostly to the pop music of the United States rather than the music of Germany. In mid-sixties he moved with his mother to Christchurch, New Zealand. In 1980, he formed The Pin Group with bass player Ross Humphries and drummer Peter Stapleton. The group debuted with the single Ambivalence in 1981, released through the newly founded label Flying Nun Records. They recorded a handful of singles and performed only locally before disbanding in January 1982. Montgomery later worked with Stapleton again in Dadamah, formed in 1990. Montgomery had been composing and recording acoustic work since 1982, much of which he would integrate into his 1990s work. Although he enjoys collaborating with other artists, Montgomery is mostly drawn to working alone, which he attributes to growing up as an only child. In 1995 he issued his debut solo effort Scenes from the South Island, which he recorded and performed by himself. == Discography  Albums === * Scenes from the South Island (Drunken Fish, 1995) * Temple IV (Kranky, 1996) * And Now the Rain Sounds Like Life Is Falling Down Through It (Drunken Fish, 1998) * The Allegory of Hearing (Drunken Fish, 2000) * Silver Wheel of Prayer (VHF, 2001) * Music from the Film Hey Badfinger (Yellow Electric, 2012) * RMHQ: Headquarters (Grapefruit, 2016) * Suffuse (Grapefruit, 2018) === Compilations === *324 E. 13th Street #7 (Drunken Fish, 1999) *Inroads: New and Collected Works (Rebis, 2007) *324 E. 13th Street #7 (Yellow Electric, 2014) ===Collaborations=== *with Kim Pieters and Peter Stapleton and Janine Stagg as Dadamah: This is not a Dream (Majora, 1992) *with Kim Pieters and Peter Stapleton and Janine Stagg as Dadamah: This is not a Dream (Kranky, 1995) *with Chris Heaphy as Dissolve: That that is, is (not) (Kranky, 1995) *with Chris Heaphy as Dissolve: Third Album for the Sun (Kranky, 1997) *with Bardo Pond as Hash Jar Tempo: Well Oiled (Drunken Fish, 1997) *with Bardo Pond as Hash Jar Tempo: Under Glass (Drunken Fish, 1999) *with Flying Saucer Attack: Goodbye (VHF, 1996) *with Chris Heaphy: True (Kranky, 1999) *with Grouper: Roy Montgomery/Grouper (Root Strata, 2010) *with Nick Guy: Torlesse Super Group (Rebis, 2011) ==References*Artist page at the kranky record label website *Roy Montgomery's staff profile page at Lincoln University, Christchurch.

Paternion was also the venue for a preparation game between the Austrian national team and Udine Rugby Football Club. The Matadors take part in the Austrian Challenge Cup since 2004. Steadily improving their game, they have managed so far to win three games. Top scorers are J√ºrgen Friedrich, Mathias Genser, Roland Gfrerer, Mike Wagner (in alphabetical order). The main handicap in the further development of the club is the low number of active players, currently about a dozen; a problem that will hopefully be addressed by raising increased awareness for the game. The club hosted the match between Austria and Estonia of the Central Europe Development Tri-nations rugby league competition on 2 September 2006. This was the first ever Rugby league game in Austria. Matadors's Mathias \\"Mote\\" Genser won the man of the match award for Austria. The inaugural Carinthian Sevens took place on 9 September 2006, the \\"√•llarerstes internationales Paternioner Kircht√•gsturnier\\" in Carinthian German. Teams from as far afield as Moldova (RC UTM being the eventual winners), Slovenia and Germany participated. The success, especially due to the traditional and not so traditional entertainment available after the rugger - the event was held in conjunction with the local fair - encourages the Matadors to repeat the event next year on the second weekend of September, open to all interested teams and clubs.

He also represented England at Under 21 level, playing two matches in 1986. Morgan began his football career with Leicester City, representing them in the First and Second Divisions of The Football League, before being bought to then Third Division Fulham in October 1990 by Alan Dicks. The Cottagers finished 21st in Morgan's first season there (avoiding relegation by two points), and 9th in his second season (during which the club replaced Dicks with Don Mackay and missed out on the play-offs by four points) with a squad which Morgan felt \\"should have got promoted but for one reason or another we blew it\\". However, a 12th-placed finish in 1992/93 was followed by the club slipping to 18th with nine matches remaining of the 1993/94 season, as a result of which Mackay was replaced by Ray Lewington, and after going through these managerial changes, Fulham were relegated to the Third Division. After finishing within three points of the play-offs in 1994/95 under Ian Branfoot, the club had slipped to 23rd by February 1996, and eventually appointed Micky Adams as manager, who helped them finish 17th. The team was promoted to the Second Division in 1997. The club was then bought by Mohamed Al Fayed, which was followed by Fulham's rise into the Premier League in 2001. Due to injury, Morgan only played once in Fulham's victorious 2000‚Äì01 Division One campaign, coming on as a substitute against Wolverhampton Wanderers, which earned him the Man of the Match award despite playing only 13 minutes. Morgan was granted a testimonial year in the 2000‚Äì01 season. This included a special edition of Fulham fanzine TOOFIF, called \\"There's Only One Simon Morgan\\" (TOOSM), and culminated in a friendly match against Spurs, supported by a Fulham vs. Chelsea veterans' game (in which his son played). Morgan was unable to participate in the Spurs match due to injury, but kicked the match off before being shown a pre-arranged red card by referee Graham Poll. Morgan then went to play at Brighton & Hove Albion for a season, scoring once against Northampton, before bringing his playing career to an end in 2002. After retiring he rejoined Fulham as head of the club's community scheme. He left the club in 2007 to become the Premier League's Head of Community Development. ==References * Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Association football defenders Category:English footballers Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Fulham F.C. players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:England under-21 international footballers ","title":"Simon Morgan"},{"id":"6229725","text":"The Bavani≈°te Monastery ( or Manastir Bavani≈°te) is a 15th-century Serb Orthodox monastery located in Bavani≈°te, Kovin in northern Serbia (Banat, Vojvodina).

He also taught at Columbia College and Players Workshop. He studied under Viola Spolin. De Maat and Del Close were the two main figures of the Chicago improvisational comedy scene in the late 80's and throughout the 1990s. De Maat began working at The Second City as a teenager washing dishes in the kitchen and began teaching classes at The Second City for his aunt, Josephine Forsberg, when he was 18 years old. He instantly became a favorite teacher at The Second City, as well as supporting the shows by doing lights and stage managing. He studied theater at the University of Iowa and would much later receive a PhD from National University in Kanpur in communication arts. In 1974 he moved to New York City, where he became a very successful director and art director in both theater and film. During this period Martin returned to Chicago every summer to teach improv for his aunt's new school, Players Workshop, which acted as The Second City's unofficial training program. In 1984 Martin returned to Chicago semi- permanently and began to teach improv full-time at the Players Workshop, helping his aunt, Josephine Forsberg to develop the school. About that time, friend and colleague Sheldon Patinkin asked Martin to join the staff of the recently created The Second City Training Center, the theater's official improv training program. In 1985 Martin became its artistic director and led the development of the acting, writing and improvisation programs for the next 15 years, making it the biggest and most successful improv training program in the country. Martin became well known as a transformative and empowering teacher, who greeted his students with a hug and referred to The Second City as their home. He was not only an improv comedy teacher to them but also a life counselor and a father figure who helped to guide them to get in touch with their creativity and give up their restrictive ways of thinking. Martin de Maat died on February 15, 2001 of complications from pneumonia. Always a very private person in the public eye, he never revealed his age. The Chicago Sun-Times published it in his obituary at \\"around 52.\\" It also came as a shock to many that knew him that he had been living with AIDS for several years. After his death, he received many honors and memorials, especially in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles where many of his students and colleagues teach, direct and perform. At The Second City Training Center in Chicago in the early 2000s, an ongoing performance series was named in his honor, The de Maat Showcase. A plaque in his honor hangs on the wall at the training center. In 2009, the de Maat Studio Theater was opened in his honor at The Second City in Chicago. Some of Martin de Maat's students over the years include: Mick Napier, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Scott Adsit, Rachel Dratch, Sean Hayes, Tina Fey, and a young David Mamet. == External links == * Article from the Chicago Reader about Martin de Maat * Obituary from PerformInk * August 1998 Interview with Martin de Maat * Category:American male comedians Category:People from Chicago Category:1949 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American theatre directors Category:AIDS-related deaths in New York (state) Category:Comedians from Illinois Category:20th-century American comedians ","title":"Martin de Maat"},{"id":"6229754","text":"Floating University may refer to: Mc Donald *Flying University, Uniwersytet LatajƒÖcy, sometimes also translated \\"Floating University\\" *Oceanic II (ship), an ocean liner being refitted for use as ocean-going educational vessel ","title":"Floating University"},{"id":"6229758","text":"Sowton church Sowton is a village and civil parish east of Exeter in East Devon, England.

Often considered a form of predatory lending, equity stripping became increasingly widespread in the early 2000s. In an equity stripping scheme an investor buys the property from a homeowner facing foreclosure and agrees to lease the home to the homeowner who may remain in the home as a tenant. Often, these transactions take advantage of uninformed, low-income homeowners; because of the complexity of the transaction, victims are often unaware that they are giving away their property and equity. Several states have taken steps to confront the more unscrupulous practices of equity stripping. Although \\"foreclosure re-conveyance\\" schemes can be beneficial and ethically conducted in some circumstances, many times the practice relies on fraud and egregious or unmeetable terms. ==Term and definition== The term \\"equity stripping\\" has sometimes referred to lending refinance practices that charge excessive fees thereby \\"stripping the equity\\" out of the home. The practice more often describes foreclosure rescue scams. While most do not consider equity stripping a form of predatory lending per se, equity stripping is related to traditional forms of that practice. Subprime loans targeted at vulnerable and unsophisticated homeowners often lead to foreclosure, and those victims more often fall to equity stripping scams.Allen Fishbein and Harold Bunce, \\"Subprime Market Growth and Predatory Lending,\\" 277 (HUD Publications 2001) Additionally, some do consider equity stripping, in essence, a form of predatory lending since the scam works essentially like a high-cost and risky refinancing. Equity stripping, however, is conducted almost always by local agents and investors, while traditional predatory lending is carried out by large banks or national companies.Steve Tripoli and Elizabeth Renuart, National Consumer Law Center, \\"Dreams Foreclosed: The Rampant Theft of Americans' Homes Through Foreclosure 'Rescue' Scams (2005), available at www.consumerlaw.org/news/content/ForeclosureReportFinal.pdf ==Alternate Uses== In addition to the fraudulent uses described here, the term \\"equity stripping\\" also refers to the asset protection concept whereby the equity of an asset is encumbered, or stripped, to frustrate collection efforts by unsecured creditors. This can be done to protect the assets of individuals or organizations in high-risk businesses (e.g. doctors) from losing equity in lawsuit actions. ==Market conditions== Trends in the United States economy have led to the growing market for foreclosure services and equity stripping. Property values have increased dramatically from 2000-2005.Office of Federal Housing enterprise Oversight, House Price index for the Third Quarter of 2005, at 24(Dec. 1, 2005), available at www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/3q05hpi.pdf However, with an increase in values, foreclosure rates also peaked in 2001 and remained high,Office of Policy Development and Research, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Housing Market Conditions-3rd Quarter 2005 at 74 (2005) leaving numerous foreclosed homeowners with substantial equity. With these trends, a market emerged to tap into this equity. ==Scam ElementsForeclosure=== A homeowner falls behind on his mortgage payments and enters foreclosure. Foreclosure notices are published in newspapers or distributed by reporting services to investors and rescue artists. Foreclosed homeowners also contact lenders to inquire about refinancing options. ===Solicitation=== Rescue artists obtain contact information for foreclosed homeowners and make contacts personally, by phone, or through direct mail. Some lenders and brokers will also refer foreclosed homeowners that do not qualify for new loans to rescue artists for a commission. Rescue artists offer the foreclosed homeowner a \\"miracle refinancing\\" and/or say they can \\"save the home\\" from foreclosure. ===Acquisition=== Rescue artists arrange the closing (often delaying the date until shortly before the homeowner's removal to create urgency). At the closing, the homeowner transfers title (possibly unwittingly) to the rescue artist or an arranged investor. The rescue artist or arranged investor pays off the amount owed in foreclosure to acquire the deed, and inherits or is paid any portion of the homeowner's remaining equity. The rescue artist will reconvey the property back to the homeowner in the form of a lease or a contract for deed. ===Result=== The homeowners remain in the home and pay rent or contract-for-deed payments (often higher than their previous mortgage payments). They inevitably fall behind, and are evicted from their homes with very little of their equity. ==Legal Remedies== Several states have passed laws to prevent and/or regulate equity stripping schemes. Minnesota passed a comprehensive law aimed at \\"foreclosure re-conveyance\\" practices in 2004, and Maryland in 2005 was the first of at least 14 other states to adopt the Minnesota model for regulating these transactions.See Minn. Stat. 325N (2004); Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. 7-301 to 7-321 (2005) These state laws require adequate disclosures, capped fees, and an ability to pay on behalf of the consumer. The statutes also ban certain deceptive and unfair practices associated with equity stripping. Other laws regulating the activity of \\"foreclosure consultants\\" have been passed in California, Georgia, and Missouri.Cal. Civ. Code 2945-2945.11; GA. Code Ann 10=1=393(b)(20)(A)(2005); Mo. Ann. Stat. 407.935-.943 (2005) Additionally, state fraud and unfair and deceptive trade practices laws may be applicable.Prentiss Cox, \\"Foreclosure Equity Stripping: Legal theories and Strategies to Attack a Growing Problem,\\" Clearinghouse REVIEW Journal of Poverty Law and Policy, 607-626, March‚ÄìApril 2006 The Truth in Lending Act may also govern some transactions. ==Non- Predatory Foreclosure Rescue== In certain circumstances, foreclosure rescue services can be beneficial to the consumer. When refinancing options are exhausted and foreclosure proceedings have led to near eviction, a foreclosure rescue transaction with moderate fees and full disclosures can be legally and ethically executed. A consumer can face removal from the property and the loss of their entire equity following a foreclosure auction. As an alternative, foreclosure rescuers have the ability to redeem the home from foreclosure with a new mortgage of their own. For a moderate fee or portion of the existing equity, this can keep the former homeowner in the home as a tenant while they repair their credit or increase their income. After a given time period, the homeowner can then repurchase the property from the rescuer. If done with full verbal and written disclosure, terms the consumer is capable of fulfilling, and moderate total fees, foreclosure rescue can be suitable to consumers in dire situations. This mechanism is often used by family members or friends in order to prevent the loss of a home. In effect, the investor \\"lends\\" their good credit to the foreclosed homeowner by paying off the foreclosed mortgage and obtaining the title to the home temporarily. ==References== Category:Private equity Category:Real estate in the United States ","title":"Equity stripping"},{"id":"6229787","text":"The Cenepa River is a 185-km stretch of river where its basin borders Ecuador and Peru, in the Cordillera del C√≥ndor mountain range in South America.Topographic map Gualaquiza, Ecuador; Peru SA-17-16, Joint Operations Graphic 1:250,000, U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency, February 1995 Its drainage basin borders to the north on Ecuador, to the east on the districts of R√≠o Santiago and Nieva, on the south with the district of Imaza, and on the west with Ecuador. The River has been subject to several border disputes between Peru and Ecuador the most notable was in 1995 the Cenepa War. The Awaj√∫n (Aguaruna People), the locals around the Cenepa River Basin have had issues with the legal certainty of the River due to its cultural significance and the resources. The Cenepa River has been impacted by the consequences of military action in the region through skirmishes between Ecuadorian and Peruvian forces along with the establishment of military camps and outposts. Expansion of local communities and the influence of mining have to different degrees interrupted the natural habitats of local fauna and flora. The Cenepa River has had government intervention through the growing recognition of the importance of preservation. This was a direct result of the peace talks that followed the Cenepa War in 1995.,or the Battle of Tiwinza.Cooper, Tom (1 September 2003) \\"Peru vs. Ecuador; Alto Cenepa War, 1995\\" Central and Latin American Database, Air Combat Information Group (ACIG), archived 13 February 2012 at https://www.webcitation.org/65QqBXgYe?url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_164.shtml by WebCite. ==Geographical region== The Cenepa River is a 185-km stretch of river where its basin borders Ecuador and Peru. The land around the Cenepa River Basin ‚Äúpresents a capricious topography that includes relatively broad inland valleys\\". For example, the Numpatkeim Valley, like similar valleys in the region that have narrow canyons and opportune farmland is not commonly found along many reaches of the river. Along the eastern banks of the Cenepa River are primarily tropical premontane rainforests where the Cenepa River Basin is noted as a treacherous region of steep valleys that offered limited access between the border. During the period of the 1943‚Äì1946 aerial survey, two aircraft and 14 men are recorded to be lost in accidents in the dense tropical rainforest encompassing the Cenepa River. A network of rivers and streams as well as brooks follow through deeply dissected mountain systems within the regions. The water that originates in the Cordillera del Condor establishes a pivotal section of the subsystems that create the Cenepa river basin. The great multitude of limestone and sandstone structure in the region along with the presence of the vast number of streams have created hundreds of culturally significant waterfalls in the Cordillera del Condor and Cenepa regions. Caves which have been formed can take days to walk through, these are accessed through long narrow passages that are often 60 to 80 meters deep. These characteristics of the Cordillera del Condor and Cenepa region are the reason behind the conservation and preservation. The primary role of conservation in the region is to maintain the water cycles essential to the Cenepa River. The 1946 United States Army Air Force accomplished the first aerial survey of the Cordillera del Condor zone including the Cenepa River. The results revealed for the first time the topographic contours, watershed and drainage of the Cenepa River which were unknown until this survey. Geographical understanding prior to this survey was that watershed was originally thought to be where the Cenepa Rivers location was pinpointed. This verified that the Cenepa River was far longer than Ecuadorian cartography had initially recorded and believed. ==Territorial disputes== The Peruvian Government had a spoken pact of mutual understanding and cooperation with the local communities of the Cenepa River, primarily the Aguaruna People. The pact was enforced in 1940 by the military and remained until the end of the Cenepa War in 1995. As a result of the local communities‚Äô ability to produce food resources through small farms like animal breeding; such as chickens and farmland for bananas. This enabled the army to maintain logistical support through a reliable and steady supply of staples from the locals for their encampments established in isolated locations. The pact between the army and the Aguaruna resulted in the army receiving warnings from the locals, regarding military infiltrations from Ecuadorian forces. As the Cenepa River along the border is a region of extremely restricted access, traditional dirt roads is the one alternative option other than a helicopter flight. The Team, Organisation for the Development of Border Communities of EL Cenepa Research 2010 observed that the pact was the reason that the valleys in the Cenepa River Basin had no outside settlements and it was made possible to sustain territorial control and environment solidity for the traditional locals. Large troop activity around the Cenepa River was evident during the disputes between Ecuador and Peru. In 1995, upwards of 3000 Ecuadorian troops where deployed in the region as well as 2000 Peruvian troops. The average skirmishes between these forces where between patrol units consisting of on average 40 men (Marcella 1995 p. 1). Increased troop activity around the Cenepa River resulted in the greater foot traffic and damages to its ecosystem. In addition with the clearing of tropical premontane rainforests for the establishment of multiple camps and military outposts. The territorial disputes have had many impacts in the Cenepa River as there are reports of landmines from the conflict that remain a problem in that area.Moyes, Richard (2005) Explosive remnants of war and mines other than anti-personnel mines: Global Survey 2003-2004 Landmine Action (UK); Actiongroup Landmine.de; Mines Action Canada; London, page 55, The landmines remaining in the upper Cenepa, placed by Peruvian forces add to the significant dangers of the region. Airstrikes have impacted areas around the Cenepa river, primarily in east Cordillera del Condor. ==Legal certainty== The Cenepa River Basin has been the subject to territorial disputes between Ecuador and Peru as well as legal conflicts between the local inhabitants and the Peruvian government. In the 1970s the ‚Äúfirst registrations and land titles where awarded to the communities that roughly corresponded to the locations of where the bilingual schools had been established in the 1960s‚Äù. These communities where primarily located in the middle reaches of the Cenepa river including some in the lower reaches. The land tiles were given to fourteen local communities and had the common attempt to protect the land on the banks of the Cenepa river that were in the local vicinity of the established schools. This was in order to protect and preserve the local communities' right to fish and pan for alluvial gold. Including the right of access and ownership of inland areas. The end of the Cenepa War of 1995 was when the legal certainty of the land was recognised as an important verdict. Results were produced between 1997 and 1999, where many local Cenepa River communities were granted land titles as to maintain the integrity of the Cenepa River Basin. Overall, the legal certainty of the Cenepa River was an effort to recognise the traditional caretakers of the land. The Team, Organisation for the Development of Border Communities of EL Cenepa Research states that ‚Äúby 1999 a total of 158, 910 hectares in the Cenepa River Basin had been awarded land tiles to the local communities‚Äù. ==Local Communities== The Cenepa River native inhabitants are the Aguaruna People. Traditionally, the ‚ÄúAguaruna families within an endogamous nexus alternate the location of their homes and agricultural fields‚Äù. These locations are rotated within the sub-basin they inhabit also interpreted as the same geographical region. The low population density of the traditional communities and their traditional movement of their settlements around their inhabited sub-basin, enable the soil fertility to periodically recover. This allows the Aguarana people to maintain the land and resources such as fruit trees. The traditional local communities main influence on the Cenepa River region was the continual rotation of their settlements which provided the basin the opportunity to recover and be maintained. In the 1960s the first bilingual schools were established in the Cenepa River Basin region. this establishment contributed to the increasing formation of new population centres and existing communities consisting of relatives that lived traditionally in a widespread manner. The increasing populations concentrated around the lower and middle regions of the Cenepa and Canga rivers. The main populous communities are located in the middle reaches of the river. The increase in schools and other services to the region such as health posts has resulted in the population around the Cenepa River to rise. The Team Organisation for the Development of Border Communities of EL Cenepa Research 2010 states that the sizes of the local communities greatly varied from 50 to 3000 inhabitants. This resulted in the increase of small farms for animal breeding which was located closer to the local communities and farmland for food production through crops such as bananas and cocoa, located further from the community. Bananas, cassava, plantains and Mauritian palm fruit are the most common food resources grown in the Cenepa river basin that the local communities eat, where meals are most commonly prepared through boiling. The land around the Cenepa River has many banana trees, maintained by the local communities. Chapo and pururuca are the names of drinks the local communities, primarily the Aguaruna people make from boiling ripe bananas. ==Local flora and fauna== In some regions vegetations is restricted to growing on average fifteen meters; a result of shallow soils over limestone and strong winds. Flowering and fruiting specimens of Cremastosperma yamayakatense grow up to heights of around 6 to 8 metres in the Cenepa River region in contrast to the Bagua and Condorcanqui provinces where the same species have been recorded having an average of 1.5 meters. A vast number of frog species have been discovered around the basin, primarily in habitats that consisted of clear and black waters, including some lentic environments. It was observed that there is a great Otter presence in the region, this highlights the copiousness of fish in the upper stretches of the Cenepa river basin. ==ReferencesNotes== Category:Rivers of Amazonas Region Category:Rivers of Peru Mouth: ","title":"Cenepa River"},{"id":"6229794","text":"The incident referred to as Trincomalee massacre in 2006 happened when five minority Sri Lankan Tamil high school students playing by the beach were briefly detained and then shot dead by Special Task Force.Unfinished Business of the Five Students and ACF Cases‚Äì A Time to call the Bluff ==ReactionsSri Lankan government=== The government claims were contradicted by the results of the local coroner, who said that they were killed by gunshot wound in execution style.

He had a brother Mike Gibbons. Tommy started boxing professionally in 1911 as a middleweight. Like his brother he was a master scientific boxer who chose to outbox his opponents. In time, he advanced to the heavyweight boxing class and developed a respectable punch. On May 27, 1916 he married Helen Constance Moga in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His biggest fight came near the end of his career in Jack Dempsey vs. Tommy Gibbons when he met heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey on July 4, 1923 in Shelby, Montana. The local backers and the town of Shelby went broke putting on the fight. The great Dempsey battled through the full fifteen rounds before winning by decision. Dempsey was awarded $200,000, whereas Gibbons received expense money. Tommy Gibbons record was 56-4-1 with 44 no decisions, and 1 no contest. He scored 48 knockouts, and was stopped only once by Gene Tunney on June 5, 1925. The names dotting his record read like boxing's hall of fame.

In the majority of cases a female spider kills and eats a male before, during, or after copulation. Cases in which males eat females are rare. ==Females eating males== Araneus diadematus. The courting male is wrapped by the female before it has successfully copulated. It is often said that the male (usually significantly smaller than the female, down to 1% of her size as seen in Tidarren sisyphoides) is likely to be killed by the female after the coupling, or sometimes even before intercourse has been initiated. This supposed propensity is what gave the black widow spider, Latrodectus mactans, its name. However, the three species of North American black widows do not usually kill the male (although they have been known to do so). Males can sometimes even live in the web of a female for a while without being harmed in any way. The male Australian redback spider Latrodectus hasselti is killed by the female after he inserts his second palpus in the female genital opening; in over 60% of cases the female then eats the male. Although the male Latrodectus hasselti may sometimes die during mating without the female actually consuming him, this species represents a possible strategy of \\"male sacrifice\\". The male redback, while copulating, \\"somersaults\\" and twists his abdomen directly onto the fangs of his mate. Approximately 65% of males are consumed at this stage.Andrade, Maydianne C. B. Behavioral Ecology (2003), 14:531‚Äì538 Males that \\"sacrifice\\" themselves gain the benefit of increasing their paternity relative to males who do not get cannibalized. Despite these examples and many other similar reports, however, the theory of the \\"sacrificial male\\" has become greater than the truth. Mating of spiders is not always followed by cannibalism. Indeed, scholars have noted that the \\"supposed aggressiveness of the female spider towards the male is largely a myth\\" and that cannibalism only occurs in exceptional cases.Foelix, Rainer F. Biology of Spiders, 1982.Roberts, Michael J. Spiders of Britain and Northern Europe, Collins, London, 1995. Even so, spider cannibalism has been shown to occur in some species more than in others, mainly species belonging to Latrodectus. There has always been speculation on why this sacrifice of male mates might occur despite the obvious disadvantage to the sacrificial males. One theory is that once the male has mated, he is unlikely to mate again and so any further extension of his life is of lesser evolutionary benefit than his indirectly contributing nutrition to the eggs. Having more offspring would give the male the advantage of having his genes passed on over other males that might avoid being eaten. This scenario would be consistent with Roberts' hypothesis that old or unfit males get eaten, whilst younger and fitter ones may survive to mate again. ==Males eating females== Reversing the traditional roles, species that have males consuming females are relatively unknown; the few that do show a male-biased sexual dimorphism. Examples include Allocosa brasiliensis, Evarcha culicivora, and Argyronetia aquatica. Male water spiders, Argyronetia aquatica, show a predilection for mating with larger females, while cannibalizing females smaller than themselves. As is the case with Allocosa brasiliensis, males cull older females who are less fertile than their young counterparts. ==Sacrificial mothers== * Offspring of the species Stegodyphus lineatus eat their mother. * A female of Segestria florentina will sometimes die while guarding her eggs, and the hatched spiders will later eat her. ==Non-reproductive cannibalism== Juvenile Redback spiders live in groups immediately after hatching, and are known to cannibalize siblings during this period. Cannibalism is a heritable trait in these spiders, with some families more prone to it than others. Some spiders, such as Pholcus phalangioides, will prey on their own kind when food is scarce. Also, females of Phidippus johnsoni have been observed carrying dead males in their fangs. This behavior may be triggered by aggression, where females carry over hostility from their juvenile state and consume males just as they would prey. Sih and Johnson surmise that non-reproductive cannibalism can occur due to a remnant of an aggression trait in juvenile females. Known as the \\"aggressive spillover hypothesis\\", this tendency to unselectively attack anything that moves is cultivated by a positive correlation between hostility, foraging capability, and fecundity. Aggression at a young age leads to an increase in prey consumption and as such, a larger adult size. This behavior \\"spills over\\" into adulthood, and shows up as a nonadaptive trait that manifests itself through adult females preying on males of their same species. ==See also== *Cannibalism (zoology) *Sexual cannibalism ==References== Category:Spiders Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Animal cannibalism ","title":"Spider cannibalism"},{"id":"6229868","text":"West Halls residential complex, University Park campus The following is a list of the residence halls within the Pennsylvania State University system. ==University Park== In addition to the following residence halls, the University Park campus provides housing in Eastview Terrace, White Course Apartments, and Nittany Apartments. ===Residence Commons=== The residence commons are common areas for each of the residence hall areas.

It has been brewed by the \\"Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever\\" (the Jever Frisian Brewery) since 1848. ==History== A bottle of Jever Jever beer glass When the \\"Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever\\" was founded by Diedrich K√∂nig in 1848, it was only one of several breweries in the region. K√∂nig, however, was convinced from the beginning that his beer was something special. After his death in 1867, his son sold the brewery. Theodor Fetk√∂ter took over the brewery. He began by developing the small family business into a large brewery operation, started to advertise and developed special bottles. In 1848, he played an important part in installing the first water supply system in Jever. The First World War was a difficult time for the brewery. Theodor Fetk√∂ter's son, who had taken over the business, was killed at the front. The brewery was sold once again, in 1922, to the Bavaria - St. Pauli Brewery brewery, based in Hamburg. Today the Bavaria - St. Pauli Brewery is owned by the Danish Carlsberg Group. By then, beer from Jever had become known outside the region where it was produced. Since 1934, it has been sold under the name \\"Jever Pilsener\\". After World War II, the brewery once again found itself experiencing difficult times. Due to a fuel shortage, beer could only be sold from the brewery gates directly to customers. It was also necessary to scour the region's farms for malt. After the post-war period, the situation in Jever improved once again. The top-selling beer was \\"Jever Export\\", which was brewed until 1990. During the 1960s, Pilsener beer became more and more popular and sales figures for Jever Pilsener increased. During this period the brewery was expanded. Since 1994, the brewery has belonged to the Dortmunder Brau und Brunnen Group, which was acquired by Radeberger Group, at the beginning of 2005. ==Sponsorships== From 2002 to 2005, Borussia M√∂nchengladbach was sponsored by Jever. ==References * official website (English) * Fansite and documentation project (English) Category:Breweries in Germany Category:Beer brands of Germany Category:1848 introductions Category:Dr. Oetker ","title":"Jever Brewery"},{"id":"6229879","text":"The Native News Today is a weekly television show hosted by Gerald Wofford a (Cherokee) citizen and Jason Salsman a (Muscogee) citizen.

He served as dean of the Karl Menninger School of Psychiatry and Mental Health Science and he was the CEO of the Menninger Clinic from the 1993 to 2001. During his tenure as CEO, the clinic began negotiations to move from Topeka, Kansas, to Houston, Texas, where it is affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine. Menninger has special interests in psychoanalysis and forensic psychiatry. He has served on several boards or committees related to prisons, police work and violence prevention. His research with Peace Corps volunteers resulted in his development of the Menninger morale curve, a schematic used to predict responses among people who are in new environments. Menninger wrote a nationally syndicated newspaper column for several years; he has served as editor of Psychiatry Digest and the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic. ==Early life and education== William Walter Menninger was born in 1931 in Topeka, Kansas, to William C. Menninger and the former Catherine Wright. His father was a doctor and psychiatrist in practice with his brother Karl and father C. F. Menninger. They had founded the Menninger Clinic in 1925. The younger William attended Stanford University, where he graduated in 1953. He joined Alpha Phi Omega. He wrote for The Stanford Daily for four years and ultimately served as its managing editor. He earned a medical degree from Cornell University Medical College. ==CareerEarly career=== Early in his career, Menninger became affiliated with Topeka State Hospital. In the early 1970s, he spoke out about budget cuts that affected the training and hiring of personnel at the hospital. By that time, Menninger was also seeing psychiatric patients at his family's Menninger Foundation. By the mid-1970s, Menninger had taken leave from the foundation to focus on administration of the state hospital. Menninger conducted research on the morale of volunteers in the Peace Corps and in Volunteers in Service to America. As a result, he created the Menninger morale curve, which reflects the responses that can be expected when a person faces life changes. Menninger created a curve for positive life changes and one for negative changes. The curves identify four crisis points that a person must surmount when entering a new environment. ===Menninger Foundation=== William C. Menninger, Walter's father Menninger's grandfather, C. F. Menninger, father, William C. Menninger, and uncle, Karl Menninger, established The Menninger Foundation in 1925 in Topeka, Kansas.http://www.menningerclinic.com/about/early-history.htm With years of managing the large state hospital, in 1993 Walt succeeded his older brother, Roy W. Menninger, as the leader of the foundation. Menninger named Efrain Bleiberg as the president of the organization. He realized that he was probably the last family member to lead the organization; his plan included grooming Bleiberg for the CEO position when he decided to step down. Retiring from the Menninger Foundation in 2001, Menninger became the chairman of Menninger Trustees. The Menninger Clinic moved from Topeka to Houston in 2003, becoming affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine. While his older brother Roy was bothered by the move, Walt Menninger backed the change in location. Consultants had recommended that the clinic be moved to an urban area near a medical school and an airport. In 2000, Walt Menninger had said that the clinic would be out of business in a few years unless it moved. In the summer of 2001, negotiations between Menninger and Baylor College of Medicine were briefly called off, but the two institutions were able to work out an affiliation before the move. Relationships between the Menninger brothers and with other family members have sometimes been contentious, especially over moving the clinic after decades in Topeka, determining where to locate its archives, and the leadership of the organization in general. Psychiatrist William Simpson has described the battles at the Menninger Clinic, saying, \\"First Dr. Roy pushed Dr. Walt aside, and he went into exile at the state mental hospital. Then Dr. Walt [came back and] pushed Dr. Roy aside.\\" ===Other affiliations and awards=== Menninger was the editor of Psychiatry Digest for several years in the 1970s. He authored close to 1,000 articles in a national newspaper column known as In-Sights in the 1970s and 1980s. He served as editor of the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic for more than ten years until 2014. He has specific interests in psychoanalysis, forensic psychiatry and administrative psychiatry. He was called as an expert witness at the competency hearing of Sara Jane Moore. He served on the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence and was a consultant to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. He was a member of the board of trustees of the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse (now PCA America).Scouting, September 1986 He is on the board of directors for the Police Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works to enhance policing techniques. In 1982, he testified before the Kansas legislature in support of the establishment of the guilty but mentally ill legal verdict. Menninger is president of the Tower Mental Health Foundation, which assists mental health organizations in Kansas. ==Personal== Menninger met his wife Connie while attending Stanford University. They had six children together: Fritz, John, Eliza, Marian, Will, and David. Daughter Eliza Menninger became a psychiatrist affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Connie Menninger died in 2008. Menninger was a member of the Boy Scouts of America National Health and Safety Committee. He served on the BSA Executive Board and is a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. He received the BSA Silver Buffalo Award in 2001. ==Legacy and honors== Menninger has received honorary doctorates from Dominican University, Middlebury College, Washburn University, Ottawa University and Heidelberg College. He received the Distinguished Service Award from the American Psychiatric Association. ==Popular culture== Menninger served as a consultant for the 2013 film adaptation of The Great Gatsby, which begins and ends in a sanatorium, based on the Menninger Clinic. As a nod to Menninger, the psychiatrist in the movie is named Walter Perkins. ==Selected publications== * Menninger, W. W. (1976). Happiness Without Sex: And Other Things Too Good to Miss.

Their first full-length album Usual Tragedy was released in 2004 on the German label Drakkar Records. The orchestral arrangements give it its symphonic heavy metal (or simply symphonic metal) tag. Lyricwise, Usual Tragedy is a concept album about a man who crossed both World Wars, lost his father during the first one, lost his beloved one during the second one, witnessed the violence and the madness of men, eventually lost his own sanity and died alone and anonymous in an hospital. Their second studio album, Raise, released in 2005 on Drakkar Records as well, is not as orchestral as Usual Tragedy but has dark, melancholic atmospheres that could already be heard on the first album as well and that seem to be the band's trademark; that's why Karelia's music is also sometimes called gothic metal. The lyrics deal with various themes such as blinding and misleading of people by a charismatic leader (\\"Raise\\"), religion wars (\\"Cross and Crescent\\"), childhood (\\"Child Has Gone\\", \\"Unbreakable Cordon\\"), depression (\\"Breakdown\\"). In January 2007 keyboardist Bertrand Maillot left the band, and Jack Ruesch joined the band as second guitarist. In June 2007 the band finished the recording of its third album Restless. It was first expected to be released in September/October 2007 (as stated in January 2007 on their still-working then website), but Karelia later announced on its MySpace that it would be released through the French label Season Of Mist; the label's website displays 21 April 2008 as the release date. The cover artwork hasn't been revealed yet. Restless will show new musical orientations, featuring industrial elements. In autumn November 2007 Karelia opened for the well-known German hard rock band Scorpions for three of their shows in France. Finally, on 26 August 2011, the album Golden Decadence was released, with the guest Rudolf Schenker of Scorpions playing guitar on two songs and Keep Watching Me The Way Across The Hills and 3 bonus tracks, including the resumption of Queen The Show Must Go On. On 2 June 2012 the group were back on the stage with Scorpions for their last day in France at the outdoor amphitheater at the Zenith of Nancy Nancy Festival On The Rocks. In this concert, Lex, singer and leader of Koritni came to sing with the band the title of Misfits Attitude. In May 2013 the band finally decided to stop. ==Influences== According to Karelia's frontman Matthieu Kleiber, the band members have various influences, citing, among others, classical music as well as hard rock bands like Guns N' Roses and Aerosmith for himself and ex- keyboardist Bertrand Maillot, hard rock such as Whitesnake for bassist Gilles Thiebaut, symphonic heavy metal bands for guitarist Erwan Morice and drummer Lo√Øc Jenn.Interview @ Obsk√ºre.com (in French) ==MembersCurrent members=== *Matthieu Kleiber ‚Äì backing vocals, vocals *Erwan Morice ‚Äì guitar *Jack Ruesch ‚Äì guitar *Gilles Thiebaut ‚Äì bass *Lo√Øc Jenn ‚Äì drums *Bobby Gu - record producer ===Former members=== *Bertrand Maillot ‚Äì keyboard *Chris Savourey ‚Äì guitar *Claude Gasparini ‚Äì bass *Lionel Vest ‚Äì guitar, keyboard *S√©bastien Fellmann ‚Äì guitar ==DiscographyStudio albums=== *Usual Tragedy (2004) *Raise (2005) *Restless (2008) *Golden Decadence (2011) ===Demo albums=== *Karelia (2000) ==References * http://www.karelia.fr Official Site] *Karelia at MySpace Category:Musical groups established in 2000 Category:Musical quintets Category:Season of Mist artists Category:French symphonic metal musical groups Category:French power metal musical groups ","title":"Karelia (band)"},{"id":"6229900","text":"Osmotherapy is the use of osmotically active substances to reduce the volume of intracranial contents. Osmotherapy serves as the primary medical treatment for cerebral edema. The primary purpose of osmotherapy is to improve elasticity and decrease intracranial volume by removing free water, accumulated as a result of cerebral edema, from brain's extracellular and intracellular space into vascular compartment by creating an osmotic gradient between the blood and brain. Normal serum osmolality ranges from 280-290 mOsm/kg and serum osmolality to cause water removal from brain without much side effects ranges from 300-320 mOsm/kg. Usually, 90 mL of space is created in the intracranial vault by 1.6% reduction in brain water content. Osmotherapy has cerebral dehydrating effects. The main goal of osmotherapy is to decrease intracranial pressure(ICP) by shifting excess fluid from brain. This is accomplished by intravenous administration of osmotic agents which increase serum osmolality in order to shift excess fluid from intracellular or extracellular space of the brain to intravascular compartment. The resulting brain shrinkage effectively reduces intracranial volume and decreases ICP. ==History== In 1919, Weed and McKibben, biomedical researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical School, were the first ones to document the use and effect of osmotically active substances on brain mass. While studying transfer of salt solutions from blood to Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), they first noted that concentrated sodium chloride intravenous (IV) injection led to collapse of the thecal sac which prevented them from withdrawing CSF from the lumbar cistern. In order to further study the effect, they conducted lab experiments on anesthetized cats which underwent craniotomy. They observed changes to the convexity of cat's brain upon IV injection, specifically, they noted that Hypertonic Saline IV injection resulted in maximum shrinkage of the brain in 15-30 mins, while administration of hypotonic solutions resulted in protrusion and rupture of the brain tissue. By 1927, use of osmotic agents in IV delivery became official. ==Cerebral edema== Cerebral Edema that resulted from brain tumor is represented by darker areas on this CT image An increase in cerebral water content is called cerebral edema and it usually results from traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subdural hematoma, ischemic stroke, brain tumors, infectious disorders and intracranial surgery. Cerebral edema may result in compromised regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP) gradients which could lead to death of the affected. Increased ICP leads to increased intracranial volume. Unmonitored ICP leads to brain damage by global hypoxic ischemic injury due to reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) which is found by subtracting the ICP from mean arterial pressure(MAP), cerebral blood flow, and mechanical compression of brain tissue due to compartmentalized ICP gradients. Cerebral edema is mainly classified into cytotoxic edema, vasogenic edema and interstitial edema. Cytotoxic edema affects both the white and gray matter and results from the swelling of cellular elements such as neurons, glia and endothelial cells. Vasogenic edema affects white matter and results from blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. Interstitial edema results from lack of proper cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption. ==Osmotic agents== Osmotic agents work by primarily affecting the blood brain barrier. It's very important that the osmotic agents cannot cross the blood brain barrier because the main idea is to use osmotic agents to increase plasma osmolarity and cause an osmotic gradient to cause water from brain cells to flow into the plasma. Once the equilibrium is reached, both the ICP and intracellular volume return to their initial normal conditions. An ideal osmotic agent would be characterized by its inertness, relative non-toxicity and complete exclusion from brain entry. Thus, osmotic agents with reflection coefficient (œÉ) closer to 1 (0= freely permeable, 1= completely impermeable) is preferred as it is not likely to exhibit any rebound effects such as cerebral edema and ICP elevations upon withdrawal. Commonly used osmotic agents are urea, glycerol, mannitol and Hypertonic Saline. Dosage of osmotic agent administration is referred to as grams per person's body mass (g/ kg). ===Urea=== Molecular structure of Urea Urea with œÉ=.59 was introduced in 1956 due to low molecular weight and slow penetration of BBB. However, it can cause rebound effects and side effects such as intravascular hemolysis and phlebitis. When Urea is administered, the dosage is 1.5 g/kg or 0.5 g/kg (for elderly). ===Glycerol=== Molecular structure of Glycerol Glycerol with œÉ=.48 was introduced in 1964, but it has a likelihood of exhibiting rebound effects and causing side effects such as hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, renal failure, hyperosmolar coma and nausea. When Glycerol is used, the dosage is 1.2 g/kg followed by 0.5-1 g/kg for 3‚Äì4 hours. ===Mannitol=== Molecular structure of Mannitol Mannitol is an alcohol derivative of simple sugar mannose, and its use has been investigated since 1962. With a œÉ=.9, molecular weight of 182 daltons, half life of 2‚Äì4 hours, ease of preparation, chemical stability and free radical scavenging properties, it's been regarded as the principal osmotic agent for clinical use. However, it could cause diuresis, renal failure, hyperkalemia and hemolysis. If mannitol is administered, the dosage used is mannitol 20% solution of 1-1.5 g/kg, followed by 0.25-1 g/kg doses as needed every 1 to 6 hours depending on the ICP. ===Hypertonic saline=== Saline solution prepared for medical use by dissolving NaCl in water Hypertonic Saline with œÉ=1 has been of interest since early 1980s. Hypertonic Saline which contains sodium chloride works in regulating ICP, intravascular volume and cardiac output without causing significant diuresis, but there are theoretical side effects ranging from neurological complications to subdural hematoma. Hypertonic saline solution has been choice of neuro critical care for the past few years. Hypertonic Saline solution used varies and could be 3%, 7.5%, 10%, or 24.3% saline solution. When Hypertonic Solution is administered, the dosage is 2 g/kg. ==Current status== Currently, osmotherapy is the only way to reduce cerebral edema, and hypertonic saline appears to be better than other osmotic agents. According to some researchers, glycerol can be best administered as a basal treatment whereas mannitol can be administered to control sudden rises in ICP. Compared to mannitol, there's evidence that the improvement in ICP, cerebral blood flow, and CPP due to administration of hypertonic saline lasts longer. In addition, hypertonic saline also shows significant effect in improving blood rheology such as hematocrit and shear rate at the level of the internal carotid artery (ICA). ==Future== Research studies are going on to find more efficient mechanisms to treat cerebral edema. Combining osmotherapy with other treatment mechanisms has a greater potential to treat cerebral edema and its serious pathological effects more effectively. ===RVOT=== Reductive Ventricular Omotherapy (RVOT) could be a novel treatment that manages cerebral edema without the use of osmotic agents. RVOT uses catheters permeable to water vapor to increase osmolarity of CSF. Ex vivo experiments have been carried out to test the efficiency of RVOT. RVOT is done locally, therefore, it's more likely to be efficient in severe cases of cerebral edema. Sweep gas, any gas used to flow through the hollow fiber, flows through RVOT catheter made up of hollow fiber with semipermeable walls to remove free, unbound water from ventricles in the form of water vapor. ===Second tier therapies=== If Osmotherapy using osmotic agents fails in treating cerebral edema, other therapies using barbiturates and corticosteroids could be developed. Barbiturates like pentobarbital can act like free radical scavengers as well decrease intracranial blood volume by reducing cerebral metabolic demand. However, administration of barbiturates poses risks such as hypotension, induced coma and infection limiting their potential clinical application. Although corticosteroids are not very effective in treating cerebral edema resulting from ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, they are very effective in treating vasogenic edema resulting from brain tumors. Idea behind administration of both barbiturates and corticosteroids is to provide space for cerebral swelling resulting from edema, thus, these are very non specific treating methods. ===Novel targets=== Some research focuses on identifying novel targets that prevents formation of cerebral edema. In order to develop strategies that prevent cerebral edema, it's important understand cerebral edema at a molecular level. Targets identified includes: NKCC1, SUR1/ TRPM4 channel, Vasopressin receptor antagonist. NKCCl During early and reperfusion stage of ischemia, there is an upregulation of secondary active cotransporter NKCCl. NKCCl play an important role in modulating loading of sodium and chloride in neurons, glia, endothelial cells and choroid plexus. The upregulation of NKCCl is followed by increased deposition of Sodium(Na) and Chloride in endothelial cells and Na+K+ATPase activity plays a role in expelling Na followed by chloride and water from endothelial cells into extracellular space leading to vasogenic edema. Thus, preventing NKCCl upregulation has the potential to prevent cerebral edema from forming. Bumetanide which can be delivered across the blood brain barrier is an inhibitor of NKCCl. Bumetanide significantly reduces inflammation resulting from TBI. Identifying the right dose of bumetanide that acts as an inhibitor of NKCCl could prevent cerebral edema to some extent. This represents the ATP dependent stage of cerbral edema formation. SUR1/ TRPM4 There is an upregulation of this SUR1/ TRPM4 nonselective cation channel followed by brain tumor, ischemic injury, and traumatic brain injury. This channel which is activated by ATP depletion is found on neurons, neuroglia and endothelium. This channel enables the passive transport of water and solute and represents the ATP independent stage of cerebral formation. Opening of these channels result in cellular depolarization and blebbing causing cytotoxic edema. This can be prevented by using glyburide (glibenclamide) which inhibits these channels. Vasopresin receptor antagonist Vasopressin receptors activated by vasopressin are found on the basolateral membrane of the cells lining the collecting ducts of the kidneys. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) results in hyponatremia which leads to water retention and antidiuretic hormone release causing increase in intracranial pressure and formation of cerebral edema. This can be prevented by administration of conivaptan, a safe FDA approved drug that treats euvolemic hyponatremia. Through the process of aquaresis, conivapten which is a vasopressin receptor antagonist improves serum sodium concentration while eliminating free water without having any negative effect on systolic blood pressure and pulse rate. Since it can decrease cerebral volume and ICP, it has a potential to treat many forms of cerebral edema. ==References== Category:Neurology procedures ","title":"Osmotherapy"},{"id":"6229914","text":"Philippe d'Encausse (born 24 March 1967 in Clermont-Ferrand) is a retired French pole vaulter, whose father, Herv√© d'Encausse, was a European record holder and 1968 Olympic finalist in pole vault.

On the morning of 27 April, depth charges were being unloaded into a lighter when one of them ignited. Several men were organised to fight the fire from the quayside, but to no avail. All the other fighters had withdrawn but George Campbell Henderson, a sub-officer with the dockyard fire service who doggedly held a firehose into the fire. There was an explosion in the lighter, and the fire spread to the Bedenham, causing a violent explosion in which the bow was blown out of the water and onto Gun Wharf, while the rest of the ship sank. ==Casualties== 13 people were killed in the explosion, including Henderson, who was posthumously awarded the George Cross for his bravery in attempting to extinguish the fire. The King's Police and Fire Services Medal (for Gallantry) was posthumously awarded to Albert Alexander Indoe, Chief Fire Officer HM Dockyard, Gibraltar. Two dock workers among them Jose Moss and two traders on nearby Ragged Staff Road were killed by flying debris. One fire fighter was injured. Dock overseer Salvador Bula was injured by the explosion but managed to get others who were injured by the blast to safety. Hundreds were injured and had to be taken to the Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar, then known as the British Military Hospital Gibraltar. The crew of the Bedenham had already abandoned the ship by the time of the explosion, with the exception of the Captain and the Naval Armament Supply Officer, both of whom were blown into the water but subsequently rescued. ==Effect of the explosion== In addition to the human casualties, many of Gibraltar's buildings suffered substantial damage in the explosion, including the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned, the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, and the Convent (the official residence of the Governor of Gibraltar). It was locally recognized that the damage to the town would have been much worse but for the City of Gibraltar's 16th-19th century fortress defensive walls which deflected/took part of the explosion's blast. Another effect of the explosion was to delay the programme of housing necessary for the Gibraltarians who had been repatriated following their evacuation during World War II. The Admiralty accepted full responsibility for the damage, and approximately ¬£250,000 in Gibraltar pounds was paid out in indemnity. The remains of the Bedenham were towed from Gibraltar by the tug Saucy on the 31st May 1952 to the Tyne where they were scrapped.RFA Bedenham, at the RFA Historical site, retrieved 5 April 2015 ==Note== This event should not be confused with the explosion at the Bedenham Pier on Portsmouth Harbour which occurred on 14 July 1950. ==See also== *List of accidents and incidents involving transport or storage of ammunition ==References== * Benady, Tito (1992) The Royal Navy at Gibraltar, pp. 221‚Äì222. * Hebblethwaite, Marion (2006) One Step Further: Those Whose Gallantry Was Rewarded with the George Cross, * Jackson, William (1987) Rock of the Gibraltarians: A History of Gibraltar, p. 297\\\\. * ==Bibliography== * Hissey, Terry.

At the University of Toronto, she majored in English, wrote for the student newspaper The Gargoyle for two years, and edited The Varsity from 1988-1989. In 1990 she earned her BA there at University College. == Career == In 1990s she became Latin American correspondent covering the drug wars of the Medell√≠n Cartel. From 1991-1995 she was in Rio de Janeiro for Toronto's The Globe and Mail. Serving as a foreign correspondent, she covered conflicts in Kosovo for the Globe and Mail, and the war in Angola for the Nationa Post and the Globe and Mail. Since 2008 she has been an investigative reporter for New York Post, covering New York City and corruption. ===Lamont/Spencer criticism=== During the 1990s, Vincent wrote several articles and the book See No Evil about the Ab√≠lio dos Santos Diniz kidnapping case in Brazil. Two young Canadians, David Spencer and Christine Lamont, had been convicted of Diniz's 1989 political kidnapping and confinement and sentenced to 28 years each in Brazilian prisons. Vincent's writing was highly critical of Canadian media and their assumption that Lamont and Spencer must be innocent, attributing those assumptions to prejudices about Brazil. These writings brought Vincent open hostility from the Canadian journalism establishment. However, David Levesque said, \\"She's critical of magazines like Saturday Night and CBC television's Fifth Estate, which ran stories on the case seemingly without consulting the trial transcripts available in English translations.\\" Robert W. Shirley wrote, \\"...the families, lobbyists, several Canadian politicians and much of the Canadian press were unwilling to study the complexities of the case and deliberately created an international incident\\". He said that Vincent made an \\"attempt to understand how two idealistic young Canadians would have become involved in such a case. Vincent presents a wider and darker picture... Her writing is at times rushed and impacted, difficult to follow as she shifts rapidly in time and space. But her summing up of the case is masterful and she addresses some fundamental philosophical questions.\\" David Frum wrote, In 1996, Lamont and Spencer admitted they had participated in the kidnappings. For her work on the Lamont/Spencer case, Vincent received the Canadian Association of Journalists' Award for excellence in investigative journalism and a Southam Fellowship. === Kielburger libel suit === In 1996, Vincent wrote a feature on Craig Kielburger in Saturday Night magazine saying the teenage anti-child labor advocate diverted donations made to his Free the Children charity to his family. Kielburger sued Vincent and the magazine for libel and, in February, 2000, settled for $C 319,000. The National Post editor-in-chief said settling was \\"largely a commercial decision... It was costing us a great deal of time and money. It was time to wind things up.\\" ===Cook sisters book=== As of 2017, Vincent was working on a book and screenplay about the Cook sisters, Ida and Louise, the latter better known as romance writer Mary Burchell, who helped Jews escape Nazi-era Germany, with the possible covert assistance of the British government. ==Books== #See no evil: the strange case of Christine Lamont and David Spencer Reed Books Canada, 1996. #Hitler's silent partners: Swiss banks, Nazi gold, and the pursuit of justice Toronto : A.A.

Stanley Tunney Bridge are a pair of bridges that span Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey, connecting Route 37 in Toms River with Pelican Island and communities along the Jersey Shore on the Barnegat Peninsula. The bridges pass through Toms River and a small piece of Berkeley Township, before ending at Route 35 in Seaside Heights. The Thomas A.

It is a bascule bridge that allows ship traffic to pass under the bridge when it is raised. The J. Stanley Tunney Bridge was completed in 1972 to carry westbound traffic, while the Mathis bridge was dedicated for vehicles traveling eastbound. The Tunney Bridge is a high level girder bridge that was designed to allow tall ships to pass under it without requiring a bridge opening. Although both bridges have three lanes, those on the Tunney Bridge are wider. Because Route 37 is one of a few links to the barrier island beaches, the bridge and the entire highway are routinely jammed with both local and tourist traffic throughout the summer months. ==References External links == *Article on the safety of the spans following Hurricane Sandy *An enlarged view of road jurisdiction on NJ 35 and NJ 37 at the eastern ends of the Mathis / Tunney Bridges Category:Seaside Heights, New Jersey Category:Toms River, New Jersey Category:Bridges in Ocean County, New Jersey Category:Bridges completed in 1950 Category:Bridges completed in 1972 Category:Beam bridges Category:Road bridges in New Jersey Category:1950 establishments in New Jersey Category:1972 establishments in New Jersey Category:Bascule bridges in the United States ","title":"Thomas A.

The phrase is an allusion to the mistake made by dogs when they believe they have chased a prey up a tree, but the game may have escaped by leaping from one tree to another.Walsh, William Shepard. (1909). Handy-book of literary curiosities, p. 80. The phrase means to mistake one's object, or to pursue the wrong course to obtain it. In other words, \\"if you are barking up the wrong tree, it means that you have completely misunderstood something or are totally wrong.\\" ==Historical usage== Barking up the wrong tree became common use in nineteenth century America in reference to hunting raccoons with a hunting dog. When the nocturnal animal takes to a tree, the dog is supposed to remain at the base of the tree until its owner arrives. However, in the dark, if the dog mistakes the tree where the raccoon has taken refuge, the hunter may lose it.

Population: ==History== It traces its history to 1492, when a patrol station was set up to protect the trade route heading from Moscow northward. In 1780, it became the seat of Kadnikovsky Uyezd of Vologda Viceroyalty (since 1796‚ÄîVologda Governorate) and was granted town status. The uyezd, one of the ten in the governorate, comprised vast areas in the central part of modern Vologda Oblast east and northeast of Lake Kubenskoye, as well as the south of modern Arkhangelsk Oblast. However, when a railway was constructed in 1894 from Vologda north to Arkhangelsk, the route bypassed Kadnikov. In the 20th century, the population of Kadnikov declined while that of neighboring Sokol, which is located to the northwest, has grown, and Kadnikov lost its significance as the administrative center. When the uyezds were abolished on July 15, 1929, Kadnikov was included into Sverdlovsky District (later renamed Sokolsky District) of Northern Krai. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated within Sokolsky District as the town of district significance of Kadnikov.Law #371-OZ As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Kadnikov, together with Kadnikovsky and Zamoshsky Selsoviets of Sokolsky District (which comprise, correspondingly, twenty-two and eighteen rural localities, for the total of forty rural localities), is incorporated within Sokolsky Municipal District as Kadnikov Urban Settlement.Law #1121-OD ==EconomyIndustry=== There are timber industry and food industry enterprises in Kadnikov. ===Transportation=== One of the principal highways in Russia, M8, which connects Moscow and Arkhangelsk, crosses Sokolsky District running through the center of Kadnikov. Several kilometers northwest from Kadnikov, in Chekshino, another highway branches off east and runs to Totma and Veliky Ustyug. It provides the shortest connection between Vologda and the destinations in the eastern districts of Vologda Oblast, in particular, Nikolsk, Nyuksenitsa, and Kichmengsky Gorodok. ==Culture and recreation== Ilyinsky Pogost A historical interest attaches to Ilyinsky pogost, comprising a 17th-century five-domed church, a belfry, and a fenced burial ground.

Eir√≠kur is considered to be a talented vocalist, able to adopt various styles. He has been commended by metal enthusiasts for his ability to adopt the styles of various legends of metal, including Bruce Dickinson, Graham Bonnet, Ronnie James Dio and Joey Belladonna. He can also sing in a variety of styles suitable to pop and rock. ==Career== Eir√≠kur's career as a vocalist began in earnest when the song \\"Sekur\\" he wrote and performed with the Icelandic rock group Start was voted the Icelandic song of the year in 1981. In 1984 Eir√≠kur's metal group Dr√Ωsill, released the album \\"Welcome to the show\\" which was released in 1000 copies, which was a considerable feat for a group that published on their own and played music outside the mainstream. In 1985 Eir√≠kur recorded two songs, \\"Gagg√≥-Vest\\" and \\"Gull\\", written by Gunnar √û√≥r√∞arson that both became wildly popular in Iceland. Almost overnight he had become one of the most popular singers in Iceland. Although his interest went with the heavy metal genre, he unpretentiously participated in the pop music scene in Iceland, participating in many group efforts in the 1980s. In 1988 Eir√≠kur moved to √òstfold in Norway to become the vocalist of the power metal group Artch. As their vocalist he's known as Eric Hawk. Their first album, released in 1988, Another return (to Church Hill) received much acclaim by magazines such as Kerrang (5 K's out of 5) and Metal Forces (100 out of 100). Their second album, For the sake of Mankind, was released in 1991 and was well received by the metal community as well. In 1993 Artch drifted apart. In 1999 they teamed up again for an anniversary of the Norwegian Scream Magazine, held some concerts, released a DVD titled Another Return: Live... and Beyond. Metal Blade Records remastered and re-released Artch's two albums in 2000. Artch's bassist, Bernt Jansen, is also known as Flash, Wig Wam's bassist. Through this connection Eir√≠kur has performed backing vocals for Wig Wam. Eir√≠kur was among Iceland's \\"national team\\" of singers who recorded Hj√°lpum √æeim, Iceland's equivalent of Do They Know It's Christmas? and We Are the World. In 1999 Eir√≠kur sang clean vocals on the album Soulburner by Swedish melodic death metal band Gardenian as a guest. Since 2005, Eir√≠kur tours Europe as the vocalist of Ken Hensley's live band called Live Fire. In late 2007, Eir√≠kur was announced as the new lead vocalist of Magic Pie, a Norwegian prog rock band. ==Eurovision== Eir√≠kur has also had more of a history with the Eurovision Song Contest than most heavy metal vocalists can claim. In 1986 Iceland participated in the ESC for the first time and the Icelandic nation was taken with Eurovision fever for the first time. Eir√≠kur performed three songs in the finals on 15 March: *√ûetta gengur ekki lengur written by √ìmar Halld√≥rsson *Gef√∞u m√©r gaum written by Gunnar √û√≥r√∞arson and √ìlafur Haukur S√≠monarson *Mitt √° milli Moskvu og Washington written by Ragnhildur G√≠slad√≥ttir, Jakob Fr√≠mann Magn√∫sson and Valgeir Gu√∞j√≥nsson The night's winner was the song Gle√∞ibankinn, written by Magn√∫s Eir√≠ksson and performed by P√°lmi Gunnarsson. Since this was Iceland's first participation it was decided that a team of prominent singers would be sent with the song to Bergen. Eir√≠kur and Helga M√∂ller joined P√°lmi, forming the vocal trio ICY. Icelanders had high hopes for the song, and official pointers predicted good going, so it came as quite the shock when Gle√∞ibankinn wound up in 16th place with only 19 points.S√∂ngvakeppni Sj√≥nvarpsins 1986 The following year Eir√≠kur performed the song \\"L√≠fi√∞ er lag\\" written by Gunnlaugur Briem and Fri√∞rik Karlsson in the Icelandic national finals. The song wound up in second place, with H√¶gt og hlj√≥tt performed by Halla Margr√©t being sent to Brussels.S√∂ngvakeppni Sj√≥nvarpsins 1987 As a member of the composite Icelandic group Model Eir√≠kur recorded L√≠fi√∞ er lag. The song was released on Model's eponymous album in 1987 and went on to enduring popularity in Iceland.Model - Model By the year 1991 Eir√≠kur had taken up residence in Norway. Norway did not hold a national final that year, but NRK rather approached four artists, Eir√≠kur among them, and asked them to perform at the ESC in Rome.Grand Prix i Norge p√• 90-tallet This quartet participated under the name Just 4 Fun with the song Mrs. Thompson. They placed 17th with 14 points.ESC 1991 Since 2004, Eir√≠kur is one of a board of Eurovision specialists that presented and commented the participant songs in the ESC to the Nordic nations.

He worked in Hollywood for two periods, becoming an American citizen in 1947. After living also in Argentina, he became a naturalized British citizen in 1959. ==BiographyEarly life=== Loder was born in 1898 at 11 Herbert Crescent, Knightsbridge, London.Hollywood Hussar by John Loder, London, 1977, p.9, His father was W. H. M. Lowe, a British career army officer who achieved the rank of general. Patrick Pearse, the leader of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland, surrendered to him. Both were present at the surrender.BBC, 1916 Easter Rising Gallery His mother was Frances Broster (died 29 September 1942), daughter of Francisco de Salvo and his wife of Salerno, Sicily. Frances was widowed when she married Lowe; she had been married to the late Captain Robert Harry Johnson of the 64th Foot Regiment. Loder was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Berkshire. ===World War One=== Loder followed his father into the army, being commissioned into 15th Hussars as a second lieutenant on 17 March 1915, during the First World War. He was immediately sent to Gallipoli where he served until the British withdrawal. From 21 April until early May 1916, Loder was stationed in Ireland, serving as his father‚Äôs ADC, and where they both witnessed the surrender of the leaders of the Easter Rising. He rejoined his Regiment in Rouen, France in May 1916, and was engaged in the 1916 Battle of the Somme. He was taken prisoner by the Germans on 21 March 1918 at the village of Roisel. He was taken to Le Cateau gaol and then by train to the first of several prisoner-of-war camps, at Rastatt, in Baden, Germany.Hollywood Hussar pps:30 & 41-52.

He also appeared in Black Waters (1929), the first British talkie, which was made in the US by producer Herbert Wilcox, and The Unholy Night (1929) at MGM. Loder made some for Pathe: Her Private Affair (1929), The Racketeer (1929), and Rich People (1930). Alexander Korda had also moved to Hollywood and cast Loder in Lilies of the Field (1930).

He supported in an A film, One More Tomorrow (1946) and appeared opposite then-wife Hedy Lamarr in Dishonored Lady (1947). Loder then appeared in a minor Broadway hit in For Love or Money (1947‚Äì48). Around this time he began to focus increasingly on business as opposed to acting. ===Later career=== Loder's later film appearances included British films The Story of Esther Costello (1957), Small Hotel (1957), and Gideon's Day (1958). His last film was The Firechasers (1971). ==Personal life, marriages and children== He was unmarried when he fathered his first son, Robin William Lowe (1925 ‚Äì 29 March 2002).\\"Times\\" Death Notices, 3 April 2002) The boy followed his father to Eton and served in the Grenadier Guards. He later became a theatrical and literary agent, and was married three times. His last marriage was to British actress Hilary Tindall (1938‚Äì1992).

Documentation found after Lamarr's death was reported in 2001 to reveal that James was born to Lamarr and Loder before their marriage. Loder's other wives were Sophie Kabel, Evelyn Auff Mordt, and finally, in 1958, the heiress Alba Julia Lagomarsino of Argentina. After their marriage, he lived on her 25,000-acre cattle ranch and spent much time at the in Buenos Aires. After they divorced in 1972, Loder returned to London.Genealogists' Magazine, vol. 27, no. 7, Society of Genealogists, London, 2002, pps:332-326, \\"Another Englishman Abroad - John Loder and Hedy Lamarr\\" by Charles Kidd, editor of Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage. He resided for some years in a house opposite Harrods department store. In 1947, Loder had become an American citizen. In 1959, he became a naturalised citizen of the United Kingdom. Given his varied residencies, he had been considered of \\"uncertain nationality\\" by that time. ==Later years== He published his autobiography, Hollywood Hussar, in 1977. Loder's general health deteriorated in his eighties, and he was admitted in 1982 to the Distressed Gentlefolks Aid Association's Nursing Home in Vicarage Gate, Kensington.

Picked up by United Feature Syndicate, it began its run under the current title on December 17, 2001. Noel left in 2003, and Kyle Miller replaced him starting April 20 of that year, drawing the strip until June 14, 2008. Many new characters were introduced during Miller's time on the strip and readership increased. Scott Roberts took over on June 16, 2008, and continues to draw it today. All three artists delivered different, personal styles to the comic. === Andre Noel era === During the Noel period Working Daze appeared six days a week, in color online, and in black-and-white in a handful of newspapers. At first it was a single panel gag with a caption beneath. During Noel's run, it changed format to employ word balloons, freeing it to have two or more panels as needed. It fell more in line with the traditional definition of a comic strip, although it retained its original dimensions. Noel experimented with different methods of coloring the strip, initially going for a hand-colored look. Later on, brighter, flatter colors were used, indicating that it was being computer colored. The art was fairly detailed, with a good deal of emphasis on backgrounds. The offices of MacroMicroMedia seemed to be located in a large city high-rise, probably an older building. The style was closer to The New Yorker cartoons than to newspaper strips. === Kyle Miller era === Rather than seek an artist who would mimic Noel's style, Zakour went with Kyle Miller, who brought a whole new look to the strip. Miller's style was clean and spare, more cartoony, and the characters were redesigned to reflect that look. Several new characters made their debut during Miller's time, including Carolina, Kathy, and Medusa. Miller used backgrounds sparingly, often they were only dashes of color. Some readers resisted the change at first, but in time many new readers came on board, and Miller was embraced as a full partner, his style as the true look of the strip. He stayed on much longer, ending a five-year run in 2008. His departure came as an upset to many readers, who were even less willing to accept the change than when he came on. Zakour announced the change well in advance of the actual event, but many were caught by surprise. Miller is a video game designer, and left to concentrate more time on that work. === Scott Roberts era === Roberts had been working with Zakour since they were both a part of the Rugrats comic strip, and contributors to Nickelodeon Magazine. Zakour was hired to write gags for the Rugrats in its final year. Roberts had been writing gags and drawing the feature for five years, originally rotating with other artists and later providing all the penciling. Zakour and Roberts also collaborated on some comic stories for Nick Mag. After the strip folded, they started seeking other projects they could work on together, and peddled a strip that failed to sell. All this laid the groundwork for Zakour asking Roberts to become the new Working Daze artist. Even so, there was a great deal of resistance on the part of longtime readers. Once again, no effort was made to continue the established look. As negative reactions came in, Roberts altered and experimented, trying to find an approach that suited his own view of the characters. But new readers continued to come on board, and the newest were not familiar with the Miller or Noel strips. These readers accepted the Roberts style as the look of the strip. Roberts drew the characters with more attention to anatomic reality, but still cartoony and caricatured, and put far more emphasis on backgrounds. By now it was clear that the company had relocated to an office park somewhere in the suburbs. A key change came in his second year, with use of photo backgrounds. This consists usually of scenes outside the windows of the office, but it can also include outdoor settings, props and set pieces, or images on computer screens. This multimedia approach met with a mixed reaction, some readers disturbed by it, others embracing it. The comments on the Comics.com website increased. The gags occasionally touched upon real issues of the workplace or the economy. Sometimes older gags were dusted off, and reworked by Roberts in the new style. These were never meant to be improvements, but simply, a fresh way to look at the same idea. Roberts continues as the artist, and occasionally contributes to the writing as well. == Characters and story == The characters were inspired by real prototypes the creators knew in the workaday world. * Jay ‚Äî a stand in for writer Zakour (although he does not physically resemble him) * Andrew ‚Äî inspired by artist and co-creator Andre Noel * Rita‚Äî the manager * Ed ‚Äî the overpaid goof-off * Dana‚Äî the overworked assistant * Sue ‚Äî the harried tech writer * Sal‚Äî the clueless service rep * Roy ‚Äî the IT guy and consummate geek, married to Kathy, father of Rey * Carolina ‚Äî the brightest and sexiest worker, smarter than all the guys and too smart to fall for their clumsy advances * Kathy ‚Äî Roy's wife, mother of Rey, almost as geeky as he is but with one foot still in the real world, it's unknown what exactly she does at the office * Andrew - the African-American self-proclaimed \\"effortlessly cool\\" graphics designer * Medusa ‚Äî the Gorgon receptionist; her ability to turn workers to stone appears to be selective, and based upon who annoys her the most * Melvin - the resident jerk * Bernie - the unattractive, clueless perennial temp * Norm - similar to Bernie but older and balding Roy and Dana were minor characters at first but grew to be the most popular.

The band was the first in which Thoms worked with his future Inner City Unit bandmate Ermanno Ghisio Erba aka Dino Ferari, in what would be a long string of collaborations until Thoms' death in 2010. A 2004 posthumous album of the band was reviewed in Classic Rock magazine, a 1978 live performance was reviewed in Melody Maker, the band's 1977 recording session was described at length in a Forced Exposure interview with eyewitness Larry Wallis and the band was euologised in a Record Collector article about Took written by Luke Haines. ==HistoryFormation=== Since leaving Tyrannosaurus Rex in 1969, Took had formed his own band Shagrat with guitarist Larry Wallis. The group had recorded electric and acoustic demos and played at the Phun City festival before dwindling down into a solo acoustic act by Took. In this capacity Took had become a staple of the underground benefit concerts circuit, been the subject of various articles and interviews for the UK music press and performed a set on the BBC Radio London show Breakthrough (hosted by Steve Bradshaw). A 1972 management deal with Tony Secunda and 'seed money' grant from Warner Brothers failed to result in any record releases, although home demos recorded in the basement flat of Secunda's office were released in 1995 by Cleopatra Records. By 1976, Took had returned to London from a lengthy sojourn in the Kent towns of Canterbury and Margate and was loosely rehearsing as Steve Took's Horns with a succession of musicians. The name came from a horned pendant which Took frequently wore. The Horns became a more serious band in mid/late 1977 when Took recruited Thoms and Ghisio-Erba to the band and signed a management contract with Tony Landau, a friend of Turner's since adolescence and stepfather to Took's young son Luke. ===Career=== Through extensive rehearsals (later described by Thoms as \\"the most outrageous misuse of drugs I've ever done while playing music\\")Liner notes to Blow It - The All New Adventures Of Steve Took's Horns, Cherry Red CDM RED 255, 2004 the band compiled a set of songs heavily influenced by The Rolling Stones, The Faces and The Sex Pistols. On 29 November at Pathway Studios in London, the band recorded three of these songs, It's Over, Average Man and Woman I Need. By chance, Took's old collaborator Wallis, a frequent producer at the studio, was on hand for the session. However, disheartened by Took's consumption of considerable alcohol in order to prepare himself to sing, Wallis left before Took completed his vocal. Years later, he expressed surprise and pleasure to learn that in fact Took performed a good vocal for the tracks. Landau approached several record companies with the tape, but was met with wariness due to Took's reputation for drug consumption and unreliability. Eventually a concert was booked as a showcase for the band at Nik Turner's Bohemian Love-In at The Roundhouse on 18 June 1978. The resulting gig, although technically sound, was deemed a disappointment by the band and Took consequently broke up the group. Reviewing the event for Melody Maker, writer Chris Brazier described the band as \\"flagrantly retrogressive hard rock from the sewer of '71.\\" Mike Scott, future singer for The Waterboys, who was in attendance, many years later recalled feeling surprise that the group \\"played boogie-ish rock\\" rather than a more folky mystical act, given Took's past in Tyrannosaurus Rex. He also recalled that Took seemed subdued and that Thoms largely carried the show. ===Aftermath=== Despite the breakup, the Horns had made a considerable impression on Took's circle of acquaintances. Consequently, Turner first recruited Ferari to his Sphynx project, before adding Thoms to form his new band Inner City Unit (known for short as ICU) in 1979. Took was quick to notice that Turner had effectively resurrected his old band - ICU keyboardist Steve Pond recalls Took in 1979 trying to blag his way into the group. This approach proved partly successful as Took frequently guested with Inner City Unit in 1979-1980 with Took, Thoms and Ghisio-Erba performing together in what were effectively Horns reunions. Two bootleg recordings exist of Took performing a cover of \\"Slow Down\\", (previously rehearsed by the Horns) with Inner City Unit - by now featuring Mick Stupp on drums - on 6 May 1980 at Meanwhile Gardens in Notting Hill Gate and 16 June 1980 at Camden's Music Machine. In 1988, Thoms new band Atomgods's debut album WOW! included a track Mountain Range written by Thoms in memory of his time with the Horns. Thoms would later re-record the song in 1997 for Inner City Unit's new album Now You Know The Score. In 2004, 24 years after Took's death, Cherry Red released the Pathway Studios session as the core of an album, Blow It - The All New Adventures Of Steve Took's Horns. In addition to the three 1977 tracks plus an out-take version of Average Man with Took comically improvising after forgetting his lyrics, the CD also featured remixes of the tracks and the 1997 version of Thoms' aforementioned Mountain Range tribute song, plus new recordings of two other Took songs, Ooh My Heart and Too Bad which the Horns had been rehearsing in 1977-1978. These new recordings featured Thoms and Ghisio-Erba together with former Hawkwind frontman Ron Tree on lead vocals and bass. Classic Rock magazine reviewer Hugh Fielder commented on the three original 1977 Horns tracks, \\"They sound a bit like The Faces if Rod Stewart had been replaced by Johnny Thunders. Which has possibilities.\\" On the strength of their collaboration on the Steve Took's Horns CD, Thoms and Tree formed a new band, briefly also featuring Ghisio-Erba. The band was initially known as Inner City Horns - (acronym ICH) then later Inner City Hawks (also ICH) before settling on the name MOAB (Mother Of All Bands). An alternative mix of the Horns song Ooh My Heart, as recorded for the Horns CD, was included as a secret bonus track on the 2005 Amphetibeast Records edition of MOAB's album Insect Brain. Writing about Took's solo/frontman career for Record Collector, former The Auteurs frontman Luke Haines summarised the Horns as \\"a tough pub rock bovver boy group that managed to record a few great songs and typically, again managed to not get them released\\" until \\"[the] Horns material [became] available on the Cherry Red comp Blow It!!! ‚Äì The All New Adventures Of ...\\" ==Line upsStudio session at Pathway Studios 29 November 1977=== *Steve Peregrin Took: Vocals, electric rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar *Trev Thoms: electric lead guitar, backing vocals *Ermanno Ghisio-Erba: drums *Steve Scarsbrook: bass *Jamie Roberts: keyboards ===Live performance at Nik Turner's Bohemian Love-In, The Roundhouse 18 June 1978=== *Steve Peregrin Took: Vocals, electric rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar *Trev Thoms: electric lead guitar, backing vocals *Ermanno Ghisio-Erba: drums *John (a German biker): bass ===New recordings made late 2002 for CD release=== *Ron Tree: lead vocals, bass *Trev Thoms: electric lead guitar, backing and some lead vocals *Ermanno Ghisio- Erba: drums ===Timeline=DiscographyAlbum=== * 2004 - Steve Took's Horns: Blow It!!!

The Arbutus Branch of the BCPL moved itself into a larger space above an A&P; supermarket,\\" just like the branch in Pikesville, while the Parkville community, until 1952, continued to host an independent library which eventually moved to the basement of Saint Ursula's Church.BCPL, \\"Arbutus Branch, History: About This Branch,\\" December 15, 2016.BCPL, \\"Parkville-Carney Branch, History: About This Branch,\\" January 23, 2017.BCPL, \\"Pikesville Branch, History: About This Branch,\\" March 17, 2017. When the Parkville Library closed its doors, the BCPL started to provide library services to the community using a bookmobile. Jumping forward to the 1960s, the BCPL branches improved by leaps and bounds. In 1961, the Parkville Branch opened at rented quarters, the Cockeysville Branch opened in a \\"3,000 square feet building,\\" and the Reistertown Branch, which occupies a building dating back to the 1820s when it was Franklin Academy, was created.BCPL, \\"Reisterstown Branch, History: About This Branch,\\" December 20, 2016. In the following years there were more improvements. For one, in 1962, the Arbutus Branch moved to a \\"more modern building\\" on Sulphur Spring Road, and the year after that, the current Catonsville Branch was dedicated on a site which was \\"rumored to have been Castle Thunder, home of English businessman Richard Caton and Polly Carroll,\\" the latter who was the daughter of Charles Carroll, a singer of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.BCPL, \\"Catonsville Branch, History: About This Branch,\\" October 5, 2016.

Many years later, in January 1968, the Cockeysville Branch \\"was expanded...to an 11,000 square foot facility.\\" In the 1970s, the BCPL system again expanded. In January 1971, the Parkville-Carney Branch opened at its current location, renamed from the Parkville Branch after \\"an appeal by residents of Carney to show that both communities were served by the facility. Years later, in May 1974, the current structure which comprises the Towson Branch was constructed, which is in a brutalist style.BCPL, \\"Towson Branch, History: About This Branch,\\" December 9, 2016.Loni Ingram, \\"Towson Library celebrates 40 years at current site on May 17,\\" The Baltimore Sun, May 15, 2014. ===The BCPL System in the 1980s and 1990s=== In the 1980s the library system again changed with the times. In February 1982, the Cockeyville Branch opened at its current location, being one \\"of the first libraries in the nation featuring open-face bookstore display shelving and neon signage.\\" The same year the Pikesville Branch opened on the Pikesville Community Center's first level, a building which currently \\"houses a senior center and a health center\\" as well. The following year, the PTA of Hereford High School initiated the idea for a library in the Northern part of Baltimore County.BCPL, \\"Hereford Branch, History: About This Branch,\\" February 24, 2017. In later years, the Towson Branch would be recognized for its accomplishments. In 1985, the Baltimore City Paper would give the branch the \\"Best Library award\\" and the year after that the County Executive would recognize the branch for its \\"outstanding contributions\\" to the community. Two years later, in 1988, the Hereford Branch opened \\"on the first floor of the Hereford Center building\\" with Dennis Rasmussen, then County Executive and Dutch Ruppersberger, then a County Councilman, cutting the ribbon to open the facility. The same year the White Marsh Branch opened in \\"15,000 square-foot\\" facility, which is within the current White Marsh Town Center.BCPL, \\"White Marsh Branch, History: About This Branch,\\" March 21, 2017. In the 1990s, there were further changes. The Towson Branch was expanded in 1990, becoming a \\"landmark building in the heart of Towson.\\" The same year all branches of the BCPL were closed for Staff Day.The Baltimore Sun, \\"Staff Day to close county's libraries,\\" October 3, 1990. In later years, the Reisterstown Branch was renovated, in 1995, with an expanded \\"parking lot and a 1,800 square foot addition,\\" and the Heidelbach Memorial Garden, in the Catonsville Branch, was dedicated after a push by the Catonsville Garden Club.In the Heidelbach Memorial Garden, \\"each panel depicts a scene from a children's literature classic and was created by the students of Hillcrest, Maiden Choice, Catonsville Middle, Saint Mark's, Westowne, Saint Agnes, Saint Paul, and Delrey schools.\\" ===The BCPL System in the 21st century=== In the 2000s numerous BCPL branches were expanded. In 2001 the Towson Branch added a \\"medieval castle with arched windows, turrets and a majestic entrance\\" in the children's area of the library to, hopefully, \\"make more families decide to spend their together time at the library rather than at a mall.\\"Lynn Anderson, \\"Reading in a fantasy world,\\" The Baltimore Sun, May 13, 2001. The following year, the Hereford Branch expanded \\"to 7,500 square feet\\" and extended operating hours 2006, with the Pikeville Branch expanded with a \\"$3.6 million expansion and renovation\\" and re-opened in July 2007. In 2009, the existing Perry Hall Branch \\"was replaced by the current 25,000 square foot green building\\" which currently sits on Honeygo Boulevard and the Cockeysville Branch was renovated. In 2010, the Perry Hall Branch added a reading garden which includes \\"benches, sculptures...a picturesque view of the small nearby pond\\" and a walkway that is \\"made of recycled materials from the renovation of the North Point Branch plaza\\" the same year. Also that year, the Arbutus Branch moved to a new $11 million \\"library, community center and senior center\\" on Sulphur Spring Road, which is a 25,000 square foot space and is a certified LEED silver building. The following year, in 2011, The Baltimore Sun reported that an FBI agent, Kyra M. Dressler, \\"asked a federal judge to sign search warrants for computers and hard drives in the Baltimore County Public Library's branches in Woodlawn and Catonsville,\\" where a Nicaraguan-born man named Antonio Martinez, who they suspected of being a \\"terrorist,\\" had reportedly used the library's public computers.Nick Madigan, \\"Man accused in Catonsville bomb plot urged holy war, feds say,\\" The Baltimore Sun, February 10, 2011. The article adds that FBI agents watched him, as he \\"pulled up jihadist videos on computers in Baltimore County libraries,\\" accessing \\"the Internet about 481 times at county libraries, and remained logged on an average of one to two hours\\". At one point he lost access to the library computers because he had failed to pay a $10.50 fine, but regained access by using his stepfather's library card. The same year \\"a $30 million, six-story building\\" which houses the Owings Mills Branch and the \\"center for the Community College of Baltimore County\\" began to be constructed, and was completed in 2013.Raven L. Hill, \\"Start of Owings Mills development raises hopes,\\" The Baltimore Sun, July 28, 2011.

Also in 2014, Kevin Kamenetz proposed a controversial plan for shifting IT positions within the BCPL system. His budget involved the transfer of 28 positions within the system \\"to the county's Office of Information Technology (OIT) starting July 1\\" with administration officials saying it would make the government \\"more efficient\\" with no cuts in jobs, but library advocates across the state worried that this did not follow due process and set a bad precedent.Alison Knezevich, \\"Librarians question Baltimore County plan to shift IT positions,\\" The Baltimore Sun, May 21, 2014. Paula Miller, formerly the head of the Pikes Peak Library District in El Paso County, Colorado, was chosen as the new administrator of the BCPL library system.Alison Knezevich, \\"New Baltimore County libraries chief named,\\" The Baltimore Sun, May 2, 2014. Not only was she \\"the first woman to serve in that role\\" but she was the fourth director of the system since 1948. In 2015 and 2016, the Hereford Branch's renovation was sped up. In July 2015, a broken water pipe damaged the interior of the Branch, closing it for one year so it could \\"undergo the $3 million extensive renovation and expansion,\\" and it was reopened in June 2016 with increased space for \\"books, computers and meeting areas,\\" covering a total of 15,000 square feet, including \\"self-service kiosks for checking out books, several computers for public use, a bar with outlets for laptop use,\\" among other aspects. ==Public services== The BCPL library system provides many public services. These include foreign language materials, local history resources, online databases, showing of films within library branches, and much more, in an effort to generate community participation. ===Foreign languages and local history=== Numerous foreign language resources are available across the library system.

The school has approximately 1,340 pupils, and became an Academy in 2011. In September 2005, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) awarded the school specialist school status in Mathematics & Computing. ==History== The school was the first state grammar school for girls in Buckinghamshire when it opened in 1901 with eighteen pupils. In 1901, the school was housed in the Clock House in Frogmoor, High Wycombe. At that time, enrolment was 18 fee-paying pupils and three staff. Miss Mary Christie M.A. was the first headmistress. The school moved to Benjamin Road in 1906 where it remained for 50 years, except for a time during the First World War when it was evacuated to the old grammar school so that Benjamin Road buildings could be used as a military hospital. By 1922 the school had 300 pupils and was rapidly expanding. The school acquired its status as a Voluntary Controlled Girl's Grammar School in 1944. By 1956 the number of girls wishing to attend the school was so great that the school moved again to new premises that were built at the present site on Marlow Hill. It won the BBC Radio quiz show Top of the Form in 1959. Over the years, additional buildings have been added to the school - with Technology, Sport and Drama blocks being some of the latest additions. These were built to allow for the extra 300 pupils and staff that arrived when Lady Verney High School joined with Wycombe High in 1993. The most recent addition is a new music centre which opened in the summer term in 2015. The school houses a well-resourced library, conference facilities, and the school archive. ==Curriculum== Subjects taught at Wycombe High School from Year 7 are: English, Maths, Science, Art, Spanish, History, Geography, French, Latin, Religious Studies, Physical Education, Drama and Technology (alternating between Graphics, Textiles and Food throughout the year). From September 2010, Wycombe High School introduced a new scheme where Year 9 pupils begin two chosen GCSEs. The pupils choose four GCSE subjects (two to start in Year 9, two to start in Year 10), as well as studying the compulsory core subjects‚ÄîEnglish Language, English Literature, Maths, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and a short course in Citizenship. In Year 9, pupils also take part in five \\"Enrichment Courses\\" of their choice, however this ended in 2017, after the realisation that this system did not increase the levels of exceptional GCSE grades. ==Notable former pupils== * Julia Bone, tennis player * Rita Clifton CBE, advertising executive * Gladys Colton, headmistress of City of London School for Girls, 1949 to 1972\\"COLTON, Gladys M.\\", in Who Was Who 1981‚Äì1990 (London: A. & C.

Published in 2003, the book recounts the heart-stopping achievement of Philippe Petit, a French man who, on an August morning in 1974, walked, lay, knelt and danced on a tightrope wire between the roofs of the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a quarter mile above the ground. Gerstein won the 2004 Caldecott Medal for his illustrations.American Library Association: \\"2004, Mordicai Gerstein\\", Caldecott Medal Winners, 1938 - Present], American Library Association, URL accessed 27 May 2009. The book has been adapted to film and ballet. ==Synopsis== The Man Who Walked Between The Towers follows the French street performer Philippe Petit in an illustrated children's book made by author Mordicai Gerstein. Philippe Petit had an idea to walk a wire between the twin towers and acted upon it with much planning and setting up. He had once walked a wire on the Notre Dame where he lived in Paris, France. Early on an August morning, since the towers were not quite finished, Philippe Petit and his friend dressed up as construction workers and went up the south tower. They took 440 lbs of cable into the elevator, took it to the top 10 floors, and waited until nightfall. Then they carried everything up 180 stairs onto the roof. At midnight, two more friends came to help and tied a line through an arrow and shot it across to Philippe 140 feet away. It missed and landed on a ledge; Philippe crawled down the ledge of the tower to get the arrow. To the line he attached a stronger line, which his friends pulled back and he tied it to a cable that was 5/8 of an inch thick. The cable was so heavy that it took them 3 hours to secure the line from across the two towers. By past dawn of August 7, 1974, they had tightened it between the towers. Philippe then put on his black shirt and tights and picked up his 28-foot balancing pole and started walking on the wire. He felt, \\"Alone and absolutely free\\", as author Mordecai Gerstein writes. The bystanders noticed someone walking between the two towers and quickly notified the police. Officers rushed to the roof of the towers and yelled to Philippe, \\"You're under arrest!\\" For almost an hour Philippe walked, danced, and leaped back and forth between the wire. He even laid down to rest. When he felt completely satisfied, he walked towards the tower and held out his wrists towards the handcuffs. They brought Philippe to court and the judge sentenced him to perform in the park for the children of the city. This he did happily, though during his performance some kids jerked his wire and Philippe fell but caught himself. Now the towers are gone (due to 9/11) but the memory remains of August 7, 1974 when a man walked between the towers. ==Adaptations== The book was adapted as an animated short film of the same name in 2005 by Michael Sporn for Weston Woods Studios.\\"The Man Who Walked Between the Towers\\". Retrieved 2006-09-18. It was narrated by Jake Gyllenhaal.

It is included as an extra on the DVD of the Oscar-winning British documentary film Man on Wire (2008). The book was also adapted as a two-act ballet of the same name at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. It was conceived, choreographed and directed by Paule Turner, premiering in December 2008 to exceptionally good reviews.'Towers' an all-around dance department hit\\".

The Walk, a biographical drama starring Joseph Gordon- Levitt as Philippe Petit, was released in September 2015. ==Critical reception== The Man Who Walked Between The Towers was published to very strong and heartfelt reviews for the story and the illustrations by Gerstein. Kirkus Reviews said, \\"Readers of all ages will return to this again and again for its history, adventure, humor, and breathtaking homage to extraordinary buildings and a remarkable man.\\" Publishers Weekly described it as \\"Gerstein's dramatic paintings include some perspectives bound to take any reader's breath away.

Until April 2003, IMBs in prisons were known as Boards of Visitors and IMBs in immigration removal centres were known as Visiting Committees. Boards consist of members of the public who are unpaid volunteers who are appointed by the Minister of Justice to fulfill this task.

It source is in the Pyrenean Serra del Cad√≠ in the municipality of Castellar de n'Hug (Bergued√†) and its valley is one of the main north-south communication routes in Catalonia. The Aran Valley is the upper valley of the Garonne (la Garona in Catalan, era Garona in Aranese), an Atlantic river which meets the sea near Bordeaux, France. The boundaries of the comarca do not correspond exactly with the watershed, and both the Noguera Ribagor√ßana and the Noguera Pallaresa have their sources on its territory. The frontier between Catalonia and the Valencian Community is formed for much of its length by the S√©nia, while the Noguera Ribagor√ßana forms the frontier with Aragon for much of its length. == List == Rivers are listed according to their estuaries, from north to south along the Catalan coastline, or according to the point of confluence, from the sea to the source, for rivers which do not flow directly into the sea. Names are given in Catalan with the appropriate definite article: Spanish names are given in parentheses. Catalan names are usually preferred in English language works, except for the Ebre which is usually referred to by its Spanish name Ebro. *la Muga **el Manol *el Fluvi√† *el Ter *la Tordera *el Bes√≤s **el Congost **el Ripoll *el Llobregat **l'Anoia **el Cardener **la Gavarresa *el Foix *el Gai√† *el Francol√≠ *l' Ebre **el Segre ***la Noguera Ribagor√ßana ***el Set ***el Corb ***el Si√≥ ***la Noguera Pallaresa ***el Cinca ***el Rialb ***el Llobreg√≥s ***la Valira *la S√©nia == Linguistic note == The Catalan language has two words for \\"river\\", riu and riera. The word riera is used for smaller rivers and for streams, and often indicates a seasonal river. Of the above list, only the Gavarresa is commonly classified as a riera, all the others being qualified as rius. The grammatical gender of Anoia is feminine, while that of Ebre is masculine. == Economic importance == The main economic importance of the Catalan rivers is probably the role of their valleys as communication routes, particularly through the Coastal and Prelitteral Ranges. Hence routes inland from Barcelona pass either through the valley of the Llobregat or that of the Bes√≤s, and the Francol√≠ valley is an important route inland from Tarragona. === Irrigation === Irrigation is important in the drier areas of Catalonia, notably in the Central Depression and in the south.

It is one of the most common fields of employment for meteorologists. World War II brought great advances in meteorology as large-scale military land, sea, and air campaigns were highly dependent on weather, particularly forecasts provided by the Royal Navy, Met Office and USAAF for the Normandy landing and strategic bombing. University meteorology departments grew rapidly as the military services sent cadets to be trained as weather officers. Wartime technological developments such as radar also proved to be valuable meteorological observing systems. More recently, the use of satellites in space has contributed extensively to military meteorology.

In 1805 he became private chaplain to Charles Brodrick, Archbishop of Cashel, and in 1809 he became rector of Abingdon, County Limerick, where his curate was Charles Forster, his lifelong friend and first biographer.

In 1812 he was seriously injured in a carriage accident; the injuries were poorly treated by his medical advisers, and he probably never fully recovered his health.Gordon p.260 In 1821 he became archdeacon of Emly. For his services in maintaining order in the district of Emly during the disturbances that followed the outbreak of famine in the west of Ireland in 1822, he was made Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe in that year.Gordon p.260 As bishop, he is credited with raising the academic standard for candidates for holy orders: he often quoted an old saying that candidates might deceive him about their Godliness, but not about their scholarship.Gordon p.260 In 1827 he had a stroke, which left him largely incapacitated physically, and afterwards he spent his time in various places in England, devoting himself to writing, in particular the celebrated correspondence with his friend Alexander Knox, for which he is chiefly remembered.

It was the indirect predecessor of the Democratic Party (DP), which has been one of the three major parties in Luxembourg since the Second World War. For the first decade of its existence, the Liberal League maintained the liberal dominance under Prime Minister Paul Eyschen. In 1908, they formed an alliance with the Socialists, leading to confrontations with the Party of the Right over secularism. During the First World War, the party lost much of its advantage, and was replaced as the dominant party by the Party of the Right. In the early 1920s, riven by rivalries between its classical liberal and progressive wings, the party collapsed. ==Foundation== The liberal Liberal League was founded in 1904 as a formalisation of the decentralised ideological alliance already existing within the Chamber of Deputies, under the leadership of the classical liberal Robert Brasseur.Hearl (1988), p. 378 The liberal faction was predominantly supported by the entrepreneurial and middle classes. Nonetheless, in 1908, the Liberal League and the Socialist Party (formed in 1902) formed a seemingly unlikely alliance, called the 'Left Bloc' (Bloc de la Gauche) in Esch-sur-Alzette. The main aim of this alliance was to ensure and extend the secularism of the state, which they saw as being under attack from the overtly Roman Catholic conservative grouping; secularisation of the school system was the major policy on which they fought the elections of 1908, 1911, and 1912.Trausch (1981), p. 101 The liberals were the dominant force, and the chief liberal, Paul Eyschen, had been Prime Minister for sixteen years (and would be for another eleven). However, despite Eyschen's support for the party and the clear legislative support for Eyschen amongst the party's large representation in the Chamber, he never formally enrolled in the party. Similarly, neither did his cabinet ministers, which would have major repercussions for the party after Eyschen's death, in 1915. The informality of the arrangement would lead to the collapse of the liberal-led governments of Mathias Mongenast and Victor Thorn; the former was forced out by Grand Duchess Marie-Ad√©la√Øde, whilst the former was brought down by a cross-party motion of no confidence. Despite these reverses, the Liberal League still maintained considerable power in the Chamber of Deputies until the end of the German occupation. However, after the war, a host of constitutional amendments undermined their power base. Most notably, the liberals were harmed by the introduction of female suffrage; women were thought of as leaning towards the conservatives, undermining the liberals' hitherto unchallenged advantage in Luxembourg City and other cities.Thewes (2003), p. 78 ==Collapse== The expansion of suffrage, together with the loss of the old guard that had dominated Luxembourgian politics for the previous thirty years, caused the Liberal League's political base to be eroded. Two ideological groupings emerged in the party: the 'old' classical liberals and the 'young' progressive liberals.Hearl (1988), pp. 378‚Äì9 The former camp was led by Robert Brasseur, whilst the latter was led by Gaston Diderich.Hearl (1988), p. 379 A deputy from the Socialists defected to the Liberal League, forming a 'radical socialist' caucus within the party that was openly opposed to Brasseur's leadership. In 1925, the old liberals were virtually wiped out, leading to the collapse of the party. The party was succeeded by the Radical Socialist Party, the Liberal Left, the Radical Party. In 1932, the parties re-united under the name of the Radical Liberal Party, which would go on to become the nucleus of the modern Democratic Party after the war.Thewes (2003), p. 123 ==See also== * Liberalism in Luxembourg, for a more comprehensive overview of its ideological successors ==FootnotesReferences== * * * Category:Liberal parties in Luxembourg Category:Defunct political parties in Luxembourg Category:Defunct liberal political parties Category:Political parties established in 1904 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1925 Category:Secularism in Luxembourg Category:History of Luxembourg (1890‚Äì1945) ","title":"Liberal League (Luxembourg)"},{"id":"6230493","text":"La Pobla de Claramunt is a municipality in the comarca of the Anoia in Catalonia, Spain.

The town is served by the C-241 road from Igualada to Manresa, and the main N-II road from Barcelona to Lleida runs through the municipality. The Igualada-√ídena aerodrome is located at the south of the √ídena municipality. The airdrome is home to the Aerosport airshow that takes place every year in April or May.

Physical and occupational therapists and chiropractors often use this approach to retrain patients with movement disorders. Interventions are designed to incorporate task and context specific practice in areas meaningful to each patient, with an overall goal of functional independence. For example, exercises that mimic what patients did at home or work may be included in treatment in order to help them return to their lives or jobs after an injury or surgery. Thus if a patient's job required repeatedly heavy lifting, rehabilitation would be targeted towards heavy lifting, if the patient were a parent of young children, it would be targeted towards moderate lifting and endurance, and if the patient were a marathon runner, training would be targeted towards re-building endurance. However, treatments are designed after careful consideration of the patient's condition, what he or she would like to achieve, and ensuring goals of treatment are realistic and achievable. Functional training attempts to adapt or develop exercises which allow individuals to perform the activities of daily life more easily and without injuries. In the context of body building, functional training involves mainly weight bearing activities targeted at core muscles of the abdomen and lower back. Fabio Martella wrote that most fitness facilities have a variety of weight training machines which target and isolate specific muscles. As a result, the movements do not necessarily bear any relationship to the movements people make in their regular activities or sports. In rehabilitation, training does not necessarily have to involve weight bearing activities, but can target any task or a combination of tasks that a patient is having difficulty with. Balance training, for example, is often incorporated into a patient's treatment plan if it has been impaired after injury or disease. == Evidence == Rehabilitation after stroke has evolved over the past 15 years from conventional treatment techniques to task specific training techniques which involve training of basic functions, skills and endurance (muscular and cardiovascular). Functional training has been well supported in evidenced based research for rehabilitation of this population.\\"Upper extremity interventions\\" , Evidence-based review of stroke rehabilitation It has been shown that task specific training yields long- lasting cortical reorganization which is specific to the areas of the brain being used with each task. Studies have also shown that patients make larger gains in functional tasks used in their rehabilitation and since they are more likely to continue practicing these tasks in everyday living, better results during follow-up are obtained. == Equipment == Some options include: * Clubbells * Macebells * Cable machines * Barbells * Dumbbells * Medicine balls * Kettlebells * Bodyweight training * Physioballs (also called Swiss balls or exercise balls) * Resistance tubes * Rocker and wobble boards * Whole Body Vibration equipment (also called WBV or Acceleration Training) * Balance disks * Sandbags * Suspension system * Slideboard * Redcord * Ropes In rehabilitation however, equipment is mainly chosen by its relevance to the patient. In many cases equipment needs are minimal and include things that are familiar and useful to the patient. ===Cable machines=== Cable machines, also known as pulley machines, are large upright machines, either with a single pulley, or else a pulley attached to both sides. They allow an athlete to recruit all major muscle groups while moving in multiple planes. Cable machines also provide a smooth, continuous action which reduces the need for momentum to start repetitions, provide a constant tension on the muscle, peak- contraction is possible at the top of each rep, a safe means of performing negative repetitions, and a variety of attachments that allow great flexibility in the exercises performed and body parts targeted. == Components of a functional exercise program == To be effective, a functional exercise program should include a number of different elements which can be adapted to an individual's needs or goals: * Based on functional tasks directed toward everyday life activities. * Individualized ‚Äì a training program should be tailored to each individual. Any program must be specific to the goals of an individual, focusing on meaningful tasks. It must also be specific to the individual state of health, including presence or history of injury. An assessment should be performed to help guide exercise selection and training load. * Integrated ‚Äì It should include a variety of exercises that work on flexibility, core, balance, strength and power, focusing on multiple movement planes. * Progressive ‚Äì Progressive training steadily increases the difficulty of the task. * Periodized ‚Äì mainly by training with distributed practice and varying the tasks. * Repeated frequently. * Use of real life object manipulation. * Performed in context-specific environments. * Feedback should be incorporated following performance (self-feedback of success is used as well as trainer/therapist feedback). ==References== Category:Physical exercise Category:Weight training Category:Aerobic exercise ","title":"Functional training"},{"id":"6230661","text":"Pallej√† () is a municipality in the comarca of the Baix Llobregat in Catalonia, Spain.

The message may be given by the pastor or a lay leader (such as the superintendent of Christian education). For a typical message, the children are asked to gather at the chancel steps and face the pews.

When premiered at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin its anti-Catholic stance caused enormous controversy with its author denounced in pulpits up and down the country. Defenders included the then President of Ireland who argued that the play was, along with The Playboy of the Western World and Juno and the Paycock, one of the greatest of Irish dramas. The trauma of the play's rejection caused Murphy to withdraw from playwriting altogether for a few years. When it was revived in a substantially rewritten version at the Abbey in 2001 and then at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester in 2003 it was re-evaluated as one of Murphy's best plays and was enormously successful with audiences. A production of The Sanctuary Lamp received its London premiere in London at the Arcola Theatre in Dalston, between 10 March - 3 April 2010 in a production directed by Tom Murphy himself. ==The Play - 1975 and post-1975 versions== The Sanctuary Lamp centres on four central characters - Harry Stone, a Jewish strongman who, having been sacked from the circus, has gone freelance, Francisco, the Irish juggler who was sacked with him, Maudie, a young girl and the Monsignor who presides over the Church in which Harry takes refuge. In the original 1975 version the play unfolds over three acts. The first begins outside the Monsignor's church with Harry begging before hiding inside when Francisco appears, searching for him. As Harry finds himself listening to the Monsignor's sermon, Francisco makes an exhibition of himself, hurling abuse at the Catholic faith. After he is ejected, Harry and the Monsignor meet and, in an act of kindness towards a man in need, the Monsignor offers Harry the job of caretaker in the church. This Act is almost entirely omitted in the post-1975 version which begins with Harry's meeting with the Monsignor. Both versions share the action of the remaining two acts. As Harry shelters in the church it emerges he has not only been sacked from the circus but has walked out on his troupe of freelancers which includes Francisco, Olga, his wife and a dwarf called Samuel. Harry has rejected them because of an affair Francisco has had with Olga. In the church Harry befriends a waif-like young girl, Maudie, who is also sheltering in the church in the belief that somehow she will find forgiveness for some of the terrible things that have happened to her. Harry undertakes to protect Maudie - largely because she reminds him of his own daughter, Teresa, who died of consumption. Their plans are ruined when Francisco appears in search of his old friend. As the two men confront each other lies and self-deceits are stripped away and all go through their own dark night of the soul. But, having purged themselves of the past, the three resolve to go back into the world the next day, somehow reconciled and able to find their own private visions of redemption. ==Themes== The Sanctuary Lamp explores major themes of redemption, love, guilt, spirituality and the existence - or non-existence - of God. Its portrait of the struggle of down-and-outs looking to find some kind of meaning to their lives is reminiscent of Maxim Gorki's The Lower Depths. In common with much of Murphy's work the play deals with the battle against nihilism and finds a form of redemption and hope in mankind's ability to show compassion, love and find an individual spirituality. The Lamp itself becomes an image of the light of the human soul unattached to dogma or religion. Also in common with Murphy's other plays it mixes realism with an elegiac lyricism, the stark reality of the characters' suffering and destitution contrasting with the poetic aspiration of their souls. A twenty-minute speech delivered by Harry alone to the Lamp where he thinks God resides is a particularly masterful example of this. ==See also== *Tom Murphy *Catholicism *Christianity *Judaism == External Links == * The Sanctuary Lamp at The Irish Times Culture news. * ‚ÄòThe Sanctuary Lamp‚Äô Outrages at the Abbey 1975 - Interview with Murphy about his play at RT√â Archives. * The Sanctuary Lamp review at The Guardian Culture section. * The Sanctuary Lamp at the Abbey Theatre Archives.

It is situated on the left bank of the Llobregat river, on the A-7 autopista from Valencia to La Jonquera and the main N-II road. Its location has made Molins de Rei a strategic and dynamic municipality, with significant examples of commercial and industrial entrepreneurship. ==History== Its name, Molins de Rei (which means King's Mills), has its origins in the royal windmills that existed in this area, documented as early as 1188. These mills were built by order of the King Alfonso II, and their construction essentially established the municipality. By 1208, a parish and church as well as a cemetery had been built in the town. In 1309, the town was part of the county of Pallars which belonged to the countess Sibil¬∑la. When she died, the town changed owners to Hugo de Arborea and later on, it was transferred to the convent of Santa Clara in Sardinia (Italy). Again in 1366, the lands were purchased by Berenguer de Relat. In 1430, it was again transferred to Galceran de Requesens i de Santacoloma who built a palace in the village, visited by personalities of the time such as the Catholic Monarchs or Christopher Columbus. In 1763 a bridge was built to cross the Llobregat river, by order of the King Charles III of Spain. This bridge turned the village into a strategic location during the Peninsular War, and the town was subjected to grave attacks and fires in several occasions. During these attacks, several significant buildings were destroyed, such as the Palace of Requesens. ==Main sights== The Palace of Recasens, ruined by a looting during the 19th century, dates from the 15th century. Outside the town are the ruins of the Castellciur√≥ castle, built in 1066‚Äîperhaps over a previous Visigoth fortification‚Äî and destroyed in 985 by troops of al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir. Remains include a tower and parts of the walls. The Romanesque chapel of Sant Pere de Roman√≠, known from 1011, has a rectangular shape, with a barrel vaulted ceiling, and a bell tower. == Transportation == The Molins de Rei train station is served by RENFE railway lines R1 and R4 which run frequently to and from central Barcelona, taking roughly 25 minutes to and from Pla√ßa Catalunya. Local buses also connect the town to central Barcelona and since it is in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area, a tourist will be able to find the distinctive yellow taxis in the square where the Avinguda de Barcelona and the Avinguda de Val√®ncia meet. In addition, the town is served by the C-1413 road to Sabadell. == Notable people == * Luis de Requesens y Z√∫√±iga, 16th-century Spanish diplomat and politician * Agust√≠ Roc Amador (born 1971), ski mountaineer and long-distance runner * Margarita Xirgu (1888-1969), international actress. * Miquel Carbonell Selva (1854-1896), portrait and landscape painter ==Twin towns== * Lorca, Spain * Chinandega, Nicaragua ==References== * Panareda Clop√©s, Josep Maria; Rios Calvet, Jaume; Rabella Vives, Josep Maria (1989).

It is in its fourth edition: Tokyo NOVA The Detonation. It supports stories in the cyberpunk, hardboiled crime fiction, and contemporary fantasy genres. The setting is an alternate near-future Tokyo called \\"Tokyo NOVA\\", after a pole shift. Tokyo NOVA is a dangerous and attractive city. Playing cards are used instead of dice in the Tokyo NOVA system. The suits of cards correspond to four abilities: Spade (‚ô†) is reason, club (‚ô£) is passion, heart (‚ô•) is life, and diamond (‚ô¶) is mundaneness. This system is similar to that used by Castle Falkenstein, which Tokyo NOVA predates by a year. The game features a \\"style\\" system, which somewhat corresponds to a character class system but represents not only the abilities and occupations of the characters but also ways of life.

It is worn by many high school and college American football teams, most popularly by the University of Michigan Wolverines. ==History== A full-size replica of the 1933 Michigan State gold and black winged helmet Early football helmet designs incorporated panels of leather, which were sometimes manufactured using strips of contrasting color. The Ohio State Buckeyes football featured with a winged front panel in a lighter color than the rest of the helmet. The team had returned to the single-tone leather helmets by 1934. The Indiana and Michigan State football teams also adopted variations on the design. Michigan State's helmet used a colored stripe (matching the color of the wings) running down the spine of the helmet, while Indiana's version featured three such stripes, nearly identical to the form used today. The Georgetown Hoyas also used a winged helmet for several seasons during the 1930s and 1940s. Famed football coach Herbert \\"Fritz\\" Crisler is credited with popularizing the winged helmet nationwide. In 1935, while head coach at Princeton University, Crisler ordered stock helmets bearing leather wings out of the Spalding catalog. He had the leather panels painted in contrasting orange and black colors, believing the design to have practical advantages on the field. In 1938, Crisler became head football coach and athletic director at the University of Michigan, where he added maize and blue coloring to the stock design. These helmets made their debut at the Wolverines' 1938 season opener against Michigan State and have been worn ever since. It has become an icon of Michigan's football program, which held it exclusively for more than seventy years. Crisler once recalled his rationale for the design: \\"Michigan had a plain black helmet and we wanted to dress it up a little. We added some color and used the same basic helmet I had designed at Princeton.\\" There was one other consideration. Crisler thought this unique helmet could be helpful to his passers as they tried to spot their receivers downfield. \\"There was a tendency to use different-colored helmets just for receivers in those days, but I always thought that would be as helpful for the defense as for the offense,\\" said Crisler. Princeton abandoned the design after Crisler left in 1938, but in 1998, resurrected the winged design (in orange and black) for the Princeton Tigers. When David M. Nelson, a former Michigan player, became the head coach of the University of Delaware's football team in 1951, Delaware began using a blue and gold winged helmet, which they use to this day. Several high school teams across the country have also adopted the design. Other athletic teams from the University of Michigan have incorporated the design into their headgear, including ice and field hockey, baseball, softball, lacrosse, rowing and swimming. In 1996, the Connecticut Coyotes of the Arena Football League wore red, white, and blue winged helmets,. There is also evidence that several early National Football League teams wore the winged helmet. The New York Giants wore an early version of the winged helmet in 1930‚Äì1931. The Chicago Bears used the winged helmet in 1931 and 1932. The Frankford Yellow Jackets wore the winged helmet in 1931 before the franchise folded due to the Great Depression. The Yellow Jackets successors, the Philadelphia Eagles, used the Yellow Jackets old uniforms (including the winged helmets) for their first two seasons in the NFL, and would later use replicas as a throwback uniform during the 2007 season.http://www.gridiron- uniforms.com/GUD/images/1933_Philadelphia.pnghttp://www.gridiron- uniforms.com/GUD/images/1934_Philadelphia.png The short-lived Cincinnati Reds also used a winged helmet in 1933.http://www.gridiron- uniforms.com/GUD/images/1933_Cincinnati.png The Pittsburgh Pirates (now the Pittsburgh Steelers) wore the winged helmet in 1935 and 1936.http://www.gridiron- uniforms.com/GUD/images/1935_Pittsburgh.pnghttp://www.gridiron- uniforms.com/GUD/images/1936_Pittsburgh.png Finally, the Giants would wear the winged helmet again from 1937 to 1947, making them the last NFL team to wear the winged helmet on a regular basis as well as the last NFL team to wear them in any occasion until the Eagles wore the Yellow Jackets throwbacks in 2007.

There was no musical tradition in Winbergh's family. He himself was a building engineer when he watched his first opera performance in 1967; the experience so moved him that he decided on an operatic career. Accordingly, he applied for the opera class at Sweden's Royal Academy of Music. He trained at the school between 1969-71. He began singing at the Royal Opera in Stockholm, and gradually began to receive international attention in the 1980s when he guest performed on stages abroad. Copenhagen, Aix-en-Provence, San Francisco and in 1980, Glyndebourne, where he sang Belmonte. He later worked several times at the opera house in Z√ºrich and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, singing Mozart's Don Giovanni, Wagner's Lohengrin, Verdi's Rigoletto and Puccini's Turandot. ==Career== For the first two-thirds of his 30-year career, G√∂sta Winbergh specialized in Mozart's operas. He played Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni at the Met, at the Salzburg Festival, in Houston and Chicago, Berlin and Barcelona. He sang Ferrando in Cosi fan tutte at the Drottninghom Court Theatre and Tamino in The Magic Flute for his debut at La Scala, Milan. Other Mozart roles in his repertory were Idomeneo, Mitridate and Titus. He also sang lyric roles such as Almaviva in Il barbiere di Siviglia, the Duke in Rigoletto, Alfredo in La traviata, Nemorino in L'elisir d'amore and Lenski in Eugene Onegin. Then in 1991 at Zurich he sang his first Lohengrin, and moved on to other heavier roles such as the Emperor in Die Frau ohne Schatten, Don Jose in Carmen and Florestan in Fidelio. In 1982, Winbergh made his Chicago debut as Ferrando, and his Covent Garden debut in the title role of La Clemenza di Tito. The following year he sang the title role of Mitridate, re di Ponto at the Schwetzingen Festival, and made his Metropolitan debut as Don Ottavio. In 1984, he sang Tamino in Salzburg and Ferrando at Drottningholm, as well as Admetus in Gluck's Alceste in Geneva. In 1985, he performed as a soloist in Mozart's Coronation Mass at the Vatican for the Pope. He made his debut at La Scala in 1985 as well, singing Tamino, and returned there in 1990 for the title role of Idomeneo, repeating the role at Madrid the following year. ==Personal life== Winbergh married Elena, and had a son and a daughter with her. His son, Gunnar, is best known for playing The Black Falcon in the 2006 film Flyboys. ==Death== Winbergh suffered a heart attack and died in Vienna in 2002,G√∂sta Winbergh's obituary ‚Äì The Guardian where he was performing at the time. To honor his memory and opera work, The G√∂sta Winbergh Award (GWA) was instituted in Sweden after his death; the award is each year handed out to young aspiring tenors through an arranged singing contest that takes place at the opera stage Confidencen, at the Ulriksdal Royal Estate (a few miles outside Stockholm). The first prize consists of 14.000 Euro ($15,355 in American dollars) and the second prize of 6.000 Euro ($6,580 in American dollars). ==ReferencesSinging Mozart (YouTube) * The Prize Song from MEISTERSINGER (YouTube) * Two Interviews with G√∂sta Winbergh by Bruce Duffie, November 3, 1982 & February 25, 1999 Category:Swedish male singers Category:Swedish operatic tenors Category:Litteris et Artibus recipients Category:Singers from Stockholm Category:1943 births Category:2002 deaths Category:√ñsterreichischer Kammers√§nger Category:20th-century opera singers Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"G√∂sta Winbergh"},{"id":"6230729","text":"Monistrol de Montserrat () is a municipality in the comarca of the Bages in Catalonia, Spain.

Although Hong Kongers refer to the language as \\"Cantonese\\" (), publications in mainland China describe the variant as Hong Kong dialect (), due to the differences between the pronunciation used in Hong Kong Cantonese and that of the Cantonese spoken in neighbouring Guangdong Province where Cantonese (based on the Guangzhou dialect) is a lingua franca. Over the years, Hong Kong Cantonese has also absorbed foreign terminology and developed a large set of Hong Kong-specific terms. Code-switching with English is also common. These are the result of British rule between 1841 and 1997, as well as the closure of the Hong Kong‚Äìmainland China border immediately after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. ==History== Before the arrival of British settlers in 1842, the inhabitants of Hong Kong mainly spoke the Dongguan-Bao'an (Tungkun‚ÄìPo'on) and Tanka dialects of Yue, as well as Hakka and Teochew. These languages and dialects are all remarkably different from Guangzhou Cantonese. After the British acquired Hong Kong Island, Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories from the Qing in 1841 (officially 1842) and 1898, large numbers of merchants and workers came to Hong Kong from the city of Canton, the main centre of Cantonese. Cantonese became the dominant spoken language in Hong Kong. The extensive migration from mainland Cantonese-speaking areas to Hong Kong continued up until 1949, when the Communists took over mainland China. During this period, the Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong was very similar to that in Canton. In 1949, the year that the People's Republic of China was established, Hong Kong saw a large influx of refugees from mainland China, prompting the Hong Kong Government to close its border. Illegal immigration from mainland China into Hong Kong nevertheless continued. Movement, communication and relations between Hong Kong and mainland China became very limited, and consequently the evolution of Cantonese in Hong Kong diverged from that of Guangzhou. In mainland China, the use of Mandarin as the official language and in education was enforced. In Hong Kong, Cantonese is the medium of instruction in schools, along with written English and written Chinese. Because of the long exposure to English during the colonial period, a large number of English words were loaned into Hong Kong Cantonese, e.g. \\"Â∑¥Â£´\\" (/p√°Àês«êÀê/), literally, \\"bus\\". Therefore, the vocabularies of Cantonese in mainland China and Hong Kong substantially differed. Moreover, the pronunciation of Cantonese changed while the change either did not occur in mainland China or took place much slower. For example, merging of initial into and the deletion of were observed. ==Pronunciation== In modern-day Hong Kong, many native speakers are unable to distinguish between certain phoneme pairs, causing them to merge one sound into another. Although this is often considered substandard and is frequently denounced as \\"lazy sound\\" (), the phenomenon is becoming more widespread and is influencing other Cantonese- speaking regions. Contrary to popular opinion, some of these changes are not recent. The loss of the velar nasal () was documented by Williams (1856), and the substitution of the liquid nasal () for the nasal initial () was documented by Cowles (1914). List of observed shifts: *Merging of initial into initial. *Merging of initial into null initial. *Merging of and initials into and when followed by . Note that is the only glide () in Cantonese. *Merging of and codas into and codas respectively, eliminating contrast between these pairs of finals (except after and ): -, -, -, -, - and -. *Merging of the two syllabic nasals, into , eliminating the contrast of sounds between (surname Ng) and (not). *Merging of the rising tones (Èô∞‰∏ä 2nd and ÈôΩ‰∏ä 5th). Today in Hong Kong, people still make an effort to avoid these sound merges in serious broadcasts and in education. Older people often do not exhibit these shifts in their speech, but some do. With the sound changes, the name of Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank (), , literally Hong Kong Constant Growth Bank, becomes , sounding like Hon' Kon' itchy body 'un cold (). The name of Cantonese itself (, \\"Guangdong speech\\") would be without the merger, whereas (sounding like \\"\\": \\"say eastern speech\\") and (sounding like \\"\\" : \\"chase away eastern speech\\") are overwhelmingly popular.Together Learn Cantonese, see middle section. The shift affects the way some Hong Kong people speak other languages as well. This is especially evident in the pronunciation of certain English names: \\"Nicole\\" pronounce , \\"Nancy\\" pronounce etc. A very common example of the mixing of and is that of the word , meaning \\"you\\". Even though the standard pronunciation should be , the word is often pronounced , which is the surname , or the word , meaning theory. The merger of () and () also affects the choice of characters when the Cantonese media transliterates foreign names. Prescriptivists who try to correct these \\"lazy sounds\\" often end up introducing hypercorrections. For instance, while attempting to ensure that people pronounce the initial , they may introduce it into words which have historically had a null-initial. One common example is that of the word , meaning \\"love\\". Even though the standard pronunciation would be , but the word is often pronounced . ==Unique phrases and expressions== Hong Kong Cantonese has developed a number of phrases and expressions that are unique to the context of Hong Kong. Examples are: {  style=text- align:center +Table of Colloquial Cantonese Expressions - ! Colloquial Cantonese Expressions(pronunciation) !! Literally !! Colloquially !!

In turn, Hong Kong influences have spread widely into other cultures. As a result, a large number of loanwords are created in Hong Kong and then exported to mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Japan. Some of the loanwords have become even more popular than their Chinese counterparts, in Hong Kong as well as in their destination cultures. ===Imported loanwords=== Selected loanwords are shown below.

Sometimes, the parts of speech of the incorporated words are changed. In some examples, some new meanings of English words are even created. For example, \\"Ëá≥yeah\\", literally \\"the most yeah\\", means \\"the trendiest\\". Originally, \\"yeah\\" means \\"yes/okay\\" in English, but it means \\"trendy\\" when being incorporated into Hong Kong Cantonese (Cf. \\"yeah baby\\" and French \\"y√©-y√©\\"). Semantic change is common in loanwords; when foreign words are borrowed into Cantonese, polysyllabic words and monosyllabic words tend to become disyllabic, and the second syllable is in the Upper Rising tone (the second tone). For example, \\"kon1 si2\\" (coins), \\"sek6 kiu1\\" (security) and \\"ka1 si2\\" (cast). A few polysyllabic words become monosyllabic though, like \\"mon1\\" (monitor), literally means computer monitor. And some new Cantonese lexical items are created according to the morphology of Cantonese. For example, \\"laai1 Ë®ò\\" from the word \\"library\\". Most of the disyllabic words and some of the monosyllabic words are incorporated as their original pronunciation, with some minor changes according to the Cantonese phonotactics. Incorporating words from foreign languages into Cantonese is acceptable to most Cantonese speakers. Hong Kong Cantonese speakers frequently code-mix although they can distinguish foreign words from Cantonese ones. For instance, \\"ÂôâÈÉΩÂîî make sense\\", literally means \\"that doesn't make sense\\". After a Cantonese speaker decides to code-mix a foreign word in a Cantonese sentence, syntactical rules of Cantonese will be followed. For instance, \\"sure\\" (ËÇØÂÆö) can be used like \\"‰Ω† su1 Âîî su1 aa3?\\" (are you sure?) as if it were its Cantonese counterpart \\"‰Ω†ËÇØÂîîËÇØÂÆö?\\", using the A-not-A question construction. In some circumstances, code-mixing is preferable because it can simplify sentences. An excellent example (though dated) of the convenience and efficiency of such mixing is \\"Êâì collect call\\" replacing \\"Êâì‰∏ÄÂÄãÁî±Â∞çÊñπ‰ªòÊ¨æÂòÖÈï∑ÈÄîÈõªË©±\\", i.e. 13 syllables reduced to four. ==Short-text adaptations Abbreviation === Abbreviations are commonly used in Hong Kong and have flourished with the use of short messaging over the Internet. Some examples: {  style=text-align:center +Table of Abbreviation - ! Original term !! Abbreviated term !! Explanation -  Cantonese: ÂîîÁü•(ng4 zi1) English: do not know  5G (ng5 G) Example: Áî≤: ‰Ω†Áü•ÂîîÁü•ÈÇäÂÄã‰øÇÊØîÂæ∑? ‰πô: Êàë5G English: A: Do you know who is Peter? B: I don‚Äôt know (5G).  The ‚Äú5‚Äù here is not pronounced as ‚Äúfive‚Äù but in Cantonese ‚Äúng5‚Äù, which is the Chinese word ‚Äú‰∫î\\" (ng5). Since ‚Äú‰∫î\\"(ng5) and ‚ÄúÂîî\\" (ng4), ‚ÄúÁü•\\" (zi1) and ‚ÄúG‚Äù are having similar pronunciations, we used 5G to replace the Cantonese term‚ÄùÂîîÁü•, which carries the meaning of don‚Äôt know. (Sometimes \\"idk\\" is more often to express \\"I do not know\\".) -  Cantonese:ÈçæÊÑè(zung1 ji3) English: Like  ‰∏≠2 (zung3 ji6) Example: ÊàëÂ•Ω‰∏≠2‰Ω¢ÂëÄ! English: I like (‰∏≠2 zung3 ji6) him so much!  Due to similar pronunciation, the ‚Äú2‚Äù here is pronounced as the Chinese ‚Äú‰∫å\\" (ji6) rather than ‚Äútwo‚Äù. Combining this number with the Chinese character \\"‰∏≠\\" (zung3), it carries similar pronunciation as ‚ÄúÈçæÊÑè‚Äù(zung1 ji3) but the structure of this martian language term is much simpler. -  Cantonese:Â∏´Â•∂(si1 naai1) English: Housewife  C9 Example: ‰Ω†ËëóÂà∞ÊàêÂÄãC9ÂíÅ English: You dress like a housewife(C9).  The word C9 should be pronounced in English ‚ÄúC nine‚Äù, which is very similar to Cantonese si1 naai1. It is an easier form of typing the word ‚ÄúÂ∏´Â•∂‚Äù without changing the meaning in Cantonese. The two characters are already on the keyboard so it is much simpler to type. -  7-Eleven (7-11)  Se-fun(Èü≥:‰∫õÁ≤â)/ Chat1 Jai2(‰∏É‰ªîÔºâ Example: Âéª‰∫õÁ≤â/‰∏É‰ªîË≤∑ÈáéÈ£≤ÂÖà English : Let‚Äôs go 7-Eleven (Se-fun ‰∫õÁ≤â) to buy some drinks.  ‚ÄúChat1‚Äù is the Chinese word of seven and ‚ÄúJai2‚Äù is son or boy -  Take Away(Â§ñË≥£)  Haang4 Gai1(Ë°åË°ó) (literal: walk on the street) Example: È≠öËõãÁ≤âË°åË°ó! English: Fish Ball Noodles for take-away! (Haang4 Gai1 Ë°åË°ó)  This abbreviation is often used in Hong Kong-style caf√©s for take-away. -  Uh-huh  55 Example: Áî≤: ‰Ω†‰ªäÊó•Ë¶ÅÁï™Â≠∏? ‰πô:55 English: A: Do you need to attend school today? B:Yea.(55)  Homophonic for ‚Äúng ng‚Äù (ÂóØÂóØ) which indicates agreement or understanding. -  Post (ÁôºË°®ÔºèÂºµË≤º)  po Example: ÊàëpoÂíóÁõ∏ English: I posted (po) a photo.  example of common omission of final consonant (not naturally occurring in Cantonese) } ==See also== *Bilingualism in Hong Kong *Cantonese profanity *Code-switching in Hong Kong *Proper Cantonese pronunciation *Comparison of national standards of Chinese *Hong Kong English *Varieties of Chinese ==References *Learn Cantonese (with Cantonese- English / English-Cantonese Dictionary) *Learn Chinese with Chinese Lyrics Now with Pinyin and sound files *Jyutping romanisation of Cantonese reading of Chinese characters using in Hong Kong Category:Languages of Hong Kong Category:Cantonese language Category:City colloquials ","title":"Hong Kong Cantonese"},{"id":"6230789","text":"Gina Berriault (January 1, 1926 ‚Äì July 15, 1999), was an American novelist and short story writer. ==Biography== Berriault was born in Long Beach, California, to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents. Her father was a freelance writer and Berriault took her inspiration from him, using his stand-up typewriter to write her first stories while still in grammar school. Berriault had a prolific writing career, which included stories, novels and screenplays. Her writing tended to focus on life in and around San Francisco. She published four novels and three collections of short stories, including Women in Their Beds: New & Selected Stories (1996), which won the PEN/Faulkner Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Bay Area Book Reviewers Award. In 1997 Berriault was chosen as winner of the Rea Award for the Short Story, for outstanding achievement in that genre. Berriault taught writing at the Iowa Writers Workshop and San Francisco State University. She also received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, a Guggenheim Fellowship, an Ingram- Merrill Fellowship, a Commonwealth Gold Medal for Literature, the Pushcart Prize and several O'Henry prizes. She adapted her short story \\"The Stone Boy\\" for a film of the same title, released in 1984. The same story had previously been adapted by another writer for a 1960 television presentation. ==Death and legacy== Berriault died in 1999, at age 73, at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, California. The Gina Berriault Award, created by Peter Orner and Fourteen Hills Review at San Francisco State University in 2009, honors Berriault's legacy. ==Bibliography== ;Novels * The Descent (1960) * A Conference of Victims (1962) * The Son (1966) * The Lights of Earth (1984) ;Story collections * Short Story (1958; a Scribner's showcase volume for four then-new writers: Berriault, Richard Yates, Seymour Epstein and Bonnie Barnett). * The Mistress and Other Stories (1965) * The Infinite Passion of Expectation: Twenty-five Stories (1982) * Women in Their Beds: New & Selected Stories (1996) ==References * *The Woman in the Rose- Colored Dress, a short story, Narrative Magazine (Fall 2005).

As King finds himself reluctantly drawn into the Irishman's request it becomes clear that his subject is mentally unbalanced but, against all expectations, King finds himself able to heal the Irishman and, in the process, himself.

Today it is a fast-paced event that gives a team of two riders on horseback from 60 to 90 seconds (depending on the class or the sanctioning of the event) to separate three specifically identified cattle from a herd of 30, and put them into a 16' x 24' pen through a 10' opening, at the opposite end of the arena.Team Penning Retrieved on 4 May 2009 The sport features 30 head of cattle, typically yearling beef cattle (mature cows or bulls are not allowed), with numbers affixed to their back, three each wearing a number from 0 through 9 or with colored collars attached. Timing starts once the line judge has dropped his flag as the lead rider's horse crosses the foul line. At that time, the announcer identifies the cattle to be separated by calling out a randomly drawn number or collar color. The riders must cut out the three head that have been nominated, take them to the opposite end of the arena, pen them and call for time. Teamwork is the key with all three riders working in harmony to cut out the correct cattle and drive them to the pen while keeping the rest of the herd (sometimes called trash or dirty cattle) back. The history of the sport is thought to date back to 1942 when brothers Ray and Joe Yanez, along with Canadian cowboy Bill Schwindt were sorting steers from a herd of cattle on a Ventura County, California ranch. During a lunch break the trio reportedly came upon the idea of organizing what were routine cowboy chores into a competitive sport, one in which cowboys could showcase their horsemanship.The First Team Penning, article from Western Horseman, September 1997, accessed online March 5, 2007. The first organized competition is thought to have taken place at the Ventura County Fair in August 1949. Today, the sport is a fast-growing western horse sport in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. In North America, the primary team penning sanctioning organization is the United States Team Penning Association (USTPA), headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. There are an estimated 93,000 active team penners in North America. ==Related== * Ranch Sorting * Campdrafting * Cutting (sport) * Working cow horse ==References *United States Team Penning Association (USTPA) website *Canadian Team Cattle Penning Association Canadian Team Cattle Penning Association Category:Equestrian team sports Category:Western-style riding Category:Working stock horse sports ","title":"Team penning"},{"id":"6230888","text":"Buckman Hall is a historic building located in Murphree Area on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, Florida, United States. It was designed by architect William A. Edwards in the Collegiate Gothic style and opened in 1906 as one of the two original buildings on the University of Florida's Gainesville campus along with nearby Thomas Hall. It once was a multi-purpose facility but has been used exclusively as a student dormitory since the 1940s. Buckman Hall was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on January 11, 1974. ==HistoryBackground / Multipurpose building=== In June 1905, the Florida legislature passed the Buckman Act, which reorganized the state's university system and established a new University of Florida in Gainesville. Construction at the site began in late 1905 with a planned opening for the 1906-1907 academic year. The first two buildings completed were Buckman Hall, which was named for Buckman Act author Henry Holland Buckman, and Thomas Hall, which was named for Gainesville mayor William Reuben Thomas. When the first students arrived in September 1906, Buckman and Thomas Halls were home to all functions of the school, including classrooms, dormitories, and administrative offices. Buckman Hall housed the university's first cafeteria, gymnasium, and infirmary. Andrew Sledd, UF's first president, also lived there for a time. ===Dormitory=== The university's campus grew along with its enrollment in the early 20th century, and newer buildings gradually took over many of the former functions of Buckman Hall. It has been used exclusively as a dormitory since the University of Florida became co- educational following World War II. Buckman Hall functioned as a student cooperative dormitory from 1974 until 2003. In exchange for lower rental rates, students performed most day-to-day maintenance such as general housekeeping and minor repairs. Residents also elected student officers who had the authority to make decisions concerning many aspects of residence hall life in addition to the duties of resident assistants living in conventional on-campus housing. The cooperative program lost popularity with students over the years, and Buckman Hall became a regular dorm for the spring 2003 semester. Air conditioning Buckman Hall and Thomas Hall were the first two buildings to open on the UF campus, and they remain the last without central air conditioning. Due to Buckman Hall's old wiring, even portable air conditioning units were not allowed for many years, and students often cooled their rooms by running a box fan in an open window. As part of a utilities update during the 2006-2007 academic year, Buckman Hall's electrical infrastructure was completely replaced to better handle loads from computers and other modern electronics. These improvements also made it possible for residents to utilize portable air conditioning units beginning with the fall 2007 semester. ==See also== *Buildings at the University of Florida *History of the University of Florida *University of Florida *Campus Historic District *University of Florida student housing ==References * Buckman Hall, UF Division of Housing and Residence Education * Alachua County listings at National Register of Historic Places * Alachua County listings at Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs * George A.

The center's Romanesque Revival building, located at Pierrepont and Clinton Streets in Brooklyn Heights, was designed by George B. Post and built in 1878-81, is a National Historic Landmark and part of New York City's Brooklyn Heights Historic District. The CBH houses materials relating to the history of Brooklyn and its people, and hosts exhibitions which draw over 9,000 members a year. In addition to general programming, the CBH serves over 70,000 public school students and teachers annually by providing exhibit tours, educational programs and curricula, and making its professional staff available for instruction and consultation. ==History== Entrance in 2008 The Center for Brooklyn History was founded in 1863 by Henry Pierrepont (1808‚Äì1888) as the Long Island Historical Society, with a charter from the New England Historical Society in Boston. pp. 145‚Äì146. In 1985, the society changed its name to the Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS). In 2005, the BHS was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.Carnegie Corporation - News In December 2007, BHS opened the first gallery in the United States devoted to oral history. The first exhibition installed in the gallery was an installation of oral histories, photographs, documents, and artifacts called \\"In Our Own Words: Portraits of Brooklyn's Vietnam Veterans\\". In 2010 while cataloging the map collection, BHS staff discovered a previously uncatalogued, and rare copy of a c. 1770 map by Bernard Ratzer that has been restored and is now accessible to the public. As part of the construction of Empire Stores at Brooklyn Bridge Park, BHS was selected to operate a museum to celebrate Brooklyn's industrial history. The BHS Dumbo exhibition space, as it was called, opened in May 2017. In 2020, the BHS made an agreement to merge with the Brooklyn Public Library. As of October 2020, the organization is now part of Brooklyn Public Library and is known as the Center for Brooklyn History. ==Building== The center's headquarters building, on the corner of Pierrepoint and Clinton Streets, was built in 1878‚Äì81 and was designed by George B. Post in the Renaissance revival style. Post was selected as a result of a competition between 14 architects. The building's design utilizes terra cotta ornamentation made by the Perth Amboy Terra Cotta Company, and has architectural sculptures by Olin Levi Warner, including busts of Michelangelo, Beethoven, Gutenberg, Shakespeare, Columbus, Benjamin Franklin, a Viking and a Native American. The building has been described as \\"one of the City's great architectural treasures\\", and the interior as \\"one of New York's great 19th- century interiors.\\" It is part of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission's Brooklyn Heights Historic District, designated in 1966, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1991. In October 1999, BHS began a full-scale restoration of the building, supervised by architect Jan Hird Pokorny, and reopened in 2003.Overview of History of the Brooklyn Historical Society ==Programs== In 2014, BHS created a series of signs marking points of historic significance throughout Brooklyn Bridge Park.https://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/blog/news- media/new-signs-in-brooklyn-bridge-park-reveal-park-s-history Principal activities of the CBH include education programs, which are organized around a central educational concept of encouraging students to understand that history is connected to their lives. CBH programs link the study of American history to events and sites in the students‚Äô own communities by introducing the investigation of primary source documents and neighborhood histories. CBH's education programs largely focus on the ability of students to ‚Äúread‚Äù primary source documents, including works of art, maps, photographs, and other artifacts. Each year exhibitions are presented by the CBH, ranging from retrospectives and historical surveys to more focused presentations that explore specific themes and topics. Installations from the collection have included a gallery of family portraits and another of landscape paintings. These installations rotate over time, providing visitors with greater access to CBH's fine arts collections. ==Collection== A corner of the library The Othmer Library has a collection that includes historic maps and atlases of Brooklyn and New York City, individual family histories in the genealogy collection, a microfilm collection of Brooklyn and Long Island newspapers from the 19th and early 20th century, a collection of microfiche pamphlets on slavery and abolition, the papers of abolitionist clergyman Henry Ward Beecher, the Pierrepont Papers, the Brooklyn Firefighting Collection, and the Brooklyn Council of Churches. The Center for Brooklyn History possesses a collection of historical maps spanning the years ca. 1562‚Äì2011. The geographic coverage of the collection includes the five boroughs of New York City, Long Island, New York State, New Jersey, New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Eastern United States.

Herg√© modeled the language on Marols, a dialect of Dutch spoken in and around Brussels. The entire corpus of the language has been analyzed by Mark Rosenfelder. ==Characteristics== As presented in the Tintin books, Syldavian has a superficial resemblance to certain Central European languages, particularly Polish and Hungarian, due to its orthography. Like Serbian, it uses both the Cyrillic and Latin scripts, although apparently in somewhat different contexts; it is most commonly written in the Cyrillic alphabet, albeit with the Latin alphabet by the royal court. It shares numerous orthographic features found in various Eastern European languages, most notably the \\"sz\\" and \\"cz\\" of Polish. However, the language is clearly a Germanic language. Its vocabulary and grammar resembles that of Dutch and German and has little in common with any Slavic languages. But while Marols, Herg√©'s native dialect, was used as a basis for the language, Syldavian has a much more complicated grammar, with other Central European influences added. (Indeed, it is easy to imagine that if Herg√© was, say, Italian, Syldavian would have ended up like Romanian.) The language also appears to have been influenced by Bordurian (another fictional language), Slavic languages and Turkish. The Syldavians often bear names of Slavic origin, such as Wladimir; the dish szlaszeck that Tintin encountered also appears to be a borrowing. ( is the Polish word for shish kebab, borrowed in turn from Turkish.) Many words are based on common French slangs. For examples, is constructed on the French Parisian slang meaning \\"dog\\". This language, which is Germanic but bears a great resemblance to Polish, may be likened to the artificial Romance language Wenedyk, or to the endangered Wymysorys language. == Phonology == Syldavian boasts a rich range of sounds. === Vowels === In addition to the diacritical marks shown in the chart below, there are acute and grave accents that may indicate stress. Roman letters are on the left, Cyrillic letters on the right. {   ! rowspan=2  ! colspan=2  Front ! rowspan=2 width=70  Back - ! unrounded ! rounded - ! Close    - ! Near-close    - ! Close-mid    - ! Open-mid  rowspan=2  ~   - ! Near-open   - ! Open    } In addition to these letters, Syldavian also contains several digraphs and letters for which the pronunciation is uncertain: * - uncertain, possibly // * - uncertain. Likely a diaeresis indicating to pronounce as syllabic rather than , or for the benefit of French-speakers so they don't mispronounce ai as instead of the correct . * - * - * - uncertain: perhaps the vowel or , perhaps a diphthong or .

Alveolar ! Postalveolar ! Palatal ! Velar ! Glottal - ! Nasal        - ! Plosive        - ! Fricative        - ! Affricate        - ! Trill        - ! Approximant        } Note: As in Czech, the letter can be syllabic, as seen in names such as Staszrvitch and Dbrnouk. There are some additional digraphs and trigraphs, including (used in names and pronounced with , the apparent Syldavian version of the common Serbo-Croatian/Balkan surname ending -iƒá), (uncertain, but may be an alternative form of ), and . These demonstrate that the Latin-based orthography has a number of irregularities, or else these are old inconsistent spellings that have been preserved in family names but are no longer used in the standard orthography (as in Hungarian, where for example one may find the family name Sz√©chenyi retaining a traditional spelling rather than the orthographically correct *Sz√©csenyi). Note that Syldavian Cyrillic diverges in some important respects from Cyrillic as used in real-world languages, most notably by porting over Latin digraphs into the Cyrillic alphabet (for example, / É/ is written \\"—Å–∑\\" instead of \\"—à\\"), and to use a few Cyrillic letters (—â, —é) for sounds for which they are never used in the real world. This, together with the use of Latin script in old medieval manuscripts, may suggest that the Syldavians adopted the Latin alphabet first, and the Cyrillic later, which is the reverse of several real-world languages (most notably Romanian) which switched from Cyrillic to Latin. ==Grammar Plurals === * Native words are pluralized with : - \\"dogs\\"; - \\"bottles\\" * Loanwords are pluralized with : - \\"cigarettes\\" === Definite articles === Unlike Marols, but like German (shown in italics in the table), Syldavian definite articles are extensively inflected. {  - ! Masc./Fem. Neut. Plural - Nom.dze der/diedascz dasdzoe die - Acc.dzem den/diedascz dasdzoe die - Dat.dze dem/derdza demdzem den - Gen.doscz des/derdoscz desdoscz der - } === Indefinite articles === * Singular: - \\"a\\" * Plural: - \\"some\\" == Adjectives == Adjectives precede nouns: :forwotzen zona 'prohibited area'; Zekrett Politzs 'Secret Police'. There is no sufficient evidence to tell whether adjectives change form. The rules of Dutch, a control language of Syldavian, are very complex. Note: the derivation Klow > Klowaswa is merely one of many adjectivizations, however, compare Zyldav 'Syldavian' Adjectives can be used to modify verbs like adverbs: :Nadja Wladimir zekrett l√∂wt. 'Nadja secretly loves Vladimir' :Dzapeih wzryzkar eszt on vaghabontz. 'The guy is surely a tramp.' == Pronouns  Personal pronouns === {  - ! Sub. Obj. Poss. - 1 sing. ek ma mejn - 2 sing. d√ªs da dejn - 3 sing. m. eih itd yhzer - 3 sing. n. itd ein zsejn - 3 sing. f. zsoe irz yhzer - 1 plur. vei ohmz ohmz - 2 plur. jei jou √∂hz - 3 plur. zsoe khon khon - } 3rd person singular neuter objective and possessive and 2nd person plural pronouns are reconstructed based on Dutch and German. === Demonstrative pronouns === \\\\- this \\\\- that == Verbs == Verbs are either weak or strong. This decides how they are conjugated. ===Conjugation=== Strong Verb: blavn 'to stay' {  - ! Pres. Ind. Past Ind. Subj. Imp. Pres. Part. Past Part. - 1 sing. blav blev blavetz - blavendz bleven - 2 sing. *blavszt *blevszt *blavetzt blaveh blavendz bleven - 3 sing. blavet blev blavetz - blavendz bleven - 1 plur. blaven bleven blavendz - blavendz bleven - 2 plur. *blavet *blevet *blavetz blavet blavendz bleven - 3 plur. blaven bleven blavendz  blavendz bleven - } Weak Verb: l√∂wn 'to love' {  - !

Past Part. - 1 sing. l√∂w l√∂wda l√∂wetz - l√∂wendz l√∂wen - 2 sing. *l√∂wszt *l√∂wdaszt *l√∂wetzt l√∂weh l√∂wendz l√∂wen - 3 sing. l√∂wt l√∂wda l√∂wetz - l√∂wendz l√∂wen - 1 plur. l√∂wen l√∂wenda l√∂wendz - l√∂wendz l√∂wen - 2 plur. *l√∂wet *l√∂wdet *l√∂wetz l√∂wet l√∂wendz l√∂wen - 3 plur. l√∂wen l√∂wenda l√∂wendz  l√∂wendz l√∂wen - } *The 2nd person conjugations are unknown, with reconstructions shown with asterisks. Corresponding German verbs and the 2 pl. imperative were used as a guideline in the reconstructions, with -szt in 2 sing. based upon German -st, although -szcz and -eh (the latter written -–µ—â in Cyrillic, which would be -esht in Bulgarian Cyrillic) are other possibilities. ===Negatives=== To negate a sentence, the particle nietz is placed after the subject, in auxiliary position. :M√ºsstler nietz dzem k√∂nikstz l√∂wt. 'M√ºsstler does not love the king.' In copulative sentences, nietz is placed after the verb (or czesztot) : :M√ºsstler eszt nietz g√ºdd. 'M√ºsstler is not good.' :Czesztot wzryzkar nietz on waghabontz! 'That's surely not a vagabond!' == Adverbs == Most adverbs tend to be identical to adjectives in form. Adverbs can be used to modify verbs: :Nadja Wladimir zekrett l√∂wt. 'Nadja secretly loves Vladimir' :Dzapeih wzryzkar eszt on vaghabontz. 'The guy is surely a tramp.' ==Interjections== szplug - a curse word, perhaps equivalent to \\"damn\\". (Not found in original French edition, only English translation.) szplitz on szplug- a more extreme form of szplug hama√Øh!- praising or surprise, could be something like \\"hail!\\" or \\"wow!\\" h√§lt!- a command, probably meaning \\"stop!\\" or \\"halt!\\" szcht!- another command, sounds almost like \\"shh!\\" and perhaps means \\"silence!\\" zs√°lu- a greeting, probably \\"salute\\" or \\"hello\\". == Syntax Verbs=== The verb normally follows the object: :Ihn dzekhoujchz blaveh! 'In the car stay!' :Ek mejn m√§djek l√∂w. 'I love my girlfriend.' :On spr√§dj werlagh. 'I want some red wine.' Where there's an auxiliary and a main verb, the main verb remains at the end, and the auxiliary verb moves just after the subject: :Zsoe ghounh dzoeteu√Øh ebb touhn. 'They're going to open the doors.' :Ek werlagh ihn Klow blavn. 'I want to stay in Klow.' ===Pronouns=== In earlier Syldavian the pronoun may follow the verb, and this form may still be used for emphasis: :Eih bennec, eih blavec 'Here I am, here I stay.' [medieval spelling] :Wzryzkar kzomme ek! 'I'm coming, for sure!' You can say either Eihn ben ek, Eihn bennek or Ek ben eihn, but never *Eihn ek ben (unlike English, where you can say 'Here I am'). In general \\"X is Y\\" can be inverted to \\"Y is X\\". When X is a pronoun, the inversion adds some emphasis: :G√ºdd eszt itd, 'Good it is.' In the kzommet sentences in the corpus, prepositional phrases follow the verb. The comma, however, is a signal that the prepositional phrase has been moved for emphasis, or because it is an afterthought: :Kzommet micz omhz, noh dascz gendarmaska√Øa! Come with us to the police station! Forms of 'be' directly follow the subject : :K√∂nikstz eszt g√ºdd. 'The king is good.' :Sbrodj on forwotzen eszt zona . 'Sbrodj is a forbidden zone.' :Dan dzetronn eszt erv√∂h. 'Then the throne is for him.' The merged form czesztot 'it is, that is' begins a sentence: Czesztot Tintin. \\"That's Tintin.\\" ==Historical changes== Samples of Syldavian from only two periods - the 14th century and the 20th century - are available to us. But even with such a small sample, some changes can be seen in the language over a 600-year period: * pho became v√ºh (\\"for\\") * cegan became cza√Øgan (\\"say\\") * eih became eihn (\\"here\\") * coe became kzou (\\"cow\\") * √∂n became o (\\"at, about\\") * wazs became vazs (\\"what\\") * w and v transposed * c (//) became k == Sample text== From a 14th-century manuscript, Noble Deeds of Ottokar IV: Medieval Spelling : Modern Spelling : Cyrillic Spelling : English translation: :\\"Father Ottokar, thou falsely art king; the throne is for me.\\" This one said thus to the other, \\"Come seize the sceptre.\\" The king thus hit him, Staszrvitch, on his head. The villain fell onto the floor.\\" More Examples : - \\"That's a dog.\\" : - \\"Hail!\\" (The Bordurian language borrows this as ) : - \\"Come with us to the Police Station.\\" ( in the English translation.) is a borrowing from French . The suffix is also apparently borrowed from the Russian feminine adjective ending . : - \\"A bottle of Klow water for this guy... He's thirsty!\\" (cf. Dutch & cf. Swedish , \\"thirst\\". (Lit. 'He thirsts!') : - \\"That's surely not a tramp! Isn't it better for him to come to the police station?\\" (Lit. probably \\"Is it better [that] he comes to the police station?\\") : - \\"Quick! Into the boat!\\" (cognate literally to German ) ==See also== *Bordurian ==References== * \\"On the Syldavian language\\" by Mark Rosenfelder * Har Brok, Is Syldavisch Slavisch?

In particular, the number of edges between two vertex subsets S and T is always close to the expected number of edges between them in a random d-regular graph, namely \\\\frac dnST. == d-Regular Expander Graphs == Define an (n, d, \\\\lambda)-graph to be a d-regular graph G on n vertices such that all of the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix A_G except one have magnitude at most \\\\lambda. The d-regularity of the graph guarantees that its largest-magnitude eigenvalue is d. In fact, the all-1's vector \\\\mathbf1 is an eigenvector of A_G with eigenvalue d, and the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix will never exceed the maximum degree of G in magnitude. If we fix d and \\\\lambda then (n, d, \\\\lambda)-graphs form a family of expander graphs with a constant spectral gap. ==Statement== Let G = (V, E) be an (n, d, \\\\lambda)-graph. For any two subsets S, T \\\\subseteq V, let e(S, T) = \\\\\\\\{(x,y) \\\\in S \\\\times T : xy \\\\in E(G)\\\\\\\\} be the number of edges between S and T (counting edges contained in the intersection of S and T twice). Then :\\\\lefte(S, T) - \\\\frac{d S T}{n}\\\\right \\\\leq \\\\lambda \\\\sqrt{S T }\\\\,. === Tighter Bound === We can in fact show that :\\\\lefte(S, T) - \\\\frac{d S T}{n}\\\\right \\\\leq \\\\lambda \\\\sqrt{S T (1 - S/n)(1 - T/n)}\\\\, using similar techniques. === Biregular Graphs === For biregular graphs, we have the following variation.See Theorem 5.1 in \\"Interlacing Eigenvalues and Graphs\\" by Haemers Let G = (L, R, E) be a bipartite graph such that every vertex in L is adjacent to d_L vertices of R and every vertex in R is adjacent to d_R vertices of L. Let S \\\\subseteq L, T \\\\subseteq R with S = \\\\alphaL and T = \\\\beta R. Let e(G) = E(G). Then :\\\\left\\\\frac{e(S, T)}{e(G)} - \\\\alpha \\\\beta\\\\right \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\sqrt{d_Ld_R}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha \\\\beta (1 - \\\\alpha) (1 - \\\\beta)} \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\sqrt{d_Ld_R}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}\\\\,. Note that \\\\sqrt{d_L d_R} is the largest absolute value of the eigenvalues of G. ==Proofs Proof of First Statement === Let A_G be the adjacency matrix of G and let \\\\lambda_1\\\\geq\\\\cdots\\\\geq\\\\lambda_n be the eigenvalues of A_G (these eigenvalues are real because A_G is symmetric). We know that \\\\lambda_1=d with corresponding eigenvector v_1=\\\\frac 1{\\\\sqrt n}\\\\mathbf{1}, the normalization of the all-1's vector. Because A_G is symmetric, we can pick eigenvectors v_2,\\\\ldots,v_n of A_G corresponding to eigenvalues \\\\lambda_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda_n so that \\\\\\\\{v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n\\\\\\\\} forms an orthonormal basis of \\\\mathbf R^n. Let J be the n\\\\times n matrix of all 1's. Note that v_1 is an eigenvector of J with eigenvalue n and each other v_i, being perpendicular to v_1=\\\\mathbf{1}, is an eigenvector of J with eigenvalue 0. For a vertex subset U \\\\subseteq V, let 1_U be the column vector with v^\\\\text{th} coordinate equal to 1 if v\\\\in U and 0 otherwise. Then, :\\\\lefte(S,T)-\\\\frac dnST\\\\right=\\\\left1_S^\\\\operatorname{T}\\\\left(A_G-\\\\frac dnJ\\\\right)1_T\\\\right. Let M=A_G-\\\\frac dnJ. Because A_G and J share eigenvectors, the eigenvalues of M are 0,\\\\lambda_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda_n. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have that 1_S^\\\\operatorname{T}M1_T=1_S\\\\cdot M1_T\\\\leq\\\\1_S\\\\\\\\M1_T\\\\. Furthermore, because M is self-adjoint, we can write :\\\\M1_T\\\\^2=\\\\langle M1_T,M1_T\\\\rangle=\\\\langle 1_T,M^21_T\\\\rangle=\\\\left\\\\langle 1_T,\\\\sum_{i=1}^nM^2\\\\langle 1_T,v_i\\\\rangle v_i\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{i=2}^n\\\\lambda_i^2\\\\langle 1_T,v_i\\\\rangle^2\\\\leq\\\\lambda^2\\\\1_T\\\\^2. This implies that \\\\M1_T\\\\\\\\leq\\\\lambda\\\\1_T\\\\ and \\\\lefte(S,T)-\\\\frac dnST\\\\right\\\\leq\\\\lambda\\\\1_S\\\\\\\\1_T\\\\=\\\\lambda\\\\sqrt{ST}. === Proof Sketch of Tighter Bound === To show the tighter bound above, we instead consider the vectors 1_S-\\\\frac{S}n\\\\mathbf 1 and 1_T-\\\\frac{T}n\\\\mathbf 1, which are both perpendicular to v_1. We can expand :1_S^\\\\operatorname{T}A_G1_T=\\\\left(\\\\frac{S}n\\\\mathbf 1\\\\right)^\\\\operatorname{T}A_G\\\\left(\\\\frac{T}n\\\\mathbf 1\\\\right)+\\\\left(1_S-\\\\frac{S}n\\\\mathbf 1\\\\right)^\\\\operatorname{T}A_G\\\\left(1_T-\\\\frac{T}n\\\\mathbf 1\\\\right) because the other two terms of the expansion are zero. The first term is equal to \\\\frac{ST}{n^2}\\\\mathbf 1^\\\\operatorname{T}A_G\\\\mathbf 1=\\\\frac dnST, so we find that :\\\\lefte(S,T)-\\\\frac dnST\\\\right \\\\leq\\\\left\\\\left(1_S-\\\\frac{S}n\\\\mathbf 1\\\\right)^\\\\operatorname{T}A_G\\\\left(1_T-\\\\frac{T}n\\\\mathbf 1\\\\right)\\\\right We can bound the right hand side by \\\\lambda\\\\left\\\\1_S-\\\\frac{S}{n}\\\\mathbf 1\\\\right\\\\\\\\left\\\\1_T-\\\\frac{T}{n}\\\\mathbf 1\\\\right\\\\ =\\\\lambda\\\\sqrt{ST\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{S}n\\\\right)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{T}n\\\\right)} using the same methods as in the earlier proof. ==Applications== The expander mixing lemma can be used to upper bound the size of an independent set within a graph. In particular, the size of an independent set in an (n, d, \\\\lambda)-graph is at most \\\\lambda n/d. This is proved by letting T=S in the statement above and using the fact that e(S,S)=0. An additional consequence is that, if G is an (n, d, \\\\lambda)-graph, then its chromatic number \\\\chi(G) is at least d/\\\\lambda. This is because, in a valid graph coloring, the set of vertices of a given color is an independent set. By the above fact, each independent set has size at most \\\\lambda n/d, so at least d/\\\\lambda such sets are needed to cover all of the vertices. A second application of the expander mixing lemma is to provide an upper bound on the maximum possible size of an independent set within a polarity graph. Given a finite projective plane \\\\pi with a polarity \\\\perp, the polarity graph is a graph where the vertices are the points a of \\\\pi, and vertices x and y are connected if and only if x\\\\in y^{\\\\perp}. In particular, if \\\\pi has order q, then the expander mixing lemma can show that an independent set in the polarity graph can have size at most q^{3/2} - q + 2q^{1/2} - 1, a bound proved by Hobart and Williford. ==Converse== Bilu and Linial showedExpander mixing lemma converse that a converse holds as well: if a d-regular graph G = (V, E) satisfies that for any two subsets S, T \\\\subseteq V with S \\\\cap T = \\\\empty we have :\\\\lefte(S, T) - \\\\frac{d S T}{n}\\\\right \\\\leq \\\\lambda \\\\sqrt{S T}, then its second- largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue is bounded by O(\\\\lambda (1+\\\\log(d/\\\\lambda))). ==Generalization to hypergraphs== Friedman and Widgerson proved the following generalization of the mixing lemma to hypergraphs. Let H be a k-uniform hypergraph, i.e. a hypergraph in which every \\"edge\\" is a tuple of k vertices. For any choice of subsets V_1, ..., V_k of vertices, :\\\\left e(V_1,...,V_k) - \\\\frac{k!E(H)}{n^k}V_1...V_k \\\\right \\\\le \\\\lambda_2(H)\\\\sqrt{V_1...V_k}. ==NotesReferences== *. * *. *. *.

Burroughs & Chapin owns or has had a hand in developing many notable attractions in Myrtle Beach. ==History== Burroughs & Chapin Company began when Franklin Burroughs started a turpentine and mercantile business in Conway, South Carolina. After service in the Civil War, Burroughs returned to Conway and formed a partnership with Benjamin Grier Collins, a native of nearby Georgetown County. The two men expanded the company's commercial interests into timber, farm credit, consumer goods, riverboats and, eventually, the first railway through the swamps of Horry County to the beaches of what are today Myrtle Beach and the Grand Strand. F.G. Burroughs foresaw that the Grand Strand would be developed similarly to northern resort destinations of Coney Island and Atlantic City. Burroughs died in 1897 before his efforts to link the beach via railroad came to fruition. Collins' and Burroughs' sons completed the railroad and built the Seaside Inn in 1901, the first oceanfront hotel in Myrtle Beach. The Seaside Inn was followed by a bathhouse and a wooden pavilion around which beach houses were constructed. By 1907, \\"New Town\\" by the sea, as Myrtle Beach was then called, had become a popular vacation spot. When a contest was held to name the new beach resort, Burroughs' widow suggested \\"Myrtle Beach\\" for its proliferation of wild wax myrtle bushes. In 1912, Simeon B. Chapin, a New York stock broker and son of a prominent Chicago merchant, joined with the Burroughs brothers to form the Myrtle Beach Farms Company. Chapin's financial resources and business experience along with the Burroughs' vast real estate holdings provided for a period of sustained economic growth. The landmark Myrtle Beach Pavilion was expanded, a downtown shopping district took shape around The Chapin Company General Store and housing needs were met by Myrtle Beach Farms residential real estate developments. In 1990, Myrtle Beach Farms Company joined with Conway-based Burroughs & Collins Company to form Burroughs & Chapin Company. ==Notable properties== *Barefoot Landing *Broadway at the Beach *Coastal Grand Mall *Myrtle Beach Pavilion *Myrtle Square Mall *Meher Spiritual Center ==References External links == * Category:Real estate companies of the United States Category:Companies based in South Carolina Category:Myrtle Beach, South Carolina Category:American companies established in 1895 Category:Real estate companies established in 1895 Category:1895 establishments in South Carolina ","title":"Burroughs &amp; Chapin"},{"id":"6231005","text":"Sherando High School is a public secondary school within Frederick County, Virginia, United States, and is part of Frederick County Public Schools. The school is located east of the town of Stephens City. ==History== Sherando High School was opened in August 1993 as the second high school in Frederick County. It was built to help alleviate crowding at James Wood High School, the sole high school in the county at the time. The first principal was Dr. John W. Frossard, with assistant principals Gary V. Tisinger and Joseph J. Swack. The latter succeeded Frossard as principal. The principal is John Nelson. ===Accreditation=== Sherando High School is a fully accredited high school based on its performance on the Standards of Learning tests in Virginia. ==Students== As of September 30, 2006, using the terms from the reporting instrument, the student body was 84.8% White, 5.2% Black, 5.9% Hispanic, 1.4% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1.0% unspecified, and less than 1.0% Indian/Alaskan. English is the predominantly-spoken first language of the population, followed by Spanish. Certain sophomores and juniors are eligible for admission to Mountain Vista Governor's School. ==Athletics== The school mascot is a warrior. The sports teams currently play in the AA Northwestern District and Region II. The school has had numerous athletes and teams reach the state level. In the 2005 fall season, the highest finishing team was volleyball as the state runners-up. Boys' cross country and football were close behind, as both teams finished third in the state. In the winter, several indoor track athletes, swimmers, and wrestlers made it to the state level, but no teams won a title. In the spring, two outdoor track members became the school's state champions: Ryan Witt in the 1600m run and Latasha Watson in the 400m dash. In the 2006 fall season, the highest finishing sport at the state level was the cross country team. In 2006, the football team finished 10-0 for only the second time in school history. A week after the season ended, Sherando lost to the Harrisonburg Blue Streaks 27‚Äì23 in the first round of regionals. The first perfect season was in 1997‚Äì98, under the leadership of Head Coach Walter Barr, wide receiver Bo Arthur, and a talented trio of running backs. In 2007, the Sherando High School varsity football finished as the state runner-up. They went 10-0 during the regular season en route to the state final in Lynchburg. Sherando ended up losing to Amherst County 56‚Äì10. In 2013, the Sherando varsity baseball team won states.

The service is intended to provide transportation for students, faculty, and staff around the main campus, University of Iowa Research Park, residence halls, and commuter parking lots. Cambus is a no-fare service open to the general public. Cambus provides approximately 4,500,000 rides per year. The service is operated by the Department of Parking and Transportation for the University of Iowa with funding from the Parking & Transportation Department, a UI Student fee, and the Federal Transportation Administration. Cambus was founded by University of Iowa students and has been in operation since 1972. The University of Iowa campus is divided into east and west halves by the Iowa River. Most Liberal Arts and Sciences classes take place on the east side of the river; thus the purpose of the new bus service was to facilitate easier transportation between the west-side dormitories and the east-side classrooms. At first there was no name for this service, so the founding students created a contest open to all U of I students to select one. \\"Cambus\\" was the name eventually chosen after Cambuskenneth, and the winner, Larry Page, was awarded a free pizza. The first Cambus buses were used school buses, repainted by Cambus employees. There were three different bus routes; Red Route, Blue Route, and the Interdorm Shuttle. Cambus also acquired a trailer, which was used as their main office; this was located in the Hancher Auditorium parking lot. Cambus employs approximately 170 employees. There are only six non-student employees who work specifically for Cambus: the Cambus Manager, the Maintenance Supervisor, and four full-time mechanics. All other employees, including drivers, dispatchers, trainers, student mechanics, and departmental supervisors, are students currently enrolled at the University of Iowa. Cambus also has two different buildings on the University of Iowa campus. The main office is located on Evashevski Drive, north Kinnick Stadium, called the West Campus Transportation Center. Cambus moved operations to this newer building, shared with the Parking & Transportation department, on November 16, 2012. The Cambus Maintenance Facility, often called \\"The Barn\\" by employees, is located on South Madison Street south of the Campus Recreation and Wellness Center. In October, 2018, Cambus routes and schedules were integrated with Google Maps. == Routes and hours of operation == Cambus has eighteen routes in service. During Academic service (the Spring and Fall semesters), all routes run on weekdays with limited service on the weekends. During Summer and Interim service a limited service runs without any weekend service. Route maps and schedules are available on the Cambus website and in pamphlets available on the buses. Cambus time is set by the Master Clock at the US Naval Observatory (https://web.archive.org/web/20180522031726/https://www.time.gov/) During academic service the earliest route begins at 4:30 am and the last route ends at 1:02 am (2:12 am on Friday and Saturday nights for SafeRide) Cambus also provides special service for university-affiliated groups, including shuttle service for most Hawkeye football games (to/from downtown, Hancher, and the Hawkeye Commuter Lot), men's Hawkeye basketball games (to/from Hancher), and other events on campus. ===Route list=== *Blue Route *East Campus Shuttle *Hawk Lot/Hospital *AM/PM Hawkeye Express *Hawkeye-Hospital *Hawkeye-Interdorm *Hospital Finkbine/Arena *AM/PM Hospital via Hancher *Mayflower Shuttle* *Interdorm* *Research Park *Pentacrest/Night Pentacrest *Red Route *Hospital- VA Loop Recently discontinued routes include: *Music/Theatre Shuttle *Studio Arts Shuttle *ABW/Studio Arts *Melrose Van *routes marked with an asterisk run only during Spring/Fall semesters == Bongo (Bus On the Go) == To improve safety, encourage eco-friendly practices, and create a more efficient service, Cambus adopted Bongo in Spring 2010. Bongo is a GPS-based, real-time passenger information system that allows riders to find current bus locations as well as predictions for upcoming bus arrivals. Bongo uses GPS technology and computer modeling to track vehicles on their routes and predict arrival times. Each vehicle is equipped with a GPS tracking system that reports latitude and longitude via satellite every 15 seconds. Using the 4-digit stop number located at a particular stop, passengers can either text, call or go to www.ebongo.org to find all current arrival predictions for that stop. Passengers can also download the \\"Bongo\\" app from the iPhone store, or Google Play store for Android. In addition to finding current predictions, passengers can also create alerts to be sent to their mobile phones or to pop-up on their computer. More information about this is available at www.ebongo.org/alerts. Bongo is powered by NextBus, a transit information system based in Emeryville, California. == Bionic Bus == In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Cambus provides paratransit service called the Bionic Bus for University staff, faculty, and students. There are up to 3 paratransit buses in service during normal academic service (fewer run on weekends and during interim service). The service is demand-response curb-to-curb and serves much of Iowa City and Coralville. Student drivers are specially trained for Bionic Bus. Unlike Iowa City Transit and Coralville Transit, the paratransit service is handled in-house and not contracted to Johnson County SEATS. == Fleet == The Cambus fleet has changed tremendously over the years with addition of new buses and retirement of old ones. The current fleet consists of 36 actively used buses: *Five Orion Bus Industries paratransit buses (Buses 8, 9, 10, 12, 13). Buses 12 and 13 are used for Bionic Bus service. The other Orions have since been retired. *One Opus Optima 30-foot low-floor bus (Bus 11) used exclusively for East Campus Shuttle. * Five 1997 Gillig Phantom 40-foot buses (Buses 83 and 85) used for general service. All have been retired as of 2019 due to the addition of buses 120-122. * Twelve 2008 Gillig 40-foot Low-Floor buses (Buses 94-105) used for general service. * Three 2009 Gillig 40-foot Low-Floor buses (106-108) used for general service. * Eight 2011 Gillig 40-foot Low-Floor buses (Buses 109-116) used for general service. * Two 2013 Gillig 40-foot Low-Floor buses (Buses 117-118) used for general service. * One 2018 Gillig 40-foot Low-Floor bus (Bus 119) used for general service. * Three 2019 Gillig 40-foot Low-Floor buses (Buses 120-122) used for general service. * Three 2013 Gillig 30-foot Low-Floor buses (Buses 14-16) used for general service and Bionic Bus. * One Mobility Ventures MV-1 used for support purposes. * One Ford F-250 pickup truck (with snowplow) used for support purposes. Buses that have been retired, or will retire soon include: * Seven 1989 Gillig Phantom 40-foot buses (Buses 64-78). * Five 1989 Gillig Phantom 35-foot buses (Buses 89-93). These are often referred to as the \\"Madisons\\" because they were bought from Madison (Wisconsin) transit. * The Orion buses 8-10 were expected to retire in Fall 2013. * All 1997 Gillig Phantom 40-foot buses. All buses are outfitted with wheelchair lifts or ramps to assist those with disabilities. ==References * https://web.archive.org/web/20080324144010/http://www.uiowa.edu/~cambus/ Category:Bus transportation in Iowa Category:University and college bus systems Category:University of Iowa Category:Transportation in Johnson County, Iowa Category:1972 establishments in Iowa ","title":"Cambus"},{"id":"6231025","text":"1977 Australian Open may refer to: * 1977 Australian Open (January) * 1977 Australian Open (December) ","title":"1977 Australian Open"},{"id":"6231026","text":"The Mid-Herts Football League was a football competition based in England.

Its strings vibrate a sound board on a resonant body to project a sound wave through the air. The original, general term for this stringed instrument is guitar, and the retronym 'acoustic guitar' distinguishes it from an electric guitar, which relies on electronic amplification. Typically, a guitar's body is a sound box, of which the top side serves as a sound board that enhances the vibration sounds of the strings. In standard tuning the guitar's six strings are tuned (low to high) E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4. Guitar strings may be plucked individually with a pick or fingertip, or strummed to play chords. Plucking a string causes it to vibrate at a fundamental pitch determined by the string's length, mass, and tension. (Overtones are also present, closely related to harmonics of the fundamental pitch.) The string causes the soundboard and the air enclosed by the sound box to vibrate. As these have their own resonances, they amplify some overtones more strongly than others, affecting the timbre of the resulting sound. ==History== The guitar is an ancient instrument, whose history can be traced back into ancient Mesopotamia and Sumer. Many theories have been proposed about the instrument's ancestry, but the modern acoustic guitar comes from a long progression of stringed musical instruments. It has often been claimed that the guitar is a development of the medieval instrument vihuela, which evolved from the ancient lute. Gitterns, (small, plucked guitars) were the first small, guitar-like instruments created during the Spanish Middle Ages with a round back, like that of the lute. Modern guitar- shaped instruments were not seen until the Renaissance era, when the body and size began to take a guitar-like shape. A reconstruction of a medieval gittern, the first guitar-like instrument The earliest string instruments related to the guitar and its structure were broadly known as vihuelas within Spanish musical culture. Vihuelas were string instruments that were commonly seen in the 16th century during the Renaissance. Later, Spanish writers distinguished these instruments into two categories of vihuelas. The vihuela de arco was an instrument that mimicked the violin, and the vihuela de penola was played with a plectrum or by hand. When it was played by hand it was known as the vihuela de mano. Vihuela de mano shared extreme similarities with the Renaissance guitar as it used hand movement at the sound hole or sound chamber of the instrument to create music. By 1790 only six-course vihuela guitars (six unison-tuned pairs of strings) were being created and had become the main type and model of guitar used in Spain. Most of the older 5-course guitars were still in use but were also being modified to a six-coursed acoustical guitar. Fernando Ferandiere's book Arte de tocar la guitarra espanola por musica (Madrid, 1799) describes the standard Spanish guitar from his time as an instrument with seventeen frets and six courses with the first two 'gut' strings tuned in unison called the terceras and the tuning named to 'G' of the two strings. The acoustic guitar at this time began to take the shape familiar in the modern acoustic guitar. The coursed pairs of strings eventually became less common in favor of single strings. Finally, circa 1850, the form and structure of the modern Guitar is credited to Spanish guitar maker Antonio Torres Jurado, who increased the size of the guitar body, altered its proportions, and made use of fan bracing, which first appeared in guitars made by Francisco Sanguino in the late 18th century. The bracing pattern, which refers to the internal pattern of wood reinforcements used to secure the guitar's top and back to prevent the instrument from collapsing under tension, is an important factor in how the guitar sounds. Torres' design greatly improved the volume, tone, and projection of the instrument, and it has remained essentially unchanged since. ==Acoustic properties== Basic anatomy of a steel-string acoustic guitar The acoustic guitar's soundboard, or top, also has a strong effect on the loudness of the guitar. Woods that are good at transmitting sound, like spruce, are commonly used for the soundboard. No amplification occurs in this process, because musicians add no external energy to increase the loudness of the sound (as would be the case with an electronic amplifier). All the energy is provided by the plucking of the string. Without a soundboard, however, the string would just \\"cut\\" through the air without moving it much. The soundboard increases the surface of the vibrating area in a process called mechanical impedance matching. The soundboard can move the air much more easily than the string alone, because it is large and flat. This increases the entire system's energy transfer efficiency, and musicians emit a much louder sound. In addition, the acoustic guitar has a hollow body, and an additional coupling and resonance effect increases the efficiency of energy transmission in lower frequencies. The air in a guitar's cavity resonates with the vibrational modes of the string and soundboard. At low frequencies, which depend on the size of the box, the chamber acts like a Helmholtz resonator, increasing or decreasing the volume of the sound again depending on whether the air in the box moves in phase or out of phase with the strings. When in phase, the sound increases by about 3 decibels. In opposing phase, it decreases about 3 decibels. As a Helmholtz resonator, the air at the opening is vibrating in or out of phase with the air in the box and in or out of phase with the strings. These resonance interactions attenuate or amplify the sound at different frequencies, boosting or damping various harmonic tones. Ultimately, the cavity air vibrations couple to the outside air through the sound hole, though some variants of the acoustic guitar omit this hole, or have f holes, like a violin family instrument (a trait found in some electric guitars such as the ES-335 and ES-175 models from Gibson). This coupling is most efficient because here the impedance matching is perfect: it is air pushing air. A guitar has several sound coupling modes: string to soundboard, soundboard to cavity air, and both soundboard and cavity air to outside air. The back of the guitar also vibrates to some degree, driven by air in the cavity and mechanical coupling to the rest of the guitar. The guitar‚Äîas an acoustic system‚Äîcolors the sound by the way it generates and emphasizes harmonics, and how it couples this energy to the surrounding air (which ultimately is what we perceive as loudness). Improved coupling, however, comes costing decay time, since the string's energy is more efficiently transmitted. Solid body electric guitars (with no soundboard at all) produce very low volume, but tend to have long sustain. All these complex air coupling interactions, and the resonant properties of the panels themselves, are a key reason that different guitars have different tonal qualities. The sound is a complex mixture of harmonics that give the guitar its distinctive sound. ==Amplification== Ovation Adamas, whose parabolic shape reduces feedback Classical gut-string guitars lacked adequate projection, and were unable to displace banjos until innovations introduced helped to increase their volume. Two important innovations were introduced by United States firm C.F. Martin: steel strings and the increasing of the guitar top area; the popularity of Martin's larger \\"dreadnought\\" body size among acoustic performers is related to the greater sound volume produced. These innovations allowed guitars to compete with and often displace the banjos that had previously dominated jazz bands. The steel-strings increased tension on the neck; for stability, Martin reinforced the neck with a steel truss rod, which became standard in later steel-string guitars. rosettes around the sound hole. An acoustic guitar can be amplified by using various types of pickups or microphones. However, amplification of acoustic guitars had many problems with audio feedback. In the 1960s, Ovation's parabolic bowls dramatically reduced feedback, allowing greater amplification of acoustic guitars. In the 1970s, Ovation developed thinner sound-boards with carbon-based composites laminating a thin layer of birch, in its Adamas model, which has been viewed as one of the most radical designs in the history of acoustic guitars. The Adamas model dissipated the sound-hole of the traditional soundboard among 22 small sound-holes in the upper chamber of the guitar, yielding greater volume and further reducing feedback during amplification. Another method for reducing feedback is to fit a rubber or plastic disc into the sound hole. The most common type of pickups used for acoustic guitar amplification are piezo and magnetic pickups. Piezo pickups are generally mounted under the bridge saddle of the acoustic guitar and can be plugged into a mixer or amplifier. A Piezo pickup made by Baldwin was incorporated in the body of Ovation guitars, rather than attached by drilling through the body; the combination of the Piezo pickup and parabolic (\\"roundback\\") body helped Ovation succeed in the market during the 1970s. Magnetic pickups on acoustic guitars are generally mounted in the sound hole, and are similar to those in electric guitars. An acoustic guitar with pickups for electrical amplification is called an acoustic-electric guitar. In the 2000s, manufacturers introduced new types of pickups to try to amplify the full sound of these instruments. This includes body sensors, and systems that include an internal microphone along with body sensors or under-the-saddle pickups. == Types == Historical and modern acoustic guitars are extremely varied in their design and construction, far more so than electric guitars. Some of the most important varieties are the classical guitar (Spanish Guitar/Nylon-stringed), steel-string acoustic guitar and lap steel guitar.

Range ‚Äì B. Parlor ‚Äì C. Grand Concert ‚Äì D. Auditorium ‚Äì E. Dreadnought ‚Äì F. Jumbo Range ‚Äì The smallest common body shape, sometimes called a mini jumbo, is three-quarters the size of a jumbo-shaped guitar. A range shape typically has a rounded back to improve projection for the smaller body. The smaller body and scale length make the range guitar an option for players who struggle with larger body guitars. Parlor ‚Äì Parlor guitars have small compact bodies and have been described as ‚Äúpunchy‚Äù sounding with a delicate tone. It normally has 12 open frets. The smaller body makes the parlor a more comfortable option for players who find large body guitars uncomfortable. Grand Concert ‚Äì This mid-sized body shape is not as deep as other full-size guitars, but has a full waist. Because of the smaller body, grand concert guitars have a more controlled overtone and are often used for its sound projection when recording. Auditorium ‚Äì Similar in dimensions to the dreadnought body shape, but with a much more pronounced waist. The shifting of the waist provides different tones to stand out. The auditorium body shape is a newer body when compared to the other shapes such as dreadnought. Dreadnought ‚Äì This is the classic guitar body shape. The style was designed by Martin Guitars to produce a deeper sound than \\"classic\\"-style guitars, with very resonant bass. The body is large and the waist of the guitar is not as pronounced as the auditorium and grand concert bodies. Jumbo ‚Äì The largest standard guitar body shape found on acoustic guitars. Jumbo is bigger than a Grand Auditorium but similarly proportioned, and is generally designed to provide a deep tone similar to a dreadnought's. It was designed by Gibson to compete with the dreadnought, but with maximum resonant space for greater volume and sustain. The foremost example of the style is the Gibson J-200, but like the dreadnought, most guitar manufacturers have at least one jumbo model. ==Gallery== File:Wartburg-Laute.JPGGittern (1450) File:Lute (by Princess Ruto, 2013-02-11).jpgLute (17th century) File:Jean-Nicolas_Grobert_- _Early_Romantic_Guitar,_Paris_around_1830.jpgRomantic guitar (c. 1830) File:Classical Guitar two views2.pngClassical guitar File:JME_ten_string_guitar.jpgTen-string File:Gibson SJ200.jpgSteel-string acoustic guitar File:Resonator Style0.jpgResonator guitar File:Chitarra_battente_(2).jpgChitarra battente File:Guitarra-lira.jpgLyre- guitar File:Pikasso_Guitar_(lowres).jpgPikasso File:Lapstyle.jpgSteel guitar (c. 1920) File:Guitare harpe.jpgHarp guitar File:Vihuela Mexicana 001.JPGMexican vihuela ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * Category:Rhythm section ","title":"Acoustic guitar"},{"id":"6231040","text":"Mael M√≥rdha (; ) are an Irish doom metal band from Dublin, Ireland.

On the strength of the band‚Äôs last two EPs, Caoineadh na nGael and Cluain Tarbh, the band was signed to Dutch label Karmageddon Media which released the band‚Äôs first album, Cluain Tarbh on 12 September 2005. An alternative recording of the album title track was released on a limited edition 7 inch vinyl split with their fellow Irishmen Primordial, through Sentinel Records in the winter of 2005. Due to severe internal problems within Karmageddon and a lack of availability of the album, the band left the label and signed to Grau Records in Germany in February 2006. Gealtacht Mael M√≥rdha is the band's first album to be released through Grau Records, on 19 March 2007. In 2008, their debut album was re-released by Grau Records with two additional tracks previously recorded on the band's first EP, The Path to Insanity. The band has played the Abbeyleix Metalfest (Ireland - 1999), Day Of Darkness (Ireland - 2003, 2004, 2007), Bloodstock Open Air (England - 2006, 2013), Heathen Crusade II (Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States- 2007), Doom Shall Rise, (G√∂ppingen, Germany - 2007) and Dutch Doom Days (Rotterdam, The Netherlands - 2007). The band entered the Irish leg of the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 in late 2004, with the aim of entering the finals held in Kiev, Ukraine in 2005. Mael M√≥rdha's third album, entitled Manann√°n, was released on 14 May 2010, by Grau Records. Between November 2011 and January 2012 Mael M√≥rdha recorded their fourth album at Foel Studio in Wales, with producer Chris Fielding. Entitled Damned When Dead, the album was released by Candlelight Records in September 2013. In January 2014, Roib√©ard √ì Bogail left the band.

The population of the community Krokees was 1,175 in 2011. The municipal unit Krokees (pop. 2,364) consists of the communities Krokees, Dafnio, Vasilaki and Lagi. ==History== Krokees is a small town south of Sparta between the mountains of Taygetos and Parnon of Laconia, the most southern regional unit of the Peloponnese and mainland Greece. In the Bronze Age, Krokees was inhabited by the Achaean and Pelasgian tribes. Later, around 1100 BC, with the rest of Laconia, the town was taken over by the Dorians. In antiquity, Krokees was famous for its beautiful forest green volcanic stone with green and golden spots (Porphyry) known as \\"Krokeatis lithos\\" (Krokean stone). This stone is unique to the area of \\"Psiphi\\" of Krokees. Although this stone is very difficult to work with and shape, it was widely used for decorating wealthy homes and for creating beautiful pots and vases. It was used to decorate public bathhouses such as the ones in Corinth, the Church of St. Sophia in Constantinople and the Church of St. Paul in the Vatican. The simple tomb of the 300 Spartans in Thermopylae is made with Krokean stone. Dioskouri (the sons of Dias or Zeus) were the gods/protectors of the ancient town of Krokeai. A marble plaque of Dioskouri, which was excavated in recent times, adorns the fountain in the central square of the town. Following the Orlov events, in 1777, many inhabitants of Krokees bearing the name \\"Theoharakos\\" () migrated to Koldere, near Magnesia (ad Sipylum).H Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒÆ œÑœâŒΩ ŒöŒøŒªœÑŒµœÅŒπœâœÑœéŒΩ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ£ŒºœçœÅŒΩŒ∑œÇ ‚Äì Œ§ŒøœÖ ŒúœâœÖœÉŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ∑ Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒπœéœÑŒ∑ e-ptolemeos.gr The modern town of Krokees has approximately 1200 inhabitants.

Around 300 Tamils were killed in the riots. ==Background== After the independence and especially after the 'Sinhala only act\\" of 1956, Tamil parties were asking for more power for the North and east of Sri Lanka where Tamils are the majority. Some had gone further, asking for a federal system. There were many agreements (at least two) with the Prime ministers, but nothing implemented. Finally, the desperate Tamil leaders decided that there was no point in co-existence and only solution was a separate state. In 1974, all major Tamil parties representing Tamils in the North east came under one forum (named as Tamil United Liberation Front - TULF) and in 1976 they adopted a resolution at their party convention in Vaddukoddai, Jaffna calling for a separate state (Tamil Eelam). The election of 1977 took place on July 21, 1977. The Tamil districts voted almost entirely for the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), a political party in Sri Lanka to openly advocate separatism of the Tamil regions of the country. For some years, there had been sporadic attacks on army and policemen in the Jaffna region, by militant Tamil youth groups which consisted a handful of members advocating separation through violent means. The new prime minister, Junius Richard Jayewardene, was convinced there was a link between the TULF and the militants, and wanted to suppress both. ==Anti-Left pogrom== Prior to the 1977 elections, JR Jayawardene promised that he would give the Police a week's leave so that his supporters could attack members of opposing parties. After his victory, his Government launched unprecedented state violence against the opposition, targeting supporters of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, and the People's Democratic Party. In particular, some 9,000 families of supporters of LSSP leader N.M. Perera in Yatiyantota were driven from their homes, many of which were destroyed. ==The ethnic pogrom== There were different beliefs on how the riots started. Some believe they started when there was a dispute that began when four policemen entered a carnival without tickets. Apparently the policemen were inebriated and proceeded to attack those who asked for tickets. The conflict escalated and the policemen were beaten up by the public and in retaliation the police opened fire. Others have the view that the carnival incident was a pretext, inquiries revealing that it was conducted in an organized manner and was hence a pre-planned attack. The riot started on August 12, 1977, within less than a month of the new government taking office. Walter Schwarz wrote in Tamils of Sri Lanka, Minority Rights Group Report 1983': Edmund Samarakkody in Workers Vanguard (New York) reported': ==Government response== Questioned in Parliament by Amirthalingam, Prime Minister Jayewardene was defiant, blaming the riots on the TULF: > People become restive when they hear that a separate state is to be formed. > Whatever it is, when statements of that type are made, the newspapers carry > them throughout the island, and when you say that you are not violent, but > that violence may be used in time to come, what do you think the other > people in Sri Lanka will do? How will they react? If you want to fight, let > there be a fight; if it is peace, let there be peace; that is what they will > say. It is not what I am saying. The people of Sri Lanka say that. Finally, on August 20, the government ordered curfews and deployed the military to quell the riots. ==Aftermath== More than 75,000 plantation Tamils became victims of racial and ethnic violence and were forced to relocate to parts of North and East Sri Lanka. The events during the pogrom radicalized Tamil youths, convincing many that the TULF's strategy of using legal and constitutional means to achieve independence would never work, and armed insurrection was the only way forward. The outbreak of the pogrom highlighted the TULF's inability to provide safety for the Tamils. It was only after the pogrom, the TELO and LTTE, the two major Tamil liberation groups began an active campaign for a separate Tamil Eelam. Uma Maheswaran, a TULF activist, joined the LTTE in 1977 and was made the organization's chairman by Velupillai Prabhakaran. Many such Tamil activists began to join various Tamil militant groups to fight for separate statehood. ==See also== *Black July *Ethnic problem in Sri Lanka *State terrorism in Sri Lanka *List of riots and pogroms in Sri Lanka ==NotesReferences== * * Category:1977 riots Category:History of Sri Lanka (1948‚Äìpresent) Category:Sri Lankan Tamil politics Category:Ethnic riots Category:Riots and civil disorder in Sri Lanka Category:August 1977 events in Asia ","title":"1977 anti-Tamil pogrom"},{"id":"6231069","text":"Wilder Napalm is a 1993 American romantic comedy film directed by Glenn Gordon Caron, written by Vince Gilligan, and starring Dennis Quaid, Arliss Howard, and Debra Winger.

Wilder Napalm was one of the two screenplays along with Home Fries that turned into films during this time in his career.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/magazine/the-dark-art-of-breaking- bad.html ==Plot summary== Wallace (Dennis Quaid) and Wilder Foudroyant (Arliss Howard) are brothers and pyrokinetics. Ever since a childhood tragedy where they accidentally killed a homeless person sleeping in a friend's \\"secret clubhouse,\\" they have kept their firestarting abilities a secret. Now that they are grown up and estranged, Wallace (performing as Biff the Clown in a traveling carnival) wants to debut his talents on The David Letterman Show. Wilder has a monotonous job in a minuscule Kwik Foto booth at a dying mall and is a volunteer firefighter. When Wallace brings the carnival to Wilder's Florida hometown, the tension between the brothers over Wilder's oversexed wife, Vida (Debra Winger), explodes. Unable to convince Wilder to forgo his Bingo-calling on her first day of freedom after a year of house arrest for inadvertent arson, Vida goes off with Wally. They share a kiss at a miniature golf course, which bursts into the flames of their passion. Returning home after he and the other firefighters have extinguished the flames at the golf course, Wilder discovers Vida and Wally about to make love on the roof of the house trailer. Wally and Wilder fight it out, with Wally setting the trailer ablaze. All three are jailed, but Wally and Vida are bailed out by Wally's friend and carnival partner, Rex (Jim Varney). In a deep slump, Wilder goes back to the Kwik Foto (surrounded by the carnival) while Vida stays at the firehouse. Wally goads him into fighting for Vida, and their climactic fight sets half the carnival's rides ablaze. The denouement shows Vida and Wilder (the latter now wearing Vida's house arrest ankle monitor) watching Wallace on a successful Letterman reappearance as Dr. Napalm. ==Cast== * Dennis Quaid as Wallace Foudroyant * Debra Winger as Vida Foudroyant * Arliss Howard as Wilder Foudroyant * M.

The Doppler shift, Œîfd, is related to the fluid velocity. The relatively small frequency shift (order 1 GHz) is discriminated using an atomic or molecular vapor filter. This approach is conceptually similar to what is now known as Filtered Rayleigh Scattering (Miles and Lempert, 1990). ==Equipment== Up to now, a typical one-component PDV instrument utilizes a pulsed injection-seeded Nd:YAG laser, one or two scientific grade CCD cameras and a molecular iodine filter. The laser is used to illuminate a plane of the flow with narrow spectral linewidth light. The Doppler shifted scattered light is then split into two paths using a beamsplitter and imaged onto the camera(s). In this manner the absolute absorption of scattered light, as it passes through an iodine cell placed in one of the beam paths, is measured at every spatial location within the object plane. For scattering by relatively large (i.e. Mie scattering) particles, this absorption is a function of particle velocity alone. Accurate calibration and image mapping algorithms have been developed with the result that velocity accuracies of ~1‚Äì2 m/s are possible. More details concerning the history of PDV, the art of its application and recent advances can be found in comprehensive review articles by Elliott and Beutner (1999) and Samimy and Wernet (2000). == Strengths == PDV is well suited for high-speed flow measurements where concerns about particle seeding make PIV impractical. Although PDV requires particles to scatter light, individual particles do not need to be imaged thus allowing the use of much smaller seed particles and making the measurements less sensitive to particle seed density. For example, in some unheated supersonic flow facilities it is possible to use condensation of a vapor, such as water, acetone or ethanol, to produce seed particles in the flow. Particles formed using this method, known as product formation, have been estimated to be ~50 micrometres in diameter. Unlike PIV, PDV requires only a single image of the flow field. This image may taken over a long period (relative to characteristics times scales within the flow) to produce time-averaged images or alternatively using a single laser pulse (approximately 10ns) to obtain a measurement of instantaneous flow velocities. The duration of a single laser pulse is at least an order of magnitude shorter than pulse separations used within PIV. This feature of PDV enables improved resolution of sharp velocity discontinuities such as shock waves. In addition, PDV has an inherently higher resolution than PIV (where small image subregions are used to determine the velocity typically 16 x 16 pixels) and a velocity measurement may be obtained for each pixel within the flow image. However, particularly in the case of instantaneous measurement using PDV, some pixel binning is used to attenuate the deleterious effects of laser speckle and improve the Signal-to-Noise ratio. == Weaknesses == The main weakness of PDV is the complex optical set up required to get accurate measurements. For each component of velocity, two images (signal and reference) are required, which typically necessitates two cameras. To obtain all three components of velocity, therefore, requires the simultaneous use of up to six cameras, although recent work by Charrett et al. (2006) and Hawkes et al. (2004) has progressively enabled the number of cameras required from six to a single camera. In addition, the laser used for the measurements must be narrow linewidth, which is typically performed by injection seeding of the laser cavity. Even with seeding, the laser frequency can fluctuate with time and must be monitored. These introduce additional complexity to the experimental set-up. PDV systems, although used in many laboratories, are not yet commercially available and can be quite expensive (equipment, data processing, experience, labor, etc.) if built from scratch. == References == * Elliott, G.

Every year, the program accepts online applications from emerging artists from November through January, and selects 65 to participate in the nine-week intensive summer program. Admissions decisions are announced in April. The school provides participants with housing, food, and studio space, and the campus offers a library, media lab, and sculpture shop, among other amenities. The tuition for the program is $6,000, however aid is available, ensuring that everyone accepted into the program can attend, regardless of financial need. While on campus, the participants interact with five or six resident faculty artists for the duration of the program, as well as five to seven visiting faculty artists, both of whom are selected by Skowhegan‚Äôs Board of Governors. Participants are not allowed to bring family or friends with them to Skowhegan, nor are visitors allowed on campus. Lectures by faculty artists, which are generally held on Fridays, are open to the public. ==History== During World War II, New England portrait painter Willard C. Cummings was stationed in Alaska in the War Art Unit. There, he shared his idea for an educational model ‚Äúwhere young artists could study with leading artists of the time‚Äù with Sidney Simon, a sculptor also in the Unit. Upon returning from the war in 1946, with the help of Simon, Henry Varnum Poor, already an established presence in American Art, and Charles Cutler, a New England stone sculptor, Cummings turned his family farm into a functional alternative school run by artists for artists. As the name indicates, Skowhegan was originally focused on the traditional art forms of painting and sculpture, but gradually, the program began accepting artists of all practices, even being the alleged site of the first contemporary Land Art piece in 1968 by Douglas Leichter and Richard Saba. Similarly, while the school originally offered classes such as life drawing or plein air painting, it eventually forwent traditional forms of instruction save for weekly faculty lectures, and all classes on campus are now self-directed by participants. Fresco instruction, however, has always been a part of the program. Today, Skowhegan is one of the few institutions in the United States that teaches this technique. Since 2010, N. Sean Glover has been the fresco instructor. Since 1952, Skowhegan has recorded the lectures given on campus by resident and visiting faculty artists. They now comprise an archive of over 700 lectures and are accessible to artists and researchers in select repositories including The Colby College Museum of Art, The Archives of American Art, The Art Institute of Chicago, The Getty Research Institute, and The Museum of Modern Art ==Notable alumni== See also Category list of Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture alumni.

In ancient times, this temple was famous as Shri 1008 Bhagvan Chandra-Prabhu Digamber Jain Mandir and this village was called Madhupuri. Script carved on wooden pillars of temple shows that this kshetra is more than 1000 years old. This temple was reconstructed in V. S. 1625 & 1827\\\\. building of temple shows that 1000 years ago, there lived a huge population of Jains in this area. Appearance & Miracles of Bhagvan Vighn-Har Parshv Nath Shri Vighn-Har Parshv Nath's idol was found in a farm of a farmer in village Sultanabad, District Pashchim Khan Desh (Maharashtra). For some time the idol was worshipped in farm, later on to shift the idol to a safe and suitable place, a group traveling was organized with idol placed in a chariot. On the rout of traveling, at many places efforts were made to bring idol out of chariot, but all failed. Neither the chariot was stopped nor the idol could be brought down the chariot. At last, the chariot stopped before Bhagvan Chandra Prabhu Digamber Jain Mandir of Mahua and hear the idol was easily brought down of chariot. Then a Panch Kalyanak Pratishtha Mahotsava was organized, and thus reverenced idol was established in the central room of temple. Bhagvan Chandra Prabhu's idol was placed in the right side and Bhagvan Shantinath's in left side of this miraculous idol of Bhagvan Parshv Nath. ===Miracles=== After the establishment of Parshv Nath's idol, Jains & other societies felt a wave of happiness and problems of public started disappearing. So this idol became famous as Vighn- Har Parshv Nath. Devotees coming here from various parts of India and abroad feel eternal peace and pleasure. ===Evidence from scriptures=== Shri Brahm Gyan Sagar in his text writes that various monks and Jains often come here for pilgrimage. Bhattarak Vadi Chandra, the scholar of Bhattarak Prabha Chandra wrote a play here in V. S. 1648 called ‚ÄòGyan-Suryodaya Natak‚Äô, Shri Brahm- Harsh a scholar of Shri Lakshmisen also described Shri Parshv Nath of Mahua.

It is one of the Coledale group of fells situated seven kilometres south west of Keswick and reaches a height of 672 metres (2205 feet). ==Topography== The fell is part of the long ridge that radiates easterly from Eel Crag and includes the adjoining fells of Sail and Causey Pike before dropping to the Newlands Valley. Scar Crags is characterised by steep craggy flanks on its southern side which fall away steeply to Rigg Beck, while the northern slopes are less steep and grassy as they drop to Stoneycroft Gill. ==Geology== The ridgeline is composed of the laminated mudstone and siltstone of the Kirkstile Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) ==Ascents== Scar Crags is very rarely climbed directly. The only feasible direct ascent follows an old mine road that starts from Stair and goes up Stoneycroft Gill to finish at Sail Pass, from where it is a short ascent to the fell summit. Scar Crags is more usually approached from the east along the ridge from Causey Pike or from the west from Sail. It is a busy fell as it is part of the Coledale Round, a 17.5 kilometre walk starting and finishing at Braithwaite or Stair in the Newlands valley and including the other nearby fells of Grisedale Pike, Hopegill Head, Eel Crag, Sail, and Causey Pike with over 1300 metres of ascent. ==Summit== The top of the fell is grassy and often muddy with a small cairn and gives a heady view down onto Rigg Beck and a good but not exceptional all round view of the district. ==Mining== The northern slopes of Scar Crags, below Long Crag, contain the remains of the Lake District‚Äôs only cobalt mine. It was opened by the Keswick Mining Company in 1846, who invested ¬£7,000 in the project. A road and an inclined tramway were built to convey the ore down to Stoneycroft in the Newlands valley. Four adits were driven into the hillside, the longest being about 60 metres in length. The mine was not a success as it was impossible to extract the mineral from the ore in the expected quantities and it closed in due course. ==References== * A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, The North Western Fells: Alfred Wainwright: * Mines and Mining in the English Lake District: John Postlethwaite: Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls ","title":"Scar Crags"},{"id":"6231117","text":"1,1,1,3,3-Pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) is a hydrofluorocarbon used primarily for closed-cell spray foam insulation produced by Honeywell and in Asia by Sinochem. Honeywell markets HFC-245fa under the Enovate and Genetron 245fa brand names. HFC-245fa is also known as pentafluoropropane and by its chemical name 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane. Unlike CFC and HCFC blowing agents formerly used for this purpose, it has no ozone depletion potential and is nearly non- toxic. Although it is intended to remain trapped within the foam insulation, it is practically non biodegradable with a lifetime of 7.2 years when it eventually does escape into the atmosphere. It does have a high global warming potential of 950 (950 times the global warming effect of ). Honeywell refers to this as \\"acceptable\\" in their literature, but they don't include the actual number. AlliedSignal, who adopted the Honeywell name after acquiring it, decided in 1999 to provide a non ozone depleting blowing agent as an alternative for dichlorofluoroethane (HCFC-141b) and trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11). Competitors Atofina and General Electric pursued strategies using other agents. One of the disadvantages of R-245fa is its cost. In 2000 R-141b cost one US dollar per pound, whereas R-245fa cost $2.50 to $4.00 per pound. As of 2007, and prior to Sinochem's production it was already a high volume production chemical, with over 1 million pounds produced annually. ==See also== *Building insulation *Fiberglass *Honeywell ==References *Honeywell's Enovate Homepage *Housingzone.com Article about Solving Problems with Spray Foam Category:Insulators Category:Refrigerants Category:Fluoroalkanes ","title":"Pentafluoropropane"},{"id":"6231127","text":"Mahuva may refer to the following places in Gujarat, western India: * Mahuva, Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra peninsula ** Mahuva (Vidhan Sabha constituency) ** Mahuva Junction railway station * Mahuva, Surat * Mowa State, a former princely state in Kathiawar ","title":"Mahuva"},{"id":"6231135","text":"Peabody Hall is a historic site in Gainesville, Florida, United States.

At the age of fifteen he began an affair with his high school philosophy teacher, Ren√© Scherer. They remained lifelong friends.Who's Who in Contemporary Gay and Lesbian History By Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon; p.191 His participation in the May 1968 student rebellion in France formed his allegiance to the Communist Party, which later expelled him because of his homosexuality. Hocquenghem taught philosophy at the University of Vincennes-Saint Denis, Paris and wrote numerous novels and works of theory. He was the staff writer for the French publication Lib√©ration. Hocquenghem was a prominent member of the Front Homosexuel d'Action R√©volutionnaire (FHAR), originally formed by lesbian and feminist activists who split from the Mouvement Homophile de France in 1971. With filmmaker Lionel Soukaz (b. 1953), Hocquenghem wrote and produced a documentary film about gay history, Race d'Ep! (1979) the last word of the title being a play on the word p√©d√©, a French slur for gay men.Race d'Ep (1979) Though Hocquenghem had a significant impact on leftist thinking in France, his reputation has failed to grow to international prominence. Only the first of his theoretical tracts, Homosexual Desire (1972) and his first novel, L'Amour en relief (1982) have been translated into English. Although Race d'Ep! was shown at Roxie Cinema in San Francisco in April 1980 and released in America as The Homosexual Century, like Hocquenghem, the film is virtually unknown. ==Career== Hocquenghem's Homosexual Desire (1972, English translation 1978) may be the first work of Queer Theory. Drawing on the theories of desiring-production developed by Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari in their Capitalism and Schizophrenia project (1972-1980), Hocquenghem critiqued the influential models of the psyche and sexual desire derived from the psychoanalysts Jacques Lacan and Sigmund Freud. The author also addressed the relation of capitalism to sexualities, the dynamics of desire, and the political effects of gay group- identities. Moreover, he repudiated the prospect of a new gay 'social organisation' of politics, along with the injunction to sacrifice oneself in the name of future generations.Lee Edelman, No Future:Queer Theory and the Death Drive, Duke University Press, 2005, page 31 The sociologist Jeffrey Weeks's 1978 preface to the first English translation of Homosexual Desire situates the essay in relation to the various, mostly French, theories of subjectivity and desire surrounding and influencing Hocquenghem's thought. It was republished in French in 2000. Additionally, Hocquenghem wrote the following works: * L'Apr√®s-Mai des faunes (1974) is the second and untranslated queer-theoretical text. * Co-ire, album syst√©matique de l'enfance (Co-anger: systematic album of childhood) (1976) examines childhood sexuality from a Marxist perspective, co-written with professor Ren√© Sch√©rer. It is rumored that Sch√©rer and Hocquenghem had an affair in 1959, when the latter was 15. *Fin de section (1976) is a short story collection. * La D√©rive homosexuelle (1977) is the third and untranslated queer-theoretical text. * La Beaut√© du m√©tis (1979) analyzed French anti-Arab feeling and homophobia. * L'Amour en relief (Love in Relief) (1982, English translation 1985) is Hocquenghem's first and most famous novel. A blind Tunisian boy explores French society and discovers the ways in which pleasure can form a resistance to totalitarianism. The novel contextualizes homosexual desire as a resistance to white supremacy and racism. * La Col√®re de l'agneau (The Wrath of the Lamb) (1985) is an experiment in millenarian and apocalyptic narrative, taking St. John the Evangelist as its subject. * L'√Çme atomique (The Atomic Heart) (1986) was written partly in response to Hocquenghem's deteriorating health, again in collaboration with Sch√©rer. This work espouses a philosophy composed of dandyism, gnosticism, and epicureanism. * Open letter to those who moved from Mao collars to Rotary wheels, Marseilles, Agone (1986) was republished in 2003 with a foreword by Serge Halimi. * Eve (1987) is a narrative which combines the story of Genesis with a description of the changes in the body from AIDS- related symptoms, written as Hocquenghem's own body deteriorated. * Voyages et aventures extraordinaires du Fr√®re Angelo (1988) explores the mind of an Italian monk accompanying the conquistadors to the New World. ==The Screwball Asses== The Screwball Asses (Les Culs √ânergum√®nes, lit. The Energetic Asses) is an essay which originally appeared in the twelfth (March 1973) issue of Recherches, a French journal. (French) Edited by F√©lix Guattari and the FHAR, the issue was devoted to homosexuality; the issue bore the title Trois milliards de pervers: Grande Encyclop√©die des Homosexualit√©s (Three Billion Perverts: Grand Encyclopedia of Homosexualities). Shortly after publication, copies of the issue were seized by French authorities; the issue was ordered destroyed, and Guattari was fined 600 francs for his role in the issue's creation. The Screwball Asses was published in English in 2010, with authorship attributed to Hocquenghem. However according to Hocquenghem's biographer Antoine Idier, the author of the text is not Hocquenghem but the French writer Christian Maurel.Antoine Idier, Les Vies de Guy Hocquenghem, Fayard, 2017 A German translation of the text is published in September 2019 by the publishing house August Verlag with the attribution to Christian Maurel, under the title F√ºr den Arsch.Christian Maurel, F√ºr den Arsch, August Verlag, 2019 The Screwball Asses is a critique of various issues in left-wing politics and gay culture, using Marxist and Freudian vocabulary: The author describes the \\"ghetto\\" of gay male life in 1970s France, which in his account is often confined to cruising in public restrooms.The Screwball Asses, pp. 7-8. Hypocrisy among gay men and left-wing activists is also criticized; the author describes the sexual attraction of white gay Frenchmen to Arab men as a form of white guilt, and he decries the tendency in left-wing circles to denounce speakers who use \\"suspect\\" words in good faith. The author rejects psychological theories which explain homosexuality as the result of a psychological defect, or unresolved conflict. He also explains gay male archetypes and binaries (e.g. \\"uber-male or sub-male, black or white, Arab or Viking, top or bottom, and so forth\\"The Screwball Asses, p. 17.) as forms of mimicry which are caused by heteronormative socialization with heterosexuals, which in turn is informed by capitalism. The author also laments the gay/lesbian split within the FHAR, suggests that homophobia among heterosexuals is a defense mechanism against latent homosexuality, and touches on the concept of bisexual erasure as it relates to gay or straight people (monosexuals) whose partners could, theoretically, leave them for a partner of the other sex. He also provides a personal detail which is incongruous with Hocqhenghem's purported authorship: \\"It's lucky I'm gay, because I give a bad impression at the FHAR.

Established in the Middle Ages, the town features many historical monuments significant to the Polish Lubusz Voivodeship (since the Local Government Reorganization Act of 1998). From 1975‚Äì1998 Sulech√≥w was part of Zielona G√≥ra Voivodeship. The town limits cover . Olga Tokarczuk, the Nobel Prize in Literature winner for 2018 was born in 1962 in Sulech√≥w. ==Geography== Sulech√≥w is situated in the historic Lower Silesia region, north of the Oder river. The town centre is located about northeast of the regional capital Zielona G√≥ra, where the national road 32 to Pozna≈Ñ crosses the expressway S3 to Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski. The regional Zielona G√≥ra Airport is about away. ==History== The settlement of the region on the Middle Oder dates back to the 4th century AD. ===Medieval Poland=== By conquest at the end of the 10th century the area became part of the Polish realm of the Piast dynasty. It became part of the Duchy of Silesia, a province of fragmented Poland, in 1138, and, later belonged to the Silesian Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w, established in 1249-51 under the rule of Duke Konrad I. Sulech√≥w Castle and former Calvinist church The settlement itself was first mentioned in a 1319 deed, at the time when the warlike Ascanian margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg campaigned the area, occupying Sulech√≥w and neighbouring ≈öwiebodzin. Margrave Waldemar, however, died in the same year, and the localities fell back to the Piast dukes of G≈Çog√≥w.Sulech√≥w - Internetowy Serwis Miejski When the last Piast duke Henry XI of G≈Çog√≥w died without issue in 1476, inheritance claims were raised by his widow Barbara of Brandenburg and her father, the Hohenzollern elector Albrecht Achilles. The Brandenburg influence met with fierce opposition by Henry's Piast cousin, Duke Jan II the Mad of ≈ªaga≈Ñ, who nevertheless after several years of fighting had to sign an agreement, whereby the Silesian towns of Crossen (Krosno) and the town passed to the Margraviate of Brandenburg as a fief of the Bohemian (Czech) Kingdom. ===Modern era=== Krosno's Gate Along with Crossen, Sulech√≥w, under its German name Z√ºllichau, was incorporated into the Brandenburg Neumark district by 1535, ruled by Margrave John of Brandenburg-K√ºstrin who implemented the Protestant Reformation. Two years later, the Piast duke Joachim of M√ºnsterberg-Oels and his younger brothers officially waived any rights to the Crossen and Z√ºllichau territories. Part of Brandenburg-Prussia from 1618, the town was devastated during the Thirty Years' War but again flourished under the rule of the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William. From the 17th century, clothmaking developed. Z√ºllichau was part of the newly established Kingdom of Prussia since 1701. It became a garrison town of the Prussian Army. The Polish minority resisted Germanisation attempts, carried out by the Prussian authorities. From 1815 it belonged to the Province of Brandenburg and became the administrative seat of the Z√ºllichau-Schwiebus rural district within the Frankfurt Region. In 1828, 18-year-old Fr√©d√©ric Chopin visited the town and gave an improvised concert.Sulech√≥w - Internetowy Serwis Miejski - Fryderyk Chopin w Sulechowie Between 1871 and 1945 Z√ºllichau was part of the German Reich. During World War II the Germans established two forced labour camps in the town, mainly for the Soviets.

In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the town was incorporated into the Republic of Poland by the implementation of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line in 1945, while the remaining German population was expelled.

Super Star is a fairground ride once manufactured by Northern Amusements (NA Superides). Carol and David Ward of Northern Amusements saw the sketches of their proposed Super Star, and the Autumn of the year saw a ride debut for Patrick Burton. The ride features a different approach to obtaining the looping and spinning motions, lifting a single boom arm which then twists around its own axle, lifting a spinning frame of 8 main arms with a 4-person seat gondolas In the rear of the gondola there is a hydraulic ram which pulls the seating units into an outward position. Once in this position the riders will be at a 90 degree angle when the ride is lifted to its 45 degree position. A safety system will then engage at the bottom of the ride to prevent the gondola from coming down in the event of an emergency. When the ride is in its elevated position, the operator has the choice of rotating the main boom clockwise, or anti-clockwise. On some Super Stars, the boom can be lowered while the ride is in the fully inverted position. This form of operation is only used on one Super Star worldwide. The ride is packed onto one semi-trailer and has a fairly quick build-up time. Super Star rides are capable of having a complete back-flash fitted with airbrushed artwork and neon lighting.

His first assignment was as Bishop of Montana, a missionary field that included Montana, Utah, and Idaho. ==Early and family life== He was born on January 26, 1837 and graduated from an academy in Delhi, New York in 1850. Bishop Wainwright confirmed him in the Episcopal Church shortly before he entered what was then Columbia College. After graduating in 1857, Tuttle attended the General Theological Seminary and graduated in 1862. He married the former Harriet Minerva Foote, of Greene County, New York and the couple had many children before her death in St. Louis, Missouri in 1899 during one of her husband's missionary journeys. ==Career== He was ordained deacon by year's end and in 1863, he was ordained priest and assigned rural parishes. He learned he had been elected missionary bishop of the territory of Montana, with additional jurisdiction over Utah and Idaho. Presiding Bishop John Henry Hopkins of Vermont, along with Bishops Horatio Potter of New York and William Henry Odenheimer of New Jersey consecrated their young colleague. Since Tuttle was only 29, canon law required him to wait until he was 30 before he could exercise his office. He took the Union Pacific Railroad as far west as then possible, to North Platte, Nebraska, then boarded a stage coach for Denver, Colorado and arrived on June 11, 1867. He eventually established his home base in Salt Lake City, but traveled widely, by railroad and other means. In 1880 Montana was removed from his mission, leaving him with Utah and Idaho. In 1886 the General Convention added territory in Nevada, since the missionary bishop of Nevada and Arizona, Ozi William Whitaker, had translated and become bishop of Pennsylvania. Instead, Tuttle accepted a call to serve as bishop of Missouri although he had rejected a similar offer in 1868. During Tuttle's residency in Salt Lake City, he oversaw the construction of St. Mark's Cathedral, the first non-Mormon religious building in Utah, followed by the establishment of St. Mark's School for boys and girls in 1867, St. Mark's Hospital in 1872, and Rowland Hall school for girls in 1881. On May 26, 1886, Bishop Tuttle was elected Bishop of the Diocese of Missouri. According to his own published remembrances, he became the Bishop of Missouri when on the morning of August 9, 1886, he read the letter notifying him of his election to that See. \\"When I took the letter in hand to read, I was Bishop of Utah, and after I had read it, as I understood the matter, I was [translated as] Bishop of Missouri.\\" (Missionary to the Mountain West: Reminiscences of Episcopal Bishop Daniel S. Tuttle, 1866-1886. \\"Second Call to Missouri, 1886\\", Daniel Sylvester Tuttle, University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, 1906, p. 480.) Bishop Tuttle served in that position in the Diocese of Missouri until his death. From 1903 to 1923, Tuttle also served as Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. The presiding bishop, at the time of Tuttle's consecration, was the senior bishop in order of consecration, and Tuttle ended up serving as bishop for 56 years and helped consecrate 89 bishops. During his tenure as Presiding Bishop, Tuttle preached at the closing service of the 1908 Lambeth Conference in St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral in London, England.Randall Thomas Davidson, The Five Lambeth Conferences (SPCKnowledge, 1920), 45. Tuttle wrote a memoir, called Reminiscences of a Missionary Bishop, published in 1906. His memoir has extensive first-person accounts of his service among the Mormons in Salt Lake City, including his meetings and other dealings with Brigham Young and other local leaders. ==Death== He died on April 17, 1923, and was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.Notable Episcopalians at Bellefontaine Cemetery ==See also== * List of presiding bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America * List of Episcopal bishops of the United States * Historical list of the Episcopal bishops of the United States *Episcopal Diocese of Idaho *Episcopal Diocese of Montana *Episcopal Diocese of Missouri *Episcopal Diocese of Utah ==ReferencesFurther reading== * .

When Kansas City was incorporated on March 18, 1853, it had an area and a population of 2,500. 63 votes were cast for mayor and Gregory defeated Dr. Benoist Troost by nine votes. He was born in Shelby County, Kentucky. Gregory moved with his wife Elizabeth to Jackson County, Missouri in 1844 from Kentucky and operated a grocery store on the levee. He and other settlers petitioned to incorporate the Town of Kansas. Gregory only served 10 months when it was discovered that he lived on a farm that was outside the city limits eastern boundary at Locust Street. Therefore, he was not eligible to be mayor. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery.

It is considered the only desert in Bulgaria and one of few found in Europe. The desert consists of sand dunes and several groups of natural rock formations on a total area of 13 km¬≤. The formations are mainly stone columns between 5 and 7 meters high and from 0.3 to 3 meters thick. The columns do not have solid foundations, but are instead hollow and filled with sand, and look as if they were stuck into the surrounding sand, which gives the phenomenon its name. Sandstorms and sand twisters have also been known to commonly occur in this desert region of Bulgaria. The Stone Desert is not only a well known European tourist attraction due to its desert like habitat, but it is one of few places where desert type vegetation such as cactus are known to grow. It is also the only desert in Europe in which desert reptilians and other desert type animalia are found to thrive. The Stone Desert along with the Tabernas Desert of Spain is one of two naturally formed deserts in all of Europe and the only known naturally formed desert in Eastern Europe. In order to be preserved, Pobiti Kamani (The Stone Desert) was designated a natural landmark in the late 1930s. There are a number of theories regarding the phenomenon's origin. The pioneering hypothesis can be divided roughly into two groups: suggesting an organic or abiotic origin. According to the former, the formations are the result of coral activity (but detail investigation shows no coral), while the latter explain the phenomenon with the prismatic weathering and desertification of the rocks, the formation of sand and limestone concretions, or lower Eocene bubbling reefs. Based on a petrographic and stable isotope geochemical study and field observations, evidence exists that these structures represent an exceptionally record of paleo-hydrocarbon seep system (low magnesium calcite cements are strongly depleted in heavy carbon isotope 13C). The pathways of fluid circulation are recorded as columns set in sands, which columns after recent sand removal gave desert-like landscape. The dynamic reconstruction of the origin of these structures, the processes of fluid migration and microbial mediation of hydrocarbon oxidation leading to carbonate precipitation have been studied by De Boever et al. (2009). ==Gallery== Bosque de Piedra, provincia de Varna, Bulgaria, 2016-05-27, DD 76.jpg Bosque de Piedra, provincia de Varna, Bulgaria, 2016-05-27, DD 81.jpg Bosque de Piedra, provincia de Varna, Bulgaria, 2016-05-27, DD 83.jpg Bosque de Piedra, provincia de Varna, Bulgaria, 2016-05-27, DD 85.jpg Bosque de Piedra, provincia de Varna, Bulgaria, 2016-05-27, DD 99.jpg ==References== * * de Boever E., Birgel D., Thiel V., Muchez P., Peckmann J., Dimitrov L., Swennen R. 2009.

Myokyo-ni (born Irmgard Schl√∂gl; 29 January 1921 - 29 March 2007) was a Rinzai Zen Buddhist nun and head of the Zen Centre in London. ==Biography== Raised in Leitersdorf im Raabtal, Styria, Austria, she obtained a Ph.D. degree in Geology from Graz University before joining the Zen Group at the Buddhist Society under Christmas Humphreys in 1950. In 1960 she went to Japan and trained at Daitoku-ji monastery for six years under Oda Sesso R≈çshi and, after his death, for a further six years under his successor Sojun Kannon R≈çshi. In 1966, following the death of Oda Sesso Roshi, she returned to England for nine months, during which time she started a small Zazen Group at the Buddhist Society which continued until she returned permanently in 1972. With the introduction of another Zazen class, and then a beginners' class, running alongside Christmas Humphreys' original Zen Class, the Zen Group grew in size until the Zen Centre was formally established in 1979. During this period she was living at the home of Christmas Humphreys whom she referred to affectionately as 'father'. On his death in 1983, his residence was bequeathed to the Zen Centre becoming Shobo-an, Hermitage of the True Dharma, a residential training temple. In 1984, S≈çk≈ç Morinaga R≈çshi, who had been head monk at Daitoku-ji during her time there, visited England with a retinue of seven monks, the requisite number to ordain her as both nun and teacher and to inaugurate Shobo-an. The ordination took place at Chithurst Forest Monastery on 22 July at the invitation of the Abbot Ajahn Sumedho. S≈çk≈ç Morinaga R≈çshi gave her the name Myokyo-ni, which was the name he had given her as a Zen student in Japan. The name is from Myokyo meaning 'mirror of the subtle' and ni meaning 'nun'. Myokyo-ni is the author of a number of books on Zen and Buddhism, including a translation of The Zen Teaching of Rinzai (Linji). She guided the translation of the Discourse on the Inexhaustible Lamp by Master T≈çrei Enji, which was awarded the Culture Prize by the Japanese Translators' Association in 1991. From 2002 until her death in 2007, Ven. Myokyo-ni lived at Fairlight (Luton), one of the Zen Centre's two training temples, where she received students and gave regular teisho (Zen talks). Fairlight was founded and inaugurated as a Zen Buddhist temple by Myokyo-ni on 8 April 1996. Both temples continue to run under her disciples, providing meditation classes, holding regular sessions and offering residential facilities for Zen Centre members. Fairlight is now run by the Venerable Sogen, with the assistance of Ven. Myosui and Shobo-an in St John's Wood, London is run by Ven. Myokun. Ven. Sogen was ordained on 18 July 1998 and Ven. Myosui and Ven. Myokun on 26 June 2004. Daiyu (meaning 'Great Oak') was added to Ven. Myokyo-ni's name posthumously so that she is now formally known as Daiyu Myokyo Zenji. ==Bibliography== *Wisdom of the Zen Masters (1976) (under her pre-ordination name Irmgard Schl√∂gl) *The Zen Way (1977) *Introducing Buddhism (1978) *Gentling the Bull: The Ten Bull Pictures, a Spiritual Journey (1980) *Living Buddhism (2000) *The Daily Devotional Chants of the Zen Centre (2008) ===Translation and editing=== * The Record of Rinzai (1976) (under her pre- ordination name Irmgard Schl√∂gl) * The Ceasing of Notions (1988) (with S≈çk≈ç Morinaga R≈çshi and Michelle Bromley) * The Bull and his Herdsman (1989) by Daizokutsu R Otsu (from the German Der Ochs und sein Hirte by Tsujumura and Buchner) * The Discourse on The Inexhaustible Lamp of the Zen School (1989) (also translated by Yoko Okuda) ===Other writings=== * Introduction for Thomas Merton on Zen (1976).

He is known for his research in using supernovae as cosmological probes. He currently holds an Australia Research Council Federation Fellowship and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2012. Schmidt shared both the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics with Saul Perlmutter and Adam Riess for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, making him the only Montana-born Nobel laureate. ==Early life and education== Interview with Brian Schmidt after his Nobel lecture Schmidt, an only child, was born on 24 February 1967, in Missoula, Montana, where his father Dana C. Schmidt was a fisheries biologist. When he was 13, his family relocated to Anchorage, Alaska.Restless experimenter The Canberra Times, 6 April 2011, p 8.\\"FACTBOX- Nobel physics prize winners\\", Reuters News, 4 October 2011. Schmidt attended Bartlett High School in Anchorage, Alaska, and graduated in 1985. He has said that he wanted to be a meteorologist \\"since I was about five-years-old [but] ... I did some work at the USA National Weather Service up in Anchorage and didn't enjoy it very much. It was less scientific, not as exciting as I thought it would be‚Äîthere was a lot of routine. But I guess I was just a little naive about what being a meteorologist meant.\\" His decision to study astronomy, which he had seen as \\"a minor pastime\\", was made just before he enrolled at university.\\"Star turn in global success\\", The Canberra Times, 1 July 2006, p B02. Even then, he was not fully committed: he said \\"I'll do astronomy and change into something else later\\", and just never made that change. He graduated with a BS (Physics) and BS (Astronomy) from the University of Arizona in 1989.\\"SCHMIDT, Brian\\" in Who's Who Live (Australia), Crown Content Pty Ltd. Retrieved 4 October 2011. He received his AM (Astronomy) in 1992 and then PhD (Astronomy) in 1993 from Harvard University.The Universe from Beginning to End, Pollock Memorial Lecture, April 2009, The University of Sydney. Retrieved 5 October 2011. Schmidt's PhD thesis was supervised by Robert Kirshner and used Type II Supernovae to measure the Hubble Constant. While at Harvard, he met his future wife, the Australian (Jenny) Jennifer M. Gordon who was a PhD student in economics. In 1994, they moved to Australia. ==Research and career== Schmidt was a postdoctoral research Fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (1993‚Äì1994) before moving on to the ANU's Mount Stromlo Observatory in 1995. In 1994, Schmidt and Nicholas B. Suntzeff formed the High-Z Supernova Search Team to measure the expected deceleration of the universe and the deceleration parameter (q0) using distances to Type Ia supernovae. In 1995, the HZT at a meeting at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics elected Schmidt as the overall leader of the HZT. Schmidt led the team from Australia and in 1998 in the HZT paper with first author Adam Riess the first evidence was presented that the universe's expansion rate is not decelerating; it is accelerating.Cosmology ABC Catalyst segment on Cosmology, with Brian Schmidt, Ray Norris, & Lawrence Krauss The team's observations were contrary to the then-current models, which predicted that the expansion of the universe should be slowing down, and when the preliminary results emerged Schmidt assumed it was an error and he spent the next six weeks trying to find the mistake. But there was no mistake: contrary to expectations, by monitoring the brightness and measuring the redshift of the supernovae, they discovered that these billion-year old exploding stars and their galaxies were accelerating away from our reference frame. This result was also found nearly simultaneously by the Supernova Cosmology Project, led by Saul Perlmutter. The corroborating evidence between the two competing studies led to the acceptance of the accelerating universe theory and initiated new research to understand the nature of the universe, such as the existence of dark energy. The discovery of the accelerating universe was named 'Breakthrough of the Year' by Science in 1998, and Schmidt was jointly awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Riess and Perlmutter for their groundbreaking work. Schmidt is currently leading the SkyMapper telescope Project and the associated Southern Sky Survey, which will encompass billions of individual objects, enabling the team to pick out the most unusual objects. In 2014 they announced the discovery of the first star which did not contain any iron, indicating that it is a very primitive star, probably formed during the first rush of star formation following the Big Bang. He is the chairman of the board of directors of Astronomy Australia Limited, and he serves on the management committee of the ARC Centre of Excellence for All-Sky Astrophysics (CAASTRO). In July 2012 Schmidt was given a three-year appointment to sit on the Questacon Advisory Council. As of March 2017, Schmidt serves as a member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Board of Sponsors. ===ANU Vice-Chancellor=== On 24 June 2015 it was announced Schmidt would replace Ian Young as the 12th Vice- Chancellor of the Australian National University, to commence his tenure on 1 January 2016. The Chancellor of the ANU, Professor Gareth Evans, said, \\"Brian Schmidt is superbly placed to deliver on the ambition of ANU foundersto permanently secure our position among the great universities of the world, and as a crucial contributor to the nation ... We had a stellar field of international and Australian candidates, and have chosen an inspirational leader. ... Brian's vision, vitality, global stature and communication skills are going to take our national university to places it has never been before.\\"Physics Nobel laureate Brian Schmidt named new Australian National University vice-chancellor, ABC News Online, 24 June 2015 ===Science advocacy=== The publicity that came with winning the Nobel Prize has given Schmidt the opportunity to help the public understand why science is important to society, and to champion associated causes. ;Public education :One of his first acts after winning the Nobel Prize was to donate $100,000 out of his prize money to the PrimaryConnections program, an initiative of the Australian Academy of Science that assists primary school teachers. He has continued to press for improvements to the public school system, particularly in the sciences and mathematical literacy (numeracy). He sees the major problem is that so few of the teachers are trained in \\"STEM\\" (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines. He used the opportunity of delivering a speech at the National Press Club to call for more focus on the public education system, including holding principals more accountable and the proper use of standardised testing, concluding with the warning that otherwise \\"the fundamental tenet of Australian democracy, that we all deserve a fair go, is at risk of being eroded away along with our public school system.\\" At the other end of the spectrum, he also raises the profile of the matter by visiting primary schools personally to answer children's questions. ; Funding for scientific and medical research : Schmidt is a strong supporter of funding scientific and medical research on a long-term, non-partisan basis driven by a national research strategy. He has often voiced his concern that the current year-to-year uncertainty and lack of co-ordination make it difficult to establish and staff large facilities, or to participate in multi-national ventures, and that scientists spend too much time applying for funding instead of doing research. Interviewed by the Australian Financial Review, Schmidt was characteristically forthright: \\"It's unclear to me whether or not we will continue to be a great astronomy nation... If we're damaged it will take 20 years to fix ourselves. It only takes one year to cause 20 years of damage.\\", cited in ; Climate change : He urges people to pay attention to the consensus of expert opinions, instead of basing their conclusions on the incomplete information which they personally know. Launching the Australian Academy of Science's report \\"The science of climate change: questions and answers\\", Schmidt commented that \\"Whenever this subject comes up, it never ceases to amaze me how each person I meet suddenly becomes an expert... More surprising is the supreme confidence that non-experts (scientists and non-scientists alike) have in their own understanding of the subject.\\" He even put up $10,000 of his own money in a bet with Maurice Newman, who is the chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Council, that global temperatures will rise. In 2015, he presented the Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting, which was signed by 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then President of the French Republic, Fran√ßois Hollande, as part of the successful COP21 climate summit in Paris. ==Awards and honours== Saul Perlmutter, Adam Riess, and Brian Schmidt being awarded the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy. The trio would later be awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Schmidt has received the Australian Government's inaugural Malcolm McIntosh Prize for achievement in the Physical Sciences in 2000, Harvard University's Bok Prize in 2000, the Australian Academy of Science's Pawsey Medal Medal in 2001, and the Astronomical Society of India's Vainu Bappu Medal in 2002. He was the Marc Aaronson Memorial Lecturer in 2005, the same year he received an ARC Federation Fellowship, and in 2006 he shared the Shaw Prize in Astronomy with Adam Riess and Saul Perlmutter. In 2009, he was awarded an Australian Laureate Fellowship. Schmidt and the other members of the High-Z Team (the set defined by the co-authors of Riess et al. 1998) shared the 2007 Gruber Cosmology Prize, a $500,000 award, with Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Supernova Cosmology Project (the set defined by the co-authors of Perlmutter et al. 1999) for their discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe. Schmidt, along with Riess and Perlmutter, jointly won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for their observations which led to the discovery of the accelerating universe. Schmidt was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in the 2013 Australia Day Honours. He was called \\"Australian of the Year\\" for 2011 by The Australian newspaper. He is a Fellow and council member of the Australian Academy of Science, The United States National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society, and Foreign Member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences. Schmidt, Adam Riess, and the High-Z Supernova Search Team shared in the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. Schmidt was awarded the Dirac Medal in 2012 and the Niels Bohr Institute Medal of Honour in 2015.Brian Schmidt receives the Niels Bohr Institute Medal of Honour, 2015, Niels Bohr Institute, 29 January 2016 He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2012; his certificate of election to the Royal Society reads: == Personal life == Schmidt is married to Jennifer Gordon. They met while they were both studying for their PhDs at Harvardhe in astrophysics and she in economics. They decided to settle in Australia, which he had already visited on several occasions to visit family. He now holds dual citizenship of Australia and the United States. He is not religious, being described as a \\"militant agnostic\\" with his tagline, \\"I don't know, and neither do you!\\" ===Vineyard and winery=== Schmidt and his wife own and operate Maipenrai Vineyard and Winery, a small winery established in 2000 in Sutton, near Canberra. The vineyard covers , producing exclusively pinot noir grapes, and the wines have received favourable reviews. Schmidt has quipped that \\"it's easier to sell your wine when you have a Nobel prize\\". At the 2011 Nobel Prize Ceremonies in Stockholm, he presented the King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden with a bottle of wine from his winery. In 2013, Schmidt was appointed to join the board of the federal government's Australian Wine Research Institute. The Institute's chairman Peter Dawson commented that Schmidt brings to the board \\"a unique combination of scientific excellence, wine industry knowledge and relevant board experience\\". ==See also== *List of celebrities who own wineries and vineyards ==References External links == * Category:1967 births Category:21st-century American scientists Category:21st-century astronomers Category:21st-century Australian scientists Category:American cosmologists Category:American emigrants to Australia Category:American Nobel laureates Category:American people of German descent Category:Australian National University faculty Category:Australian Nobel laureates Category:Australian people of German descent Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Nobel laureates in Physics Category:Recipients of grants or fellowships from the Australian Research Council Category:University of Arizona alumni Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Vice- Chancellors of the Australian National University Category:American agnostics Category:Australian agnostics ","title":"Brian Schmidt"},{"id":"6231369","text":"Mariano Vel√°zquez (June 28, 1778 ‚Äì February 19, 1860), (full name Mariano Vel√°zquez de la Cadena) was an accomplished Mexican grammarian, scholar, and author in the 19th century. He was appointed Professor of Spanish Language and Literature at Columbia College in 1830, a position that he held until his death in 1861. ==Early life== Velazquez was born in Mexico City, a descendant of Don Antonio De La Cadena Maluenda (Anusim), Treasurer of New Spain 1525. At age seven, he was sent away to Madrid to pursue his education. In Madrid, he was admitted to the Royal Seminary of Nobles, where he studied philosophy and law until he graduated in 1799. ==Public service== Although not of legal age, Vel√°zquez was admitted, by special royal order, to the Council of the Indies in 1800. He held the position of notary while serving the council and was also appointed curator of the estates of minors and interstate estates for the viceroyalty of Mexico. In 1802, he was recalled from the council to become King Charles IV's private secretary. As such, he was sent to represent the king at the 1804 coronation of Napoleon. His position allowed him to make a tour through western and central Europe. Vel√°zquez resigned his post after Charles IV was forced to abdicate and later imprisoned by Napoleon in 1809. After receiving news of Hidalgo's Mexican independence movement, he made arrangements to return to Mexico. Velazquez was unwilling to identify with either of the contending parties and thus resolved to settle in New York, where his scholarly career began. ==Language Contributions== Once in New York City, Velazquez devoted himself to one of his greatest passions‚Äîlanguage. He taught Spanish and founded a collegiate institute where many young Latin American men were educated. Vel√°zquez also joined the faculty of Columbia University to teach Castilian (Spanish) language and literature. Aside from teaching, he was a member of learned societies in Europe and the United States and author of Spanish school-books and Spanish-English language dictionaries. Some of his English, Spanish, and German works include: Dufief's, Ellendorff's New Method, An Easy Introduction to Spanish Conversation, New Spanish Reader, A New Method of Learning to Read, Write, and Speak the Spanish Language, Elementos de la lengua castellana fundados en los principios establecidos por la academia espa√±ola y en el uso de los autores cl√°sicos, and Spanisches Lesebuch: Enthaltend ausgew√§hlte St√ºcke aus Spanischen Musterschriftststellern in gebundener und ungebundener Rede. ==Legacy== In 1852, Vel√°zquez used Dr. Don Mateo Seoane's edition of the revered Neumon and Baretti Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages as a basis for his version, A Pronouncing Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages. Vel√°zquez's dictionary became the preeminent authority in Spanish-English dictionaries, giving editors and publishers the model for Spanish-English dictionaries. Edward Gray revised the first edition, creating A New Pronouncing Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages almost a half century later. Several revisions have been made to Velazquez's first edition, the most recent by Vel√°zquez Press in 2003, helping it remain a venerable dictionary throughout the world. ==References * Vel√°zquez Spanish-English Dictionary - Vel√°zquez Press * A new pronouncing dictionary of the Spanish and English languages (1900) - Archive.Org * A New Spanish Reader ...

A couple meet and move in together, but the woman cannot get used to his life, his working-class existence. She leaves her lover to return to her affair with a man of means. Ostensibly, she is rejecting her lover because she feels stifled by his position in society. But the class differences are metaphor for the quality of the love, with a woman deciding to be with a man who loves her for who she is rather than as an object of affection, merely the focus of a selfish love. She wants to be with the one who doesn't ask her to change. ==References== * Category:1965 French novels Category:French novels adapted into films Category:E. P.

This is the second public railway station whose construction was entirely funded by a private enterprise (the first being HaMifrats Central station). The station replaced the temporary Kishon station that existed for several years some 700 meters to the north. The station consists of two side platforms with two parallel rail tracks running between them, a pedestrian tunnel connecting the two platforms and a station hall on the eastern side.

They have gone through extensive line-up changes throughout their history with only guitarist and sometime-vocalist Lou St. Paul featuring as an ever-present. In their first incarnation with Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens (who would later join Judas Priest and Iced Earth), they released the Heart of a Killer album in 1993, a concept piece based on the murderous exploits of a character called Judge Cohagen. This album was re-released in 2000 by Century Media Records as a 2-CD set, featuring a bootlegged live gig as a bonus disc. After the departure of Owens, St. Paul took over the vocal duties for both the unreleased Season of Brutality and Girth, arguably Winters Bane's heaviest work to date. Following the release of Girth, Winters Bane went into a period of semi-activity while searching for a full-time vocalist. By 2003, German Alexander Koch (ex-Spiral Tower, Powergod) was recruited and a demo was cut. Two years later St. Paul, Koch and veteran drummer Mark Cross entered the studio to record Redivivus, a full-length album released in 2006. After the release of the album, Koch and Cross were replaced by locally based Jeff Zaigen and former touring drummer Jeff Curenton and there are plans for a sequel to Heart of a Killer to be released in 2007. Former members Tim Owens and Dennis Hayes would later form their own band, Beyond Fear, and they released their debut album in 2006. The next year, Hayes would also join Owens in Iced Earth as their new bassist. As early as December 2007, it was rumored that due to Matt Barlow's reunion with Iced Earth (thus the booting of Tim Owens), Tim Owens would return to Winters Bane as its vocalist.

He designed the logo for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ==Early life and education== Michael Bierut was born in 1957 in Cleveland, Ohio. His family lived in Garfield Heights and he attended Saturday morning classes at the Cleveland Museum of Art where he developed his drawing skills. The family moved to the suburb Parma in 1967 and he attended Normandy High School, graduating in 1975. In the ninth grade, Bierut created his first poster for a school play and wanted to create things with purpose. He also enjoyed album cover art and discovered the book Graphic Design Manual by Armin Hofmann and Milton Glaser: Graphic Design. He studied graphic design at the University of Cincinnati's College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning (DAAP) as a result of these influences. While in school, he interned for Chris Pullman, an AIGA medalist, at a Boston public television station, WGBH. Michael Bierut graduated in 1980 from DAAP with a bachelors of science in graphic design and moved to New York City to work for Massimo Vignelli. == Career Vignelli=== After graduation, Bierut began working for Vignelli Associates in New York. The studio at that time didn't have a computer or fax machine and Bierut was responsible for hand creating mechanical boards. He credits his youthful exuberance in staying up late for the progress he made as a designer while working for Vignelli. He also learned that people don't always read a company's printed materials and strives to create engaging work that people want to read. He worked at the studio for 10 years, eventually becoming vice president. ===Pentagram=== In 1990, Bierut became a partner in the New York office of Pentagram after a discussion with partner Woody Pirtle. At Pentagram, he has championed the democratization of design to make his design work easily digestable to the viewer. At Pentagram, Bierut has had numerous clients such as Alliance for Downtown New York, Benetton, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Alfred A. Knopf, the Walt Disney Company, Mohawk Paper Mills, Motorola, MillerCoors, the Toy Industry Association, Princeton University, Yale School of Architecture, New York University, the Fashion Institute of Technology, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Sex, and the New York Jets. Michael Bierut has done projects like I Want To Take You Higher, an exhibition on the psychedelic era for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and has served as a design consultant to United Airlines. In 2006, he developed a new signage and identity for the expanded Morgan Library Museum. He has also developed the environmental graphics for the New York Times building, designed for Phillip Johnson's Glass House, and redesigned the magazine The Atlantic. Along with that, he has created marketing strategies for William Jefferson Clinton Foundation and developed a new brand strategy and packaging for Saks Fifth Avenue.Pentagram Profile Prior to the 2016 Presidential election, he worked with two Pentagram designers to create the logo for Hillary Clinton's campaign, emphasizing its simplicity and boldness to make it memorable. Upon the release of the design, many designers, journalists, and constituents were critical of it but as the campaign released its customizable aspects it was better received, like after the landmark LGBT civil rights case Obergefell v. Hodges it was swathed in rainbow colors. He later recommended former student Jennifer Kinon as the campaign's design director. === Design commentary === In 1993, he became a lecturer in graphic design at the Yale School of Art and was later appointed senior critic. In 2016, he joined the Yale School of Management to integrate design thinking into the program. In 2003, Bierut co-founded Design Observer with Jessica Helfand, Rick Poynor, and William Drenttel, an online publication featuring news, features, and essays on design, urbanism, innovation and pop culture. His influence extends beyond design circles and his commentary can be found on public radio, appearing on ‚ÄúStudio 360‚Äù with Kurt Andersen. Dwell also works with him for design book recommendations and Fast Company asks for his opinions on corporate branding, and he writes articles on design for the New York Times. Bierut also has a long-running history with Design Indaba where he spoke at 2005, 2010 and 2015 conference. ==Awards and achievements== Bierut's work is in permanent collections in around the world the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York; the Library of Congress in Washington, DC; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA); the Denver Art Museum; the Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, Germany; and the Museum of Design, Z√ºrich, Switzerland.\\" From 1988 to 1990 Michael Bierut served as president of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) and was president of AIGA National from 1998 to 2001.

Population 1,192 (2011). It is located just north of the Mani Peninsula on the eastern slopes of Mt. Taygetos, and it is named after the river Smynos, that runs through it. The region is known as Vardounia (and its villages as Vardounochoria), after the medieval Vardounia castle located in the area, now in ruins. Historically, Vardounia was a buffer zone between the Ottoman-Turkish controlled Evrotas plains and the Mani Peninsula. A contingent of Muslim Albanian settlers were relocated to the region by the Ottomans. These settlers formed a large segment of the local population until the Greek War of Independence when they fled to the Turkish stronghold at Tripoli. The seat of the municipality was in Agios Nikolaos. The most historic village of the municipal unit of Sminos is the mountainous village of Kastania. It has two towers (), in which its inhabitants used to defend themselves. The village has two coffee shops and attracts tourists in the summer. The largest village in the municipality is Petrina, known for its PDO olive oil. The most prominent site in the municipal unit is the Monastery of Panagia Giatrissa which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists and worshipers every year. The Monastery sits on the path of the European walking route E4. Other sites of interest include the Vasilitsa forest (also on the path of the European walking route E4), and the network of canyons formed by river Smynos and its tributaries.

During those years it became the main cultural hotspot of Salento, seat of many Universities, Academies, literary and philosophical studies: it was given the name of Nuoua Atene litterarum. With almost 32.000 inhabitants and 190 squared kilometres of land, it is the second largest and most populated city among those in the Province, right after Lecce, and also one of the most culturally active towns of Salento. The Old Town is particularly rich with palaces, churches, chapels and other architectural details shaped accordingly to the principles of Lecce's Baroque style. Indeed, the city is a significant example of this art movement along with Gallipoli and Lecce.

The company began in 1973 as a division of General Electric. ==History== Genigraphics began as a computer graphics system, developed by General Electric in the late 1960s, for NASA to use in space flight simulation. The technologies thus developed provided a foundation for the company's expansion into the commercial market. The Computed Images System & Services division (CISS, to become Genigraphics Corporation) of GE delivered the first presentation graphics system to Amoco Oil's corporate headquarters in 1973. It was named the 100 Series, and was based on DEC's PDP 11 series of mini computer systems. The first Genigraphics systems (100 Series and 100A Series) used an array of buttons, dials, knobs and joysticks, along with a built in keyboard, as the means of user interface. The PDP-11/40 computer was housed in a tall cabinet and used random access magnetic tape drives (DECtape) for storing completed presentations. The graphics generator (Forox recorder) was capable of outputting 2,000 line resolution, suitable for 35mm and 72mm film and large sheet film positive using larger cassettes for recording. 4000 and 8000 line resolution was later achieved with duplex scanning and 4x scanning by modifying to the Forox recorder's settings menu. Subsequent models (100B,C,D,D+ and D+/GVP) replaced the knobs and dials with an on screen, text based menu system, a graphics tablet and a pen. The pen/tablet combination gave way to a mouse like device in later models, and served to provide the interface with the graphics tools. User interaction with the computer for functions such as media initialization or modem to modem data transfer required a DECwriter serial terminal. In 1982, GE divested the Genigraphics division along with a host of other \\"non essential\\" business units (Genitext, Geniponics) and Genigraphics Corporation was born. Shortly after the divestiture, the headquarters of Genigraphics was moved from Liverpool, New York to Saddle Brook, New Jersey. Major success followed as the company grew exponentially over the next few years selling both systems and slide creation services. Genigraphics film recorders produced high-resolution digital images on 35mm film. The computer-generated scenes for The Last Starfighter were calculated on a Cray X-MP supercomputer and mastered with a Genigraphics film recorder. At its peak, Genigraphics Corporation employed roughly 300 people in 24 offices worldwide, with revenues upwards of $70 million annually. By the late 1980s Genigraphics saw demand for its proprietary systems dwindle and began selling the MASTERPIECE 8770 film recorder and GRAFTIME software as a peripheral for DEC Vaxes, IBM PC AT‚Äôs, and Mac NuBus machines. But the MASTERPIECE film recorder proved too expensive to sell in volume. In 1988, the company began a partnership with Microsoft to help develop the PowerPoint software. In exchange, every copy of PowerPoint included a ‚ÄúSend to Genigraphics‚Äù link to have files sent to a Genigraphics service bureau to be produced as 35mm slides. This partnership continued until 2001. In 1989, after three years of flat revenue, Genigraphics sold its hardware business in order to focus on its service bureau business and partnership with Microsoft via PowerPoint. In 1994, all assets of Genigraphics, including equipment, software development, in-house artwork, trademarks, and rights to the Microsoft partnership, were sold to InFocus Corporation of Wilsonville, Oregon who continued to operate under the Genigraphics brand name. The twenty-four service bureaus were consolidated to a 20,000 square foot facility next to the FedEx hub in Memphis, Tennessee. This allowed PowerPoint slide orders to be received until 10pm and delivered across the United States by the following morning. In 1995, InFocus registered www.genigraphics.com and was among the first to offer a form of ecommerce allowing 35mm slides, color prints and transparencies, printed booklets, and digital projectors to be purchased online. In 1998, then current management bought Genigraphics from InFocus and have operated it continuously ever since as Genigraphics LLC. That same year, InFocus projector rentals were added to the ‚ÄúSend to Genigraphics‚Äù link in PowerPoint and Genigraphics became the rental and repair center for all InFocus national accounts. It also marked Genigraphics entry into the new industry of large format printing; leveraging their knowledge of, and access to, PowerPoint programming code to develop a proprietary printer driver to output directly to an Epson 9500 wide format printer. At the time, Genigraphics was the exclusive 35mm slide vendor for all Kinko‚Äôs stores in the United States and poster printing was added to the arrangement. In 2003, Genigraphics closed their 35mm slide E6 photo lab ‚Äì one of the last high-volume commercial E6 labs in the US ‚Äì and expanded their large format printing capabilities. Since 2003, Genigraphics has become a major player in the poster session market, providing printing and on-site services to medical and scientific conferences throughout the US and Canada. As of February 2019, over 150,000 medical or scientific ‚ÄòePosters‚Äô are made available through their ResearchPosters.com archive service. === Partnership with Microsoft and development of PowerPoint === As presentations began to be created on personal computers in the late 80‚Äôs, Genigraphics sought presentation software partners in Silicon Valley who would be interested in sending files to Genigraphics via dial-up modem to be produced on 35mm slides. In 1987, Michael Beetner, Director of Marketing Planning for Genigraphics, met with Robert Gaskins, head of Microsoft's Graphics Business Unit, who was leading the development of the newly released PowerPoint software. A joint development agreement between Microsoft and Genigraphics was agreed upon and announced at Mac World 1988. According to Erica Robles-Anderson and Patrik Svensson, \\"It would be hard to overestimate Genigraphics‚Äô influence on PowerPoint. PowerPoint 2.0 was designed for Genigraphics film recorders. It shipped with Genigraphics color palettes, schemes, and the distinctively Genigraphics color-gradient backgrounds. The application contained a ‚ÄòSend to Genigraphics‚Äô menu item that wrote the presentation to floppy disk or transmitted the order directly via modem. Within three and a half months PowerPoint orders accounted for ten percent of revenue at Genigraphics service centers. PowerPoint 3.0 was even more intimately dependent upon Genigraphics. The software incorporated a collection of clip art images and symbols that had been produced by hundreds of artists at dozens of service centers across tens of thousands of presentations. Genigraphics artists designed PowerPoint 3.0 colors, templates, and sample presentations. The software even used Genigraphics (rather than Excel) chart style. Bar charts were rendered two- dimensionally with apparent thickness added to make them seemingly recede from the axes. The technique made it easier for viewers to compare bar heights and estimate values from axis ticks and labels. Pie charts were handled analogously. Microsoft paid Genigraphics to produce more than 500 clip art drawings and symbols used in Microsoft programs.‚Äù In exchange for Genigraphics development efforts, Microsoft included a ‚ÄúSend to Genigraphics‚Äù link in every copy of PowerPoint through the 10.0 version (2000/2001). The arrangement came to an end when Microsoft restructured as a result of anti-trust lawsuits. ==References *Official site Category:Computer graphics ","title":"Genigraphics"},{"id":"6231536","text":"\\"Cuttin' Capers\\" may refer to: *\\"Cuttin' Capers\\" (song), a popular tune written by Earl Burtnett, Gus Chandler, Bert White, and Henry Cohen in 1915 *Cuttin' Capers (album), a 1959 Doris Day album ","title":"Cuttin' Capers"},{"id":"6231538","text":"Cut the Crap is a rock album released in 1997 by Southern Rock band Jackyl and is their 3rd studio album. ==Track listing== Songs written by Jesse James Dupree unless noted. # \\"Dumb Ass Country Boy\\" ‚Äì 2:49 # \\"Locked and Loaded\\" (Dupree, Brian Johnson) #*features Brian Johnson of AC/DC on vocals ‚Äì 3:29 # \\"Open Up\\" (Dupree, Dion Murdock) ‚Äì 3:33 # \\"Misery Loves Company\\" (Dupree, John Hayes) ‚Äì 3:46 # \\"Lets Don't Go There\\" (Dupree, Hayes) ‚Äì 3:24 # \\"Cut the Crap\\" ‚Äì 2:04 # \\"Twice as Ugly\\" (Dupree, Jeff Worley) ‚Äì 4:09 # \\"God Strike Me Dead\\" ‚Äì 3:35 # \\"Thanks For the Grammy\\" ‚Äì 3:21 # \\"Speak of the Devil\\" ‚Äì 4:40 (Dupree, Dupree) # \\"Push Pull\\" ‚Äì 3:55 ==Personnel== *Jesse James Dupree - vocals *Jimmy Stiff - guitars *Jeff Worley - Guitars *Tom Bettini - Bass *Chris Worley - drums *Brian Johnson - vocals on \\"Locked & Loaded\\" *Tony Adams - Percussion *Produced, Engineered and Mixed by Mike Fraser ==References== Category:1997 albums Category:Jackyl albums Category:Epic Records albums ","title":"Cut the Crap (Jackyl album)"},{"id":"6231541","text":"Rolfs Hall (also known as the Horticulture Sciences Building) is an historic building on the campus of the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, United States.

He played in the Football League for Cardiff City, Derby County and was player-manager of Shrewsbury Town. He managed Stoke City (two spells), Sunderland and Cardiff City. ==Club career== Durban was brought up in Bracken Road, Margam, Port Talbot. He began his career at Cardiff City, making his debut in a 2‚Äì1 win over Derby County in 1959. After initially making an impact on the team he fell out of favour and was transferred to Derby County for ¬£10,000 in July 1963 at the age of 22 having played over 50 times for Cardiff City. He made his Derby debut on 24 August 1963 in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Newcastle United and helped the side to thirteenth place in his first season and his partnership with the newly arrived Eddie Thomas saw the side begin to move up the table, finishing in 9th and 8th position in the following two years. After finishing in seventeenth place during the 1966‚Äì67 season Tim Ward was replaced as the Derby manager by Brian Clough. Under Clough, Durban was moved from Inside-forward to an attacking midfield role and was handed the captaincy for the first time in a 5‚Äì1 win over his former club Cardiff City. He won a Second Division title in 1968‚Äì69 and then a famous First Division championship medal with in 1971‚Äì72. He left Derby in 1973 after agreeing to become player-assistant manager of Shrewsbury Town after making 404 appearances for the \\"Rams\\" scoring 110 goals. He was appointed manager on 4 December 1973 following the dismissal of Maurice Evans, the man who had signed him three months earlier. With the \\"Shrews\\" he appointed former Derby teammate Richie Barker as his assistant and he helped Shrewsbury gain promotion in 1974‚Äì75 and consolidate their position in the Third Division. He retired from playing once he was made manager of Stoke City in February 1978. ==International career== Durban was handed his debut for Wales on 18 May 1966 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Brazil at the age of 24. He went on to make 27 appearances for Wales, his final appearance coming on 27 May 1972 in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Northern Ireland. ==Managerial career== He began his managerial career at Shrewsbury Town in February 1974; managing them until 1978 when he joined Stoke City, having won promotion from the Fourth Division and the Welsh Cup in 1977. He helped Stoke gain promotion back to the First Division in dramatic fashion beating Notts County 1‚Äì0 on the final day of the 1978‚Äì79. Stoke staved off a relegation battle in 1979‚Äì80 finishing in 18th position. During the 1980‚Äì81 season Stoke played out an awful 2‚Äì0 defeat away at Arsenal and a journalist told Durban that there was no entertainment watching his team's performance, to which Durban replied \\"If you want entertainment go and watch a bunch of clowns.\\" Stoke finished mid-table in 1980‚Äì81 and in the summer of 1981 he shocked Stoke by quitting in favour of becoming manager of Sunderland. One of main reasons he left was that Sunderland had offered to buy his house in Shrewsbury for the same price he bought it. At Roker Park, Durban inherited a struggling squad and relegation was avoided in the final match of the season 1981‚Äì82. He attempted to build a youthful team that would mature, introducing Ally McCoist, Nick Pickering, Barry Venison, and Colin West into the first team. However, he was hampered by a severe restriction of transfer funds. The following two seasons glimpsed promise of better things, but an FA Cup loss hastened boardroom discontent, and he was dismissed in March 1984.David Snowdon, Give Us Tomorrow Now: Alan Durban's Mission Impossible (2018) After leaving Sunderland he managed Willington in the Northern League for a short spell. Six months after leaving Sunderland, he joined Cardiff City, but his two-year spell in charge at Ninian Park turned into a disaster as they suffered consecutive relegations, falling from the Second Division to Fourth Division, and Durban was replaced by Frank Burrows. Several years later, Durban returned to Sunderland to become chief scout under Peter Reid. He then briefly returned to Stoke as caretaker for five games at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season but was unable to prevent Stoke's falling into the third tier. In summer 2010, he commenced part-time work as a regional scout for Championship side Norwich City. In July 2011 Durban re-joined Stoke City on a part-time basis as a mentor for young academy players needing guidance off the pitch. He retired at the age of 75. ==Personal life== A book written by David Snowdon about Durban's career was published in 2018 titled Give Us Tomorrow Now: Alan Durban's Mission Impossible, mainly detailing his time at Sunderland. ==Career statisticsClub=== Source: {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\"Cardiff City 1959‚Äì60 Second Division 5000000050 - 1960‚Äì61 First Division 4200000042 - 1961‚Äì62 First Division 201003000231 - 1962‚Äì63 Second Division 236102200268 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !52!!9!!1!!0!!5!!2!!0!!0!!58!!11 - rowspan=\\"11\\"Derby County 1963‚Äì64 Second Division 3490012003511 - 1964‚Äì65 Second Division 42221111004424 - 1965‚Äì66 Second Division 41171040004617 - 1966‚Äì67 Second Division 36101000003710 - 1967‚Äì68 Second Division 3990072004611 - 1968‚Äì69 Second Division 366117100448 - 1969‚Äì70 First Division 4194460005113 - 1970‚Äì71 First Division 282202030352 - 1971‚Äì72 First Division 3165410414111 - 1972‚Äì73 First Division 181402030271 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !346!!93!!19!!10!!29!!6!!10!!1!!404!!110 - rowspan=\\"6\\"Shrewsbury Town 1973‚Äì74 Third Division 359200000379 - 1974‚Äì75 Fourth Division 44112021004812 - 1975‚Äì76 Third Division 42103130004811 - 1976‚Äì77 Third Division 181102000211 - 1977‚Äì78 Third Division 172300000202 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !156!!33!!11!!1!!7!!1!!0!!0!!174!!35 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career Total !554!!135!!31!!11!!41!!9!!10!!1!!636!!156 } :A.

They can be classified into various kinds depending on their substrate preferences and subcellular localization. Membrane-bound 5'-nucleotidases display specificity toward adenosine monophosphates and are involved predominantly in the salvage of preformed nucleotides and in signal transduction cascades involving purinergic receptors. Soluble 5'-nucleotidases are all known to belong to the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of enzymes, which are two domain proteins characterised by a modified Rossman fold as the core and variable cap or hood. The soluble forms are further subclassified based on the criterion mentioned above. mdN and cdN are mitochondrial and cytosolic 5'-3'-pyrimidine nucleotidases. cN-I is a cytosolic nucleotidase(cN) characterized by its affinity toward AMP as its substrate. cN-II is identified by its affinity toward either IMP or GMP or both. cN-III is a pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase. A new class of nucleotidases called IMP-specific 5'-nucleotidase has been recently defined. 5'-Nucleotidases are involved in varied functions like cell‚Äìcell communication, nucleic acid repair, purine salvage pathway for the synthesis of nucleotides, signal transduction, membrane transport, etc. == References  Further reading == * ==External links== * Category:EC 3.1.3 Category:Chemical pathology ","title":"Nucleotidase"},{"id":"6231573","text":"A saffron crocus flower.

He sued his last two pharmaceutical employers, Wyeth and Pfizer, the latter of which fired him in 2005. At Wyeth, he uncovered tax evasion practices, and after informing senior company executives, was transferred from Sweden to a post in New Jersey. Rost sued the company, saying that the transfer was a retaliatory demotion, though the company said it was a promotion. Rost settled with Wyeth for an undisclosed amount in 2003. At Pfizer, Rost filed a qui tam suit disclosing off-label marketing of Genotropin at Pharmacia prior to its purchase by Pfizer. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to join in Rost's suit as the marketing violations had already been disclosed to the Department by Pfizer. Rost was eventually fired by Pfizer, and sued for wrongful dismissal, but this lawsuit was summarily dismissed by the court based on evidence that Pfizer had decided to fire Rost prior to discovery of his whistleblowing activities. Since then, Rost has worked outside the pharmaceutical industry, as a public speaker, blogger, writer, and litigation consultant. ==Biography== Rost worked at medical advertising agencies prior to working for pharmaceutical companies.Jim Edwards for BrandWeek.

Rost started working at Wyeth in approximately 1992; seven years after joining Wyeth, he was promoted to head of Wyeth-Lederle Nordiska, Wyeth's Scandinavian subsidiary. Rost has said that he doubled sales during his tenure. He became concerned about Wyeth's accounting practices and informed upper management of his concerns. Shortly thereafter, he was transferred from Sweden to New Jersey, a move he characterized as a retaliatory demotion. He filed a lawsuit against Wyeth, which was settled out of court for undisclosed terms.David Cay Johnson and Melody Petersen for the New York Times. January 17, 2003 \\"Whistle-Blower Accuses Wyeth Of Tax Dodges\\" Rost left Wyeth for Pharmacia in June 2001 and took a role leading its endocrinology division, and said that he soon began to be concerned from a business perspective about sales of Genotropin, Pfizer's human growth hormone drug, which had plateaued; Pharmacia's decision to pour money into off-label marketing to adults was not paying off, due to the low doses that adults took. In the next year, Rost became aware that the strategy was not only unwise, but was probably illegal, and began raising objections internally to try to get the company to change course. In July 2002 merger discussions with Pfizer were announced, and Rost and other executives briefed the Pfizer acquisition team on the issues with Genotropin as the merger talks progressed. However, when news broke in January 2013 of Rost's lawsuits against Wyeth (see below), things turned sour; Rost reported getting an email from his future Pfizer boss saying \\"There will not be a fit with the marketing organization\\" for him. The merger with Pfizer was completed in April 2003. Rost was offered a severance package, as other Pharmacia executives were, but Pfizer and Rost failed to come to agreement, and Pfizer did not fire him, as they were aware of the suit he filed against them related to Genotropin marketing (see below). His staff of 60 was slowly reassigned and by the end of summer 2003, he was left with his administrative assistant, who was reassigned in the summer of 2004, and his office was moved to an out of the way location.

Every day we delay, Americans die because they cannot afford life-saving drugs.\\" Pfizer responded by sending a letter to Congress that said, \\"Dr. Rost has no qualifications to speak on importation, no responsibilities in this area at Pfizer, no knowledge of the information and analysis Pfizer has provided to the government on this issue, and no substantive grasp of how importation may impact the safety of this nation's drug supply.\\"Robert Pear for the New York Times.

Rost filed an unlawful termination suit against Pfizer that was summarily dismissed. The court ruled that the evidence showed Pfizer had decided to fire Rost prior to learning of his whistleblowing activities. According to Pfizer, Rost's public criticism came only after he asked for and was denied a $10M severance package. Rost started blogging at The Huffington Post, but was banned in June 2006, after he got into a tiff with a heckler on his blog, who turned out to be on the Posts technical staff. Arianna Huffington said, \\"It seemed like his blog was becoming about personal grudges. That would have been no problem if the posts were interesting.\\"Maria Aspan for the New York Times. June 26, 2006 A Blogger Is Bounced From the Huffington Post In September 2006, Rost's book, The Whistleblower, Confessions of a Healthcare Hitman, was published, which described his tenure at Pharmacia and Pfizer and his efforts to deal with the marketing of Genotropin. In 2007, he published Killer Drug, a novel about a fictional drug company that develops a biological weapon for the military. In August 2007, Rost started to write a daily blog for BrandweekNRXBrandweekNRX August 2007 and a column for Realtid,Realtid.se a Swedish online business newspaper. Later in 2007, Rost announced his new business venture, as a Pharmaceutical Marketing Expert Witness.Rost's Litigation Consultant websitePeter Rost's personal blog Rost was featured in the award-winning documentary film Fire in the Blood in 2013.David Rooney for Hollywood Reporter. January 18, 2013 Fire in the Blood: Sundance Review ==Litigation== In January 2003, the New York Times published an article describing a whistleblowing lawsuit Rost had filed against Wyeth, claiming that Wyeth had practiced tax and compensation fraud worldwide, and describing Rost's separate lawsuit against Wyeth for removing him from heading a staff of 125 Wyeth-Lederle Nordiska to heading a group of eight people in New Jersey, which Rost described as a retaliatory demotion and Wyeth described as a promotion.Kirsty Barnes for In-Pharma Technogist. January 6, 2006 The Perils of Whistleblowing Later in 2003, Wyeth settled the whistleblowing lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. In June 2003, Rost filed a case under the False Claims Act (FCA) against Pfizer, claiming that Pharmacia defrauded the government by causing false claims to be filed, due to Pharmacia's illegal off-label marketing of Genotropin. The case was unsealed in November 2005, and the Department of Justice declined to intervene, leaving Rost to litigate on his own. Unbeknownst to Rost, Pfizer had already disclosed the off-label marketing effort at Pharmacia to the Department of Justice and fired the responsible parties. After Pfizer fired him in December 2005, Rost filed a wrongful termination lawsuit, while Pfizer said that they had planned to eliminate his position due to redundancies from the merger in 2003, but that they had kept him because they were aware of the FCA suit he had filed.Reuters, in the New York Times. December 14, 2005 Whistle-Blower Sues Pfizer Pfizer also said that they had informed the FDA of Pharmacia's marketing and kickback practices two weeks prior to Rost filing his FCA lawsuit and that they could not do so earlier due to securities laws related to the Pharmacia merger; they also said that government's decision not to intervene supported their contention that the lawsuit was baseless. The judge presiding over Rost's wrongful termination lawsuit ruled that the evidence showed Pfizer's version of events to be correct. Rost's FCA lawsuit was dismissed in September 2006 for failing to show that Pharmacia's marketing and kickbacks generated fraudulent claims to be submitted to the US Government; Rost appealed.Daniel Wilson for Law360 August 23, 2013 Pfizer Settles Former Exec's FCA Suit In 1st Circ. On April 2, 2007, Pfizer and the Department of Justice, which had been conducting its own investigations focused on kickbacks and illegal off-label marketing (not fraud), announced that two Pharmacia subsidiaries had pleaded guilty and agreed to pay at total of $34.7 million in civil and criminal penalties for kickbacks and illegally promoting its human growth hormone drug, Genotropin. One subsidiary had offered to overpay a subsidiary of a pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts, by $12.3 million to induce it recommend Genotropin over other forms of HGH; the other marketed Genotropin off-label for uses in antiaging, cosmetics, and athletic performance.

The Scrambler, Twist (in the UK), Twister, Cha Cha (in Australia), Sizzler, or Merry Mixer, is an amusement ride in which suspended riders spinning in cars experience centrifugal force, while spinning along two separate axes. Riders are seated in small carriages clustered together and connected by beams at the top to a central point. The clustered vehicles are spun in one direction, while the ride as a whole spins in the opposite direction. There are a number of variations of the design. == Early history == The first scrambler was invented by Richard Harris of Georgia and installed at Lakewood Fairgrounds in 1938. Two additional rides were built and sold in the following two years. In 1941, Harris was granted a U.S. patent for the design, which was then acquired or licensed by the Eli Bridge Company. In late 1953, the Eli Bridge Company road-tested its Scrambler ride, and sold the first five by the end 1954. The original ride had a total of 12 cars distributed among its three arms with a capacity of 24 adults or 36 children. The entire ride rotated clockwise at 9‚Äì12 revolutions per minute. The Eli Bridge Scrambler had one of its first major showings at the 1955 Florida State Fair, where it grossed $1,700 (at 25 cents a ride) in a single day and interested many additional buyers. The rides first appeared in the UK in 1959, when they were manufactured by Edwin Hall under license from the Eli Bridge Company. Eli Bridge rides were first imported in 1979. ==VariantsGrasscutter=== A grasscutter scrambler has a basic frame shape and no platform and is driven by a lower arm assembly. This type of ride is extremely popular in the United States. * Scrambler‚ÄîThese rides usually have a circular structure near the top of the ride. There are vertical bars that go around the top along with lights on them. For the most part, these rides are made by the Eli Bridge Company. Ride Extravaganza Retrieved 2016-7-16 * Wisdom's Sizzler‚ÄîThis ride does not have a platform, but it still has thick arms at the top and bottom of each seating assembly. The top of the ride has 3 twisted metal structures. There are also lights all over the ride including the cars. These are popular in the US, but are no longer made by Wisdom. ===Sizzler=== A Sizzler is a ride which has thicker arms and a platform. It was when these type started being manufactured, the manufacturers concentrated on the ride aesthetics. Concerns have been raised about its safety, as the ride has been involved in at least six fatalities since 1997. * Bennett & Pollards‚ÄîThese rides have a smaller circumference from the center of the ride to the seats. They are similar to Eli Bridge Scrambler rides because they also have cylinder structures on top of the ride. * PWS Sizzler, Sonacase Twister, & Twist‚ÄîThese rides each have a platform, but they do not have objects near the top of the ride such as a cylinder structure. There are lights all around the center structure of the ride. Thus, these rides look similar. * Wisdom's Family Sizzler‚Äîthis ride has thick arms and a platform, along with a central structure with dazzling lights. It has wheels to guide the three pods along underneath, and is quite fast when compared to a Grasscutter-type ride. They are found mostly at indoor fun centers and are the only type of Sizzler being made by Wisdom. * Wisdom's Super Sizzler‚ÄîThis ride has a platform, and it looks similar to the Sizzler. Another difference is that it goes backwards, and this ride also has a backdrop with some colorful art. ===Gee Whizzer=== The 'Gee Whizzer' derivative was constructed and commissioned by the operators King Carnival amusements of Tasmania, Australia during the 1950s. The project was carried out by rail engineers who utilised rail and tram parts which were common for the era. This machine is currently the largest and fastest of the variants utilising a unique fully suspended balanced single sweep arm design, driven from the top resulting in no lower arm assembly. The centre support core is fully independent and does not require a support deck, instead eight extended stabilisers are fitted to the core during assembly. Only one of these machines are known to be in existence. ===Cyclone=== A Cyclone, also known as a Lifting Twist, manufactured by ARM UK, has very much the same function and appearance as a normal Sizzler, except that the centre structure begins to lift with the cars once it reaches up to normal speed until it reaches above the fence level, where it remains for the duration of the ride. They are considerably fast when they reach full speed, although they normally slow down first so riders can brace for the full speed. After the full speed part is over, the centre structure begins to lower back to platform level as the ride slows down to a stop. Only one of these Cyclones currently exist in the world. ==Current installations== Manufacturing tablet for the Scrambler at Cedar Point. {  + !Name !Location !Manufacturer !Opened !Closed !Details - Pharaoh's Fury Adventure Island     - Road Runner Scrambler Adventure Park USA (Monrovia, Maryland) Eli Bridge Company    - Scrambler Adventureland (Iowa) Eli Bridge Company 1974  Originally opened in 1968 at Riverview Park.

It was designed by William Augustus Edwards in the Collegiate Gothic style and opened in 1919. As the University Gymnasium, it was the home to several of the university's indoor sports teams until the Florida Gymnasium opened in the late 1940s. The university became co-educational at about the same time, and the building was rechristened the Women's Gymnasium to be used primarily by the school's many new female students. On June 27, 1979, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The opening of O'Connell Center in 1980 and several new student recreation facilities over the following years made the old gym obsolete, and it gradually fell into disuse. The building was slated for demolition, but was saved for its historic value. A large donation made it possible to completely transform the interior, and the university's Women's Studies Department moved into newly renamed Ustler Hall in 2006. ==History== The University of Florida campus just before construction of the University Gymnasium. The University of Florida (UF) was established in Gainesville in 1906. Initial student enrollment was about 100, so only two buildings (Buckman Hall and Thomas Hall) were needed to accommodate all functions of the new school. Enrollment grew slowly over following years and accelerated under second university president Albert A. Murphree, who oversaw an expansion program that saw the addition of several colleges to the university's academic offerings and several more buildings constructed across the campus. By the end of World War I, enrollment reached 1000. Buckman Hall included some indoor athletic space, but a larger student population required larger recreational facilities, and the university made plans to build its first dedicated gymnasium on the west side of campus. The facility was designed by William Augustus Edwards, architect for the Florida Board of Control, who designed most of the UF's early buildings in the Collegiate Gothic style. Construction began in the summer of 1918, but the project went over budget, and Murphree solicited donations from the local community to complete interior details. Fundraising successfully completed when Major League Baseball's New York Giants agreed to hold spring training in Gainesville in 1919 and rented the newly-opened University Gymnasium as their spring headquarters. The University Gym was designed to be a combination student recreation center, physical education facility, assembly hall, and sports venue. It was the home court of the Florida Gators men's basketball team and all other university-sponsored indoor sport programs for about ten years. However, spectator space around the court was very limited in the narrow building, and as university enrollment continued to increase, a larger wooden \\"New Gym\\" was constructed directly adjacent to the University Gym in 1929 to serve as a temporary home for the basketball team until funding was available for a more permanent replacement. Meanwhile, the University Gym continued to host physical education classes, intramural sports, and smaller assemblies. The Florida Gymnasium was finally completed in 1948, the same year that the university went fully co- educational. The University Gym was renamed the Women's Gymnasium and was used for hosting women's sporting events and classes while the wooden \\"New Gym\\" next door was converted into rehearsal space for the university's marching band. In 1980, the much larger and modern O'Connell Center replaced both of the older gyms as UF's primary indoor sports venue. The Florida Gym was renovated to serve other uses, but the Women's Gym was slated for demolition. A push to save the structure delayed its destruction, and in 1988, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, granting it protection. However, it remained underutilized and was mainly used as an extra storage facility. With a donation from UF alumna Kathryn Chicone Ustler in 2000, the long-vacant gym was transformed into a three story academic building with modern classrooms along with faculty and administrative offices. A circular courtyard was also added in front of the building, replacing a small parking area. The restoration process began in 2004 and was completed in July 2006. In 2008, the restoration was named a \\"Project of Regional Impact\\" by the Florida Heritage Foundation. Now known as Ustler Hall, the building houses the Women's Studies Department and the Center for Women's and Gender Studies Research. It is the only freestanding campus building in the United States devoted solely to Women's Studies, and was the first building on the UF campus renamed to honor a woman. ==See also== *University of Florida *Buildings at the University of Florida *Campus Historic District ==References * Alachua County listings at National Register of Historic Places * Alachua County listings at Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs * Virtual tour of University of Florida Campus Historic District at Alachua County's Department of Growth Management * The University of Florida Historic Campus at UF Facilities Planning & Construction * George A.

Reductions or in Spanish reducciones, also called 'congregaciones', (Portuguese: redu√ß√£o, plural redu√ß√µes) were settlements created by Spanish rulers in Spanish America and the Spanish East Indies (the Philippines). The Spanish relocated, forcibly in many cases, indigenous inhabitants of their colonies (los indios) into settlements modeled on towns and villages in Spain. In Portuguese-speaking Latin America, such reductions were also called aldeias. ==The Caribbean== The policy of reductions was begun in 1503 by Spanish colonists on Caribbean islands. In the words of the Spanish rulers, \\"It is necessary that the Indians be assigned to towns in which they will live together and that they not remain or wander separated from each other in the backcountry.\\" The Spanish ordered Indian villages to be destroyed and selected sites where new villages should be built. The concentration, or reducci√≥n of the Indian population, facilitated the Spaniards' access to Indian labor, the promulgation of Christianity, and the collection of taxes and tribute.Mumford, Jeremy Ravi (2012, Vertical Empire: The General Resettlement of Indians in the Colonial Andes, Durham: Duke University Press, p. 44 Moreover, the reduction of the Indians was intended to break down ethnic and kinship ties and detribalize the residents to create a generic, pan-Indian population, disregarding their numerous tribes and different cultures.Stern, Steve J. (1993), Peru's Indian Peoples and the Challenge of Spanish Conquest, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, p. 80 ==North America== The Spanish began creating reductions in Mexico shortly after Cort√©s's conquest in the 1520s. They were begun in Baja California in the 17th century and California in the late 18th century. Reductions in Mexico were more commonly known as congregaciones.Leal, Juan Felipe and Rountree, Mario Huacuja (2011), Economic y sistema de haciendas en Mexico, Juan Pablos, Editor, D. R. Voyeur, pp. 22-23 ==South America== Indian reductions in the Andes, mostly in present-day Peru and Bolivia, began on a large scale in 1570 during the rule of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo. Toledo worked to remake the society of the former Inca empire, with some success. In a few years, he had resettled about 1.4 million Indians into 840 communities, many of which were the nuclei of present-day cities, towns, and villages.Mumford, p. 190 Probably the most famous of the reductions were in [the areas of present-day [Paraguay and neighboring Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia in the 17th and 18th centuries. These were created and governed by the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church.Caraman, Philip (1976), The Lost Paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America, New York: Seabury Press. ==Philippines== In the Spanish Philippines, the Spanish colonial government founded hundreds of towns and villages across the archipelago modeled on towns and villages in Spain. The authorities often adopted a policy of reductions for the resettlement of inhabitants from far- flung scattered Barrios or barangays to move into a centralized cabecera (town/district capital), where a newly built church and an ayuntamiento (town hall) were situated. This allowed the government to defend, control and Christianize the indigenous population, to conduct population counts, and to collect tributes. ==See also== *Indian reductions in the Andes *Jesuit reductions ==References== Category:Spanish colonization of the Americas Category:History of indigenous peoples of the Americas Category:History of New Spain Category:Latin American caste system ","title":"Reductions"},{"id":"6231631","text":"Starry Plough may refer to: *Starry Plough (flag), a banner of the former Irish Citizen Army, subsequently adopted by other Irish political organizations * The Starry Plough (magazine), the official magazine (formerly newspaper) of the Irish Republican Socialist Party ==See also== * Big Dipper, or The Plough, an asterism consisting of the seven bright stars of the constellation Ursa Major * The Plough and the Stars, a play by Sean O'Casey based on the Citizen Army's role in the Easter Rising ** The Plough and the Stars, 1937 American film based on the O'Casey play ","title":"Starry Plough"},{"id":"6231633","text":"The following is a list of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the Clydesdale and South East Glasgow Area of Search.

Lawson was a seven-masted, steel-hulled schooner built for the Pacific trade, but used primarily to haul coal and oil along the East Coast of the United States. Named for copper baron Thomas W. Lawson, a Boston millionaire, stock-broker, book author, and president of the Boston Bay State Gas Co., she was launched in 1902 as the largest schooner and largest sailing vessel without an auxiliary engine ever built. Thomas W. Lawson was destroyed off the uninhabited island of Annet, in the Isles of Scilly, in a storm on December 14, 1907, killing all but two of her eighteen crew and a harbor pilot already aboard. Her cargo of 58,000 barrels of light paraffin oil caused perhaps the first large marine oil spill. == Development and construction == Designed by naval architect Bowdoin B. Crowninshield (famous for his fast yachts) for Captain John G. Crowley of the Coastwise Transportation Company of Boston, Massachusetts, the construction of Thomas W. Lawson was contracted to the Fore River Ship and Engine Company on June 25, 1901. At a cost of approximately $250,000, she was the only seven-masted schooner, the only seven-masted sailing ship in modern times (see Zheng He's treasure ships), the largest schooner, and the largest pure sailing vessel, in terms of tonnage, ever built. Larger sailing vessels with auxiliary engines for propulsion were the English Great Eastern (1866), the French France II (1911) and German R. C. Rickmers (1906), the latter two of which were five-masted barques. Thomas W. Lawson's design and purpose was an ultimately unsuccessful bid to keep sailing ships competitive with the burgeoning steamship freight transport trade. However the ship's submerged hull was too large and sail area too small for good sailing properties; compounded by a forced reduction in load capacity from 11,000 to 7,400 long tons that made ‚Äúworking to capacity‚Äù impossible, the combination undermined expected profits. Launched on July 10, 1902, Thomas W. Lawson was overall, 395 feet (120.4 m) on deck, and contained seven masts of equal height (193 feet (58.8 m)) which carried 25 sails (seven gaff sails, seven gaff topsails, six topmast staysails and five jib sails (fore staysail, jib, flying jib, jib topsail, balloon jib) encompassing 43,000 square feet (4,000 m¬≤)) of canvas. Originally painted white, the ship's hull was later painted black. The naming of her masts was always a subject for some discussion (see external link \\"The Masts of the Thomas W. Lawson\\"). In the original sail plan and during construction named (fore to aft): 'no. 1 to no. 7', no. 7 being replaced by \\"spanker mast.\\" The names of the masts changed then to: 'fore, main, mizzen, spanker, jigger, driver, and pusher' at launch and to: 'forecastle, fore, main, mizzen, jigger, and spanker' after launch. Different naming systems ensued, e.g. 'fore, main, mizzen, rusher, driver, jigger, and spanker' or 'fore, main, mizzen, no. 4, no. 5, no. 6, and no. 7', the naming preferred by the crew (which incorporated a possible misunderstanding between \\"fore\\" meaning \\"foremast\\" and \\"mast no. four\\"). Even a naming after the days of the week was discussed with the foremast being named \\"Sunday\\" and the spankermast \\"Saturday\\". The ship consisted of a steel hull with high bulwarks and a double cellular bottom four feet deep and used 1,000 tons of water ballast. She measured 5,218 gross register tons, could carry nearly 11,000 tons of coal, and was operated by a crew of 16 to 18 including captain, engineer, two helmsmen, and two stewards. Due to the shallow depth of the eastern ports except Newport News, Virginia, she could not enter them with her maximum load. As a result, she carried a reduced capacity of 7,400 tons in order to reduce her working draft. She had two continuous decks, poop and forecastle decks, a large superstructure on the poop deck including the captain's rooms with fine furniture and leather seats, the officers' mess and rooms, card room, and a separate rudder house. On the main deck were two deckhouses around mast no. 5 and behind mast no. 6, as well as six main hatches to access the holds between the masts. Two huge steam winches were built in under the forecastle and behind mast no. 6. on the main deck. Smaller electrically driven winches were installed beside each mast. The exhaust for the donkey engine boiler was horizontally installed. All seven lower steel masts were secured by five (foremast: six) shrouds per side, the wooden topmasts with four shrouds per side to the crosstrees. The two ship's stockless anchors weighed five tons each. == Service == Deeply loaded in Boston Harbor, hull painted in black; photo taken in 1906 or 1907 Schooner Thomas W. Lawson, by Thomas Willis, oil on Canvas with Silk Embroidery Often criticized by marine writers (and some seamen) and considered difficult to maneuver and sluggish (comparisons to a \\"bath tub\\" and a \\"beached whale\\" were made), Thomas W. Lawson proved problematic in the ports she was intended to operate in due to the amount of water she displaced. She tended to yaw and needed a strong wind to be held on course. Originally built for the Pacific trade, the schooner was used as collier along the American East Coast. A year later in 1903, Crowley withdrew her from the coal trade. He had the topmasts, gaff booms and all other wooden spars removed and had chartered her out as a sea-going barge for the transportation of case oil. In 1906, she was retrofitted for sail at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company for use as a bulk oil carrier using the lower steel masts to vent oil gasses from the holds. Her capacity was 60,000 barrels. Under charter to Sun Oil Company, she was the world's first pure sailing tanker, carrying bulk oil from Texas to the eastern seaboard. == Wreck == Thomas W. Lawson Lifebelt in the Valhalla Museum in Tresco Abbey Gardens, Isles of Scilly In 1907, Thomas W. Lawson was under charter to the Anglo-American Oil Company (part of Standard Oil) and set sail on November 19 from the piers of Marcus Hook Refinery (20 miles south of Philadelphia) to London with 58,000 barrels of light paraffin oil. Two days before leaving the new captain George Washington Dow had to hire six new men to the crew because six other seamen had quit their jobs due to payment problems. Those new men weren't able seamen and some didn't speak fluent English. Leaving the mouth of the Delaware River, on November 20, the large schooner set course for England under fair weather conditions. But the following day the weather turned considerably worse. The ship was not sighted for more than 20 days during its first transatlantic journey, which was quite horrible in extremely stormy weather. With the loss of most of her sails, all but one lifeboat, and the breach of hatch no. 6, causing the ship's pumps to clog due to a mixture of intruding seawater and the engine's coal in the ship's hold, the schooner reached the Celtic Sea northwest of the Isles of Scilly. On December 13, entering the English Channel, she mistakenly passed inside the Bishop Rock lighthouse, the westernmost one in Europe, and her captain anchored between the Nundeeps shallows and Gunner's Rock, northwest of the island of Annet, to ride out an impending gale, refusing several requests of St. Agnes and St. Mary's lifeboat crews to abandon the ship. Captain Dow, trusting in his anchors, only accepted the Trinity House pilot Billy \\"Cook\\" Hicks from St. Agnes lifeboat, who came aboard at 5 p.m. on Friday 13. Both lifeboats of St. Agnes and St. Mary's had to return to their stations because of an unconscious crewman on the former and a broken mast on the latter. They cabled to Falmouth, Cornwall, for a tug which couldn't put to sea, unable to face the storm. St Agnes' Lifeboat crew from a panel in St Agnes' Church, St Agnes Isles of Scilly During the night, around 1:15 a.m., the storm increased, her port anchor chain broke, and half an hour later the starboard anchor chain snapped close to the hawsepipe. Left to the mercy of the raging seas, the pounding schooner was smashed starboardside on against Shag Rock near Annet by tremendously heavy seas after having grounded on the dangerous underwater rocks. All seven masts broke off and fell into the sea with all of the seamen who had climbed the rigging for safety, on their captain's command. The stern section broke apart behind mast no. 6, drifting from the capsizing and sinking ship. In the morning light the ship's upturned keel could be seen near the reef from which the wreck slid off into deeper water. Some 16 of the 18 crew and the Scillonian pilot Wm. \\"Cook\\" Hicks, who was already on board, having climbed up the spanker rigging for safety, were lost. Captain George W. Dow and engineer Edward L. Rowe from Boston were the only survivors, probably because they managed to get on deck from the rigging and jumped into the sea before the ship capsized. Both were lucky in being washed to a rock in the Hellweathers, to the south of the wrecking site, to be rescued hours later by the pilot's son, in the six-oared gig Slippen, looking for his father, Despite wearing their lifebelts, the other seamen died in the thick oil layer, the smashing seas, and the schooner's rigging that had drowned so many of the crew, including the pilot. Four bodies were found later ‚Äì those of Mark Stenton from Brooklyn, cabin boy, of two seamen from Germany and Scandinavia, and that of a man from Nova Scotia or Maine. Furthermore, some bodies without heads, legs or arms were also found which could not be identified. They were all buried in a mass grave in St Agnes cemetery. The broken-up and scattered wreck was relocated in 1969. The bow lies at 56 ft deep on position to the north-east of Shag Rock, and the stern, with the spanker mast 400 m to the southwest. It can be visited by scuba divers under calm weather conditions. One of the anchors is now built into the outside wall of Bleak House, Broadstairs, the former home of Charles Dickens, and can be seen with a picture of the schooner. ==Memorial== In 2008 a memorial seat was blessed by the Reverend Guy Scott in the churchyard of St Agnes, the nearest inhabitable island to the wreck and the home of the pilot, Billy \\"Cook\\" Hicks. The seat, made of granite from a St Breward quarry, faces the mass, unmarked grave of many of Thomas W. Lawson's dead.Memorial seat commemorates one of Scilly‚Äôs most tragic wrecks.

The Peloponnese is made up of a number of states and Karyes belongs to the state of Laconia in which Sparta is the capital. Karyes gets its official name from the word ‚Äòwalnut‚Äô due to the village having many walnut trees and has been spelled a number of ways such as Karyes, Karyai, Karya, Caryes, Caryai and Caryae. It should not be confused with some other villages in Greece which go by the same name such as Caria of Asia Minor, Karyes, Mount Athos, Karyes, Pieria, Karya of Argos, and Karyes of Chios. Karyes also goes by the name of Arahova (not to be confused with Arahova of Boetia, Greece) which was thought to have originated from the Slavic word for walnut. The village of Karyes is the birthplace of the six caryatid maidens which are featured in architecture in the place of columns on the ancient and world famous Erectheion of the Acropolis. == The Caryatids == 311x311px The original caryatid maidens of the Acropolis were replaced by replicas due to air pollution and five of the six originals are now housed in the Acropolis Museum in Athens. The sixth caryatid was stolen by the command of British Lord Elgin and is now held in the British Museum in London. There are two different views for the meaning behind the caryatid maidens in the literature, the first being a maiden dancer from the village of Karyes and the second an imprisoned slave. Geographer Pausanias‚Äô historical account from the second century AD discusses the history behind the Caryatid statues as representing dancers from Karyes. He states every year in Karyes the Lacedaemonian, virgin dancers would perform the dance of ‚Äòcaryatis‚Äô around a statue of the goddess Artemis Caryatis at a summer festival called Karyateia. The original caryatids were dancers from Karyes but later, any female from the Laconian area who performed this dance was also called a caryatid. Pausanias also mentions a temple of Artemis located in Karyes and says that she was sacred in this area. Roman architect, writer and engineer Vitruvius had his own opinion on the history behind the caryatids. Vitruvius claims that the caryatids were maidens of Karyes who were held captive as slaves, as a form of punishment for siding with the Persian enemies against the Spartans. He believes they were later depicted in Greek architecture as holding a great burden for being traitors and their presence in architecture was a way of commemorating this betrayal . Other authors and scholars reject Vitruvious' view such as German poet and critic Lessing who critiqued this theory as he could find no historical evidence or documents to support his claims and thus argued that his view was a myth and confabulation. Frank Granger suggested that he perhaps confused Karyes for another town called Caria, of Asia Minor which was said to have been implicated in collaborating with the Persian enemy. ==History 4-5th century BC === The village name of Karyes has carried from ancient times as there has been an abundance of walnut trees since then. Various objects and fragments which were found during digging, have provided physical evidence for the ancient settlement in Karyes and the caryatid monument is said to be currently positioned in the place of the ancient acropolis of Karyes. During the years before Christ, the people of the Peloponnese were polytheistic and worshipped many Gods, Goddesses and various nymphs, which explains the worship of goddess Artemis in this area. The Peloponnese consisted of a lot of different municipalities, Tegea, Arcadia, Messinia, Laconia (including the city of Sparta) and they all had their own heads of state. During this time the Spartans had a lot of conflict and they involved themselves in a lot of different wars such as the first and second Messinian wars, the Peloponnesian war and the Greco-Persian Wars. Karyes had its own army of around 600 men and they generally supported the Spartans. Karyes took part in the Trojan war along with the Spartans, and they were also allies with the Spartans in the Persian war. The Spartans respected the Karyates because of their bravery and endurance, but the Karyates preferred to deal with and be part of Arcadia and Tegea as the Spartans were very strict, regimented and difficult in their ways. Karyes was part of Sparta until 338 BC when Philip II of Macedon came to the Peloponnese for a meeting, where all the Greeks except the Spartans recognised him as their leader . As a result, the Spartans were punished, their power began to decline and the people of Tegea, Messinia and Karyes then regained their independence . === Roman and Byzantine Period === Goth Alaric I who was King of the Visigoths in 370 - 410 AD invaded and took over a number of areas in Greece and villages of the Peloponnese including the city of Argos, Arcadia and also Karyes in 396 AD. The Goths looted and destroyed everything in these villages but after some time in 403 AD they gained the attention of Roman General Flavius Stilicho who came to the Peloponnese and killed and pushed a lot of them out of the area. When the goths were kicked out, the people from Karyes started to rebuild their life and towns. The Byzantine era came about a few hundred years after the Roman occupation in Greece and during this period, Greece became part of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Greek city of Constantinople was made capital of the Byzantine. The founding father of Byzantium was emperor Constantine I who ruled from 306 ‚Äì 337 AD. Due to emperor Constantine's support of Christianity, this period saw the shift away from paganism towards the Christianisation of society, except the north part of Laconia which remained polytheistic up until 867 ‚Äì 866 AD. Also during this era, Slavic people came to the area of Laconia and to Karyes and settled peacefully by adopting Christianity and assimilating with the local Greeks. === Ottoman Period and the burning of Arachova === Greece was under Ottoman occupation for hundreds of years from the 1400s until the Greek War of Independence began in 1821. In an attempt to stop the revolution by the Greeks, the Peloponnese was invaded in 1826 by a Turkish army lead by a general named Ibrahim. On the 12th May they came to siege and destroy Karyes and the residents fled to the mountains with whatever possessions they could carry and hid in caves. Karyes was burnt down to the ground with the exception of seven or eight houses and the church of Saint Paraskevi. The Turkish troops returned three months later with 1500 men, but this time they were attacked by the Greek forces and suffered a loss in which 185 soldiers were killed, many Greek prisoners were released and Ibrahim and his army were chased out of the village. === World War II === World War II occurred in Southern Europe in 1941 and Karyes was invaded by the Nazi Axes Forces for the first time on the 18th of December 1942. Fearing for their lives, many of the residents fled the village and took refuge in huts they had built in the mountains. The Italians who were allies with Germany, terrorised the remaining villagers by kidnap, torture, shooting and burning a number of houses before leaving the village. Some of the soldiers stayed in the village where they tortured, bribed and threatened the residents for provisions such as food, wine and livestock. At 5am on the 19th of September 1943, Karyes was invaded again by German troops and the bell of Saint John church rang to give warning to the residents. As the residents were woken up from their sleep it was too late for them to escape to the mountains and the whole village was seized by panic as flares and machine guns fired and grenades exploded. In this invasion, twelve people were killed, four were injured and thirty one people were taken as hostages. This invasion was finally brought to an end when an International Red Cross representative named Alexander Perrson visited Karyes. On the 26th of November 1943, 118 elite and educated people from Laconia were captured by the Nazi Forces. This attack was said to be a form of revenge by the Germans for an attack done by rebels of Monodentri. Among this group doctor Christos Karvounis from Karyes who completed his studies in Germany was recognised by one of the army men. The soldiers were going to let him go but he pleaded with them and said that he will not leave without the others, but his plea was ignored and all the 118 people were killed. Kostas Pitsius who kept a diary at the time recorded that on the 15th of March 1944, Karyes was burned down by the German troops. Around 150 men arrived and the bell of Saint Andreas church sounded to warn the villagers, who quickly ran to hide in the mountains, forest and around the village. The village was completely looted for any jewellery, tools, livestock, clothes and furniture and the school and town clock were blown up. 8 people were killed and over 200 houses were burnt down. Around 40 houses were saved with the help of some women who cleverly put out some of the major fires and set fires to objects such as clothes and sheets on top of stone or steel, to deceive the Germans and save their homes. The next day after more destruction and burning, they loaded everything in their cars and mules and began to leave. Another 46 people that were taken as prisoners were shot dead on the 21 March. From June ‚Äì July 1944 Karyes experienced its final and most terrifying Nazi invasion on Parnon mountain which lasted 15 days. The troops completely destroyed everything and there was further torture and shootings, in which a total of 250 people from 15 nearby villages were killed, including 14 people from Karyes. In September, as Hitler was losing the war, the troops began to retreat and by the 18th of October all the bells started to ring and gave the final signal of freedom that all the Germans had left Laconia. === Contemporary Karyes === As of 2001 Karyes has around 729 permanent residents which is a lot less than the pre-war population of 2180. The current Karyes features a main town square where there are coffee shops, bars and restaurants and 40 metres from the Town Square there is a beautiful church called Saint Andreas. 100 metres from the Town Square there is another shopping area which consists of a supermarket, fruit market, bread shop and cake shop. The church of Assumption dedicated to Jesus' mother Mary was built in the 1900s and according to Pausanias, where this church stands was once the temple of Artemis Caryatis. In the courtyard of this church there are a number of eternal plane trees and legend says that they were planted by King Menelaus, King of Sparta near a spring around 1100 BC, but their exact age has not been determined. Similarly, Pausanias also mentions some plane trees planted by King Menalaus close by to a spring and temple in Arcadia. There is a modern version of the town clock tower which was built in 1955, as the previous one which was built in 1930 was blown up in the 1944 Nazi invasion. Majority of people from the village work as farmers producing vegetables and fruit and looking after their livestock such as goats, sheep, chickens and tending to their bee farms. Karyes holds an annual festival on 26th and 27th of July to celebrate two religious Saint's days where there are feasts, music, dancing and other festivities. == Geography == Karyes is located in the southern part of Greece within the Peloponnese peninsula. It is about 40 km North-East from the major city of Sparta near the border of the two states, Laconia and Arcadia and roughly midway between Tripoli and Sparta. It is situated at the foot of Parnon mountain around 980 metres above sea level and is made up of a partly flat and partly mountainous terrain with some of the houses being built on hills and slopes. Northwest of the village there is a hill with a church on top of it called Saint Elias and East of the village there is a hill with another church on top of it called Saint Constantine. == Municipality == Since the 2011 local government reform Karyes is part of the municipality Sparta, Laconia, of which it is a municipal unitKallikratis law, Greece Ministry of Interior (in Greek) with an area of 64.426 km2. == Places of Interest == * Town Square * Caryatid Monument * Clock Tower * Karyes primary school * Monument of the 118 soldiers (on the road from Sparta to Karyes) *Eternal Plane Trees *Church of Assumption *Church of Saint Andreas *Church of Saint Demetrios *Church of Saint John *Church of Saint Constantine *Church of Saint Elias == Gallery == File:Kar6.jpgGovernment Building in the Town Square File:Church of Saint Andreas.jpgChurch of Saint Andreas in the Town Square File:Caryatids front.jpgCaryatid monument, Karyes Laconia File:Caryatids side.jpgCaryatids monument side view, Karyes of Laconia File:Caryatids inscription.jpgInscription of Caryatid monument File:Menalaus planes sign.jpgMenalaus planes sign File:Church of assumption and eternal plane tree.

It is located in the northeastern section of the University of Florida in the middle of the Campus Historic District. When it was first created it was the largest building on campus at that time. It is a part of the George A. Smathers Libraries system and home to multiple collections of books and other library materials. ==History== This facility was designed by the architect William A. Edwards and was first opened in October 1926. A major addition was designed by Florida Board of Control Architect Guy Fulton following World War II. On June 27, 1979, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. In 1991 after a generous donation by the former United States Senator George Smathers the facility was officially renamed the Smathers Library. ==Map & Imagery Library== The Map & Imagery Library makes up a portion of the ground floor of the Smathers Library. It consists of several different collections which, combined, contain roughly 500,000 maps, 300,000 aerial photographs and satellite images, 8,000 atlases and reference books and an increasing number of geospatial datasets. It is one of largest academic map libraries in the United States. It specializes in content concerning Florida, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa and is open to the public every weekday. ==Special Collections Grand Reading Room== The Special Collections Room in Library East The second floor of Smathers Library is home to the Special Collections Grand Reading Room. This space provides the primary source of access to many of the George A. Smathers Libraries' Special Collections materials. As many of the materials within these collections are not available to be checked out or loaned, any person interested in viewing them must do so in the Grand Reading Room, under the supervision of library staff. Collections which can be accessed through the Grand Reading Room include, but are not limited to, the University Archives, the Architecture Archives, the P. K. Yonge Library of Florida History, the Baldwin Library of Historical Children's Literature, the Manuscript Collection, the Popular Culture Collections and the Rare Books Collections. == Judaica Suite == In January 2014, the Judaica Suite was opened as an annexing group of reading rooms accessed through the Special Collections Grand Reading Room. The alcoves of the Suite hold books from the University's Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica, including many rare copies. Within the Suite, specific books are grouped together in different alcoves to represent various periods in the history of Jewish literature and culture. The Judaica Suite was designed by world-renowned architect and artist, and University of Florida alumnus, Kenneth Treister. ==Latin American and Caribbean Collection== The Latin American and Caribbean Collection makes up the third floor of Smathers Library. This collection was founded in 1951, prompted by growing scholarly interest in Latin America and the Caribbean, and has since grown into one of the University of Florida's premier collections. The collection is housed in a newly renovated space and now consists of approximately 500,000 books, 50,000 microforms, thousands of journal titles and a considerable number of digital resources. About 70% of these resources are in Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Most of the remaining collection is in English, however, there are also materials in Haitian Creole, Dutch, and indigenous languages. Though the collection covers Caribbean and Latin American areas but focuses on the Caribbean and Brazil. Primary sources from the Caribbean are also available, ranging from agriculture to revolution. The library also has its own stacks, reading rooms, and reference services making it one of the few libraries left in the US to do so. The collection is open to the public and is usually open six days of the week. ==See also== *George A.
