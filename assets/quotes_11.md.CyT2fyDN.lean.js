In 1927, Pearson moved with his widowed mother to Jamestown. In 1935 he moved with his and his brother Glen's families to Cockaleechie and the following year 20 km north to Yeelanna. He first contested the state election for Flinders in 1938, but lost after distribution of preferences. In 1941, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the Liberal and Country League member for Flinders, on preferences from the Labor candidate to defeat the Single Tax League MP Edward Craigie. Even though he moved to Belair then Lower Mitcham near Adelaide and his mother's home, he won the 1947 and 1950 elections for Flinders and retained his interest and support for farming and rural interests, especially in his electorate on Eyre Peninsula. In 1951, he transferred to federal politics, winning a seat in the Australian Senate as a Liberal at the double dissolution federal election. His brother Glen won the Flinders by-election. Pearson held his senate seat by winning elections in 1953 and 1958, until his death in 1961, necessitating the appointment of Gordon Davidson to replace him. Pearson was a Methodist lay preacher on Eyre Peninsula. ==References== Category:Liberal and Country League politicians Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for South Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the South Australian House of Assembly Category:1905 births Category:1961 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Rex Pearson"},{"id":"20351795","text":"Standing on a Hummingbird is Mark Templeton's first full-length album, released February 2007.

His famous book was first printed in 1811 and reprinted in 1826 due to its popularity. In this work, he presented his findings that hybrids are offspring of outcross pollination and not due to grafting as previously thought. He also studied the family barriers affecting species compatibility and gave a good account of the history and distribution of citrus. He was widely cited in many works of his day, and also in The Citrus Industry book, by Webber, Batchelor and others. He has a further minor claim to fame as the first person to use the expression 'dominant' (in Italian, 'dominante') to refer to the hereditary transmission of characters when plants are hybridised (\\"Quindi la loro combinazione, non essendo naturale, riesce inconstante nei suoi effeti, e quest i portano, ora l'impronta di un principio, ora di un altro, in proporzione che ve ne è uno dominante.\\" Gallesio, Giorgio.

He was a member of the Liberal Party and served as a Senator for South Australia. He was twice appointed to casual vacancies (1961 and 1962) and later won election in his own right, serving 16 years (1965–1981). He was a grazier and church administrator before entering politics. ==Early life== Davidson's family were farmers at Angas Plains in the Strathalbyn area of South Australia. He was educated in the small Angas Plains School, then as a boarder at Scotch College in Adelaide. He worked on the family farm and was elected to the District Council of Strathalbyn, serving there from 1942 to 1950. He was also an elder and lay preacher at the Strathalbyn Presbyterian Church and joined the Liberal and Country League around 1940. He was initiated into the Freemasons in March 1941. Davidson travelled overseas to the UK, USA and Canada for almost two years from 1950. He returned in 1952 and married Patricia Emma (Pat) Newman at the Glenelg Methodist Church. They lived in Glenelg for almost 50 years. He hosted a radio program called Presbyterian Corner from 1955 to 1969. ==Senate== In 1961, Davidson was appointed to the Australian Senate as a Liberal Senator for South Australia, filling the casual vacancy caused by the death of Rex Pearson. He did not contest the casual vacancy in the 1961 election, and his term ended later in 1961. Senator Nancy Buttfield resigned her own seat on 8 December 1961 and won the casual vacancy previously held by Davidson, for the remainder of Pearson's term, which was due to expire in June 1965. In February 1962, he was re-appointed to the Senate to take on Buttfield's vacancy until the term expired in 1962. He was elected in his own right in 1964, and served from 1965 until his retirement on 30 June 1981.

Early jazz violinists included: Eddie South, who played violin with Jimmy Wade's Dixielanders in Chicago; Stuff Smith; and Claude \\"Fiddler\\" Williams. Joe Venuti was popular for his work with guitarist Eddie Lang during the 1920s. Improvising violinists include Stéphane Grappelli and Jean-Luc Ponty. In jazz fusion, violinists may use an electric violin plugged into an instrument amplifier with electronic effects. ==Swing to bebop== Stéphane Grappelli founded the gypsy jazz Quintette du Hot Club de France with guitarist Django Reinhardt before World War II. Jazz violin began in New Orleans in the early 1900s. Arrangements for ragtime orchestras had parts for violins in which they were as important as the other instruments. The violin was a lead instrument in the recordings of A. J. Piron, whose trumpeter Peter Bocage also played violin. Alphonso Trent and Andy Kirk employed violinists in their territory bands. Stuff Smith played violin as a member of Trent's band in the 1920s and tinkered with acoustic and electric means of increasing the volume of the instrument. Claude Williams alternated between guitar and violin when as a member of the Count Basie orchestra. In Chicago, Eddie South was violinist and music director for Jimmy Wade. South was accompanied by Juice Wilson when both were members of the Freddie Keppard band. Violin is one instrument Edgar Sampson performed on as a member of the Fletcher Henderson band in the 1930s. Angelina Rivera was a classically trained violinist who worked with Josephine Baker and Spencer Williams. W. C. Handy conducted an orchestra with a three-violin section that included Darnell Howard. Paul Whiteman's jazz orchestra a had a string section that was led by Matty Malneck. The bands of Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, and Earl Hines had string sections, though they didn't improvise. Bandleaders who were also violinists included Leon Abbey, Clarence Black, Carroll Dickerson, and Erskine Tate. Adam Taubitz founded The Berlin Philharmonic Jazz Group. Violin became a solo instrument in jazz largely through the efforts of Stuff Smith, Eddie South, Stephane Grappelli, and Joe Venuti. Venuti was in a popular duo with guitarist Eddie Lang beginning in the 1920s. Grappelli was a member of the gypsy jazz group Quintette du Hot Club de France with guitarist Django Reinhardt. In the 1930s when swing was dominant, other violinists included Darnell Howard, Ray Nance, Ray Perry, Svend Asmussen, and Michel Warlop. Perry and Ginger Smock provided a link from swing violin to bebop. Examples of bop violin in the 1950s include Dick Wetmore and Harry Lookofsky, who was in the NBC Orchestra led by Arturo Toscanini. Jean-Luc Ponty played bop violin in the 1960s as did Elek Bacsik in the 1970s. The violin is well-represented in modern jazz and improvisational music.Iyer Voted Jazz Artist of the Year in DownBeat Critics Poll. DownBeat Magazine June 23, 2015. Mark Feldman is one of the leading performers in modern and contemporary jazz violin, along with Mat Maneri and Jean-Luc Ponty. Adam Taubitz founded The Berlin Philharmonic Jazz Group. With this group he played -and still does- as a soloist on the trumpet and the violin in Europe and the Far East. Regina Carter regularly appears in readers' and critic's polls at Downbeat magazine while playing in an earthy, R&B-influenced; style. ==Amplification== A standard violin and an electric violin with a cut-away body Big bands are loud, but the violin is quiet. One person to address the problem was Augustus Stroh, who invented the Stroh violin in the 1890s that was inspired by the gramophone, with a horn connected to project the sound. In the 1930s, Stuff Smith experimented with electric amplification. Since the 1980s an electric violin has been used in which a transducer is built into the instrument. Jean-Luc Ponty's attraction to jazz was influenced by Miles Davis and John Coltrane, which led him to the electric violin. Critic Joachim Berendt wrote, \\"Since Ponty, the jazz violin has been a different instrument\\" and compared his phrasing to Coltrane's., p301 ==See also== *Swing (jazz performance style) *List of jazz violinists * Joe Venuti Discography == References Further reading== * Stringprovisation: A Fingering Strategy for Jazz Violin Improvisation https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/303707 by Ari Poutiainen * Jazz Fiddle Wizard by Martin Norgaard * Jazz Philharmonic by Randy Sabien * Improvising Violin by Julie Lyonn Lieberman Category:Jazz instruments Category:Violins Category:Occupations in music ","title":"Jazz violin"},{"id":"20352137","text":"is a former Japanese football player. ==Playing career== Miyamoto was born in Shimonoseki on December 3, 1982.

Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Hanford (1861 – January 24, 1910) was an American socialist politician during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A printer by trade, Hanford is best remembered for his 1904 and 1908 runs for Vice President of the United States on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America, running next to Presidential nominee Eugene V. Debs. Hanford was also the creator of the fictional character \\"Jimmie Higgins,\\" a prototypical Socialist rank-and-filer whose silent work on the unglamorous tasks needed by any political organization made the group's achievements possible — a character later reprised in a novel by Upton Sinclair. ==BiographyEarly life=== Benjamin Hanford was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1861,A front page obituary in the Chicago Daily Socialist has Hanford's date of birth as \\"1859.\\" Most sources list 1861. the son of George Byington Hanford and Susan Elizabeth Martin Hanford.James Gaven Field, \\"Ben Hanford,\\" Who's Who in America: Volume 1, 1897-1942.

New York: Wilshire Book Co., 1909; pg. 3. Hanford's father later married Frances Jane Thompson, a woman from Bangor, Maine who as Hanford's step-mother imparted a taste for scholarship and culture upon him. As a boy, Hanford worked for a newspaper, learning the printer's trade at the Marshalltown Republican of Marshalltown, Iowa.Wanhope, \\"Biographical Sketch of Ben Hanford,\\" pp. 3-4. With his 18th birthday approaching, Hanford left Iowa for the great regional metropolis of Chicago, where on February 26, 1879, he became a member of the Chicago Typographical Union, a local affiliate of the International Typographical Union.Wanhope, \\"Biographical Sketch of Ben Hanford,\\" pg. 4. Hanford would remain a dues-paying member of that organization for the rest of his life. In 1892, Hanford relocated to New York City.\\"Our Candidates: Ben Hanford,\\" Appeal to Reason, whole no. 443 (May 28, 1904), pg. 2. There he worked as a printer and became involved in the affairs of International Typographical Union Local No. 6 — known as \\"Big Six\\" in that era. ===Political career=== Postcard produced by the German-language New Yorker Volkszeitung to support the 1908 Debs-Hanford campaign. The legend reads: \\"Support the banner-bearers of the party of the working class / Vote on Election Day for the Socialist Party!\\" In 1893, a fellow printer from Philadelphia named Fred Long converted his fellow union member to the ideas of socialism. Hanford joined the dominant American socialist political organization of the day, the Socialist Labor Party (SLP). Hanford was selected to head the New York state ticket of the SLP in 1898, running for Governor of New York. In 1899, the SLP split, and Hanford left the organization with an anti-dual union faction led by Morris Hillquit and Henry Slobodin and centered around the New Yorker Volkszeitung. Hanford was nominated again in 1900 as New York gubernatorial candidate and as 1901 candidate for Mayor of New York by this breakaway political group, which named itself the \\"Social Democratic Party\\" after losing a lawsuit over use of the name and emblem of the SLP filed by the majority loyal to party leaders Daniel DeLeon and Henry Kuhn.\\"Social Democrats' Choice for City Offices: Benjamin Hanford Selected as Candidate for Mayor,\\" New York Times, June 23, 1901. In August 1901, the eastern \\"Social Democratic Party\\" of Hillquit, Slobodin, and Hanford merged with the Chicago- based Social Democratic Party of America headed by Eugene V. Debs and Victor L. Berger to form the Socialist Party of America (SPA), of which Hanford became a charter member. Hanford was tapped the New York ticket of the SPA in the November 1902, running for Governor of New York for a third time. Hanford was regarded as an effective orator who possessed both \\"a burning earnestness\\" and \\"an ability to clothe his thoughts and feelings into the simplest and most direct language.\\" This reputation, combined with his previous experience running for high office in New York state, made Hanford a majority choice among Socialist Party convention delegates to be the party's Vice-Presidential nominee in the 1904 and 1908 United States presidential elections. In addition to his efforts as a labor organizer and socialist orator and political candidate, Hanford was an effective pamphleteer, winning praise for his 1901 tract, Railroading in the United States, and making a lasting mark on the literature of American socialism with his short story \\"Jimmie Higgins,\\" lauding the silent efforts of a prototypical Socialist rank-and-file member to complete the mundane tasks that made an effective political movement possible. This character, reckoned by one commentator as \\"a veritable apotheosis of the faithful worker in the ranks,\\"\\"Ben Hanford Dies; Party Mourns Him: Sturdy Leader of \\"Big Six\\" Succumbs After a Brave Fight,\\" Chicago Daily Socialist, vol. 4, no. 78 (Jan. 26, 1910), pp. 1-2. was reprised after Hanford's death in a novel by the same title by Upton Sinclair.Upton Sinclair, Jimmie Higgins: A Story. Racine, WI: Western Printing, 1919. ===Death and legacy=== Following the close of the 1908 Socialist Party National Convention, at which he was nominated for Vice President for a second time, Hanford was stricken by \\"a virulent stomach trouble.\\" The chronic condition proved incapacitating, forcing Hanford off the campaign trail and limiting his contributions to the written word. Hanford rallied for a time following the close of the campaign, spending time and effort attempting to raise funds for the New York Call, socialist daily newspaper in New York City. On November 22, 1908, the committed 48-year-old bachelor Hanford married Alice Miriam Burnham, a fellow Socialist from New York City.\\"Socialist News Review: Ben Hanford Married,\\" St. Louis Labor, vol. 6, whole no. 412 (Dec. 26, 1908), pg. 8.; Women's Who's Who of America, A Biographical Dictionary of Contemporary Women of the United States and Canada, 1914-1915, edited by John W. Leonard (New York: The American Commonwealth Company, 1914), pg. 559. The couple made their home in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Unfortunately, Hanford's health again began to decline, taking what would ultimately prove to be its terminal turn. In 1909, with Hanford bedridden, a retrospective in his honor entitled Fight for Your Life!: Recording Some Activities of a Labor Agitator was unveiled by the Wilshire Book Company of New York, publishing house run by Wilshire's Magazine editor Gaylord Wilshire. Hanford's demise proved to be slow and painful, with his friend John C.

Finkel strayed from abstraction and used common language in his writing. He would interlace his poetry with sections taken from a wide range of works, including the writings of authors including Lenny Bruce, Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd, Albert Camus and Franz Kafka to create what The New York Times described as a \\"multilayered, sculptural bricolage through which Mr. Finkel expanded the reader's sense of what was possible in the genre.\\" Some of Finkel's best-known poems include his 1968 work Answer Back about Mammoth Cave, Adequate Earth, and his 1987 work The Wake of the Electron which was inspired by the story of sailor Donald Crowhurst, who died in 1969 while competing in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race.

Then the hand spoke, and the hand said “Let there be meaning,” and the meaning sang: “Let there be love,” and the hand shaped itself another hand of clay. Now, where there had been but one meaning, there were two. So the hands wrestled all night till they saw it was pointless. So together they shaped themselves a cunning tongue, to arbitrate. Now, where there had been two meanings, there were three. And the hands wrung one another, abashed, and the tongue took over. – Donald Finkel From: Natural Bridge ==Sculpture and death== Before his death, Finkel returned to sculpture, creating pieces from buttons, bottles and other found objects, in a process he called \\"dreckolage\\".

It is uncommon in much of its range, and has been assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than 30% since the mid 1980s. The binturong was first described by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1822. The genus Arctictis is a monotypic taxon; its morphology is similar as of the genera Paradoxurus and Paguma. The name Arctictis means 'bear-weasel', from Greek arkt- 'bear' + iktis 'weasel'.Scherren, H. (1902). The Encyclopædic Dictionary. Cassell and Company, London. In Riau, Indonesia it was known as tenturun.Wilkinson, R. J. (1901). A Malay-English dictionary Kelly & Walsh Limited, Hongkong, Shanghai and Yokohama. ==Characteristics== Skull and dentition of the binturong, as illustrated in Paul Gervais' Histoire naturelle des mammifères Binturong skeleton on display in the Museum of Osteology The binturong is long and heavy, with short, stout legs. It has a thick coat of coarse black hair. The bushy and prehensile tail is thick at the root, gradually tapering, and curls inwards at the tip. The muzzle is short and pointed, somewhat turned up at the nose, and is covered with bristly hairs, brown at the points, which lengthen as they diverge, and form a peculiar radiated circle round the face. The eyes are large, black and prominent. The ears are short, rounded, edged with white, and terminated by tufts of black hair. There are six short rounded incisors in each jaw, two canines, which are long and sharp, and six molars on each side. The hair on the legs is short and of a yellowish tinge. The feet are five-toed, with large strong claws; the soles are bare, and applied to the ground throughout the whole of their length; the hind ones are longer than the fore. In general build the binturong is essentially like Paradoxurus and Paguma but more massive in the length of the tail, legs and feet, in the structure of the scent glands and larger size of rhinarium, which is more convex with a median groove being much narrower above the philtrum. The contour hairs of the coat are much longer and coarser, and the long hairs clothing the whole of the back of the ears project beyond the tip as a definite tuft. The anterior bursa flap of the ears is more widely and less deeply emarginate. The tail is more muscular, especially at the base, and in colour generally like the body, but commonly paler at the base beneath. The body hairs are frequently partly whitish or buff, giving a speckled appearance to the pelage, sometimes so pale that the whole body is mostly straw-coloured or grey, the young being often at all events paler than the adults, but the head is always closely speckled with grey or buff. The long mystacial vibrissae are conspicuously white, and there is a white rim on the summit of the otherwise black ear. The glandular area is whitish. The tail is nearly as long as the head and body, which ranges from ; the tail is long. Some captive binturongs measured from to in head and body with a tail of . Mean weight of captive adult females is with a range from . Captive animals often weigh more than wild counterparts. Both sexes have scent glands; females on either side of the vulva, and males between the scrotum and penis. The musk glands emit an odor reminiscent of popcorn or corn chips, likely due to the volatile compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in the urine, which is also produced in the Maillard reaction at high temperatures. Unlike most other carnivorans, the male binturong does not have a baculum. ==Distribution and habitat== The binturong occurs from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Yunnan in China, and from Sumatra, Kalimantan and Java in Indonesia to Palawan in the Philippines. It is confined to tall forest. In Assam, it is common in foothills and hills with good tree cover, but less so in the forested plains. It has been recorded in Manas National Park, in Dulung and Kakoi Reserved Forests of the Lakhimpur district, in the hill forests of Karbi Anglong, North Cachar Hills, Cachar and Hailakandi Districts. In Myanmar, binturongs were photographed on the ground in Tanintharyi Nature Reserve at an elevation of , in the Hukaung Valley at elevations from , in the Rakhine Yoma Elephant Reserve at and at three other sites up to elevation. In Thailand's Khao Yai National Park, several individuals were observed feeding in a fig tree and on a vine. In Laos, they have been observed in extensive evergreen forest. In Malaysia, binturongs were recorded in secondary forest surrounding a palm estate that was logged in the 1970s. In Palawan, it inhabits primary and secondary lowland forest, including grassland–forest mosaic from sea level to . ==Taxonomy== Viverra binturong was the scientific name proposed by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1822 for a specimen from Malacca. The generic name Arctictis was proposed by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the following zoological specimens were described: *Paradoxurus albifrons proposed by Frédéric Cuvier in 1822 was based on a drawing of a binturong from Bhutan prepared by Alfred Duvaucel. *Arctictis penicillata by Temminck in 1835 were specimens from Sumatra and Java. *Arctictis whitei proposed by Joel Asaph Allen in 1910 were skins of two female binturongs collected in Palawan island, Philippines. *Arctictis pageli proposed by Ernst Schwarz in 1911 was a skin and skull of a female collected in northern Borneo. *Arctictis gairdneri proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1916 was a skull of a male binturong collected in southwestern Thailand. *Arctictis niasensis proposed by Marcus Ward Lyon Jr. in 1916 was a binturong skin from Nias island. *A. b. kerkhoveni by Henri Jacob Victor Sody in 1936 was based on specimens from Bangka Island. *A. b. menglaensis by Wang and Li in 1987 was based on specimens from Yunnan province. Nine subspecies have been recognized forming two clades. The northern clade in mainland Asia is separated from the Sundaic clade by the Isthmus of Kra. ==Ecology and behavior== Binturong photographed by a camera trap at a feeding platform on a fruiting Ficus The Binturong is active during the day and at night. Three sightings in Pakke Tiger Reserve were by day.Datta, A. (1999). Small carnivores in two protected areas of Arunachal Pradesh. Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 96: 399–404. Thirteen camera trap photograph events in Myanmar involved one around dusk, seven in full night and five in broad daylight. All photographs were of single animals, and all were taken on the ground. As binturongs are not very nimble, they may have to descend to the ground relatively frequently when moving between trees. Five radio-collared binturongs in the Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary exhibited an arrhythmic activity dominated by crepuscular and nocturnal tendencies with peaks in the early morning and late evening. Reduced inactivity periods occurred from midday to late afternoon. They moved between and daily in the dry season and increased their daily movement to in the wet season. Ranges sizes of males varied between and . Two males showed slightly larger ranges in the wet season. Their ranges overlapped between 30–70%. The average home range of a radio-collared female in the Khao Yai National Park was estimated at , and the one of a male at .Austin, S. C. (2002). Ecology of sympatric carnivores in the Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. PhD thesis, Texas University. The binturong is essentially arboreal. Pocock observed the behaviour of several captive individuals in the London Zoological Gardens. When resting they lie curled up, with the head tucked under the tail. They seldom leaped, but climbed skillfully, albeit slowly, progressing with equal ease and confidence along the upper side of branches or, upside down, beneath them. The prehensile tail was always ready as a help. They descended the vertical bars of the cage head first, gripping them between their paws and using the prehensile tail as a check. When irritated they growled fiercely. When on the prowl they periodically uttered a series of low grunts or a hissing sound made by expelling air through partially opened lips. The binturong uses the tail to communicate. It moves about gently, often coming to a stop, and often using the tail to keep balance, clinging to a branch. It shows a pronounced comfort behaviour associated with grooming the fur, shaking and licking the hair, and scratching. Shaking is the most characteristic element of comfort behaviour.Rozhnov, V. V. (1994). Notes on the behaviour and ecology of the Binturong (Arctictis binturong) in Vietnam. Small Carnivore Conservation 10 : 4–5. The species is normally quite shy, but aggressive when harassed. It is reported to initially urinate or defecate on a threat and then, if teeth- baring and snarling does not deter the threat, it uses its powerful jaws and teeth in self-defense. When threatened, the binturong will usually flee into a nearby tree, but as a defense mechanism the binturong may sometimes balance on its tail and flash its claws to appear threatening to potential predators. Predation on adult binturong is reportedly quite rare by sympatric species like leopard, clouded leopard and reticulated python.Ismail, M. A. Hj. (??). Binturong . Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia === Diet === The binturong is omnivorous, feeding on small mammals, birds, fish, earthworms, insects and fruits. It also preys on rodents. Fish and earthworms are likely unimportant items in its diet, as it is neither aquatic nor fossorial, coming across such prey only when opportunities present themselves. Since it does not have the attributes of a predatory mammal, most of the binturong's diet is probably of vegetable matter. Figs are a major component of its diet. Captive binturongs are particularly fond of plantains, but also eat fowls' heads and eggs. The binturong is an important agent for seed dispersal, especially for those of the strangler fig, because of its ability to scarify the seed's tough outer covering. In captivity, the binturong's diet includes commercially prepared meat mix, bananas, apples, oranges, canned peaches and mineral supplement. ===Reproduction=== The average age of sexual maturation is 30.4 months for females and 27.7 months for males. The estrous cycle of the binturong lasts 18 to 187 days, with an average of 82.5 days. Gestation lasts 84 to 99 days. Litter size in captivity varies from one to six young, with an average of two young per birth. Neonates weigh between , and are often referred to as . Fertility lasts until 15 years of age. The maximum known lifespan in captivity is thought to be over 25 years of age.Macdonald, D.W. (2009). The Encyclopedia of Mammals. Oxford University Press, Oxford. ==Threats== Young binturong kept as a pet by Orang Asli at Taman Negara, Malaysia Major threats to the binturong are habitat loss and degradation of forests through logging and conversion of forests to non-forest land-uses throughout the binturong's range. Habitat loss has been severe in the lowlands of the Sundaic part of its range, and there is no evidence that the binturong uses the plantations that are largely replacing natural forest. In China, rampant deforestation and opportunistic logging practices have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated sites altogether. In the Philippines, it is captured for the wildlife trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption. In Laos, it is one of the most frequently displayed caged live carnivores and skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane. In parts of Laos, it is considered a delicacy and also traded as a food item to Vietnam. The Orang Asli of Malaysia keep binturong as pets. == Conservation == India included the binturong in CITES Appendix III and in Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act 1973, so that it has the highest level of protection. In China, it is listed as critically endangered. It is completely protected in Bangladesh, and partially in Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Licensed hunting of binturong is allowed in Indonesia, and it is not protected in Brunei. World Binturong Day, an event dedicated to binturong awareness and conservation, takes place yearly every second Saturday of May. === In captivity === Captive binturong at the Cincinnati Zoo Binturongs are common in zoos, and captive individuals represent a source of genetic diversity essential for long-term conservation. Their geographic origin is either usually unknown, or they are offspring of several generations of captive-bred animals. ==References* * Category:Viverrids Category:Carnivorans of Asia Category:Mammals of Bangladesh Category:Mammals of Bhutan Category:Mammals of China Category:Mammals of India Category:Mammals of Southeast Asia Category:Carnivorans of Malaysia Category:Vulnerable fauna of Asia Category:Mammals described in 1821 ","title":"Binturong"},{"id":"20352311","text":"Along RiverWalk, New River, Fort Lauderdale, Florida Riverwalk, also known as the Fort Lauderdale Riverwalk, is a riverwalk along New River in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Despite huge exposure prior to its premiere, Bajo la misma piel was only a moderate success in its country of origin, Mexico, and was a virtual flop during its airing on Univision in the United States. On September 15, 2003, Canal de las Estrellas started broadcasting Bajo la misma piel weekdays at 5:00pm, replacing Atrévete a Olvidarme. The last episode was broadcast on January 16, 2004 with Amar otra vez replacing it the following day. Kate del Castillo and Juan Soler starred as protagonists, while Susana Zabaleta, Alejandro Camacho and Laisha Wilkins starred as antagonists. ==Plot== Sara's marriage to Bruno Murillo makes her life hell on earth. Bruno, a harsh fifty-year-old man who cheats on Sara and firmly believes that money can buy everything, even love. Sara represses her frustration and sacrifices her happiness in order to give her children, Miranda, Andres, and Paula, a stable home. To make matters worse for Sara, Bruno will not let her divorce him. Just when Sara has resigned herself to living without love, Joaquin, the love of her life, returns. Although Sara's daughter Miranda is a vivacious and intelligent young woman, she has fallen in love with a man similar to Bruno. Her fiancé, Patricio, is an ambitious and hypocritical man who cheats on her with her sister Paula. While Bruno supports Miranda's engagement because Patricio is his best friend's son, Sara fears for their daughter's future. When she meets Alejandro, Miranda questions her feelings for Patricio because Alejandro and she share a strong attraction. Although there are countless obstacles between them, they are determined to fight for their happiness. Regina, Sara's sister who lives with her, was once a virtuous young lady who believed in love, but her fiancé abandoned her a few days before their wedding. Nowadays Regina wants to follow just one rule: single men only. However, Regina falls in love with Eugenio, her friend's husband, and finds that she cannot control her passion. Sara's and Regina's mother, Esther, is the only woman in the family who has experienced true love with her husband. Although she has lost her battle against cancer, Esther does not fall into depression. With vigor and optimism she continues to support her children and granddaughter, hoping to give them the strength to find and fight for true love. ==Cast== *Kate del Castillo as Miranda Murillo Ortiz *Juan Soler as Alejandro Ruiz Calderón *Diana Bracho as Sara Ortiz Escalante de Murillo *Alejandro Tomassi as Eugenio Rioja *Alejandro Camacho as Bruno Murillo Valdez *Susana Zabaleta as Ivonne Acosta *Manuel Ojeda as Rodrigo Leyva *Azela Robinson as Regina Ortiz Escalante *Victor Noriega as Gabriel Ornelas *Pedro Armendáriz, Jr. as Joaquín Vidaurri *Marga López as Esther Escalante de Ortiz *Lupita Lara as Rebeca de Barraza *Mariana Karr as Alina Calderón de Ruiz *Laisha Wilkins as Paula Beltrán Ortiz *Sergio Catalán as Patricio Leyva *Ernesto D'Alessio as Andrés Murillo Ortiz *Isadora González as Norma Rioja *Andrea Torre as Roberta Barraza *Alejandro Aragón as Marcos Ruiz Calderón *Tiaré Scanda as Aurora Romero *David Ostrosky as Jaime Sandoval *Yolanda Ventura as Macarena Montiel *Alfonso Iturralde as José María Barraza *Adriana Roel as Blanca Rioja *Elizabeth Dupeyrón as Ángela Quintero *Lorenzo de Rodas as Agustín Ruiz Cañedo *María Marcela as Sonia *Mauricio Bonet as Darío Portillo *Paola Cantú as Mónica Gutiérrez *Andrés Garza as Santiago Morales Acosta *Marifer Sasián as Triana Sandoval Romero *Polo Ortín as Nicky *Manuel Landeta as Ramiro Morales *Claudio Báez as Lic.

More generators were added as electricity demand grew and the transmission system extended to reach Rangiora in the north and Oamaru in the south. By the early 1930s, Coleridge had reached capacity, and was supplemented in 1934 by the commissioning of the Waitaki Dam and in 1935 by extending transmission lines south to join Coleridge/Waitaki to Dunedin's Waipori scheme. ==See also== *Electricity sector in New Zealand ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *TrustPower - Coleridge Power Station information *New Zealand Electricity information pamphlet 18787A-73 A - Lake Coleridge power station, 1973 pamphlet.

The office was first created in October 1786, before the arrival of the First Fleet, to act as a deputy to the first governor, Arthur Phillip. At that time the Lieutenant-Governor, or its equivalent of \\"Administrator of the Government\\", was filled by military officers and was a position only created when needed or in times of long absences by the Governor. Since 1872 this office has been held concurrently by the Chief Justice of New South Wales but the position may be retained by the Chief Justice after their retirement from the Supreme Court of New South Wales. == Role == Originally, the lieutenant-governor had a legislative role with a seat on the first Legislative Council of New South Wales in 1824; this was later phased out due to the lessening of the powers of the state governor. The role of the governors are enshrined in part 2A of the New South Wales Constitution Act (1902). The office itself has no standing powers but holds a dormant commission to act in the governor's position when needed. The current role of the lieutenant-governor is to take up the duties of the governor if the governor dies, resigns, or is absent such as in September 2008, when, in the absence of Governor Marie Bashir, the Lieutenant-Governor, James Spigelman, administered the swearing in of the new cabinet of the Nathan Rees government. If the Lieutenant-Governor becomes incapacitated while serving in the office of governor or is absent when the Governor is also absent, the next most senior judge of the Supreme Court is sworn in as the Administrator. This occurred in May 1973 when Sir Leslie Herron died suddenly while the governor, Sir Roden Cutler was overseas. Sir John Kerr became the administrator until Cutler was able to return.Personal Details Sir John Kerr, State Records of NSW.

The Goldpanners were charter members of the Alaska Baseball League at the league's inception in 1974. The Goldpanners play their home games at Growden Memorial Park in Fairbanks, Alaska, United States. They also host the annual Midnight Sun Game at their home venue. Like other amateur collegiate summer baseball teams, the Goldpanners operate in a similar manner to professional minor league organizations: playing a nightly schedule, using wooden bats, and with lengthy road trips facing advanced competition. Facing a unique challenge due to Fairbanks' isolated location, the Goldpanners often play teams from the rest of Alaska and the West Coast of the Lower 48. ==History== Founded by H. A.

By pointing out Chinese Communist Party's priorities, i.e, self-preservation, stability and economic growth, Ringen argues that what concerns Party the most is the lack of political legitimacy. Rignen creates a word \\"controlocracy\\" to describe Party's governance through censorship and stability management etc. It does not depend on commanding most people in their daily lives and is able to mostly rely on their acquiescence and self-censorship. Ringen also believes that China's achievement is overestimated because of its bigness. From Ringen's point of view, \\"China Dream\\" is a dangerous ideology promoted by the Party because it makes national greatness and individual happiness inseparable. Based on the fact that China's economic growth is slowing down and social freedom is deteriorating, Ringen predicts that China may become a new Nazi state under Communist Party's consolidating power and absolute rule. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Faith in freedom (2011)—article ==External links== *External link Category:Norwegian sociologists Category:Fellows of Green Templeton College, Oxford Category:Academics of the University of Oxford Category:University of Paris faculty Category:1945 births Category:Living people ","title":"Stein Ringen"},{"id":"20352648","text":"Michael Ward (1939 – 2008) was a British economist and statistician who contributed significantly to the evolution of the international statistical system in the post-war period. ==Education and career== Ward took an honours degree in statistics and economics at the University of Exeter in 1958 and was later awarded his Master of Arts at the University of Cambridge. In 1965 he was elected fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge, and worked as Director of Economic Studies. He served as dean of the college from 1970 to 1972. In 1975 he was appointed Director of the Statistical Program at the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex. At both at Cambridge and Sussex he worked with some of the foremost development economists of the time, including Richard Jolly, Graham Pyatt, Dudley Seers, and Richard Stone—people who, as Ward observed in his book Quantifying the World, \\"abhorred any suggestion that facts be fit to theory and spent their lives building theory around observed facts and creating frameworks that more usefully depicted how the real world worked.\\" Ward worked in many developing countries and gained wide experience of statistics and their use in framing policies for economic and social development. He started work in 1961 in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) in what was then the Statistical Office of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. A few years later he worked in the statistical office of Lesotho and from there moved to Fiji, where he was Head of the Government Statistical Service. From 1972 he worked for UNESCO as a regional statistical advisor in southern Africa, an assignment that took him to Lesotho, Botswana, Malawi, Swaziland, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. From 1999 to 2000 he worked in Phnom Penh as Director of Rehabilitation and Economic Advisor in the UN peacekeeping mission to Cambodia. During his career, Ward worked with other international agencies including the Food and Agriculture Organization, International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development. His links with the OECD began in the early 1970s. He participated in workshops on statistics in developing countries at the OECD Development Centre.

It is the first novel in the Heritage Trilogy. ==Plot introduction== Set in 2040, the United States finds itself among a hostile world with only Britain, Russia, and Japan as reluctant allies. The dominant force in the world today is the United Nations, which has evolved into a world government and is challenging the US as the world’s sole superpower, motivated for the “greater good.” It has invaded Brazil because of Brazil’s lack of care for the rainforest and it wants the US to give up part of the southwest America for a Hispanic nation known as Aztlán. The UN capital is located at Geneva, Switzerland. ==Plot summary== The United States and Russia have set up habitats on Mars, and are researching ruins of an alien civilization near the Face on Mars. The facilities and research are being shared with UN observers. When the UN sends troops up to Mars, the US sends the Marine Mars Expeditionary Force, a 30-man weapons platoon, to protect American civilians and interests on Mars. The United States Marine Corps has been threatened with being disbanded and it hopes that this mission will breathe some life into the organization. Back on Earth, tensions increase between the UN and the US when the US Embassy in Mexico City is stormed by militants backed by the Mexican government and the Marines stationed there are forced to open fire. The US is able to evacuate the personnel there, but not before the diplomatic damage was done. It is the events on Mars, however, which cause war to begin between the United States and the UN. American scientists discover human remains inside one of the alien structures. From evidence discovered at the site it appears that these aliens not only were in contact with humans in the past, but may have even been responsible for the creation of the human race itself. The Americans want to release the information at once but the UN forces think differently, afraid that the world could not handle information of this magnitude. The UN forces take over the Mars station, imprisoning the Marines and the scientists, while contacting their superiors about what was found. At the same time UN forces capture the International Space Station, to control any and all launches to Mars, while the UN leadership increases diplomatic pressure on the American government. This act kicks off hostilities on Earth. The official reason, according to the UN, is to support the independence of the Aztlan nation, among other reasons, but secretly the UN wants to stop the US from monopolizing alien technology and releasing the controversial findings. The United States finds itself under bombardment from cruise missiles launched from Cuba as well as French, German and Manchurian arsenal ships. Simultaneously forces from Mexico and Quebec cross the border to invade. At the same time Russia, one of America's few remaining allies, is attacked all along its southern border by Manchuria. Morale is low and the President is considering surrendering to the UN. Meanwhile, US Marines recapture the ISS with the help of Shepard Station, an experimental laser armed space station. The UN orders the reluctant Japanese to attack Shepard Station. Though they succeed in disabling it, the Japanese lose all of their fighters and decide to join the Americans and their allies against the UN. Back on Mars, the Marines are able to escape their imprisonment, but are forced to march across hundreds of miles of Martian desert to reach the UN base. The Marines defeat the UN force at Mars Prime with a surprise attack. They go on to capture Cydonia and defeat the remaining UN troops using smuggled cans of beer as an improvised weapon. The march across Mars soon becomes a famous piece of Marine Corps history. On Earth the fighting is beginning to turn to the United States’ favor. ==Characters== *Major Mark Alan Garroway, USMC *Dr. David Alexander *Kaitlin Garroway *1st Lt Carmen Fuentes, USMC *Frank Kaminski *General Montgomery Warhurst, USMC ==Literary significance and reception== The CNN review called the novel \\"well researched, and quite imaginative\\" with \\"compelling battle sequences\\" and also at times even evoking \\"sentimental pride for the USMC.\\" On SFRevu, Ernest Lilley said the novel was similar to a Tom Clancy techno-thriller with its well constructed and plausible world political situation. Though praising Douglas for his depiction of extraterrestrial combat he found it disappointing that the alien artifacts had such a low profile. ==References *Semper Mars on Library Thing * *Semper Mars on Google Books Category:1998 American novels Category:1998 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels about ancient astronauts Category:Novels set on Mars Category:Military science fiction novels Category:Space marines Category:Novels by Ian Douglas Category:Popular culture about the United States Marine Corps Category:HarperCollins books Category:Fiction set in 2040 Category:Fictional deserts ","title":"Semper Mars"},{"id":"20352669","text":"George William Church Sr. (February 10, 1903 – May 17, 1956) was an American businessman, the founder of Church's Chicken.

It opened in 1909 as Shepparton Agricultural High School – the first high school in Shepparton and one of the first public high schools in Victoria. It closed in December 2019 to make way for the construction of Greater Shepparton Secondary College, which is scheduled to open in 2022. ==History== The school was first opened on 20 April 1909 as Shepparton Agricultural High School, with a roll of 31 students. The Governor of Victoria, Sir Thomas Gibson-Carmichael, formally opened the school a month later, on the 20th of May. The ceremony was attended by the Director of Education, Frank Tate, the Minister for Education, Alfred Billson, the Minister for Agriculture, George Graham, the Clerk of Parliaments, Sir George Jenkins, and various others. It was the first high school in Shepparton, and one of the first public high schools in the state of Victoria. As one of the ten agricultural high schools created from 1907 to 1912, its agricultural aspect was intended to address a perceived need for better technical education in rural Victoria following the nationwide depression of the 1890s. To this end, each school was supplied with agricultural equipment and farmland with which to teach these skills. While Victoria's first high schools were vocational in name, their curriculum was still considerably academic. Besides the agricultural course, a more general course was also available to students, and was seen as a continuation of the state's existing primary education system. A lack of local interest in the agricultural course meant that it did not last long. By 1914, only 9 of the 129 students enrolled at the school were taking the course. It was eventually replaced by a single subject, Agricultural Science, requiring little practical work, and by 1918, even the word \\"Agricultural\\" had been semi-officially dropped from the school's name. The school's farm fared better, proving valuable to the farmers and horticulturists of the area through its agricultural experiments. The farm also made a profit, which was unique among Victoria's agricultural high schools, and ensured its continued support throughout the 1920s. The Great Depression of the 1930s saw an end to that success, and the farmland was finally put up for sale in 1939. ==Sports== The SHS Football Club's under 14s played in three consecutive grand finals (2004–2006), winning in 2005 and 2006. ==Notable alumni== * Gail Gago * Frank McNamara * Francis Palmer Selleck * Richard Pratt (Australian Businessman) * Jarman Impey (AFL Footballer) * Steven King (AFL Footballer) * Adem Yze (AFL Footballer) * Adam Briggs (Australian Musician) * Jarrod Lyle (Professional Golfer) ==References * Category:1909 establishments in Australia Category:Educational institutions established in 1909 Category:Public high schools in Victoria (Australia) Category:Shepparton ","title":"Shepparton High School"},{"id":"20352933","text":"Charlene Pesquiera is a Democratic politician from the US state of Arizona.

She served as an Arizona State Senator from 2006–2010 and as an Arizona State Representative from 2003–2006 for District 24. In May 2012, Aguirre announced that she was entering the race to represent Arizona's 3rd congressional district. ==Personal life== Aguirre has been involved in public health education and administration. She has put a strong emphasis on the health issues involved with the U.S.-Mexico border. Aguirre lives in Yuma, Arizona. Her lifelong commitment is aimed at education since she was raised by parents who were both elementary school teachers. Her parents had a large influence on her political ideologies and from them she developed her Democratic values to serve her community. In her free time, Aguirre enjoys traveling, reading, playing guitar, kayaking on the Colorado River, and spending time with her significant other and cat “Nafta.” ==Education== Aguirre obtained a B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Sonora in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. In 1981, she received her master's degree from California State University, Los Angeles, in Nutrition, with a focus on feeding problems of children with developmental disabilities. ==Career== Aguirre became the first female and first Hispanic to represent District 24 (Yuma and La Paz Counties) in the Arizona State House of Representatives on February 2003, when the Yuma County Board of Supervisors appointed her to the 46th Arizona State Legislature. She was later elected to serve in the House of Representatives for a full term a year later, and the Arizona State Senate in 2006, where she has served ever since. Aguirre has had great success in passing key bi-partisan legislation. One of her latest and most popular bills established an Autism Task Force legislative committee to review the coordination of services provided by state agencies, schools and organizations relating to the treatment of persons with autism spectrum disorder and recommend solutions for improvement of these services. On a similar note, she was also the champion of legislation passed in 2008 coined “Steven’s Law,” which requires private medical insurance companies to provide Autism intervention service coverage under their insurance plan benefits. Aguirre was appointed by Governor Jan Brewer to serve on her 5-member bipartisan Advisory Group for Behavioral Health, a committee made up of two Senators, two Representatives to address structural reform and challenges faced by the state in administering and delivering behavioral health services. In 2008 and 2009 Senator Aguirre was appointed to co-chair the In-Home Care Study Committee, which made her the only Democrat to co-chair a joint legislative committee in a Republican controlled legislature.

It was adapted into the 2009 feature film of the same name starring George Clooney. ==Plot summary== Ryan Bingham is a 35-year-old career transition counselor for a Denver-based management consulting company, Integrated Strategic Management (ISM). He is divorced and his disturbed younger sister is about to embark on yet another disastrous relationship. He flies around the country firing and then counseling recently laid-off people for reentering the job market. Bingham inhabits a world of Palm Pilots, rental cars, salted almonds, Kevlar luggage and nameless suite hotels where e-mail and voicemail are the communication norm. He takes a lot of pills and spends time with women in Las Vegas. Bingham is trying to get to one million frequent flyer miles, a number only reached by nine other people in the same mileage club (from the fictional airline Great West). Before his boss returns from vacation, Bingham files his letter of resignation and cancels his company credit card. Bingham is positioning himself to be hired by MythTech, a shadowy company based in Omaha, Nebraska. Bingham fears that someone may be furtively cashing in his precious miles, which would be tantamount to stealing his soul. ==Writing== Kirn wrote the book in rural Montana during a snowbound winter on a ranch while thinking about airports, airplanes and about a particular conversation he had with another passenger in a first-class cabin. That passenger stated that he used to have an apartment in Atlanta but never used it. He got a storage locker instead, since he stayed in hotels and was on the road 300 days a year. He considered the flight crew to be like family, and indicated that he knew the flight attendant by name and knew her kids' names. ==Film adaptation== Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner adapted this novel into a 2009 award-winning feature film starring George Clooney. The film was critically acclaimed and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. ==Sales== The book received some good reviews and initially sold well until September 11, 2001 when sales slowed to a near halt. The cover with a cartoon of flying businesspeople (presumably reminiscent of The Falling Man) one of them on fire and hurtling earthward also hurt sales. Sales of the book were revived following Jason Reitman's film adaptation. ==NotesReferences== Category:2001 American novels Category:American satirical novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Aviation novels Category:Doubleday (publisher) books ","title":"Up in the Air (novel)"},{"id":"20353081","text":"Antonios Matesis Andreas Laskaratos Bust of Lorentzos Mavilis in Athens Aristotelis Valaoritis The term Heptanese School of literature (, literally: \\"The School of the Seven Islands\\", also known as the Ionian School) denotes the literary production of the Ionian Island's literature figures from the late 18th century till the end of the 19th century.

The Michigan Wolverines defeated the Oregon State Beavers by a score of 34-7\\\\. Michigan fullback Mel Anthony was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game. ==TeamsMichigan=== The Wolverines had finished seventh in the Big Ten Conference the previous year, and had placed no higher than a tie for fifth under coach Bump Elliott. Michigan had not been to the Rose Bowl since 1951, but in 1964, they ran up an 8-1 conference record and clinched a Rose Bowl berth, taking a #4 ranking and an undefeated 3–0 postseason record into the game. Coach Elliott had been a receiver for the Wolverines in one of those games, the 1948 Rose Bowl, and had been an assistant coach at Oregon State under head coach Kip Taylor. ===Oregon State=== The Beavers made their third Rose Bowl appearance with a bit of controversy. Following the disbanding of the Pacific Coast Conference in 1959 due to a pay-for-play scandal, the reformed Athletic Association of Western Universities did not initially include Oregon State and Oregon. The two Oregon schools rejoined in time for the 1964 season, but the conference did not have time to reschedule a full head-to-head conference schedule. As a result, Oregon State and USC did not play each other, and when they finished with identical 3-1 conference records, the decision of which team to send to Pasadena was left to a vote among the conference's schools. At first, most people assumed Oregon State would get the nod based on their better overall record (8-2 vs. 6-3). However, when it was announced that the vote would be delayed until after USC's season ending game with top ranked and undefeated Notre Dame, many people inferred that if USC upset the Irish, they would get the nod. Indeed, USC shocked Notre Dame 20-17 so now many people assumed USC would get the Rose Bowl invitation. When the vote was taken just hours after the USC - Notre Dame game, the conferences' eight members split, four votes for both Oregon State and USC. The tiebreaker in such an instance was to eliminate the team that had more recently gone to the Rose Bowl, and Southern California had gone two years prior. This would lead to another controversy just two years later in which an 8-2 USC team that had lost to UCLA would get voted in ahead of the 9-1 Bruins. Many felt this 1966 vote was to \\"make up for\\" the 1964 vote, especially since the coach of Oregon State in 1964 was Tommy Prothro and he was then the coach of UCLA in 1966. ==Game summary== Michigan was an 11-point favorite, but after a scoreless first quarter, it was the Beavers who struck first, with Paul Brothers completing a five-yard pass to Doug McDougal early in the second quarter, with Steve Clark kicking the extra point. The Beavers held the Wolverines for a while, but on their third possession following the Beavers' score, tailback Mel Anthony ran 84 yards, a Rose Bowl record at the time, for a touchdown. Richard Sygar's kick was no good. The Beavers' 7-6 advantage was short-lived, however, as on the very next possession, Carl Ward ran for 43 yards and a touchdown. While the conversion pass from Bob Timberlake to Ben Farabee was broken up, the Wolverines led 12-7 at the half. The second half was all Michigan. Anthony blocked a punt and rushed for two more touchdowns in the third quarter, and quarterback Timberlake ran 24 yards for the final touchdown, making the final score 34-7\\\\. For his efforts, Anthony was named the game's Most Outstanding Player. ===Scoring=== First quarter None. Second quarter *Oregon State - Doug McDougal 5 pass from Paul Brothers (Steve Clark kick) *Michigan - Mel Anthony 84 run (Richard Sygar kick failed) *Michigan - Carl Ward 43 run (pass failed) Third quarter *Michigan — Anthony 1 run (Bob Timberlake run) *Michigan - Anthony 8 run (Timberlake kick) Fourth quarter *Michigan - Timberlake 24 run (Sygar kick) ==Aftermath== With the game, Michigan ended its 14-year postseason drought, to date their longest string of seasons without a bowl game. However, it was the last bowl game Elliott would coach; he resigned following the 1968 season after a 50-14 loss to archrival Ohio State. This was the Beavers' last bowl game appearance for 34 years, and to date, remains their last appearance in the Rose Bowl. Soon after the game, Beaver coach Tommy Prothro left Oregon State to coach UCLA, and took them to the following year's Rose Bowl, in which the Bruins defeated Michigan State. ==References * Summary at Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan Athletics History Rose Bowl Category:Rose Bowl Game Category:Michigan Wolverines football bowl games Category:Oregon State Beavers football bowl games Rose Bowl Category:January 1965 sports events ","title":"1965 Rose Bowl"},{"id":"20353107","text":"The is a prehistoric people known from bones found in the Pinza-Abu Cave, near Ueno in Miyako Island, southern Japan. The remains appear to have the modern man anatomical type and have been dated to about 30,000 years ago, i.e. 25,800 ± 900 and 26,800 ± 1,300 before present. The name \\"Pinza-Abu\\" literally means \\"goat cave\\" in the local Miyako language. ==Findings== Between 1974 and 1989, expeditions and surveys were done on six occasions at the Pinza-Abu cave site. The bones found were measured and compared to recent Japanese and the Minatogawa Man. The occipital and supernumerary bones have been reconstructed from the few fragments found to create a nearly complete squama. The occipital squama has especially large features in the sagittal arcs, compared to that of modern Japanese. The right parietal bone has been found largely intact, with only minor fragments missing. Characteristics in the sagittal dimension, however, are much smaller compared to the modern Japanese. This small feature of the range of parietals is also seen in the Minatogawa skulls. The vertebra found was determined to be much smaller than recent Japanese vertebrae, but shared similarities with the Minatogawa Man. As shown in the measurements, some of archaic physical features possessed by the Pinza-Abu Cave Man are shared by the Minatogawa Man, which may suggest close physical and biological between the two. Both groups of people have lived in the Ryukyu Islands, so they may have shared a close relationship, both from interacting with one another. This suggests they belonged in the same time and space. However, very little is still known about the origin of the Pinza-Abu people, in their migration and how they came to be isolated. According to some scholars, the Pinza-Abu Cave Man may have arrived to Miyako Island from the Malaysia during the Stone Age, due to physical similarities with the Wadjak Man. There are also speculations that the Pinza-Abu Cave Man is the descendant of the Java man. From this, since the Java man was already known to have produced fire, it can be thought that the Pinza-Abu Cave Man also possessed those skills. In 1989, surveys found charcoal with the human remains, which may reveal more about their lifestyle and technological advancements. There is still, however, no evidence that links the Pinza-Abu cave man as the ancestor of people living on Miyako Island today. Along with human remains, the mammalian fauna found in soil deposits of the site, which may reveal more about the diet of the Pinza- Abu Cave Man. The dating technique used to determine the timeline from measuring the fluorine content of bones through an ion-selective electrode. Carbon-14 dating was also used in dating the bones. These techniques have determined the fauna to have come from around the time of the Late Pleistocene. In the oldest stratigraphic layer, deer bones were found and dated to 30,000 years BP. In the next layer, both deer and boar bones were found and dated between 15,000 and 20,000 years BP. The uppermost layer, which is also the more recent, only had boar bones. Today, these two species, along with several other mammalian species that have previously existed on Miyako Island, are now extinct there. The Pinza-Abu Cave Man was also discovered with stone tools, so they are thought to have already been adept with those skills. Miyako Island did not have large mammals, so much of the hunting is believed to be done individually or very small groups. This leads some researchers to believe that the Pinza-Abu people lived primarily in small, familial groups. ==See also== * Minatogawa Man * Yamashita Cave Man * Shiraho Saonetabaru Cave Ruins * History of the Ryukyus ==References== Category:Archaeology of Japan Category:Upper Paleolithic Homo sapiens fossils Category:Peopling of East Asia Category:Paleolithic Japan ","title":"Pinza-Abu Cave Man"},{"id":"20353129","text":"is a Japanese butterfly swimmer. ==Major achievements== 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships * 100m butterfly 2nd (52.59) * 4×100m medley relay 2nd (3:35.70) 2007 World Championships * 50m butterfly 10th (24.03) * 100m butterfly 23rd (53.53) ==Personal bests== In long course * 50m butterfly: 23.45 Japanese Record (April 16, 2009) * 100m butterfly: 52.43 (April 20, 2008) In short course * 50m butterfly: 23.04 (March 16, 2008) * 100m butterfly: 49.90 Asian, Japanese Record (March 8, 2009) ==References== * http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/japan2007/pc/players/0020.html Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese male swimmers Category:Male butterfly swimmers Category:People from Kanagawa Prefecture Category:World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming Category:Asian Games medalists in swimming Category:Swimmers at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Universiade medalists in swimming Category:Asian Games silver medalists for Japan Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Universiade bronze medalists for Japan Category:Medalists at the 2003 Summer Universiade ","title":"Ryo Takayasu"},{"id":"20353132","text":"Chopy Fatah (, ; born June 10, 1983) is a contemporary Kurdish singer.

The result of this was that thousands of Chopy's (Asia Cell) billboards were placed around Iraq. Chopy has performed in Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Greece, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates. In the Kurdish populated areas of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Armenia and Azerbaijan, she is one of the most famous singers (according to Turkish newspaper Habertürk ). Thousands of her CDs have been sold around the world.

Thus she gave concerts throughout Kurdistan: in Diyarbakir (Amed), Batman, Arbil (Erbil/Hawler), Qamishlo, Sulaimaniyah and Van. Chopy was one of the first singers to perform in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk after the fall off Saddam's dictatorship. Chopy stated that she did so because of her love for her hometown and her many fans (according to the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad). Many of Chopy Fatah's concerts and music events have been attended by important Iraqi and Kurdish politicians like the President of the Republic of Iraq, Jalal Talabani and the president of the Kurdistan Region, Massoud Barzani. Chopy Fatah during the 'One Young World' summit 2013 in South Africa Chopy supported in 2009 the Democratic Society Party DTP (the current BDP Peace and Democracy Party) by sending an official letter to its leader Ahmet Türk where she explained that she will do everything in her power to support the peaceful solution of the Kurdish issue in Turkey (North-Kurdistan). “As a Kurdish artist I want to show my support to the solution of the Kurdish question in North-Kurdistan (Southeast Turkey).” Chopy said she is willing to give free concerts in Diyarbakır (Amed), Cizîr, Batman and other cities to support peace. Chopy was one of the Kurdish singers that held concerts in Iraqi Kurdistan to raise money for the Kurdish victims of the Van earthquake that struck the city in southeastern Turkey in October 2011 (2011 Van earthquake). On 21 March 2013 she held a performance in the Turkish Kurdistani city of Diyarbakır (Amed) in front of 2 million people to support peace and freedom for the Kurds in Turkey. In October 2013 Chopy was chosen to be the Kurdish flag bearer for the One Young World Summit' in Johannesburg, South Africa. The Kurdish flag was for the first time hoisted at the event, alongside flags of 190 other countries attending the summit. ==Advertisement== Chopy's music & advertisement videos are played on different TV channels in the Middle East: * Qatar – Arabic 25px : Al Jazeera * Iraq – Arabic 25px : Al Arabiya, Al Sharqiya, Al-Baghdadia TV, Al Iraqiya and Al Sumaria * Iraq – Kurdish 25px 25px : Kurdistan TV, KurdSat, Kurdish News Network (KNN), Zagros TV, Gali Kurdistan, Kanal4, KOREK TV, VIN TV, Kurdmax, NRT2, Rudaw TV * UAE – Arabic 25px : Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC) * UAE – Persian 25px : Persian Music Channel (PMC) * Iran – Kurdish 25px 25px : TISHK TV, Rojhelat TV, KBC, Newroz TV, KLIK SAT, KOMALA TV * Turkey – Kurdish 25px 25px : Roj TV, Sterk TV, MMC TV, TRT 6, Kurd1 Channel, Dünya TV, * Lebanon and Egypt – Arabic 25px 25px : Melody Music * Syria – Kurdish 25px 25px : Ronahî TV ==Discography2003 – Çît Naw Binêm=== * 02.

Louisville would continue strong play, going undefeated in January and winning its first eight conference games before losing to #1 Connecticut on February 2. After beating St. John's, Louisville lost by their most lopsided margin since joining the Big East, a 33-point drubbing by Notre Dame. After that game, Louisville won its final seven regular season games to win the school's first ever regular season Big East championship. == Big East Tournament == By virtue of their outright regular-season title, Louisville received a double-bye in the Big East Tournament and played their first game in the tournament quarterfinals. In the tournament, Louisville beat Providence 73–55 in the quarterfinals and #10 Villanova 69–55 in the semifinals to advance to the school's first ever Big East Tournament championship game in four seasons in the conference. In the finals, Louisville won its first Big East Tournament Championship, defeating #18 Syracuse 76–66. Due to losses in the early conference tournament rounds by several teams above them, the Cardinals finished #1 in the final regular season AP and coaches' polls—the first time in school history they have been ranked #1 in either poll. ==NCAA tournament== Louisville was awarded the top seed in the NCAA Tournament Midwest Region, as well as the overall #1 seed in the tournament. This is Louisville's second ever 1-seed. The Cardinals beat Morehead St. and Siena in the first two tournament rounds, advancing to face Arizona in the Sweet 16 on March 27. After beating Arizona by 39 points, Louisville faced Michigan St. in the Elite Eight and lost 64–52. == Roster == {  style=\\"text- align: center;\\" - ! Name ! # ! Position ! Height ! Weight !

It is an Arizona state park in the city of Yuma, Arizona, US. The Yuma Quartermaster Depot was an important quartermaster depot during the 1870s. Goods were shipped up the Colorado River from the Gulf of California and stored at Yuma for distribution to the desert frontier forts in the Southwestern United States territories. ==History== Yuma Quartermaster Depot State Historic Park is on the grounds of the former Yuma Quartermaster Depot. The depot was established by the U.S. Army in 1864 to store and distribute supplies to frontier army posts in what is now Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. One purpose of the depot was to ensure that a six-month supply of much needed goods such as ammunition, food and clothing was on hand at all times. The goods and supplies were brought to Yuma from California aboard ships that traveled around the Baja California peninsula and up the Gulf of California to Port Isabel, Sonora at the mouth of the Colorado River. Supplies were shipped up the Colorado on river boats to Yuma and stored at the Yuma Quartermaster Depot. The supplies gathered at the quartermaster depot were shipped throughout the southwest via river boats and overland on mule team freight wagons. Up to 900 mules were kept in stables at Yuma Quartermaster Depot. The arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Yuma in 1877 signaled the end of the depot. When the railroad reached Tucson in 1880, the quartermaster depot was closed. The quartermasters moved to Fort Lowell in Tucson. The Signal Corps, having arrived at Fort Yuma and the quartermaster depot in 1875, remained there until 1891. Following the departure of the Signal Corps, the property was transferred to the control of the U.S. Weather Service which worked out of the depot site until 1949. The Yuma Quartermaster Depot fell into a state of disrepair in the years following 1949. Some of the facilities were used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other governmental agencies. ===Historical park=== Five buildings left over from the quartermaster depot days remain at the park. The site was identified as a possible historic park in the early 1960s. The office of the depot quartermaster was acquired by the state in 1969. More property was added to what would become the park in 1980. The park land was purchased from United States Department of the Interior by the city of Yuma and donated to the state park system in 1986. Groundbreaking for the park was held in 1986. The park opened in 1990 as a unit of Yuma Territorial Prison State Historic Park and was established as a state historic park in 1997, under the control of the non-profit Yuma Crossing Foundation. Southern Pacific Railroad Passenger Coach Car-S.P. X7, at the park in 2014 The Yuma Crossing Foundation established an agreement with the state parks board to manage, develop and operate the site as a living history museum. After seven years of construction and rebuilding the park was opened to the public in 1997 as Yuma Crossing State Historic Park. The park is part of the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. The name of the park was changed in 2007 to reflect the original use of the area and its historic interpretive focus. As of 2014, the park includes the Southern Pacific Railroad Passenger Coach Car-S.P. X7, which is separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==FacilitiesVisitor Center=== In addition to being a state historic park, Yuma Quartermaster Depot State Historic Park is the home of the Yuma Visitors Bureau Visitor Information Center. The park and visitor center are open year-round. The visitor center houses a display on the park's military history in the late 19th century, and a history of the work done by the Bureau of Reclamation during the 20th century. A gift shop sells a variety of books and souvenirs. ===Historic exhibits=== Four of the five original buildings house historic exhibits. The storehouse details the history of the Colorado River and the steamboat era on it, and of the mule wagon trains. The office of the depot quartermaster houses two exhibits. One is an historic recreation of the depot as it appeared in its heyday. Another shows how the weather and telegraph stations appeared. The commanding officers quarters is a house museum which mimics how it would have looked in the 1870s, when army officers and their families lived in the space. A biologic exhibit of fish species in the Colorado River is found in the corral house. Outdoor exhibits at the park include ramadas, a steam boiler, a stone built reservoir and an encampment of wagons. The park is open to picnicking. A day use facility under a shade ramada is available for group use with reservations. Picnic tables are available throughout the park as is one pavilion. ==See also== * List of historic properties in Yuma, Arizona ==References *Yuma Quartermaster Depot State Historic Park Category:1997 establishments in Arizona Category:American Civil War army posts Category:Closed installations of the United States Army Category:History of Yuma County, Arizona Category:Military and war museums in Arizona Category:Museums in Yuma County, Arizona Category:Parks in Yuma County, Arizona Category:Protected areas established in 1997 Category:Protected areas on the Colorado River Category:State parks of Arizona Category:Buildings and structures in Yuma, Arizona ","title":"Yuma Quartermaster Depot State Historic Park"},{"id":"20353231","text":"Bette S.

Each grouping describes a different order in which the objects may be combined by a binary operation; in the Tamari lattice, one grouping is ordered before another if the second grouping may be obtained from the first by only rightward applications of the associative law (xy)z = x(yz). For instance, applying this law with x = a, y = bc, and z = d gives the expansion (a(bc))d = a((bc)d), so in the ordering of the Tamari lattice (a(bc))d ≤ a((bc)d). In this partial order, any two groupings g1 and g2 have a greatest common predecessor, the meet g1 ∧ g2, and a least common successor, the join g1 ∨ g2. Thus, the Tamari lattice has the structure of a lattice. The Hasse diagram of this lattice is isomorphic to the graph of vertices and edges of an associahedron. The number of elements in a Tamari lattice for a sequence of n + 1 objects is the nth Catalan number Cn. The Tamari lattice can also be described in several other equivalent ways: *It is the poset of sequences of n integers a1, ..., an, ordered coordinatewise, such that i ≤ ai ≤ n and if i ≤ j ≤ ai then aj ≤ ai . *It is the poset of binary trees with n leaves, ordered by tree rotation operations. *It is the poset of ordered forests, in which one forest is earlier than another in the partial order if, for every j, the jth node in a preorder traversal of the first forest has at least as many descendants as the jth node in a preorder traversal of the second forest . *It is the poset of triangulations of a convex n-gon, ordered by flip operations that substitute one diagonal of the polygon for another. ==Notation== The Tamari lattice of the Cn groupings of n+1 objects is called Tn, but the corresponding associahedron is called Kn+1. In The Art of Computer Programming T4 is called the Tamari lattice of order 4 and its Hasse diagram K5 the associahedron of order 4. ==References== *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

He was a member of the Nationalist Party and served terms in the Tasmanian House of Assembly (1917–1919) and as a Senator for Tasmania (1920–1925). He suffered from shell shock and his term in the Senate was marked by absenteeism. He later became a leader of the temperance movement in Sydney. ==Early life== Foster was born on 29 January 1884 in Adelaide, South Australia. He was the son of Isabella (née Forscutt) and George Foster, his father being a tailor's cutter. The family moved to Tasmania and he was \\"probably educated in Hobart\\", leaving school to train as a mechanic. Foster enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in 1914 and served with the 3rd Light Horse Regiment. He spent three months in Gallipoli, later serving with the regiment in Egypt before being sent home to Australia due to illness. In 1917, he became the inaugural state secretary of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA). He was also the state secretary of the Reinforcements Referendum Council, formed to support the \\"Yes\\" vote in the 1917 conscription plebiscite. ==State politics== In June 1917, Foster was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly at a by-election for the seat of Denison. He stood as a Nationalist with the support of the RSSILA. However, in the lead-up to the 1919 state election both he and the league disavowed any connection. He lost his seat \\"due to his position having been weakened by pressure groups in the electorate causing some disruption and weakening the Nationalist vote\\". ==Federal politics== Foster was elected to the Senate at the 1919 federal election, to a term beginning on 1 July 1920. He was predominantly interested in issues relating to returned soldiers, also opposing any attempts to decrease defence expenditure and supporting the local manufacture of aeroplane engines. He was a member of a select committee that examined a returned soldier's claims to a war gratuity, but did not participate in its deliberations. In July 1921, Foster was named as a co- respondent in a divorce suit brought by John Thomas Hall, whose estranged wife Florence was Foster's landlady in Melbourne. John Hall claimed £1,000 in damages on the grounds that Foster and his wife had engaged in \\"misconduct\\". The jury dismissed the petition on the grounds of connivance by Hall, but found that misconduct had occurred; as a result the presiding judge did not award Foster his legal costs. During the hearing, the court was told that Foster was an alcoholic and been hospitalised the previous year after suffering a nervous breakdown. He had also suffered from insomnia since the war and \\"was unable to travel in trains or trams because of the vibrations\\". After 1921, Foster rarely attended the Senate, seldom voted, and made no speeches. His absenteeism \\"made him something of a standing joke\\" and The Bulletin claimed that he \\"grew to hate the job\\". In July 1923, he was granted two month's leave of absence to take a health trip to Queensland, with Albert Gardiner advising the Senate that he was suffering from shell shock and was unfit to perform parliamentary duties. In October 1924, it was reported that the Confidential Finance Company had initiated lawsuits against Foster in multiple states for writing bad cheques. It was alleged that he had been absent from the Senate since February 1923, was living in Queensland, and had appeared in the Senate chamber for only a few minutes during that time, in order to avoid his seat being declared vacant. In the session of parliament running from June 1923 to October 1924, Foster made the least appearances of any senator, attending for only six out of 95 sitting days. He was absent without leave on 64 sitting days. In February 1925, Tasmania's Taxation Department obtained a judgment against Foster for unpaid income tax. The Attorney-General of Tasmania stated that bankruptcy proceedings would be brought if no payment was made, which if successful would result in his seat being declared vacant. On 2 July 1925, the President of the Senate Thomas Givens announced that he had received a telegram from Foster announcing his resignation due to ill health. ==Later life== After leaving the Senate, Foster worked for periods at the Melbourne Zoo and at a Sydney land agency. He had married Vera Anita Pietriche in April 1922, with whom he had one daughter. Foster became a disciple of Robert Brodribb Hammond, a Christian evangelist and social reformer who was a leader of the temperance movement in New South Wales. He was appointed as the superintendent of the Hammond Hotel, a facility in a converted warehouse which aimed to rehabilitate destitute men. In 1933, he became the general superintendent and secretary of Hammondville, a back-to- the-land settlement in Sydney's south-west. The Hobart Mercury published an interview with Foster about Hammondville in 1935, describing him as \\"a zealous spokesman for social justice, and a diligent student of ethical, psychological, and economic problems\\". He and Hammond hoped to build a ten- storey \\"temperance hotel\\" in Sydney. Foster selected a site on Hunter Street, but no work was completed by the time of Hammond's death in 1946. The project was abandoned the following year after it was discovered that the hotel could cost up to £500,000 to construct. Foster died at the Concord Repatriation General Hospital in Sydney on 6 June 1956. ==References== Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Tasmania Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1884 births Category:1956 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Australian military personnel of World War I Category:Australian temperance activists ","title":"George Foster (Australian politician)"},{"id":"20353360","text":"M67 fragmentation grenade, a modern (1968-present) hand grenade in the US. Original) A grenade is an explosive weapon typically thrown by hand, but can also refer to projectiles shot out of grenade launchers. Generally, a grenade consists of an explosive charge, a detonating mechanism, and a firing pin inside the grenade to trigger the detonating mechanism. Once the soldier throws the grenade, the safety lever releases, the striker throws the safety lever away from the grenade body as it rotates to detonate the primer. The primer explodes and ignites the fuze (sometimes called the delay element). The fuze burns down to the detonator, which explodes the main charge. There are several types of grenades like the fragmentation (frag), high explosive (HE) concussion and smoke grenades. Fragmentation grenades are probably the most common in modern armies. They are designed to disperse shrapnel on detonation. The body is generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel, which will provide limited fragmentation through sharding and splintering, though in modern grenades a pre-formed fragmentation matrix inside the grenade is commonly used. The pre-formed fragmentation may be spherical, cuboid, wire or notched wire. Most anti-personnel (AP) grenades are designed to detonate either after a time delay or on impact. When the word grenade is used colloquially, it is generally assumed to refer to a fragmentation grenade. Stick grenades have a long handle attached to the grenade directly, providing leverage for longer throwing distance, at the cost of additional weight and length. The term \\"stick grenade\\" commonly refers to the German Stielhandgranate style stick grenade introduced in 1915 and developed throughout World War I. A friction igniter was used; this method was uncommon in other countries but widely used for German grenades. Grenades are typically round-shaped with a \\"pineapple\\" or \\"baseball\\"-style design, or an explosive charge on a handle which is referred to as a \\"stick grenade\\". The stick grenade design has been considered obsolete since World War II and the Cold War period. They saw extensive use in World War I and in World War II. The WWI and WWII era \\"stick grenade\\" was often used in trench and built-up (urban and small scale) warfare by the Central Powers and Nazi Germany, while the Triple Entente and Allied powers typically used some improvised earlier grenades or round-shaped fragmentation grenades. ==Etymology== The word \\"grenade\\" is likely derived from Old French pomegranate and influenced by Spanish granada, as the bomb is reminiscent of the many-seeded fruit, together with its size and shape. Its first use in English dates from the 1590s. ==HistoryEarly grenades=== Hand grenades filled with Greek fire; surrounded by caltrops. (10th–12th centuries National Historical Museum, Athens, Greece) Seven ceramic hand grenades of the 17th Century found in Ingolstadt Germany Rudimentary incendiary grenades appeared in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, not long after the reign of Leo III (717–741).Robert James Forbes: \\"Studies in Ancient Technology,\\" Leiden 1993, , p. 107 Byzantine soldiers learned that Greek fire, a Byzantine invention of the previous century, could not only be thrown by flamethrowers at the enemy but also in stone and ceramic jars. Later, glass containers were employed. The use of Greek fire spread to Muslim armies in the Near East, from where it reached China by the 10th century. In China, during the Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD), weapons known as Zhen Tian Lei (, \\"Sky-shaking Thunder\\") were created when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal containers. In 1044, a military book Wujing Zongyao (\\"Compilation of Military Classics\\") described various gunpowder recipes in which one can find, according to Joseph Needham, the prototype of the modern hand grenade.Joseph Needham: Science and civilization in China: Vol. 5; Part 6: Chemistry and chemical technology; Military technology: missiles and sieges, Cambridge University Press 1994, The mid-14th-century book Huolongjing (, \\"Fire Dragon Manual\\"), written by Jiao Yu (), recorded an earlier Song-era cast iron cannon known as the \\"flying-cloud thunderclap cannon\\" (; ). The manuscript stated that (Needham's modified Wade-Giles spelling): Earliest known representation of a gun (a fire lance) and a grenade (upper right), Dunhuang, 10th century AD. Grenade like devices were also known in ancient India. In a 12th century work Mujmalut Tawarikh based on an Arabic work which is itself based on original Sanskrit work, a terracotta elephant filled with explosives set with a fuse was placed hidden in the van and exploded as the invading army approached near. The first cast iron bombshells and grenades appeared in Europe in 1467.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 179. A hoard of several hundred ceramic hand grenades was discovered during construction in front of a bastion of the Bavarian city of Ingolstadt, Germany dated to the 17th century. Many of the grenades retained their original black powder loads and igniters. Most probably the grenades were intentionally dumped in the moat of the bastion prior to 1723. In 1643, it is possible that \\"Grenados\\" were thrown amongst the Welsh at Holt Bridge during the English Civil War. The word \\"grenade\\" originated during the events surrounding the Glorious Revolution in 1688, where cricket ball-sized ( in circumference) iron spheres packed with gunpowder and fitted with slow-burning wicks were first used against the Jacobites in the battles of Killiecrankie and Glen Shiel. These grenades were not very effective (probably because a direct hit would be necessary for the grenade to have effect) and, as a result, saw little use. Grenades were also used during the Golden Age of Piracy: pirate Captain Thompson used \\"vast numbers of powder flasks, grenade shells, and stinkpots\\" to defeat two pirate- hunters sent by the Governor of Jamaica in 1721. Improvised grenades were increasingly used from the mid-19th century, being especially useful in trench warfare. In a letter to his sister, Colonel Hugh Robert Hibbert described an improvised grenade that was employed by British troops during the Crimean War (1854–1856): A cross-section of a Ketchum Grenade, used during the American Civil War. In the American Civil War, both sides used hand grenades equipped with a plunger that detonated the device on impact. The Union relied on experimental Ketchum Grenades, which had a tail to ensure that the nose would strike the target and start the fuze. The Confederacy used spherical hand grenades that weighed about , sometimes with a paper fuze. They also used 'Rains' and 'Adams' grenades, which were similar to the Ketchum in appearance and mechanism. Improvised hand grenades were also used to great effect by the Russian defenders of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War. ===Development of modern grenades=== One of the earliest modern hand grenades. Fielded in the British Army from 1908, it was unsuccessful in the trenches of World War One, and was replaced by the Mills bomb. The lack of an effective hand grenade, coupled with their danger to the user and their lack of utility meant that they were regarded as increasingly obsolete pieces of military equipment. In 1902, the British War Office announced that hand grenades were obsolete and had no place in modern warfare. Within two years, following the success of improvised grenades in the trench warfare conditions of the Russo-Japanese War, and reports from General Sir Aylmer Haldane, a British observer of the conflict, a reassessment was quickly made and the Board of Ordnance was instructed to develop a practical hand grenade. Various models using a percussion fuze were built, but this type of fuze suffered from various practical problems, and they were not commissioned in large numbers. Marten Hale, better known for patenting the Hales rifle grenade, developed a modern hand grenade in 1906 but was unsuccessful in persuading the British Army to adopt the weapon until 1913. Hale's chief competitor was Nils Waltersen Aasen, who invented his design in 1906 in Norway, receiving a patent for it in England. Aasen began his experiments with developing a grenade while serving as a sergeant in the Oscarsborg Fortress. Aasen formed the Aasenske Granatkompani in Denmark, which before the First World War produced and exported hand grenades in large numbers across Europe. He had success in marketing his weapon to the French and was appointed as a Knight of the French Legion in 1916 for the invention. The Royal Laboratory developed the No. 1 grenade in 1908. It contained explosive material with an iron fragmentation band, with an impact fuze, detonating when the top of the grenade hit the ground. A long cane handle (approximately 16 inches or 40 cm) allowed the user to throw the grenade farther than the blast of the explosion. Early in World War I, combatant nations only had small grenades, similar to Hales' and Aasen's design. The Italian Besozzi grenade had a five-second fuze with a match-tip that was ignited by striking on a ring on the soldier's hand. As an interim measure, troops often improvised their own grenades, such as the jam tin grenade. Fragmentation grenade Improvised grenades were replaced when manufactured versions became available. The first modern fragmentation grenade was the Mills bomb, which became available to British front-line troops in 1915. The Mills bomb the first modern fragmentation grenade was used in the trenches from 1915 William Mills, a hand grenade designer from Sunderland, patented, developed and manufactured the \\"Mills bomb\\" at the Mills Munition Factory in Birmingham, England in 1915, designating it the No. 5. It was described as the first \\"safe grenade\\". They were explosive-filled steel canisters with a triggering pin and a distinctive deeply notched exterior surface. This segmentation was thought to aid fragmentation and increase the grenade's deadliness, but later research showed that it did not improve fragmentation. Improved fragmentation designs were later made with the notches on the inside, but at that time they would have been too expensive to produce. The external segmentation of the original Mills bomb was retained, as it provided a positive grip surface. This basic \\"pin-and-pineapple\\" design is still used in some modern grenades. The Mills bomb underwent numerous modifications. The No. 23 was a variant of the No. 5 with a rodded base plug which allowed it to be fired from a rifle. This concept evolved further with the No. 36, a variant with a detachable base plate to allow use with a rifle discharger cup. The final variation of the Mills bomb, the No. 36M, was specially designed and waterproofed with shellac for use initially in the hot climate of Mesopotamia in 1917, and remained in production for many years. By 1918, the No. 5 and No. 23 were declared obsolete and the No. 36 (but not the 36M) followed in 1932. The Mills had a grooved cast iron \\"pineapple\\" with a central striker held by a close hand lever and secured with a pin. A competent thrower could manage with reasonable accuracy, but the grenade could throw lethal fragments farther than this; after throwing, the user had to take cover immediately. The British Home Guard was instructed that the throwing range of the No. 36 was about with a danger area of about . Approximately 75,000,000 grenades were manufactured during World War I, used in the war and remaining in use through to the Second World War. At first, the grenade was fitted with a seven-second fuze, but during combat in the Battle of France in 1940, this delay proved too long, giving defenders time to escape the explosion or to throw the grenade back, so the delay was reduced to four seconds. The F1 grenade was first produced in limited quantities by France in May 1915. This new weapon had improvements from the experience of the first months of the war: the shape was more modern, with an external groove pattern for better grip and easier fragmentation. The second expectation proved deceptive, as the explosion in practice gave no more than 10 fragments (although the pattern was designed to split into all the 38 drawn divisions). The design proved to be very functional, especially due to its stability compared to other grenades of the same period. The F1 was used by many foreign armies from 1915 to 1940. Stick grenade Stielhandgranate Stick grenades have a long handle attached to the grenade proper, providing leverage for longer throwing distance, at the cost of additional weight. The term \\"stick grenade\\" commonly refers to the German Stielhandgranate introduced in 1915 and developed throughout World War I. A friction igniter was used; this method was uncommon in other countries but widely used for German grenades. A pull cord ran down the hollow handle from the detonator within the explosive head, terminating in a porcelain ball held in place by a detachable base closing cap. To use the grenade, the base cap was unscrewed, permitting the ball and cord to fall out. Pulling the cord dragged a roughened steel rod through the igniter, causing it to spark and start the five-second fuze burning. This simple design (popularly known as the \\"potato masher\\") continued to evolve throughout the First and Second World Wars, with the Model 24 grenade becoming one of the most easily recognized of all German small arms. Other stick grenades were made, including the Russian RGD-33 and Model 1914 grenades, the German Model 43 grenade and the British No. 1 grenade and sticky bomb. Further development During World War II the United Kingdom used incendiary grenades based on white phosphorus. One model, the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade, was mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon. It was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured. The United States developed the Mk 2 hand grenade before the war, nicknamed the \\"pineapple\\" for its grooved surface. This weapon was widely used by American G.I.s The heavy, segmented bodies of \\"pineapple\\" type grenades produce an unpredictable pattern of fragmentation. After the Second World War Britain adopted grenades that contained segmented coiled wire in smooth metal casings. Despite this, the Mills bomb remained the standard grenade of the British Armed Forces and was manufactured in the UK until 1972, when it was replaced by the L2 series. == Explosive grenades Fragmentation (defensive)=== World War II-era U.S. Mk 2 grenade German DM51https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DM51 hand grenade with blast core (top) and fragmentation sleeve (bottom) Fragmentation grenades are common in armies. They are weapons that are designed to disperse lethal fragments on detonation, in order to do damage in as wide an area as possible. The body is generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel, which will provide some fragmentation as shards and splinters, though in modern grenades a pre-formed fragmentation matrix is often used. The pre-formed fragmentation may be spherical, cuboid, wire or notched wire. Most AP grenades are designed to detonate either after a time delay or on impact. When the word grenade is used without specification, and context does not suggest otherwise, it is generally assumed to refer to a fragmentation grenade. Fragmentation grenades can be divided into two main types, defensive and offensive, where the former are designed to be used from a position of cover, (e.g. in a slit trench or behind a suitable wall,) and have an effective radius greater than the distance they can be thrown, while the latter are for use by assaulting troops, and have a smaller effective fragmentation radius. The Mills bombs and the Soviet F1 are examples of defensive grenades. The Dutch V40, Swiss HG 85, and US MK3 are examples of offensive grenades. Modern fragmentation grenades, such as the United States M67 grenade, have a wounding radius of – half that of older style grenades, which can still be encountered – and can be thrown about . Fragments may travel more than . ===High explosive (offensive)=== The offensive or concussion (high explosive) grenade is an anti-personnel device that is designed to damage, daze or otherwise stun its target with its explosive power. Compared to fragmentation grenades, the explosive filler is usually of a greater weight and volume, and the case is much thinner – the US MK3A2 concussion grenade, for example, has a body of fiber (similar to the packing container for the fragmentation grenade). Mk3A2 concussion grenade These grenades are usually classed as offensive weapons because the small effective casualty radius is much less than the distance it can be thrown. The concussion effect, rather than any expelled fragments, is the effective killer. In the case of the US Mk3A2, the casualty radius is published as in open areas, but fragments and bits of fuze may be projected as far as from the detonation point. They have also been used as depth charges (underwater explosives) around boats and underwater targets; some like the US Mk 40 concussion grenade are designed for use against enemy divers and frogmen. Underwater explosions kill or otherwise incapacitate the target by creating a lethal shock wave underwater.Dockery 1997, p. 188. The US Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) announced in 2016 that they were developing a grenade which could operate in either fragmentation or blast mode (selected at any time before throwing), the electronically fuzed Enhanced Tactical Multi-Purpose (ET-MP) hand grenade. Some blast grenades with cylindrical bodies can be converted into fragmentation grenades by coupling with a separate factory-made payload of fragments wrapped around the outside: a \\"fragmentation sleeve (jacket)\\", as shown in the WW2 \\"Splittering\\" sleeves for the stick grenade and M39 \\"egg hand grenade\\". HEAT grenade ===Anti- tank=== A range of hand-thrown grenades have been designed for use against heavy armored vehicles. An early and unreliable example was the British Sticky bomb of 1940, which was too short-ranged to use effectively. Designs such as the German Panzerwurfmine (L) and the Soviet RPG-43, RPG-40, RPG-6 and RKG-3 series of grenades used a High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) shaped charge warhead using a cone-shaped cavity on one end and some method to stabilize flight and increase the probability of right angle impact for the shaped charge's metal stream to effectively penetrate the tank armor. Due to improvements in modern tank armor, anti-tank hand grenades have become almost obsolete. However, they were used with limited success against lightly-armored Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles designed for protection only against improvised explosive devices in the Iraqi insurgency in the early 2000s.Schogol, Jeff (October 20, 2009) \\"MRAPs modified to deflect RKG-3 anti- tank grenades\\". Stars and Stripes (newspaper) == Non-explosive grenades  Less-than-lethal ===  Stun (flashbang)  M84 stun grenade (1995–Present) A stun grenade, also known as a flash grenade or flashbang, is a non-lethal weapon. The first devices like this were created in the 1960s at the order of the British Special Air Service as an incapacitant. It is designed to produce a blinding flash of light and loud noise without causing permanent injury. The flash produced momentarily activates all light sensitive cells in the eye, making vision impossible for approximately five seconds, until the eye restores itself to its normal, unstimulated state. The loud blast causes temporary loss of hearing, and also disturbs the fluid in the ear, causing loss of balance. These grenades are designed to temporarily neutralize the combat effectiveness of enemies by disorienting their senses. When detonated, the fuze/grenade body assembly remains intact. The body is a tube with holes along the sides that emit the light and sound of the explosion. The explosion does not cause shrapnel injury, but can still burn. The concussive blast of the detonation can injure and the heat created can ignite flammable materials such as fuel. The fires that occurred during the Iranian Embassy Siege in London were caused by stun grenades. The filler consists of about of a pyrotechnic metal-oxidant mix of magnesium or aluminium and an oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate or potassium perchlorate.  Sting  Sting grenades, also known as stingball or sting ball grenades, are stun grenades based on the design of the fragmentation grenade. Instead of using a metal casing to produce fragmentation, they are made from hard rubber and are filled with around 100 rubber balls. On detonation, the shrapnel rubber balls, and fragments from the rubber casing explode outward in all directions as a form of less-than-lethal shrapnel. These projectiles may ricochet. It is intended that people struck by the projectiles will receive a series of fast, painful stings, without serious injury. Some types have an additional payload of CS gas. Sting grenades do not reliably incapacitate people, so they can be dangerous to use against armed subjects. They can cause serious physical injury, especially the rubber shrapnel from the casing. People have lost eyes and hands to sting grenades.French police weapons under scrutiny after gilets jaunes injuries The Guardian, 2019 Sting grenades are sometimes called \\"stinger grenades\\", which is a genericized trademark as \\"Stinger\\" is trademarked by Defense Technology for its line of sting grenades.  Chemical and gas type  Chemical and gas grenades burn or release a gas, and do not explode. They include smoke and incendiary grenades.  Smoke  Smoke grenades are used as ground-to-ground or ground-to-air signaling devices, target or landing zone marking devices, and to create a smoke-screen for concealment. The body is a sheet-steel cylinder with emission holes in the top and bottom. These allow the smoke to be released when the grenade is ignited. There are two main types, one producing coloured smoke for signaling, and the other is used for screening smoke. In coloured smoke grenades, the filler consists of of coloured smoke mixture (mostly potassium chlorate, lactose and a dye). Screening smoke grenades usually contain HC (hexachloroethane/zinc) or TA (terephthalic acid) smoke mixture and white phosphorus (WP) and red phosphorus (RP). HC smoke contains hydrochloric acid and is harmful to breathe. These grenades can become hot enough to scald or burn unprotected skin, particularly the phosphorus type grenades.  Riot control (pacification)  Tear gas grenades are similar to smoke grenades in shape and operation. In tear gas grenades, the filler is generally of CS gas combined with a pyrotechnic composition which burns to generate an aerosol of CS-laden smoke. This causes extreme irritation to the eyes and, if inhaled, to the nose and throat. They were used in the Waco Siege. Occasionally CR gas is used instead of CS. === Lethal === Incendiary grenade  Incendiary  Incendiary grenades (or thermite grenades) produce intense heat by means of a chemical reaction. Seventh-century \\"Greek fire\\" first used by the Byzantine Empire, which could be lit and thrown in breakable pottery, could be considered the earliest form of incendiary grenade. The body of modern incendiary grenades is practically the same as that of a smoke grenade. The filler is of thermate, which is an improved version of World War II-era thermite. The chemical reaction that produces the heat is called a thermite reaction. In this reaction, powdered aluminium metal and iron oxide react to produce a stream of molten iron and aluminium oxide. This reaction produces a tremendous amount of heat, burning at . This makes incendiary grenades useful for destroying weapons caches, artillery, and vehicles. The thermite burns without an external oxygen source, allowing it to burn underwater. Thermite incendiary grenades are not intended to be thrown and generally have a shorter delay fuze than other grenades (e.g. two seconds). White phosphorus can be used as an incendiary agent. It burns at a temperature of . White phosphorus was used in the No 76 Special Incendiary Grenade by the British Home Guard and the No. 77 Mk. 1 grenade during World War II. Thermite and white phosphorus cause some of the worst and most painful burn injuries because they burn extremely quickly at a high temperature. In addition, white phosphorus is very poisonous: a dose of is lethal to the average human.  Molotov cocktail  The Molotov cocktail is an improvised incendiary grenade made with a glass bottle typically filled with gasoline (petrol), although sometimes another flammable liquid or mixture is used. The Molotov cocktail is ignited by a burning strip of cloth or a rag stuffed in the bottle's orifice when it shatters against its target which sets a small area on fire. The Molotov cocktail received its name during the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939 (the Winter War) by Finnish troops after the former Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov, whom they deemed responsible for the war. A similar weapon was used earlier in the decade by Franco's troops during the Spanish Civil War. A humorous nickname given to the Soviet cluster bombs was \\"Molotov bread baskets\\" in Finland. ===Practice (simulation)=== Inert training grenade made from hard rubberPractice grenades are similar in handling and function to other hand grenades, except that they only produce a loud popping noise and a puff of smoke on detonation. The grenade body can be reused. Another type is the throwing practice grenade which is completely inert and often cast in one piece. It is used to give soldiers a feel for the weight and shape of real grenades and for practicing precision throwing. Examples of practice grenades include the K417 Biodegradable Practice Hand Grenade by CNOTech Korea. == Design == Hand grenade fuze system M61 grenade (1959-1968), with safety clip around the lever and the bent tip of the safety pin at top Various fuzes (detonation mechanisms) are used, depending on purpose: ; Impact:Examples of grenades fitted with impact fuzes are the German M1913 and M1915 Diskushandgranate, and any British grenade fitted with the \\"All ways\\" action impact fuze such as the No. 69 grenade, No. 77 grenade and No. 82 grenade (Gammon bomb). ; Timed fuze:In a timed fuze grenade, the fuze is ignited on the release of the safety lever, and detonation occurs following a timed delay. Timed fuze grenades are generally preferred to hand-thrown percussion grenades because their fusing mechanisms are safer and more robust than those used in percussion grenades. Fuzes are commonly fixed, though the Russian UZRGM () fuzes are interchangeable and allow the delay to be varied, or replaced by a zero-delay pull fuze. This is potentially dangerous due to the risk of confusion. ; Pull (instant) fuze:A pull fuze is a zero-delay fuze used in booby traps: the grenade detonates immediately when the striker retaining pin is removed. The pin is typically attached to a tripwire. Beyond the basic \\"pin-and-lever\\" mechanism, contemporary grenades have safety features. The main ones are the safety clip and the bent end of the safety pin. The safety clip was introduced in the M61 grenade (1960s, Vietnam War), and is also known as the \\"jungle clip\\" – this provides a backup for the safety pin, in case it is dislodged, notably by jungle flora (plants and vegetation). This is particularly important because the safety lever is often used as a carry hook, despite the obvious danger this poses. The bent end of the safety pin increases the force required to remove it, reducing the risk of accidental arming. The 2016 US ET-MP uses a user-settable timed electronic fuze. ==Manufacturing== Modern manufacturers of hand grenades include: * Agenzia Industrie della Difesa (Italy) * Diehl (Germany) * Mecar (Belgium) * Rheinmetall (Germany, formerly Arges, Austria) * Ruag (Switzerland) * Nammo (Norway) * Instalaza (Spain) * Solar Industries (India) * MKEK (Turkey) == Operation == An infantryman throwing a hand grenade during training, 1942 The classic hand grenade design has a safety handle or lever (known in the US forces as a spoon) and a removable safety pin that prevents the handle from being released: the safety lever is spring-loaded, and once the safety pin is removed, the lever will release and ignite the detonator, then fall off. Thus, to use a grenade, the lever is grasped (to prevent release), then the pin is removed, and then the grenade is thrown, which releases the lever and ignites the detonator, triggering an explosion. Some grenade types also have a safety clip to prevent the handle from coming off in transit. To use a grenade, the soldier grips it with the throwing hand, ensuring that the thumb holds the safety lever in place; if there is a safety clip, it is removed prior to use. Left-handed soldiers invert the grenade, so the thumb is still the digit that holds the safety lever. The soldier then grabs the safety pin's pull ring with the index or middle finger of the other hand and removes it. They then throw the grenade towards the target. Soldiers are trained to throw grenades in standing, prone-to-standing, kneeling, prone-to-kneeling, and alternative prone positions and in under- or side-arm throws. If the grenade is thrown from a standing position the thrower must then immediately seek cover or lie prone if no cover is nearby. Grenade immediately after being thrown at a practice range. The safety lever has separated in mid-air from the body of the grenade. Once the soldier throws the grenade, the safety lever releases, the striker throws the safety lever away from the grenade body as it rotates to detonate the primer. The primer explodes and ignites the fuze (sometimes called the delay element). The fuze burns down to the detonator, which explodes the main charge. When using an antipersonnel grenade, the objective is to have the grenade explode so that the target is within its effective radius. The M67 frag grenade has an advertised effective kill zone radius of , while the casualty-inducing radius is approximately .United States Army Field Manual 3–23.30, Grenades and Pyrotechnic Signals (2005 revision), page 1-6 Within this range, people are generally injured badly enough to effectively render them harmless. These ranges only indicate the area where a target is virtually certain to be incapacitated; individual fragments can still cause injuries as far as away. An alternative technique is to release the lever before throwing the grenade, which allows the fuze to burn partially and decrease the time to detonation after throwing; this is referred to as cooking. A shorter delay is useful to reduce the ability of the enemy to take cover, throw or kick the grenade away and can also be used to allow a fragmentation grenade to explode into the air over defensive positions.United States Army Field Manual 3–23.30, Grenades and Pyrotechnic Signals (2005 revision), pages 3–11 to 3–12 This technique is inherently dangerous, due to shorter delay (meaning a closer explosion), greater complexity (must make sure to throw after waiting), and increased variability (fuzes vary from grenade to grenade), and thus is discouraged in the U.S. Marine Corps, and banned in training. Nonetheless, cooking a grenade and throwing one back is frequently seen in Hollywood films and video games. === Tactics === Tactics vary by the type of engagement. Urban warfare, particularly the attack of built-up (fortified, buildings etc.) areas, involves the heavy use of hand grenades: typically a grenade or two are thrown before each transition (entering a room or navigating a stairway). A World War II battalion fighting in a city frequently used 500 grenades per day. A key concern is that the grenade is picked up and thrown away or back at the thrower. The USMC's preferred technique to prevent this is a hard-throw, skip/bounce technique, where the grenade is thrown hard enough that it bounces or skips around, being hard to pick up and throw back – this is applicable when clearing a room, for instance. In other uses, such as to reach upper floors of a building, a grenade may be lobbed for greater distance or accuracy. Throwing a grenade upstairs is dangerous, due to the risk of it falling back down; it is much safer to throw a grenade downstairs, so it is safer to capture a building from the top, rather than the bottom. Grenades generally explode near the floor, causing spalling downwards towards lower floors. === Alerts === The preferred technique in the US forces when attacking is to show the grenade to nearby friendly forces, receiving a visual acknowledgment, to avoid alerting the enemy. Alternatively, a voice alert can be given immediately after throwing the grenade, shouting \\"frag out\\" (for \\"fragmentation grenade outgoing\\"); this reduces or eliminates the element of surprise. Conversely, on identifying an incoming enemy grenade, friendly forces shout \\"grenade\\". === Booby traps === Discarded RGD-5 hand grenade (live but unfuzed) in Northern Kuwait Grenades have often been used in the field to construct booby traps, using some action of the intended target (such as opening a door or starting a car) to trigger the grenade. These grenade-based booby traps are simple to construct in the field as long as instant fuzes are available; a delay in detonation can allow the intended target to take cover. The most basic technique involves wedging a grenade in a tight spot so the safety lever does not leave the grenade when the pin is pulled. A string is then tied from the head assembly to another stationary object. When a soldier steps on the string, the grenade is pulled out of the narrow passageway, the safety lever is released, and the grenade detonates. Abandoned booby traps and discarded grenades contribute to the problem of unexploded ordnance (UXO). The use of target triggered grenades and AP mines is banned to the signatories of the Ottawa Treaty and may be treated as a war crime wherever it is ratified. Many countries, including India, the People's Republic of China, Russia, and the United States, have not signed the treaty citing self-defense needs. === Alternative uses === Grenades have also been made to release smoke, tear gas and other gases, as well as illumination. Stun grenades are often used to disorient people during entry into a room, especially where hostages or non-combatants may be present. Some grenades are designed to be thrown longer distances. The German \\"potato-masher\\" grenade had a long wooden handle that extended its range by fifty percent.The Discovery Channel: \\"Weaponology: Episode 10: Frags, Pineapples, and RPG's\\", 2007. The potato-masher was fired by a friction igniter in the head, activated by a pull string threaded through the hollow handle. Immediately before throwing the grenade, the soldier pulled a small porcelain ball at the end of a string attached to the friction igniter. This started the time fuze, which fired the detonator after a delay. The potato-masher is often incorrectly thought to have had an impact fuze. It did not, but the superficially similar British stick grenade design of 1908 did. Concussion grenades can also be used as general explosives, for instance for demolition. == Cultural impact == Grenade on a kepi of the French Army Stylized pictures of early grenades, emitting a flame, are used as ornaments on military uniforms, particularly in Britain, France (esp. French Gendarmerie and the French Army), and Italy (Carabinieri). Fusilier regiments in the British and Commonwealth tradition (e.g., the Princess Louise Fusiliers, Canadian Army) wear a cap-badge depicting flaming grenade, reflecting their historic use of grenades in the assault. The British Grenadier Guards took their name and cap badge of a burning grenade from repelling an attack of French Grenadiers at Waterloo. The Spanish artillery arm uses a flaming grenade as its badge. The flag of the Russian Ground Forces also bears a flaming grenade device. Ukrainian mechanized infantry and engineers use a flaming grenade in their branch insignia. The Finnish Army Corps of Engineers' emblem consists of a stick hand grenade (symbolizing demolition) and a shovel (symbolizing construction) in saltire. The branch insignia of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps also uses this symbol, the grenade being symbolic of explosive ordnance in general. The United States Marine Corps uses the grenade as part of the insignia for one officer rank and one Staff NCO rank on their uniforms. Chief Warrant Officers designated as a Marine Gunner replace the rank insignia worn on the left collar with a \\"Bursting Bomb\\" and a larger \\"Bursting Bomb\\" insignia is worn 3/4\\" above the rank insignia on both shoulder epaulets when a coat is worn. Additionally, the rank insignia for Master Gunnery Sergeant has three chevrons pointing up, with four rockers on the bottom. In the middle of this is a bursting bomb or grenade. U.S. Navy Aviation Ordnanceman's rating badge features a winged device of similar design. == Legislation == In the United States grenades are classed as destructive devices, a form of Title II weapons under the National Firearms Act. They must consequently be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, are taxed, and are illegal in states that ban Title II weapons. While in principle it is possible to legally obtain and possess hand grenades in some states, in practice they are not generally available. ==See also== * Grenadier *Rifle grenade *Grenade launcher * Rocket- propelled grenade * Satchel charge * Technology of the Song Dynasty == References  Citations = Sources === * Needham, Joseph (1986).

He served as a Senator for Tasmania from 1920 to 1938, representing the Nationalist Party until 1931 and then the United Australia Party (UAP). He managed the Mount Bischoff tin mine before entering politics and served a term as president of the Institution of Engineers, Australia. ==Early life== Millen was born on 3 May 1877 in Derry, Ireland. He was the son of Kate (née Dickson) and John Millen. The family immigrated to the Colony of Queensland in 1884, settling in Toowoomba where his father worked as a draper. Millen attended Toowoomba Grammar School and obtained a diploma from Sydney Technical College. In 1903 he moved to Launceston, Tasmania, to work as a metallurgist for the Mount Bischoff Tin Mining Company smelting works. He was also a consultant for the Renison Bell mine and an advisory engineer to the Vacuum Oil Company of Australia. In 1907, Millen was appointed manager of the Mount Bischoff mine at Waratah. He held the position until 1919 and was \\"credited with the modernisation of the mine’s facilities and was regarded by all those associated with the mine’s operations as an effective manager\\". ==Politics== Millen was elected to the Senate at the 1919 federal election, standing as a Nationalist. He received the highest vote in the state, and was re-elected at the 1925 and 1931 elections, joining the United Australia Party (UAP) upon its formation. His term began on 1 July 1920 and concluded on 30 June 1938 following his defeat at the 1937 election. In the Senate, Millen was known for his committee work, including service on the Joint Committee on Public Accounts (1920–1925) and the select committee into the government's proposed agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) for expanding radio communications between Australia and the UK. According to Robert Menzies, his most important work was as chairman of the Royal Commission on National Insurance which sat between 1923 and 1927. The government's National Insurance Bill 1928 adopted many of the committee's recommendations, but ultimately failed to pass before its defeat in 1929. Millen \\"had a particular interest in technological subjects, including the development of the Commonwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research\\". He stood for President of the Senate in 1935 but was not successful. ==Other activities== Millen was a foundation member of the Institution of Engineers, Australia (IEA), serving on its council and as its fifth president in 1924. He also served on the main committee of the Australian Commonwealth Engineering Standards Association. He was a director of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) and the Australian Provincial Assurance Association, and shortly before his death he became the managing director of the Hadfields Steel Works at Alexandria, New South Wales. ==Personal life== Millen married Janet May Scott in 1906, with whom he had three sons. He suffered from diabetes and was absent from the Senate due to health reasons on a number of occasions. He died in Launceston on 1 August 1941, aged 64. ==References== Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:United Australia Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Tasmania Category:1877 births Category:1941 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Northern Ireland emigrants to Australia Category:People from Derry (city) Category:Australian mining engineers Category:Australian metallurgists Category:People from Toowoomba ","title":"John Millen (Australian politician)"},{"id":"20353452","text":"was a Japanese manga artist. Azuma made his professional debut in 1969 in the Akita Shoten manga magazine Manga Ō. He was most well known for his science fiction lolicon-themed works appearing in magazines such as Weekly Shōnen Champion, as well as children's comedy series such as Nanako SOS and Little Pollon (which both became anime television series in the early 1980s). He has been called the \\"father of lolicon\\". In 2005 he published an autobiographical manga titled Disappearance Diary that has won several awards including the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. His name was also sometimes romanized Hideo Aduma. Azuma died in hospital on October 13, 2019 due to esophageal cancer at the age of 69. ==CareerEarly years=== While attending Hokkaidō Urahoro High School, Azuma participated in the Hokkaidō branch office of COM, along with other artists such as Monkey Punch and Fumiko Okada. In 1968, after graduating from high school, he moved to Tokyo and found employment with Toppan Printing. He left this job after three months to work as an assistant to manga artist Rentarō Itai, where he did uncredited work for Weekly Shōnen Sunday on series such as Mini Mini Manga. Azuma made his professional debut in 1969 in Manga Ō with his work Ringside Crazy. The following year he quit working as an assistant and doing his own work. He gradually expanded his work to include both shōjo and seinen manga. His first works tended to be light gag manga, though he began to include science fiction elements influenced by his being a fan of the New Hollywood movement in American film. It was during this period that he experimented a lot with one panel manga (as opposed to four panel). Beginning in 1972, Azuma began rising in popularity due to the off- color humor in his Weekly Shōnen Champion series Futari to 5-nin. He also married his assistant the same year, with whom he had a girl in 1980 and a boy in 1983. His wife was credited as \\"Assistant A\\" in his works, and his daughter and son were respectively credited as \\"Assistant B\\" and \\"Assistant C\\". ===Boom period=== Azuma began serializing in 1975 his story Yakekuso Tenshi in the semimonthly manga magazine Play Comic. He also began publishing science fiction themed works in many different niche magazines such as Kisō Tengai and Peke. Azuma, together with Jun Ishikawa, is considered part of the manga creators in the 1970s. Due to works such as science fiction novel parody Fujōri Nikki, published in Bessatsu Kisō Tengai in 1978, Azuma began to gain a large following among science fiction fans. Fujōri Nikki was awarded the 1979 Seiun Award for Best Comic of the Year. In 1979, Azuma was a major contributor to the first issue of the dōjinshi series ', which is credited with launching the lolicon genre. From there, he began publishing in magazines such as Shōjo Alice, becoming a fixture in the pornographic lolicon manga business and becoming very involved in otaku culture. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, due to stress from his hectic and demanding schedule during 20 years (to that point) as a manga artist, Azuma began drinking heavily, disappeared twice for several months to over a year, attempted suicide at least once, and was finally forcibly committed to an alcohol rehabilitation program. He published in 2005 a manga journal of this experience titled Disappearance Diary. In addition to being published in Japan, this book has been licensed and published in English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian and Polish. ==WorksManga=== *Futari to 5-nin (1974–1976, 12 volumes, Shōnen Champion Comics, Akita Shoten) *Shikkomōrō Hakase (1976, 1 volume, Sun Comics, Asahi Sonorama) *Oshaberi Love (1976–1977, 2 volumes, Princess Comics, Akita Shoten) *Olympus no Pollon (1977, 2 volumes, Princess Comics, Akita Shoten) **anime adaptation Ochamegami Monogatari Koro Koro Pollon in 1982-1983 **manga reprinted in 2005-2007 by Hayakawa Shoten *Eight Beat (1977, 2 volumes, Sun Comics, Asahi Sonorama) *Kimagure Gokū (1977, 2 volumes, Sun Comics, Asahi Sonorama) *Midare Moko (1977, 1 volume, Power Comics, Futabasha) *Chibi Mama- chan (1977–1978, 2 volumes, Shōnen Champion Comics, Akita Shoten) *Chokkin (1977–1978, 4 volumes, Shōnen Champion Comics, Akita Shoten) *Yakekuso Tenshi (1977–1980, 5 volumes, Akita Manga Bunko, Akita Shoten) *Nemuta-kun (1978, 2 volumes, KC Comics, Kodansha) *Sexy Ai (1978, 1 volume, Sun Comics, Asahi Sonorama) *Fujōri Nikki (1979, Kisō Tengai Comics, Kisō Tengai) *Kyūketsuki- chan (1979, Kisō Tengai Comics, Kisō Tengai) *Parallel Kyōshitsu (1979, Kisō Tengai Comics, Kisō Tengaisha) *Animal Company (1980, My Comics, Tokyo Sanseisha) *Azuma Hideo Sakuhinshū 1: Methyl Metaphysic (1980, Kisō Tengai Comics, Kisō Tengai) *Azuma Hideo Sakuhinshū 2: Gansaku Hideo Hakkenden (1980, Akita Shoten) *Azuma Hideo Sakuhinshū 3: Kakutō Family (1980, Kisō Tengai Comics, Kisō Tengai) *Azuma Hideo Sakuhinshū 4: The Iroppuru (1980, Kisō Tengai Comics, Kisō Tengai) *Mimi (1980, Sun Comics, Asahi Sonorama) *Ningen Shikkaku (1980, My Comics, Tokyo Sanseisha) *Tobe Tobe Donkey (1980, Princess Comics, Akita Shoten) *Yadorigi-kun (1980, Shōnen Champion Comics, Akita Shoten) *Brat Bunny (1980–1982, 2 volumes, Animage Comics, Tokuma Shoten) *Hizashi (1981, hardcover, Kisō Tengaisha) *Mahō Tsukai Chappy (1981, Animage Comics, Tokuma Shoten) - manga adaptation of the 1972 magical girl anime series by Toei Animation; not an original Azuma character *Mia-chan Kannō Shashinshū (1981, Jihi Shuppan) *Paper Night (1981, Shōnen Shōjo SF Manga Kyōsaku Daizenshū Zōkangō, Tokyo Sanseisha) *Suki!

Its editio princeps, unique in the achieved typographic artistry, was published only 28 years after the Gutenberg bible's 42-lines,Six years after the first printed book in Paris and Venice, one year before Stockholm, 58 years before Berlin and 70 years before Moscow. bears witness of high cultural attainment and maturity of Croatian Glagolites and Croatian mediaeval literature.Hercigonja:1984 \\"Because of the importance of Glagolitic printing in the period from 1483 to 1561...as indisputably the highest attainment of Croatian medieval literature and a crucial event in our entire cultural tradition.\\"; \\"In the fifteenth century the Croatian Glagolitism reached the highest point in its development, the era of the full maturity of its literary endeavourings. The most prominent results of these endeavourings were indisputably the appearance of the editio princeps of the Croatian Glagolitic Missal on the 22nd February 1483 and the organisation of the Glagolitic printing business during the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries (Kosinj, Senj, Rijeka, Venecija).\\" ==Characteristics== It is written in the Croatian recension of Church Slavonic and printed in Croatian angular Glagolitic. It has 440 pp, in format 19x26 cm. Its principal model in terms of subject and equivalent Glagolitic letters is thought to be the famous codex Misal kneza Novaka (\\"Prince Novak's Missal\\"), from 1368. Paleographic and linguistic analysis of the text revealed that the first printed Croatian books was edited by the Croats from Istria. The Missal rituals strictly follow the Latin Editio princeps (Milan, 1474) with slight differences in the order of some rituals. Date of the printing (22 February 1483) is shown in the colophon, but the place of printing of still remains to be identified. According to some researchers, it was printed in Venice, but recent research assume suggests that it might have been printed in Kosinj in the Lika region. Eleven incomplete copies and six fragments have been preserved, five of which are held in Zagreb: two in the National and University Library, and two in the library of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Tillotson, Leslie J. Daley, and Mary Frances Gifford. The original incorporation was on September 11, 1938. The first store was opened at 8101 Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring, Maryland, where Gifford's sold six original ice cream flavors.Bethany Sackett, \\"Gifford's Frozen in Time, Not Ideas,\\" The Washington Times, 29 October 2007, C17. In 1940, the company opened a second location on Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda. By 1956, there were five locations in the DC area. Until 1985, all Gifford's locations were large, old-fashioned ice cream parlors. John Gifford served as the company's president until his death in 1976, when the business was passed on to Mary Frances Gifford and George Milroy. When Mary Frances died in 1980, John's son Robert Nash Gifford took over. In April, 1984, Gifford's filed for bankruptcy protection due to approximately $200,000 of debt.Caroline E. Mayer, \\"Gifford's Asks Bankruptcy Protection,\\" The Washington Post, 10 May 1984, D1.

Mayer, \\"Gifford Liquidation Is Ordered by Judge,\\" The Washington Post, 26 April 1985, D3. At that time, the Gifford's name, logo, and a version of the recipes were purchased for $1,500. In 1987, Dolly Hunt and her son, James, bought the rights to the company and opened a new Gifford's on Woodmont Avenue in Bethesda, MD, which had its official opening on July 4, 1989.Elisabeth McAllister, 1989. The Hunts sold their shares in 1999 to Marcelo Ramagem, who partnered with Neal Lieberman. In July 2006, a new factory was opened. Select flavors of Gifford's ice cream were sold in pint containers in area specialty food stores, including Whole Foods Market and Harris Teeter.Sackett, 2007. As of August 2006, more than 70 restaurants in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area served Gifford's ice cream.Walter Nicholls, \\"For the Scoop on Gifford's,\\" The Washington Post, 9 August 2006, F4. Beginning in 2008, Gifford's was added as a concession at Nationals Park. It was replaced by Breyers in 2011. The company was sold in March 2010, and split into two parts, wholesale and retail. Due to much bickering and lawsuits regarding the sale of generic Hood's Ice Cream instead of Gifford's at the retail locations, all the retail locations were closed by October 2010. The trademark and name were then purchased by the unrelated Gifford's Ice Cream of Maine. Of the original Washington, D.C. family, the only surviving member is Robert's son, Andrew Nash Gifford, who currently runs the indie publishing house SFWP. He is also the author of the memoir, We All Scream: The Fall of the Gifford's Ice Cream Empire, which was released on May 1 of 2017.

He served as a Senator for Tasmania from 1920 to 1938 and as a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1903 to 1920. Payne was born in Hobart and worked as a draper in Burnie prior to entering politics. He was first elected to parliament at the 1903 state election and was known for his fiscal conservatism. He served as state treasurer and minister for agriculture and railways from 1912 to 1914. Payne was elected to the Senate at the 1919 federal election, representing the Nationalist Party. He won re-election twice, joining the United Australia Party (UAP) in 1931, but was defeated in 1937. He is primarily remembered for his role in the introduction of compulsory voting for federal elections, which became law in 1924 through his private senator's bill. ==Early life== Payne was born on 17 August 1866 in Hobart, Tasmania, the son of Hannah (née Reed) and Henry Payne; his father worked as a gardener. He attended the Central State School in Hobart and by 1888 was working in Burnie as a draper's assistant. In about 1892 he established a clothing emporium, marketing himself as \\"The People's Draper\\". He was a Freemason and a member of the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows, holding the rank of pro-grandmaster. ==State politics== Payne was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly at the 1903 state election, running in the seat of Burnie. He received the endorsement of the Reform League, an organisation advocating reduced government spending which he had helped to establish in 1902. He subsequently supported the government of William Propsting until its collapse in 1904. Payne's support for spending cuts led him to propose the closure of the University of Tasmania; he also called for direct taxation to be reduced. He was re-elected in 1906 and in the same year was appointed to the state government's Royal Commission into Wages and Wage Earners. He submitted a minority report criticising the labour movement and publicly accused the other two commissioners of misrepresenting the evidence presented to them. In 1907 Payne supported the efforts of Premier John Evans to ban public servants from political campaigning, citing schoolteacher Joseph Lyons' public support of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). In 1909 Payne assisted in the creation of the Liberal League, winning re-election in the new multi-member seat of Darwin at that year's state election. He served as chairman of committees until 1912, when he joined Albert Solomon's new government as treasurer, minister for agriculture and minister for railways. In office he \\"continued his efforts to shift tax onto 'unearned' wealth and was happy to increase expenditure on education, railways, agricultural improvement and assistance to immigrants\\". He served as a minister until the government was defeated on a no-confidence motion in April 1914. During World War I, Payne was a prominent loyalist and supporter of conscription. In November 1918, he challenged George Becker, a Labor MP of German ancestry, to a fistfight following a perceived slight, and subsequently \\"through the open door from the House . . . [they] could be seen exchanging blows amidst great commotion\\". ==Federal politics== Undated photo Payne was elected to the Senate as a Nationalist at the 1919 federal election, to a six- year term beginning on 1 July 1920. His election was challenged by a fellow Nationalist, Edward Mulcahy, who had been elected to fill a short-term casual vacancy of less than one year. Mulcahy unsuccessfully argued for the shorter term to be assigned to Payne, but his petition was rejected by the High Court. Payne was re-elected to further six-year terms at the 1925 and 1931 elections, joining the new United Australia Party (UAP) upon its creation in early 1931. He was defeated for re-election in 1937, concluding his term on 30 June 1938 at the age of 71. Payne emerged as a prominent critic of the Scullin Government's policy of high tariffs. He stated his support for a \\"sane protective policy\\" and according to \\"upheld nineteenth-century ideas as to world-ranging free trade being the best guarantor of peace and prosperity\\". He took an interest in international affairs, visiting Europe, North America and Japan while in office and helping establish a local branch of the Inter- Parliamentary Union. During the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935 he supported sanctions against Italy. Payne served on the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works (1926–1929) and acted as chairman of committees (1929–1932). He was an unsuccessful candidate for President of the Senate in 1935. ===Electoral reform=== Over his political career Payne took a keen interest in electoral issues. He is primarily remembered as the author of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1924, which established compulsory voting for federal elections. He introduced the legislation as a private senator's bill; it was only the third such bill from either house of parliament to become law. Payne's interest in compulsory voting was sparked by the record low voter turnout at the 1922 election, which stood at 59 percent of registered voters nationwide and only 46 percent in Tasmania. After the passage of the bill turnout increased to 91 percent, an increase of 32 percentage points. Payne stated that compulsory voting was necessary to counteract \\"apathy and indolence\\", but in his second reading speech also hoped that it would bring \\"a wonderful improvement in the political knowledge of the people\\" and lead to a higher quality legislature. His bill, a simply worded amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, was notable for its speedy passage and lack of opposition. Prior to the parliamentary debate Nationalist and Country Party MPs both voted to support the bill, and compulsory voting already formed part of the ALP platform. Edward Mann sponsored the bill in the House of Representatives, where it was debated for less than an hour and passed without amendment. It was passed by the House eight days after being introduced to the Senate on 16 July, and received royal assent one week later on 31 July. Outside of compulsory voting, Payne advocated proportional representation for Senate elections and the use of communities of interest rather than simple geography for House of Representatives electorates. He also supported the creation of \\"native representative councils\\" in the Territory of New Guinea. He served on the Joint Select Committee on Commonwealth Electoral Law and Procedure in 1926. In 1934 Payne suggested that circular ballots be used to reduce the donkey vote; his suggestion has been cited as a predecessor of the Robson Rotation system that was adopted in 1979 to address the same issue. Prior to his election to the Senate he had also served on a select committee into Tasmania's Electoral Act, which suggested that party affiliations be listed on ballot papers. This recommendation was eventually adopted at federal level in 1983. ==Personal life== Payne married Margaret Stones on 18 January 1888 in Ulverstone. The couple had two sons and two daughters, with his oldest son Leslie (d. 1942) also serving in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. After entering politics Payne supplemented his income through investing and land speculation. He was widowed in 1936 and remarried on 30 March 1938 to Constance Rogers. After leaving parliament he retired to the northern suburbs of Melbourne. He died at the Sacred Heart Private Hospital in Coburg on 26 February 1944, aged 77. ==References== Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:United Australia Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Tasmania Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1866 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Treasurers of Tasmania Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Drapers Category:People from Hobart ","title":"Herbert Payne"},{"id":"20353572","text":"The term Ionian (or Heptanese) School of Music (Greek: Επτανησιακή Σχολή, literally: \\"Seven Islands' School\\") denotes the musical production of a group of Heptanesian composers, whose heyday was from the early 19th century till approximately the 1950s. Conventionally, it is divided in two periods: the First Generation (Πρὠτη Γενιά) from 1815, till the end of the 1860s, and the Second Generation (Δεύτερη Γενιά) from 1871 and onwards. Prominent representatives of this genre include Nikolaos Mantzaros, Spyridon Xyndas, Spyridon Samaras and Pavlos Carrer. Other composers include Dionysius Rodotheatos, Iosif Liveralis, Antonios Liveralis, Georgios Lambiris, Iosif Kaisaris, Spyridon Kaisaris, Dionysios Lavrangas, Eleni Lambiri and later Dionysios Visvardis. The Music Museum of the Philharmonic Society of Corfu has in its collections several scores by these and other 19th and 20th century Ionian composers. ==History== The major inspiration for the Ionian School was considered to be the Italian musical tradition. However, as late as the 1820s composers from Ionian Islands succeeded in shaping their own path towards 'national music' initially by using the Greek vernacular language, and later by incorporating folklore elements both from the local tradition and from that of mainland Greece. ==Gallery== Image:XyndasAnnaWinter.JPGThe first page of \\"Quinteto Finale\\" from Act III of the opera Anna Winter by Xyndas (composer's autograph).

The term is most frequently applied to certain fruit or hypanthium structures with the apical end attached to the stem; however, less frequently the usage may apply to the pistil structure. In the case of fungi the designation is often made to the ascospore. The use of obconic in botany dates to at least as early as the nineteenth century; however, some modern usage applies to an entire plant form, such as the shape of a whole shrub.Annette J.G. Wilson, Alexander S. George, Anthony E. Orchard (2001) Flora of Australia, Published by ABRS/CSIRO More broadly, in geometry or design, the term can be assigned in an abstract manner to shapes in the natural or man-made world which show an inverted cone design. ==Botanical examples== The carnivorous plant Nepenthes deaniana has pitcher elements that are obconic in shape to capture insects.M.R. Cheek and M.H.P. Jebb (1999) Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) in Palawan, Philippines. Kew Bulletin 54(4): 887–895. The hypanthium of the western USA plant Heuchera rubescens has one subspecies with an obconic structure, while several other subspecies have alternative hypantium geometries, so that the obconic characteristic is a subspecies determinant and diagnostic.Willis Linn Jepson and James C.

As a fungal example the species Pocillum cesatii is noted to have an obconic ascospore.George Massee (1895) British Fungus-flora: A Classified Text-book of Mycology ==Etymology and historical usage== The derivation of the word obconic is based upon the Greek with the common prefix ob, meaning inverted, and the Greek word for angle gon or gonia, followed by the generic suffix ic.Laurence Urdang, Alexander Humez and Howard G.

She was also known as MV Rakaia. ==History== Empire Abercorn was built by Harland & Wolff, Belfast for the MoWT and was initially managed by the New Zealand Shipping Co, London. She was sold to the New Zealand Shipping Co in 1946 and renamed Rakaia. In 1950, Rakaia was converted to a cadet training ship, and the accommodation reduced from 45 passengers to 40 cadets. Her first voyage in this role started on 10 June 1950. On 16 February 1955, a dockside fire at Wellington, New Zealand threatened to spread to Arawa, Port Pirie, Rakaia, and Rangitoto. On 16 October 1957, on a voyage between New York City and Liverpool, No.8 piston rod in the engine snapped. The ship was about off Halifax at the time. The weather deteriorated, and the ship was rolling, making repairs difficult. To stabilize Rakaia, it was decided to jury rig a set of sails. Tarpaulin sails were made from hatch covers. Two square sails and one staysail were erected, giving approximately of sail. The engine was reduced from eight to six cylinders, running at a maximum of 50 rpm; it took eleven days to reach Liverpool. On 28 December 1966, Rakaia was sold to the Federal Steam Navigation Co, remaining under the management of the New Zealand Shipping Co. Her last voyage as a cadet training ship ended on 28 March 1968. Rakaia was sold to the Lee Sing Company, Hong Kong in August 1971 for scrapping. ==Engine and generators== Empire Abercorn had an eight-cylinder, two-cycle double-acting diesel engine built by Harland & Wolff. It produced 7,500 hp at 115 rpm. Normal operating speed about 101.2 rpm, giving a fuel consumption of 28 tons per day. Empire Abercorn had four main generators and one auxiliary generator. The main generators were \\"Harlandics\\", built by Harland and Wolff. They were powered by six-cylinder diesel engines of producing 250 kW each ; the auxiliary generator was powered by a three-cylinder diesel engine of producing 15 kW, voltage was 220 volts. ==Official number and code letters== Official numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers.

In 1853 she sailed from San Francisco, California to Boston, Massachusetts via Cape Horn with Captain Freeman Hatch at the helm in a record-setting 76 days, 6 hours. The record still stands for a single hull vessel. In 1993 the record was soundly broken by a multi-hull sailing vessel Great American II with no cargo. Sailing around Cape Horn (the southernmost tip of South America) is widely regarded as one of the most challenging routes in yachting, due to extreme weather, strong currents, and a historical reputation for mountainous seas and frequent severe storms. == Construction == Northern Light was designed by Boston-based naval architect Samuel Hartt Pook and built by the Briggs Brothers in South Boston in 1851. The ship was 1,021 tons register and it measured long, wide, and deep.Clark, 163 == 1853 voyage == Northern Light left Boston for San Francisco on October 29, 1852 under the command of Captain Freeman Hatch of Eastham, Massachusetts. The return journey was part of a competition with another clipper, Contest, bound for New York.Clark, 227 Contest departed San Francisco for New York on March 12, 1853. Northern Light sailed for Boston the next day. After 38 days Northern Light came within sight of Contest off Cape Horn. Northern Light′s crew signalled and overtook their rival. Northern Light reached Boston Light on May 29, 1853, after 76 days, 5 hours, arriving in Boston an hour later, two days ahead of Contest′s arrival in New York. It was the shortest run on the San Francisco-to-Boston passage on record. It also beat previous around-Cape-Horn speed records of 84 days and 85 days held by the New York-based Comet and Flying Dutchman respectively. The Boston Post noted that Northern Light carried no cargo during the passage. The San Francisco-to-Boston sailing record by Northern Light still stands for a single-hull vessel; that feat, accomplished in a time with no electricity, and few navigation aids, no plastics, no synthetic materials for sails or lines, and neither accurate television or radio weather forecasts nor accurate charts and Global Positioning System navigation to demonstrate precise location, is unlikely ever to be repeated. Nevertheless, in 1993 the multi-hull trimaran Great American II broke the record and completed the passage in 69 days, 19 hours; she had capsized off San Francisco on an initial attempt. == Later service == Northern Light made her first transatlantic voyage in 1861, sailing to Le Havre, France, and departed Le Havre bound for New York on December 25, 1861. On January 2, 1862, the ship collided with and sank the French brig Nouveau St. Jacques.

He began his service as a major in the 32nd Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment until May 21, 1862. Although he was a staff officer for most of the rest of his war service, he commanded a brigade at the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 13, 1864. On December 4, 1864, he was appointed as a (special) brigadier general. The appointment was soon cancelled and he returned to his duties as a staff officer for Major General Joseph B. Kershaw for the remainder of the war. ==Early life and Texas== James Monroe Goggin was born on October 23, 1820 in Bedford County, Virginia.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1959. . p. 108.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 599.Sifakis, Stewart. Who Was Who in the Civil War. New York: Facts On File, 1988. . p. 252. He was married to Elizabeth Nelson Page. Goggin entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in the Class of 1842 but left before graduating. After leaving West Point, Goggin relocated to Texas, where he joined the Army of the Republic of Texas as a first lieutenant. Goggin also began purchasing real estate in Waller County, Texas. In 1848, Goggin moved to California where he took a job establishing mail routes. Goggin then moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he began working as a cotton broker. He was engaged in this business until the beginning of the Civil War. ==Civil War service== In 1861, Goggin moved back to Virginia, entering the Confederate States Army on July 1, 1861 as a major in the 32nd Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment where he was assigned to lead a battalion. Goggin and the 32nd Virginia Infantry served under Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder in 1861 and into 1862 during the Peninsula Campaign. Goggin joined the First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia in April 1862, serving on the staff of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws as his assistant adjutant general.Sifakis, 1988, p. 252 says that all of the officers of the 32nd Virginia Infantry were not reappointed in the reorganization of May 21, 1862 and McLaws then appointed Goggin to his staff. He served in this capacity during all of the First Corps' engagements, in both the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee, until the spring of 1864.Warner, 1959, p. 109. During the Battle of Fort Sanders in November 1863, Goggin carried a message from McLaws to Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, informing him that the attack was beginning to fail and it was futile to carry in on.Wert, p. 352. When McLaws was replaced with Maj. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw in May 1864, Goggin served as his assistant adjutant general as well. His service in this post was highly praised by Goggin's superiors.Warner, 1959, p. 109. \\"...and was on numerous occasions commended for gallantry and fidelity.\\" On October 13, 1864, during the Battle of Cedar Creek in the Valley Campaigns of 1864, Goggin was given temporary command of Brig. Gen. James Conner's brigade. Conner had lost his left leg in combat earlier that day, and Kershaw assigned Goggin to lead his brigade in the battle at Cedar Creek.Eicher, 2001, p. 182. On December 4 he was appointed a \\"special\\" brigadier general, but this appointment was canceled soon afterwards.Sifakis, 1988, p. 252 says the reason for the quick cancellation of the appointment is unexplained. He speculates, however, it may have been because Goggin was a Virginian who was being picked to lead a brigade of South Carolinians.Wright, Marcus J., General Officers of the Confederate Army, J. M. Carroll & Co., 1983. . pp. 135-6. \\"Appointed from Virginia, to rank from December 4, 1864; appointment canceled. Goggin returned to the staff of Kershaw in December 1864, once again as assistant adjutant general, and served until Goggin, Kershaw, and the rest of the staff were captured on April 6, 1865 at the Battle of Sayler's Creek during the Appomattox Campaign. They were paroled from that location on the same day. ==Postbellum== After the American Civil War ended in 1865, Goggin returned to Texas, initially in the state's Waller County, and then in Austin. James Monroe Goggin died at the age of 68 on October 10, 1889 in Austin, Texas. He was buried in the city's Oakwood Cemetery. ==See also== *List of American Civil War Generals (Acting Confederate) ==NotesReferences== * \\"Campbell Chronicles and Family Sketches - Goggin\\"> * Eicher, John H., and David J.

He has directed more than twenty documentary films on a wide variety of themes. His work has often been a center of controversy in Vietnam; his 1982 film Hanoi In Whose Eyes, and his 1985 film The Story of Kindness, were both banned for a number of years by the Vietnamese government because each had content that was implicitly critical of the regime. Nonetheless, due in large measure to the success of his work at international film festivals, Thủy was able to continue working for the Government Cinema department as a creator of greatly significant films, including A Story From the Corner of the Park (1996), and The Sound of a Violin at Mỹ Lai (1999). ==Biography== Trần Văn Thủy was born in 1940 in Nam Định, Vietnam. His father was Trần Văn Vỵ (1902–1975), an automotive mechanic and functionary in the French protectorate government who was personally supportive of the revolutionary Việt Minh. His mother was Đỗ Thị Hiếu (1917–2015). He was the second of seven children. In 1949, his elder brother Vĩnh was killed by French fire in the course of a sweep operation in Hải Hậu, a rural district in Nam Định Province where the family had taken refuge. Thủy as a result became the eldest son in the family. During his childhood he became an avid swimmer, a skill that later on was to prove of supreme importance to his survival during his years as a combat photographer. He was educated in French schools until 1954, when he turned fourteen. According to Тhủy, his father Tràn Văn Vỵ was an extremely humane man who made many efforts to help people in trouble, and Thủy attributes his own strong sense of social responsibility, and his activities as a philanthropist, to the influence of his father. After 1954 his family had a difficult time because Thủy's father had worked for the French. None of Thủy's brothers and sisters were allowed to enter colleges, in spite of achieving high scores in entrance examinations. After high school Thủy enrolled in a museum course in anthropology organized by the Ministry of Culture, and in 1960 went out to the mountains in the extreme northwest of Vietnam to make ethnographic studies of small groups of minority peoples such as the Tổng lượng and Khu Sung. In 1965, he made his way back, partly on foot, to Hanoi, in order to study at the Cinema Academy, a subsidiary of the government Cinema Department. His training was supposed to consist of a two-year curriculum concluding in 1967, but after only one year, he and number of fellow students were recruited to go south as combat journalists and photographers. Thủy then worked as a war journalist in Military District V (a region around Quảng Đà) from 1966 to 1969, filming scenes of combat while suffering from extreme privation and danger. In 1969, gravely ill and exhausted, he made his way back north, carrying on his back the canisters of film that he had shot in the south. These rolls of film later became his first finished work: “My Land and My People.” In 1972, Trần Văn Thủy went to the USSR to study directing at the Moscow Film College under Roman Karmen (1906–1978), a renowned Soviet documentary filmmaker who admired Thủy's first film, My Land and My People, and warmly supported Thủy's aspirations. After returning to Vietnam from the Soviet Union in 1977 Thủy worked for the Vietnam Central Documentary Film Unit under the Ministry of Culture, and during several sojourns abroad, worked as well with Britain's Channel 4 and Japan's NHK. Since 1992, Trần Văn Thủy has put much effort into charitable work in Hải Hậu, a rural region in Nam Định Province, where the local people are for the most part subsistence-level rice farmers. Raising funds through organizations such as “Friends of Trần Văn Thủy,” Thủy has provided the wherewithal for the villagers to build roads, bridges, and schools.https://tranhuythuan.wordpress.com/tag/trần-van-thủy/ “Đạo diễn Trần Văn Thủy, Một trái tim nhân hậu.” Trần Văn Thủy's films have received widespread acclaim. The honors he has received include the Golden Dove Prize and the Silver Dove Prize at the Dok Leipzig film festival, the Silver Lotus Prize and Best Director Prize at the Vietnam Film Festival. He was awarded the Best Documentary Prize at the Asia Pacific Film Festival in year 2000 for The Sound of the Violin in Mỹ Lai. ==Filmography== * Những Người Dân Quê Tôi (My Land and My People); 1970 * Nơi Chúng Tôi Đã Sống (The Place Where We Lived; Russian: Там Где Мы Жили); 1977 * Phản Bội (Betrayal); 1980 * Hà Nội Trong Mắt Ai (Hanoi in Whose Eyes); 1982 * Chuyện Tử Tế (On Being Kind; often referred to as “The Story of Kindness”) 1985 * Có Hai Tục Ngữ (Làm ở Liên Xô) 1986 * Thầy Mù Xem Voi (Blind Soothsayers Examining an Elephant; in two parts) 1990 * Phiên chợ tình (Love Market) 1992 * Một Cõi Tâm Linh (A Spiritual Realm) 1993 * Có Một Làng Quê (There Was a Village) 1994 * Chuyện Từ Một Góc Công Viên (A Story From a Corner of the Park) 1996 * Hải Hậu—Một Vùng Quê Văn Hoá (The Rural Culture of Hải Hậu) 1998 * Huế—Những di tích xưa (Remnants of Former Days in Huế) 1999 * Huế—Lịch sử (History in Huế) 1999 * Huế—Văn Hóa (The Culture of Huế) 1999 * Tiếng Vĩ Cầm Ở Mỹ Lai (The Sound of a Violin at Mỹ Lai) 1999 * Giáo Sư Hoàng Minh Giám (Professor Hoàng Minh Giám) 2000 * Nhà Thờ Phát Diệm (The Phát Diệm Cathedral) 2001 * Lời Của Đá (The Stones Speak) 2004 * Mạn Đàm Về Người Man Di Hiện Đại (Conversations Concerning a Barbarian of Modern Times; in 4 parts) 2008 * Vọng Khúc Ngàn Năm (Songs Resounding for a Thousand Years; in three parts) 2013 ==Filmscripts== * Nhà Giáo Nguyễn Lân, 2001 * Alexander Yersin, 2015 ==Films with contributions by Trần Văn Thủy== * Hoà Bình Cho Việt Nam (participating director; made for ABC Australia) 1991 * Nam, Retour sur image (participating director; made for Quak Productions, France) 1999 ==Books== * Nếu Đi Hết Biển (If You Go to the Ends of All the Seas); 2003 * Chuyện Nghề Của Thủy (Thủy's Craft; written with Lê Thanh Dũng); 2013.

Rajakumar, then 22 years old, was involved with the editorial board of Fajar, the Socialist Club's newspaper. The team behind the newsletter were soon accused of sedition and prosecuted.

It is the ninth novel in his series of a crime solver and sports agent named Myron Bolitar. ==Plot== Myron Bolitar receives a phone call from an ex-lover, Terese, who asks him to come to Paris immediately. Upon arriving, Myron is informed by French police that Terese's ex-husband, Rick, has been murdered and Terese is the prime suspect. Terese is soon cleared of the charges. At the crime scene of the murder, blood was found that matched that of Rick's daughter. Terese informs Myron that ten years previously, her only daughter with Rick, Miriam, was killed in a car accident that led to Terese and Rick's divorce. After nearly being kidnapped, Myron catches a glimpse of a teenage blonde girl who resembles Terese and wonders if perhaps Miriam's death was faked. Myron sees the same girl again and follows her into a house in London. There, he is ambushed by terrorists who kill Rick's second wife. After murdering the lead terrorist, Myron is taken to a “black site,” a secret interrogation facility maintained by the United States government to torture suspected terrorists. When his innocence is realized, he is released but does not recall anything that happened while incarcerated. Meanwhile, back in the United States, DNA samples taken from Miriam's grave prove that she is in fact dead. Myron suspects that Terese's frozen embryos were used illegally to create a second daughter, the elusive blonde girl he has been seeking. Myron and his accomplice Win investigate the charity “Save the Angels,” which promotes adoption over stem-cell research and is run by right-wing conservative Christians. Rick had been investigating the charity shortly before being murdered. Myron and the French detective Berleand track the teenage blonde girl to a home that was pictured on the “Save the Angels” website. There, they are ambushed by a terrorist cell and Berleand is killed. Upon entering the home, Myron discovers a group of blonde, blue-eyed children who have been raised from stolen embryos by terrorists in the hopes of training them for suicide missions. The terrorist cell is wiped out by law enforcement and the brainwashed children are taken into custody. Myron tracks down Terese to Angola, where she has been hiding with her long lost daughter since the ambush in London. It is implied at the end of the book that law enforcement failed to track down all of the terrorists: a blonde, blue-eyed teenage boy with a heavy backpack is seen stepping from a bus and walking into a crowded area of tourists. ==Main characters== *Myron Bolitar: a sports agent who assists his ex-lover Terese in tracking down her long lost daughter. *Terese Collins: once a CNN anchor, divorced from Rick Collins, was Myron's lover on an island. *Windsor \\"Win\\" Horne Lockwood, III: Myron's friend from Duke and sidekick.

First calculations on the basis of wind measuring data assessed at the meteorological stations in the early 1980s rendered the surprising result of annually approx. 6,600 to 10,000 gigawatt-hour (GWh) of technically exploitable wind energy potential in Austria. Austria ranked as the world’s seventeenth largest producer of wind power with an installed nameplate capacity of 995 megawatt (MW) in 2008, behind Ireland and ahead of Greece. ==History== Back in the 1980s, there were huge private wind measurements and experiments with smaller plants. In 1994, initiated by Councilor Waltner, 110 kilowatt (kW) wind turbine was set up in St. Pölten. Another wind turbine was put into operation six months later in Zistersdorf. In 1995, the first wind turbine was built with civic participation in Michelbach. In January 1996, the first turbine of the type E-40 with 500 kW was placed in Eberschwang. Not only the absolute largest wind turbines were placed there, but with two plants the first „wind farm“ was established. In the course of 1996, no signs of new funding arrangements had emerged. It led by the end of the year in a panic reaction from the first „boom“ for wind power. 36 wind turbines with 12 MW and an annual total of 18 million kW of work hours had been set up between New Year's Day and New Year's Eve. After 1996, there were, only in exceptional cases, economic conditions for individual projects, including the wind park in Zurndorf with six plants. The pressure of individual countries and the idea that desired objectives could be reached nationwide cheaper than by any nation-state alone resulted into negotiations between federal and state governments to a new nationwide Green Electricity Act 2002 (Ökostromgesetz 2002) in spring 2002. Wind turbines with a capacity of a total of 276 MW were built in 2003. The plant output tripled from 139 MW (end 2002) to 415 MW (end 2003) within a year. ==EconomicsLife span of wind turbines=== According to manufacturers, the life span of wind turbines amounts to 25 years. Important influences on the life span are site specific (wind speed, storms, icing conditions) and the quality of the maintenance of the turbines. ===External costs=== External costs are not a part of the investment and operation costs, and are paid by the tax payer and therefore by the public. Examples of external costs for fossil fuel and nuclear electricity production are political and military securing of the access to these energy sources, costs of green house gas emissions, cleaning up of spilled oil, police operations during the transporting of nuclear wastes and other similar activities. There are no external costs for the production of electricity from wind. Wind power is a product with no hidden costs and economically the most inexpensive form of energy production. ===Property for wind turbines=== Most of the property owners are farmers. They have an additional source of income by leasing their land to the wind park operator. The prices paid for property leases for wind turbines are many times more than would normally be earned by farming the property. A wind turbine needs an area of up to 500 square metres (5,382 square feet) and the rest of the property can still be farmed without any problem. A wind turbine can also be easily and quickly dismantled. ===Costs of electricity production=== According to the costs for infrastructure, a kW of installed capacity costs between 880 € and 1,487 € (Windpark Handalm). (At the Tauernwindpark a kW costs 1,240 €). ==Installed capacity growth== The table shows an annual increase in installed wind power capacity. { style=\\"text-align: right\\"  - ! Year !

A wind park with 6 MW installed capacity will reduce approximately the following emissions yearly: {  -  Carbon dioxide  13,600,000 kg -  Sulphur dioxide  20,720 kg -  Nitrogen oxide  10,220 kg -  Carbon monoxide  8,550 kg -  Dust  560 kg -  Nuclear wastes  72 kg } Compared to oil and natural gas, wind power does not pose a threat to people or the environment. ==Gallery== Image:Plöckenpass-pass-wind- generator.jpgWind turbine on the Austrian side of the Plöcken Pass Image:Windkraftwerk Turm innen.jpgLadder providing access to the nacelle of a wind turbine in Lower Austria.

The film dramatises the 1909 Tottenham Outrage - a bungled wages-snatch which resulted in the murder of a police officer and a ten-year- old bystander as well as the two armed robbers - and the 1911 Siege of Sidney Street, in which armed police surrounded a house in East End of London occupied by a gang who had killed three police officers during a bungled attempt to break into a jeweller's shop. The film depicts the two events as both taking place in 1911, the work of the same gang.

Tables and chairs and curtains blazed away and at the end of the scene the flames were extinguished ready for the next Take. It was remarkable. Nothing was damaged. Leonard Sachs, playing Svaars (uncredited) was left in the room with the revolver; his clothes had also been fireproofed and in the long-shot flames licked from the jelly which had been put on his back. For the next shot, his close-up, he was having the jelly placed strategically on his shoulders and arms. I was talking to someone in the crew when another of the crew approached and whispered to his colleague 'Have they fireproofed his hair?' 'No, I don't think they have. It would take 20-minutes.' I was later informed that had Leonard suffered any damage, the insurance company would have paid up, but twenty minutes of the crew's time, on an hourly rate, merely to fireproof an actor's hair would have had to have been paid for by the film company.

In 1941, he graduated from the Physics Department at Moscow State University and soon after that, on 25 June 1941, volunteered to the People's Volunteer Corps to participate in Second World War. He participated in the Battle of Moscow and met the end of the war in Berlin with the 47th Army of the First Belorussian Front. After the war he worked for several years on various military related research projects in Arzamas-16. In this period of time he was greatly influenced by Nikolay Bogoliubov and Andrei Sakharov. Then, in 1954 he moved to Steklov Institute of Mathematics, where continued to work for the rest of his life. ==Research work== His first research in Arzamas-16 was devoted to various applications of plasma theory, including analysis of stationary regimes for nuclear reactors (jointly with V. N. Klimov) and analysis of temperature jumps of plasma in magnetic field. After that he started to work in collaboration with Nikolay Bogoliubov on various problems in theoretical physics and obtained several fundamental results, including development of an asymptotic method for systems with rapidly rotating phases, development of the method of collective variables which is now widely used in theoretical physics, and development of the microscopic theory of superfluidity. He made a significant contribution to the theory of double-time temperature Green's functions in statistical mechanics, where his work became world-famous. In the period 1961—1965, he developed a method of non-equilibrium statistical operator (NSO), which is now a classical tool in the statistical theory of non-equilibrium processes. This method allowed him to include non-equilibrium phenomena in the framework of statistical mechanics in a natural way following the ideas of Josiah Willard Gibbs. Using the NSO method, he constructed relativistic thermodynamics and relativistic hydrodynamics, the statistical transport theory for systems of particles with internal degrees of freedom, and the statistical thermodynamics for turbulent transport processes. Zubarev was an editorial staff member of the journal Theoretical and Mathematical Physics and a member of the International Editorial staff of the journals Physica A and Physics Letters A. ==PublicationsBooks=== #Zubarev D.

The case was removed to the local federal district court due to the diversity of citizenship in the case. The trial judge then dismissed the complaint, writing that California's 2-year statute of limitations made the claim \\"barred\\". Semtek International had also filed a claim in Maryland's state court. The court here also dismissed the complaint, but on the grounds that \\"the res judicata effect\\" precludes this separate claim in a different state.

The film skips forward to a point after the war when Captain Holland's brother, Charles Holland , is guided into the desert by Ali (Donald Pleasence) in search of his brother. They were drawn by a promissory note that had been given by Captain Holland to the Bedouin for their help and eventually taken to the British embassy for payment. Sir Charles sets off to discover the fate of his brother and eventually reaches the Bedouin camp. He is entertained by the camp's chief, Sheik Salem ben Yussef (André Morrel) and sees a young blonde boy in the camp. Later, the Sheik becomes angry at Sir Charles's line of questioning about his brother, the boy, and note and asks them to leave. Before they leave, Mabrouka gives Ali a sock containing Captain Holland's diary which he gives Sir Charles. The film skips back in time to recount the story within the diary. Captain Holland, having been tended by Mabrouka, recovers. He learns that Mabrouka is the sheik's daughter and is betrothed to Sheik Faris (Michael Craig) from another tribe. When a German reconnaissance vehicle arrives at the camp, Captain Holland hides in some Roman ruins. The senior German officer then finds Holland's service revolver in a tent. Mabrouka and Captain Holland become romantically involved to the obvious annoyance of Sheik Faris. He colludes with the Germans who return to the ruins where Holland and Sheik Yussef kill them and Faris. The romance between Captain Holland and Mabrouka deepens and they marry. Learning of the British victory at El Alamein, Captain Holland seeks to return to the British lines but finds that his wife is pregnant. A group led by the Sheik and Captain Holland travel toward the British lines but come across a column of retreating Italian vehicles. Captain Holland sustains a fatal injury rescuing the Sheik. The film returns to the present day with the Sheik handing Sir Charles a letter with his brother's will bequeathing his estate to his son. Sir Charles discusses this with his nephew but the boy decides to remain with the tribe and burns the letter. ==Cast== * Donald Sinden as Colonel Sir Charles Holland * Anthony Steel as Captain David Holland * Anna Maria Sandri as Mabrouka ben Yussef * André Morell as Sheik Salem ben Yussef * Terence Sharkey as Daoud Holland * Donald Pleasence as Ali * Ralph Truman as Major Croft * Anthony Bushell as Ambassador Baring * Michael Craig as Sheik Faris * Paul Homer as Khalil ben Yussef * Anton Diffring as Senior German Officer * Frederick Jaeger as Koch * Derek Sydney as Interpreter ==Original story== The film was based on an original story by Robin Maugham, who had served in the North African Desert during World War II.Robin Maugham biography at Robin Maugham Papers, University of Texas It first appeared as a short story Pay Bearer £20 in Cheque Au Porteur. He later published a version of the story under the title \\"Desert Bond\\" in Chambers Journal. Maugham later included the story under the title \\"The Black Tent\\" in a later anthology of his writings published in 1973 called The Black Tent - and Other Stories.British Cultural Memory and the Second World War Ed Lucy Noakes, Juliette Pattinson, 2013 p 115 In the early 1950s Robert Clarke of Associated British considered buying the screen rights to the story. He decided not to but eventually hired Maugham to be his assistant. ==Production== Producer Walter MacQuitty was an enthusiast of location filming - his most recent pictures included The Beachcomber.The film was shot at Pinewood Studios and on location in Libya. The film unit was mostly based in Tripoli. The lead actress was Italian appearing in her first English language film.Round the British Studios Nepean, Edith. Picture Show; London Vol. 66, Iss. 1710, (Jan 7, 1956): 11. Brian Desmond Hurst said all the females were played by Italians because they were unable to use Arab women.And Mother Goes, Too Author: Anthony Brown Date: Friday, Sept. 30, 1955 Publication: Daily Mail (London, England) p 6 Star Donald Sinden had previously made Above Us the Waves with producer MacQuitty and Simba with director Brian Michael Hurst. Several scenes were shot in the Roman theatre of Sabratha. The film used the site of the Roman ruins at Sabratha in Libya, which is by the sea, although the plot suggests that the camp is deep in the Libyan desert. This is a plot device to provide a bit of eye candy to the viewer and a reason for the Germans to visit in small numbers, like regular tourists. ==Reception== The Observer had trouble with the reality of the story but thought \\"the scenery is impressive and the tents... are interesting.\\" \\"Too bright, too clean, too polished\\", wrote The Times. The Monthly Film Bulletin thought the \\"intelligently constructed\\" script was undermined by \\"disappointingly slack\\" direction.BLACK TENT, The Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 23, Iss. 264, (Jan 1, 1956): 60. Filmink called it \\"entertaining\\". The film was released in the US in 1957 on a double bill with Checkpoint, also starring Anthony Steel. Turner Classic Movies calls the film \\"an odd duck... that has never received much fan love in its day or since, and in fact is barely remembered today. But it is, for one thing, the first English-language film shot largely in Libya\\" and which \\"plays like something of a prophecy – six years before the epochal on-location imagery and direct exploration of British colonialism we're all familiar with in David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia (1962), here are vast desert- dune landscapes punctuated by Englishmen and testy Bedouin on camels, with all of the culture-collision freight that implies.\\"The Black Tent at TCMDB ==Books== Theirs is the Glory: Arnhem, Hurst and Conflict on Film takes Hurst's Battle of Arnhem epic as its centrepiece and then chronicles Hurst's life and experiences during the First World War and profiles each of his other nine films on conflict, including The Black Tent..

The strategy coincided with the expansion to 3 digital channels for each FTA network and the planned phasing out of analog television in Australia. Important services from Freeview include its free-to-air channels with an enhanced EPG (electronic program guide) across all channels. Freeview also certifies televisions, set-top boxes and personal video recorders (PVR) which meet its standards. The Freeview brand was launched in November 2008 with teaser commercials promising 15 channels in 2009. The first new \\"Freeview\\" channel started on 26 March 2009 with Network Ten's One sports channel. Further advertising began on 26 April 2009, with the first Freeview certified devices appearing in retailers from May 2009. In June 2010, the second phase of devices, marked as \\"Freeview EPG\\" devices, became available in retail stores, designed to work with the newly launched interactive EPG built on MHEG-5. This Freeview EPG ceased operating on 24 November 2017, and Freeview is now focusing on its new Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) FreeviewPlus service which was launched in 2014 and incorporates an onscreen guide. ==History== Digital terrestrial television commenced in Australia on 1 January 2001, in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth using DVB-T standards. The transition from analog PAL transmissions began in 30 June 2010 and was completed by 10 December 2013. The Freeview brand was launched on 24 November 2008, while the actual service commenced in 2009 along with the rollout of a number of Freeview badged set-top boxes and integrated digital televisions. (At least four manufacturers intend to release Phase 1 Freeview devices which do not support MHEG-5.) Freeview has been criticised as being ambiguous and light on details, with criticism that certification is more about restricting devices than enabling them. The introduction of channels replacing the previous high definition simulcasts led to complaints that regular programming was no longer broadcast in high-definition. ==Ownership== The Freeview organisation comprises free-to-air licencees Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Special Broadcasting Service, Seven Network, Nine Network, Network Ten, Prime Media Group and Southern Cross Broadcasting. An ABC release stated these groups are shareholders of Freeview, though a company search revealed all shares were owned by the Nine Network. WIN Corporation was a member of the Freeview organisation until March 2012 after complaints over the organisation's role in the television industry and the cost of operations. SBS withdrew from Freeview in May 2015, citing federal budget cuts, but Freeview cannot disable SBS's HbbTV app or remove it from the airwaves. ==Freeview certification standards== Part of the Freeview initiative is to certify set-top boxes as capable of receiving free-to-air digital television broadcasts (both standard and high definition). Although certification requirements have not been formally released, Phase 1 Freeview devices will be high-definition, and capable of more advanced video encoding (MPEG-4). Recorders will not be able to skip over ads, and must enforce digital rights management. Skip features were initially limited to a minimum of 10 minutes, but these restriction were eased to 3 minutes in 2015 in response to a request from a hardware manufacturer supporting FreeviewPlus. Phase 2 required Freeview devices to feature MHEG-5 technology, which Freeview used to support its interactive electronic program guide and proposed future enhancements. The Freeview advertising for their 17-channel platform and certified products, combined with the Australian government's commercials warning of the closure of analog TV transmissions, was intended to help consumers buy appropriate devices. Freeview has threatened PVR manufacturers such as DViCO with legal action if they include the Freeview (UK) logo (which looks very similar to the Freeview Australia logo) on their Australian packaging. Eurofins Digital Testing, is the Officially Approved Test Centre for Freeview Australia conformance testing, where manufacturers wishing to deploy devices with the Freeview Australia logo and EPG can obtain pass reports. Sony Interactive Entertainment Australia added Freeview compatibility to the PlayStation 3's PlayTV digital television tuner in October 2009 with the 1.21 firmware update. The update disabled ad-skipping, reduced fast forward and rewind speed to 30x and removed the ability to copy recordings to other devices. Unlike other Freeview-endorsed devices, these restrictions can be easily bypassed on the PlayStation 3. ===High-definition=== To obtain Freeview certification, devices must include at least one high-definition digital tuner, supporting the HD formats of 576p, 720p and 1080i. ===Video decoding=== Freeview devices must be capable of receiving and decoding H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, a far less data-stream hungry standard than the initial MPEG-2 standard. The standard allows higher quality transmissions or more television channels. All broadcasters now use MPEG-4 for their primary channel HD services, as well as some additional channels (in HD and SD).http://goughlui.com/2017/06/04/analysis-freeview- sydney-18-april-2017-after-sbs-moves-to-hd-mpeg-4/ ===Digital video recorders=== Freeview devices can not skip an ad block. Initially they could skip 10-minute blocks, and fast forward and rewind at 30x speeds, but these were changed to 3 minutes and 32x in 2015. Hard drive-based recorders must offer a minimum of 160GB internal storage, with Digital Rights Management applied to recordings copied off the device. Restrictions must also be in place to ensure recordings can not be accessed if the hard drive is removed from the recorder. ===Enhanced EPG (MHEG-5) – Phase 2=== Phase 1 Freeview devices were not required to feature Freeview MHEG-5 EPG technology, and manufacturers could sell Freeview Phase 1 devices without MHEG-5 until 2012, and were not required to label such devices as Phase 1. Freeview Phase 2 certified devices incorporate a MHEG-5 electronic programming guide (EPG). In July 2009, Freeview signed a licensing deal for MHEG-5, the traditional information grid pattern EPG which is covered under patents owned by Macrovision. Freeview announced details of its EPG on 28 June 2010, with plans for a consumer launch in September 2010. The new EPG was based on the same EPG data available to all digital TV devices via the broadcast signal, but also monitored Content Reference Indicator (CRID) data embedded in the broadcast signal. The CRID data allowed recorders to detect when a program is running over schedule and continue recording. After initial confusion as to whether non-Freeview devices would still have access to the EPG, Freeview confirmed the broadcast EPG would remain. Only Freeview-endorsed PVRs featuring the \\"Freeview EPG\\" logo have access to the new Freeview EPG, although the Freeview-endorsed TiVo recorder will extract CRID data from the broadcast signal to update its own EPG (with permission from the networks), rather than relying on Freeview's EPG data. Australian EPG provider IceTV's High Court victory over the Nine Network, secured its right to supply a third-party EPG service, which may influence Freeview's long term plans for the broadcast and MHEG-5 EPG services. The ruling may also affect whether third-party EPG providers have the right to extract CRID data from the broadcast signal without permission from the networks, as the CRID data will not be encrypted. On 24 November 2014, Freeview announced that its MHEG-5 EPG service will cease on 24 November 2017, without an effect on its FreeviewPlus service. === HbbTV support === In September 2014, Freeview announced FreeviewPlus, a catchup TV and enhanced EPG service built on the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV standard. To access the service, TV and set-top boxes need to be both HbbTV compatible and be connected to the internet. While Freeview runs a FreeviewPlus certification program, any HbbTV compatible television equipment can display the apps. Initially only televisions received official FreeviewPlus certification. The first certified set-top box was released in May 2015 and the first digital video recorder – the Dish TV AerialBox T2200 – was released in August 2015. ===Non-compliant devices=== Existing digital television devices should continue to operate without Freeview certification, with the following caveats: * Only HD devices can view the HD channels * When the TV networks start transmitting in MPEG-4, non-MPEG-4 capable boxes will not be able to receive those channels. ===Government labelling scheme=== As well as Freeview labelling, the Australian Government has its own scheme for identifying digital ready televisions and set top boxes. Freeview branded set top boxes are labelled as 'High Definition Ready' under the government scheme, however non-Freeview boxes can also be labelled in the same way, leading to viewer confusion as to whether the Freeview channels will be receivable on those set top boxes without the branding. ==Channels== A Freeview compliant device will display all digital television channels broadcast in a viewer's market area, including those broadcast in high definition. While Freeview promotes its approved devices, its website notes that any HD compatible device will show the same channels. With the exception of WIN Television services and in some regional areas, most digital channels broadcast the Freeview EPG. While WIN Television stations no longer broadcast the Freeview EPG, their programming is still listed in the EPG and channels remain on the Freeview website. ==Online services== Through Freeview, the free-to-air broadcasters have signed a new initiative for an industry-wide video hub – details of what content will be carried is unknown. A consultant has been commissioned to advise on vendor partnerships, and ABC's iView technology is the frontrunner to deliver the service. Plans for this video hub have been superseded by the FreeviewPlus service. The ABC, SBS, Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten each offer \\"catch up\\" internet television services in Australia, allowing viewers to watch local and foreign content after it has been shown on their respective channels, while One allows online streaming of select sporting content, including live streams of Formula One. ===FreeviewPlus=== In September 2014, Freeview launched FreeviewPlus, its Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) service, which consists of six HbbTV apps – one for each of the five major Australian free-to-air broadcasters and a sixth cross-network electronic programming guide (EPG). Each network offers access to its catch-up TV library via its apps, plus it is possible to scroll back in time through the green button on-screen guide to view catch up programs. The service won Best Enhanced TV Service at the International Interactive TV Awards 2015. FreeviewPlus is not always available when viewing channels through regional affiliates. The Freeview website lists which catch up services and EPG listings are available by postcode. Where a user cannot access the catch up service through FreeviewPlus, it may still be accessible via a third party device running the broadcaster's app. In May 2017, Freeview announced a brand overhaul of FreeviewPlus to align it more closely with its newer Freeview FV brand. The changes would include a new logo, and a simplified user interface. === Freeview FV === In November 2016, Freeview released an app for iOS and Android devices that provides access to live-streaming of Freeview channels. While also marketed as providing access to catch-up services from within the app, the app instead redirects users to the relevant catch-up apps. As at 2 December 2018, the application is still not available for \\"Android TV\\" streaming platform. Neither is \\"SBS on Demand\\", and \\"ABC iview\\". ==Criticisms== Freeview has been criticised as being ambiguous and light on details, with criticism that certification is more about restricting devices than enabling them. Network Ten's simulcast of \\"One\\" in HD & SD was criticised by some as being a single channel, as it is not unique content and the introduction of One means Network Ten's non-sports programming is no longer broadcast in HD. Freeview certification will include at least two phases, with the Phase 1 Freeview devices not required to feature the MHEG-5 technology Freeview intends to use to support its Electronic Program Guide. In addition to the lack of detail, minimal information was given by Seven and Nine Network management regarding new channel launch dates. The original Freeview announcement stated planned May releases for the launch of new digital channels by both networks, while a later Seven release mentioned mid-2009 and then October for its secondary channel launch. ==References * Freeview Category:High-definition television Category:Digital terrestrial television in Australia Category:Privately held companies of Australia ","title":"Freeview (Australia)"},{"id":"20354156","text":"Golsen v.

Under the rule (referred to as the Golsen Rule) articulated in the case, the Tax Court may render different decisions, based on identical situations, for taxpayers that are differentiated only by the geographical area in which the Tax Court case is decided. ==Background== Jack E. Golsen of Oklahoma City purchased what was purportedly a whole life insurance policy from Western Security Life Insurance Co. However, the tax court found that the loan structure of the policy was effectively a term life policy and subject to a 4% tax. ==Implication== The Tax Court, being a national institution, hears cases that can be appealed to the courts of appeals, which lie in different judicial circuits. These courts of appeals may render different decisions for two distinct taxpayers, who have the same facts in evidence. Under Golsen, the Tax Court will, in a given case, follow the binding precedent of the Court of Appeals that would hear the appeal of that Tax Court decision in that particular case. An example of the practical effect of the Golsen rule is that if the Tax Court is hearing a case in Dallas, Texas, the Tax Court would follow the precedent of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (which consists of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi). By contrast, if the Tax Court is hearing a case in Miami, Florida, the Tax Court would follow the precedent of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, as Florida is located in the Eleventh Circuit. ==References== Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit cases Category:United States taxation and revenue case law Category:1971 in United States case law Category:United States Tax Court Category:Life insurance ","title":"Golsen v.

The station is owned by Alpha Media, through licensee Digity 3E License, LLC. Digity owns and operates radio station throughout Nebraska and the Midwestern United States. KLIR broadcasts an adult contemporary music format. ==History== The station was originally owned by the Anderson family from Denver, broadcasting an easy listening format as KOXI. In early 1984, the new General Manager and soon-to-be part owner, Stan Tafoya, negotiated a deal to bring the new call letters \\"KLIR\\", or \\"Clear\\" from a station in Denver. The Columbus station was granted the new call sign by the Federal Communications Commission on July 9, 1984. The decision to change the call letters coincided with a format change to an adult contemporary format, or \\"Soft Rock, with Less Talk\\". Under the Tafoya's leadership, the \\"Clear\\" sound was created for the community of Columbus and surrounding areas. Clear positioned itself as \\"The Radio Station Columbus Built\\", and became very successful in both ratings and revenue, still retaining many of the same programming elements today. For years, KLIR has been the most listened to radio station in the Platte County, according to the Arbitron Ratings Company. Chuck Lontine was one of the first talents hired by Tafoya, but left within the first year of the new KLIR to become a sales executive with CBS Radio in San Francisco. Tafoya then searched the Midwest for new voices, recruiting Steve Kohl from the Denver market. Kohl took the on-air name of \\"Scott Fisher\\" and helped guide the station to even greater success. A strong on-air team soon developed with Fisher in the morning and Jon Michaels in the afternoon. The credible news voice of James Nickel also contributed to the \\"Clear\\" sound. And top salesman Verl Wurtz added his play-by-play talents to the station's popular local sports programming. Tafoya left in the mid-1990s after a subsequent sale of the station to new owners. Many local business people and listeners have long cited the operation under Tafoya as a classic marketing success story, where a relatively small and unknown radio station transforms itself into the market leader. ==References== *BIA Investing in Radio Guide *Radio & Records Magazine *Broadcasting & Cable *Columbus Telegraph Newspaper *Omaha World Herald ==External links== *KLIR official website LIR Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Companies based in Platte County, Nebraska ","title":"KLIR"},{"id":"20354174","text":"The Marxist Left in Slovakia and the Transcarpathian Ukraine () was a political organisation in eastern parts of the First Czechoslovak Republic. It was one of the forerunners of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. After the defeat of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, many revolutionary refugees arrived in Czechoslovakia and intermingled with the local political movements. The emergence of the Marxist Left originated in a split in the Slovak Social Democratic Party in 1920, among sections dissatisfied with the counterrevolutionary line of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers Party towards the Hungarian Soviet Republic. A communist split was also brewing in the Hungarian-German Social Democratic Party. During the 1920 election campaign, the Hungarian-German social democrats in the Košice 20th electoral district ran a distinctively pro-communist campaign. The pro-communist forces gathered a majority at the September 1920 party congress of the Hungarian- German Social Democratic Party, declaring the Bratislava reformist leadership expelled.Duin, Pieter van. Central European Crossroads: Social Democracy and National Revolution in Bratislava (Pressburg), 1867-1921. New York: Berghahn Books, 2009. pp. 367, 371.

Kollár House, the building where the Marxist Left in Slovakia and the Transcarpathian Ukraine was foundedThe Marxist Left in Slovakia and the Transcarpathian Ukraine held its founding congress at the Kollár House in Ľubochňa on January 16, 1921. The founding congress had then been delayed for about two months, due to the December events.Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CPCz CC, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CPS CC. An Outline of the History of the CPCz. Prague: Orbis Press Agency, 1980. p. 99. The founding congress reportedly had 149 delegates (according to another account, 153), representing the different nationalities of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus'. Reportedly 88 delegates were Slovaks (or 92, according to the other account), 36 Magyars, 15 Germans, 6 Ukrainians and 4 Jews (from Poale Zion). Invited guests from the Czech Lands also participated in the proceedings. The congress approved a resolution on party organization elaborated by the Magyar section. The congress endorsed the twenty-one conditions of the Communist International, with the exception of the 17th condition (which called on all sections of the International to adopt the name 'Communist Party'). The Ľubochňa congress was of the opinion that the name of the all-Czechoslovak party to be formed had to be decided at a national founding party congress of the new party. The proceedings of the Ľubochňa congress was broken up by the Gendarmerie. Some of the delegates secretly met the following day, January 17, at Ružomberok. The meeting adopted a programme of action and approved four central press organs of the party; Pravda chudoby, Hlas ľudu, Kassai Munkás and Volksstimme. The Ružomberok meeting set up a Regional Action Committee, to be seated in Ružomberok. Under the Regional Action Committee, the Ružomberok meeting set up five District Executive Committees. One of the District Executive Committees, based in Užhorod, was in-charge of the party activities in the Transcarpathian Ukraine.

It features several characters that are equally important. It was moderately well received by the critics. It debuted simultaneously as a No. 1 New York Times best seller and a Times of London best seller. ==Plot== The story is introduced with the characters Marianne, Nash and Pietra. Pietra tricks Marianne by drugging her which leads to Nash brutally beating Marianne to death, his last words to her being: \\"Tell Cassandra I love her.\\" They remove her clothes then dress her up to look like a prostitute and toss her body in a dumpster (skip). The action switches to Tia and Mike Baye who never imagined they'd become spying, overprotective parents. But their sixteen-year- old son, Adam Baye has been unusually distant and aloof lately, and after the recent suicide of his classmate and close friend, Spencer Hill, who took vodka and tablets on his school's roof in the night and died, they can't help but worry. They install a spy program on Adam's computer and within days they are jolted by a strange message to their son from a correspondent known only as CeeJay8115: \\"Just stay quiet and all safe.\\" The detective investigating Marianne's murder, Loren Muse, realizes that Marianne is not a prostitute and that someone has gone to great lengths to try to fool the authorities. However, Marianne's face has been so badly mutilated that it is impossible for anyone to identify her. Susan and Dante Loriman meet with their son's (Lucas) doctor (Mike Baye) only to be told Lucas needs a kidney transplant urgently. Neither parent is a suitable match and with some investigating, Mike finds out that Dante is not the biological father to Lucas. Meanwhile, browsing through an online memorial for her son, Betsy Hill is struck by one photo in particular that appears to have been taken on the night of Spencer's death and that he wasn't alone. She thinks it's Adam Baye standing just outside the camera's range. She confronts him and asks about the photo, but he runs away. The daughter of Marianne and Guy, Yasmin is being bullied at school because her teacher (Joe Lewiston) commented on her facial hair in front of the class. Yasmin shows her only friend Jill Baye (Mike and Tia's daughter) her father's (Guy) gun, which is already loaded and hidden in a drawer in their house. She tells Jill how she dreams of getting revenge on Mr Lewiston. Worried about the safety of their son, Mike tells Adam he must attend a hockey game with Mike's friend Mo. This is a diversion to try to avoid the party referred to in an email Mike and Tia found on their son's computer a few days earlier, the party claims that there will be alcohol and drugs served. Adam is not around when his father comes to pick him up to attend the hockey game, and Mo tells Mike how to use the GPS on Adam's phone to track him. Mike ends up following him into a very bad part of the Bronx. He starts to chase after what looks to be one of Adam's friends, but is then confronted and severely beaten by an unknown group. He winds up in hospital and still hasn't found his son. Reba Cordova is Nash's next victim, and she is likewise beaten to death, for reasons still unknown to the reader. Before killing her he also told her the same thing Nash told Marianne: \\"Tell Cassandra I love her.\\" We find out Cassandra died a few years ago due to cancer, and was deeply loved by Nash. Cassandra is the sister of Joe Lewiston, and had another brother named Curtis, who was murdered in an assumed robbery. Mike's professional partner, Ilene Goldfarb, confronts Susan to find the real father of Lucas, as he could be a potential kidney donor. Susan tells her that she was raped, and that it was impossible for her to contact him to ask if he could be tested as a potential donor. Later the readers find out that the reason that her rapist cannot be contacted is because Susan had killed her attacker. She then confides that the murder was set up to make officials think the cause of the murder was most likely a robbery, this leads the reader to believe that Curtis Lewiston is the rapist. The events start to come together by the end of the book as the connections of the murders, Adam's disappearance, Spencer's apparent suicide, and the need for a good donor for Susan's son are explained, and the origin of all of the mayhem is revealed.

The song was penned by the editor of the Southern Literary Messenger, John Reuben Thompson, in 1863. Each stanza mentions a separate campaign, starting with First Battle of Bull Run, the Valley Campaign, the Battle of Drewry's Bluff, the Peninsula Campaign, the Battle of Cedar Mountain, the Second Battle of Bull Run, and the Battle of Fredericksburg. ==Lyrics== > Would you like to hear my song?

The opera premiered at the Teatro San Angelo in Venice on 9 November 1726. Vivaldi later revised the opera numerous times for several different performances throughout the second half of his career. ==History== Dorilla in Tempe was well received at its premiere and became one of Vivaldi's personal favorites. The opera was the first work by Vivaldi to include in its cast the mezzo-soprano Anna Girò, who went on to form a lifelong friendship and professional partnership with the composer. The opera was also noted for its visual aspects, boasting some of the most elaborate sets (by Antonio Mauro) in the history of opera up to that point and for its beautiful choreography by Giovanni Galletto. In 1728 the opera was revived at the small Teatro San Margherita in Venice with an almost identical text, and again in Prague at the Sporck Theatre in the spring of 1732, this time with substantial alterations to the libretto. During Carnival 1734 the opera was revived at the Teatro San Angelo, this time as a pasticcio using recent music by other composers, including Hasse, Giacomelli and Leo. ==Music== The only surviving score of Dorilla in Tempe, located in Turin, is from this 1734 pastiche production. The score includes not only the many insertions into the opera but also a number of the deletions from earlier productions. Unusually for Vivaldi’s operatic scores, the sinfonia is clearly linked with the main opera: it follows the title-page instead of preceding it, and the music of its final movement – a C major version of the opening of the Spring concerto– reappears in the opera’s opening chorus, appropriately in praise of spring. The opera displays a pastoral nature, particularly in its choral and ballet music, that is at times mixed with heroic elements, as in the elaborate celebrations at the end of Act 2, where a hunt is enacted to the inevitable horn accompaniment. ==Pasticcio Arias== https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorilla_in_Tempe Giacomelli Bel piacer saria d’un core - Nomio Rete, lacci, e strali adopra - Filindo Non vo che un infedele - Filindo Hasse Mi lusingha - Elmiro Sapro' ben con petto forte - Elmiro Non ha piu pace - Filindo Leo Vorrei dai lacci scogliere - Elmiro Sarro Se ostinata - Admeto ==Roles== {  !Role !Voice type !Premiere Cast,italianopera.org, accessed 16 December 2010 9 November 1726 - Dorilla, daughter of Admeto, in love with Elmiro soprano Angela Capuano, \\"la Capuanina\\" - Admeto, King of Thessaly bass Lorenzo Moretti - Nomio/Apollo, the god Apollo disguised as a shepherd, in love with Dorilla contralto castrato Filippo Finazzi - Elmiro, a shepherd, in love with Dorilla soprano (breeches role) Maria Maddalena Pieri - Eudamia, a nymph, in love with Elmiro mezzo-soprano Anna Girò - Filindo, in love with Eudamia contralto castrato Domenico Giuseppe Galletti } ==Synopsis== The story takes place in Tempe. Like the music, the plot intertwines pastoral and heroic elements and centers on the shepherd Nomio, who is in fact Apollo in disguise. Nomio falls in love with Dorilla, the daughter of Admeto, King of Thessaly, who is herself in love with the shepherd Elmiro. Admeto is forced by the gods to save his kingdom by offering his daughter as a sacrifice to the sea-serpent Pitone, but she is rescued just in time by Nomio. Nomio claims the hand of Dorilla as his reward, but she remains reluctant and escapes with Elmiro. The pair are captured, and Elmiro is sentenced to death. Finally, however, the intervention of Nomio, revealing his divine identity, saves the situation and Dorilla and Elmiro are reunited. ==Recordings== * 1994 Dorilla: María Cristina Kiehr, Elmiro: John Elwes, Admeto: Philippe Cantor, Nomio/Apollo: Jean Nirouët.

The prime location for the film is in a large hall at a bottle recycling factory in Kochi. Machu starts off rather humbly but soon gets rich. Now his scrap business has branches all over India. Machu, who is uneducated, keeps a low profile and prefers to hang out with his two friends, Shukkoor (Salim Kumar) and Narayanan (Bijukuttan). His life changes when Andrews Perreira (Nedumudi Venu), an Anglo Indian investor cheats machu into investing all his wealth into Perreira's investment company. Perreira acts as if he tried to commit suicide to give his investment fraud a lively touch. The innocent investors, including Machu, believe this and forgive Perreira, believing it wasn't his fault. The movie takes a wild turn when Machu meets Perreira's daughter, Diana, and wishes to marry her. But Perreira betrays Machu again by interchanging his daughter with his neighbour's daughter, an old friend of Machu's. On the wedding day, all falls apart as Machu and his friends goes to confront Perreira for his crimes, but Perreira with his daughter had already escaped to Singapore. Then the movie goes into utter humour as Machu and his sidekick (Jayasurya) tries to locate Perreira and Diana in Singapore. Tamil and Telugu actor Navneet Kaur is the heroine. She plays the role of Perreira's daughter, Diana. \\"The character comes from a rich family and has lived in Singapore. So we decided to go for someone who looks cosmopolitan,\\" says the director duo regarding their choice. Apart from Kochi, the other locations for Love in Singapore are at Karaikudi and Singapore. ==Cast== * Mammootty as Machu * Navaneet Kaur as Diana Pereira * Suraj Venjaramoodu as Peethambaran * Jayasurya as Tony * Bijukuttan as Narayanan * Salim Kumar as Shukkoor * Lalu Alex as Police officer Rathnam * Rajan P.

Published in 1961, it was O'Brien's fourth novel and the third to be published. (He wrote The Third Policeman in 1939, but it was published only posthumously, in 1967). Set in turn-of-the-century Dublin, The Hard Life is a satirical Bildungsroman that deals with the education and upbringing of the narrator, Finbarr, and his brother Manus. The novel offers a mocking critique of certain representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, the development of Irish identity and the functioning of formal education. The novel was initially very popular, with its first print run selling out within forty-eight hours (p. 271), and it has been republished several times in Ireland, Britain and the United States, both as a stand-alone work and, most recently, in Flann O'Brien: The Complete Novels (Everyman's Library, 2007).O'Brien, Flann. The Complete Novels, with an Introduction by Keith Donohue. Everyman: London, 2007. Page numbers refer to this edition. ==Plot summary== The story opens with the narrator, Finbarr, recalling the death of his mother in 1890, when he was around five years old. He and his brother Manus (often referred to simply as \\"the brother\\") are raised in the home of their half-uncle, Mr Collopy. Collopy lives with his partner Mrs Crotty – it is unclear if they are married and the narrator can only speculate as to why she retained the name of her first husband – and Annie, Collopy's daughter from an earlier marriage. Finbarr describes Collopy's home as a squalid environment where the boys are served greasy meatballs for dinner, a household with a \\"dead atmosphere\\" offering little opportunity for amusement. Collopy and the parish priest, a German Jesuit domiciled in Dublin and bearing the comical name of Father Fahrt, frequently indulge in long bouts of drinking, and none of the adults exhibits much concern for the child's welfare. Finbarr attends Synge Street Christian Brothers School, the former school of O'Brien/O'Nolan himself, while Manus attends Westland Row Christian Brothers School. Both schools are run by the Catholic Christian Brothers, both boys detest their schools with equal passion, and O'Brien mocks both with equal contempt. Finbarr's first impression of his school is that it resembles a prison: he describes the horrors of corporal punishment by \\"the leather\\" in detail, and refers to \\"struggling through the wretched homework, cursing Wordsworth and Euclid and Christian Doctrine and similar scourges of youth\\".O'Brien 2007, p. 517 Manus is both resourceful and deceitful, and while still at school he comes up with a cunning idea to raise money. He offers distance-learning courses for a small fee on a wide variety of subjects about which he knows very little. He researches information on these subjects in the local library and re-hashes the prose of encyclopedias, writing in a pseudo- intellectual, abstruse style deliberately designed to look impressive but remain incomprehensible. This business proves extremely successful, and eventually he leaves school and emigrates to London, where he offers a wider range of courses and also develops medicinal remedies to sell. Meanwhile, Mr Collopy is dedicating his time to the pursuit of a certain social or political cause, but never states the nature of this cause directly. Early in the novel it appears that the issue holds considerable gravity: it seems to concern women's rights, and Collopy is rallying the Dublin Corporation to implement some kind of change and trying to persuade Father Fahrt to secure the support of the church. However, later in the novel it becomes clear that the issue in question is the establishment of public lavatories in Dublin and that, while Collopy is campaigning for this goal, he is just as prudish as the Dublin authorities he is fighting against, because he will mention the issue only through euphemisms or circumlocutions. When Collopy falls ill Manus sends Finbarr one of his potions, \\"Gravid Water\\", to help him. However, Finbarr administers the wrong dosage, which causes rapid weight gain and eventually leads to Collopy's death. Manus also devises a scheme to get Collopy and Father Fahrt an audience with Pope Pius X, so that Collopy can win papal support for the lavatory campaign. However, Manus is aware that the Pope will have little time for Collopy and Fahrt, and enjoys the spectacle of their humiliation, as the angry Pope, in a mixture of Latin and Italian, quite literally sends them to Hell. The novel closes with Finbarr vomiting out of a feeling of disgust at his brother's lack of morals, and at the squalid and hypocritical world he lives in. The novel opens in 1890 and the date on Collopy's gravestone is 1910, so the events in the novel should span twenty years. However, this appears to be contradicted by the fact that the narrator, Finbarr, is still at school when Collopy dies, which is highly unlikely, as he should be twenty-four years old. ==Major themes== The Hard Life is pervaded by an atmosphere of squalor and despair. The Dublin that the boys inhabit is a decaying city and they are brought up in a broken family. Much of the satirical humour of the book targets the Roman Catholic Church and its schools: the theological disputes between Father Fahrt and Collopy are ridiculed, and often even the boys correct their misunderstandings. However, as Anne Clissmann has pointed out, O'Brien remained a faithful Catholic throughout his life and his attack can be read as being aimed at particular individuals and practices, rather than the institution as a whole.Clissmann, Anne. Flann O'Brien: A Critical Introduction to his Writings Dublin: Gill and MacMillan, 1975. p. 269 The book also pokes fun at education and how gullible people can be deceived by flowery prose.Clissmann, p. 279 Manus is easily able to deceive the public when he sells pamphlets on diverse subjects, despite relying on repackaging information from library books. While Manus's scheme initially seems clever and attractive to the narrator, after Collopy's death he realises its moral bankruptcy and rejects it. ==Literary significance and reception== The first print run of The Hard Life sold out in Dublin in less than forty-eight hours, and initial reviews were very positive. Graham Greene, to whom the novel is dedicated, responded warmly to the dedication, and reviewers such as Maurice Edelman and Anthony Burgess compared the novel, favourably, to the works of James Joyce.Clissmann, p. 288 Other newspaper reviews praised the work for its \\"first-rate dialogue\\", its \\"wild, hilarious, irreverent comedy\\" and its \\"glorious version of the English language\\".Reviews cited at http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Hard-Life/Flann- OBrien/e/9781564781413, visited November 23, 2008. However, many recent critical studies of the novel have suggested that it is the weakest of O'Brien's novels. Keith Donohue (2007) writes that, \\"in terms of sheer artistry, the novel is far more conservative\\" than O'Brien's early work and considers O'Brien's choice of themes \\"oddly oblique\\", given that (in his opinion) the prudish Catholicism that O'Brien was targeting was waning by the early 1960s anyway.Donohue, K. Introduction to The Complete Novels, pp. xvi. Sue Asbee (1991) comments that \\"it is unlikely that the work would remain in print today\\" if it were not for the strength of O'Brien's other novels.Asbee, Sue. Flann O'Brien. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 2001. p. 95. Anne Clissmann (1975) suggests that the \\"lavatory humour\\" of the novel quickly loses its appeal and concludes that \\"The Hard Life is ultimately unsatisfying to read because it lacks coherence and is too one-sided a vision of squalid reality.\\"Clissmann, p. 290 ===References to other works=== The Bildungsroman genre typically deals with a protagonist coming of age, and experiencing the joys and sorrows of growing up: education, finding a job, finding a partner. The Hard Life clearly mocks this tradition: Finbarr and Manus grow up in a squalid society that has little to offer them. Manus makes money and wins friends, but only by deception, and although the novel's conclusion shows Finbarr rejecting this path, it is uncertain how his future will develop. The Hard Life is often compared to the prose of James Joyce, particularly his collection of short stories Dubliners. Sue Asbee suggests that such a comparison is \\"almost insulting\\" to Joyce, but accepts that both deal with the squalor of turn-of-the-century Dublin, alcoholism and the power of the Catholic Church. She notes that The Hard Life, like most of the stories in Dubliners, ends with a moment of enlightenment for the protagonist but without resolution of the problems.Asbee, p. 91 It is also noteworthy that the narrator falls in love with a girl called Penelope and compares her with the character of this name in Greek mythology, perhaps recalling Joyce's Ulysses. Anne Clissmann points out that the device of using language pedantically as a source of humour has much in common with O'Brien's other novels, especially The Dalkey Archive, although, in her view, The Hard Life is less successful because it \\"gives the impression of trying to be too funny, too pedantic.\\".Clissmann, p. 272 Donoghue suggests that The Hard Life has more in common with O'Brien's journalism, written under the pen-name Myles na gCopaleen, than with his other novels.Donohue, p. xvi ===References to history and geography=== The novel is set amid the rise of Irish nationalism, the Gaelic revival, and increased calls for Home Rule and Irish independence. Nationalist feeling does not feature prominently in the novel, but Collopy does comment on the rise of the Home Rule movement and remarks with pleasure that he sees young men playing \\"native games\\" rather than \\"this new golf\\", which \\"for pity's sake isn't a game at all\\". By placing these words in the mouth of one of his limited comic characters, Collopy, O'Brien is lightly mocking Irish identity by showing how it is based on anti-British sentiment as much as a positive affirmation of Irishness.Clissmann, p. 273 A number of real Dublin locations are mentioned in the novel. Collopy lives at Warrington Place, an extension of Herbert Place. As noted above, the two schools alluded to in the novel are real: Synge Street Christian Brothers Schools and Westland Row Christian Brothers School. The Dublin Corporation, which rejects Collopy's plans for the installation of women's lavatories, was a historical body of city government which has now been renamed Dublin City Council. The closing chapters describe real locations in Rome and the Vatican. Manus buries Collopy in Rome at the Campo Verano cemetery and claims that the inscription he places on the headstone is an ironic joke on Keats' headstone. According to the novel, Keats' headstone reads \\"Here lies one whose name was writ on water\\" and Collopy's \\"Here lies one whose name was writ in water.\\" (p. 602) The joke here refers to Collopy's devotion to lavatories: Collopy wished to his name written on the walls of the lavatories. However, either Manus or O'Brien himself is mistaken: Keats' headstone itself reads \\"Here lies one whose name was writ in water\\", a self-lacerating reference to the negative reviews that his poetry received.See a photographic image of Keats' gravestone at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/John_Keats_Tombstone_in_Rome_01.jpg ==Publication history== Details of the first edition: 1961, Dublin, Ireland: MacGibbon and Kee. , Pub. date 1 December 1961, Hardback. The first American edition was published in 1962 by Pantheon Books. There have been numerous editions by publishers based in Britain, Ireland and the United States since 1962. Most recently The Hard Life has been included in Flann O'Brien: The Complete Novels, New York, Toronto and London: Everyman's Library, 2007. . Hardback. At least one critic has posited that O'Brien was hoping that The Hard Life would be banned under the Censorship of Publications Act because this would arouse curiosity about the book, and probably lead to increased publicity and sales. Censorship would also have given him the opportunity to enter into a legal battle against the government, with the possibility of further publicity.Clissmann, p. 292 ==Footnotes== Category:1961 novels Category:Irish bildungsromans Category:Novels by Flann O'Brien Category:Novels set in Dublin (city) ","title":"The Hard Life"},{"id":"20354443","text":"Sam Fisher may refer to: * Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell), protagonist of Ubisoft's Splinter Cell video game series * Sam Fisher (footballer) (born 1982), Australian rules footballer * Sam Fischer (born 1991), Australian musician == See also == * Samuel Fisher (disambiguation) ","title":"Sam Fisher"},{"id":"20354455","text":"The 1998 SEC Championship Game was won by the Tennessee Volunteers 24-14 over the Mississippi State Bulldogs.

His friend J. Edward Hollenbeck persuaded Bell to join him in California. James Bell arrived in San Francisco, California, in 1875, then traveled down the coast to Los Angeles. In 1875, Bell and his extended family purchased about of the California property, near modern Los Angeles. The area was originally part of the Spanish land grant Rancho San Antonio. Between 1870 and 1890, the grant was broken into smaller land holdings and acquired by newly arriving settlers. Bell engaged in cattle raising and dry farming, developed water wells, and rented land to vegetable farmers. The Bell family initially lived at the Hollenbeck's \\"Town House\\" on 4th and Breed Street until moving to a \\"ranch\\" in 1876. The family's \\"Bell House\\" was built in an early Victorian architectural style. Bell helped the area develop into a small farming and cattle raising community. Originally known as Obed, the California town's name was changed in 1898 to Bell to honor the pioneer founder. He served as Bell's first postmaster and rose through the ritual ranks of the Masonic Lodge. Late in life, Bell would subdivide his land into tracts of farms and move to Santa Fe Springs to live with his son Alphonzo, Sr. He was one of the founders of Occidental College. ==Family life== Bell married Dorothea (\\"Dolly\\") A. Reasons on July 17, 1856 in Missouri and they had children George, Mary, and Otis F. Bell, Sr. Dolly Bell died on November 27, 1864. In June 1866, Bell married Susan Abia Hollenbeck, a sister of his friend J. Edward Hollenbeck. James Bell had left his family in Missouri when he headed west in 1875. Six-months pregnant, Susan Bell and her four-year-old daughter Maude got on a box car to catch up with James in California. The fifth child, Alphonzo, Sr., was born in 1875. James George Bell's son, Alphonzo Bell, Sr., was an oil millionaire, real estate developer and champion tennis player. He established the Bell Petroleum Oil Company, and used oil revenues to develop Bel-Air Estates. His grandson, Alphonzo E. Bell, Jr. was a popular 20th Century California Congressman.

Inflorescences are about long and carry up to four blossoms. The large, showy flowers are – across. They may be pink, often with white margins on the segments, or they may be white, sometimes with a pink flush or pink stripes. The lip, which has yellow markings at the base, is also marked with maroon stripes and blotches. The blossoms are very flat. == Distribution == Miltoniopsis vexillaria is found in isolated patches in the central mountain region of Colombia and on the western slopes of the Cordillera Occidental from the department of Antioquia in the north and also further south in northern Ecuador. It grows on the margins of montane forests at between and . ==Culture== Miltoniopsis vexillaria is a cool growing species and thrives in a temperate, frost-free climate. It should be grown in moderate light with intermediate to warm temperatures and requires a humidity range of 50 to 90%. During hot summers, the plant should be watered daily. In the winter, when the weather is cold and dull, the plant should be watered sparingly, but the growing medium should not be allowed to dry out. The winter temperatures should not fall below 10° Celsius (50° Fahrenheit), and good ventilation is essential. ==Discovery== Miltoniopsis vexillaria was first discovered in 1867 by the Victorian plant collector, David Bowman, who had been sent to South America by James Veitch & Sons of Chelsea, London. Bowman was unable to send a live sample back to England before he died of dysentery. Subsequently, other plant collectors, including Gustav Wallis and Benedikt Roezl, also came across the plant but the first collector to successfully introduce it to England was Henry Chesterton. In 1870, Chesterton had been sent by Harry Veitch to Colombia with the specific instructions to locate and bring back to England \\"the much-talked-of and long-desired \\"scarlet Odontoglossum\\". According to the account in Hortus Veitchii: > \\"Provided with but the scantiest information as to the native habitat, long > kept secret and shrouded in mystery, Chesterton started, and not only > succeeded in discovering the plant, but safely introduced it to Chelsea, > where it flowered for the first time in 1873.\\" ==Varieties and cultivars== There are many cultivated varieties of M. vexillaria including: *M. vexillaria var.

Part of the Great South Bay, Patchogue Bay is a cove between the points of land known as Blue Point and Howells Point, and across which ferries run south to Fire Island. ==OwnershipGrant=== The Patchogue Bay, bay bottom up to the barrier beach, is owned by Brookhaven town because of a grant from the King of Britain long before the existence of the USA. It has been repeatedly adjudicated that the grant in the Dongan patent (Brookhaven Town, 1686) is valid. ===Federal government claim=== However, since 1968, the Federal Government has been attempting to take title of and claim, by adverse possession, of the bay bottom of both Islip and Brookhaven Towns, extending outward from the barrier beach. It (the Federal Government) has repeated published intentionally erroneous maps (as the one below) showing boundaries of the Fire Island Seashore extending out into the bay when the real boundary is the shoreline of the barrier beach. ==Habitat== A number of habitats make up the bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the coves of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled by a number of factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab.Map showing Patchogue Bay and Fire Island Ferry service. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, Atlantic croaker, northern kingfish, and northern puffer. There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout. Today, hard clams are the bay's principal resource, but this was not always the case. The once well-known eastern oyster fishery collapsed in the 1940s and 1950s; that collapse was linked to algal blooms of a minute species that inhibited shellfish growth. These blooms were believed to be the result of high inputs of organic wastes, primarily from large-scale duck farms located on tributaries of the bay. A similar problem exists today in lawn fertilizer run off and is directly responsible for brown tide algae bloom and thus indirectly responsible for the collapse of the bay scallop population. During 1999 there was a significant spring drought, which may be verified through the Brookhaven National Laboratory meteorological records. That summer the bay was the cleanest it had been in living memory; one could see clean sand bottom through 5 to 6 feet of water at the edge of the flats. Local baymen and sailors aged 50 and older remarked that they had never seen the bay so clean. There was no \\"brown tide\\" algae bloom that year. ==Fire Island access and Patchogue bays and bridges== * Davis Park * Watch Hill * Fire Island National Seashore * The Great South Bay * Moriches Bay * Swan River New York Google maps * Pine Neck - (Boat launch) * Patchogue River www.lat-long.com * Sandspit Park Beach & Marina * Shorefront Park - Patchogue (Bandshell) * Mascot Dock & Marina * South Shore Estuary * Fire Island Wilderness * Fire Island Inlet Bridge * Great South Bay Bridge * Outer Barrier Islands ==Photo gallery== File:PatchogueBay 7-4-09.jpg File:Great South Bay.JPG File:Sunset on Patchogue Bay, Long Island.jpg File:Swan River, Long Island Sunset.jpg File:River & Patchogue Bay.jpg File:Great South Bay 11772.JPG File:GreatSouthBaySunset-sm.gif File:Pine Neck Grass Dunes.JPG File:Pine Neck Winter.jpg File:Pine Neck shore.JPG File:Mascot Dock Sunset.jpg File:Mascot in winter.jpg ==See also== * Brookhaven * Suffolk ==Notes== The original 17th Century Crown Patents, including the Nicolls, Dongan and Fletcher patents, gave certain Long Island townships title to the land within their bounds including the land under water (see O'Brien v Town of Huntington, 66 AD3d 160, 164 [2d Dept 2009]; Melby v Duffy, 304 AD3d 33 [2d Dept 2003]; Nance v Town of Oyster Bay, 23 AD2d 9 [2d Dept 1965]).

Its oldest predecessor, Rikshospitalet (The National Hospital), was established as Norway's national teaching hospital in 1826 mainly on the basis of the Military Hospital founded in 1807, while its academic tradition dates back to the establishment of the Faculty of Medicine in 1814. From the late 19th century the hospital was established as one of Europe's most modern hospitals and leading medical research institutions. Oslo University Hospital was formed by the merger of the then-three university hospitals in Oslo in 2009.The hospital includes 325 buildings that are primarily spread across four main campuses in Oslo: Rikshospitalet, Ullevål, Aker and Radiumhospitalet. It is one of two university hospitals affiliated with the University of Oslo, alongside Akershus University Hospital. ==History== Oslo University Hospital was established on 1 January 2009 by the merger of three state-owned university hospitals in Oslo, all of which were affiliated with the University of Oslo: *Rikshospitalet (The National Hospital; founded 1826) *Ullevål University Hospital (founded 1887) *Aker University Hospital (founded 1895) Rigshospitalet (the pre-1907 spelling) was established as Norway's national teaching hospital affiliated with the university in 1826, mainly on the basis on the Military Hospital that had been established during the Napoleonic Wars in 1807.Militærhospitalet som ble rikshospital Rigshospitalet also incorporated Akershus Regional Hospital, founded 1756. The hospital's academic tradition dates back to the establishment of the Faculty of Medicine of the Royal Frederick University in 1814, which itself was a continuation of the traditions of the University of Copenhagen and Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen following the 1814 Dano–Norwegian split. In the late 19th century the Norwegian Parliament decided to develop Rigshospitalet as a \\"model hospital\\" that would be comparable to the world's then-leading hospitals, such as Germany's Charité. As a result the hospital was massively expanded to become one of the most modern hospitals in the world, and a major research institution. Ullevål Hospital was established in 1887 and was a teaching hospital affiliated with the university from its very first years.

Smith (born March 15, 1970, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida) is a Democratic member of the Florida Senate, representing the 31st District, which includes eastern Broward County since 2012. ==History== Smith attended Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he received a degree in political science. He participated in Model United Nations while in college, even traveling to Moscow, Russia to participate in the International Model United Nations in 1990. Following his undergraduate work, he attended Florida State University, where he graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1995. He started working for the law firm Johnson, Anselmo, Murdoch, Burke & George, P.A., where he currently works. Many critics argue Smith's employment with Johnson, Anselmo, Murdoch, Burke & George, P.A. has led to conflicts in interest during his career in the State Senate: previously serving as a lobbyist for Florida Power & Light (FP&L;), Smith protested the confirmation of two former Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) commissioners while serving as State Senator. Though he claimed his reservation for their confirmation was in an effort to increase diversity, it is arguably suspicious that these two commissioners had just denied FP&L;'s bid for their largest rate increase in history. In 1995, he was appointed to the Fort Lauderdale Planning and Zoning Board. ==Florida House of Representatives== Following the decision by Democratic State Representative M. Mandy Dawson to run for the Florida State Senate rather than seek re-election, Smith ran to succeed her. Smith faced Perry E. Thurston, Jr., Hazel K. Armbrister, and Fred Segal in the Democratic primary, which was opened to the entire electorate because all of the candidates were Democrats. Though Smith came in first place with 47% of the vote, the fact that he did not attain a majority mandated a run-off election between Smith and Thurston, the second-place finisher, which he won in a landslide, receiving 58% of the vote. He was unopposed in the general election, and was re-elected without opposition in 2002. In 2004, Smith faced Sallie Tillman-Watson in the Democratic primary, but he turned away her challenge easily. He was re-elected to his final term in the general election without opposition. From 2004 to 2006, he served as the Minority Leader of the Florida House of Representatives. ==Florida Senate== In 2008, when State Senator M. Mandy Dawson was unable to seek another term due to term limits, Smith ran to succeed her in the 29th District, which includes parts of Broward County and Palm Beach County. In the Democratic primary, Smith defeated Earlen C. Smiley, the Deputy Superintendent of the Broward County School Board; Michael E. Carn; and Terry A. Williams Edden in a landslide. In the general election, he was elected without opposition. When Florida Senate districts were reconfigured, Smith was drawn into the 31st District and ran for re- election there. He faced Republican Chris Smithmyer, who was recruited by the Republican Party of Florida to run in Smith's district due to his similar- sounding name. Smith was endorsed for re-election by the South Florida Sun- Sentinel, which praised him for becoming \\"the lead advocate for issues dear to Senate Democrats, from closing corporate tax loopholes to providing more state funding to make higher education more accessible and affordable.\\" In the end, Smith was overwhelmingly re-elected over Smithmyer, receiving 84% of the vote. For the 2012-2014 legislative term, Smith served as the Senate Democratic Leader, and, by virtue of the fact that his party was in the minority, the Minority Leader of the Senate. ==2016 Broward County Commission, District 9 Election== Chris Smith fell short of beating incumbent Broward County Commissioner Dale Holness in the race for the District 9 seat. ==References * Florida Senate - Chris Smith * Florida House of Representatives - Chris Smith * Chris Smith for State Senate Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Florida state senators Category:Members of the Florida House of Representatives Category:Florida Democrats Category:Johnson C.

He also toured the British Isles in 1927 with the national side. He claimed the only wicket of his first-class career during this tour, that of Sussex bowler Reginald Hollingdale.

Subsequently he was the National Director of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) from 2003 to 2008 and a candidate in the July 2009 presidential election, although he decided to boycott the election shortly before it was held. He is the President of the Patriotic Union for National Renewal (UPRN). ==Political career== Dzon was born in Ingouelé, near Gamboma. After studying in France, he began working at the BEAC in September 1977, rising to senior management positions. He became Director-General of the International Bank of Congo (BIDC) in April 1985. During the single-party rule of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), which ended in 1991, Dzon was not a member the ruling party. He helped to found the UPRN in 1991 and became its President.\\"Dzon Mathias\\", Congo Brazzaville: Les Hommes de Pouvoir, number 1, Africa Intelligence, 29 October 2002 . He participated in the 1991 Sovereign National Conference, and during the Conference he placed fourth in the vote for the position of transitional Prime Minister. He was subsequently elected to the National Assembly as the UPRN candidate in Gamboma constituency. Under Dzon's leadership, the UPRN did not initially support the government or the opposition, but in September 1994 it joined the Democratic and Patriotic Forces (FDP) opposition coalition, thereby allying itself with the PCT, led by Denis Sassou Nguesso.Political Parties of the World (6th edition, 2005), ed. Bogdan Szajkowski, page 140. Dzon resigned from his post as Director-General of the BIDC in 1995 and instead took a post at the BEAC's agency in Pointe- Noire. He went into exile in 1996, going to Gabon and then France. Following Sassou Nguesso's return to power in the June-October 1997 civil war, Dzon returned to Congo-Brazzaville from France and was appointed by Sassou Nguesso as Minister of Finance and the Budget on 2 November 1997., Afrique Express .

He said in April 2000 that someone had tried to poison him with a paralysing liquid that was injected into his clothes. According to Dzon, the clothes were injected while in his suitcase at the Maya-Maya Airport as he prepared to fly to an International Monetary Fund conference in Washington, DC. The clothes subsequently changed color, were tested at a laboratory in the United States, and were found to contain a toxic substance. He did not specify who he believed to be responsible for this, but said that the people involved wanted him to replace him as Finance Minister.\\"Congo-Brazzaville minister alleges poisoning attempt\\", BBC News, 28 April 2000.

At an opposition rally later on the same day, Dzon and other candidates called for the people to boycott the election.

He also criticized the government for spending money on the independence celebration while the people endured continuing poverty and deprivation. On 5 June 2014, Dzon complained in a press conference that the government was mistreating him by refusing to allow him to leave the country, vowing to take the matter to international courts. He said that he had been barred from leaving the country on the previous day in order to have a medical check-up and visit family in France.

It is based on the television series of the same name, and was released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. In a twist on the legend of King Arthur, the player controls Flicker, a dragon who lives in Camelhot castle and is in love with Princess Flame, but is not eligible to ask for her hand in marriage because he is not a knight. However, the King has announced a dragon tournament, where the winner will not only win the princess, but also become the new king. The writing in the game is influenced by Monty Python. The voice cast is headed by Joseph Rye, Terry Jones, Cheech Marin and Harry Shearer, along with supporting performances from voice actors such as Jim Cummings, Jeff Bennett, Kath Soucie, B. J. Ward, Roger Rose, Michael Bell, Brian George, Rob Paulsen, Robert Ridgely, Jess Harnell, Gregg Berger, and Charlie Adler. ==Synopsis== As Flicker, the player must collect various objects and interact with a cast of dragon and human characters in order to solve puzzles. As is the case with many other graphic adventure games, the player can never reach a game over or otherwise reach a point where a puzzle can not be solved. The player's overall quest is to become a dragon knight to compete in the grand tournament and win the heart of Princess Flame. However, the player discovers an evil human plot to take over the kingdom by kidnapping the princess. The evil Sir George and his wizard companion Mervin are plotting to conquer the kingdom of Camelhot and exterminate the dragons. After Sir George's failed siege against Camelhot, he declares his ally, the Black Dragon to win an upcoming dragon tournament the winner of whom shall be married to Flame and become the new king. A young inventor named Flicker wishes to marry King All-Fire's daughter Flame, but he is rejected due to lack of knighthood. While rescuing King All-Fire's knights from their investigation of Black Dragon, he finds this Black Dragon is a mechanical dragon, then sabotages it. Sir Loungealot takes Flicker as a squire, but takes credit for Flicker's victory on the Black Dragon, prompting Flame to leave the castle, only to be kidnapped by Sir George and Mervin. The King's Chancellor is secretly working for Sir George and steals Flicker's invention so Sir George can build a more powerful Black Dragon II. To prevent the King from noticing Flame's absence, Flicker has the court jester Trivet impersonate her. Flicker infiltrates Castle Grim disguised as Sir George, releases Flame and gets the Black Dragon II destroyed. By the time Flicker returns to Camelhot, his deception is exposed and Flicker has to rescue the King's knights to earn his respect. The next day, Flicker proves his worth at the Cave of Dilemma gaining his knighthood in time for the dragon tournament. Flicker makes it to the final, defeating Sir Loungealot, but then Sir George and Mervin invade with a newer Black Dragon. Flicker destroys the mechanical Black Dragon once again. Mervin accidentally causes Sir George to fuse with the Black Dragon, transforming into the Black Dragon III. Sir George swallows Flicker, Mervin and King All-Fire, but Flicker cuts off the machine's power supply, causing the machine to be destroyed, reverting Sir George back to his human form and the machine lands on the Chancellor. King All-Fire asks Flicker to marry his daughter as he secretly always wanted him to, before he gained knighthood. Flicker happily accepts the request. ==Development== The game was first announced under the title \\"Dragons of the Square Table\\" and was slated for a late 1995 release. The release date was pushed back a year, possibly so as to coincide with the debut of the Blazing Dragons TV series. ==Reception== Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the PlayStation version an 8 out of 10, praising the \\"side-splitting\\" humor, and the challenging puzzles, while commenting that the built-in hint feature opens the game up to players of all skill levels. GamePros Scary Larry commented positively on the animation and the voice acting's exaggerated accents, but found the puzzles too difficult and said the game is too similar to Discworld to appeal to anyone who did not enjoy that game. Next Generation reviewed it roughly six months later, with the reviewer remarking that \\"for the most part the game is enjoyable.\\" He particularly praised Cheech Marin and Harry Shearer's acting, and said that though the frequent load times make it out-of-place on consoles, it is virtually the only option available on consoles for enthusiasts of graphic adventure games. Reviewing the Saturn version, GameSpot commented, \\"It's not particularly impressive in any respect, but the game is fun, with a lot of fairly obscure puzzles to solve, oddball characters to meet, and plenty of bad jokes to go around.\\" Rob Allsetter of Sega Saturn Magazine panned the game, saying the humor, the plot, the interface, the graphics, and the acting are all awful. ==References== Category:1996 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Crystal Dynamics games Category:Dragons in video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:ScummVM supported games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Single- player video games Category:Video games based on Arthurian legend Category:Video games based on television series Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Blazing Dragons (video game)"},{"id":"20355131","text":"The 39th Grey Cup was the Canadian Football League's championship game of the 1951 season, played on November 24, 1951.

Like many other informal settlements, it was named after former housing minister and anti-Apartheid activist, Joe Slovo. With over 20,000 residents, Joe Slovo is one of the largest informal settlements in South Africa. While residents have been fighting for 15 years for their right to live in Langa, the settlement recently came into prominence when it began to oppose the national pilot housing project of minister Lindiwe Sisulu called The N2 Gateway. Residents have opposed the government's request that they be forcibly removed to Delft, a new township on the outskirts of the city. After a High Court ruling by controversial judge John Hlophe in favor of the Government, many experts in constitutional law have claimed the ruling to be unjust and against the South African Constitution. Since then, residents have appealed the decision and taken it to the South African Constitutional Court. In August 2008, about 200 Joe Slovo residents travelled by train, spent the night at the Methodist Church in Braamfontein, and arrived at the Constitutional Court to protest proposed evictions. They were accompanied in solidarity by the Anti-Eviction Campaign as well as residents from Symphony Way, an informal settlement that is also in conflict with the government over the N2 Gateway Housing Project. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and the Community Law Centre from the University of Cape Town, who joined the case as friends of the court, argue that the mass relocation will significantly impact residents' quality of life. During the case, constitutional court judges expressed concern over Judge John Hlophe's High Court ruling.

By 3 August, the estimated death toll was 41 people, and 48 schoolgirls were marooned in a school in the Darbhanga district. Last accessed 3 August 2007. By 8 August, the flooding had affected an estimated 10 million people in Bihar. Army helicopters delivered food packets to Bihar residents and 180 relief camps were established. By 10 August, aid workers in Bihar reported that there was a dramatic increase of people with diarrhoea and by 11 August, flood deaths were still occurring. Total deaths recorded in 2007 Bihar floods was 1,287, which was second highest death toll in state after 1,399 deaths in 1987 Bihar floods. ==Incident== The states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were the most affected due to their high population density. Nearly two million people, spread over eleven districts in Bihar, grimly endured the floods. Many major rivers, including the Ganges, Punpun, Bagmati, Gandak and Kosi, were flowing above danger mark. Flooding had submerged more than 40 percent of Bihar. Rainfall in July was five times higher than the monthly average over a 30-year period. The area around the town of Darbhanga was one of the worst affected areas in the state. Roads leading to the remainder of the state were impassible by the flood. Many people had to seek shelter on higher ground and many people were marooned. Some people lamented that help from the state authorities was not forthcoming.Jason Motlagh, Floods devastate northern India state 20 million people affected and 4,000 die – officials blame onset of climate change, Chronicle Foreign Service, 5 October 2007, \\"Flooding has submerged more than 40 percent of Bihar, and Relief Commissioner R.

About 29,000 houses were destroyed and 44,000 houses were damaged by the floods. Thousands of people were shifted to places of safety, including relief camps. ==Response== The United Nations described the flood, the worst to occur in the living memory of Bihar. ==Relief workAssistance recommended by CRF=== The general recommendations suggest that a flood victim would be entitled to, a compensation of Rs. One lakh to the next of kin for every deceased person subject to certification by a competent authority. Compensation packages for fully damaged pucca house- Rs 25,000/-, Fully damaged kachcha house – Rs. 10,000/-, Severely damaged pucca house Rs 5,000/-, Severely damaged Kachcha house – Rs 2,500/-, Partially damaged pucca and kachcha house – Rs 1,500/-, Hut- Rs 2,000/- Compensation of Rs 35,000/- to any person injuring his eyes / limbs with damage between 40 and 75 per cent. Beyond that the compensation would be Rs 50,000/- compensation for grievous injury with hospitalization up to one week – Rs. 2,500/-. For hospitalization of more than a week, the compensation would be Rs. 7,500/- lost clothing and utensils Rs 1,000/- per family. Immediate sustenance – Rs. 20/- per adult per day and Rs. 15/ per child per day for 15 days. This can be extended to 30 days in case of extreme situation. Rs 2/- per day per infant for additional nutrition as per ICDS norms for a maximum period of 30 days.

Fishermen losing their traditional craft, Partly – Rs 2,500/- +net; Fully Rs 7,500/- +Net. Besides, there are various other provisions that a flood victim is entitled. Similar assistance is available for other artisans like weavers etc. subject to certification from the competent authority.Mishra Dinesh Kumar, Bihar Floods of 2007– 1, EPW, 23 November 2007 ===Assistance implemented=== Grain (38,86,896 Qtls) distributed to affected families was around 50 lakhs. For emergency expenses (Rs 20/- per adult and Rs 15/- per child) that a person is entitled for, GoB had, till August 2008, paid Rs. 84.05 Crores against a demand of Rs. 1105 Crores made to the Center. This was just about 8 per cent of the requirement. As far as CRF is concerned, there are no unlimited funds available with it. In the past five years Bihar has received only Rs.123.66 Crores in 2000–01, Rs. 129.84 in 2001–02, Rs. 136.33 Crores in 2002–03, Rs. 143.15 Crores in 2003–04 and Rs. 150.30 Crores in 2004–05. GoB is supposed to add 25 per cent more to this sum to claim the Central assistance. One can well imagine the gap that exists between the available small funds to the tune of Rs. 150 Crores against a demand of Rs. 8,000 Crores. Some money may be available through the channels of National Calamity Contingencies Fund (NCCF) but that too is drop in the ocean. The rest will have to be borne by the state Government or by the affected family itself. GoB asserts that it has spent all the money that it had with it (Rs. 850 Crores) to meet the flood disaster this year and it has further spent a sum of Rs. 250 Crores from other sources and has no money left to do any relief any more unless some help pours in from outside. The Chief Minister has requested the Center to allocate funds for that but such requests have a history of getting ignored. ==See also== *2008 Bihar flood *2008 Indian floods *Koshi river *Floods in Bihar *2004 Bihar flood == References == Bihar flood Category:Floods in Bihar Category:2007 floods ","title":"2007 Bihar flood"},{"id":"20355151","text":"Thomas Muster was the defending champion, but lost in the second round this year.

The dura mater is the tough, outermost of layer of the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. A spontaneous CSF leak, arises idiopathically, and is opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks. It is one of several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks caused by one or more holes in the dura. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches, which worsen when standing, and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth. A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood at the site of the leak, a fibrin glue injection, or surgery. The set of symptoms associated with a sCSF leak is referred to as a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS). A sCSF leak is uncommon but not rare, affecting five out of every 100,000 people. On average, the condition develops at age 42, and women are twice as likely to be affected. Some people with a sCSF leak have a chronic leak of cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated patching attempts, leading to long-term disability due to pain and being unable to be upright, and surgery is often needed. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American neurologist Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s. ==Classification== Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks are classified into two main types: cranial leaks, and spinal leaks. The vast majority of leaks are spinal. Cranial leaks occur in the head, and in some of these cases, CSF can leak from the nose, or from the ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), diminished volume, and pressure of the cranium. While this symptom can be referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low CSF volume. For this reason, a SCSFL is referred to as CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension. ==Signs and symptoms== {  style = \\"float:right; margin-left:15px; text- align:center\\" + Symptoms resulting from nerve impact ! Nerve !! Function !! Symptoms -  optic (2)  optic nerve crossing  blurred and or double vision -  chorda tympani (Branch of 7)  taste  taste distortion -  facial (7)  facial nerve  facial weakness and numbness - vestibulocochlear (8)  hearing, balance  hearing and balance problems -  glossopharyngeal (9)  taste  taste distortion } Most people who develop a sCSF leak feel the sudden onset of a severe and acute headache. This headache is usually made worse by standing and typically becomes prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling to the point of incapacitation. Some patients with a SCSFL will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. This is known as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak. Apart from headache, about 50% of people with a CSFL experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF can sometimes be felt or observed as a discharge from the nose or ear. Lack of CSF pressure and volume can allow the brain to sag and descend through the foramen magnum (large opening) of the occipital bone, at the base of the skull. The lower portion of the brain is believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms. Nerves that can be affected and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right. ===Complications=== Arnold–Chiari malformation is a condition where the cerebellar tonsils have descended, and should be considered in differential diagnosis of SCSFLS Several complications can occur as a result of SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the brain is severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches. People with cranial CSF leaks, the rarer form, have a 10% risk of developing meningitis per year. If cranial leaks last more than seven days, the chances of developing meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to the sterile conditions of the leak site. When a CSF leak occurs at the temporal bone, surgery becomes necessary in order to prevent infection and repair the leak. Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation. Low CSF volume can cause the cerebellar tonsil position to descend, which can be mistaken for Chiari malformation; however when the CSF leak is repaired the tonsil position often returns to normal (as seen in upright MRI) in this \\"pseudo-Chiari\\" condition. A further, albeit rare, complication of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia due to a sudden and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare complication of SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where the ability to move one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve. There are documented cases of reversible frontotemporal dementia and coma. Coma due to a CSF leak has been successfully treated by using blood patches and/or fibrin glue and placing the person in the Trendelenburg position. Empty sella syndrome, a bony structure that surround the pituitary gland, occurs in CSF leak patients. ==Causes== A spontaneous CSF leak is termed so as it has previously been thought to be idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown. The evidence of the last decade suggests however, that these leaks result from either a discogenic pathology, such as microspur, osteophyte or intra-dural disc herniation that pierces the dura like a knife, connective tissue disorder (which can often lead to discogenic pathology), or spinal drainage problems. ===Discogenic causes=== The most common cause of an intractable \\"sCSF\\" leak is discogenic, either from an intra-dural disc herniation, osteophyte or microspur on the disc or vertebral body. \\"Recent radiological and microsurgical investigations revealed that a calcified, degenerative bony microspur is often the culprit lesion in cases of intractable CSF leaks. Arising from the level of the intervertebrate disk space, these microspurs pierce the ventral dura and produce a slit-like defect a few millimeters in length. These microspurs and the associated CSF leak have to be localized exactly, and then they are amenable to surgical treatment.\\" ===Connective tissue theory=== Various scientists and physicians have suggested that SCSFLs may be the result of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those affected demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLs. Roughly 20% of patients with a SCSFL exhibit features of Marfan syndrome, including tall stature, hollowed chest (pectus excavatum), joint hypermobility and arched palate. However, no other Marfan syndrome presentations are shown. ===Spinal drainage theory=== Some studies have proposed that issues with the spinal venous drainage system may cause a CSF leak. According to this theory, dural holes and intracranial hypotension are symptoms caused by low venous pressure in the epidural space. When inferior limb muscles pump blood towards the heart and pressure in the inferior vena cava vein becomes negative, the network of epidural veins is overdrained, causing CSF to be aspirated into the epidural space. True leaks can form at weak points in the spinal meninges. Therefore, the observed CSF hypotension is a result of CSF hypovolemia and reduced epidural venous pressure. ===Other causes=== Cranial CSF leaks result from intracranial hypertension in a vast majority of cases. The increased pressure causes a rupture of the cranial dura mater, leading to CSF leak and intracranial hypotension. Patients with a nude nerve root, where the root sleeve is absent, are at increased risk for developing recurrent CSF leaks. Lumbar disc herniation has been reported to cause CSF leaks in at least one case. Degenerative spinal disc diseases cause a disc to pierce the dura mater, leading to a CSF leak. ==Pathophysiology== Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of the brain and contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine, there is no risk of meningitis. ==Diagnosis== The primary place of first complaint to a physician is a hospital emergency room. Up to 94% of those suffering from SCSFLS are initially misdiagnosed. Incorrect diagnoses include migraines, meningitis, Chiari malformation, and psychiatric disorders. The average time from onset of symptoms until definitive diagnosis is 13 months. A 2007 study found a 0% success rate for proper diagnosis in the emergency department. Diagnosis of CSF leakage can be done by various imaging techniques, chemical tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and assays are the most common types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators. A clinical exam is often used as a means to diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak. ===CT=== Diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leak is performed through a combination of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery. ===MRI=== There is disagreement over whether MRI should be the diagnostic tool of choice. Magnetic resonance imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, subdural hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying supine) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are more than twice as effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, also known as Chiari malformation. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including whiplash strain to the dura. An alternate method of locating the site of a CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has been effective in identifying the sites of a CSF leak without the need for a CT scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography. ===Assay=== When cranial CSF leak is suspected because of discharge from the nose or ear that is potentially CSF, the fluid can be collected and tested with a beta-2 transferrin assay. This test can positively identify if the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid. ===CSF analysis=== Spinal needles used in lumbar puncture and introduction of contrast into the spine Patients with CSF leaks have been noted to have very low or even negative opening pressures during lumbar puncture. However, patients with confirmed CSF leaks may also demonstrate completely normal opening pressures. In 18–46% of cases, the CSF pressure is measured within the normal range. Analysis of spinal fluid may demonstrate lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein content or xanthochromia. This is hypothesized to be due to increased permeability of dilated meningeal blood vessels and a decrease of CSF flow in the lumbar subarachnoid space. ===Clinical presentation=== The diagnostic criteria for SCSFLS is based on the 2004 International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) (Table 1) (50) criteria. However, the presentation of patients with confirmed diagnosis may be very different from that of the clinical diagnostic criteria and cannot be considered authoritative. ==Treatment== Initial measures can include rest, caffeine intake (via coffee or intravenous infusion), and hydration. Corticosteroids may provide transient relief for some patients. An abdominal binder, which increases intracranial pressure by compressing the abdomen, can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people. ===Epidural blood patch=== autologous blood and injected in the epidural space in order to close holes in the dura mater. The treatment of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into the area of the hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching. ===Fibrin glue sealant=== If blood patches alone do not succeed in closing the dural tears, placement of percutaneous fibrin glue can be used in place of blood patching, raising the effectiveness of forming a clot and arresting CSF leakage. ===Surgical drain technique=== In extreme cases of intractable CSF leak, a surgical lumbar drain has been used. This procedure is believed to decrease spinal CSF volume while increasing intracranial CSF pressure and volume. This procedure restores normal intracranial CSF volume and pressure while promoting the healing of dural tears by lowering the pressure and volume in the dura. This procedure has led to positive results leading to relief of symptoms for up to one year. ===Neurosurgical repair=== For patients that do not respond to either epidural blood patching or fibrin glue, neurosurgery is available to directly repair leaking meningeal diverticula. The areas of dura leak can be tied together in a process called ligation and then a metal clip can be placed in order to hold the ligation closed. Alternatively, a small compress called a pledget can be placed over the dura leak and then sealed with gel foam and fibrin glue. Primary suturing is rarely able to repair a CSF leak, and in some patients exploration of the dura may be required to properly locate all sites of CSF leak. ==Prognosis== Long-term outcomes for people with SCSFLS remain poorly studied. Symptoms may resolve in as little as two weeks, or persist for months. Less commonly, patients may suffer from unremitting symptoms for many years. People with chronic SCSFLS may be disabled and unable to work. Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common. ==Epidemiology== A 1994 community-based study indicated that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study, women were found to be twice as likely to be affected as men. Studies have shown that SCSFLS runs in families. It is suspected that genetic similarity in families includes weakness in the dura mater which leads to SCSFLS. Large scale population-based studies have not yet been conducted. While a majority of SCSFLS cases continue to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, an actual increase in occurrence is unlikely. ==History== Spontaneous CSF leaks have been described by notable physicians and reported in medical journals dating back to the early 1900s. German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand reported in 1938 and 1953 what he termed \\"aliquorrhea\\", a condition marked by very low, unobtainable, or even negative CSF pressures. The symptoms included orthostatic headaches and other features that are now recognized as spontaneous intracranial hypotension. A few decades earlier, the same syndrome had been described in French literature as \\"hypotension of spinal fluid\\" and \\"ventricular collapse\\". In 1940, Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic wrote about \\"headaches associated with decreased intracranial pressure\\". The full clinical manifestations of intracranial hypotension and CSF leaks were described in several publications reported between the 1960s and early 1990s. Modern reports of spontaneous CSF leak have been reported to medical journals since the late 1980s. ==Research== Tetracosactide is a corticosteroid that causes the brain to produce additional spinal fluid to replace the volume of the lost CSF and alleviate symptoms, and has been given intravenously to treat CSF leaks. In three small studies of 1-2 patients suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume necessary for a patient to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness. The gene TGFBR2 has been implicated in several connective tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. A study of patients with SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene. Minor features of Marfan syndrome have been found in 20% of CSF leak patients. Abnormal findings of fibrillin-1 have been documented in these CSF leak patients, but only one patient demonstrated a fibrillin-1 defect consistent with Marfan syndrome. ==See also== * Subdural effusion ==References External links == Category:Ailments of unknown cause Category:Central nervous system disorders Category:Spinal cord ","title":"Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak"},{"id":"20355156","text":"The Humber Keel \\"Comrade\\" at Hull Marina, showing the square rigged sails. The Humber Keel was a type of sail craft used for inshore and inland cargo transport around Hull and the Humber Estuary, in the United Kingdom, particularly through the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The square sail arrangement of the ship is most probably a descendant of the Saxon ship of the fifth century AD. The term \\"keel\\" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word \\"ceol\\", which referred to a ship built using a longitudinal strengthening beam (keel) together with a single mast and square rigging.Maritime Museum of Bergen The remains of keels from the 13th century have been excavated, and the keel is identified as a specific class of vessel in the Tudor records kept by the Corporation of York.Humber Keel and Sloop Preservation Society - Humber Keel Origins , accessed 6 February 2011 Early keels were designed to work in waterways which were only deep, but could still carry 40 to 50 tonnes of cargo.The Shell Book of Inland Waterways, (1981), Hugh McKnight, David and Charles, Such boats were clinker-built, meaning that the planks overlapped one another, but this gradually gave way to carvel construction, where the planks join edge to edge. First the bottom of the hull was carvel-built, with the sides still clinker-built, and then the whole boat used the newer method.Humber Keels and Keelmen, (1988), Fred Schofield, Terence Dalton Ltd, Keels were constructed to a variety of sizes, between long and between wide. They had strongly built hulls with a bluff bow, were steered by a tiller, and were designed to work in shallow waters, so that they could be used on the inland waterways connected to the Humber. By the 19th century, most of the hulls were built of oak, and the design was later copied by steel replacements. In the 20th century, steam and diesel engines replaced sail, with grants available to convert sailing vessels to mechanical power before the Second World War. All of the sailing keels had gone by 1949, but one has been preserved and returned to sail by the Humber Keel and Sloop Preservation Society. One advantage of the design was the ability to sail very close to the wind, which was essential on the narrow waterways on which they plied. They were also very manoeuvrable, and a single person could handle one on narrow and quiet waters. Stability was aided by a huge pair of leeboards, since the vessels did not have a central keel, and the small topsail was used when they were navigating the canals and rivers, but not usually when they were on the Humber estuary.The Humber: Geography, History, Local Craft, (1980), Anthony Watts, Lockington Publishing The dimensions of these craft were influenced by the gauge, or width, of inland waterways created or modernised during that period. In comparison to the widespread use of the Narrowboat standard, far fewer inland waterways were designed to accommodate the larger Humber Keel gauge vessels. This standard is still used on associated waterways today. ==References== Category:Sailboat types Category:Ships built on the Humber Category:Traditional boats ","title":"Humber Keel"},{"id":"20355192","text":"Carter Career Center Howard P.

A native of the US state of Virginia, he was known for his oratory skills and he pushed for Liberian independence from the American Colonization Society. Teague drafted the Liberian Declaration of Independence in 1847 and was later a member of the Senate of Liberia\\"Calumny refuted by facts from Liberia; with extracts from the inaugural address of the coloured President Roberts; an eloquent speech of Hilary Teage, a coloured senator\\", 1848 and served as the new country’s first Secretary of State. ==Early life== Teague was born free in the United States in the state of Virginia in 1805. His mother was Frances Teage and his father Colin Teague, a former slave, became a Baptist missionary during efforts to establish the colony of Liberia. The family emigrated to West Africa in 1821 to help establish the colony of former slaves and other African Americans with support from the U.S. government, Christian organizations and slaveholders. The younger Teague served as a Baptist minister in Monrovia and was a merchant trading in palm oil. In 1835, Teage became the owner and editor of the Liberia Herald in Monrovia, after John Brown Russwurm left to become governor of the Republic of Maryland. As editor, Teage became a big promoter of Liberian independence and combined republicanism, black nationalism, and Christianity to make his case.Carl Patrick Burrowes, \\"Black Christian republicanism: a Southern ideology in early Liberia, 1822 to 1847, The Journal of Negro History, Vol. 86, 2001 He remained the newspaper's head until 1849, when he left to devote full attention to politics. ==Political career== In 1835, Teage became Colonial Secretary for the Liberian colony. In 1839, he was the clerk of the convention which presented the settlers' views to the American Colonization Society regarding constitutional reform. He was later an instrumental figure at the Constitutional Convention of 1847 - representing Montserrado County1847 Constitution of Liberia \\\\- in both debating and ratifying Liberia's constitution. He also wrote the country's Declaration of Independence, which railed against their treatment as slaves and second class citizens in the United States. Teague became the republic's first Secretary of State after Liberia declared independence in 1847.The Challenge of Our National Purpose and Agenda... Teage also composed Liberia’s hymn of independence. He died in Liberia on May 21, 1853, and at the time was the country's attorney general. ==References *Masterpieces of Negro Eloquence -- Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson *Lectures on Slavery, and Its Remedy -- Amos Augustus Phelps, Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society *Virginia Emigrants to Liberia Category:1853 deaths Category:1802 births Category:Members of the Senate of Liberia Category:People from Virginia Category:Foreign Ministers of Liberia Category:Americo-Liberian people Category:Attorney generals of Liberia Category:Liberian journalists Category:Liberian Baptists Category:Liberian businesspeople Category:Politicians from Monrovia Category:19th-century journalists Category:Male journalists Category:19th-century male writers Category:Independence activists Category:American colonization movement ","title":"Hilary Teague"},{"id":"20355233","text":"In digital photography, the Camera Image File Format (CIFF) file format is a raw image format designed by Canon, and also used as a container format to store metadata in APP0 of JPEG images.

Examples: :A point in time: He was born on 6 May, 1980. :A duration: The show lasted 7 minutes. :A frequency: The pump circulates the water every 2 hours. Initially, temporal expressions were considered a type of named entities and their identification was part of the named entity recognition task. Since the Automatic Content Extraction program in 2004 there has been a separate task identified and called Temporal Expression Recognition and Normalisation (TERN). Timex evaluation is now evaluated in two major temporal annotation challenges: TempEval and i2b2, both of which prefer the TimeML-level TIMEX3 standard.See TIMEX3 at timeml.org ==Approaches== Similarly to NER systems, temporal expression taggers have been created either using linguistic grammar- based techniques or statistical models. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtained better results, but at the cost of months of work by experienced linguists. There are many such systems available now, so creating a temporal expression recognizer from scratch is generally an undesirable duplication of effort. Instead, current approaches focus on novel subclasses of timex. Statistical systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data and are usually applied to the recognition task only (although there is work done using machine learning algorithms to resolve certain ambiguities in the interpretation step).See, for example, == Notes  References == * * Category:Computational linguistics Category:Data modeling languages Category:Time ","title":"Temporal expressions"},{"id":"20355267","text":"Latukan volcano is a potentially active stratovolcano in the centre of a chain of young E-W-trending stratovolcanoes in northwest Mindanao, southeast of Lake Lanao, province of Lanao del Sur, island of Mindanao, in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

Movie World, which originally opened on 26 December 2008. A sequel to the show, titled Hollywood Stunt Driver 2 made its debut in February 2014. The first revision of the show replaced the Police Academy Stunt Show and put guests in the middle of an action movie set on location in Italy where stunt drivers are shooting the scenes for the new upcoming movie directed by Morgan Ross, a hot shot movie producer. The show features gunshots, explosions and car chases. Some of the features of the show include a police car split in half and a race car airborne. The show cost A$10 million to build and has an audience capacity of 2000. The second revision will be run by Showtime FMX and feature motorcycle and car stunts. ==History== First rumours of a new stunt show surfaced in October 2007 with report that a Hot Wheels branded stunt show would replace the Police Academy Stunt Show by 2009. The same source stated that the new stunt show was inspired by the Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show at Disney's Hollywood Studios. In April 2008, Warner Bros. Movie World confirmed that the Police Academy Stunt Show would be removed by the end of the month and replaced with Hollywood Stunt Driver by October. Within two months of closing, nothing remained of the Police Academy Stunt Show. Significant demolition and construction was required to extend the old Police Academy Stunt Show arena. Not only is the new Hollywood Stunt Driver arena wider, it is also deeper as well. However, despite a scheduled October opening date, Hollywood Stunt Driver did not open until 26 December 2008. Even then it was described as in \\"preview\\" mode by the show's creator, Michael Croaker. Several of the stunts originally meant to be a part of the show were not included in the final cut including ramp-to-ramp jumps. For Warner Bros. Movie World's 2009 Halloween Fright Nights event, the park teamed up with Showtime FMX who performed the Bloody Freestyle MotoX show in the Hollywood Stunt Driver arena. This was followed by similar shows in the park's subsequent Halloween events. Showtime FMX also ran the MotoMonster Xtreme show which replaced Hollywood Stunt Driver from 26 June 2011 through to 18 July 2011 as alternative winter holiday entertainment. On 21 November 2013, Hollywood Stunt Driver had its last show, with Showtime FMX's Overdrive show taking its place for a limited season until February 2014. Hollywood Stunt Driver 2 will be run by the Showtime FMX team and open to the public on 20 February 2014. ==Hollywood Stunt Driver (2008–2013)== Audience members being filmed and shown on the big screen during the pre-show. ===Plot=== Pre-show The doors open 30 minutes prior to show start due to guests coming in and taking their seats.Warner Bros. Movie World showtimes. Retrieved in park, April 2009. Approximately 5 minutes before the show is set to begin, Dave (the cameraman) and Marty (a new crew member) comes out and tells the audience that they're on location in Italy shooting a scene for a new action movie, directed by Morgan Ross. They ask for individual volunteers from the audience to act out various scenes such as being in an armed hold-up, pointing at the getaway vehicle and ooohing and aaahing at near-misses. The final piece of filming with the audience is a mexican wave featuring all 2000 audience members. Dave then sends Marty off to get the buggy and to reset red rally car. A safety spiel then follows stating \\"In the interest of safety, ... please do not try anything of what you see here today, on your way home\\". Introduction After over a minute of excitement-building music, a countdown is shown on the big screen. Once the countdown reaches zero, a black car, labelled \\"Polizia\\" (Italian for Police), appears under the big screen. The car drifts around the arena before being joined by a second police car. These two police cars proceed to drift in a figure 8 manner providing several near-misses before lining up perpendicular to the audience. At this moment a red rally car races out of left side of the arena and performs a 360, before drifting into the space left by the two police cars. The Hell Drivers are introduced before Morgan (the director), Ally (the assistant director), and Marty come out to the arena in the buggy. Morgan completes a short spiel about the movie before Mr. Hudson (the producer) interrupts through a video feed on the big screen. Scene 1 A Polizia car drifting in pursuit of the rally car. Scene 1 begins with Ally giving a short summary of what will happen in the scene. She then asks Dave to send a crew member to reset a rally car. At this moment Marty reverses the car into the set and parks it in front of the jewellery store. Before Marty has a chance to get out of the car, Morgan says action, and two criminals come onto the screen on a motorbike. Trevor jumps off and breaks into the jewellery store. The other remains outside until a police car comes drifting from the right hand side of the arena. When the other thief comes out to find the motorbike gone, he runs over to the rally car and opens the door to find Marty sitting inside. The thief then proceeds to throw Marty out of the car before jumping in himself and driving the car in donuts around Marty. Annoyed, Morgan cuts the scene and sends Marty to catering to get some coffee and donuts. After an interlude by Mr. Hudson, furious about the need to re-shoot the first scene, the scene continues from where it left off. The rally car speeds up continuing the donuts that ended the first scene before speeding to the far left corner of the arena where a police car suddenly appears. The rally car brakes with just centimetres to spare. It then reverses half the width of the arena before performing a reverse-180 turn and driving towards the second police car at the far right of the arena. The rally car then speeds up to the left end of the arena with the second police car following it. At this point the rally car drifts the corner before returning to the right side performing a 180 skid to park the car perpendicular with the right wall. The two police cars follow performing the same manoeuvre resulting in the three cars being in parallel with each other. The rally car first races off the arena through the centre exit. The police cars then meet in the middle and perform donuts, with the nose of each car nearly touching the next, before following the exit of the rally car. At this point the motorcyclist makes his return by shooting a third police car with his gun, which causes it to split in half. Scene 2 The motorcyclist riding through the wall of fire concludes Scene 2. Before moving onto the second scene the audience is treated to some of the footage edited on the big screen. This short clip features some pre-filmed shots with those that include the volunteers. The second scene begins with the rally car racing in from the left hand side and performing a 360 turn. This is followed by the two police cars who race in moments later. The three cars exit from the far right and return in the middle of the arena. The rally car then skids 180 and stops while the two police cars circle it. It then proceeds to reverse out of the arena. Upon returning, the car begins to perform a variety of figure 8 near-misses with the two police cars in reverse. Unknown to the audience at the time is that when the car is reversed out of the scene, it is swapped for a specifically designed, reverse car. The car is then swapped back to the forwards driving car in a similar style. At this point all three cars drive along a two-wheel kicker ramp, which allows the cars to drive on two wheels. All three cars drive in a figure 8 motion around the arena on two wheels before returning to all four at the same moment. The scene ends with the return of the motorcyclist who rides through a wall of fire before being stopped by the police. Finale To re-shoot the first scene the rally car must be returned to outside the jewellery store. Without thinking, Dave sends Marty to do it again. A few moments later, vision from inside the rally car shows Marty's panicked state when he loses control of the car. At this instant, the rally car comes out onto the arena and begins driving wildly around the arena before taking the far left exit of the arena, labelled \\"Parking\\". After some security camera vision shown on the big screen, the rally car appears on the rooftop before crashing into a building, flying over more rooftops before landing in a second building. At this point some rocket-style fireworks and a large fireball explode out of the building. Once the fire has cleared, the rally car drives out of the first floor door of one of the shops. To conclude the show, all of the Hell Drivers come out including the specially designed reverse car, which features a modified outer-shell. ===The Hell Drivers=== Some of the Hell Drivers pose for a photo opportunity daily in Main Street. The Hollywood Stunt Driver team are known as the Hell Drivers. At the time of the show's launch, the team was coordinated by Gavin Coleman and included: * V8 Supercar Driver – Warren Luff * Former Australian Ironman Champion – Guy Andrews * Former Police Academy Stunt Show performer and stuntman – Shea Adams * Former Police Academy Stunt Show performer, International Stuntman and Australian Stunt Riding Champion – Cameron Ambridge * Drift Australia's – Eugene Arendsen * Leading Australian Drift Racer – Tony Harrison * Leading Australian Drift Racer – Mattie Taylor * Stunt driving instructor and professional stuntman – Karl Van Moorsel * Australian Superdrift champion – Travis Roberts * International stuntman – Mark Tearle * Stuntrider – Ben Siemer ===Cars=== To create the show Warner Bros. Movie World purchased a fleet of Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Xs. One of the cars has had its shell removed and now exists on a specially designed rig that simulates the car flying across the rooftops of buildings. A second car has also had its shell modified to sit on reverse to display the effect of a backwards driving car. ==Similar stunt shows== A similar stunt show exists in two Disney theme parks. Moteurs... Action! Stunt Show Spectacular and Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show exist at Walt Disney Studios Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios respectively. Similar to Hollywood Stunt Driver, the show features a single red car being chased by multiple black cars while a movie is being produced. However, these two shows include more cars, due to a larger arena size and show length. Another main difference is the red car in the Disney shows is considered the \\"hero car\\" with the black cars labelled as the \\"bad guys\\". This is the reverse in Hollywood Stunt Driver. The attraction at Disney World closed down in 2016 to make way for Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. ==Hollywood Stunt Driver Pit Pass== From 26 December 2010, Warner Bros. Movie World began offering the Hollywood Stunt Driver Pit Pass. For a fixed cost, guests can pay to receive a behind the scenes tour of Hollywood Stunt Driver, reserved show seating, lunch, photo and a stunt driving experience. Guests can experience the stunts shown in the show and receive a USB copy of the session at the end. ==See also== * Warner Bros. Movie World * Lights, Motors, Action!

It is run at Auteuil over a distance of 5,100 metres (about 3 miles and 1½ furlongs), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June. ==History== The race was first run on May 25, 1874, the same day as the inaugural running of the Grand National de France (now the Grand Steeple- Chase de Paris). It was originally open to horses aged four or older, and it was initially contested over 4,000 metres. This was increased to 4,800 metres in its second year, and to 5,000 metres in 1880. The race was given a new date in 1882 – it was moved to the Wednesday after the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris, which continued to be run on the last Sunday in May. The following year saw the launch of a new steeplechase at Auteuil, the Prix des Drags, and this was scheduled for the Friday of the same week. This week of top class jump races became known as the Grande Semaine d'Auteuil. The Grande Course de Haies was run as a handicap until 1889, but since then it has held weight for age conditions. The race was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918. During World War II it was cancelled only once, in 1940. The minimum age was raised to five in 1961, when a new hurdle race, the Grande Course de Haies des 4 Ans (later titled the Prix Alain du Breil), was introduced specifically for four-year-olds. The distance of the Grande Course de Haies was extended to 5,100 metres in 1969. This was cut to 4,100 metres in 1975, and then restored to 5,100 metres in 1979. Four horses have won both this event and the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris. These are Blagueur II, Loreto, Ubu III and Mid Dancer. The 1947 winner of the Grande Course de Haies, Le Paillon, later won the most prestigious flat race in France, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The 1984 winner, Dawn Run (a mare trained in Ireland), also won both the Champion Hurdle and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in England. She returned to Auteuil to attempt a repeat victory in 1986, but during the race she misjudged a hurdle, fell, and died almost instantly. In 2010, the race was won by flat jockey Christophe Soumillon. ==Records== Leading jockey (4 wins): * John Boon – Vertige (1894), Charlatan (1895), Grandlieu (1898), Kerym (1899) \\\\---- Leading trainer (8 wins): * William Head – Evohe II (1937, 1938), Royal Kidney (1939), Ludovic le More (1943), Vatelys (1946), Le Paillon (1947), Septieme Ciel (1948), Friendship (1959) \\\\---- Leading owner (6 wins): * Daniel Wildenstein – Gopal (1969), Top Gear (1977), Paiute (1979, 1980), World Citizen (1982), Vaporetto (1999) ==Winners since 1970== { class = \\"sortable\\"  border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#77dd77\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"36px\\"  Year ! width=\\"130px\\"  Winner !

The Accidental Connoisseur: An Irreverent Journey Through the Wine World and the white varieties Chenin blanc Grenache blanc, Roussanne, Viognier, Muscat and Gros Manseng, the domaine has been described by La Revue du vin de France as, 'One of the most classic ambassadors of its appellation.' 2\\\\. Le Meilleurs Vin de France 2009 Guide de la Revue du Vin de France édition 2009 (14 Aug 2008) ==History== The history of the Domaine is perhaps one of the most richly resonant of the Hérault, its story so closely interwoven with that of the region in general. This story has been perhaps best set down by Neal Rosenthal, renowned American importer of wines and author of Reflections of a Wine Merchant:3\\\\. Reflections of a Wine Merchant by Neal Rosenthal (Author) Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 1st edition (April 29, 2008) > 'In 1970, when there was a great exodus from the Languedoc due to a loss of > faith in its vineyards to provide a sufficient living, Jean-Pierre Jullien > named his domaine \\"Cal Demoura\\", which in Occitan means \\"one must remain\\". > He came from a long line of vignerons and, at that time, he followed most of > his colleagues as they closed their caves and attempted to survive by > participating in the local cooperative. Jean-Pierre's son, Olivier, refused > to follow the path of the cooperative and established his own domaine, the > \\"Mas Jullien\\", in 1985.

In 2004, Jean-Pierre retired, and the responsibility of the domaine was taking up by Isabelle and Vincent Goumard in his place. Impressed by the estate's winemaking philosophy and the potential of its terroir, the couple worked side by side with Jean-Pierre in the vineyard and in the cellar, before continuing its legacy. As an example, the vintage 2003 was handled by both Jean-Pierre and Vincent. Vincent Goumard also found support in Jean-Pierre's son, Olivier Jullien. The Gourmards have handled the delicate task of guiding Mas Cal Demoura forward while retaining its unique qualities well, with Decanter Magazine reporting in 2005, ‘Talented young winemaker, Vincent Gourmard looks set to carry the domaine's reputation for excellence in the future.’6\\\\. Decanter magazine Sept 2005 Natasha Hugues and La Revue du vin de France in 2008, \\"Isabelle and Vincent Goumard have succeeded in their conversion of Cal Demoura. The future is bright for these meticulous young winemakers, able to benefit from past experience.\\"7\\\\. Revue de Vin de France 2008 The style of the wines have slowly evolved to gain more complexity and more delicate structure. The 2007 and the 2008 vintage are clearly among the best produced by Mas Cal Demoura. ==Vineyard== The vineyard area extends to 11 ha. with vines planted on stony limestone and calcareous clay (red and white) soils. Vines average around 25 years of age. The vineyards benefit from cooling northern winds from the Causse du Larzac over the ripening period during summer nights contributing greater freshness to the wines, as well as sea influence brought by southern winds, said to limit the effects of drought. ==Production== The domaine produces 40 000 bottles a year. Two white wines are nowadays available: * L'Etincelle (first release in 2004) * Paroles de Pierres (first release in 2008) and three red wines: * L'Infidèle (the historical cuvée) * Les Combarioles (a parcellar selection, since 2004) * Feu Sacré (a cuvée of very old Grenache vines, only produced in the best years.

He was previously a stalwart with former ECHL club, the Stockton Thunder. He is best known for his agitating playing style. ==Playing career== Hunt began his junior career with the Chilliwack Chiefs of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). In 2004–05, he joined the Vancouver Giants of the major junior Western Hockey League (WHL). He would go on to play four seasons with the Giants and establish himself as an effective agitator, while helping the club to the 2006 President's Cup championship as WHL champions and the 2007 Memorial Cup championship as Canadian major junior champions (although Hunt missed the entirety of the 2007 playoffs due to a broken leg). In his final year of junior in 2007–08, he recorded WHL career- highs with 18 points and 239 penalty minutes in addition to a league-high 27 fighting majors. Undrafted at the end of his junior career, Hunt signed a minor league contract with the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League (AHL). Hunt was then assigned to the Stockton Thunder of the ECHL for his professional rookie season in 2008–09. During his rookie season with the Thunder, Hunt played 69 games and contributed 16 points (5 goals and 11 assists). He also finished second in the ECHL with 248 penalty minutes. After remaining in Stockton upon the Thunder relocating to Adirondack, Hunt earned a try-out contract to attend the newly installed AHL franchise, the Stockton Heat training camp. Upon his release from the Heat, Hunt signed for just his second ECHL club, in the Alaska Aces on November 4, 2015. Hunt's number was later retired by the Stockton Thunder and upon leaving the ECHL after 11 seasons, he was the most penalized player in history with 2666 PIM in 702 games. On July 4, 2019, Hunt was signed by Chinese club, HC Kunlun Red Star of the KHL, to a two-year contract.

In the 1930s, he completed the editing of the standard edition of the diaries of Charles Greville. From the 1930s to the 1960s, he wrote several important biographies and other works. Between 1964 and 1981 he edited five volumes of letters between Queen Victoria and the Princess Royal. He was President of the Liberal Party from 1964 to 1965. ==Life and career== Fulford was the younger son of Canon Frederick John Fulford, vicar of Flaxley, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Emily Constance née Ellis.Hart-Davis, Rupert, \\"Fulford, Sir Roger Thomas Baldwin (1902–1983)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 22 November 2008] Fulford was educated at Lancing College and Worcester College, Oxford University. In 1932, he qualified as a barrister, but never practised law. From 1933, Fulford was a journalist with The Times, where he remained for many years.The Times obituary, 19 May 1983, p. 14 From 1937 to 1948, he was a part- time lecturer in English at King's College London.\\"Fulford, Sir Roger (Thomas Baldwin)\\", Who Was Who, 1920–2007, A & C Black, London; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 23 November 2008 From 1941 to 1942, Fulford worked in MI5.Chapman Pincher, Treachery, Random House, New York From 1942 to 1945, he was assistant private secretary to Sir Archibald Sinclair, the Secretary of State for Air. He stood as a Liberal Party candidate in three general elections: in 1929, he came second at Woodbridge; in 1945, he came third at Holderness; and, in 1950, he came third at Rochdale. In 1964–65, he was party president. For Penguin Books he wrote The Liberal Case for the general election of 1959, published alongside the contributions of Lord Hailsham and Roy Jenkins for the other two national parties. The Times called Fulford's piece \\"a highly civilised credo\\". In 1970, he was appointed C.V.O. and he was knighted in 1980. In 1937 Fulford married Sibell Eleanor Maud née Adeane, widow of the Hon. Edward James Kay-Shuttleworth (d. 1917) and of the Rev. Hon. Charles Frederick Lyttelton (d. 1931). There were no children. Fulford was a member of The Literary Society and a committee member of the London Library.Hart-Davis, letters of 29 May and 15 September 1957 Fulford died at his home, Barbon Manor, near Carnforth, aged 80. ==Writings== Away from journalism, Fulford's first major literary work was as editor of the diaries of Charles Greville, in succession to Lytton Strachey, who died in 1932 leaving the work unfinished. The memoirs were eventually published in ten volumes, beginning in 1938. Fulford's subsequent works concentrated on the same late Hanoverian period, beginning with a study of the lives of the six younger sons of George III (Royal Dukes, 1933) and their elder brother (George the Fourth, 1935), the Prince Consort (1949) and Queen Victoria (1951), followed by a study of a longer period in Hanover to Windsor (1960).

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Sathyamurthi Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Ujeevana Thayar. The temple is believed to have been built during the 9th century by the Pandyas. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower and is behind a fort built during the 15th century. The temple tank is located inside the premises. The temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the car festival during the Tamil month of Vaikaasi (April - May), Krishna Jayanti during Aaavani (August - September) and Aadi Pooram during July - August being the most prominent. ==History== Historians believe that the temple was built during the 9th century by the Pandyas. M.A. Dhaky places the period to be the 7th decade of 9th century. He has also compared the images of the temple to that of Vijayalaya Choleeswaram in Narthamalai, built by Muttaraiyar kings during the same period. ==Architecture== The Temple tank of Thirumayam temple The presiding deity is called Sathyamurthi Perumal. The temple is old and large, and striking in appearance. The main statue of 'Sathyamurthi Perumal approximately seven feet in height, is standing on a rock, along with his wives. In the next Sannidhanam (sanctum), Mahavishnu's sculpture is in sleeping position, the position which is called in Tamil Ari thuyil, sleeping with a sense of knowing what is going on at present. Sculptures of Mahavishnu in this position can be viewed in many temples, although this is one of the largest examples. There are many other sannidhis in the temple.

The fort played an important role in the history of Thondaiman rulers of Pudukottai and the British. The 40 acre fort was built by Vijaya Ragunatha Sethupathi of Ramanathapuram in 1687 AD. On the hill, there is a rock-cut Shiva temple with inscriptions on music. There are relics of another fort. At the foot of the hill are the Shiva and Vishnu temples.

Traditional Tibetan history described the exploits of a lengthy list of rulers. External corroboration is available from the 7th century in Chinese histories. From the 7th to the 9th century a series of emperors ruled Tibet. From the time of the emperor Songtsen Gampo the power of the empire gradually increased over a diverse terrain. By the reign of the emperor Ralpacan, in the opening years of the 9th century, it controlled territories extending from the Tarim basin to the Himalayas and Bengal, and from the Pamirs to what are now the Chinese provinces of Gansu and Yunnan. The varied terrain of the empire and the difficulty of transportation, coupled with the new ideas that came into the empire as a result of its expansion, helped to create stresses and power blocs that were often in competition with the ruler at the center of the empire. Thus, for example, adherents of the Bön religion and the supporters of the ancient noble families gradually came to find themselves in competition with the recently introduced Buddhism. The empire collapsed into civil war in the 840s. == History Namri Songtsen and founding of the dynasty=== The power that became the Tibetan state originated at the Taktsé Castle () in the Chingba (Phying-ba) district of Chonggyä (Phyongs-rgyas). There, according to the Old Tibetan Chronicle, a group convinced Tagbu Nyazig (Stag-bu snya-gzigs) to rebel against Gudri Zingpoje (Dgu-gri Zing-po-rje), who was, in turn, a vassal of the Zhangzhung empire under the Lig myi dynasty. The group prevailed against Zingpoje. At this point Namri Songtsen (also known as Namri Löntsän) was the leader of a clan which one by one prevailed over all his neighboring clans. He gained control of all the area around what is now Lhasa, before his assassination around 618. This new-born regional state would later become known as the Tibetan Empire. The government of Namri Songtsen sent two embassies to the Chinese Sui Dynasty in 608 and 609, marking the appearance of Tibet on the international scene.Beckwith 1987, pg. 17. The historic name for the Tibetan Empire is different from Tibet's present name. :\\"This first mention of the name Bod, the usual name for Tibet in the later Tibetan historical sources, is significant in that it is used to refer to a conquered region. In other words, the ancient name Bod originally referred only to a part of the Tibetan Plateau, a part which, together with Rtsaṅ (Tsang, in Tibetan now spelled Gtsaṅ) has come to be called Dbus-gtsaṅ (Central Tibet).\\"Beckwith 1987, p. 16. ===Reign of Songtsen Gampo (618–650)=== Songtsen Gampo (Srong-brtsan Sgam-po) (c. 604 – 650) was the first great emperor who expanded Tibet's power beyond Lhasa and the Yarlung Valley, and is traditionally credited with introducing Buddhism to Tibet. A statue of Emperor Songtsen Gampo in a cave at Yerpa When his father Namri Songtsen died by poisoning (circa 618Beckwith 1987, pp. 19–20), Songtsen Gampo took control after putting down a brief rebellion. Songtsen Gampo proved adept at diplomacy as well as combat. The emperor's minister, Myang Mangpoje (Myang Mang-po-rje Zhang-shang), defeated the Sumpa people ca. 627.Old Tibetan Annals, hereafter OTA l. 2 Six years later (c. 632–33) Myang Mangpoje was accused of treason and executed.OTA l. 4-5Richardson, Hugh E. (1965). \\"How Old was Srong Brtsan Sgampo\\", Bulletin of Tibetology 2.1. pp. 5–8.OTA l. 8-10 He was succeeded by minister Gar Songtsen (mgar-srong-rtsan). The Chinese records mention an envoy to Tibet in 634. On that occasion, the Tibetan Emperor requested (demanded according to Tibetan sources) marriage to a Chinese princess but was refused. In 635-36 the Emperor attacked and defeated the Tuyuhun (Tibetan: ‘A zha), who lived around Lake Koko Nur and controlled important trade routes into China. After a series of military campaigns between Tibet and the Tang dynasty in 635-8,OTA l. 607（see also Tibetan attack on Songzhou） the Chinese emperor agreed (only because of the threat of force, according to Tibetan sourcesPowers 2004, pp. 168–69) to provide a Chinese princess to Songtsen Gampo. Circa 639, after Songtsen Gampo had a dispute with his younger brother Tsänsong (Brtsan-srong), the younger brother was burned to death by his own minister Khäsreg (Mkha’s sregs) (presumably at the behest of his older brother the emperor). The Chinese Princess Wencheng (Tibetan: Mung-chang Kung-co) departed China in 640 to marry Songtsen Gampo's son. She arrived a year later. This is traditionally credited with being the first time that Buddhism came to Tibet, but it is very unlikely Buddhism extended beyond foreigners at the court. Songtsen Gampo’s sister Sämakar (Sad-mar-kar) was sent to marry Lig-myi-rhya, the king of Zhangzhung in what is now Western Tibet. However, when the king refused to consummate the marriage, she then helped her brother to defeat Lig myi-rhya and incorporate Zhangzhung into the Tibetan Empire. In 645, Songtsen Gampo overran the kingdom of Zhangzhung. Songtsen Gampo died in 650. He was succeeded by his infant grandson Trimang Lön (Khri-mang-slon). Real power was left in the hands of the minister Gar Songtsen. There is some confusion as to whether Central Tibet conquered Zhangzhung during the reign of Songtsen Gampo or in the reign of Trisong Detsen, (r. 755 until 797 or 804).Karmey, Samten G. (1975). \\"'A General Introduction to the History and Doctrines of Bon\\", p. 180. Memoirs of Research Department of The Toyo Bunko, No, 33. Tokyo. The records of the Tang Annals do, however, seem to clearly place these events in the reign of Songtsen Gampo for they say that in 634, Zhangzhung and various Qiang tribes \\"altogether submitted to him.\\" Following this, he united with the country of Zhangzhung to defeat the Tuyuhun, then conquered two more Qiang tribes before threatening the Chinese region of Songzhou with a very large army (according to Tibetan sources 100,000; according to the Chinese more than 200,000 men).Powers 2004, pg. 168 He then sent an envoy with gifts of gold and silk to the Chinese emperor to ask for a Chinese princess in marriage and, when refused, attacked Songzhou. According to the Tang Annals, he finally retreated and apologized, after which the emperor granted his request.Lee 1981, pp. 7–9Pelliot 1961, pp. 3–4 After the death of Songtsen Gampo in 650 AD, the Chinese Tang dynasty attacked and took control of the Tibetan capital Lhasa. Soldiers of the Tang dynasty could not sustain their presence in the hostile environment of the Tibetan Plateau and soon returned to China proper.\\" ===Reign of Mangsong Mangtsen (650–676)=== Map of the Four Horns (administrative divisions) of the Tibetan Empire in the 7th century. After having incorporated Tuyuhun into Tibetan territory, the powerful minister Gar Songtsen died in 667. Between 665–670 Khotan was defeated by the Tibetans, and a long string of conflicts ensued with the Chinese Tang Dynasty. In the spring of 670, Tibet attacked the remaining Chinese territories in the western Tarim Basin after winning the Battle of Dafeichuan against the Tang dynasty. With troops from Khotan they conquered Aksu, upon which the Chinese abandoned the region, ending two decades of Chinese control.Beckwith, Christopher I. The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia. (1987), pp. 34–-36. Princeton University Press. . They thus gained control over all of the Chinese Four Garrisons of Anxi in the Tarim Basin in 670 and held them until 692, when the Chinese finally managed to regain these territories.Beckwith, 36, 146. Emperor Mangsong Mangtsen (Trimang Löntsen' or Khri-mang-slon-rtsan) married Thrimalö (Khri-ma-lod), a woman who would be of great importance in Tibetan history. The emperor died in the winter of 676–677, and Zhangzhung revolts occurred thereafter. In the same year the emperor's son Tridu Songtsen (Khri 'dus-srong btsan or Khri-'dus-srong-rtsan) was born.Beckwith 1987, pp. 14, 48, 50. ===Reign of Tridu Songtsen (677–704)=== Tibet's Empire in 700 AD The power of Emperor Tridu Songtsen was offset, to an extent, by that of his mother, Thrimalö and the influence of the Gar clan. (Wylie mgar; also sgar and ′gar). (There is evidence that the Gar were descended from members of the Lesser Yuezhi, a people who had originally spoken an Indo-European language and migrated, sometime after the 3rd century BC, from Gansu or the Tarim into Kokonur.) In 685, minister Gar Tsenye Dompu (mgar Bstan-snyas-ldom-bu) died and his brother, Gar Tridring Tsendrö (mgar Khri-‘bring-btsan brod) was appointed to replace him.Beckwith 1987, pg. 50 In 692, the Tibetans lost the Tarim Basin to the Chinese. Gar Tridring Tsendrö defeated the Chinese in battle in 696 and sued for peace. Two years later in 698 emperor Tridu Songtsen reportedly invited the Gar clan (who numbered more than 2000 people) to a hunting party and had them massacred. Gar Tridring Tsendrö then committed suicide, and his troops joined the Chinese. This brought to an end the influence of the Gar.Beckwith 1987, pp. 14, 48, 50 From 700 until his death the emperor remained on campaign in the northeast, absent from Central Tibet, while his mother Thrimalö administrated in his name.Petech, Luciano (1988). \\"The Succession to the Tibetan Throne in 704-5.\\" Orientalia Iosephi Tucci Memoriae Dicata, Serie Orientale Roma 41.3. pp. 1080–87. In 702, Zhou China under Empress Wu Zetien and the Tibetan Empire concluded peace. At the end of that year, the Tibetan imperial government turned to consolidating the administrative organization khö chenpo (mkhos chen-po) of the northeastern Sumru area, which had been the Sumpa country conquered 75 years earlier. Sumru was organized as a new \\"horn\\" of the empire. During the summer of 703, Tridu Songtsen resided at Öljak (‘Ol-byag) in Ling (Gling), which was on the upper reaches of the Yangtze, before proceeding with an invasion of Jang (‘Jang), which may have been either the Mosuo or the kingdom of Nanzhao. In 704, he stayed briefly at Yoti Chuzang (Yo-ti Chu-bzangs) in Madrom (Rma-sgrom) on the Yellow River. He then invaded Mywa, which was at least in part Nanzhao (the Tibetan term mywa likely referring to the same people or peoples referred to by the Chinese as Man or Miao)Backus (1981) pp. 43–44Beckwith, C. I. \\"The Revolt of 755 in Tibet\\", p. 5 note 10. In: Weiner Studien zur Tibetologie und Buddhismuskunde. Nos. 10-11. [Ernst Steinkellner and Helmut Tauscher, eds. Proceedings of the Csoma de Kőrös Symposium Held at Velm-Vienna, Austria, 13–19 September 1981. Vols. 1-2.] Vienna, 1983.Beckwith (1987) pp. 64–65 but died during the prosecution of that campaign. ===Reign of Tride Tsuktsän (704–754)=== First dissemination Gyeltsugru (Rgyal-gtsug-ru), later to become King Tride Tsuktsen (Khri-lde-gtsug-brtsan), generally known now by his nickname Me Agtsom (\\"Old Hairy\\"), was born in 704. Upon the death of Tridu Songtsen, his mother Thrimalö ruled as regent for the infant Gyältsugru. The following year the elder son of Tridu Songtsen, Lha Balpo (Lha Bal-pho) apparently contested the succession of his one-year-old brother, but was \\"deposed from the throne\\" at Pong Lag-rang.Beckwith, C. I. \\"The Revolt of 755 in Tibet\\", pp. 1–14. In: Weiner Studien zur Tibetologie und Buddhismuskunde. Nos. 10-11. [Ernst Steinkellner and Helmut Tauscher, eds. Proceedings of the Csoma de Kőrös Symposium Held at Velm-Vienna, Austria, 13–19 September 1981. Vols. 1-2.] Vienna, 1983. Thrimalö had arranged for a royal marriage to a Chinese princess. The Princess Jincheng (Tibetan: Kyimshang Kongjo) arrived in 710, but it is somewhat unclear whether she married the seven-year-old GyeltsugruYamaguchi 1996: 232 or the deposed Lha Balpo.Beckwith 1983: 276. Gyeltsugru also married a lady from Jang (Nanzhao) and another born in Nanam.Stein 1972, pp. 62–63 Gyältsugru was officially enthroned with the royal name Tride Tsuktsän in 712, the year that dowager empress Thrimalö died. The Umayyad Caliphate and Turgesh became increasingly prominent during 710–720. The Tibetans were allied with the Türgesh. Tibet and China fought on and off in the late 720s. At first Tibet (with Türgesh allies) had the upper hand, but then they started losing battles. After a rebellion in southern China and a major Tibetan victory in 730, the Tibetans and Türgesh sued for peace. The Tibetans aided the Turgesh in fighting against the Muslim Arabs during the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. In 734 the Tibetans married their princess Dronmalön (‘Dron ma lon) to the Türgesh Qaghan. The Chinese allied with the Caliphate to attack the Türgesh. After victory and peace with the Türgesh, the Chinese attacked the Tibetan army. The Tibetans suffered several defeats in the east, despite strength in the west. The Türgesh empire collapsed from internal strife. In 737, the Tibetans launched an attack against the king of Bru-za (Gilgit), who asked for Chinese help, but was ultimately forced to pay homage to Tibet. In 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir. By 750 the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. In 753, even the kingdom of \\"Little Balur\\" (modern Gilgit) was captured by the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Caliphate and Karluks at the Battle of Talas (751), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence began to increase again. Tibet conquered large sections of northern India during this time. In 755 Tride Tsuktsen was killed by the ministers Lang and ‘Bal. Then Takdra Lukong (Stag-sgra Klu-khong) presented evidence to prince Song Detsen (Srong- lde-brtsan) that they were disloyal and causing dissension in the country, and were about to injure him also. Subsequently, Lang and ‘Bal really did revolt. They were killed by the army and their property was confiscated.\\"Beckwith 1983: 273 ===Reign of Trisong Detsen (756–797 or 804)=== Map of Tibetan Empire at its greatest extent in 790 In 756 prince Song Detsän was crowned Emperor with the name Trisong Detsen (Khri srong lde brtsan) and took control of the government when he attained his majorityStein 1972, p. 66 at 13 years of age (14 by Western reckoning) after a one-year interregnum during which there was no emperor. In 755 China had already begun to be weakened because of the An Shi Rebellion started by An Lushan in 751, which would last until 763. In contrast, Trisong Detsän's reign was characterized by the reassertion of Tibetan influence in Central Asia. Early in his reign regions to the West of Tibet paid homage to the Tibetan court. From that time onward the Tibetans pressed into the territory of the Tang emperors, reaching the Chinese capital Chang'an (modern Xian) in late 763.Beckwith 1987, pg. 146 Tibetan troops occupied Chang'an for fifteen days and installed a puppet emperor while Emperor Daizong was in Luoyang. Nanzhao (in Yunnan and neighbouring regions) remained under Tibetan control from 750 to 794, when they turned on their Tibetan overlords and helped the Chinese inflict a serious defeat on the Tibetans.Marks, Thomas A. (1978). \\"Nanchao and Tibet in South-western China and Central Asia.\\" The Tibet Journal. Vol. 3, No. 4. Winter 1978, pp. 13–16. In 785, Wei Kao, a Chinese serving as an official in Shuh, repulsed Tibetan invasions of the area. In the meantime, the Kyrgyz negotiated an agreement of friendship with Tibet and other powers to allow free trade in the region. An attempt at a peace treaty between Tibet and China was made in 787, but hostilities were to last until the Sino-Tibetan treaty of 821 was inscribed in Lhasa in 823 (see below). At the same time, the Uyghurs, nominal allies of the Tang emperors, continued to make difficulties along Tibet's Northern border. Toward the end of this king's reign Uyghur victories in the North caused the Tibetans to lose a number of their allies in the Southeast.Beckwith 1987, pp. 144–157 Recent historical research indicates the presence of Christianity in as early as the sixth and seventh centuries, a period when the Hephthalites had extensive links with the Tibetans.Palmer, Martin, The Jesus Sutras, Mackays Limited, Chatham, Kent, Great Britain, 2001) A strong presence existed by the eighth century when Patriarch Timothy I (727-823) in 782 calls the Tibetans one of the more significant communities of the eastern church and wrote of the need to appoint another bishop in ca. 794.Hunter, Erica, \\"The Church of the East in Central Asia,\\" Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester, 78, no.3 (1996) There is a stone pillar (now blocked off from the public), the Lhasa Shöl rdo-rings, Doring Chima or Lhasa Zhol Pillar, in the ancient village of Shöl in front of the Potala in Lhasa, dating to c. 764 CE during Trisong Detsen's reign. It also contains an account of the conquest of large swathes of northwestern China including the capture of Chang'an, the Chinese capital, for a short period in 763 CE, during the reign of Emperor Daizong.Stein 1972, p. 65A Corpus of Early Tibetan Inscriptions. H. E. Richardson. Royal Asiatic Society (1985), pp. 1–25. . ===Reign of Muné Tsenpo (c. 797–799?)=== Trisong Detsen is said to have had four sons. The eldest, Mutri Tsenpo, apparently died young. When Trisong Detsen retired he handed power to the eldest surviving son, Muné Tsenpo (Mu-ne btsan-po).Stein, R. A. (1972) Tibetan Civilization, p. 101. Stanford University Press. (cloth); (pbk) Most sources say that Muné's reign lasted only about a year and a half. After a short reign, Muné Tsenpo was supposedly poisoned on the orders of his mother. After his death, Mutik Tsenpo was next in line to the throne. However, he had been apparently banished to Lhodak Kharchu (lHo-brag or Lhodrag) near the Bhutanese border for murdering a senior minister.Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. Tibet: A Political History (1967), p. 47. Yale University Press, New Haven and London. The youngest brother, Tride Songtsen, was definitely ruling by AD 804.Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. Tibet: A Political History (1967), p. 48. Yale University Press, New Haven and London.Richardson, Hugh. A Corpus of Early Tibetan Inscriptions (1981), p. 44. Royal Asiatic Society, London. . ===Reign of Tride Songtsen (799–815)=== Under Tride Songtsen (Khri lde srong brtsan - generally known as Sadnalegs), there was a protracted war with the Abbasid Caliphate. It appears that Tibetans captured a number of Caliphate troops and pressed them into service on the eastern frontier in 801. Tibetans were active as far west as Samarkand and Kabul. Abbasid forces began to gain the upper hand, and the Tibetan governor of Kabul submitted to the Caliphate and became a Muslim about 812 or 815. The Caliphate then struck east from Kashmir but were held off by the Tibetans. In the meantime, the Uyghur Khaganate attacked Tibet from the northeast. Strife between the Uyghurs and Tibetans continued for some time.Beckwith 1987, pp. 157-165 ===Reign of Tritsu Detsen (815–838)=== The bilingual text of peace treaty inscribed on the Tang-Tibetan alliance stele, Jokhang temple. Tritsu Detsen (Khri gtsug lde brtsan), best known as Ralpacan, is important to Tibetan Buddhists as one of the three Dharma Kings who brought Buddhism to Tibet. He was a generous supporter of Buddhism and invited many craftsmen, scholars and translators from neighbouring countries. He also promoted the development of written Tibetan and translations, which were greatly aided by the development of a detailed Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicon called the Mahavyutpatti which included standard Tibetan equivalents for thousands of Sanskrit terms.Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. (1967). Tibet: A Political History, pp. 49-50. Yale University Press, New Haven & London.Ancient Tibet: Research Materials from the Yeshe De Project (1986), pp. 296–97. Dharma Publishing, California. . Tibetans attacked Uyghur territory in 816 and were in turn attacked in 821. After successful Tibetan raids into Chinese territory, Buddhists in both countries sought mediation. Ralpacan was apparently murdered by two pro-Bön ministers who then placed his anti-Buddhist brother, Langdarma, on the throne.Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. (1967). Tibet: A Political History, p. 51. Yale University Press, New Haven & London. Tibet continued to be a major Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century. It was under the reign of Ralpacan that the political power of Tibet was at its greatest extent, stretching as far as Mongolia and Bengal, and entering into treaties with China on a mutual basis. A Sino-Tibetan treaty was agreed on in 821/822 under Ralpacan, which established peace for more than two decades.Beckwith 1987, pp. 165–67 A bilingual account of this treaty is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa. ===Reign of Langdarma (838–842)=== Tibetan Empire in 820 AD The reign of Langdarma (Glang dar ma), regal title Tri Uidumtsaen (Khri 'U'i dum brtsan), was plagued by external troubles. The Uyghur state to the north collapsed under pressure from the Kyrgyz in 840, and many displaced people fled to Tibet. Langdarma himself was assassinated, apparently by a Buddhist hermit, in 842.Beckwith 1987, pp. 168–69Shakabpa, p. 54. ===Decline=== Era of Fragmentation in the post-empire period Mural commemorating victory of Zhang Yichao over the Tibetan Empire in 848. Mogao cave 156 A civil war that arose over Langdarma's successor led to the collapse of the Tibetan Empire. The period that followed, known traditionally as the Era of Fragmentation, was dominated by rebellions against the remnants of imperial Tibet and the rise of regional warlords.Schaik, Galambos. p.4. ==MilitaryArmor=== The soldiers of the Tibetan Empire wore chainmail armor and were proficient in the use of swords and lances, but were poor in archery. According to Du You (735-812) in his encyclopedic text, the Tongdian, the Tibetans fought in the following manner: The Tibetans might have exported their armor to the neighboring steppe nomads. When the Turgesh attacked the Arabs, their khagan Suluk was reported to have worn Tibetan armor, which saved him from two arrows before a third penetrated his breast. He survived the ordeal with some discomfort in one arm. ===Organization=== The Tibetan Empire's officers were not employed full-time and were only called upon on an ad hoc basis. These warriors were designated by a golden arrow seven inches long which signified their office. The officers gathered once a year to swear an oath of fealty. They assembled every three years to partake in a sacrificial feast. While on campaign, Tibetan armies carried no provision of grain and lived on plunder. ==Society== The early Tibetans worshipped a god of war known as \\"Yuandi\\" (Chinese transcription) according to a Chinese transliteration from the Old Book of Tang.

A Civic Reform Association member, Bartley was attacked by a member of the Communist Party of Australia over a proposal to demolish \\"Maramonah\\", a mansion in central Sydney, inhabited by 600 squatters, in order to build a park. Bartley's plan was eventually taken up, and the site of the mansion is the Fitzroy Gardens in King's Cross. Bartley later said that he regretted the incident had become one between \\"communists and lawful authority\\". In March 1946 Bartley was instrumental in moving to demolish the Sydney Mint and the Hyde Park Barracks, stating that they should \\"make way for modern structures\\". Bartley's service to the City of Sydney is commemorated by the naming of Reg Bartley Oval at Rushcutters Bay and Bartley Street, Chippendale.

It is a six-by-one-bay, -story stucco structure with a gable roof covered with asphalt shingles. It is a well-preserved and detailed example of the vernacular dwellings of the early 19th century in Howard County and associated with the Dorsey family, one of the \\"first families\\" of the county. Dorsey Hall was built on Dorsey's Search, a parcel of land patented by Hon. John Dorsey of Hockley-in-the-hole (1645–1714) in Baltimore County (now Howard County), the brother of Edward Dorsey. The property adjacent to the north branch of the Patuxent River was surveyed by Richard Beard in December 1684, and granted to Dorsey in March 1696. The surrounding residential neighborhood of Dorsey's Search was named after the original land grant. The farm operated with slave labor until the death of Caleb Dorsey in 1864. In 1963, owner Julius Mandel and Gudelsky Company attempted to rezone the site for high-rise apartments. The property was retitled to the Gudelsky-owned Contee Sand and Gravel Company. The 685-acre property was then purchased by The Rouse Company's shell corporation Columbia Industrial Development Corp. for redevelopment, which was halted in 1968 by residential opposition. The building underwent a renovation in 1979. The stone gristmill remains were still visible onsite at the time. The of land surrounding Dorsey Hall that was acquired by The Rouse Company was resold to land developers Richard Talkin and Donald Reuwer for $785,000 in 2000. In July 2000, a $3.5 million, 32,000 square-foot office project broke ground. By 2001, the site of the estate was subdivided and reduced to 2 acres with a survey claiming no outbuildings were present unlike the neighboring Woodlawn Estate from the same period. Dorsey Hall now stands at the entrance to a business park (comprising mostly medical offices) at 5100 Dorsey Hall Drive, the architecture of which is compatible with the building. However, although it forms an imposing image, it has no signage or other identification and is not open to the public. The confusion is amplified by the adjacent business park at 5010 Dorsey Hall Drive, which bears a sign naming itself the \\"Dorsey Hall Business Park.\\" Just north of Maryland Route 108, Dorsey Hall is technically at the southern edge of unincorporated Ellicott City, Maryland, rather than the northern edge of Columbia. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. ==See also== *List of Howard County properties in the Maryland Historical Trust *Bethesda ==References *, including photo from 1980, at Maryland Historical Trust Category:Buildings and structures in Columbia, Maryland Category:Houses completed in 1798 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Georgian architecture in Maryland Category:Howard County, Maryland landmarks Category:Houses in Howard County, Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Howard County, Maryland ","title":"Dorsey Hall"},{"id":"20355828","text":"The cat gap is a period in the fossil record of approximately 25 to 18.5 million years ago in which there are few fossils of cats or cat-like species found in North America. The cause of the \\"cat gap\\" is disputed, but may have been caused by changes in the climate (global cooling), changes in the habitat and environmental ecosystem, the increasingly hypercarnivorous trend of the cats (especially the nimravids), volcanic activity, evolutionary changes in dental morphology of the Canidae species present in North America, or a periodicity of extinctions called van der Hammen cycles. ==Cat evolution== Feliform evolutionary timeline All modern carnivorans, including cats, evolved from miacoids, which existed from approximately 66 to 33 million years ago. There were other earlier cat-like species but Proailurus (meaning \\"before the cat\\"; also called \\"Leman's Dawn Cat\\"), which appeared about 30 million years ago, is generally considered the first \\"true cat\\". The increase in disparity through the early Miocene occurs during a time when few feliform fossils have been found in North America. The hypercarnivorous nimravid feliforms were extinct in North America after 26 Ma and felids did not arrive in North America until the Middle Miocene with the appearance of Pseudaelurus. Pseudaelurus crossed over to North America by way of the Bering land bridge from surviving populations in Asia 18.5 million years ago. All modern-day cats are descended from Pseudaelurus. Nimravids and barbourofelids were saber- toothed cat-like animals of the families Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae, respectively. Although not \\"true cats\\" of the family Felidae, they are closely related to felids. The Nimravidae are either basal feliforms or a sister group to both feliforms and caniforms, while the Barbourofelidae are a sister group to the Felidae. Physically, some Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae resembled the saber-toothed cat Smilodon, which would not appear until many millions of years later. Nimravidae also became extinct in North America during the \\"cat gap\\". ==Possible causesHypercarnivorous tendency=== The history of carnivorous mammals is characterized by a series of rise-and-fall patterns of diversification, in which declining clades are replaced by phylogenetically distinct but functionally similar clades. Over the past 50 million years, successive clades of small and large carnivorous mammals diversified and then declined to extinction. In most instances, the cause of the decline was energetic constraints and pervasive selection for larger size (Cope's rule) that lead to hypercarnivory dietary specialization. Hypercarnivory leads to increased vulnerability to extinction. The nimravids were large cat-like animals that occupied this ecomorphic niche in the ecosystem until 26 Ma. It is highly likely that their hypercarnivory led to their extinction in North America. After the extinction of the nimravids there were no other feliform or felid-like species until other felids arrived from Eurasia after crossing the Bering land bridge 18.5 million years ago. During this time there was great diversity among the other carnivorous mammals in North America – both hypocarnivorous and hypercarnivorous species – and other hypercarnivorous species existed before, during, and after the cat gap. ===Changes in climate and habitat=== Many cats tend to be arboreal hunters. The disappearance of forests in North America may have caused the mass extinction. Another possible explanation for the extinction of feliforms in North America is changes in the ecology of the continent. Evidence from the geologic temperature record shows that the earth was experiencing a period of global cooling, causing forests to give way to savannas. Climatic changes to arid conditions that muted variation at about 25.8 Ma coincides with the first appearance of hoglike creodonts and of pocket gophers, and this also is the beginning of the \\"cat gap\\" and the \\"entelodont gap\\", a period of some 7 million years when there were no nimravids, felids, or entelodonts in North America. Faunal overturn at 25.8 Ma is the basis for division of the Arikareean time period (30.5–19 Ma), and the Arikareen NALMA (North American Land-Mammal Ages), into the Monroecreekian period (29.5–25.8 Ma), and then the Harrisonian period (25.8–23.5 Ma). ===Other=== Volcanic activity has also been promoted as a possible cause of the cat gap as well as other extinctions during this time period. The La Garita Caldera is a large volcanic caldera located in the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado, United States, and is one of a number of calderas that formed during a massive ignimbrite flare-up in Colorado, Utah, and Nevada during the Oligocene Epoch. The La Garita Caldera was the site of the Fish Canyon eruption, an enormous eruption about 27 million years ago. The scale of the Fish Canyon eruption was far beyond anything known in human history (erupting more than for a VEI 8+ magnitude), and was possibly the most energetic event on Earth since the Chicxulub impact, which is thought by many paleontologists to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The resulting explosive volcanism probably ejected large amounts of dust and debris into the stratosphere causing major cooling (see volcanic winter). Climatic effects could also have been caused by sulphur ejected into the stratosphere, which rapidly converts to sulphuric acid, an aerosol which cools the troposphere by blocking incoming solar radiation. Another possible cause of the cat gap could have been the Late Cenozoic Ice Age that began 33.9 million years ago. This ice age caused glaciation in Antarctica that eventually spread to Arctic regions of southern Alaska, Greenland, and Iceland. Glaciers on the North American continent, as well as the cooling trend, could have made the ecosystem uninhabitable for feliformia cat-like species, although habitable for cold-weather caniformia species such as canids (dog-like species), mustelids (weasel-like species), and ursids (bear-like species). ==Evolution of caniforms during the gap== Some paleontologists argue that caniforms like Amphicyonidae - \\"bear dogs\\" - responded to the cat gap by evolving to become more cat-like, to fill the hypercarnivore ecological niche It has been suggested by some that as a result of the cat gap caniforms (dog-like species including canids, bears, weasels, and other related taxa) evolved to fill more carnivorous and hypercarnivorous ecological niches that would otherwise have been filled by cats. This conclusion, however, is disputed. However, other paleontologists take issue with this conclusion: ==References== Category:Extinction events Category:Felids Gap Category:Gaps in the fossil record ","title":"Cat gap"},{"id":"20355834","text":"Elmonte, also known as Twilford, is a historic home located at Ellicott City, Howard County, Maryland, United States.

He has previous played for Plymouth Argyle, Yeovil Town, Barnet and Crawley Town. ==Club careerWest Ham United=== N'Gala began his career at West Ham United, joining the club at the age of 13 and progressing through the youth ranks, before signing a professional contract in 2008. N'Gala featured regularly in West Ham's reserve side for several seasons, including captaining the side on a number of occasions. In January 2008, N'Gala was loaned out to Conference National side Weymouth for the remainder of the 2007–08 campaign. He made his debut in Weymouth's 0–0 home draw with Kidderminster Harriers in the FA Trophy, and made two further appearances in defeats against Woking and Rushden & Diamonds. Although N'Gala's loan deal was supposed to run until the end of the season, he returned to West Ham a month into his loan agreement following a change of management at Weymouth. Ahead of the 2008–09 season, N'Gala travelled with the first-team squad on their pre-season tour of the USA. Reserve team manager Alex Dyer stated a desire for the player to go out on loan to a Football League side during the season in order to gain match experience, and he was subsequently loaned out to Milton Keynes Dons in November 2008. During his one-month loan deal, N'Gala made three appearances, making his debut in a 3–0 victory over Walsall on 22 November 2008. He returned to his parent club in December 2008, and spent the rest of the season playing in the club's reserve side. In September 2009, N'Gala made his first-team debut for West Ham, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute in the club's 3–1 League Cup defeat away at Bolton Wanderers. It ultimately turned out to be his only first-team appearance for the club. A month later, he signed for Championship side Scunthorpe United on a one-month loan deal. He made his debut for Scunthorpe in a 4–1 away defeat to Blackpool, with N'Gala coming on as a second-half substitute in the match. N'Gala returned to West Ham at the end of November 2009, having made only two appearances for Scunthorpe. In March 2010, he was loaned out for a fourth time, this time signing for Championship club Plymouth Argyle on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season. He made his debut a week after signing, on 23 March, playing the whole match as a relegation threatened Plymouth secured an important 2–0 away victory over Ipswich Town. He made nine appearances during his loan spell, and was singled out for praise by Plymouth manager Paul Mariner, in a season that witnessed the club suffer relegation back to League One. N'Gala was released by West Ham at the end of the season, with the club opting against renewing his contract. ===Plymouth Argyle=== Following his release by West Ham, N'Gala joined Plymouth Argyle on a permanent basis in May 2010, signing a two-year contract. He played in the club's first game of the 2010–11 season, a 1–0 victory over Southampton at St Mary's. N'Gala received the first red card of his career in Plymouth's 3–2 home win against Sheffield Wednesday on 18 September 2010, being dismissed for bringing down Neil Mellor when through on goal. He scored his first professional goal in March 2011, netting the opening goal of the match with a \\"low drive\\" from just inside the area, in a 4–2 win over Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. He made 28 appearances in all competitions during the campaign, scoring once, as Plymouth struggled with financial difficulties throughout the season — a season in which the PFA provided Plymouth players with \\"financial support\\" due to unpaid wages. Plymouth were deducted ten points by the Football League for an 'insolvency event', which breaks Football League sanctions and commands an automatic ten-point penalty, and the club were ultimately relegated for a second consecutive season. ===Yeovil Town=== Due to Plymouth entering administration, N'Gala was told he was free to leave the club. In July 2011, he subsequently signed for League One side Yeovil Town on a free transfer. He made his Yeovil debut in the club's 2–0 defeat to Brentford on the opening day of the 2011–12 season. N'Gala scored his first goal for the club in October 2011, scoring just before half-time when he headed in Ed Upson's inswinging corner in an eventual 2–2 draw with Leyton Orient. He doubled his goal tally for the campaign the following month, scoring the only goal of the game as Yeovil secured a 1–0 away victory at Hartlepool United. The goal came in similar fashion to his first for the club, with N'Gala heading in an Ed Upson corner. During his one season at Yeovil, N'Gala made 35 appearances in all competitions, scoring twice. ===Stevenage=== In July 2012, N'Gala signed for Stevenage for an undisclosed fee, signing a one-year contract with the club, with the option of another year. Stevenage manager Gary Smith stated he signed N'Gala on recommendation, after assistant manager Mark Newson had worked with the player during his time coaching at West Ham's academy. N'Gala made his debut in the club's first game of the 2012–13 season, playing the whole match in the centre of defence as Stevenage defeated AFC Wimbledon 3–1 in the League Cup. N'Gala playing for Barnet in 2013 Having appeared sporadically for Stevenage during the first half of the season, N'Gala joined Barnet on a one-month loan deal on 15 February 2013, in order to regain his match fitness. He made his debut a day later as an 80th- minute substitute for Chiró N'Toko in a 2–1 away win at York City, but was stretchered off with a head injury just a few minutes later. The injury required \\"a few stitches\\", but he returned to first-team action for Barnet's next game a week later, playing the whole match as Barnet kept a clean sheet in a draw with Rochdale. N'Gala went on to make six appearances during the brief loan spell, before being recalled by Stevenage on 13 March, due to injuries and suspensions within the first-team squad. On his return to his parent club, N'Gala played the whole match in Stevenage's 4–0 home victory over Sheffield United, helping the side keep an important clean sheet. He ended the season playing regularly in central defence, and made 28 appearances for Stevenage during the season. Despite his return to the first-team towards the end of the campaign, Stevenage opted against taking up the option of another year on N'Gala's contract, and he left the club when his contract expired in May 2013. ===Portsmouth=== On 2 August 2013, N'Gala signed a one- month deal with Portsmouth,N'Gala Joins Blues; Portsmouth FC, 2 August 2013 extending this until January on 29 August. He made his debut in a League Cup defeat to Championship side Bournemouth, he scored his first goal in over two years and first goal for Pompey with a header from a Ricky Holmes corner on 5 October 2013, it came against Rochdale, he netted in the 52nd minute and then scored a second again from a Holmes corner just 14 minutes later, the match ended 3–0 to Pompey. He was not offered a new contract and left the club on 4 June 2014. ===Barnet=== N'Gala signed for Barnet on 16 July 2014.Barnet FC on Twitter: \\"The club are delighted to announce that both Charlie MacDonald and Bondz N'Gala have agreed deals to join #BarnetFC for the new season.\\" He played 107 times during this spell with the Bees, scoring two goals. ===Eastleigh=== On 22 November 2016, N'Gala signed for National League side Eastleigh on an 18-month deal, making his debut later that day against Aldershot Town.Bondz N'Gala: Eastleigh sign central defender from League Two club Barnet - BBC Sport Just two months later he left the club by mutual consent. ===Dover Athletic=== On 2 February 2017, N'Gala seemingly signed for League One club Gillingham until the end of the 2016–17 season, however later the same day the deal fell through when the club became aware that regulations regarding the number of clubs for which a player can play in a single season meant that he was not eligible to play for them. A week later, N'Gala signed for Dover Athletic following talks with the FA and the EFL. He signed until the end of the season with an option for a longer deal upon his contract ending. ===Dagenham & Redbridge=== On 6 June 2017, N'Gala joined fellow National League side Dagenham & Redbridge on a two-year deal. On 25 May 2018 it was announced that his contract was mutually terminated and he left the club a year early. ===Crawley Town=== On 31 August 2018, following the departure of first-team manager, Harry Kewell, N'Gala joined Crawley Town on an initial one-month deal.

The small pocket of land to the north of the bight, centred on the area under the Story Bridge's northern point and around the Brisbane River to Customs House is also known as Petrie Bight; it falls within the suburbs of the Brisbane CBD and Fortitude Valley. However, land to the south of the reach Petrie Bight does not use that name, and is known by its suburb name of Kangaroo Point. Today, it is overpassed by the Story Bridge (Bradfield Highway), and underpassed by the Clem7 Tunnel toll road. ==Geography== Open Street Map - Petrie Bight, 2015 Petrie Bight is a sharp curve in the Brisbane River at the northern ends of the Town Reach (upstream) and the Shafston Reach (downstream) around the tip of Kangaroo Point. The name is derived from the association of the area with early Brisbane builder Andrew Petrie, who established his workshop and residence at the corner of Wharf and Queen Streets. ==History== The location was known to the Turrbal people as Mianjin or Meeanjin in the Yaggera language, and this name has more recently been used as the traditional name for Brisbane more generally, as well as its traditional owners and custodians. The location was known to white settlers as Petrie Gardens and was the location of an early settlement farm, one of two that provided food for the colony. The site was named after Andrew Petrie and has been the base for water police and in earlier times wharves. The location of Customs House and the preference for wharves was due to site being directly downstream from the central business district. Surveyor Henry Wade, on his 1844 Map of the Environs of Brisbane Town, identified the Petrie's Bight area south of Boundary Street and east of Queen Street as \\"Reserved for Dry Dock\\". Surveyor Galloway did the same on his 1856 Plan of the Suggested Extension of the Town of Brisbane. At this time the surrounding area was sparsely occupied, with Andrew Petrie's house and factory at the corner of Wharf and Queen Streets; Dr Hobbs' house (now St John's Deanery) a little further north in Adelaide Street; the original Customs House in Queen Street, beside the Brisbane River; and a ferry jetty just north of the Customs Houses. A map of Brisbane Town showing the new town boundaries no longer labelled Petrie's Bight as a reserve for a dry dock (no dry dock was ever established there), but the site remained unsurveyed Government land. An early track (the northern end of Queen Street) ran through this land, branching off in three directions to New Farm, Fortitude Valley and the northwest end of Spring Hollow. Engraving of the Brisbane Gas Company's gasworks, Petrie Bight, circa 1868 Under the provisions of the Brisbane Gas Company Bill 1864 the Queensland Government granted to the Company a site bounded by what are now Ann, Boundary and Macrossan streets and a 160-metre frontage to the Brisbane River, as the site for Brisbane's first gas works. This was the northern half of the Government land at Petrie's Bight. Gas production commenced there in 1865, providing the Brisbane Municipal Council with a regular supply of gas for street lighting. By the early 1870s the demand for gas for domestic consumption was outstripping supply, and in the mid-1870s a second gasometer was constructed on the site. In 1873 the Brisbane Gas Company gained a formal deed of grant to the Petrie's Bight land, an area of 4 acres 17.5 perches (1.66ha), which the Company had purchased from the Government in May 1873 for £4,300. An April 1873 a survey plan titled Survey of Site of Gas Works and Adjacent Crown Land Shewing Road Through Same indicates that by this date the gas works site was fenced along the entire length of its land boundaries, but that through this the government had just surveyed a 20 feet wide road between Macrossan and Boundary streets, which later became an extension of Adelaide Street. Photographs from the 1860s and early 1870s show a tall paling fence around the perimeter of the gas works, prohibiting public access. Early Brisbane resident Victor Drury, writing in The Courier-Mail in 1939, recalled: \\"When Adelaide Street was extended to Boundary Street, there were turnstiles there, and only pedestrians could use the path as a short cut to Queen Street.\\" === River wharfage === Customs House, Brisbane, as seen from Petrie Bight, 2005 In the early 1840s wharfage in Brisbane was concentrated along the South Brisbane Reach of the Brisbane River, but within a decade had extended to the Town Reach further downstream, which soon rivalled South Brisbane in terms of shipping activity. An 1849 decision to locate Brisbane's first purpose-built Customs House at the northern end of the Town Reach acted as the impetus for the development of wharves on this part of the river. The Commissariat Store below William Street, which had served as Brisbane's first customs facility, was replaced in 1850 by a new customs building on the site of the present Customs House in Queen Street, at Petrie's Bight. (This in turn was replaced in 1886-89 by the current building.) During the 1850s and 1860s, a number of shipping companies and private investors constructed wharves and warehouses between the Customs House and Alice Street, near the City Botanic Gardens. Petrie Bight retaining wall, 2014 Construction of a Government wharf (Kennedy Wharf) at Petrie's Bight north of the Customs House commenced in 1875 was completed in 1877 and was leased to private shipping firms. In 1880 the Brisbane Municipal Council acquired the wharf and immediately extended it northward, creating the (now heritage-listed) Petrie Bight retaining wall between the wharf and Queen Street. In 1884 the Council also constructed a wharf at the end of Boundary Street, and in the mid-1880s William Collin established his own wharf at Petrie's Bight, just downstream from the Council's Boundary Street wharf. Purchase of land from the Brisbane Gas Company in 1902 gave the Council control of the river frontage from the Customs House to Boundary Street, and between 1913 and 1916 the Council constructed reinforced concrete wharves between Macrossan and Boundary Streets, and between Kennedy Wharf and the Customs House. The whole of the Council's wharfage at Petrie's Bight was subsequently renamed Circular Quay Wharves. Between 1900 and 1912 Brisbane Wharves Ltd established wharves at Petrie's Bight from Boundary Street to Bowen Terrace, rivalling the Council's Circular Quay facilities in importance. Principal investors in the Brisbane Wharf Company were Howard Smith and William Collin and Sons. From the late 1890s, Howard Smith and Company Ltd occupied the Council's Boundary Street Wharf at Petrie's Bight and in the early years of the 20th century leased the adjacent new wharves constructed by Brisbane Wharves Limited at the base of the New Farm cliffs, below Bowen Terrace. These wharves were extended in the 1920s, and in the 1930s were resumed by the Queensland government for the construction of the Story Bridge. In the early 20th century the roads to Petrie's Bight were improved significantly by the Brisbane City Council, providing an important impetus for the construction of new warehouses in the Upper Adelaide Street area. From 1923 to 1928 the Brisbane City Council implemented its most ambitious town improvement scheme to that date: the widening of Adelaide Street by 14 feet along its entire length. Resumptions in Adelaide Street had commenced in the 1910s, but work on the street widening did not take place until the 1920s. The work was undertaken in stages, commencing in 1923 at the southern end where the new Brisbane City Hall was under construction. Some buildings had the front section removed and a contemporary facade installed on the new road alignment. Elsewhere, earlier buildings were demolished and substantial new structures took their place. At the northern end of Adelaide Street the cutting down of the hill below St John's Cathedral in 1928 facilitated greater access to Petrie Bight, which, close to new city wharves at the end of Boundary Street, boomed in the 1920s as a warehousing district. By 1921 Queensland was poised to resume the economic boom interrupted by the First World War (1914–18). In the period 1922-1928, Queensland experienced its first and last economic boom between the outbreak of war in 1914 and the 1950s. The benefits of the boom economy were reflected throughout the State, but nowhere more so than in Brisbane, with 29% of the Queensland population in December 1924. In physical terms the boom was expressed in a spate of building activity that transported the central business district of Brisbane into the 20th century, shedding its late Victorian image. Wharves, ~1943 The take-off in the building industry was evident during 1922-23, reflected in an active central business district real estate market, and prompting the Brisbane City Council to re-assess central city rateable values in 1923. By September 1925 property in Queen Street, the principal retail and financial street of Brisbane, could be acquired only at highly inflated prices, forcing investors into more peripheral locations such as Petrie's Bight. A fall in the price of building materials, combined with the trend in using concrete, a more economical product than brick, for large construction projects, further stimulated building activity. ==References Attribution === File:CC-BY- icon-80x15.png This Wikipedia article contains text from The Queensland Heritage Register published by the State of Queensland under CC-BY 3.0 AU licence (accessed on 7 July 2014, archived on 8 October 2014). ==External links== Category:Reaches of the Brisbane River Category:Brisbane central business district Category:Fortitude Valley, Queensland Category:Brisbane localities Category:Redeveloped ports and waterfronts in Australia ","title":"Petrie Bight"},{"id":"20355871","text":"Kamel Chater (born April 7, 1972) is a welterweight boxer from Tunisia, who twice won the gold medal at the All-Africa Games in his weight division.

Her two most notable works are the HBO Western series Deadwood, for which she was awarded the Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Series in 2005 and Mad Men, for which she designed from 2007 until its end in 2015. ==Family and childhood== Janie Bryant was born in Bradley Memorial Hospital on October 16, 1968 in Cleveland, Tennessee. She was born to Dorothea Chestnut Bryant (mother) and Paul Edwin Bryant II (father). Bryant’s mother studied art before becoming a schoolteacher and then pursuing a career as a realtor. She is now happily retired.Archive of American Television interview: http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/janie- bryant Throughout Bryant’s childhood, her father ran a business called ‘Bryant Yarns’. He has since died. It has been said that her mother inspired Bryant’s creativity, and that her father taught her how to successfully navigate the professional world. She grew up with three siblings: an older sister and brother (Laura Bryant and Paul Edwin Bryant III) as well as a younger sister (Anna Bryant). While growing up, Bryant was most interested in playing dress- up (while creating different characters through costume), singing, dancing (ballet), and designing clothes for her dolls. Bryant designed her first dress when she was 8 years old. It was a sundress with blue and white stripes, a criss-cross strap in the back, and white anchor buttons in the front. She wore it to her third grade class, but none of her classmates believed her when she told them she had made it. From an early age Bryant became obsessed with old movies, such as Gone with the Wind, The Sound of Music, The Ten Commandments, and The Wizard of Oz. She claims that much of her inspiration throughout her career has stemmed from this obsession for old films. She also enjoyed television shows such as The Partridge Family, The Brady Bunch, Father Knows Best, My Three Sons, Bewitched, and Get Smart.The official Janie Bryant website: http://janiebryant.com/about/ ==High school and college education== Bryant attended Cleveland High School for two years before transferring to Brenau Academy for the rest of her high school education. Brenau Academy is a grades 9-12 college preparatory school, dedicated to preparing young women for a college education. Brenau maintained an all female student body until 2012. Throughout high school she maintained a strong focus on art, painting, and illustration, and believed she was going to pursue a career as an artist or a businesswoman. Unsure of what she wanted to do with her life, and feeling pressure from her family to pursue a career in business, she attended college of Charleston for a summer before transferring to her high school’s all women college, Brenau University. She attended Brenau for a year before transferring to Georgia State University for another year, and then transferred once again (without her parents' knowledge) to the America college of Applied Arts. She finished her college education here while studying fashion design. ==Career== After finishing college, she moved to Paris and then to New York, where she learned the craft from designer John Scher. After meeting a costume designer at a party, Bryant found her calling and began to work on movies and commercials in Manhattan. After some independent work, including a Nick at Nite commercial, Bryant's career grew through work with the David Milch series Big Apple, which led to work on his Deadwood series that ran on HBO. It was her work with Deadwood that later led to an interview for Mad Men with the series creator Matthew Weiner. She has been nominated for four Emmys for her costume design on Mad Men. Mad Men-inspired collections popped up all over runways in 2008 and designers including Michael Kors, Prada and Vera Wang have cited Bryant or the shows on which she worked as key influences. She is credited with a huge role in bringing vintage (and vintage-inspired) pieces to contemporary clothing. Her work on Mad Men has also led to partnerships with Brooks Brothers (a limited-edition Mad Men suit) and Banana Republic's Back to Work line.

Assyrian inscriptions indicate that Tiglath-pileser made a three year campaign in the Levant from 734-732 BC. In the first year he attacked the Philistines and sacked the coastal cities of Tyre and Sidon. In the second year he devastated the land of Aram and the Arabs living in the Trans-Jordan under Queen Shamsi. Although he beat the Arameans in the field, he failed to take Damascus. In the third year he managed to take Damascus, where he slew King Rezin. He also destroyed and leveled the villages in Northern Israel. He boasted of slaying King Pekah, and he installed Hoshea on the throne. Only the fortified capital of Samaria remained, and the entire land was brought low. Archaeology confirms that many cities destroyed during this time period were never rebuilt. According to the Bible (2 Kings 16), the sack of Damascus was instigated by King Ahaz of Judah and ended in Rezin's execution (). The execution of Rezin is neither confirmed nor disconfirmed by independent evidence.Grabbe, Ancient Israel, p.149 According to 2 Kings Rezin allied with Pekah, son of Remaliah, against Ahaz.

Frank Baum, author of the Oz books. It was first published in 1911. In the book, Baum pursued an innovative blending of genres to create a feminist adventure melodrama. The book was followed by a sequel, The Flying Girl and Her Chum, published the next year, 1912. Both books were illustrated by Joseph Pierre Nuyttens, the artist who also illustrated Baum's Annabel and Phoebe Daring in 1912. As with Baum's other books for girls, these two novels were published under the pseudonym \\"Edith Van Dyne.\\" ==Feminism== Baum lived during an era of increasing feminist and suffragette agitation; women gained the right to vote with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, the year after his death. Baum's mother-in-law Matilda Joslyn Gage was a leading feminist of her generation, and influenced Baum's views.Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; pp. 11-12, 28, 31, 63-5 and ff. It is certainly true that Baum pokes gentle fun at the feminist and suffragette movement in his books – the most obvious example being General Jinjur and her Army of Revolt in The Marvelous Land of Oz. Yet Baum also had a strong sympathy with the broad goals of the movement, a sympathy that is reflected in his literary canon. Oz, of course, is a female-dominated society, with Princess Ozma, Glinda, and witches good and bad. Baum wrote a number of books specifically for girls; his ten-novel series Aunt Jane's Nieces portrays young women acting with independence, initiative, and individuality in preference to traditional gender roles.Rogers, pp. 139-40, 143-4 and ff. In one case, Baum went too far for his publishers: though he was their star writer, Reilly & Britton rejected the first version of his 1916 book Mary Louise, \\"presumably because the heroine was not sufficiently idealized.\\"Rogers, p. 220. Though unhappy with their decision, Baum re-wrote the book to deliver a more tame and stereotypical heroine. ==Technology== Dr. Edwin P. Ryland, a Methodist minister and a personal friend of Baum, maintained that if Baum had not pursued his vocation of writing for children \\"he might have been one of the country's best known technical writers for he had a strong leaning toward technical matters.\\"L. Frank Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, Edited with an Introduction and Notes by Michael Patrick Hearn; revised edition, New York, W. W. Norton, 2000; Introduction, p. lxxiv. Many critics who have written about Baum and Oz have noted that Baum's is a technology-friendly fantasy realm, which sets it apart from the more traditional fantasies that preceded it.Marcus Bewley, Masks & Mirrors: Essays in Criticism, New York, Atheneum, 1970.Paul Nathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, 1991.Suzanne Rahn, The Wizard of Oz: Shaping an Imaginary World, New York, Twayne, 1998. Baum's Oz books and other works reveal commonalities with science fiction (The Master Key) and utopian fiction; they contain mechanical men (the Tin Woodman and Tik-Tok), a planned metropolis (the Emerald City), a domed submersible city and miniature submarines (in Glinda of Oz), and similar features. Baum's Flying Girl books provide a dramatic and blatant display of this technological bent. The first book opens with a Foreword in which Baum thanks Wilbur Wright and Glenn Curtiss \\"for curtesies extended during the preparation of this manuscript.\\"L. Frank Baum, The Flying Girl and Her Chum, Foreword by Eric Shanower, Bloomfield, NJ, Hungry Tiger Press, 1997; p. i. Curtiss and the Wright Brothers appear briefly in the book, along with other early \\"aeronauts\\" like Walter Brookins and Arch Hoxsey. Baum's treatment of heavier-than-air powered flight through both books is strongly affirmative. ==Quimby== Baum's aviatrix character Orissa Kane had a real-life counterpart. Harriet Quimby arose to notoriety in the same year as the first Flying Girl book appeared. Yet Baum's book appears to have been written before he could have been influenced by Quimby's brief career (she died in a crash in 1912). The coincidence of the actual Quimby and the fictional Orissa Kane seems to have been nothing more than that – coincidence.The Flying Girl and her Chum, pp. ii-v. ==The Flying Girl== The first novel tells the story of Orissa Kane, the sister of a young man who is building his own flying machine. The 17-year-old Orissa provides financial support for her brother Stephen Kane and their blind mother through her office job, while Steve concentrates on his invention. She also supports Steve's work emotionally, urging him forward. The story involves commercial and technical competition, and sabotage by a competitor. When Steve suffers a broken leg in a crash and cannot fly, Orissa takes his place to prove the validity of his aircraft, demonstrating her own courage and competence in the process. She wins the top prize in an aerial exhibition and gets a boyfriend too, without ever losing \\"her humble and unassuming manner\\" and her other maidenly virtues. (Baum was simultaneously writing a similar story, of a brave girl defending her brother's interests, in his 1911 novel The Daring Twins.) Her brother Steve supports her decision to fly, in the bold spirit characteristic of the new field of aviation. In Chapter 19 he says, \\"The most successful aviators in the future...are bound to be women. As a rule they are lighter than men, more supple and active, quick of perception and less liable to lose their heads in emergencies. The operation of an aeroplane is, it seems to me, especially fitted to women.\\" (No traditionalist or male chauvinist would have written that women are \\"less liable to lose their heads\\" in an emergency than men.) ==...and Her Chum== In the sequel, instrument trouble in Steve's new hydroplane forces Orissa and her friend and passenger Sybil to set down on a remote island. (Baum would structure a similar story, of two girls adventuring, in his final Oz book, Glinda of Oz, later in the decade.)The Flying Girl and Her Chum, p. vi. The second novel is less an aviation tale and more of a straight adventure story than its predecessor. Baum's publisher Sumner C. Britton had the author tone down the book, telling him by letter, \\"You have made the story too thrilling...\\" for a (supposedly) female author and her fans.Rogers, p. 189. ==Later editions== The Flying Girl books were not as popular in their day as the other \\"Edith Van Dyne\\" novels;David Maxine, ed., Oz-story Magazine No. 3 (July 1997), p. 3. they went out of print with their first editions and were not reprinted for eight decades. Baum's publishers apparently knew their market well, and made a valid judgement, on the purely commercial level, in discouraging Baum from creating heroines more independent than his audience would accept. The Flying Girl resurfaced in Oz- story Magazine in 1997, with new illustrations by Eric Shanower. Its sequel, The Flying Girl and Her Chum, was issued by Hungry Tiger Press in a separate edition the same year, with Nuyttens's original pictures. ==References== Category:Books by L.

It is a two-story, stuccoed stone house built in 1840 with wood frame portions constructed about 1785. It was part of a 200-acre farm divided from larger parcels patented by the Dorsey family. The design reflects the transition between the Greek Revival and Italianate architecture styles. The home is associated with Henry Howard Owings, a prominent Howard County landowner and farmer, who also served as a judge of the Orphan's Court for Howard County. Owings purchased the property in 1858 and died at Woodlawn in 1869. The former tobacco farm produced corn, oats, hay, and pork. The majority of the property surrounding Woodland and its slave quarters were subdivided by 1966 and purchased by Howard Research and Development for the planned community development Columbia, Maryland, leaving only 5 acres surrounded by multiple lots intended for development of an Oakland Ridge industrial center and equestrian center. The summer kitchen, smokehouse, corn crib and stable built about 1830 have been replaced by a parking lot. In 2003, Preservation Howard County appealed to the Columbia Association to restore the adjacent stone slave quarters building predating the 1789 Woodlawn house. In 2004 the property surrounding the Woodlawn manor was rezoned from residential to dense office use. All of the 200-year-old trees surrounding the property were declared diseased by the developer-owner and cut down. In June 2006, Developer Ron Brasher submitted plans to build a 71,705sf office building adjacent to Woodlawn with a parking lot surrounding the building on all sides. The project was temporarily delayed due to lack of road access and requests for reduced setbacks. The planning and zoning director cited the developer's efforts to restore and lease the 5000sf mansion for office space or a \\"condo opportunity\\" as a way to preserve the manor recently rezoned by the department. In August 2007, the Columbia Association purchased the slave quarters property and approved another $125,000 for restoration with the construction of the office project pending.

Rated by experts as one of the greatest full contact fighters of all time, Sugarfoot was a superb technician who possessed high fighting I.Q. and lightning speed. He retired from kickboxing in 1996 with a record of 50-1-1, having avenged the only draw of his career but only one defeated Peter, the undefeated Richard Sylla at the WKA World Title in Paris. Cunningham's skills in the ring have been praised by many martial arts legends, including Benny \\"The Jet\\" Urquidez, Bill \\"Superfoot\\" Wallace, Chuck Norris, Dan Inosanto, Rigan Machado, Don \\"The Dragon\\" Wilson and many others. Cunningham maintained a high level competition throughout his career as most of his opponents were either current or former champions. In 1998 in San Jose, California, Peter was honored as the inaugural inductee in the I.S.K.A. Hall of Fame. Cunningham's nickname \\"Sugarfoot\\" is a combination of the names of two great fighters in boxing and kickboxing that his style most resembled, \\"Sugar\\" Ray Leonard and Bill \\"Superfoot\\" Wallace, and it was given to him by his peers at his first dojo in Edmonton, Canada while he was still a teenager. thumb Peter's World Titles included the W.K.A (World Karate Association) Lightweight, Super Lightweight and Junior Walterweight World Titles, the K.I.C.K. (Karate International Council of Kickboxing) Super Lightweight Title, the I.M.F. (International Muay Thai Federation) Junior Welterweight Title, the W.M.A.C World Junior Welterweight Title, and the I.S.K.A. (International Sport Karate Association) Light Welterweight World Title. Sugarfoot is also an actor and has appeared in TV series such as Kung Fu: The Legend Continues and CSI, and in movies such as No Retreat, No Surrender (1986) and The Fighter (2010). After retiring from competition, Sugarfoot transitioned into becoming a successful trainer. His time is split between training professional fighters and teaching boxing and kickboxing to kids and adults. Peter has trained many amateur and professional world champions as well as numerous well-known celebrities. In 2018, currently teaching at House Of Champions in California. Cunningham has written two books, the first of which, a kickboxing training manual entitled Civilized Warring, was published in 1995. He co-authored his second book, \\"Testimonials of a Legendary Champion\\" in 2013. == Early life == Peter D.O. Cunningham was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago on March 25, 1963. When he was six years old, his parents divorced, and his mother Rosel left Trinidad and Tobago together with him and his siblings, and moved to the small island of St. Vincent in the West Indies. This is where Peter watched Enter the Dragon for the first time as a 10-year old and decided that he is \\"going to be like Bruce Lee\\". In 1976, Peter's family moved yet again, this time to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, to start a new life. His mother became a sole bread winner and took care of the children. Peter attended St. Marks Junior High School and St. Joseph Composite High School in Edmonton. == Introduction to martial arts == Peter took his first karate class in February 1978 after being introduced to his first karate dojo and first Sensei Grandmaster Robert Supeene Sr. by junior high school friends. He immediately felt the connection with his Sensei and fell in love with the sport. Seven months later, as an orange belt holder Peter participated in his first karate tournament. Along with winning top prize in his own belt division, he was voted \\"Best Technician\\" of the tournament, an award typically only won by black belts. This tournament marked the beginning of hiscareer. == Fighting career == Retirement fight, Dida Diafat 2, 1996. Peter started his amateur kickboxing career in 1980, when he beat Reg Johnson in Calgary, Canada. Later that month, he began taking boxing lessons with Ted James and his son Rocky at the South Side Legion boxing gym in Edmonton. A few more wins in amateur kickboxing followed, and in January 1981, Peter met the legendary Benny \\"The Jet\\" Urquidez, who was giving a kickboxing seminar in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This is where The Jet told the young fighter \\"you are going to be a great champion\\". Around this time,Peter \\"Sugarfoot\\" Cunningham had his first professional kickboxing fight where he took on the Canadian Champion Gordy Gong. Peter won by a big knock out, a round kick to the head. After the fight, Sensei Rueben Urquidez and Sensei Blinky Rodriguez approached Cunningham and his mother to congratulate him on the big win, and extend an invitation to come and train out of their world class facility in Van Nuys, California, The Jet Center. This was a dream come true for Peter and he gladly accepted. As Sugarfoot made his move to Los Angeles, he was featured on the undercard of Muhammad Ali's exhibition bout with Edmonton Oiler enforcer Dave Semenko. The event took place at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton on June 12, 1983https://thehockeynews.com/news/article/remembering-the-time-muhammad-ali- fought-oilers-tough-guy-dave-semenko. Peter defeated his opponent, who was a World Lightweight Champion, and impressed Ali's trainer and cornerman Bundini Brown, who introduced Sugarfoot to Ali and his family. Ali signed a book for Peter's mother, and then suggested to Bundini to invite the young fighter to come and train at the Joe Lewis - Muhammad Ali Gym in Santa Monica. It seems that it was destiny and that the stars aligned - two of the greatest champions in their respective sports, boxing and kickboxing - both extended an invite to join them and train with them to pursue his championship aspirations. From that point on, and for the next three years Peter trained at both gyms every day, at the Joe Lewis - Muhammad Ali Gym in the morning and at the Jet Center in the afternoon. At this time ,Sugarfoot was fighting professionally in both boxing in kickboxing. He began to gravitate towards kickboxing, and in 1986 after losing a controversial boxing Lightweight title fight, decided to focus solely on kickboxing. == Acting == Peter is also an actor with several movies to his credit. In his first role, Cunningham played the lightweight champion fighter Frank Peters and faced off with action star Jean-Claude Van Damme in the 1986 martial arts film No Retreat, No Surrender. He was also featured in the 1986 Yuen Biao/Corey Yuen film Righting Wrongs. In addition, Peter guest starred opposite David Carradine on the Kung Fu: The Legend Continues television series (1993) and worked on big budget feature I Spy (2002), where he doubled Eddie Murphy. Most recently, Peter was in The Fighter (2010), playing the role of Mike 'Machine Gun' Mungin. On set of The Fighter, 2010 == Trainer == After retiring from competition, Peter continued his career in martial arts as a successful trainer. He has and is continuing to train top professional fighters, amateur fighters, as well as teaching classes for general public, including kids and adults. Over the years, he has trained many World Champion amateur and professional fighters in boxing and kickboxing, as well as well-known celebrities. In 2014, Cunningham was invited to be one of the coaches of the USA Kickboxing Team, and he brought his star pupil German Baltazar along with him. Together, they have led the team to gold medals in several international tournaments and events, including the 2014 Irish Kickboxing Open, 2014 WAKO (World Association of Kickboxing Organizations) tournament in Canada, 2014 Brazilian Kickboxing World Cup and a history-making USA vs. Cuba tournament in Havana, Cuba in 2015. == Other == Peter grew up with siblings Julie, Zoey, Natalie, Vertille, Bert and Patrick.

It was built by wealthy Baltimore attorney, James Mackubin, for his second wife, Gabriella Peter, a great-great- granddaughter of Martha Washington. She grew up at nearby Linwood, the daughter of Maj. George Washington Parke Custis Peter, who was the second son of Martha Parke Custis Peter of Tudor Place, Georgetown. She attended the famed Patapsco Female Institute and was a leading society member in Maryland. She was a cousin of Robert E. Lee's wife and his children spent many summers here after his death. Gabriella was known to be gracious but demanding. She initially lived at nearby Grey Rock but refused to stay there long as her husband had shared that home with his first wife. Her daughters were unable to leave her side during her lifetime, especially after the accidental 1903 death of her youngest son, Parke Custis, rendering them middle-aged spinsters at the time of her death. The Mackubins raised five children here: # Ella Mackubin (1870–1956): unmarried; graduated from Patapsco Female Institute in 1886 # George Mackubin (1872–1964): married Maud Tayloe Perrin of Gloucester County, Virginia; He was the founder of McKubin & Company in 1899, now Legg Mason.

Douglas Anderson, Gold Spring Press, pg. 8–9; the book cites two lists made by Lovecraft of his favorite weird tales, both of which put \\"The Willows\\" at the top. \\"The Willows\\" is an example of early modern horror and is connected within the literary tradition of weird fiction. ==Plot summary== Two friends are midway on a canoe trip down the River Danube. Throughout the story, Blackwood personifies the surrounding environment —river, sun, wind— with powerful and ultimately threatening characteristics. Most ominous are the masses of dense, desultory, menacing willows, which \\"moved of their own will as though alive, and they touched, by some incalculable method, my own keen sense of the horrible.\\" Shortly after landing their canoe for the evening on a sandy island near Bratislava in the Dunajské luhy Protected Landscape Area of Austria-Hungary, the narrator reflects on the river's potency, human qualities, and his own will: > Sleepy at first, but later developing violent desires as it became conscious > of its deep soul, it rolled, like some huge fluid being, through all the > countries we had passed, holding our little craft on its mighty shoulders, > playing roughly with us sometimes, yet always friendly and well-meaning, > till at length we had come inevitably to regard it as a Great Personage. Blackwood also specifically characterizes the silvery, windblown willows as sinister: > And, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves subtly > with my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by reason of their > vast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to represent to the > imagination a new and mighty power, a power, moreover, not altogether > friendly to us. At one point, the two men see a traveler in his \\"flat-bottomed boat\\". However, the man appears to be warning them and ultimately crosses himself before hurtling forward on the river, out of sight. During the night, mysterious forces emerge from within the forest, including dark shapes which seem to trace the narrator's consciousness, tapping sounds outside their tent, shifting gong-like noises, bizarre shadows, and the appearance that the willows have changed location. In the morning, the two realize that one of their paddles is missing, a slit in the canoe needs repair, and some of their food has disappeared. A hint of distrust arises between them. The howling wind dies down on the second day, and a humming calm ensues. During the second night, the second man, the Swede, attempts to hurl himself into the river as a \\"sacrifice\\". However, he is saved by the narrator. The next morning, the Swede claims that the mysterious forces have found another sacrifice which may save them. They discover the corpse of a peasant lodged in roots near the shore. When they touch the body, a flurry of living presence seems to rise from it and disappear into the sky. Later, they see the body is pockmarked with funnel shapes similar to the ones viewed across the island's coastline during their experience. These are \\"Their awful mark!\\" the Swede says. The body is swept away, resembling an \\"otter\\" they thought they had seen the previous day, and the story ends. The precise nature of the mysterious entities in \\"The Willows\\" is unclear, and they appear at times malevolent or treacherous, while at times simply mystical and almost divine: \\"a new order of experience, and in the true sense of the word unearthly,\\" and a world \\"where great things go on unceasingly...vast purposes...that deal directly with the soul, and not indirectly with mere expressions of the soul.\\" These forces are often contrasted with the natural beauty of the area, itself a vigorous dynamic. Overall, the story suggests that the landscape is actually an intersection, a point of contact with a \\"fourth dimension\\" — \\"on the frontier of another world, an alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of willows.\\" ==Reception and influence== *Grace Isabel Colbron, in her 1915 essay, \\"Algernon Blackwood: An Appreciation\\", stated: \\"For sheer naked concentrated horror, unexplained and unexplainable, such tales as...\\"The Willows\\" may be said to lead among the stories of the supernatural\\".Grace Isabel Colbron, \\"Algernon Blackwood: An Appreciation\\", The Bookman, February 1915.

It consists of three sections: the east wing, dating from the early 19th century, the center section, and the west wing. In 1890 the house was partially destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1900. Three outbuildings remain on the White Hall property: a small square frame workshop; a smokehouse-privy; and springhouse. White Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Early owners were Caleb Dorsey and his brother Charles Worthington Dorsey (1787-1864), the first County commissioner of the Howard District of Anne Arundel County. Charles Worthington purchased the home in 1828 from Alfred and Ann Dashiel and N.G. Ridgley. with an original building onsite. He built additions to the home in 1857 hiring the architect Nathan G. Starkweather. The home was given to Dorsey's daughter and Maryland Governor Thomas Watkins Ligon (1810-1881). Charles Worthington died at the residence on 26 May 1864. Dorsey's daughter died at the estate in 1881, followed by Governor Ligon in 1899. The house was passed down throughout the family for well over one hundred years.

He was the sixth son - not the third - ==Life== He was the third son of Frederick de Nicolay, Principal Page to Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III. He was born at St. James's Palace on 14 April 1771 and was a member of the British branch of the Nicolay family. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a cadet on 1 Nov. 1785, but did not obtain a commission as second lieutenant Royal Artillery until 28 May 1790. In April 1791 he embarked for India with two newly formed companies of Royal Artillery, known as the ‘East India Detachment,’ which subsequently formed the nucleus of the old sixth battalion (Duncan, Hist. Roy. Artillery, ii. 2). He served under Lord Cornwallis at the siege of Seringapatam in 1792, and was an assistant engineer at the reduction of Pondicherry in 1793. Meanwhile, with some other artillery subalterns, he had been transferred in November 1792 to the Royal Engineers, in which he became first lieutenant on 15 August 1793 and captain on 29 August 1798. He was present at the capture of Saint Lucia, and was left there as commanding engineer by Sir John Moore. He afterwards served under Sir Ralph Abercromby at Tobago and Trinidad until compelled to return home by a broken thigh, which incapacitated him for duty for two years. When the Royal Staff Corps was formed, to provide a corps for Quartermaster General's and engineer duties which should be under the Horse Guards (instead of under the ordnance), Nicolay was appointed major of the new corps from 26 June 1801, and on 4 April 1805 became lieutenant colonel. He was employed on the defences of the Kent and Sussex coasts during the invasion alarms of 1804–1805, and on intelligence duties under Sir John Moore in Spain in 1808, and was present at Corunna. He became a brevet colonel on 4 June 1813 and in 1815 proceeded to Belgium in command of five companies of the Royal Staff Corps, and was present at the Battle of Waterloo. During the battle he received a wound to the head and was unhorsed by a splinter, but did not report himself wounded. Afterwards he received the Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and Waterloo Medal then proceeded with the army for the occupation of Paris. There he remained until the division destined to occupy the frontier, of which the Staff Corps formed part, moved to Cambray. He became a major general on 12 August 1819. He was Governor of Dominica from April 1824 to July 1831, Governor of Saint Kitts and Nevis, (which included Nevis, Antigua, and the Virgin Islands) from January 1831 to December 1832, and Governor of Mauritius from 1832 to February 1840, an anxious time, as, owing to the recent abolition of slavery and other causes, there was much ill-feeling in the island towards the British. Nicolay was promoted to lieutenant general on 10 January 1837, and was appointed colonel, 1st West India Regiment, 30 November 1839. He died at his residence, Oriel Lodge, Cheltenham, on 3 May 1842.

He was educated at the Halifax Grammar School and, after completing his schooling, joined the British Army. Forrester served during the War of 1812. After the war, he became a dry goods merchant in Halifax. In 1813, he married Elizabeth Martin. Originally a supporter of Joseph Howe, Forrester later withdrew his support because he felt that Howe had made too many compromises to become part of the coalition government. During the financial crisis of 1837, Forrester sued the Bank of Nova Scotia for refusing to redeem paper money for coin. He also lobbied for Halifax's incorporation as a town.

The main house is a log and frame house, the earliest section of which is presumed to date from 1719. The main block comprises three sections, with a large addition on the rear added in 1920. It features a one-story shed-roofed wrap-around porch supported by 22 Doric order columns. Also on the property are the Overseer's/Superintendent's House, Gardener's Cottage, wagon shed, tractor shed and smokehouse with board- and-batten siding, a bank barn, a stone spring house and “Barrack.” Richland was originally part of \\"Altogether,\\" a land grant surveyed on May 10, 1719 by Thomas Worthington and his brother-in-law, Henry Ridgely.Warfield, J.D., Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties, 1905, at 412. A small portion of Richland was also part of \\"Worthington's Range.\\" Thomas Worthington left 300 acres of Altogether and 63 acres of Worthington's Range to his daughter, Ariana Worthington Watkins, who was married to Nicholas Watkins, Jr. Thomas Worthington's will, dated January 9, 1752 and proved after his death in 1753, indicates that Ariana's inheritance was already part of a plantation established by her husband. Ariana divided her holdings among her three sons, John, Nicholas and Gassaway. Richland was part of Gassaway Watkins's inheritance. Gassaway Watkins returned to Richland to live after his service in the American Revolutionary War.Warfield, J.D., Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties, 1905, at 414. The current boundaries of Richland were set in 1801. It shares its northeast border with the original boundary of Doughoregan Manor, patented to Charles Carroll the Settler on 7,000 acres and later expanded to 10,000 acres. Doughoregan Manor served as the summer home of his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence and the only Catholic to do so. Like Richland, Doughoregan remains in the original family today. Gassaway Watkins, born in 1752, was a president of the Society of the Cincinnati of Maryland and, when he died in 1840, he was the last surviving member of the Maryland Old Line (General George Washington reportedly referred to the Maryland Line as the \\"Old Line\\" due to the quality and length of their service during the Battle of Long Island.Polk, Ryan, \\"Holding the Line: The Origin of the 'the Old Line State'\\", Maryland State Archives, 2005.). He was one of the Maryland 400. Colonel Watkins served under General William Smallwood at Long Island and at the Battle of Cowpens, among other engagements. Colonel Watkins was married three times: first to Sarah Jones, who died within a year without issue from the marriage; then, to Ruth Dorsey, with whom he had Gassaway, Bonaparte, Thomas, Turenne, Charlotte and Ann Watkins; and, following Ruth's death, he married Elenora Bowie Clagett on April 26, 1803, with whom he had Caroline Lyles Watkins (1804-1896), Camsadel Bowie Watkins (1805-1842), Eleanor Clagett Watkins (1807-1868), Amanda Watkins (1809 - ), Elizabeth Louise Watkins (1815 - ), Priscilla Agnes Watkins (1817-1893), Margaret Gassaway Watkins (1819-1896), Albina Charlotte Watkins (1822-1899), William Washington Watkins (1810-1880) and John Sebastian Watkins (1813-1893). Elenora Bowie Clagett, Third Wife of Gassaway Watkins Daughter Margaret Gassaway Watkins married Albert Gallatin Warfield. One of their sons and a grandson of Gassaway Watkins, Edwin Warfield, served as the 45th governor of Maryland from 1904 to 1908. He lived at Oakdale Manor in Howard County, which still stands and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. During his lifetime, Gassaway Watkins acquired nearby land, including Hayland Farm (now known as the Walnut Creek housing subdivision) and Walnut Grove (Clarksville, Maryland) (also now a housing subdivision), where he built a manor house that still survives and is listed on the Howard County properties of the Maryland Historical Trust. Gassaway Watkins, Elenora Bowie Clagett Watkins, John Sebastian Watkins and several other family members are buried at Walnut Grove. Howard County historian Ken Short undertook an exhaustive analysis of the history of Walnut Grove. A son of Gassaway Watkins and Elenora Bowie Clagett Watkins, Dr. William Washington Watkins and his wife, Laura Louise Watkins Watkins, ultimately owned Richland Farm. Mrs. Watkins was the daughter of Thomas Jones Watkins (1773-1860), a Baltimore merchant, and Elizabeth Spurrier Watkins (1779-1851). Dr. and Mrs. Watkins were married in Baltimore on May 30, 1837. In 1846, they added a section to the main house at Richland that includes a first floor parlor and second floor bedroom. Their children included Eleanor Elizabeth Watkins (1838-1893); Lewis Jones Watkins (1839–40); Thomas Watkins (1840-1880); Louis Jones Watkins (1843-1888); Amanda Fitzallen Watkins (1845-1917); Dr. William C. Watkins (1846–81); and Laura G. Watkins (1849–52). According to his obituary in the Baltimore Sun on June 2, 1880, Dr. Watkins received an appointment to West Point but preferred instead to pursue the medical profession. He attended the University of Maryland and received his medical degree from the Medical College of Philadelphia. In addition to his service as a medical doctor, Dr. Watkins was elected as a representative of the Howard District of Anne Arundel County in the Maryland legislature. In 1838, Dr. Watkins proposed the \\"Howard District\\" of Anne Arundel County, which became Howard County, Maryland in 1851. He was elected as the first state senator from Howard County thereafter. Beginning in 1845, Dr. Watkins also served as a judge of the Orphan's Court in the Howard District of Anne Arundel County. He ran for the U.S. Congress but was defeated by Thomas Fielder Bowie. Following his departure from the Maryland senate, Dr. Watkins served as a director of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, and he was elected as the Clerk of the Howard County Circuit Court, a post to which a son, Louis J. Watkins, was later appointed. For a period, Louis J. Watkins and his half brother, J. Harwood Watkins, owned the Ellicott City Times. Laura Watkins's brother, Thomas Jr., married Dr. Watkins's sister, Amanda, on February 16, 1835. Thomas died of pneumonia at Richland on January 10, 1874.News clipping inserted in the Watkins family Bible, newspaper unknown. One can only surmise that Thomas was staying at Richland under the care of his brother-in-law, Dr. Watkins. Thomas Watkins, Jr. Laura Louise Watkins died in 1850, and Dr. Watkins subsequently married Margaret Eleanor Harwood. They had two children: Joseph Harwood Watkins (1853-1887) and Sophia Watkins (1855-1870). Dr. Watkins retired to Richland in 1873, where he died on May 31, 1880. An obituary at the time of his death that appears in the Watkins family Bible (newspaper unknown) describes Dr. Watkins: \\"But in his retirement at Richland the people of his county fully realized was still of them and among them. His house continued the abode of the most liberal and unostentatious hospitality, where gathered a large circle of relatives and friends. To all was extended the warm and hearty welcome that bespoke the man.\\" Another obituary observed: \\"Dr. Watkins was possessed of rare social qualities, and had the pleasant manners of the 'old school.' His hospitality was boundless, and his home was the favorite resort of the gentlemen of influence and standing throughout the county. Socially, he was sought and enjoyed not only by the old, but the young as well.\\" The last slave owner at Richland, Dr. Watkins was discussed extensively in the manuscript of Oliver Cromwell Gilbert, which is in the family papers of his great great granddaughter, Stephanie Gilbert. Oliver, a house slave at Walnut Grove, was the son of Cynthia Snowden, the enslaved cook at Walnut Grove, and Joseph Kelly, a free black man from Owingsville, Maryland. His grandmother, Rachel, who was the mother of Cynthia Snowden, \\"had charge of Richland,\\" where many of Gassaway Watkins's slaves lived. (Indeed, Gassaway Watkins's will refers to Richland as the \\"Quarters Place\\".) Oliver's manuscript indicates that Rachel died at Richland. When Gassaway Watkins died, Oliver was first placed with Margaret Watkins Warfield, one of Gassaway's daughters, and then with Dr. Watkins, where he was a house slave. Dr. Watkins's daughter, Eleanor Elizabeth, asked him to accompany her to a nearby Methodist camp meeting in August 1848. He sought and obtained permission to stay at the meeting despite the hesitations of Dr. Watkins. During a break for the white attendees at about 6 pm, the blacks in attendance were told that they could take the seats formerly occupied by their white masters and mistresses. When the white attendees returned for the evening service, Oliver, then about 16 years old, escaped with fourteen other enslaved men. Dr. Watkins and William Clark, his brother-in-law and then owner of Hayland Farm next to Richland, ran an advertisement for the return of Oliver and two others in the Baltimore Sun on August 22, 1848. After Oliver's escape, he changed his name to Oliver Cromwell Gilbert. His manuscript, in turn, was the basis for a lengthy piece in the summer 2011 edition of the Maryland Historical Magazine by Jody R. Fernald, \\"In Slavery and Freedom: Oliver C. Gilbert and Edwin Warfield, Sr.\\" Separately, his life and escape are retold in \\"Oliver Cromwell Gilbert: A Life,\\" published in 2014 by Jody Fernald and Stephanie Gilbert, Oliver's great great granddaughter, as part of the University of New Hampshire Scholar's Repository, Paper 75. Thomas Jones Watkins and his wife, Elizabeth Spurrier Watkins; Dr. William W. Watkins and his wives, Laura Louise and Margaret Harwood Watkins; and Thomas Watkins, Jr. are buried in Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland (Area P, Lot 36). Joshua Worthington Dorsey, whose wife was Eleanor Watkins Dorsey, a daughter of Dr. Watkins who grew up at Richland, next owned Richland Farm.Joshua Worthington Dorsey He was the son of Rinaldo Warfield Dorsey (1812-1850) and Achsah Ann Worthington (1814-1839). A confederate soldier in the Civil War, he owned numerous tracts of Howard County farmland and also owned a large farm supply and hardware business in Ellicott City, Maryland. A directory from the Ellicott City Times describes Mr. Dorsey as a \\"Dealer in Coal and Fertilizers of all kinds; Horses and Vehicles of all kinds to hire, and Horses taken at Livery.\\" He was one of the organizers and a director of the Patapsco National Bank and was a member of St. Peter's Protestant Episcopal Church in Ellicott City. He added many improvements at Richland, including the bank barn; corn crib; a barrack barn; an addition to the Overseer's House for the tenant farmer; and a cistern in the attic of the original log section of the main house that collected rain water for use in the house. Joshua and Eleanor Watkins Dorsey had numerous children: Margaret Warfield Dorsey (1864-1921); William Watkins Dorsey (1865–66); Joshua Worthington Dorsey, Junior (1866-1923); Laura Watkins Dorsey (1868–72); William Rinaldo Dorsey (1869-1935); Sophia Harwood Dorsey (1871–73); Samuel Henry Dorsey (1872–73); John Malcolm Dorsey (1873-1919); Eleanor \\"Nell\\" Bowie Dorsey (1875-1954); Benjamin Henry Dorsey (1877-1962); and Achsah Maria Dorsey (1879-1961). After Eleanor Watkins Dorsey died in 1893, Joshua Worthington Dorsey married Katherine \\"Kate\\" Cooke Worthington (1855-1934) in 1898.According to a death notice in the September 6, 1924 issue of the Baltimore Sun, Katherine's sister Eliza T. Worthington died at Richland on September 5, 1924. When Joshua Worthington Dorsey died in 1918, one of his daughters, Achsah Maria Dorsey Serpell,Achsah Maria Dorsey married Albert Clark Serpell in Ellicott City on February 7, 1906.Albert Clark Serpell Born in Norfolk, Virginia, Mr. Serpell was one of the sons of Georgianna Clark and Goldsborough McDowell Serpell, who made his fortune in lumber, railroads and banking. and a son, Joshua Worthington Dorsey, Jr., bought out the interests of their siblings in Richland. They hired prominent Baltimore architect Bayard Turnbull (1879-1954) F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald rented a rambling cottage known as La Paix from Turnbull on the grounds of Trimbush, Turnbull's Towson, Maryland, estate. to renovate and expand the main house over the period from 1919 to 1920. Rear Admiral Benjamin H. Dorsey Thereafter, Richland served as the venue for many summer family gatherings and parties for the Washington, D.C., \\"navy crowd\\" hosted by Achsah Dorsey Serpell's brother, Rear Adm. Benjamin Henry Dorsey and his wife, Theda Fulton Dorsey (1887-1983). A July 16, 1939 article from the Washington Times Herald describes Richland as the scene of a party for several hundred guests consisting of \\"ranking high officers of the Navy and many from the younger circles in Washington society . . . \\". According to the article, \\"several hundred guests were received on the rich green lawn, where tables were laid for tea, and indoors a section of the Navy Band Orchestra played for dancing.\\" An article in the Washington Post lauded Admiral and Mrs. Dorsey's daughter, Achsah Bowie Dorsey (1921-2001): \\"During the entire party the debutante was the chief center of attention . . . . [Miss Dorsey] had chosen a bouffant frock of white net that contrasted nicely with her dark hair and set off her creamy complexion.\\" In June 1953, Achsah Dorsey Serpell deeded Richland to Achsah Bowie Dorsey Smith, her niece, namesake and daughter of Admiral and Mrs. Dorsey. A 1939 cum laude graduate of the Holton-Arms School, she was a society reporter for the Washington Post and Washington Times Herald, in which she ran a daily column about the social scene in the nation's capital, \\"Ask Achsah.\\" Achsah Bowie Dorsey, 1939 Richland Farm passed to Achsah Dorsey Smith's goddaughter and niece, a granddaughter of Admiral and Mrs. Dorsey, in 2005. It thus remains in the same family after over 300 years and eight generations.

It is about above sea level. The village falls within the municipality of Cuevas del Almanzora. The ruins of El Artial lie just outside the village. ==Crashes of a B-52 and a KC-135 in 1966== The town is noted for a fatal accident in 1966 in which a B-52 Stratofortress of the Strategic Air Command crashed after a midair collision with a KC-135 Stratotanker plane, causing radioactive contamination after its payload of four hydrogen bombs (H-bombs) was dispersed and crashed. There were four thermonuclear weapons in the bomber. The high- explosive igniters in two of these bombs detonated on impact, spreading radioactive material, including deadly plutonium-239, over a wide area of the Spanish countryside, but safety mechanisms and electronics prevented nuclear explosions. The third H-bomb landed via parachute into a stream, where it was relatively intact and was recovered. The fourth H-bomb landed in the Mediterranean Sea, and U.S. Navy searchers took three months to find and recover the device intact. A large amount of contaminated Spanish soil was soon removed, packed up, and shipped across the Atlantic for burial near Barnwell, South Carolina, the site of a large installation of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. In 2001, the Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnológicas (CIEMAT) still detected measurable levels of the radioactive elements plutonium, uranium, and americium over of Palomares. Annual monitoring by American and Spanish researchers has found no evidence of health problems, or of any contaminated food or water resulting from these crashes. Nevertheless, some areas remain contaminated and they cannot be disturbed. Although they are fenced off for safety, the result is that the region is emotionally blighted, and it has missed out on tourist developments like those in most other coastal towns. On 19 October 2015, Spain and the United States signed a statement of intent to discuss further cleanup of this area. Eventually, the United States agreed to remove additional contaminated soil from Palomares to a safe burial site in the United States. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Province of Almería Category:Towns in Spain Category:Radioactively contaminated areas ","title":"Palomares, Almería"},{"id":"20356777","text":"Roberts Inn, is a historic home and farm located at Cooksville, Howard County, Maryland. The complex consists of a -story stuccoed stone house with a reconstructed log wing built about 1808, and several 19th- to early-20th- century agricultural outbuildings, including a frame bank barn, a frame ground barn, a tile dairy, and a frame silo. The construction of the house coincided with the extension of the National Pike through the Cooksville area. Documentary and architectural evidence supports its use as a turnpike tavern from an early date. Tradition holds that Marquis de Lafayette breakfasted at Roberts Inn during his 1824 tour of America.

A product of the Reading academy, he played on loan for a number of Football League clubs before recurring injuries forced him to drop into non-league football. == Playing career  Reading === A forward or left winger, Bignall began his career in the academy at Reading and scored 20 goals for the U18 during the course of his two-year scholarship. He signed a two-year professional contract ahead of the 2008–09 season and spent much of the campaign away on loan, impressing enough to sign a new two-year contract in April 2009. Bignall made his debut for the Royals with a start in a League Cup first round match versus Burton Albion on 11 August 2009 and scored two goals in the 5–1 victory. He also started in the following round versus Barnsley, before leaving the club on loan and returning early through injury on 21 December 2009. He returned to fitness in January 2010 and made one further appearance during the 2009–10 season, as a substitute for Simon Church after 74 minutes of a 1–0 victory over Barnsley on 30 January. Bignall made what would be his final Reading appearance early in the 2010–11 season, with a start in a 1–0 League Cup first round extra time victory over Torquay United on 11 August 2010. He signed a new contract in October 2010, which would keep him at the club until the end of the 2011–12 season. He subsequently spent much of the remainder of the 2010–11 season away on loan. Bignall failed to receive a call into the first team squad during the early months of the 2011–12 season and suffered a season-ending injury while away on loan in October 2011. Bignall's contract expired in June 2012, but remained with the club on a non-contract basis in a bid to return to fitness and he finally departed in 2014.  Loan spells  Between 2008 and 2011, Bignall spent much of his Reading career away on loan from the Madejski Stadium and made 53 appearances and scored five goals for League One clubs Northampton Town, Cheltenham Town, Stockport County, Southampton, Bournemouth, Brentford, Exeter City and Wycombe Wanderers. === Non-league football === In March 2014, Bignall dropped into non-league football to join Conference South club Basingstoke Town and he was a part of the squad which won the 2013–14 Hampshire Senior Cup. He departed the club early in the 2014–15 season and had short spells with National League South clubs Sutton United and Hayes & Yeading United, before returning to The Camrose late in the campaign. He departed for the final time in the summer of 2015 and had short spells with Lincoln City and Gainsborough Trinity, before joining National League South club Hungerford Town in 2016. He remained at Bulpit Lane until his departure at the end of the 2017–18 season. After a year out of football, Bignall played for Isthmian League South Central Division clubs Bracknell Town and Uxbridge during the 2019–20 season. == Coaching career == In September 2018, it was reported that Bignall had returned to Reading to coach in the club's academy, as part of a coaching degree course at Oxford Brookes University. == Personal life == Bignall is colour blind. == Honours == Basingstoke Town * Hampshire Senior Cup: 2013–14 == Career statistics == {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - ! rowspan=2Club ! rowspan=2Season ! colspan=3League ! colspan=2FA Cup ! colspan=2League Cup ! colspan=2Other ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total - !

From its debut in it underwent several modifications and upgrades, which culminated in the last version, the RSA 250. Since its inception, the bike won ten World Championships (one as Gilera, using rebranded Aprilia bikes) making it one of the most successful racing bikes of its category. ==1991-2007: RSV and RSW== From 1991 to 2007 the bike was used in two different configurations: first the original RSV 250, then the RSW 250, a new version of the RSV used by factory teams and riders. Another version named RSW 250 LE was raced by semi-works teams while privateer riders usually raced the RSV 250 kit production racer. Initially the front braking system was available either with 273mm carbon discs or in 300mm carbon steel, then from 1994 onwards the only version used was the double carbon disc, either with 255mm or 273mm length. The rear braking system was one-disc carbon steel, initially at 184mm, then from 1996 at 190mm. ==2007-2009: RSA== In 2007 the bike was made available in a new version, amended to RSA 250, characterized by many different details from previously, including a revised intake system and the new disposition of the gear unit and of thermal groups. The measurements of the frame changed to use a longer swingarm, and obtain benefits both in acceleration and traction. Another change involved use of three accelerometers to get more data for the management of the power of motion in situations of low adhesion in order to speed up the development of Aprilia RSV 4 which entered the Superbike World Championship in 2009. The new engine was more powerful with a wider operational period, between 6,000 rpm to 13,500 rpm for maximum power. The RSA (and the \\"evolution\\" version of the RSW) were used not only by Aprilia, but also by Gilera and Derbi (rebranded as such), since all three brands belong to the Piaggio group.

He was educated at Gisborne Boys' High School from 1929 to 1933, where he played in the school's 1st XV rugby team in 1933, as well as in the 1st XI cricket team. Carson married Marie Patricia Jeffries at St Luke's Church, in the Auckland suburb of Remuera, on 13 August 1940. The couple were to have no children. ==Cricket== Carson, an aggressive left-handed batsman and useful fast-medium bowler, started his cricketing career with a couple of large scores for Auckland in the Plunket Shield. In just his second innings of first-class cricket and second match, Carson scored 290 against Otago at Carisbrook, as part of a 445 run partnership with Paul Whitelaw. The pair created a world record for the third wicket in first-class cricket. Carson's score of 290 is still the highest maiden hundred by a New Zealander. In his very next match, against Wellington at Eden Park, Carson made 194, giving him an aggregate of 496 runs and an average of 165.33 after three innings. His performances with Auckland earned him a call up to the national side for their tour of England in 1937. Although he played 24 matches, all but four of them first-class fixtures, Carson wasn't able to break into the Test side which took on England. He had started the tour well, with 85 runs against Surrey and 86 versus Northamptonshire but he failed to contribute substantial scores in most matches. Carson finished the summer with 627 runs at 19.00. ==Rugby union== When Carson returned to New Zealand he focused on rugby, playing provincially with and for the North Island representative team as a flanker. As with his cricket career, he represented his country at rugby without appearing at Test level. He made his All Blacks debut on 20 July 1938 for a game against the Combined Western Districts. Carson then joined the New Zealand camp for a tour of Australia and played matches against Newcastle and the ACT. ==World War II== Carson embarked on war duty in 1940 and went on to participate in the Crete, North African and Italian campaigns. While serving in Italy with the 5th Field Regiment of the NZ Artillery, as a major, Carson was severely wounded in battle. He was evacuated but died from jaundice aboard a boat from Bari, Italy to Egypt. He was buried at the Heliopolis War Cemetery in Cairo. A distinguished soldier, Carson was awarded the Military Cross in June 1943, and was mentioned in dispatches. ==See also== * List of Auckland representative cricketers ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1916 births Category:1944 deaths Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:New Zealand international rugby union players Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Auckland cricketers Category:New Zealand military personnel killed in World War II Category:Cricketers from Gisborne, New Zealand Category:Ponsonby RFC players Category:Auckland rugby union players Category:People educated at Gisborne Boys' High School Category:Rugby union flankers Category:New Zealand recipients of the Military Cross Category:New Zealand Army officers Category:Rugby union players from Gisborne, New Zealand ","title":"Bill Carson (sportsman)"},{"id":"20356910","text":"Troy, also known as Troy Hill Farm, is a historic slave plantation home located at Elkridge, Howard County, Maryland, United States. It is associated with the prominent Dorsey family of Howard County, who also built Dorsey Hall. ==History== The lands of \\"Troy\\" were surveyed by Hon. John Dorsey in 1694, where he moved in 1696 with 2 slaves. The property stayed in the family though his great-grandson Col. Thomas Dorsey (-1790) of the American Revolution whose estate sold it in 1808. Troy was inherited by Basil Dorsey in 1714, followed by Caleb Dorsey who reduced the land to which was split into two unequal parts in 1760 and given to Sarah Dorsey and Thomas Dorsey. Thomas Dorsey would use the root cellar as a meeting place with Benjamin Warfield of Cherry Grove during the revolutionary war. Thomas's widow Elizabeth split Troy several times to pay debts. Vincent Bailey acquired including Troy for $6,520. A stone house named \\"Troy Hill\\" was built about 1808 on the foundation of an earlier Dorsey house by Vincent Baily and is representative of the late Georgian style in Maryland architecture. The -story fieldstone house is three bays wide and two deep. Outbuildings included a stone barn, smokehouse and dairy. Situated on a hill, the fieldstone basement is unusually large with four rooms. An 1830 fire destroyed the original wood paneling. In 1880, the house was modified with cottage styling. In 1942, the house was modified again into a \\"Colonial Revival\\" style. Further modification occurred by owner Pedro De Valle. Donald Doll was the last resident before the state purchased the property on 16 December 1958 to destroy it to make way for the I-95 project. The house was left in a state of purposeful neglect until Howard County purchased the stripped house and 52 surrounding acres in September 1971 for $67,500. In 1978, Howard County proposed to build an interpretative gardening center at the house. In 1989, the state offered a $350,000 matching grant for renovation, but a spring 1991 fire gutted the building before it was spent. ==Current status== Most of the surrounding Troy Hill farm has been converted into office parks or highway with the exception of one large area of wooded parkland surrounding the unrestored Troy House. In 2012, County Executive Ken Ulman proposed converting the remainder of the Troy Hill estate and wooded parkland into a Tennis Center. After costs escalated, the plans were changed to clear-cut most the wooded parkland around the historic structure to implement revenue-generating ball fields and soccer fields for the parks system, allowing the Troy house to stand in the parking lot as a possible meeting house or restaurant. Troy was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. In 2015, the group Preservation Howard County placed the house on its top 10 most endangered list. ==See also== *Troy Park *List of Howard County properties in the Maryland Historical Trust *Marshalee (Elkridge, Maryland) *Spurrier's Tavern ==References *, including undated photo, at Maryland Historical Trust * Category:Houses completed in 1808 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Georgian architecture in Maryland Category:Howard County, Maryland landmarks Category:Houses in Howard County, Maryland Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Howard County, Maryland ","title":"Troy (Dorsey, Maryland)"},{"id":"20356934","text":"Marine electronics refers to electronics devices designed and classed for use in the marine environment on board ships and yachts where even small drops of salt water will destroy electronics devices. Therefore, the majority of these types of devices are either water resistant or waterproof. Marine electronics devices include chartplotter, marine VHF radio, autopilot and self-steering gear, fishfinder and sonar, marine radar, GPS, fibre optic gyrocompass, satellite television, and marine fuel management. ==Communication== The electronics devices communicate by using a protocol defined by NMEA with two standards available, NMEA 0183 (serial communication network) and NMEA 2000 (controller-area network based technology). There is also Lightweight Ethernet (LWE). In recent years, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has created a new standards suite for \\"Digital interfaces for navigational equipment within a ship\\". This is known as IEC 61162 and included NMEA 0183, NMEA 2000 and LWE. Additionally, different suppliers of marine electronics have their own communications protocol. *A+T Instruments has ESP Ethernet over Ships Power *B&G; has FastNet *Furuno has NavNet (\\"NavNet\\" refers to a product family, and is not a communications protocol.

Here compasses, which includes both gyro compasses and magnetic compasses make up for equipment that is used by the entire shipping industry. ==Industry== Some manufacturers specialize more in equipment for commercial vessels such as tankers and general cargo vessels. This industry is relatively small with worldwide sales of $3.2 billion in 2015. The top manufacturer was Japan-based Furuno, followed closely by Norway-based Navico, a holding company for several current and former industry brands (B&G;, C-MAP, Lowrance Electronics, Simrad Yachting), with revenue of $308 million.

As a Generalmajor he was Chief of the Office Group for Officers’ Education and Welfare of the Army Personnel Office. One of his responsibilities in this appointment was to be court protocol officer of the Army court of honor that investigated army officers suspected of involvement in the 20 July plot. In this capacity on 14 October 1944 he arrived with General Wilhelm Burgdorf at the home of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. Burgdorf had been instructed by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel to offer Rommel three choices: report to Hitler to exculpate himself \\"Two generals from Hitler's headquarters, Wilhelm Burgdorf and Ernst Maisel, visited Rommel at his home on 14 October 1944.

It was built circa 1756, and is a -story Federal style stone house, covered with stucco, with a hyphen and addition that date to circa 1811. Also on the property are a small -story stone overseer's cottage and a 2-story frame-and-stone barn, and the ruins of a log slave quarter. Waverly was a property developed on land first patented by Charles Carroll of Carrollton and later part of the 1703 survey \\"Ranter's Ridge\\" owned by Thomas Browne. The land was resurveyed in 1726 as \\"The Mistake.\\" It was purchased by John Dorsey and deeded to his son and daughter-in-law, Nathan and Sophia Dorsey as the next owners. The property is associated with the Dorsey and Howard families. From the time it was established through the end of the Civil War, Waverly functioned as a plantation where unpaid slave labor was used for farm operations and creation of the wealth and lifestyle afforded to the Dorsey and Howard families. Through deeds, census records and an inventory taken upon the death of George Howard in 1846, information about the enslaved population at Waverly was uncovered. A 1965 article in the Ellicott City Times claimed that 999 slaves worked on the plantation at one time, but research has shown that between 7 to 25 enslaved men, women and children is more accurate. The Ellicott City Times article does not have any primary sources to back up this claim, nor is there an author's name credited to the article. ==History== The Dorsey Era Daniel Carroll sold a parcel of land called \\"The Mistake\\" to John Dorsey of Edward in 1750, and Dorsey was apparently acquiring land on which to establish his four sons. On March 30, 1756 his youngest son, Nathan Dorsey, was deeded 700 acres and seven slaves from his father: Peter, Robin, Joo, Ben, Hagar, Pol and Jenny. This deed also included \\"all the stock of cattle, hoggs [sic], and sheep on the plantation where he now lives.\\" Nathan married Sophia Owings of Baltimore County in 1748, and he likely began developing a plantation at Waverly to support his growing family, as Nathan and Sophia had three children by 1756. Research supports the idea that Nathan built the main block of the mansion circa 1756, which seems reasonable given that this section dates to the eighteenth century. In 1758, Nathan acquired more parcels of land, and by 1764 the acreage had grown from 700 to 875. In 1769, Nathan granted some of the land to his brothers Vachel and Edward. The Howard Era Nathan died in 1773 but the property remained in the Dorsey family until 1786, when his brother Edward Dorsey sold the farm to Colonel John Eager Howard of Baltimore. By 1798 the farm was being rented, or operated, by James Frost. Howard also periodically purchased adjacent parcels of land as they became available, beginning in 1793, and by 1817 had almost doubled the size of this farm. Then, in 1811 he gave the farm of 1,313 acres to his second son, George Howard as a wedding present. George had married Prudence Gough Ridgely of \\"Hampton,\\" in Baltimore County, on 26 December 1811. George and Prudence named the property Waverly after the popular novel by Sir Walter Scott, Waverley. It is not known why the Howards dropped the second 'e' in the naming of their estate. The Howards likely took up residence on the farm shortly after their marriage, although John Eager Howard did not officially deed the property to his son until November 1822, where he hosted events such as partridge hunts. The addition of a hyphen and kitchen wing attached to the south side of the main portion of the house could have been added as early as 1811, if George took up residence then, or sometime shortly after 1822, once he held title to the farm. The Howards raised thirteen children at Waverly including eight sons and five daughters. Of the thirteen, eight survived to adulthood. At Waverly, George led the life of a country gentleman and farmer. Howard was a slaveholder but paradoxically also agreed with the movement of colonizing free Blacks in Africa, stating to the legislature \\"The prosecution of this system may probably at some distant day, tend to the restoration of the whole of our colored population, to the land of their forefathers.”https://www.geni.com/people/Gov-George-Howard/6000000010792766799 But yet in 1842, Howard created and served as chair to the Maryland Slave- Holders Convention with Charles Carrol, Allen Thomas, CD Warfield, Upton Welsh, Benjamin Howard, Wesley Linthicum, and William H. Worthington as representatives from the Howard District of Anne Arundel County. Howard was elected a member of the Governor’s Council in January 1831 and worked closely with his predecessor Daniel Martin. When Gov. Martin died in July 1831, Howard, as President of the Council, succeeded him, taking the oath of office on 22 July of that year. When Martin’s unexpired term ended in January 1832, the Maryland General Assembly elected Howard for a full-year term, receiving 64 of the 82 ballots cast. He advocated the establishment of a State Bank, opposed the doctrine of nullification, was a foe of lotteries, and urged the endowment of Maryland colleges. Howard retired to Waverly following the end of his term. He served as a presidential elector in 1836 and 1840, when he supported the Whig candidate. He died at his home on August 2, 1846, and was probably buried first in the family burial ground at Waverly. His remains were later removed to the Western Cemetery. His body was again removed, but its present resting place is unknown. He is believed to be buried in the Howard family vault at Old Saint Paul's Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland, where his father John Eager Howard is also buried. There is a tombstone onsite for George Howard's son John Eager Howard, named after his grandfather, dated 1838. The stone was placed against the house, leaving the grave site unmarked and unidentified on the property. It is thought that this stone is the central portion of an obelisk, with the point and pedestal portions having been lost at an earlier time, perhaps when remains were removed from Waverly. When George died, an inventory of the entire estate was taken, which included 25 enslaved men, women and children: Elias, Jim, Peter, Henry, Jolen, Jake, Bell, Dan, William (Mimah's son), Joshua, Henry, Joe, Mary, Prudence, Lizzie, Frances, Sidney, Sally & child, Mimah & child, Fanny & child, Betsey, and Old Nancy. More research is needed to determine whether any of the enslaved lived in the mansion, or if there were enough slave cabins on the property to accommodate 25 persons. Currently, there is the ruins of one slave cabin on what is now the Waverly Woods Golf Course property. More research is needed to determine whether the enslaved people at Waverly were buried on the grounds, possibly via a ground penetrating radar survey of the property. After Prudence's death in 1847, she left Waverly in trust to her son, George Jr. A few years later he divided the farm into four parts, for himself and three of his brothers: Dr. Cornelius Howard, Captain Charles Ridgely Howard, and William Waverly Howard. Based on a map in the deed between George Jr. and William, George lived on the parcel that included the mansion. The 1850 slave census shows Charles Howard owning 23 enslaved men, women and children. There are no names on the census, only age and sex. There were four men ages 54, 46, 45 and 19; two females ages 60 and 21; nine girls ages 12, 10, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 2, and 1; and eight boys ages 14, 13, 12, 10, 5, 3, 3, and 1. In 1854, 297.5 acres of the Waverly estate patented as \\"Delaware Bottom\\" were sold by William Howard. He described the land containing for a lime quarry, and lime kiln as heavily timbered without improvements and suitable for wheat and corn. During this time, the nearby Roland Maxwell house was used as a slave quarters for Waverly. Another stacked slate building ruins stands behind an office park next to a pond at 10275 Birmingham Way. Noted with little background in county records simply as the Alexander Hassan ruins after the last property purchaser, the building was part of the 600 acre property when Joseph Judick owned the farm, and kept in good condition until Hassan's ownership. Judick and Brosenne Era George Howard, Jr. sold the mansion and 300 acres to Joseph Judick, a Baltimore City stock dealer and Peoples Bank of Baltimore director, on 23 November 1858 for $15,462.28 adding surrounding parcels totaling 600 acres. According to the 1860 census for District 3 of Howard County, MD, Judick owned eleven slaves, and four slave houses are also noted on the census. As in the 1850 census, only age and sex are listed for the enslaved. There was one 30 year old woman; three girls ages 16, 9 and 1; and seven boys ages 14, 12, 11, 7, 5, 3, and 2. It is interesting to note that for the race of each of the enslaved persons they are \\"M\\", which stood for Mulatto. At the time, that was the terminology used for persons of a mixed race. Judick was renting a portion of Waverly to Frederick Brosenne, but he continued living on the property until his death in 1881. At that time, Brosenne purchased Waverly from Judick's estate. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Twentieth Century to Present The Brosenne family continued to own Waverly until 1964, when it was purchased by the Larry Realty Co. and left vacant. Hassan-Glickfield and Larry Reality teamed together to propose the site to become the next Howard County landfill. When Alpha Ridge was selected instead, the site was subdivided from 279 acres down to 25.2 acres, then to 9.8 acres and again to 3.4 acres which were donated in 1975 to the Society for the Preservation of Maryland Antiques (now known as Preservation Maryland). In 1976 The State of Maryland funded $150,000 followed by $150,000 in federal matching money in 1978 for a restoration. Restoration started in June 1979 with a new roof and modern kitchen installation. In 1981 The Maryland Historical trust donated $32,000 to complete the restoration, using Columbia landscape architect Robert Shaw. Historic Waverly, Inc. was formed in 1985 to operate the facility for meetings and receptions. In 1988 Howard County conducted paid Golf Resources Associates to review land for golf course installations. The consultant recommended Larry Realty property with expansion to the east for a low cost facility. The Estate property was sold to Howard County in 1989 for $450,000. In 1991, 682 acres of the original estate was developed as Waverly Woods. A 932 home development by Donald R Reuwer Jr's company Land Design and Development. Today, Waverly Woods is a dynamic and diverse community. Residents of Woodstock's Waverly Woods can walk to town for groceries, ice cream or their dry cleaning without breaking a sweat. They can swim and play tennis or golf without leaving the neighborhood. Colonial homes -- with soccer balls punctuating the front lawns -- sleek condominiums and chic townhouses ring an 18-hole championship golf course. To top it off, this 680-acre neighborhood is cradled by Patapsco State Park, an herb farm and rolling meadow with white-picket fences. Waverly Woods. Suburban Nirvana. \\"We wanted a place where kids could grow up and repeat some of the things we could do as kids -- get on a bike, go to the grocery store to get milk for mom and not get killed by traffic,\\" said developer Don Reuwer, owner of Land Design and Development in Ellicott City. \\"We wanted a sense of community.\\" Reuwer, with three Howard County landowners, created the concept for Waverly Woods in the early 1980s. The landowners, who had been Reuwer's clients, each held large tracts of family land, nearly half of which had been deeded since the 1700s. Today, Waverly is owned and managed by the Howard County Department of Recreation and Parks for weddings, special events, paranormal investigations and interpretive history events, scout programs, school groups and living history summer camps. ==Gallery== File:Waverly Historic Marker Marriottsville MD Jan 11.JPGWaverly Historic Marker, January 2011 File:Waverly Dwelling Marriottsville MD Jan 11.JPGWaverly Overseer's House, January 2011 File:Waverly Storehouse-Jail Marriottsville MD Jan 11.JPGWaverly Dairy, January 2011 File:Waverly Mansion (24809094131).jpg ==See also== *List of Howard County properties in the Maryland Historical Trust ==References *, including photo from 2001, at Maryland Historical Trust *Historic Waverly Mansion website Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Houses completed in 1756 Category:Howard County, Maryland landmarks Category:Houses in Howard County, Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Howard County, Maryland Category:Slave cabins and quarters in the United States ","title":"Waverly (Marriottsville, Maryland)"},{"id":"20356975","text":"The Palmer Park Boulevard Apartments District is a collection of three apartment buildings located at 1981, 2003 and 2025 West McNichols Road in Highland Park, Michigan. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. ==History== In the early 1920s, the architect Richard H. Marr entered into a partnership with businessman R.B. Oberteuffer (under the name The Fairway Company) to design and build an upscale apartment building at the corner of what was then known as Palmer Park Boulevard and Twelfth Street (now McNichols and Rosa Parks). The development was in response to the growth of the area due to the nearness of both Palmer Park and the Detroit Golf Club. Marr and Oberteuffer built the Fairway in 1923. Soon after, the Young Construction Company hired Marr to design four more apartment buildings along Palmer Park Boulevard: The Southcourse, built in 1924, and the Douglas, Northcourse, and Georgian Apartments, all constructed in 1925. When finished, the five apartment buildings formed a symmetric grouping, with the end buildings essentially alike in design. The first occupants of the apartments tended to be professionals, small business owners, and executives of larger firms. Because of the location, these buildings became some of the most exclusive addresses in Highland Park. However, the two easternmost buildings, the Fairway and the Douglas, suffered severe fire damage and were demolished in the 1990s. ==Description== The three remaining apartment buildings sit adjacent to each other, and in addition to the architectural similarity, all share a uniform height, setback, and general plan.Palmer Park Boulevard Apartment Buildings Historic District from the state of Michigan ===Georgian Apartments=== Georgian Apartments The Georgian Apartments, located at 1981 W. McNichols, was once the center building in the five-building array of apartments. It is a symmetrical, three-story E-plan Georgian Revival structure, and is both larger and differently shaped than the other four original apartment buildings. The building is faced with red brick with limestone trim, and the entire building is topped with a dentil cornice. A retaining wall in the front of the building connects the top and bottom arms of the E, and forms a raised entrance courtyard. Three entrances lead off this court: one in the center leg of the E and one on the inside of each arm. The front facades of each arm consist of three bays, the central one slightly projecting and crowned with a pediment. Windows on the first floor are inset into arches; those on the upper floors have flat tops. The central arm facade holds the most prominent entrance, with rusticated stone on the first floor and a stone pavilion with a deeply recessed doorway. When built, the Georgian offered well-equipped apartments with a large living room, fully equipped kitchen with butler's pantry, three bedrooms, two baths, and a maid's bedroom with bath. There were five apartments per floor, each of approximately 2750 square feet. ===Southcourse Apartments=== Southcourse Apartments The Southcourse Apartments, located at 2003 W. McNichols, is a C-shaped building built of tan and brown brick with limestone trim. A raised entrance court between the arms of the C leads to two entryways in the inside arms of the C. Each entrance is through a paneled door set within a limestone arch. The two facades of the ends of the C have central semicircular flat-roofed bays stretching the height of the building. On the first floor, windows flanking the bays on are set behind stone balconies. Paired arched windows are on the third floor. On the interior, the entryways lead to tiled vestibules, which lead to stairways. Each stair services two apartments per floor, for four on each floor. The apartments are large three bedroom two-bath units of about 2000 square feet. ===Northcourse Apartments=== Northcourse Apartment The Northcourse Apartments, located at 2025 W. McNichols, is also a C-shaped building built of tan and brown brick with limestone trim, with a similar raised entry court with two entryways. The two facades of the ends of the C have central semicircular bays with tile roofs stretching the height of the building. On each floor, French doors flanking the bays on are set behind stone balconies. On the interior, the entryways lead to marble-lined vestibules, which lead to stairways. Each stair services three apartments per floor, for six on each floor. The apartments per floor are larger two-bedroom units of about 2000 square feet, and the remaining four are single-bedroom units of about 1200 square feet. ==See also== *Palmer Park *Palmer Park Apartment Building Historic District == References == Category:Historic districts in Wayne County, Michigan Category:Highland Park, Michigan Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wayne County, Michigan ","title":"Palmer Park Boulevard Apartments District"},{"id":"20357000","text":"The Booksellers's Bill was a 1774 bill introduced into the Parliament of Great Britain in the wake of the important copyright case of Donaldson v.

In particular, Goff LJ observed that there would be a duty to not prevent full performance of terms in a unilateral offer, once performance had begun. ==Facts== Daulia Ltd wanted to buy the premises on Millbank, London from Four Millbank Nominees Ltd, who were mortgagees in possession. Formal contracts were never exchanged, but Daulia argued they did obtain a unilateral contract by the first defendants that they would enter into a written contract of sale, if they attended Four Millbank's offices with a draft contract on terms already negotiated and a deposit. But when Daulia Ltd's representatives attended, Four Millbank refused to exchange. Daulia Ltd claimed breach of the oral agreement. At first instance, Brightman J struck out Daulia Ltd's statement of claim for failing to comply with s.40(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (now, the requirement of form for contracts for interests in land under s.2, Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989). Daulia Ltd appealed. ==Judgment== The Court of Appeal dismissed Daulia Ltd's appeal. They held there was a unilateral contract for disposition of land, and therefore it could not be effective because it did not comply with s.40(1). Furthermore there was no act of part performance, which could lead to a binding contract. In the course of his decision Goff LJ said that had there been part performance, it would be a duty of the offeror to not prevent full performance (see also, Errington v Errington). Goff LJ's judgment went as follows. ==See also== *Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co ==Notes== Category:English contract case law Category:English agreement case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:1977 in case law Category:1977 in British law Category:Auction case law ","title":"Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd"},{"id":"20357197","text":"The Kiviter process is an above ground retorting technology for shale oil extraction. ==History== The Kiviter process is based on the earlier vertical retort technology (Pintsch's generator). This technology underwent a long process of development. The early concept of central inlet of the heat carrier was later replaced by a concept of heat carrier gas cross flow in the retort. The Kiviter technology has been used in Estonia since 1921, when first experimental Kiviter retorts were built. The first commercial scale oil plant based on the Kiviter technology was built in 1924. From 1955 to 2003, Kiviter technology was used for oil shale processing also in Slantsy, Russia. ==Technology== The Kiviter process is classified as an internal combustion technology. The Kiviter retort is a vertical cylindrical vessel that heats coarse oil shale with recycled gases, steam, and air. To supply heat, gases (including produced oil shale gas) and carbonaceous spent residue are burnt within the retort. Raw oil shale is fed into the top of the retort, and is heated by the rising gases, which pass laterally through the descending oil shale causing decomposition of the rock. Pyrolysis is completed in the lower section of the retort, where the spent shale contacted with more hot gas, steam and air is heated to about to gasify and burn the residual carbon (char). Shale oil vapors and evolving gases are delivered to a condensing system, where condensed shale oil is collected, while non-condensable gases are fed back to the retort. Recycled gas enters the bottom of the retort and cools the spent shale, which then leaves the retort through a water-sealed discharge system. The Kiviter process uses large amounts of water, which is polluted during processing, and the solid waste residue contains water-soluble toxic substances that leach into the surrounding area. ==Commercial use== The Kiviter process is used by the Estonian Viru Keemia Grupp's subsidiary VKG Oil. The company operates several Kiviter retorts, the largest of them having a processing capacity of 40 tonnes per hour of oil shale feedstock. ==See also== * Oil shale in Estonia * Alberta Taciuk Process * Petrosix * Galoter process * TOSCO II process * Fushun process * Paraho process ==References== Category:Oil shale technology Category:Oil shale in Estonia ","title":"Kiviter process"},{"id":"20357205","text":"The Sign Language Interpreters Association of New Zealand (SLIANZ) is the national professional body that represents the interests of professional sign language interpreters in New Zealand.McKee, Rachel Locker, About Us, Sign Language Interpreters Association of New Zealand, SLIANZ website, retrieved on 2008-11-24 It was established in 1996, became an incorporated society in 1997, and is an affiliate member of the New Zealand Society of Translators and Interpreters.

Ingushetia in 'state of civil war' , BBC News, 23 November 2008 others have referred to it as an uprising.

Five Years After Nazran, Ingushetia Still Plagued By Militant Violence , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 19 June 2009 However, by 2015 the insurgency in the Republic had greatly weakened, and the casualty toll declined substantially in the intervening years. ==History== On 26 July 2007, a massive security operation was launched in Ingushetia, sparked by a series of attacks including an assassination attempt on President Murat Zyazikov five days earlier. Moscow sent in an additional 2,500 MVD troops, almost tripling the number of special forces in Ingushetia. In the next few days, hundreds of men were rounded up in the sweeps, while several security officers were killed and wounded in the continued attacks. By October 2007, police and security forces in Ingushetia were issued orders to stop informing the media of any \\"incidents of a terrorist nature.\\"\\"Russia: Moscow Says It Will Punish U.S. TV Network Over Basaev Interview \\". RadioFreeEurope RadioLiberty. August 3, 2005. In 2008, Magomed Yevloyev, owner of the highly critical opposition website Ingushetia.ru, was killed while in police custody. The aftermath of the killing was marked by an upsurge in separatist activity and animosity towards Russia and Russians among the Ingush population. At the center of this controversy was the deeply unpopular President Murat Zyazikov, a former KGB general who was criticized both by human rights groups and by some in the Russian government. The Ingush Interior Minister Musa Medov was targeted by a suicide bomber in October 2008. Eventually, Zyazikov was asked to resign. On 30 October 2008, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree to remove Zyazikov from office and replace him with Lieutenant Colonel Yunus-bek Yevkurov. This was hailed by the Ingush opposition as a victory. However, the violence did not end. According to police sources, nearly 50 people (including 27 rebels, 18 policemen and two civilians) died in the almost daily clashes in this small republic (less than 500,000 inhabitants) in the first three months of 2009.Dozens dead in Russian insurgency , BBC News, 17 April 2009 Assassinations and attempted assassinations of high-profile figures continued. On 10 June 2009 Aza Gazgireeva, the Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ingushetia, was gunned down, and on 13 June former Deputy Prime Minister Bashir Aushev was shot dead outside his home.

After 2010, the levels of violence in Ingushetia began to decline, this trend continued, with total casualties in the Republic falling by over 60 percent from 2013 to 2014. In 2014, the insurgency's leader Arthur Getagazhev was killed by security forces. In mid-2015, Yevkurov stated that the insurgency in the Republic had been 'defeated'. He said that 80 fighters from the group had turned themselves in and been given amnesty and that the remaining active insurgents were greatly reduced in numbers. Reasons suggested for this decline, which was reflected more broadly throughout the Insurgency in the North Caucasus, included the deaths of high-ranking insurgency commanders, the increased targeting by security forces of the support infrastructure relied on by the insurgents, and an exodus of insurgents to other conflict zones. ==See also== *2004 Nazran raid *2009 Nazran bombing *East Prigorodny Conflict *Insurgency in the North Caucasus ==References *Lokshina, Tanya.

A year before the factory closed in 1955, Vincent produced the enclosed range of Vincent Black Knight and Black Prince. Philip Vincent described it as a \\"two-wheeled Bentley\\", and the enclosed Vincents attracted a lot of attention at the November 1954 Earls Court show. Quality problems with early production of the glass-fibre mouldings necessitated a replacement supplier causing delays. The last Black Prince left the Vincent production line on Friday, 16 December 1955. ==Development== Falling sales of the Series C Vincent motorcycles during 1952 and 1953 was partly attributed to dated styling, so Philip Vincent sought to update the range and development began on what were to become the Series D machines. The main changes were redesigned frame components, resited oil tank, larger fuel tank, smaller diameter wheels, one-less rear brake drum, new design carburettors and updated electrics. Black Knight and Black Prince versions were innovative in using full enclosure and weather protection, with glass fibre panels that included leg shields and a handlebar fairing. This was not about streamlining for speed, as the fairings reduced top speed by , although the Vincent was already powerful enough for riders of the day – it was instead about the idea that the rider could travel to work in a suit rather than full motorcycle kit. Care was taken to ensure that the engine was still easily accessible for general maintenance, and the rear enclosure was hinged to provide access to the rear wheel and drive chain. Vincent also tried to make it easier for the rider to get the motorcycle on to its new centre-stand by adding a huge lever on the left of the machine that could be operated from the saddle. The frame was also modified, re-siting the oil tank previously contained within the Upper Frame Member under the fuel tank, to underside of the new-design seat. A replacement single tubular strut bolted to the steering head and a single spring-damper unit replaced the twin rear shocks.Motorcycle Sport, July 1979, pp.347–349, 360 P.C. Vincent – A tribute by R.R.H. (Robert 'Bob' Holliday, ex-editor of Motor Cycling) Accessed and added 25 June 2014 ==Launch== The Black Prince was launched at the 1954 Earls Court motorcycle show, together with the 998 cc Vincent Black Knight and the 500 cc Vincent Victor (which never went into production as only the prototype was ever built). There was a lot of interest but much of it was critical, and the Black Prince was termed the motorcycle you either love or hate. The Motor Cycle road tested a Black Prince and concluded that it handled as well as the Vincent Black Shadow with improved fuel consumption. ==Production== Production of the Black Prince began in early 1955. Lucas components replaced the less reliable Miller electrical system, and better ignition – upgraded to coil and distributor – together with Amal Monobloc carburettors improved starting. The rear enclosure, which incorporated the oil tank, was hinged to allow access to the rear wheel and final drive chain. The centre stand was operated by a lever accessible from the saddle and the lower front mudguard stay served as an emergency front stand to facilitate the removal of the front wheel. Delay in delivery of the fibre-glass components from subcontractors delayed the availability of the first production bikes until early 1955. Approximately 200 of the enclosed models were built. ==Financial collapse== Increasingly affluent customers may have encouraged Vincent to go for a high-end luxury touring model, but at the same time high volume and very affordable small cars were flooding the market. Vincent's accountants came to the conclusion that the company was losing money on every Black Prince sold, so the last example of both the model and the marque left the production line on Friday, 16 December 1955. ==Auction record== A 1955 Vincent Black Prince set a new auction world record for the model at Bonham's Summer Classic Sale of Motorcycles and Motorcars in June 2014, selling for £91,100. In 2018, a Vincent Black Lightning, stated to be one of only 19 surviving, set an absolute world record for the highest-price paid for a motorcycle in an auction held by Bonhams at Las Vegas, selling for $US929,000 ($1.16 million Australian).Land speed record-breaking motorcycle to return to Australia after setting top auction price ABC Radio Sydney 2 February 2018.

Courtyard The Dukes of Alburquerque lived in this castle for centuries until they moved to Madrid to be close to the court. Thereafter they used the castle for leisure and holidays, abandoning the building slowly. In the late 19th century the castle was almost completely abandoned, and was the victim of robberies. In 1938 a political prison was created within the castle, and later a sanatorium for prisoners affected by tuberculosis. It was used as a prison until 1966.

She was the first superheated locomotive in the world.Rauter and Scheingraber (1991), pp. 84-90. She was initially designated as Hannover 74 and towards the end as the S 4 Cassel 401. Two further trials locomotives appeared in 1899 and 1900 as Hannover 86 and Berlin 74 also classed as S 3's. They were later reclassified as S 4's Hannover 401 and Posen 401. Not until the teething troubles had been resolved was the S 4 put into series production in 1902 in Borsig, from 1906 also in Henschel and Humboldt. Unlike the prototypes the production engines were developed independently of the S 3, and 104 examples were built in the years to 1909 when procurement was halted in favour of the Prussian S 6. Up to 1906 a smokebox superheater was installed; afterwards smoke tube superheaters were used. The S 4's star waned even before the First World War, so that within a few years most of the engines had disappeared from the tracks. The remainder were employed on passenger train or even goods train duties. In 1923 the Deutsche Reichsbahn recorded 44 S 4's in its provisional renumbering plan as 13 501-544. But by 1925 only four of them were left. These were given running numbers 13 501–504 in 1925 and were retired by 1927. After the First World War, six locomotives were given to the Polish State Railways (PKP), where they were classified as Pd2 class, numbers 1 to 6. During the Second World War five S 4s came into the Reichsbahn holdings from Poland as 13 401–405. Two of them were eventually given back to Poland in 1955 by the DR.

Angappa Chettiar was a cotton merchant and banker. At a very early age, Ramalingam was sent to Coimbatore for schooling. He passed his matriculation with distinction and enrolled at Presidency College, Madras from where he graduated in law in 1904. Soon after his graduation, Ramalingam began to practice at the Madras High Court and served as the president of the Bar Council of Madras. ==Politics== Ramalingam developed a keen interest in politics during his term as the president of the bar council. He served first as the Vice-President and then, the President of the district board of Coimbatore from 1913 onwards. He also served as the vice-chairman and Chairman of the Coimbatore municipality. In 1921, he became a member of the Madras Legislative Council. In 1946, Ramalingam was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of India from Coimbatore. He participated in the debates on federalism and language policy. In 1951, he was elected unopposed to the Lok Sabha from Coimbatore. ==Co-operative movement== Ramalingam Chettiar was one of the pioneers of the co-operative movement in Madras Presidency and was associated with the movement since 1911. He started the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Federation and published a monthly called Kooturavu. He established the Ramalingam Co-operative Training Institute in Coimbatore. He was instrumental in the formation of the Central Co-operative Bank, Urban Bank, Land Development Bank, co-operative milk union and co-operative printing press in Coimbatore. ==Legacy== Ramalingam died in 1952. The co-operative institute he established is still functioning at Coimbatore. After his death, his heirs established the T.A. Ramalingam Chettiar Trust in his memory.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80, based on 15 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Entertainment Weekly‘s Michele Romero described the album as “endlessly uplifting” and praised it for its “instantly addictive compositions”. Praising the album's melodies and production, Slant Magazine’s Jonathan Keefe also found the album “endlessly enjoyable”. AllMusic’s Tim Sendra found similar praise for the album, calling it “a second helping of a particularly good meal” and “a satisfying listening experience”. While seeing “no stand-out tracks”, he noted that “the overall quality of the record is so high and the sound is so perfect, you don't feel like there is something so terribly important missing”. Drowned In Sound’s Dom Gourlay thought that, “[w]hile a tad too long, with this record Jim Noir has shown that the British singer/songwriter can be eccentric and amusing rather than bland and workmanlike - hopefully it will earn its creator his fair share of recognition”. Comparing the album to its predecessor, PopMatters’ Dan Raper called it “much more coherent and complete” as well as “much more mature, and (thereby) much more interesting”. However, he concluded that “Noir can still be goofy” at times, which is why his “music won’t appeal to everyone.” Similarly undecided, The Guardian’s Jude Rogers was critical about the album’s “retrofuturism”: “When this time-travelling works, it dazzles: […] But elsewhere, its perkiness wanes quickly, and the whiff of kitsch sits as awkwardly as a paisley space suit.” ==References== Category:2008 albums Category:Jim Noir albums Category:Barsuk Records albums ","title":"Jim Noir (album)"},{"id":"20357603","text":"Joe Hill Louis (September 23, 1921 – August 5, 1957), born Lester Hill, was an American singer, guitarist, harmonica player and one-man band. He was one of a small number of one-man blues bands (along with fellow Memphis bluesman Doctor Ross) to have recorded commercially in the 1950s. He was also a session musician for Sun Records. He recorded as Chicago Sunny Boy for Meteor Records in 1953. ==Life and career Early life === Louis was born Lester (or possibly Leslie) Hill on September 23, 1921,Harris, 1989, p. 337. in Raines, Tennessee. His nickname \\"Joe Louis\\" arose as a result of a childhood fight with another youth. At the age of 14 he left home to work as a servant for a wealthy Memphis family. He also worked at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis in the late 1930s. From the early 1940s onwards he worked as a musician and one-man band. ===Recording and radio career=== Louis made his recording debut on Columbia Records in 1949, and his music was released on a variety of labels through the 1950s, such as Modern, Checker, Meteor, and Big Town. Louis most notably recording for Sam Phillips' Sun Records, for whom he recorded extensively as a backing musician for a wide variety of other singers as well as under his own name.Turner, 1985, p. 24. His most notable electric blues single, \\"Boogie in the Park\\" (recorded in July 1950 and released the following month), featured Louis performing \\"one of the loudest, most overdriven, and distorted guitar stomps ever recorded\\" while also playing a rudimentary drum kit. It was the only record released on Sam Phillips's early Phillips label before he founded Sun Records. Louis's electric guitar playing is also considered a predecessor of heavy metal music. His most notable recording at Sun Records was probably as guitarist on Rufus Thomas's \\"Bear Cat\\", an answer record to Big Mama Thornton's \\"Hound Dog\\", which reached number 3 on the R&B; chartTurner, 1985, p. 37. and resulted in legal action for copyright infringement. He also shared writing credit for the song \\"Tiger Man\\", which has been recorded by Elvis Presley, among others. Around 1950 he took over the Pepticon Boy radio program on WDIA from B. B. King.Harris 1989, p. 337. He was also known as \\"The Pepticon Boy\\" and \\"The Be-Bop Boy\\". ==Death== Louis died on August 5, 1957, in John Gaston Hospital, in Memphis, at the age of 35, of tetanus contracted as a result of an infected cut on his thumb, sustained while he was working as an odd job man. ==ReferencesBibliography== *Harris, S.

In this view, it does not focus on explaining actual economies but instead on describing a \\"utopia\\" in which Pareto optimality applies. In the opinion of some developers of an alternative approach, the purpose of neoclassical economics is \\"to demonstrate the social optimality if the real world were to resemble the model\\", not \\"to explain the real world as observed empirically\\".Alfred S. Eichner and J. A. Kregel (1975) \\"An Essay on Post-Keynesian Theory: A New Paradigm in Economics\\", Journal of Economic Literature, V. 13, N. 4 (Dec.): pp. 1293–314. In his book Economics as Religion: From Samuelson to Chicago and Beyond, the economist Robert Nelson argued that \\"the priesthood of a modern secular religion of economic progress\\" has promoted a narrow interpretation of economic efficiency, disguised in the form of mathematics.Robert H. Nelson (2001). Economics as Religion: From Samuelson to Chicago and Beyond, University Park, PA: Penn State University Press, p. i ==Assumptions of rationality== The assumption that individuals act rationally may be viewed as ignoring important aspects of human behavior. Many see the \\"economic man\\" as being quite different from real people. Many economists, even contemporaries, have criticized this model of economic man. Thorstein Veblen put it most sardonically. Neoclassical economics assumes a person to be as follows: > [A] lightning calculator of pleasures and pains, who oscillates like a > homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that > shift about the area, but leave him intact.Thorstein Veblen (1898) Why Is > Economics Not an Evolutionary Science?, reprinted in The Place of Science in > Modern Civilization (New York, 1919), p. 73. Large corporations might perhaps come closer to the neoclassical ideal of profit maximization, but this is not necessarily viewed as desirable if this comes at the expense of neglect of wider social issues. The response to this is that neoclassical economics is descriptive and not normative. It addresses such problems with concepts of private versus social utility. ==Equilibrium theory== Problems exist with making the neoclassical general equilibrium theory compatible with an economy that develops over time and includes capital goods. This was explored in a major debate in the 1960s—the \\"Cambridge capital controversy\\"—about the validity of neoclassical economics, with an emphasis on the economic growth, capital, aggregate theory, and the marginal productivity theory of distribution. There were also internal attempts by neoclassical economists to extend the Arrow-Debreu model to disequilibrium investigations of stability and uniqueness. However a result known as the Sonnenschein- Mantel-Debreu theorem suggests that the assumptions that must be made to ensure that the equilibrium is stable and unique are quite restrictive. Neoclassical economics is also often seen as relying too heavily on complex mathematical models, such as those used in general equilibrium theory, without enough regard to whether these actually describe the real economy. Many see an attempt to model a system as complex as a modern economy by a mathematical model as unrealistic and doomed to failure. Famous answer to this criticism is Milton Friedman's claim that theories should be judged by their ability to predict events rather than by the realism of their assumptions. Mathematical models also include those in game theory, linear programming, and econometrics. For a detailed critique of mathematical modeling, as used in the academic and political practice of neoclassical economics, see Pitfalls of Economic Models. In the \\"Concluding Remarks\\" (p. 524) of his 2001 Nobel Prize lecture,Joseph E. Stiglitz. 2001 Nobel Prize lecture: Joseph Stiglitz examined why the neoclassical paradigm—and models based on it—persists, despite his publication, over a decade earlier, of some of his seminal results showing that Information Asymmetries invalidated core Assumptions of that paradigm and its models: :One might ask, how can we explain the persistence of the paradigm for so long? Partly, it must be because, in spite of its deficiencies, it did provide insights into many economic phenomena. [...] But one cannot ignore the possibility that the survival of the [neoclassical] paradigm was partly because the belief in that paradigm, and the policy prescriptions, has served certain interests. In the aftermath of the 2007–2009 global economic meltdown, the profession's attachment to unrealistic models is increasingly being questioned and criticized. After a weeklong workshop, one group of economists released a paper highly critical of their own profession's unethical use of unrealistic models. Their Abstract offers an indictment of fundamental practices: :The economics profession appears to have been unaware of the long build-up to the current worldwide financial crisis and to have significantly underestimated its dimensions once it started to unfold. In our view, this lack of understanding is due to a misallocation of research efforts in economics. We trace the deeper roots of this failure to the profession's focus on models that, by design, disregard key elements driving outcomes in real-world markets. The economics profession has failed in communicating the limitations, weaknesses, and even dangers of its preferred models to the public. This state of affairs makes clear the need for a major reorientation of focus in the research economists undertake, as well as for the establishment of an ethical code that would ask economists to understand and communicate the limitations and potential misuses of their models.Colander, David; Follmer, Hans; Haas, Armin; Goldberg, Michael D.; Juselius, Katarina; Kirman, Alan; Lux, Thomas; and Sloth, Birgitte: (March 9, 2009). Univ. of Copenhagen Dept. of Economics Discussion Paper No. 09-03 The assumption of rational expectations which has been introduced in some more modern neoclassical models (sometimes also called new classical) can also be criticized on the grounds of realism. In general, allegedly overly unrealistic assumptions are one of the most common criticisms towards neoclassical economics. It is fair to say that many (but not all) of these criticisms can only be directed towards a subset of the neoclassical models (for example, there are many neoclassical models where unregulated markets fail to achieve Pareto-optimality and there has recently been an increased interest in modeling non-rational decision making). Economists tend to focus on markets or aggregate outcomes instead of observing individual behavior. Neoclassical economists have argued that evolutionary or \\"market forces\\" tend to select naturally the most “fit“ actors. Hence, neoclassical economic theories are based on assumptions that (competitive) markets provide an environment that involves incentives for economic actors to learn optimal behavior, on average, in the long run. In this line markets are thought to “heal“ the cognitive imperfections of actors through evolutionary forces, compelling most of them to behave \\"as if\\" they were rational.Tilman Slembeck. Learning in Economics: Where Do We Stand? A Behavioral View on Learning in Theory, Practice and Experiments, St. Gallen (Switzerland): Department of Economics, University of St. Gallen, Discussion paper no. 9907, August 1999 pp. 10–12 According to Joseph Stiglitz, “(Economics as taught) in America’s graduate schools .... bears testimony to a triumph of ideology over science.” Recently more and more critics have raised their voices against the way Economics is being taught. On the subject Mark Blaug says: \\"Economics has increasingly become an intellectual game played for its own sake and not for its practical consequences for understanding the economic world. Economists have converted the subject into a sort of social mathematics in which analytical rigour is everything and practical relevance is nothing.” ==Incomplete== James K. Galbraith on his article A contribution on the state of economics in France and the world asks himself: \\"Is there anything missing even from the hotly contested domains of modern mainstream economics?\\" On his opinion, three large areas have disappeared from the teaching of Economics, \\"at very considerable intellectual and social cost\\": the history of economics itself, the proper study of macroeconomic and monetary economics—which have been submerged by the neoclassical emphasis on market transactions between firms and households—and the lack of instruction in differing institutional contexts (political, national and international structures, policy histories).James K. Galbraith (2001) A contribution on the state of economics in France and the world. post- autistic economics newsletter : issue no. 4, January, article 1 ==Learning in Economics: Do Markets Heal?== However recent studies have shown that empirical evidence on this subject is mixed. There is plenty of empirical evidence that \\"anomalous\\" behavior can survive for a long time in real markets such as in market \\"bubbles\\" and market \\"herding\\" (see AVERY & ZEMSKY, 1998). Evidence from the laboratory shows that some anomalies are overcome by cox in real life market environments, while others are not: “The data suggest the market glass is both half-full of deviations and half-empty because some deviations were drained away by learning“ (CAMERER, 1995, 675). Recently empirical evidence has indicated that markets produce the types of learning assumed in the traditional neoclassical Economics only under very limited ideal conditions - which are rarely met in real-life - namely perfect competition and free information (see SUNDER, 1995). It may take an extended period of time for markets to eventually converge to an equilibrium, if at all. Even under ideal conditions especially if the economic actors' initial beliefs are not coordinated. ==See also== * Humanistic economics * Pluralism in economics * Post-autistic economics * Real-world economics * Real-world economics review * Ecological economics * The Other Canon * Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen: Criticising neoclassical economics * Formalist–substantivist debate ==ReferencesBibliography== * Avery, C. & Zemsky, P.

The station originally comprised three 6 MW and one 10 MW steam turbines. The station was expanded in the 1930s. Hyperboloid cooling towers 6 and 7 were constructed between 1937 and 1938, replacing earlier square cooling towers. They were designed by LG Mouchell and Partners. The cooling towers had a total capacity of 10,500,000 gallons per hour. The station was nationalised in 1948 and operated by the British Electricity Authority (1948-1955), the Central Electricity Authority (1955-1957) then from 1 January 1958 the Central Electricity Generating Board. It had a generating capacity of 72 megawatts and was closed on 27 October 1980. The station comprised two Metropolitan Vickers 50 MW and two 30 MW English Electric turbo-alternators. The coal-fired boilers generated 1,500,000 lb/h (189 kg/s) of steam at 580 psi (40 bar) and 427°C. There were three Stirling tri-drum boilers each rated at 100,000 lb/hr; three Stirling tri-drum and three Mitchell ti-drum boilers each rated at 160,000 lb/hr; and two Mitchell tri-drum boilers each rated at 190,000 lb/hr. the annual output of the station was:CEGB Annual report and Accounts, 1961, 1962 & 1963Electricity Commission, Generation of Electricity in Great Britain year ended 31st December 1946.

Positioned directly alongside the major motorway bridge, Tinsley viaduct, the towers were an iconic landmark for the area, particularly due to their prominence when viewed from the M1 motorway. There was a campaign to save the towers from demolition with proposals to turn them into a giant art installation. The two towers were demolished at 03:00 on 24 August 2008. However a significant portion of the north tower remained standing for a short while, which had to be destroyed manually. ==Biomass power station== Plans to construct a new biomass power station on the site were finalised in late 2011. The project was estimated to cost £120 million, and to be completed in 2014. It would generate 30 megawatts of electricity, employing around 30 people, and work began in November 2011. The plant, which is operated by E.ON UK, was commissioned in the summer of 2014, and power is generated by burning waste wood, sourced from the United Kingdom. Waste heat from the process is captured and used to provide a district heating scheme. E.ON have created a community benefits fund, which will be used to support local projects while the plant is operational, and this will include the building of a visitor centre to explain the energy generation process and to interpret the industrial heritage of the location. ==References== Category:Power stations in Yorkshire and the Humber Category:Coal-fired power stations in England Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Sheffield Category:Demolished power stations in the United Kingdom Category:Destroyed landmarks in the United Kingdom ","title":"Blackburn Meadows Power Station"},{"id":"20357845","text":"A bed base A bed base, sometimes called a foundation, is the part of a bed that supports the mattress. The bed base is itself held in place and framed by the bedstead (bed frame). In the United States, box-spring bed bases are very common (to the point where 'bed base' and 'box spring' may be used synonymously). In Europe, sprung slats are much more common. There are three main types: * A traditional box spring consists of a rigid frame containing extra heavy duty springs. This foundation is often paired with an innerspring mattress, as it extends the life of the spring unit at the mattress's core. * An all-wood foundation usually has seven or eight support slats disposed below paperboard or beaverboard. This foundation, variously called a \\"no-flex\\", \\"low-flex\\" or zero-deflection unit, as well as an \\"ortho box\\", provides support similar to a platform foundation.

They often grow alone or gregariously under hardwoods and in mixed woods throughout the southeast of North America. ==Description== Their cap is 3–10 cm, convex to broadly convex or nearly flat in age, sometimes with an obscure, darker bump, and dry. The top is mainly whitish to dingy, developing vaguely concentric brownish to grayish scales towards the center. Their gills are free from the stem, close, and white, becoming pinkish, then brown. The stem is 4–8 cm long, 0.5–1 cm thick, more or less equal, and contains a small bulbous base that bruises yellow. In addition, it has a ring that typically persists into maturity, and a partial veil when covering the gills not developing dark droplets. The flesh is white throughout and staining bright yellow in the base. The taste is not distinctive or somewhat unpleasant. In contrast, the odor is often unpleasant (phenolic), but sometimes not distinctive. The spore print is brown.

The majority of Utah's gross state product is produced along the Wasatch Front, containing the state capital Salt Lake City. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis the gross stated product of Utah in 2010 was 82 billion. The per capita personal income was $36,457 in 2005. Major industries of Utah include: coal mining, cattle ranching, salt production, and government services. According to the 2007 State New Economy Index, Utah is ranked the top state in the nation for Economic Dynamism, determined by, > \\"The degree to which state economies are knowledge-based, globalized, > entrepreneurial, information technology-driven, and innovation-based.\\" In eastern Utah, petroleum production is a major industry.Utah oil & gas production (map) as found at Utah.gov Near Salt Lake City, petroleum refining is done by a number of oil companies. In central Utah, coal production accounts for much of the mining activity. Utah collects personal income tax at a single rate of 5%, but provides tax credits to low and middle income taxpayers to provide a progressive tax system. The state sales tax has a base rate of 4.65 percent,Utah Sales and Use Tax Rates , from utah.gov (the State of Utah's official website). Accessed 2008-03-20. with cities and counties levying additional local sales taxes that vary among the municipalities. Property taxes are assessed and collected locally. Utah does not charge intangible property taxes and does not impose an inheritance tax. As of December 2015, Utah's unemployment rate sat at 3.5%, and ranked 7th out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. ==Farming== Farming plays an extremely important role in rural Utah. Crops like, corn, and barley can be produced despite the dry land. Cultivated land, including isolated farms in river valleys and considerable dry farming acreage, is limited to a small percentage of the state's total area. The bulk of income from agriculture comes from livestock and livestock products, including sheep, cattle, dairying, and an expanding poultry industry. Abundant sunshine provides some compensation for inadequate rainfall, and the climate is generally moderate, allowing for substantial fruit production. ==Tourism== Tourism is a major industry in Utah, as it is well known for its year-round outdoor recreational activities.. With five national parks (Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion), Utah has the third most national parks of any state after Alaska and California. In addition, Utah features seven national monuments, two national recreation areas, six national forests, and numerous state parks and monuments. Utah is well known for its winter activities and has seen an increase in tourism since the 2002 Winter Olympics. Beginning in 1939, with the establishment of Alta Ski Area, Utah's skiing has become world-renowned. Park City is home to the United States Ski Team. Utah's ski resorts are primarily located in northern Utah near Salt Lake City, Park City, Ogden, and Provo. In 2008, for a second year in a row, Deer Valley, in Park City, was ranked the top ski resort in North America by more than 20,000 subscribers of Ski Magazine. In addition to having prime snow conditions and world-class amenities, Northern Utah's ski resorts are well liked among tourists for their convenience and proximity to a large city and International Airport, as well as the close proximity to other ski resorts, allowing skiers the ability to ski at multiple locations in one day. The 2002 Winter Olympics were celebrated in Utah and offered a great boon to the economy of the state. Several facilities were built to accommodate the influx of tourism that accompanied and lingered after the Olympics. Former Olympic venues including Utah Olympic Park and Utah Olympic Oval are still in operation for training and competition and allows the public to participate in numerous activities including ski jumping, bobsleigh, and speed skating. Utah features many cultural attractions such as Temple Square in Salt Lake, the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, and the Utah Shakespearean Festival in Cedar City. Other attractions include Monument Valley, the Great Salt Lake, the Bonneville Salt Flats, and Lake Powell. ==Mining== Bingham Canyon Mine southwest of Salt Lake City. Beginning in the late 19th century with the state's mining boom (including the Bingham Canyon Mine, among the world's largest open pit mines), companies attracted large numbers of immigrants with job opportunities. Since the days of the Utah Territory mining has played a major role in Utah's economy. Historical mining towns include Mercur in Tooele County, Silver Reef in Washington County, Eureka in Juab County, Park City in Summit County and numerous coal mining camps throughout Carbon County such as Castle Gate, Spring Canyon, and Hiawatha. These settlements were characteristic of the boom and bust cycle that dominated mining towns of the American West. During the early part of the Cold War era, uranium was mined in eastern Utah. Today mining activity still plays a major role in the state's economy. Minerals mined in Utah include copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, zinc, lead, and beryllium. Fossil fuels including coal, petroleum, and natural gas continue to play a major role in Utah's economy, especially in the eastern part of the state in counties such as Carbon, Emery, Grand, and Uintah.Utah Department of Community and Culture, Mining Heritage Alliance, Highlights as found at Utah.gov ==References== ","title":"Economy of Utah"},{"id":"20357879","text":"Christmas Under Fire is a 1941 British short documentary film directed by Harry Watt for the Crown Film Unit of the Ministry of Information. It was conceived as propaganda primarily for an American audience, to raise support for the Allied cause during the Second World War. Produced in the context of German bombings of British cities, it depicts the resilience of British civilians despite the hardships they suffered during Christmas 1940, by showing the continuation of Christmas traditions in the face of the disruptions caused by war. The film is a sequel to London Can Take It!, with the same narrator, Quentin Reynolds. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short, which was won by Churchill's Island. ==Synopsis== The film shows Christmas 1940, in the middle of the Blitz. Christmas traditions are depicted in juxtaposition with a wartime backdrop: Christmas trees are dug up for air raid shelters; housewives buy food for the Christmas dinner; theatres stage pantomime productions; schoolchildren produce handmade Christmas cards. People are shown celebrating Christmas while sheltering in the London Underground, accompanied by a carol sung by the choir of King's College, Cambridge. ==Production== Christmas Under Fire Christmas Under Fire was produced by the Crown Film Unit of the Ministry of Information, commissioned as a sequel to London Can Take It. It was designed primarily for distribution in America and, in order to increase the film's appeal to an American audience, Quentin Reynolds from the magazine Collier's Weekly was chosen as the film's narrator; Reynolds had previously written and narrated two other British propaganda films, London Can Take It and London's Reply to Germany's False Claims. The film was produced in the context of The Blitz, the series of German bombing raids on British cities that began in September 1940. A central message of the film is that \\"life goes on\\", with Christmas traditions continuing despite disruption caused by bombing. In order to encourage the support of the American population, the film was designed to shake the complacency of neutral America, while depicting the resilience, determination and defiance of British civilians. One window cleaner, for example, is shown putting up a poster stating: \\"Business As Usual: if you've got no windows, we'll clean your chimneys\\". ==Release and reception== As well as being released in Britain, the film was distributed in America by Warner Brothers, whose income from distributing the film was donated to the Spitfire Fund, which was used to help RAF construction of Spitfire aircraft. Christmas Under Fire was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short, losing to the Stuart Legg film Churchill's Island, another work about the wartime defence of Britain. ===DVD release=== The film is included on volume 3 of the British Film Institute GPO Film Unit DVD collection, If War Should Come. ==References * *, from BFI National Archive *Christmas Under Fire at BFI Screenonline Category:1941 films Category:1940s Christmas films Category:Battle of Britain films Category:British black-and- white films Category:British Christmas films Category:British films Category:British documentary films Category:Christmas in the United Kingdom Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Harry Watt Category:Films set in 1940 Category:Short documentary films Category:1941 documentary films Category:Black-and-white documentary films Category:1941 short films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Films set on the London Underground ","title":"Christmas Under Fire"},{"id":"20357917","text":"The Courier-Times is a twice-weekly newspaper based in Roxboro, North Carolina covering Person County.

The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes and portrayed by actress Melissa George. Introduced as a surgical intern who has an old companionship with the series' protagonist Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), she eventually forms a friendship with Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), and departs after it is revealed she cheated her way into the surgical program. George was invited to meet with Grey's Anatomy executive producers after the show's casting agents saw her in the 2008 television drama, In Treatment. The actress' original contract included 8 to 11 episodes of recurring appearances in season 5, with the possibility of becoming a series regular. She was originally planned to be a romantic foil for Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), but the role was retooled after the latter departed in November 2008. After speculation as to whether the character would become a series-regular, it was confirmed that George's character would not be joining the series and would soon depart. George explained that it was her own decision to leave the show, in response to the assertions that her departure was done to \\"de-gay\\" Grey's Anatomy. The character has received mixed feedback from critics, and has been characterized as \\"naughty\\", \\"mischievous\\", and \\"nutty\\". ==Storylines== Sadie Harris first appears in the season 5 episode \\"These Ties That Bind\\", in which it is made known that she was once a very close friend of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Harris and Meredith Grey had given each other nicknames during an extended vacation in Europe: \\"Die\\" and \\"Death\\", respectively. Meredith Grey's best friend is Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh); Yang becomes jealous of the friendship between Meredith Grey and Harris. Having joined Seattle Grace Hospital as a surgical intern, Harris begins a friendship with fellow intern Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith Grey's sister. The hospital's interns are frustrated with their lack of surgical opportunities, so Harris cuts her own shoulder and then lets the interns stitch it back together. Harris later volunteers herself to have an appendectomy to help the interns learn that surgical procedure, on the condition that she gets a chance to perform one afterwards. The interns make a mistake in the surgery, and Harris is seriously endangered, but is rescued by the residents. The interns are put on probation and rebuked by Meredith Grey, although Harris tells Lexie Grey that she is not apologetic. Following the surgery fiasco, Harris approaches the hospital's chief of surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and claims responsibility for the incident. He informs her that the reason she has not been fired is because of his personal friendship with her father. Later, she flirts with Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), although the relationship is never pursued. Harris continues to pursue a friendship with Lexie Grey, even going as far as to help her cover up Lexie Grey's blooming relationship with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). In \\"Before and After\\", during a competition among the interns set up by Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) notices Harris' lack of medical knowledge. Although he offers to tutor Harris, she declines and chooses not to tell Webber, which O'Malley does instead. When Harris comes out from a talk with Webber, she tells Meredith Grey that she has decided to quit, and that she did not qualify for the surgical program. When she tries to get Meredith Grey to go back to vacationing in Europe, Meredith Grey declines and Harris departs. ==DevelopmentCasting & Creation=== Melissa George received an invitation to meet the show's executive producers, Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers, from Grey's Anatomy casting agents after they saw her recurring guest performances in the television drama In Treatment (2008). George explained that after meeting with the producers, she was set to begin working. George's initial contract included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances, with the possibility of becoming a series-regular. However, according to George's representative, she did not intend to do more than 8 episodes. Harris was first planned to have a romance with Torres, but Rhimes eventually changed that after George started filming. She was initially written as a lesbian, but was revised as bisexual. In January 2009, George confirmed her departure from Grey's Anatomy, and several reasons were cited for her leaving. George said she had decided to leave to pursue another project, and offered praise to the cast members. However, a representative of the show claimed the actress' departure was due to a mutual agreement between Grey's Anatomy and George, explaining that the character's storyline \\"came to a natural end\\", but that everyone was upset with her departure. Following Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith)'s departure, E! Online Kristin Dos Santos asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show, and the rewrite of Harris' storyline, was enforced by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), as part of an attempt to \\"de-gay\\" Grey's Anatomy, but these claims were rebuked by Rhimes. ===Characterization=== George's character has been described as \\"naughty\\" and \\"mischievous\\", as well as \\"nutty\\". She added that Harris' sexuality is not the main aspect of her personality. George called her character \\"broken\\", and opined that her outgoing personality is meant to cover up something else. George stated that the way she portrayed Harris was influenced by the outspokenness of Lisa Rowe, a sociopathic character from Girl, Interrupted (1999) played by Angelina Jolie. Peter Nowalk, one of the show's writers, characterized Harris as \\"quite a flirty gal\\". Other Grey's Anatomy cast members have also commented on the character of Harris; Chandra Wilson stated that Harris is fast-paced, whereas Leigh said that the character is there to \\"wreak havoc on Seattle Grace\\". Entertainment Weekly Michael Ausiello said that Harris is \\"an intern with an open mind towards sexuality\\". Debbie Chang, writing for BuddyTV, and Jonathan Toomey of The Huffington Post also cast ideas about Harris' self-incision in the episode \\"In The Midnight Hour\\", wondering if she \\"has a death wish\\" and \\"what is wrong with her\\". Stacy McKee, a primary writer for the show, said Harris is Meredith Grey's \\"pre-Cristina Cristina\\" and that she shares \\"a history with Meredith that Cristina can't\\". ==Reception== Throughout her run on Grey's Anatomy, the character received mixed feedback among critics. Jon Caramanica of the Los Angeles Times was critical of her character development, calling George \\"woefully misused\\". Writing for The Age, Michael Idato opined that the storyline between Harris and Yang was \\"frosty\\", adding that the writing was in a \\"true soap fashion\\". Darren Devlyn of the Herald Sun wondered if the producers brought in George to \\"shake up the show\\", and found the character's bisexual storyline similar to Hahn's. Speaking of George's exit, Kris De Leon of BuddyTV noted that she departed on the \\"best of terms\\" in comparison with Isaiah Washington (Preston Burke), Smith, and Knight—former cast members who had \\"rocky\\" exits. Erin McWhirter of The Daily Telegraph called George's character \\"outrageous\\" in response to the appendectomy. Former Star-Ledger editor Alan Sepinwall was critical of the character, saying he rolled his eyes in regard to her letting the interns perform procedures on her, sarcastically writing: \\"Ooooh, she's damaged! And sexy! She takes off her top and then eagerly cuts herself for the other interns! That's hot!\\"Sepinwall, Alan (November 14, 2008). \\"Grey's Anatomy, 'These Ties That Bind': Of course, I'm an excellent surgeon. Yeah..\\". What's Alan Watching? Blogspot. Retrieved July 21, 2012. TV Guide Erin Lulevitch referred to her as a \\"masochist\\" due to her self-incision. Scott Ellis of The Sydney Morning Herald enjoyed the character, calling her \\"intriguing\\". Entertainment Weekly Jennifer Armstrong enjoyed Harris in \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", finding it \\"sweet\\" when she took the blame for causing Sloan's penile fracture, to avoid Lexie Grey being embarrassed. Chang of BuddyTV claimed that Harris is \\"kind of a rebel\\", and the Daily News Lauren Johnston deemed her personality \\"brash\\". ==References Category:Fictional characters from Seattle Category:Television characters introduced in 2008 Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Grey's Anatomy characters Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional female doctors ","title":"Sadie Harris"},{"id":"20357926","text":"{{Infobox speedway league season 2 season = 2008 Season premierleague = Edinburgh Monarchs playoffs = Edinburgh Monarchs premierleaguekoc = Somerset Rebels premiertrophy = Edinburgh Monarchs youngshield = Workington Comets pairs = Workington Comets fours = Workington Comets plrc = Tai Woffinden highestaverage = teams = <!--team list is distorting page layout The 2008 Premier League speedway season was the second division of motorcycle speedway racing in the United Kingdom and the 14th season since its creation in 1995.

Originally built in 1919/1920 as a speculation by her builder, rigged as a schooner and named Hollands Trouw after the shipyard where she was built, she was purchased by the Spencer's Gulf Transport Company, renamed, and used for coastal trading in South Australia. The vessel was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as HMAS Falie during World War II, serving first as an examination vessel primarily patrolling the Port of Sydney, Australia, then as an armed stores ship. Returned to her owners in 1946, Falie was used to transport timber, general cargo, grain and explosives around Australia before resuming the South Australian coastal trade to Kangaroo Island and on occasion carrying bulk gypsum from Stenhouse Bay from 1968. She was retired in 1982, then purchased by the South Australian government for preservation. Although initially used for day and overnight sails, by 2005 the ship had to be taken out of survey due to lack of maintenance and funds. ==Design and construction== She was built in Maassluis, Netherlands by W. Richter Uitdenbogaardt, as a gaff rigged schooner in 1919 and named Hollands Trouw. At the time she was built as a speculation by the builder, in the hope of selling her to a prospective buyer. As a result, she sat idle after her launch in 1919 until purchased by Spencer's Gulf Transport Company in 1922. After the purchase, the vessel was fitted with a 100 hp auxiliary engine, and made ready with other alterations for the voyage to Australia. ==Operational history== She was bought by the Spencer's Gulf Transport Company Limited in 1922, and named Falie, after the captain's wife, Philomena \\"Falie\\" Garnaut. In 1923, she sailed to South Australia, and participated in the extensive ketch trade to isolated towns along the coast of South Australia, as well as interstate ports. She also participated in the grain trade, lightering bagged wheat to the windjammers that called at Port Victoria, in South Australia, which as the last port of call in the world for wind-powered ocean-going cargo ships, is significant in world history. During World War II, the Royal Australian Navy requisitioned Falie, and commissioned her as HMAS Falie. Initially she was used as an examination vessel challenging and identifying vessels entering the Port of Sydney. On the night of 31 May 1942, she was acting as one of the sentry vessels outside Sydney Harbour when she struck a Japanese midget submarine trying to infiltrate the harbour. Falie was converted in 1943 to a stores vessel, and was deployed to Papua New Guinea, where she saw action landing troops in enemy territory by night. In 1946, she was de-commissioned and returned to her owners in South Australia. For the next 22 years, she carried timber, general cargo and explosives around the Australian coast, going as far west as Bunbury, as far south to Tasmanian ports such as Strahan, Hobart, Port Huon, and Esperence, and as far north as Cairns, with all ports in between. In 1968, she returned to South Australian waters as a replacement for the schooner Coomonderry in the gypsum and general cargo trade to Kangaroo Island, where she continued to operate as a trading vessel until she was laid up in 1982, and put up for sale, the last ketch to operate commercially in South Australian waters, and one of the last sail-powered trading vessels in Australian waters, the Tasmanian-based vessel Lady Jillian being the other. Operating as an overnight charter vessel between 1986 and 2005, Falie supported fishing and diving tours around the South Australian coastline. Between 1990 and 2005, Falie was the primary vessel used for Rodney Fox Shark Expeditions. Here she featured in many international nature documentaries, filming and photographing great white sharks off South Australia's coast, and entertaining tourists from Australia and around the world on shark cage diving adventures. ==Preservation== Falie was purchased by the Government of South Australia in 1982 and rebuilt as the centre-piece of the State's Jubilee 150 celebrations in 1986, with re-masting, new sails, and the fitting of new accommodation and a galley. With this arrangement, she could carry up to 70 passengers on day trips, or 20 passengers plus nine crew overnight, as well as cargo, and equipment for adventure cruises and shark dive trips. In 2005, a survey revealed that her hull plates had deteriorated to the point where she was no longer able to be kept in survey. She was not returned to seaworthiness as no sponsor could be found to cover the cost of repairs, estimated to be more than a million dollars. In 2007, it was proposed to move Falie to the wharf at American River, Kangaroo Island as an interpretive maritime museum, but by 2009, this had not been acted on. It was suggested that the South Australian government was looking to divest itself of Falie, and that the estimated cost of repairs to the hull was in excess of $3 million. Falie is currently owned by the SA Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (formerly DTEI). In 2017, Falie was one of the ships considered in a study funded by Renewal SA about \\"a strategy for berthing or locating historic ships and vessels within the inner harbour of Port Adelaide.\\" ==References== Category:Ships of South Australia Category:Auxiliary ships of the Royal Australian Navy Category:1919 ships ","title":"Falie"},{"id":"20357950","text":"Siddhu +2 is a 2010 Indian Tamil-language romance film written and directed by K.

Copperiedus can occur from eating acidic foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware, or from exposure to excess copper in drinking water, an IUD or other environmental sources . ==Signs and symptoms== Acute symptoms of copper poisoning by ingestion include vomiting, hematemesis (vomiting of blood), hypotension (low blood pressure), melena (black \\"tarry\\" feces), coma, jaundice (yellowish pigmentation of the skin), and gastrointestinal distress. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate deficiency may be at increased risk of hematologic effects of copper. Hemolytic anemia resulting from the treatment of burns with copper compounds is infrequent. Chronic (long-term) copper exposure can damage the liver and kidneys. Mammals have efficient mechanisms to regulate copper stores such that they are generally protected from excess dietary copper levels. Those same protection mechanisms can cause milder symptoms, which are often misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders. There is a lot of research on the function of the Cu/Zn ratio in neurological, endocrinological, and psychological conditions. Many of the substances that protect us from excess copper perform important functions in our neurological and endocrine systems, leading to diagnostic difficulties. When they are used to bind copper in the plasma, to prevent it from being absorbed in the tissues, their own function may go unfulfilled. Such symptoms often include mood swings, irritability, depression, fatigue, excitation, difficulty focusing, and feeling out of control. To further complicate diagnosis, some symptoms of excess copper are similar to those of a copper deficit. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) in drinking water is 1.3 milligrams per liter.Federal Register / Vol. 65, No. 8 / Wednesday, January 12, 2000 / Rules and Regulations. pp. 1976. The MCL for copper is based on the expectation that a lifetime of consuming copper in water at this level is without adverse effect (gastrointestinal). The US EPA lists copper as a micronutrient and a toxin. Toxicity in mammals includes a wide range of animals and effects such as liver cirrhosis, necrosis in kidneys and the brain, gastrointestinal distress, lesions, low blood pressure, and fetal mortality. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a limit of 0.1 mg/m3 for copper fumes (vapor generated from heating copper) and 1 mg/m3 for copper dusts (fine metallic copper particles) and mists (aerosol of soluble copper) in workroom air during an eight-hour work shift, 40-hour work week.Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Copper, Available Online at: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/metalsheavy/copper.html Toxicity to other species of plants and animals is noted to varying levels. ===Toxicity=== Copper in the blood and blood stream exists in two forms: bound to ceruloplasmin (85–95%), and the rest \\"free\\", loosely bound to albumin and small molecules. Nutritionally, there is a distinct difference between organic and inorganic copper, according to whether the copper ion is bound to an organic ligand. ===EPA cancer data=== The EPA lists no evidence for human cancer incidence connected with copper, and lists animal evidence linking copper to cancer as \\"inadequate\\". Two studies in mice have shown no increased incidence of cancer. One of these used regular injections of copper compounds, including cupric oxide. One study of two strains of mice fed copper compounds found a varying increased incidence of reticulum cell sarcoma in males of one strain, but not the other (there was a slightly increased incidence in females of both strains). These results have not been repeated.EPA results for copper and cancer. Accessed March 11, 2011 ==CauseCookware=== Cookware in which copper is the main structural element (as opposed to copper clad, copper sandwiched or copper colored) is sometimes manufactured without a lining when intended to be used for any of a number of specific culinary tasks, such as preparing preserves or meringues. Otherwise, copper cookware is lined with a non-reactive metal to prevent contact between acidic foods and the structural copper element of the cookware. Excepting for acute or chronic conditions, exposure to copper in cooking is generally considered harmless. According to Paracelsus, dosage makes the poison; as this pertains to copper \\"a defense mechanism has apparently evolved as a consequence of which toxicity in man is very unusual.\\" Acute exposure and attendant copper toxicity is possible when cooking or storing highly acidic foods in unlined copper vessels for extended periods, or by exposing foodstuffs to reactive copper salts (copper corrosion, or verdigris). Continuous, small (\\"chronic\\") exposures of acidic foods to copper may also result in toxicity in cases where either surface area interaction potentials are significant, pH is exceptionally low and concentrated (in the case of cooking with, for example, vinegar or wine), or both, and insufficient time elapses between exposures for normal homeostatic elimination of excess copper. Exceptions to the above may be observed in the case of jam, jelly and preserve -making, wherein unlined copper vessels are used to cook (not to store) acidic preparations, in this case of fruit. Methods of jamming and preserving specify sugar as chemically necessary to the preserving (antibacterial) action, which has the additional effect of mediating (buffering) the interaction of fruit acid with copper, permitting the use of the metal for its efficient thermal transfer properties. ===Non- sparking tools=== OSHA has set safety standards for grinding and sharpening copper and copper alloy tools, which are often used in nonsparking applications. These standards are recorded in the Code of Federal Regulations 29 CFR 1910.134 and 1910.1000. Note: The most important nonsparking copper alloy is beryllium copper, and can lead to beryllium poisoning. ===Drinking water=== With an of 30 mg/kg in rats, \\"gram quantities\\" of copper sulfate are potentially lethal in humans. The suggested safe level of copper in drinking water for humans varies depending on the source, but tends to be pegged at 1.3 mg/l. ===Birth control=== There are conditions in which an individual's copper metabolism is compromised to such an extent that birth control may cause an issue with copper accumulation. They include toxicity or just increased copper from other sources, as well as the increased copper level of the individual's mother via the placenta before birth. ==Pathophysiology== A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as hydroxyl radical in a manner similar to Fenton chemistry. This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed oxidative stress, and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity. Some of the effects of aging may be associated with excess copper. ===Indian childhood cirrhosis === One manifestation of copper toxicity, cirrhosis of the liver in children (Indian childhood cirrhosis), has been linked to boiling milk in copper cookware. The Merck Manual states that recent studies suggest that a genetic defect is associated with this particular cirrhosis. ===Wilson's disease=== An inherited condition called Wilson's disease causes the body to retain copper, since it is not excreted by the liver into the bile. This disease, if untreated, can lead to brain and liver damage, and bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate is under investigation as a therapy against Wilson's disease. ===Alzheimer's disease=== Elevated free copper levels exist in Alzheimer's disease, which has been hypothesized to be linked to inorganic copper consumption. Copper and zinc are known to bind to amyloid beta proteins in Alzheimer's disease. This bound form is thought to mediate the production of reactive oxygen species in the brain. ==DiagnosisICD-9-CM=== ICD-9-CM code 985.8 Toxic effect of other specified metals includes acute & chronic copper poisoning (or other toxic effect) whether intentional, accidental, industrial etc. *In addition, it includes poisoning and toxic effects of other metals including tin, selenium, nickel, iron, heavy metals, thallium, silver, lithium, cobalt, aluminum and bismuth. Some poisonings, e.g. zinc phosphide, would/could also be included as well as under 989.4 Poisoning due to other pesticides, etc. *Excluded are toxic effects of mercury, arsenic, manganese, beryllium, antimony, cadmium, and chromium. ===ICD-10-CM=== {  - !

Vinegar is not recommended to be given, as it assists in solubilizing insoluble copper salts. The inflammatory symptoms are to be treated on general principles, as are the nervous ones. There is some evidence that alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) may work as a milder chelator of tissue-bound copper. Alpha lipoic acid is also being researched for chelating other heavy metals, such as mercury. ==Aquatic life== Too much copper in water may damage marine and freshwater organisms such as fish and molluscs. Fish species vary in their sensitivity to copper, with the LD50 for 96-h exposure to copper sulphate reported to be in the order of 58 mg per litre for Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and 70 mg per litre for catfish (Clarias gariepinus) The chronic effect of sublethal concentrations of copper on fish and other creatures is damage to gills, liver, kidneys and the nervous system. It also interferes with the sense of smell in fish, thus preventing them from choosing good mates or finding their way to mating areas. Copper-based paint is a common marine antifouling agent. In the United States, copper-based paint replaced tributyltin, which was banned due to its toxicity, as a way for boats to control organic growth on their hulls. In 2011, Washington state became the first U.S. state to ban the use of copper-based paint for boating, although it only applied to recreational boats. California has also pursued initiatives to reduce the effect of copper leaching, with the U.S. EPA pursuing research. == Bacteria == Copper and copper alloys such as brass have been found to be toxic to bacteria via the oligodynamic effect. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but common to other heavy metals. Viruses are less susceptible to this effect than bacteria. Associated applications include the use of brass doorknobs in hospitals, which have been found to self-disinfect after eight hours, and mineral sanitizers, in which copper can act as an algicide. Overuse of copper sulfate as an algicide has been speculated to have caused a copper poisoning epidemic on Great Palm Island in 1979. ==References External links == Category:Copper in health Category:Toxic effects of metals ","title":"Copper toxicity"},{"id":"20357995","text":"A Letter from Home is a 1941 British short documentary film directed by Carol Reed.

These included six sets of frames for some 2-4-0 passenger locomotives designed by Craven, and Stroudley produced a new design of 2-4-0 to use these frames. The locomotives in this class were very similar to two 2-4-0 locomotives constructed at Cowlairs railway works for the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in the early 1860s when William Stroudley was the works manager and contained many features of his later designs. Four Belgravia locomotives were constructed at Brighton works in 1872, two of which were rebuilds of earlier 2-2-2 locomotives built for the LB&SCR; by Robert Stephenson and Company and Brighton works. The necessity to use components designed by Craven meant that the locomotives had a number of design features, such as the double frames and the 2-4-0 wheel arrangement, which were not found with Stroudley's later designs, and were the heaviest 2-4-0 locomotives of their time. Two further examples later appeared, one each in 1875 and 1876, these having detail differences from the first four. At first the class suffered from poor steaming, but once this was rectified they went on to give reliable service on secondary passenger trains as well as hauling the \\"business\\" expresses between Brighton and London Bridge until about 1881. Under Stroudley's locomotive classification scheme, the Belgravia class, being \\"Main Line Express\\" engines, were included in Class B, along with most of his 0-4-2 locomotives, and one of his 2-2-2s. By the time that Class B was subdivided into B1, B2, etc. by D. E. Marsh, none of the Belgravia class remained in service. ==Numbering== The two rebuilds were no. 204 Westminster and no. 205 Kensington. The two new engines of 1872 were no. 202 Goodwood and no. 201 Belgravia. The 1875 loco was no. 206 Carisbrooke, and that of 1876 was no. 207 Freshwater. In 1897 the numbers were increased by 300; nos. 501 & 504 were withdrawn in February 1899, but the other four had their numbers increased by a further 100 later the same year. Nos. 605–7 were withdrawn in 1901, leaving no. 602 which was withdrawn in 1902.

Sun almost loses his life to a gunshot from a fleeing suspect due to an unreliable snitch and Michael nearly falling asleep during a door breach. This causes Tong to berate Michael and vows to have him transferred off the team. On the same day however Tong and Sun are called to investigate a stolen car by a crew of criminals who just finished committing a series of robberies. Although Tong and Sun pursue the criminals, they get into a serious car accident involving a passing Jeep who seriously cripples Sun. Tong manages to shoot dead the criminals and put the lead criminal in a coma. Unfortunately to his horror he discovers he also accidentally shot dead Yee the elder daughter of public prosecutor and single mother Gao Min (Zhang Jingchu) who was placed in the trunk of their car when the criminals hijacked another passerby vehicle which belonged to Gao. Unable to handle the guilt, Tong Fei succumbs to a fog of pain. Gao Min, meanwhile, pours all her love and attention to her younger daughter Ling. Three months later, the lead criminal Cheung Yat-tung (Philip Keung) awakens from his coma. Gao Min, who had been working hard on bringing him to justice, insists he stand trial immediately. However complications arise as Ling is suddenly kidnapped by a man seriously damaged in one eye known as Hung King (Nick Cheung) who does shady jobs for hire and has his own agenda. Gao is threatened by the kidnapper to change evidence for Cheung's trial to get him acquitted. Tong is once again thrust into a cat and mouse game to not only save Gao's other daughter but also as redemption from his past mistakes. Tong's tries at first to enlist Gao's assistance but Gao outright refuses claiming she would rather have any other cop save Ling but not Tong as his appearance constantly reminds her of Yee. Tong's investigation goes off the books and leads him to a garbage centre where is discovers the kidnappers SIM card. Tong is forced to turn to help from Christy and then Michael, who at first refuses to cooperate because of Tong's constantly writing bad reports about him in the past and also revealing that Michael is also Tong's cousin.

Sun goes for a lunch break in a restaurant but coincidentally spots Hung in the same restaurant Sun tries to discreetly alert Tong but Hung catches on and flees. A lengthy chase ensures where Tong attempts to Hung, but Hung's fighting skills overpower Tong and disarm him of his weapon. Gunshots from Tong's sidearm attract the attention of multiple Hong Kong PTU officers who gave chase, however Hung is able to evade all the officers in his way. Eventually Tong catches up with Hung, but Hung runs into a nearby armored car and knocks out a security guard commandeering his shotgun and pinning down Tong and the pursuing PTU officers. Haunted briefly by Yee's death Tong's eventually leaves cover and attempt to apprehend Hung but finds that Hung has disappeared and vanished from the scene. Soon after, Tong is forced to surrender his sidearm, pending an officer involved investigation. Gao hears the news and arrives on scene. Tong reveals to Gao about the location where Ling was held. As Tong and Sun enters Hung's apartment, they discover a hidden room where they found Hung's wife whose in a deteriorative state. When Hung has taken back his wife from the police, Tong tracks him down through GPS where he finds Hung and beats him in the head with a rock. After finding Ling, Hung who is now fully blind, surrenders himself to the police. It was revealed that Hung was the driver of the Jeep from the earlier car accident, which results him critical injuries along with his wife.

Retrieved: January 9, 2016. The film was produced, written and directed by Stuart Legg and narrated by Lorne Greene. Warclouds in the Pacific, which warned of an imminent Japanese attack, was released just one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor. ==Synopsis== In 1941, tensions in the Pacific were accentuated by Imperial Japan engaging in the Sino-Japanese War, as well as threatening to go to war with the other great powers in the region: Great Britain and the United States. Throughout the 1900s, global trade had allowed for great advances in industry and technology, but the militaristic government of Japan in the late 1930s, chose to align itself with Nazi Germany, further sending danger signals abroad. In leaving behind its feudal history, Japan became an economic and military superpower but its rise to prominence had repercussions for Canada. Westerners who observed the frenzied activity in Japanese naval yards, began to leave the country, while Japanese-Canadians who had adopted their new homeland, were fearful for what might come. Western nations, including Canada, ramped up their military preparations, knowing that combatant nations already at war might soon be entangled in a Pacific conflict. ==Production== Warclouds in the Pacific was the fifth of the Canada Carries On series, produced with financial backing from the Wartime Information Board, served as a portent of a future Pacific war. The documentary was created as a morale-boosting propaganda film during the Second World War.Morris, Peter. \\"Film Reference Library: Canada Carries On.\\" Canadian Film Encyclopedia.

Most evident to users are its search-oriented features and means of managing e-mail in a \\"conversation view\\" that is similar to an Internet forum. An official redesign of the Gmail interface was rolled out on November 1, 2011 that simplified the look and feel of Gmail into a more minimalist design to provide a more consistent look throughout Google products and services as part of an overall design change. Another major redesign took place April 2018 which introduced new information rights management controls designed for business use cases. == Programming == Gmail makes use of Ajax, employing browser features such as JavaScript, keyboard access keys and Web feed integration. == Organization Advanced search=== Gmail allows users to conduct advanced searches using either the Advanced Search interface or through search operators in the search box. Emails can be searched by their text; by their ‘From’, ‘To’ and ‘Subject’ fields, by their location, date and size; by associated labels, categories and circles, by whether or not the message is read, and by whether or not the message has an attachment. There are also a large number of advanced search operators. By default, Gmail combines search terms with an invisible “AND”. Gmail allows the use of Boolean operators such as “OR” for finding messages that match at least one of the more search terms. ===Filters=== Gmail allows users to create rules (‘filters’) for the automatic organization of incoming mail. Filters are created using the Advanced Search interface using the same criteria as those used for searching. Gmail can perform any combination of the following actions upon an email that meets all the specified criteria in a filter: * archiving (i.e. removing the message from the Inbox) * adding a star * marking as read * marking as important * applying a label * moving to the bin * forwarding to another e-mail address ===Labels=== Labels provide a flexible method of organizing emails since an email can have any number of labels (in contrast to a folder-based system in which an email can belong to only one folder). Labels are much like tags on a blog post. Labels can also do the work of folders if and email is moved to a label – this is the equivalent of applying a label to it as well as archiving it. By default, labels appear on the message list and can be customized with a color. Users can also create sub-labels beneath a label to create a hierarchy or nested labels. Labels can be used as a search criterion and all emails having a particular label can be viewed together through the side menu. Gmail has often received praise for replacing the limitations of hierarchical folders with the flexibility of labels. ===Archiving=== Gmail allows users to 'archive' emails. Archiving removes a conversation from the inbox and can be accessed via the 'All Mail' section. In Gmail, the 'All Mail' section displays all of a user's emails, excluding the ones in Spam and Bin. Technically, when a message is archived, the 'Inbox' label is removed from it. Archiving presents a better alternative to deleting as it helps to tidy up the inbox without deleting messages permanently. Archiving, however, is limited to message threads and individual messages cannot be archived. Moreover, archiving is available only for the inbox, and messages in other places such as Sent Mail cannot be archived. However, according to About.com, this limitation can be overcome by accessing Gmail through IMAP. Archiving is unique to Gmail and is not offered by any other major webmail service or email client. ===Importance markers=== Marking of emails as important is more or less automatic. Users can ‘train’ Gmail in recognizing important messages by manually marking messages as important. Gmail takes into account a number of signals to determine whether a message is important or not. Messages from people who are emailed to or replied to a lot, and messages of the type that are always opened or were recently marked as important or starred, are likely to be marked as important automatically. Also, messages that are sent to a user directly and not through a mailing list, and messages containing certain keywords (password change, transaction details, shipment delivery, ticket confirmation, etc.) are marked as important. Messages of the type that were recently archived or deleted, or are rarely opened are less likely to be marked as important. Important emails can be searched for using the operator “is:important”. Uninterested users have the option to turn off the entire feature. In September 2010, Google introduced the ‘priority inbox’ which makes use of important markers. Priority Inbox splits up the inbox into sections such as “Important and unread”, “Unread”, “Starred” and “Everything else” enabling a user to always see important items on the top. It is an opt-in feature. In a review for Lifehacker, Adam Pash writes that Gmail is only as good at recognizing important emails as any context-ignorant computer can be. However, in another review for Lifehacker, Whitson Gordon calls Priority Inbox \\"one of Gmail’s most unsung features\\". He writes that Priority Inbox can be quite helpful as long as users give it a chance to learn from their habits. ===Inbox tabs and category labels=== Beginning June 2013, Gmail allowed for the usage of tabs in the inbox for automatically categorizing emails by five general categories: * Primary (Person-to-person email conversations) * Social (from social networks, online dating services and media-sharing sites) * Promotions (solicitations, marketing and one-way mailing lists) * Updates (confirmations, receipts, bills and updates) * Forums (discussion threads from forum boards) Users have the choice to hide one or more of the tabs or disable the entire feature. These tabs also appear in Gmail's Android and iOS apps. Even if the use of tabs is switched off, all emails are sorted into one of the five categories, which can be used as automatic labels. Like labels, categories can be used as a search criterion and be made to appear as labels on the message list. All emails with a particular category can be seen together through the side menu. ===Sorting=== Unlike other email web clients, Gmail does not permit users to see the size of an email message or to sort email (for example, alphabetically by subject). == Conversation view == Gmail recognizes messages related by subject and groups them into \\"conversations\\" where messages in a back-and- forth string get collected together and appear stacked one after another, with the newest messages at the top. Any duplicated text is automatically concealed. \\"One of its flagship features ended up being that the messages in your inbox weren’t strictly sequential. Instead, with the aim of making it easier to follow discussion threads, all the messages in a given back-and- forth string were collected into a cluster called a conversation, with any duplicated text automatically concealed.\\" The number of messages in a conversation always appears in parentheses next to the names of people in the conversation. A conversation will break off into a new thread if the subject line of a message is changed, or if the conversation reaches over 100 messages. Replied or forwarded messages from some local (like local Yahoo! Mail) accounts also split up conversations because their subjects contain parameters in the local language, instead of \\"Re\\" or \\"Fwd:\\". User response to conversation view was mixed. Due to reduced control over individual messages, many users were vocal in expressing their dissatisfaction. On September 29, 2010, Google added the option of disabling conversation view in the Gmail web app. Google software engineer Doug Che explained: \\"We really hoped everyone would learn to love conversation view, but we came to realize that it's just not right for some people.\\" Conversation view is still enabled automatically in mobile apps, which remains a source of user frustration. ==Contacts == Gmail automatically saves contact details when forwarding e-mails to a previously unknown recipient. If the user changes, adds, or removes information near an e-mail such as the name while sending any e-mail, it also updates that in the contact list, unless the user is using basic HTML view, designed for people with slower internet connections or browsers that do not support AJAX. When a user starts typing in the To, CC or BCC fields it brings up a list with the relevant contacts, with their name and primary e-mail address. More information, including alternate email addresses, can be added on the Contacts page. These contacts can also be added to a group, which makes sending multiple e-mails to related contacts easier. Images can be added to contacts, which will appear whenever the mouse is over the contact's name. Users can import contacts (in several different ways) from Microsoft Office Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Eudora, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, orkut, and any other contact list in a CSV-format file. Gmail also allows a user to export their contacts to CSV. Gmail allows the importation of Google+ social media contacts, although as of 2018 Google+ is being discontinued. ==Composition == A year after Gmail was announced, Google introduced Rich Text Formatting, which allows the font size, color and text-alignment to be customized, as well as the embedding of bullet points and numbered lists. Gmail also features Autosave — a system for avoiding loss of data in case of a browser crash or other error. During the composition of an e-mail, Gmail automatically saves a draft copy of the message and of any attachments. Although messages begin to be saved once a minute, saving times vary depending on the size of the message. Draft messages that are discarded are not recoverable. Gmail places the cursor above quoted text when replying, which encourages top-posting. Regardless of the formatting of received messages, Gmail's conversation view defaults to showing only unique content, in chronological order. The 'Smart Compose' tool was introduced by Google in May 2018. It uses AI to guess what is going to be written, even before it is typed. It bases some of this on the recipient and email's subject, as well as the user's past writing habits. For example, if the subject reads, \\"Dinner plans\\",then Smart Compose will take that into account as the user begins typing and it suggests normal wording for arranging a meal. Smart Compose helps save time by cutting back on repetitive writing, while reducing the chance of spelling and grammatical errors. == Attachments == Individual Gmail messages including attachments may be up to 25 MB in size. However, users can send files of up to 15 GB in size through Google Drive. Effectively, the files are stored on Google Drive and only links to them are sent. This means that the recipients can access the file only if it is shared with them on Google Drive. Gmail notifies the user if the file being sent is not shared with the recipient and allows the user to modify the sharing settings before sending the file. The files can either be made accessible to anyone with the link, or shared privately with the email recipients. The latter does not work if the recipients do not have a Google account or if the email address receiving the message is not associated with Google. Starting in December 2014, files in Google Drive can also be sent from Gmail as attachments rather than links, thus providing recipients access to the files even if they are later deleted from the sender's Drive. In Gmail, attachments in supported formats are previewed as thumbnails within the message itself and clicking on the thumbnail opens up a full-screen view of the image or document through which users can browse through multiple attachments. Attachments can be downloaded to the hard disk or to a folder on Google Drive, or to Google+ Photos in case of image files. The Gmail interface supports drag and drop of attachments to and from the inbox. Users can add an attachment by dragging it into the mail window. Similarly an attachment can be downloaded by dragging the attachment from the message to the desktop.Drag and drop attachments to save them to your desktop == Addresses== Gmail supports plus-addressing of e-mails. Users can send messages to addresses in the format , where can be any string, and will arrive in the inbox of . This allows users to sign up for different services with different aliases and then easily filter all e-mails from those services. In addition, if users receive spam messages directed to an e-mail address with the extra text, they will know what services have leaked out their e-mail address. However, some websites do not accept email addresses containing \\"+\\", even though the mail-address specification permits use of them. Additionally, Gmail does not recognize dots (periods) as characters within a username. Adding or removing dots from a Gmail address does not change the actual destination address. For instance, the account receives mail sent to or , etc. Likewise, the account receives mail sent to . This too can help in setting up filters for incoming mail. It is also not necessary to include any of dots used during the creation of the account while signing in. However, this does not work in Google Apps for Your Domain. In Apps, each username variation must be entered as a nickname by the domain administrator. Gmail allows the user to add other email accounts to be used as optional sender addresses on outgoing email. The system carries out a verification process to confirm the user's ownership of each email address before it is added. \\"Plus-addresses\\" can also be added as sender addresses in a similar way. Any of the additional addresses can be set as the default address. Optionally, users can set a different \\"reply-to\\" address for each \\"send as\\" address. When using this feature, the address chosen will appear in the \\"From:\\" field of the message header. However, the SMTP envelope sender address will contain the name of the Gmail account used to send the message. Thus the underlying Gmail account address remains readily available: it will typically appear in a \\"Sender:\\" header field, or occasionally in the subject field. Some mail clients will write \\"From: Sender@gmail.com On Behalf Of...\\" upon reply, making the situation very obvious. Gmail does now allow users to specify a 3rd party SMTP server. Gmail can use this to send outgoing email for that particular account avoiding the masked account problem. == Information Rights Management == The 2018 redesign introduced information rights management controls intended to give the sender the ability to \\"remove the option to forward, copy, download or print messages.\\" To achieve this, Google hosts the content of the message on their own servers and only includes a link to the hosted content within the main body of the email, which (non-Gmail) users must click to open the message in their web browser. The feature is only effective against accidental copying, as the user can still take a screenshot or override the print and copy protections entirely by using the developer tools in their web browser. == Confidential Mode == The 2018 redesign introduced a \\"confidential mode\\" that builds upon the information rights management features to allow the sender to later revoke the receiver's access to a message, or to automatically revoke the receiver's access after a prespecified time period (dubbed \\"self-destructing emails\\" by the media). ==Mail fetcher == In addition to adding extra email addresses, Gmail has a feature called \\"Mail Fetcher\\" that allows users to add up to five additional accounts to retrieve mail from via POP3. Once accounts are added, the program asks the user if they want to create a custom sender address automatically if they have not yet done so manually. This feature does not support retrieving mail from IMAP servers. == Product integration== A chat window in Gmail Google Talk, Google's service for instant messaging, can be accessed through a web- based interface on Gmail's site. The web-based interface is able to support voice and video calling and voice messages if the Google Talk client is running in the background. All messages are archived to the Chats mailbox in Gmail unless 'Off the Record' is enabled in Google Talk. If the fellow chatter suddenly has to go offline, any and all further messages sent will be delivered to that person via e-mail, including the entire conversation had previously. Another Google Talk integration feature is voicemail, where the message is sent to the recipient's Gmail inbox; as well as synchronizing contact pictures. On December 4, 2007, Google announced integration with AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), allowing Gmail users to log into their AIM accounts and send instant messages to and see the online status of AIM users. On November 11, 2008, Google announced video chat, which Gmail integrates into its web-based client. Windows XP, Vista or Intel-based Mac is required with a supported browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari 3+). Google Calendar offered Gmail integration soon after its announcement on April 13, 2006. Events can be added while writing a message that get stored on the main Calendar interface. Recipients who use Gmail will then receive an invitation to the event, which they can accept or decline. Furthermore, Gmail attempts to recognize event dates and locations within e-mails, and gives users the option to add the event to a calendar, similar to Microsoft's Exchange Server. Gmail offers further integration with some other Google products. The integration with Google Drive enables users to share large files of up to 15 GB in size stored on Drive through Gmail, and to save email attachments directly to Google Drive. Attachments in supported formats are previewed within the message. Also, pictures can be sent directly from Picasa using a Gmail account. Gmail also offered integration with its now-defunct social networking and messaging tool Google Buzz. With this feature, Gmail users could share links, photos, videos, status messages and comments organized in \\"conversations\\" and visible in the user's inbox.Live From Google's February Event: Google Gets Twittery == Themes == Selection of themes available for Gmail Google started offering users a choice of themes on November 19, 2008 with 31 different themes, ranging from the original light blue color to designs with image backgrounds and transparencies. Many of these themes are dynamic. Gmail uses the location provided by the user to correctly time theme changes with the local sunrise, sunset, or weather. In June 2012, Gmail introduced custom themes, enabling users to set their own backgrounds. Users can either choose from a large number of 'featured' images, upload an image from the computer or phone, choose from Google+ albums, or add an image by URL. On April 2, 2014, Gmail added the ability to share custom themes via email or Google+, or through a public link. == Criticisms == The conversation view groups related messages in a linear stack which a user can expand and collapse. Labelling (tagging) is limited to message threads. Some users can experience difficulties when submitting e-mail addresses from the Gmail address book to the addressee line on the compose e-mail window. The \\"Autocomplete\\" feature can cause problems and does not work under all browsers or operating systems. However, it is possible to open the composed message in a new window so the address book can be opened, or another instance of Gmail can be opened in another window to access the address book. Gmail's current documented help on this issue states: \\"While Gmail doesn't currently support the functionality to open your Contacts list while composing a message, we're testing many new features to improve our service.\\" Although Gmail's advertisements have received praise for not obtruding, they can take up more space than Flash-based banners when up to six \\"sponsored links\\" appear next to an email. Additionally, when activated, opening emails makes the Web Clips RSS-feed bar display another sponsored link. Often the number of advertisements displayed in the Web Clips bar outnumbers the number of RSS feeds the user has requested. However, when a Gmail message is sent to another email address of a different provider, there will be no advertisements in the message unlike most other webmail providers. When a Gmail mailbox reaches capacity, users can search for emails by size in order to delete the largest ones first. The web interface can help in this situation by searching for emails with attachments, but it does not indicate the sizes of those attachments. == See also == * Gmail * History of Gmail * Comparison of webmail providers * List of Google products * Mailplane Gmail client for Mac OS X == References  External links== * Gmail Category:Gmail Category:Software features ","title":"Gmail interface"},{"id":"20358325","text":"Children of Mars is a 1943 American short documentary film directed by Frank Donovan.

Destination dispatch is an optimization technique used for multi- elevator installations, which groups passengers for the same destinations into the same elevators, thereby reducing waiting and travel times when compared to a traditional approach where all passengers wishing to ascend or descend enter any available lift and then request their destination. Using destination dispatch, passengers request travel to a particular floor using a keypad, touch screen, or proximity card room-key prior in the lobby and are immediately directed to an appropriate elevator car. ==Algorithms== Schindler. This elevator is from JW Marriott hotel in Washington D.C.. Based on information about the trips that passengers wish to make, the controller will dynamically allocate individuals to elevators to avoid excessive intermediate stops. Overall trip-times can be reduced by 25% with capacity up by 30%. Controllers can also offer different levels of service to passengers based on information contained in key-cards. A high-privilege user may be allocated the nearest available elevator and always be guaranteed a direct service to their floor, and may be allocated an elevator with exclusive use; other users, such as handicapped people, may be provided with accessibility features such as extended door-opening times. ==Limitations== The smooth operation of a destination dispatch system depends upon each passenger indicating their destination intention separately. In most cases, the elevator system has no way of differentiating a group of passengers from a single passenger if the group's destination is only keyed in a single time. This could potentially lead to an elevator stopping to pick up more passengers than the elevator actually has capacity for, creating delays for other users. This situation is handled by two solutions, a load vane sensor on the elevator, or a group function button on the keypad. The load vane will tell the elevator controller that there is a high load in the elevator car, this makes it so the elevator doesn't stop at other floors until the load is low enough to pick up more passengers. The group function button asks for how many passengers are going to a floor, and then the system sends the correct number of elevators to that floor if available. ==References *Understanding the Benefits and Limitations of Destination Dispatch Category:Elevators Category:Optimization algorithms and methods ","title":"Destination dispatch"},{"id":"20358421","text":"Target proteins are functional biomolecules that are addressed and controlled by biologically active compounds. They are used in the processes of transduction, transformation and conjugation. The identification of target proteins, the investigation of signal transduction processes and the understanding of their interaction with ligands are key elements of modern biomedical research. Since the interaction with target proteins is the molecular origin of most drugs, their particular importance for molecular biology, molecular pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences is obvious. Target proteins control the action and the kinetic behavior of drugs within the organism. The elucidation of structure, conformational signaling and catalytic properties of particular target proteins facilitates a rational design of drugs and biotechnological processes. Known as biologicals, target proteins can also be drugs by themselves when their modification and formulation is emphasized within the pharmaceutical sciences. Finally, target protein - inducer interactions can be exploited for biomolecular transcription regulating systems in order to control for example gene therapeutic approaches. == See also == * Biological target == References == * == External links == * Target Protein Database of the University of Kansas * Myprotein Category:Drug discovery ","title":"Target protein"},{"id":"20358428","text":"The Gaston Gazette is an American, English Language daily newspaper based in Gastonia, North Carolina.

A discrete computer simulation, or simply a computer simulation, is a computer program that tries to reproduce, for pedagogical or scientific purposes, a natural phenomenon through the visualization of the different states that it can have. Each of these states is described by a set of variables that change in time due to the iteration of a given algorithm. In creating a simulation with the help of EJSS, the user does not program the simulation at the level of writing code, instead the user is working at a higher conceptual level, declaring and organizing the equations and other mathematical expressions that operate the simulation. EJSS handles the technical aspects of coding the simulation in the Java programming language, thus freeing the user to concentrate on the simulation's content. The generated Java or JavaScript code can, in terms of efficiency and sophistication, be taken as the creation of a professional programmer. EJSS is written in the Java programming language and the created simulation are in Java or JavaScript. Java Virtual Machines (JVM) are available for many different platforms; a platform for which a JVM is available can run Java programs. Though Java applets were popular before 2014, JavaScript Applets outputs can be run on almost any device now, including Android and iOS. EJSS has its own format for storing the simulations, which is based on XML, EJS and EJSS and carries the extension .xml, .ejs and .ejss.

Donegal Carpets can be found in Dublin Castle, the Royal Pavilion of Brighton, Eltham Palace, and the U.S. White House as well as many other parts of the world. ==History== Although making carpets in Donegal is an ancient tradition, the company Donegal Carpets is but 100 odd years old and was founded in 1898 by Scottish textile manufacturer Alexander Morton. Before establishing Donegal Carpets, Morton had first established a carpet crafting house on the west coast of Ireland and put to practice the techniques of the Donegal people who had been working with wool for generations. The first example of a Donegal carpet with Celtic designs was that carried out for the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for their offices at the Cork Exhibition in 1902. There is another earlier example, a small Celtic- ornamented altar carpet, a Morton's gift to the St Eunan's Cathedral, Letterkenny County, Donegal, which was opened in June 1901. The altar carpet was designed by Signor Oreste Amici, a Roman painter, who carried out the Celtic ornamental painting in the St Columba Chapel in 1900. The Mortons sold the company to a consortium called Donegal Carpets Ltd. in 1957. There were four manufacturing houses at one time in County Donegal but three of the four facilities closed during The Great Depression and in 1987 the last facility closed. Local Donegal people petitioned the government to help re-open them in 1997 and in 1999 they were making carpets again for places such as Áras an Uachtaráin, Dublin Castle and the University of Notre Dame. ==External links== *Carpet factory, Killybegs tourism website *Irish rugs, Nazmiyal collection Category:1898 establishments in Ireland Category:Carpet manufacturing companies Carpets Category:Textile companies of Ireland ","title":"Donegal Carpets"},{"id":"20358518","text":"Katherine Elizabeth \\"Kathy\\" Brookman (also Bates, Merrick, Tate and Glover) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, played by Malandra Burrows. She appeared as a regular character from 1985 until she was axed in 2001 by series producer Steve Frost. She was one of the show's central characters throughout that time. In October 2005 series producer Kathleen Beedles reintroduced the character, when Burrows reprised the role briefly for the funeral of Seth Armstrong (Stan Richards). Kathy currently serves as the twentieth longest serving character in the history of Emmerdale. ==Character development== In July 2005 it was announced that Burrows agreed to reprise her role for the funeral of Seth Armstrong. [...]\\"Burrows was one of the most popular characters on Emmerdale,\\" an insider told the Sunday Mirror, \\"Her return is a huge coup.\\"[...] . In January 2009, it was confirmed that Burrows was too busy to return for the on-screen funeral of Jack Sudgen. In August 2013, it was confirmed that Burrows would not be returning for the on-screen funeral of Alan Turner, she said she wasn't asked back. ==Storylines== Born in 1967, Kathy arrives in Emmerdale with her mother, Caroline (Diana Davies), and brother, Nick (Cy Chadwick), in 1985, following her parents’ separation. Kathy studies for her A-levels but leaves school when Alan Turner (Richard Thorp) gives her a job at NY Estates as a farm worker. She is put in charge of the poultry unit at Home Farm, where thousands of battery hens are reared. Eventually, it becomes too much for her and she quits - which does not surprise Joe Sugden (Frazer Hines), who had advised against her appointment all along. Kathy worked part-time at Emmerdale Farm and, in 1988, set up a farm shop with Dolly Skilbeck (Jean Rogers) and helps make goat's cheese. Kathy, also a horsewoman, additionally looks after Joe and Alan’s horses. Kathy begins a relationship with Jackie Merrick (Ian Sharrock) but they break up temporarily, in 1987, when Kathy begins dating Tony Marchant (Mark Payton), a rich relative of NY boss Christopher Meadows (Conrad Phillips), causing Jackie to smash up Tony's van out of jealousy. Jackie pleads for Kathy to return to him which he does and they reconcile and become engaged. The wedding is nearly ruined when a burst water tank in the Bates’ cottage destroys Kathy’s dress, the night before. The day is saved when Dolly, Caroline and Jackie's grandmother, Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier) alter Annie’s own wedding dress, which her late mother Grace had worn on her wedding to Annie's father, Sam (Toke Townley). Kathy and Jackie marry and go on honeymoon to Tunisia. When the couple return, they move into the attic at Emmerdale Farm and later move into Demdyke Row. They struggle financially due to Jackie's meagre wage, which is supplemented by Kathy's earnings. When their hours clash, Kathy gives up her job as a part-time barmaid at The Woolpack. Kathy falls pregnant but miscarries, due to Chiamydia psittaci, contracted from the sheep. Jackie is later killed in a shooting accident, leaving Kathy devastated. Kathy then takes over Jackie's job as a labourer at the farm, as well as running their own of rented land at Home Farm. For several months Kathy loses interest in everything and only comes out of her shell when she reluctantly joins the cast of Amos Brearly's (Ronald Magill) village production of Dracula, in January 1990. By this time Chris Tate (Peter Amory) was keen on her, but she initially rejects his advances and finds herself at loggerheads with Chris' father: Frank (Norman Bowler), who soon evicts her for missing rent in the third quarter of the previous year. However, Frank eventually approves of Kathy's relationship with Chris; she later becomes friends with Frank's only-daughter and Chris' sister Zoe (Leah Bracknell). One of Chris' drivers, George Starkey, brings news that a cafe owner in Southampton - who was also a medium - had a message from her dead husband, in a bid to win her over. Kathy goes to Southampton, despite much advice not to take such things seriously, but the inconclusive experience sees Kathy decide to get on with her life. Kathy's feelings for Chris grow and they begin a relationship. In April 1990 they sleep together. Their relationship grows stronger when Chris buys Kathy a new car. They marry in 1991 and Frank offers the couple Mill Cottage, as a wedding present, though they insist on paying him for it. Kathy begins applying for a HGV licence, much to Chris' shock. Kathy begins looking after Chris' stepmother Kim's (Claire King) horses and is shocked to discover that Kim is having an affair with Neil Kincaid (Brian Deacon), which puts her in an impossible position and she resigns to help Lynn Whiteley run the wine bar at The Woolpack. In 1993 she has a brief dalliance with American wine rep Josh Lewis and plans to leave Beckindale with Josh but a plane crash occurs in the village. Chris is one of the casualties and is left paralysed. Frank then buys a purpose-built bungalow, to accommodate Chris' needs. Their marriage collapses in 1994 when Chris begins an affair with Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay) and impregnates her. However, Kathy is on hand to assist Rachel when she goes into labour and they rebuild their friendship - becoming best-friends in the process. Following the divorce settlement, Kathy invests the money to buy the old tearooms in the village and begins a relationship with Dave Glover (Ian Kelsey) - who ironically works for the Tates. Dave has a fling with Kim but it fizzles out and they return to Kathy and Frank respectively. Kathy and Dave marry, on 28 November 1996, but Dave dies nearly a month later, on Boxing Day, when he tries to save Kim's son, James, who he believes is his. Kathy is left widowed once again. Kathy later becomes involved with Dave's brother-in- law, Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade) but he jilts her at the altar. Kathy soon becomes a victim in a hit-and-run caused by Kim's second husband Steve Marchant (Paul Opacic), who was in the midst of stealing a horse to save Kim's financial troubles. Kim later manipulates Kathy into believing that Steve was solely behind the horse theft, thus leading Kathy to believe that Steve had intended to kill her without Kim's knowledge; Steve is consequently arrested and Kathy testifies against Steve but soon learns of Kim's involvement, when Chris publicly accuses her of killing Frank. Although Steve is found guilty of Kathy's attempted murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison for the crime, with the addition of serving 12 months each for theft and obtaining money by deception, Kim eludes facing justice for her nefarious activities after escaping the village in a helicopter with James - though not before nearly killing Chris, after attacking him with an ornament. Kathy visits Chris as he recovers and the pair become friends again but Kathy refuses to try out another relationship between them - much to Chris' disappointment. The two are later devastated to learn that Rachel has died. After her funeral Kathy grows close to her former boyfriend, Graham Clark (Kevin Pallister), and they soon begin a relationship. The pair eventually decide to leave the village for a fresh start of their own but things spiral out of control when Kathy discovers that Graham had actually killed Rachel and confronts him about it. This causes Graham to snap and force Kathy to lose control of the car, unwittingly sending them to the edge of the cliff. Kathy manages to escape, just as the car falls down the cliff, but Graham is unable to escape and is killed in the resulting explosion. Kathy's attempt to move on from her trauma with Graham becomes short-lived when she gets involved in a bus accident, when the vehicle is hit by a Tate Haulage company lorry which had run out of control; she survives, while her friend, Butch Dingle (Paul Loughran), is fatally injured and he later passes away in hospital. Kathy mounts a protest against the company but is imprisoned for a short while. When Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby) is arrested for the suspected murder of his estranged wife, Sarah (Alyson Spiro), Kathy moves into the farm to look after the children, Andy (Kelvin Fletcher), Robert (Christopher Smith) and Victoria (Hannah Midgley). Struggling to cope, Kathy nearly has a mental breakdown when Robert and Andy argue incessantly and the herd of cows contracts tuberculosis. Kathy leaves Emmerdale in December 2001 to go to Australia with her niece, Alice Bates (Rachel Tolboys), when Alice's mother Elsa Chappell wants her to emigrate. The following year news reaches Emmerdale that Kathy has since remarried and has given birth to a healthy baby girl. Kathy returns to the village, in 2005, when she accompanies Seth Armstrong (Stan Richards) back to reunite with his long-term companion, Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook). However, Seth dies on the flight back to the UK, so Kathy stays for the funeral, before returning to Australia. Biff also returns for Seth's funeral but he and Kathy do not speak to each other. In December 2006 Alan Turner flies out to Australia and visits Kathy for a month. He visits again during the first half of 2008. When Alan dies, in October 2013, Kathy is unable to attend the funeral and sends flowers. Betty visits Kathy, in Australia, in April 2015. Victoria rings Kathy, in May 2015, to ask how Betty is and when Betty returns later in the month she explains to Victoria how Kathy helped her to email back home. In December 2016 Victoria receives a Christmas card from Betty and she informs Adam Barton (Adam Thomas) that Betty is having Christmas dinner with Kathy. In April 2017 Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock) tells Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) that he will ring Kathy and Betty in Australia, to break the news that Ashley Thomas (John Middleton) has died. In April 2019, following her return, Kim Tate asks Sam Dingle (James Hooton) if Kathy still lives in the village. ==References== Category:Emmerdale characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1985 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Kathy Glover"},{"id":"20358529","text":"Strait Zooism is the fourth and final studio album released by rap group Poison Clan.

The bar has been patronized through the years by many well-known artists, writers and celebrities. In fact, an interesting feature of the bar is that when any celebrity visits, a barstool is added with that patron's name. You will find barstools painted with the names of famous people such as Ernest Hemingway, Truman Capote, Jimmy Buffett, Shel Silverstein, John Prine, and even John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman, among others. Above the sign outside the building is a large Jewfish that Captain Tony caught and had preserved. It is said that if you throw a quarter into the mouth of the fish, good luck will follow you until you leave the island. ==History== The building housing Captain Tony's Saloon has a history as colorful as the town of Key West itself. When first constructed in 1852, 428 Greene Street was an ice house that doubled as the city morgue. In the 1890s, it housed a wireless telegraph station. The telegraph's most important utilization came in 1898, during the Spanish–American War. The battleship Maine was destroyed, as the news came from Havana to Key West and it was reported all over the world from this building. In 1912, the building was home to a cigar factory. Later, it was a bordello and a bar popular with the Navy until it was forced out of business. After that, it became several speakeasies, the last of which was named The Blind Pig, specializing in gambling, women, and bootleg rum. By the 1930s, a local named Josie Russell bought the business and created Sloppy Joe's Bar. This was where Ernest Hemingway spent most of his evenings between 1933 and 1937. In 1938, when the building's landlord raised the rent one dollar per week, Russell and his customers picked up the entire bar and moved everything to Sloppy Joe's current location at 201 Duval Street. The bar then went through several iterations until 1958, when Captain Tony Tarracino, a local charter boat captain, purchased the bar and named it Captain Tony's Saloon. As Captain Tony's, the bar is where Jimmy Buffett got his start in Key West. Buffett played Capt. Tony's in the early '70s, and was often paid in tequila. Buffett immortalized the bar, & Tarracino himself, in his song \\"Last Mango in Paris\\". On occasion, Jimmy will make surprise appearances at the bar, but only performs at his own place around the corner called Margaritaville Cafe. Tarracino sold the bar in 1989, but continued to appear there most Thursdays to greet customers and fans until his death in November 2008.[Life Lessons of a Legend, Brad Manard and Tony Tarracino] ==Popular culture== * The Conch that Roared, Gregory W.

She was introduced to the theatre-going public of London by way of her uncle, Harry Jacobson, a then-popular London orchestra leader and also pianist for Gracie Fields. The apex of her career came with a concert performance with Frances Day at London's Palace Theatre. Her theatre work led to appearances on radio and phonograph records as well as a supporting role in the film Barnacle Bill (1935). Irving Asher, the head of Warner Bros.' London studio, saw Jason's performance in Barnacle Bill and arranged for her to make a screen test for the studio. The test was a success, resulting in Warner Bros. signing her to a contract. Her American film debut came as the lead in Little Big Shot (1935), directed by Michael Curtiz and co-starring Glenda Farrell, Robert Armstrong, and Edward Everett Horton. Jason followed this with supporting roles opposite some of Warner Bros. most popular stars, including Kay Francis in I Found Stella Parish (1935), Al Jolson in The Singing Kid (1936), Pat O'Brien and Humphrey Bogart in The Great O'Malley (1937), and again with Kay Francis in Comet Over Broadway (1938). Warners also starred her in The Captain's Kid (1937), and four Vitaphone two-reelers filmed in Technicolor: Changing of the Guard, A Day at Santa Anita, Little Pioneer, and The Littlest Diplomat. Jason never became the major rival to Shirley Temple that Warner Bros. had hoped, and her film career ended after playing two supporting roles at 20th-Century Fox. These films — The Little Princess (1939) and The Blue Bird (1940) — supported Temple, who became her lifelong friend. ==Personal life== Jason married Anthony Albert Fromlak (aka Anthony Drake) on 30 December 1950. He died in 2005. Their daughter, Toni Maryanna Rossi, is married to Phillip W. Rossi, producer of The New Price Is Right. Sybil Jason became a naturalized United States citizen in 1952.Sybil Jason Fromlak's Petition for Naturalization as a United States Citizen (dated 16 September 1952), #154384, ancestry.com; accessed 14 October 2015. ==Legacy== * Sybil Jason was an active member in the International Al Jolson Society and made frequent appearances at celebrity shows throughout the United States. * Her autobiography My Fifteen Minutes: An Autobiography of a child star of the Golden Era of Hollywood was published in 2004.

Another theme in his work is soft sculpture versions of everyday objects. Many of his works were made in collaboration with his wife, Coosje van Bruggen, who died in 2009; they had been married for 32 years. Oldenburg lives and works in New York. ==Early life and education== Claes Oldenburg was born on January 28, 1929 in Stockholm, the son of Gösta Oldenburg and his wife Sigrid Elisabeth née Lindforss. His father was then a Swedish diplomat stationed in New York and in 1936 was appointed Consul General of Sweden to Chicago where Oldenburg grew up, attending the Latin School of Chicago. He studied literature and art history at Yale UniversityClaes Oldenburg Guggenheim Collection. from 1946 to 1950, then returned to Chicago where he took classes at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While further developing his craft, he worked as a reporter at the City News Bureau of Chicago. He also opened his own studio and, in 1953, became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1956, he moved to New York, and for a time worked in the library of the Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration, where he also took the opportunity to learn more, on his own, about the history of art.\\"Claes Oldenburg.\\" Encyclopedia of World Biography. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1998; later: Gale. Retrieved via Biography in Context database, October 22, 2017. ==Work== Oldenburg's first recorded sales of artworks were at the 57th Street Art Fair in Chicago, where he sold 5 items for a total price of $25.David McCracken, \\"The Art Fair That's Been In the Picture the Longest\\", Chicago Tribune, June 5, 1987, page 3 He moved back to New York City in 1956. There he met a number of artists, including Jim Dine, Red Grooms, and Allan Kaprow, whose happenings incorporated theatrical aspects and provided an alternative to the abstract expressionism that had come to dominate much of the art scene. Oldenburg began toying with the idea of soft sculpture in 1957, when he completed a free- hanging piece made from a woman's stocking stuffed with newspaper. (The piece was untitled when he made it but is now referred to as Sausage.)Kristine McKenna (July 2, 1995), When Bigger Is Better: Claes Oldenburg has spent the past 35 years blowing up and redefining everyday objects, all in the name of getting art off its pedestal Los Angeles Times. By 1960 Oldenburg had produced sculptures containing simply rendered figures, letters and signs, inspired by the Lower East Side neighborhood where he lived, made out of materials such as cardboard, burlap, and newspapers; in 1961 he shifted his method, creating sculptures from chicken wire covered with plaster-soaked canvas and enamel paint, depicting everyday objects - articles of clothing and food items.\\"Claes Oldenburg: On View, Apr 14 - Aug 5, 2013\\". Museum of Modern Art. moma.org. Sections \\"Introduction\\", The Street\\" and \\"The Store\\". Retrieved October 23, 2017. Oldenburg's first show that included three-dimensional works, in May 1959, was at the Judson Gallery, at Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square.Claes Oldenburg, \\"Remembering Judson House,\\" New York: Judson Memorial Church, p. 292 During this time, artist Robert Beauchamp described Oldenburg as \\"brilliant,\\" due to the reaction that the pop artist brought to a \\"dull\\" abstract expressionist period. In the 1960s Oldenburg became associated with the pop art movement and created many so-called happenings, which were performance art related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was \\"Ray Gun Theater\\". The cast of colleagues who appeared in his Performances included artists Lucas Samaras, Tom Wesselmann, Carolee Schneemann, Oyvind Fahlstrom and Richard Artschwager, dealer Annina Nosei, critic Barbara Rose, and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer. His first wife (1960–1970) Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with \\"profound\\" expressions or ideas. But Oldenburg's spirited art found first a niche then a great popularity that endures to this day. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan's Lower East Side to house \\"The Store,\\" a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods. Oldenburg moved to Los Angeles in 1963 \\"because it was the most opposite thing to New York [he] could think of\\". That same year, he conceived AUT OBO DYS, performed in the parking lot of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in December 1963. In 1965 he turned his attention to drawings and projects for imaginary outdoor monuments. Initially these monuments took the form of small collages such as a crayon image of a fat, fuzzy teddy bear looming over the grassy fields of New York's Central Park (1965)Christopher Knight (August 6, 1995), The Percolating Mind of Oldenburg : A retrospective shows how ideas from early in a career can cook for decades, before emerging to enshrine the mundane Los Angeles Times. and Lipsticks in Piccadilly Circus, London (1966).Claes Oldenburg Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 1967, New York city cultural adviser Sam Green realized Oldenburg's first outdoor public monument; Placid Civic Monument took the form of a Conceptual performance/action behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, with a crew of gravediggers digging a 6-by-3-foot rectangular hole in the ground. In 1969, Oldenberg contributed a drawing to the Moon Museum. Geometric Mouse- Scale A, Black 1/6, also from 1969, was selected to be part of the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY. Many of Oldenburg's large-scale sculptures of mundane objects elicited ridicule before being accepted. For example, the 1969 Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks, was removed from its original place in Beinecke Plaza at Yale University, and \\"circulated on a loan basis to other campuses\\". With its \\"bright color, contemporary form and material and its ignoble subject, it attacked the sterility and pretentiousness of the classicistic building behind it.\\" The artist \\"pointed out it opposed levity to solemnity, color to colorlessness, metal to stone, simple to asophisticated tradition. In theme, it is both phallic, life-engendering, and a bomb, the harbinger of death. Male in form, it is female in subject...\\" One of a number of sculptures that have interactive capabilities, it now resides in the Morse College courtyard. From the early 1970s Oldenburg concentrated almost exclusively on public commissions. His first public work, Three-Way Plug came on commission from Oberlin College with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. His collaboration with Dutch/American writer and art historian Coosje van Bruggen dates from 1976. Their first collaboration came when Oldenburg was commissioned to rework Trowel I, a 1971 sculpture of an oversize garden tool, for the grounds of the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, the Netherlands.Carol Kino (January 13, 2009), Coosje van Bruggen, Sculptor, Dies at 66 The New York Times. Oldenburg has officially signed all the work he has done since 1981 with both his own name and van Bruggen's. In 1988, the two created the iconic Spoonbridge and Cherry sculpture for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis that remains a staple of the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden as well as a classic image of the city. Typewriter Eraser, Scale X (1999) is in the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden. Another well known construction is the Free Stamp in downtown Cleveland. In addition to freestanding projects, they occasionally contributed to architectural projects, among them, two Los Angeles projects in collaboration with architect Frank Gehry: Toppling Ladder With Spilling Paint, which was installed at Loyola Law School in 1986, and the building-mounted sculpture Giant Binoculars, completed in Venice in 1991. The couple's collaboration with Gehry also involved a return to performance for Oldenburg when the trio presented Il Corso del Coltello, in Venice, Italy, in 1985; other characters were portrayed by Germano Celant and Pontus Hultén.Claes Oldenburg: Props, Costumes and Designs for the Performance \\"Il Corso del Coltello\\", January 9 – February 13, 1988 Margo Leavin Gallery, Los Angeles. \\"Coltello\\" is the source of Knife Ship, a large-scale sculpture that served as the central prop; it was later seen in Los Angeles in 1988 when Oldenburg, Van Bruggen and Gehry presented Coltello Recalled: Reflections on a Performance at the Japanese American Cultural & Community Center and the exhibition Props, Costumes and Designs for the Performance \\"Il Corso del Coltello\\" at Margo Leavin Gallery. In 2001, Oldenburg and van Bruggen created Dropped Cone, a huge inverted ice cream cone, on top of a shopping center in Cologne, Germany. Installed at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 2011, Paint Torch is a towering 53 feet high pop sculpture of a paintbrush, capped with bristles that are illuminated at night. The sculpture is installed at a daring 60-degree angle, as if in the act of painting. ==Exhibitions== Claes Oldenburg in Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1970) Oldenburg's first one-man show in 1959, at the Judson Gallery in New York, had shown figurative drawings and papier-mâché sculptures. He was honored with a solo exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet (organized by Pontus Hultén), in 1966; the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1969; London's Tate Gallery in 1970 (chronicled in a 1970 twin-projection documentary by James Scott called The Great Ice Cream Robbery); and with a retrospective organized by Germano Celant at the Solomon R.

In her 16-minute, 16mm film Manhattan Mouse Museum (2011), artist Tacita Dean captured Oldenburg in his studio as he gently handles and dusts the small objects that line his bookshelves. The film is less about the artist's iconography than the embedded intellectual process that allows him to transform everyday objects into remarkable sculptural forms.Tacita Dean: Five Americans, May 6 – July 1, 2012 New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York. ==Personal life== Patty Mucha was Oldenburg's first wife, from 1960 to 1970, first met Claes Oldenburg in after she moved to New York in 1957 to become an artist.

His sire was imported British stallion Royal Charger, a son of Nearco, which Thoroughbred Heritage says was \\"one of the greatest racehorses of the Twentieth Century\\". Mongo's dam was Accra, Ms. Du Pont Scott's foundation mare, who produced at least seven other winners including the three-time American Champion Steeplechase Horse Neji. ==Racing career== Frank Bonsal, a former jockey in steeplechase racing, conditioned Mongo for racing. As a three-year-old in 1962, the colt won important races on turf under jockey Charlie Burr. He notably won the Lexington Handicap, the first of two consecutive runnings of both the United Nations Handicap and the Trenton Handicap. The following year was Mongo's most successful. On November 11, he met the reigning American Horse of the Year Kelso, as well as challengers from France, Ireland, Hungary, Venezuela, and Russia in the Washington, D.C. International Stakes. The race evolved into a match between Mongo and Kelso throughout the last half-mile. On the line, Mongo prevailed by half a length, but his win was only confirmed after the track stewards rejected a claim of interference brought by Ismael Valenzuela, the rider of the runner-up. As a result of his successes, Mongo was voted the 1963 American Champion Male Turf Horse. Mongo also raced successfully at age five. He defeated Kelso again to win the 1964 Monmouth Handicap, defeated the outstanding runner Gun Bow in the John B. Campbell Handicap, and set a new Monmouth Park track record in winning the Trenton Handicap for the second time. ==Stud career== Retired to stud at Blue Ridge Farm near Upperville, Virginia, Mongo met with modest success. While none of his progeny met with his level of racing success, Mongo sired some good runners, including: * Mongongo (1969) - winner of multiple stakes races including the Salvator Mile Handicap * Bushongo (1971) - won Flamingo Stakes * Commadore C. (1976) - Long Branch Stakes winner * Mongo Queen (b. 1976) - won Sorority Stakes Mongo died at age 24 on March 21, 1983, at Blue Ridge Farm. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1959 racehorse births Category:1983 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Virginia Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Du Pont racehorses Category:American Champion racehorses Category:Thoroughbred family 21-a ","title":"Mongo (horse)"},{"id":"20358779","text":"The Tocklai Tea Research Institute (formerly Tocklai Experimental Station of Tea Research) was established in 1911, at a site near the River Tocklai in Jorhat, Assam, India. The initial construction of a laboratory and two bungalows was funded by the tea industry, subsidised by the national government of India, and the Indian states of Assam and Bengal. The beginning of a new era of tea research in India was marked by the establishment of the Scientific Department of Indian Tea Association (ITA) in the year 1900. This was consolidated with the creation of the Tocklai Experimental Station in 1911. The formation of the Tea Research Association (TRA) in 1964 with Tocklai at the centre of all activities further expanded the horizon of tea research to cover the entire Northeast India. Research on all aspects of tea cultivation and processing is carried out at the Tocklai Tea Research Institute, Jorhat, the oldest and the largest research station of its kind in the world. Apart from research on various aspects of tea cultivation and processing, the research on tissue culture of modern tea and its medicinal benefits are also being carried out here. Transfer of technology to its member estates is carried out through its advisory network covering 1,076 tea estates occupying of land spread over The South Bank, North Bank, Upper Assam, Cachar, Tripura, Dooars, Darjeeling and Terai.

Until 1987 its major shareholder was Caledonia Investments, which since 1951 has been controlled by Clan Line's founding Cayzer family. British & Commonwealth were the ultimate owners of British United Airways (BUA), Britain's largest wholly private, independent airline of the 1960s, as well as its subsidiaries and sister companies, including British United Air Ferries and British United Island Airways (BUIA). They were also a shareholder of Bristow Helicopters, at the time the UK's biggest helicopter company as well as one of the largest in the world,High Risk: The Politics of the Air, pp. 256/7 acquiring full control in 1985. In 1969 British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness Withy, P&O; and The Ocean Steamship Company established Overseas Containers Limited to exploit containerisation. In late 1970 British & Commonwealth sold BUA along with three new BAC One-Eleven 500 aircraft it had leased to the airline to Caledonian Airways for £12m. It continued to own BUIA, which had changed its name to British Island Airways (BIA) in July 1970. ==1980s boom and bust== In the 1980s, new management under John Gunn oversaw rapid expansion in financial services.

Multiple acquisitions included Exco International, a UK money brokering business in 1986,Chairman is appointed at Exco International New York Times, 8 January 1987 and Oppenheimer, a large American fund management company. At its height, the company was said to be \\"the largest financial services company in the UK, if the 4 high-street banks are excluded\\". Favourable profiles in the business press culminated in John Gunn being awarded the accolade \\"Guardian Young Businessman of the Year\\". In 1988 it acquired Atlantic Computers plc, a computer services business for £434m, having first built up a stake in that company by way of a series of market purchases. The acquisition proved ruinous – \\"accounting irregularities\\" were discovered in Atlantic's books: the company had been building up huge contingent liabilities due to its 'Extended Paperwork' practice. Both acquiror and acquiree subsequently went into administration (the former in 1990, the latter during the late 1990s).

It is connected with the Oasis at the Gold Spike, a 50-room three floor hotel located in downtown Las Vegas. It was owned by entrepreneur Tony Hsieh and his Downtown Project, having bought it from The Siegel Group; and the casino was operated by Golden Gaming. Hsieh closed the casino on April 14, 2013. After a three- week remodel, Gold Spike re-opened the casino as a restaurant and bar on May 6, 2013. The hotel portion of the building was recently converted into permanent and temporary workforce housing for Downtown Project, entrepreneurs, and Zappos; Oasis hotel is a separate building on the same property.http://recode.net/2014/09/30/the-gold-spike-welcome-to-your- entrepreneur-dorm/ ==HistoryRendezvous (1976-85)=== It originally opened in 1976 as the 112-room Rendezvous, owned by the 76 Corporation. In 1983 Jackie Gaughan purchased the property after it had been closed for several months. ===Gold Spike Hotel & Casino (1985-2013)=== The Gold Spike for years has been known as an inexpensive hotel with few amenities. On December 6, 2002, Gaughan agreed to sell the Gold Spike and three other casinos to Barrick Gaming. This sale, along with several other downtown Las Vegas hotel/casinos, was completed in 2004, for a combined total of about $82 million. Barrick Gaming Corp was in partnership with Tamares Group. After the purchase, management discontinued the table games and only offered slot machines. In a few years the property was offered for sale. Remodeling of the bar after its purchase by Hsieh On July 23, 2007, Greg Covin bought the property for $15.6 million with the intention of turning it into a boutique hotel. He sold it on February 4, 2008 for $21 million to The Siegel Group. The Siegel Group set out to completely renovate the property and combine it with an old and forgotten 52-room motel located next to the property. As one author wrote, the Gold Spike now has \\"Quartz walls, tile floors, wood accents, and new everything\\", making it \\"a very modern boutique hotel in the heart of downtown\\". The first floor, containing the gaming floor, the bar, and the restaurant, was completely renovated by February 2009. By April 2010, all guest floors and the exterior of the hotel has been completely remodeled and renovated. In May 2010, the Oasis Pool opened, giving Gold Spike a swimming pool. In April 2013, it was reported that the property's debt had been acquired by Tony Hsieh's Downtown Project, a campaign to revitalize downtown Las Vegas. ===Casino closure === Siegel then announced that it had sold the Gold Spike to the Downtown Project, and that the casino would close on April 14. Siegel retained rights to the Gold Spike name, and said that the company needed to dispose of smaller properties on its way to owning larger casinos on the Strip. Hsieh was reported to be considering several ideas for the property, including a boutique hotel, specialty retail space, or a club, but ruled out a casino, saying that he was \\"trying to help build a community\\". In 2014, Gold Spike reopened the former casino area as a bar and lounge with social games. Gold Spike renovated its top floor into a penthouse suite for the thirty-first season of the MTV television series Real World, Real World: Go Big or Go Home. This suite can now be rented by the public and it is in the Gold Spike property and not The Oasis.http://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/tv/the- real-world-officially-returned-las-vegas-today ==Oasis at The Gold Spike== The adjacent 3-story motel was originally built in 1962 as a 57-room Travel Inn Motel. The property was abandoned, becoming a blight between the Fremont Street Experience and Las Vegas City Hall. The Siegel Group purchased this property in August 2007 for $5 million and started making plans to renovate it and reopen the property. Plans were put on hold when they purchased the neighboring Gold Spike. Finally, by April 2010, the rooms had been completely renovated and renamed \\"The Oasis at The Gold Spike\\" and connected to the Gold Spike via an outdoor lounge and walkway. http://siegelcompanies.com/newsroom/siegel-group-brings-boutique-chic- retreats-las-vegas/ After a reconfiguration of the property, it was left with 50-rooms, which have been modernized and turned into bungalow suites. The Oasis at the Gold Spike had the distinction of being the only downtown hotel with a Las Vegas Blvd. address. In May 2010, the City of Las Vegas changed the entire Gold Spike property to this address. ==References * Category:Buildings and structures in Las Vegas Category:Hotels established in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in Nevada Category:Downtown Las Vegas Category:Defunct casinos in the Las Vegas Valley ","title":"Gold Spike (property)"},{"id":"20358876","text":"Vujičić () is a Serbian surname, a patronymic derived from Vujič or Vujica, hypocoristics of the given name Vuk (meaning \\"wolf\\").

That same year he moved to Athens to attend university, but left after a year to take a series of jobs as a clerk in various businesses. In 1937 he began a thirty-year career in the Greek Civil Service, also seeing combat service in the Greco-Italian War during this period. In 1967 he responded to the takeover of Greece by a military dictatorship by going into self-imposed exile in Switzerland and Italy, where he remained until returning to Greece in 1974.Friar, Kimon, Modern Greek Poetry, (Efstathiadis Group S.A., 1993), p. 316.The Charioteer: An Annual Review of Modern Greek Culture.

Nikephoros Vretttakos was considered one of Greece's most important poets. He won a number of prizes and medals, including the Greek State Poetry Prize twice. Some of his poems became popular songs in musical settings by Greek composers, including Mikis Theodorakis. His verse was also translated into many languages. He was also elected as a member of the Academy of Athens in 1987. Vrettakos died in Athens. ==Works== Greek text: *Τά ποιήματα (ed.

This appeal was successfully conveyed with this live album, indicated by its number 2 chart position and receiving a gold album award. The Trio was a carefully rehearsed act, the jokes and introductions to songs planned, delivered and also graded by their manager Frank Werber. Gilmore recorded two nights of the group's twenty-seven-day engagement at the club.

Despite being right-footed, his natural position is left back; however, he's comfortable playing in both flanks of the defence. Roubakis spent the majority of his career at Crete-based clubs, with a brief six-month spell at Panathinaikos in Athens. He has appeared in over 200 Greek first division matches and he is one of the few footballers who have played for each of the three big clubs of Heraklion; OFI Crete, Ergotelis and Atsalenios. ==Playing careerEarly career=== Roubakis was born in Heraklion, Crete and started his career at the youth academy of Atsalenios in 1994. In 1998, he made his debut with the first team in a Delta Ethniki match against AO Chalkida and since then he was considered an indispensable member of the local Heraklion club. He scored 4 goals for Atsalenios in the 2000–01 Delta Ethniki. ===First tenure at OFI Crete=== In December 2001, Roubakis signed a 4-year contract with OFI Crete in the Alpha Ethniki; however, he joined his new club in January 2002, as Atsalenios needed him to play in 4 additional Delta Ethniki matches. He made his league debut on 3 February 2002, in an away match against Ethnikos Asteras which OFI won 3–2, coming as a substitute for Manolis Dermitzakis in the 75th minute. By the time Roubakis left OFI three years later, he made a total of 58 league appearances for the club and scored the winning goal in a 2–1 away victory against Aris on 28 September 2003. ===Move to Panathinaikos=== In January 2005, Roubakis was transferred to Panathinaikos FC for a reported fee of about 200K Euros and he signed a contract until summer 2009. This move was welcomed as a \\"dream come true\\" by the player, himself reporting that Panathinaikos was the club he supported as a child – however, the fans of OFI had a different opinion, accusing OFI's board of dishonesty, as (according to the fans) the board members promised they would not sell Roubakis to Panathinaikos during the winter transfer period. Roubakis never met Panathinaikos's expectations during his time there and only made 4 league appearances until the end of the 2004–05 season. Despite being eligible to play at the UEFA Cup, Roubakis was the only newcomer to not be registered for Panathinaikos' round of 32 match for the 2004–05 UEFA Cup against Sevilla CF. Moreover, after his fourth (and last) appearance for Panathinaikos on 27 February 2005 in a home match against Kerkyra, Roubakis was booed from the crowd due to his poor performance – he was substituted in the 51st minute by Panathinaikos manager Zdeněk Ščasný and never used again. ===Return to OFI Crete=== Roubakis was eventually released from Panathinaikos and returned to OFI in July 2005, signing a two-year contract. He made 25 appearances in the 2005–06 Alpha Ethniki, a season which ended with mixed feelings for the team, as the top-half favorites only escaped relegation during the league's final matchdays. After OFI's disappointing previous season, Roubakis vowed to never repeat the team's poor performance and he set the goal towards continental qualification for the following 2006–07 season. Roubakis scored a goal 46 seconds after kick-off in an away game against Iraklis and contributed to another goal in the same match, which ended in a 3–2 victory for OFI. He scored another goal on 17 March 2007 in an away game against Egaleo, after an assist by Joseph Nwafor. Roubakis finished the season with 26 appearances, with OFI qualifying for the 2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup after PAOK's refusal to take part in it. Before the start of the 2007–08 season, Roubakis was linked to newly promoted Beta Ethniki champions Asteras Tripoli, but a move did not materialize – instead, he voted by his OFI teammates as third captain behind Goran Drulić and Pierre Issa. However, there was no smooth sailing both for OFI manager Reiner Maurer and Roubakis after a bad start in the league, with OFI fans demanding the resignation of the former and contempting the latter for poor performance and for joining rival Panathinaikos three years before. Despite this, Roubakis managed to make 25 appearances for the club during that season. In 2008, Roubakis, after seven years at OFI and continuous appearances in the first team, was considered a key player for yet another season. Until the end of the 2008–09 Superleague he earned 22 appearances to his name as well as OFI's only red cards for the season during 2 home matches against AEK Athens and Panathinaikos; however, OFI was relegated from the first division for the first time in 33 years. ===Ergotelis=== Roubakis signed a two-year contract with Ergotelis in July 2009. During his first season with Ergotelis, the club's manager Nikos Karageorgiou switched Roubakis' natural left back position to a defensive midfielder one, as he was trying to support fellow defensive midfielder Manoel Júnior – both coped well, leading the championship's steal charts. Roubakis finished the 2009–10 season with 24 appearances to his name, 23 of which as a starter, with Ergotelis itself narrowly avoiding relegation. Roubakis was a regular starter at the club during the 2010–11 season as well, however a bad performance during a 1–4 home defeat against Panathinaikos briefly put teammate Tomasz Wisio in contention of the left back position. Despite that, Roubakis appeared in 26 league matches for Ergotelis for a grand total of 2226 minutes, and played his 200th first division match against Olympiakos Volou. Roubakis did not fit the plans of his manager, Nikos Karageorgiou, for the following season and as his contract was expiring in June 2011, he was released from the club. ===Rouvas=== After his Ergotelis contract was terminated, Roubakis struggled to find a suitable Greek or Cypriot club that would employ him – a return to Atsalenios in the Delta Ethniki or an early retirement were on the table. Finally in late January 2012, after months of inactivity, he signed a six- month contract for Gergeri-based Rouvas FC, a capture which was considered magnificent for a Football League 2 club. He made 12 league appearances for the club in the 2011–12 Football League 2 and scored two goals – one with an inswinging cross in a match against Kalamata and another against PAO Rouf. ===Episkopi=== In July 2012, Roubakis joined another Cretan football club, Rethymno-based Episkopi, which became Delta Ethniki Group 10 champions in 2012 and was promoted to the Football League 2 for the first time in history. In Episkopi, he reunited with former OFI teammate Thanasis Kolitsidakis, who was working there as the club's manager – however, despite 18 league appearances and the club gaining promotion to the following season's Football League, Roubakis did not renew his contract and was released on June 2013. ===Second spell at Rouvas=== Roubakis found himself a free agent yet again, and during the summer transfer period of 2013 he was rumored to join a number of clubs, but instead he decided to return to Rouvas one year after his departure. The previous year Rouvas had come from a successful Football League 2 campaign and expectations for this season were high – Roubakis himself made 22 appearances and scored 2 goals at the 2013–14 Football League 2 but could not help Rouvas avoid relegation to the local Heraklion championships as they only managed to finish 9th in Group 5. Roubakis was subsequently released from the club. ===Return to Atsalenios=== In July 2014, then 35-year-old Roubakis returned to his childhood club Atsalenios after 12 years. By that point, Atsalenios was playing at the A1 League of the Heraklion FCA championships (4th-tier level of Greek football) and his motivation was to help the club return to national level, as well as end his football career there – Atsalenios were also hoping for Roubakis to mentor the club's younger footballers with his experience and personality. Ultimately Atsalenios fell short of their goals in the league department as they were eliminated from the promotion play-offs after a surprise 3–1 semi-final defeat by underdogs Doxa Galia, but they managed to win the 2014–15 Heraklion FCA Cup with a 1–0 victory against Moires at the final; Roubakis gave the assist for the winning goal with a pinpoint cross. Atsalenions renewed the contract of Roubakis at the buildup of the 2015–16 season, with the club considering him a valuable asset for their promotion battle. Atsalenios managed to stay undefeated during the group stage of the 2015–16 A1 League and during the promotion group stage they managed to earn ten victories without conceding a single goal; this earned them the A1 Heraklion FCA championship – at the end, Atsalenios won the Crete Champions play-off stage and were therefore promoted to the following season's Football League 2. Roubakis himself was key to Atsalenios' success as him and forward Tasos Triantafyllou made a formiddable pair, with Roubakis getting assists and Triantafyllou scoring goals; in fact the latter became the league's top scorer with 28 goals and Roubakis getting one goal and 3 assists at the Crete champions stage alone and a total of 8 goals in the league overall. Despite his advancing age, Roubakis vowed to help Atsalenios with the club's return to the Greek national leagues at the best of his abilities and aim for as high of a league position as possible at the 2016–17 Football League 2 – he was therefore awarded yet another contract extension. He contributed to Atsalenios' second consecutive Heraklion Super Cup victory with an assist at a 2–1 victory in the final against Irodotos. ==Outside football== On 7 November 2010, still a player of Ergotelis at the time, Roubakis was a candidate for the municipal council of Heraklion at the 2010 Greek local elections – he gathered 1054 votes in the 4th administrative division of the city but did not win a seat. ==References * *Profile at Guardian.co.uk *Profile at Onsports.gr Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Greek footballers Category:Super League Greece players Category:OFI Crete F.C. players Category:Panathinaikos F.C. players Category:Ergotelis F.C. players Category:Sportspeople from Crete Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football midfielders Category:People from Heraklion ","title":"Manolis Roubakis"},{"id":"20359198","text":"Parsigutta is an area in Secunderabad, Telangana, India.

The story revolves around two brothers (Jake Cuenca and Gerald Anderson) who share the same name, the same aspirations, and the same lady-of-interest (Kim Chiu). The title of the series was taken from one of Rey Valera’s classic songs, in a manner similar to most Filipino soap operas. ==Plot summary== David \\"JR\\" Garcia Jr. was born into a poor family. His father, David Sr., deserted his mother Marlene before he was born because his wife, Ingrid Garcia is pregnant with David \\"Dave\\" Garcia Jr. When Audrey King and her family goes to Tagaytay for a visit, she falls from a set of high stairs. JR saves her life and introduces himself as David Garcia Jr. after she asks for his name. When she gets to the hospital and is asked by the witnesses and her family who saved her, she says it's David Garcia Jr. - but Dave is given the credit instead of JR. As Audrey grows up falling in love with Dave, Dave meets JR and they become the best of friends, but their families do not approve of their friendship. Dave's family thinks JR wants to use Dave just for the money. The siblings' mothers would not let the two hang out, although Dave's father allowed the friendship to continue. Dave's grandmother, Elizabeth, and JR's mother, Marlene, suspects David Sr is keeping the two boys' friendship alive. Audrey's father, Stanley Sr., sends her to Cebu to continue her studies. JR and Audrey have a chance encounter in the airport. Dave and JR enter the Philippine Military Academy where they graduate at the top of their class. The family rivalry becomes worse as everyone finds out that Dave and JR are half-siblings when David Sr. appears on graduation day. Elizabeth exerts all efforts to cover up the truth to the point that she engineers Marlene's imprisonment. Things become even worse as David Sr. dies from a gunshot wound by gun smuggling boss Leo Cardenas during a robbery on his armory on the suggestion of Ramon Lecumberri, JR and Dave's estranged older half-brother. It would be followed by more events such as the death of Audrey's mother Loretta, Ramon killing Leo to save Lola Gets and taking over the syndicate, and the involvement of Audrey's younger brother Stan in Ramon's syndicate. Further DNA testing confirms that Dave and JR are twins. As things develop, Stanley kills Elizabeth over a financial dispute and frames JR, who is imprisoned and escapes with a former enemy, Ka Doroy, as part of a double agent operation with the military in order to infiltrate the syndicate. He discovers that the syndicate's boss, \\"Hunyango\\", is actually Marlon Cardenas, Dave's godfather and Leo's father. After JR is hit in a later incident, Dave agrees to a kidney transplant to save his twin in exchange for a civil wedding to Audrey, but the marriage turns out to be fake because of Mamita's machinations. Dave and Audrey plan a church wedding, but Dave backs out. Audrey ends up marrying JR in church and later bears him a son named Adrian. However, she dies of heart disease a few days after giving birth. The brothers eventually face off in a final showdown with Ramon, who agrees to surrender after Marlene's appeals and completing a plan to bring down his syndicate. However, a mentally-insane Ingrid shoots Ramon in the head while being taken into custody. He survives the shooting but doctors said the bullets rendered him blind. Dave later commits Ingrid to a psychiatric hospital. Ramon is sentenced to life imprisonment and makes amends with Marlene, JR, and Dave behind bars. The three, who visit Ramon from time to time, now live together with Robert, Adrian, Ula, Angela and Lily. The story ends with a cliffhanger: a woman and her son appears at the Garcia house one evening. They introduce themselves as Emma Garcia (a third wife of David Garcia Sr.) and David \\"Anthony\\" Garcia III. ==Cast and characters Main cast === * Jake Cuenca as Lt. David \\"Dave\\" M.

It was sung by soldiers during the Spanish–American War of 1898, when flies and the yellow fever mosquito were a serious enemy. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album Join Bing and Sing Along (1959). Today, it is commonly sung by children, and has been recorded on many children's records, including Disney Children's Favorite Songs 3, performed by Larry Groce and the Disneyland Children's Sing-Along Chorus. ==Composition== The song's origin was reported in an anonymously written 1895 New York Herald article on the history of minstrel show dancing. That article credits a female Afro-Caribbean singer with bringing \\"Shoo Fly\\" to the U.S., where it was adopted and altered by various blackface performers: \\"'Shoo-Fly' is said to have come originally from the Isthmus of Panama, where the negroes sang 'Shoo Fly' and 'Don't Bodder Me' antiphonally while at their work. A negro from there, Helon Johnson, took it first to California and taught the song to 'Billy' Birch [a performer with the San Francisco Minstrels troupe]. ‘Dick’ Carroll and others also had versions of it which they performed. Delehanty and Hengler had theirs, too, and used to sing it as an encore with Bryant’s Minstrels, slipping on old dresses over their heads in the interim of the score. It was from hearing them that ‘Dave’ [Reed] and ‘Dan’ [Bryant] fancied he song. ‘Dave’ fixed it up with a dance, and original version thereof. It was rehearsed secretly, and when the time came they ‘sprang it’ on ‘the boys’ of the company one evening in public, with ‘Come and Kiss Me’ as an encore. It was a howling success from the start, and ‘Dan’ Bryant had printed the next day at the Herald office twenty thousand notices, which he gave to the company and others to scatter about the town wherever they went. Horse shoes with a fly on them were put in odd and conspicuous places, even on the telegraph wires, and in no time the public was crazy over the act and 'business was great.' E.M. Hall has a version with a more elaborate and an excellent chorus, ending 'Shoo Fly, &c.;, \\"Go 'way, fly, I'll cut your wing.”' New York Herald, August 11, 1895, Section Four, p. 2. https://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201895/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201895%20-%204814.pdf. Despite multiple competing claims to composition of \\"Shoo Fly,\\" it does seem Bryant's Minstrels, as described in the Herald account, was the first group to popularize the song, in 1869-70.Cropsey, Eugene H. Crosby's Opera House: symbol of Chicago's cultural awakening, p. 270 (1999) \\"Shoo Fly\\" is among the songs (\\"John Brown's Body\\" is another) claimed as compositions by T. Brigham Bishop. According to Bishop's account, he wrote \\"Shoo Fly, Don't Bother Me\\" during the Civil War while assigned to command a company of black soldiers. One of the soldiers, dismissing some remarks of his fellow soldiers, exclaimed \\"Shoo fly, don't bother me,\\" which inspired Bishop to write the song, including in the lyrics the unit's designation, \\"Company G\\". Bishop claimed that the song was \\"pirated\\" from him, and that he made little money from it.(8 November 1905). The Author of \\"Shoo Fly\\", Reading Eagle (stating that T. Allston Brown, had vouched for this account) Bishop published a sheet music version of the song in 1869 (White, Smith & Perry). That version includes the caption, \\"Original Copy and Only Authorized Edition.\\"Shoo Fly, Duke University library collection Other sources have credited Billy Reeves (lyrics) and Frank Campbell, or Rollin Howard, with the song.The blue book of Tin Pan Alley, p. 9 (1965) An early publication appeared as \\"Shew!

Her reign began on July 26, 2008, and ended 22 days before she died. ==Miss Swaziland== After being crowned Miss Swaziland she complained to her friend that as soon as she won she was told she would have to pay all her expenses herself, including the cost of her dress, to travel to the Miss World pageant. This was a great sticking point between her and the contest sponsors and organizers. The organizers reported their own disappointments with Simelane, disclosing that she would \\"disappear without a trace\\", causing more controversy. In an interview with the Times of Swaziland she thanked God that her reign was over, stating she thought she was \\"going crazy\\" and that the title had been nothing more than a liability to her. When she relinquished her crown at a ceremony in the Royal Swazi Convention Centre, she gave a cryptic speech, revealing that becoming Miss Swaziland had opened her eyes and that she had hoped to remove the cloud of controversy around the competition during her reign. She then claimed that the competition was not being run in the correct fashion, but that her conscience was clear. ==Death== On August 17, 2009, Simelane committed suicide by ingesting weevil tablet, a pesticide that contains aluminium phosphide and emits phosphine gas. She rushed for treatment at the Mbabane Government Hospital. Friends reported that she killed herself over a \\"broken heart\\", facing depression and a lack of closeness with her family on top of the stress of being Miss Swaziland. == References  External links == * Category:1988 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Female suicides Category:Suicides by poison Category:Suicides in Eswatini Category:Miss World 2008 delegates Category:Swazi beauty pageant winners ","title":"Tiffany Simelane"},{"id":"20359257","text":"Agrupación Deportiva Orcasitas is a Spanish football team from Usera district, Madrid.

Jeanne was born on 10 November 1433 at Auray, Brittany, the daughter of Guy XIV de Laval, Count of Laval and Isabella of Brittany. Her paternal grandparents were Jean de Montfort (who following the dispositions in his marriage contract took the name and arms of the Laval family, assuming the name to Guy XIII of Laval) and Anne de Laval (daughter and heiress of Guy XII de Laval), and her maternal grandparents were John V, Duke of Brittany, and Jeanne of France (daughter of King Charles VI of France and Isabeau of Bavaria). Her father Guy fought with Joan of Arc. His eldest son Francis de Laval, a Grand Master of France, would succeed him as Guy XV, Count of Laval. He had another two sons by his first wife Isabelle, Pierre de Laval and Jean de Laval. Including Jeanne, he had a total of seven daughters, two of them died in early infancy. By his second wife, Françoise de Dinan, he had three sons. == Marriage == Portrait of René of Anjou and Jeanne de Laval, by Nicolas Froment. A marriage contract was drawn up on 3 September 1454 between Jeanne's father and King René of Naples and Sicily. The wedding was celebrated on 10 September 1454, at the Abbey of St. Nicholas in Angers. At the age of twenty-one Jeanne married René, whose first wife, Isabella of Lorraine, had died the previous year. Jeanne's husband was more than twenty years her senior. The marriage, however, was happy. Jeanne, who was sweet and affectionate, seems to have been much loved by her husband. She became stepmother to René's children, who included the future John II, Duke of Lorraine, Margaret of Anjou, and Yolande, Duchess of Lorraine. Jeanne's marriage to René was childless. After living three years in the surrounding mansions of Angers and Saumur, the king and queen lived in Provence in 1457 to 1462, in Anjou from 1462 to 1469. In Aix-en-Provence, Angers, she participated with her husband in literary and scholarly pursuits at his court. René composed a 10,000 verse ode to Jeanne entitled, \\"The Idyl of Regnault and Jeanneton\\". The poem was a debate on love between a shepherd and shepherdess with a pilgrim as arbiter. However, it sometimes seems to contain a good dose of conventional fiction. During his stay at Tarascon in Provence, René granted Jeanne the barony of Les Baux, which belonged to the Counts of Provence. She exchanged it on 18 February 1475 at Aix-en-Provence for Berre.Charles Cawley. Medieval Lands, Anjou She continued to live in Provence from 1469 to 1480. ==Later life== Detail of the Burning Bush triptych, which shows Jeanne de Laval and René I of Anjou. René died on 10 July 1480. In his will, he bequeathed his wife a very large income in Anjou, Provence, and the Barrois. She also retained the County of Beaufort and the lordship of Mirebeau (exchanged with the baronies of Aubagne and Provence). After her husband's death, she sometimes lived in Beaufort and sometimes in Saumur. She was popular for her kindness and generosity. The people of Beaufort were grateful to her when she regulated the use of common pastures. Jeanne died on 19 December 1498 at the Chateau de Beaufort-en-Vallée, Maine- et-Loire. She was sixty-five years of age. A street still bears her name, \\"Queen of Sicily.\\" By her will, she wished to be buried simply, without any monument, in the cathedral of Angers. Her heart was placed in the Cordeliers d'Angers, alongside that of her husband. ==Jeanne and the arts== Jeanne and her husband René appears in the triptych of the Burning Bush of the cathedral of Aix-en-Provence, painted by Nicolas Froment, and a painting in the museum of Cluny, where she is represented with King René listening to the preaching of Sainte-Madeleine. Jeanne used the Burning Bush triptych to illuminate a psalter (ms. 41 of the Public Library of Poitiers). The Cabinet of medals of the National Library of France has two medals, the 'King René and Queen Jeanne dating from 1462. It consists of a miniature of Jeanne, surrounded by her ladies, in the manuscript of the French version of the Pilgrimage of Life (in the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal). Monuments to Jeanne have been raised in Beaufort (1842), Rosiers-d'Égletons (1875), and Tarascon. A statue of Jeanne can be seen in the \\"Public Garden\\" in the Noisay village in Indre-et-Loire. ==AncestrySources== *Accounts of John Legay, fundraiser for the Queen of Sicily, the manuscript of the library of Angers, published in the History Anjou in 1900. *King Lecoy by René de la Marche. *Conduct of King René J.

The PZL.49 was based on the contemporary PZL.37 Łoś and was to replace it at production lines at the PZL works. ==Design== The PZL.49 was a development of the advanced, \\"state-of-the-art\\" medium bomber PZL.37 Łoś, designed by Jerzy Dąbrowski, Stanisław Kot and Piotr Kubicki. About 50% of its design elements were taken from PZL.37 Łoś bomber to simplify the design process. The main target for the design team was to increase performance, especially flight speed, by means of installing more powerful engines and improving aerodynamics. Its standard 2,200 kg (4,900 lb) bomb load could be increased to 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) by decreasing its fuel load. Its standard 2,200 km (1,200 nmi) range could be increased to 3,000 km (1,900 nmi) with additional fuel tanks. Detailed project was ready in mid-1938 and a report by General Józef Zając from 28 November 1938 stated that all drawings were complete. Design process was slow due to the simultaneous involvement of PZL construction bureau in development of the PZL.50 Jastrząb fighter. During the summer of 1939, a mock-up of the PZL.49 was approved by the Air Force and project could be continued. Due to the engagement of Jerzy Dąbrowski in PZL.62 development, Piotr Kubicki became the leader of the PZL.49 design team. In late 1938 or early 1939 production of parts for two prototypes begun in Wytwórnia Płatowców nr 1 of PZL factory (PZL WP-2). In early 1939 a full-scale mock-up of fuselage with part of the left wing was built for testing placement of cockpit and fuselage equipment. Serial production was planned to take place in the PZL WP-2 factory in Mielec as well as construction bureau HQ. A development schedule from August 1939 set the first flight of PZL.49/I in the summer of 1940, with the first serial built aircraft being delivered to combat units in late 1941 or early 1942. However, due to the German invasion on 1 September 1939, all plans were canceled. All documentation of the PZL.49 project was moved to Jerzy Dąbrowski's apartment in Warsaw early September 1939 and in late September, during siege of Warsaw, was burned in a nearby bakery to avoid German capture. Very little of the documentation has been recovered since the war. ==Technical design== The aircraft was conventional in layout, all metal (including the skin), with low-set laminar-flow wings and a twin tail. In terms of size, it was slightly larger than the Lockheed Model 10 Electra that Amelia Earhart used and was comparable to its predecessor, the PZL.37 Łoś. The crew consisted of four: pilot, commander/bombardier, radio operator and a rear gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in the glazed nose, with two forward- firing 7.92 mm PWU wz.37 machine guns. The radio operator sat inside the fuselage, above the bomb bay. The radio operator also operated two rear-firing 7.92 mm PWU wz.37 machine guns fitted in a kołyska (, typically called a gondola in English). The rear gunner sat in a fuselage turret with a 20mm cannon or four 7.92 mm PWU wz.37 machine guns. The main undercarriage retracted into the engine nacelles. The undercarriage was double-wheeled, with an independent suspension for each wheel and retractable rear wheel. The plane was powered by two Bristol Hercules radial engines with NACA covers. The bombs were carried in a two-section bomb bay in the fuselage, as well as bomb bays in the central section of the wings. The maximum load was 3,000 kg. Wings were fitted with split flaps. ==Variants (planned)== ;PZL.49/I :First prototype for flight and static trials. ;PZL.49/II :Second prototype, pattern aircraft for PZL.49A version. ;PZL.49A :Version powered by PZL-Bristol Hercules III engines. ;PZL.49B :Export version with French Gnome-Rhône 14N-50/51 engines. ==Operators (planned)== ; *Polish Air Force **Brygada Bombowa ==Specification (PZL.49 estimated)See alsoReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1930s Polish bomber aircraft Category:PZL aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Twin piston-engined tractor aircraft ","title":"PZL.49 Miś"},{"id":"20359313","text":"Cóir (Irish for \\"justice\\") was a social Catholic, conservative Eurosceptic lobby group established to campaign against the Treaty of Lisbon which was approved by referendum in Ireland on 2 October 2009.

At the age of five years she had her first dance lesson in Karlsruhe with Waltraud Kornhass, a student of Mary Wigman. From 1983 until 1986, Waltz studied at the School For New Dance Developmentthe.ahk.nl in Amsterdam. Between 1986 and 1987, Waltz did further training in New York. During that period she was a dancer for Pooh Kaye, Yoshiko Chuma & School of Hard Knocks and Lisa Kraus. After that she collaborated intensely with choreographers, visual artists and musicians such as Tristan Honsinger, Frans Poelstra, Mark N Tompkins, and David Zambrano. From 1992 onwards Waltz was artist in residence at the Künstlerhaus Bethanien. There she developed a series of \\"dialogues\\" in interdisciplinary projects with dancers, musicians and visual artists (Nasser Martin-Gousset, Takako Suzuki, Charlotte Zerbey, Ákos Hargitai). A year later in 1993, she founded her company \\"Sasha Waltz and Guests\\" with Jochen Sandig. Over the next 3 years they developed the Travelogue-Trilogy. Together with Jochen Sandig, Waltz founded the Sophiensæle in central Berlin, as a center for the development of free theatre and dance. Here they developed Allee der Kosmonauten (1996), Zweiland (1997) and Na Zemlje (1998), as well as the project Dialoge \`99/I. In 1999, Waltz took over as artistic director at Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin alongside Thomas Ostermeier, Jens Hillje and Jochen Sandig. She opened the Schaubühne under new direction with the debut of Körper (2000). This was followed by S (2000), noBody (2002), insideout (2003), Impromptus (2004) and Gezeiten (2005). Once her 5-year period with the Schaubühne finished, Waltz reactivated Sasha Waltz & Guests as an independent company again, with a base in Berlin. It was established as an international project with 25 permanent and 40 associate collaborators. In 2016, Michael Mueller, Mayor of Berlin, announced that Waltz and Johannes Ohman would succeed Nacho Duato as joint artistic directors of the Berlin State Ballet in 2019. In an online conversation with Octavian Saiu, Waltz declared that she “does not want to go back to the same world” as before the pandemic. She further explained that she thinks important lessons should be drawn from the global crisis, with crucial implications for humanity, ecology and culture. ==Artistic phasesEducation=== After high school, from 1983 to 1986, Waltz studied dance at the School For New Dance DevelopmentAmsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten in Amsterdam. She then furthered her education in New York from 1986 to 1987. In New York she worked as a dancer in the companies of Pooh Kaye, Yoshiko Chuma & School of Hard Knocks and Lisa Kraus. She then went on to collaborate with choreographers, visual artists and musicians such as Tristan Honsinger, Frans Poelstra, Mark Tompkins, David Zambrano, and others. During her training in Amsterdam and New York she created her first Sasha Waltz's choreographies, among them: Das Meer in mir (1985), Gold Dust (1986), How come we go (1987), Schwarze Sirene (1987) and Rifle (1987). ===1990s=== In 1992, Waltz received a scholarship from the Künstlerhaus Bethanien in Berlin as an Artist-in- residence It was in that context that she created her first of five dialogues in collaboration with the dancers Frans Poelstra, Nasser Martin-Gousset, Takako Suzuki, Kitt Johnson, Carme Renalias and David Zambrano, as well as the musicians Tristan Honsinger, David Moss, Dietmar Diesner, Sven-Åke Johansson, and Peter Hollinger. They performed their own dance productions at various locations in Berlin, such as the two solos False Trap (Tanzfabrik Berlin, 1991) and Paulinchen – allein zu Haus (Kunsthaus Tacheles, 1996) and in 1993 the Duet Bungalow in Hackescher Markt. Over the next three years her career took off with productions including Travelogue-Trilogie with Twenty to Eight (1993), Tears Breakfast (1994) and All Ways Six Steps (1995). Through this work, she laid the foundation for the rest of her career: After the premiere of Twenty to Eight in October 1993, Waltz founded, together with Jochen Sandig, her own dance company Sasha Waltz & Guests in order to appear in the Dance Platform in Berlin in 1994. The Dance Platform brought her more public attention. Then, Sasha Waltz & Guests toured with the trilogy Travelogue through Europe, and in 1995, with the support of the Goethe Institute, she toured North America (including the cities of Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Montreal, Houston and Los Angeles). ===2000s=== In 2007 a new generation of dancers took part in the first play of the trilogy Twenty to Eight. Up to this date the play is still on the repertoire of the company and is regularly performed. ==Selected works== Year and location of world premieres by Sasha Waltz: * 1993 Travelogue I - Twenty To Eight, Grand Theatre Groningen * 1994 Travelogue II - Tears Break Fast, Podewil Berlin * 1995 Travelogue III - All Ways Six Steps, Theater am Halleschen Ufer Berlin * 1996 Allee der Kosmonauten, Sophiensaele Berlin * 1997 Zweiland, Sophiensaele Berlin - 48th Berliner Festspiele * 1998 Na Zemlje (\\"On Earth\\"), Sophiensaele Berlin * 1998 Film adaptation of Allee der Kosmonauten in cooperation with television channels Arte/ZDF directed by Sasha Waltz * 1999 Dialoge ‘99/I, Sophiensaele Berlin * 1999 Dialoge ‘99/II, Jewish Museum Berlin * 2000 Körper, Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz Berlin * 2001 S, Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz Berlin * 2001 17-25/4 - Dialoge 2001, Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz Berlin * 2002 noBody, in coproduction with Festival d'Avignon, Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz Berlin * 2002 Adaptation of noBody for the Cour d'honneur of the Palais des Papes in Avignon * 2003 insideout, Helmust-List-Halle Graz * 2004 Impromptus, Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz Berlin * 2005 Dido and Aeneas, opera according to the composition by Henry Purcell, Berlin State Opera * 2005 Gezeiten, Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz Berlin * 2006 Solo für Vladimir Malakhov, House of World Cultures Berlin * 2006 Dialoge 06 - Radiale Systeme, Radialsystem Berlin * 2007 Medea, based on the opera \\"medeamaterial\\" by Pascal Dusapin (music) / Heiner Müller (text), Grand Théâtre de la Ville de Luxembourg * 2007 Roméo et Juliette, based on the symphony by Hector Berlioz, Paris Opera * 2008 Jagden und Formen with music by Wolfgang Rihm, Schauspiel Frankfurt * 2009 Dialogue 09 - Neues Museum, Neues Museum Berlin * 2009 Dialogue 09 – MAXXI, MAXXI National Museum of the 21st Century Arts Rome * 2010 Continu, Schiffbauhalle Zurich * 2010 Passion, based on the composition by Pascal Dusapin, Théâtre des Champs-Élysées Paris * 2011 Matsukaze, Opera by Toshio Hosokawa, Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie, Brussels.

He is best known for the part he played in the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States. He was born near Honiton in Devon. He entered the Navy in 1800, and evidently took part in the abortive British invasions of the Río de la Plata, as in 1807 he was appointed Lieutenant and commander of the schooner , taken as a prize at Montevideo. His promotion to Lieutenant was confirmed in 1808. In 1810, he married Sarah Anne Wemyss from Dundee. In 1811, he was serving aboard HMS Africa, the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Herbert Sawyer, the commander in chief of the North American station based at Halifax, Nova Scotia. The following year, he transferred to , the flagship of Sawyer's successor, Vice Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. He was one of three Lieutenants (the other two being Robert Finnis and Robert Heriot Barclay) detached by Warren to the naval establishment on the Great Lakes, with the acting rank of Commander. The Admiralty however had independently appointed Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo as Commodore to command on the lakes. During the early part of 1813, Pring served as commander of HMS Wolfe, which carried Yeo's broad pendant. Later in 1813, Pring was appointed to the naval establishment on Lake Champlain, based at Ile aux Noix in the Richelieu River. He was temporarily superseded by Commander Thomas Everard (who was senior to Pring) during several destructive raids against American outposts and depots on Lake Champlain during the late summer of 1813. During the early months of 1814, Pring commanded gunboats which played a part in the Battle of Lacolle Mills. In the spring of 1814, the Americans constructed a substantial flotilla on Lake Champlain, which outmatched Pring's force. In response, the British laid down the fifth rate frigate HMS Confiance. This was a ship which required a Post Captain in command, so Pring was superseded by Captain George Downie. Pring took charge of the 16-gun brig Linnet. During the Battle of Plattsburgh, Pring anchored the Linnet across the head of the American line of battle and did great damage, but Downie was killed and the Confiance and two other British armed vessels were forced to surrender. Left isolated and unable to escape, Pring fought on until the Linnet was battered almost to the point of sinking. In his report, Pring paid tribute to the gallantry of Downie, and also to the care paid to the prisoners and wounded by his opponent, Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. As was customary after any defeat, Pring faced a court martial between 18 and 21 August 1815 aboard HMS Gladiator, but was exonerated and honourably commended. The next year, he was promoted Post Captain. He briefly commanded the naval establishment on Lake Erie, but this was soon closed down. Pring then went on half pay for 20 years, living at Ivedon Penn near Honiton. In 1836, he returned to active service, in command of the frigate HMS Inconstant. From 1841 until 1843, he commanded the second rate ship of the line HMS Thunderer. In 1845, he commanded the 76-gun ship of the line, HMS Imaum, and was appointed Commodore of the Jamaica Division as well as the shore establishment Jamaica Dockyard. He died late in 1846 at Port Royal, Jamaica, possibly of yellow fever. He and his wife apparently left no children. ==References== *Forester, C. S.

There are several variations on its lyrics. ==History== The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes by Iona and Peter Opie traces this song back to an earlier folk ballad, recorded between 1770 and 1780, whose lyrics are: > O what can the matter be And what can the matter be O what can the matter be > Johnny bydes lang at the fair He'll buy me a twopenny whistle He'll buy me a > threepenny fair He'll buy me a Bunch o' Blue Ribbons To tye up my bonny > Brown Hair O saw ye him coming And saw ye him coming O saw ye him coming > Hame frae the Newcastle fair ==Lyrics== The following are given as the traditional lyrics (being chorus and verse) in Cuddon's and Preston's A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: > O dear, what can the matter be? Dear, dear, what can the matter be? O dear, > what can the matter be? Johnny's so long at the fair. He promised he'd buy > me a fairing should please me, And then for a kiss, oh! he vowed he would > tease me, He promised he'd bring me a bunch of blue ribbons, To tie up my > bonny brown hair. Cohen's Folk Music gives a different version of the lyrics: > O dear, what can the matter be? O dear, what can the matter be? O dear, what > can the matter be? Johnny's so long at the fair. He promised he'd bring me a > bunch of blue ribbons. He promised he'd bring me a bunch of blue ribbons. He > promised he'd bring me a bunch of blue ribbons. To tie up my bonny brown > hair. Raph's American Song Treasury uses the traditional lyrics and adds a second verse: > He promised he'd buy me a basket of posies A garland of lilies, a garland of > roses; A little straw hat to set off the blue ribbons That tie up my bonny > brown hair, and it's Raph dates this version of the song to 1795, and notes that while it has been popular in the United States for over 250 years, having made its way across the Atlantic shortly after American Independence, it is really English, having achieved widespread popularity in England around 1792, from being performed as a duet at Samuel Harrison concerts. It was performed in concerts in New York and Philadelphia within a decade of arriving in the U.S. The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes dates the song to a manuscript compiled some time between 1770 and 1780. Chappell's Popular Music dates the song to 1792, when it was first published as sheet music. The notes by Stenhouse in the second volume of Johnson's Scots Musical Museum record a concurrent Anglo-Scottish publication. ==Parodies== The song has been parodied several times, the best known of which is the American bawdy song \\"Seven Old Ladies\\", sung to the same tune but with different lyrics. Here are the chorus and the first two verses, of seven, as published in Ed Cray's The Erotic Muse: > Oh, dear, what can the matter be, Seven old ladies were locked in the > lavatory, They were there from Monday till Saturday, And nobody knew they > were there. The first old lady was 'Lizabeth Porter, She was the deacon of > Dorchester's daughter, Went there to relieve a slight pressure of water, And > nobody knew she was there. The second old lady was Abigail Splatter. She > went there 'cause something was definitely the matter. But when she got > there, it was only her bladder, And nobody knew she was there. One suggested precursor to the bawdy song, recorded in William's Upper Thames collection is the following \\"old morris fragment\\": > Oh, dear, what can the matter be? Three old women tied to an apple tree! One > ran away, the others stopped till Saturday. Oh, dear, what can the matter > be? As with many folk songs and tall tales each verse exaggerates one common trait (one so thin she falls through a knot-hole). Suggested alternate lyrics include: > Oh, dear, what can the matter be, Six old maids were stuck in the lavatory, > They were there from Sunday till Saturday, Nobody knew they were there The > first one in was fat lady Humphreys - squeezed herself down and she said > \\"it's quite comfy\\" but when she was through she could not get her bum free – > and nobody knew she was there. Refrain The next one there was old lady > Grayson – she couldn't get in so she peed in the basin it was the same water > the next washed her face in – and nobody knew they were there. Seven Old Ladies was not the first parody, however. Long before that parody, the song had been parodied for political purposes. One such parody can be found in the Wisconsin State Journal of 1 March 1864. It was written to exhort parents, who during the U.S. Civil War had not taken much interest in public schooling in Madison, to visit the schools of their children. Its lyrics were: > Oh, dear, what can the matter be? Oh, dear, what can the matter be? Oh, > dear, what can the matter be? Parents don't visit the school. They visit the > circus, they visit their neighbors; They visit their flocks and the servant > who labors; They visit the soldiers with murderours sabers; Now, why don't > they visit the school? (Chorus) They care for their horses, they care for > their dollars; They care for their parties and fancy fine collars; But > little, we think, do they care for their scholars; Because they don't visit > the school. (Chorus) We know we from hunger and cold are protected; In > virtue and knowledge our minds are directed; But still we do think that we > are sadly neglected; Because they don't visit the school.

The book examines the leadership's attempts to rescue European Jews who were under threat, and the controversy that surrounds those efforts. The Hebrew edition of the book was published in 1998 and the English version in 2005. ==The historiographic and public debate== The attitude of the Yishuv's leadership and its leader David Ben-Gurion to the Holocaust, the extent of knowledge about the murder, the options that were open to the Yishuv and what was actually done – these questions have been widely debated in historical research. For decades the popular view of these questions was that the Yishuv's leadership did not do enough to rescue the Jews who were being murdered by the Nazis. The pioneering comprehensive scientific exploration of this topic was Dina Porat's book of 1986 An Entangled Leadership, the Yishuv and the Holocaust 1942–1945. The book addressed the questions of what the Yishuv knew about the Holocaust and of rescue attempts during the years 1942–1945. The study's conclusion was that the information about the extermination arrived too late, that the Yishuv was too weak to be able to extend help, but that it did as much as was possible. Tom Segev's book The Seventh Million, published in 1991, was aimed at the wider public and constituted an indictment against the Yishuv's leadership, claiming that Ben-Gurion was indifferent to the victims' fate because of his deeply rooted negative attitude toward the diaspora, and that his efforts for the establishment of the State of Israel came at the expense of rescuing Jews. Many historians, such as Yehuda Bauer, Shabtai Teveth and Shlomo Aronson, sided with Porat in exonerating the Yishuv. Others, such as Yechiam Weitz and Hava Eshkoli-Wagman analysed specific dimensions. Each of these historians shed light on the topic from a different perspective. ==Friling's book== The 684-page English version of the book is to date the most comprehensive and thorough research of the topic. While attempting to show that much was done but that the success rate was very small, the book is a writ for the defense of the Yishuv's leadership and of its head, Ben-Gurion. The book's title \\"Arrows in the Dark\\" draws on a quote from Eliezer Kaplan, the Yishuv's \\"finance minister\\", who compared the rescue efforts' chances for success to the shooting of arrows in the dark, but insisted on the importance of seizing every opportunity, despite the minimal likelihood of hitting the target. Eliezer Kaplan, the Yishuv's \\"finance minister\\", who when referring to the Yishuv's rescue activities said that they had to shoot arrows into the dark, despite the minimal chances of hitting the target. The book describes, interprets and analyzes the manifold rescue operations conducted by the Yishuv: the plan for the rescue of children (end of 1942 until the end of the war), including Adler-Rudel's efforts from Sweden; the Transnistria Plan (end of 1942 until February–March 1943); the Slovakia Plan that eventually developed into the (end of 1942- October 1943); the \\"Blood for Trucks\\" proposal that Joel Brand and Bandi Grosz brought from Hungary (spring 1944 – summer 1944); the clandestine collaboration with Allied intelligence services, including the Paratroopers Plan, and others. Several harsh and bitter words by Ben-Gurion regarding the negation of the diaspora were used in the debate over the Yishuv's role to prove that he had been indifferent to the Jews' fate, or that in the best case he had adopted a practical approach and therefore decided to focus on what was practicable – the building of the State of Israel. Friling claims that what is important is not what Ben-Gurion said, but what he did or attempted to accomplish. He goes on to provide a lengthy and detailed description of Ben-Gurion's manifold activities. While Shabtai Teveth, Ben-Gurion's biographer, attempts to prove that the small scope of Ben-Gurion's activity on behalf of Europe's Jews can be explained by the prevailing belief that it was impossible to save the Jews, Friling introduces a new approach in the research of this issue. He claims that Ben-Gurion was deeply involved at all levels in all rescue efforts, but that these activities were mostly clandestine, and thus were conducted in secrecy and were almost never discussed openly. Ben-Gurion even kept silent in face of the accusations about his lack of action. This was compounded by the fact that the rescue operations were of the kind that are best left concealed. Moreover, since most of these efforts were doomed to fail, any explanation would have been perceived as a lame excuse. Filing shares the opinion that the Rescue Committee chaired by Itzhak Grunbaum was a body without executive powers, a \\"parliament\\" in the derogatory language of those days. At the same time he defines the role of the committee as a lightning rod intended to divert public pressure and guarantee the smooth functioning of the operational bodies. Friling goes on to describe the history of the Rescue Committee and highlights its importance in achieving a consensus in the Yishuv, thwarting the danger of disintegration in face of an event with the destructive magnitude of the Holocaust. Another contribution of this study to our understanding of the period is the identification of the body that was actually responsible for the Yishuv's rescue activities. According to Friling this was the 'Special Operations Section' of the Jewish Agency's Political Department, with people like Reuven Zaslani (Shilohah), Ehud Avriel, Teddy Kollek, Eliahu Eilat (Epstein), and others. They acted together with people of the Hagana and the Illegal Immigration Agency (Mossad Le'aliyah Bet), such as Eliahu Golomb, Shaul Meirov (Avigur), Zeev Shind, David Hacohen, and others, as well as with some of the emissaries of the political parties and movements, such as Menachem Bader and Vanya Pomerantz. According to Friling, this operational arm was directed by an undeclared informal triumvirate, consisting of Ben-Gurion, Moshe Sharett—the head of the Jewish Agency's Political Department, and Eliezer Kaplan—the Jewish Agency's treasurer. While researchers before Friling searched for documentation in the archives of the central bodies of the Yishuv, where very little evidence of rescue efforts was to be found, Friling looked for documentation in two additional sources: the archives of the British intelligence services, such as the SIS (Secret Intelligence Service), SOE (Special Operations Executive), and of the American agencies, such as the OWI (Office of War Information) or the OSS (Office of Strategic Services). These agencies kept track of the operations of the Yishuv and its emissaries and used them for their intelligence gathering, sabotage operations, etc. Friling also investigated the cooperation of the Jewish Agency with other Jewish organizations, such as the Joint Distribution Committee and the World Jewish Congress. He uncovered, among others, much information about the transfer by Jewish organizations of funds for rescue activity to enemy countries. Friling's book innovates our knowledge about the networks operated by Teddy Kollek, Ehud Avriel, and others from Istanbul. These networks were sending couriers with information, operational guidance, communication systems and funds into the occupied countries. The study shows that to their great misfortune, important segments of these networks that Kollek and his colleagues believed to be loyal and dependable, in reality held double and triple agents, activated by the German Military Intelligence (Abwehr) and even the Gestapo.

It was awarded an RIAA gold album on January 19, 1961. ==History== Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane formed the Kingston Trio in Palo Alto, California in June 1957. By 1958 they had a recording contract with Capitol Records and were in the studio by February. From their first recording sessions, the single \\"Tom Dooley\\" was released and became a number one hit in the US. The single's success helped propel their debut album to the number one spot of the Billboard Pop chart. \\"Tom Dooley\\" was the Trio's second single—the first was \\"Scarlet Ribbons\\" b/w \\"Three Jolly Coachmen\\" —and it would remain on the charts for five months and earned the group their only gold single.The Kingston Trio Timeline. The members were quoted in various articles, even the liner notes of the first album, separating themselves from more traditional folk artists. Reynolds stated \\"We don't collect old songs in the sense that the academic cats do. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good.\\" Guard is quoted \\"We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs, that people can pick up and become involved in... When the performance is over the piece is not significant anymore.\\" \\"Scotch and Soda\\" was discovered by the Trio through Tom Seaver's parents, who had first heard it when on their honeymoon. One member of the trio was dating Seaver's older sister at that time, and heard the song on a visit to the Seaver home.

Later in his junior career, he played for Augsburger EV, SC Riessersee, Jungadler Mannheim and Kölner Haie. He was drafted 130th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. The Leafs used the Florida Panthers' 5th round choice, which they received in sole compensation for defenseman Wade Belak in a trade on 26 February 2008. He made his debut in Germany's top-flight Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) for the Kölner Haie in the course of the 2007-08 season. He formerly wore number 90 for Kölner Haie (Cologne Sharks). Two of his four goals for Köln in the 2008–09 season have been game winning goals. Flaake initially signed a two- year deal with the Hamburg Freezers on 30 March 2010 and then was handed a contract extension through the 2013-14 campaign. After leading the team in scoring during the 2012-13 season, he inked a new five-year deal with the Freezers in May 2013. The team folded in May 2016, which made Flaake a free agent. Shortly after, on 2 June 2016, he signed with fellow DEL side EHC München. After two championship seasons with EHC München, Flaake left the club in order for more responsibility, agreeing to a three-year contract with Düsseldorfer EG on 15 May 2018. ==International play == Flaake made his first World Championship appearance in 2016. == Style of play == According to Cologne's former general manager Rodion Pauels, Flaake's strengths lie in his skating abilities, intelligence on the ice as well as his nose for the net. ==Career statisticsRegular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

He came to prominence as the most influential leader of the Council of Thirteen after the death of Joan Llorenç in the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Peris saw the revolution as a wider social revolution against the nobility, and aggressively attacked them. He also legitimized the anti-Muslim stance of many rebels into the Germanies government, and intensified their repression. ==Leadership in the Revolt == Peris was born in Segorbe. He was a member of the Council of Thirteen which came to contest the royal government's rule of Valencia in 1519. In 1520, the situation worsened with the appointment of Castilian Viceroy Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. A riot broke out after Mendoza refused to recognize the election of officials who were sympathetic to the Germanies, and in the chaos the popular \\"Sorolla\\" (Guillén Castleví) was killed. During the chaos, Peris led the city's mobs and militias against royal forces. The Viceroy was forced to flee the city, and shortly thereafter Joan Llorenç died, likely of a heart attack.Bonilla, p. 202. With the death of Sorolla and Llorenç, Peris came to be known as the most powerful and influential member of the Council of Thirteen. Still, his support was not universal. Allegedly Llorenç, upon seeing Peris leading the mobs from his window, exclaimed \\"The Germania was made for none of this! You and others like you will be the ruination of Valencia.\\"Bonilla, p. 202. Rendered into Spanish, the quote is: ¡Nunca para esto se inventó la Germanía! ¡Tú y otros como tú, seréis la perdición de Valencia!. Bonilla is citing Gaspar Escolano's Historia de Valencia, book 10, chapter 9. (That said, there is little evidence one way or the other for this quote.) At first, the royal government was ill-prepared for warfare and the Germanies were able to expand with little opposition. The most influential nobles fortified themselves at the castle near Gandia, while the Germanies took over the other cities of the Kingdom of Valencia. To fund their army, the Germanies seized the property and goods of nobles who opposed them, and possibly those of the mudéjars (Muslims of Valencia) as well. Unsurprisingly, the Muslims joined the armies of the nobles in numbers in response. Mudéjars captured or found by the Germanies were forcibly baptized and converted to Christianity. Peris obtained two important military successes. He conquered the castle of Xàtiva on July 14, 1521. A week later, he smashed the forces that Viceroy Mendoza had been gathering near Gandia at the Battle of Gandia on July 23. Under his command, the agermanats looted the town and farmland of the Gandia region, and undertook a campaign of forced baptisms upon all the Muslims of the conquered area. According to one account, after the Battle of Gandia Peris captured 2,000 Muslim prisoners who had sided with the Viceroy. He proceeded to baptize and then execute them all. When asked why, he (allegedly) said \\"Well, they gave many alms to Heaven, and much money to the purses of the agermanats.\\"Bonilla, p. 204. However, Peris was unable to control dissent and disagreement about the next course of action among the Germanies. Additionally, in spite of Peris's success, nobles in neighboring Andalusia did not wish to see the rebellion fester and potentially grow to envelop their lands. Their forces first took Elche (Elx), then proceeded north. They won a great victory at the battle of Oriola on August 20, 1521. ==Return to Valencia and death== Peris remained fortified at Xàtiva's castle for half a year, waiting in vain for the situation to improve. Valencia fell on November 1, 1521. On the night of February 18, 1522, Peris returned to the city of Valencia hoping to reignite the rebellion. Meeting with his supporters, he was somehow seen or betrayed, and a desperate night battle in the streets broke out between the agermanats and royal soldiers. Eventually, Peris was cornered and smoked out by setting his house on fire. but was captured by the royalist troops after a desperate night battle in which 100 people died.Bonilla, p. 205. Peris was executed on March 3, 1522. Several others--nine survivors of the night battle, along with three other men and one woman--were hanged. Their bodies were paraded through the street, and Peris was then hung suspended by his feet. Peris's head was put into a cage and hung high upon Saint Vincent's gate so that those who entered the city might see his fate. His home was demolished, and the site sown with salt. It was forbidden to build a new building there, so the lot became a small public square unofficially named after him. By order of the Viceroy, his descendants were stigmatized as traitors to the patria (homeland) to the fourth generation, a punishment from the Book of Numbers.Bonilla, p. 206. ==References== * Category:1478 births Category:1522 deaths Category:People from Segorbe Category:People of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods Category:Spanish rebels ","title":"Vicent Peris"},{"id":"20359562","text":"An Agbogho Mmuo and two attendees Agbogho Mmuo, or Maiden Spirits are annual performances held during the dry season in the Nri-Awka area in the northern part of the Igbos' traditional territory in Nigeria. Performed only by men wearing masks, the masquerades imitate the character of adolescent girls, exaggerating the girls' beauty and movements. The performance is always accompanied by musicians who sing and play tributes to both real and spirit maidens. The performances showcase an ideal image of an Igbo maiden. This ideal is made up by the smallness of a young girl’s features and the whiteness of her complexion, which is an indication that the mask is a spirit. This whiteness is created using a chalk substance used for ritually marking the body in both West Africa and the African Diaspora. The chalky substance is also used in uli design, created and exhibited on the skin of Igbo women. Most maiden spirit mask are decorated with representations of hair combs, and other objects, modeled after late 19th-century ceremonial hairstyles.

He was successively a member of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, and Muintir na hÉireann, and was a spokesman for Cóir. He subsequently joined the Christian Solidarity Party Why Ireland Needs a Christian Party Now Article by Richard Greene, published in CatholicVoice, 6 Feb 2011 (from the Christian Solidarity Party Website) and became its leader. He was a member of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council and the Eastern Health Board in the 1990s. ==Education and early career== Greene went to national school in Clontarf and then O'Connell School. He got a degree in English literature from Trinity College, Dublin, worked a year in France and became a secondary-school teacher, and subsequently a careers guidance counsellor. He holds a M.A. in linguistics from University College Dublin and did postgraduate research in sociolinguistics at Dublin City University. He is a chartered member of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and is a graduate member of the Psychological Society of Ireland. ==Extradition== Greene developed an interest in politics during the 1981 hunger strikes, and campaigned on behalf of the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven and the Birmingham Six. He subsequently joined Fianna Fáil. He co-founded an unofficial Fianna Fáil members' anti- extradition association to oppose the implementation of the 1987 Extradition legislation, introduced under the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, which envisaged extradition from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland, and reduced the ability of Irish republican suspects to avoid extradition for \\"political crimes\\". The controversial case of Father Patrick Ryan gave the group publicity. Greene was expelled from his cumann of Fianna Fáil on 3 October 1988 for \\"conduct unbecoming a member\\", reinstated two weeks later on appeal to the Dáil constituency Comhairle, and re-expelled by the national executive on 15 December. In January 1990, Greene was elected to the founding executive of the Irish National Congress, a newly formed lobby campaigning for \\"a British withdrawal from Ireland\\". He also campaigned against the extradition of Dessie Ellis in 1990. He was a member of a committee which in 1991 secured a memorial in the Garden of Remembrance to the victims of the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings. ==County councillor== Greene subsequently joined the Green Party, and unexpectedly won a seat on Dublin County Council in the Clonskeagh district in the 1991 local elections. He made outspoken pronouncements opposing the X case judgment and defending Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, persisting despite warnings from party colleagues that these were unauthorised by party policy. After Roger Garland moved to have him expelled, he resigned on 6 April 1992. He was Public Relations Officer of Right-to-Life Ireland, an umbrella group of pro-life organisations opposed to the Maastricht Treaty which campaigned for a No-vote in the ratification referendum. Greene ran in the 1992 general election in Dublin South as an independent, but endorsed by the Christian Centrist Party. He sought an injunction in the High Court against the wording of the 1992 \\"Right to Life\\" referendum, but withdrew it when he offered no alternative wording. Unusually among independent members of Dublin County Council, Greene supported all the rezoning motions at the July 1993 meeting. In 1993, Greene founded the Irish Civil Rights Association, which opposed the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993 which restricted the conduct of participants at public protests. Under the 1994 Act which split Dublin into three new county council areas, Greene became a member of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council. Also in 1994, Greene became founding chairman of Muintir na hÉireann. In November, the group was denied official registration as a political party as it was not organised to fight elections; Greene contended the party had almost 1,000 members in 12 constituencies. It was eventually registered in April 1995. The party endorsed Mildred Fox in the 1995 Wicklow by-election for her pro-life stance. Greene criticised Fox when, having won the by-election, she abstained, rather than opposing, the constitutional amendment to allow divorce. In the ensuing referendum campaign, Muintir's Emmanuel Sweeney suggested that then government minister Mervyn Taylor and TD Alan Shatter might not understand Christian marriage. Since both were Jewish, this was condemned as \\"anti- semitic\\". Greene denied the charge but defended the remarks. He supported a High Court challenge to the referendum result. Other anti-divorce campaigners distanced themselves from the comments. In the run-up to the 1996 referendum on restricting the right to bail, Greene wrote to the United Nations asking for election monitoring of the government's campaign. In late 1996, Greene's relationship with Muintir na hÉireann broke down. In December, the party executive voted to expel him, but he disputed their authority to do so, as he was the party officer on the Dáil register of parties. The Dáil registrar subsequently decided that Greene was no longer an officer, and he was expelled from the party in March 1997. Greene sought to get Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council to nominate Dana Rosemary Scallon in the 1997 Presidential election. ==Later campaigns== Greene lost his council seat at the 1999 local elections. He complained that an RTÉ Television documentary about \\"political dynasties\\" broadcast before the poll gave an unfair advantage to featured candidates. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission upheld his protest. Greene opposed the Treaty of Nice and the second referendum on it.Nice Treaty and Nice Treaty II Documents - Irish Media Review He has acted as spokesperson on Television and Radio, for the lobby group Cóir which campaigned against the Treaty of Lisbon. He campaigned against a second Lisbon Treaty referendum and has participated in public forums on behalf of Cóir. On 20 November 2008, he led a three-person delegation from Cóir appearing at meeting of the Oireachtas sub-committee on Ireland's Future in the EU. In his opening statement, he said: :we ask the committee today if it will show its respect for the Irish “No” vote by declaring the treaty dead and calling on EU leaders to end the treaty ratification process immediately. If the committee refuses to do so, then Cóir believes that the sole objective of this committee is to attempt to overturn the democratic wishes of the majority of the people who voted “No” to Lisbon. This brazen effrontery and blatant denial of democracy shows the contempt in which the political parties hold the people. Suppressing the sovereign will of the people in such a fashion would be an act of treason, the likes of which has not been seen since the Act of Union. The delegation withdrew shortly after. Senator Paschal Donohoe, who chaired the meeting, said \\"It was a disgraceful performance. To accuse any member of this committee of an act of treason is the most appalling and disgraceful comment yet made in this House.\\" Greene serves as chairman Alliance for the Defence of the Family and Marriage which advocated a No vote in the 2015 Marriage Referendum,Group defends leaflet denouncing same-sex marriage Irish Times, February 25, 2015. and also against the 2015 Children and Family Relationships Bill.Alliance for the Defence of the Family and Marriage ==See also== * Muintir na hÉireann * Cóir * Christian Solidarity Party == References == Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Conservatism in Ireland Category:Councillors of Dublin County Council Category:Fianna Fáil politicians Category:Green Party (Ireland) politicians Category:Independent politicians in Ireland Category:Irish anti-abortion activists Category:Local councillors in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown Category:Politicians from Dublin (city) ","title":"Richard Greene (politician)"},{"id":"20359705","text":"Orthonitrate is a tetrahedral oxoanion of nitrogen with the formula .

The Reading Railroad provided this service in partnership with the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), in which it was the majority owner of capital stock. Trains including the Crusader ran on Reading Railroad tracks from Reading Terminal in Philadelphia to Bound Brook, NJ, where they continued on CNJ tracks to Communipaw Terminal in Jersey City.Passengers then left the train and walked aboard the ferry or boarded busses that loaded onto the ferry.Discussio of the history of Commnipaw: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Railroad_of_New_Jersey_Terminal Introduced in 1937, the Crusader service declined during the 1960s. The southern part of the route was cut in 1981, followed by the northern part in 1982. ==HistoryCreating the Crusader=== The train's first schedule and the contest to name it. The Crusader at Reading Terminal in 1968, shortly before the train began operating with Rail Diesel Cars By the 1930s, the Reading Company offered hourly expresses from Reading Terminal to the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Jersey City Communipaw Terminal via the Reading's New York Branch to Bound Brook where it connected with the CNJ. In order to better compete for passenger business from Philadelphia to New York with its rival Pennsylvania Railroad and attract more riders, in 1937 the railroad introduced its new Crusader premier service. Built by the Budd Company of Philadelphia, this dedicated train consisted of five stainless steel streamlined cars pulled by a stainless steel shrouded streamlined Pacific class (4-6-2) steam locomotive. The train consisted of two stainless-steel coaches, two observation cars, and a tavern-dining car. A round-end observation car was at each end, a coach adjacent, and the tavern car in the middle. With this configuration, the railroad eliminated the need to turn the entire train around at the \\"stub end\\" terminals at both Jersey City and Philadelphia. Only the locomotive had to be reversed at the completion of each trip. Each locomotive had a specially-built tender (carrying the coal and water for locomotive operation) that wrapped around the observation car directly behind it.Sidebar photograph of the Crusader. ===Naming the Crusader=== A contest was held to find a name for the new train, offering a $250 cash prize to the winner. The Crusader, the entry of Mr. P. W. Silzer of Plainfield, New Jersey, won the prize, selected by a committee of 29 railroad officials from among 6,086 suggestions. The Crusaders first regular run was on December 13, 1937. The train was scheduled to make two round trips six days a week; Sundays were reserved for maintenance work. ===The decline and end of the Crusader=== In the early 1950s, the streamlined steam locomotives were replaced by General Motors EMD FP7 diesel electric locomotives. Passenger business was declining for the Reading as it was for all railroads at the time. For cost saving, in 1962 the stainless steel Crusader was sold to the Canadian National Railway. The Crusader then began operating with the smooth-sided cars originally made for the Reading's other upscale Philadelphia–Jersey City Reading train, the Wall Street. By the mid-1960s, the Crusader and Wall Street were the only Reading Railroad trains operating beyond West Trenton north to Bound Brook. The Crusader observation car at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania In May 1967, the Aldene Plan went into effect; this closed the Jersey City Communipaw Terminal and diverted trains to Newark Penn Station, thus adding 13 minutes to the commuter going to Wall Street. The trains could not go beyond Newark Penn Station to New York Penn Station because diesel-powered trains were not permitted in the Pennsylvania Railroad's Hudson North River Tunnels. Locomotive-hauled service soon ended and was replaced by two self propelled Budd Rail Diesel Cars. Deteriorating track and additional stops to the prior Crusader schedule caused the length of the Philadelphia-Newark trip to increase from its 90 minutes to 110 minutes. This passenger service, like many former Reading and CNJ lines, was eventually subsidized by SEPTA and New Jersey Transit. In the early 1980s, SEPTA began cutting back its diesel- powered lines in preparation for the opening of the electric-only Philadelphia Center City Commuter Connection that tied together the former Reading Terminal and the Pennsylvania Railroads Suburban Station tracks. Through service from Philadelphia to Newark ended on July 30, 1981; SEPTA continued hourly commuter trains on its electric West Trenton Line, with a connection to a once-daily, weekday-only diesel powered West Trenton to Newark shuttle. This service ended on December 3, 1982, when the NJ Transit shuttle made its final trip due to poor ridership and a budget deficit. The trip served 290 daily passengers and cost $319,000 annually to run. NJT has explored restoring the service as its own West Trenton Line. Two of the train's original five cars survive. An observation car is in the collection of the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania at Strasburg, Pennsylvania. The other observation was in service as part of the Spirit of Washington Dinner Train in Washington state until 2007, and is now part of the passenger car fleet of Iowa Pacific Holdings. ==References Category:1982 disestablishments Category:Named passenger trains of the United States Category:Passenger rail transportation in New Jersey Category:Passenger rail transportation in Pennsylvania Category:Reading Company Category:Railway services introduced in 1937 ","title":"Crusader (train)"},{"id":"20359723","text":"Henry Lester (1840–1926) was a British architect, merchant and philanthropist in Shanghai.Shanghai Local Archive Office ==Birth and life in Britain== Lester was born in Southampton in 1840 as the youngest of four brothers.

It comes from the Greek roots diplo = \\"double\\" and pod = \\"foot\\". Diplopodia is often found in conjunction with other structural abnormalities and can be lethal. It is more extreme than polydactyly, the presence of extra digits. ==Description== The affected leg usually has one foot that is in an approximately normal position. The extra foot is composed of at least some metatarsal or tarsal bones and extra digits, though it is usually not complete. The feet can be joined together, so that the limb appears to have one large foot, or the extra foot can be joined to the limb separately, usually above the level of the other foot. Diplopodia affects one or both of the hind limbs. ==Causes== Recessive alleles of some genes involved in embryonic limb patterning produce bilateral diplopodia, and diplopodia can be experimentally induced in early embryos. Many instances of diplopodia in humans have no apparent cause. People have been able to produce diplopod limbs by increasing sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling in the limb buds of embryos. The zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) in the proximal posterior mesoderm of a tetrapod limb bud is responsible for maintaining the anterior- posterior axis of the growing limb. The ZPA secretes shh protein, which induces formation of the distal segment of the limb, or autopod, with its posterior side facing the ZPA. When ZPA cells, non-ZPA cells made to express shh, or simply shh protein-soaked beads are implanted in the anterior side of a limb bud, the end of the resulting limb is duplicated, as in diplopodia. The posterior autopod on that limb has the normal orientation, and the extra, anterior autopod has a reversed anterior-posterior axis. This is because the original ZPA and the added source of shh signaling each induce the formation of an autopod. ==Diplopodia in humans== Diplopodia is often found in combination with aplasia or hypoplasia of the tibia. Sometimes, the tibia is replaced by another fibula The extra foot is almost always joined to the normal foot, though a case was described where a nearly complete extra foot joined to the back of the ankle. ==Diplopodia in chickens== People have identified five recessive lethal mutations in chickens that cause bilateral diplopodia. The genes are numbered in the order of their discoveries, with the symbols dp-1, dp-2, dp-3, dp-4, and dp-5. Chickens normally have an anisodactyl toe arrangement, with one short toe pointing backwards and three long toes pointing forwards. In diplopodia, the feet usually lack the normal hind toe and instead develop two to four extra toes at various positions between the hock joint and the front toes. The toes are almost always connected to extra tarso-metatarsal bones, though sometimes the toes do not contain any bone. Embryos with diplopodia have been found with numbers of digits on one wing ranging from one to seven, while normal embryos have three digits per wing. Diplopod limb buds first differ visibly from normal limb buds by their abnormally thick and long apical ectodermal ridges. Diplopodia usually delays the embryonic growth of cartilage, bone, and tendon by two days, particularly in the limbs. Other characteristics frequently seen in diplopodia mutants are shortened wings and legs, short upper beak, and smaller embryo size. Many embryos reach the final embryonic stage but then are unable to hatch, though, diplopod embryos can occasionally hatch and mature. Single diplopodia mutations produce wide ranges of phenotypes sharing these general characteristics and can even affect individual chickens' left and right legs differently. The ranges of phenotypes produced by the different mutations also overlap broadly, so diplopodia mutations sometimes need to be distinguished by their phenotype distributions. Dr. Ursula Abbott has extensively studied the phenotypes and descriptions of the first four diplopodia mutations and has ranked them from least severe to most severe: dp-3, dp-1, dp-4, dp-2. Diplopodia-1 This autosomal mutation gives homozygotes duplicated wing tips and feet in front of the usual structures, as in the experimentally induced diplopodia described above. However, unlike the experimentally manipulated embryos, these embryos show no change in shh expression. The embryos express hoxd-11, hoxd-12, hoxd-13, Bmp-2, and Fgf-4 along the whole edge of each limb bud, even though these genes are normally only expressed at the posterior edge. Diplopodia-2 This is an autosomal trait that gives a very extreme diplopod phenotype, with up to eight toes on a foot. In some embryos, the two outer front toes on each foot are joined together. The trait is now extinct and was never fully characterized. Diplopodia-3 This is an autosomal trait that may be the least severe of the five. Diplopodia-4 This sex-linked mutation is similar to the previous mutations, but causes the embryo to grow thicker wing bones. Diplopodia-5 This is an autosomal mutation that gives embryos webbing between the inner two front toes on each foot, in addition to the usual characteristics of diplopodia. Almost all of the embryos survive to the end of incubation, but they are unable to clear the fluid from their lungs or absorb the blood from their extraembryonic vessels. These problems always prevent them from hatching. Almost all diplopodia-5 embryos have only one or two extra toes on each foot, so this mutation causes the least extreme foot malformation. ==See also== * Limb development * Congenital abnormality * Diplocheiria * Dysmelia * Sonic hedgehog * Polydactyly ==References== Category:Congenital disorders of musculoskeletal system Category:Supernumerary body parts ","title":"Diplopodia"},{"id":"20359776","text":"Knightly may refer to: * Knight or knighthood * Knightly Piety * the surname Knightley * Knightley, Staffordshire ","title":"Knightly"},{"id":"20359811","text":"This is a complete and as of 2009 up-to-date list of vascular plants listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and protected in Russia at the federal level. ==Pteridophyta Aspleniaceae=== :Asplenium adiantum-nigrum L. - (rare) :Asplenium daghestanicum Christ - (rare) :Asplenium altajense (Kom.)

He was one of the group of Cairo poets during World War II. Waller was the son of Captain Stanier Waller and Alice Harris, who was a barmaid before she married; Captain Waller died of wounds from the First World War. John was educated at Weymouth College and Worcester College, Oxford. In 1939, he founded the magazine Kingdom Come, which he edited.The Salamander-Oasis Trust Waller served in the Middle East from 1941 to 1946 and was initially with the Royal Army Service Corps. Then he was posted to the Ministry of Information, where his sergeant-major was the poet G. S. Fraser. During his time in Cairo, he founded the Salamander Society with Keith Bullen (poet) and John Cromer, and launched Oasis: the Middle East Anthology of Poetry from the Forces in August 1943. After the war, Waller had a number of poetry collections published, such as The Merry Ghosts, Crusade and The Kiss of Stars. He edited books and was presented with the Greenwood Award for Poetry in 1947 and became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1948. He was also Information Officer in the Overseas Press Division of the Central Office of Information. In 1954, on the death of Sir Edmund Waller, 6th Baronet, he inherited the baronetcy.Leigh Rayment Baronets W However, he lost his inherited income, as business ventures failed, and he gave up writing. Waller was awarded the Keats Prize in 1974. In 1976, he helped set up the Salamander Oasis Trust. This was originally intended just to reprint Oasis, but Waller suggested collating as much as possible of the material that had not been used, which resulted in four anthologies. Waller lived in Isleworth, and in 1974 he married Anne Eileen Mileham. The marriage ended in divorce, without children; Lady Waller was declared bankrupt in 1990.

Dervish is dying and only has a short amount time left to live, but he and Grubbs take it in their normal humorous stride. Grubbs reflects on how Dervish has always been there for him and begins to recall memories of his time with his uncle. Dervish dies during Grubbs' reflections. Grubbs takes his body into the open air and begins the slow, painful process of digging his uncle's grave. Nearly a month later Grubbs is fighting a snakelike demon that killed the granny Disciple. He kills it then finishes up the battle. He has been fighting wave after wave of demons that are breaking through all over the globe. He has gathered another group of werewolves but is slowly being worn down. He goes to see Kernel and Kirilli in the hospital. He has been having a reoccurring dream of Bec in Lord Loss's kingdom, and in one of his torture chambers he sees Bo Kooniart. Bec then gets Lord Loss to take them into Earth’s first chessboard. Time seems to freeze as Grubbs keeps on peering into the chess room. They return and it seems that Bec has made a deal with Lord Loss, and this assures Grubbs that Bec has betrayed them. For as Bec goes back to her room she hugs Lord Loss after he has agreed to something. Something to do with lodestones. Therefore, they decide to destroy as many lodestones as they can before Bec can get to them, and go to the only lodestone that they know the location of, the one at Carcery Vale. Grubbs, Kernel, Kirilli and two werewolves Curly and Moe with the help of the government and military of the world are quickly there by plane, which the werewolves hate and helicopter which they love. When they get there, they walk around Dervish's old mansion for a while, before going to the cave. They remove the dirt and go into the tunnel and the second cave with the lodestone after Kernel tells Grubbs this might be exactly what Bec and Lord Loss want them to do. They carry on and Grubbs destroys the lodestone by throwing it at the cave wall and grinding the other pieces together and into the ground until nothing of it remains. Then footsteps approach and Shark and Timas Brauss reveal themselves. They discuss everything that has happened, Shark confronts Grubbs and forces him to confront his fears. He apologizes to Kernel and tells him he will let him go after he opens a window to Bec, regardless of whether he wants to come with them or not. Grubbs works for hours to open the window, Shark, Timas, the werewolves and Kirilli all go through, and Kernel is lead into it by Grubbs. Going to the Demonata Universe makes him happy for the first time in a long while. The Kah-Gash questions Grubbs before he goes through as well. Kernel sets to work on his eyes while the others relax, then Curly starts acting strangely and Bec's face comes out of her body. Bec tries to convince Grubbs it is over and that he should choose to live like she has. When he refuses, she laughs and warns him about the incoming attack. A window opens up and Lord Loss's familiars pour out as Bec's face disintegrates. They start fighting the demons then four, four-metre tall demons come through and start throwing their fellows into the lake before bowing to it, allowing the lake to kill them. Grubbs realizes that this was the reason why they were sent there to wake the lake, the real, demon master of this realm. Who up to this point was starved of food. They back away but as it splits up, they are out of time. Grubbs takes Kernel and jumps through the window towards Lord Loss's realm followed by the others. Here Grubbs convinces Kernel to help him free the prisoners after he has remade his eyes. They do so, setting all the prisoners free and sending them through a portal to Earth, killing those too weak to move through as an act of mercy. He then gives Kirilli, Timas and Shark the chance to go back but they refuse, he then goads Kernel saying he can't leave now and he doesn't. They confront Lord Loss and Bec and start fighting the pair of them but Grubbs quickly realizes they are fully outmatched. Moe, Shark and Kirilli all fight Lord Loss but he makes short work of them. Lord Loss tells Bec to kill one of them but she can't. When Grubbs and Kernel try to reason with her, she tells them all those she was loyal to are gone, she gets the original board and the walls melt to reveal thousands of humans. Their souls are trapped inside the board and Bec melts the board killing all of them. When the last human falls the board is still glowing and Death comes from it. Its tendrils caress Bec and one of them enters her throat as she calls for Grubbs to come to her. Kernel has opened a window and Lord Loss, stunned from Grubbs's last attack can't stop him. Shark and Kirilli flee through the window followed by a reluctant Timas. Grubbs follows after the Kah-Gash tells him they could be a quartet with Death, Grubbs refuses to go through and Kernel destroys the window. Kernel realizes that now that Death is back on the scene there is no hope for the Earth, so he decides to go back to the Ark to save a small part of the life from this universe. Kirilli has the idea to get the Old Creatures to help protect the Earth, so Grubbs agrees to the plan. Kernel can’t open a window from Earth so they go back to the Demonata Universe and after passing through several worlds, Kernel starts working on a window to Atlantis, on the barren asteroid world. As he opens the window, he tells the others he can only take Grubbs with him for they will be going through space and he only has power to protect one person from it. They travel through the space tunnel of light and arrive in Atlantis. Grubbs begins to make the request to Raz, but, having read his mind, Raz states that the Old Creatures will not help. He freeze Grubbs promising to send him back to die alongside the other earthlings. But then another window opens and a Deathified-Bec comes through, explaining that she can go anywhere Kernel has been, and that she knows where the 'Ark' is. Raz loses hope and attacks her, they fight and she kills Raz, but this drains some of Death’s power, and she regains enough control of herself to shout at Kernel and Grubs to get away before Death kills them and can reunite the Kah-Gash. They do as she suggests and return to the others, but Grubbs is now suspicious that Bec is not as evil and demonic as they thought. They resign themselves to the end of the world, but decide that they should try to kill as many demons as they can before the world falls. When they go back to Earth, the world is being besieged by demons, who have managed to open several tunnels, in the six weeks that have passed on earth since they left. They decide that they might as well try to close the tunnel and forestall the annihilation of Earth. They meet back-up with Prae and a new set of werewolves and all fight with new vigor (even Kernel, who didn’t like the fighting, has decided that there is nothing to lose anymore), they make it to the tunnel entrance and destroy the lodestone, causing the demons to be sucked back to their realm, alongside some unfortunate werewolves and humans. They go to a tunnel on the opposite end of the earth next, but they quickly realize it is futile and they have everybody pulled out. Grubbs decides they should wait for the tunnels that threaten the whole world and throw everything they got at it, and leave the ones that can only cover a few hundred kilometers alone. After four days Kernel sees the lights going wild, the sign that a tunnel of great power is opening. A team fronted by Grubbs, Kernel, Kirilli, Shark and Timas go to the edge of a cliff where the tunnel is (this most likely is the place that Bec and Beranabus travel to in the fourth book and where we see the Old Creatures for the first time). Grubbs uses the power coming through the forming tunnel to re-enact Moses and he parts the sea, and then creates steps down on the cliffside to the cave and tunnel. Timas stays on top, and he and Shark inform the others that they have arranged for nuclear devices all over the world to be detonated if the team fails, therefore causing the humans to be killed instantly, instead of waiting for the demons to torture them. On the way down the Kah-Gash informs Grubbs that it never wanted to manipulate them, and isn't working for the demons or humans. This means that Grubbs can use the ancient weapon as much as he wants, and it will do whatever he wants. When they go in, they find the tunnel entrance and Lord Loss and Deathified-Bec waiting for them. While the tunnel is opening, a fight breaks out, and Grubbs manages to catch Lord Loss by surprise using his and Kernel's parts of the Kah-Gash, taking him out of action for a while. The pair begins to seal the tunnel again, but then Bec steps in. She diverts Kernel and Grubbs's power into herself, giving the masters in the tunnel the opportunity to burst through. This is when Grubbs realizes that Lord Loss, who he has been afraid of since his parents and sister were slaughtered, was only one of the lesser demon masters, and that the ones that are pouring through at the moment are many times stronger than him. In the following fight Kirilli is decapitated, and Shark is melted along with most of the other werewolves and soldiers, by the far stronger demon masters. In a last attempt Kernel and Grubbs grab Bec, after being unable to beat her up, they do this to try to blow her up in the tunnel to close it, but when they get to her and direct all their energy into her, she just feeds it back to them increasing it, letting the weapon rise in power. Bec begins to control the weapon, and in a last attempt to stop her, Grubbs cuts the flow of energy to her, but then she winks at him. This catches him by surprise, and he quickly makes the decision that she wasn’t trying to fool him, so instead of cutting the power to Bec, he increases it, directing all the power around them into the girl. The Kah-Gash becomes fully active, and starts a similar process as it did in the sixth book, but at a much more advanced stage. They begin to rip everything in our universe and the Demonata’s to shreds, Bec then tells them to go to the Crux (the place where both universes expanded from), and reveals that she is following a plan devised by Beranabus. When they arrive at the Crux, they split into sixty-four pieces, and slot all of the body of the Kah-Gash back together. The original universe is back in place, with the Demonata in the white zones and the Old Creatures in the black zones. Bec has restored the old universe, but now the Kah-Gash has the three teenagers as a mind. They restore bodies for themselves, and then discuss what will happen now. Bec explains that because she is the Kah-Gash’s memory she memorized everything as they destroyed it, the history of every atom (it is also likely that merging with Death was the only way to stop it and learn the history of all those that died, for Death knows them all). Thanks to this the three of them can rebuild the human universe exactly as it was. Grubbs believes that now that they have restored the old universe, everything will happen as it did before, the Kah- Gash will split, and everything will repeat itself if they recreate everything, but Kernel realizes what the next part of the plan was. As they now hold the universe together, they hold everything inside together, including the demons. This means that they can easily undo those bonds and destroy the demons. But Bec persuades them out of destroying every demon, and Kernel shows them a clip of the past where Beranabus tells Grubbs that most of the demons are not worth bothering about. This sways Grubbs into the others’ way of thinking. So they decide to destroy all the demon masters and all those who have the potential to cross. But they don’t torture them or revel in their demise, though Grubbs does enjoy the killing. They however do leave one to be the last. They reform their bodies and meet the last master: Lord Loss. He is waiting for them on his throne outside of his castle of webs. Lord Loss questions them about killing the lesser demon master especially those who were similar to them in stature. When Grubbs tells him he took the permission to do this, Lord Loss tells him it is very demonic of him to do so and his conscience will catch up with him across eternity. As they go to kill him, Bec stops them, revealing that she had made a deal with Lord Loss. Grubbs doesn’t care and wants to kill him regardless, Kernel however does want to know about the deal, when Grubbs tries to kill him, he can’t. Bec explains that if they fight with each other the Kah-Gash can be split again. Grubbs then allows her to tell him about the deal. In the chess board she told him about Bran’s plan and that Lord Loss didn’t even think she could convince them to spare the familiars. Lord Loss reveals he doesn’t actually care about his fellow demon masters calling them a vile, beastly lot. She goes on to state that her burning the board was a charade in order to trick both Death and the Demonata. Bec explains that Death didn’t have access to her inner thoughts for consciousness was new to it. Lord Loss then reveals he protected Bec and made sure they came together, which was a calculated risk. Grubbs wonders why and Lord Loss explains that he likes humans, their sorrows, suffering and games they invent. Bec promised his life in return and a promotion. Lord Loss then reveals he isn’t that powerful and chose to focus on earth while other demon master terrorized galaxies. He postulates that maybe the Kah-Gash drew him to earth. He then tells them he will be the boss of all Demonate now, his shadow will be cast on the hearts and minds of the creatures of the universe, reaching more worlds then any demon master ever before. Grubbs starts to protest this but Bec says they need him. For the universe requires a force of evil and she doesn’t like the idea of being it. Grubbs says they could use another demon, but Bec explains she made a deal and he promised not to overstep his bounds, leave the old creatures alone and only cross when authorized and he won’t establish toeholds in the universe. Bec then states they have to make sure that everything happens as it did before. Every demon crossing has to be recreated. Then when they reach the present they can stop the crossings. Lord Loss then claims that he is the reason everything unfolded as it did and Grubbs must accept him. Grubbs relents thinking Lord Loss might be part of an uber plan. Grubbs warns him not to step out of line, Lord Loss rebukes him saying he wouldn’t he would be there just to enjoy the misery and he folds his arm as they leave him. What follows is the poem that Darren Shan wrote (which inspired this series and is in the front of Lord Loss) is repeated. The trio then chooses a black square at random and prepare to restart the human universe with the Big Bang, making sure that everything is as it was the first time. Bec provides the memories, Kernel manipulates the hidden strings of the universe and Grubbs supplies the power to do it. The Old Creatures sense what they are doing and they can feel their approval. It will be difficult however they will have to focus for billions of years. Souls are the only thing they don’t need to worry about, for they can feel a large force at work there, a force they do not name. Grubbs states that he will feel tempted to interfere but he must fight for they don’t want to rob individuals of the right of determination. They are architects of the universe and nothing more. Grubbs thinks that they could start over but they must ensure life evolves so they get the ball rolling, but they might stop a bit earlier as he increase this amount of time, Bec tells him that it is dangerous thinking and they should not interfere. Grubbs tells her they have to at the end to stop themselves from tearing the universe to shreds. They have to make changes there can’t be wandering pieces of the Kah-Gash. Death must remain a force. Grubbs tells them they need to make all kinds of changes and Kernel agrees. Bec asks them where they would draw the line, when Grubbs is born or when she is born. Grubbs states if they do that all those he cares about might never be born. As they fantasize about all they could do, Bec questions whether they have the right to alter the universe to suit their own desires. Kernel responds they should discuss further, and Bec agrees. Grubbs tells them they have the next billions of years to do so. Grubbs tells them to get started but Bec and Kernel leave it up to him to begin, assuring him it will work out. He thinks about what to say before starting the job of starting the Big Bang. He utters a slightly changed biblical quote saying: \\"In the beginning Grubbs created the Heavens and the Earth and everything was dark. Then Grubbs said 'Let there be light'.\\" And there was light.

It has been shown to be as accurate as the Wells Score, and is less reliant on the experience of the doctor applying the rule. The Geneva score has been revised and simplified from its original version. The simplified Geneva score is the newest version and predicted to have the same diagnostic utility as the original Geneva score. ==Original Geneva Score== The original Geneva score is calculated using 7 risk factors and clinical variables: { class= border=1 !Variable !Score - !colspan=2Age - 60–79 years 1 - 80+ years style=\\"text- align:center\\"2 - !colspan=2Previous venous thromboembolism - Previous DVT or PE 2 - !colspan=2Previous surgery - Recent surgery within 4 weeks 3 - !colspan=2Heart rate - Heart rate >100 beats per minute 1 - !colspan=2PaCO2 (partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood) - <35mmHg 2 - 35-39mmHg 1 - !colspan=2PaO2 (partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood) - <49mmHg 4 - 49-59mmHg 3 - 60-71mmHg 2 - 72-82mmHg style=\\"text- align:center\\"1 - !colspan=2Chest X-ray findings - Band atelectasis 1 - Elevation of hemidiaphragm style=\\"text- align:center\\"1 } The score obtained relates to the probability of the patient having had a pulmonary embolism (the lower the score, the lower the probability): * <5 points indicates a low probability of PE * 5 - 8 points indicates a moderate probability of PE * >8 points indicates a high probability of PE ==Revised Geneva Score== More recently, the revised Geneva score has been introduced. This simplifies the scoring process, and has also been shown to be as effective as the Wells score. The revised score uses 8 parameters, but does not include figures which require an arterial blood gas sample to be performed: { class= border=1 !Variable !Score - Age 65 years or over 1 - Previous DVT or PE 3 - Surgery or fracture within 1 month 2 - Active malignant condition style=\\"text- align:center\\"2 - Unilateral lower limb pain 3 - Hemoptysis 2 - Heart rate 75 to 94 beats per minute 3 - Heart rate 95 or more beats per minute 5 - Pain on deep palpation of lower limb and unilateral edema 4 } The score obtained relates to probability of PE: * 0 - 3 points indicates low probability (8%) * 4 - 10 points indicates intermediate probability (29%) * 11 points or more indicates high probability (74%) The probabilities derived from the scoring systems can be used to determine the need for, and nature of, further investigations such as D-dimer, ventilation/perfusion scanning and CT pulmonary angiography to confirm or refute the diagnosis of PE. ==Simplified Geneva Score== A newer revision referred to as the simplified revised Geneva score has been prospectively studied and reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine on October 27 of 2008. The simplified scoring system replaced the weighted scores for each parameter with a 1-point score for each parameter present to reduce the likelihood of error when the score is used in a clinical setting. The report noted that the simplified Geneva score does not lead to a decrease in diagnostic utility in evaluating patients for a PE when compared to previous Geneva scores. The simplified Geneva score: { class= border=1 !Variable !Score - Age >65 1 - Previous DVT or PE 1 - Surgery or fracture within 1 month 1 - Active malignancy style=\\"text- align:center\\"1 - Unilateral lower limb pain 1 - Hemoptysis 1 - Pain on deep vein palpation of lower limb and unilateral edema 1 - Heart rate 75 to 94 bpm 1 - Heart rate greater than 94 bpm 2 } Patients with a score of 2 or less are considered unlikely to have a current PE. Authors suggest that the likelihood of patients having a PE with a simplified Geneva score less than 2 and a normal D-Dimer is 3 percent. ==References Online Calculator of the Revised Geneva Score Category:Diagnostic intensive care medicine Category:Medical scoring system ","title":"Geneva score"},{"id":"20359900","text":"An abstract strategy game is a board, card or other game where game play does not simulate a real world theme, and a player's decisions affect the outcome.

Capture games have as a central goal the idea of capturing all of the opponents pieces before they can capture yours. The rules for how a capture is accomplished vary greatly. A classic example of this category is checkers. The two most common forms of capture are jump (one piece jumps an opponent's piece) and surrounds (one piece is surrounded by two or more opponent pieces).

A classic example of this category are the various Mancala games. *Chopsticks *Mancala and related games == Positional games == 'This category is in development, while we re-analyze the collection of games listed under \\"Other Games\\". Positional games allow no captures, but require some arrangement of pieces that constitutes a \\"win\\".

After spending his early career with Braga and Porto, appearing sparingly for both, he travelled abroad in 2011, going on to represent clubs in England, Cyprus, Poland, Israel, Belgium, China and Spain and win the Ekstraklasa and the Polish Cup with Legia Warsaw. Sá earned one cap for Portugal. ==Club careerBraga=== Sá was born in Barcelos, Braga District. He started his career in the youth ranks of S.C. Braga, and was promoted to the first team for the 2007–08 season only to be loaned immediately to lowly SC Maria da Fonte (third division). Sá returned to Braga in 2008, making his Primeira Liga debut on 5 January 2009 by playing one minute in a 2–0 home win against C.F. Os Belenenses. He scored his first goal in the competition on 8 March, as a late substitute in a 2–2 draw at C.F. Estrela da Amadora. During his period in Braga, Sá gained attention from English club Chelsea, but nothing ever materialised. ===Porto=== On 1 June 2009, Sá moved to league champions FC Porto for an estimated fee of €3 million. Braga retained 20% economic rights on any future transfer fee, with an additional 20% being held by unknown parties. Having arrived still injured from his previous club, he only made his competitive debut on 2 January 2010, starting in a 2–0 away victory over U.D. Oliveirense in the fourth round of the Taça de Portugal. Sá spent 2010–11 on loan to C.D. Nacional, appearing sparingly due to injury and technical decisions. His highlight was scoring the winner in a 2–1 home defeat of S.L. Benfica on 21 August 2010, and he finished the season with six official goals, plus one for the Portuguese under-23. ===Fulham=== At the end of the 2011 transfer window, Sá joined Premier League club Fulham on a free transfer, with Porto retaining 25% of his economic rights. He made his official debut for his new team in a Football League Cup tie against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 21 September (penalty shootout loss), and first appeared in the Premier League at West Bromwich Albion three days later, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–0 draw. Sá scored his first and only goal for Fulham on 31 December 2011, putting the visitors ahead in the seventh minute of the tie against Norwich City, in an eventual 1–1 draw. Early into the season, he struggled with the pace of the English game, but went on to adapt physically after a few months in the country, also stating he was improving his ability in the English language. Before the 2012–13 campaign started, Sá said he was going to improve at Fulham and told the club's official website: \\"I feel that this is a really important pre-season for me, I want to be really prepared ahead of the new campaign because I want this year to be my year. I hope that I can score more goals like the one I got against Norwich. That was a good moment for me and I hope I will have many more moments like the one I experienced at Carrow Road\\". On 30 June 2012, however, his contract was terminated by mutual agreement. ===AEL Limassol=== On 30 July 2012, Sá signed a three-year contract with AEL Limassol. He scored his first goal in European competition on 6 December, helping his team achieve a 3–0 home win against Olympique de Marseille in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League. Sá kickstarted the 2013–14 campaign by netting five times in only three Cypriot First Division matches. Coincidentally, the three opponents that suffered his accuracy in the first round of matches, Ethnikos Achna FC, APOEL FC and Enosis Neon Paralimni FC, met the same fate in the second. ===Legia Warsaw=== Sá in action for Legia in October 2014 On 14 February 2014, Sá moved to Poland by joining Legia Warsaw on a three-and-a-half-year deal. He had arrived in Warsaw to undergo a medical the previous day. Sá made his Ekstraklasa debut on 22 February 2014, in a 3–0 win over Górnik Zabrze. He scored his first goal on the last day of the regular season and contributed to a 3–1 victory at Zagłębie Lubin, as the Legionaires eventually won their tenth national championship. ===Reading=== On 29 June 2015, Sá signed for Reading on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut for the club on 8 August in the season opener away to Birmingham City, having an added-time penalty saved by Tomasz Kuszczak in a 1–2 Championship defeat. Sá scored his first goal on 29 August, heading home in a 3–1 away win against Brentford. In the following match, he hit a hat- trick in a 5–1 rout of Ipswich Town at the Madejski Stadium. He totalled five goals from 21 appearances across all competitions, with his presence eventually limited by new manager Brian McDermott. ===Maccabi and Standard=== On 26 January 2016, Sá signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. for an undisclosed fee. On 31 August, however, he joined Standard Liège for four seasons. He scored a career-best 17 goals – 20 across all competitions – in his first season with the latter, but they could only finish in ninth position in the Belgian First Division A.

It was a reading primer and was one of the first books to differentiate between reading age groups, and which was widely used until the 1890s. ==Description== The work was originally published in two volumes – one for children from three to five years, and the second for those from five and eight, but later editions combined them into one. It consisted of a series of short, illustrated dialogues between children, teaching basic reading skills. It was an innovative book in several respects as it focused on the child reader’s own experience and interests, including toys, pets, games, visits to the fair etc., and was one of the first books to differentiate between reading age groups; each volume became progressively more difficult as the child progressed. The early editions were printed in large types containing charming woodcut illustrations, and each volume had an engraved frontispiece seeking to represent the content of the stories. ==Background== The book was conceived as a component part of the author’s elaborate and very expensive teaching scheme known as 'A set of toys', and copies were provided with the scheme, but Mrs. Fenn's publisher John Marshall realized that the book might also be successful in its own right. It proved to be Marshall's most profitable title and he produced many undated editions, keeping the title constantly in print until about 1815. During this period the illustrations became progressively more worn and the work more carelessly printed. ==Later editions== Marshall assigned the copyright to Baldwin, Cradock, & Joy, who published new editions throughout the 1820s and 1830s, improving production standards and commissioning new versions of the illustrations. The Dublin printer John Rice pirated the work in 1794, and in 1799 Marshall’s rival, Elizabeth Newbery, published an un-illustrated French language version. Copies of the original edition were exported to the USA where they were copied in editions published in Philadelphia by Johnson & Warner, (1813 and 1814), in Baltimore by E. J. Coale, (1825), in New York City by Mahlon Day, (between 1832 and 1837), and in New York and Boston by C.S. and J.H. Francis in 1851. Meanwhile, in the Britain, Darton and Co. published several editions between 1842 and 1858, and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) others between 1844 and 1860, which were adapted to include a religious message. Lockwood and Co. took over the publication in 1862. An edition with a coloured lithographic frontispiece was jointly published by Frederick Warne in London and Scribner, Welford, and Co. in New York in 1870, which was republished in 1894 by Warne. George Routledge and Sons published an edition in 1871, and Crosby Lockwood in 1885. An imitation New cobwebs to catch little flies was also published by the Religious Tract Society, between 1833 and 1839. ==References== *David Stoker, Cobwebs to catch flies a bibliographical case study Children's Book History Society, (2008). *Charles Welsh, 'A forgotten primer and its author', The Bibliographer (New York), I.

It can almost be considered a remake from the 1983 film Deathstalker. It stars the American bodybuilder, wrestler and actor Michael O'Hearn and Martin Kove, and also R&B; singer Cassie Ventura had a bit part in the film. ==Plot== Kane (Michael O'Hearn), a strong and lonesome barbarian. One day, he saves a damsel (Ekaterina Drobish) and Wooby (Yuri Danilchenko), a small, bear like creature, resembling an Ewok from Star Wars, from some brigands. A witch tells him of Munkar and his reign of terror, and about three powerful artefacts, the Amulet of Life, possessed by Princess Gretchen, King Kandor's daughter who was being held on Munkar's castle, the Sword of Justice and the Chalice of Magic. Unfortunately, the Chalice of Magic was already under the possession of Munkar, and he used it to raise his dark army and to watch Kane, and if finds the other two artefacts, he'd become invincible and enslave mankind. The witch tells him the Sword of Justice is located in the Martak Ruins. He goes there with Wooby, only to be ambushed by Munkar's soldiers, but he is aided in the fight by Gilda, the last of Amazon warriors. She tells Kane that her clan kept the sword safe for 50 generations, in the Cave of Last Echoes, where Amazons by tradition are not allowed. Gilda joins the quest and they ride for the cave, unaware of the Dark Prince, Munkar's enforcer, who was sneaking on them. Kane enters the cave with Wooby, they find the Sword of Justice. The Dark Prince knocks out Wooby and confronts Kane, and the outcome is Kane's victory, as he wounds the Dark Prince with the Sword of Justice and the latter flees. Kane and the others meet King Kandor, the true sovereign of those lands, dethroned by Munkar. Kandor offers the help of Zigrid, who joins them. Zigrid tells them of his plan to infiltrate Munkar's fortress, find the Amulet of Life and put an end to the malign sorcerer's reign. There would be a tournament in his castle, and the victor would become Munkar's general and be granted immortality through his powers. They head for the fortress, passing through a village under attack by Munkar's forces. Gilda and Wooby are taken away, and Kane slays the Dark Prince. Wooby frees himself and sneaks around the palace, hiding from the guards, while Gilda meets Gretchen in Munkar's harem, and also Ilsa and Sevra, two arrogant slaves who thought they were Munkar's favourites. One night yester to the tournament there's a great orgy for the fighters, and Munkar himself salutes them. Kane is masked to avoid detection, and Zigrid tells he has a bounty on his head. The next day, the tournament begins. Kane, wins several fights. Zigrid also proves to be a fighter of worth, making his way into the finals of the tournament. After the tournament, Kane orders Wooby to supply the harem girls with kitchen utensils that could be used as weapons. Munkar requests Zigrid's attention. He tempts Zigrid to kill Kane and bring him his sword, in exchange for the love of Gretchen, taking advantage of his feelings of envy of Kane, who was also in love with Gretchen and vice versa. Zigrid then goes to Kane's chamber and gives him poisoned food. Wooby returns to Kane to find him possibly dead. He then takes a long journey back to a desert, and comes back with a healing flower that restores his health. Zigrid wins the tournament and gives Munkar the sword and takes Gretchen as his maiden of choice, meanwhile the harem girls make their breakout, and Kane learns of the Amulet of Life hidden by Gretchen inside the mouth of a dragon statue, and he grabs it. Zigrid lies to Gretchen that Munkar killed Kane and they must run away, but Gretchen declines such plans. But then she finds Kane alive and well, and discovers Zigrid's betrayal. Kane fights Zigrid and defeats him, but Munkar appears and takes the Amulet of Life, finally reuniting the three artifacts, and he is turned into a monstrous and powerful himself, with superhuman strength and speed, and fights Kane. There are two interventions in the fight: one from the witch, who is presumably killed by Munkar; and from Gretchen that kills him with the Sword of Justice he dropped. At the end, King Kandor takes back the throne and Kane and Gretchen become lovers. ==Cast== *Michael O'Hearn as Kane *Irina Grigoryeva as Princess Gretchen *Martin Kove as Munkar *Svetlana Metkina as Gilda *Yuri Danilchenko as Wooby *Aleksandr Dyachenko as Zigrid *Dmitri Shevchenko as Kristo *Irina Karra as Ilsa *Evelina Bledans as Sevra *Yevdokiya Germanova - Witch *Yuriy Dumchev as Dark Prince *Yuri Petrov as King Kandor ==Reception== The movie scored mostly negative critics, and it was classified by many as mediocre or \\"average\\" at best, very few found it a good film.

He served as the second General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain from 1925 to 1932. ==Early life and political activities== Bullejos earned a university law degree. Gaining a job as a postal clerk in Bilbao he joined in the postal strike of 1918-19 and joined the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) trade union.Lazitch, B. and M.M. Drachkovitch. Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern. Stanford: Hoover Institution Press, 1986. p 53. (Retrieved via Google Books 10/29/10). He also participated in the original Spanish Communist Party formed in 1920 and remained with the party after it merged with another communist organization, the Spanish Communist Workers' Party, in 1921 (forming the new Communist Party of Spain or PCE). Heading the party's Vizcayan section,Payne, S.G. The Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union, and Communism. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004. p 18. he advanced to the leadership position upon the arrest of the first general secretary, Antonio García Quejido, in January 1925. Bullejos would continue to hold the top post for nearly eight years. ==General secretary of the PCE== Inheriting a politically divided party, Bullejos attempted to unify the disparate factions, achieving greater unity in Madrid but having less success with the PCE-affiliated FCC-B in Barcelona. He also conducted a purge of politically suspect members, which weakened the already divided party further. Bullejos was himself arrested in 1928 and temporarily replaced as leader of the PCE by Gabriel León Trilla. Antonio Garcia Quejido, a printing worker, (1856–1927), 1st General Secretary of the Spanish Communist Party, a Spanish Socialism branch, founded in 1921 Bullejos struggled to maintain PCE relations not only with other Spanish leftists, but with the Soviet Union. Visiting Moscow with other PCE leaders in May 1931, Bullejos was astonished when asked by Comintern official Dmitry Manuilsky whether in Spain feudal lords still forced Spanish peasants to do unpaid labor; he was further told that, \\"there is more feudalism in Spain than you think.\\" Bullejos told Manuilsky that there were no overt remnants of feudalism in his country but failed to convince him that the \\"revolution\\" in Spain was opposed not by feudal monarchists but by a modern bourgeoisie. He was re-confirmed as general-secretary at the PCE's fourth party congress in Seville in March 1932. When Bullejos and other PCE leaders backed the Republican government against the sanjurjada coup in August and produced pro-Republic slogans, Victorio Codovilla, the Comintern advisor in Madrid, denounced him and two other leaders as counter-revolutionaries. Bullejos resigned his post. When an initial vote failed to officially condemn him as counter-revolutionary, he was called to Moscow. In his absence, Codovilla arranged a new vote which settled the matter and completely denounced Bullejos and the others, who were then expelled from the PCE in October. The general secretaryship passed to José Díaz Ramos. ==Post PCE== Following his expulsion from the PCE and Comintern, José Bullejos joined the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). With the end of the civil war and the defeat of the Second Republic by the forces of Francisco Franco he fled to Mexico. There in 1945 he published a book entitled Europa entre dos guerras, 1918-1938. Later he wrote several more works including: Movimiento y Doctrina Sociales, La Comintern en España, and Espana en la segunda Republica.

The Life of Our Lord was published in 1934, 64 years after Dickens' death. A Christian, Dickens wrote The Life of Our Lord exclusively for his children, to whom he read it aloud every Christmas. He strictly forbade publication of The Life during his own lifetime and begged his sister- in-law, Georgina Hogarth, to make sure that the Dickens family \\"would never even hand the manuscript, or a copy of it, to anyone to take out of the house.\\" His handwritten manuscript was passed down to Georgina Hogarth after Dickens's death in 1870. On her death in 1917, it came into the possession of Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, Dickens's last surviving son. The Dickens family continued to read it at every Christmas and, at the author's request, delayed publication until the last of Dickens's children had died. The book begins: > My Dear Children, I am very anxious that you should know something about the > History of Jesus Christ. For everybody ought to know about Him. No one ever > lived who was so good, so kind, so gentle, and so sorry for all people who > did wrong, or were in any way ill or miserable, as He was. There then follows a simple account of Jesus's life and teachings, with an occasional touch of Dickens's humour: \\"You never saw a locust, because they belong to that country near Jerusalem, which is a great way off. So do camels, but I think you have seen a camel. At all events, they are brought over here, sometimes; and if you would like to see one, I will show you one.\\" Occasionally, Victorian attitudes are apparent -- Dickens writes that the Jewish Sabbath was Sunday, that Jews were \\"very ignorant and passionate,\\" and also that \\"they were very proud, and believed that no people were good but themselves.\\" In the remainder of the book Dickens concentrates on the miracles Jesus performed and on the lessons in charity, forgiveness, and compassion from which Christians can learn. On the death of Sir Henry Fielding Dickens in 1933, his will provided that, if the majority of his family were in favour of publication, The Life of Our Lord should be given to the world. By majority vote, Sir Henry's widow and children decided to publish the book in London. Through Curtis Brown Ltd., London literary agents, Lady Dickens sold world publication rights for The Life of Our Lord to the Daily Mail for $210,000. The first serial rights for North and South America went to United Feature Syndicate Inc., whose General Manager Monte Bourjaily outbid King Features Syndicate, Bell Syndicate, NANA, and NEA. United Features promptly resold The Life of Our Lord to a sufficient number of United States newspapers to avoid giving first publication to a magazine. It was first published, in serial form, in March 1934. In 1934, Simon & Schuster published the first American edition, which became one of the year's biggest bestsellers. In the United Kingdom it was published by Associated Newspapers Ltd, also in 1934. Dickens's original manuscript was purchased by a group of private collectors and in 1964 was presented to the Free Library of Philadelphia, which has held it ever since. To Begin With, an adaptation of The Life of Our Lord by Jeffrey Hatcher was performed by the author's great great grandson Gerald Charles Dickens in 2015 at the Music Box Theatre in Minneapolis. The play was revived in 2017. ==References * (ePUB and Kindle versions) * (subscription required) Category:Books published posthumously Category:1934 books Category:Books by Charles Dickens Category:Books about Jesus Category:Works originally published in American newspapers Category:Books based on the Bible Category:Books adapted into plays ","title":"The Life of Our Lord"},{"id":"20360250","text":"Frank Aloysius Scanlan (April 28, 1890 – April 9, 1969), was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played in with the Philadelphia Phillies.

It was formed in 1903 and organized non-professional football in Santiago. Later on, it was the organization responsible for holding the national professional football league in Chile. ==HistoryEstablishment=== In the early twentieth century, in Santiago there did not exist any organization for the various college football clubs that were emerging and therefore no any football tournament was contested, unlike what happened in Valparaiso, where competitions were held by the Football Association of Chile since 1895 and there was a championship each year. In the capital, matches were limited to football friendlies, and there was a lack of organization to unify the rules, and it was also very common for players to continually change their club. Faced with the growing number of teams (around 50), it was \\"... essential to the formation of the Association in Santiago.\\" \\"El Mercurio\\", April 15, 1903, Santiago, Chile. The Asociación de Fútbol de Santiago (AFS) was founded on 15 May 1903, in the building of the Commodities Exchange (Bolsa de Comercio), where there came representatives of 14 football clubs in Santiago. The first Board of Directors of the AFS was formed by July Subercaseaux (Santiago National) as Honorary President, Jose A. Alfonso (Atlético Unión) as Chairman; Oscar Diener (Santiago National) as Treasurer; Jorge D. Ewing (Atlético Unión) as Secretary; and Luis de la Carrera (Thunder) as Pro-Secretary. At its first ordinary meeting, the recent Board of Directors, in the presence of representatives from 16 clubs which agreed to restrict the enrollment of the tournament, divided the clubs into two categories owing to the large number of teams. A First Division, including Thunder, Santiago National, Atlético Unión, Britania, Victoria and the Instituto Pedagógico, and a Second Division, comprising the Victoria Rangers, Brasil F.C., Chilean Star, Chile F.C., Cambridge, Bandera de Chile, Balmaceda F.C., Victorioso, Wilmington and the second team of Thunder, were set up. \\"El Mercurio\\", May 26, 1903, Santiago, Chile. The first football championship played in Santiago, called Copa Subercaseaux in honor of the Honorary Chairman of the AFS who donated the trophy, commenced on May 31, 1903, before a presence of \\"... no fewer than three thousand people.\\" \\"El Mercurio\\", June 1, 1903, Santiago, Chile. The first champions of this tournament were Atlético Unión, while the tournament champion of Second Division, called the Copa Junior, was the Victoria Rangers. In 1906 the Copa Subercaseaux was renamed Copa Unión. In 1904, a team called Baquedano is accepted as a member of the tournament, who changed its name to Magallanes Atlético after a few months, moving quickly renamed Magallanes Football Club, and, in 1922, Club Social y Deportivo Magallanes. Later on it was one of the founders of professionalism in Chile, and was the first champion of the Primera División de Chile in 1933. Santa Cruz Achurra, Eduardo: \\"Un siglo de Magallanes. De alegrías y pesares\\", vol. I, 1997, Imprenta Futura, Santiago. ===Other football organizations=== Initially, the AFS had no desire to create an organization that was integrating the multitude of clubs that were forming in the capital, but rather just restricting to a certain type of clubs. Following this, emerged in the early years of the twentieth century, there were several football associations in Santiago, among which were the Asociación Arturo Prat (1905), the Asociación Obrera de Fútbol (1906), the Asociación José Arrieta (1907), the Asociación Nacional de Fútbol (1908), the Liga Santiago(1914) and the Liga Metropolitana (1916), among others. Asociación Arturo Prat (AAP), for example, was founded on July 4, 1905, by the councilor Arturo Izquierdo Cerda, and was organized by the Municipality of Santiago. It was established with the primary objective \\"... to spread the game of foot ball and other athletic exercises between the working class and the students.\\" \\"El Mercurio\\", June 5, 1905, Santiago de Chile. Despite the municipal support, the AAP was unable to match the might of the AFS, founded two years earlier, and could only concentrated its activity on school football and was losing prominence over the years. Some of its best teams joined the AFS, such as Gimnástico and the Arco Iris F.C.. Finally, the AAP was dissolved in 1912. The main legacy left by the AAP, along with expanding the spread of football to other sectors of society, was the activity of a number of clubs made up of students, for example, Escuela de Artes y Oficios, the Escuela de Minería and the Internado F.C.; and the workers club Gutemberg F.C., Gimnástico F.C. and Arco Iris F.C. Santa Cruz Achurra (1997) pp.36-37. ===After the unification of national football=== After the unification of the national football federations of which occurred in 1926, the championship is now called the Liga Central de Football (Central Football League). Because of the large number of teams, the championship was divided into different series in 1927 and 1928. The league was reorganized into three divisions, under which involved a total of 38 clubs, due to the great sporting and economic gap that existed between the various clubs in the league. In 1930, the championship called Santiago de Football Association again, and the First Division consisted of Audax Italiano, Unión Española, Colo-Colo, Carabineros, Magallanes, Santiago Badminton, Green Cross, Santiago Football Club, Santiago National and Gimnástico Arturo Prat. In late 1932 the conflict between the so-called big clubs and AFS became untenable, thus causing the split of the clubs to form the professional league, named Liga Profesional de Fútbol (LPF). While initially the AFS refused to recognize the new organization, in 1934, by the provision of the Federación de Fútbol de Chile, it became part of AFS. ==References== Category:Sport in Santiago Category:Association football governing bodies in Chile Category:1903 establishments in Chile Category:Sports organizations established in 1903 ","title":"Asociación de Fútbol de Santiago"},{"id":"20360326","text":"Louis Rene Gaiennie (June 9, 1878 - November 25, 1942) was a United States Marine who earned the Medal of Honor for his actions as part of the China Relief Expedition from July 21 to August 17, 1900, in Peking, China, during the Boxer Rebellion.

She is a law professor at the Chapman University School of Law. ==Education== She attended the University of Wyoming from 1992 to 1999, receiving a B.A. (1996) and a J.D. (1999) from the University of Wyoming College of Law. ==Career== From 2000 through 2003, Rotunda served on active duty as an officer in the US Army JAG Corps and then served in the Individual Ready Reserve until 2008. She held the rank of Major in the Army. She is notable for her military service related to Guantanamo Bay, first as a Legal Advisor to the Guantanamo Detention Camp Commander, later as a legal advisor to the Department of Defense Criminal Investigation Task Force, then as a Prosecutor for the Guantanamo Military Commissions. In 2008, she published a book about her experience, titled Honor Bound: Inside the Guantanamo Trials. Rotunda is also the author of a Law School Textbook entitled Military & Veterans Law, published by Thomson West Publishing, 2011. From 2003 to 2005, Rotunda was the Wyoming State Planning Coordinator and served as a legal and policy advisor to then-Governor, and headed up the Governor's policy team. Dave Freudenthal. In 2006, she became a law professor at the George Mason University School of Law, where she was the Director of a pro bono law clinic for military personnel and veterans. In 2008, Rotunda and her then-husband Ronald Rotunda joined a list of former faculty of George Mason University who took positions at the Chapman University School of Law. They divorced in 2014. She developed and heads the Chapman pro bono law clinic for military personnel and veterans. In 2009 was named as a lecturer at University of California, Berkeley, School of Law (Boalt Hall), where she assisted in starting a similar clinic which she now teaches. Rotunda has written and spoken as an advocate for military troops. Her op-eds have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the Christian Science Monitor, The New York Sun, The Chicago Tribune, The Washington Times, The Orange County Register, and others. She has appeared on national and international television news programs including Al Jazeera, Hannity's America, and The Brit Hume Report. Rotunda's television interview on Dialogue with Doti and Dodge was awarded a Bronze Telly Award in 2009. In September 2008, Rotunda testified before Congress about restoring the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay and various legal issues impacting the troops. ==Honor Bound: Inside the Guantanamo Trials== Honor Bound offers a behind the scenes look at the inner workings of the War on Terror, in the context of the personal narrative of a Judge Advocate. It received positive and negative critical notice. ===Positive notice=== Jacket blurbs included praise from scholars and litigators including former Solicitor General Theodore Olson who called it \\"immensely readable and stunningly valuable...\\" Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese stated, \\"U.S. Army Captain (now Major) Kyndra Rotunda was at the center of the most important and controversial legal issues in the war, including the difficulties of detaining and prosecuting terrorists while traditional war is being redefined.\\" Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz said in a jacket blurb, \\"This eye-opening inside account must be read by everyone who cares about balancing national security and human dignity.\\" Rotunda disagrees with Dershowitz on the topic of torture. Dershowitz maintains that the law should be introduced to permit civil judges to issue limited \\"torture warrant\\", under special circumstances, like the \\"ticking time bomb\\" scenario. In her book Rotunda generally rejects torture as a legitimate interrogation tactic and calls Dershowitz's \\"ticking time bomb\\" hypothetical \\"inherently imperfect because it assumes what we cannot know. If the detaine does not disclose the information sought, is it because he truly does not know, or is it because the interrogator has not applied a sufficient amount of torture?\\" === Negative notice=== Toronto Star reporter Michelle Shephard, author of Guantanamo's Child: The Untold Story of Omar Khadr critiqued five Guantanamo-related books, including Rotunda's Honor Bound which she called \\"... a poorly written personal account of an Army JAG that glosses over critical events in Guantanamo's history with offhand dismissals.\\" Shephard continued, \\"There is some interesting legal stuff to ponder – such as how and why has the U.S. administration exceeded or sidestepped the protections of the international Geneva Conventions ...\\". Specialist in Constitutional Law at the Library of Congress Louis Fisher wrote that as a JAG officer, Rotunda had \\"a good opportunity to understand the military commissions underway at \\"Gitmo\\" and correct misconceptions about the procedures.\\" About the book, he wrote, \\"For readers hoping for an even-handed assessment, the initial appearance is not promising.\\" Fisher quotes Shepard's statement that the U.S. erred in \\"imposing rules that made it difficult for prosecutors to respond to defense counsel claims ...\\", and states that \\"The book never explains what constraints existed ...\\". Of Rotunda's statement that the U.S. erred by \\"giving detainees more rights than the Geneva Conventions require\\", Fisher states \\"They needed them. Unlike prisoners of war, who are released after a war and do not face trial, the detainees were subject to prosecution and possibly the death sentence\\". ==Comments on the Supreme Court's Boumedienne ruling== In June 2008 the Supreme Court overturned portions of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Rotunda authored an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune entitled \\"Supreme Court Ruling Puts Soldiers at Great Risk\\", which criticized aspects of the Supreme Court's ruling. In the years since the ruling Rotunda has appeared on numerous academic panels and has published several academic articles discussing, and analyzing, the Boumediene decision, and other decisions related to Guantanamo Bay. In the National Review, Peter Pham stated that Rotunda had more years of military service than all the nine Supreme Court Justices put together. According to Pham, Rotunda's position was that: ==2008 Testimony before a Senate Judicial Subcommittee== In September 2008 Rotunda testified before a subcommittee of the United States Senate's Judicial Committee. mirror In her testimony Rotunda cited incidents where U.S. prison guards were attacked by detainees and where U.S. officials, contrary to U.S. and International Law, made some areas \\"off limits\\" to U.S. guards maintaining detention camps. She discussed one incident in Camp Bucca, Iraq, which led detainees to attack from the inside out and resulted in a bloody four-day standoff. Rotunda supported religious freedoms for detainees, but opined that making prison areas and detainee personal items \\"off limits\\" to searches by U.S. prison guards has led to violence and has put guards at risk. She also pointed-out that it was contrary to U.S. Law. In her testimony before Congress, Rotunda also criticized the U.S. Army for limiting the duties of female military police officers serving in Guantanamo Bay, arguing that the U.S. Military should allow female and male officers alike to perform their duties without imposing limitations based on gender. ==2011 Muslim Headscarf Controversy== In March 2011, Rotunda weighed in on a controversy over whether their superiors should have encouraged female GIs in Afghanistan and Iraq to wear Muslim head-scarves while deployed to Iraq. stating that anyone familiar with military culture understood this suggestion was tantamount to an order, which inappropriately put female GIs at risk. On April 8, 2011, in a Chicago Tribune op-ed about those risks, Rotunda triggered controversy. Rotunda pointed out that photographs, released by the U.S. Military and published in the Washington Post, showed women wearing headscarves, in lieu of helmets, while on an armed patrol alongside male troops, who were wearing helmets. Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Michael Lawhorn disputed Rotunda's safety claims, stating that a helmet could be worn over top of a headscarf. According to Rotunda, the objections from Lieutenant Colonel Martha McSally, a female fighter pilot stationed in Saudi Arabia, had influenced Congress to pass an \\"anti-abaya law\\". But Rotunda said the 2003 law was specific to female GIs stationed in Saudi Arabia, and that it had expired. She recommended that Congress reauthorize a similar law to protect female troops in the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. ==Litigation== Rotunda became involved in high-profile legal issues and litigation stemming from the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. In 2003, she was a lawyer assigned to Private Jessica Lynch after Lynch's rescue in Iraq. In December 2011, Rotunda took on the U.S. Air Force for its allegedly illegal termination of 157 Air Force Officers on the eve of retirement. On December 28, 2011, Rotunda exposed the Air Force in a Wall Street Journal op- ed entitled The Air Force Grounds Its Officers, stating, \\"This holiday season, the Air Force has 'separated' (that is, fired) 157 officers on the eve of their retirement, including pilots flying dangerous missions, to avoid paying their pensions.\\" She goes on to urge Congress to enact a law that would provide pro-rated retirement to these 157 officers and comments, \\"America's heroes have our backs.

It is located from San Luis, capital city of the San Luis Province, Argentina. The circuit is semi- permanent, with a length of . It was created by modifying the ring road that encircles Lake Potrero de los Funes, at the course's center. The circuit has received very high praise from the drivers for its substantial undulations and numerous high speed corners and bends, which provide a great driving challenge. The track's layout has changed slightly from its original layout. It appears that the curve prior to where the pits are now was tightened to create a more pronounced corner ahead of the pits, and perhaps to reduce speeds on the racing line going past the new pit exit. On the opposite side of the lake, where start/finish used to be located, a chicane has been added at the first high speed bend along that stretch. Also, on the initial descending run along the lake, there has been another chicane added to reduce speeds into the following corner that has limited run-off. Therefore, the original course had slightly shorter length of 6.186 km (3.844 mi). ==Races hosted== According to Damian Vega's account, a meet was held at this circuit on August 15, 1987. The main event was a Turismo Carretera race. During one of the heat races, a crash occurred that resulted in the deaths of two spectators. In the feature race, there was another crash, but the driver survived, though he may have been injured. This was the circuit's only meeting until the FIA GT weekend was held in November 2008. On the track's reopening, two major events were hosted in November 2008. A race weekend was shared by the Argentinian TC 2000 as well as the international FIA GT Championship.

Amyris's products include ingredients for cosmetics, flavors, and fragrances. Amyris owns three brands: Biossance and Pipette, for beauty and baby skincare, and Purecane, a sugar substitute. The company went public on NASDAQ on September 28, 2010 (AMRS). In 2003 Amyris developed their first molecule, Artemisinin, in partnership with Institute for OneWorld Health, who received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Amyris Biotechnologies and Sanofi were engaged to assist on certain parts of the project, using technology based from UC Berkeley, NRC Canada, and other sources. == Artemisinin == Artemisinin is a compound naturally found in Artemisia annua, Chinese sweet wormwood, and is widely used in the treatment of malaria. Developed through biotechnology, the patented fermentation process renders a more efficient means to manufacturing the treatment than from the agricultural source. == Squalane == Through the same technology that created the artemisinin molecule, a new yeast pathway led to the development of the cosmetic ingredient, squalane. Used by major cosmetic companies globally as a skin moisturizer, the ingredient was originally obtained from shark liver. Squalane is found in Biossance and Pipette brands. == Reb M == Through fermentation Amyris developed Reb M (rebaudioside M), a steviol glycoside naturally found small quantities in the stevia plant Stevia rebaudiana. It is does not contribute a bitter aftertaste as Reb A, the more commonly used sweetening component commonly associated with stevia sweeteners. Reb M is found in Purecane Brand Sweetener. == Other Molecules == Several new molecules have been developed using the original fermentation process including flavors, fragrances, CBD, CBG and bisabolol. == Vaccine Adjuvant == Amyris joined partnership with IDRI (Infectious Disease Research Institute) in July, 2020 for a planned COVID-19 RNA (ribonucleic acid) vaccine technology program. The program combines IDRI's expertise in combating infectious diseases with Amyris' fermentation platform technology, with the goal to create semi- synthetic squalene-based adjuvants at scale. IDRI's RNA vaccine platform is expected to offer significant differentiated advantages over other RNA vaccines currently in development and will be further enhanced by a scalable Amyris adjuvant. == Media coverage == *Using Microbes to create the Next Generation of Fuels on CNN The Next List (February 2013) *A Better Biofuel on MIT Technology Review (April 2007) *Bets on Biotech on US News (November 2006) ==ReferencesExternal links == *Official website Category:Companies based in Emeryville, California Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States Category:Biotechnology companies established in 2003 Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:2003 establishments in California Category:American companies established in 2003 ","title":"Amyris (company)"},{"id":"20360517","text":"Frederick Lewis Pratten, born on 13 February 1904 at Midsomer Norton, http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db;=pjc4ax&id;=I12023 Somerset, where he also died on 23 February 1967, was a cricketer who played 12 first-class matches for Somerset in 1930 and 1931.

Among those present were Connie Carroll Runai E.K.B, Pa Doyle, Gerald Landers, Brother Justin, Derry Crowley, Johnny Culloty, Michaell Culloty, Tadhgie Fleming, Joe Doherty, Liam McGuire Tom Holohan, and Noel O'Connor. It was decided that the name of the Club would be St. Patricks East Kerry GAA Club. The Club has enjoyed varying levels of success with the winning of the Kerry Intermediate Hurling Championship in 1983 and 1990 and the County League division 2 in 1985, being chief among them. ==Honours== * Kerry Intermediate Hurling Championship: (2) 1983, 1990 * Kerry Junior Hurling Championship: (4) 2007, 2010, 2013, 2014 * Kerry Novice Hurling Championship: (1) 2004 * Kerry Hurling League Div 2: (1) 1985 ==References== Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Kerry Category:Hurling clubs in County Kerry Category:1982 establishments in Ireland ","title":"St Patrick's GAA (Kerry)"},{"id":"20360684","text":"The Colonial League was a mid-level American minor baseball league that existed from 1947 through mid-July 1950. It was graded Class B, four levels below the Major Leagues, and featured teams in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. The Colonial was one of many minor leagues that briefly existed during the post-World War II baseball boom. It competed in the Northeastern U.S. with five Major League clubs in New York and New England, established minor leagues such as the International League, Eastern League, Canadian–American League and PONY League, and other fledgling circuits such as the postwar New England League and Border League. As a whole, the Colonial was rarely adopted as a site for farm teams for MLB clubs. Only two of its member teams (the 1948 Bridgeport Bees and Port Chester Clippers) ever affiliated with a big league parent club (the Washington Senators and St. Louis Browns, respectively). As the minors began to contract in the late 1940s, the Colonial League's days were numbered. It shut its doors on July 14, 1950, with only 80,000 fans reported to have attended games in the entire six-team circuit. ==Member teams== * Bridgeport Bees * Bristol Owls * Kingston Colonials * New Brunswick/Kingston Hubs * New London Raiders * Port Chester Clippers * Poughkeepsie Chiefs * Poughkeepsie Giants * Stamford Bombers * Stamford Pioneers * Torrington Braves * Waterbury Timers ==References== * Johnson, Lloyd, and Wolff, Miles, eds., The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball, 3rd edition.

It was a powerful program used for simulation of integrated circuit designs, and their analysis with statistical variations of the manufacturing process. In combination with the built-in Monte Carlo method capabilities it allowed prediction of the performance of electronic circuits under a wide range of material parameters and temperatures. ASTAP was designed to run on IBM Mainframe computers. Its algorithms were developed by IBM electrical engineers, especially Robert Brayton, Gary Hachtel, and Fred Gustavson. Unlike SPICE, which used Modified nodal analysis (MNA) to form the system of circuit equations, ASTAP instead used sparse tableau formulation (STA) to construct and solve a sparse matrix. The sparse tableau formulation produced very large, very sparse matrices which required special techniques to solve efficiently, even at that time. The advantage of STA for statistical analysis is that, as originally outlined, a subsequent analysis of a circuit with randomly varied parameters only required changing entries in the matrix. == References == Category:Simulation programming languages Category:Electronic circuit simulators ","title":"ASTAP"},{"id":"20360846","text":"Great Hockham is a village in the English county of Norfolk within the civil parish of Hockham , though the distinction between village and parish may now be moot as there is evidence to suggest that the other village in the parish, Little Hockham, consists only of a farmhouse.

The planners envisioned diverting water from some rivers in Alaska south through Canada via the Rocky Mountain Trench and other routes to the US and would involve 369 separate construction projects. The water would enter the US in northern Montana. There it would be diverted to the headwaters of rivers such as the Colorado River and the Yellowstone River. Implementation of NAWAPA has not been seriously considered since the 1970s, due to the array of environmental, economic and diplomatic issues raised by the proposal. Western historian William deBuys wrote that \\"NAWAPA died a victim of its own grandiosity.\\" ==The plan== A technical and economic blueprint for the plan was developed in 1964 by the Parsons Corporation of Pasadena, California.Captured Rain: America's Thirst for Canadian Water, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 2000 The total cost was estimated in 1975 as $100 billion, comparable in cost to the Interstate Highway System.Barr, L. (1975). NAWAPA: A Continental Water Development Scheme for North America? Geography 60(2), pp.111-119.Nelson, J.G. and Chambers, M.J., Water, Methuen Publications 1969, p.375 ===Water management=== The Parsons plan would divert water from the Yukon, Liard and Peace River systems into the southern half of the Rocky Mountain Trench which would be dammed into a massive, -long reservoir. Some of the water would be sent east across central Canada to form a navigable waterway connecting Alberta to the Great Lakes with the additional benefit of stabilizing the Great Lakes' water level. The rest of the water would enter the United States in northern Montana, providing additional flow to the Columbia and Missouri–Mississippi river systems, and would be pumped over the Rocky Mountains via the Sawtooth Lifts in Idaho. From there, it would run south via aqueducts to the Colorado River and Rio Grande systems. Some of this water would be sent around the southern end of the Rockies in New Mexico and pumped north to the High Plains, stabilizing the Ogallala Aquifer. The increased flow of the Colorado River, meanwhile, would enter Mexico, allowing for greater development of agriculture in Baja California and Sonora. The project would provide of water to water- deficient areas in the North American continent, including Canada and the United States, as well as irrigation water for Mexico, which Parsons claimed would receive enough water to reclaim 7 or 8 times more land than Egypt reclaimed with the Aswan High Dam.Ebeling, Walter, Fruited Plain: The Story of American Agriculture , Univ of California Press (February 1980), p. 319 It would provide increased water flow in the upper Missouri and Mississippi rivers during periods of low flow, increased hydropower generation along the Columbia River, and stabilize water levels in the Great Lakes.Nelson, J.G. and Chambers, M.J., Water, Methuen Publications 1969, p. 371 Parsons originally proposed using peaceful nuclear explosions to excavate trenches and underground water storage reservoirs for the system.Forest, B. & Forest, P. (2012). Engineering the North American waterscape: The high modernist mapping of continental water transfer project. Political Geography 31, pp. 167-183. ===Power generation=== The project would generate a vast amount of electricity from a number of hydroelectric and nuclear power facilities (the latter of which would be required to power the multiple pumping stations needed to move the water across the continent). The issue of electricity generation has created some controversy, with some commentators such as Marc Reisner arguing that the plan would be a net consumer of energy, while others estimate a net gain of 60 to 80 million kilowatts after meeting the needs for pumping.Engelbert, Ernest A, and Scheuring, Ann Foley, Water Scarcity: Impacts on Western Agriculture, Berkeley, University of California Press 1984, p. 113 ===Transportation=== The plan would potentially have included a navigable waterway in Canada from Alberta to Lake Superior, to be called the Transcontinental Canal. In addition to increasing availability of water, the canal would address problems of water pollution. == Environmental impacts == The engineering of the project and the creation of a large number of new reservoirs — many of them in designated wilderness areas — would have destroyed vast areas of wildlife habitat in Canada and the American West and would have required the relocation of hundreds of thousands of people — including the entire city of Prince George, British Columbia. A number of federally designated Wild and Scenic Rivers in Idaho and Montana would be submerged under reservoirs, including the Salmon, Lochsa, Clearwater, Yellowstone and Big Hole. The amount of electricity required to pump the water over the Rockies would require the construction of as many as six nuclear power plants. Significant negative consequences were also predicted for Pacific salmon runs in the many Alaskan and Canadian rivers that would be dammed and diverted, reducing their flows. Luna Leopold, a conservationist and professor of hydrology at the University of California, Berkeley said of NAWAPA, \\"The environmental damage that would be caused by that damned thing can't even be described. It would cause as much harm as all of the dam- building we have done in a hundred years.\\" ==Reception== NAWAPA garnered early support from some Western political figures, who viewed its promise of increased water supplies as key to continued growth in the Western United States. In 1966, Congressman Jim Wright, in his book, The Coming Water Famine, wrote that \\"NAWAPA has an almost limitless potential if we possess the courage and the foresight to grasp it.\\"Wright, Jim, The Coming Water Famine, Coward- McCann (1966), p. 222. In 1967, Senator Frank Moss of Utah wrote The Water Crisis, in which he called NAWAPA the most comprehensive water diversion proposal to solve supply and pollution problems.Moss, Frank, The Water Crisis, F. A. Praeger 1967, p. 245. (Moss was later hired by the Parsons Corporation and retained as a lobbyist.) Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich called for Los Angeles to back the plan. The Corps of Engineers studied this project in the 1950s and 1960s, but no official proposal was ever developed.Reisner, Marc. Cadillac Desert revised edition, 1993 Canadian Prime Minister Lester Pearson was quoted in 1966 saying of the plan that “This can be one of the most important developments in our history.\\"Congressional Record, Volume 112, Part 5 - Page 6474 In the 1970s, the plan began to encounter fierce opposition by a number of different groups on both sides of the border, based on concerns with its financial and environmental costs and the international implications of exporting Canadian water. The environmental movement, which viewed the plan as the \\"hydrologic anti-Christ,\\"Annin, Peter, The Great Lakes Water Wars, Island Press 2006, p. 58 gained momentum in the early 1970s, and is credited with playing a major role in halting the project.Steinberg, T. (2002). Down to Earth: Nature's role in American history. After initially expressing support for NAWAPA as Interior Secretary in the 1960s, Stewart Udall publicly ridiculed the plan after leaving office.McCool, Daniel, Command of the waters : iron triangles, federal water development, and Indian water, University of Arizona Press, 1994. p. 108 The project was opposed by public sentiment in Canada, though Canadian financier Simon Reisman, who negotiated the Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, was one of its backers and main promoters. Nonetheless, the Canadian position on free trade exempted water exports, in part specifically to pre-empt any attempted completion of Reisman's long-time pet project. The NAWAPA Foundation, which Parsons had founded to promote the scheme, closed its doors in 1990.Guide to North American Water and Power Alliance Records, Archives Center, National Museum of American History Environmental writer Marc Reisner noted in Cadillac Desert that the plan was one of \\"brutal magnificence\\" and \\"unprecedented destructiveness.\\" Historian Ted Steinberg suggested that NAWAPA summed up \\"the sheer arrogance and imperial ambitions of the modern hydraulic West\\" and credited rising costs and the rise of the environmental movement with killing the idea. One author called it \\"the most outlandish water development scheme to emerge in the past 50 years\\"Landry, C., Payne, M. & Root, S. (2012). Grandiose water development plans.

He organized the Leavitt Anti-Slavery Society and encouraged black churches to start similar groups, and was one of eight black pastors who founded the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. In 1838, he became a co-publisher and co-proprietor of the Colored American. He became the pastor of the Second African Presbyterian after its previous pastor died. A mob destroyed Second African Presbyterian in the 1842 race riots. ==Controversy== In 1844, Gloucester became the founding pastor at Lombard Street Central Presbyterian Church - a church that was formed after the congregation of Second Presbyterian split into two factions. This schism with other activists led Gloucester to concentrate on his church, which moved into the white, Greek Revival-style building on the 800 block of Lombard upon its completion in 1848. The church eventually dropped the \\"street\\" in its name and became known as Lombard Central Presbyterian.

She represented Uganda in Miss World 2008 in South Africa. ==Background== Mwima was born to Ugandan parents in 1990, in the Eastern Ugandan town of Tororo. Her father, a preacher, and the family migrated to neighboring Kenya when Dorah was about four years old. The family returned to Uganda in 2008, two weeks before the call for contestants in the Miss Uganda beauty competition went out. She applied and was accepted as a contestant. ==2008 Miss Uganda pageant== As Miss Uganda, Mwima represented her country in the Miss World peagnt held in South Africa, in December 2008. During her reign, she started the \\"Dora Mwima Foundation\\", a non-profit charitable organization. The NGO's primary objective is to provide a platform for single mothers and teenage girls \\"to share experiences on the challenges in life\\". Through her foundation, she organizes soccer matches, where the gate collections are used to assist pregnant rural mothers in need. During the last three months of her reign it came to light that Mwima had become pregnant. ==After 2008== She decided to keep the baby, making her a teenage unwed mother, because the relationship with the baby's father did not work out. She found work at Darling Hair Collection Uganda, as executive secretary and director of brand. When Mwima's baby was a few months old, a new general manager was posted to Uganda as Mwima's boss. In her role as executive secretary, one of her roles was to take care of corporate guests. The new boss was Nader Barrak, a native of Lebanon, in the Middle East. He and Mwima developed a friendship which blossomed into a romantic relationship. In 2013, Mwima resigned her job at the company, to eliminate the conflicts of interest. In December 2013, Mwima and Barrak were married in a civil ceremony, followed by a church ceremony on 25 May 2014. Their wedding made the cover of \\"Bride & Groom\\", a bridal fashion magazine distributed in the countries of the East African Community.

In 1834, Georgy and her family moved to England where her father had taken a job as a music critic for The Morning Chronicle. In 1842, aged 15, Georgy Hogarth joined the Dickens family household when Dickens and his wife Catherine (born Hogarth) sailed to America; Georgy cared for the young family they had left behind. She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser, and friend until her brother-in-law's death in 1870, after which she stayed in regular contact with the surviving members of the Dickens family. ==Discord== Group portrait in the porch at Gads Hill Place, H.F. Chorley, Kate Dickens, Mamie Dickens, Charles Dickens, C.A. Collins and Georgina Hogarth In 1858, Georgina Hogarth sided with Dickens in his quarrel with her sister, Catherine, Dickens's wife. This caused the family to break apart. Georgina, Dickens, and all of the children except Charles Dickens, Jr. remained in their home at Tavistock House, while Catherine and Charles Jr. moved out. Georgina ran Dickens' household. On 12 June 1858, Dickens published an article in his journal, Household Words, denying rumours in circulation about his separation without clarifying what they were or indeed the reasons behind the separation. > Some domestic trouble of mine, of long-standing, on which I will make no > further remark than that it claims to be respected, as being of a sacredly > private nature, has lately been brought to an arrangement, which involves no > anger or ill-will of any kind, and the whole origin, progress, and > surrounding circumstances of which have been, throughout, within the > knowledge of my children. It is amicably composed, and its details have now > but to be forgotten by those concerned in it....By some means, arising out > of wickedness, or out of folly, or out of inconceivable wild chance, or out > of all three, this trouble has been made the occasion of misrepresentations, > most grossly false, most monstrous, and most cruel – involving, not only me, > but innocent persons dear to my heart.... I most solemnly declare, then – > and this I do both in my own name and in my wife's name – that all the > lately whispered rumours touching the trouble, at which I have glanced, are > abominably false. And whosoever repeats one of them after this denial, will > lie as wilfully and as foully as it is possible for any false witness to > lie, before heaven and earth. He sent this statement to the newspapers, including The Times, and many reprinted it. He fell out with Bradbury and Evans, his publishers, because they refused to publish his statement in Punch as they thought it unsuitable for a humorous periodical. A less circumspect public statement appeared in the New York Tribune, which later found its way into several British newspapers. In this statement Dickens declared that it had been only Georgina Hogarth who had held the family together for some time: > ...I will merely remark of [my wife] that some peculiarity of her character > has thrown all the children on someone else. I do not know – I cannot by any > stretch of fancy imagine – what would have become of them but for this aunt, > who has grown up with them, to whom they are devoted, and who has sacrificed > the best part of her youth and life to them. She has remonstrated, reasoned, > suffered, and toiled, again and again, to prevent a separation between Mrs. > Dickens and me. Mrs. Dickens has often expressed to her sense of > affectionate care and devotion in her home – never more strongly than within > the last twelve months. One day in the same year, William Makepeace Thackeray asserted that Dickens's separation from Catherine was due to a liaison with an actress, Ellen Ternan, rather than with Georgina Hogarth as had been put to him. This remark coming to Dickens' attention, Dickens was so infuriated that it almost put an end to the Dickens-Thackeray friendship. With rumours that he and Georgina Hogarth were having an affair circulating—at a time that a sexual relationship with a sister-in-law was considered incestuous—Dickens allegedly obtained a doctor's certificate of virginity for her. ==Later years== Georgina Hogarth and Mamie Dickens On the death of Dickens on 9 June 1870, Georgina Hogarth and Ellen Ternan were at his bedside. In his will Dickens left Hogarth the then huge sum of £8,000, and \\"...all my private papers whatsoever and wheresoever\\". Among these papers was the manuscript of The Life of Our Lord, written in 1849 by Dickens exclusively for his children, to whom he read it aloud every Christmas. On her death in 1917 it came into the possession of Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, Dickens's last surviving son. Using the private letters Dickens left to her in his will, working with Dickens's eldest daughter, Mary 'Mamie' Dickens, and using Wilkie Collins as an adviser, Hogarth edited three editions of The Letters of Charles Dickens From 1833 To 1870. This included a two-volume edition published in 1880, with a third volume appearing in 1882, a new and shorter edition in two volumes, also in 1882, and a one-volume edition in 1893. As is typical in a family selection, all letters on private family matters were omitted. No mention was made of the money-troubles of John Dickens, Charles's father, the marital troubles of Fred and Augustus Dickens, Dickens's brothers, Dickens's own separation from Catherine or his worries over his sons Alfred Dickens and Edward Dickens. What was unusual, however, was the editors' methods: if cuts were made in one letter leaving passages stranded, these passages were inserted in letters of a later date. In the Preface Georgina Hogarth and Mary Dickens stated: > \\"We intend this Collection of Letters to be a Supplement to the \\"Life of > Charles Dickens,\\" by John Forster. That work, perfect and exhaustive as a > biography, is only incomplete as regards correspondence; the scheme of the > book having made it impossible to include in its space any letters, or > hardly any, besides those addressed to Mr. Forster. As no man ever expressed > himself more in his letters than Charles Dickens, we believe that in > publishing this careful selection from his general correspondence we shall > be supplying a want which has been universally felt.\\" Georgina Hogarth died in 1917 and was buried at the Old Mortlake Burial Ground in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. ==Controversy== In January 2009, The Times and other newspapers reported on a diamond ring that was purported to once have belonged to Charles Dickens and which was cited as evidence that he had an illegitimate child with Georgina Hogarth. The previously undocumented gold ring, set with a single diamond, was auctioned in February 2009, realising a hammer price of £26,000. It sold to an anonymous collector from Northern Ireland.The Daily Telegraph 'Charles Dickens love- child rumour ring sells for £26,000' 23 February 2009 According to an inscription, the ring was presented to Dickens by Alfred Lord Tennyson, the Poet Laureate and a close personal friend, in 1854. The articles reported that the ring later became the proud possession of Hector Charles Bulwer Lytton Dickens, who had claimed to be the novelist's illegitimate son through a relationship with Georgina Hogarth. The ring was being sold by Hector Dickens's descendants, along with letters, two wills and various newspaper reports which they state support his claim. His family claim that in 1890 Hector Dickens bought the ring from one of Dickens's legitimate sons, Alfred Dickens, who lived in Australia for 45 years and who is said to have fallen on hard times. Florian Schweizer, the curator of the Charles Dickens Museum in London's Doughty Street is recorded as saying that if genuine the ring could turn Dickens history \\"...on its head... There have been rumours of them having an affair but it has never been substantiated because there has never been any reliable evidence emerge. They lived together for the last 13 years with Georgina as a friend and companion, but Dickens also had a mistress at the same time.\\" According to the Daily Mail, Claire Tomalin, who wrote a biography of Ellen Ternan—allegedly another of Dickens's mistresses—questioned the claim, saying that '\\"Hector Dickens\\" was an Australian conman named Charly [sic] Peters, who used the then current rumours of Dickens's infidelities to trick people out of money'. In her biography of Ternan, The Invisible Woman, Tomalin asserted that Charley Peters, aka Hector Charles Bulwer Lytton Dickens, \\"had simply changed his name in Australia in 1900. He was not even a clever liar; he did not know, for instance, that his alleged mother, Miss Hogarth, was still alive at the time of his claim.

The battles of Colenso, Spion Kop and Vaal Krantz each resulted in embarrassing British defeats at the hands of Botha's army of Boer irregulars. In three months, British casualties rose to 3,400 men while Boer losses were much lower. On 12 February, Buller ordered a fourth attempt to relieve Ladysmith. He hoped to exploit his ten-to-one superiority in artillery and four-to-one advantage in numbers.Pakenham, p.374. The direct route to Ladysmith lay along the railroad, which ran mostly north and south. The railroad crossed the Tugela River at Colenso, ran along the north bank of the river, snaked between Railway Hill and Pieters Hill and continued to Ladysmith. While their main defences were north of the river, the Boers also held a number of ridges south of the river and east of Colenso. The Tugela runs generally east to Colenso, but near the railroad bridge the river turns north, then northeast. Along the northeasterly stretch, the river and railroad are commanded by a series of hills which represented the Boer main line of defence. A high ridge named Hlangwane rose northeast of Colenso on the south bank and overlooked the railroad. During the Battle of Colenso, a British attack on Hlangwane was repulsed. Since that time, the Boers had greatly strengthened the ridge. With Hlangwane in his possession, Buller could dominate the Boer positions at Colenso, and safely cross there. To capture Hlangwane, Buller realised that he would first have to rout the Boers from all their positions south of the river, but even with the south bank in his possession, Buller would still have to fight through the Boer-held hills to the north on the river. ==BattleSouth bank=== On 12 February, Lieutenant-Colonel Julian Byng led a reconnaissance in force to Hussar Hill, a position southeast of Colenso. The position fell on 14 February to Colonel the Earl of Dundonald's mounted brigade, and 34 artillery pieces soon crowned Hussar Hill. With the support of the guns, Major-General Neville Lyttelton's 4th Infantry Division struck to the northeast on 15 February. Cingolo Hill, to the northeast of Hussar Hill, fell next. On 18 February, while, hundreds of miles to the west, General Kitchener's army was fruitlessly attacking Piet Cronjé's surrounded army, an event known as Bloody Sunday, Major-General Henry J. T. Hildyard's 2nd Brigade captured the height of Monte Cristo, and Major-General Geoffrey Barton's 6th Brigade cleared Green Hill. The outflanked Boers abandoned Hlangwane and the south bank entirely on 19 February. Immediately, the British installed heavy artillery on the summit of Hlangwane.Pakenham, pp.364–366 ===North bank=== A 4.7-inch naval gun firing on Boer positions on Pieter's Hill Buller preferred to avoid the obvious route north along the railroad, but his intelligence officer informed him that an advance north across the river from Monte Cristo was impracticable. Therefore, the British were forced to find a way to overcome the main Boer positions. British infantry occupied Colenso on 19 February and the railhead was advanced to Colenso Station. On 21 February, the pontoon bridge was positioned under the western brow of Hlangwane and the army began to cross. Major-General Arthur S. Wynne's 11th Brigade captured Boer positions at Horse-shoe Hill and Wynne's Hill north of Colenso on the evening of 22 February. Major-General Fitzroy Hart's 5th (Irish) Brigade attacked the next high ground to the northeast, Hart's Hill on 23 February. Not waiting for all his battalions to arrive, Hart sent his troops up piecemeal and they were repulsed with almost 500 casualties. Two battalions of reinforcements arrived in time to prevent a rout. Two colonels were among the dead and the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers lost 72% of their officers and 27% of their rank and file.Pakenham, p.377 During this engagement Edgar Thomas Inkson carried a young officer, who was severely wounded and unable to walk, for three or four hundred yards, under very heavy fire, to a place of safety for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 25 February, a six-hour armistice was arranged to recover the British wounded on the upper slopes of Wynne's and Hart's Hills. On one section of hillside, 80 were killed and only three survivors were recovered.Pakenham, p.379 Buller began to look for another way to flank the Boers. It turned out that in front of the Boer positions, the Tugela entered a gorge. The pontoon bridge was moved north to the mouth of the gorge so British soldiers could cross and move to the northeast along the riverbank, unseen by the Boers. Meanwhile, a trail was located by which the British artillery was moved into supporting distance on the south bank. Lieutenant- General Sir Charles Warren's 5th Infantry Division was directed to attack the Boer left flank. The brigades would strike from east to west, first at Pieters Hill, then Railway Hill and finally Hart's Hill. Meanwhile, Lyttelton's division would threaten the Boer center and right flank. For once, Botha failed to anticipate Buller's moves. Barton's brigade attacked Pieters Hill shortly after noon on 27 February. Behind an early use of the creeping barrage by field artillery pieces as heavy as 4.7-inch naval guns, the 6th Brigade's advance was rapid at first. Then, about 14:00, as the British infantry moved out of artillery observation and Botha reinforced his threatened flank, the attack stalled. The reserve was put in at 14:30 and repulsed due to tough Boer resistance and enfilading fire from Railway Hill to the west.Pakenham, p.380 At 15:00 Colonel Walter Kitchener's 5th Brigade attacked Railway Hill. After working their way slowly uphill, the soldiers carried the nek (saddle) between Hart's and Railway Hills in a brilliant bayonet charge, capturing 48 Boer prisoners. The last to move forward, Major-General Norcott's 4th Brigade, began its assault on Hart's Hill. The close artillery support proved decisive, as trench after trench was overwhelmed by direct fire. A final infantry charge cleared the crest, compelling a Boer retreat. As Botha's men fell back from the heights, the British infantry gave out a cheer.Pakenham, pp. 381–382 ==Aftermath== On 28 February, the besieged defenders of Ladysmith observed a great column of Boer horsemen and wagons moving rapidly north, just outside artillery range. Some time after 5:00pm, two squadrons of British mounted infantry commanded by Major Hubert Gough from Buller's army rode into Ladysmith and ended the siege. Botha retreated to a new defensive line 60 miles to the north. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Available as * Available as * Available as * The Relief of Ladysmith, A poem by H.D.

The post road site was also known as Waterloo, Pierceland, Jessop and Jessup throughout the years. It was built starting in July 30, 1856 through 1857 as a chapel-of-ease in Queen Caroline Parish, the mother church of which was, and still is, Christ Church Guilford, near Columbia, Maryland. The church land was donated from William G. Ridgley and Dr. Lennox Birckhead, a Catonsville doctor who served in the Battle of Fort McHenry. The land was once part of Charles Carroll of Carrollton's land that comprised Spurrier's Tavern. Theodore Tubman and Myers Pearce (of Pierceland) deeded the cemetery to the north of the church as \\"Chapel hill\\". The first rector of Trinity Chapel, Alexander X. Berger served in 1857. Columbia's Berger road development is named after him. Berger resigned in 1861 at the outbreak of the civil war. In 1866, Trinity Chapel broke away from Christ Church Guilford, becoming Trinity Church. The church structure is a rectangular frame church of three bays with shingled walls and on the east end, a semi-octagonal apse of stone.

C. Bamford group of companies. Production began in 1991, with continual development to the present day. Generally the maximum speed of most models is , but other speeds both slower (40 km/h) and faster (80 km/h) are produced. == Engine == All models have six- cylinder diesel engines. Initially supplied by Perkins Engines then Cummins, the current supplier is AGCO SISU Power. == Gearbox == Three different gearboxes have been fitted to the Fastrac in production. * The first type has evolved over several years. # On introduction of the Fastrac this style of gearbox had 18 forward gears (6×3) and 6 reverse (6×1). This were organised as 6 manual gears in each of 3 ranges (Low, Medium and High). The range box also selected reverse giving 6 reverse gears with speeds similar to medium in forwards. All gear changes were made with the use of a dry clutch. # This gearbox then had a 2-speed powershift section added after the dry clutch and before the 6-speed gearbox. This resulted in 36 forward gears (2×6×3) and 12 reverse (2×6×1). # Following this the 2-speed powershift section was changed to 3-speed version. Giving 54 forward gears (3×6×3) and 18 reverse gears (3×6×1) # The latest version of this gearbox a wet clutch replaced the dry clutch still with 54 forward and 18 reverse gears. *The second type fitted to 4000, 8250, 8280 and 8310 Fastrac models features a CVT (IVT) hydrostatic power-split gearbox which is one of the most advanced tractor gearboxes available. *The third type developed most recently and fitted to 7000 Series and 3000 Xtra machines has a wet master clutch, a six-speed powershift section and a four-speed range box. As reverse is at the front of the powershift section the reverse gears are spread throughout the speed range. This arrangement gives 24 forward gears (2×3×4) and 12 reverse gears (1×3×4). Note that the top three reverse gears are not available for use. ==Four wheel drive== All models are selectable four-wheel drive. The rear axle is driven as standard and drive to the front axle selected by the driver, through a hydraulically controlled clutch. This clutch is sprung on to give four-wheel drive and hydraulically disengaged to give two-wheel drive. ==Axles== Most Fastrac axles have a central differential and epicyclic gearing reduction units built into the hub ends, where the wheel bolts. The 7000 Series rear axle has a central differential and has in-board epicyclic gearing reduction units. ==Axle locking differentials== A standard locking differential is provided in the rear axle of all machines. 100, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Series machines have a Detroit No-Spin-style differential lock in front axle. 3000, 7000 and 8000 Series machines have a driver-controlled clutch pack engaged locking differential. == PTO == A two-speed power take-off (PTO) is standard at the rear and a factory option at the front. Depending on the model either speeds of 1000/540 or 1000/750 are available. == Suspension == Multi-link suspension is fitted between the chassis and both the front and rear beam axles. The front suspension on most machines uses four links, a panhard rod and anti-roll bar. On the 4000 series a V-link is used at the front. The rear suspension uses two lower link and a V-link on top plus an anti-roll bar. Hydropneumatic suspension is used on the rear of all models and on the front of the 4000 and 7000 series Fastrac. This is similar to that used on some Citroën cars. == Front axle steering == ;1000, 2000 and 4000 Series Machines These Fastrac machines have hydrostatic steering similar to most agricultural tractors with only a hydraulic link between the steering wheels and the front wheels. This limits the maximum speed of these models to , except now in Germany where is allowed. ;100, 3000, 7000, 8250, 8280 and 8310 Series Machines These machines have mechanical power steering similar to a large truck. This system gives a mechanical link between the steering wheel and the front wheels. Generally these machines have had a maximum speed of except some 100 and 3000 series machines having a maximum speed of . ;8290 and 8330 Machines These machines have dual circuit hydrostatic steering allowing legal speeds over 60 km/h. An automatic Global Positioning System-controlled steering system using a (Differential GPS) is available for the 3000, 4000, 7000 and 8000 series machines. == Rear axle steering == Rear wheel steering (four-wheel steering) is available as an option on 2000 and 4000 series machines. The electronic system has 5 modes of operation, and only allows four-wheel steering below . * Two-Wheel Steer * Proportional * True Track * Delay Mode * Crab Steer == Brakes == All models are fitted with large diameter external disc brakes at both front and rear individually on each wheel. An anti-lock braking system (ABS) is fitted on some models, depending on the maximum vehicle speed and legal requirements. == Auxiliary hydraulics == An auxiliary hydraulic system (hydraulic drive system) is standard on all machines. It is used to control the front and rear linkages and through quick connectors at the front and rear of the tractor to control and power implements. == Three-point hitch == A three-point hitch is standard at the rear of the machine and on option on front. ==Rear trailer hitch== There are several types available depending on the country the machine is built for. * Pick-up hitch * PTO drawbar * Rockinger ladder * Grand Piton * 80 mm ball coupling ==Cab== Traditionally the cab has been centrally mounted. Some models, the 7000 series and latter 8250, have the cab mounted at the rear of the tractor. The most recent fastrac iteration, the 4000 series tractors, have forward sloping cabs, similar to those on combine harvesters. All cabs have a full-size passenger seat and an air suspensioned driver's seat. ==Models produced== JCB 7230 muck spreader This is not intended to be a complete list but includes the main models produced. * 125 and 145 (Discontinued) – The first models produced in 1991.

After her husband's death, she ruled both the kingdom and the county as regent for three years in the name of their son, Theobald II of Navarre. == Marriage == Margaret was born into the House of Dampierre, the eldest daughter of Archambaud VIII, Lord of Bourbon. Her mother was her father's first wife, Alice of Forez, daughter of Guigues III, Count of Forez. Archambaud was the constable of Count Theobald IV of Champagne. Margaret was 15 years old when, on 12 September 1232, she became the third wife of the 32-year-old recently widowed Count Theobald. His first wife, Gertrude of Dagsburg, had been repudiated and already deceased, while the second, Agnes of Beaujeu, died leaving only a daughter, Blanche. Their marriage was one of only two unions of the counts of Champagne with a significant age disparity between spouses, the other one being the marriage of Henry I of Champagne and Marie of France. Margaret brought a large dowry, but an unusual clause in her marriage contract stipulated that only a prorated part of it would be returned to her father in case of her death without issue within the first nine years of the marriage and nothing if she died after nine years had passed. Only if the union ended in annulment, as her parents' and Theobald's first marriage had, was the entire sum to be returned. == Regency == Margaret's marriage lasted twenty years, during which she delivered seven children. In 1234, she became Queen of Navarre when Theobald inherited the kingdom from his maternal uncle, Sancho VII. Little is known about Margaret's life as queen consort, which appears to have been spent in relative obscurity. Her husband's death in 1253, however, brought her to spotlight: their son, Theobald II of Navarre, was 18, while the laws of the realm required the king to be 21 to take control of his inheritance. She immediately had to deal with a succession crisis in the kingdom. Although her husband, also Count of Champagne, had resided in Navarre much of the time after his accession to the royal throne, the nobility of the kingdom were unwilling to accept his son as their king. Margaret prevented the outbreak of an open rebellion by travelling with Theobald to the capital, Pamplona, and by allying with the neighbouring Kingdom of Aragon. She also inherited her husband's long-standing dispute with the Knights Templar, who had bought much feudal property in Champagne despite his disapproval. Margaret resolutely prohibited them from acquiring any more land within the county. In 1254, Margaret was persuaded by her son to arrange a marriage for him with Isabella, daughter of King Louis IX of France. King Theobald II reached the age of majority in 1256.

The complex consists of seven early industrial structures, several concrete block and brick structures of 20th century date, and Gary Memorial United Methodist Church, a granite church built in the High Victorian Gothic style with an off-center tower entrance on the west gable. South of the church is a small cemetery. In the 19th century, an industrial village existed on the site, including stores, a railroad station, a school and several mill workers' houses. The large majority of these supportive structures were demolished in the 1960s. The Elysville Manufacturing Company was incorporated in 1829, by Thomas Ely, to manufacture cotton textiles. The mill was erected between August 1845 and spring 1846. It was acquired by the Oskiska Manufacturing Company which went bankrupt, then by the Alberton Manufacturing Company in 1853, and the mill village was called Alberton at least through the 1870s. The mill was then acquired in the 1860s by James S. Gary, who created still another firm which operated the mill until the 1940s, when the C.R. Daniels Company took control. C.R. Daniels was a New York-based company founded in 1918 that manufactured sail cloth material. The company purchased the 500-acre Daniels mill and 118 houses in 1940 for $65,000, doubling its size by 1950, and eventually over 300,000 sq ft. The company produced a wide variety of canvas products and canvas covers with over 200 sewing machines to assemble patterns. Later specialties included fiberglass components and conveyor belts. In 1965, the mill phased out company housing, tearing down the historic buildings and churches. In 1972, flooding from Hurricane Agnes damaged or destroyed the majority of the buildings and mill site. In 1977 a fire destroyed the remainder of the mill. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. ==See also== *List of Howard County properties in the Maryland Historical Trust *Elysville, Maryland ==Gallery== File:Daniels Mill Model.JPGModel of Daniels Mill File:Gary Memorial United Methodist Church Daniels MD Jan 11.JPGGary Memorial United Methodist Church, January 2011 ==References *, including photo from 1968, at Maryland Historical Trust *C.R.

The PAAET offers a wide variety of programs across its different colleges and training institutes. ==Historical Overview== It was established on December 28, 1982, by law number (63) with the objective of developing and upgrading manpower to meet the challenge of shortfall in technical manpower created by industrial and economic development of the country. The foundation of applied education and training was laid along with the initiation of oil exploration, production and export in Kuwait. In the 1950s, the State began to establish training centres and organised programmes to prepare the manpower needed for the oil industry. After building the fundamental structure of the educational system, the Ministry of Education established a number of specialised institutions to meet the increasing demand for skilled manpower. The other ministries established their own training centres and institutes as well. The State found it essential to establish a central body to supervise and coordinate the activities of these numerous institutes. The Technical and Vocational Education Department was established in 1972 to supervise technical and vocational education. The Central Training Department was established to supervise training centres and institute set up by to State Ministries. The Technical and Vocational Education Department continued to function until 1982 when the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET) was established as an autonomous body to supervise technical and vocational training and envision and implement an overall plan for the sector. ==Objectives== The goal of PAAET is to develop the national technical manpower and to meet human resource needs of the country through its two sectors: Education and Training. ==Colleges & Institutes== *The applied education sector includes four Colleges, which offers several specialisations: #College of Basic Education #College of Business Studies #College of Technological Studies #College of Health Sciences. *Besides the four colleges, there are number of training Institutes such as: #The Higher Institute of Energy ( Formerly Electricity and Water Institute ) #The Higher Institute of Telecommunication and Navigation ( Formerly Telecommunication and Navigation Institute ) #Industrial Training Institute (Sabah Al-Salem & Shuwaikh) #Nursing Institute #Constructional Training Institute #Vocational Training Institute ==Special Training Courses== The Authority’s Training Coordination Department offers programs predicated on the requested needs of the various Kuwaiti ministries, state institutions and the private sector. These differ from the regular programs offered by the colleges and institutes of the Authority in that they are implemented in response to special requests only, and in almost all cases the students are already in the employed or guaranteed employment after graduation, by the government or private sector. *Departmental Objectives : The objectives of this department are to prepare a well skilled cadre to meet the various and particular needs for manpower as requested by the public and/or the private sector. *Specializations : The very nature of this department is such that the programs offered will depend almost entirely upon the requested needs of the government and private sectors. Listed below are some of the most often requested programs:- #Under Technical (Engineering and Technology) #Under Para-Medical #Under Administrative Secretary ship and Office Work #Services #Agriculture *Study System : The programs offered by this department are of varying duration, a matter of weeks or months, while others are of the usual two year institutional span. If they are of two year duration or longer the successful graduate will be granted the normal PAAET diploma, if less than the minimum required for a diploma, they will be granted a certificate of attendance and/or a certificate of participation. *Opportunities : As the participants in these programs are already guaranteed employed by the Kuwaiti government or the private sector, the question of employment does not arise. However successful completion of one of these programs almost inevitably leads to promotion. ==External links== *Official website ==References== Category:Education in Kuwait Category:Educational institutions established in 1982 Category:1982 establishments in Kuwait ","title":"The Public Authority for Applied Education and Training"},{"id":"20361313","text":"Vyacheslav Ionov (June 26, 1940 – June 25, 2012) was a Soviet sprint canoeist who competed in the mid-1960s.

It is located roughly halfway between Liverpool and Manchester. ==World War II== With the advent of the Second World War, 927 acres (3.8 km²) of largely heath and mossland which was part of Risley village, between Leigh (then Lancashire, now Greater Manchester) and Warrington (then Lancashire, now Cheshire), was compulsorily purchased and within it was built a large Royal Ordnance Factory. The location was chosen because the low lying mist and cloud helped camouflage the factory from the air; according to a local builder: \\"It was very lonely and misty at night, and that's why the factory was constructed there... it was usually covered with a mist or cloud. It was hard to see it in the day time, you know\\". A part of the site was drained and construction began in August 1939. It took 18 months to complete, but bombs were produced from September 1940. Out of print, but an authorized reproduction with scans of page 44 and page 45 is available. Risley Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF) was a filling factory. It received the explosives in bulk, usually by rail, from other ROFs where they were manufactured. Risley specialised in filling them into the various casings to produce the finished munitions. There were 16 filling factories around the country and Risley was known as Filling Factory No. 6. Others in the north west included Chorley (No. 1) and Kirkby (No. 7). One of the features common to all of the filling factories was an area of storage bunkers where the finished munitions were stored awaiting dispatch. The areas within the filling factories were all numbered in the same way. Storage bunkers were designated Area 9. Risley had 20 such bunkers and Area 9 is roughly in the area of the main field in Birchwood Forest Park today. When the new town area of Birchwood was created, most of the bunkers were demolished, but 4 of them were left in place and can still be seen today.Birchwood's Wartime Bunkers - Remains of the Royal Ordnance Factory, Brian Tuohey, http://www.2e-images.co.uk/places/birchwood/bunkers.htm A number of bunkers were also built to house the munitions, to protect them from potential bombing, and also to segregate the site and reduce the consequences of any accidental explosions during manufacture or storage. Although these bunkers are on the surface, they are covered with soil and turf and so give the impression of being underground. It had a dedicated rail link to the Manchester-Wigan branch line, which was used both for bringing in workers and moving materials. Also there was a 'halt' on the Liverpool-Manchester line. In the post war years wooden coaches lay derelict there. The actual layout of the site was far from flat, the site having several pillboxes mounted high up on earthbanks surrounding the mounds covering the bunkers. Some of the rail sidings also had huge earthworks around them.Verifiable local witness ==Post- war UKAEA era== However, after World War II the factory was soon overshadowed when in January 1946UKAEATODAY May 2006 Issue 79 Page 10, Farewell to Risley, http://www.dounreay.com/UserFiles/File/archive/UKAEA%20Today/ukaeatodayMay06.pdfUKAEA – THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS, Andy Munn, http://www.caithness.org/fpb/dounreay/history/fastbreeder/Prime Minister's Office records: PREM8/1554 Correspondence and papers, 1945-1951, Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/pro/p-pre08.shtml the Directorate for Atomic Energy Production, under the aegis of the Ministry of Supply, was set up to produce fissile material and chose Risley to build its headquarters, under the control of Sir Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside.Canada's Plutonium Contribution to Britain's Nuclear Weapons Programme - verbatim excerpts from Independence and Deterrence Britain and Atomic Energy, 1945-1952 the official history of Britain's nuclear energy programme, written by Margaret Gowing (assisted by Lorna Arnold), published by Macmillan, London, 1974, commissioned by the UK Atomic Energy Authority, http://www.ccnr.org/canada_britain.html#ch This project, to produce a nuclear weaponCanada's Plutonium Contribution to Britain's Nuclear Weapons Programme verbatim excerpts from Independence and Deterrence Britain and Atomic Energy, 1945-1952 the official history of Britain's nuclear energy programme, written by Margaret Gowing (assisted by Lorna Arnold), published by Macmillan, London, 1974 commissioned by the UK Atomic Energy Authority, http://www.ccnr.org/canada_britain.html#bt or A-bomb was by far the UK's biggest industrial and scientific undertaking in peacetime, requiring most of the country's top scientists and a huge budget and scale that couldn't even be contemplated these days.

In 1954UKAEA – THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS, Andy Munn, http://www.caithness.org/fpb/dounreay/history/index.htm the Risley headquarters site was greatly expanded again with the formal establishment of the UKAEA (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority) heralding the beginning of the civil nuclear power program which ran alongside the military one. By this time the organisation had more than 20,000 workers. Design and construction of all other UKAEA plants was overseen here, technical policy and long term planning, finance and administration as well as world leading scientific research in physics, chemistry and engineering. The biggest increase was between 1955 and 1958 when the need for producing much more plutonium and highly enriched uranium and development of new materials such as tritium required for the H-bomb, which the Government announced it would develop in February 1955. By 1961 more than 40,000 were employed, the biggest percentage at the Risley HQ. So sensitive was the work carried out at Risley, particularly during the fifties and sixties that the former site of the ROF was regularly patrolled by UKAEA Police Force vans. The slightest movement being spotted and investigated immediately.Verifiable local witness Driving past on the A574 in the nineteen sixties all that could be seen were the derelict bus shelters, but driving down Silver Lane two quite large buildings, 40–50 feet high made from brick and corrugated galvanised iron with concrete floors but no windows, about the size of a small to medium-sized aircraft hangar, storing mostly rusty old lorries and vans and nearby small underground bomb shelters were clearly visible as was the railway line crossing. There were no other buildings on this part of the site apart from a small rectangular reservoir, a similar size to the one that forms the walled garden. This part of the ROF site was mostly just mossland and heath. The area was a habitat for large hares which could be seen regularly. ==Birchwood Forest Park== The disused area of the site was put on the market in 1963. No buyer was found for it until 1968, when the Warrington and Runcorn Development Corporation under government plans bought the site in preparation for building the new town of Birchwood now part of Cheshire in the mid seventies. Birchwood Forest Park is in the centre, in which some of the old bunkers from the factory form part of the landscape. ==Notes * Royal Ordnance Factory, Risley Note: As of 23 November 2008 this site appears to be non-functional.

Perleberg was born in Brandenburg an der Havel in 1935. He trained with SC Aufbau Magdeburg under Ernst Schmidt. Perleberg won two medals for East Germany at the 1963 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in Jajce with a gold in the K-4 1000 m and a bronze in the K-1 4 × 500 m events. On the last day of the 1963 World Championships he defected to West Germany via Austria to be with his pregnant girlfriend in Havelse near Hanover. Perleberg's status as a Republikflüchtling (\\"deserter from the republic\\") caused considerable friction between the two German national committees for determining the United Team of Germany at the 1964 Summer Olympics. In the end, Avery Brundage as President of the International Olympic Committee suggested that separate qualification races be held; those involving Perleberg in West Germany and those not involving him in East Germany. That suggestion was followed and Perleberg qualified in the K-4 at the Wedau Regatta Course in Duisburg while the other races were held at the regatta course in Grünau in East Berlin. He acted as an official for the canoeing association in Lower Saxony after his active career.

According to Greek mythology, it was founded by Orchomenus; but its inhabitants were removed to Megalopolis, upon the establishment of that city (371 BCE). It never recovered its former population, and is mentioned by Strabo among the places of Arcadia which had almost entirely disappeared. It continued, however, to exist as a village in the time of Pausanias, who saw there a temple of Poseidon Hippius upon the river Mylaon. He also mentions, above the river Maloetas, a mountain called Thaumasium, in which was a cave where Rhea took refuge when pregnant with Zeus. At the distance of 30 stadia from Methydrium was a fountain named Nymphasia.-3, comp. 8.12.2, 8.27.4-7.

He was working as a farm hand in Lafayette Township when he enlisted as a drummer boy in Company D in July 1862. On July 16, 1863, at Wolf Run, Virginia, he was shot in the neck, and the wound was assumed to be fatal. His fellow soldiers dug his grave, but he survived, and was sent to Washington to recover. He was mustered out on May 30, 1865. He later moved to Brooklyn, NY, where he worked as a chemist (pharmacist), then to Sag Harbor, NY. He and his family eventually settled in Amagansett, NY, joining two fellow soldiers who were Amagansett natives: (Sgt) Lodowick H. King (Co. I) and Marcus Barnes Duvall (Co. E). King and Duvall had joined the 15th New Jersey along with Chaplain Alanson A. Haines, a New Jersey native who was a pastor in Amagansett at the start of the war. Kelsey died in Amagansett on December 6, 1916, and is buried in East End Cemetery. ===Losey, Peter (PVT)=== Peter Losey was an unmarried farmer in Stillwater Township, Sussex County, New Jersey, when he enlisted at Newton.

The program participates in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision and currently competes in the eleven-member Colonial Athletic Association. The program plays its home games at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium in Stony Brook, New York. Stony Brook first fielded a varsity team at the Division III level in 1984 and rose to Division II in 1996. In 1999, the Seawolves became a Division I program, joining the Northeast Conference without offering scholarships until 2006. After a year of FCS independence, Stony Brook joined the Big South Conference and fully transitioned into a sixty-three scholarship program. In the summer of 2012, the program announced its admission into the Colonial Athletic Association. Since transitioning to Division I, the Seawolves have amassed five conference championships, including four straight from 2009 to 2012. They have participated in the Division I FCS playoffs four times and advanced to the second round three times. In 2012, they had their best performing season, winning a program-record ten games. After struggling in their first few seasons in the CAA, the Seawolves finished 10–3 in 2017 to finish in second place in the division, and returned to the playoffs in 2018. The program has cemented itself as a major national power in the Football Championship Subdivision with nationwide recruiting, consecutive weeks in the national polls, and its admission into the highly competitive Colonial Athletic Association in 2013. ==History== Stony Brook first fielded varsity football in the 1983 season when its athletic teams were known as the Patriots. The football team transitioned into Division I in 1999 after leaving the Eastern Football Conference. In 2002, the 8,300 seat Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium opened as the new home of Seawolves football. The program joined the Northeast Conference in 1999 and participated as an associate member until 2006. It transitioned to a fully funded FCS program from 2006 until 2008 providing the maximum scholarship allowance of 63. In 2008 Stony Brook joined the Big South Conference. In the summer of 2012 the program announced its admission into the Colonial Athletic Association. In 2017, the stadium was expanded to add further 2,000 seats, which along with a standing capacity of at least 2,000, gives the stadium a total capacity of 12,300. ===Early days (1984–1998)=== After a period of impressive growth at the University which saw a rise in enrollment to over 16,000 students, the athletic department started taking shape with the steady development of its collegiate programs. Football was one of them, and Stony Brook initiated competition against regional universities and fellow SUNY members schools. Stony Brook fielded varsity football for the first time in the 1983 season playing their first game against SUNY Maritime on September 18, 1983 but it was in 1984 when the team started playing a predominantly Division III schedule, and stats where first recorded by the NCAA. By 1985, Stony Brook, for the first time did not schedule club teams as part of their season. By 1988, the football program joined it first ever conference with its inclusion into the Liberty Football, an affiliation which lasted until 1991. While in Liberty Football, it competed on a yearly basis against Hofstra, Pace, Brooklyn, Fordham and other programs across the New York metropolitan area. At the end of the 1991 season, Stony Brook announced its admission into the Freedom Football conference as it continued to develop into a stronger Division III program. While part of Freedom Football, Stony Brook had winning seasons every year. In 1995, Stony Brook departed from the Freedom Football conference and initiated a transition to Division I in all sports. In 1997 it joined Division II's Eastern Football Conference for a period of two years, having back-to-back losing seasons. By 1999, the transition was completed and Stony Brook joined the Division I Northeast Conference as a non-scholarship program. ===Joining the Northeast Conference and Division I (1999–2007)=== Stony Brook entered Division I football in 1999, participating in the Northeast Conference until 2006. Continued growth of the program was assured with the construction of the Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium. The Seawolves had a hard time on the field struggling over the span of three seasons with sub .500 records. The 2002 season coincided with the opening season of the stadium and the Seawolves posted their best winning season under the NEC banner with an 8–2 overall record, a 5–2 record against the NEC with a total of over 27,000 fans attending their opening season. However, the Seawolves weren't able to replicate their inaugural year's success and fell on hard times the following two seasons winning only nine of twenty games. The 2005 season was the last season under Sam Kornhauser, rewarded with the program's first NEC co- championship after a 6–4, 5–2 NEC season. The desire to offer scholarship football climaxed in 2005 and the decision was taken among administrators to transition the Seawolves to full funding status. The 2006 year would mark the beginning of a new era in Stony Brook football. Scholarships were offered in football for the first time, part of an ambitious plan to transition the program to full scholarship funding. Chuck Priore took over the reins of the program and with the support of the department awarded the equivalent of 27 scholarships to 38 player for the initial season. This same year efforts to market Stony Brook Seawolves football to a bigger audience intensified and for the first time the Seawolves were to be fully broadcast over the airwaves on the campus radio station, 90.1 WUSB FM, and through a parallel online stream at WUSB.FM. A Sunday night talk show with Chuck Priore was initiated on the radio followed by weekly letters \\"From the Coaches Corner\\" released in the athletic website. The season also witnessed a much tougher schedule than the previous years with Hofstra, #1 New Hampshire, and #9 Massachusetts, and Georgetown all scheduled to play. As a result, the four initial games of the season were lost but the Seawolves came back to win four straight in conference play before losing their title hopes to Central Connecticut to end the season 5–6, 5–2 in the Northeast. The Seawolves departed from the Northeast Conference despite signing a contract extension through 2010, largely due to the NEC imposed limit of 30 scholarships and the desire to increment scholarship allowance to 63, the maximum allowed by the NCAA. The program participated in 2007 as an independent taking advantage of independence to increase scholarships offerings and to schedule higher-caliber unconventional teams like #20 Richmond, #6 Youngstown State,http://www.goseawolves.org/sports/m-footbl/recaps/091507aab.html #14 Hofstra, #24 Elon, and Maine while also scheduling previous conference rivals Central Connecticut, Albany, Monmouth, and Bryant. The Seawolves also played against Patriot League members Bucknell and Georgetown. The 2007 season ended with 6–5 record and the announcement of Stony Brook joining the Big South Conference with full sixty-three scholarship funding. ===Joining the Big South Conference (2008–2010)=== Stony Brook joined the Big South in 2008 after a year of independence. The 2008 season opened in winning fashion with a 42–26 victory against Colgate but the Seawolves struggled, losing the next four out- of-conference matchups against Elon, Maine, Brown, and Hofstra. The Seawolves then dropped their first Big South matchup against Liberty with a 33–0 result. The Seawolves went on to win four of their last five games to finish their inaugural season with a 5–6 record, 3–2 in the Big South. Mike & Mike of ESPN radio and ESPN listeners coined the name The Battle for the Butter for the game between Maine and Stony Brook in 2008. The 2009 season showed a much improved team and stronger schedule with games against cross-island rival Hofstra, UMass and North Dakota in which they lost, but went on to win five out of their six conference games and capped the season with a 36–33 upset over the Liberty Flames to share the conference title. In the offseason, cross-island rival Hofstra announced the immediate folding of their football program. For Stony Brook, that meant the addition of multiple transfers from Hofstra eligible to play immediately. As a result, the Seawolves came out stronger than ever in their 2010 campaign. Continuing to increase the strength-of-schedule, the Seawolves played their first ever game against a Division I FBS school at South Florida. While the Seawolves led for the entire first quarter, they lost 59–14 in front of an audience of over 40,000. As the last game of the season approached, the Seawolves found themselves undefeated in conference play but fell 54–28 to the Liberty Flames at Lynchburg, sharing the Big South title for a second year straight, this time in a three-way tie with Coastal Carolina and Liberty. Stony Brook did not win the Big South's automatic bid to the FCS Playoffs, since Coastal Carolina allowed the fewest points in their conference schedule of the three teams. Midway through the season, the program announced it was receiving its largest donation ever – a $4.3 million Strength & Conditioning facility from former Stony Brook athlete Glenn Dubin. The 2011 season featured the addition of top recruit Fernando Diaz who transferred from the Division I FBS program at the University of Pittsburgh together with returning running-duo Miguel Maysonet and Brock Jackolski and renewed expectations. The program continued the efforts of increasing the strength of schedule adding games against Division I FBS Buffalo and UTEP and a record six games at home. In the preseason, The Seawolves were ranked among the top 15 programs at the Division I FCS level in the \\"Phil Steele's College Football Review\\" ahead of their conference rivals, Liberty, which were ranked in the 31st position. ===National prominence and playoffs (2011–2012)=== Stony Brook opened the 2011 season with another FBS matchup, losing to UTEP 31–24 in overtime after allowing 21 unanswered points to the Miners. The Seawolves then played another FBS team, Buffalo, and were blown out 35–7. In their home opener, Stony Brook lost to Brown 21–20 after giving up the go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter to fall to 0–3. However, the Seawolves turned it around and began the longest winning streak in program history. They defeated Lafayette 37–20 in the conference opener, and would score at least 40 points in each game for the rest of the regular season. This included a program and Big South conference record in a 76–28 victory over Gardner-Webb. In the final game of the regular season, marketed as the Big South Championship Game, Stony Brook defeated Liberty 41–31 to earn the Big South's automatic bid for the NCAA Division I Football Championship. The Seawolves ended the regular season on an eight-game winning streak to finish 6–0 in conference play and win the conference title again. In the first round of the 2011 FCS Playoffs, Stony Brook paired up against in-state rivals Albany, coming back from an 18-point deficit to defeat the Great Danes 31–28 in front of a then-record-setting crowd of 8,286. The Seawolves advanced to the second round, facing top-seeded Sam Houston State. Despite leading for much of the game, the Seawolves lost 34–27 on a last-minute touchdown to end their season at 9–4 (6–0). Before the 2012 season, the Seawolves added several FBS transfers, including Iowa's Marcus Coker, Maryland's Adrian Coxson, and Minnesota's Leston Simpson. In addition, the Dubin Family Athletic Performance Center opened in the early summer. In the season opener, the Seawolves defeated Central Connecticut 49–17 at home. The Seawolves set a new points record by beating Division II Pace 77–7, beginning the season 2–0. The next week, Stony Brook faced an FBS opponent in Syracuse, but lost 28–17 despite leading for most of the first half. The Seawolves followed up with a Homecoming matchup, setting a new home attendance record at 10,278 in a 32–31 comeback win over Colgate. Stony Brook made history in Week 5 by defeating Army 23–3. It was the program's first victory against an FBS opponent. The Seawolves opened Big South play on a high note beating Charleston Southern, Coastal Carolina, Gardner-Webb, and Presbyterian, and VMI. Riding a seven-game winning streak, Stony Brook was ranked No. 6 in the Sports Network Poll, the highest in school history. The Seawolves would lose the final game of the regular season 28–14 to Liberty; while they still won a share of the Big South title, the automatic bid was given to Coastal Carolina. Stony Brook was granted an at-large bid to the FCS Playoffs for the team's second consecutive appearance. The Seawolves earned a first-round home matchup against Villanova, winning 20–10. Moving on to the second round, Stony Brook travelled to Bozeman to face the third-seeded Montana State, where they lost, 16–10, to end their season at 10–3 (5–1). The team's ten wins were the most in program history. Stony Brook graduated running back Miguel Maysonet, the Big South and the school's all-time leader in rushing yards (4,725) and rushing touchdowns (48). === Joining the Colonial Athletic Association and struggling to adjust (2013–2016) === In mid July 2012, rumors surfaced in the media of Stony Brook being a target for CAA Football. In early August, the CAA confirmed that Stony Brook, along with in-state rival Albany, will be joining CAA Football for the 2013 season. It was announced early in 2013 that Stony Brook scheduled matches against FBS opponents Boston College and Buffalo, but Boston College pulled out. Stony Brook beat Rhode Island 24–0 in their first CAA game, and opened their home season on September 28 with a loss against Towson. Stony Brook faced their New York rival Albany on November 23, the last week of the regular season, winning 24–3 in the first Empire Clash matchup with both teams in the CAA. The Seawolves finished 5–6 in their first CAA season. The 2014 season began with losses to non-conference opponents Bryant and FBS UConn, and Stony Brook's record stood at 1–4 by the end of September. A three-game winning streak brought them back to .500, but they would lose three of their final four games, including the season finale at Albany, to end the season with a 5–7 record. Stony Brook began their 2015 season with a match against FBS Toledo, but the game was suspended and cancelled due to severe thunderstorms. While they won their first two games, including an upset against No. 13 New Hampshire, the Seawolves would go on to lose five in a row, all to conference opponents. Stony Brook won the final three games of the season but still ended with a record of 5–5, including a 3–5 record in CAA play. In 2016, Stony Brook won their season opener against No. 19 North Dakota before losing the next game to FBS Temple. In Week 3, Stony Brook upset No. 2 ranked Richmond, pulling off a 42–14 victory at home. The surprise win helped the Seawolves earn a No. 20 ranking in the FCS STATS poll the next week, the team's first ranking since 2013. However, they were upset at home the next week by Sacred Heart, losing 38–10. Stony Brook would win their next three games to improve to 5–2 and an undefeated 4–0 in conference. Their season nosedived from there, as the Seawolves lost the final four games of the season to finish 5–6 (4–4). Stony Brook did not have a single winning season in any of their first four years in the CAA. ===Back to the playoffs (2017–present)=== Before the 2017 season started, Stony Brook was predicted to finish 8th out of 12 in the CAA. While they lost the season opener at No. 19 FBS-ranked South Florida, Stony Brook ended the season with a 10–3 record, going 7–1 in CAA play to finish in second place behind James Madison. Their lone conference loss came at home against Delaware. In the regular season finale, Stony Brook won 20–19 at Maine on a Hail Mary which was caught in the end zone as time expired in the fourth quarter; the pass was ranked No. 1 on SportsCenter's Top 10 Plays. Stony Brook received an at-large bid to the FCS Playoffs, beating Lehigh 59–29 in the first round before losing to James Madison in the second round by a score of 26–7. The season was the Seawolves' most successful since 2012 as they won more than five games for the first time since joining the CAA. Stony Brook finished the regular season ranked No. 10 in the FCS STATS poll, the team's highest since a No. 6 ranking in 2012. Stony Brook began their 2018 season with a 38–0 road loss against FBS opponent Air Force. The team would rebound, winning their next four games including a 29–27 comeback victory against Villanova after trailing 21–0 in the second quarter. The team was upset on the road by Towson but beat New Hampshire and Rhode Island; the Seawolves' 52–14 victory in the latter game was played in front of a crowd of 12,701, the most attended home game in Stony Brook history. A major upset bid against No. 3 James Madison fell short 13–10, but Stony Brook came out of the bye week by toppling first-place Delaware 17–3. In the final game of the season, Stony Brook was massively upset on the road, losing 25–23 to last-place Albany in a rivalry game that was decided on a last-second field goal. Regardless, Stony Brook still earned an at-large berth to the FCS Playoffs after finishing 7–4 (5–3), where they lost 28–14 to Southeast Missouri State in the first round. == Conference affiliations == Stony Brook began play as a Division III program in 1984, transitioned to Division II in 1996, and finally ascended to Division I in 1999. * Division III Independent (1984–1987) * Liberty Football Conference (1988–1991) * Freedom Football Conference (1992–1995) * Division II Independent (1996) * Eastern Football Conference (1997–1998) * Northeast Conference (1999–2006) * FCS Independent (2007) * Big South Conference (2008–2012) * Colonial Athletic Association (2013–present) ==Championships== The Seawolves won their first Division I Conference Championship in the 2005 season while playing in the Northeast Conference with an end of the season record of 6–4 (5–2).

In 2010, Stony Brook repeated as co-champions of the Big South after a 6–5 (5–1) season, but did not receive a bid to the FCS Playoffs after losing their season finale to the Liberty Flames 54–28. The Seawolves won their third consecutive Big South title, and first outright, in 2011, finishing with a 9–4 (6–0) record and earning their first trip to the FCS Playoffs after beating Liberty 41–31 in the Big South Championship. In 2012, the Seawolves won their fourth consecutive Big South championship, amassing a 10–3 (5–1) record. ===Conference Championships=== { cellpadding=\\"1\\" border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width:80%;\\" - - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2005  Sam Kornhauser  Northeast Conference  5–2* - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2009  rowspan=\\"4\\"  Chuck Priore  rowspan=\\"4\\"  Big South Conference  5–1* - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2010  5–1* - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#fff;\\"  2011  6–0 - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#fff;\\"  2012  5–1* - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#fff;\\"  colspan=\\"2\\" Total conference championships  colspan=\\"2\\" 5 } \\"*\\" Co-Champions ==PostseasonNCAA Division I Football Championship (FCS) Playoffs=== The Seawolves have appeared in the NCAA Division I Football Championship (FCS) Playoffs four times.

LaValle Stadium=== Dubin Family Athletic Performance Center Built in 2002, LaValle Stadium is the on-campus home of the Stony Brook Seawolves football team. LaValle Stadium has a seating capacity of 12,300. It was constructed with a cost of approximately $22 million and it is the largest outdoor facility in Suffolk County. It was named after the New York state senator who was instrumental in getting the funding for the stadium. The stadium is also shared with the school soccer and lacrosse teams. In October 2012, it was reported that the University has allocated $5.7 million for the addition of at least 2,000 seats to LaValle Stadium, which would bring the capacity up to 10,300. The expansion was completed in the summer of 2017. A further standing capacity of at least 2,000 gives the stadium a total capacity of 12,300. ===Dubin Family Athletic Performance Center=== In February 2011 it was announced that a new strength and conditioning center will be erected in the north side of the Stony Brook indoor Sports Complex. It will be a facility set to be completed during the fall 2011. In Spring 2012, the facility was inaugurated. The facility provides the Seawolves with a world-class fitness facility and is named after alumnus Glenn Dubin, who donated over $4.3 million for the construction of the project, the largest athletic donation in the SUNY system. Dubin is an alumnus of Stony Brook who graduated in 1978. ==Future non-conference opponents== { style=\\"width:60%; text-align:center;\\"  - -  @Fordham  @Oregon @UMass   @San Diego State -  @Florida Atlantic Fordham    - } == History vs. FBS opponents == {  - align=\\"center\\"  2010  South Florida  L 14–59 - align=\\"center\\"  2011  UTEP Buffalo  L 24–31 (OT) L 7–35 - align=\\"center\\"  2012  Syracuse Army  L 17–28 W 23–3 - align=\\"center\\"  2013  Buffalo  L 23–26 (5OT) - align=\\"center\\"  2014  UConn  L 17–19 - align=\\"center\\"  2015  Toledo  Canceled - align=\\"center\\"  2016  Temple  L 0–38 - align=\\"center\\"  2017  #19 South Florida  L 17–31 - align=\\"center\\"  2018  Air Force  L 0–38 - align=\\"center\\"  2019  Utah State  L 7–62 - align=\\"center\\"  2020  Florida Atlantic  - align=\\"center\\"  2021  Oregon  - align=\\"center\\"  2022  UMass  - align=\\"center\\"  2025  San Diego State  } ==Gallery== File:Seawolves Football Team.JPG File:Seawolves_Football_2.JPG File:Seawolves_Football_at_Army.JPG File:Kenneth_P_LaValle_Stadium.jpg File:Kenneth_P_LaValle_Stadium_2.JPG File:Lavalle Stadium Fans.jpg ==References * Official site Category:American football teams established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Stony Brook Seawolves football"},{"id":"20361646","text":"Mihai Ţurcaş (born 18 November 1942 - d. 22 December 2002) was a Romanian sprint canoeist.

This achievement allowed the construction of the Panama Canal. Gorgas Memorial Laboratories was inaugurated in 1928 on Arosemena Avenue. Its expertise in studying the diseases of the tropics originated from the necessity to eradicate yellow fever and control malaria in the cities of Panama and Colon with the construction of the Panama Canal. ==Research== This triumph, led by Dr. William C. Gorgas in the first years of the 20th century, was achieved by one of the largest and most successful community-level public health interventions ever recorded in the history of medicine. Since then, many emerging and reemerging diseases have been studied at GMI and physicians and scientists of many nationalities working there have made significant contributions to medicine in the tropics. These collaborations and lines of investigation have continued up to the present. GMI is known for its high quality laboratories, including those of parasitology, immunology, genomics, entomology, water and food chemistry, bacteriology, entomology and virology. Besides having an epidemiology and biostatistics department, it conducts research on health administration, chronic diseases and human reproduction. GMI has contributed to better the health of Panama and the Central American countries by acting as a reference laboratory to diagnose diseases like yellow fever, malaria, measles, arbovirus febrile illness, viral encephalitidies, influenza, dengue and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Jorge Motta, MD, MPH, was the Director General from 2004 to 2008 and the present director is Dr. Nestor Sosa.The Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies Most recently GMI became a World Bank-Pan-American Health Organization reference laboratory for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for the Central American region. Its lengthy tradition of service in the region has permitted GMI to maintain and nurture close contacts and rapid communication with all the public health installations of Panama’s Ministry of Health, with the health installations of the Social Security System and with the main private hospitals of the country. In 2006, GMI signed an MOU with the Department of Health and Human Services and was also awarded two grants, one to increase its virology diagnostic capacity and to strengthen the surveillance of influenza virus in Panama and Central America and the other to develop a Regional Training Center for community health care workers of the Central American Region. The Regional Training Center is an educational facility dedicated to community health care workers and clinicians of Central America to prepare them to provide better primary and preventive health care to underserved rural and poor urban communities and indigenous populations. These health care providers are trained to provide the first line of response to health needs of their communities, especially in areas related of infectious diseases, pandemic illness response and the attainment of Millennium Development Health Goals. GMI's has research agreements and research projects with academic centers like the Johns Hopkins University, George Washington University, the University of South Florida, the University of New Mexico, and the Walter Reed Institute of Research. GMI has developed strong links with the epidemiology programs and the extended immunization programs of all the countries in Central America, with the World Health Organization (WHO), specifically with the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and influenza program, with the Center for Diseases Control of the United of America (CDC-USA) and (CDC-MERTU-G), with the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and with institutions like the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI). Today GMI is an autonomous public institution that works closely with the Ministry of Health. Its vision is to improve the health of Panama and Central America. Its mission is to develop health research in Panama, to fulfill the functions of a national public health laboratory and to provide education to health care workers of the region. GMI is evolving to become Panama’s national public health institute and will continue serving the Ministry of Health by providing the best evidence available to develop public health policy. A collection of the institute's papers are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. ==References External links == * Official Website (Spanish) Category:Research institutes in Panama Category:Medical and health organizations based in Panama ","title":"Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios de la Salud"},{"id":"20361705","text":"The American Law and Economics Association (ALEA), a United States organization founded in 1991, is focused on the advancement of economic understanding of law, and related areas of public policy and regulation.

The aim to provide technical information to support agribusiness decision makers and governmental policies. IEA was generated in the bosom of Dept. of Vegetable Production (DVP), created within Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento in 1942. During a period to deepen his knowledge of fiber technology area, Agronomical Engineer Dr. Rui Miller Paiva became acquainted with the agricultural economy area and decided to follow that the discipline. Returning to São Paulo, Paiva brought with him ideas and the knowledge that led to the creation of the Rural Studies Commission, DPV's antecessor, the first Brazilian pole on economic issues related to agriculture. IEA's pioneering spirit continued for over 65 years. As early as the end of 1970, for example, researchers from that Institute would carry out assessments about the energetic balance of crops (today the concept is widely used in the discussions on bioenergy) and the effect of the expansion of sugar cane crop on soil use in the São Paulo (replacement of crops). In the latest years, its involvement with techno-science (nanotechnology) and its social and economical effects within agriculture are the highlight. IEA is a pioneer in probability sampling in order to forecast harvests, price surveys and the calculation of the market basket. Currently, it calculates and disseminates agricultural prices every four weeks, or the countryside inflation. The agriculture prices are a reference for the markets, wholesales, retailers and producers, both on a state and national level. IEA's statistical surveys (prices, production, estimates for harvests, labor market, land market) provided a model for other agriculture economics institutions. IEA introduced the MIT methodology (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), as well as the World Bank's, for the conception and economical assessment of agriculture development projects. The economical, prognostics, and the production costs analyses, the census of São Paulo agriculture and the cattle raising census, and the technical and scientific magazines have proved to be important information sources for decision-making on public and private policies. The Institute takes part in the formulation of public policies concerning the financing of Fundo de Expansão do Agronegócio Paulista (FEAP) in addition to contributing to the analyses of the support financing for small-scale agri-industry. Its surveys are used as a basis for choosing the municipalities to be benefited by the subsidy projects for the State's awarding of rural insurance. IEA discloses data on São Paulo's trade balance per group of commodities, and that ranking was developed by the institution itself. It's also discloses data on São Paulo and Brazil's agribusiness per added factor (basic and industrialized products) and by use category. ==Agricultural Economics Database== A wide variety of statistical data are available at the official website: Prices (land, inputs, producer, wholesale, retail); Crop estimation and forecasting (area, production, yield); Labor market; Land market and others.

The Talheim Death Pit (German: Massaker von Talheim), discovered in 1983, was a mass grave found in a Linear Pottery Culture settlement, also known as a Linearbandkeramik (LBK) culture. It dates back to about 5000 BC. The pit takes its name from its site in Talheim, Germany. The pit contained the remains of 34 bodies, and evidence points towards the first signs of organized violence in Early Neolithic Europe. ==Evidence of violence== Warfare is thought to have been more prevalent in primitive, ungoverned regions than in civilized states.Keeley 1996 The massacre at Talheim supports this idea by giving evidence of habitual warfare between Linearbandkeramik settlements. It is most likely that the violence occurred among LBK populations since the head wounds indicate the use of weapons from LBK cultures and all skeletons found resemble those of LBK settlers. The Talheim grave contained a total of 34 skeletons, consisting of 16 children, nine adult males, seven adult women, and two more adults of indeterminate sex.Guilaine and Zammit 2005: 86.Scarre 2005 Several skeletons of this group exhibited signs of repeated and healed-over trauma, suggesting that violence was a habitual or routine aspect of the culture.Golitko & Keeley 2007 Not all of the wounds, however, were healed at the time of death. All of the skeletons at Talheim showed signs of significant trauma that were likely the cause of death. Broken down into three categories, 18 skulls were marked with wounds indicating the sharp edge of adzes of the Linearbandkeramik or Linear Pottery culture (LBK); 14 skulls were similarly marked with wounds produced from the blunt edge of adzes, and 2-3 had wounds produced by arrows. The skeletons did not exhibit evidence of defensive wounds, indicating that the population was fleeing when it was killed. ==Reasons for violence== Investigation of the Neolithic skeletons found in the Talheim death pit suggests that prehistoric men from neighboring tribes were prepared to fight and kill each other in order to capture and secure women. Researchers discovered that there were women among the immigrant skeletons, but within the local group of skeletons there were only men and children. They concluded that the absence of women among the local skeletons meant that they were regarded as somehow special, thus they were spared execution and captured instead. The capture of women may have indeed been the primary motive for the fierce conflict between the men. Other speculations as to the reasons for violence between settlements include vengeance, conflicts over land, resources, poaching, demonstration of superiority, and kidnapping slaves.Golitko & Keeley 2007 Some of these theories related to the lack of resources are supported by the discovery that various LBK fortifications bordering indigenously inhabited areas appear to have not been in use for very long.Golitko & Keeley 2007 Map diagramming the expansion of Kurgan Culture across Europe. The migrations started in approximately 4000 BC. ==Similar occurrencesMass burial at Schletz-Asparn=== The mass grave near Schletz, part of Asparn an der Zaya, was located about 33 kilometres (roughly 20 miles) to the north of Vienna, Austria, and dates back about 7,500 years.Robinson 2005 Schletz, just like the Talheim death pit, is one of the earliest known sites in the archaeological record that shows proof of genocide in Early Neolithic Europe, among various LBK tribes. The site was not entirely excavated, but it is estimated that the entire ditch could contain up to 300 individuals.Golitko & Keeley 2007 The remains of 67 people have been uncovered, all showing multiple points of trauma.Robinson 2005 Scientists have concluded that these people were also victims of genocide. Since the weapons used were characteristic of LBK peoples, the attackers are believed to be members of other LBK tribes.Golitko & Keeley 2007 In similar proportions to those found at Talheim, fewer young women were found than men at Schletz. Because of this scarcity of young women among the dead, it is possible that other women of the defeated group were kidnapped by the attackers. The site was enclosed, or fortified, which serves as evidence of violent conflict among tribes and means that these fortifications were built as a form of defense against aggressors. The people who lived there had built two ditches to counter the menace of other LBK communities. ===Mass burial at Herxheim=== Another Early Neolithic mass grave was found at Herxheim, near Landau in the Rhineland-Palatinate.Orschiedt & Haidle 2006 The site, unlike the mass burials at Talheim and Schletz, serves as proof of ritual cannibalism rather than of the first signs of violence in Europe. Herxheim contained 173 skulls and skull-plates, and the scattered remains of at least 450 individuals. Two complete skeletons were found inside the inner ditch. The crania from these bodies were discovered at regular intervals in the two defensive ditches surrounding the site.Warfare and Conquest 2004 After the victims were decapitated, their heads were either thrown into the ditch or placed on top of posts that later collapsed inside the ditch. The heads showed signs of trauma from axes and one other weapon. Moreover, the organized placing of the skulls suggests a recurrent ritual act, instead of a single instance. Herxheim also contained various high-quality pottery artifacts and animal bones associated with the human remains. Unlike the mass burial at Talheim, scientists have concluded that instead of being a fortification, Herxheim was an enclosed center for ritual. ===Mass burial at Schöneck-Kilianstädten=== This Neolithic mass grave, also in modern-day Germany, may exhibit signs of deliberate mutilation and/or torture. Skeletal analysis of the interred remains showed a remarkably high percentage of long bones (especially in the lower leg) which were broken around the time of the individuals' deaths, which insinuates a deliberate targeting of these areas of the body, possibly as the victims were still alive. ==NotesBibliography== # Charles Scribner's Sons.

It was filmed on location in Nevada City, California and in Park City, Utah, and was released on December 2, 2006. ==Plot== In the midst of war in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Master Sergeant Cody Cullen (John Newton) is given a Christmas card from a fellow soldier who had received it from his hometown, Nevada City, California. The card was sent by Faith Spelman (Alice Evans). As months pass, the card never leaves his side. Cody, who has no family, and whose father was killed during the Vietnam War, is deeply affected when the soldier who gave him the card is killed. A few weeks before Christmas, Cody travels to see the soldier's widow, back in Nevada City. Just as he is about to leave town, Cody runs into Faith at a local luncheonette, where they happened to have placed identical orders. They part, but on his way out of town, Cody saves Faith's father, Luke (Ed Asner), from being hit by a speeding car. Luke takes a liking to Cody and convinces him to stay on as temporary help at his family's logging company. Paul (Ben Weber), Faith's longtime boyfriend who travels much of the time, and who selfishly wants Faith to move away from her close-knit family in Nevada City, arrives to meet her. Complicating matters, Cody has fallen in love with Faith and despite her attempts to ignore the feeling, they end up sharing a kiss. When Paul unexpectedly asks Faith to marry him, she says yes. Even so, Paul downplays Faith's wish to stay near her family in the \\"boondocks\\". This all comes to a head on Christmas Eve. On the church steps, Cody and Paul meet, and Cody admits that he loves Faith, but accepts that she's going to marry Paul instead, and hopes that Paul is marrying Faith \\"for all the right reasons\\". In church, in spite of the presence of Paul by her side, Faith keeps looking for Cody who has decided to leave. Paul notices and they step out and decide to part ways. Early on Christmas Day, Cody places a Christmas card on the family Christmas tree, which will direct the family to the Christmas present, a wooden bench (inscribed with \\"Where the Magic Begins\\") that he has been building to mark the family's favorite spot at a nearby lake where he and Faith first kissed. Cody leaves a Christmas card for Faith with a handwritten note, which she reads aloud. In the note, Cody confesses his love for Faith, and says goodbye. She asks her father whether it was her letter that brought Cody to Nevada City, to which Luke answers: no, you did. In the movie's final scene, Faith finds Cody at the local Vietnam War veterans' memorial. She chastises him for not saying goodbye, but before she can complete the sentence he kisses her, and she embraces him. ==Cast== * John Haymes Newton as (Sgt.)

Elevated faecal calprotectin indicates the migration of neutrophils to the intestinal mucosa, which occurs during intestinal inflammation, including inflammation caused by inflammatory bowel disease. Under a specific clinical scenario, the test may eliminate the need for invasive colonoscopy or radio-labelled white cell scanning. ==Structure and function== Calprotectin is a 24 kDa dimer of calcium binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9. The complex accounts for up to 60% of the soluble protein content of the neutrophil cytosol. In vitro studies show that calprotectin has bacteriostatic and fungistatic properties, that arise from its ability to sequester manganese and zinc. Calprotectin has two transition metal binding sites that form at the interface of the S100A8 and S100A9 monomers, and metal sequestration by calprotectin has been shown to be calcium dependent. The complex is resistant to enzymatic degradation, and can be easily measured in faeces. ==Use as a surrogate marker== {  style=\\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\\" !colspan=3 Reference ranges for calprotectin - Patient age Upper limit Unit -  2–9 years  166 rowspan=3 μg/g of faeces -  10–59 years  51 -  ≥ 60 years  112 } The main diseases that cause an increased excretion of faecal calprotectin are inflammatory bowel diseases, coeliac disease, infectious colitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal cystic fibrosis and colorectal cancer. Although a relatively new test, faecal calprotectin is regularly used as indicator for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) during treatment and as diagnostic marker. IBD are a group of conditions that cause a pathological inflammation of the bowel wall. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the principal types of inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory processes result in an influx of neutrophils into the bowel lumen. Since calprotectin comprises as much as 60% of the soluble protein content of the cytosol of neutrophils, it can serve as a marker for the level of intestinal inflammation. Measurement of faecal calprotectin has been shown to be strongly correlated with 111-indium-labelled leucocytes - considered the gold standard measurement of intestinal inflammation. Levels of faecal calprotectin are usually normal in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In untreated coeliac disease, concentration levels of faecal calprotectin correlate with the degree of intestinal mucosal lesion and normalize with a gluten-free diet. Faecal calprotectin is measured using immunochemical techniques such as ELISA or immunochromatographic assays. The antibodies used in these assays target specific epitopes of the calprotectin molecule. == False-positive measurements == Although faecal calprotectin correlates significantly with disease activity in people with confirmed IBD, faecal calprotectin can be false-positive if the laboratory uses low calprotectin cut-off levels. Most importantly, intake of non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (aspirin included) increases calprotectin values, possibly due to the associated induced enteropathy. == See also == * Calgranulin == References == Category:Diagnostic gastroenterology ","title":"Faecal calprotectin"},{"id":"20361954","text":"International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES), founded by Mohsen Ghafory-Ashtiany, is an international earthquake engineering and seismology institute based in Iran.

Both iopanoic acid and ipodate sodium are potent inhibitors of thyroid hormone release from thyroid gland, as well as of peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). These compounds inhibit 5'deiodinase (5'DID-1 and 5'DID-2) enzymes, which catalyse T4-T3 conversion in the thyroid cell, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, pituitary. This accounts for the dramatic improvement in both subjective and objective symptoms of hyperthyroidism, particularly when they are used as an adjunctive therapy with thioamides (propylthiouracil, carbimazole). They can be used in the treatment of patients with severe thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm) and significant morbidity (e.g., myocardial infarction, or stroke) for rapid control of elevated plasma triiodothyronine concentrations.

It consists of the organic acid DOTA as a chelating agent, and gadolinium (Gd3+), and is used in form of the meglumine salt (Gadoterate meglumine). The paramagnetic property of gadoteric acid reduces the T1 relaxation time (and to some extent the T2 and T2* relaxation times) in MRI, which is the source of its clinical utility. Because it has magnetic properties, gadoteric acid develops a magnetic moment when put under a magnetic field, which increases the signal intensity (brightness) of tissues during MRI imaging. ==Usage== It is used for imaging of blood vessels and inflamed or diseased tissue where the blood vessels become 'leaky'. It is often used when viewing intracranial lesions with abnormal vascularity or abnormalities in the blood–brain barrier. Gadoteric acid is used for MRI imaging of the brain, spine, and associated tissues for adult and pediatric (2 years of age or older) patients. The meglumine salt it takes the form of crosses the blood brain barrier of tissue with abnormal vasculature, highlighting the affected area with MRI. Gadoterate does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier, so it does not affect or enhance normal brain tissue in imaging. Dotarem is administered through an intravenous bolus injection, either manually or through a power injection. ==Adverse effects== The most common adverse effects (>0.2%) in clinical studies were nausea, headache, injection site pain, injection site coldness, and burning sensation. Drugs with gadolinium-based contrasting agents can increase the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) for those with impaired elimination of the drug. Those most at risk for NSF include patients with chronic or severe kidney disease and acute kidney injury. ==Availability== The drug, under the brand Dotarem, was brought to market by Guerbet. As of 2013 gadoteric acid was approved in around 70 countries. It was launched in the French market in 1989 and was FDA approved in the US in March, 2013. Dotarem is the seventh FDA approved GBCA for use in central nervous system (CNS) MRI. In 2017, GE Healthcare launched a gadoteric acid (as gadoterate meglumine) under the trade name Clariscan Other FDA approved GBCAs for similar purposes include Magnevist (1988), Prohance (1992), Omniscan (1993), Optimark (1999), Multihance (2004) and Gadavist (2011). == References == Category:Gadolinium compounds Category:MRI contrast agents ","title":"Gadoteric acid"},{"id":"20362216","text":"Rospo Pallenberg is a screenwriter and film director.

In the form of the methylglucamine salt meglumine gadobenate (INNm) or gadobenate dimeglumine (USAN), it is used as a gadolinium-based MRI contrast medium. BOPTA is a derivative of DTPA in which one terminal carboxyl group, –C(O)OH is replaced by -C–O–CH2C6H5. Thus gadobenic acid is closely related to gadopentetic acid. BOPTA itself was first synthesized in 1995. In the \\"gadobenate\\" ion gadolinium ion is 9-coordinate with BOPTA acting as an 8-coordinating ligand. The ninth position is occupied by a water molecule, which exchanges rapidly with water molecules in the immediate vicinity of the strongly paramagnetic complex, providing a mechanism for MRI contrast enhancement. 139La NMR studies on the diamagnetic La-BOPTA2− complex suggest that the Gd complex maintains in solution the same kind of coordination as found, by X-ray crystallography, in the solid state for Gd-BOPTA disodium salt. ==See also== * Gadopentetic acid * Gadoxetic acid ==References== Category:MRI contrast agents Category:Gadolinium compounds ","title":"Gadobenic acid"},{"id":"20362243","text":"Johannes West (born 1782, died 1835), was Denmark's inspector of Nordgrønland.

Telemann was born in Plön, the son of the local pastor Andreas Telemann (1715–1755) and his wife Augusta Clara Catharina Capsius. After the death of his father in 1755, he moved to Hamburg, where he was taken in and raised by his then 74 year old grandfather Georg Philipp Telemann. In Hamburg, he attended the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums, and from 1770, the Akademisches Gymnasium. On the death of his grandfather in 1767, the 19 year old Georg Michael composed Trauer-Ode auf das betrübte Absterben meines Großvaters Herrn Georg Philipp Telemann, des Hamburgischen Musik-Chor- Direktors. He also filled his grandfather's post as Cantor at the Johanneum and director of music in Hamburg's churches until March 1768, when Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was appointed. From 1770 to 1772 he studied at the University of Kiel. In 1773, while still in Hamburg, he published a treatise on continuo playing, Unterricht im Generalbaß-Spielen. In 1773, Georg Michael moved to Riga, where he was appointed as music director of the city churches and cantor at Riga Cathedral. As part of this job, he also directed the performance of twenty-one of his grandfather's passions. He also taught at the cathedral school. In 1812, he published a collection of Chorale settings for organ entitled Sammlung alter und neuer Choral-Melodien and a year later took the position of organist at the cathedral. He retired in 1828 due to a deteriorating eye condition. He died in Riga in 1831. ==External links== * ==References== Category:1748 births Category:1831 deaths Category:German classical composers Category:German music theorists Category:People from Plön (district) Category:German male classical composers Category:18th-century classical composers Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th- century German composers Category:18th-century German composers Category:18th- century male musicians Category:19th-century male musicians ","title":"Georg Michael Telemann"},{"id":"20362288","text":"\\"Poor Boy (The Greenwood)\\" is a song written by Jeff Lynne and the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO).

Sapacitabine is an orally available nucleoside analog prodrug of 2′-C-cyano-2′-deoxy-1-β-D- arabino-pentofuranosyl-cytosine (CNDAC) that acts through a dual mechanism. CNDAC lasts longer in the bloodstream by being metabolized from sapacitibine than it would do so by being directly administered. The compound interferes with DNA synthesis by causing single-strand DNA breaks due to CNDAC being incorporated into DNA during replication or repair, then inducing arrest of the cell division cycle at G2 phase. Both sapacitabine and its major metabolite, CNDAC, have demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in both blood and solid tumors in preclinical studies. In a liver metastatic mouse model, sapacitabine was shown to be superior to gemcitabine or 5-FU, two widely used nucleoside analogs, in delaying the onset and growth of liver metastasis. ==Clinical trials== Cyclacel has initiated a number of clinical trials to evaluate sapacitabine in both solid and hematological tumors laying the foundation for future Phase II studies and combination studies with other anti-cancer agents. Three Phase I clinical trial studies have been completed, which evaluated safety and pharmacokinetics of a variety of dosing schedules in approximately 120 patients with solid tumors. Sapacitabine is being evaluated as of March 2016 in three different studies; a Phase III trial for elderly patients with AML (acute myeloid leukemia), a Phase II trial for MDS (myelodysplastic syndromes), and a Phase I trial in combination with seliciclib for cancer treatment including hereditary ovarian and breast cancers. Thus far approximately 1,000 patients have received sapacitibine treatment in all phases of trials. An ongoing Phase III clinical trial, SEAMLESS, has 485 enrolled members and is open to elderly (70+ years of age) AML (acute myeloid leukemia) patients with good renal and liver function and who are not viable candidates for or have refused intensive induction chemotherapy. SEAMLESS is a global study with 118 different sites in the United States, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In the trial an arm of oral sapacitibine is given in alternating cycles with IV decitabine, which is compared to the control arm of IV decitabine alone. The SEAMLESS study was constructed based on the promising results of a Phase II one-year survival study for patients with AML. The efficacy goal of the treatment is overall survival; the average survival of an elderly person diagnosed with AML is approximately three to six months. The Data Safety Monitoring Board has communicated the unlikelihood that this Phase III study will reach a statistically significant survival improvement due to the planned futility boundary of 247 patient deaths already being crossed, but the trial is ongoing. During a poster session at the 2012 American Society of Hematology, results from a Phase I/II clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of the oral sapacitibine along with IV decitabine were presented, selected data highlights are as follows: median overall survival was approximately 8 months, patients still alive at 3 months was 83%, 35% of patients survived a year or longer, 2 dose-limiting toxicities in the form of lung infection and typhlitis were observed. For the Phase II trial for MDS patients so far, median survival overall was about 9.7 months, with the average median survival overall for patients receiving classic azacitidine or decitabine is approximately 4.3-5.9 months. More data will be arriving from the second half of this trial meant to allow better dosing regimens. The Phase II study for sapacitibine with seliciclib in advanced cancer patients is ongoing; so far, \\"durable partial responses\\" and \\"prolonged stable disease\\" have been seen particularly for patients with the BRCA mutations. In a group of 45 patients including those with breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, a \\"35.6% disease control rate was observed.\\" == Commercial Aspects and Intellectual Property == As of August 2016, Cyclacel had a 19.5 million dollar market capitalization and shares of the company have declined in value recently due to research and development costs of 2.6 million dollars and general and administrative expense costs of 1.3 million dollars.Fein, Andrew S., Emile Yu, and Rachel F. Lane. H.C.Wainwright & Co. Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 12 August 2016. Web. 5 November 2016. Cyclacel ended the last quarter in 2016 with 15.9 million dollars in cash and equivalents. An earnings report from H.C. Wainwright & Co. acknowledged how Cyclacel may at first seem like an unattractive investment but the ultimate risk/reward opportunity may be positive; sapacitibine has indeed shown very positive anti-tumor activity and has progressed to Phase III clinical trials for elderly patients with AML. Cyclacel holds worldwide right to commercialize sapacitibine, except in Japan for which Daiichi Sankyo \\"has a right of first negotiation\\". They currently have essentially all marketing rights globally for the compounds in association with their drug development programs. Numerous patents from Cyclacel are found related to sapacitibine and sapacitibine dosing regimes along with other drugs such as decitibine. There are patents and applications that no longer apply to current use of sapacitibine, some involving administration of sapacitibine and seliciclib. Cyclacel currently has no sales or marketing capability and so will rely on alliances to distribute and commercialize the various drugs they hope to bring through the development pipeline.

In preservation it has carried the name Hercules. == Service == No. 4277 was built at the GWR's Swindon Works in 1920, Works No. 2857. It was painted in unlined green livery with \\"Great Western\\" on the tank sides. From 1934 a round GWR logo replaced the lettering, and this in turn was replaced in 1942 by the letters \\"G W R\\". In 1948 the locomotive passed into British Railways (BR) ownership and was given the power classification 7F. In BR ownership the livery was unlined black. It spent most of its working life in South Wales on freight trains and was withdrawn in 1964 from Aberbeeg Shed (BR shed code 86H) after 44 years of service. == Preservation == 4277 was moved to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Glamorgan shortly after withdrawal and remained there for 20 years until 1986 when it was privately purchased. In 2008 it was sold to the Dartmouth Steam Railway. The locomotive was then painted in lined GWR Brunswick Green livery. On 1 August 2008 it was named Hercules, the nameplates being located on the smokebox. The nameplates are historically inauthentic for this locomotive. The name Hercules was carried by three GWR locomotives, a broad gauge locomotive of the Hercules Class, the later 3031 Class No. 3043 and GWR Crane Tank 0-6-4 No. 16.

The catalyst for this was the Crichel Down Affair.(The affair of land being leased by the Ministry of Agriculture in the Attlee government instead of it being returned to its original owners as promised by Churchill). However, this was a result of a decision by the British Government and the Franks committee was told to limit its discussion to formal statutory procedure and not to go into decisions of the courts or one-off decisions, which excluded the Crichel decision. ==Basic assumptions of the report== Tribunals are an adjudicating, rather than administrative, body and they should be fair, open and impartial.(Cmnd 218 (1957)). Openness is for publicity of proceedings and the reasoning behind the decision. Fairness through having a clear procedure, allowing participants to present their case fully and knowledge of requirements to meet for parties. Impartiality established from independence from the real or apparent influence of the administration. ==Aims and recommendationsConstitution of tribunals=== Chairman to be chosen by the Lord Chancellor, normally having legal qualifications for trial and mandatory for appellate tribunals. Rest of members to be chosen by the Council of Tribunals. ===Procedure of tribunals=== The Council of Tribunals should direct the particular procedure in each case, with the aim of combining order with an informal atmosphere. Citizens should have a prior knowledge of the right to apply to participate and public knowledge of the proceedings unless the content is of sensitive nature, with legal representation normally allowed. Tribunals empowered to take evidence under oath, subpoena witnesses and award remedies. Decisions should give full reasons and a copy sent to all parties. Final appellate tribunal to publish its decision for lower tribunals. ===Appeals from tribunal decisions=== Appeal in the first instance should be to an appellate tribunal, but never to a minister unless the First Instance tribunal is highly competent. Common law remedies of Certiorari (direction to send records), mandamus (mandatory order) and writ of prohibition (abstain a court where it lacks competence) should never be restricted. Also the report recommended that a Councils of Tribunals be formed to perform their respective role as envisaged in the report. ==Achievements== Most of the recommendations were implemented by the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958 and Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992; others were implemented by administrative practice.Tribunals Working and number council of tribunal was mentioned in the schedules, with their function being advisory, but they could make recommendations on any matter and had to be consulted before any rule was enacted. Right to give reasons was added, but it had to be asked for before or during the decision, and judicial review restricted the right in a few instances. List of tribunals could be stopped by ministerial power. The report’s recommendations were not followed where appeals to the High Court (Court of Session in Scotland) were only permitted based on law and the procedure to appoint chairman and members. == References == Category:Public inquiries in the United Kingdom Category:1957 in British politics Category:United Kingdom tribunals ","title":"Franks Report (1957)"},{"id":"20362391","text":"Poster for the 1921 film A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a 1921 American silent film adaptation of Mark Twain's 1889 novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.

Best known for performing live in small venues in New York State, Coryell has also opened for George Thorogood, Gregg Allman, B.B. King and Wilson Pickett. While touring the United States, he uses local session musicians for his performances rather than traveling with a regular backing band. ==Life and career== Murali Coryell was born to Julie Coryell and famed jazz fusion guitarist Larry Coryell. Murali's first interest was in playing the drums but, in a move he calls \\"inevitable\\", he switched to guitar at a young age. Wanting to avoid competition with his father and his brother, Julian, he perfected his own more mainstream style of soul and blues which draws comparisons to Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana. Others have likened his style to the Memphis soul produced by labels such as Hi and Stax Records. Coryell graduated from Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut, in 1987. He received a BA in music theory and composition from the SUNY New Paltz Music Department in 1992. The title of his second album 2120 was a reference to 2120 South Michigan Avenue, the address of now-defunct R&B; record label Chess Records.

It is closely related to the natural alkaloid colchicine with the replacement of the acetyl group on the amino moiety with methyl, but it is less toxic. It depolymerises microtubules and limits microtubule formation (inactivates spindle fibre formation), thus arresting cells in metaphase and allowing cell harvest and karyotyping to be performed. During cell division, demecolcine inhibits mitosis at metaphase by inhibiting spindle formation. Medically, demecolcine has been used to improve the results of cancer radiotherapy by synchronising tumour cells at metaphase, the radiosensitive stage of the cell cycle. In animal cloning procedures, demecolcine makes an ovum eject its nucleus, creating space for insertion of a new nucleus. ==Mechanism of action== Demecolcine is a microtubule-depolymerizing drug like vinblastine. It acts by two distinct mechanisms. At very low concentration it binds to microtubule plus end to suppress microtubule dynamics. Recent study has found at higher concentration demecolcine can promote microtubule detachment from microtubule organizing center. Detached microtubules with unprotected minus end depolymerize with time. Cytotoxicity of the cells seems to correlate better with microtubule detachment. Lower concentration affects microtubule dynamics and cell migration. == Research use== Demecolcine is used for scientific research in cells. It is used in a variety of ways, however, until recently, was used mostly for the study of mitosis in cells. For example, microtubules are necessary for the splitting of cells. More importantly, the movement of chromosomes during the M phase. Demecolcine inhibition of microtubules causes aneuploidy in mitotic cells where the microtubules fall apart or are suppressed before they can complete their function of pulling chromosomes into the daughter cell, also known as nondisjunction of chromosomes. Demecolcine, depending on dose, has also been found to cause DNA fragmentation of chromosomes in micronuclei when nondisjunction occurs. == References == Category:Pyrogallol ethers Category:Microtubule inhibitors Category:Heptalenes Category:Tropolones Category:Amines ","title":"Demecolcine"},{"id":"20362451","text":"Brockton Brightfield in Brockton, Massachusetts is a solar power plant in New England.

It seems to enhance aerobic glycolysis in normal cells, but suppress glycolysis in cancer cells. This is most likely through the inhibition of the mitochondrially bound hexokinase. Later studies in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells showed that lonidamine inhibits both respiration and glycolysis leading to a decrease in cellular ATP. Clinical trials of lonidamine in combination with other anticancer agents for a variety of cancers has begun. This is due to its proven ability to inhibit energy metabolism in cancer cells, and to enhance the activity of anticancer agents. Lonidamine has been used in the treatment of brain tumours in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide. An in- vitro study showed that a combination of temozolomide and lonidamine at clinically achievable, low plasma concentrations, could inhibit tumour growth, and lonidamine could reduce the dose of temozolomide required for radiosensitization of brain tumours.

Most of all, since the property bubble has been the driving force in GDP growth in Bulgaria most players in the market, including government have been satisfied with the situation. == Dynamics == Provided that growth in GDP continued and that property prices had been sustained during the Financial crisis, there was a possibility that the growth of the bubble would return in late 2009, or early 2010. However, since October 2008 there has been sharp drop in the real estate market, including: * fewer property buyers * considerable drop in property prices * sharp decrease in property sales * many real estate companies have closed or temporary suspended operations Among other reasons the current property bubble burst, there is the factor of increased interest rates and bank requirements to provide mortgages, which were part of the reason why the previous conditions of late 2005 and early 2006 had provided for easy access to loans for many Bulgarians. It may be accurate to say that the beginning of the bubble burst occurred somewhere around July–August 2008; however, the visible tipping point is October 2008. Analyzing several different sources, including media, several online portals and property experts, the burst was long expected, and the Global Financial crisis was only the catalyst of events, since most financial institutions in Bulgaria are foreign investments. The contribution of foreign investment to the Bulgarian property market has been significant. In 2006, more than 29% of property deals were signed by foreigners, more than half of whom were UK citizens.

He is considered one of Iran's leading experts on earthquakes and seismic activity. Dr. Akasheh has done much work in Iran to encourage scientific research and study into earthquakes and possible mitigation measures as a response. He is a strong advocate of urban development which is coordinated with the tight regulations imposed in the 1989 seismic code in Iran by the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology. He has also expressed a disagreement and disapproval with the notion in Iran that natural disasters are God given and has stressed the importance of science and technology and the extent to which the effects of a potential disaster can be curbed. According to Akasheh, \\"Earthquake education is very poor in Iran. Most people think that whatever God wills, will happen. This is absolutely wrong. This thinking is poisonous\\". Akasheh has been one of the foremost proponents for moving the Iranian capital of Tehran to Isfahan because of a distinct threat from a devastating earthquake. According to Akasheh's calculations, there is a 90 percent chance of a 6.0-magnitude quake hitting the capital and a 50 percent chance of 7.5-magnitude earthquake. The vast majority of buildings in Tehran are located on the convergence of some 100 known fault lines which in its present architectural form are incapable of withstanding even a moderate earthquake. A hypothesis presented by Akasheh indicates that a 6.8 quake in Tehran would kill more than 700,000 people. According to Akasheh, \\"Tehran must be rebuilt; if not it should be moved. Either we have to put up with millions of dead, millions of injured, or we need to move the capital somewhere else and take steps to decrease the population here and make Tehran more resistant to earthquakes.\\" Following the serious damage caused by the 2003 Bam earthquake, Akasheh wrote to the President of Iran, Mohammed Khatami, in 2004 requesting a move of the capital to Isfahan which had been the nation's main centre during the Persian Empire.

It is being developed by Synta Pharmaceuticals and GlaxoSmithKline as a chemotherapy adjuvant, and has received both fast track and orphan drug status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Retrieved November 30, 2008. Synta Pharmaceuticals announced on February 26, 2009 the suspension of all clinical trials involving Elesclomol due to safety concerns. In March 2010, Synta announced that the FDA had approved resuming clinical development of elesclomol, and that they expected to initiate one or more clinical trials for elesclomol in the second half of the year. In a small, randomized phase II study, elesclomol was shown to significantly increase progression-free survival in people with metastatic melanoma when given in addition to paclitaxel (Taxol). Retrieved November 30, 2008. Results from a phase III trial were announced in March 2013. The study was halted when it was determined that addition of elesclomol to paclitaxel didn't significantly increase progression-free survival. Studies in preclinical models suggested that Elesclomol may be effective in Ewing sarcoma cells with elevated levels of cellular oxidative stress. ==Mechanism of action== Elesclomol induces oxidative stress by provoking a buildup of reactive oxygen species within cancer cells. Elesclomol requires a redox active metal ion to function.

The road, which has almost entirely fallen out of use, follows the free draining ridge of greensand which lies north of the South Downs. It is a planned route rather than a Romanised Iron Age track, following a few straight alignments without any steep gradients, which linked various north-south roads and tracks. A number of important Roman villas and their farming estates were linked by the road.Helen Livingston, In the Footsteps of Caesar: Walking Roman Roads in Britain 1995 BCA pp30-32 It is not known at what time during the Roman period the road was built. ==The route== Branching from the London to Eastbourne area Roman road at Barcombe Mills, north of Lewes the road runs west through East Chiltington then passes the south side of Plumpton Racecourse (where the agger runs beside the tarmac entrance road for some 200 m) then on to Streat, a Saxon placename indicative of a Roman road. Passing north of Ditchling and through Keymer it crosses the London to Brighton Way Roman road at Hassocks, where there was a Roman cemetery. West of Hassocks the road turns a little to the south, passing through Bedlam Street south of Hurstpierpoint where it briefly runs on a prominent agger alongside and then crosses the B2117, and continues past Woodmancote to Woods Mill, with short sections under or adjacent to the Woods Mill to Woodmancote road. The road then runs across the River Adur floodplain, where the Adur was bridged on wooden piles close to Stretham Manor. From the river the road runs west to the moated Buncton Manor Farm where it turns north west to West Chiltington and crosses the River Arun floodplain to join Stane Street at Hardham Remains of a Roman bath house have been found east of the junction and there was a posting station or Mansio on Stane Street at Hardham.Alex Vincent, Roman Roads of Sussex Middleton Press 2000 p31 ==Purposes of the road== Stretham Manor by the River Adur takes its name from the road The road linked numerous villa estates along the greensand ridge and joined various north-south routes. There was a Roman temple at Chanctonbury Ring and a large cemetery has been found near a crossroads at Hassocks. The course of the London to Brighton Roman road south of Burgess Hill by Glen Shields p86 Retrieved 26 October 2008 The road is unlikely to have had any military importance in the early Roman period when the empire was at the zenith of its power and the Sussex area was a friendly client kingdom, but as Saxon and Jute raiding became a problem along the coasts the inland route may have become a safer alternative to the coastal roads. In the aftermath of Roman rule it took some fourteen years for Saxon settlers in the Chichester area to overcome Romano-British resistance based on the fortress of Anderida at Pevensey. The road may have had military importance during this time. ==Construction== Sections made through some better preserved parts of the road show it to have been of light construction with about of metalling, usually on a low agger, but in drier places laid direct on the natural subsoil. The width of metalling varies from at the wider points, on an agger about wide, down to on terraceways crossing hillsides. The metalling on this road has been found to be flint at all the points studied, with a camber of about .I D Margary, Roman Ways in the Weald Phoenix House, Revised 1965 pp165-184 Well preserved examples of the agger occur along the south side of Plumpton Racecourse and adjoining the B2117 road south of Hurstpierpoint. ==ReferencesSee also== * Roman Britain * Roman roads in Britain Category:Roman roads in England Category:Archaeological sites in East Sussex Category:Roads in East Sussex Category:Roads in West Sussex ","title":"Sussex Greensand Way"},{"id":"20362797","text":"Zapman may refer to: * Charley Bones (also known as \\"Zapman\\"), a fictional character from the television series Mona the Vampire * Captain Zapman, a character from the movie Oh Shucks!

The Taklung Kagyu lineage remains unbroken to this day. Taklung Thangpa Tashi Pal founded the Taklung Yarthang Monastery. He is considered as one of the many immediate students of Pal Phagmo Drupa. ==Early years== Tashi Pal was born in 1142 AD, to the Taklung Gazi family, one of the six main ancestral Tibetan lineages. He embraced monkhood in Pal Thang-kya Monastery, where he studied and mastered the general and distinct Buddhist teachings. Owing to his vast and profound knowledge of Buddhist doctrine, he was renowned as the great sovereign and accomplished master scholar. He travelled towards Central Tibet where he met his destined root teacher, Phagmo Drupa. For six years, Tashi Pal served his master as his personal attendant during which time he received the entire tantric and sutric teachings, including the ripening empowerment and liberating instructions of the great Mahamudra and the six yogic teachings of Naropa. Later, he spent many years in six different solitary places staying in extremely strict retreat practice by sealing off his retreat room. As a result, he achieved the supreme siddhi of enlightenment. ==Taklung Kagyu== In the year 1180 AD, he established the seat and the distinct tradition of Taklung Kagyu at Taklung Thang Dorje Den. Since then, his name came to be known as Taklung Thangpa and his distinct tradition renowned as the unequalled lineage of accomplishment, the Taklung Kagyu. The main teaching of Taklung Kagyu is Guru Yoga and the main practice devotion and reverence towards one's root teacher. Specifically Vinaya practice was greatly emphasized. As such, Taklung Thangpa Tashi Pal, fully ordained and holder of the Vajrayana doctrine, came to be famously known for his pure morality. ==Legacy== He devoted the first half of every month to bless and teach students, and the second half to strict retreat practice. Generally, there were more than 3600 resident monks in Taklung Monastery during his time, and his disciples came from different places in India, China, Mongolia, and the three provinces of Tibet. After giving final advice to his followers, Taklung Thangpa achieved the non-dual state of Vajradhara and died to pass into nirvana, dissolving his body and mind into the Dharmakaya in the year 1210. This was displayed to allow beings to realize the impermanent nature of life. ==Sources== *http://www.taklungkagyu.com/aboutus.php?id=2 ==External links== * Tashi Pal Four Gems Library, Near the Riwoche Great Monastery, Kham Riwoche, East Tibet * Kyabgon Phakchok Rinpoche site * Riwoche Tibetan Buddhist temple (Canada) * Mangala Shri foundation (Canada) Category:1142 births Category:1210 deaths Category:Taklung Kagyu Lamas ","title":"Taklung Thangpa Tashi Pal"},{"id":"20362933","text":"Bryerson may refer to: * Mrs. Bryerson, a fictional character from the television series Mona the Vampire * Dawn Bryerson, a fictional character from the film Blackwoods ==See also== * Bryer (disambiguation) * Son (disambiguation) ","title":"Bryerson"},{"id":"20362940","text":"Madanpur, Nepal may refer to: *Madanpur, Bagmati *Madanpur, Narayani ","title":"Madanpur, Nepal"},{"id":"20362972","text":"Borislav Borisov () (born November 12, 1954) is a Bulgarian sprint canoer who competed from the late 1970s to the early 1980s.

On leaving school he entered the antiquarian book business and attended the West of England College of Art. Helps married Irene Orr on 8 April 1936.

He used to tell his young daughter a bedtime story every night. His first notable success as an author and artist came during World War II with stories written for her. When the war came, Anne was packed off to a less noisy part of the country, but she still insisted on her story, and so Helps wrote them down for her, drew pictures to illustrate them, and sent them to her. During that time, Racey and Irene lived in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, and were hosts to many young American soldiers based in the town, besides running a hairdressing salon. On one occasion a publisher happened to drop in and pick up one of Helps's handwritten, illustrated booklets. Helps was invited to London to discuss publication of future work. Helps's stories were published initially by Collins and later by the Medici Society.Licensing – Racey Helps The Medici Society. He contributed to several children's annuals published by Collins.

The film centers on a mentally disturbed individual simply known as \\"The Man\\", who has cannibalistic fantasies, who makes a deal with a suicidal man known as \\"The Flesh\\" who agrees to let The Man eat him. == Plot == In the intro, a mother reads the story of Hansel and Gretel to her young boy. The setting then moves to the present day, where The Man goes about his day-to-day routines and occasionally chats with others on his computer, where he looks for someone who shares his cannibalistic fantasies. The Man meets with several people he had chatted with, but he either rejects them or is rejected (and in one case attacked) by them, except for The Flesh, a suicidal man who volunteers to be killed and eaten by The Man. The Flesh travels to The Man from Berlin, and the two bond, having sex and frolicking in the nude both inside and around The Man's home. When The Flesh decides that its time for him to die and be devoured, he tries to coerce The Man into biting off his penis, but The Man is unable to go through with it, even when The Flesh uses drugs to knock himself out in an attempt to make things easier. Disappointed, The Flesh chastises The Man. The Flesh decides to give him another chance when The Man begs him to stay just as he is about to board a train back to Berlin. Returning to The Man's home, The Flesh ingests a large amount of alcohol and pills, then instructs The Man to castrate him with a kitchen knife, which The Man succeeds at doing. The two then fry and attempt to eat the severed penis, before The Flesh seemingly dies of blood loss in a bath The Man places The Flesh in. The Man drags The Flesh's inert body (which vomits and defecates repeatedly) to a room he has readied for slaughter. Before he can begin taking The Flesh apart, The Man is shocked to discover The Flesh is still alive, so he stabs him in the throat. The Man then beheads, guts and dismembers The Flesh, buries the inedible parts, and cooks and eats the rest; he places The Flesh's severed head at the head of the table. The Man then masturbates to video footage of what he has done, and leaves. == Cast == * Carsten Frank as The Man * Victor Brandl as The Flesh * Manoush as The Man's Mother * L. Dora * Carina Palmer * Tobias Sickert * Joachim Sigl * Bernd Widmann == Production == Cannibal is based on the true story of Armin Meiwes who killed and ate a man whom he met on the Internet. In 2004 director Marian Dora, accepted Ulli Lommel's assignment to make a feature film in Germany that documented the Meiwes case. Dora's finished film was rejected by Lommel as being too gory, and Dora subsequently released the movie on his own in Germany within months. Lommel set about producing his own version of the Meiwes case, which became the 2007 film Diary of a Cannibal. == Release Home media=== Cannibal was released on DVD in Germany in April 2006. The film was later released on DVD in the United States by Anthem Pictures on December 19, 2006. The film also was released by Unearthed Films in a now out of print DVD. ===Censorship=== Cannibal was banned after its release in Germany on Meiwes’ request. == Reception == Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk rated the film 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"One of the sickest and freakiest movies ever to come from a nation well-known for its freaky and sick movies (Germany), Cannibal is shocking, outrageous, sickening ... and just a little bit interesting because it's based on actual events.\\" Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"The only real selling point Cannibal has is its graphic depiction of cannibalism. There are some nasty, nasty moments throughout, but you have to get through a whole lot of nothing before you see them.\\" Sean Leonard from HorrorNews.net praised the film, writing, \\"This is the first movie in a long time that disturbed me to my core. The entire second half of this movie is non-stop suffering, sadness, dismemberment, and cannibalism. It feels very real, like the viewer is watching from the next room, but also like the viewer is watching something real.

Most bowling leagues consist of four team players that meet up once a week or once every other week, usually at the same day and time. Teams of three or five players are also common. Leagues can be set up as male-only, female-only, or mixed. Four-person teams tend to be used in mixed leagues, while three- and five-player teams are more common in male-only and female-only leagues. Leagues were established soon after the most modern type of bowling was created. Ten-pin bowling is a modern form of bowling that became organized in 1895 in New York City. Each session, each team in the league faces one other team. In most bowling leagues each team plays three games per scheduled match. After the first week of the league, the average for each player is set, and the average can go up or down after each subsequent session as more games are bowled. Though there are \\"scratch\\" leagues where only actual score counts, most leagues use the bowler averages to determine team and/or individual handicaps. The handicap is the difference of the sum of averages between the two teams that are facing each other (sometimes then multiplied by a percentage, such as 90%), or an amount calculated from a score that is above the highest team average in the league so that each team gets a handicap amount. The handicap gives teams with lower averages a chance to compete against teams with higher averages. There are often weekly and seasonal cash prizes and pools that go along with the game. The point of this is to have something to work for. Some leagues will have strike pools or spare pools. This is when team members put in money to play the game. The first person to get a certain amount of strikes or spares wins the total amount of money that everyone put in. In some cases, a ticket is drawn and the bowler holding that ticket must roll a strike to win the jackpot. If no one wins it in one week, then the money carries over to the next week until someone finally gets a strike. Other common jackpots are high scratch game, high handicap game, and \\"mystery\\" game (where a score is drawn and anyone whose game matched that score wins a prize). Bowling leagues normally attract an adult crowd, whether it is duck pin bowling or ten-pin bowling. However youth bowling leagues are also common, particularly on weekend afternoons. == League scoring == Leagues normally consist of weekly sessions that require each bowler on a team to bowl three games per week (or more/less depending on the league's rules). Some leagues have special prize funds accumulated by a small weekly fee (above that which is paid to the bowling center) that can fund prizes at the end of the season. In a given weekly session, each team will face another team in the league in scheduled competition. Teams are awarded points for winning each game, plus points for having more total pins than the other team at the end of all games that week. Scoring systems vary by league. League standings are published after each session, and teams with more points at the end of a season (or end of a half in split seasons) generally win the most money or a special prize. ==External links== * * == Resources == \\"Bowling for All\\" by:Joe Falcaro \\"The Book of Rules: A visual guide to the laws of every commonly played sport and game.\\" by:Duncan Peterson Category:Ten-pin bowling competitions ","title":"Bowling league"},{"id":"20363227","text":"A mature Checkered Giant rabbit (black variety) A 3-month old Checkered Giant rabbit (black variety) The Checkered Giant is a breed of domestic rabbit that originated in France (Géant Papillon in French).

Airing annually on RTÉ One near the end of November or early December to coincide with the Holiday shopping season, the Toy Show showcases the popular toys of the year, as presented by the host and demonstrated by various children on-stage, along with appearances by celebrity guests. Since its first presentation in 1975, the Toy Show has become a cultural institution in Ireland; it is often the most-watched program of the year on Irish television (and its overall viewership has increased steadily in recent years), and being featured on the Toy Show has been said to have a major boost to sales of a product heading into the Christmas season. Commercial time during the Toy Show is also prestigious for advertisers; in 2009, a 30-second spot cost €17,000; in comparison, a 30-second spot during the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final cost €9,750. Tickets to its taping are also difficult to come by; in one year, a single ticket was auctioned for €1,500. Most recently presented by Ryan Tubridy, the show has previously been presented by Gay Byrne and Pat Kenny during their tenures at the helm. Dustin the Turkey, a high-profile entertainment figure in Ireland, made an annual appearance, usually bringing a gift for the presenter. These gifts when produced tended to have a comedy effect and in the past have included a miniature antique chair and a Pat Kenny clock, ominously presented to Kenny's predecessor Gay Byrne. Dustin has not made an appearance on the show since 2007. The Toy Show, along with the Tribute Shows, tends to be one of the few editions of The Late Late Show to require advance preparation before the week of broadcast. ==Jumper== The Toy Show jumper attracts as much attention as the show itself, with viewers sending in their own versions to RTÉ ahead of the night in the hope that the presenter might wear them. Gay Byrne habitually wore a Christmas jumper each year he also wore the jumper for People In Need Telethon, but Pat Kenny tended to wear a \\"naff\\" grey jumper when he was host. Ryan Tubridy also spoke in favour of the jumper when he took the helm. Byrne was noted for his \\"Bing Crosby sweater\\". > Some of the sweaters we got in this year are so bad, the people who knitted > them should be put on trial in The Hague for crimes against Christmas. Ryan Tubridy expressed his distaste for the selection of jumpers he received from fans in 2011. Audience members also appear in Christmas wear such as hats, antlers and even jumpers. ==History== In 1994, it was broadcast on 9 December and attracted an audience so high that it did not come close again until the 2010 edition. In 1997, Dustin presented Gay Byrne with a miniature antique chair during the veteran presenter's second-last Toy Show. The stunt alluded to a controversy that occurred when the winner of an antiques restoration competition run by the show claimed credit for a chair which had been worked on by another person. Among the show's other memorable moments over the years are Junior Culchie of the Year Mark McSharry from County Cavan in his mini-motorised toy tractor, the little girl who said she did not like Justin Bieber \\"'cus he's so full of himself\\", Pat Kenny mispronouncing Jerry \\"Seinfield\\"'s name before presenting him with his very own cheap Superman toy, and - what is considered \\"the ultimate Toy Show moment\\" by many and \\"possibly the ultimate moment of all time\\", voted the number 1 moment in an RTÉ Player poll in 2014 -little John Joe Brennan's dissection of the collected works of Roald Dahl--\\"I find him very poetic\\" and \\"for children fantasy always comes first.\\" And his ambition to be a horologist. Jerry Seinfeld waves to the audience after being presented with his Superman on the 2007 Toy Show. Host Pat Kenny stands to the right clapping his hands together. ==2000s2005 edition=== The 2005 Toy Show was broadcast on 2 December 2005, attracting 1.1 million viewers as the most watched programme on Irish television that year. It was also the most watched edition of The Late Late Show since Gay Byrne's final show in 1999. Irish comedian Dave McSavage, appeared in the opening ceremony for this Toy Show, playing a selfish scrooge. ===2006 edition=== {  !2006 guests - George Galloway - Janette Byrne - Oliver stone } The 2006 Toy Show was broadcast on 1 December 2006. Six-year- old Millie (Philomena) Murray, who, along with her four-year-old brother Gavin Murray, had recently been burned out of her car in Limerick, left her hospital bed to make an appearance. She requested a doll to play with for the show. Her brother was too unwell to feature on the show after the incident that led to over twelve weeks of hospital treatment for the pair. Pat Kenny was later criticised in a study by the Equality Authority for his hosting of the show, in which he persistently reinforced stereotypes of gender roles. An example was a human skull shown to ooze slime, of which the presenter uttered the comment \\"made for boys, I think\\". ===2007 edition=== { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! ccf;\\"  2007 guests - ! ececec;\\"  James Blunt - ! ececec;\\"  Jerry Seinfeld - ! ececec; padding:0 4px;\\"  Dustin the Turkey - ! ececec; padding:0 4px;\\"  Róisín Seoighe } The 2007 Toy Show was broadcast on 30 November 2007, attracting over one million viewers or seven tenths of the available audience, making it the most watched television programme in Ireland at that time of 2007. Broadcast over the traditional four parts, it contained a performance from James Blunt, the annual appearance of Dustin, book reviews and Miriam O'Shea who performed a rendition of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\". The 2007 Toy Show also played host to an interview with comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Kenny expressed a lack of knowledge about his subject from the very beginning when he introduced him as \\"Jerry Seinfield\\". There was much uncomfortable chat on the topic of bees (Seinfeld was on the show to promote his new movie, Bee Movie) and Kenny then presented him with a cheap imitation of his favourite superhero, Superman. Seinfeld, who had previously lashed out at Larry King over his ignorance, remained tight-lipped and walked off without informing Kenny of his correct name. The 2007 Toy Show was opened by the soprano Oisín Nolan who ascended a hanging crescent moon as Kenny entered the studio fresh from his visit to Santa in Lapland. Roisin Seoighe (7) Conemara performed Sean Nos dancing wearing her trademark red dance shoes along with music played by the Castlemahon Buskers. She danced a reel and got a fantastic applause from the audience. The Castle Mahon Buskers came from Newcastle West, County Limerick, and have four members. Two bodhrán players performed, an accordion player and a spoons player. The show was closed by The Young Wexford Singers and Rowe Street Junior Choir. Thus far, this was Dustin's last appearance on the Toy Show. ===2008 edition=== { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! ccf;\\"  2008 guests - ! ececec;\\"  Nicky Byrne (with Rocco and Jay) - ! ececec;\\"  McFlyPat Kenny on The Cafe. 28 November 2008. - ! ececec;\\"  Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson - ! ececec;\\"  Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James MayPat Kenny on RTÉ announcement. 21:00 - } The 2008 Toy Show aired on 28 November 2008 and was Pat Kenny's tenth and final Toy Show. It achieved a total audience of 1,199,000 to become the most viewed television programme across all channels available in Ireland since 2001. It was the fourth consecutive year that the show cleared the one million viewers mark, with 275,000 of those watching being children and almost 800,000 watchers being adults. The highlight was the opening, which first showed Kenny standing on a railing outside the RTÉ studios in Donnybrook putting an extra light bulb on to the lights. A boy, Anthony Malone from Tullamore, then switched on the lights which went all over the country. Anthony then picked up a present and passed it to the other kids in a pass the parcel like fashion, while a little girl (Lauren Norton) sang a rendition of Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas Is You. The show then proceeded to the main studio where kids dressed as elves and Santa's sang the song and passed the parcel to the audience who passed it on to Kenny who was standing at the top of the audience before the piece ended and he welcomed the audience. Afterwards Dustin's absence from the Toy Show was noted when Kenny opened the parcel and said with a sigh of relief: \\"Thank goodness it's not Dustin!\\". It was an Elmo toy. A young people's show on RTÉ Two called Ice had snuck a teddy bear into the set which was spotted on camera during a performance on the show. The programme proved controversial, with controversy beginning to generate one week before broadcast, when the current value of tickets was questioned. When a competition winner refused two tickets to the show as her prize at the end of the 21 November edition of The Late Late Show, visibly infuriated presenter Pat Kenny tore them up live on air. Kenny questioned why she had entered the competition if she had not wanted to attend the Toy Show (the tickets were just part of the prize; also on offer was €10,000). In the aftermath, the winner, identified as Barbara Heavey from Cork, explained to a newspaper that she had entered the competition \\"out of boredom\\", had \\"no interest in watching children play with toys for two hours\\" and had no children of her own. She did not see the actual tearing of the tickets as she had turned off the television \\"to prevent an echo on the line\\" and attempted to suggest that they either be raffled or donated to someone else only to be drowned out by Kenny and his audience's vocal disbelief. Despite numerous attempts by RTÉ to have her attend, she said she would be \\"bored stiff\\", wasn't interested in toys and, if she had to attend the show, would probably \\"set off the smoke alarms by chain- smoking in the toilets\\". Kenny did not let the matter rest however, opening his morning radio show the following Monday with a five-minute chat to his listeners in which he implied that the torn-up tickets were of more value than All Ireland final and Munster v. All Blacks tickets. Within minutes footage was uploaded onto the video hosting website YouTube, with spoofs of the incident also created. and Heavey was congratulated in numerous national newspapers. Two and a half hours before the 2008 Toy Show got underway Kenny appeared on Aidan Power's The Cafe with alter-ego Oliver Callan. (19:00). Kenny revealed McFly would perform, the only guest he was willing to reveal to Power. Power then mimicked the torn ticket incident by teasing Kenny with two tickets before plucking them from his grasp and tearing them into pieces, after which Kenny engaged in some turkey dialogue with the rest of The Cafe. In an announcement aired before the Nine O'Clock News, Kenny let slip that Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May from Top Gear would appear. During the show, Kenny once again referenced the ticket fiasco when, whilst promoting another competition with a prize of a car and €10,000, he said he would \\"tear up\\" the vehicle if the winner refused to take it. Nicky Byrne from Westlife appeared with his twin sons Rocco and Jay and met 10-year-old Shauna Byrne, a fan of his who was battling cystic fibrosis at the time but later died on 30 January 2009. Sarah Ferguson was present for the annual children's book section, where she listened to some of the children speak the Irish language. McFly, in their second Toy Show appearance, performed \\"Do Ya\\" from their Radioactive album. The closing act was RTÉ Cór na nÓg, singing \\"Jingle Bells\\". ===2009 edition=== { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! ccf;\\"  2009 guests - ! ececec;\\"  Westlife - ! ececec;\\"  Jedward - ! ececec;\\"  Evanna Lynch - ! ececec; padding:0 4px;\\"  - } The 2009 Toy Show aired on 27 November 2009 and was Ryan Tubridy's first Toy Show. The presenter suggested prior to the show that there was uncertainty over whether he would wear the jumper traditionally worn each year. He wore a maroon jumper on the night. Tubridy's daughter Ella attended the show. The 2009 theme was The Wizard of Oz, with a yellow brick road being especially constructed for the occasion. Elles Divas, three schoolgirls from County Offaly, performed \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" during the first part of the show. At one point Tubridy was asked to attempt to moonwalk by two children, responding in a joking manner: \\"You didn't do this in rehearsals, lads\\". Jedward, wearing glistening bronze suits on their first appearance on Irish television, caused controversy when John swore live on air after tearing his trousers whilst performing a sequence of acrobatic movements around the set. He used the words, \\"Oh shit. I ripped my pants\\". Ten security guards were required to take care of the twins, who rose to fame on UK talent show The X Factor. Thousands of females fans surrounded RTÉ's studios to catch a glimpse of the pair who spent time in the audience live on air. Tubridy was later criticised by their manager Louis Walsh for giving them a \\"hard time\\". The programme attracted an average audience of 1.38 million viewers. The jumper worn by Tubridy on his debut as host of The Late Late Toy Show was later auctioned for victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake on the radio programme Mooney. The jumper raised €1,050. That year's ad featured Tubridy going into a tailor store run by two children, who offered him different sweaters. Tubridy refused each one until they offered him a jacket which he gladly accepted unaware that the kids had plugged in a neon sign at the back. ==2010s2010 edition=== { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! ccf;\\"  2010 guests - ! ececec;\\"  McFly - ! ececec;\\"  Joe McElderry - ! ececec; padding:0 4px;\\"  - } Host Ryan Tubridy caused controversy after suggesting via Twitter that he may not wear the traditional jumper. Tubridy made history when he became the first 'Late Late' host to sing on the show. He performed a song from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory in the opening piece of the show. The 2010 Toy Show attracted an average of 1.4 million viewers, the highest audience in 16 years. Speaking about the show, presenter Tubridy said \\"At the end of a very difficult week in Ireland, I think the country needed a smile, a laugh and a big hug and I think that's what we did on Friday.\\" The show also attracted 46,500 streams on RTÉ Player, up almost 120% on the figures achieved for the 2009 show. The same commercial used in the previous year's edition returned this time with Ryan accepting a sweater from the two kids (who returned for this commercial). However the kids put on 3D glasses showing a 3D effect that they could see so when Ryan asked why they are wearing them, they substituted it with the fact that they were going to a 3D movie. This edition also marked the debut of the band The Strypes who were aged between 12–14 at the time. ===2011 edition=== { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! ccf;\\"  2011 guests - ! ececec;\\"  Olly Murs - ! ececec;\\"  Jedward - ! ececec; padding:0 4px;\\"  - } Following on from the previous year's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory theme, 2011 had a Toy Story theme. It was broadcast on 2 December 2011. The jumper worn by Ryan Tubridy was donated to the fund for artist Alexandra Trotsenko on Liveline. Tubridy entered the show disguised as pull-string cowboy Woody, alongside Toy Show performer Evan O'Hanlon, who stars in Moone Boy,as Buzz Lightyear. The Late Late Toy Show was the most watched show in 17 years and of 2011, with the following Enda Kenny's Address to the nation in second place and the Eurovision Song Contest in third place. Tubridy later admitted that he had to apologise to a lady in the audience whom he had hit with a soiled nappy tossed carelessly aside during one of the toy demonstrations. Performer on the Toy Show, Ashley Tubridy, later appeared on The Late Late Show in January 2012, performing a new edition to her song \\"Friends Forever\\". ===2012 edition=== { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! ccf;\\"  2012 guests - ! ececec;\\"  Union J - } The 2012 edition, with a Shrek theme (though a TV commercial airing all week in advance falsely implied an Indiana Jones theme), took place on 30 November. It was host Ryan Tubridy's fourth Toy Show. As showtime approached there was much talk of \\"reasonably priced toys\\" and the host's choice of jumper--\\"There won't be any penguins or snowmen or figures on the jumper. I would describe this sweater as gruesome, nasty and grotesque, but only from a sartorial point of view.\\" [Tubridy \\"joke\\"] There was also a scam involving fake tickets. The children appearing included eight Irish dancers known as Damhsa Juniors and two kids from Naas performing English pop singer's Labrinth's song \\"Express Yourself\\", with a group singing \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" as the show finale. Other features to look forward to included a special appearance by The X Factor finalists Union J, Aston and Kayleigh from RTÉ documentary Apartment Kids championing toys for small spaces, a remote-controlled James Bond car and a PlayStation game written by J. K. Rowling. The highlight moment of the show happened when young Alex Meehan on a pedal powered tractor came out before spontaneously speaking Irish to Ryan Tubridy. When Tubridy responded by asking him \\"any craic\\" Alex answered \\"Níl\\" before pedalling off the stage. ===2013 edition=== { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! ccf;\\"  2013 guests - ! ececec;\\"  Robbie Keane - ! ececec; padding:0 4px;\\"  Bosco - } The 2013 edition took place on 29 November. The show was streamed on rte.ie live worldwide, anyone anywhere in the world could watch the show as it was not geo-blocked. 40,000 applications for tickets were received with only around 200 available. The show had a Mary Poppins theme, with Ryan Tubridy opening the show dressed as chimney sweep Bert and then tore off the costume to reveal his Christmas jumper. The 2013 toy show featured a record breaking 237 toys. Over 231 performers and demonstrators took to the stage, with 34 of them performing a special opening number from Mary Poppins. The opening song on the show was Chim Chim Cher-ee and featured Ryan Tubridy dancing. In advance, a week before the show, Tubridy received a letter from a young boy from County Cavan named Fergal Smith, who begged to co-host the show with him. Tubridy at first rejected the letter but that same week, he changed his mind and called him live on air and agreed to let him host. Fergal later appeared on the show wearing a similar jumper and also helped Tubridy to introduce youngters who demonstrated ride on toys. A rival version of the toy show was shown on TV3 on the same day at the earlier times of 10.00am and 8:00pm called Showpal Christmas Toys, the 30-minute programme was presented by Alan Hughes. Robbie Keane was a guest on the show when he surprised a young fan whilst he was playing a game of FIFA 14. Bosco also made an appearance on the show. Domhnall, the young Irish football fan who met Robbie Keane later appeared on The Late Late Show, a week later where he got the surprise of being a mascot for the team for their international friendly against Serbia in March 2014. The 2013 show was the most-watched programme on RTÉ in 2013 and had the highest number of viewers in 10 years. It was watched by 1,547,000 viewers.

(\\"Large wood\\" is commonly defined as pieces of wood more than in diameter and more than long) Log jams in rivers and streams often span the entirety of the water's surface from bank to bank. Log jams form when trees floating in the water become entangled with other trees floating in the water, or become snagged on rocks, large woody debris, or other objects anchored underwater. They can build up slowly over months or years, or they can happen instantaneously when large numbers of trees are swept into the water after natural disasters. A notable example caused by a natural disaster is the log jam that occurred in Spirit Lake following a landslide triggered by the eruption of Mount Saint Helens. Until they are dismantled by natural causes or humans, log jams can grow exponentially as more wood arriving from upstream becomes entangled in the mass. Log jams can persist for many decades, as is the case with the log jam in Spirit Lake. Historically in North America, large natural \\"log rafts\\" were common across the continent prior to European settlement. The most famous natural wood raft is the Great Raft on the Red River in Louisiana, which prior to its removal in the 1830s affected between of the main channel. It has been suggested that such extensive log rafts may have been common in Europe in prehistory. Log jams are not to be confused with man-made timber rafts created by loggers or the intentional release of large masses of trees into the water during a log drive to a sawmill. ==Effects on river geomorphology== Log jam in Goodell Creek, Washington Log jams alter flow hydraulics by diverting flow towards the bed or banks, increasing flow resistance and creating upstream pools, diverting flow onto the floodplain and damming the channel causing water to spill over the structure. These altered channel hydraulics change local patterns of erosion and deposition, which can create greater variety in local geomorphology and thus create provision and variety of habitat for instream living organisms. The formation of a log jam against one bank typically concentrates flow in the wood-free portion of the channel, increasing velocity through this section and promoting scour of the riverbed, the formation of channel-spanning log jams can lead to the formation of an upstream pool, water spilling over the structure generating a \\"plunge pool\\" immediately downstream. The hydraulic and geomorphological effects of log jams are highly dependent on the slope of the river (and thus the potential power of the stream); in steep channels, log jams tend to form channel-spanning steplike structures with an associated downstream scour pool, whereas, in large lowland rivers with low slopes, log jams tend to be partial structures primarily acting to deflect flow with minimal geomorphological change. ==Effects on ecology== Log jams provide important fish habitat. The pools created and sediment deposited by formation of log jams create prime spawning grounds for many species of salmon. These pools also provide refuge for fish during low water levels when other parts of a stream may be nearly dry. Log jams can provide refuge, as velocity shelters, during high-flow periods. It has been suggested that log jams are part of trees acting as ecosystem engineers to alter river habitats to promote tree growth. In dynamic braided rivers, such as the Tagliamento River in Italy where the dominant tree species is black poplar, fallen trees form log jams when they are deposited on bars, fine sediment is deposited around these log jams and sprouting seedlings are able to stabilise braid bars and promote the formation of stable islands in the river. These stable islands are then prime areas for establishment of seedlings and further vegetation growth, which in turn can eventually provide more fallen trees to the river and thus form more log jams. In large rivers in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, it has been shown there is a lifecycle of tree growth and river migration, with large trees falling into the channel as banks erode, then staying in place and acting as focal points for log jam formation. These log jams act as hard points resisting further erosion and channel migration. The areas of floodplain behind these log jams then become stable enough for more large trees to grow which in turn can potentially be log jam anchor points in the future. ==Metaphorical usage== \\"Logjam\\" or \\"log jam\\" can be used metaphorically to mean \\"deadlock\\" or \\"impasse.\\" It can either be used more literally, to mean a physical impasse, or more metaphorically, to mean an impasse in a process due to differing opinions, legal or technical issues, etc.https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/logjam Here are two example sentences: * \\"The presence of an ambulance on the side of the highway created a logjam of rubberneckers who just had to have a look\\" - more literal * \\"He was called in to try to break the logjam in the negotiations\\" - more metaphorical ==See also== *Beaver dam, a wooden dam created by beavers *Great Raft *River morphology *Stream restoration *1886 St. Croix River log jam == References == Category:Aquatic ecology Category:Geomorphology Category:Rivers ","title":"Log jam"},{"id":"20363375","text":"Fujian Blue () is a 2007 Chinese film directed by Weng Shouming (Robin Weng). The film is Weng's first and is composed of two separate but linked stories entitled \\"The Neon Knights\\" and \\"At Home at Sea.\\" The film touches on a number of controversial topics including juvenile delinquency, human trafficking, and drug use, which the film implies are the result of increasing influence of the West. Starring primarily non-professionals, Fujian Blue was produced by several independent companies in China and abroad, including Fantasy Pictures based in Beijing. The film won a Dragons and Tigers Award from the 2007 Vancouver International Film Festival, an award it shared with Zhang Yuedong's Mid-Afternoon Barks. == Plot == Fujian Blue takes place in the southeastern coastal province of Fujian (located across the straits from Taiwan). The film follows several characters in two separate but linked tales in the aftermath of the Communist government's decision to open the province up to the outside world in the 1980s. The first tale, entitled \\"The Neon Knights\\" follows the youth Amerika (Zhu Xiaoping) who lives in Fuqing. Amerika works for Roppongi (Zhuang Jiangjie), who operates a blackmailing ring that targets lonely housewives who have committed adultery while their husbands are away. Unbeknownst to Amerika, Amerika's mother (Wang Ruiyin) is also involved in crime, as an agent for the smuggler Czech (Gao Qing). Upset that his mother will not pay for his college education, Amerika makes her his next blackmailing target, but his plan goes awry and he is forced to seek refuge on Pingtan Island. The second tale, entitled \\"At Home at Sea\\" takes place on that same island and follows another youth in Roppongi's gang named Dragon (Luo Jin). Dragon, too, has fled to Pingtan after stabbing a man earlier. He had turned to crime in order to pay for the loans taken out to have his brother illegally smuggled out of the country. With nowhere to turn, Amerika gives Dragon some money, and he must decide whether to use it to emigrate himself, or to help his family. == Cast == The director Robin Weng in the Deauville Asian Film Festival 2008 * Zhu Xiaoping as Amerika, a delinquent youth living with his single mother in Fujian province. Bored and unsupervised, Amerika has become part of a gang who seek out \\"remittance widows\\" to blackmail after filming their trysts with lovers. * Wang Ruiyin as Amerika's mother, who is herself an agent of the human trafficker \\"The Czech.\\" One critic specially praised Wang's portrayal of Amerika's mother as effectively capturing a character who was both a devout Christian and also a criminal in human trafficking. * Luo Jin as Dragon, another youth in Amerika's gang. Unlike his companions, however, Dragon commits crimes in order to help support his family. He dreams of escaping China, however, to follow in the footsteps of his brother who has already illegally emigrated to Ireland. * Zhang Jianjie as Roppongi, the leader of Amerika's blackmail ring. * Gao Qing as The Czech, Amerika's mother's boss and a major figure in Fujian's human smuggling underground. == Reception == Fujian Blue remains obscure outside of the film festival circuit, due in part to what some critics saw as the films' rough aesthetics. Western critics have nevertheless been kind to the film so far. Richard Kuipers of Variety, who saw the film at the 2007 Pusan International Film Festival, argued that the film was uneven but a strong debut from first- time director Weng. The Hollywood Reporter who reviewed the film at the 2008 Deauville Asian Film Festival found Fujian Blue's non-professional cast and \\"interesting use of location\\" worthy of praise. Both critics also noted the film's social commentary, with the latter review stating that Weng accurately captures how \\"[c]rime and addiction appear to be ruining the country's social fabric.\\" However, like Variety, The Hollywood Reporter was less optimistic regarding the film's ability to reach a broader audience. ===Awards=== *2007 Vancouver International Film Festival **Dragons and Tigers Award for Young East Asian Cinema (shared with Mid-Afternoon Barks) == References  External links == * * *Fujian Blue (金碧辉煌) at China Film Journal *Fujian Blue at the Chinese Movie Database *Fujian Blue at Cinemasie Category:2007 films Category:2007 drama films Category:Chinese films Category:Films set in Fujian Category:Hokkien-language films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:2007 directorial debut films ","title":"Fujian Blue"},{"id":"20363395","text":"Tikuliya is a village development committee in Saptari District in the Sagarmatha Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

A rear-engine, front-wheel-drive layout is one in which the engine is between or behind the rear wheels, and drives the front wheels via a driveshaft, the complete reverse of a conventional front-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicle layout. The earliest example of the form appeared in 1932, with the design and construction of the prototype Maroon Car by chief designer Harleigh Holmes at Coleman Motors, an established builder of Front- and All-Wheel-Drive vehicles based in Littleton, Colorado.Harleigh Holmes and the Coleman Motor Company Littleton government history webpage The car had front-wheel drive and was powered by a rear- mounted V-8 engine. Only one was built and the vehicle was never placed in production. Since then, it has remained an extremely uncommon drive layout throughout automotive history, used only by a few prototypes and concept cars, such as the 1937 Howie machine gun carrier (nicknamed \\"belly flopper\\"), Buckminster Fuller's 1933 Dymaxion car, which was able to turn within its wheelbase thanks to rear-wheel steering, www.thirteen.org Dymaxion Transport. accessed 21 March 2010 and the 1947 Gregory Sedan. The layout has occasionally seen renewed interest as a potential option for innovative car designs, such as in the 1999 patent application of inventor–engineer Michael Basnett at the former Rover Group, which proposed a front transaxle, rear quasi-flat engine (an inline-4, turned 90 degrees) architecture, with the fuel tank placed where the right-hand cylinder bank would have been in a \\"true\\" flat engine; overall somewhat mimicking the \\"pancake engine\\" design of the Volkswagen Type 3 but in water-cooled form and without rear drive. According to the patent, the layout is designed to be advantageous in terms of crash performance by increasing the front crumple zone, in allowing greater styling freedom, in enhanced ride via reduced noise, vibration, and harshness, and in lowered center of gravity providing improved handling, braking and roll characteristics—as well as, much like the Type 3, increased cabin and cargo space within the same chassis footprint and body height. Its main disadvantage is the lack of weight over the drive wheels, particularly under hard acceleration as weight shifts to the rear. However, as mentioned in a Jalopnik article listing all known RF-layout cars, it too appears to have been nothing more than a speculative exercise, without so much as a single physical prototype being built—and the point of whether Rover Group intended to develop it any further is moot, as the corporation was broken up and its assets sold off barely a year later, with the fate of that particular piece of IP being unclear. The drivetrain design closest to RF in actual series production vehicles is the mid-engine, four- wheel-drive layout, typically seen in high end sportscar designs, and which, with the use of power-split centre differentials or hybrid drive systems, can be set up to send a variable amount of the total drive to the front wheels, in some cases up to 100%. Electric front-wheel-drive vehicles can also be found with small range-extender motor-generators, which are typically mounted in the rear luggage compartment, but do not technically count as RF drivetrain as there is no direct mechanical link between engine and wheels, or even the generated engine power and drive motor output, as the generator tends to run at a constant speed and is used to maintain battery charge rather than power the motor directly. == References == Category:Car layouts Category:Rear- engined, front-wheel-drive vehicles ","title":"Rear-engine, front-wheel-drive layout"},{"id":"20363424","text":"Trikola is a village development committee in Saptari District in the Sagarmatha Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

The principal characters are a young German doing civilian service at the former German Auschwitz concentration camp and an elderly camp survivor living there. Thalheim himself did his civilian service (Zivildienst) at the International Youth Meeting Center in Oświęcim/Auschwitz in 1996–1997, and portions of the film were shot at the Center and in the nearby town of Oświęcim, Poland. Filming was not permitted at the site of the concentration camp itself, where more than one million persons had been murdered by the end of the Second World War in 1945. The film's title in German, Am Ende kommen Touristen, is taken from a volume of poetry published by in 2000. The principal performers are Alexander Fehling as Sven Lehnert and Ryszard Ronczewski as the survivor Stanislaw Krzemiński. Barbara Wysocka plays Ania Łanuszewskaa, a young Polish woman from Oświęcim with whom Sven develops a romantic relationship. The film premièred on 16 August 2007 in Germany; its North American première was on 12 September 2007 at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2010 and 2011 the film was broadcast on German television. The Eberhard Fechner Award is a special award given annually in conjunction with the Grimme Prize for German television productions. In 2007 Bonnie J. Gordon wrote of the film that it is \\"a quiet triumph ... economically blends modern life's truths, such as the fragility of 20-something love affairs, with universal themes, such as the search for meaning and the human need to expiate guilt.\\" Jürgen Fauth wrote \\"Without ever resorting to preachiness, Thalheim, who was a Zivi at Auschwitz himself, offers incisive insights into the thorny contradictions and treacherous cross-currents of guilt and memory that turn any kind of exploration of the overbearing past into a minefield.\\" The film was nominated for the German Film Award for Best Feature Film (the \\"Lola\\"). Alexander Fehling received the (Advancement Prize for New German Cinema) for his performance as Sven. A version of the film was broadcast on German television in 2010 and 2011, for which Robert Thalheim won the . A DVD version of the film was released in Europe in 2008. 82 minutes.

To the north, it ends at the Fuxue Confucian Temple and to the south at Quancheng Street, a modern shopping area. The street has a total length of 432 meters and is on average 4.6 meters wide. As the street has a long creek with clear water, it became a gathering place for business people and several wealthy residences were constructed in the surrounding area. Together with the nearby Qushuiting Street (to the north), Furong Street formed the most prosperous area in historical Jinan. The street became a residential area and retail shops moved in when a yamen was established in the 5th year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (in the 1660s).

In 1999, when Panama gained control of the Panama Canal Zone and many Americans left, the school faced the possibility of closure. However, the school remained open and have continued to operate well. There have been four directors at CCA so far, including Pastor Bob Gunn, Dr. Frank Martens, and Jacqueline Wiese. Jacqueline Wiese served as the director of CCA beginning in the spring semester of 2006 and ending in the fall semester of 2008. After this, Pastor Bob Gunn was the director again through June 2010. Later, director Scott Bose took over. In the fall of 2015, Beth Almack took his place as director. ==Curriculum== CCA uses an American curriculum, except for the Spanish classes. Some courses, including the Honors courses in math and English, are only available depending on the availability of teachers. Honors courses are designed to prepare students for AP exams in areas such as AP Statistics, AP Calculus and AP English Literature and Composition. These courses are only taught by AP- trained instructors. Textbook changes have recently gone into effect as the school has changed from the A Beka Book curriculum in all subject areas to a variety of both Christian and secular resources. High School English uses Purposeful Design textbooks from TextWord Press, and the middle school science curriculum is also from a Christian publisher. In Middle School English, Holt, Rinehart and Winston books are used in the classroom. Elementary recently changed to the Scott Foresman language arts textbooks. All levels use the \\"History Alive\\" textbook series in their history classrooms. Math textbooks are also from Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Religious instruction is taught in weekly chapel sessions with the students and in separate Bible credits that students are required to take. Teachers are also encouraged to integrate a Christian world view into their lesson planning and teaching strategies. CCA is accredited among the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, as of May 2010. All teachers have BA or BS degrees, and 10 current teachers have more advanced degrees. Some electives offered at CCA include art, computer applications, and speech, though courses vary from year to year. ==Enrollment== In the 2010-2011 year, there were 260 students. 28% were U.S. citizens, 40% were Panamanian, and the rest were citizens of over 16 countries, including China, Russia, India, Bolivia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the EU and various other locations around the world. These numbers do not necessarily reflect those students that possess dual citizenship. As of fall 2010, 73 of these students were enrolled in grades 9-12. ==Tuition== CCA is a non-profit school, and therefore tries to keep costs low. During the 2012-2013 year, the tuition per month is $310 for Kindergarten, $380 for Elementary, $410 for Middle school, and $440 for high school. There is also a one-time entrance fee of $5000 and a yearly registration fee of $600. ==Extracurricular activities== The main sports taught at CCA are basketball and volleyball in the fall, and soccer and track in the spring. CCA is a part of the Sport Association of Private Schools in Panama (ADECOP), and the Association of American Schools in Central America (AASCA). These Associations frequently schedule sport games and tournaments throughout the year. CCA's mascot is the Eagle. Basketball and soccer are the two primary competitive team sports that have especially developed during the past couple of years at CCA; these sports contain organized middle school and high school level teams for both boys and girls leagues. Students also have the option of participating in teacher- organized dramas, which happen under the initiative of individual teachers. Elementary students in the past performed Jack and the Beanstalk, and Cinderella. Secondary students in the past have performed Hamlet (Spring 2005) and Arsenic and Old Lace (Spring 2007). Elementary students all participate in an annual Christmas musical presentation, and secondary students are invited to act in short drama skits in the Christmas presentation. Beginning in the 2008-2009 school year, an 8th grade choir was put together that performed in school chapel, the Christmas program and at another local area private school. Students are offered teachers for private music lessons, and perform annual or bi-annual recitals either during chapel sessions or at the Christmas program. These music lessons usually involve piano, voice, and guitar, although lessons in percussion are also available. Although CCA's yearbook was designated as a class elective in 2008-2009, in the past it has also been a voluntary extracurricular activity. ==References *Crossroads Christian Academy Category:Educational institutions established in 1997 Category:Schools in Panama ","title":"Crossroads Christian Academy"},{"id":"20363482","text":"Karl Kamrath (April 25, 1911 – January 29, 1988) was an American architect and tennis player.

He was born under the Ming Dynasty but died under the Manchu Qing Dynasty. ==Career== In 1647 one of his nephews was executed for anti-Qing activity. Lü took active part in the anti- Manchu military movement that followed the fall of the Ming in 1644. After the failure of the Ming loyalist movement, he became a hermit and a physician. He refused to serve the new dynasty, despite frequent requests, because he argued that upholding the difference between Hua and barbarians was more important than respecting the righteous bond between minister and sovereign.Lydia Liu (2004), 84. Lü's original sentence was \\"Hua-Yi zhi fen da yu jun-chen zhi yi\\" 華夷之分，大於君臣之義. Lü Liuliang wrote a famous anti-Qing poem. \\"The light breeze, however delicate, does not blow on me; the bright moon has never stopped casting its light on us.\\" (清風雖細難吹我，明月何嘗不照人?) In this poem, the \\"light breeze\\" (qing feng 清風) contains the character for \\"Qing\\" (as in the dynasty), and \\"bright moon\\" (ming yue 明月) the character for \\"Ming\\". He also wrote many eight-legged essays. Lü is also one of the most prominent cases in Chinese history of literary inquisition. After Lü's death, an official named Zeng Jing was inspired by his anti-Qing writing to attempt to overthrow the Yongzheng Emperor. As a result, in 1733, Lü's corpse and that of one of his sons were exhumed and mutilated, another son was executed, his grandsons were exiled and female relatives enslaved, and all of his writings were banned. Two of his followers were treated similarly. He is a character in Jin Yong's wuxia novel The Deer and the Cauldron. ==NotesReferences== *Liu, Lydia (2004).

With 13-14 HCP, the opener may not have a 4-card major. With 15-17 HCP, all balanced hands (including those with a 5-card major) may be opened 1NT. While originally developed for the Carrot Club system, this opening bid can be adopted by systems using 15-17 or 14-16 HCP ranges for their 1NT openings. It combines the preemptive advantage of a weak 1NT opening when opener lacks sufficient holdings in the majors, with the constructive effect of a strong 1NT opening. To manage the wide 5-point HCP range, the response structure has been designed to distinguish between weak invitational bids (7-9 hcp, inviting the 15-17 hand only) and strong invitational bids (10-11 hcp, inviting the 13-14 hand and game-forcing to 15-17). == Responses to 1NT == * 2/2 are natural weak (7-9) invitations with a 5-card major. * 2NT is a strong (10-11) invitation, which may also contain 4-card major(s) (opener will only pass with 13-14, in which case he cannot have a 4-card major). * 2 is Stayman on most other hands (7-9 weak invitational, or game-forcing strength) but is also used with a 5-card major and strong invitation, 10-11. * 2 is a relay to 2 with sign-off hands or certain game-forcing hands. * 3/ are natural invitation to 3NT with a long suit, 6-9.

Introduced with the formation of the state of Thuringia within the Weimar Republic in 1920, it is the reverse of the flag of Hesse, both flags ultimately reflecting the heraldic colours of the Ludovingian rulers of the medieval Duchy of Thuringia. The flag's similarity to that of Poland is coincidental. Like many German state's flags, the most commonly used size commercially is 3:5, although in law it is stated as being 'at least 1:2'. 1933 flag design The civil bicolour flag of white over red was used in the Weimar Republic, and formally abolished in 1935, under the reforms of the Third Reich. It was re-adopted 1946 when Thuringia became a state again, and again abolished 1952 under governing reforms of the German Democratic Republic. When Germany was reunited, Thuringia became a state yet again, and so the flag was finally re-adopted in 1991, having been a much used symbol during the demonstrations in the German Democratic Republic in 1989/90. It was immediately accepted as Landesflagge after the reunification and the re-establishment of Thuringia as a state on 3 October 1990. The first legal regulation was the Gesetz über die Hoheitszeichen of 30 January 1991. The new arms of Thuringia are the old arms of the Ludovingian Landgraves of Thuringia, with a couple of alterations. Because of the similarities between Hesse and Thuringia Coats of Arms, the flags appear similar too.

Prior to the fight, Groves signed with German promoters Sauerland, on what has been described as \\"a long-term deal\\". The fight was a more cagey affair than the first match, with both fighters initially looking to outbox each other. Froch was stronger in the earlier rounds, with Jim Watt unofficially scoring the earlier rounds in favour of the champion on his Sky Sports scorecard. By the end of the seventh round, both Richie Woodhall and Steve Bunce had the fight scored 4 rounds to 3 for Froch on the BBC scorecards.

Groves vs. Jack On 17 June 2015 it was announced that Badou Jack would make his first defence against mandatory challenger Groves on 22 August in Las Vegas. A venue had not been confirmed. This fight was Groves' third world title challenge, having lost back to back challenges against then world champion Carl Froch in 2013 and 2014 respectively. On 21 July, the fight was pushed back to instead take place on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Andre Berto on 12 September at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. There was no injuries as Showtime gave no reason as to why the fight was postponed. Jack was once again the underdog. It was Groves' third fight in the US, as well as his third chance at a world title. Going into the fight, old foe James DeGale had voiced his support for Groves, as he himself had become IBF champion four months prior, and was looking forward to a potential rematch with world titles at stake. In the opening round, Jack scored a knockdown against Groves, but the latter was able to recover and rally back in what would become a competitive fight. At the end, the scorecards were split with 115–112 and 116–111 for Jack, and 114–113 for Groves.

He hired Shane McGuigan as his new trainer. On 30 January 2016 Groves fought at the Copper Box in London against fringe Italian contender Andrea Di Luisa (18-3, 14 KOs). Di Luisa was down and given a count in the 4th round and down again twice in the 5th round before the towel is thrown in from his corner resulting in a TKO victory for Groves. Groves returned to the O2 Arena for the first time since 2013, on the undercard of Martin-Joshua IBF title match on 9 April. Groves knocked out undefeated David Brophy in round 4. Groves won the vacant WBA international super-middleweight title. With this win, Groves hoped to land a fight with either Martin Murray or Callum Smith next.

Both fighters were delighted that the fight was made. Murray made weight on second attempt. After a long battle, Groves defeated Murray via a 12-round unanimous decision. The three judges scored the fight at 118-110, giving Murray only two rounds. Groves hurt Murray with big right hands in rounds 7, 9 and 12. Murray had Groves looking hurt in the 10th after hitting him with a left hook to the head. Both fighters looked tired and ragged in the 12th round. Their conditioning looked less than to be desired at that point in the fight. On 18 November 2016, Groves was set to defend his International title for a second time, this time against German boxer Eduard Gutknecht (30-4-1, 13 KOs). Gutknecht had previously challenged once for the world super middleweight title and once the world light heavyweight title. The fight took place at the Wembley Arena in London. In a one-sided fight, Groves defeated Gutknecht by 12 round unanimous decision title. The judges scored it (119-110, 119-109 and 119-109) all in favour of Groves. Groves showed good boxing skills in surviving an early attack from Gutknecht in the first three rounds. Groves had to take some hard power shots and jabs. In round 9, Gutknecht took a lot of heavy blows from Groves. At the end of the round, Gutknecht’s right eye was badly swollen and almost completely shut. Gutknecht was able to catch Groves with some hard jabs that got his attention in the 9th. Gutknecht was no longer throwing power shots, which at this point was what he needed to win the rounds. Gutknecht collapsed in the dressing room following the bout and was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery for swelling to the brain. The fight, which took place on Channel 5 on Friday night, averaged 780,000 viewers. ===WBA (Super) super-middleweight champion=== Groves vs. Chudinov On 7 December 2016, Groves confirmed via his Twitter account that he will challenge Fedor Chudinov for the vacant WBA super middleweight title. This would be his 4th attempt at a world title. Although the venue wasn't confirmed via his Twitter, Groves stated he would like to fight in London. Sauerland Events confirmed they had until 5 January 2017 to agree on a deal. On 8 April, Kalle Sauerland tweeted that an agreement was signed for the fight to take place in the UK. On 20 April, it was announced that the fight would take place at Bramall Lane in Sheffield on 27 May as part of the undercard of Brook-Spence PPV. A day later, the WBA announced an immediate rematch between their 'Regular' title holder Tyron Zeage and Isaac Epko after their initial fight ended in a technical decision win for Zeage in the early rounds. The winner of both fights would then need to meet in order to decide one titleholder, as part of WBA's plans to reduce the number of world titles per division. In his fourth attempt, Groves finally became world champion when he stopped Chudinov in round six. A barrage of punches gave referee Steve Gray no choice but to halt the fight giving Groves the win. The fight was non stop action from the opening bell. After an evenly matched first two rounds, Groves took control. Groves was cut above the eye in round four after an accidental clash of heads. The official time of stoppage was 1 minute and 14 seconds. Groves spoke to Sky Sports after the fight and credited his trainer Shane McGuigan, \\"This is the end of a lifetime's work. Shane McGuigan has resurrected my career. Now I'm mature enough to admit that. I feel like I'm the best in the division. I'm willing and ready to fight anyone.\\" On 1 June, Groves had surgery after it was revealed that he broke his jaw in round 3 in the win against Chudinov. Groves said, That or [I] broke it from over-smiling since.\\" ===World Boxing Super Series=== On 16 June 2017, Groves announced that he would be the first super-middleweight to join the World Boxing Super Series tournament. The 8-man bracket-style elimination tournament, which would see the winner earn a grand cash prize as well as the 'greatest prize in boxing', the Muhammad Ali Trophy. The reason for joining was to prove that he is the best super-middleweight in the world. A draft gala was scheduled to take place on 8 July in Monaco to determine who Groves would fight in the quarter finals. Groves hinted that he could possibly retire from boxing if he was to win the tournament. Groves said, “If I win this tournament I could walk away from boxing satisfied as a unified world champion.” He also said that if the next WBSS tournament took place at light heavyweight, he would be willing to move up and participate. Groves vs. Cox At the Draft Gala on 8 July, Groves, who was first-seeded, meaning he had the option to select his opponent, choose to fight undefeated British boxer Jamie Cox (23-0, 13 KOs). Groves explained, picking Cox was a '\\"strategic\\" move and due to the tournament being long, it would be best to \\"pick the easy guy first\\". AG Comosa announced the fight would take place on 14 October 2017 at The SSE Arena in Wembley, London. Groves' WBA title would also be at stake as well the winner advancing to the semi finals against the winner of Chris Eubank Jr. and Avni Yildrim. Groves took back his earlier words of saying Cox was the easiest, \\"I know there are no easy fights in this tournament and there are no easy fights at world level, but Jamie is the guy I know the most about.\\" Groves retained his title and advanced to the semi finals of the tournament in a competitive bout which came to an end in round 4. A perfectly placed right hand to the body send Cox down in pain. Referee Steve Gray counted him out at 1 minute, 42 seconds into the round. The fight started with both boxers feeling each other out and trading sporadically. Cox boxed well for the first two rounds however seemed a little reckless in doing so. Groves boxed sensibly, waiting for counter shots. Chris Eubank Jr., who was sat ringside, entered the ring, giving his thoughts on the fight, \\"It was a good fight, he did what he had to win, not too many cuts and bruises so it looks like we're on for January. That's what we wanted.\\" Groves spoke about his fallen opponent, \\"I picked him because I believe he was the most dangerous of the unseeded fighters. I didn't want an easy fight.\\" Groves landed 48 of 163 punches thrown (29%), 42 of them being power shots. Cox landed 36 of 131 thrown (28%). Groves vs. Eubank Jr. Due to winning their respective bouts in October 2017, Groves and Chris Eubank Jr. (26-1, 20 KOs) were due to meet in the semi final of the tournament. At first, promoter Kalle Sauerland stated he would try to book the fight for a stadium in either London or Manchester. In November 2017, ITV reported the fight was set to take place on 17 February 2018 at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, Europe’s largest purpose-built indoor arena. The winner of the fight would earn his place in the final of the tournament as well as walk out with the WBA (Super) and IBO super-middleweight titles. Tickets for the fight sold out in seven minutes. Groves weighed 167 pounds, a full pound under the weight limit and Eubank came in at 167.5 pounds. Groves secured his place in the final of the tournament after defeating Eubank over 12 rounds. The judges scored the fight 117-112, 116-112 and 115-113 for Groves. Groves, the bigger man in the ring, used his jab to control the fight after a cagey round and mostly fought on the back foot, occasionally landing the big shot. An accidental clash of heads caused Eubank to receive a cut on the side of his right eye in round 3. The big cut was dealt with by his corner after the round, but as the fight went on to the later rounds, blood was seen flowing expeditiously. Many thought Eubanks cutman was inadequate in his attempt to stop the cut, Eubank later said he struggled to see out the eye. The fight was riddled with a lot of clinches and unclean punches from both boxers. Groves retained his WBA title but did not claim Eubank's IBO title as he did not pay their sanctioning fees. Groves also suffered a dislocated shoulder in round 12. It was said that Groves weighed around 184 pounds on fight night. After the fight, Groves said, “It was about who wanted it most, I think, and I obviously wanted it most. The jab was landing correctly all night. When he had success, it was because I did something wrong. He was strong, he was aggressive, but that obviously wasn’t enough tonight.” Eubank replied, “I thought it was close. I thought I did enough in the later rounds to win the fight, but it was a close fight. And all credit to George. You know, this is all part of boxing. You win some and you lose some. Hopefully we can get a rematch. It was enough of a good fight to have another one.” Punch stats showed that Groves landed 117 of 398 punches thrown (29%) and Eubank landed 92 of his 421 thrown (22%). Many pundits and former boxers stated Eubank should move forward and hire a trainer. Both boxers earned a base purse of £1.5 million, which could increase due to sponsorship and PPV sales. Four days after the fight it was revealed Groves didn't fight for the IBO belt after failing to agree on sanctioning fees with the IBO's president Ed Levine. Groves vs. Callum Smith On 13 February, it was announced that the final of the super-middleweight tournament would take place at the O2 Arena in London on 2 June 2018. The final was made up after Groves defeated Eubank Jr. on 17 February and Callum Smith (24-0, 17 KOs) defeating Nieky Holzken on 24 February. On 26 February, Groves tweeted that he would be going into surgery. He wrote, \\"We will be applying to the @WBSuperSeries for a one-month extension and are hopeful of securing this.\\" He hoped to return to the ring by July. On 9 May, Kalle Sauerland said that Groves could potentially be replaced by Chris Eubank Jr. in the final of the tournament against Smith, however there would be confirmation on the final in the next 10 days. Sauerland stated, \\"We're working at the moment on all the solutions and scenarios, where George [Groves] is fit and where he isn't. We're hopeful [Groves will be fit], so we'll see. You can't start the tournament and then have the final lingering into the next tournament. I'm sorry, that's not going to happen. We can push a month, but we can’t push it back by three or four months. We have a substitute system. We said that from day one, and that’s the situation. We want Groves in the final, but if that’s not possible and he doesn't declare himself fit in the next 10 days, we have to find a solution.\\" On 28 May, it was said that Groves would be declared fit with the fight to take place on 14 July. By 6 July, there was still no date set, however according to Kalle Sauerland, the bout was expected to take place in September and likely not in the UK, with some rumours hinting there was a strong interest from Las Vegas and Middle East. Smith's trainer Joe Gallagher confirmed contracts had been signed. On 27 July, Sauerland announced the fight would take place at a 10,000 capacity arena at the King Abdullah Sports City Complex in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on 28 September 2018. It was reported the prize money on offer for the final was £6.1 million, with the winner taking a larger percentage. After a tight match with the fighters level on the judges' scorecards, Smith defeated Groves by round 7 knockout. The size difference was noticeable as the fight was fought closely throughout the opening 6 rounds with back and forth action. Early in the fight, Groves established his jab whilst trying to avoid any power shots from Smith, whilst Smith was connecting with his right hand. Smith had more success in round 3 after a counter-right hand buckled Groves legs. In round 6, Smith backed Groves against the ropes and landed two strong jabs. He later landed a clean left hook which forced Groves to move back. Midway through round 7, Groves landed two body shots, however leaving himself open, Smith landed a left hook, which again shook Groves and forced him to retreat backwards. Groves was hurt at this point and Smith went after Groves against the ropes and landed numerous shots, including a hard body shot and an uppercut, ultimately sending Groves to the canvas. Groves managed to get to one knee, before referee Luis Pabon finished the 10-count, giving Smith the win. Groves made no excuses, claiming the shoulder was never an issue in the fight. He also ruled out retirement. Muhammad Ali's daughter presented Smith with the trophy. Smith claimed the WBA super- middleweight title along with the vacant Ring Magazine title. Smith became the third super-middleweight after Joe Calzaghe and Andre Ward to win the Ring belt. There were four official judge's scorecards. One judge had it even after 6 rounds at 57–57, two judges had Groves ahead 59–55 and 58–56 and one judge had Smith ahead 59–55. ===Retirement=== On 28 January 2019, at the age of 30, Groves announced his retirement from professional boxing, stating, \\"I don't want there to be a time where I'm 'too old' to box, or where injury retires me.\\" In a long statement, he highlighted some career events and offered a prayer for Eduard Gutknecht.

Roughley) standing in the cockpit of a French Bloch MB.200 at Rayak in 1941 Rayak Air Base (  Kaidat Rayak al-jawiya) is Lebanon's first air base and the place where the Lebanese Air Force was born on June 1, 1949. In the 1950s the RAF sent its own instructors to help the Lebanese Airforce. British families accompanied instructors. The base had connections with Airforce bases on Cyprus. It was an idyllic location situated very close to a vineyard which now supplies wines throughout Europe, including London. Located in the middle of the Bekaa Valley to the east, between the towns of Zahlé and Anjar, it symbolizes the Lebanese Air Force best, and is home for most of the aircraft types that have seen service and the final resting place for almost all retiring planes. The airfield has been in use since 1914 by various foreign forces such as German, Ottoman, British and French. ==History== Rayak Air Base was constructed and used by the Germans in World War I. After liberation by the allies Armee d'l'air personnel trained Lebanese Air Force technicians in aircraft maintenance. On 1 August 1945, Lebanon took command of its armed forces, including Rayak air base. During the French Mandate of Lebanon, Rayak Air base was considered to be the \\"jewel\\" of the Air bases and the centre of attraction of all other military units, not only in Lebanon but also in mandated Syria and all the Near East. The base had many entertainment facilities, luxuries, flowering gardens, and central heating, which at that time were not found in military sites elsewhere in the region. The French Air Force evacuated the base in 1949, and it was abandoned for a long time, which contributed to turning it into a miserable condition, especially after being looted by its own guards. The army command later decided to rebuild the air base, a reconstruction that took two months and which included the construction of new buildings and infrastructure. The first officers assigned to the base were: * Deputy Commander Lt. Ahmad Arab * Administrative officer Antranik Tatoussian * Service battalion officer Victor Charles Recruitment started with one hundred personnel, many of whom already had experience with the French. The first course students included: * Lt. Ali Abboud * Sergeant John Ayoub * Sergeant Izat Hariri * Civil pilot Hassan Badawi * Civil pilot René Abdallah * Civil pilot Michel Charles * Civil pilot Michel Nawfal or Michel Naufal * Civil pilot Emil Succar ==Facilities== An administration building, several hangars (most of these built during the French Mandate of Lebanon), a control tower, officers club, houses, parachutes tower, barracks, and workshops make up the airport. In addition, both runways are equipped with a low intensity runway lights (LIRL) lighting system. ==Aviation School & Technical School== The airbase is the home to the Lebanese Air Force Aviation School which trains air force pilots. The school currently employs Robinson Raven R44 II helicopters and Bulldog T1 propeller for these training purposes. The Lebanese Air Force Technical School is also located at Rayak Air Base. Its goal is to qualify technicians for the whole air force. The base is home to the only flight simulator in the Lebanese military. A new facility housing a UH-1 Helicopter simulator from the US military is now being used to train future Lebanese pilots. ==Lebanon Air Force Museum== Rayak Air Base is also home to the Lebanese Air Force Museum, as it contains all of the old aircraft and the majority of grounded aircraft. The museum is not open to the public, however, and visitors must obtain permission to visit from air force authorities. The museum displays: * de Havilland Vampire T55 * Hawker Hunter F6 * Sud Aviation SE3130 Alouette II * Sud Aviation SA316B Alouette III * Agusta Bell AB212 * Fouga CM170 Magister * Aerospatiale SA342L Gazelle The museum comprises one hangar and is intended to become a public museum in the future. ==Hawker Hunters== Lebanon's Hawker Hunter jets, much like the rest of its grounded fixed-wing jets, are stored at Rayak. In 2007 the LAF began the process of restoring the Hunters to airworthy condition. Initially these were to be used against the Fatah al-Islam terrorist group which the army was battling during the Nahr el-Bared Operation, but this operation ended before the air force was able to complete their restoration. During November 2008, the air force made three Hunters operational, and displayed them during Lebanon's 65th independence anniversary on November 22, 2008. The base has always been considered to be the home of those aircraft; however, during the eighties the Hunters had to move to Hallat strip due to the close proximity of the air base to Syria. The Hunters later returned to the base, yet were grounded during 1994. All fights during 2008, after restoration, were carried from this base. ==Attacks== Like the rest of Lebanon's airports, the runways at Rayak were bombed by the Israeli Air Force on July 13, 2006, during the 2006 Lebanon War. A bomb on each runway was sufficient to punch deep holes and render the airport disabled. ==Notable visits== * On September 1, 1942, General de Gaulle * On September 26, 1949, Marquise de Freij and his wife. * On October 17, 1949, the British General Hayes, the supreme commander of the British troops in the Middle East, visited Rayak Air base and had lunch with its officers and the British squad there. * On November 28, 1954, the US air force commander in West Tripoli General Glandburg ==See also== * Beirut Air Base * Rene Mouawad Air Base ==References * Global Security - Lebanese Air Force Category:Airports in Lebanon Category:Lebanese Air Force bases ","title":"Rayak Air Base"},{"id":"20363772","text":"Omar Fernando Tobio (born October 18, 1989) is an Argentine football central defender currently playing for Toluca. ==Club career== Tobio made his debut for Vélez Sársfield on March 1, 2008.

Mrázek covertly influenced Czech politics for almost twenty years.Kmotr Mrázek II. (Krakatice), p. i (photographic supplement) In 2006 he was assassinated by a (still unknown) sniper. Most of the publicly available information about his criminal activities and contacts with the politicians leaked from police archives (which include wiretapping records and Mrázek's own collection of blackmail material) after his death. These sources suspect he was involved in over 30 murders.Jaroslav Spurný: Kmotrovo poslední sbohem, Respekt, 2009, No. 24, p. 12-13, 16-21. Among those suspected to be murdered are state attorney (investigation closed as an accident), police detective (suicide), local journalist and several Mrázek's associates. As of June 2009 no murder was resolved and police investigations were suspended. == Communist Czechoslovakia == Mrázek set up a smuggling business during the communist era. He \\"dealt\\" in a variety of articles including wristwatches, Walkmans and textiles of Western origin, and even with gravestones from Czech Jewish cemeteries.Kmotr Mrázek, p. 38-40 He was also involved in the criminal underground of the Kolín region as his name appeared in the circles of foreign currency speculators (). In 1986 Mrázek spent two months in custody and was subsequently sentenced to probation.Kmotr Mrázek, p. 30 In February 1987, Mrázek consented to cooperating with the criminal investigation department of Czechoslovak police.Kmotr Mrázek, p. iii (photographic supplement) However, he himself was under surveillance by the Omega police team .Kmotr Mrázek, p. 61 == Post- revolution == Following the Velvet Revolution of 1989 Mrázek at first focused on voucher privatization. Together with his business partners, he took the opportunity offered by the chaotic situation at the beginning of Czech economic transformation, and laundered the dirty money from the past.Kmotr Mrázek, p. 79 He later focused his business activities on real estate. Obtaining loans from Czech banks, often through a third party, Mrázek specialized in the buying and reselling of realities. He dealt with buildings that were fraudulently overvalued, earning hundreds of millions in Czech currency. He established many similar companiesKmotr Mrázek, p. xxvi-xxvii (photographic supplement) The basic overview owned by so-called \\"white horses\\" (bogus owners, usually with Russian names). He later transferred his assets to other firms in order to cover these fraudulent activities. The Czech police investigated his suspicions activities, however, their case was closed as inconclusiveKmotr Mrázek - The first volume of the book deals with Mrázek´s activities in 80´s and 90´s as Mrázek was not legally involved in any of the firms. From 1991 to 1994 František Mrázek managed to wring an astronomical amount of money from Czech banks - more than 1.14 billion Czech crowns.Kmotr Mrázek, p. 89 At the beginning of the 1990s, Mrázek, together with renowned Czech singer Karel Gott, established the foundation Interpo, dedicated to helping children of police officers killed in the line of duty. Gott however withdrew from the collaboration when the foundation became suspected of dishonest financial transactions. Gott later stated that he \\"hadn't noticed Mrázek's connections with organized crime\\".Kmotr Mrázek II. (Krakatice), p. xxi (photographic supplement) Mrázek socialized with many controversial entrepreneurs such as Tomáš Pitr and Miroslav Provod, both later convicted for tax fraud. In 2000 the Czech public television broadcaster Česká televize aired a report on Mrázek and Provod containing information about their connections to the bankruptcy of the big Czech bank, IPB, as well as several small banks. In January 2000 Mrázek joined developer Luděk Sekyra in an attempt to acquire major Czech construction company IPS.Jana Klímová, Krystyna Wanatowiczová, Podnikatel Sekyra: Role Mrázka v privatizaci IPS byla okrajová, iDNES, 9 October 2008 (interview with Luděk Sekyra) == Influence on Czech politics == Mrázek, together with another entrepreneur Tomáš Pitr, was considered the head of the financial group which controlled large chemical conglomerate SETUZA and the oil company Český olej (Czech oil). This group attempted (not only in connection with SETUZA) to influence the discharge of the Czech government for its own benefit. p. 4-5 He was also involved in the case of \\"the resolution of the Russian debt\\", later called \\"the Czech fiddle of the century\\". He helped to arrange meetings between Czech and Russian politicians in that case. Russia owed the Czech Republic approximately 170 billion Czech crowns. Former Czech Minister of Finance Ivo Svoboda negotiated the sale of the debt with Austrian entrepreneur Barak Alon and also with Mrázek. The Czech government later signed an opaque contract with the corporation Falkon owned by Georgian entrepreneurs. Later, this corporation was also influenced by people connected with the former communist regime and former secret police department. The Russian government rendered about 50 billion Czech crowns, however, after opaque financial and bank operations only 20 billion came to Prague. Mrázek's connections with Czech politics are documented on police wiretaps. He was under surveillance by the Czech anti- corruption police team many times; the largest police operation oriented to his person was called Krakatice (Giant Squid), established in 1999 to investigate relations between Czech politicians and groups of organized crime. The case was closed in 2002 and information contained in it didn't help prove any allegations. However, shortly before Czech Parliament elections in 2006 some information from a file concerning contacts between Mrázek's close collaborator Igor Šafranko and politician Vlastimil Tlustý (former Czech Minister of Finance) spread to the public. Tlustý later stated that he wasn't involved in either corruption or organized crime, and he broke his contacts with negotiator Šafranko. František Mrázek was in long-term contact with Miroslav Šlouf, the chief-consultant of former Czech Prime Minister Miloš Zeman. He also attempted to influence other Members of Czech Parliament including Ivan Langer, Minister of the Interior and Informatics of the Czech Republic. Langer later stated that he wasn't working in connection with Mrázek, and he rejected all speculation as \\"nonsense\\". Mrázek was never accused or sentenced after 1989. The building (center) in front of which František Mrázek was assassinated. == Assassination == An attempt to murder Mrázek occurred in 2002. He was wounded, but survived (and since then used an armoured car). Later, on the Czech television report \\"Na stopě\\", Mrázek offered a two-million Czech crown reward for information leading to the attacker. On 25 January 2006, František Mrázek was shot and killed by an unknown assailant in Durychova Street, Prague 4, in front of the seat of his firms and companies. Only one shot was used and Mrázek died almost immediately. The investigation into his death was postponed until December 2006 and remains unsolved. According to the police investigation, he was shot with a sniper rifle by a professional assassin; the assassination was carefully and professionally planned. == Post-death == Jaroslav Kmenta, the chief-reporter of the Czech daily newspaper Mladá Fronta Dnes, published information on František Mrázek in three books. The reliability of his investigation was however questioned and on 21 November 2008 Kmenta stated: \\"...in agreement with the editor-in-chief, I published only absolutely verified information, derived from various sources\\". The 2008 book Kmotr Kmenta (The Godfather Kmenta) by Přemysl Svora was published in response to the controversy. The case of František Mrázek (Krakatice) wasn't investigated properly, even though three police chiefs and ministers were replaced in their posts. It is entirely possible that police and investigators worked under immense pressure and were forced to stop the investigation. According to Mladá Fronta Dnes the problem is that the file contains many names of prominent politicians of both leading parties in the Czech Republic: Civic Democratic Party and Czech Social Democratic Party. Former Czech premier Mirek Topolánek stated on 15 September 2008 in the Czech newspaper Hospodářské noviny: \\"The police and secret services - at least a part of them - may have wanted to resolve this case, but they were silenced or intimidated.\\" In February 2009 Karel Tichý, former elite detective of the Czech anti-corruption police, claimed that he wanted to speak publicly about the circumstances of alleged interconnection between organized crime and Czech politicians. However, Ivan Langer, Czech Minister of the Interior and Informatics, manifested that he would refuse his request. Tichý himself has been interrogated many times by the secret police since 1995. The case was definitively closed on 27 May 2009. Mrázek's murderer wasn't found. Mrázek's son Michal, who inherited father's wealth, publicly warned Czech politicians he has access to a hidden archive of compromising material collected by his father.October 2008 interview with Michal Mrázek: . ===Law against publishing wiretapping records=== In February 2009 the Czech parliament amended criminal law with an explicit ban on publishing any account of police wiretapping, under penalty of a heavy fine and years of imprisonment. The law was criticised by the Czech media as an attempt by politicians to avoid future embarrassment akin to the Mrázek case.Informational website set up by the Czech media against the new law, in Czech and English. Retrieved on July 2009. == In popular culture == The Story of a Godfather (Czech: Příběh kmotra), a Czech film directed by Petr Nikolaev, is inspired by the story of František Mrázek. The movie premiered on 24 October 2013. Character Vratislav Milota inspired by Mrázek appeared in a film Gangster Ka. == Notes  References == * * * The trilogy tells the story of Mrázek and is mostly based on leaked police sources. * Unlike Kmenta's books this publication contains only uncommented police records about Mrázek. == External links == *Záhadný muž, který točí miliardami Mf Dnes, February 2003 *Jan Hrbáček: Únik informací z BIS a podnikatel František Mrázek reportage of Czech Radio *Divocí podnikatelé aneb Mrázek po smrti a jeho podnikatelské aktivity a vazby Category:1958 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Czech mob bosses Category:Assassinated Czech people Category:People murdered in the Czech Republic Category:2000s murders in the Czech Republic Category:2006 crimes in the Czech Republic Category:2006 murders in Europe ","title":"František Mrázek"},{"id":"20363894","text":"Charles Wade Bell (born January 3, 1945) is a former middle distance runner from the United States, who competed at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.

He finished fourth in the 800 m,. He is best known for winning the gold medal in the men's 800 metres event during the 1955 Pan American Games in Mexico City. Sowell also set the world indoor record for the 880-yard run in 1957 at 1:50.3 s and tied the world record for the 1,000 yards of 2:08.2 s in 1955.Arnie Sowell runs so soft, Sports Illustrated, May 30, 1955. Retrieved 28 April 2016. He was recognised as a very versatile and talented runner who could run a variety of distances, and even hurdle and long jump., One track coach, Manhattan's George Eastment, described him as the \\"greatest runner I ever saw\\"., another, Carl Olson, felt he could break the four-minute mile. During his career he had a particular rivalry with his fellow countryman and middle- distance runner, Tom Courtney, the two swapping victories and being involved in many memorable duels. One duel was the 1956 Olympic trials where Courtney held off Sowell to finish 1st and 2nd with Courtney in the process breaking Sowell's USA record (of 1:46.7) that he had achieved at that year's NCAA meet. In the Olympic final itself Sowell led from the back straight of the first lap right up to the final turn of the final lap where he was passed by Courtney. As they entered the final straight, Coutney now ahead had his own battle with Derek Johnson who had also passed Sowell, but Sowell now had to contend with the challenge of Audun Boysen. Courtney was to win his battle with Johnson and finish first, but Sowell lost his and finished fourth. Sowell was an excellent runner indoors as well as outdoors, winning 4 NCAA titles and establishing a world record 1:50.3 for 880 yards. In 1956, Sowell was a member of teams that set world records in the 4 x 440y and 4 x 880y relays. The son of a Pittsburgh city-council maintenance man, and a 1953 graduate of Schenley High School, Arnie Sowell attended the University of Pittsburgh where he was a successful member of the Pitt Panthers track and field team. Whilst at Pitt, Sowell ran successfully for his college, winning the 1954 and 1956 880 yards NCAA titles. In 2007, Sowell was one of the guests of honour at a celebration of fellow Olympian and Pitt alumnus Herb Douglas on his 85th birthday at a celebration at the Senator John Heinz History Center, Pittsburgh. After leaving college in 1957 with a business degree, Sowell embarked on a career in the military, finally retiring with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1980. Also after graduation, Sowell married a fellow Pitt graduate of that year, Barbara Peace, who had studied arts and sciences. Sowells admittance in 1957 to the Fort Benning U.S. Army Training School as a second lieutenant was viewed as newsworthy at the time. Sowell continued his running career into 1959 as a representative of the US Army, where he competed on the pentathlon team.School chum joins Sowell in Pentathlon, Armored Sentinel (Temple, Tex.), Vol. 17, No. 15, Ed. 1, June 19, 1959.

A dendrochronology report gives construction dates of 1513–35 for the north aisle, 1485–1514 for the nave, and 1487–1523 for the porch.Church of St Mabena, St Mabyn, Cornwall: English Heritage research report 074-2008 A song to the patron saint was sung at the dedication. Built in the Perpendicular style, with possible Norman origins, it consists of a chancel, nave and north and south aisles. Several monuments were removed by Rev. Granville Leveson- Gower in 1818 and some restoration occurred in 1884; it was re-seated and repaved in 1889. The building is of ashlar slate stone on a moulded plinth and wall plate, rag slate roofs with gable ends. The arcades each have seven four- centred arches of granite, supported by monolith granite pillars with sculpted capitals of St Stephens porcelain stone. The tower of three stages is 85 feet in height, with a battlemented parapet and crocketted finials, the top stage is decorated with four carved figures, possibly the Four Evangelists. There is a piscina (used to cleanse sacred vessels after mass at the high altar) on the north side and the remains of rood loft stairs, now built up. In the south aisle is a second piscina and a priest's doorway. The font is one of Norman table-top type: it has a circular basin, hollowed in a square block decorated with blind arcade set on a round ornamented shaft. The earliest recorded Priest in charge was Roger de Worlegan in 1267. Charles Peters, rector 1726-75, was recognized as the finest Hebrew scholar in Europe; his Dissertation on the Book of Job was published in 1751.Brown, H. Miles (1964) The Church in Cornwall. Truro: Blackford; p. 66 The register dates from the year 1562. A credence table which survives in the church may originally have been the panel of a tomb raised in Mabena's honour.Mattingly, \\"Pre-Reformation saints' cults in Cornwall\\", p. 259-60 It is possible that all her sisters had tombs erected for them. One of the stained glass windows is a memorial to Francis John Hext, of Tredethy, who died in January, 1803, and Margaret (Lang), his wife who died in March, 1794. There were five bells in 1787 and later six, bell casting took place in a nearby garden called \\"bell garden\\". A church clock was installed in 1950. The belfry has a ring of eight bellsDove, R. H.

In 2008 extensive refurbishment of the roof was undertaken, including replacement of lead valleys, renewal of granite copings, replacement of cast iron gutters and ceiling repairs, the work cost £115,000 and was partly funded by English Heritage. In March 2014 thieves broke into the church and stole a 19th-century painting of Christ's preparation for entombment (a copy of a work by Italian artist Jacopo Bassano) and also a policeman's truncheon dated 1807.

It achieves a variation in lightness and darkness (value) of a single color or multiple colors by hand applying a gradation of ink to a moistened wooden printing block, rather than inking the block uniformly. This hand-application had to be repeated for each sheet of paper that was printed. The best-known examples of bokashi are in the 19th-century ukiyo-e works of Hokusai and Hiroshige, in which the fading of Prussian blue dyes in skies and water create an illusion of depth. In later work by Hiroshige, for example the series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo, most prints originally featured bokashi such as red-to- yellow-to-blue color sunrises. ==Techniques== Gradations can be created on the blocks themselves using the ' technique, or brushed on by hand using '. They can also be done freehand directly onto a print, without using a printing block. ===Fukibokashi=== ' requires gradations of ink to be applied to the printing block. This is not a precise technique; its results are inconsistent from print to print. The technique ' (, \\"straight-line bokashi\\") is the one associated with the works of Hokusai and Hiroshige. Ink is applied only to one end of the brush's bristles, and the brush is drawn across the desired portion of the printing block; this area is first wetted with a ' cloth, so that the ink bleeds somewhat across the wet area. This creates a gradation at the width of the brush. The darkened peak of Mount Fuji is an example of '. Fine Wind, Clear Morning, Hokusai, In ' () two colours are worked toward each other, achieved by applying two inks to opposite edges of the brush. In ' a flat colour is printed, and then the same printing block is washed and re- brushed with a ' effect to overprint over the first; this technique is seen on the dark peak of Mount Fuji in Hokusai's Fine Wind, Clear Morning. ===Itabokashi=== Itabokashi, or 'block shading,' is a technique used to produce ruffled edges on areas of color. It is produced by first cutting an area slightly larger than needed for a color, then abrading the edges of that area to make the transition from that color less sharp. This is commonly used in clouds and shading. ===Freehand techniques=== Some techniques are performed freehand, without using a printing block, and results can vary considerably from print to print. ' is used for finer details, such as around eyes, and requires the artist to draw with a brush loaded with ink on a wetted area; as with ', the bleeding of the ink into the water creates gradations. ' is similar, requiring the wetting of areas to be inked, and is used for details such as clouds. ==ReferencesWorks cited=== * ==Further reading== * Newland, Amy Reigle. (2005).

Robinson Jr. (born August 27, 1954 in Oakland, California) is a former American middle distance runner. He was the dominant American 800 meters runner from the mid-1970s through the mid 1980s. He ran in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, finishing fifth in his semi-final and not making the final. He was on the ill-fated 1980 U.S. Olympic team that did not get to compete due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. He did however receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. His international achievements included a silver medal at the 1979 IAAF World Cup and 1981 IAAF World Cup and a gold medal at the 1979 Pan American Games over the reigning Olympic Gold Medalist and (until that week) world record holder, Alberto Juantorena. He also finished fifth in the 1983 World Championships in Athletics. Domestically he won the American title at 880 yard or 800 meters 7 times including five times in a row between 1978 and 1982. During that same period while Robinson was the best outdoors, he did not win a single Indoor title. The answer to this was that Robinson's strategy didn't work on the short straightaways indoors. Robinson's notable strategy was to come from behind, with the late rush on the home stretch always thrilling the crowd. When this strategy evaded him, it almost always looked like a mere strategic error, rather than being beaten by the competition. In the 1984 Olympic Trials in what may have been the most thrilling American 800 meter race ever, Robinson finished in fourth place, not making the team, while having exactly the same time as the third place qualifier John Marshall (1:43.92 - a lifetime best for both men). A step ahead, Earl Jones and Johnny Gray were breaking Rick Wohlhuter's American record (1:43.91) with each running the same time (1:43.74).http://www.legacy.usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdf Olympic Trials results Robinson ran for the Inner City Track Club after college. Robinson ran for McClymonds High School, finishing second in the 880 yards at the 1972 CIF California State Meet. Next he ran for Laney College, winning the conference and state championships at 880 yards both 1973 and 1974, his 1974 time of 1:45.7 set the National Junior College record for 800 meters and remains the Laney College record. His 47.5 440 yards from 1974 also remains the college record. He also anchored his team's mile relay which finished second and third those respective years. And he ran for the University of California at Berkeley, California where he is still #2 on the school's all-time list and the anchor man of the school record 4x400 meters relay team (held since 1976, the first year the NCAA ran the metric distance).< Robinson is currently an assistant Track and Cross Country coach at California State University, East Bay.http://www.eastbaypioneers.com/roster.aspx?path=mcross ==ReferencesCategory:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Oakland, California Category:Track and field athletes from California Category:American male middle-distance runners Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1979 Pan American Games Category:Junior college men's track and field athletes in the United States Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Congressional Gold Medal recipients ","title":"James Robinson (runner)"},{"id":"20364166","text":"Researchers have suggested a link between handedness and ability with mathematics. This link has been proposed by Geschwind, Galaburda, Annett, and Kilshaw. The suggested link is that a brain without extreme bias towards locating language in the left hemisphere would have an advantage in mathematical ability. Left hand signature ==Body of researchDouglas study=== A 1967 study by Douglas, found no evidence to correlate mathematical ability with left-handedness or ambidexterity. The study compared the people who came in the top 15% of a mathematics examination with those of moderate mathematical ability, and found that the two groups' handedness preferences were similar. However, it did find that those who came lowest in the test had mixed hand preferences. A study in 1979 by Peterson found a trend towards low rates of left-handedness in science students. ===Jones and Bell study=== A 1980 study by Jones and Bell also obtained negative results. This study compared the handedness of a group of engineering students with strong mathematics skills against the handedness of a group of psychology students (of varying mathematics skills). In both cases, the distribution of handedness resembled that of the general population. ===Annett and Kilshaw study=== Annett and Kilshaw themselves support their hypothesis with several examples, including a handedness questionnaire given to undergraduates. Annett observes that studies that depend from voluntary returns of a handedness questionnaire are going to be biased towards left-handedness, and notes that this was a weakness of the study. However, the results were that there were significantly more left-handers amongst male mathematics undergraduates than male non- mathematics undergraduates (21% versus 11%) and significantly more non-right- handers (44% versus 24%), and that there was a similar but smaller left- handedness difference for female undergraduates (11% versus 8%). Annett reports the results of this study as being consistent with the hypothesis, for explaining the cause of handedness, of an absent genetic right-shift factor. Other examples used by Annett include a study that observed the hand use of teachers of mathematics and other sciences from various universities and polytechnics, as they underwent a personal interview, compared to a control group comprising non-mathematics teachers. Again, a statistically significant difference was found for males, and again Annett states this to be consistent with the right-shift model. Further examples are a 1986 study by Benbow and a 1990 study by Temple of staff at the University of Oxford, which, Annett states, show not that there is a predominance of left-handers in talented groups, whether that talent be with mathematics or otherwise, but rather that there is a shortfall in such groups of people who are strongly right-handed. === Benbow study === A study by C. P. Benbow did not work to prove the mathematical abilities of study participants who are left-hand dominant but to prove the weakness in those who are right-hand dominant. Using a series of questions that relate left-handedness and mathematical giftedness, Benbow was able to base their team's conclusion off of a series of questions that associated hand dominance and mathematical ability. === Ongoing Debate === As a controversial subject, the debate over the link between handedness and mathematical abilities is ongoing. Researchers at the University of Liverpool concluded that there is a moderate, yet significant correlation between mathematical skills and handedness. ==See also References  Further reading == * Category:Motor skills Category:Mathematics education Category:Handedness ","title":"Handedness and mathematical ability"},{"id":"20364174","text":"On the Margin was a British satirical comedy sketch show written and performed by Alan Bennett and a regular cast including John Sergeant, Virginia Stride, Madge Hindle and Yvonne Gilan.

Although she appeared throughout Europe and in the United States, Bréval spent most of her career performing with the Paris Opera where she became a greatly admired interpreter of French grand opera roles and Wagner heroines. She also specialized in the works of Gluck and Rameau, becoming particularly associated with the title roles in Gluck’s Armide and Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie. A favorite of the composers of her day, such as Massenet and Dukas, Bréval sang in numerous world premières during her career. ==Biography== Born with the name Bertha Agnès Lisette Schilling, Bréval initially studied to be a pianist at Lausanne and briefly in Geneva before deciding to pursue an opera career.\\"Bréval, Lucienne\\", Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, Personenteil:3 p 874. She studied voice with Victor Warot at the Paris Conservatoire before making her debut at the Paris Opera in 1892 as Selika in l'Africaine by Giacomo Meyerbeer. ===At the Paris Opéra=== Bréval became a principal soprano at the Paris Opéra and remained there until 1919.J.B. Steane: \\"Lucienne Bréval\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed November 17, 2008), (subscription access) Her roles with the company included several world premières including Augusta Holmès's La Montagne Noire (1895), Camille Erlanger's Le fils de l' étoile (1904), Dukas’ Ariane et Barbe-bleue (1907), Massenet's Bacchus (1909), and the title roles in Massenet's Ariane (1906) and Henry Février’s Monna Vanna (1909). She also was Kundry in France's first performance of Wagner's Parsifal (1914). Her other notable roles at the Paris Opera included Brünnhilde in Richard Wagner's Die Walküre (1893), Venus in Wagner's Tannhäuser (1895), Marguerite in Hector Berlioz's La damnation de Faust (1897), and the title role in Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie (1908). Bréval also occasionally appeared in productions at the Opéra-Comique in Paris. Most notably she portrayed the title role in the world premiere of Massenet’s Grisélidis in 1901, and in 1910 she sang Lady Macbeth in the première of Ernst Bloch’s Macbeth, which he dedicated to her. ===International career=== In 1899, Bréval made her first appearance at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden as Valentine in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots.Lucienne Bréval biography from Operissimo.com (In German) Two years later she made her American début at the Metropolitan Opera as Chimène in Le Cid, singing also in Die Walküre and the American première of Ernest Reyer’s Salammbô. Five years later she returned to Covent Garden for the second and last time in the title role of Gluck’s Armide. In 1913 she created the title role in Fauré’s Pénélope at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo; her other title roles there had been in Isidore De Lara's Amy Robsart and in Bizet's Carmen. Throughout her career Bréval appeared in recitals and concerts throughout Europe, including performances in Italy, England, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland and throughout France. In spite of her great reputation in Europe she was not as well received in America as critics believed her singing lacked polish and described her acting as \\"semaphoric\\". After her retirement from the stage in 1919, Bréval taught singing in Paris. ==Recordings== The only sound recording of Bréval singing was made on a Mapleson cylinder during a performance of L’Africaine at the Metropolitan Opera. ==Sources== Category:1869 births Category:1935 deaths Category:People from Zürich Category:Swiss operatic sopranos Category:Burials at the Cimetière des Batignolles Category:19th-century women singers Category:19th-century Swiss singers Category:20th-century Swiss singers Category:20th-century women singers Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni ","title":"Lucienne Bréval"},{"id":"20364274","text":"Steven Wood (17 March 1961 – 23 November 1995) was an Australian sprint and marathon canoeist who competed in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Its larvae feed on the oleander plant. Like most wasp moths, these are day fliers. They prefer Neotropic areas, to which they are native. The North American subspecies is S. epilais jucundissima, which is locally common in all areas of Florida, and has been seen as far north as South Carolina, and west to Mississippi and Texas. == Description == They are dark metallic blue with white polka-dots on the wings and upper abdomen, and the tip of the abdomen is bright red. This mimicry makes it look like a dangerous wasp, while in fact being a harmless moth. The caterpillars are orange or dark orange with long black hairs making the caterpillars look dangerous, but the setae do not inflict any harm. S. epilais jucundissima in Savannah, Georgia == Reproduction and breeding == Females contact male polka-dot wasp moths by means of ultrasonic signals. On the branch, the sound travels, and then the male follows the sound to his new mate. When he reaches her, he emits an answering signal. After mating, the females find a plant on which to lay their eggs. Groups of from 12 to 75 eggs are laid on the undersides of the oleander leaves. The spherical eggs are pale cream to light yellow in color; each is less than 1 mm in diameter. ==As a pest== Larva The larvae stage of the polka-dot wasp moth, commonly called the oleander caterpillar, is widely known for its gluttonous appetite. The caterpillar feeds in almost any location (excepting California) where its food, the oleander plant, can be found. They are gregarious and can cause damage from minor to severe. It may also feed on devil's potato plants, which are believed to be its native food before the oleander plant was introduced to the Americas by Spanish settlers in the seventeenth century. They also feed on desert rose plants. ==Subspecies== *Syntomeida epilais epilais *Syntomeida epilais jucundissima Dyar, 1907 (Florida, Georgia) ==See also== *Oleander *Euchromiini *Empyreuma pugione, spotted oleandar caterpillar moth ==References *Image gallery of the moth and larva Category:Euchromiina ","title":"Syntomeida epilais"},{"id":"20364518","text":"Morland may refer to: ==Places== *Morland, Cumbria, England *Morland, Kansas, USA ==Surnames== * Morland (surname) == See also == * Morland Brewery, opened in 1711, closed in 2000 * The Morland Dynasty, a series of novels by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles * Moorland (disambiguation) * Mooreland (disambiguation) * Moreland (disambiguation) * Westmorland ","title":"Morland"},{"id":"20364524","text":"Hampshire shown in England There are over 9000 Grade I listed buildings in England.

Federer rallied from 3–1 down against Blake to win 7–6, taking the tiebreaker 10–7. John McEnroe won the battle of the old timers when he beat former arch-rival Björn Borg 7–6 (13–11). For Borg and McEnroe, both sporting grey hair, it was a walk down memory lane, revisiting the highs and lows of their bitter rivalry, typified by the 1980 Wimbledon final won by Borg in five gruelling sets. McEnroe played to the crowd, making fun of himself, only occasionally glaring at the linesman or umpire and throwing his racquet just twice. In spite of being 52, Borg showed he hadn't lost his touch, still exhibiting some sublime passing shots that left 49-year-old McEnroe grudgingly nodding his approval. \\"He was my great rival and I knew it would be close,\\" said McEnroe.

He played college football at Boston College. Raji was drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the ninth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. He won Super Bowl XLV with the Packers against the Pittsburgh Steelers. ==Early years== Raji was born in New York City on July 11, 1986, the son to Busari Raji, Sr. and Mamie Raji. A three-year starter on both the offensive and defensive lines at Westwood Regional High School, he earned All-State, All-Conference, and All-County honors as a senior. Raji was also a two-time All-Bergen County Scholastic League choice. In 2003, he recorded 75 tackles, 7.5 sacks, and four forced fumbles. He was selected to play in the 2004 Governor's Bowl, a game played between the top high-school seniors in New Jersey and New York. Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Raji was not ranked among the top defensive tackle prospects of the Class of 2004, which also included DeMario Pressley, Frank Okam, and Glenn Dorsey. Raji chose to attend Boston College over Rutgers and Wisconsin. ==College career== Raji made the Boston College Eagles as a true freshman in 2004, playing in a rotation behind senior Tim Bulman. He made his college debut in the home opener against Penn State, making one tackle. He finished the year with 13 tackles (6 solos) and 1.5 tackles for loss. As a sophomore, Raji started in all twelve games, registering 27 tackles (20 solos), 6.5 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks, and one pass breakup. He recorded one unassisted tackle against Boise State in the MPC Computers Bowl. In his 2006 junior season, Raji started in 12 games, finishing with 63 career tackles (37 solos), 16.5 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks, and four pass breakups. He also had three solo stops, including two tackles for loss in the Meineke Car Care Bowl against Navy. Raji missed the 2007 season due to academic reasons. Returning to the team in 2008, he started on a defense that included Ron Brace, Kevin Akins, Mark Herzlich, Robert Francois, and Brian Toal, anchoring the defense to a berth in the 2008 Music City Bowl. Over his four-year college career, Raji amassed 99 tackles (23 for a loss) and 9 sacks, and was named all-ACC twice, in 2006 as a 2nd-team member and in 2008 as a first-team starter.http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/spec- rel/112706aag.html ACC 2006http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa- football/story/2008-12-01/2008-all-acc-football-team ACC 2008 ==Professional career== Raji was selected ninth overall by the Green Bay Packers in the 2009 NFL Draft. He was worked into defensive coordinator Dom Capers' brand new 3-4 scheme during the start of the Packers 2009 season. Raji held out during the 2009 training camp and completed his deal on August 14. Hampered by an ankle injury for the entire season, he appeared in fourteen games (once as a starter), and managed 25 tackles and 1 sack. Fully recovered and expected to fully contribute for the 2010 season, Raji earned the starting position at the sole defensive tackle position in Capers' 3-4 type defense, switching previous starter Ryan Pickett to defensive end. 2010 was a breakout season, as he started in all 16 games. Raji became the defensive anchor that the Packers had envisioned, accumulating 39 tackles with 6.5 sacks, along with 3 passes defended. The Packers began using Raji as an additional fullback in their goal line offense during the 2011 postseason, which led to Raji nicknaming himself \\"The Freezer\\" in homage to William Perry, who played for the Bears and was nicknamed \\"The Fridge\\". On January 23, 2011, in the fourth quarter of the NFC Championship Game at Soldier Field in Chicago, Raji intercepted a pass from Bears backup quarterback Caleb Hanie and returned it 18 yards to the end zone, marking Raji's first career interception and touchdown. The 337-pound Raji performed a memorable hula dance after the touchdown, an incident that was parodied in a State Farm Insurance commercial featuring Raji and Aaron Rodgers. The play also broke William Perry's NFL record for the heaviest player to score a post-season touchdown. The touchdown proved to be the decisive score, and with that interception, the Packers advanced to Super Bowl XLV, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 31-25. Raji against the Kansas City Chiefs in 2011 In the 2011 offseason, Raji was ranked #81 by his peers on NFL Network’s Top 100 Greatest Players of 2011, where he was presented by New York Giants center Shaun O'Hara. In early August 2011, Raji was named the co-host of the \\"In The Huddle\\" radio show along with longtime Wisconsin sports reporter Bill Scott. The one-hour show airs live from Tanner's Sports Bar in Kimberly near Green Bay. During a Week 11 matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 20, on his first and only carry of his career, Raji scored a rushing touchdown in the 35–26 victory. He was only the fourth defensive lineman to score a rushing touchdown since the NFL/AFL merger. On December 28, 2011, he was elected to his first Pro Bowl appearance. In 16 games of the 2011 season, Raji registered 3 sacks and 2 passes defended on 24 tackles.

Raji against the New York Giants in January 2012. Raji played in 14 games in the 2012 season, making 26 tackles and defended two passes. The Packers' defensive line became short-handed in 2013 due to injuries. Raji was transitioned to defensive end, while Ryan Pickett maintained the role at defensive tackle. He started all 16 games at defensive end, making 17 tackles. On August 22, 2014, in a preseason game against the Oakland Raiders, Raji suffered a torn right biceps. He was subsequently placed on injured reserve, and missed the entire 2014 NFL season. On March 30, 2015, Raji signed a one-year, $3.5 million deal with the Packers. In the 2015 season, Raji totaled 22 tackles and half a sack. ===Hiatus=== On March 14, 2016, Raji announced his retirement from professional football after seven seasons, but noted he would return to the league and that he may simply be taking a \\"hiatus\\". ===Statistics=== Source: NFL.com {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - ! rowspan=2Year !! rowspan=2Team !! rowspan=2G !! rowspan=2GS !! colspan=5 Tackles !! colspan=6 Interceptions !! colspan=2 Fumbles - !

He worked as a miner, mail contractor, and farmer before entering politics. He was first elected to the Senate at the age of 36 and won re-election on five further occasions. Aylett was placed at the bottom of the ALP ticket for the 1953 election, but issued his own campaign material and was re-elected. He was subsequently censured by the ALP state executive for his defiance of the party's instructions. In 1959, a year into his final term, Aylett decided to move to Queensland's Gold Coast, for what he said were health reasons. He kept his office in Launceston, but his decision to move states proved controversial. In 1962, Aylett's frequent absences from the Senate came under public scrutiny. He was censured by the ALP federal executive for his attendance record, although moves to expel him were unsuccessful, and he retired from parliament at the next election. ==Early life== Aylett was born on 15 November 1900 in Wynyard, Tasmania. He was the sixth of the twelve children of Harriett Susanna (née Matthews) and Edward Aylett; his younger brother Charley served in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Aylett's father was a farmer and furrier. His grandfather William Aylett arrived in Australia as a convict, transported to Van Diemen's Land in 1845 after stealing two beehives. In 1914, Aylett and his family moved to Waratah, where his father was the manager of a coffee palace. He began working in the Mount Bischoff tin mines at the age of 16, and later mined osmiridium. He married Ruby Goldsmith in Burnie on 10 July 1920, and the couple had a daughter and son together. Around the time of his marriage he was working as a driver at Wivenhoe. Aylett later moved to Wonthaggi, Victoria, to work at the State Coal Mine. In a speech to the Senate in 1942, he recalled being ordered to lie \\"in cold water under hanging rock which was likely to fall at any moment, and scrape out the mullock which had accumulated there\\". He refused to do so and was fired, but was rehired the following day after other miners agitated for his return. Aylett eventually returned to Tasmania, working at Deloraine as a mail contractor and later as a farmer at Mole Creek. He moved to Burnie in 1936. Aylett was the founding secretary of the Mole Creek branch of the ALP, and became a life member of the branch. He stood unsuccessfully for the House of Assembly at the 1937 state election, running on the Labor ticket in the Division of Darwin. ==Senate== Aylett in 1938, as a senator- elect Aylett was elected to the Senate at the 1937 federal election, aged 36, polling the most votes of any Tasmanian candidate. On election day in Launceston he knocked down a woman with his car while she was travelling to a polling booth. She suffered cuts to her leg and was taken to Launceston General Hospital; she was only able to vote when state Labor MP John Madden drove her to a booth shortly before the close of polling. Aylett's first term began on 1 July 1938. He served on the senate committees for printing (1938–1943), regulations and ordinances (1943–1946), disputed returns and qualifications (1950–1951), and standing orders (1950–1951), as well as the joint committees on rural industries (1941–1942) and public works (1943–1946) and a select committee into road safety (1959). He devoted most of his attention to regional issues, speaking on subjects as trivial as the dangers of the steps at the New Norfolk post office. In 1944, he \\"produced a neatly packaged rabbit, recommending it as meat for wartime Australians\\". He took an interest in the remote community of King Island, lobbying on behalf of its residents and serving as a delegate for the local ALP branch. From March 1942 to February 1943, Aylett was assistant minister to Eddie Ward, the Minister for Labour and National Service, on issues relating to Tasmania. He was re- elected at the 1943 federal election, again winning the most votes of any Tasmanian candidate. Aylett served two terms on the ALP state executive (1945–1947, 1954–1958), and represented Tasmania at federal conferences and on the federal executive. He was re-elected to a three-year Senate term at the 1951 election, after a double dissolution. In 1954 he travelled outside Australia for the first and only time, as a delegate to a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in Kenya. ===1953 election=== Advertisement used by Aylett at the 1953 election, encouraging voters to give him their first preference despite being ranked fourth on the ALP ticket In 1952, Aylett was defeated in the preselection ballot for Labor's Senate ticket at the 1953 election. He and Reg Murray polled an equal number of votes, before Murray's name was drawn out of a hat. Another serving senator, Bill Morrow, was also dropped from the ticket. Aylett publicly criticised the ALP state executive, and his supporters in the labour movement attempted to overturn the result of the ballot. However, the death of Jack Chamberlain in January 1953 opened up an additional vacancy in the Senate, allowing Aylett to return to the ticket. He was ranked fourth on the ticket, behind George Cole, Justin O'Byrne, and Murray. Aylett defied the ALP's official campaign material, issuing his own how-to-vote cards telling voters to rank him first. His campaign was successful, as he out-polled both O'Byrne and Murray by significant margins. This resulted in Murray failing to win a seat, and he subsequently wrote privately to Fred Daly that Aylett had won re-election \\"by treachery, fraud and wilful deception\\". In June 1953, he was censured by the ALP state executive for his actions. The following month, the federal executive also debated a resolution of censure, moved by the New South Wales delegation, but decided to refer the case back to the state executive. Until the election of Lisa Singh in 2016, Aylett was the only person to have been elected to the Senate ahead of a higher-ranked candidate on the same ticket. ===Final term=== Aylett towards the end of his career Aylett was re-elected to a sixth term in the Senate at the 1958 federal election. In September 1959, it was made public that he had decided to move to the Gold Coast; he and his son purchased four shops and two flats at Palm Beach. Aylett's decision to live in Queensland while representing Tasmania in the Senate proved controversial. After media criticism, he stated that he had moved primarily for health reasons, as he had suffered a stroke in 1956 and his wife had also been in poor health. He said that he would maintain an office in Launceston, and promised to live on the Gold Coast only during the summer recess, when parliament was not in session. The state executive determined that no disciplinary action was possible as he had not broken any party rules. In 1961, Aylett was accused of exerting undue pressure on members of the Gold Coast City Council to approve a building application. In August 1962, the ALP caucus voted to require its members to attend all parliamentary sittings and vote in every division, unless exempted. The new rules were \\"directed chiefly at Senator Aylett\\", who had been absent without explanation on a number of occasions that year. In October, the ALP federal executive unanimously passed a resolution expressing \\"grave concern\\" at his \\"continued and unwarranted absences from Parliament\\". In the preceding year, he had been present in the Senate on only 18 out of 47 sitting days and had only voted twice. Aylett was asked to show cause as to why he should not be expelled from the ALP. He appeared before the state executive, which took no action after he attributed his absences to health difficulties. Aylett was quizzed about his attendance record in a television interview, where according to the Canberra Times he \\"repeatedly evaded requests to pinpoint his achievements for Tasmania in his 25 years in the Senate\\", instead telling the interviewer that \\"great men such as Sir Winston Churchill had not bragged about their achievements\\". ==Later life== Aylett did not seek re-election in 1964 and his term ended on 30 June 1965. He remained involved in public affairs after leaving parliament, serving as president of the Palm Beach Association (1964–1970) and president of the United Council of Progress Associations of Gold Coast City (1969–1970). He died on the Gold Coast on 10 August 1976, aged 75. His obituary in the Hobart Mercury noted that he had \\"upset his party and political tradition\\" and would be remembered for \\"controversy about his absenteeism from Parliament and his electorate\\". In the foreword to the third volume of The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate, Harry Evans describes Aylett as \\"the outstanding example\\" of senators \\"who simply occupied spaces with little or no contribution\\". ==NotesReferences * Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Tasmania Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1900 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Wynyard, Tasmania Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Bill Aylett"},{"id":"20364914","text":"Harry Pree Billiard (November 11, 1883 – June 3, 1923), nicknamed \\"Pree\\", was an American Major League Baseball pitcher who played in with the New York Highlanders of the American League, then in with the Indianapolis Hoosiers, continuing with the team in when it moved and became the Newark Pepper.

The current mayor is María Meléndez, also known as \\"Mayita\\". ==Historical background== From 1692 to 1840, the office of mayor in Ponce was filled either by local hacendados or by military officers appointed by the governor, depending on whether the political situation on Spain at the time was that of a constitutional or an absolutist government.Guillermo Baralt. Buena Vista: Life and Work in a Puerto Rican Hacienda. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. 1999. p. 131. From 1840 to 1870, mayors were oftentimes elected by the municipal council, whose members were called regidores. In 1870, political parties were created for the first time and municipal officials were elected by the people at large, and the mayor, as well as the members of the municipal council, would belong to one of the two parties active, either the Partido Liberal Reformista or the Partido Incondicional Español.Socorro Giron. Ramon Marin y su Tiempo. In, Ramon Marin's Las Fiestas Populares de Ponce. Editorial de la Universidad de Puerto Rico. 1994. p. 16. With the advent of the American political system in Puerto Rico after the American invasion of 1898, the mayor was elected by popular vote, which is the system still (2019) in place. ==First popularly elected mayor== Ponce's first mayor was Don Pedro Sánchez de Mathos, in 1692, appointed by governor Juan Robles de Lorenzana. Ponce elected its first mayor (as well as its first Municipal Assembly) on 20 September 1812.Ponce se prepara para celebrar su día mundial. Darisabel Texidor Guadalupe. Primera Hora. 30 August 2013. Retrieved 30 August 2013. Its first elected mayor was José Ortiz de la Renta, who took office in 1812. Ortiz de la Renta occupied the post of mayor on eight different occasions between 1812 and 1846. The current mayor of Ponce is María \\"Mayita\\" Meléndez Altieri, from the New Progressive Party, elected in 2008. She became the first woman elected to the office of mayor by the people of Ponce in its extensive political history. She is also the first mayor of a party other than the Popular Democratic Party in Ponce since 1989, when Rafael \\"Churumba\\" Cordero Santiago won the elections and took the oath of office that same year. ==Titles== Throughout the centuries, the Ponce municipal heads of government, may have held titles different than the modern title of \\"Mayor\\". Some of the other titles held were Teniente a guerra, Corregidor, Alcalde mayor, Alcalde ordinario, Justicia mayor, Alcalde constitucional, Alcalde en propiedad, Alcalde real ordinario, and Comandante militar. Regardless of the different titles held, the people in this position were the maximum civil authority at the municipal level. \\"Alcaldes\\" in the Spanish colonial tradition referred to a position attained via election by the regidores (council members) of the municipal council, and refers to someone who had both judicial and administrative functions. \\"Mayor\\", on the other hand, refers to a local executive, elected by the people, with administrative functions only. ==18th century== Source: Eduardo Neumann Gandía,\\"Verdadera y Auténtica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce.\\" 1913.

The Tomb of Orcus (), sometimes called the Tomb of Murina (), is a 4th-century BC Etruscan hypogeum (burial chamber) in Tarquinia, Italy. Discovered in 1868, it displays Hellenistic influences in its remarkable murals, which include the portrait of Velia Velcha, an Etruscan noblewoman, and the only known pictorial representation of the demon Tuchulcha. In general, the murals are noted for their depiction of death, evil, and unhappiness. Because the tomb was built in two sections at two stages, it is sometimes referred to as the Tombs of Orcus I and II; it is believed to have belonged to the Murina family, an offshoot of the Etruscan Spurinnae. The foundation is inscribed with the following enigmatic phrase: ==History== Orcus I was built between 470 and 450 BC (perhaps by a man named Leive; see below); a separate hypogeum, Orcus II, was built c. 325 BC. At some point in antiquity the wall between the two was removed, creating a large tomb with two dromes (entrances). The tomb was excavated in 1868 by an officer of the French Army. Upon its discovery, the excavator mistook the painting of a cyclops for the Roman god Orcus (see below), hence the name \\"Tomb of Orcus\\". The Italian name (Tomba dell'Orco) can also mean \\"Tomb of the Ogre\\", and it is used that way in Italy today. The second tomb has never been fully excavated. ==Murals== Though most of the walls are muraled, the artists did not complete the ceiling. A scientific analysis in 2001 revealed that the paint used contained cinnabar, ochre, orpiment, calcite, copper, and Egyptian blue. While the artwork in Orcus I is highly praised (particularly the painting of Velia Velcha; see below), some of the artwork of Orcus II is considered poorly done. It is likely that the French excavators of the tomb tried to remove some of the murals for exhibition in the Louvre, which resulted in significant deterioration. ===Orcus I=== Velia Velcha, as pictured on the right wall of Orcus I. The Tomb of Orcus I (also known as the Tomb of Velcha) was constructed between 470 and 450 BC. The main and right walls depict a banquet, believed to be the Spurinnae after their death in the Battle of Syracuse. The banqueters are surrounded by demons who serve as cupbearers. One of the banqueters is a noblewoman named Velia Velcha (or by some interpretations, Velia Spurinna), whose portrait has been called the \\"Mona Lisa of antiquity\\". Her realistic profile (especially her eye) bears the influence of Hellenistic art. Unlike the Mona Lisa, however, she is noted for her grimace or sneer. ===Orcus II=== These and TuchulchaThe Tomb of Orcus II (sometimes distinguished as the Tomb of Orcus) was constructed around 325 BC. Its entrance is guarded by paintings of \\"Charun\\" (Charon), the keeper of the underworld, and a cyclops (possibly Polyphemus or Geryon). When the tomb was originally discovered, the cyclops was mistaken for the Roman god of the underworld, Orcus (hence the tomb's name). The back wall depicts a funeral procession overseen by \\"Aita\\" (Hades), the Etruscan god of the underworld, and his wife \\"Phersipnei\\" (Persephone). The left wall is believed to depict Agamemnon, Tiresias, and Ajax in the underworld. \\"These\\" (Theseus) and the Etruscan equivalent of Pirithous are seated at a table on the right wall, playing a board game, where they are threatened by the Etruscan demon \\"Tuchulcha\\", who is pictured with pointed ears, a hairy face, and a hooked beak, wielding snakes in his hands. The tomb is unique in that it bears the only known historical portrayal of this demon. ==Inscription== An inscription in the foundation of the tomb reads as follows: > LARΘIALE HVLΧNIESI MARCESIC CALIAΘESI MVNSLE NACNVAIASI ΘAMCE LE… This has come to be understood as: > Larthiale Hulchniesi Marcesi Caliathesi munisule nacnvaiasi thamuce Le… The names \\"Larthiale Hulchniesi\\" and \\"Marcesi[c] Caliathesi\\" are in the dative case, and thus mean \\"for/to Larth Hulchnie\\" and \\"for/to Marce *Caliathe\\" respectively; \\"nacnvaiasi\\" is also dative, from the Etruscan noun nacnvaia, \\"those who come next\\" (i.e., posterity); the noun \\"mun[i]s[u]le\\" refers to any underground monument (and not exclusively to tombs); the verb \\"tham[u]ce\\" means \\"established\\"; the final \\"Le…\\" is the Etruscan letters LE clipped off, though a portion of the next letter is visible, sometimes interpreted as an \\"i\\"; the entire name \\"Leive\\" has been suggested. The phrase then translates: > Le[ive] erected this monument to Larth Hulchnie and Marce Caliathe for > posterity. Larth Hulchnie is believed to have been the magistrate of Tarquinia in the 4th century BC, and Marce Caliathe is believed to have been his \\"representative\\". Whether the transcription means, however, that Larth Hulchnie and Marce Caliathe were buried in the tomb is debated, especially since they were not Spurinnae; most scholars believe that the monument was simply dedicated to the magistrates. Etruscologists Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante have suggested that the passage is incomplete and would have originally specified \\"during the magistracy\\" of Hulchnie and Caliathe (confer zilci Velusi Hulchniesi, \\"during the magistracy of Velu Hulchnie\\", found elsewhere in the tomb). According to this interpretation, the phrase would translate: > Le[ive] erected this monument for posterity [during the magistracy] of Larth > Hulchnie and Marce Caliathe. \\"Marce\\" is probably a cognate or preform of \\"Marcus\\". \\"Hulchnie\\" is generally interpreted as the Roman gens \\"Fulcinius\\", and \\"Larth\\" is believed to be akin to the Greek name \\"Laertēs\\"; some have suggested that Larth Hulchnie means \\"Hulchnie, son of Larth\\". ==References *Official website of the Tomb of Orcus Category:1868 archaeological discoveries Orcus ","title":"Tomb of Orcus"},{"id":"20364973","text":"Attila Adrovicz (born 8 April 1966) is a Hungarian sprint canoer who competed from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. == Career == He won a silver medal in the K-4 1000 m event at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

The episode revolves around the wedding of popular recurring character Leon Carp and his boyfriend Scott. It was written by William Lucas Walker and directed by Gail Mancuso. The episode originally aired on ABC on December 12, 1995, making history as the first time an American television series had ever depicted the same-sex wedding of a recurring character. ==Plot== Roseanne meets Scott (Fred Willard) at her diner and learns he will be marrying Leon (Martin Mull) at the end of the week and that Leon had left him at the altar five years earlier. Because they have to be out of town for pre-wedding counseling, Roseanne volunteers to plan the wedding for free. Leon arrives at the wedding venue and is appalled at Roseanne's decor, which includes drag queens, male strippers and enormous pink triangles. He attempts to flee and goes so far as to claim he isn't really gay since he hates shopping, he's insensitive, he detests Barbra Streisand and he's a Republican. Roseanne counters by asking \\"But do you like having sex with men? GAY!\\" In a last desperate effort, he kisses Roseanne. He confirms that he is gay and goes forward with the wedding. With the drag queens and strippers toned down, Leon and Scott exchange their vows. ==Cameos== Mariel Hemingway reprised her role as Sharon, the woman who kissed Roseanne in the 1994 episode \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\". When Roseanne's husband Dan (John Goodman) is distressed when the grooms kiss (off-screen), Roseanne chides him for making a fuss about two people of the same sex kissing and Sharon sits down behind her. Her appearance serves as a callback to the earlier episode and the controversy that surrounded it. \\"December Bride\\" also features cameos by Christopher Morley, Alexis Arquette, David Michaels and June Lockhart as Leon's mom. Milton Berle famously appeared in drag in the final scene of the episode to catch the bridal bouquet.Hester, Jere. \\"Milton Berle, A TV Legend, Is Dead.\\" New York Daily News.

An ABC spokesperson stated that this was not because of the inclusion of a same-sex wedding but because \\"the adult humor in this episode was more appropriate for the later time period\\". ==Spin-off== Roseanne Barr proposed spinning off Leon and Scott into their own series, which she would co-create with \\"December Bride\\" writer William Lucas Walker. In the spinoff, Leon and Scott were to be raising a teenage daughter fathered by Leon years before. Barr suggested Don Knotts and RuPaul could play an inter-racial, inter- generational neighbor couple. Walker and Barr submitted a treatment, but ABC did not accept the series, reportedly because the network believed that a series with a gay couple as the central characters could not be sustained.Capsuto, p. 362 ==NotesReferences== * Capsuto, Steven (2000).

The final was contested by Bohemians and Derry City, with Bohemians winning 4-3 on penalties after extra time had finished 2-2. It was the first ever FAI Cup Final to be decided by a penalty shoot-out and it was the seventh time Bohemians had won the trophy, the victory granting them a league and cup double for the season.

His grandfather, Rabbi Aron Walkin, was the Chief Rabbi of Pinsk, Belarus, and a Torah giant of his day. His maternal grandfather, Rabbi Moshe Londinsky, headed the yeshiva in Radin with the Chofetz Chaim. His uncle and namesake, Rabbi Chaim Walkin, served as the last dean of the Volozhin yeshiva\\"Rav Chaim Valkin, Hy’d, took over the positions of rav and Roshei Yeshiva\\", article by Motty Meringer,17.05.09. tog.co.il until World War II. Walkin's father, Rabbi Shmuel Walkin, was active in rescue of Jews during World War II from Europe. He headed the Jewish community in Shanghai, and was famous for his warmth and care of all the refugees. Upon arrival in the U.S. he founded a synagogue for the refugee families and provided for their needs. The Shanghai refugees were his closest family until his death in 1979. ==Childhood and education== Using unauthorized transit visas, issued by the Japanese Consul Chiune Sugihara, the Walkin family escaped from the Nazis together with the Mir yeshiva (Poland) and its community from Vilna, Lithuania, via the Trans-Siberian Railway to Kobe, Japan, then to China where they found relative peace. In 1946 the Walkin family left China for the United States and settled in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York. When Chaim Walkin was eight years old he was granted his American citizenship. The ceremony was commemorated with a photograph and an article on the front page of The New York Times and the Herald Tribune.The New York Times, Friday, February 12, 1953 He began his studies at Yeshiva Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, then in Telshe yeshiva in Cleveland, Ohio. ==Immigration to Israel== After his marriage in 1967, Walkin immigrated to Israel, settled in Jerusalem and established his place of study at the Mir yeshiva under the head of the yeshiva then, Rabbi Chaim Leib Shmuelevitz. ==Positions== After studying at the Mir yeshiva, Walkin was appointed as an instructor in Talmud at Aish HaTorah Yeshiva in the Old City of Jerusalem, and Ohr Israel Yeshiva in Petah Tikva. In 1989, after the death of the dean of Yeshiva Ateres Israel, Rabbi Walkin moved back to Jerusalem and took the position of Dean of Rabbinical Academy and Yeshiva Ateres Israel. ==Leadership and educational agenda== Rabbi Walkin developed his signature method in line with the teachings of Rabbi Chaim Leib Shmuelevitz, with emphasis on personal attention to individual students, in groups of six to eight students at a time and short lectures with clearly defined message. He espoused a way of education through cooperation and not by harsh methods. In July 2008, Rabbi Walkin suffered a stroke in his home in Jerusalem, which prevented him for some months from continuing his obligations in the Rabbinical Academy. After a period of rehabilitation, he returned to his position. ==Publications== * The World Within — Contemporary Mussar Essays.

He is the author of two collections of short stories and three novels. City of Bohane was the winner of the 2013 International Dublin Literary Award. Beatlebone won the 2015 Goldsmiths Prize and is one of seven books by Irish authors nominated for the 2017 International Dublin Literary Award, the world's most valuable annual literary fiction prize for books published in English. His 2019 novel Night Boat to Tangier was longlisted for the 2019 Booker Prize. Barry is also an editor of Winter Papers, an arts and culture annual. ==Biography== Born in Limerick, Barry spent much of his youth travelling, living in 17 addresses by the time he was 36. He lived variously in Cork, Santa Barbara, Barcelona, and Liverpool before settling in Sligo, purchasing and renovating a run-down Royal Irish Constabulary barracks. His decision to settle down was driven primarily by the increasing difficulty in moving large quantities of books from house to house. In Cork Barry worked as a freelance journalist, contributing a regular column to the Irish Examiner. Keen to become a writer, he purchased a caravan and parked it in a field in West Cork, spending the next six months writing what he described as a \\"terrible novel'. Barry has described himself as \\"a raving egomaniac\\", one of those \\"monstrous creatures who are composed 99 per cent of sheer, unadulterated ego\\" and \\"hugely insecure and desperate to be loved and I want my reader to adore me, to a disturbing, stalkerish degree.\\" He is highly ambitious, saying: \\"I won't be happy until I'm up there, receiving the Nobel Prize.\\" He confessed to \\"haunting bookshops and hiding\\" to \\"spy on the short fiction section and see if anyone's tempted by my sweet bait\\" and has also placed copies of his own work in front of books by other \\"upcoming\\" authors. In 2007 he won the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature for his short story collection There are Little Kingdoms. In 2011 he released his debut novel City of Bohane, which was followed in 2012 by the short story collection Dark Lies the Island. Barry won the International Dublin Literary Award for his novel City of Bohane in 2013. When City of Bohane was shortlisted for the award in April 2013, Barry said: \\"Anything that keeps a book in the spotlight, and keeps people talking about books is good. [...] And a prize with money attached to it has a lot of prestige.\\" He received €100,000 for winning the award. The prize jury included Salim Bachi, Krista Kaer, Patrick McCabe, Kamila Shamsee, Clive Sinclair and Eugene R. Sullivan. Lord Mayor of Dublin Naoise Ó Muirí said he was \\"thrilled\\" that someone of \\"such immense talent [should] take home this year's award\\". Ó Muirí also said the characters were \\"flamboyant and malevolent, speaking in a vernacular like no other.\\" In November, 2015 Beatlebone won the £10,000 Goldsmith’s Prize that aims to reward British and Irish fiction that breaks the mould or extends the possibilities of the novel form.Gatti, Tom (11 November 2015) Kevin Barry wins the Goldsmiths Prize 2015 for his novel Beatlebone New Statesman The Gazette described him as: \\"If Roddy Doyle and Nick Cave could procreate, the result would be something like Kevin Barry.\\" Barry was the Ireland Fund Artist-in- Residence in the Celtic Studies Department of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto in October 2010. ==BibliographyNovels=== * City of Bohane (2011) * Beatlebone (2015) * Night Boat to Tangier (2019) === Short fiction === ;Collections * There are Little Kingdoms (2007) * Dark Lies the Island (2012) * That Old Country Music (2020) ;StoriesShort stories unless otherwise noted. {class=' sortable' width='90%' - !width=25%Title !Year !First published !Reprinted/collected !Notes - Deer Season 2016    - The Coast of Leitrim 2018   } ==Awards and honours== * 2007: Rooney Prize for Irish Literature (There are Little Kingdoms) * 2011: Costa Book Award, shortlist (City of Bohane) * 2012: The Sunday Times EFG Private Bank Short Story Award (Beer Trip to Llandudno) * 2012: Authors' Club First Novel Award (City of Bohane) * 2013: International Dublin Literary Award (City of Bohane) * 2013: Edge Hill University Short Story Prize (Dark Lies the Island)http://www.edgehill.ac.uk/news/2013/07/irish-author-kevin-barry-wins- edge-hill-prize-2013 * 2015: Goldsmiths Prize (Beatlebone) ==References * Book review of There are Little Kingdoms * Review of City of Bohane * Review of Dark Lies the Island * review of Dark Lies the Island, New York Journal of Books * Short biography from the Berlin International Literature Festival Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:21st- century Irish novelists Category:21st-century Irish male writers Category:21st-century Irish short story writers Category:Irish male novelists Category:Irish male short story writers Category:People from Limerick (city) Category:The New Yorker people Category:Goldsmiths Prize winners ","title":"Kevin Barry (author)"},{"id":"20365240","text":"Major-General Robert Harley Wordsworth CB, CBE (21 July 1894 – 22 November 1984) was a British Indian Army officer and an Australian politician. ==Military career== Born in Collarenebri, New South Wales, Wordsworth was educated at North Sydney Grammar School.

He was initially elected to parliament as a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). He joined the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) after the party split of 1955, which became the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). He served as the DLP's parliamentary leader until losing his seat at the 1964 election. ==Early life== Cole was born on 9 February 1908 in Don, Tasmania, one of five children born to Alice (née Rutter) and George Cole. He was educated at Devonport High School and later studied at the University of Tasmania and Hobart Teachers' College. He was raised in his mother's Methodist faith but later converted to Catholicism. Cole played for the New Town Football Club in the Tasmanian Australian National Football League as a centreman. He won the Wilson Bailey Medal as the league's best and fairest player in 1928 and represented Tasmania at the 1930 National Carnival. His football earnings helped his family survive the Great Depression. In 1932, Cole was appointed head teacher at Upper Mountain River, a rural locality. In the same year, he married Kathleen Cuttriss. He was an assistant teacher at West Devonport from 1938 until 1941, when he was called up to the Australian Army; he had previously been a member of the Citizen Military Forces. Cole served as an instructor in the north of Australia with the 30th Australian Infantry Training Battalion. He was discharged in 1944 and returned to teaching. He served as headmaster of primary schools in Strahan, Longford, and Latrobe. ==PoliticsAustralian Labor Party=== Cole was the president of the Latrobe branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). He was elected to the Senate at the 1949 federal election, which saw the number of senators in each state increased from six to ten. He was the seventh senator elected in Tasmania. Cole's first speech in the Senate outlined his opposition to communism, which he described as a \\"pernicious doctrine\\" based on the denial of God. However, he believed the Menzies Government's Communist Party Dissolution Bill was likely to be ineffective, as it would force communists underground. Cole served on the ALP Federal Executive in 1952 and 1953. He allied himself with the anti-communist Groupers and formed the belief that the party's federal leader H. V. Evatt was a communist fellow traveller. In October 1954, he moved for a leadership spill, believing that Arthur Calwell had sufficient numbers to win a challenge. However, the motion was defeated by 24 votes, and Evatt retained the leadership. He was the only Tasmanian to vote for the motion. ===Democratic Labor Party=== As a result of the party split of 1955, Cole resigned from the ALP on 16 August 1955. On 24 August, he announced in the Senate the formation of the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist), with himself and seven lower- house MPs as the parliamentary party. This became the Democratic Labor Party in 1957. The party's members in the House of Representatives were all defeated at the 1955 federal election, where Cole was not up for re-election. He was joined by Frank McManus in the Senate and on 8 May 1956 announced himself as the party's parliamentary leader, with McManus as deputy. They were joined by Condon Byrne of Queensland the following year. Cole was re-elected to the Senate for the DLP at the 1958 federal election with 17 percent of the vote in Tasmania. Cole was defeated at the 1964 Senate election, losing to Bert Lacey of the ALP by a narrow margin. He unsuccessfully petitioned the Court of Disputed Returns to overturn the result, but Judge Alan Taylor upheld the election of Lacey. He remained the DLP's parliamentary leader until his term expired in June 1965, and campaigned for the party in that capacity at the May 1965 New South Wales state election. ==Later life== Cole remained state president of the DLP in Tasmania until June 1968. He died of chronic kidney disease on 23 January 1969, aged 60. ==References== Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Methodism Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Democratic Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Tasmania Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Glenorchy Football Club players Category:1908 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Australian schoolteachers Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Leaders of political parties in Australia Category:Australian military personnel of World War II ","title":"George Cole (Tasmanian politician)"},{"id":"20365313","text":"Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) is part of the NIH Intramural Research Program and is located in Hamilton, Montana.

The Shield), was a Jewish defense organization in Ottoman Palestine, founded by Yosef Lishansky in summer 1915. It guarded villages in the northern Negev and disbanded in summer 1917, following Lishansky's departure to Nili. ==Background and founding== At the time of HaMagen's founding, HaShomer was the only all-Jewish defense organization in Ottoman Palestine. Due to the high price, and the elitistGoldstein, Jacob (1998). From Fighters to Soldiers, \\"From Bar Giora to HaShomer\\", p. 37 and idealisticGoldstein, Jacob (1998). From Fighters to Soldiers, \\"HaShomer and the Yishuv\\", pp. 58–59 policies of HaShomer, most Jewish towns and villages were guarded by Arabs. An attempt was made in 1912 to create a rival organization, HaNoter, but it lasted only one year. HaMagen was created in summer 1915, and Yosef Lishansky, who was rejected from HaShomer,Ben-Yehuda, Nachman (1993), pp. 129–131 became its leader. According to HaMagen's David Tsalevich, some of the organization's members were disgruntled HaShomer would-be inductees, who were not accepted despite extensive trial periods.Goldstein, Jacob (1998). From Fighters to Soldiers, \\"Notes\\", pp. 247–248 Ben-Zion Mashevich and David Tsalevich were members of both HaShomer and HaMagen, but denied any connections with the latter. The organization consisted of about 20 members, including men from Poale Zion. The Judea Workers' Union provided further manpower during the organization's early period. ==Activities== After negotiations, HaMagen was selected to guard four southern villages: Ruhama, Gedera, Be'er Tuvia, and Ekron (today Mazkeret Batya). ==Difficulties and decline== Although HaMagen was accused of benefitting from the gold transferred from the British to the Nili, the economic situation of most of the guardsmen (except in Ekron) was dire. They usually guarded barefoot and passed around a single pair of shoes when it was required. Food was provided by the local farmers, who took the Magen members in turn for a month each. HaShomer, the well-established Jewish defense organization at the time, did not attempt to shut down HaMagen when it was founded, because they did not work in the same areas. However, tensions rose when HaShomer failed to take over the guarding of Gedera from HaMagen in 1916. As soon as HaShomer returned to operate in the southern town Rehovot, they officially asked the Judea Workers' Union to boycott HaMagen. The request was presided over by Levi Eshkol and Avraham Herzfeld, and denied on the grounds that HaMagen's own regulations forbade competition with HaShomer. After Lishansky joined Nili, he was forced to neglect HaMagen, until finally rumors of his involvement in Nili caused the organization to disband. The Judea Workers' Union's later stance towards the organization contributed to its decline—the union did not boycott HaMagen, but discontinued supporting it with manpower, and following HaShomer's appeals, agreed not to help HaMagen acquire guarding positions in more villages. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Jews and Judaism in Ottoman Palestine ","title":"HaMagen"},{"id":"20365389","text":"The first season of Prison Break, an American serial drama television series, commenced airing in the United States and Canada on August 29, 2005 on Mondays at 9:00 p.m. (EST) on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Prison Break is produced by Adelstein-Parouse Productions, in association with Rat Entertainment, Original Film and 20th Century Fox Television. The season contains 22 episodes, and concluded on May 15, 2006. In addition to the 22 regular episodes, a special, \\"Behind the Walls\\", was aired on October 11, 2005. Prison Break revolves around two brothers: Lincoln Burrows, who has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit and his younger brother Michael Scofield, a genius who devises an elaborate plan to help him escape prison by purposely getting himself imprisoned. A total of ten actors received star billing in the first season, with numerous supporting roles. Filming took place mostly in and around the Chicago area; Fox River was represented by Joliet Prison, which had closed in 2002. Critical reviews of the first season were generally favorable. The first season was released on DVD in Region One as a six-disc boxed set under the title of Prison Break: Season One on August 8, 2006. ==CastMain characters=== * Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows * Wentworth Miller as Michael Scofield * Robin Tunney as Veronica Donovan * Peter Stormare as John Abruzzi * Amaury Nolasco as Fernando Sucre * Marshall Allman as L.J.

The executive producers were creator Paul Scheuring, Marty Adelstein, Neal H. Moritz, Dawn Parouse, Brett Ratner and Matt Olmstead. The staff writers were Scheuring, co-executive producers Nick Santora and Zack Estrin, supervising producer Karyn Usher and Olmstead. The regular director throughout the season was Bobby Roth; additional directors were Jace Alexander, Matt Earl Beesley and Dwight H. Little. Its incidental music was composed by Ramin Djawadi. ===Filming=== Most of the first season of the series was filmed on location in and around Chicago.Ryan, Maureen, \\"Joliet prison is a 'Break'-out star\\", The Chicago Tribune. August 24, 2005. Retrieved on December 5, 2005.\\"Inside Prison Break: Chain male\\" Sydney Morning Herald. February 1, 2006. Retrieved on October 10, 2006. After it was closed down in 2002, Joliet Prison became the set of Prison Break in 2005, standing in as Fox River State Penitentiary on screen. Scenes set in Lincoln's cell, the infirmary and the prison yard were all shot on location at the prison.Set Visit: Prison Break IGN. March 17, 2006. Retrieved on September 14, 2006. Lincoln's cell is the same one in which John Wayne Gacy was incarcerated. Most of the production crew refused to enter the cell, thinking that it was haunted. Other sets were built at the prison, including the cell blocks that housed the general prison population; these blocks had three tiers of cells (as opposed to the real cell block's two) and had cells much larger than real cells to allow more space for the actors and cameras. Exterior scenes were filmed in areas around Chicago, Woodstock, and Joliet in Illinois. Other locations included O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Toronto, Ontario in Canada. Prison Break spent $2 million per episode in the state of Illinois, which cost them a total of $24 million in 2005. ==ReleaseCritical reception=== Metacritic gave the season a Metascore—a weighted average based on the impressions of a select 32 critical reviews—of 65, signifying generally favorable reviews. Based on its strong opening, The New York Times dubbed Prison Break \\"more intriguing than most of the new network series, and ... one of the most original\\" and a \\"suspenseful thriller\\", complimenting its \\"authentic look\\". Entertainment Weekly called it an \\"original drama\\", noting the show's \\"edge-of-the-seat action\\". On the other hand, however, The Washington Post criticized the show for its \\"somber pretentiousness\\" and \\"uniformly overwrought [performances]\\". ===Ratings=== The two-hour pilot episode garnered approximately 10.5 million viewers, giving Fox its \\"best summertime Monday numbers since episodes of Melrose Place and Ally McBeal aired there in September 1998.\\" The show's first season attracted an average audience of 10 million viewers each week, with \\"End of the Tunnel\\" reaching 12 million viewers, and led the debuts of television in the 2005 American fall season. Prison Break was originally planned for a 13-episode run, but was extended to include an extra nine episodes due to its popularity. ==Home media release== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 0 1em 0 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border- collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - AFC0CF\\"  colspan=\\"6\\"  Prison Break: The Complete First Season -valign=\\"top\\"  align=\\"center\\" width=\\"400\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Set details  width=\\"400\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"3\\"Special features -valign=\\"top\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\" * 22 episodes * 6-disc set * 1.78:1 aspect ratio * Subtitles: English, Spanish, French * English (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround) ; Audio commentaries * \\"Pilot\\" * \\"Cute Poison\\" * \\"Riots, Drills and the Devil, Part 1\\" * \\"Riots, Drills and the Devil, Part 2\\" * \\"Odd Man Out\\" * \\"Brother's Keeper\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\" width=\\"400\\" *Deleted scenes *The Making of Prison Break *If These Walls Could Speak: Profile of the Joliet Correctional Center featurette *Beyond the Ink tattoo featurette *Fox Movie Channel Presents Making a Scene *TV Spots -  colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\"  Release dates -  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"  -  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"  August 8, 2006  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"  September 18, 2006  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"  September 12, 2006 } ==ReferencesCategory:2005 American television seasons Category:2006 American television seasons Category:Prison Break episodes Category:Prison Break ","title":"Prison Break (season 1)"},{"id":"20365393","text":"The 2008 Rugby League World Cup final was the championship-deciding game of the 2008 Rugby League World Cup tournament.

During the haka the Australian team advanced towards the New Zealand team so that they were standing face to face.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D3gzlOZdeI * 1st Minute: Australia kicked off to New Zealand who had the first set of six. * 5th Minute: Benji Marshall almost opened the scoring for New Zealand after he ran on to a Nathan Fien grubber. However, he knocked the ball on upon further inspection and the video referee, Steve Ganson ruled no-try. * 11th Minute: New Zealand's good start to the game came to nothing when Billy Slater received the ball on the 40 metre line. He was able to cut through two defenders and run 30 metres before getting a ball away to Darren Lockyer who scored. Johnathan Thurston then missed the conversion. Australia 4-0 New Zealand * 15th Minute: David Williams raced down the right hand touchline to score. Thurston kicked the conversion. Australia 10-0 New Zealand * 20th Minute: Australia had the chance to effectively put the game out of reach when Darren Lockyer looked to have got on the end of a Cameron Smith grubber kick. Yet, when referee Ashley Klein went to the video referee it was clear that Lockyer had not grounded the ball and the try was not awarded. * 24th Minute: Jeremy Smith went on a barnstorming run from ten metres out to score under the posts. Isaac Luke added the conversion and New Zealand were now back in the game. Australia 10-6 New Zealand * 28th Minute: Benji Marshall looked to have lost the ball before David Fa'alogo was able to run away and put Jerome Ropati in to score. However, upon inspection from the video referee the ball was stripped out of Marshall's hands. Therefore, the try stood and, when Luke added the conversion, New Zealand were in the lead for the first time in the match. Australia 10-12 New Zealand * 35th Minute: Multiple passes between the Australian players and Lockyer eventually finds room to go over and score. The conversion was added and Australia were back in the lead. Australia 16-12 New Zealand * 40th Minute: The halftime siren sounded. New Zealand had surprised many by keeping the score close but many would have believed that Australia would have run away with the game in the second half. At halftime Justin Morgan said on the BBC \\"It has been a great display from both teams in the first half. The Kiwis have been a little unlucky but they are still in the game and I would like to see them put the ball in the air more in the second half and see if they can get some results.\\" * 41 Mins: New Zealand winger Manu Vatuvei is ruled to have put his shoulder on the corner flag as he was going into score a try. Therefore, the try was ruled out. * 47 Mins: Lance Hohaia receives the ball after New Zealand received a penalty and stepped past Lockyer before scoring in the tackle. The conversion was added and New Zealand re-took the lead. Australia 16-18 New Zealand * 58 Mins: Israel Folau is held up over the line after picking up a bouncing ball. * 59 Mins: Lance Hohaia is bundled towards the New Zealand in-goal after Klein had already called held. Therefore, New Zealand are awarded a penalty under their own goal posts. * 60 Mins: On the fourth play, Marshall kicked the ball, Slater gathered it in but, under pressure from Manu Vatuvei, threw the ball in field where Marshall picked the ball up and scored out wide. The kick was unconverted. Australia 16-22 New Zealand * 64 Mins: Australia hit back through a try from Greg Inglis in the corner, Thurston, however, could not add the conversion and New Zealand remained in the lead. Australia 20-22 New ZealandThe Kiwis celebrating after their victory. * 70 Mins: Nathan Fien grubber kicked the ball through on the last tackle. Lance Hohaia, who was marginally on side ran through to try to catch the ball. The ball bounced awkwardly above the head of the Australian defender Joel Monaghan who could only react by putting out a swinging arm. The ball was then taken by Slater who was tackled in the in goal. After several looks from the video referee it was decided that Hohaia probably would have scored had he not been tackled so a penalty try was awarded. The conversion which would be taken from right under the posts was kicked and New Zealand had an 8-point lead. Australia 20-28 New Zealand * 72 Mins With the Australians desperate to score Thurston make a line break but with an open line in front of him is ankle tapped by Jeremy Smith and Thurston knocked on. Time was now running out for Australia. * 75 Mins Fien kicks for the corner but the ball came loose before Adam Blair eventually picked up and scored. After some looks at the video it was clear that it was a fair try. The conversion was added and New Zealand had effectively won the world cup. * 80 Mins The siren for full- time went and the New Zealand players started celebrating. Australia 20-34 New Zealand The game was the Australian team's first loss since Great Britain defeated them in November 2006 and their first loss to New Zealand since November 2005. It was also their first loss in a World Cup match since 1995 and in a final since 1972. 1.2 million Australians watched the game live on television.http://blogs.sunherald.com.au/whoweare/archives/2008/11/the_who_we_are_18.html ==Aftermath== Hundreds of New Zealanders welcomed the team home at Auckland Airport. Ricky Stuart, coach of the Australian team, was reported to be so incensed by his team's defeat in the final that he verbally attacked Geoff Carr, the Chief Executive of Australian Rugby League, claiming that tournament organisers and match officials conspired to cause the Australian loss. The next morning he had a chance meeting with Ashley Klein, who refereed the final, and Stuart Cummings, the Rugby Football League's director of match officials, at their hotel. He reportedly abused both officials in front of a number of witnesses, calling Klein a cheat, and behaved in an aggressive and physically intimidating manner. Stuart later apologised for his behaviour and resigned from his post.

The company was founded in 1975 and is now a division of Iron Wind Metals, LLC, a company created in 2001 around Ral Partha's manufacturing capacities. The company's products are made by spin-casting metal alloys which depict soldiers, adventurers and creatures that have been inspired by history and fiction. Their miniatures are sold at gaming conventions, in hobby shops, and by internet and mail order for use in role playing games, wargaming, dioramas, competitive painting, and collecting. The company began as a basement enterprise undertaken by a group of wargamers around the talents of Tom Meier, a 16-year-old sculptor. The company grew with the increasing popularity of board and role-playing games. By 1982 Ral Partha products were sold worldwide.\\"Hanging Out: Warriors & Wizards\\" by Perry Cooper, Cincinnati Best and Worst magazine, Volume 16, Number 1, October 1982 pp. 18–25. Ral Partha is best known for its historical figures, Fantasy Collector's series, and miniatures produced for TSR, Inc.'s Advanced Dungeons & Dragons and FASA's BattleTech games. Tom Meier became a freelance sculptor in 1988, and retains copyrights to much of his work for Ral Partha. He works on commission and operates Thunderbolt Mountain Miniatures, a boutique company for pet projects involving dioramas, 54 mm figurines, and a new series of elves and goblins. During its 40-year history Ral Partha has employed more than two dozen sculptors, of whom the most prolific were Dennis Mize, Julie Guthrie, Sandra Garrity, Robert N. Charrette, and Dave Summers. The owners of the original Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. sold the company to FASA in 1998, and was one of the assets acquired by WizKids in 2000. The following year Ral Partha's production assets were recast as Iron Wind Metals, LLC of Cincinnati, a company which continues to produce many of the Ral Partha lines of miniatures. In 2015 and the 40th anniversary of the founding of Ral Partha, Iron Wind Metals reacquired the long unused trademarks and relaunched Ral Partha as a division of the company focused on producing archived miniature lines under the banner of the Chaos Wars gaming world. ==Licensees and distributors United States === In 1980 Ral Partha licensed select designs to Rawcliffe Pewter a long-time producer of cast metal art. The pewter versions of Ral Partha sculpts were typically bare-metal with a satin finish and decorated with glass jewels. In time, a division of the company called Partha Pewter was established to produce directly for the giftware market. === Canada === Ral Partha established a licensing agreement with RAFM, a miniatures manufacturer in Paris, Ontario, Canada in 1980.Ral Partha Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #36, April 1980. The two companies have had a long-term working relationship which lasted well into the 1990s. === Great Britain === In 1979 Citadel Miniatures was formed by Games Workshop as a miniatures production shop to produce their own figures and to distribute Ral Partha figures in Britain.White Dwarf Magazine #11, February/March 1979.Citadel Compendium 1, Games Workshop 1984 Citadel Miniatures attempted to establish a U.S. division in 1982 with Ral Partha as the local manufacturer.Citadel Miniatures U.S. 1983 Catalog.

Historical lines included Romans AR-xx, Dark Ages DA-xx, Medievals M-xxx and Samurai SAM-xx.

Some early Ral Partha advertisements erroneously give the name as \\"Jeaux Descartes.\\" The relationship was on-going in 1997,Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1997 Catalog. but was probably severed when FASA purchased Ral Partha the following year. === Australia === In the 1980s and 1990s, Ral Partha products were distributed in Australia by Military Simulations of Moorabbin, Victoria and then Bentleigh, Victoria. ==Product codes== Only a product code marked Ral Partha's early packaging and customers required a contemporary catalog in order to identify the miniature. In late 1979 the company switched from product codes that used descriptive letter and number codes to a numeric system. For example, in the series Personalities and Things that Go Bump in the Night, ES-001 Evil Wizard, casting spell became 01-001, and the first figure of the 15th century Renaissance series 1501 Command Set became 54-001.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1978 Catalog.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1979 Catalog.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1980 Catalog.

Ral Partha's international partners used their own systems. RAFM of Canada used the descriptive product codes as late as 1984.RAFM advertisement in Dragon Magazine #90, October 1984. Jeux Descartes initially used Ral Partha's numeric codes on packaging of their own design, but new lines were introduced selectively and given codes sequential to their own series. As a result, product codes often differ depending on whether the miniatures were produced in the United States, Canada, or Europe. Throughout the company's history, figures were modified to improve reproducibility, unpopular designs were re-sculpted, and existing product codes were used for new designs. A common cause of modification was a level of detail or animation which challenged the casting technology. An industry-wide reorientation of scale from 25 mm to 30 mm in the late 1990s, and interest in removing artist's royalties from lines, also prompted new sculpts of existing lines. Few of Ral Partha's miniatures were marked with product codes and the company's advertisements and catalogs remain a critical resource for collectors. Advertisements by Ral Partha and its British and Canadian partners appear in most editions of TSR, Inc.'s Dragon and Games Workshop's White Dwarf magazines. Product catalogs were published annually from 1978 to 1997, and in 2000. The 1998 and 1999 catalogs were combined into a single issue. Ral Partha also released Christmas catalogs in 1982 and 1983, an Imports catalog in 1984, historical miniatures catalogs in 1985 and 1996, a 2000 Direct Mail Catalog, and sporadically released updated order forms which listed all the figures in production. In the late 1996 Ral Partha augmented their catalogs with a webpage which highlighted popular products and new releases. After the formation of Iron Wind Metals in 2001, an online catalog and electronic order forms entirely replaced printed catalogs. ==Company history== Ral Partha Enterprises was formed in 1975 when Glenn E. Kidd, Tom Meier and Rich Smethurst set out to produce Meier's sculptures. Meier pioneered the sculpture of miniatures in a two-part epoxy putty designed for automotive repair., Tom Meier Biography by Carin Meier, Accessed November 23, 2008 The epoxy held detail better than traditional media and rest of the miniature industry adopted its use. When mixed together, the blue and yellow components of the putty formed a green putty which gave rise to the term \\"Greens\\" for the original artist's work. Finding themselves still short of funds, the three enlisted Marc Rubin, Chuck Crain, and Jack Hesselbrock as partners.The Courier Volume 1, No. 4, December 1980, \\"The Courier Interviews Glenn Kidd,\\" by Dick Bryant, editor. The six investors pooled USD $3,000 to purchase the equipment necessary to produce Meier's sculptures. The company had its origins in the established hobby of historical wargaming, but the company's rapid growth was fostered by the popularity of role-playing games. The company was named Ral- Partha after a particularly successful wizard character created by Tom's young friend John Winkler. The character was a notoriously hard bargainer whose shrewdness was exemplified by the catch phrase \\"What's it worth to you?\\" It was hoped that the fledgling company would have similar good fortune.Cincinnati Magazine Best Buys - Choose Your Demons by Jani Gardener May 1978 pages 58-59. Like their popular line of \\"3-stage characters,\\" Ral Partha has had a trio of aspects. The first was Winkler's gaming character, depicted as ES-001 Evil Wizard, casting spell. \\"Ral\\" Winkler himself became one of the company's chief casters. Lastly, \\"Ral\\" was the company's totemic progenitor credited with collaborative projects and depicted as 10–412 Lord of the Balrogs.Ral Partha Gaming Club Newsletter Issue #1 June 30, 1996.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1986 Catalog. Products were originally cast in the basement of 3642 Hyde Park Avenue, in the Fairfax neighborhood of Cincinnati, the home of the company's first president, Glenn E. Kidd.Ral Partha Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #4, March 1977. In the spring of 1978, the company established a factory at 3726 Lonsdale Street in the Norwood section of Cincinnati.Ral Partha Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #16, July 1978. At the time of the move, the address was erroneously rendered as 2732 and 2736 Lonsdale, but there is no 2700 block of that street. Small stickers were applied to the 1978 product catalog to correct the address. Those stickers have typically fallen off in the intervening years. By November 1980 Ral Partha moved to a larger industrial space at 5938 Carthage Court, where it, and the Iron Wind Metals production facilities remained until 2014.Ral Partha Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #43, November 1980.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 2000 Catalog. Iron Wind Metals has its offices and production facilities at 10437 Chester Rd in Woodlawn, Ohio. Ral Partha's formative years were the late 1970s, when the company was a part-time basement enterprise producing the art of a teenage sculptor for a nascent gaming market. In 1979, the company became a full-time endeavor with industrial space and two professional sculptors designing products for multiple themes made popular by the rapidly expanding gaming market. The number of sculptors and catalog of miniatures grew rapidly. In the mid-1980s, the preponderance of work moved from Ral Partha's sculptors' designs to manufacturing under license for nationally marketed games. In the short run, the move was economically beneficial. However, the lack of product diversity left the company vulnerable to the marketing decisions of clients for whom miniatures were a minor interest. Between 2001 and 2014, Ral Partha was an unused trademark caught up in the mergers and intellectual property negotiations between large game producers. Since 2001 the focus of Iron Wind Metals has been on existing product lines, Battletech licensed figures, and manufacturing for partner companies who carryout their own designs, marketing and distribution. In 2014 the production and productive capacities were reunited under Ral Partha Enterprises, a division of Iron Wind Metals. ===Basement enterprise, 1975–1978=== The young company received early encouragement from the sale of its entire stock at Gen Con 1976, a convention of gaming enthusiasts. Ral Partha's lines and customer base grew quickly and they regularly won multiple categories of the Origins Award., Origins Game Fair, Accessed November 24, 2008. Ral Partha's figures were popular with historical wargamers, but fans of fantasy themed role-playing games like TSR, Inc.'s Dungeons & Dragons accounted for the majority of their sales., Tom Meier Autobiography, Accessed November 23, 2008. Meier's sculpts tended to carry greater detail than many of his contemporaries, but some early products presented challenges to the casting process.Wargaming World, Dragon Magazine #3, October 1976 One of Tom Meier's earliest lines was the Fantasy Line, which included about two dozen figures in late 1976. Meier's ES18 Adventuress is credited as being the first female character for role-playing games.From the Fantasy Forge, Dragon Magazine #8, July 1977. The fantasy line was renamed ES/01-xxx Personalities and Things that Go Bump in the Night in 1978, and Meier augmented the line throughout the 1980s.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1987 Catalog.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1982 Catalog.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1983 Catalog.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1984 Catalog.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1985 Fantasy Catalog. As early as 1976, Meier had begun a series of soldiers from Classical antiquity which were collected together as AN/35-xxx The Hoplites.Ral Partha Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #11, December 1977. By 1978 the line was essentially complete and included Greeks, Carthaginians, Persians, Gauls, Early Republic Romans and Macedonians. Another series begun by Meier in 1976 was a line of 11th-century knights and footmen called 11/42-xxx 1200 A.D.. The series included Vikings, English, French, Spanish, Moorish, Mongol, and Sung Chinese soldiers. Ral Partha put E-xxx Wizards, Warriors and Warlocks into production in 1976, 1977, and 1979. The line included some of Meier's earliest work and much of it was executed in the style of Heritage Models, for whom he had briefly worked., Tom Meier on Thunderbolt Mountain Miniatures Forums, December 3, 2008. The E-xxx series was retired in 1980, but portions of it were re-released in 1995 as part of the 19-xxx Ral Partha Remembered line commemorating the company's 20th anniversary. In 1978 Ral Partha acquired The Old Guard's Legions of the Petal Throne line of figures for TSR, Inc.'s Empire of the Petal Throne, a role- playing game based on M. A. R. Barker's world of Tékumel. Ral Partha retained the services of William Murray, the line's sculptor. Tom Meier and Brian Apple made contributions to the series (T, Y, P, M, NH-xxx) in 1979, but it was discontinued later that year. As early as 1978, Ral Partha produced three series of 15 mm historical miniatures sculpted by George Freeman of Dayton, Ohio. They included Napoleonic-era figures N-xxx Days of the Empire, AW-xxx American Civil War, and AK-xxx Desert Rats, modeling the North African Campaign of World War II. Ann Gallup also contributed an AC-xxx series to the American Civil War line. In 1979 Ral Partha added Freeman's 25 mm W-xxx Waterloo Collector's Series, but all of Freeman and Gallup's figures were discontinued in 1980. George Freeman's 15mm Napoleonics figures are available from Monday Knight Productions (see external links below). Ral Partha's first venture into science fiction was Meier's 1978 line of space marines and space aliens GG-xxx Galactic Grenadiers: Strike Force Alpha. Their release was in tandem with Gamescience's Strike Team Alpha, a set designed by Michael Scott Kurtick for Meier's Galactic Grenadiers., Strike Team Alpha, Board Game Geek. Accessed December 22, 2008.Games Workshop Advertisement, White Dwarf Magazine #13, June/July 1979. Other early lines included collectible 54 mm figures called S/97-xxx Partha Personalities and lines of 25 mm dungeon accessories (D/97-xxx) and weapons (D/97-5xx). ===Producer of signature lines, 1979–1986=== In the summer of 1978, Meier began reworking the themes of the E-xxx series to create the CS/02-xxx Fantasy Collectors line of elves.Ral Partha Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #19, October 1978. Meier's lines were successful and he began sculpting full-time in 1979. The addition of dwarves in 1979 and goblins in 1980 almost entirely replaced the E-xxx series. Meier added halfings in 1982 and began a series of fantasy vehicles. The first was 02–030 Dwarf Steam Cannon, released in 1983. Meier's contribution to the series was completed when 02-078 The Warmachine and 02-020 The Elf Chariot were put into production in 1984. Ral Partha hired Dennis Mize in 1979. With two full-time sculptors, Ral Partha's product lines increased rapidly. Mize's first project was H-xxx Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age to accompany a Fantasy Games Unlimited game of the same name, based on the world of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. The Hyborean line was dropped in 1980, and Mize introduced 53-7xx The Samurai and a line of 15mm fantasy soldiers called 05-xxx Armies of Myth and Legend. His popular CN/13-xxx Children of the Night was begun by 1982 and expanded over the course of the next two years. In 1982 Mize and Meier created figures for small thematic box sets called 98-xxx The Adventurers.Ral Partha Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #49, May 1981. Mize also added to and revised Meier's The Hoplites and 1200 A.D. lines in 1984. In 1979, Meier introduced 15/54-xxx Condotitieri, a line of Renaissance-era figures. The first offerings were Imperialists, to which he added Swiss and Turks in 1980. Meier expanded the historical ranges with the 1983 addition of 88-xxx The Colonials. Sculpts for the Anglo-Zulu War were augmented in 1984 with figures for the Northwest Frontier and the Sudan Campaign in 1985.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1985 Historical Catalog. Ral Partha entered the game market in 1980 with the release of 99–001 Witch's Caldron, 99-002 Caverns Deep, 99-003 Final Frontier, and 99-004 Galactic Grenadiers, skirmish games designed by Glenn E. Kidd and Marc Rubin. \\"Galactic Grenadiers\\" included miniatures from the GG-xxx series. 15 mm figures from Final Frontiers were released in 1982 as 08-xxx Star Warriors. By 1982, the presidency of the company passed from Glenn E. Kidd to Jack Hesselbrock. The lines of 15 mm fantasy figures were taken out of production and the figures from the Caverns Deep and Witch's Cauldron games were incorporated into 98-xxx The Adventurers in 1983. Ral Partha returned to the board game market in 1985 when they joined with Leggett Games Inc. to publish Fortress, a skirmish-based board game which incorporated lead Ral Partha miniatures., Fortress, at Board Game Geek. That same year the company launched 77-xxx Partha Paints and Dragonscale metallic cremes which were packaged with dragon figures. In the spring of 1983 Ral Partha began publishing a four-page newsletter entitled The Partha Pipeline which was a house fanzine with articles generated by staff and friends. A typical issue included \\"Letters to Ral\\" where the company's semi-mythical progenitor would answer reader's questions, scenarios for battles with Ral Partha figures, and new releases by Ral Partha and those which they distributed for RAFM.The Partha Pipeline, Ral Partha Enterprises, First Series, Volume 1, Number 3, Fall 1983. The Partha Pipeline continued for three more years until ending its first series in 1986. A second series using the same name would be revived in 1999. Julie Guthrie began freelance sculpting for Ral Partha in 1983. Her first line was the 02-9xx All Things Dark and Dangerous. She worked with Meier and Mize on 98-xxx The Adventurers. Later that year, box sets of 10-3xx The Best of Ral Partha and Julie Guthrie's 96-xxx Elfquest figures for Chasosium's Elfquest game were put into production.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1983 Christmas Catalog. Guthrie expanded the All Things Dark and Dangerous line in 1984, 1985, and 1986. In 1984 she joined Meier and Mize to develop a short series of miniatures (95-xxx) for Nova Games' Lost Worlds series of combat books. In 1985 Guthrie contributed two sculpts of unicorns to PO-3xx Once Upon a Time series designed for the giftware market, cast in lead-free alloy, and marketed as \\"Partha Pewter\\" by Rawcliffe Pewter.Ral Partha Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #93, January 1985. Their work with pewter allowed Ral Partha's mold-makers to develop the technical expertise necessary to transition to non-lead alloys in the early 1990s. Robert N. Charrette joined Ral Partha in 1984 and contributed to Meier's The Hoplites, 1200 A.D., and CS/02-xxx Collector Series lines. In 1985, Charrette inaugurated figures for Chaosium's RuneQuest and a line of pulp adventurers. The line was initially called \\"20th Century Plus\\", but was later renamed 20-xxx The Roaring Twenties. Charrette revisited a line of figures he sculpted in 1979 to accompany Fantasy Games Unlimited's Gangster!.Report on Origins '79, Dragon Magazine #29, September 1979., Mirror of FGU website, Accessed December 17, 2008Molten Magic in White Dwarf #14, August/September 1979 Charrette updated the line to include new cinematic themes such as the intrepid archaeologist. In 1986 Charrette introduced 53-9xx Bushido, a line of miniatures for Bushido, a game he authored and sculpted a line of figures for Fantasy Games Unlimited., Bob Charrette Games, Accessed November 23, 2008. In 1985, Bob Charrette began producing a line of miniature robot war machines for a game that was first called \\"Battledroids\\" and renamed BattleTech in 1986, for FASA's game of the same name. It was the beginning of a permanent relationship between the two companies that would eventually lead to Ral Partha's sale to FASA. Battletech products remain a leading product of Ral Partha's successor, Iron Wind Metals and Charrette continued on as creative development and authored several related novels. In 1986 Ral Partha sculptors crafted 01-3xx 3-Stage Characters which consisted of three aspects with increasing amounts of arms and armor to represent a single adventurer's game career. The line was folded into the ES/01-xxx line in 1987. Because of their popularity with collectors and role-players, they regained status as a separate line and a place of prominence in the 1991 and subsequent catalogs. ===Chaos Wars, 1986–1987=== At the same time that integrated campaign worlds like Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy Battle were showing early success, Ral Partha introduced the \\"Chaos Wars\\" theme into their 1986 and 1987 product lines. It was the first step toward unifying a collection of disparate themes into an integrated brand. In the 1986 catalog sculptors were no longer credited and a mythical \\"Ral Partha\\" rather than the president of the company addressed customers in the prologue. At about that same time, the Ral Partha staff had developed a four-page Rules According to Ral for medieval battles. A fantasy version by Bob Charrette, Rich Smethhurst, Marc Rubin, and Chuck Crain was released in 1987 as part of a boxed set Rules According to Ral: Chaos Wars., Board Game Geek, Ral Partha Games, Accessed November 24, 2008., TMP: Chaos Wars, Accessed November 23, 2008. The Chaos Wars theme collected together numerous existing products, many from Meier's ES/01-xxx line, and their packaging was marked with stickers. As part of the Chaos Wars product line the Partha Pipeline newsletter was transformed into the Ral Partha War Bulletin in January 1986. The War Bulletin followed much of the same format as the Pipeline but its focus was the Chaos Wars product line. Releases were sporadic and continued until at least the Spring of 1990.The Ral Partha War Bulletin, Ral Partha Enterprises, Spring 1990. The new initiative was to include 10-2xx Free Companies of Chaos Wars box sets, but large contracts to produce miniatures for other gaming companies became a higher priority and the Chaos Wars lines were appended to the CS/02-xxx Collector's Series. Among these sets were Charrette's popular Fangs of Fury beastmen, Tom Meier's Korg's Killers orcs, and Meier's Starbrow's Select elves. Having never fully materialized, the Chaos Wars theme was set aside in 1988 in order to give necessary attention to producing official miniatures for TSR, Inc.'s Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. ===Producer of licensed lines, 1988–1995=== In 1988 Meier began his own company, Thunderbolt Mountain Miniatures, but continued to do freelance work for Ral Partha. Company president Chuck Crain hired Sandra L. Garrity, Dave Summers, and Richard Kerr as full-time sculptors, Interview with Sandra Garrity, Accessed November 24, 2008., TMP: In Memory of Charles B. Crain III, Accessed November 24, 2008. to produce an official line of monsters and personalities for AD&D; figures. The earliest figures included 10-56x Battlesystem Brigades (25 mm) which included an entire 25 mm military unit in for tabletop wargames, and adventurers (11-0xx) and monsters (11-4xx) for role-playing games.Ral Partha Inc. 1989 Catalog In 1990 Ral Partha launched 10-5xx Dragonlance and Dungeons & Dragons and 10-55x Forgotten Realms boxed sets. The line grew rapidly and 1991 saw the addition of box sets for 11-9xx Battlesystem Brigades (15 mm), 11-5xx Ravenloft and 10-54x Dark Sun game worlds. The 11-05x, 11-06x AD&D; Personalities of heroes and villains was released in 1994, and additional figures for the Planescape, Ravenloft, and Forgotten Realms game worlds followed in 1995. By 1997 Ral Partha had also added figures for TSR, Inc.'s Dark Sun, Council of Wyrms, and Birthright game worlds. The breadth and earning potential of the Dungeons & Dragons franchise drove new releases and Ral Partha scrambled to acquire the sculpting talents of British and American sculptors, including Nick Bibby, Jeff Wilhelm, Bob Olley, Chris Atkin, Walter Vail, John M. Garrity, and Jim Johnson in 1992, and Chis Fitzpatrick and Geoff Valley by 1995. By 1991 the 20-xxx BattleTech line had grown to include eleven box sets, and more than one hundred 'Mechs, Aerospace fighters, and ground vehicles. Ral Partha also produced 25 mm 20-9xx Mechwarriors depicting pilots, mechanics and guards for role-playing in the BattleTech game world. That same year, Ral Partha sculptors had begun crafting figures for FASA's game Shadowrun, a role-playing game set in a futuristic cyber-world. Shadowrun miniatures had previously been produced by Grenadier Miniatures. Ral Partha introduced their sculpts (20-5xx Shadowrun) in 1992. The 12-xxx The All American Line of fighters, orcs, magic-users, undead, dwarves, and elves was released in 1991 and 1992. The name of the line appears to refer to the fact that all the figures were sculpted Ral Partha's four staff sculptors. Other new lines included Richard Kerr's 1992 futuristic tanks for Steve Jackson Games' Ogre and the introduction of the \\"69-xxx\\" series for White Wolf, Inc.'s Werewolf: The Apocalypse and Vampire: The Masquerade in late 1993.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #196, August 1993, page 119. Figures for White Wolf, Inc.'s Mage: The Ascension followed soon after. Initially, Ral Partha figures were cast from lead and tin alloy, but in 1993 New York legislators nearly passed a public health bill barring the use of lead in toys and miniatures.\\"Through the Looking Glass\\" by Robert Bigalow, Dragon Magazine #192, April 1993. Despite the additional cost, numerous manufacturers anticipated parental concerns, similar legislation in other states, workplace safety, and began using white metal alloys. Ral Partha's staff had previously developed a lead-free alloy for their \\"Partha Pewter,\\" a line of collectible figurines designed for the giftware market. In September 1993 they began using a trademarked white metal alloy they called Ralidium in all their products Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. Advertisement, Dragon Magazine #197, September 1993. and its use marks a clear benchmark for dating old figures. The move away from lead was promoted in advertisements and bright red stickers on existing packaging. In time, New York Governor Mario Cuomo relented to hobbyists' concerns and exempted miniatures from the state's Public Health Law.\\"Through the Looking Glass\\" by Robert Bigalow, Dragon Magazine #205, May 1994. However, the company never went back to lead. Ral Partha correctly anticipated the industry's movement away from lead, but the associated price increases came at a time when miniatures and role playing games were being eclipsed by collectible card games like Wizards of the Coast's 1993 hit Magic: The Gathering. In 1994 the company experimented with Partha Plastics.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1994 Catalog. The move was made well after Citadel Miniatures' successful introduction of plastic and part- plastic figures, but the figures were not popular with Ral Partha's older customer base. In 1993 Dennis Mize designed the \\"Titans of Terror\\" series which invoked the heroes and monsters of the horror films.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1993 Catalog. The following year Mize conceptualized and sculpted 01-7xx Beastmasters, a line of carnivores and their trainers. The line was expanded the following year, and would be completed until 1998.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. Winter '98/'99 Catalog. That same year Ral Partha produced \\"Coins of the Realm,\\" fantasy and historical coinage. In 1995 Ral Partha's sculptors crafted figures for Steve Jackson Games' Space Knight, and dioramas called Sculptors' Row, The Sterling Collection, and \\"Encounters of the Imagination.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1995 Catalog. ===The trouble with wizards, 1996–2001=== During Jack Hesselbrock's second term as company president, he re-established a newsletter which he called the Ral Partha Gaming Club. Like its predecessors it addressed letters from customers and company news. The series ran for six issues from June 1996 to September 1997. In December of 1996 Ral Partha launched a website which hosted the newsletters and product ordering information. The newsletters reveal a number of licensing setbacks. The hobby market had moved away from roleplaying games and wargames and was rapidly becoming dominated by collectible card games like Wizards of the Coast's Magic: The Gathering. Ral Partha faced a number of licensing setbacks. Steve Jackson Games' Ogre miniatures and all three White Wolf lines were discontinued in 1996. Bob Charrette's 18-xxx Runequest figures were discontinued the following year.Ral Partha Gaming Club Newsletter #3, September 30, 1996. Since the late 1970s the gaming miniatures industry had undergone what collectors call \\"scale creep,\\" an increase in size from 20 and 25 mm scales (i.e. height to the eyes of an upright human-sized figure) to 30 mm and 32 mm. By the late 1990s the move to larger figures by market leaders like Games Workshop of Great Britain had made it such that Ral Partha's sculpts of the 1970s and early 1980s appeared significantly smaller than others. In response to the shift in the market, Ral Partha began adding to Tom Meier's collector's series (CS/02-xxx) with a 30 mm scale Fantasy Armies line in a \\"British style\\" which tended to have oversized weapons, punk and Gothic fashions, and separate square bases. Chris Fitzpatrick designed a line of elves. Bob Olley produced new dwarves, goblins, trolls and ogres. Jeff Wilhelm created a series of skeletons. Jim Johnson's contributions were bands of humans known as Horse Lords, Savages, Reavers, and Tyrants. Sandra Garrity designed the Knights of the Legion of Justice A set of rules of the Fantasy Armies were developed by an outside work group called Ral Partha Publishing. The game was first introduced in the 1997 Ral Partha catalog flier as 14-001 Bloodstorm. Soon after the project was retitled Battlestorm and published in 1998.Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. 1997 Catalog Insert – The Final Battle Begins, Bloodstorm. The game was advertised as the first volume of the \\"Fables Gamesystem,\\" but no subsequent installments were issued. Buoyed by the success of Magic:The Gathering, in 1997 Wizards of the Coast acquired TSR, Inc. and with it, control of the rights to Dungeons & Dragons miniatures., Game Cabinet – Wizards of the Coast to acquire TSR, Accessed November 24, 2008. After an extension to their contract, Wizards of the Coast did not renew Ral Partha's license for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons miniatures and the figures went out of production at the end of 1998Ral Partha Gaming Club Newsletter #6, September 30, 1997.Ral Partha Gaming Club Newsletter #5, June 30, 1997 These miniatures are highly sought after by collectors who believe that Wizards of the Coast had ordered the destruction of the master molds. The loss of Dungeons & Dragons and other licenses meant that FASA's BattleTech figures became the majority of Ral Partha's revenue. Under threat of also losing those lines and the financial difficulties created by the changing hobby market, the owners of Ral Partha sold the company in 1998 to FASA and Lanier Hurdle and Mike Hurdle, owners of Zocchi Distribution, a hobby shop supplier., Pyramid Magazine, Industry News, Accessed November 23, 2008. FASA gained sole ownership in the spring of 1999, and Ral Partha began to produce miniatures for FASA's Crimson Skies, Crucible: Conquest of the Final Realm, and VOR: The Maelstrom games. No sooner were these miniatures in stores when FASA ceased production of all their games., FASA Closing FAQ. In December 1999 Ral Partha launched The Partha Pipeline to announce new products for FASA's games, as well as house designs. At this time Ral Partha had an in-house design studio and a host of staff and free-lance sculptors which included Kev Adams, Jeff Grace, Behrle W. Hubboch III, Randy Kerr, Robert Kyde, Phil Lewis, Dennis Mize, Bob Olley, Tim Prow, Steve Saunders, C. Staples, Dave Summers, Jeff Wilhelm, John Winter.The Partha Pipeline Second Series, #1, December 1999, edited by Chris Bledsoe.The Partha Pipeline Second Series, #2, January 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.The Partha Pipeline Second Series, #3, February 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.The Partha Pipeline Second Series, #4, March 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.The Partha Pipeline Second Series, #5, April 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.The Partha Pipeline Second Series, #6, May 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.The Partha Pipeline Second Series, #7, June 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.The Partha Pipeline Second Series, #8, July 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe.The Partha Pipeline Second Series, #9, August 2000, edited by Chris Bledsoe. The second series of the Partha Pipeline ran until late 2000 when the Ral Partha assets faced another acquisition. In January 2001 WizKids, a New Jersey-based producer of plastic collectible miniatures games, acquired the bulk of Ral Partha's assets as part of their purchase of FASA's BattleTech and Shadowrun games. WizKids purchased the rights to some figures from Ral Partha sculptors, but the bulk reverted to the artists. Meier retained his 15/54-xxx Condotitieri, 88-xxx The Colonials, and most of the CS/02-xxx Fantasy Collectors lines., Tom Meier, Thunderbolt Miniatures Forums, Accessed December 12, 2008. Charrette remained in possession of his 53-9xx Bushido figures. Ral Partha continued to produce miniatures for the Battletech and Shadowrun gaming worlds. Wizkids licensed the rights to rulebooks and other gaming materials to Fantasy Productions, better known as \\"FanPro\\" in the United States, which had produced and distributed the German language versions of those games for FASA. FanPro's support of the Shadowrun and Battletech game worlds resulted in continued demand for metal miniatures by gaming enthusiasts. In March 2001 Ral Partha began producing collectible metal versions of the WizKids 64-figure Mage Knight Rebellion set. The relationship between Wizkids and Ral Partha was a short one. By year's end Wizkids rethought its investment in metal miniatures and divested itself of Ral Partha's manufacturing capabilities while retaining the Ral Partha trademark. ===Iron Wind Metals, 2001–2014=== In late 2001 Ral Partha's manufacturing capacities were spun off from WizKids, and renamed Iron Wind Metals, LLC, with longtime general manager Michael Noe as president and in partnership with Marc Rubin, one of Ral Partha's original owners. Iron Wind Metals retained the same location and much of the same production staff, molds, equipment, working relationships with artists, and licensing agreements. In addition to their own lines, Iron Wind Metals carries out contract production work for other gaming labels such as Tom Meier's Thunderbolt Mountain, Dark Sword Miniatures, Crocodile Games, and dozens of others. Iron Wind Metals' new focus on productive capacities reflected a shift in game production strategy. The previous model had been that gaming companies hired sculptors and other creative talent to feed their in-house casting and packaging facilities. This model was successful, but artists sometimes didn't have the capital necessary to retain copyrights, and the mercurial nature of the market meant that their game designs could be sold to others, or languish as assets of dead companies. In the late 1980s, many game designers and sculptors established boutique companies, often operating out of their own homes, and then contracted out or made partnerships with companies like Iron Wind Metals to do the production. Iron Wind Metals continued to use the name Ral Partha to describe archived designs, but the website and Ral Partha trademark remained the property of Wizkids which underwent a series of acquisitions. In 2003 WizKids was purchased by Topps, a manufacturer of sports cards who were interested in WizKids range of similarly collectible plastic miniatures. In 2007 Topps was purchased by The Tornante Company, a private equity firm. Citing falling profits associated with the Great Recession, Tornante put the Wizkids product lines on hold in November 2008, but continued to lease the intellectual properties of Battletech and Shadowrun game worlds. In September 14, 2009, The Tornante Company sold the majority of the Wizkids assets to the National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA), but retained the rights to Battletech, Shadowrun, and the Ral Partha trademark and website. The divisions and purchases meant that assets important to the Ral Partha brand were divided among numerous enterprises. Between 1998 and 2009, the Ral Partha trademark passed from FASA, to Wizkids, Topps, and finally The Tornante Company. None of whom utilized the brand. The miniatures for the Battletech miniatures produced by Ral Partha and then Iron Wind Metals remained popular, but the future of the game was always in question. FanPro had lost its bid to produce the Battletech and Shadowrun game worlds, but InMediaRes created a new subsidiary, Catalyst Game Labs to design new expansions for the games and provided continuity by employing many former FanPro staff The productive capacities for Ral Partha miniatures remained with Iron Wind Metals who had retained working relationships with many of the artists, but could not use the Ral Partha name. Longtime customers could special order many of the figures, but they could not be marketed as Ral Partha figures. The trademark languished until 2014 when The Tornante Company agreed to sell the assets to Iron Wind Metals. By the end of 2014 Iron Wind Metals had recreated Ral Partha by forming a new division which united the Ral Partha trademark, website and sculptors' copyrights with their improved productive capacities. ===Ral Partha, a Division of Iron Wind Metals, 2014-present=== On the 40th anniversary of the founding of Ral Partha, Iron Wind Metals relaunched the miniature lines from Ral Partha's \\"golden age.\\" Establishing Ral Partha as a division of Iron Wind Metals, president Mike Noe and co-owner Mark Rubin launched a Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the production costs of its 1980s lines under the Chaos Wars game world. Ral Partha had begun developing Chaos Wars in 1986. At that time they had released a new version of 'house rules\\" called Rules According to Ral gaming system with scenarios, several boxed sets, and blister packs marked with Chaos Wars stickers. However, the initiative was put on hold by the push to produce miniatures for lines licensed by TSR, FASA, and other partners. After a sixteen-year hiatus, Chaos Wars returned as a series of blister packs, limited edition boxed sets, and battle packs of elves, orcs and goblin figures drawn from Ral Partha's CS/02-xxx Fantasy Collectors, 12-xxx The All American and other lines. A majority of the figures were sculpted by Tom Meier who supported the re-release. In 2016 Iron Wind Metals completed a second campaign and revived previously archived figures of dwarves, undead and troglodytes ==Sculptors, artists and mold-makers== Ral Partha's sculptors, artists, and mold-makers and the years in which they worked for the company: Staff Sculptors *Tom Meier, 1975–1988, Freelance 1989-1991, 2015–present *Dennis Mize, 1979–1999 *Julie Guthrie, 1983–1992 *Bob Charrette, 1984–1988 *Chris Atkin, 1985–1999 *Richard Kerr, 1987–1994 *Sandra Garrity, 1988–1992 *Dave Summers, 1988–1996 *Bob Olley, 1990-1999 *Jeff Wilhelm, 1991–2000, Biography of Jeffrey P.

Owain Brogyntyn divided his lands equally between his three sons on his death, and his eldest son, Iorwerth, inherited lands centred on Cymmer (or Kymmer), in the parish of Llangar and commote of Edeirnion (part of Merionethshire). His son, Gruffydd ab Iorwerth, fought against Edward I during his invasion of Wales. After the Conquest of Wales, Gruffydd came \\"into the King's peace\\", and on 22 July 1284, had his lands confirmed by Edward I , 'just as his ancestors had held them', thereby creating him a baron in the English feudal baronage. The first surviving use of the title was by Gruffydd's grandson, Owain, who in 1334 was summoned to the sessions at Harlech as Owenus ap Davidus, Dominus de Kimmer. Some authorities, therefore, date the barons from Owain, whereas others begin with Gruffydd. In the fifteenth century their principal residence was known as Plas o Cymmer, and was later renamed Plas Uchaf. Later the 10th Baron moved to the nearby mansion of Gwerclas. * Gruffydd ab Iorwerth ab Owain Brogyntyn (fl. 1284-92), 1st Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion * Dafydd ap Gruffydd, his son, (fl. 1301), 2nd Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion * Owain ap Dafydd, his son, (fl. 1334), 3rd Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion * Llywelyn Ddu ap Dafydd, his brother (fl. 1370), 4th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion * Ieuan ap Llywelyn Ddu, his son, (d. 1392), 5th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion * Rhys ab Ieuan, his son, (fl. 1392-1415), 6th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion, ancestor of the Jones of Faerdref Uchaf family. * Dafydd ap Rhys, his son, (d. 1444), 7th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion * Gruffydd Fychan ap Dafydd, his son, 8th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion * William ap Gruffydd Fychan, his son, 9th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion * Huw ap William, his son, (fl. 1546-1602), 10th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion, who moved his residence from Plas Uchaf to Gwerclas. His pedigree and arms were confirmed at the visitations of Wales on 7 October 1594. * Humphrey Hughes, his son, (d. 1620), 11th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion, who assumed, with his brother, the surname 'Hughes' and was High Sheriff of Merionethshire in 1618. * Richard Hughes, his brother (1561-1641), 12th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion, who was High Sheriff of Merionethshire in 1619. * Humphrey Hughes, his son (1605-1682), 13th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion, who was a Commissioner of Array during the English Civil War and fought at the Battle of Rowton Moor. He was High Sheriff of Merionethshire in 1661. * Hugh Hughes, his grandson (1659-1725), 14th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion, and was High Sheriff of Merionethshire in 1720. * Daniel Hughes, his nephew (1694-1754), 15th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion * John Hughes, his son (1742-1784), 16th Baron of Kymmer- yn-Edeirnion * William Hughes, his son (1779-1836), 17th Baron of Kymmer-yn- Edeirnion * William Hughes, his son (1801-), 18th Baron of Kymmer-yn- Edeirnion, a Captain in the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues). * The Rev'd.

Introduced in 1983, the Nurofen brand was acquired following Reckitt Benckiser's acquisition of Boots Healthcare in 2005. The brand is primarily marketed and sold in the United Kingdom, other parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In 2016 it was the biggest selling branded over- the-counter medication sold in Great Britain, with sales of £116.8 million. ===Variants=== Boxes of Nurofen on a pharmacy shelf There are 11 variants of Nurofen, all of which contain ibuprofen as an active ingredient. The ibuprofen is variously formulated as the free acid, or the lysine salt. For oral formulations, i.e., taken by mouth, it is available in the conventional solid round tablet, a torpedo-shaped solid caplet, or may alternatively be in the form of a soft gel cap. It is also available as a topical gel, which is applied directly to the surface of the skin. In some cases these are marketed as being useful for treating specific types of pain; such as back pain or period pain. The primary difference among the various formulations is speed and duration of ibuprofen absorption. According to the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA), the form of ibuprofen in 'Nurofen Tension Headache' (ibuprofen lysine) is absorbed nearly twice as fast as the form in 'Nurofen Period Pain' (ibuprofen free acid), with the former reaching peak blood concentrations in 38 minutes, compared to 80 minutes for the latter. Some variants of Nurofen contain additional active ingredients; for example, 'Nurofen Cold & Flu' contains the non-sedating decongestant pseudoephedrine. Others are advertised as being targeted for specific pain types, for example period pain. Nurofen Plus Nurofen Plus is a pain relief medication based on codeine and ibuprofen.The Medical Journal of Australia. Nurofen Plus misuse: an emerging cause of perforated gastric ulcer. Accessed 2 July 2009. It contains 12.8 mg of codeine phosphate (a mild opioid analgesic) and 200 mg of ibuprofen, which is an NSAID. Nurofen Plus is the only product in the Nurofen range that contains codeine. The original Nurofen Plus tablet was manufactured in two equal parts, joined together, and then coated. One part would contain the 12.8 mg of codeine phosphate, and the other part contained 200 mg of ibuprofen. The tablets could be forcefully split into their two constituent active ingredients; for recreational use of codeine. Such drugs have a potential for misuse because they are available freely to the public. ===2011 product recall=== On 25 August 2011, it was reported that several packs of Nurofen Plus were found to contain Seroquel XR — an anti- psychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia — in Boots stores across London. The next day, a safety alert was issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Pharmacists were told to check each package of Nurofen Plus to look for anti-psychotic drugs. Three batches of Nurofen Plus were affected by the alert. Reckitt Benckiser, manufacturer of Nurofen Plus, said that it did not know where the drugs had been switched. The product was re-released in October in cellophane-sealed packs. ===Misleading advertising=== Australia In 2010, the Australian consumer advocate Choice awarded Nurofen a \\"Shonky award\\" for charging more for \\"targeted\\" products, all of which had the same active ingredient as the base product. In 2012, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration upheld a complaint that Nurofen's advertising of different products for different pain was \\"misleading or likely to be misleading\\", and ordered that \\"any representation that refers to two or more Nurofen products that contain equivalent quantities of ibuprofen and include the same product specific indications on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods must clearly indicate, in the body of the advertisement, that the two products can be used for the same purposes and are interchangeable (or words to that effect)\\". In April 2013, the Australian consumer affairs television programme The Checkout ran a story about Nurofen's claims about targeting specific pain. Edelman, the PR company for Reckitt Benckiser provided a statement, some of which was used in the programme. Included in the information provided by Edelman were photocopies of some 'sciencey looking documents' that confirmed that Ibuprofen was 'Non- selective'. In March 2015, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched proceedings against Reckitt Benckiser; for misleading advertising for its targeted pain range. In December 2015, the Federal Court of Australia found that Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Nurofen, had misled consumers with its \\"Nurofen Specific pain range\\", and ordered that all Nurofen specific pain products be removed from retail sale within three months. A spokeswoman for Reckitt Benckiser argued that, \\"[This] specific-pain range\\" was intended \\"to help consumers navigate their pain relief options, particularly within the grocery environment where there is no healthcare professional to assist decision making\\". The ACCC said that the products were found to be \\"no more effective at treating the type of pain described on its packaging than any of the other Nurofen specific pain products\\", and sold for almost twice the price. Specific pain range painkillers include Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension; and all contain the \\"same active ingredient, 342 milligrams of ibuprofen lysine\\". In April 2016, the Federal Court imposed a $1.7 million fine on Reckitt Benckiser. The ACCC appealed the decision in May arguing that $1.7 million in penalties did not act as an adequate deterrent for a company the size of Reckitt Benckiser. In December 2016, the Federal Court increased the fine to $6 million, the highest corporate penalty ever awarded for misleading conduct under the Australian Consumer Law. United Kingdom Following the 2015 Australian decision, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that it was investigating earlier complaints about a television advertisement for Nurofen Express; alleged to be misleading, as it implied that the medicine targeted muscles in the head. ==References== Category:Lists of brands Category:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ","title":"Ibuprofen brand names"},{"id":"20365721","text":"Gaudentius (c. 440 in Rome - after 455) was the son of Flavius Aetius.

The family were modestly well-off and could afford to employ a maidservant. Daniel Roberts was later able to buy his own farm at Trefarthen on Anglesey, as well as fourteen cottages at Llanrug, share- holdings in public utilities and part-ownership of a schooner plying the coastal freight-trade. In religion the family were Calvinistic Methodists. John Bryn Roberts never married.Jack Eaton, Judge John Bryn Roberts; University of Wales Press, 1989, pp 1–6 John received private tuition at home and was then sent to Cheltenham Grammar School. ==Career== In 1860 John Roberts went to Chester to study land surveying but in 1863 he took over the management of his father's old tenant farm at Bryn Adda, south of Bangor. Soon afterwards his brother, Hugh, who had been working in a solicitor's office in Caernarfon told John he was unhappy there and John offered him the management of the farm in return for his job with the solicitor. John took to the staid business of the law, which his brother had so found so stultifying, and decided to make it his career.Eaton, op cit p9 In 1868 he passed his law examinations with distinction and received the Clifford's Inn prize from the Incorporated Law Society.http://lloydgeorgesociety.org.uk/resources/sites/84.234.17.197-4611481cc83403.08117414/Welsh+Liberal+MPs+elected+in+1906.pdf He set up practice in Bangor and Llangefni on the North Wales Circuit, choosing to live at the family farm at Bryn Adda. In 1889, he was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn. In 1906 he was appointed a county court judge in Glamorgan, although the possibility of a judgeship had apparently been mooted as early as 1886 and he rose to become a Deputy Chairman of Quarter Sessions. Roberts was transferred to the North Wales and Chester circuit in 1918 until his retirement in 1921. As a judge he heard a number of hard cases involving industrial and workmen's compensation law and in the heady atmosphere of industrial relations of this time, against the background of the Taff Vale judgement he acquired a reputation, especially within the South Wales Miners Federation, for being anti-union and anti-labour. However, Roberts' biographer, Jack Eaton, cites from a number of Roberts' cases and rulings on appeal which he believes indicates these anti-labour accusations are incorrect. Eaton does however concede that Roberts was 'nonplussed' by the legislation on workmen's compensation.Eaton, op cit pp 85–86 ==Entering politics== Roberts' nonconformity, his work in the law for the rights of tenant farmers against the Tory landowners and his own ideas about Free Trade and self-help predisposed him towards the Liberal Party and his education and position in North Wales society attracted the party to him. In 1882 he was approached about the possibility of standing for Parliament as Liberal candidate in Caernarfon Boroughs which was later to become the fiefdom of David Lloyd George. In 1884 he was asked to stand for Anglesey and he eventually agreed to be nominated for the new seat of Eifion or South Caernarvonshire which was being created for the 1885 general election.Eaton, op cit pp 12–13 Roberts' selection as Liberal candidate for Eifion was contested and not without controversy. Supporters of his Congregationalist opponent, R Pughe Jones, complained that no meeting of the whole local Liberal Association had been called and that only the delegates, who were predominantly Methodists like Roberts, had been asked for their opinion.Matthew Cragoe, Culture, Politics and National Identity in Wales: 1832–1886; OUP, 2004 p96 ==The 1885 general election== Despite these objections, Roberts was selected to be the Liberal candidate and his 1885 election address emphasised his support for the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales, the expansion of intermediate education, land reform, reform of the legal system, Free Trade, improved Parliamentary procedures to restrict Tory and Irish Nationalist obstructionism and his anti- war, anti-imperialist beliefs. Another issue in the election was an industrial dispute at the Dinorwic Quarry but which was complicated by being interpreted as, as much an attack by the proprietor and local landowner on the religion and class of his workers, as a conflict over wages and conditions.Eaton, op cit pp13-14 Despite suffering from a speech impediment which restricted his ability as a political orator, Roberts was an effective enough candidate and the result of the election was a victory over his Conservative opponent, a member of the local squirearchy, Hugh Ellis-Nanney, by 4,535 votes to 2,573 on a turnout of 80%. Ellis-Nanney later suffered another Parliamentary defeat when he failed to hold the Conservative seat of Caernarvon Boroughs in a by- election held on 10 April 1890 when his opponent was David Lloyd George. ==Politics, 1885–1906== Roberts held his seat at Eifion at every general election until he resigned as an MP in June 1906 upon his appointment as a county court judge. During his time in Parliament, Roberts was a noted orthodox Gladstonian and was hostile to the radical, nationalist group of Welsh MPs like Lloyd George and the supporters of Cymru Fydd. In fact he was highly critical of Lloyd George and Cymru Fydd and publicly accused Lloyd George of conspiring with the Tories and Parnellites in his disestablishment rebellion of May 1895, commenting that this was a prime factor in the downfall of Lord Rosebery's government at the general election of 1895. The Welsh Unionists performed well in this election gaining six Liberal seats and reducing Liberal majorities across many constituencies,K O Morgan, Wales in British Politics: 1868–1922; University of Wales Press, 1963,p159 explaining the ferocity of Roberts’ attack on Lloyd George. It is little wonder that in his later political life he was described as an Asquithian Liberal.K O Morgan, Wales in British Politics, p295 However Roberts and Lloyd George were as one in their opposition to the Boer War. with Roberts being described as a ‘sentimental politician’ on the issue and a member of the ‘extreme peace party’.John William Auld, The Pro-Boer Liberals in Britain During the Boer War, 1899–1902; National Library of Wales, 1977 p277 Some historians have disparaged Roberts as complacent and plodding, noted his tendency to put on airs and graces or pointed out an inherent cautiousness.Morgan, Wales in British Politics: 1868–1922 p58 In the view of John Grigg, Roberts was “too awkward” to succeed, never becoming a minister or rising higher than a county court judge despite having a good political mind and being an excellent lawyer. His decision to resign in 1906 and accept the offer of the county court judgeship has been seen by some as an escape from the coming radical Liberal politics with which he found little favour.J.

While it is highly toxic to many fish, this sponge is eaten by certain angelfish and is known to form part of the diet of the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). ==Description== This massive sponge has varying forms in different locations. One common form is barrel-shaped or cake-shaped with a flattened top, but it may also be roughly globular or amorphous. The texture is firm, tough and dense. The surface is broadly undulating and rough, with a mixture of large and small osculi surrounded by groups of fine pores, each in diameter. The color of the sponge both inside and out is purplish, gray or brownish-black, and the surface is often partly obscured by sediment or by algae growing on it. ==Distribution and habitat== This sponge is native to the Caribbean Sea and around the coasts of the Bahamas and Florida. It occurs on patch reefs and in lagoons; when growing on soft sediment it often has a wider and deeper base than when growing on rock. Its depth range is . ==Ecology== Although it is toxic to many vertebrates, some fish have been observed to feed on this sponge, a fact confirmed by fragments of the sponge being found in their guts; these fish include the queen angelfish (Holacanthus ciliaris), the rock beauty (Holacanthus tricolor) and the French angelfish (Pomacanthus paru). Other predators feeding on the sponge include the polychaete worm Branchiosyllis oculata, and the red cushion sea star (Oreaster reticulatus). It is also preyed upon by the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). The tunnels and cavities inside the sponge are home to a wide array of invertebrates. Being a suspension feeder, this sponge has been found to be helpful in controlling harmful blooms of cyanobacteria; sites in Florida Bay with an abundance of loggerhead sponges were found to have few or no blooms whereas similar sites with few sponges had long-lasting, dense blooms. ==References== Category:Hadromerida Category:Fauna of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fauna of the Caribbean Category:Fauna of the Dominican Republic Category:Taxa named by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck Category:Animals described in 1814 ","title":"Spheciospongia vesparium"},{"id":"20365784","text":"Uncial 0249 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament.

It has been a focus of dispute between the Hindu and Muslim communities since the 18th century. The blame or the credit for the entire temple construction movement at Ayodhya is placed on the Sangh Parivar, a group in direct opposition with FOIL. The RSS has denied responsibility and questioned the objectivity of the report that was filed blaming them.

This clearly shows FOIL's motives are rooted in promoting social harmony in India and more generally in South Asia and abroad. Announcing a call to join FOIL in SAMAR, or the South Asian Magazine for Action and Reflection, in the Summer/Fall 1997 Issue, Mathew and Prashad discuss various projects that FOIL has developed and how the many FOIL projects are coordinated by different members spread across the US, Canada and UK. Indeed, through its \\"clearing house\\" model, FOIL has spawned several organizations and groups in North America, Europe and India. === Organizations === Mathew and Prashad also started the annual Youth Solidarity Summer Camp in New York. This was intended as a response to the summer camps organized for young Indians in America by the RSS, or the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The purpose of these camps is to bring together young South Asian students to discuss a range of issues, including, but not only, communalism and religious tolerance. Almost 300 people have attended the camps and the networks that they have created has recently led to the setting up of a national youth organization called Chingari. Chingari serves as a movement to empower educated Indian youth and help them with job placement. == Founders  Biju Mathew === Biju Mathew is an American Marxist activist. He is an Indian immigrant and a professor of the Business Administration department at Rider University. Mathew is also an organizer of New York Taxi Workers Alliance. He has published a book titled Taxi!: Cabs and Capitalism in New York City (The New Press). Biju Mathew is also a member of the Board of the Brecht Forum in NYC.

A prominent critic of leftists in the US, Mathew argued at a 2004 conference on Life After Capitalism that leftists in the United States are not as effective as they could be in situations where they win influence through community organizing, such as in local governments, because they often do not appreciate ideas originating from other parts of the world. == IDRF controversy == On 20 November 2002 FOIL published a report, titled 'The Foreign Exchange of Hate IDRF and the American Funding of Hindutva',The Foreign Exchange of Hate IDRF and the American Funding of Hindutva, 2002, Sabrang Communications & Publishing Pvt.

The report is described as a 'careful study and analysis of more than 150 pieces of documentary evidence, almost three-quarters of which are those published by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or RSS.' Separated into multiple parts, it begins by claiming the IDRF was supporting Hindutva, or the extremist Hindu ideology which has caused much of the violence between religious groups in India recently and has seen tremendous growth, much of which the RSS is responsible for, outside India over the last two decades. \\"The Foreign Exchange of Hate\\" asserts that the IDRF in fact has religious ties and serves as a major monetary sponsor for Hindutva organizations in India. The authors of the report investigated the sending of money to Indian movements that participated in the attacks of Muslims in Gujarat, India in 2002.

In 2006, as part of its initial capital campaign, the college received a donation of 1.5 million dollars from Frederick M.

His father granted to him and his successors the Cantref of Edeyrnion and the Lordship of Dinmael. These areas were both remote frontier lands situated between Powys and the neighbouring ascendant kingdom of Gwynedd. From the earlier part of the 12th Century both lordships usually paid homage to Gwynedd.The Royal Tribes of Wales, pg. 120 Owain had three sons. It is from the youngest of these sons, Iorwerth ab Owain ap Madog ap Maredudd, that the barons of Cymmer yn Edeyrnion claim descent. Iorwerth's son, Gruffudd ab Iorwerth, was confirmed in his lands by Edward I in 1284. The first recorded use of the Kymmer yn Edernion baronial title is by Owain ap Dafydd (great-great grandson of Owain Brogyntyn) in 1334 who resided at Plas Uchaf in the parish of Llangar, Merionethshire (in that part of the county historically included within the cantref of Edeyrnion). The family started using the surname \\"Hughes of Gwerclas\\" after Hugh ap William in 1546. Thomas Hughes, \\"Esquire of Gwerclas and Hendreforfydd\\" is recorded as having served as a captain under the Royalist standard for Charles I and died in 1670. His third and only surviving son John Hughes married a descendant of Ednyfed Fychan. John was succeeded first by his brother Hugh, and then his son Daniel. Daniel married Catherine daughter of John Wynn \\"of Pen y Clawdd\\". He died in 1754 and from this time the Hughes of Gwerclas resided at Pen y Clawdd, thought to be in the vicinity of Chirk in Flintshire. In 1851 the XVIIIth Baron of Kymmer yn Edernion is recorded as being William Hughes Esq. (b. 1801 at Pen y Clawdd). He spent a long time living at Gayton Mansion in Northamptonshire. In the 1851 National Census of England and Wales he, along with his wife, children, and domestic servants are recorded as living in Twyford, Hampshire. He contributed to antiquarian debate and was employed as a barrister at the Inner Temple. His only son, William O'Farrel Hughes, was still living in 1911 but by then a 73-year-old retired clergyman with no children. His cousin - Lieutenant Talbot de Bashall Hughes (b. 1836) - had joined the Cape Mounted Riflemen in the 1850s and disappears from the record. It is possible that he may have died in South Africa during the Anglo-Zulu Wars.

He was promoted to sous-lieutenant on 16 September 1791, and to lieutenant on 12 October. Serving the Armée du Rhin, he took part with Custine in the capture of Speyer and Mainz in 1792. He rose to captain on 18 October 1793, taking part in the sieges of Dunkirk and Maubeuge, and in several skirmishes in the region. Bruneteau was relieved of duty on 14 February 1794, during the Reign of Terror, for being nobility. He was reinstated at the Thermidorian Reaction. In 1796, he joined the Army of Italy, taking part in the Battle of the Bridge of Arcole and in the Battle of Rivoli. In 1798, he was transferred to the Army of the West, before returning to Italy. He took part in the Battle of Cassano and in the Battle of Novi on 15 August 1799, where he received a battlefield promotion to chef de bataillon (major). The rank was confirmed on 2 May 1800. He was then transferred to the Army of the Rhine, where he took part in several skirmishes. In 1802, he took part in several skirmishes with the flotilla of Boulogne. On 28 February 1803, he departed for India, arriving at Île de France in August. From 1803 to 1805, he headed the infantry of the expeditionary corps in India. === First Empire === On 24 August 1805, he was promoted to colonel. He was made governor of Île Bonaparte on 9 October 1809, a position he held until the Invasion of Île Bonaparte on 8 July 1810. Bruneteau fought the 7000 men of the invasion force with 300 line infantrymen and 300 mobile National guards, the militia being dispersed over the island. He surrendered after Saint-Denis was half under the control of the British. Bruneteau returned to France in November 1810. An enquiry deemed the capitulation of Île Bonaparte to be \\"most honourable\\", and he received the command of an infantry regiment. In 1812, he took part in the French invasion of Russia, notably fighting at Smolensk and at the Battle of Berezina, where he was captured by the Russians. He was back in France on 26 June 1814, having been made a Baron of Empire on 8 April 1813. === Restauration === After the Bourbon Restauration, on 6 September 1814, he was promoted to maréchal de camp, and he received the command of the fortress of Landau, a position which he held from 11 December 1814 to 30 March 1815. During the Hundred Days, Bruneteau rallied to Napoleon, and was promoted to brigade general in the imperial decree of 10 June 1815. He took command of the fortress of Sélestat on 4 May, with a 4000-strong garrison. He was besieged by 9000 men during two months. Refusing to surrender to foreign troops, he repelled two direct assaults, and managed to conquer the headquarters of the besiegers, before surrendering to Louis XVIII on 1 October. At the second Restauration, Bruneteau was suspended from the Army. He headed the department of Corrèze, from 26 June to 18 August 1816, and again from 25 December 1816 to 12 November 1817. He then headed the subdivisions of the 19th military division.

His parents, Joseph Louis (an optician) and Jane Henrietta Casartelli (Ronchetti), had resided in the area for some time. He was believed to have been considered an intelligent as well as pious child, something which was felt he learned from his mother.https://web.archive.org/web/20050418024409/http://www.churches- online.org.uk/salfordarchives/clergy/clergy_c.html ==Education== At the age of nine he attended Salford Catholic Grammar School and became fluent in French, German, Italian and Spanish. Whilst there he came under the influence of two masters, Canon Augustus De Clerc and Bruno de Splenter. Louis went on to study at St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw\\"Casartelli, Right Reverend Louis Charles\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 27 where he won a gold medal for classics as well earning an MA degree externally from University of London in 1873. In 1874 he began specialist theology studies at the University of Louvain, in Belgium, where he also specialised in Eastern languages, an interest first acquired – so he said – through a chance encounter with a book in the Manchester Free Library. He was an avid diary keeper, often writing in several languages on the one page. ==Priesthood== Louis was ordained to the priesthood on 10 September 1876 by the then Bishop Herbert Vaughan. He was seconded to the teaching staff of St Bede's College, Manchester although in 1884 he returned once more to the University of Louvain and gained a doctorate in Oriental literature. Upon completion of his studies, he returned to St Bede's and in 1891 he was appointed rector. From 1898 he lectured five times each Lent term at Louvain; Sanskrit, Zend and Pahlavi becoming his speciality. He was lecturer in Iranian languages in the University of Manchester, and was offered a position as the Katrak lecturer in Iranian studies at Oxford University but although he accepted he was unable to give the lecture due to illness. ==Bishop== On 28 August 1903 Louis was appointed Bishop of Salford but wrote to Rome begging to decline. His appeal was rejected and he wrote to Abbot Francis Aidan Gasquet OSB \\"if the wish did not sound rather an impiety one could almost desire that Cardinal Gotti might have held me suspect of Liberalism and other dreadful things\\" (1 September 1903). He was consecrated in St John's Cathedral, on 21 September 1903 by Archbishop-elect Francis Bourne, with Bishops Thomas Whiteside and Samuel Webster Allen as co-consecrators. The poor Catholics of Manchester and Salford took great pride in the appointment, and when charged that nobody with any intelligence could possibly be a Catholic, would reply \\"Well just look at our Bishop\\". Bishop Casartelli was one of the first bishops in England to attempt concerted Catholic Action. He produced a monthly journal The Federationist and never failed to make a contribution on contemporary issues. He became the founder and president of the Manchester Dante Society from 1906, The Catenian Association from 1908, Manchester Egyptian Association from 1908 to 1910, the president of the Manchester Statistical Society from 1898 to 1900 and a supporter of the Oriental, Geographical, Antiquarian and other societies. Casartelli contributed a number of articles to the Catholic Encyclopedia. On 18 December 1918 he was elected an honorary member of the Royal Asiatic Society which he declares in his diary of the day as \\"a most astonishing and unexpected honour.\\" He was awarded the Order of Leopold. ==Death== Bishop Casartelli died at his residence at St Bede's College, Manchester on 18 January 1925, and is buried in St Joseph's Cemetery, Moston, Manchester. ==References== Category:1852 births Category:1925 deaths Category:English people of Italian descent Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Post-Reformation Roman Catholic bishops in England Category:People from Cheetham Hill Category:Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968) alumni Category:Alumni of Ushaw College Category:Alumni of University of London Worldwide Category:Contributors to the Catholic Encyclopedia ","title":"Louis Casartelli"},{"id":"20366308","text":"Codex Climaci rescriptus, known as Uncial 0250 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is a palimpsest with a Greek uncial text of the New Testament and Christian Palestinian Aramaic uncial texts of the Old and New Testament as well as two apocryphal texts, including one on the Dormition of the Mother of God, overwritten by Syriac treatises of Johannes Climacus (hence name of the codex): the Scala paradisi and portions of the Liber ad pastorem.

The first-season episodes ended with a bonus live- action segment in which a mother/father and child made the meal featured in the episode, although these segments were later removed due to time constraints. ==Characters== * ZeFronk/Frankie (voiced by Rob Paulsen) - A French-accented Dachshund who has the talent of cooking. * Sue - The assistant of ZeFronk.

A wide street crosses left-right outside of the fence, with a handful of horse-drawn carts and pedestrians in 19th century clothing. Linen Quarter is a vibrant area of Belfast city centre. The name is derived from the great many linen warehouses that are still present in the area. The Linen Quarter is host to some of the major cultural venues of Belfast, including the Ulster Hall and Grand Opera House, alongside a large number of hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes. The district also includes the main transport hub of Belfast. The Linen trade that used to dominate this part of the city has now been replaced by international consultancy firms and many technology start ups. Belfast City Council and a number of central government departments are also headquartered in the Linen Quarter, giving the area a distinct character. The vibrancy of the Linen Quarter is supported by the Linen Quarter Business Improvement District, which is a democratically elected body that also promotes the area and helps co-ordinate improvements across the district.

Traditionally the district was understood to occupy an approximate square shaped area bounded by Howard Street/Donegall Square South/May Street, Great Victoria Street, Ormeau Avenue and Joy Street. Since the formation of Linen Quarter BID in 2018, however, the district is often considered to have a wider footprint that includes the Europa Transport Hub and parts of Dublin Road. History of the Linen Quarter The area now occupied by the Linen Quarter today was marshy land that was part of the estuary where the river Blackstaff flowed into the Lagan. The only habitable grounds directly south of the 17th century city were the sandbanks on the western high water mark of this estuary, where the principal thoroughfare leading south towards Lisburn, and ultimately, Dublin was established. This old route can still be recognised as today’s Sandy Row. The only noticeable development in this area was the paper mill that was established along the river Blackstaff by the Joy family. It occupied the ground around the eastern end of today’s Ormeau Avenue and is remembered through the name of Joy Street to this day. This situation persisted well into the 18th century, when the former castle gardens of Belfast Castle (burned down in 1708) were developed into a new city quarter with Donegall Place and the White Linen Hall (completed in 1788) at its heart. Consequently, Linen hall street was opened behind the White Linen Hall and soon other streets followed, including Dublin Road in 1809 and Great Victoria Street in 1823. The established of the Gasworks by the Lagan river and the opening of the railway station at Great Victoria Street in the 1820s helped fuel the remarkable growth of this part of Belfast. This included the establishment of new bars (e.g. the Railway Tavern - now known as the Crown Bar) and places of entertainment. After a new mechanised linen industry emerged (originally set up by the Mulholland family in their Linen mills in York Street in the 1820s), the area gradually became the centre of the linen trade, with offices and warehouses for major Linen companies built south of the White Linen Hall congregating around Bedford Street. The economic importance of the linen trade for the city is acknowledged in the nickname of \\"Linenopolis\\" that was assigned to Belfast during the industrial era. Many of the linen warehouses dating back to this period still survive in the Linen Quarter to this day, such as Ewart’s buildings (named after William Ewart and Sons, one of the world’s leading linen manufacturers), Bryson House, Yorkshire House (built by the Jaffe Brothers, another one of Europe’s leading linen firms), Armagh House, and Tyrone House, which once housed the Franklin Steam Laundry. Most of these have now been converted into new office premises or apartments. With some downturns and recoveries along the way the linen industry survived until the Second World War. But after that, rising costs, new synthetic materials and foreign competition saw it collapse. With the outbreak of civil unrest during the period from 1970 onwards, better known as ‘the Troubles’, the area experienced further decline and became semi-derelict for decades. After the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, renewed investment kick-started a 21st century economic revival in Northern Ireland in general, and in the Linen Quarter in particular. Regeneration of the Linen Quarter Today, the Linen Quarter is leading the way in adjusting Belfast’s economy to the 21st century. Housed in the historic Ormeau Baths, the Tech Hub was opened in 2017 to help drive Belfast’s nascent high tech industry by providing a co-operative networking centre for tech start-up companies. The district has also seen the transformation of its many linen warehouses into swanky new offices that have attracted a number of international firms to the area. Currently there are various large scale office blocks planned for the district, including the Bedford Square development and the redevelopment of the Movie House site on Dublin Road that is to house the Kainos international headquarters. The building of the £50 million Grand Central Hotel by the Hastings Hotel Group confirmed the Linen Quarter as the heart of Belfast’s hotel scene. Named for the city’s most famous historic hotel, which was located on the site of the CastleCourt shopping centre on Royal Avenue, the Grand Central Hotel in Bedford Street is comfortably the biggest hotel ever built in the city. Other recently opened hotels in the area include the Maldron, Hampton by Hilton and the Etap Hotel, while forthcoming hotels include the George Best Hotel on the corner of Bedford Street and Donegall Square South BBC will continue to contribute to the vibrancy of the district by planning a £77 million regeneration of its existing Broadcasting House site on Ormeau Avenue. Meanwhile, a major restoration of the Grand Opera House, costing £11 million, is due to begin in 2020 ahead of the theatre’s 125th anniversary later that year. In 2022, the new £200 million Belfast Transport Hub is scheduled to open. Named Weavers Cross, a name inspired by the linen heritage of the area, it will boost twenty-six bus stands and eight train platforms and will serve as the arrival station for the Dublin to Belfast Enterprise service. The project will also include a large leisure, residential and commercial development. Transport links will also be boosted by a new North-South Glider route that will see a number of stops located within the Linen Quarter. Linking in to these infrastructure projects, the Streets Ahead V public realm improvement scheme will provide improved pedestrian environments between Donegal Square South and Shaftesbury Square. Hospitality & Entertainment The hospitality business of the Linen Quarter has its origins linked to the development of the railway system. In the first half of the 19th century, inns offering food and lodging sprang up around the newly opened Great Victoria Street terminus. In 1839 The Ulster Railway Tavern opens in Great Victoria Street (refurbished and renamed Crown Liquor Saloon in 1888), while virtually next door, the Dublin and Armagh Hotel opened (now Robinsons). Across Amelia Street from the Crown was the Downshire Arms Hotel and its site is now occupied by Brennan’s Bar. The Linen Quarter continues to house a substantial proportion of Belfast’s hotel industry. The Europa, owned by the Hastings Group and built on the site of the old Great Victoria Street Terminus, is probably the most famous Belfast hotel today. It has hosted some of the world’s most famous people, including presidents and film and music stars. Other iconic hotels in the district include the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Great Victoria Street, Grand Central Hotel in Bedford Street, and the Ten Square Hotel in Donegall Square South. thumb The Linen Quarter has also been at the heart of Belfast’s entertainment scene since the 19th century. Completed in 1862 as a grand ballroom, the Ulster Hall became one of the largest music halls in the British Isles. It has hosted a range of world famous artists including include Count John McCormack, Paul Robeson, Caruso, Edward Elgar, Sir Thomas Beecham, Sidney Bechet, the Rolling Stones, U2 and Rory Gallagher. The 19th century was also a boom period for the circus in Belfast, and many were staged in the Linen Quarter. The Grand Opera House was opened in 1895 as the ‘Cirque and Grand Opera House’ and presented several circuses. Since its opening it has hosted many of the world’s greatest entertainers, including Laurel and Hardy, Sir Henry Irving and Ellen Terry, Gracie Fields, Sarah Bernhardt and Luciano Pavarotti, who made his UK debut there. The BBC has been an integral part of the Linen Quarter since it made its first Northern Irish broadcast on 15 September 1924 from its first studio located in Linenhall Street. BBC's new Northern Ireland headquarters in Ormeau Avenue (Broadcasting House) were completed in 1939. thumb The Linen Quarter continues to host two of the city’s historic venues, alongside other popular music venues such as the Limelight, and some of the most famous pubs in the UK or Ireland such as the Crown Liquor Saloon, which is evidenced by its reputation as one of the most instagrammed landmarks in the UK. The bar is particularly renowned for its ten atmospheric snugs or booths which come with match-striking plates, an antique bell system to summon staff, and beautifully decorated mirrors. The Observatory bar in the Grand Central Hotel is the highest built bar in Ireland, and there are several bars that are renowned for their offering of live Irish music such as The Points and Fibber Maggee’s. Other well known bars include Pug Uglys, The Perch and Sweet Afton. The Linen Quarter hosts a wide variety of acclaimed restaurants and cafés, and includes award-winning establishments such as James St., owned by Niall McKenna, who appeared on the BBC TV series Great British Menu. The Michelin Starred Deanes EIPIC is run by Michael Deane, who has lead the restaurant revolution in Northern Ireland since opening his first restaurant in 1993. Other restaurants in the district offer cuisines ranging from Japanese fusion to traditional Irish and include Zen (Asian fusion), Nu Delhi (Indian), Red Panda (Chinese) and Fratelli’s (Italian). Transport The Belfast Hub area has long been at the heart of transport in the city, linking Belfast with the rest of the island. After plans for the Ulster Railway were announced in 1835, Belfast joined the railway revolution in 1839, when the first section from Belfast to Lisburn was opened for passenger traffic. A fitting railway terminus was built on Great Victoria Street and opened in 1848. The completion of the Dublin and Belfast Junction Railway made Victoria Street, soon known as ‘Great Victoria Street’, the terminus for one of the most important main lines in Ireland. Over the next decades commuter traffic to from neighbouring towns to Belfast grew rapidly. One of the main modes of urban transport was the horse-drawn tram, introduced by the Belfast Street Tramway Company From 1872. In the early 1900s, the network was electrified to make this form of transport more affordable. Buses were introduced by Belfast Corporation (Belfast City Council) in 1926, initially to supplement the tram service, but gradually replacing them. The last tram ran in 1954 and the last trolleybus in 1968. During the 1960s much of the original terminal at Great Victoria Street was demolished to make way for the development of the Europa Hotel and a bus station. However, in 1995 a second Great Victoria Street Station opened just yards from the site of its predecessor. Following the success of this station, a new enlarged Transport Hub is planned to replace both the existing bus station and railway station. Business & Innovation Innovation was crucial to the industrial and manufacturing boom that swept through the city from the late Victorian to Edwardian era and to the development of the Linen Quarter. Initially, it was Belfast’s cotton industry that drew thousands in from the surrounding countryside. Innovative mechanized methods of production were adopted that allowed the dramatic rise of Ireland’s mechanised linen industry. Several companies rose to global prominence by continuing this process of industrial pioneering. Andrew Mulholland, who donated the Ulster Hall’s magnificent organ, oversaw a company that built the world’s largest and one of its most advanced linen mills. Daniel Jaffe, one of the pioneers of linen in Belfast, had his Irish base at what is now the Ten Square Hotel, while Ewarts, one of the world’s greatest linen manufacturers, had a large establishment in Bedford Street. Innovation still remains a vital part of the Linen Quarter’s business community today. Arup, for example, are a community of collaborators that bring together a range of disciplines such as transport systems, energy, water management, urban design, architecture, and climate change. Several leading financial institutions, like Cunningham Coates of Linenhall Street, have also made the Linen Quarter their home. The district is currently attracting to various start-ups and established companies in the web design and tech sectors. Art and Architecture of the Linen Quarter thumb Grand Opera House, Great Victoria Street The Grand Opera House was constructed in 1894-5 to designs by Frank Matcham, the leading theatre designer of his day. The theatre was expected to accommodate opera, variety, pantomime and circus and could be adapted to fulfil the varying requirements of each type of entertainment. The Grand Opera House was declared open on 16 December 1895, a week before the opening performance, a pantomime called ‘Blue Beard’. thumb Ulster Hall, Bedford Street The Ulster Hall is a two-storey Italianate entertainment hall with double-height auditorium that is prominently located on Bedford Street in Belfast city centre. It was completed in 1862 to the designs and under the supervision of William Joseph Barre. A source of immense civic pride on its opening, the building was a sign of Belfast’s growing maturity as a town and an acknowledgement among its industrious merchants of the importance of ‘relaxation, pleasure and enjoyment’. Joseph Carey's Belfast scenes In 1902, Belfast City Council commissioned the local artist Joseph W. Carey to produce thirteen scenes from Belfast history on canvas, to be mounted within the Ulster Hall. The scenes depict the city and the surrounding area, incorporating historical and mythological influences. The paintings were restored in 1989 and again in 2009. Ewart’s Buildings This three storey sandstone building was built for the Bedford Street Weaving Company by James Hamilton of Glasgow in 1869. It was extended by James Ewart in 1883 and again, to the rear, in 1937 (though this was later demolished). In 1876 it was purchased by William Ewart and Son, one of the world’s leading linen manufacturers who owned mills, warehouses and offices throughout Belfast and beyond. thumb Broadcasting House, Ormeau Avenue The six-storey multi-bay modernist BBC Broadcasting House was completed in 1939 to the designs of architect James Millar and features a distinctive steel framed, polychromatic brick building. Broadcasting House replaced the BBC’s earlier premises on Linenhall Street which it had occupied since the creation of the first regional station in the 1920s. Ormeau Baths, Ormeau Avenue This beautiful Victorian building began life as the public baths for the South Belfast area. Desgined by Robert Watt, it opened in the late 1880s. For many local people whose houses lacked sanitation it was a godsend, not least for those working in industry. The Queen Anne Style red brick building contained both individual baths and a swimming pool and, with its sister establishments in the rest of Belfast, greatly improved hygiene in the city. The Thomas Thompson Memorial Fountain, Ormeau Avenue This fountain is located on the intersection of Bedford Street and Ormeau Avenue, facing the BBC offices. It was erected as a special memorial to Ex-naval surgeon Thomas Thompson, one of Belfast’s pioneers in the fight against cholera, who also founded the Belfast’s Charitable Home for the Incurables. The monument was commissioned by his daughter Eliza and designed by Young and MacKenzie, the preeminent Belfast architectural firm of the time. thumb St Malachy’s, Alfred Street One of the most famous, and beautiful, churches in Belfast, St Malachys, was completed in 1844. It is designed in the ecclesiastical style of the Tudor period by Thomas Jackson. The church’s famous vaulted ceiling, famously described as ‘an upside down wedding cake’, was inspired by the Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey. In 2009 a multi-million pound restoration included the renovation of the famous ceiling and the cleaning of the beautiful stained glass windows. Monument to the Unknown Woman Worker, Great Victoria Street The Monument to the Unknown Woman Worker is a 1992 bronze sculpture by Louise Walsh and is located adjacent to the Europa Hotel. It features two working-class women with symbols of women's work and domestic items such as colanders, a shopping basket and clothes pegs part of the sculpture. Notable Events In 1869 Charles Dickens reads ‘A Christmas Carol’, ‘The Pickwick Papers’ and ‘David Copperfield’ at two separate readings at the Ulster Hall. The Conservative Party in Ulster launched an anti-Home Rule campaign in February 1886. It joined with the Orange Order to organise a huge political rally in Ulster Hall at which Lord Randolph Churchill (father of Winston) gave a rousing speech that urged unionists to organise against Home Rule. The BBC opens its first studio in Linenhall Street. Actor and broadcaster Tyrone Guthrie makes the first broadcast here on 15 September 1924. Led Zeppelin debuts one of the most famous songs in rock history, ‘Stairway to Heaven’, at the Ulster Hall in 1971. In 1978, the National Trust, purchases the Crown Liquor Saloon following a public campaign led by influential conservationists including Sir John Betjeman. Famous People Associated with the Linen Quarter Francis Joy (3 August 1697 – 10 June 1790) established Belfast’s first paper mill along the Blackstaff River, on grounds near the eastern end of today’s Ormeau Avenue. Joy was an entrepreneur who founded the Belfast News Letter in 1737 (thereby making it the oldest continuously running English language daily newspaper) and developed the family business to include papermaking due to a shortage of paper for his newsletters. Joy Street is named after him. Andrew Mulholland (1791 – 24 August 1866) donated the organ to Ulster Hall in 1862. He was originally a cotton manufacturer who kick-started Belfast’s world leading mechanised linen industry by establishing the first large-scale linen mill in York Street in 1830. Sir William Ewart (22 November 1817 – 1 August 1889) was an Irish linen manufacturer based in the Ewart’s Buildings on Bedford Street. He acted as president of the Irish Linen Trade Association and was elected as mayor of Belfast in 1859. Ewart also served as Member of Parliament (MP) between 1878 until his death in 1889. Sir Otto Moses Jaffe (13 August 1846 – 29 April 1929) was a German-born British businessman who headed the family business ‘The Jaffe Brothers’ at Bedford Street (now the site of 10 Square Hotel) and managed to built it up to become the largest linen exporter in Ireland. He was elected Lord Mayor of Belfast twice due to his prominence and became the first Jewish Lord Mayor. Frank Matcham (22 November 1854 – 17 May 1920), who was the leading theatre designer during the UK theatre boom years at the end of the 19th century, was responsible for the design of Royal Opera House. During his 40-year career, he designed more than 90 theatres throughout the United Kingdom including the Hippodrome (1900), Hackney Empire (1901), London Coliseum (1903), London Palladium (1910), and the Victoria Palace (1911). Sir William Tyrone Guthrie (2 July 1900 – 15 May 1971) voiced BBC Northern Ireland’s first broadcast when it launched on 15 September 1924 from its studio located in Linenhall Street. He was an English theatrical director and broadcaster. Ruby Florence Murray (29 March 1935 – 17 December 1996) performed in the Ulster hall. A singer and actress born near the Donegall Road in south Belfast, she toured as a child singer and went on to become one of UK’s most popular singers during the 1950s. Rory Gallagher (2 March 1948 – 14 June 1995) played multiple times in Ulster Hall during the Troubles, a time when other artists generally avoided touring in Northern Ireland. As an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer, Gallagher formed the band ‘Taste’ in the late 1960s before going on to produce solo albums. ==See also== * Cathedral Quarter, Belfast ==References *Linen Hall Library Category:Quarters of Belfast ","title":"Linen Quarter, Belfast"},{"id":"20366402","text":"The Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company is a mutual insurance company which offers personal, marine, commercial property, and casualty insurance.Atlantic Mutual Companies, Meeting the Challenges of Our Time: 2001 Annual Report, 2001.

Its first chairman was Walter Restored Jones, a member of a prominent upper-class family of attorneys in New York City. The Jones family ran the company for decades. By the 1850s, Atlantic Mutual was the largest marine and general insurance firm in North America and the only marine insurance firm in New York state. During the 1850s, it made exceedingly high profits.Hunt, Lives of American Merchants, vol. 1, 1857. In 1852, the company began keeping a clipping service of newspaper accounts of shipwrecks and sinkings known as Vessel Disasters, a work which became famous as the best source of information on maritime disasters in the North Atlantic.Rousmaniere, After the Storm: True Stories of Disaster and Recovery at Sea, 2002; \\"Steam on the Atlantic,\\" New York Times, December 10, 1882. During the Civil War, Atlantic Mutual was the primary insurer of most Union shipping. In 1874, Atlantic Mutual President John Divine Jones provided the money which established the permanent foundation of the New York Historical Society.Jones and DeLancey, History of New York During the Revolutionary War, 1879. Atlantic Mutual built the existingAs of 2008. building at 45 Wall Street in 1959, which served as the company's headquarters until the mid-1970s.Bagli, \\"45 Wall St. Is Renting Again Where Tower Deal Failed,\\" New York Times, February 8, 2003. Vacant and deteriorating for more than 20 years, it was sold in 1996 and converted to apartments. Atlantic Mutual was involved in a significant tax law case which reached the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1990s. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 altered the formula under which insurance companies could deduct additions to their financial reserves. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined that Atlantic Mutual had strengthened its reserves, but the company countered that it had merely engaged in a computational change. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court upheld the IRS' interpretation of the law.Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. v. IRS, 523 U.S. 582 (1998). After the construction of the World Trade Center, Atlantic Mutual moved its headquarters from 45 Wall Street to 140 Broadway. The company was one of many which insured buildings in and around the World Trade Center, and the firm suffered significant losses after the September 11 attacks. Since Atlantic Mutual is more than 100 years old, the company is a member of The Hundred Year Association of New York.Barr, Alistair. \\"Titanic Insurer Atlantic Mutual Sinks.\\" MarketWatch. May 6, 2011. In 2010, New York state insurance regulators revoked Atlantic Mutual’s insurance licenses because it had a negative surplus. On April 27, 2011, Atlantic Mutual was placed into liquidation after the company was swamped with workers' compensation insurance claims. ==Famous shipwrecks insured by Atlantic Mutual== As the largest marine insurance firm in the United States for many years, Atlantic Mutual became involved in some of the most famous shipwrecks in American history. *SS Central America - The company insured the SS Central America, a sidewheel steamship laden with gold which sank in a hurricane in September 1857.Kinder, Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea, 1998. When the wreck was rediscovered by the Columbus-American Discovery Group, Inc. on September 11, 1987, Atlantic Mutual and 38 other insurance companies filed suit against the treasure-hunting firm, claiming that because they paid damages for the lost gold they had the right to it. In a precedent-setting court case on telepossession, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Atlantic Mutual and the other insurance companies and awarded 92 percent of the gold to the Columbus-American Group.Columbus-American Discovery Group Inc. v. Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co., 974 F.2d 450 (4th Cir., 1992). *Mary Celeste - Atlantic Mutual was also one of the insurers of the Mary Celeste, an American brigantine sailing out of Staten Island, New York.Fay, The Story of the \\"Mary Celeste\\", 1988. In December 1872, a month after leaving Staten Island for Italy, the ship was seen adrift and without her crew and no explanation for the \\"ghost ship\\" has ever successfully explained why the ship was abandoned. Atlantic Mutual established a small museum dedicated to the mystery of the Mary Celeste at its corporate headquarters, which included a model of the ship and the captain's lap desk.Godwin, This Baffling World, 1968. *RMS Titanic - The Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company also helped to insure the RMS Titanic. The ship was insured for $140,000, of which $100,000 was held by Atlantic Mutual.Eaton and Haas, Titanic: A Journey Through Time, 1999.

The memorial is cared for by local schoolchildren and the memory of the tragedy is part of the local historical consciousness. Since 1960, Romanies from Tarnów have been coming to the region to honor the memory of the victims. Since 1996 the International Romani Caravan of Memory travels around the Tarnów region to commemorate the Nazi mass murder of Romanies during World War II. The main stop of the caravan is Szczurowa where after a visit to the mass grave, a mass is held at the local church. The Tarnów region was a site of other Nazi crimes against Romanies in addition to that at Szczurowa. Most of the victim's identities and their place of burial are unknown. Other mass graves of murdered Romanies in the region include those at Bielcza (28 murdered), Borzęcin Dolny (28 murdered) and Żabno (49 murdered). The Romani people, who lived in Europe from the 15th century, were among the groups singled out by the Nazi Germany regime for persecution and were often murdered along with the Jews. Between 500,000 and 1,500,000 Romanies were killed by the Nazis throughout Europe during the Holocaust.ROMANIES AND THE HOLOCAUST: A REEVALUATION AND AN OVERVIEW ==See also== *Porajmos *List of massacres in Poland ==References * Bartosz, Adam, \\"The Gypsy Caravan of Memory Roma National Identity\\" * Kraków Post, \\"Eighth International Roma Caravan of Memory\\" * Oficjalny Portal Gminy Borzecin (Polish) * Yad Vashem Resource Center Category:Massacres in the 1940s Category:Antiziganism in Europe Category:History of the Romani people during World War II Category:Massacres in Poland Category:Nazi war crimes in Poland Category:1943 in Poland Category:Mass murder in 1943 Category:World War II massacres Category:General Government Category:August 1943 events ","title":"Szczurowa massacre"},{"id":"20366496","text":"Glamour is an online women's magazine published by Condé Nast Publications.

The magazine was published in a larger format than many of its contemporaries. It targets women 18–49 (with the median age of 33.5) and reaches a subscription audience of 1,411,061 readers in the United States. Its circulation on newsstands was 986,447, making the total average paid circulation 2,397,508. Glamour was the first women's magazine to feature an African-American cover girl when it included Katiti Kironde on the cover of its college issue in August 1968. Since 1990, the magazine has held an annual \\"Women of the Year\\" awards ceremony. On January 8, 2018, it was announced that Samantha Barry, previously the Head of Social Media and Emerging Media at CNN, would be the new Editor-in-Chief of Glamour. In November 2018, Glamour announced that its print edition would cease with its January 2019 issue in order to focus on its digital presence. == Glamour Top College Women Awards == Each year for the last 56 years, the magazine has been selecting a top ten list of outstanding college women across the country. Originally, the list was composed of the best dressed college juniors in America, but was changed for more substance with categories such as academic achievement, community service, and career goals as leading criteria. Hundreds of college juniors apply each year. Past winners, finalists include; Martha Stewart, Diane Sawyer, Swati Mia Saini, Nancy Amanda Redd, 2003 Miss Virginia (MAO) and author of Body Drama, and Tamira A.

In 2007, Lorena Ochoa won a Woman of the Year award. In 2008 the award was granted to two Yemenis: 10-year-old divorcee Nujood Ali, and the lawyer who took on her case. Nujood's courage was praised by prominent attendees, including Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice. The 2010 Glamour Woman of the Year was Cher and the 2016 Glamour Woman of the Year was Zendaya ==International editions== Glamour launched in the UK in April 2001, where it pioneered the “handbag size” format, with the tagline \\"fits in your life as well as your handbag\\".

From its launch to the final traditional issue in November 2017, the magazine was edited by Jo Elvin, with Michelle Pamment serving as acting editor briefly in 2005. In June 2009, to celebrate Glamours eighth birthday in the UK, Glamour.com made a gallery of every cover since its launch. In October 2017, following declining sales, it was announced that publication of the monthly UK edition would end at the end of 2017, and that the UK version would be a semi-annual publication. In November 2017, Deborah Joseph was appointed Chief Content Officer of Glamour UK.

Though formidable even as an individual, he and Kendra, working together, were unstoppable. Like Kendra, he has this really strange knack for managing to stay alive in the trickiest situations, even though he is often mortally wounded, and never gives up. Unlike his sister though, Seth's main trait is courage. Throughout the series, Seth and his sister learn lessons unique to each individual. ===Fablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star=== In book 2, Seth goes into a funeral home and gets bit by a statue of Olloch the Glutton causing the demon to awake and eventually grow strong enough and big enough to pursue Seth in order to eat him. Olloch devours him eventually but he survived in an impervious fairy cocoon given to him by Coulter. Seth takes a powerful courage potion and confronts the Revenant. He is successful in removing the cursed nail from the Revenant, defeating it. This allowed Kendra and Warren to pass through the revenant's territory and enter the tower. In the confrontation, Seth becomes immune to magical fear that some dark beings radiate. He also gained the ability to see some elements of darkness that are hidden to others. ===Fablehaven: Grip of the Shadow Plague=== Seth visits the demon Graulus who appears in the third book and learns that Navarog, the dragon prince, was the one released from the Quiet Box, and that he retrieved the talismanic nail Seth had removed from the Revenant, and gave it to the demon Kurisock. Meanwhile, in Lost Mesa, Kendra finds the key to another hidden preserve. Seth successfully retrieves the Chronometer and inadvertently brings Patton Burgess to the present time. Seth, Kendra and Patton then face the final battle to defeat the Shadow Plague. ===Fablehaven: Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary=== Seth gets into more trouble by stealing the first horn of a unicorn from the centaurs, their most prized possession (aka the soul of Grunhold/Ring of Stones). He finds out he is a Shadow Charmer, and many are not sure if they should trust him because Shadow Charmers are usually the villains. He is then denied from the group journeying to the dragon sanctuary Wyrmroost because of his age, (and his possible dark attributes) but that won't stop him from going. Seth sneaks into the knapsack that his sister received that holds an extra dimension. He makes friends with a giant and other creatures of the night. While at Wyrmroost Seth and his sister Kendra find out that together they could be a dragon tamer. They together slay Siletta, a poisonous salamander-like dragon, whose entire body consists of deadly poison, and many other monsters. Even after Wyrmroost, Seth is still able to laugh. ===Fablehaven: Keys to the Demon Prison=== Seth heals the demon Graulas, who steals two of the artifacts from him. Graulas kills Coulter in securing the third artifact allowing Graulas and the demon Nagi Luna to open the great demon prison Zzyzx. Seth releases the narcoblix Vanessa. Meanwhile, Kendra and Warren join forces with the Sphinx. The prison is opened and all of the demons are released. Seth kills Graulas and Nagi Luna single-handedly. Unlike his sister, who knew about traitors in particular, Seth learns a lot about the evil nature of demons. == Powers and Abilities == Seth is a Shadow Charmer, his qualities beginning to emerge in Rise of the Evening Star and being stabilized and brought to full potency in Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary. While most of his family and friends are alienated by the dark origin of his powers, Seth has never used his abilities for evil. Being a shadow charmer and an ally of night, most of his family didn't have much trust in him. It seems to be that in their opinions, Seth's accomplishments weren't as significant as Kendra's, perhaps because of the dark elements that always surrounded them. * Seth is immune to magical manipulation of emotion, from magical fear to the guilt of stealing a unicorn horn. * Seth can perceive dark elements invisible to others. * Seth can speak and understand the languages of darkness, from demons to trolls. * Seth can shade walk, meaning that away from bright light he is nearly invisible. * Seth is trusted more by dark creatures than other humans, being an ally of the night, although the degree to which this is effective varies from creature to creature, demons in particular being immune to him, although he easily befriends the sky giant Thronis and the mountain troll Udnar * Seth has a link to undead creatures, being able to hear their minds and they his (most of the time). The Sphinx (another shadow charmer) has explained that \\"[You and I] are a link to life, and they will do anything to preserve that link.\\" This makes it easier for Seth to control undead creatures. * Seth, in combination with Kendra, is a humorous dragon tamer, due to his ability to not feel magical fear and be paralyzed. * Many of Seth's abilities are never used nor discovered in the series. The Sphinx, a more advanced shadow charmer, is able to plunge a room into darkness, release dizzy spells, and lower the temperature in the same room.

After unsuccessfully challenging for the leadership of Democratic Action in 1999, he founded a new party, the Fearless People's Alliance. ==Political history== After involvement in politics in his home state of Guárico in the 1970s for Democratic Action, he served two terms in the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies (from 1984), and was elected to the Venezuelan Senate in 1994. He then served as mayor of the Libertador Municipality (1996–2000) of the Venezuelan Capital District, having been appointed governor of the now-defunct Federal District (1992–1993) by Carlos Andrés Pérez. ===Mayor of Caracas=== In 2008, he challenged pro-Chavez PSUV/Fatherland for All candidate Aristóbulo Istúriz in the 2008 Caracas mayoral election and won. Subsequent to his election, the Venezuelan National Assembly passed a Capital District Law on April 30, 2009, that transferred most functions, funding, and personnel of the Metropolitan Mayor of Caracas to a new Venezuelan Capital District (headed by Jacqueline Faría, an official directly appointed by Hugo Chavez) covering in particular the political center of Caracas and the municipality of Libertador. A legal challenge was filed and a request was filed with the National Electoral Council to hold a referendum, but these did not stop the transfer. Opponents of Chavez described the move as a deliberate negation of the popular vote, while Chavez supporters described the political and budgetary reorganization as an \\"act of justice\\" for Libertador, the largest and poorest of the five municipalities making up Caracas. Following the removal of such power, Ledezma began a hunger strike that drew international attention. ==Arrest== On February 19, 2015 he was detained by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service at his office in the EXA Tower in Caracas. In the operation, the security forces made warning shots to the air to disperse a crowd that was forming. He was then transported to SEBIN's headquarters in Plaza Venezuela. His lawyer declared that the charges for his detention were unknown. The New York Times stated that Ledezma was arrested by the Venezuelan Government after accusations made by President Nicolás Maduro about an \\"American plot to overthrow the government\\" that he presented a week before Ledezma's arrest. Ledezma mocked the accusations stating that the Venezuelan government was destabilizing itself through corruption. The United States denied the accusations by President Maduro and stated that \\"Venezuela’s problems cannot be solved by criminalizing dissent\\". He was imprisoned in Ramo Verde military jail. Two months later, he was sent back home for health reasons, where he had been placed under house arrest and unable to express himself publicly. ===Response to arrest=== Demonstrations Wall painting in Caracas demanding Ledezma's release. Following the news of the arrest of Ledezma, his supporters quickly created protests and called the arrest a \\"kidnapping\\" and that the coup conspiracy was created for political purposes. Hours after the news broke, hundreds of Ledezma supporters gathered in a Caracas plaza to denounce his arrest. Protesters also gathered outside of the SEBIN headquarters. Human rights groups Human rights groups quickly condemned Ledezma's arrest and the similarity of the case to Leopoldo López's arrest was noted by The New York Times. Amnesty International condemned Ledezma's arrest calling it politically motivated, noting the similar cases of arrests made by the Venezuelan Government in what Amnesty International described as \\"silencing dissenting voices\\". Human Rights Watch demanded his release with Human Rights Watch's Americas division director, Jose Miguel Vivanco, stating that without evidence, Ledezma \\"faces another case of arbitrary detention of opponents in a country where there is no judicial independence\\". ===Trial=== In March 2015, former socialist Prime Minister of Spain, Felipe González, agreed to take over the defense of Ledezma in his trial after Ledezma's family requested his assistance. ==Escape from house arrest== On November 17, 2017, Ledezma slipped past guards and fled to Colombia. He departed the same day from El Dorado International Airport to Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport in Madrid, Spain. Upon landing he declared he would continue his fight of opposition to the Venezuelan Government and was reunited with his family. ==Awards and recognition== * 2010 – Finalist for the 2010 World Mayor prize * 2015 – National Endowment for Democracy awarded Ledezma its Democracy Award in May 2015. * 2015 – Cádiz Cortes Ibero-American Freedom Prize was awarded \\"given the unblemished defense of freedom in your community and minimum requirements of the realization of human rights in the same, which has led them to be subject to public rebuke of their government, including the flagrant situation of imprisonment or the cutting of your minimal civil rights\\". * 2016 Courage Award, Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, shared with Leopoldo Lopez, \\"for inspiring the world with their extraordinary courage in the defense of liberty and universal human rights.\\" == References == Category:1955 births Category:People from Guárico Category:Venezuelan lawyers Category:Members of the Senate of Venezuela Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Venezuela) Category:Living people Category:Democratic Action (Venezuela) politicians Category:Mayors of places in Venezuela Category:Fearless People's Alliance politicians Category:Universidad Santa María (Venezuela) alumni Category:Prisoners and detainees of Venezuela Category:People of the Crisis in Venezuela Category:Universidad Metropolitana alumni Category:Venezuelan prisoners and detainees ","title":"Antonio Ledezma"},{"id":"20366532","text":"Yee Keung Victor Wong (; July 30, 1927 – September 12, 2001) was an American actor, artist, and journalist. A fourth-generation Chinese-American, he appeared in numerous supporting roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He is widely known for his role as Chinese sorcerer Egg Shen in John Carpenter's 1986 cult film Big Trouble in Little China, royal adviser Chen Bao Shen in the Best Picture-winning historical epic The Last Emperor, rural storekeeper Walter Chang in the Comedy horror film Tremors and Grandpa Mori Tanaka in the 3 Ninjas tetralogy. ==Early life and education== Wong was born in San Francisco and lived in Chinatown near the Stockton Street Tunnel to Chinese parents. His father, Sare King Wong, was born and raised in Guangdong province, and later moved to Shanghai as a news journalist. His mother was a devout Christian who took the family to the First Chinese Baptist Church every week. Wong was the eldest of five; his siblings were Sara Wong Lum, Zeppelin Wong, Shirley Wong Frentzel, and Betty Wong Brown. He was fluent with both English and Cantonese, which helped lead his acting career to Hong Kong. Wong and his family moved to Courtland, California when he was two years old after his father took a job as teacher and principal at a school for the children of local Chinese laborers. The family would move back to Chinatown within three years and his father would be active in local politics. He would live in Sacramento, California for much of his adult life. *a \\"For much of the past two decades—in which he had appeared in nearly 30 Hollywood films—Wong had lived in Midtown Sacramento.\\" — ¶ 3. *b \\"Unlike most Hollywood actors, Wong eschewed the fast life and glamour of Los Angeles and continued to live humbly in his unassuming Midtown Sacramento residence where he could be close to his children. — ¶ 23. Wong studied political science and journalism at the University of California, Berkeley and Theology at the University of Chicago under Paul Tillich, Reinhold Niebuhr and Martin Buber. In Chicago, Wong joined The Second City comedy troupe and stayed with Langston Hughes. Wong returned to San Francisco for the summer, taking part in a theatre production and never returning to Chicago; he resumed his studies at the San Francisco Art Institute under Mark Rothko, earning a master's degree in 1962. ==Acting career== Although he had acted in and staged productions with his first wife, Olive, who he had met after his return from Chicago, Wong was inspired by the assassination of John F. Kennedy to pursue a career in journalism, landing an on-air role for KQED's Newsroom from 1968 until 1974, when he was stricken with Bell's palsy. During his tenure on Newsroom, Wong is credited with inventing the photojournalistic essay, covering stories with his still camera and returning to narrate them in the studio. The palsy would give him his later distinctive appearance, but at the time, he felt his roles had diminished because he wasn't \\"pretty looking\\". Wong with Laureen Chew in Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart. After his news career ended, Wong turned to acting, starting in the local Asian American theatre and later landing larger roles on the stages of New York City. In October 1980, Wong made his Asian American Theater Company (AATC) debut in San Francisco by appearing in their production of Paper Angels by Genny Lim. He was on Social Security Disability Insurance at the time due to his palsy. In New York, he acted in the plays Family Devotions and Sound and Beauty, written by David Henry Hwang. His stage work led to television work and eventually, into movies; his film debut was in 1984's Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart, directed by Wayne Wang. In between film roles, Wong lived in Sacramento, California, where he supported the local performing arts. In 1992, he acted in the Hong Kong film, Cageman (笼民). He later starred as the grandfather, Mori Tanaka (strangely changed to Mori Shintaro for 3 Ninjas Kick Back), in the popular 3 Ninjas franchise, and the cult-classics, Big Trouble in Little China and Tremors. Film director Wayne Wang called Victor Wong his role model for living life. Director Bernardo Bertolucci had trouble with Wong on the set of The Last Emperor amid arguments over historical authenticity and cut most of Wong's scenes in the film, which won the Best Picture Oscar for 1987. He retired from acting in 1998 after suffering two strokes. Wong returned to art, and held a solo exhibition at the B. Sakata Garo gallery in Sacramento. ==Association with the Beat Generation== In the 1950s, while studying art under Mark Rothko, Victor Wong had his first art exhibition at the City Lights Bookstore. During this time, Wong befriended Lawrence Ferlinghetti. He illustrated Oranges, Dick McBride's first collection of poetry, which was handset and printed at the Bread and Wine Mission in 1960.McBride, R: Oranges - Illustrated by Victor Wong (Handset and printed at the Bread & Wine Press, San Francisco by Wilder Bentley, 1960) He met Jack Kerouac in the early 1960s, who chronicled their meeting in his novel Big Sur (1962). In the novel, Wong is characterised as \\"Arthur Ma\\". ==Personal life== Wong was married four times: to Olive Thurman Wong (daughter of civil rights activist Howard Thurman), Carol Freeland, Robin Goodfellow, and Dawn Rose. He had two daughters, Emily and Heather, and three sons, Anton, Lyon, and Duncan. His children Emily and Anton were from his first marriage to Olive Thurman. His son, Lyon Wong, died in 1986 after being attacked by a young man while walking home in Sacramento. Wong was asked to film the prologue scene for Big Trouble in Little China shortly after Lyon's wake; after shooting the scene, Wong suffered his first stroke. Upon learning of the events of September 11, 2001, Wong and his wife Rose spent the day trying to get news of Wong's sons, who lived in New York City (they were unharmed). After Rose went to sleep, Wong stayed up to continue following the news; he died of a heart attack at some point during the morning of September 12, at the age of 74. ==Filmography== { class = \\" sortable\\" + Film !

While a few Romanian science fiction writers were translated into English, none proved popular abroad. ==Early years== The country's earliest science fiction story is Al. N. Dariu's Finis Romaniae (1873), an alternate history short story which presents the history of Romania after the sudden death of Carol I and a revolution against the new prince, which declares Romania a republic.Manolescu, p. 190-191 The following story was Spiritele anului 3000, a utopia written two years later, in 1875, by a teenager under the pen name \\"Demetriu G. Ionnescu\\", who would later become the statesman Take Ionescu. The short story is set in the year 3000, when the earth is populated by humans of small stature who reach maturity by age 15. Politically, the monarchies have been abolished, with all the states being republics and part of a world confederation. Religion and wars have disappeared and Bucharest, a garden city, is the capital of a Romania within its natural (ethnic) borders, following a ruling from a Supreme Tribunal.Manolescu, p. 192 In the early 1900s, Victor Anestin was a notable popularizer of science who, apart from writing hundreds of articles and books about science, wrote three science fiction novels: În anul 4000 sau O călătorie la Venus (\\"In the year 4000, or A trip to Venus\\", 1899), O tragedie cerească, Poveste astronomică (\\"A Celestial Tragedy, An Astronomical Story\\", 1914) and Puterea ştiinţei, sau Cum a fost omorât Răsboiul European, Poveste fantastică (\\"The Power of Science, or How the European War was Killed, Fantasy Story\\", 1916). A Celestial Tragedy had one of the earliest descriptions of the possibility of using atomic power for war purposes, being published in February 1914, the same year as H. G. Wells' The World Set Free.Ion Hobana, \\"Nuclear War Fiction in Eastern Europe\\", in Nuclear Texts and Contexts, Fall 1989 In 1914, Henri Stahl published Un român în lună (\\"A Romanian on the Moon\\"), themed around the possibility of a moon landing.Manolescu, p. 231-233 ==Communist era== After World War II, the new communist regime supported science fiction, using it as a means of popularizing science and of ideological indoctrination. A weekly science fiction magazine, Colecţia de povestiri ştiinţifico-fantastice was founded; this was an important factor in the promotion of science fiction in Romania. The most popular writers of the era, I.M. Ştefan and Radu Nor, wrote sci-fi adventure novels which sometimes included a Marxist ideological bent. Adrian Rogoz, Sergiu Fărcăşan and Camillo Baciu were the most important science fiction writers of the era, while Vladimir Colin was the first major writer of fantasy. During the 1980s, the most notable publication of science fiction was the yearly Anticipaţia almanac, edited by Ioan Albescu. Many of the writers of the 1980s had scientific studies, which meant that their writings tended to be closer to hard science fiction. They were not very fruitful as during the 1980s, it was very difficult to get published and during the 1990s, they moved on to other fields. (For example, Cristian Tudor Popescu became a well-known journalist.) ==After 1989== After the Romanian Revolution, initially, the science fiction genre experienced a boom, as many translations which had not been accepted by the communist authorities were published. Notably, between 1992 and 2003, the Nemira publishing house turned out hundreds of translations and a few Romanian novels, among which Aşteptând în Ghermana by Dănuţ Ungureanu, the steampunk novel 2484 Quirinal Ave and the cyberpunk novel Cel mai înalt turn din Baabylon by Sebastian A. Corn.\\"Pe fundaţia SF-ului românesc este ştanţat logo-ul URSS\\", Gândul, January 31, 2008 Currently, there is a trend to focus more on fantasy rather than science fiction, with only a few publishing houses still publishing Romanian science fiction writers, among them being Amaltea and Tritonic. ==NotesReferences== *Florin Manolescu, Literatura S.F., Editura Univers, Bucharest, 1980 ","title":"Romanian science fiction"},{"id":"20366589","text":"Thirtysixstrings is the first album from Dublin-based instrumental band The Redneck Manifesto. ==Track listingReferences== Category:2001 albums Category:The Redneck Manifesto (band) albums ","title":"Thirtysixstrings"},{"id":"20366594","text":"Stephen George Watkins (born 23 March 1959) is a former English cricketer who played one first-class and one List A match for Worcestershire in 1983.

Fishing and Fishermen's Talk also translated as Fishing and Fishermen's Conversations() is the most important literary work of Croatian Renaissance poet Petar Hektorović, finished on January 14, 1556, and printed in 1568 in Venice. Ribanje is a pastoral and philosophic narrative poem in three parts in which Hektorović describes in a letter to his cousin, his three-day boat trip from Hvar to Brač and Šolta, accompanied by a pair of Hvar fishermen, Paskoje Debelja and Nikola Zet. As a literary piece Ribanje has been variously classified in Croatian literary history as an epistle, as a fishermen eclogue or epic poem, and at other times as a documentary travelogue. ==Content and analysis== According to its content Ribanje is the first piece of Croatian literature written in verse in which travel is not described allegorically, but as a real journey, describing the beauties of nature and homeland. It's a travelogue of a Renaissance man who enjoys nature and considers it to be a refuge for man's spirit where it can achieve complete relaxation and invigoration. Ribanje is the first described tourist journey of a modern, Renaissance man in Croatian literature; it is a first piece of Croatian culture in which world is described by parameters of human's concrete, earthly needs. To sum it up, Ribanje is the first secular, mimetic, realistic travelogue of Croatian literature. In the poem the narrator—the poet himself—describes his journey across Adriatic islands and recounts events that he and his co-travellers experienced along the path. The narrator, great aesthetic and sensitive to beauty, often describes the landscape the company sailed through, admiring the beauties of his homeland. The descriptive accounts of Ribanje combine the narrative parts in which events of the journey are detailed, along with the fishermens' complaints, dialogues and conversations. The poet-narrator often cites the conversation of the fishermen, quoting the truth, as he sees it, of their wise sayings and intelligent conversations. Hektorović meticulously recorded the songs sung by the fishermen along the way, making this one of the earliest examples in Croatian literature to include transcribed folk music within the text. There are two bugaršćicas and three short songs, toasts or honorific songs, sung alternatively by the fishermen. This makes Ribanje a work that makes an interesting and aesthetically valuable synthesis, a blending of artistic and folk literature. ==Translations== The work has been translated from Croatian to English as Fishing and fishermen's conversation by Edward Dennis Goy in 1979. In 1999 Matica hrvatska published a facsimile reprint of the edition princeps of Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje, with parallel translation to modern standard Croatian, conducted by Marko Grčić. The only two extant copies of the first edition are held at the library of Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. ==Movie adaptations== A feature film adaptation of the work by Croatian film director Milan Trenc, starring Rade Šerbedžija as Hektorović and Leon Lučev as Paskoje, was released in 2020.https://www.pulafilmfestival.hr/hr/filmovi/3617https://www.havc.hr/img/newsletter/files/dugi%20igrani_obrazlozenje_final_15052017.pdf ==References * Fishing and Fishermen’s Conversations in libraries (WorldCat catalog) * Fishing and Fishermen’s Conversations - finished on January 14th, 1556, and published in Venice in 1568 Category:16th- century poems Category:Croatian poems Category:Narrative poems Category:1556 works Category:16th century in Croatia Category:1568 books ","title":"Fishing and Fishermen's Talk"},{"id":"20366608","text":"Belsky () is a Russian surname.

The hotel opened on January 1, 1886 and had 250 guest rooms. It was situated on a site bounded by Osceola Avenue and Lake Osceola and sat at the eastern end of New England Avenue . Many people referred to it as the grand resort of Florida. At that time, wagons, carriages and bicycles were the only common modes of local transportation. The hotel operated its own street railway which ran from the South Florida Railroad station up New England Avenue, a distance of approximately ⅓ of a mile to the hotel. A slight extension down Chase/Ollie Avenue from the hotel to the Orlando and Winter Park (AKA: The Dinky Line) Railroad station and dock on Lake Virginia was completed after that railroad opened. Riding the horse drawn streetcar, hotel guests avoided the bumpy, sandy streets surrounded by posh comforts of velvet, brass and polished native and exotic hardwood finishes. Indeed, all of the streetcars manufactured by the John Stephenson Company in New York City, were state-of-the-art and on the cutting edge of urban transportation development. Many of these passengers came to Winter Park in the winter months to escape the snow and frigid temperatures of the North. In its early years, the hotel was able to attract many wealthy northerners using luxuries such as gaslights and steam heating. The hotel featured a 42 x 100 foot beautiful formal dining room, many parlors, suites with open fireplaces, a barbershop, laundry services, and a 567 foot long colonnaded porch. Guests could take the elevator to view the surrounding area from the promenade on the top of the hotel. For the guests entertainment, the hotel provided a bowling alley, a billiard hall, tennis and croquet grounds, and an orchestra for dancing. Other activities including horseback riding, fishing, and sailing on Lake Osceola in sailboats and steam yachts provided by the hotel. Along with neighboring Rollins College, the hotel and college brought luxury to the edge of the Florida frontier. The college’s opening offered many job opportunities around the Orlando area. For African-Americans living on the west side of Winter Park, this was crucial. Many young African-Americans were able to find jobs at the Seminole Hotel and earn decent wages. On February 24, 1888, President Grover Cleveland visited the Seminole Hotel, along with several senators and prominent citizens from the nation's capital. The original Seminole Hotel burned to the ground in September, 1902. In 1912, a second, smaller Seminole Hotel was built. The new hotel was located on East Webster Avenue and sat on the banks of Lake Osceola. This hotel was torn down in 1970.http://archives.rollins.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/wpandcfl/id/434/rec/1 ==Job opportunities for the African-American community== The Seminole offered African-Americans many such service jobs. Women could find work at the hotel as maids or cooks, while African-American men were hired as bellhops or baggage carriers. Many of the employees of the Seminole Hotel who lived in Winter Park year-round acquired other jobs through their connections at the hotel. The majority of the hotel’s business came during the winter months, leaving most employees free to seek other jobs during the summer months. Through their association with affluent white hotel guests, local African- Americans procured off-season jobs maintaining gardens and orange crops for the wealthy people who returned north for the summer, leaving their Florida properties in need of maintenance. This was highly beneficial for the African- American families in Winter Park, because with the right connections this guaranteed work all year round. ==References External links == * Winter Park History and Archives Collection Winter Park History.

He was best known for his strong support for Marxist-Leninist ideology in culture. ==Journalist== Born in Iași in 1918, Ignat graduated from the Spiru Haret High School of Bucharest in 1936 and continued his studies at the University of Bucharest. Nestor Ignat joined the Romanian Communist Party while it was still illegal. In 1944 he joined the staff of the Scânteia newspaper, where he was appointed editor. Working with the chief editor Sorin Toma and deputy chief editor Silviu Brucan, Nestor Ignat wrote editorial attacking the non-communist political parties and vocally demanding the sentencing to death of their leaders. This part of his activity is often quoted as an example of an expression of the Stalinist ideological excesses and intolerance.Ioan Lăcustă -1953. La Consiliul de Ministri: În presă puţină teamă n-ar strica – Vladimir Tismăneanu -Dubioasa convertire a lui Silviu Brucan – Revista 22, 29 September 2006 Nestor Ignat's journalistic activity focused mainly on the ideological aspects. A staunch supporter of proletcultism, he defended the ideological purity of the socialist society and exposed the \\"bourgeois\\" intellectuals.Concluziile Raportului final al Comisiei Prezidentiale pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din Romania – 2006 He also published articles in literary magazines where he exposed not only the writers which he considered as being \\"reactionary\\" but also communist critics who were insufficiently pugnacious. An example is his study on Lucian Blaga published in Viaţa Românească in which he wrote: > \\"Now when justice is under way for sentencing big and small criminals, it is > our duty to denounce, to dispel all confusion, to tear off masks however > well they might be composed, to through light into the darkness where > fascism swarmed.

A typical article of this period is a criticism of Anatol E. Baconsky, editor in chief of the magazine \\"Steaua\\" published by the Cluj section of the Writers' Union of Romania. This time Nestor Ignat disagrees with Baconsky's study of Mateiu Caragiale, accusing him of moving away from Marxism and from the \\"Leninist methods of revaluation of cultural heritage\\", of ignoring socialist realism and militant literature.Nestor Ignat – False modele – Scînteia, No 4201, 26 April 1958; No 4202, 27 April 1958Magda Wächter – Revenirea la modernitate. A.E. Baconsky şi Steaua – Steaua, No. 4-5, 2007. Nestor Ignat held important functions in various professional organizations. He was chairman of the Union of Journalists and member of the National Council on the Romanian State Radio and Television Networks. He was also dean of the Faculty of Journalism of the University of Bucharest, giving up his position after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Though he remained close to the higher hierarchy of the Romanian Communist Party, he became less active after Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's death. In 1974, at the 11th Congress of the Communist Party, he was not elected a member of the Central Committee, although he had been proposed by his County Organization. There were only two political figures whose candidacy was rejected by the Congress.Anneli Maier – Cultural and Ideological Aspects of the 11th Rumanian Party Congress – Radio Free Europe, 13 December 1974 ==Poet and writer== Nestor Ignat started writing poems while he was still in university, one of his first being \\"Magic\\" (Magie) published in 1939 in the \\"Jurnalul literar\\": { width=\\"100%\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Coloane negre cresc în jur solemne Si rotitoarea boltă stă pe loc, Apele fug în cercuri mari de foc, E noaptea plină de ciudate semne. ...

Then I start answering in strange whispers The rigid spheres start listening In my mind the occult number rises And I feel that I am growing, as night's enormous wizard.  } After his involvement in politics, Nestor Ignat published works attempting to present a marxist-leninist interpretation of Romanian writers. A first such volume analyzed the journalistic activity of Mihai Eminescu, emphasizing the poet's political views. His major volume \\"On the revaluation of the cultural heritage\\" is more comprehensive and covers the marxist presentation of many Romanian contemporary writers. > \\"The Byzantinist mystic, the wild chauvinism, the glorification of the > fascist \\"superman\\" and the exhortation of blind submission to the will of > fascist leaders, the myth of blood and the worship of death, the > idealization of patriarchal retardment and of the return to the Middle Ages > – spread by traitors such as Nichifor Crainic, Radu Gyr, Aron Cotruş, Mircea > Eliade and other representatives of hooliganism in literature – had precise > and outspoken class related goals; their school raised the gangs of > murderers of the Iron Guard.\\"Nestor Ignat – Cu privire la valorificarea > moştenirii culturale Nestor Ignat continued his attacks previous against Lucian Blaga published in literary magazines: > For instance, Lucian Blaga's writings are a meeting point of all western > decadent philosophical and literary trends.

Blaga's entire work is an expression of putrid bourgeois > ideology and foredoomed to perish at the same time with the class it has > served. While Nestor Ignat indicates the critical way in which Communist Party considered national cultural heritage, his book acidly characterizes various Romanian writers, without presenting an analysis or a justification of those views. However, after Joseph Stalin's death, Nestor Ignat did not publish any other books on similar topics. His later works dealt with a presentation of Mexican Muralism or with impressions from his various travels and were devoid of political activism. He had shown concern for painting even before, having supported the activity of painters. Thus, he had written the presentation of painter George Ştefănescu for the latter's solo exhibition at the \\"Gheorghe Tattarescu Museum\\" in 1965. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Nestor Ignat published o booklet with his poems, which a completely different worldview. As the poems were written at the same time when Ignat was an active supporter of Communist extremist, their publication does not reflect a change of mind after the collapse of the Communist regime. In 1999 he published a Romanian translation of the originally in French written doctoral thesis of Alice Voinescu on neo-Kantianism and the Marburg school (Paris 1912). The same year, Nestor Ignat published some memoirs on Nae Ionescu, who had been one of his professorsNestor Ignat – Însemnările inedite despre curs şi o mărturie – In Nae Ionescu: Curs de metafizică, Bucureşti, Editura Roza Vânturilor, 1999 The topic is unexpected for a journalist and indicates the variety of Nestor Ignat's areas of interest. ==Graphic artist== Nestor Ignat also had talent as graphic artist. The booklet with his poems, published in 1996, also included reproductions of some of Ignat's drawings.Dumitru Micu – Grafica Lui Nestor Ignat Other drawings were also selected as illustrations for a bibliophile reprint of Geo Bogza's \\"Offensive Poem\\"Poemul invectivă (Banderolă : \\"Bogza – 90) In 2004, age 86, Nestor Ignat had his first exhibition as a graphic artist at the \\"I.C. Petrescu\\" library in Bucharest. His 64 drawings are essentially expressionistic, but also reflect influences of other modern art movements such as constructivism, futurism, cubism or surrealism. His drawings entitled \\"Totalitarism\\", \\"Limbs\\", \\"War and Peace\\", \\"Sic transit gloria mundi\\", \\"End of a Century\\", \\"Jungle\\", \\"War\\", \\"At the Gates of Hell\\", \\"Big Bang\\", \\"Walpurgis Night\\", etc., present the terrifying contemporary hysteria and dementia, the desacralization of human existence, the bestialization of human beings. The drawings seen to reflect the artist's profound anxiety, the impossibility of finding an interior peace.Nestor Ignat – debut la senectute – Cronica Română, 8 October 2004 Grafica lui Ignat – Ziua, 30 September 2004. Part of his drawings were presented at the \\"Sicardi Gallery\\" in Houston. ==Legacy== Contemporary historians investigating the history of Communism, mention Nestor Ignat as a journalist who was notorious in his rigid presentation of extreme Marxist-Leninist interpretation of the national culture, in purging the names of important Romanian writers for even minor non-conformist opinions and severely criticizing any other writer who dared be less intransigent. The influence of such views persisted long after the Stalin's death. Nestor Ignat's name is nearly always mentioned along with other political activist with whom he collaborated such as Silviu Brucan. While it would be difficult to deny this ideological activity, which is clearly illustrated by his writings, Nestor Ignat's personality is significantly more complex. Even after the relative thaw after the fall of Stalinism or after the collapse of the communist regimes, Nestor Ignat was unapologetic, never denied the opinions expressed in his writing and never attempted to justify or to explain them. Except for the period from 1945 to 1955, Nestor Ignat's publications show a completely different ideological picture. The poems published before 1944, such as \\"Magic\\" are impregnated with a mysticism similar with the one found in Blaga's works, which he later exposed as a sign of bourgeois decadence. His publications of the 1972–1980 seem to avoid ideological involvement. His study of neo-Kantianism presents an idealistic philosophy opposed to materialism. His drawings are influenced by the artistic avant-garde of the years between the two world wars and does not have the slightest connection with the socialist realism which he himself had supported as the only viable artistic expression. These different approaches are however not the result of an evolution of Nestor Ignat's thinking. They seem to have coexisted. As opposed to other communist ideologists of the post-war era, to whom he is compared, Nestor Ignat did not try to rise in the political hierarchy of the Communist Party. While he did have important positions in the professional union of journalists and in the Faculty of Journalism, which both required an allegiance to the party, Nestor Ignat tried to limit his involvement strictly to journalism and avoided the party bureaucracy. The reasons why his candidacy for a membership in the party's central committee was rejected has never been investigated or explained by analysts. Ignat remains a controversial figure, still raising many unanswered questions. He died in August 2016 at the age of 98. ==Works== * Nestor Ignat – Eminescu publicist – Bucureşti, Editura pentru Literatură, 1950. * Nestor Ignat – O carte despre frumuseţea vieţii noi – Bucureşti, Editura pentru Literatură, 1950. * Nestor Ignat – Cu privire la valorificarea moştenirii culturale – Bucureşti, Editura de Stat pentru Literaturã şi Artã, 1954. * Nestor Ignat – Pictori muralisti mexicani – Bucureşti, Editura Meridiane, 1972. * Nestor Ignat – Din albumul unui călător – Bucureşti, Editura Sport Turism, 1980. * Nestor Ignat – Poezii – Bucureşti, Editura Bibliotecii Centrale Pedagogice, 1996. * Alice Voinescu, Nestor Ignat – Kant şi şcoala de la Marburg – Bucureşti, Editura Eminescu, 1999. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Romanian academics Category:Romanian cartoonists Category:Romanian communists Category:Romanian illustrators Category:Romanian journalists Category:Romanian writers Category:People from Bucharest Category:Spiru Haret National College (Bucharest) alumni Category:University of Bucharest alumni ","title":"Nestor Ignat"},{"id":"20366793","text":"The 1933 Ohio State Buckeyes football team represented Ohio State University in the 1933 Big Ten Conference football season.

However, with a weakening Mughal Empire, the Madrasa closed between 1790 and 1791, but with the support of local nobility, an oriental college for literature, science and art, was established at the site in 1792. It stood just outside the walled city of Delhi outside the Ajmeri Gate, near Paharganj close to the New Delhi railway station. It was originally surrounded by a wall and connected to the walled city fortifications and was referred to as the College Bastion.\\"Plan of Delhi and its environs,\\" by Edward Weller, for the \\"Weekly Dispatch,\\" published in 1857, Retrieved 12 January 2018 It was reorganized as the 'Anglo Arabic College' by the British East India Company in 1828 to provide, in addition to its original objectives, an education in English language and literature. The object was “to uplift” what the Company saw as the “uneducated and half- barbarous people of India.” Behind the move was Charles Trevelyan, the brother-in-law of Thomas Babingdon Macaulay, the same infamous Macaulay whose famously declared that “a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia”.The Delhi College Traditional Elites, the Colonial State, and Education before 1857, The Madrasa of Ghaziu'd-Din Khan at Delhi, Ebba Koch Rev.

Dr. Sprenger, then principal, presided over the founding of the college press, the Matba‘u ’l-‘Ulum and founded the first college periodical, the weekly Qiranu ’s-Sa‘dain, in 1845. Another cultural intermediatory was Mohan Lal Kashmiri, diplomat, and author, who worked for the East India Company and was educated at the college. It was renamed Zakir Husain College in 1975 by Indira Gandhi government after Dr. Zakir Husain, a distinguished educator and a President of India. The college was later shifted to its present building outside Turkman Gate in 1986, the old structure in the Madrasa Ghaziuddin complex, still houses a hostel for the college. It was declared a heritage monument by the ASI in 2002.

Their best known songs were covers of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Purple Haze\\" and The Beatles' \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", along with originals \\"Usin' My Life\\" and \\"Stay!\\". Their first two albums were engineered by Martin Birch. Though the band was not commercially successful outside of their own country, they were a popular live act because of their ferocity, musicianship and stage antics. Most notably when lead guitarist Vic Vergeat played the guitar with his teeth. Their concerts were often compared to those of Jimi Hendrix. The band went through lineup changes during its history, but the longest lasting and most consistent lineup was Vic Vergeat: lead guitar and vocals, Werner Fröhlich: bass and vocals and Cosimo Lampis: drums.Toad Trilogy 3CD Set: Toad, Tomorrow Blue, Dreams-Akarma AK 083/3 liner notes ==History== In 1970, European psychedelic rock band Brainticket was about to release their first album, featuring Werner Fröhlich on bass and Cosimo Lampis on drums. They departed the group and formed Toad with Vittorio 'Vic' Vergeat, who was briefly in the British space rock group Hawkwind, playing guitar. They began writing and recording material for their first album in late 1970, and in 1971, Toad released their self-titled album and the single \\"Stay!,\\" which did fairly well and made a great deal of headway in the Swiss charts: a feat that no other hard rock band had ever accomplished in that country. The album was mixed by the legendary British producer Martin Birch (who also produced for Deep Purple, Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath). The album also features Benjamin \\"Beni\\" Jaeger on vocals, who would leave once the album was finished. As their first album was being released in 1971, Toad performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival that was recorded live by the Swiss Television, but the footage was lost and to date there seems to be no further copy. In 1972, the band released Tomorrow Blue, which was in a more blues direction and without a lead vocalist (with Vergeat and Fröhlich taking over vocal duties). Like their first album, it was engineered by the British record producer Martin Birch. The album also included Helmut Lipsky on violin, who played prominently on the tracks \\"Blind Chapman's Tales\\", \\"Change In Time\\" and the single \\"Green Ham.\\" Later the same year, the band recorded the album Open Fire: Live in Basel 1972 which included covers of Hendrix's \\"Red House\\" and the Band of Gypsys \\"Who Knows.\\" They waited until 1974 to release their third album, Dreams, which featured the popular single 'Purple Haze'. After that, their history remains largely undocumented except for a live album recorded in Geneva during 1978 and a studio album released in the early 1990s with different versions of the band. The rest of the 1970s and 1980s were spent appearing on a few compilations, releasing live albums and performing while slowly fading into relative obscurity. Somewhere between 1979 and 1988, original bassist Werner Fröhlich left the group and was replaced by Kelvin Bullen, and after he too departed from the group in the early 1990s was replaced by André Buser who would remain with the band until its demise. In 1986, Toad made an appearance at the \\"St. Gallen Open Air Festival\\" in St. Gallen, Switzerland. During 1993, Toad released the studio album, Stop This Crime. Following its release, original drummer Cosimo Lampis departed from the group and was replaced by Claudio Salsi, who remained until Toad broke up. After Lampis departed from the band, he went on to create a school in Sardinia. In 1994, Toad played a concert in Brienz, Switzerland, which provided the material for the live album, The Real Thing. In about 1995, Toad broke up. Following Toad's demise, the album Hate To Hate was released, it contained the same tracks as Stop This Crime, but with a different cover and title. After Toad, Vegeat went on a solo career, releasing many albums over the years. He then formed and toured with his own band, The Vic Vergeat Band. He still records and plays live to this day (mostly in Europe). The other former members went on to other groups or retired from the music business. The band never achieved great success outside of their own country, but were influential on the Swiss heavy metal movement during the 1980s, influencing Krokus and Celtic Frost. They have seen renewed interest in the early 2000s among the European hard rock scene. Their albums have been re-released and remastered for new generation of listeners and a CD boxed set, packaged to look like miniature vinyl records was released. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== * 1971 - Toad * 1972 - Tomorrow Blue * 1974 - Dreams * 1993 - Stop This Crime * 1995 - Hate to Hate * 2003 - B.U.F.O (Blues United Fighting Organization) * 2004 - Behind the Wheels ===Live albums=== * 1973 - Open Fire: Live in Basel 1972 * 1978 - Yearnin' Learnin': Live 1978 (recorded live in Geneva) * 1994 - The Real Thing (recorded live in Brienz) * 2005 - Live at St. Joseph (Basel) 22.04.1972 (copy from Live at St. Joseph) ===Compilation albums=== * 1978 - The Best of Toad * 1979 - Tomorrow Blue * 1992 - Rarities * 1999 - Toad Trilogy * 2003 - Toad Box ===Singles=== * 1971 - Stay!/Animal's World * 1971 - I Saw Her Standing There/Green Ham * 1972 - Fly/No Need * 1975 - Purple Haze/Making You Feel Right * 1977 - Baby You/I'm Going ==Filmography== *1971 - Montreux Jazz Festival (recorded live by Swiss Television) *1978 - Toad on the Road (directed by Paul Grau) *1986 - St. Gallen Open Air Festival *1994 - The Real Thing (recorded live in Brienz) ==Band membersOriginal members=== * Benjamin \\"Beni\\" Jaeger - vocals * Vittorio \\"Vic\\" Vergeat - guitar, vocals, keyboard, piano, mellotron * Werner Fröhlich - bass, vocals, moog synthesizer * Cosimo Lampis - drums, congas, percussion, vocals ===Later members=== * André Buser - bass * Caesar Perrig - bass * Kelvin Bullen - bass * Claudio Salsi - drums ==See also== * Swiss rock * Brainticket * Jimi Hendrix * Deep Purple * Iron Maiden * Black Sabbath * Martin Birch ==ReferencesSources== * * Toad Trilogy 3CD Set: Toad, Tomorrow Blue, Dreams-Akarma AK 083/3 liner notes Category:Musical groups established in 1971 Category:Swiss hard rock musical groups Category:Swiss rock music groups ","title":"Toad (band)"},{"id":"20366937","text":"The D Las Vegas Casino Hotel (formerly Fitzgeralds) is a 34-story, 638-room hotel and casino in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada, owned and operated by Derek and Greg Stevens. The D Las Vegas also consists of a dinner theater called Showroom at the D. The D is located at the eastern end of the Fremont Street Experience. It has a casino, several restaurants, a business center, and a pool. The casino has more than 1,000 slot machines and 22 table games located on two floors. It is the tallest building in downtown Las Vegas and the second-tallest inside the city limits, having been surpassed by Allure Las Vegas in 2007. As Fitzgeralds, it had a \\"luck of the Irish\\" theme, with shamrocks and a leprechaun. In fall 2012, The D completed a property-wide renovation and rebranding to replace the Irish theme. == History Sundance Hotel (1980-1987)=== The Sundance Hotel opened on July 2, 1980 on land owned by Moe Dalitz. Dalitz, an organized crime figure, faced difficulty from the Gaming Commission, so the casino was nominally run by his associates, Al Sachs and Herb Tobman, who also owned the Stardust and Fremont casinos. In 1983, Sachs and Tobman faced suspension of their gaming licenses due to charges of skimming. Dalitz applied to manage the Sundance himself, but the Gaming Commission stalled on his application, until July 1984, when he agreed to surrender management to Jackie Gaughan until the casino could be sold. ===Fitzgeralds Hotel and Casino (1987-2012)=== Former casino front under the Fitzgeralds name. Finally, in 1987, the Sundance was sold to Lincoln Management Group (later Fitzgeralds Gaming) and renamed as Fitzgeralds Las Vegas. In December 2001, with Fitzgeralds Gaming in bankruptcy, The Majestic Star Casino, LLC, owned by Don Barden, bought the property, along with two other Fitzgeralds casinos in Colorado and Mississippi, for a total of $149 million. At that point, Barden became the first African American casino owner in Las Vegas. Barden separated Fitzgeralds Las Vegas from the Majestic Star umbrella two years later, to free it from restrictions imposed by the company's lenders. Barden began a multimillion-dollar renovation of the property, including the buffet, steakhouse, and showroom. New exterior paint was also applied. The renovations were successful and resulted in increased customer visitation. In February 2006, Barden announced that a nearby office building had been purchased for relocation of his company, Barden Nevada Gaming, which had been operating on the 12th floor of Fitzgeralds. The move would free up space in Fitzgeralds that could be redeveloped. In May 2008, it was reported that Barden was pledging the property to generate a $35-million equity stake in a slots-only casino in Pittsburgh, making a sale likely for Fitzgeralds Las Vegas. It was subsequently reported, however, that Barden had no need to sell Fitzgeralds to maintain a stake in the slots-only casino in Pittsburgh and that it would remain an asset which he could use to generate cash for his struggling gambling portfolio. In October 2011, several months after Barden's death, his estate sold Fitzgeralds to brothers Derek and Greg Stevens, majority owners of the Golden Gate casino. Derek took a 78% ownership share, with 22% for Greg. ===The D Las Vegas (2012-present)=== The new owners completed a $22 million renovation and rebranding to become the D Las Vegas in Fall 2012. The letter D stands for \\"downtown\\", and also refers to Derek Stevens' nickname, and the Stevens' hometown of Detroit. The remodel gave the property a more modern feel, including the addition of dancing dealers in table games. The second-floor casino has a \\"Vintage Vegas\\" theme featuring the only operational Sigma Derby game in Las Vegas. The multimillion-dollar renovation upgraded all of the guest rooms and created luxury suites. The D also added a fine Italian steakhouse, Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse, and opened the first American Coney Island outside of Michigan on the building's Fremont Street frontage. The property also features three distinct bars: Longbar, said to be the longest bar in Nevada at just fewer than 100 feet long; D Bar – a permanent outdoor bar on Fremont Street Experience featuring flair bartenders as well as dancing bartenders; and Vue Bar inside the second floor casino. The property's Fremont Street façade was enhanced with the addition of an exterior escalator and interactive video exhibition created by former Cirque du Soleil producer Roger Parent, which together feature more than 40 giant flat-screen monitors combined with hundreds of feet of LED signage. Parent is also responsible for the casino's interior escalator which uses LED technology and music depicting vintage imagery to transport guests to the vintage second-floor casino. In February 2017, The D added an exterior video wall promoted as the \\"World's Largest Keno Board\\", displaying a live feed of keno numbers as they're drawn inside the casino. In 2013, the D expanded into hosting martial arts events as the venue hosted Lion Fight 11, a Muay Thai Tournament. The main event featured a match between Tetsuya Yamato, former WBC Muay Thai Japan Champion, and Kevin Ross, an American Muay Thai boxer. In addition, Lion Fight 11 was featured on AXS TV, a company founded by Mark Cuban. In late 2013, the D became the first casino in the world to accept bitcoin for hotel rooms, restaurants, and gift shop items. Additionally, a bitcoin ATM was installed next to the gaming floor where customers can buy and sell bitcoin instantly for cash.http://www.fastcompany.com/3035594/why- bitcoin-is-poised-to-win-big-in-las-vegas ==References * Category:Casinos in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Downtown Las Vegas Category:Skyscraper hotels in Las Vegas Category:Hotels established in 2012 Category:2012 establishments in Nevada Category:Casino hotels ","title":"The D Las Vegas"},{"id":"20366949","text":"The IBM 3101 ASCII Display Station, and IBM's subsequent products, the 3151/315X and 3161/316X, were display terminals with asynchronous serial communication (start-stop signaling) that were used with a variety of IBM and non-IBM computers during the 1980s–90s, especially the data processing terminals on non-IBM minicomputers, IBM Series/1 and IBM AIX computers.

The battle was fought to relieve the French garrison of Tuyên Quang, under siege by the Tang Jingsong's Yunnan Army and Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army. The French commander at Yu Oc, Colonel Jacques Duchesne, would later distinguish himself as the conqueror of Madagascar (1895).Huguet, 23–43 and 49–54; Lecomte, 141–7; Nicolas, 385–6; Thomazi, Conquête, 237–9; Histoire militaire, 101–2 == Background == The French installed a post at Tuyên Quang in June 1884, in the wake of their capture of Hưng Hóa and Thái Nguyên. Tuyên Quang, an isolated settlement on the Clear River, was the most westerly French outpost in Tonkin, and was more than 100 kilometres away from the French garrisons in Hưng Hóa and Thái Nguyên. During the summer and autumn of 1884 the post was garrisoned by two companies of the 1st Battalion, 1st Foreign Legion Regiment (Captains Chmitelin and Broussier), under the command of chef de bataillon Frauger.Lecomte, 141 The outbreak of the Sino-French War on 23 August 1884 exposed the post to attack by Tang Jingsong's Yunnan Army and Liu Yongfu’s Black Flag Army. Supply difficulties delayed the Chinese concentration around Tuyen Quang, but advance elements of the Yunnan Army began to harass the post on 12 October 1884, and Frauger's garrison had to fight off a number of nuisance attacks by the Chinese between 13 and 19 October. Malaria had also taken a heavy toll of Frauger's men, and by the end of October 170 men out of the garrison's total strength of 550 men were unfit for duty.Lecomte, 141–3; Thomazi, Conquête, 237–8; Histoire militaire, 101 Revolver runs the gauntlet of the Chinese defences at Yu Oc, October 1884 During October and November 1884 the Farcy gunboats Revolver and Mitrailleuse, based at Tuyen Quang, and the gunboats Bourrasque, Éclair, Mutine and Trombe, operating out of Hưng Hóa, mounted a number of dangerous supply runs along the Clear River between Hung Hoa and Tuyen Quang in support of the small French garrison at Tuyen Quang. The first supply run, made by Revolver and Mitrailleuse on 15 October 1884, was successful, but at the end of October the Black Flags occupied Yu Oc, cutting off Tuyên Quang by land from the nearest French post at Hung Hoa and also commanding the river route to Tuyên Quang. A few days earlier the gunboat Mutine had been ordered to reinforce Revolver and Mitrailleuse at Tuyên Quang, but she ran aground during her voyage up the Clear River and Éclair had to be sent to pull her off and tow her back to Hung Hoa.Lecomte, 142; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 101 During the first half of November the French suffered a constant dribble of casualties as their gunboats sailing up and down the Clear River were engaged by the Black Flags at Yu Oc. In an engagement on 12 November Trombe suffered casualties of 1 man dead and 7 wounded. On one occasion Revolver had to steam at full speed to break a barrage laid across the Clear River, and on 16 November her crew sustained casualties of 2 men dead and 3 wounded (including the commander, enseigne de vaisseau de Balincourt) from enemy fire from Yu Oc.Lecomte, 116–17 and 142; Thomazi, Conquête, 237–8 The commander of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps General Louis Brière de l'Isle, reacted swiftly to the attack on Revolver on 16 November. Foreseeing further such attacks, he decided to despatch an expedition immediately to clear the Black Flags away from Yu Oc. At the same time, a food convoy would leave by water by resupply and relieve the garrison of Tuyên Quang. A column of five infantry companies with supporting artillery was formed at Hung Hoa under the command of Lieutenant- Colonel Jacques Duchesne.Duchesne’s column consisted of the 3rd and 4th Companies, 1st Foreign Legion Battalion (Captains de Borelli and Moulinay), the 25th and 28th Companies, 1st Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Chanu and Herbin), the 8th Company, 1st Tonkinese Rifle Regiment (Captain Dia) and Lieutenant Derappe’s section of Vintemberger’s battery. Chef de bataillon Bouguié and Captain Cattelin were in overall command of the two marine infantry companies and the two Legion companies respectively.Lecomte, 143–4; Thomazi, Conquête, 238 Duchesne's column set out for Tuyên Quang on the morning of 18 November. The French troops were ferried aboard a flotilla of junks, escorted by the four gunboats based at Hưng Hóa, to a point 7 kilometres above Yu Oc. The troops went ashore on the afternoon of 18 November on the right bank of the Clear River, and began marching slowly, in single file, towards Yu Oc and Tuyên Quang. By the evening of 18 November the column was within a few hours' march of Yu Oc. No sign of the enemy had yet been seen.Lecomte, 144 == The battle of Yu Oc, 19 November 1884== Map of the Battle of Yu Oc, 19 November 1884 At dawn on 19 November the column set out for Yu Oc. Herbin and Chanu's marine infantry companies led the way. The artillery followed and the two Legion companies brought up the rear. The marsouins advanced in silence, but they knew that the Chinese were aware of their march. At around 7 a.m. three shots were fired at the head of the column. The Chinese scouts were warning their comrades that the French were coming. The marine infantry continued to advance, waiting for the Chinese to show themselves. Minutes later the advance guard came under fire from three sides from Chinese skirmishers. The Chinese were deployed across the path, in the woods to its west, and on the further bank of the Clear River. Duchesne ordered the two marine infantry companies to make a frontal attack on the Chinese blocking position, while de Borelli's Legion company simultaneously attacked the enemy's right flank. The three companies deployed, and after taking the Chinese position under a crossfire, de Borelli's legionnaires charged and overran the Chinese front line. Lieutenant Goeury and two men of his platoon were wounded in this assault. The Chinese fled, unmasking 300 metres to the rear a fortified position of considerable strength, in the middle of which a large tree could be seen. The marine infantry tried to push on towards the main Chinese position, but all their efforts to advance further were checked by a heavy weight of fire. For more than two hours they remained pinned down in front of the Black Flag lines, under fire from both their front and from skirmishers on the eastern bank of the river. As the marsouins exchanged shots with their tormentors, losses began to mount in their ranks. One officer, Lieutenant Schuster, was killed. Derappe's guns did their best to support them, splitting their fire between the Chinese fort and the enemy skirmishers across the river. Eventually both the infantry and the gunners began to run short of ammunition, and there was no sign of the gunboats of the flotilla.Lecomte, 144–5 Lieutenant Goeury of the French Foreign Legion, wounded at Yu Oc on 19 November 1884 However, help was on its way. While Chanu and Herbin's companies were engaging the enemy frontally, de Borelli's Legion company had once again marched round the Chinese flank. At 10 a.m., just as the marsouins were down to their last few rounds, the legionnaires emerged from the forest to the west of the Chinese position, threatening the Chinese line of retreat. The Chinese immediately abandoned their positions and fell back towards Yu Oc, leaving behind several flags and ammunition boxes.Lecomte, 145 Duchesne pressed on, with de Borelli's legionnaires leading the way. Ten minutes later the column reached a deep and nearly vertical ravine, with a Chinese fort on the other side. The Chinese in the fort opened fire at the French vanguard, and de Borelli ordered his weary men to fix bayonets and charge. The legionnaires scrambled down the ravine and up the other side, without returning fire. The Chinese abandoned their defences before the French could close with them, and disappeared into the forests of Yu Oc. De Borelli and Chanu pushed forward to the Yu Oc pagoda and deployed their companies to form a defensive screen, while Herbin and Moulinay's men set fire to the Chinese barracks and destroyed part of their works. It was still only 10.30 a.m., and the column had already been in action twice. Duchesne now halted his men to allow them to regroup, eat an early lunch and replenish their ammunition. The French buried their dead and the gunboat Éclair, which had finally linked up with the column, took the wounded on board and ferried them up to Tuyen Quang. An hour later the march resumed. At 3.30 p.m. the column entered the Yu Oc defile, whose exit towards Tuyen Quang was blocked by two fortlets and by a series of trenches. Abattis nearly 300 metres deep covered the path. A force coming from Tuyen Quang could not have crossed this pass. Around 7 p.m. the advance guard approached the citadel. Guessing that the sentries in the besieged fortress would be nervous, the buglers played the first few bars of Le Boudin, the famous Legion refrain, to which the troops in Tuyên Quang replied. A scouting party coming from the fortress carried lanterns, to facilitate the crossing of the last stream.Lecomte, 145–6 French casualties in the engagement at Yu Oc were 10 dead and 37 wounded, mostly among the marine infantry.Losses in the two marine infantry companies were 9 men killed (including one officer, 2nd Lieutenant Schuster) and 30 wounded. Losses in the two Legion companies were 1 man killed and 7 wounded (including two officers, Lieutenants Goeury and Vincent). Chinese and Black Flag casualties are unknown, but were certainly higher than the French casualties.Lecomte, 146 == Aftermath == On 20 November, under the protection of Éclair, the convoy reached Tuyên Quang. The other gunboats remained at Yu Oc. On the same day Duchesne, who for the moment had an entire Legion battalion under his command, sent out strong reconnaissances to clear the Black Flags from the immediate environs of Tuyên Quang. He himself advanced on Truong Mu and pushed the Black Flags back towards Phu An Binh, while Captain Chmitelin, under the protection of Éclair's cannon, went to destroy the Chinese positions near Tuyên Quang on the left bank of the Clear River. On 21 and 22 November Duchesne advanced northwest and burned the village of Dong Dien, which had been used as a camp by the Black Flags. The Black Flags evacuated the village on his approach, and made no attempt to dispute the French advance. On the evening of 22 November Duchesne returned to Tuyên Quang.Lecomte, 146–7 Duchesne's column left Tuyên Quang on 23 November to return to Son Tay. During the return march Duchesne established a French post at Phu Doan on the Clear River, 80 kilometres to the south of Tuyên Quang, leaving a company of marine infantry there as a garrison.Lecomte, 147; Thomazi, Conquête, 239 Duchesne took with him the two Legion companies of the original garrison of Tuyên Quang, leaving chef de bataillon Marc-Edmond Dominé behind as the new post commander with de Borelli and Moulinay's Legion companies, Dia's Tonkinese, Derappe's artillery section, Bobillot's engineers and a small medical and administrative staff. The gunboat Revolver had left earlier, but Mitrailleuse remained at her station on the Clear River beyond the post's walls. The garrison of Tuyên Quang now consisted of just over 630 men, with food and provisions for 120 days, but had only 200 shells.Lecomte, 146–7; Thomazi, Conquête, 238–9 The Farcy gunboat Revolver was also withdrawn from Tuyên Quang, but Mitrailleuse remained on station, and later distinguished herself in the Siege of Tuyên Quang. On 24 November, the day after Duchesne's departure, Dominé declared Tuyên Quang to be in a state of siege. The battle of Yu Oc was merely the precursor to the four-month Siege of Tuyên Quang (24 November 1884 – 3 March 1885). == Order of the day == On 24 November 1884 General Brière de l'Isle issued the following order of the day to commemorate the victory at Yu Oc: > Le général commandant le corps expéditionnaire est heureux de porter à la > connaissance des troupes les brillants succès remportés par M. le colonel > Duchesne sur les Pavillons-Noirs et les Réguliers du Yun-Nan concentrés et > fortement retranchés sur la rive droite de la rivière Claire, dans la région > sud de Tuyen-Quan.

Our losses were 8 men killed, including 2nd Lieutenant > Schuster of the marine infantry, and 25 men wounded, including Lieutenant > Goeury of the Foreign Legion.) Most French orders of the day during the Sino-French War recorded French casualties with scrupulous accuracy. This particular order slightly understates the French casualties at Yu Oc. ==Notes Footnotes References== * Harmant, J., La verité sur la retraite de Lang-Son (Paris, 1892) * Hubert, C., Le colonel Dominé - Algérie, Armée de la Loire, Tonkin, Défense de Tuyen-Quan 1885 (Paris, 1938) * Huguet, E, En colonne: souvenirs d'Extrême-Orient (Paris, 1888) * Lecomte, J., Lang-Son: combats, retraite et négociations (Paris, 1895) * Lonlay, Dick de, Au Tonkin, 1883–1886: récits anecdotiques (Paris, 1886) * Lonlay, Dick de, Le siège de Tuyen-Quan (Paris, 1886) (= Au Tonkin, 363–448) * Nicolas, V., Livre d'or de l'infanterie de la marine (Paris, 1891) * Lung Chang [龍章], Yueh-nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [越南與中法戰爭, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine français (Hanoi, 1931) * Thomazi, A., La conquête de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) Yu Oc Yu Oc Category:1884 in France Category:1884 in China Category:1884 in Vietnam Yu Oc Category:History of Tuyên Quang Province Yu Oc Yu Oc Category:November 1884 events ","title":"Battle of Yu Oc"},{"id":"20367057","text":"The Battle of Nui Bop (3–4 January 1885) was a French victory during the Sino- French War. The battle was fought to clear Chinese forces away from the French forward base at Chu, and was an essential preliminary to the Lạng Sơn Campaign in February 1885.Harmant, 113–37; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 155–76; Lung Chang, 332; Maury, 129–32; Thomazi, Conquête, 243; Histoire militaire, 104–5 ==Background== In late September 1884 large detachments of the Guangxi Army advanced from Lạng Sơn and probed into the Luc Nam valley, announcing their presence by ambushing the French river gunboats Hache and Massue (of the Tonkin Flotilla) on 2 October. General Louis Brière de l'Isle, the French commander-in-chief, responded immediately, transporting nearly 3,000 French soldiers to the Luc Nam valley aboard a flotilla of gunboats and attacking the Chinese detachments before they could concentrate. In the Kép Campaign (2 to 15 October 1884), three French columns under the overall command of General François de Négrier fell upon the separated detachments of the Guangxi Army and successively defeated them in engagements at Lam (6 October), Kép (8 October) and Chu (10 October). In the wake of these French victories the Chinese fell back to Bắc Lệ and Dong Song, and de Négrier established important forward positions at Kép and Chu, which threatened the Guangxi Army's base at Lạng Sơn. Chu was only a few miles southwest of the Guangxi Army's advanced posts at Dong Song, and on 16 December 1884 a strong Chinese raiding detachment ambushed two companies of the Foreign Legion just to the east of Chu, at Ha Ho. The legionnaires fought their way out of the Chinese encirclement, but suffered a number of casualties and had to abandon their dead on the battlefield. De Négrier immediately brought up reinforcements and pursued the Chinese, but the raiders made good their retreat to Dong Song.Harmant, 91–112; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 149–55 Although the Guangxi Army had been forced to retreat in the October battles, its commanders had not given up all hope of breaking into the Delta. Driven partly by sheer hunger and partly by the knowledge that the French would sooner or later move against Lạng Sơn, the Chinese renewed their efforts to gain a foothold in the Luc Nam valley in December. The action at Ha Ho was the first indication that a major move was afoot. A week after this engagement a force of 12,000 Chinese troops from the Guangxi Army occupied the distinctive conical hill of Nui Bop, eighteen kilometres to the east of Chu, and began to lay out a large fortified camp. The Chinese force was under the command of Wang Debang, one of the Guangxi Army's more competent generals, who had defeated a French column in June 1884 in the Bắc Lệ ambush.Lung Chang, 332 The famished Chinese soldiers plundered all the villages in the area for food, earning the hatred and resentment of the Tonkinese farmers. On 23 December the villagers of Lien Son came to the French headquarters at Chu and alerted Lieutenant-Colonel Donnier to the presence of a large Chinese force around Nui Bop.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 154 The French could not allow a force of 12,000 Chinese to remain at Nui Bop, uncomfortably close to their main base at Chu and threatening the flank of the expeditionary corps when it eventually set off for Lạng Sơn. Brière de l'Isle reinforced the Chu garrison in late December, and in early January 1885 de Négrier was ordered to take the offensive against the Chinese.Lecomte, Lang- Son, 155 De Négrier's column was drawn from both the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. It included a marine infantry battalion under the command of chef de bataillon Mahias, de Mibielle's Turco battalion and two companies of Tonkinese riflemen. The column also included the 111th and 143rd Line battalions and Jourdy and de Saxcé's batteries.Mahias's battalion consisted of the 25th, 29th, 34th and 36th Companies, 1st Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Tailland, Salles, Hougnon and Bourguignon). De Mibielle's Turco battalion was the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Algerian Rifle Regiment (Captains Camper, Chirouze, Polère and Valet). ==Battle3 January=== Map of the battle of Nui Bop Instead of marching directly east from Chu to attack the Chinese frontally, de Négrier decided to cross to the southern bank of the Luc Nam river and make a wide flank march to come in on the Chinese left. To divert the enemy's attention while his main column marched around the Chinese, chef de bataillon Diguet's Legion battalion in Chu would demonstrate against their front.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 158 The column set off from Chu at 6 am on 3 January. Commandant Mahias led the advance guard, consisting of his own marine infantry battalion, Jourdy's battery and the Tonkinese Rifles, while Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger led the main body (the other three infantry battalions and de Saxcé's battery). A small rearguard protected the baggage train. After a short march the column reached the ford of Kao Ka and crossed to the southern bank of the Luc Nam. The crossing was completed by 8 am, and the column then marched eastwards to the ford of Dao Be. The French had been told that the ford could be crossed easily, but they discovered that the northern bank of the Luc Nam river was more than nine feet high at Dao Be and almost sheer. The crossing took three hours. It was not until 4 pm that the main body of the column was able to resume its march.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 158–9 While the crossing was still in progress, de Négrier sent Mahias ahead with the advance guard. Mahias pushed on along the path to Phong Cot, and at 4.15 pm reported back that the enemy was in sight. Less than a mile away a long line of Chinese infantry was drawn up across the floor and up the sides of the Phong Cot valley. In front of this force groups of skirmishers had advanced to within 800 metres of the Luc Nam to occupy a wood. The French column had been spotted fording the river, and the delay in completing the crossing had given the Chinese just enough time to prepare to meet its attack. De Négrier had failed to achieve the surprise he had hoped for.Lecomte, Lang- Son, 159 The French column advanced to contact in three lines. The first line consisted of Mahias’ battalion, the Tonkinese Rifles and Jourdy's battery. The second line contained the 111th and 143rd Line Battalions and de Saxcé's battery. De Mibielle's 3rd Algerian Rifle Battalion formed a third line. The French artillery took position on a hill to the right of the path and opened fire on the Chinese skirmishers, while de Négrier gave his orders for the attack. The marine infantry were ordered to attack the wood frontally, while the 143rd Battalion was to climb the hills to the right to flank the enemy's position and push back the Chinese left wing into the Phong Cot valley. The 111th Battalion and de Mibielle's Algerians would remain in reserve near the artillery.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 160 Mahias had little trouble in driving the Chinese skirmishers out of the wood. He deployed three of the four companies of his battalion to attack the wood both frontally and from the flank, while holding the fourth company in reserve. Meanwhile, the Tonkinese riflemen took up position on his right to link the marine infantry with the 143rd Battalion. The enemy skirmishers quickly fell back, and reformed on a small hill behind the wood.Lecomte, 160 Captain Salles, whose company had just helped to clear the wood, pushed on and drove the enemy off the hill. This action took Salles well beyond the other three companies of his battalion and into a hail of Chinese rifle fire from the heights on both sides of the Phong Cot valley, which were held by strong Chinese flanking forces. To disengage Salles's company it was necessary for the artillery to switch targets while the rest of Mahias’ battalion and the 143rd Battalion attacked on both sides of it to drive back the enemy wings. Salles withdrew his men to the wood, and the marine infantry battalion reformed and consolidated the ground it had won.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 161 Farret's 143rd Line Battalion now delivered its own attack on the enemy right, with two companies in the front line and two in reserve. The advance was difficult, as the Chinese held their positions stubbornly, but eventually the battalion established a lodgement on the high ground close to the enemy positions. However, its movement towards the right had created a hole in the centre of the French line, and a Chinese unit advanced into this gap to counterattack. Lieutenant Desloge, with one of the two reserve companies of the 143rd Battalion, drove off this counterattack and then pushed on to the heights to support the main attack. The Chinese soldiers facing de Négrier's men in this part of the field wore a distinctive covering of tawny material with black stripes on their heads and shoulders. They were, the French were later told, from the Imperial Tiger Regiment, a Yellow Banner unit entirely composed of Tartars. As Desloge and his handful of men bore down on them, the Tigers delivered a panicky close-range volley. They fired high, and missed their targets altogether. Before the French could reach them with their bayonets they broke and ran, leaving their dead behind them. They also abandoned their regimental standard, a magnificent flag in yellow silk embroidered with gold. The leading French units pressed on and cleared the Chinese from the hills around Phong Cot, while the rest of de Négrier's column continued its crossing of the Luc Nam. The Chinese made a half-hearted attempt to counterattack the 143rd Battalion, but their troops were driven off. By nightfall the entire French column was across the river and in position to the south of Phong Cot.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 162 De Négrier believed that the Chinese were demoralised, and was anxious to seize Phong Cot itself before they could rally. Accordingly, just before midnight, he ordered Herbinger to move forward and occupy the village. The French capture of the nearby hills had made it untenable, and the Chinese had evacuated it under cover of darkness. Herbinger met no resistance, and ordered Faure's 111th Battalion to garrison the village. Faure placed three of the battalion's four companies inside Phong Cot and Verdier's company in a forward position beyond it.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 163 ===4 January=== Captain Tailland, mentioned in despatches for his courage and initiative at Nui Bop Just before dawn on 4 January the Chinese made a furious counterattack in an attempt to recapture Phong Cot. The attack was supported by the Chinese artillery in the Western Fort. Within minutes the attackers had surrounded Verdier's company in its isolated forward position. While his company tried to defend itself with close-range rifle fire Verdier ordered one of his men to try to make his way through the Chinese lines back to Phong Cot and ask for help. A young private soldier named Meffret crept cautiously through the Chinese lines in the fading gloom of night and reached Phong Cot, where he delivered Verdier's message to Lieutenant-Colonel Herbinger.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 164 Herbinger, perhaps believing that Meffret was exaggerating the danger, responded by sending forward from Phong Cot a single section of the 111th Battalion—a mere ten men. Fortunately for Verdier, there were other officers on the field who could better appreciate the gravity of the situation. Captain Tailland, whose marine infantry company was posted on a hill to the west of Phong Cot, could see that Verdier's company would be annihilated unless it was brought immediate relief. Without waiting for orders, he led his own men to the rescue. By now Verdier's men were being pressed so closely by the Chinese that their captain ordered them to charge to throw them back. Although Verdier was wounded as he led his men forward, his bold lunge took the Chinese completely by surprise. As the Chinese fell back and regrouped, Tailland's marsouins came up on Verdier's left flank and moved into line alongside Verdier's men. The two French companies caught their breath, reformed, counterattacked and drove the Chinese off. Verdier and Tailland were both later mentioned in despatches for their courage and initiative.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 164–5 The Chinese did not attempt to take the offensive again. De Négrier went forward to the heights occupied by the marine infantry and scouted the Chinese positions. The main Chinese defence line consisted of a trench between Phong Cot and the Siou Nien River, which protected the road that ran from Lien Son to Cao Say. This trench was flanked on both sides by two forts on elevated ground (Western Fort and Eastern Fort). Behind the Siou Nien river, on the lower slopes of the Nui Bop massif, were several Chinese forts.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 165 and 168 A view from the French positions towards the Chinese forts at Nui Bop, 4 January 1885 During the morning of 4 January de Négrier directed several French attacks which pushed the enemy back from all his positions. The first French objective was a fort on a hill behind the village of Tay Toun, not far from the marine infantry positions. Mahias's battalion attacked and took this fort with little difficulty. To its right the 111th Battalion, profiting from the confusion in the Chinese ranks caused by Verdier's counterattack, advanced on the main Chinese positions. The battalion charged the Chinese trench with the bayonet, driving its defenders out with equal ease. Lieutenant de Colomb's platoon, thoroughly over-excited, pushed on towards a Chinese redoubt defended by several hundred men. Had it attempted to charge this position it would doubtless have been repulsed with heavy losses. However, the river was too deep to cross at this point, and the platoon was forced to halt its advance.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 166–7 Meanwhile, the 143rd Battalion and the Algerian Rifles were ordered to make a turning movement around the enemy left. The French artillery punished the enemy positions which it took in the flank, since these positions faced southwards towards Chu. At 11.15 am the entire entrenched camp was in French hands. The French took possession of two abandoned Krupp artillery batteries and large quantities of rifles, clothes, tents and food. Several Chinese battle flags were also taken, and a number of mules and horses.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 169–71 ==Aftermath== French casualties at Nui Bop were relatively moderate: 19 dead and 65 wounded. The French wounded included three officers, Captain Verdier and Lieutenant Simoni of the 111th Line Battalion and 2nd Lieutenant Larribe of the Tonkinese Rifles.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 172 The Chinese abandoned 600 corpses in their retreat, and their total casualties must have been far higher. The French scoured the battlefield during the afternoon of 4 January, and killed all the wounded Chinese soldiers they could find with pistol shots to the head. Several dozen Chinese soldiers may have been despatched in this way.Dreyfus, 85 A number of unwounded Chinese soldiers were taken prisoner by the French at Nui Bop and subsequently interrogated for their knowledge of the Guangxi Army's order of battle. These men were released at the end of the war with small gratuities.Lecomte, La vie militaire, 79–86 ==Order of the day== On 5 January 1885 General Brière de l'Isle issued the following order of the day to commemorate the victory at Nui Bop: > Deux brillants succès pour le corps expéditionnaire ouvrent l'année 1885. Le > 3 janvier, après une marche habilement dérobée aux yeux de l'ennemi, le > général de Négrier tombait, à quatre heures du soir, sur un cantonnement de > 6,000 réguliers et, malgré leur vive résistance, les mettait, en moins de > deux heures, en pleine déroute sans que l'obscurité de nuit lui permit de > poursuivre ce premier succès. Nos troupes couchaient sur les positions > enlevées. Le lendemain, avant le jour, les Chinois, au nombre de 12,000, > recommençaient la lutte par un vigoureux retour offensif. Repoussés, > poursuivis et enfin rejetés sur Nui-Bop, ils étaient en pleine déroute avant > midi. Le centre de résistance de Nui-Bop, défendu par huit forts solidement > organisés, est entre nos mains, avec deux batteries Krupp, ainsi que tout le > matériel de l'ennemi: tentes, vivres, munitions, armes et étendards.

Verdier, capitaine au 111e, Simoni, lieutenant au même > corps, Larribe, sous-lieutenant d'infanterie de marine, sont blessés sans > gravité. Parmi nos braves soldats, 19 tués et 63 blessés.Lecomte, Lang-Son, > 175 > (1885 has opened with two splendid successes for the expeditionary corps.

On > our part Captain Verdier and Lieutenant Simoni of the 111th and 2nd > Lieutenant Larribe of the marine infantry were lightly wounded. Losses among > our brave soldiers were 19 dead and 63 wounded.) ==Significance== General Campenon General Lewal De Nègrier's victory at Nui Bop, won at odds of just under one to ten, was regarded by his fellow-officers as the most spectacular professional triumph of his career. By clearing the Guangxi Army away from Nui Bop, de Nègrier removed a threat to the French right flank and gave the French base at Chu the air it needed for the major campaign against Lạng Sơn. With the Western Fort at Nui Bop in French hands, the expeditionary corps was able to use the Nui Bop plain to establish the large magazines of food and ammunition that would be needed for the Lạng Sơn expedition. French strategy in Tonkin had been the subject of a bitter debate in the Chamber of Deputies in late December 1884. The army minister General Jean-Baptiste-Marie Campenon argued that the French should consolidate their hold on the Delta. His opponents urged an all-out offensive to throw the Chinese out of northern Tonkin. The debate culminated in Campenon's resignation and his replacement as army minister by the hawkish General Jules Lewal. On 5 January 1885, the day after de Nègrier's victory at Nui Bop, Lewal ordered Brière de l'Isle to 'capture Lạng Sơn as soon as possible'. A month later, after concentrating his forces in the plain of Chu, Briere de l'Isle launched the Lạng Sơn Campaign, a successful ten-day campaign to capture Lạng Sơn.Lung Chang, 332; Thomazi, Conquête, 242–3 ==NotesFootnotesReferences== * Dreyfus, G., Lettres du Tonkin, 1884–1886 (Paris, 2001) * Harmant, J., La verité sur la retraite de Lang-Son (Paris, 1892) * Lecomte, J., Lang-Son: combats, retraite et négociations (Paris, 1895) * Lecomte, J., La vie militaire au Tonkin (Paris, 1893) *Dick de Lonlay, Les combats du général de Négrier au Tonkin (Paris, Garnier frères, 1886) * Maury, A., Mes campagnes au Tong-King (Lyons, undated) * Lung Chang [龍章], Yueh-nan yu Chung- fa chan-cheng [越南與中法戰爭, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine français (Hanoi, 1931) * Thomazi, A., La conquête de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) Nui Bop Nui Bop Category:1885 in France Category:1885 in China Category:1885 in Vietnam Nui Bop Category:History of Lạng Sơn Province Category:History of Bắc Giang Province Nui Bop Nui Bop Category:January 1885 events ","title":"Battle of Núi Bop"},{"id":"20367061","text":", sometimes referred to as Jumping Flash! 3, is a 3D platform game for the Sony PlayStation.

There was virtually nothing produced in the great divide caused by World War II. Up to 1941 manufacturers like Gum Inc. (later Bowman) and Goudey, had raised the bar on the confection industry by leaving behind the tobacco age of marketing to adults and bringing forth the bubble gum age and marketing to children. Topps had been primarily a gum company but took up adding premiums to their products after the war. Their first sets featured various sizes and numerous topics, mostly non-sport. The most notable is the Bazooka Gum comics although the earlier issues did not yet feature Joe and his gang. Below are descriptions of Topps products that were issued in the 1940s. ==Multi-sport== 1948 Topps Magic Photos (R714-27) This set contains 252 small individual cards featuring sport and non-sport subjects. They were issued in 19 lettered series with cards numbered within each series. The 'magic' of the cards were the fact that they came out of the pack blank until the image was revealed by moistening the surface and applying the developing agent which was supplied by the wrapper in a one cent pack or a piece of orange mystery paper supplied in the five cent packs. The subsets by group letter are: A Boxing Champions, B All-American Basketball, C All- American Football, D Wrestling Champions, E Track & Field Champions, F Stars of Stage & Screen, G American Dogs, H General Sports, I None issued, J Movie Stars, K Baseball Hall of Fame, L Aviation Pioneers, M Famous Landmarks, N American Inventors, O American Military Leaders, P American Explorers, Q Basketball Thrills, R Football Thrills, S Figures of the Wild West, T General Sports. Size: × in (2.2 × 3.7 cm) 1949 Spalding Sports Show These are a set of rust colored cartoons that deal with numerous sports. The illustrator of the cartoons is Willard Mullin. They were found on the inside of the foil wrapper of Bazooka gum. Size: 2 × inches ==Non-sport== 1947-49 Bazooka Comics As a way to boost sales Topps began putting small comic strips as inner wrappers for their gum. These comics were reprints of strips from DC and Fawcett. Titles such as 'Doc Sorebones' and 'Peg' were found in varying sizes in Bazooka Gum from 1947 to 1948. In 1949 Topps began using a character called 'Bazooka, The Atom Bubble Boy' that represented something of a personage of the product. These comics that featured the Bubble Boy were done in a dull rust color making them hard to read. Despite their quality they would represent the precursor to the famous Bazooka Joe comics. 1948 Tattoo Bubble Gum™ (150) These items are transfers that feature various generic sport and non-sport drawings. Size: × inches. 1948 It Happened to a President (20) These comics are printed on thin tissue which was the interior wrapper of 'Golden Coin Bubble Gum'. The stories are done in rust color and tell of a true event in the life of a president. Size: × in. 1949 President Coins (34) The coins in this set are made of gold colored plastic. Each coin is numbered in sequence of each subject's presidency. Like most coins these items feature a bust of the president on the front with an eagle atop a shield on the back. The term of each president is depicted in relief around the portrait of each coin. Size: in. diameter 1949 Famous Events (~60) This set was a series of comics that doubled as a gum wrapper. Alternately titled 'On This Day in History' the rust colored comics feature artwork of a special event on a particular day in history. Above the picture is a panel describing the event while a panel below the artwork offers astrological data for people born on the respective day. Size: 2 × inches 1949 Flags of all Nations & Soldiers of the World (~32) These cards are double features in that they have two fronts. The Soldiers appeared on the glossy cardboard side while the Flags were printed on shiny patterned cloth on the other side. Size: × inches 1949 Flags of the World Parade (100) These Flags are a larger size as well as an expanded version of the above Flags & Soldiers set. This issue has five subsets divided by continent. There are flags of countries as well as service branches, naval standards, and confederated republics. The cards have both a set number and a subset number. The backs have a brief explanation of the flag. To the left of the text and below the set number is a line drawing of the soldier. Size: × inches 1949 Flip-O-Vision (50) This is a set of flip books that make a mini movie. Out of the packs the books were 30 pages folded like an accordion. The pages had to be separated and then bound together with string or thread to be used as a flip movie. The subjects featured are various celebrities performing their craft. Size: × 4 inches 1949 License Plates (75) This set offered another double feature type card for the consumer. One side of the cards are license plates for every state as well as District of Columbia and Quebec while the other side posed a question about a car or landmark. The question side of the cards had a gray coating over 70 percent of it while the remainder had the question. The answer to the question was underneath the coating. Size: × inches 1949 Play Coins of the World (120) These play coins are plastic coated with either brass, copper, or nickel depending on their denomination. There are three different denominations for each country which are 25, 50 and 100. The coins were distributed with either gum or lollipops. Size: inch diameter 1949 The Story of the Atom Bomb (18) The A-Bomb set was printed on the inside of the gum trays instead of the actual gum wrappers. The stories are printed on one half of the panel while the other half had a mail-in premium offer. Size: × inches 1949 X-Ray Round Up (200) This issue was a series of well colored and nicely detailed small size cards. The set had four subsets of fifty cards each. The subsets are Figures of the Wild West, Indian Chiefs, Pirates of the Spanish Main, and Savage Tribesmen. The X-Ray concept deals with the images on the back of the cards which were drawn with wavy orange lines. Also visible on the picture are very fine blue-green lines. A red X-Ray slip that was included could be used over the picture where the blue-green lines would reveal a hidden picture with a caption. Size: × inches ==Sources== * Benjamin, Christopher et al.

The entire album was produced by composer Nikos Terzis who was on the rise in the early 1990s, while the songs have all been penned by Giorgos Pavrianos, who was an already established writer. The album officially declared Rouvas as Greece's first male pop singer to closely mirror other Western pop music acts, however, he is often widely perceived as the first Greek pop artist.

It subsequently peaked at number one on the Greek Airplay Chart. The music video was directed by Nikos Soulis in collaboration with Antidoton and caused controversy due to its semi-nude scenes. It is shot partially in color and partially in black and white. The video opens with Rouvas looking through a photo album; when the music begins he is seen singing at a club and catches the attention of a female attendant who is there with her partner. Subsequent scenes show love scenes between Rouvas and the woman in a garden and bath, as well as Rouvas singing in a shower locker room. \\"1992\\" :\\"1992\\" was the second single from the album and also went on to become popular on the airplay charts.

He graduated from McGill University in 1878 and went on to RMC, where he introduced ice hockey to Kingston (student # 45). As a cadet at RMC, Taylor won the sword of honour in 1882 and the sword is in the collection of the RMC museum. He served as battalion sergeant-major at RMC. ==Military career== He was the first RMC cadet to attend the staff college course at Camberly (1895). He joined the 2nd Battalion of the Cheshire regiment. He served with his regiment and on the staff in India and Burma, often in instructional positions. He was fond of climbing and shooting tigers. He was an energetic man of great physical endurance who possessed an almost boyish enthusiasm.Dr. Richard Arthur Preston \\"Canada's RMC - A History of Royal Military College\\" Second Edition 1982 Lieutenant Colonel Taylor served as the sixth Commandant at RMC, (1905-9).

The practice of gymnastic drills and outdoor exercises of all kinds ensured good health and fine physical condition. Five commissions in the imperial army were awarded yearly to the cadets who stand highest. The length of the course was three years, in three terms of nine and a half months' residence each.\\"The New Student's Reference Work: Volume 3\\" by Chandler B.

As Commandant, he indicated the difficulty involved if RMC graduates who did not take a commission in the British army or Canadian Permanent Active Force were required to serve for a stated time in the Non-Permanent Active Force. This compulsory military service would be difficult since graduates did not always live near militia units. He recommended that graduates be posted to a unit of their choice rather than simply be placed on the reserve of officers.Dr. Richard Arthur Preston \\"Canada's RMC - A History of Royal Military College\\" Second Edition 1982 In 1906, the practice began at the RMC club annual dinner of calling the roll by having each member rise in place in turn and announce their college number and name in order of seniority.

The Royal Observer Corps (ROC) was a civil defence organisation operating in the United Kingdom between October 1925 and 31 December 1995, when the Corps' civilian volunteers were stood down. (ROC headquarters staff at RAF Bentley Priory stood down on 31 March 1996). Composed mainly of civilian spare-time volunteers, ROC personnel wore a Royal Air Force (RAF) style uniform and latterly came under the administrative control of RAF Strike Command and the operational control of the Home Office. Civilian volunteers were trained and administered by a small cadre of professional full-time officers under the command of the Commandant Royal Observer Corps; a serving RAF Air Commodore. This sub article lists and describes the instruments used by the ROC in their nuclear detection and reporting role during the Cold War period. __TOC__ ==Initial detection of nuclear bursts on the UK== AWDREY Computer. Atomic Weapons Detection Recognition and Estimation of Yield known as AWDREY was a desk mounted automatic instrument, located at controls, that detected nuclear explosions and indicated the estimated size in megatons. Operating by measuring the intense flashes emitted by a nuclear explosion, together with a unit known as DIADEM which measured Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), the instruments were tested daily by wholetime ROC officers and regularly reacted to the EMP from lightning strikes during thunderstorms.AWDREY and other instruments can be seen here AWDREY was designed and built by the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston and tested for performance and accuracy on real nuclear explosions at the 1957 Kiritimati (or Christmas Island) nuclear bomb test (after being mounted on board a ship). Reports following a reading on AWDREY were prefixed with the codewords \\"Tocsin Bang\\". Bomb Power Indicator with ‘Kilopascal’ overlay. This was added in the 1970s to cover the original P.S.I scale which had been superseded. The Bomb Power Indicator or BPI consisted of a peak overpressure gauge with a dial that would register when the pressure wave from a nuclear explosion passed over the post. When related to the distance of the explosion from the post this pressure would indicate the power of the explosion. Reports following a reading on the BPI were preceded by the codeword \\"Tocsin\\". Internal view showing the ‘North Cassette’ which would have held the photosensitive paper. Exterior profile of GZI with two of the four ‘pinholes’ visible. The Ground Zero Indicator, or GZI or shadowgraph, consisted of four horizontally mounted cardinal compass point pinhole cameras within a metal drum, each 'camera' contained a sheet of photosensitive paper on which were printed horizontal and vertical calibration lines. The flash from a nuclear explosion would produce a mark on one or two of the papers within the drum. The position of the mark enabled the bearing and height of the burst to be estimated. With triangulation between neighbouring posts these readings would give an accurate height and position. The altitude of the explosion was important because a ground or near ground burst would produce radioactive fallout, whereas an air burst would produce only short distance and short lived initial radiations (but no fallout). ==Static measurement of ionising radiation== RSM No.2 The Radiac Survey Meter No 2 or RSM was a 1955-meter which used an ionisation chamber to measure gamma radiation, it could measure beta, by removing the base-plate and opening the beta shield. This meter suffered from a number of disadvantages: it required three different types of batteries, of which two were obsolete and had to be manufactured to special order, the circuit included a single electrometer valve or tube. These were favored as they had been tested on fallout in Australia after the Operation Buffalo nuclear tests, and remained in use until 1982 by commissioning a manufacturer to regularly produce special production runs of the obsolete batteries. Within the ROC the RSM was only used at post sites for three years when it was superseded in 1958 by the FSM and the RSM retained only for post attack mobile monitoring missions. The ‘ROC Fixed Survey Meter’. Manufactured by AVO and introduced in the 1950s. The Fixed Survey Meter or FSM was introduced in 1958. For the first time it was possible to operate the unit from within the Monitoring Post or Group HQ using an external Geiger Muller Probe connected via coaxial cable and mounted to a telescopic rod and protected on the surface by a polycarbonate dome. The FSM used the same obsolete high voltage batteries as the RSM. Polycarbonate Dome which was fitted on the surface and held the Fixed Survey Meter Geiger Muller Probe inside. This unit remained unchanged when the PDRM82(F) replaced the FSM. Plessey PDRM82(F) PDRM82F Geiger Muller Probe on its mounting bracket, fitted to the Telescopic Probe Rod. In 1985 this instrument was replaced by the PDRM82(F). The PDRM82(F) was the fixed desktop version of the PDRM82. It gave more accurate readings and used standard 'C' cell torch batteries that lasted many times longer, up to 400 hours of operation. The compact and robust instruments were housed in sturdy orange coloured polycarbonate cases and had clear liquid crystal displays. The PDRM82(F) could also be operated from within the Monitoring Post or Group HQ as before, using an external Geiger Muller Probe connected via coaxial cable. The telescopic rod, mounting bracket and polycarbonate dome used by the earlier FSM remained in service and continued to be used with the PDRM82(F). ==Portable measurement of radiation during Mobile Monitoring missions== The Radiac Survey Meter No 2 or RSM was a 1955-meter which measured gamma and beta radiation. Having been superseded within the ROC by the Fixed Survey Meter the RSM remained in use only for post attack mobile monitoring missions in a post attack period. Image can be seen in ‘Static measurement of ionising radiation’ section. The Radiac Survey Meter, Lightweight, MkVI, produced by the AVO company (The MkIII and MkIV were also available) were issued to the ROC in the mid-late 1960s, but were not regarded favourable due to using almost obsolete Mallory batteries and were ionisation type meters that measured gamma radiation. Radiac Survey Meter, Lightweight, MkVI The PDRM82 or Portable Dose Rate Meter was the standard portable version of the new meters, that were manufactured by Plessey and introduced during the 1980s, giving more accurate readings and using standard 'C' cell torch batteries that lasted many times longer, up to 400 hours of operation. The compact and robust instruments were housed in sturdy orange coloured polycarbonate cases and had clear liquid crystal displays. The Radiac sensor was self-contained within the casing.

EAL N.105A The Dosimeter pocket meters were issued to individual observers for measuring their personal levels of radiation absorption during operations. Three different grades of dosimeter were used, depending on ambient radiation levels. The original hand wound and temperamental dosimeter charging units (Charging Unit, Individual, Dosimeter No.1 & No.2) were replaced during the 1980s by a battery operated automatic charging unit (EAL Type N.105A). ==See also== * Royal Observer Corps * Royal Observer Corps Monitoring Post * Bomb Power Indicator * Ground Zero Indicator *Fixed Survey Meter *Nuclear MASINT US equivalent ==References== *Operator's Handbook for Meter Survey Radiac No.2 Published A.E.R.E. 1955 *Civil Defence Pocket Book, General Information published Home Office (various dates) Category:Royal Observer Corps Category:Cold War military equipment of the United Kingdom Category:Measuring instruments ","title":"Operational instruments of the Royal Observer Corps"},{"id":"20367296","text":"Mycielski is a Polish surname.

At the age of about eight he made such progress in the singing school he attended that after one winter he could sing the alto part of any church song. He then joined the choir of one of Boston's leading churches. At age ten he became a member of the Handel and Haydn Society, and was the leading alto in the chorus for several years. He became a singer in the Trinity Church of Boston which at the time was known for having the best music in town. His salary was $150 per year, a sum never heard of before for someone as young as he was. At the age of 15 Millard had to fill-in for a famous tenor, Mr. Jones, who had suddenly taken ill and could not perform in the oratorio Samson, in which he had been the lead. == Europe == In 1851, at the age of 21, Millard went to Europe to study for three years in Italy and other places, with the continent's best instructors. He stayed in London for two years after leaving Italy. There he sang in Louis Antoine Jullien's concerts at Exeter Hall, Surrey Gardens. He also sang in Boosey & Co.'s Verdi festival. He sand with Clara Novello, Miss Charlotte Helen Dolby, and Mr. Sims Reeves. Later he went with Catherine Hayes to perform in Ireland and Scotland. He worked as a correspondent for Dwight's Journal and other US papers. While in Europe he also composed music. == Boston and New York == In 1854 he returned to Boston where he remained until 1858, teaching music and Italian as well as singing in concerts. He then moved to New York permanently. Within the year of his move he wrote his first hit song, \\"Viv L'America.\\" Only two years later he marched to this tune after he enlisted to fight in the Civil War. == Civil War == He served as a first lieutenant of the New York Nineteenth Regiment in the Union forces in the American Civil War. After serving for four years he was severely wounded at the Battle of Chickamauga and was forced to resign his commission and returned to New York. == Custom House == President Lincoln offered Millard a job in the Custom House as a recognition of the importance to the country the song \\"Viva L'America\\" took on during the Civil War.

Officially, it was the 52nd season of the league. The Montreal Alouettes won the 97th Grey Cup on November 29 with a last second 28–27 win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. The 19-week regular schedule, issued February 3, 2009, began on July 1, which was only the second time in league history that a CFL season started on Canada Day, with the first occurring in 1998.https://www.cfl.ca/article/let-the-2009-season-begin Let the 2009 season begin The playoffs started on November 15 and two weeks of pre- season games began June 17. ==CFL news in 2009Arena football suspension and moves for expansion=== In February unexpected news was made when an American group, led by ex-NFL receiver Oronde Gadsden, announced their intentions to pursue a franchise in the CFL.Naylor, David. Citing the suspension of the 2009 season of the Arena Football League and the demise of NFL Europe as a potential opportunity for growth the US market, Gadsen's group highlighted either Detroit–Windsor or Rochester, New York as possible locations for a new team. Reaction from the CFL with respect to Gadsen's intentions was mixed, however, with league head office iterating a reluctance to return to US expansion while Montreal Alouettes owner, Robert Wetenhall, welcoming the concept of bids involving border regions (Wetenhall's Alouettes spent two years in Baltimore in the 1990s, though under American ownership; Wetenhall purchased the team after it moved to Montreal). The mayor of Moncton, premier of New Brunswick, and league commissioner Mark Cohon met in February to negotiate a deal that would see the city host a regular season game annually over five years, beginning in the 2010 CFL season. ===Rule changes=== Several main rule changes were proposed for 2009 by fans at the request of CFL commissioner Mark Cohon. The following changes were implemented: *The elimination of the option for the scored-upon team to scrimmage from its 35-yard line after field goals, which was first enacted in 1975. This was said to add excitement by preventing a team up by six points to scrimmage and take a knee three times to effectively end the game with one minute to go. Although it had good intentions, the results for this rule change was not as expected, and for the 2010 CFL season, the league reinstated the option again. *Kickoffs being from the 25-yard line rather than the 35-yard line following a safety: the average kickoff in 2008 went 60 yards downfield, while the average kickoff return was 21 yards, making the option between scrimmaging and receiving kickoffs a wash. *Removing the restriction that a quarterback must take the snap from the centre. This effectively legalizes the wildcat offense (where a running back takes the snap) in Canadian football, which had long been legal in American football. *Video replays for coaches challenges will now ordinarily be reviewed at a command centre in the CFL's office in Toronto rather than in the video replay booth on the field. As well, if a team is successful in its two replay challenges, they will be awarded a third one. Other rule changes considered included moving the kickoff back 10 yards for all kicks (not just following safeties), and moving the ball back during conversions. ===Hall of Fame induction weekend=== For only the second time in its 39-year history, the Canadian Football Hall of Fame induction weekend events did not take place in Hamilton, Ontario, the home of the museum. It took place in Winnipeg from September 24 to 26, finishing with the tribute game between the Blue Bombers and Argonauts on September 26. ===Bye weeks=== Byes in the two weeks preceding the Labour Day Classic games were retained, however the byes were changed so as to ensure that each pair of Labour Day Classic opponents will have equal rest as opposed to splitting the byes by division. ===CFL retro=== { cellspacing=\\"10\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  West Division Retro Jerseys  valign=\\"top\\"  East Division Retro Jerseys } As the league approaches the 100th Grey Cup, the CFL celebrated the 1960s with all eight teams wearing retro-themed uniforms from that era at different points in the season. All teams wore their retro uniforms in Week 3. The Saskatchewan Roughriders and the Calgary Stampeders were the only teams to wear both home and away retro uniforms, while the remaining teams wore one set of uniforms. The BC Lions wore their black alternate jerseys in combination with their retro pants and helmets for a \\"retro look,\\" but did not introduce new home retro jerseys. ===Records and milestones=== *On September 19, BC Lions head coach, Wally Buono became the CFL's all-time leader in coaching victories, surpassing Don Matthews' total of 231. ==Regular season== Note: GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, PF = Points For, PA = Points Against, Pts = Points Teams in bold' are currently in playoff positions. ===Notes=== *Saskatchewan earned first place in the West due to their winning of the season series (2–0–1) against Calgary. *B.C. qualified for the playoffs in place of Winnipeg due to the \\"cross-over rule,\\" as B.C. finished with more points. ==Grey Cup playoffs== The Montreal Alouettes were the 2009 Grey Cup champions, defeating the Saskatchewan Roughriders, 28–27 on a field goal by Damon Duval at Calgary's McMahon Stadium on the last play of the game. It was the first Grey Cup for the Alouettes since 2002.

It consists of three movements: * Méditation (D minor) * Scherzo (C minor) * Mélodie (E-flat major; Tchaikovsky also described it as a \\"chant sans paroles\\"). The Méditation was written between 23 and 25 March 1878, in Clarens, Switzerland, where Tchaikovsky wrote his Violin Concerto. It was originally intended as the slow movement of the concerto, but he realised it was too slight for a concerto, so he discarded it and wrote a Canzonetta instead. On 16 May, back in Russia, he started on a work in three parts for violin and piano (the only time he ever originally wrote for that combination of instruments, although the Valse-Scherzo also exists in a violin and piano arrangement). On 22 May he told his brother Modest that it was going well. On 25 May he left for a two-week vacation on the Ukrainian country estate Brailivo (sometimes seen in English as \\"Brailovo\\"), which belonged to his benefactress Nadezhda von Meck, where he finished the work by 31 May. For the first movement, he used the discarded Méditation, recasting it for violin and piano. The two additional movements, Scherzo and Mélodie, completed the Souvenir d'un lieu cher. While at Brailovo, he also completed the Six Romances, Op. 38, and sketched his entire setting of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom.Apple Hill Chamber Players Tchaikovsky had the original manuscript sent as a token of gratitude to Nadezhda von Meck, but he always intended to publish the work, so he asked her to arrange for a copy to be made, which was done by Władysław Pachulski, a member of von Meck's household and later her son-in-law. This copy was sent to the publisher, P. Jurgenson. Tchaikovsky dedicated the work to \\"B*******\\", which is understood to refer to Brailovo itself. It was published in May 1879, as Op. 42. In 1880, the Méditation was published separately, and has since become well known as an independent piece. The Scherzo and Mélodie were published separately in 1884. In 1896 Jurgenson published the complete work in an arrangement by Alexander Glazunov for violin and orchestra, and in this form it has perhaps become better known than in its original form for violin and piano.

Following the 2010 season, the franchise moved to Old Orchard Beach, Maine. The stadium has been home to multiple teams, initially housing the Lowell Tigers from 1902-1905. It was then vacant until 1910, when the Lowell Grays moved in. They left in 1919, and after being used partially by multiple other teams until 1922, including the Salem Witches after their move, it was unused until 1996 when the Lowell Spinners began to use it.

It was next to another high school called Booth Memorial High. Bishops College had a French immersion and English stream programs and was well into its fifth decade as an educational institution. It offered grades 10 to 12 to a total student population of about 600 and operated under the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Education curriculum. Bishops College was under the trusteeship of the Eastern School District. It closed on June 25, 2015. Students from Bishops and the neighbouring Booth Memorial High commenced the 2015-2016 school year at Waterford Valley High, which was built to replace both aging schools. In September 2019, it was announced that the building will reopen after extensive renovations as Bishops Gardens, a state of the art seniors home. ==History== Before 1787 the Church of England in Newfoundland was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of London, and then later the diocese of Nova Scotia. It was not until 1839 that the first Bishop of Newfoundland, the Right Rev. Aubrey George Spencer, was consecrated. Spencer laid foundations upon which his successors built. He extended the work of the church, established a school for the training of clergymen (afterward Queen's College), and laid the foundation stone for the building of a cathedral in St. John's. Under his successor, the Right Rev. Edward Feild, education continued to be encouraged, and orphanages founded. Bishop Feild founded a collegiate school for boys which in 1894 became Bishop Feild College. He also established Bishop Spencer College, a diocesan school for girls. For 100 years these schools were homes to boys and girls from the Church of England. Bishop Feild College was the college for all Anglican people in Newfoundland. To that end, Feild Hall was erected near present-day St. Thomas' Church to house the \\"outport\\" boys whose parents could afford to send them to Feild. Bishop Jones Hostel (Rennies Mill Road) was the girls' accommodation. The present Bishop Feild School, the old Bishop Feild College, was erected in 1926 and opened in 1928. In 1959 Bishops College was built by the Anglican Church, necessitating a diminishing of the old Bishops Feild College to a junior high. In 1972 a further decrease in Feild's status came when junior high schools such as Macdonald Drive, Macpherson and I.J. Samson were built. Thus Feild became a Primary/Elementary School and by 1986 it was a French Immersion School. ===First amalgamation=== Formation of the Integrated School Board, which was called the Avalon Consolidated School Board, occurred in 1969. This amalgamation brought together the United, Anglican, Presbyterian, and the Salvation Army. At this time Bishops College was no longer a school for Anglican male and females but for most Protestant religions. === Second amalgamation=== In 1995 the people of Newfoundland voted 54% to reduce the denominational system in Newfoundland and by 1998 a provincially run system was set up. Gone was 277 years of denominational education. Bishops College, along with Booth Memorial became the schools serving the west end of St. John's and Kilbride area. Feeder schools for Bishops were Cowan Heights Elementary and I. J. Samson Junior High. In 2005 a change in the feeder system brought St. Matthew's Elementary and Hazelwood Academy, feeding into Beaconsfield Junior High and then to Bishops College. In 2015, the school closed after 56 years. ==Mascot== The mascot for Bishops was the Bishops Baron, sometimes depicted as Snoopy dressed as the Red Baron. ==References * Digitized yearbooks * School site Category:Educational institutions with year of establishment missing Category:High schools in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador Category:High schools in Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Bishops College (Newfoundland)"},{"id":"20367680","text":"Common medium coat of arms of Austria-Hungary (until 1915) The coat of arms of Austria-Hungary was that country's symbol during its existence from the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 to its dissolution in 1918. The double- headed eagle of the ruling House of Habsburg-Lorraine was used by the common Imperial and Royal (k. u. k.) institutions of the dual monarchy. Additionally, each of the two parts of the real union had its own coat of arms. As the double-headed eagle was reminiscent of the Reichsadler insignia of the defunct Holy Roman Empire and also the symbol of the Cisleithanian ('Austrian') half of the real union, the Hungarian government urged for the introduction of a new common coat of arms, which took place in 1915, in the midst of World War I. The new insignia combined the coat of arms of the separate halves of the Dual Monarchy, linked by the armorials of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty and the motto indivisibiliter ac inseparabiliter ('indivisible and inseparable' ). ==Common coat of arms== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" ! width=\\"110\\"Coat of arms!!width=\\"100\\"Date!!width=\\"250\\"Use!!width=\\"250\\"Description -  center  1867–1915  Lesser common Coat of Arms  Imperial-Royal (k.k.) coat of arms of the Austrian Empire from 1804: the double-headed eagle with marshaled arms of Habsburg, Babenberg and Lorraine displayed on the Escutcheon, Order of the Golden Fleece and Imperial Crown -  center  1867–1915  Medium common Coat of Arms With armorials of (counterclockwise): Hungary, Galicia, Lower Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Tyrol, Carinthia and Carniola, Silesia and Moravia, Transylvania, Illyria, and Bohemia -  center  1915–1916  Lesser common Coat of Arms  Lesser Coat of arms of Cisleithania and Transleithania under the Imperial Crown and the Crown of Saint Stephen resp., linked by the crowned Habsburg-Lorraine armorials, the Order of the Golden Fleece, and the motto indivisibiliter ac inseparabiliter -  center  1916–1918  Lesser common Coat of Arms  Lesser Coat of arms of Cisleithania and Transleithania under the Imperial Crown and the Crown of Saint Stephen resp., linked by the crowned Habsburg-Lorraine armorials, the Order of the Golden Fleece, and the motto indivisibiliter ac inseparabiliter (same as 1915 version with Croatia added to lesser arms of the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen) -  center  1915–1918  Medium common Coat of Arms  Medium Coat of arms of Cisleithania and Transleithania (see below) with supporters: a griffin in the dexter (for Austria) and an angel (for Hungary) in the sinister. - } == Coat of arms of the two constituent countries == { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" ! width=\\"110\\"Coat of arms!!width=\\"100\\"Date!!width=\\"250\\"Use!!width=\\"250\\"Description -  center  1915–1918  Austria's medium coat of arms  -  center  1915–1918  Austria's small coat of arms -  center  1915–1918 Hungary's medium coat of arms So-called \\"angel coat of arms\\" with coats of arms of Croatia, Slavonia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Transylvania, the city of Rijeka and Kingdom of Hungary -  center  1916–1918  Hungary's small coat of armsCoats of arms of Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Croatia, two kingdoms that legally made the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen - } ==Regional coat of arms== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" ! width=\\"110\\"Coat of arms!!width=\\"100\\"Date!!width=\\"250\\"Use!!width=\\"250\\"Description -  center  1867–1918  Kingdom of Bohemia  -  center  1867–1918  Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia Coat of arms of the Triune Kingdom -  center  1867–1918  Kingdom of Dalmatia  -  center  1804–1918  Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria  -  center  1867–1918  Duchy of Styria  -  center  1867–1918  Margravate of Istria  -  center  1878–1918  Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina  } ==See also== * Coat of arms of Austria * Coat of arms of Hungary ==External links== Category:Austria-Hungary Category:Austrian coats of arms Category:National symbols of Austria-Hungary Category:Hungarian coats of arms de:Österreich-Ungarn#Wappen ","title":"Coat of arms of Austria-Hungary"},{"id":"20367720","text":"The 1931 Ohio State Buckeyes football team represented Ohio State University in the 1931 college football season.

Mount Union played their home games at Mount Union Stadium in Alliance, Ohio since 1913, which makes it the oldest college football stadium in Ohio. The Purple Raiders have claimed 13 national championships, 30 conference titles and have 12 undefeated seasons. The first game was a 0–18 home-loss to Kenyon College, from Gambier, Ohio, on November 7, 1893. The first program victory came 11 days later in a 20–0 win over Salem University in Salem, West Virginia. The team competed as an independent from 1893 until 1913, and joined the OAC in 1914. The Purple Raiders played in the OAC for 71 years before winning their first conference title, which came in 1985 under coach Ken Wable. Since then, the program has won 30 titles in 35 years, including a 24-year streak from 1992 to 2015. During this run, the Purple Raiders went 214–2 versus OAC opponents. The title-streak spanned two coaches, Larry Kehres and Vince Kehres. John Carroll University ended the streak by winning the OAC title in 2016 when they beat Mount Union 31–28 on November 12, 2016. ==HistoryBeginnings (1893–1913)=== The first football game played by Mount Union was on the school's baseball field on November 7, 1893 against Kenyon College.http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&d;=p1210 In their first year they went 1–2, with their lone win coming against Salem University. The following season, the team had their first coach, Coach Davis, who led them to a 4–5 record. In 1895 and 1898 the team failed to field a team, but was able to have their first winning season, under Coach Battles in 1899, with a 5–1–1 record. It wasn't until 1903 and 1904 that the program maintained a head coach for two consecutive years, which was Pearl Sommerville, who went 4–11–1 in his two seasons. The program built stability when Robert Dawson took over as coach in 1909 and oversaw the program as it joined the Ohio Athletic Conference(OAC) in 1914. ===A growing program (1914–1961)=== In addition to Dawson's eight-year tenure and a transition to the OAC, Mount Union Stadium was built which gave the program a permanent home and even more stability. Over the course of Dawson's career, he went 49–24–4 (10–7, OAC). From 1920 to 1921, Mount Union was coached by Eddie Casey, who went on to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1968. Following his time at Mount Union, he coached Harvard, the National Football League's Washington Redskins, and the American Football League's Boston Bears. John M. Thorpe coached the Purple Raiders from 1922 to 1931, compiling a 55–32–7 (42–22–4, OAC) record. During his tenure, he served as both head coach and athletic director for the school. He was followed by Harry Geltz (1932–1941), who was unable to match his long- term success and left the program in 1941, when he went 1–15–1 (0–11, OAC) in his final two years. Pete Pederson was hired in 1942, but after one season the program was suspended due to World War II. The program remained suspended for three seasons and returned under Pederson in 1946. Pederson left after the 1949 season to take over as head coach at Marshall. ===Ken Wable era (1962–1985)=== Ken Wable was hired as the head coach for the Purple Raiders in 1962. He had previously served as an assistant coach at Wake Forest, Muskingum, and Cornell. Wable coached at Mount Union for 24 seasons, where he went 123–95–2. Beginning in 1979, Wable coached the team to a winning record of 7–2, and every season since, the program has maintained a winning record. Wable was named OAC Coach of the Year in 1982 and 1985. In 1985, he led the Purple Raiders to their first conference title and first berth in the NCAA Division III Football Playoffs. ===Larry Kehres era (1986–2012)=== Larry Kehres became the athletic director at Mount Union. In 1986, he took over as head football coach. His teams have won 11 NCAA Division III Football Championships (1993, 1996–1998, 2000–2002, 2005–2006, 2008, 2012). Kehres' teams hold several NCAA records. In addition to owning the two longest winning streaks in NCAA history, 54 wins in 1996–1999 and 55 wins in 2000–2003, the Mount Union Purple Raiders won a conference title in 23 of his 27 seasons; at Kehres' retirement, Mount Union had an ongoing streak of 21 conference titles. During his tenure, Kehres only lost eight games and tied three times in conference play. From 1994 to 2005, his squads won 100 consecutive games against Ohio Athletic Conference opponents. The 1994 season was the last under his tenure in which the Purple Raiders lost more than one game. Finally, his record of 72–3 (.960) in his final five seasons is the best in college football history, surpassing Tom Osborne's 60–3 (.952) in his final five seasons at Nebraska. Kehres is 3–1 against college football's all-time winningest coach, John Gagliardi, having beaten Gagliardi's St. John's squads twice in playoff match-ups and traded wins in the national title game in 2000 and 2003. In 2009, Kehres was named first vice president of the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA). He was elected President of the AFCA in January 2010. In 2013, Kehres retired after 27 years as head coach to become the Athletic Director of Mount Union. ===Vince Kehres era (2013–2019)=== Vince Kehres, who had previously served as defensive coordinator, was hired as the next head coach of Mount Union on May 8, 2013, replacing his father. During his time as coach Vince went 95–6 winning six OAC titles and two national titles in his seven years. He was named OAC Coach of the year three times. On January 13, 2020, it was announced that Vince was leaving the program to take a position with the Toledo Rockets. All together, Vince spent 13 years with Mount Union, eight of which were as defensive coordinator. He leaves the University with the highest winning percentage in program history. ==Head coaching history== {  + !Name !Seasons !Years !Games !Record !Winning pct !Conf. titles !Nat'l titles - Vince Kehres 2013–2019 7 101 95–6 .941 6 2 - Larry Kehres 1986–2012 27 359 332–24–3  23 11 - Ken Wable 1962–1985 24 220 123–95–2  1 0 - Duke Barret 1956–1961 6 52 15–37  0 0 - Nelson Jones 1950–1955 6 50 18–29–3  0 0 - Pete Pederson 1942, 1946–1949 8 43 22–20–1  0 0 - Harry Geltz 1932–1941 10 87 34–45–8  0 0 - John M.

Griggs Thomas Cott Griggs (19 June 1845 – 12 August 1903) was an English-born Latter-day Saint director and hymnwriter. He was the composer of the music to \\"Gently Raise the Sacred Strain\\", which has been used by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir for over three-quarters of a century as the opening number in the Music and the Spoken Word broadcasts. == Biography == Griggs was born in Dover, Kent, England. His mother joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) when Griggs was young and he was baptized a Latter-day Saint in May 1856. That same year he and his mother (his father was dead by this point) traveled with a group of Latter-day Saints to Boston. They stayed there for five years. During this time, Griggs belonged to a band formed by the LDS Church's Boston congregation. It was as a member of this band that he first had his desire to study music kindled. While in Boston, Griggs was also made a teacher in the LDS Church's Aaronic priesthood; his call to this office was given by Apostle George Q. Cannon. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, the Griggs heeded the counsel of LDS Church leaders to move to Utah Territory. The Griggs crossed the plains in Joseph Horne's Mormon pioneer company in 1861. Griggs first joined the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in 1866 when Charles John Thomas was the director. Griggs would continue as a member of the choir until his death in 1903. While Robert Sands was the conductor of the choir, Griggs served as the assistant conductor. Around 1880, Griggs left the choir for a short time to serve as a Mormon missionary in Britain. While away, he was appointed director of the choir, but on returning to Utah and realizing that Ebenezer Beesley was directing the choir well, he convinced to church leaders to appoint Beesley as the director and leave him as the assistant director. Besides his work with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Griggs also assisted in the compilation of the Latter-day Saint Psalmody and the first song book published by the Deseret Sunday School Union. Griggs had very deep connections to the LDS Church's Sunday School. From 1874 to 1891 he was superintendent of the Sunday School located in the 15th Ward in Salt Lake City. From 1891 to 1901 he was superintendent of the Sunday School for the Salt Lake Stake, thus being in charge of all Sunday Schools teaching Latter- day Saints in all of Salt Lake County. Griggs had also been made a member of the General Board of the Deseret Sunday School Union in 1889, and served in that position until his death in 1903. He was the Deseret Sunday School Union business manager from 1900 until his death. ==NotesReferences== * J. Spencer Cornwall. Stories of Our Mormon Hymns, p. 104-105. * Andrew Jenson.

Dodge. Dodge notes: :Other numerical signals are used by different railroads for different purposes, for instance, the signal “47” upon some railroads means “display signals”; while the signal “48” means “signals are displayed”.

The mine was formerly an illegal source of an estimated 15,000 tons of tin, or 4% of global production. In early 2018 artisanal mining activity has stopped, and Alphamin Resources Corp., an exploration company, based in Mauritius, is leading an exploration of the site. Bisie mine was established after a hunter discovered cassiterite there, which led to a frenzy. Following the Second Congo War, Mai Mai-allied militia in were to form the 85th brigade of the national army, receive training and then fragment when they deployed throughout the country. The militia refused to cooperate, however, and since then they controls the production and transport of tin, and the economics of Bisie, and nearby Manoire village, under the supervision of Colonel Samy Matumo. The mine's estimated tin production has been as high $100 million a year. The militia extorted \\"taxes\\" on everything from entry to the mine, to mud hut for shelter $50 a month. They also collect sales taxes, $20 a week, from small peddlers Tin was mined by hand through open-pit mining, and bags of tin that weighed 110 pounds or more were then dropped off at a central location, from which porters carried them on foot by individuals for over 30 miles, which typically took two days. When it arrived it was driven to the village of Kilambo, where it was loaded into Soviet-style cargo planes, flown to Goma, and sold to international dealers, such as Malaysia Smelting Corporation. The militia controlled the entire vicinity of Bisie and allowed only those who paid the taxes. Mining and Processing Congo (MPC), a consortium of British and South African investors, bought mining rights for Bisie in 2006, but the militia thwarted their attempts to reach the area. They in the past have shot and injured people associated with the consortium. After they were forced to evacuate, MPC applied for Force Majeure, which was granted on 26 March 2009. The mine was intimately linked to world markets. In October 2008 the prices of tin increased 37% with news of fighting in the region.ANALYSIS-Tin price spike shows Congo's growing origin role. Reuters. http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LU661455.htm According to some observers, the failure to inaugurate legal forms of production indicated corruption at the regional and federal levels of the DRC.

Two days later, he suspended all mining and mineral exports from North Kivu, South Kivu and Maniema Provinces.DR Congo bans mining in eastern Provinces. BBC News. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-11269360 This mining and export ban, together with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and pressure from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), caused buyers to buy less at lower prices. The Dodd- Frank legislation requires US-listed companies who obtain minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries, to implement due diligence measures. This legislation served as a catalyst for other international and regional initiatives to increase the accountability of corporations who source minerals from the eastern DRC and the wider region. The main buyers of cassiterite in the area, i.e. the Malaysian Smelting Corporation, various Chinese companies and Eurotrade International, boycotted Bisie ore, easy to identify due to its pink-red colour.MSA Group (2014), Bisie Tin Project NI-43-101 Technical Report, Mineral production and trade slowed during Kabila's ban, but did not completely stop. Wimmer and Hilgert (2011) presented satellite images which show continued artisanal mining at Bisie. They estimated that the actual mining area expanded by 0.74 ha during the ban, which was lifted 10 March 2011. By late May 2011, the DRC army completed its withdrawal from the Bisie tin mine. In August 2011, Alphamin Resources, a Canadian company, acquired a 70% interest in the Bisie Tin Project,Alphamin Resources (2012), and acquired the remaining 30% of the project in July 2012.Marketwired News Release, http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/alphamin-announces-acquisition- final-30-bisie-tin-project-democratic-republic-congo-tsx-venture- afm-1683136.htm In 2012, the number of artisanal miners at the site had declined sharply, due in great part to the deep tunnels now needed to reach the ore. The Force Majeure was lifted at the Bisie Project in February 2012, and Alphamin Resources established a camp on the Bisie ridge and began exploratory drilling in July 2012.Alphamin Resources (2012), Artisanal mining continuing on a smaller scale alongside Alphamin's exploration.

Southland had previously hosted a number of one off opportunities for New Zealand artists to work in the region, during the 1980s. These had been the work of Russell Beck and Dr Alf Poole, former Director and former Chair, Southland Museum and Art Gallery. This culminated in 1990 with the Art in the Sub-Antarctic programme, which provided an opportunity for Bill Hammond, Geerda Leenards, Shaun Burdon, Chester Nealie, Helen Mitchell, Lloyd Godman and Laurence Aberhardt, amongst others to participate in the joint Museum and DOC residency on the Sub-Antarctic Islands. Godman proposed the concept of the project as far back as 1984 and was instrumental in the organization as was Lou Sanson, Conservator for the Southland Conservancy in charge of Fiordland National Park, Stewart Island and the Subantarctic World Heritage Area. Anderson saw the residency as an opportunity to expose the Southland community, and the students of the Southern Institute of Technology, to the creative genius of some of New Zealand's greatest living artists. Artists are required to spend time at the Southern Institute of Technology and also to work in and around Southland. In 1999 the Trustees–Shirley Palmer, Gwen Neave, Russell Beck and Wayne P Marriott resolved to rename the Artist in Residence programme the William Hodges Fellowship. This was in recognition of the acquisition of William Hodges \\"Maori before a Waterfall\\", 1773 by the Southland Museum and Art Gallery in 1998. Hodges was regarded as the first artist in residence in Southland, having depicted the flora, fauna and people of the region during Captain Cook's second voyage to New Zealand.

Judith Tizard, Associate Minister, Arts, Culture and Heritage that year. The original architect was F W Burwell; Burwell House was constructed in 1879.http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=7777&m;=advanced, Dee Street Hospital (Former), Retrieved March 17, 2011. The Southland Museum and Art Gallery leased the property in 1988 and undertook some external restoration on the buildings. It used the Central Block for storage and in 2000 refurbished the South Wing for use as the accommodation for the artist- in-residence program. ==Southland Art Foundation Art Scholarship== * Cory Hughes, of Gore (Otago Polytechnic School of Art) * Jacqui Byars, of Gore (Otago Polytechnic School of Art) * Joshua McMillan, of Invercargill (Otago Polytechnic School of Art) ==Exhibitions== * Jade (curated by Russell Beck ) * Art in the Subantarctic (curated by Russell Beck ) * 1994, Anthony Stones: Familiar Faces (curated by Wayne P Marriott) * In Hodges Wake (curated by Wayne P Marriott ) * From Hodges, to Hodgkins, to Here (curated by Wayne P Marriott ) ==Bibliography== * William Hodges: http://wwar.com/masters/h/hodges-william.html * David Sarich: http://www.bowengalleries.co.nz/htm/bios/sarich.html * Joanna Margaret Paul: http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issue108/paulobit.htm * Cilla McQueen: http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/2008/13-05-08_press_release.html * Margaret Dawson: http://www.artists.co.nz/margaretdawson.htm * Ross T Smith: http://www.rosstsmith.co.nz/curriculum.html * Laurence Berry: http://www.whangareiartmuseum.co.nz/exhibitions/past/2005/takitimu_longitude.html * Lorraine Webb: http://www.quayschool.ac.nz/cv/lorraine_webb.html * Miranda Parkes: http://www.vavasourgodkin.co.nz/artists/bio.php?artist=Miranda+Parkes * James Walker: http://www.walkerjames.com/index.html * Peter Peryer: http://www.artsfoundation.org.nz/peryer.html * Joshua McMillan: http://www.studioworks.co.nz/artist-12.html * Anna Terry: http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/fileadmin/DepartmentalResources/Academic/Art/Programmes/MFA/MFA_Candidates/Ana_Terry/anaterrycv.pdf ==References== * Wayne P Marriott.(1996).

It lies in the southern outskirts of the city, south of the Al Sabeen Maternal Hospital. Originally named \\"Al Saleh Mosque\\", it was inaugurated in November 2008 by the late Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The mosque, in size, has a central hall that is with an occupancy capacity of 44,000. The building cost nearly US$60 million to construct. Open to non-Muslims, the mosque is frequented by tourists, and promotes moderate Islam. Security measures include police and bomb-sniffing dogs. After the Houthi-Saleh split in early December that concluded with the death of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Houthi-led authorities decided to rename the mosque from \\"Al Saleh Mosque\\" to \\"The People's Mosque\\". ==History== Saleh was criticized in 2008 for undertaking such a grand project when the country was suffering from socio-economic problems, wherein 42% of Yemenis lived in poverty and one in five were malnourished, according to United Nations estimates at the time. Several accidents occurred during its construction. The minarets collapsed multiple times, resulting in some deaths. After these occurrences, the site was used to build the Islamic college and the garden next to the mosque. It is also mentioned that Hayel Said, a local businessman, was threatened with reprisals and annulment of his business licenses if he did not pay for the building of the mosque. The mosque was the site of fighting during the conflict between Houthi and pro-Saleh forces in December 2017. At the time, rumours circulated in Sana’a that the Houthis intended to repaint the mosque's dome green. The People's Mosque appears on Yemeni currency. It is depicted on the face of the 2009 issue 250-rial note. File:-الدياني - panoramio.jpgThe mosque under construction in 2007 File:Saleh mosque.jpgThe completed mosque at night in 2009 ==Architecture and fittings== The mosque was constructed using different types of stone, including black basalt stones as well as limestone in red, white and black. The building is compared in its beauty and architectural elegance with the Masjid al-Haram, in Mecca. It was built in a fusion of \\"Yemeni architecture and Islamic styles\\", with many Quranic verses inscribed on the walls. The layout is referred to as \\"Himyarite architecture\\". The building has wooden roofs and seven ornate domes. There are five domes in the main roof, the main dome measuring in diameter with a height of above the mosque's roof. The other four domes measure with height of above the roof level of the mosque. Windows fitted with stained glass are locally referred to as qamariyah. Of the fifteen wooden doors, ten of them are situated on the eastern and western sides, and five open south towards the Islamic college and ablution areas. The doors are in height and include engraved copper patterns. Four of the six minarets are in height. The interior space is from floor to ceiling. While the plush carpeting contains intricate patterns, huge chandeliers have colorful and flower-like patterns. The three-storied building that includes the Quran College, also contains libraries and over two dozen classrooms, enough space to accommodate 600 students. Three large rooms are specifically for women; a small hall can accommodate 2,000 women. The mosque has a modern central air conditioning and sound systems, as well as full security arrangements, including bomb-sniffing dogs. The building stays lit through the night. Thorn Lighting International, through its distributor Al Zaghir, was the lighting contractor. Diah International served as the subcontractor for civil and mechanical engineering; Sodaco Engineering & Contracting also provided services in the building's construction.

The mosque was built on a large area of land that was acquired from Beit Zuhra, of a well-known local family; it is said that when Zuhra refused to sell the land at a low price, his eldest son was abducted for ransom and released three months later, after Zuhra agreed to sell the land for the mosque at a low price. Nearby is an amusement park named FunCity. The grounds include sprawling gardens, green courtyards, and parking space for thousands of vehicles, part of an integrated services plan.

The mosque also promotes moderate Islam, to a large number of people, which is considered a positive feature in the light of the Al-Qaeda influence. Women pray in an enclosed area separated from the main central hall. The People's Mosque is the only Yemeni mosque where police and bomb-sniffing dogs are used for inspecting worshippers. Prayers are also broadcast over the national television network to reach a larger viewing audience. ==References * One of the most beautiful adhaan ever!

He was convicted by a Peruvian military tribunal of high treason in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison. In 2003, after a new trial in accordance with a ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Castillo was sentenced to 23 years in prison. He was released on 14 October 2016 and expelled to Chile. ==Associations and joining the MRTA == Castillo joined the MIR in the 1960s. After the victory of Salvador Allende, he was employed by the Government, sent to Cuba to train, and eventually became a guard of the Palacio de La Moneda. In 1973, immediately after Augusto Pinochet's coup d'état he fled to Paris to study. In the University of Paris he met fellow students, future MRTA leader Víctor Polay Campos and ex-president of Perú, Alan García. From Paris, he traveled to El Salvador and fought in the civil war there for two years. After this, he went to Nicaragua to aid the government in fighting Contra rebels supported and armed by the CIA (USA). Around 1987, the military failure and numerous inside political differences that plagued the MRTA led Polay to contact Castillo and urge him to go to Peru and join his organization. Along with a few others, he formed a group of Chilean internationalist fighters who entered the ranks of the Peruvian terrorist group. Castillo was condemned by the Peruvian State for kidnapping prominent businessmen during this period, who were kept in cárceles del pueblo (people's jails) and usually exchanged for money to buy modern weaponry and equipment. == Trials and convictions == He was captured in 1993 after his involvement in a failed kidnapping operation. He allegedly lost his cool and fired his gun in the heat of a fight that broke out during the kidnapping operation of Pedro Miyasato Miyasato, killing businessperson David Ballón Vera and one of his brothers in arms.¿Quienes son los chilenos del MRTA (Spanish) After a three-hour trial, Castillo was summarily sentenced to life in prison by a special military court of masked judges for traición a la patria (high-treason). He was imprisoned in the high- security Yanamayo prison in Puno, Peru.El juicio criticado en el que Perù mandó a prisión a cuatro chilenos (Spanish) In 1999, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that the trial against Chilean citizens Jaime Francisco Sebastián Castillo Petruzzi, María Concepción Pincheira Sáez, Lautaro Enrique Mellado Saavedra, and Alejandro Luis Astorga Valdez was invalid due to a violation of nine articles of the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights by the Peruvian State. The court ordered the defendants guaranteed a new trial with full observance of due legal process. The Court also ordered the Peruvian State to pay to their families a total sum of US $10,000.00 (ten thousand dollars USA) or its equivalent in Peruvian national currency. Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos, Caso Castillo Petruzzi y otros Vs. Perú, Sentencia de 30 de mayo de 1999 (Spanish) In April 2001, Castillo and five other Chileans imprisoned in Yanamayo began a hunger strike asking to be repatriated to Chile. The following month they were transferred to Lima, and the new Peruvian government (Valentin Paniagua) decided to rejoin the Inter- American Commission for Human Rights and accepted its verdict in the case of Castillo Petruzzi. In June, the life sentence was overturned and a new trial began. In September 2003, Jaime Castillo was sentenced to 23 years in prison and civil damages of 250,000 Soles (Peruvian currency). The two other Chileans were released, one on probation. However, on October 14, 2009, Castillo and ten other prisoners were taken in the early morning hours to the special closed-regime prison of Ancon I (Piedras Gordas), on the outskirts of Lima. This was a radically different regime from Miguel Castro Castro prison, in Lima, where he had studied communication science, taught French and Italian, and worked as an craftsman. The same day, the government of Alan García enacted a new law eliminating prison benefits. After a year in Ancon I, Castillo was sent back to Castro Castro. The 29th of April 2011 he was attacked along with other political prisoners in Hall 5 by dozens of common criminals, in order to evict them and take control of the pavilion. The medical report says Castillo suffered from multiple bruises, 55 cuts to the head, a ruptured meniscus in his right knee and sharps injuries in the body. Following the incident, he was transferred back to prison Ancon I. After five months is surgery on his right knee and reconstructed ligaments, he was operated on while remaining handcuffed to the bed in the presence of police officers in the operating room, as is a common practice in Peru. He was discharged within 24 hours and sent back to Ancon I. Exercise therapy and recovery prescribed by doctors was 25% fulfilled, because of prison authorities' refusal. In Ancon I prison he had severe restrictions: he remained locked from 9 pm to 7 am, no TV or radio. The light went off at 10 pm and their access to the yard was reduced to four hours. He was not allowed outside communication. == Release and return to Chile == After three quarters of his sentence was served, in February 2010, advocates for Castillo complained that he could have been released with credit for work and study under extant Peruvian rules. His girlfriend, Maite Palacios, and his father, as well as numerous friends of Castillo in Chile and Peru, argued in favor of this.Revista Punto Final N°781 (May 2013): Chileno preso en Perú desde hace 20 años (Spanish) Instead, Castillo was released after completing his sentence on 14 October 2016. That same day, he was promptly expelled from the country and returned to Chile. After his return, he was asked by La Tercera whether he considered MRTA to be a terrorist organization, to which he responded that calling them terrorists was an insult because they were actually resistance fighters following the \\"rules of war\\". In February 2020, the government of Chile filed suit against Castillo, accusing him of inciting a subversion of the public order. ==See also== *Internal conflict in Peru *Chile-Peru relations *Nestor Cerpa Cartolini *Víctor Polay Campos ==References== Category:Chilean communists Category:Chilean people of Italian descent Category:Chilean revolutionaries Category:Internal conflict in Peru Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jaime Castillo Petruzzi"},{"id":"20368151","text":"Seasons is an album by David Murray which was released on the Pow Wow label.

He was born in Northside, Workington, Cumberland, England, but spent his teenage years in Adelaide, Australia, where he met his songwriting and musical partner Trevor Spencer. He is best known for his association with Cliff Richard and producing Take On Me by a-ha. ==Career Musician === Tarney was part of the influx of British migrants who settled in Adelaide during the height of the 1960s pop music boom. His first major group in Australia was James Taylor Move, a four-piece outfit regarded as one of Australia's first psychedelic rock bands; the original line-up in 1967 comprised Tarney on bass, his longtime collaborator Trevor Spencer on drums, Kevin Peek on lead guitar and Robert (R.J.) Taylor on vocals. Both the James Taylor Move and their rising-star contemporaries the Twilights were formed by various members of two earlier Adelaide bands, Johnny Broome and the Handels, and the Hurricanes. James Taylor Move's (JTM) early concerts were in support of the Twilights, who soon moved to Melbourne. JTM built up a solid following in Adelaide and in early 1967 they won the South Australian final of the Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds. They headed to Melbourne in July for the national finals, and although they were defeated by the Groop they decided to remain there. Securing a deal with Festival Records they released their debut single \\"And I Hear the Fire Sing\\" / \\"Magic Eyes\\" in August 1967. The A-side was apparently considered too radical for local radio, but the B-side was picked up, received plenty of airplay in the southern states and became a Top 40 hit in Melbourne. In October, Festival released their second and final single, \\"Baby Jane\\", backed by the raga-influenced \\"Still I Can Go On\\". Peek left the band in May 1968, and was replaced by two new members, John Pugh and organist Lance Dixon. Lead singer Robert Taylor left the following month, and he was replaced by the 18-year-old blues/soul singer Wendy Saddington. This second line-up lasted only a few more months and made no commercial recordings before their split at the end of 1968. Tarney and Spencer were next reunited with Kevin Peek in the Kevin Peek Trio (1968–69). They moved back to the UK in 1969, where they recruited an old Adelaide friend Terry Britten (ex Twilights) to join the group, which was then renamed Quartet (1969–70). Quartet recorded one album with Decca Records which remains unreleased, but two singles were issued on Decca: \\"Joseph\\" / \\"Mama Where Did You Fail\\" (F13072, 1970) and \\"Now\\" / \\"Will My Lady Come\\" (F12974, 1970). After the demise of Quartet, the four members became session musicians and songwriters, recording and writing for many top UK acts including Cliff Richard, Ray Martin Hoskins, GTO Records/the Springfield Revival and Olivia Newton-John. Around this time Tarney also joined the Shadows and was a member from 1973 to 1977. In 1975 he was one half of Tarney/Spencer Band along with Trevor Spencer. They signed a 10-album deal with A&M; Records, but met with little success and after three album releases, the group disbanded and discontinued their contract with agreement by the record label. === Producer === In 1979, Tarney began the biggest period of his career when he wrote and arranged the Cliff Richard No. 1, \\"We Don't Talk Anymore\\". This led to him becoming Richard's record producer of his next two albums, I'm No Hero (1980) and Wired for Sound (1981). At this time he also wrote and produced Barbara Dickson and Leo Sayer – his distinctive sound being heard on the hit singles \\"January February\\" and \\"More Than I Can Say\\". Tarney went on to bigger success in the mid-1980s when he teamed up with Norwegian pop band A-ha. Producing the second version (after Tony Mansfield) of their first single \\"Take On Me\\" (1984), the song went on to become a worldwide hit. He worked on the band's biggest selling first three albums, being a co- Producer of Hunting High and Low (1985), and Producer of Scoundrel Days (1986) and Stay on These Roads (1988). He renewed his working relationship with the band in the production of their album release Cast in Steel (2015). He produced David Cassidy's comeback 1985 album Romance, which included the top ten hit \\"The Last Kiss\\" co-written by Raymond Hoskins and David Cassidy. The song had previously been written for Cliff Richard for his 1981 album Wired for Sound. The Richard version however, contained different lyrics and was titled Young Love. He returned again to write and produce for the Cliff Richard albums Always Guaranteed (1987) and Stronger (1989). Alan Tarney wrote two numbers for the Sky album Cadmium (1983) - \\"Return to Me\\" and \\"A Girl in Winter\\" - at the request of long-time associate, and Sky member, Kevin Peek. Tarney's other production credits include the Hollies, Bow Wow Wow, the Dream Academy, Squeeze, Matthew Sweet, Voice of the Beehive and the Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute album. ==Personal life== Tarney lives in Richmond, London. He has a daughter, Mia, a professional artist painter; and a son, Oliver, who works in the film industry. ==Selected discographyWith the Tarney/Spencer Band=== Albums: *1974 \\"Something out of a dream.Musical Rock Show Joe Brown & Introducing Ray Hoskins as Sparrow producer Alan Tarney Brian Eno.Polydor MGM Curb *1976 Tarney and Spencer (Bradley's) *1978 Three's a Crowd (A&M;) *1979 Run for Your Life (A&M;) *UICY-90680: A&M; 60s & 70s Single Box [Japanese Import] – features two tracks by the Tarney/Spencer band. 5-CD box set CD reissues *2003 Tarney and Spencer (Castle Communications plc), UK with four bonus tracks *1993 Run for Your Life (Polydor), German. 1,500 copies *19??

His parents were both from families that came from England in the 1600s.http://www.laokay.com/halac/RanchoLosAlamitos.htm Stearns went to Mexico in about 1826, where he became a naturalized citizen. ==Los Angeles== In 1829, Stearns emigrated to Monterey, California, then settled in the Pueblo de los Ángeles, present day Los Angeles, California. He obtained a government concession to build a warehouse at San Pedro, the nearest seaport. Later, he established a stagecoach route connecting San Pedro Bay with the Los Angeles pueblo. In 1831, he built a three-story flour mill on North Spring Street, Los Angeles. Soon, Stearns became one of the most prominent and influential citizens of the pueblo. In 1842 Stearns bought his first rancho, the Rancho Los Alamitos between Los Angeles and the harbor. A drought between 1862 and 1864 which was said to have resulted in the death of 50,000 cattle on Stearns land alone. Stearns mortgaged the rancho to Michael Reese, who then purchased it at a sheriff's sale. Reese's estate was then sold to John W. Bixby and Isaias W. Hellman, a founder of the Farmers and Merchants Bank. In 1842 Stearns made the first shipment to the U.S. Mint of California gold on record. On July 8, 1843, his package of 1,843 ounces of placer gold valued at $19 an ounce was deposited in the Philadelphia Mint by Alfred Robinson. Following the Mexican-American War, Stearns represented Los Angeles to the US military government of California, 1848–1850. He was a delegate to the 1849 California Constitutional Convention, First California Constitutional Convention representing the district of Los Angeles. Later he was California State Assemblyman, and a Los Angeles County Supervisor and a member of the Los Angeles Common Council, the legislative branch of the city government. ==Ranchos== Stearns' Ranchos, 1875 By 1860, Stearns was the most important land owner in Southern California, and owned Rancho La Habra, Rancho Los Coyotes, Rancho San Juan Cajón de Santa Ana, Rancho Las Bolsas, Rancho La Bolsa Chica, Rancho Jurupa and Rancho La Sierra (Sepulveda). Stearns was hit hard by the drought of 1863–64, causing the loss of thousands of cattle. By 1868 Stearns had suffered such financial reverses that he mortgaged all his ranch assets in what were then Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. === Robinson Trust === To obtain the necessary operating capital, he formed a real estate sales partnership, with Alfred Robinson and four San Francisco investors; Samuel Brannan, E. F. Northam, Charles B. Polhemus, and Edward Martin; that became known as the Robinson Trust in 1868. He turned over to the Trust, including all but one of his ranchos. The era of the large cattle ranchos was waning. In its place came agriculture, as ranchos were broken up and generally sold in farms and ranches. The Robinson Trust acted as sales agents for the subdivisions. To gain maximum coverage for their campaign, they linked themselves to the California Immigrant Union and helped guide that organization's sales pitches. Despite considerable friction between Stearns and the other members of the trust, the Robinson Trust succeeded. By 1870 Stearns had escaped the debts incurred by the drought of the 1860s and was on his way to accumulating another fortune. ==Family life== Stearns was nicknamed \\"Cara de Caballo\\" (Horse Face) because of his long-jawed countenance.Portrait of a drawing of Abel Stearns, ca.1840-1860 In 1841, he married Arcadia Bandini of the wealthy Bandini family. They lived and entertained at their Los Angeles home, the historic Don Abel Stearns House. Stearns died on August 23, 1871, at age 72 in the Grand Hotel, San Francisco, California, and is interred at Calvary Cemetery, Los Angeles.Public Radio InternationalJournal of San Diego History ==See also== *Casa De San Pedro in 1834 the Casa was sold to Abel Stearns. *List of pre-statehood mayors of Los Angeles, California *History of Los Angeles *Ranchos of California **List of Ranchos of California ==References== Category:California pioneers Category:Businesspeople from Los Angeles Category:Land owners from California Category:Mayors of Los Angeles Category:Los Angeles Common Council (1850–1889) members Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Category:1798 births Category:1871 deaths Category:Naturalized citizens of Mexican California Category:American emigrants to Mexico Category:Burials at Calvary Cemetery (Los Angeles) Category:People from Los Angeles Category:People from Lunenburg, Massachusetts Category:History of Los Angeles Category:History of Los Angeles County, California Category:19th century in Los Angeles ","title":"Abel Stearns"},{"id":"20368230","text":"Cleburne Building (also known as 924 West End Avenue) is an apartment building located at the northeast corner of West End Avenue and West 105th Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City.

His parents were Joseph K. Thomas and Margaret Spotswood. Charles J. Thomas was a member of an orchestra with his father by the age of nine, playing at the Theatre Royal. He had been trained up to this point in music by his father, who made his living in orchestras. In 1851 he joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The rest of his family joined the LDS Church shortly afterward, following his being healed after being administered to by elders of the church. During the 1850s, Thomas traveled with an Italian opera company and some of his compositions were played at London theatres. In 1861, Thomas emigrated to Utah Territory. Among the first things Thomas did on arriving in Utah was taking over the band of the late Ballo. He not only lead the Tabernacle Choir for a time but was also the first orchestral director at the Salt Lake Theatre. From 1862 until 1865 Thomas was director of the Tabernacle Choir. He was the first director to lead the choir in the current Salt Lake Tabernacle building. From 1865 until 1871, Thomas lived first in the St. George area and then in Beaver, Utah. In both locations he was involved in organizing choirs and teaching music. Thomas was asked by Brigham Young to return to Salt Lake City in 1871 and again take the lead of the Salt Lake Theatre Orchestra. In the following years in Salt Lake City Thomas formed the first male glee club in Salt Lake City in 1876. He also taught music lessons in Salt Lake City, where he had among other students Heber J. Grant.Heber J. Grant, \\"Practice Makes Possible\\" (reprint), New Era, February 2004, p. 37. In 1887, Thomas served as a Mormon missionary in Great Britain. After his return to Salt Lake City, he was head of music for the Salt Lake Temple. He also was appointed by Evan Stephens to direct a choir made up of those members of the Tabernacle Choir that did not go to the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893 and thus provide music at the Tabernacle while most of the Tabernacle Choir was absent. Thomas married Charlotte Gibbs. Charlotte died in 1875 and in 1878 Thomas married Amy H. Adams. Between his two wives Thomas had a total of 13 children, however only six of his children were alive in 1904, the rest having died primarily at very early ages. Thomas's sister Margaret married George Romney (1831–1920),Andrew Jenson. Latter-day Saints Biographical Encyclopedia. vol. 2, p. 538-539, quoted at mormonhistory.org biography section who was a brother of Miles Park Romney, the grandfather of George W. Romney, and the great-grandfather of Mitt Romney. Among the works written by Thomas was the music to \\"Sons of Michael, He Approaches\\", a hymn that was in previous Latter-day Saint hymnals, but is not contained in the latest English-language hymnal of the LDS Church. He also wrote pieces titled \\"Harken and Lo a Voice\\" and \\"Harken, O Gentiles\\" in the 1850s. == References Sources=== * J. Spencer Cornwall. Stories of Our Mormon Hymns. p. 179-180 * B. H.

The outbuildings include a smokehouse with architectural detailing identical to the main house, a carriage house, a dairy, and a cook's quarters. Westwood Plantation was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district on November 21, 1974. Boundary increases were made to the district on March 15, 1984 and December 10, 1984. ==History== James Lewis Price migrated to Perry County in 1835 from his native Richmond, Virginia. He began building Westwood in 1836, naming it after his grandfather's Virginia home. His slaves cleared the land and were responsible for the construction of his estate, including the main house. By 1850 Price had finished work on Westwood, now its sprawling plan was complete with projecting corner pavilions and two-story end loggias with recessed cast-iron porches. Westwood currently continues to be owned by Price descendants. The 1860 United States Census of Perry County indicates that James Lewis Price owned 108 slaves in that year. ==Gallery== Image:Westwood Plantation 02.jpgRear and side view of the exterior in 1935 Image:Westwood Plantation 03.jpgView through the dining room into the parlor Image:Westwood Plantation 04.jpgMain hall and stairway ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Perry County, Alabama Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama Category:Houses completed in 1850 Category:Greek Revival houses in Alabama Category:Italianate architecture in Alabama Category:Plantation houses in Alabama Category:Houses in Perry County, Alabama Category:Historic districts in Perry County, Alabama Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama Category:Plantations in Alabama Category:1850 establishments in Alabama ","title":"Westwood (Uniontown, Alabama)"},{"id":"20368358","text":"Perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, is a synthetic perfluorinated carboxylic acid and fluorosurfactant that is also an environmental contaminant found in people and wildlife along with PFOS and PFOA. ==Chemistry and properties== In acidic form it is a highly reactive strong acid. In its conjugate base form as a salt it is stable and commonly ion paired with ammonium. In the commercial product Surflon S-111 (CAS 72968-3-88) it is the primary compound present by weight. PFNA is used as surfactant for the production of the fluoropolymer polyvinylidene fluoride. Supporting Information (PDF). It is produced mainly in Japan by the oxidation of a linear fluorotelomer olefin mixture containing F(CF2)8CH=CH2. It can also be synthesized by the carboxylation of F(CF2)8I. PFNA can form from the biodegradation of 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol. Additionally, it is considered a probable degradation product of many other compounds. PFNA is the largest perfluorinated carboxylic acid surfactant. Fluorocarbon derivatives with terminal carboxylates are only surfactants when they possess five to nine carbons. Fluorosurfactants reduce the surface tension of water down to half of what hydrocarbon surfactants can by concentrating at the liquid-air interface due to the lipophobicity of fluorocarbons. PFNA is very stable and is not known to degrade in the environment by oxidative processes because of the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond and the electronegativity of fluorine. ==Environmental and health concerns== Like the eight-carbon PFOA, the nine-carbon PFNA is a developmental toxicant and an immune system toxicant. However, longer chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) are considered more bioaccumulative and toxic. PFNA is an agonist of the nuclear receptors PPARα and PPARγ. In the years between 1999–2000 and 2003–2004, the geometric mean of PFNA increased from 0.5 parts per billion to 1.0 parts per billion in the US population's blood serum. and has also been found in human follicular fluid In a cross- sectional study of 2003–2004 US samples, a higher (13.9 milligram per deciliter) total cholesterol level was observed in when the highest quartile was compared to the lowest. Non-HDL cholesterol (or \\"bad cholesterol\\") levels were also higher in samples with more PFNA. In bottlenose dolphins from Delaware Bay, PFNA was the perfluorinated carboxylic acid measured in the highest concentration in blood plasma; it was found in concentrations well over 100 parts per billion. PFNA has been detected in polar bears in concentrations over 400 parts per billion. PFNA was the perfluorinated chemical measured in the highest concentration in Russian Baikal seals. However, PFOS is the perfluorinated compound that dominates in most wildlife biomonitoring samples. Supporting Information (PDF). ===Drinking water regulations=== In the United States there are no federal drinking water standards for PFNA as of late 2018. The State of New Jersey published a drinking water standard for PFNA, the first state to do so, in September 2018. Public water systems in New Jersey will be required to meet a maximum contaminant level standard of 13 parts per trillion (ppt). ===Food Regulation=== In 2020, the European Food Safety Authority added PFNA in its revised safety threshold for PFAS that accumulate in the body. They set the threshold for a group of four PFAS of a tolerable weekly intake of 4.4 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per week. ===Product Restrictions=== In 2020, a California bill was passed banning PFNA as an intentionally added ingredient from cosmetics. ==See also== *Organofluorine compounds ==References *Perfluorocarboxylic Acid Content in 116 Articles of Commerce PDF *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Polyfluorochemicals fact sheet *Perfluorinated substances and their uses in Sweden *Perfluoroalkylated substances, Aquatic environmental assessment *Chain of Contamination: The Food Link, Perfluorinated Chemicals (PFCs) Incl.

Bush. It was built in 1928 at Kiel, Germany by Germania Werft. This vessel was named after the smaller schooner yacht Coronet of 1885, built for Irving's father Rufus T. Bush and known for its victory in an 1887 transatlantic ocean race. The first Coronet was also the vessel upon which young Irving Bush and his family had sailed around the world in 1888.\\"Prominent Citizens of New York: Rufus T. Bush\\" in the Magazine of Western History/National Magazine (Jan. 1891) 13 (3): 378, full text on Google Books The new diesel-powered Coronet featured a library, a living room with an open fireplace, a dining room, six staterooms (each with its own bathroom), and space for a crew of 20. The yacht had a 7,000 mile range.\\"Graces of Clipper in New Bush Yacht,\\" New York Evening Post, Oct. 17, 1928 During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Coronet served as a pleasure yacht, for example cruising around the Mediterranean Sea\\"Olympic Arrives with Notable List ,\\" New York Times, Sep. 19, 1928, pg. 24 and participating in New York Yacht Club activities on Long Island Sound.James Robbins, \\"Shawara is First in Race on Sound,\\" New York Times, Aug. 30, 1930, pg. 10 From 1931 through the end of the 1930s, Coronet stayed in south Florida, in and near Miami, maintained and ready for service, yet inactive. In 1935, Bush transferred ownership of the yacht to his wife, Marian Spore Bush. As both husband and wife were officially residents of New York City, and the Coronet was registered in New York but kept in Florida, the yacht became the subject of a property taxation dispute, which was finally settled by the Florida Supreme Court in 1939. ==1941–1943: Coastal Patrol Yacht USS Opal== Coronet was purchased by the United States Navy from M.S. Bush on 27 January 1941 and converted for naval service at Merrill-Stevens Drydock Co. in Miami, Florida. It was commissioned Opal on 10 June 1941. Opal reported 23 August 1941 at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba for service in the 10th Naval District. The vessel patrolled off Cuba and among the Greater Antilles prior to arrival at Trinidad, 24 April 1942, for similar “inshore patrol” duties. Early in October 1941 it sailed to the Charleston Navy Yard for installation of new sound detection equipment before returning to action against German submarines in the Caribbean Sea. Opal frequently served on escort missions between Guantanamo and Trinidad during the first eight months of 1943. ==1943–1960: Ecuadorian Navy's Manabi== In 1943, the US Navy reassigned Opal to serve as a training ship for Ecuadorian naval crews. It was lent to Ecuador on 23 September 1943 under the Lend-Lease Program and renamed Manabi. The United States sold the vessel to Ecuador on 13 May 1949 and the US Navy struck its name from the Navy List on 7 June 1949.

He developed common standards for the colleges and universities in the system, supported affirmative action to recruit women and minority students, and assisted the establishment of four new campuses. ==Early life and education== Glenn Dumke was born in 1917 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. When he was age five, his family moved to Glendale, California. His father, William Frederick Dumke, was a buyer for a southern California grocery business. His mother, Marjorie Schroeder Dumke, was a homemaker who later went to work as a title searcher in Los Angeles. Dumke attended UCLA's Training School and graduated from Glendale Hoover High School in 1934. He earned a history degree from Occidental College in 1938. He completed an M.A. in history from Occidental and a Ph.D. in history from UCLA in 1942. ==Career as university professor and administrator== Dumke's first academic job was teaching Western American and Hispanic history at Occidental College. During the 1940s he conducted extensive research and published his most notable historical works, including The Boom of the Eighties in Southern California (1944) and A History of the Pacific Area in Modern Times (1949), co-authored with Osgood Hardy. In 1950 he became Dean of Faculty at Occidental. In 1957 he accepted the position of president at San Francisco State College. Shortly thereafter, he was invited to join the committee creating the California Master Plan for Higher Education (1960), which distinguished among the University of California (UC) system, whose research campuses would offer degrees through the Ph.D., the California State Universities & Colleges (now known as CSU), which would offer bachelor's and master's degrees, and the California Community Colleges, which would offer two-year programs. Dumke was appointed the first vice chancellor for academic affairs of the CSU system. When Buell Gallagher, the first chancellor of the new system, resigned suddenly after only eight months on the job, Dumke was offered the position. As CSU chancellor from 1962 to 1982, Dumke's accomplishments were significant. Under his leadership 19 separate state colleges became the largest system of higher education in the United States, and enrollment tripled to 319,000 students. He created a system-wide academic senate. He began the practice of meeting monthly with the campus presidents, giving them significant input on system policies. He pushed for strong accreditation standards, and a system- wide general education program. He advocated for admission standards, which the CSU finally adopted in 1990. During his term of office, he helped create four new campuses at Dominguez Hills, Bakersfield, San Bernardino and Sonoma. Dumke was a staunch opponent of student and faculty strikes in the period of unrest from 1965 to 1971, issuing a ban on faculty strikes in 1969. Other initiatives of Dumke include the establishment of off-campus and extension programs in 1971, and a 1978 five-year affirmative action plan to increase enrollment of women and minorities in the CSU. ==Later life== After his retirement in 1982, Dumke was president of several think-tanks, including the conservative Institute for Contemporary Studies (1982-1989) and the Foundation for the 21st Century (1986-1989). He also sat on the governing boards for Pepperdine University, University of Redlands, and the California Chamber of Commerce. Among his national awards were the USO Distinguished American Award and the award for Individual Excellence in Education from the Freedoms Foundation. He was a member of a number of social clubs, including the Bohemian Club and the Commonwealth Club of California. He was married to Dorothy Robinson Dumke for 44 years. ==Books by Glenn S.

Its main activities are reflected on the edge.org website, edited by publisher and businessman John Brockman. The site is a critically noted online magazine exploring scientific and intellectual ideas. ==Edge.org== A long-running feature on Edge is the Annual Question, which gathers many short essays on topical questions from Brockman's broad network of thought leaders in philosophy and science; these essays are usually published collectively as a book shortly thereafter. Many of the feature articles on Edge are structured as video interviews with a prominent figure in some scientific field (such as Daniel Kahneman or Steven Pinker) discussing his or her recent research or mental preoccupations, in a free-flowing spiel from which the interviewer—often Brockman himself—is largely absent. This is usually accompanied by a full transcript which includes more material than the video portion (which is typically edited for brevity, down to less than an hour in length). Because Brockman functions primarily as a literary agent, subjects featured on Edge are in most cases lucid communicators, even when relating new developments in highly specialized research areas. The lucid exposition of challenging and novel science is Edge's primary calling card. A less common format is video conference proceedings or Master Class round-table seminars on a set subject matter, such as Philip E. Tetlock's seminar on superforecasting from 2015, or Richard Thaler's seminar on behavioural psychology from 2008. Edge adds new content relatively infrequently, with no set schedule, apart from the Annual Question. ==The Third Culture== The Third Culture is the growing movement towards reintegration of literary and scientific thinking and is a nod toward British scientist C. P. Snow's concept of the two cultures of science and the humanities. John Brockman published a book of the same name whose themes are continued at the Edge website. Here, scientists and others are invited to contribute their thoughts in a manner readily accessible to non-specialist readers. In doing so, leading thinkers are able to communicate directly with each other and the public without the intervention of middlemen such as journalists and journal editors. Many areas of academic work are incorporated, including genetics, physics, mathematics, psychology, evolutionary biology, philosophy and computing technology. ==Edge Question== Edge poses its members an annual question: *1998:\\"What questions are you asking yourself?\\" *1999: \\"What is the most important invention in the past two thousand years?\\" *2000: \\"What is today's most important unreported story?\\" *2001: \\"What questions have disappeared?\\" and \\"What now?\\" This was the only year with two separate questions. *2002: \\"What is your question? ... Why?\\" *2003: \\"What are the pressing scientific issues for the nation and the world, and what is your advice on how I can begin to deal with them?\\" *2004: \\"What's your law?\\" *2005: \\"What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it?\\" The responses generated were published as a book under the title What We Believe But Cannot Prove: Today's Leading Thinkers on Science in the Age of Certainty with an introduction by the novelist Ian McEwan. *2006: \\"What is your dangerous idea\\"? The responses formed the book What Is Your Dangerous Idea?, which was published with an introduction by Steven Pinker and an afterword by Richard Dawkins. *2007: \\"What are you optimistic about? Why?\\", which resulted in a companion publication. *2008: \\"What have you changed your mind about?\\" and the corresponding book published shortly thereafter. *2009: \\"What Will Change Everything?

Because they were not authorized to carry weapons at the time, the volunteers had to weigh no less than . Later the next year, the town constable became the first chief of police. After several changes to staff and procedures, the force was officially created by ordinance on November 1, 1875. The police commission took over the management of the department in 1909. Aldermen controlled the force until the commission form of government was established in 1915. The police were then placed under control of a Commissioner of Public Safety. In 1932, the department was using vehicles and had the first radios put into use. The radios at the time were one-way and required the dispatcher to repeat the message for service multiple times, slowly and loudly as there was no way for the beat officer to acknowledge receipt of transmission. By 1934, the police cars were equipped with Thomson .45 caliber submachine guns and riot gas deployment devices. In 1938, the first two-way radios were placed into operation. Today the department consists of approximately 200 sworn officers. The Asheville Police Department has been accredited through the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) since 1994. ==Organization== The Asheville Police department is divided into two Bureaus overseen by Deputy Chiefs, the Administration Bureau and the Operations Bureau. The department is then divided into five divisions: Patrol Operations, Special Services, Administrative Services, Investigations and Operations Support, and Financial Services. Currently, the department's patrol operations are decentralized into three geographic areas: Adam District (West Asheville), Baker District (South and East Asheville), and Charlie District (North and Central Asheville). The department also has a variety of specialized units such as: K-9, Downtown Unit (bike patrol), Emergency Response Unit, Hazardous Devices Team, and Patrol Special Services. ==References * Official Asheville Police Weblink *Asheville Police Department Facebook Category:Asheville, North Carolina Category:Municipal police departments of North Carolina ","title":"Asheville Police Department"},{"id":"20368496","text":"The Gate may refer to: ==Places== * The Gate, Newcastle, an entertainment venue in Newcastle upon Tyne, England * The Gate Arts Centre, Cardiff, Wales * The Gate Shams Abu Dhabi, a development project in Abu Dhabi ==Literature== * The Gate (novel), a 1910 novel by Japanese author Natsume Sōseki * The Gate (autobiography), a 2003 autobiography by French writer François Bizot ==Film== * The Gate (1987 film), a 1987 Canadian horror film * The Gate (2014 film), a 2014 French film ==Music== * The Gate (Kurt Elling album), a 2011 album by Kurt Elling * The Gate (Swans album), a 2015 album by Swans * \\"The Gate\\" (song), a 2017 song by Björk * \\"The Gate\\", a song by Sam Roberts on the album Chemical City * \\"The Gate\\", a track on the album Light & Shade by Mike Oldfield ==Other uses== * TheGATE.ca, a Canadian entertainment website * The Gates, an art installation by Christo and Jeanne-Claude in Central Park in New York City * The Gates (TV series), a 2010 American supernatural crime drama television series on ABC * The Báb (1819–1850), which means the \\"Gate\\" and is the title taken by the founder of Bábism ==See also== * * * Gates (disambiguation) * Gate (disambiguation) ","title":"The Gate"},{"id":"20368500","text":"Dong Jin (; 724 – March 13, 799http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%ADs%A4%B8&yy;=15&ycanzi;=&mm;=2ⅆ=&dcanzi;=%A4B%A4%A1), courtesy name Huncheng (混成), was an official and general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong. == Background == Dong Jin was born in 724, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Hezhong Municipality (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi)Old Book of Tang, vol. 145 . and claimed ancestry from the Han Dynasty scholar Dong Zhongshu. Dong Jin's great-grandfather Dong Renwan (董仁琬) served as a prefectural education official, and his father Dong Boliang (董伯良) served as a county secretary.New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Dong Jin passed the imperial examinations, although it is not clear when that occurred.New Book of Tang, vol. 151 . == During Emperor Suzong's and Daizong's reigns == Early in the Zhide era (756-758) of Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong, when Emperor Suzong was at Pengyuan (彭原, in modern Qingyang, Gansu) during the Anshi Rebellion as the armies of the rebel Yan occupied the capital Chang'an, Dong Jin went to Pengyuan and submitted a petition for an audience with the emperor, Emperor Suzong made him a Xiaoshulang (校書郎), an editor at the Palace Library. Later, he was made the secretary general at the ministry of armory supplies (衛尉丞, Weiwei Cheng), and then the military advisor to the prefect of Fen Prefecture (汾州, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). Subsequently, when the prefect, Cui Yuan, was made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), he invited Dong to serve as his secretary.It is not completely clear when Cui was made the military governor of Huainan, but he was already military governor by 761 and remained there until his death in 768. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 108 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 222. Soon, though, he was recalled to Chang'an to serve as an imperial censor, first under the title Dianzhong Shiyushi (殿中侍御史) and then Shiyushi (侍御史); he later successively served as Zhuke Yuanwailang (主客員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (禮部, Lǐbu); and then Cibu Langzhong (祠部郎中), a supervisorial low-level official at the ministry of rites. In 769, when Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong created a daughter of the general Pugu Huai'en to be Princess Chonghui, to be married to the khan of Huige, the official Li Han (李涵) served as Princess Chonghui's escort. Li Han invited Dong to serve as his secretary. When they arrived at Huige headquarters, the Huige officials threatened Li Han over Tang's late payment for horses that it had purchased from Huige. Li Han did not dare to respond, but Dong responded, pointing out that Tang had been willing to absorb Huige's excess horses without demanding better quality and that Huige should be appreciative; his responses drew respect from the Huige officials.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. Upon the completion of the mission, he was made Sixun Langzhong (司勳郎中), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Lìbu, note different tone than the ministry of rites), and then the deputy head of the archival bureau (秘書少監, Mishu Shaojian). == During Emperor Dezong's reign == After Emperor Daizong died in 779 and succession of his son Emperor Dezong, Dong Jin was made the minister of worship (太常卿, Taichang Qing). Because he had a reputation for being hardworking and careful, he was subsequently made You Sanqi Changshi (右散騎常侍), a high-level consultant at the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng) as well as deputy chief imperial censor (御史中丞, Yushi Zhongcheng), but acting as the chief imperial censor. Soon, he was made the prefect of Hua Prefecture (華州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) as well as defender of Tong Pass. In 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), then at Chang'an to await deployment to the east to combat warlords, mutinied, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The Jingyuan soldiers supported the general Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu soon declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. Zhu sent his general He Wangzhi (何望之) to attack Hua Prefecture, and Dong abandoned Hua Prefecture and fled to Fengtian, although the Tang general Luo Yuanguang (駱元光) soon recaptured Hua Prefecture. When Dong arrived at Fengtian, Emperor Dezong made him the principal of the imperial university (國子祭酒, Guozi Jijiu), and soon made him a special emissary to the region north of the Yellow River.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 229. As he was returning from his mission and went through Hezhong, Hezhong had been occupied by Li Huaiguang — a major Tang general who had rebelled recently. Dong tried to persuade Li Huaiguang to rejoin the imperial cause, and it was said that due to Dong's efforts, while Li Huaiguang did not resubmit to Emperor Dezong, he also did not join Zhu in attacking Emperor Dezong. After Chang'an was recaptured from Zhu, Dong accompanied Emperor Dezong back to Chang'an and was made a general of the imperial guards, and then Shangshu Zuo Cheng (尚書左丞), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng). At that time, his colleague as secretary general, Yuan Xiu (元琇), was in charge of financial affairs, but was demoted due to false accusations by the chancellor Han Huang. Dong met with the other chancellors and tried to speak in Yuan's defense, and while he was unsuccessful in doing so, was praised by other officials for doing so. Soon thereafter, he was again made the minister of worship. As of 789, Li Mi was in effect the only chancellor, and Li repeatedly recommended both Dong and Dou Can, believing that Dou was capable in financial matters and Dong was morally upright. Emperor Dezong initially did not agree with Li's assessment, but in 789, with Li being seriously ill, he again recommended Dou and Dong, and Emperor Dezong finally agreed. He made Dong Menxia Shilang (門下侍郎), the deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng). He also gave both Dou and Dong the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making them chancellors de facto. Li died shortly after, and it was said that while both Dou and Dong were chancellors, Dou had greater grasp of power and put many of his associates in powerful positions. Dong was said to be careful in his behavior, and did not leak contents of his conversations with the emperor. When his sons and brothers asked about the conversations, he would respond:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. Later, Dou began to draw Emperor Dezong's displeasure due to his arrogance and partisanship. In 792, Dou asked Dong to recommend his nephew Dou Shen (竇申) to be the deputy minister of civil service affairs. Emperor Dezong, when hearing this recommendation, sternly asked Dong, \\"Is it not Dou Can who asked you, Lord, to make this recommendation?\\" Dong did not dare to hide Dou's request from Emperor Dezong, and when Emperor Dezong subsequently asked further about Dou's faults, he reported them to Emperor Dezong. Soon, Dou was exiled, and Dong, in fear, requested to resign. In 793, Dong was removed from his chancellor position and made the minister of rites (禮部尚書, Lǐbu Shangshu). He was soon made the official in charge of the eastern capital Luoyang as well as the commander of the militias of the region.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. In 796, Li Wanrong (李萬榮) the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) died. His son Li Nai (李迺) started a disturbance and tried to take over the circuit, but the eunuch monitor of the army, Ju Wenzhen (俱文珍) and the officer Deng Weigong (鄧惟恭) joined forces and arrested Li Nai. Emperor Dezong then named Dong the new military governor. Deng, believing that he should be allowed to take over the circuit, refused to send messengers to welcome Dong. As Dong travelled from Luoyang toward Xuanwu's capital Bian Prefecture, he went through Zheng Prefecture (鄭州, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan). The people at Zheng Prefecture feared for Dong's safety and tried to persuade him to slow down and not proceed to Bian Prefecture. Dong refused, and continued to proceed, arriving at Bian Prefecture quickly. Deng, surprised by Dong's arrival and not knowing how to react, was forced to welcome Dong. Dong therefore took his position as military governor and entrusted much of the responsibilities of governing the army to Deng. At that time, the military governors of Xuanwu were accustomed to have a large corps of guards, and Dong dismissed them as he believed them to be unnecessary.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. Meanwhile, Emperor Dezong, believing Dong to be too meek in his personality, sent Lu Changyuan (陸長源) to assist him as the commander of the army. It was said that Lu was harsh and wanted to impose rules of stricter discipline. Initially, Dong agreed, but after Lu drafted the rules, he set them aside, and the army was thus comforted. Despite this, though, Deng was fearful, and he gathered a group of some 200 soldiers, planning an uprising. The plot was discovered in winter 796, and Dong arrested Deng and delivered him to Chang'an. Emperor Dezong spared Deng's life but exiled him. Dong died in spring 799. He was given posthumous honors and given the posthumous name of Gonghui (恭惠, meaning, \\"respectful and benevolent\\"). ==NotesReferences== * Old Book of Tang, vol. 145. * New Book of Tang, vol. 151. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 224, 229, 233, 234, 235.

However, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the government. In 1993, after serving fourteen years in prison, Solomon was pardoned and released from prison. The next year, Solomon was arrested for murder again. At his 1994 trial, he was again sentenced to death by hanging. Solomon was executed on 17 October 1995, with another prisoner acting as the hangman. It was the first execution in Saint Lucia since 1986.

With little money to procure magic props from professional outlets, Gwynne began designing and building his own tricks and illusions. He married Anne Apel (1896-1979) in 1915 and had two children; Margaret (Peggy) Gwynne (1916-1973) and Virden “Buddy” Gwynne (1917-1978). During the 1910s and early 1920s, Gwynne was employed by the Edgar Thompson Steel Mill (Carnegie Steel) in Pittsburgh during the day and performed and built magic at night. In 1925, after seeing a performance by Gwynne at Kaufman's Department Store in Pittsburgh, legendary magician Harry Houdini hired Jack to build several props for the Houdini show. These included an original “Disappearing Chicken” trick that was featured by Houdini until his death in October, 1926. Gwynne also built props for the Howard Thurston show and other contemporary performers. Later creations included the \\"Flip Over Dove Vanish\\" box and \\"Flying Carpet\\" levitation effect. ==Vaudeville== Following an appearance at the 1927 International Brotherhood of Magicians convention in Kenton, Ohio, Gwynne took his act to New York in attempt to find work in vaudeville. After a show for booking agents at the Franklin Theater, Gwynne was offered a contract with RKO (Radio- Keith-Orpheum), the largest chain of vaudeville theaters in the U.S., for 50 weeks, beginning in September, 1927. From that point, Gwynne's career took off with performances from coast to coast for the next eight years. In New York he was featured at the Palace Theater (considered the top vaudeville theater in the nation), along with The Roxy, Loew's State, and Radio City Music Hall. Gwynne's act was known for its speed, precision timing and baffling, original magic. Trademark routines included the appearance of a tall stack of seven glass goldfish bowls (filled with water and live goldfish), the Disappearing Chicken and his original Temple of Benares (sword box) illusion. Utilizing his wife, son, daughter and nephew, Roger Apel, in the act, the Gwynnes became known as “The Royal Family of Magic.” ==Floor Shows== As American vaudeville declined in the mid-1930s, Gwynne adapted his stage act to perform in the then-new venue of floor shows. Floorshows were small entertainment revues, featuring several live acts, that performed on the dance floors of night clubs and hotels during the flourishing post-Prohibition, big band era. Gwynne was the first illusionist to adapt to this new medium. It was unusual because many thought that magicians needed a stage and curtains to hide the workings of their tricks. Gwynne could perform his act with the audience entirely surrounding him, which heightened the mystery. As he had in vaudeville, Gwynne became one of the most popular performers in nightclubs during their heyday before World War II. ==Motion Pictures== While performing in nightclubs in California in 1940, Gwynne and his family settled in Hollywood. Gwynne was cast in several motion pictures by Universal Studios, including, Dark Streets of Cairo (1940); Bagdad Daddy (Knight In A Harem) (1941); Model Wife (1941); Three Hits and a Miss (1941); and Hello, Sucker (1941). A friend of director and magician, Orson Welles, Gwynne is also credited with a brief appearance (as the “man on the roof”) in Welles’ epic, Citizen Kane (RKO, 1941). In several of his film appearances, Gwynne performed some of his original magic routines. ==USO== With America's entry into World War II, Gwynne joined the United Service Organization (USO). In 1943, as part of USO unit #289, Gwynne made a tour of stateside army bases and hospitals, entertaining the troops. In 1944, Jack and Anne Gwynne embarked on a year-long tour for the USO, through remote parts of North Africa, Italy, Iran, India, Burma and China, presenting hundreds of shows for soldiers on the front lines of combat. Upon their return to the United States in July 1945, the Gwynnes had logged some 30,000 miles of travel for the USO. Their son, Buddy was a decorated glider pilot during the war in Europe and also performed a private magic show for U.S. Army General, Mark Wayne Clark and his staff. ==Postwar Years and Television== Following the war, the Gwynne family settled in the Chicago suburb of Oak Lawn, Illinois. With the help of his son, Buddy and son-in–law, Frank Cole II (also a magician), Gwynne built a large magic show that toured theaters and civic auditoriums throughout the United States from 1946 to 1960. As television burst upon the scene, Gwynne was the first illusionist to be featured in a series, with 28 appearances (between 1952-1955) on the ABC network show, Super Circus. Gwynne was also featured in print and broadcast advertising for Zenith television. ==Final years== Gwynne continued to find work with his magic during an era when many other magicians were struggling to make ends meet. In the early 1960s he was featured in several Shrine Circus productions around the United States. Making his entrance atop an elephant, he performed his magic in the center ring, surrounded by the audience. He appeared in the inspirational film, Parable that was featured at the Protestant Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. That same year, Gwynne headlined the annual production of “It’s Magic” at the Wilshire Ebell Theater in Los Angeles. By the late 1960s, Gwynne had been performing for over 50 years. Realizing there was a new generation who had not been exposed to live entertainment, he developed an educational magic program that was featured in Chicago schools. Despite the fact that Gwynne was now into his seventies and suffering from cancer, his phenomenal dexterity remained with him until the end of his life. In addition, he continually embraced children and adolescents fascinated by magic. Frequently he could be seen backstage talking magic with young boys and girls expressing personal interests to become magicians. ==Death== Jack Gwynne died of a heart attack at age 74 on Sunday, December 7, 1969 at his home in Oak Lawn, Illinois. The previous Friday he had performed four magic shows at Chicago area schools. His wife, Anne, survived him by 10 years, making annual appearances at the Abbott's Magic Get-Together in Colon, Michigan, where she presented the “Jack Gwynne Excellence In Magic Award” each year to the outstanding magician at the gathering. The award is still presented by surviving members of the Gwynne family. ==Sources== * Charvet, David. Jack Gwynne: The Man, His Mind and his Royal Family of Magic. 1986.

Aside from Ulrich, the original lineup for some of the 1982 concerts included James Hetfield (rhythm guitar and lead vocals), Dave Mustaine (lead guitar and backing vocals) and Ron McGovney (bass guitar). Cliff Burton replaced McGovney in 1982 and played with the band until his death in 1986. After his death, bassists Jason Newsted (1986–2001), and Robert Trujillo (since 2003) were recruited in the band. While the lead guitarist role was taken by Kirk Hammett (since 1983) after Dave Mustaine got fired from the band. During the first years Metallica played in small festivals and as supporting acts on tours for bands such as Venom. Since their first live gig at Radio City, Anaheim on March 14, 1982, Metallica has performed on all populated continents numbering live events every year (with the exception of 2001) in a total of over 1,600 shows. The majority of these were played in the United States, but numerous concerts were also played in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany, among other countries. The band also went on seven worldwide tours: Damage, Inc. Tour (1986–1987), Damaged Justice (1988–1989), Wherever We May Roam Tour (1991–1992), Nowhere Else to Roam (1993), Madly in Anger with the World Tour (2003–2004), Escape from the Studio '06, and World Magnetic Tour (2008–2010). During these tours, South Africa as well as several countries in Central and South America, Asia, and Oceania were visited. Metallica has played many shows at major rock festivals such as Woodstock '94, Ozzfest, Monsters of Rock, Lollapalooza, Download Festival, Reading Festival, and Days on the Green. They also held numerous concerts in stadiums, some of which featured crowds of over 100,000 people. One of the highest-attendance music concerts in history was held by AC/DC on September 28, 1991 at Tushino Airfield in Moscow, where unofficially 1.6 million people attended. Some of these performances were later released as videos for special box set or DVD releases. Some performances have been held in theaters, including two April 1999 shows alongside the San Francisco Symphony that were released as the album S&M.; Metallica's first official tour was Kill 'Em All for One, which started in 1983 to promote their debut album. Their longest so far have been the Wherever We May Roam and World Magnetic Tours, which lasted 14 months and 20 months, respectively, with each having over 170 concerts. The band is among the most lucrative live bands, selling out half of their first 187 concerts held during the 2000s, and gaining an attendance of over 3.5 million people and a gross of over US$227 million. ==1980s tours== {  style=\\"width:100%; text-align:center;\\" - ! style=\\"width:40px; background:darkGrey;\\" Year(s) ! style=\\"width:210px; background:darkGrey;\\" Title ! style=\\"width:290px; background:darkGrey;\\" Legs (locations) and dates ! style=\\"width:80px; background:darkGrey;\\" Number of shows Complete list of shows for 1982 , 1983 , 1984 , 1985 , 1986 , 1987 , 1988 , and 1989 are listed on the Metallica.com website.

Jeezy and Nas recorded the song on the day Barack Obama clinched the Democratic nomination for the Presidency. \\"My President\\" also is notable for the unified collaboration between the two artists, who had been having a feud since the 2006 release of Nas' album Hip Hop Is Dead, which contained statements to which Young Jeezy took offense. ==Music video== The music video was shot on Sunday, November 23, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia and features many supporters of Barack Obama holding placards with various names written on them including Mother Teresa, Sojourner Truth, Bamir Topi, Sali Berisha, Bernie Mac, Sebastian Edwards, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Bun B, Juelz Santana, William Shakespeare, The Game, Lil Boosie, Jam Master Jay, Trick Daddy, David Banner, Akon, Jermaine Dupri, Pimp C and Soulja Slim.

The placards are meant to evoke those held by delegations at national political conventions; however, Hart elected to also include neighborhoods like Queensbridge and countries like Haiti, Israel and Iraq. The Israel placards caused offense to many Palestinians, including DJ Khaled and Muslims because of the 2008-2009 Gaza War.

The Abhayavongsa family governed Phra Tabong Province, Thailand (modern Battambang Province, Cambodia) for six generations from the late 18th century, when Siam annexed the Khmer territories, until 1907, when the area was ceded to French Indochina effectively reuniting it with Cambodia. The title bestowed by the Thai King to the governor of Phra Tabong which was used by each successive governor was Chao Phraya Abhaibhubejr (). In later years, the Abhayavongsa family played important roles in the anti-French struggle for Cambodian independence and one descendant became Prime Minister of Thailand. During World War II, Thailand regained control of the western Khmer provinces through Japanese mediation. Khuang Abhayavongsa was elected Prime Minister of Thailand, an office which he held three separate times between August 1944 and April 1948. Through family business ties, Khuang maintained close ties with the western Cambodian provinces during his time in office and fought, to no avail, to keep them under Thai rule in the wake of the Japanese loss and resurgence of the French in Indochina. His brother Chaowalit Aphaiwong worked until 1946 in a \\"Special Commission\\" in Battambang and was considered the \\"Nominal Head of the Khmer Issarak movement\\" fighting French rule of Cambodia. The official head of the Khmer Issarak movement was Phiset Phanit (Pokhun), Khuang's brother-in-law.

The organization’s name is derived from the blue cards that were given to Jewish donors who raised funds for Jews who lost their jobs. It was re-established in the United States in 1939, to continue aiding refugees escaping from the Holocaust. Today, it is the only organization in the United States whose sole mission is to aid needy Holocaust survivors by providing cash assistance. ==Charitable work== The Blue Card is a charitable organization aiding Holocaust survivors since 1934. It is dedicated to the support of European Jewish survivors in this country, who still suffer from the aftereffects of Nazi persecution, are sick or emotionally unstable, have been unable to achieve economic independence, or have lost it through sickness or old age; in many cases the Holocaust has deprived them of a family. The Blue Card’s activities are not duplicated by any other Jewish welfare agency. During the year 2013, The Blue Card made grants amounting to nearly $1.9 million. This brings the grant total since the Blue Card’s inception to $25.5 million. === Programs === The Blue Card provides aid to over 2,400 annually. Programs The Blue Card provides to the survivors include: * The Holocaust Survivor Emergency Cash Assistance Program, which helps pay for essential goods and services such as food, homecare, medicine, and rent, and is funded by the Claims Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. * The Curt C. and Else Silberman Dental Program, which funds the survivors' dental care. * The Stipend Program, which sends monthly checks to survivors. * The Jewish Holiday Program, which provides survivors money during Jewish holidays ($200 for Passover and High Holidays, $100 for Hanukkah). * The Adolph and Lotte Rosenberg Summer Vacation Program, which provides a summer vacation to survivors in the New York area, including an itinerary, handicap-accessible accommodations, scheduled meals, and transportation. * The Jakob Mogilnik Telephone Emergency Response Program, which provides an emergency response system to survivors who cannot pay for installation, service, and maintenance. The system is programmed in English, German, Hungarian, Russian, and Yiddish. During an emergency, such as a fall, the survivor will press a button around their neck or wrist which activates an automated speakerphone. The operator answers in the native language or the caller, asks if an ambulance is necessary, and follows up on the emergency. * The Mazel Tov Birthday Program, which sends survivors a $100 check and a birthday card on their birthday. * The Vitamins Program, which provides survivors with liquid meals, minerals, multivitamins, and supplements. * The Sonia and Max Lonstein Bring a Smile Program, which provides additional support for terminally ill survivors. * The Siggi B. Wilzig Fighting Cancer Together Program, which offers assistance to survivors diagnosed with cancer, including emotional support, nutrition, medical co-pays, and transportation to appointments. * The Blue Card-Lissner Hospital Visitation Program, which offers hospital visits to survivors from volunteers. * The Rita Berkowitz Nutritional Guidance Program, which educates survivors on proper nutrition and provides nutritional supplements and monthly food stipends. ===Team Blue Card=== Since 2009, The Blue Card has been an Official Charity Partner of the New York City Marathon. Team BlueCard is The Blue Card's endurance team, which participates in endurance events such as the 2011 TD 5 Borough Bike Tour in New York City and the 2015 Panasonic Life Time Triathlon. It is composed of participants from countries such as Argentina, Austria, France, Israel, Italy, Mexico, and South Africa. Team BlueCard has raised over $1,000,000 since 2009. ===Events=== The Blue Card participates in many fundraising events annually, including: * The Panasonic Lifetime TRI NYC Triathlon, in which members of Team BlueCard participate in the Panasonic Lifetime TRI NYC Triathlon to raise money for the Blue Card. * The Miami Marathon & Half Marathon, in which members of Team BlueCard participate in the Miami Marathon & Half Marathon to raise money for the Blue Card. * The Jerusalem Marathon, in which members of Team BlueCard participate in the annual Jerusalem Marathon to raise money for the Blue Card. * The Five Boro Bike Tour, in which members of Team BlueCard participate in the TD Five Boro Bike Tour to raise money for the Blue Card. * Run for the Blue Card, in which members of Team BlueCard participate in the annual ING NYC Marathon to raise money for the Blue Card. * The 2014 Young Russian Jewish Artists Give Back Art Auction Benefit, which was an art auction to raise money for the Blue Card. * The Blue Card Annual Benefit Gala, which honors Jewish individuals with either the Max L. Heine Humanitarian Award or the Richard C. Holbrooke Award for Social Justice at a Gala fundraising dinner. * The 2013 SoulCycle Charity Ride, which raised money for Holocaust survivors battling cancer. * The Annual Blue Card Ping Pong Social, which includes a ping-pong tournament and a silent auction. ==Recognition== In 2013, Charity Navigator announced that the Blue Card earned its ninth consecutive four-star rating for its ability to deliver services in a cost-effective manner. Fewer than 10% of rated charities have received at least four consecutive four star evaluations, indicating that The Blue Card outperforms most charities in America in its efforts to operate in the most fiscally responsible way possible. The Blue Card is accredited by the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance. In order to meet accreditation standards, the Blue Card demonstrated its compliance with 20 stringent regulations regarding transparency standards and effectiveness reporting.

He is known for his role in the incorporation of Winter Park, Florida as a city, in support of Loring Chase's plans. ==Early life== Henderson was born near Lake City in Columbia County, Florida in 1862. His mother died when he was ten years old, leaving him to survive on whatever small wages he could earn himself. Despite this, Henderson read compulsively and taught himself. He remained in his home town for twenty years, before accepting a job working as a salesman for a company based in New York. Although initially successful in this job, designated the first \\"commercial tourist\\" in Florida and among the most effective salesmen in the company, he was asked to resign when it was realised that he was African- American, and left the company after just five months. The 24-year-old Henderson then made his way to Winter Park, Florida, where he would contribute significantly to the development of the young community. ==Contributions to Winter Park== Henderson was a staunch Republican, and in one speech he said that \\"all we ever received came from Republicans. Our citizenship, our Freedom, our free schools, and numerous good laws that have done great good for the Negro came from the Republican Party, and, gentleman, if that party never does any more special good for me, I shall die a Republican.\\" As such, Henderson was a strong supporter of Chicago banker Loring Chase and his partner, Oliver Chapman, and their plan to incorporate the new city of Winter Park. Henderson was very active in encouraging black townspeople to vote in favour of the plan, which was instrumental as the 64 black residents registered to vote outnumbered the 47 registered white voters. Due to Henderson’s encouragement, which included Henderson leading voters to the meeting from Hannibal Square, there were enough voters to pass the legislation, making Winter Park a city and Hannibal Square part of the district. In this respect Henderson is cited as having played an influential role in the incorporation of Winter Park as a city. Livingston commented that \\"if it were not for Henderson’s efforts, the incorporation of Winter Park would not have taken place on October 12, 1887, and Hannibal Square may not have originally been included within the city limits of Winter Park\\". Henderson also founded a newspaper for the city, the Winter Park Advocate, whose first issue was published on May 31, 1889. The newspaper was one of two black newspapers published in Florida at the time. He began as manager but went on to assume the position of collector, reporter and editor. The newspaper focused on the interests of local people, social gatherings, community politics and so on, and found readership among both the white and black communities. Articles written by Henderson included \\"Christmas in Hannibal Square\\", \\"A Gala in Hannibal Square\\", \\"Colored Free Masons\\", and \\"High school for Colored Youth\\". After two years, Henderson left the Winter Park Advocate and moved away from Winter Park to Orlando, where in 1906 he opened another newspaper, The Florida Recorder (Colored) Republican. Henderson died in 1915. ==References== * Florida Collection – Archives (Rollins College): Chase, \\"Winter Park Scrapbook\\" 1889-1906, Vol. 1 and 2-3, Lochmede, 1887, Vol. 1, 2, and 3, Livingston, Fairolyn, \\"A Window on Hannibal Square.\\" Research Paper. * Clark, James C. \\"Black History Highlights,\\" Orlando Sentinel, February 6, 1990, E4. * Robison, Jim. \\"Black history spotlight on…Gus Henderson,\\" Orlando Sentinel, February 23, 2001. * Shofner, Jerrell H.

The Southland Art Foundation Artist In Residence was established in 1996 by a joint partnership between Southland Art Foundation, Creative New Zealand, Southland Museum & Art Gallery and the Southern Institute of Technology. In 1999 the Southland Art Foundation Trustees–Shirley Palmer, Gwen Neave, Russell Beck and Wayne P, Marriott resolved to rename the Artist in Residence programme the William Hodges Fellowship. This was in recognition of the acquisition of William Hodges “Maori before a Waterfall”, 1773 by the Southland Museum & Art Gallery in 1998. Hodges was regarded as the first non-Maori artist in residence in Southland, having depicted the flora, fauna and people of the region during Cook’s second voyage to New Zealand. The inaugural William Hodges Fellowship was awarded to Jo Ogier, printmaker, from Dunedin in 2000.

His family moved to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area when he was eleven.Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership \\"Political Leaders 2007 Profile: Vivek Kundra\\" , University of Virginia Kundra attended college at the University of Maryland, College Park where he received a degree in Psychology. He earned a master's degree in Information Technology, from University of Maryland University College. Additionally, he is a graduate of the University of Virginia's Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership. == Career == Kundra is currently the Chief Operating Officer at Sprinklr, a provider of enterprise customer experience management software based in NYC. Previously, Kundra served as director of Infrastructure Technology for Arlington County, Virginia, starting September 11, 2001. Governor Tim Kaine appointed Kundra in January 2006 to the post of Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Technology for Virginia, the first dual cabinet role in the state's history. Mayor Adrian Fenty appointed him on March 27, 2007 to the cabinet post of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for the District of Columbia. Kundra worked on developing programs to spur open source and crowdsourced applications using publicly accessible Web services from the District of Columbia. Building on the work of Suzanne Peck, who preceded him as DC's CTO and created the D.C. Data Catalog, he used that data as the source material for an initiative called Apps for Democracy. The contest yielded 47 web, iPhone and Facebook applications from residents in 30 days. Mayor Fenty stated that the program cost the District \\"50 thousand dollars total and we estimate that we will save the district millions of dollars in program development costs\\". This cost-benefit was claimed by the D.C. government as savings in internal operational and contractual costs.http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/ Taking a page from KundraNational Journal (06-29-2009)\\"Bloomberg Unveils Gov't Apps Contest\\" this initiative was mirrored by New York City's mayor Michael Bloomberg in launching a \\"BigApps\\" contest housed at NYC BigApps as well as New York City's DataMine.New York Future Initiative (06-29-2009)\\"Bloomberg Announces 'Big Apps' Contest\\" The city of San Francisco launched a data portal similar DC's in 2009. Kundra won recognition for the project management system he implemented for the District government.http://www.mitcio.com/2008/ The system imagined projects as publicly traded companies, project schedules as quarterly reports, and user satisfaction as stock prices. Buying or selling a stock corresponded to adding resources to a project or taking them away. The goal of management was to optimize the project portfolio for return on investment. The system effectively replaced subjective judgments about projects with objective, data driven analytics. Kundra's efforts to use cloud-based web applications in the D.C. government have also been considered innovative.http://www.gcn.com/print/27_28/47565-1.html Following the D.C. example driven by Kundra, the city of Los Angeles is now taking steps to adopt the cloud computing model for its IT needs.news.cnet.com (08-20-2009)\\"Los Angeles gets its Google Apps groove\\" A D.C. spokeswoman said that the District of Columbia paid $479,560 for the Enterprise Google Apps license, which is $3.5 million less than what it had planned to spend on an alternative plan. Since its deployment in July 2008 Google Apps is available to 38,000 D.C. city employees, but only 1,000-2,000 are actively using Google Docs. Only 200 employees are actively using Gmail. In late 2010, hoping to spur use of Gmail, the city ran a pilot program, selecting about 300 users and having them use the Google product for three months. Google participated closely in the project, but Gmail ultimately didn't pass the \\"as good or better\\" test with the users, who preferred Exchange/Outlook. In July 2011, the General Services Administration (GSA) became the first federal agency to migrate its email services for 17,000 employees and contractors to the cloud-based Google Apps for Government, saving $15.2 million over 5 years. As of July 2011, government agencies in 42 states are leveraging cloud-based messaging and collaboration services. The first major cloud project during his tenure was GSA's migration of e-mail/Lotus Notes to the Gmail and Salesforce.com's platform. GSA awarded a contract for e-mail in December 2010 and a five-year contract to Salesforce in August 2011. A September 2012 Inspector General report found the savings and cost analysis not verifiable and recommended GSA update its cost analysis. GSA office of CIO was unable to provide documentation supporting its analysis regarding the initial projected savings for government staffing and contractor support. The audit found that the agency could neither verify those savings nor clearly determine if the cloud migration is meeting agency expectations despite initial claims that indicated 50%http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2010/12/02/unisys-google-apps- gsa.aspxs cost savings Kundra also moved the city's geographic information systems department to a middle school. === Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) === Before his appointment as CIO, Mr. Kundra served as technology adviser on President Barack Obama's transition team. Kundra was officially named by President Obama on March 5, 2009, to the post of Federal CIO. The Federal Chief Information Officer is responsible for directing the policy and strategic planning of federal information technology investments as well as for oversight of federal technology spending. Until Kundra, the position had previously been more limited within the Office of Management and Budget where a federal chief information officer role had been created by the E-Government Act of 2002. The Federal CIO establishes and oversees enterprise architecture to ensure system interoperability and information sharing and maintains information security and privacy across the federal government. According to President Obama, as Chief Information Officer, Kundra \\"will play a key role in making sure our government is running in the most secure, open, and efficient way possible\\". To further President Obama's overall technology agenda, Vivek Kundra, Jeffrey Zients, the Chief Performance Officer, and Aneesh Chopra, the Chief Technology Officer, will work closely together. Kundra and Chopra previously worked in Governor Tim Kaine's administration. Kundra made it a priority to focus on the following areas: * Cybersecurity * Ensuring openness and transparency * Innovation * Lowering the cost of government * Participatory democracy One of his first projects was the launch of Data.gov, a site for access to raw government data. Another project launched by Kundra in June 2009 was the Federal IT Dashboard, which gives an assessment (in terms of cost, schedule and CIO ranking) of many large government IT projects.http://www.govtech.com/gt/698705?topic=290182 Democratizing Data Kundra launched the Data.gov platform on May 21, 2009 with the goal of providing public access to raw datasets generated by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government to enable public participation and private sector innovation. Data.gov draws conceptual parallels from the DC Data Catalog launched by Kundra when he was CTO of Washington, D.C., where he published vast amounts of datasets for public use. Immediately after the Data.gov launch, the Apps for America contest by the Sunlight Foundation challenged the American people to develop innovative solutions using Data.gov. San Francisco, the City of New York, the State of California, the State of Utah, the State of Michigan, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have launched public access websites modeled after Data.gov. Internationally, over 46 countries have launched open data sites patterned after Data.Gov, some using the U.S. Data.gov software which was made open source and made available on GitHub. Additionally, states, cities and counties have launched sites, notablysome cities in Canada, and the UK are following suit. IT Dashboard President Barack Obama testing the IT Dashboard On June 30, 2009, at the Personal Democracy Forum in New York, Vivek Kundra, unveiled the IT Dashboard that tracks over $76 billion in Federal IT spending. The IT Dashboard is part of USASpending.gov to track all government spending. The IT Dashboard is designed to provide CIOs of individual government agencies, the public and agency leaders unprecedented visibility into the operations and performance of Federal IT investments (spending), and the ability to provide and receive direct feedback to those directly accountable. In January 2010, Kundra followed up the work on the IT Dashboard with TechStat accountability sessions. These sessions are designed to turn around, halt or terminate at- risk and failing IT projects in the federal government. It allows agency CIOs, CFOs, and other key stakeholders to find solutions for IT projects that are over budget, behind schedule, or under-performing. Cloud Computing Kundra launched the federal government strategy and the cloud computing portal Apps.gov at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field in California, on September 15, 2009.NASA Ames Research Center, (2009-09-15) \\"NASA Ames Hosts White House CIO\\", Retrieved (2010-01-17) Apps.gov is a new service provided by the GSAGSA \\"Apps.Gov\\", Retrieved (2010-01-17) where federal agencies can subscribe to IT services. Kundra saw the cloud as an alternative to hardware investments, as means to reduce IT costs, and to shift focus of federal IT from infrastructure management to strategic projects. This initiative aims to use commercially derived technologies to promote software tools, vast data storage and data sharing, and to foster collaboration across all federal agencies. Howard Schmidt, White House cybersecurity coordinator, will work closely with the Federal CIO and CTO with respect to cloud initiativesFederal News Radio (2010-02-11) \\"Cybersecurity coordinator Howard Schmidt discusses cloud\\", retrieved (2010-02-15) and has the responsibility of orchestrating all cybersecurity activities across the government.Phillips, Macon (2009-12-22) \\"Introducing the New Cybersecurity Coordinator\\", The White House, retrieved (2010-02-15) On December 9, 2010, Kundra published the \\"25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management\\", which included Cloud First as one of its top priorities for achieving IT efficiency. Cloud First required each agency to identify three cloud initiatives. He announced his decision to leave the federal government and join Harvard University within 7 months of this strategy, too short for any of cloud first initiatives to have demonstrated cost savings. After a short 5 months at Harvard he left to join Salesforce.com, a cloud SaaS and PaaS provider. Management Reforms Kundra published a 25-point implementation plan25-Point Implementation Plan to Reform, cio.gov to reform how the federal government manages information technology. The execution plan follows his decision to reevaluate some of the government's most troubled IT projects. Of 38 projects reviewed, four have been canceled, 11 have been rescoped, and 12 have cut the time for delivery of functionality down by more than half, from two to three years down to an average of 8 months, achieving a total of $3 billion in lifecycle budget reductions, according to whitehouse.gov This image illustrates the work done by US Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra to reform Federal IT management Suspension On March 13, 2009, Kundra was placed on indefinite leave following an FBI raid on his former D.C. office and the arrest of two individuals in relation to a bribery investigation.Eric Kangel, \\"Obama put new CIO Vivek kundra on suspension,\\" Business Insider March 13, 2009 link Kundra returned to duties after five days with no finding of wrongdoing on his part. ===Post-Obama administration career=== Kundra left his post as chief information officer in August 2011 to accept an academic fellowship at Harvard University, conducting research at both the Berkman Center for Internet & Society and the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.Office of Management and Budget (2011-06-16) \\"Our Nation’s First Federal CIO\\", The White House, retrieved (2011-06-18)Harvard University (2011).

In February, 2017 he joined Outcome Health as EVP of Provider Solutions, and then promoted to Chief Operating Officer in July. Vivek left Outcome in Nov 2017 soon after its major investors filed a lawsuit alleging improper practices against its founders for misleading advertisers and investors. On May 16, 2018Kundra joined the private start-up Sprinklr as Chief Operating Officer. == Professional recognition == In May 2011, Kundra was selected by EMC Corporation for their Data Hero Visionary Award for his pioneering work under the Obama Administration to reform how the Federal government manages and uses information technology.PR Newswire, \\"United States CIO Vivek Kundra Receives 2011 Data Hero Visionary Award\\" EMC states that, \\"Kundra has led the nation to seek innovative solutions to lower the cost of government operations, while exploring ways to fundamentally change the way the public sector and the public interact\\". In March 2011, Kundra was selected by the World Economic Forum as a Young Global Leader for his professional accomplishments, commitment to society and potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world.Zopf, Yann (2011-03-11),\\"World Economic Forum Announces Young Global Leaders 2011 (North America)\\", World Economic Forum Kundra was awarded the 2010 National Cyber Security Leadership AwardSANS Institute, (2010-11-16), \\"2010 National Cyber Security Leadership Award Winners\\" by the SANS Institute for uncovering more than $300 million each year in wasted federal spending on ineffective certification and accreditation reporting and demonstrating an alternative approach called \\"continuous monitoring\\" that provides more effective security for federal systems at lower costs. Kundra was named Chief of the Year on December 21, 2009, by InformationWeek for driving unprecedented change in federal IT. Kundra was named by InfoWorld among the top 25 CTO's in the country. He was also selected as a 2008 MIT Sloan CIO Symposium Award Finalist on 'Balancing Innovation and Cost Leadership'. Both organizations cited the \\"stock market\\" approach to IT portfolio management that Kundra implemented for the District of Columbia. The system measured project performance and allocated IT investments similar to the way the public companies trade on the stock market.

The complex expanded to six screens in 1976, enabling it to accommodate extended runs of the popular blockbusters of the era while still having screens for new releases. It expanded further to twelve screens in 1984, and to twenty in 1988. Loeks ultimately desired to expand to a total of twenty-eight screens. The complex broke a single day attendance record on November 29, 1990, serving 16,000 guests, a record which still remains unbroken. (Home Alone and Dances with Wolves were in their opening weeks at the time.) After Loeks opened several other cinemas in the area, including Celebration Cinema! North and Celebration Cinema! South, and the Cinemark chain built new cineplexes at nearby Rivertown Crossings and Woodland Malls (later purchased by Loeks), Studio 28 saw a sharp decline in attendance, leading to its eventual closure in November 2008. In March 2014, the building was demolished. ==References== Category:Cinemas and movie theaters in Michigan Category:Former cinemas in the United States Category:Theatres completed in 1965 ","title":"Studio 28"},{"id":"20369024","text":"Spelljammer was a comic book produced by DC Comics under license from TSR. ==Publication history== During the 1980s and 1990s, DC Comics published several licensed D&D; comics, including Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, and Spelljammer. Spelljammer launched one month after the annual anthology, TSR Worlds #1, is launched in July 1990. Barbara Kesel wrote the Spelljammer comic from 1990-1991. Fifteen comics set in the Spelljammer universe were published by DC Comics between September 1990 and November 1991 with the creative team of Kesel, Michael Collins and Dan Panosian. Joe Quesada illustrated issues #8–13, 15 (1991), and Don Heck's final DC work was penciling and inking over Quesada's layouts for Spelljammer #11 (July 1991); Dave Simons also provided artwork for the title. Elliot S! Maggin served as an editor for DC from 1989 to 1991 and oversaw the licensed TSR titles, including Spelljammer. ==Characters== Spelljammer comics use Jasmine, a winged human character originally introduced from Forgotten Realms comics, as one of the lead characters. In the TSR Worlds Annual #1 (chapter 4), the crew of the Realms Master (from the Forgotten Realms comic series) arrive at the lich's frozen castle only to be attacked by a deceived Meridith, Tember, and Pax (from the Spelljammer comic). After both parties realize they are on the same side, Dwalimor tricks the lich into bringing down his castle upon himself and Ishi wins the duel of hearts when Priam chooses to save her over Jasmine. Jasmine leaves the Realms Master to join the crew of the space faring Spelljammer. ==References== Category:DC Comics titles Category:Dungeons & Dragons comics Category:Spelljammer ","title":"Spelljammer (comics)"},{"id":"20369029","text":"Sonora State Highway 37 (Carretera Estatal 37) is a highway in the Mexican state of Sonora.

He was the first of four children. He served in the United States Navy, earning the rank of Aviation Structural Mechanic Third Class. He served in the Korean and China Sea areas and was discharged after the Korean War. ==Education== Canfield graduated from the University of Illinois in 1959 with a bachelor's degree in metallurgical engineering. He was second in his class of engineers. He earned an MBA from the University of Texas at Tyler in 1987. ==Career== After graduating from the University of Illinois, Canfield worked for Allegheny Ludlum Steel Co. in Brackenridge, Pennsylvania. The first computers were just being built. He did some work on the supercomputer ILLIAC, programming it with wires since chips had not been invented. In December 1960, Canfield was let go by Allegheny Ludlum when the steel industry went into a funk and went to work for Westinghouse Electric building nuclear reactors for submarines and the first aircraft carrier, and for electrical power plants. His job was to make the fuel. His team designed a backyard reactor that could have supplied 10 homes for 20 years with very cheap power but access to needed uranium was unavailable. In December 1963, Canfield went to work at Latrobe Steel as a metallurgist in heat treating and melting of tool steels. In January 1970, Canfield went to work at Crucible Specialty Metals in Syracuse, New York making powdered high speed steels, something very new at that time and the forerunner to many alloys that are made now for intricate parts with a long life. Canfield spent the last 32 years of his life in Longview, Texas, working for Lone Star Steel and developing several businesses and products, in addition to his work with the Republican Party of Gregg County. In 1986, Canfield formed The Plum Group, publishing monthly reports on the metal industry to steel suppliers. He also formed Thermo-Tech Co., a manufacturer of de-oxidation products for the steel industry. His works included pioneering work in powder metallurgy, fusion bonding of nuclear materials for reactors in Naval and Power Generation, early work in powdered nuclear materials now used in modern reactors, development of high energy compaction of high alloy powders, seamless extrusions, and the removal of oxygen from liquid steels. He held two patents on de-oxidation products and methods. ==Politics== Having maintained an interest in political and economic issues since college, Mr. Canfield was active in the Republican Party of Gregg County and served as party chairperson from 1991–2002. During his term, Republicans captured all but two of the county-wide offices. He also published a monthly newsletter, raised funds for the party, recruited winning candidates, mobilized volunteer efforts, assisted every Republican in winning general elections, and maintained an open office for the use of all auxiliaries. Canfield also served on the State Republican Executive Committee representing Senate District One, having been elected by the state convention in 1998 and being unopposed at the 2000 state convention. In 2002, Canfield received the Seed Grower Award, a prestigious honor awarded to him for tremendous impact on the growth of the Republican presence in the state of Texas. ==Associations== Canfield was an active member or supporter of the following groups: Gregg County Republican Women, Republican National Committee, National Senatorial Committee, secretary and treasurer of the Republican Club of Gregg County, National Congressional Committee, Presidential Task Force and Team Bush Leader, Cato Institute, Leadership Institute, National Right To Life, National Right To Work, Texas Right To Life, Hillsdale College, Foundation for Economic Education, president and newsletter editor of East Texas Right To Life, Madison Project, Heritage Foundation, and lifetime member of VFW Post 4002. In his younger days, Canfield was a pitcher for a short while in the minor leagues and worked on a pit crew for Indy car racing. ==Quotes== Memorable quotes by Glenn Canfield Jr. On his granddaughter's graduation day: \\"Congratulations.

He also played nine first-class cricket matches. He was educated at Downside School, Somerset and St Benet's Hall, Oxford. ==Cricket== Halliday's first-class cricket appearances were with Oxford University from 1980 to 1982 and In all he made 348 first-class runs at 29.00 but only passed 50 once in his 14 innings. This was when he scored 113 not out against Kent in 1982, with a bowling lineup consisting of English Test cricketers Graham Dilley and Bob Woolmer. He also played cricket for Dorset from 1981 to 1987, including 38 Minor Counties Championship matches and 3 one- day matches in the National Westminster Bank Trophy.Simon Halliday, Cricket Archive ==Rugby Union== Halliday also played rugby union for Oxford University from 1979 to 1981, including 3 Varsity matches. He went on to play for Bath Rugby Club. His sporting career was interrupted by a serious leg injury when playing for Somerset against Middlesex in the Rugby Union County Championship in 1983. He recovered to work his way into the England national team and made his debut in the 1986 Five Nations. He soon formed what seemed initially to be a stable and lasting centre partnership with Will Carling, only to be dropped to the bench during 1989-90 thanks to the emergence of Jeremy Guscott as Carling's centre partner (since Carling, as captain, was guaranteed his own place in the side). England's selectors nevertheless attempted to fit Halliday into the side by playing him on the wing with Carling and Guscott at centre, but in the 1990 Five Nations campaign this move met with only mixed success in two matches - the victory over Wales followed by a defeat in the Grand Slam decider, against Scotland. He did not play in the 1991 Five Nations, but was however a part of England's 1991 Rugby World Cup campaign, initially in the squad as a utility-back squad member, playing a group match against USA: then playing in the Semi Final win over Scotland, and the Final which they lost to Australia. In these two matches he was once again played on the right wing, selected ahead of the actual specialist winger Nigel Heslop: the latter believed to be still somewhat fragile after taking a pounding in the brutal quarter-final against France, and the other winger in the squad (Chris Oti) being injury-prone. The move was regarded as enough of a success for Halliday to be retained on the wing as first choice for the next year, in the England side which won the 1992 Five Nations Championship with a Grand Slam. He played in 23 internationals from 1986 to 1992, retiring after the 1992 grand slam: his two international tries came in the 1988 autumn victory over Australia (partnering Carling at centre, in the latter's first match as captain) and the 1992 Five Nations victory over Ireland (playing on the wing). From 1981 to 1990, Halliday made a total of 170 appearances for Bath, including five successful Cup Finals. In 1990 he moved to Harlequins before retiring in 1992 because of long-term injuries. ==Author== Halliday published the book City Centre in 2013, a book about rugby.

The Torrens Island Internment Camp was a World War I concentration camp,http://www.thegermanclub.com.au/about-us/german-history-in-SA.php located on Torrens Island in the Port River Estuary near Adelaide in South Australia. The camp opened on 9 October 1914 and held up to 400 men of German or Austro- Hungarian background, or crew members of enemy ships who had been caught in Australian ports at the beginning of the war. They were held without trial under the provisions of the War Precautions Act 1914. The South Australian population included a large minority of German descent, and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 brought a wave of anti-German feeling. At official level, the War Precautions Act permitted sweeping powers of search, seizure of property and arrest. Lutheran churches and schools were closed and German language newspapers were banned. In August 1914, soldiers were sent out under the authority of the Act to round up about 300 of what were called \\"Germans\\". The internees included some German and Austro-Hungarian citizens and some Australian born, a mixture of farmers, intellectuals, and Lutheran pastors. They were only a small fraction of the people of German descent in South Australia, and with them the army had rounded up some citizens of Sweden, the Netherlands, and one from the USA all neutral countries. At first the prisoners were interned in a barbed wire compound at Keswick Barracks within the Adelaide suburbs. As the numbers grew, in October they were taken by boat to Torrens Island. The island was nearly deserted except for a Quarantine Station, built in the nineteenth century. A fenced compound was built on the bank of the Port River about 500m south of the Quarantine Station, which had the only jetty on the island. The prisoners were interned there in tents under armed guard. At the time, it was officially called a Concentration Camp. In its first few months, the Torrens Island internment camp was uncomfortable, but not harsh. The internees were housed in tents and made to cater for their own cooking requirements, including growing their own food. Despite these hardships, the inmates managed to organise cultural events and entertainment, and even published a number of editions of a camp newspaper, Der Kamerad. Internee was a professional photographer who was permitted to have a camera in the camp, and his photographs provide a record of conditions. In early 1915, a new commanding officer, Captain G.E. Hawkes, was posted to the camp and, in about March 1915, the camp was shifted to another location further south away from the Quarantine Station, on the southern end of Torrens Island. The reason for the move was not given, but was presumably because its close proximity would compromise the Quarantine Station in the event of a quarantine emergency. The evidence of a later Court of Enquiry says, \\"The Camp about this time was removed from the site which this Court has already described, to the southern end of the island, near an old quarantine station which had been unused for many years.\\"National Archives of Australia Series MP367/1 Item 567/3/2202 Captain G.E. Hawkes Court of Enquiry 1915–1919 The two sites of the Torrens Island Internment Camp. Captain Hawkes was to prove extremely unsuitable for the position, and under his command treatment of the internees deteriorated. He encouraged an atmosphere in which guards became routinely offensive and violent in their behaviour, and soon afterward stories of brutal treatment began to be circulated. Subsequent enquiries found evidence of prisoners being punished for disciplinary offences by exposing them to the weather in an open barbed wire compound, prisoners habitually being prodded with bayonets, and illegal punishments in which internees were stripped, handcuffed and publicly flogged. One of these incidents involved a Swedish and an American citizen. There were also rumours of worse brutalities, and prisoners being shot dead by guards, but the facts about Torrens Island are difficult to verify. On one occasion, Captain Hawkes had fired his pistol into a tent full of internees, wounding one. Flogging the American proved to be a serious mistake. The prisoner wrote to the US Consul about conditions in the camp, forcing an enquiry in June which brought conditions into the open. The camp was quietly closed in August 1915, many of the internees were released, and others were transferred to a more humanely-run camp at Holsworthy in New South Wales. Captain Hawkes was dismissed from the service, and in 1916 a Court of Enquiry was held into his conduct. None of this became public knowledge in Australia until after the war, when in 1919 the Adelaide press published the story.Torrens Island Revelations, The Mail, 17 May 1919. Trove, National Library of Australia. Retrieved 6 January 2012. However, word of the incident had reached Germany, and returning Australian prisoners of war told of being threatened with reprisals, though none took place.Chronicle, 30 November 1918. The official records of the Torrens Island camp were destroyed, and today virtually all that is known about the incident comes from the only wartime records that survive, principally the typescript and evidence from the Court of Enquiry.National Archives of Australia Series MP367/1 Item 567/3/2202 Captain G.E.

The site of the first camp was on the western side of the island on the bank of the Port River, a few hundred metres south of the Quarantine Station, much of which still stands. The internment site was a tented encampment occupied for only five months, October 1914 to March 1915, and was then systematically removed. Nothing can be identified on the site today. The site of the second camp was at the southern end of the island on the bank of Angas Inlet, and occupied from March to August 1915. It too was systematically removed, and anything that remained was later completely obliterated by modern construction. The site is under or close to the switchyard of Section B of the Torrens Island Power Station, built in 1973. ==Exhibition== An exhibition, Interned: Torrens Island, 1914–1915 was held at the South Australian Migration Museum from October 2014 to September 2015Interned: Torrens Island, 1914–1915 Migration Museum.

Formed in February 1977, the group originally included vocalist and keyboardist Glenn Danzig, bassist Jerry Only and drummer Manny Martínez, with guitarist Franché Coma added in the fall of that year. The band went through a number of personnel changes, including adding Only's brother Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein on guitar in 1980, before breaking up in 1983. Only and Doyle reformed the Misfits in 1995 with new vocalist Michale Graves and drummer Dr. Chud. Danzig and Doyle rejoined the band in 2016, alongside drummer Dave Lombardo. ==History1977–1983=== Misfits were formed in February 1977 by Glenn Danzig (real name Glenn Anzalone), bassist Jerry Only (real name Gerald Caiafa) and drummer Manny Martínez. After performing as a three-piece for a number of months, which spawned their first single \\"Cough/Cool\\", the band added guitarist Franché Coma (real name Frank Licata) in October. By the end of the year they had also replaced Martínez with \\"Mr.\\" Jim Catania, a former bandmate of Danzig's, due to the original drummer's decision to leave the band. Misfits recorded its debut album Static Age in the first two months of 1978, but it remained unreleased until 1996. \\"Bullet\\" was issued in June 1978. Coma left midway through a North American tour in October 1978, followed by Catania later in the month. They were replaced in November by Bobby Steele (real name Bobby Kaufhold) and Joey Image (real name Joey Poole), respectively. Coma was initially replaced by Rick Riley for two shows before Steele joined. After the release of two singles – \\"Horror Business\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" – Image left Misfits in December 1979 following conflicts with Danzig and Only. The group went on a short hiatus, before adding drummer Arthur Googy (real name Arthur McGuckin) in April 1980. Later in the year, Steele was replaced by Only's 16-year-old brother Paul Caiafa (originally a roadie for the band), who adopted the moniker Doyle. This lineup recorded the band's first album to be released, Walk Among Us, which was issued in March 1982. Googy left shortly after its release following an argument with Danzig. Returning with former Black Flag drummer Robo (real name Roberto Valverde), Misfits recorded its second album Earth AD/Wolfs Blood throughout late 1982 and early 1983. Robo left in August 1983, with Brian Damage (real name Brian Keats) brought in for scheduled tour dates later in the year. However, Danzig disbanded the group after a final show on October 29 which Rolling Stone writer Kory Grow described as \\"shambolic\\", during which former touring drummer Todd Swalla was forced to substitute for the drunken Damage. Earth AD/Wolfs Blood was released in December 1983, followed by single \\"Die, Die My Darling\\" in May 1984. Following the breakup of the Misfits, Danzig formed Samhain and later Danzig, while the Caiafa brothers formed Kryst the Conqueror. ===1995 onwards=== After a legal case regarding ownership of the band's name, Only \\"secured the exclusive legal right to tour and record as the Misfits\\" in 1995 and reformed the band with Doyle. The pair initially invited Danzig to rejoin, who declined. During auditions for new bandmates, Only and Doyle recorded several demos with vocalist Eric Weiss and drummer Joel Gausten, although they were not official members of the band. Later in the year, vocalist Michale Graves (real name Michael Emanuel) and drummer Dr. Chud (real name David Calabrese) joined the group, with their first shows coming in October. The new lineup released several recordings together, including American Psycho and Famous Monsters. Graves briefly departed in 1998, during which time Myke Hideous filled in on several tour dates. Graves and Chud left midway through a show on October 25, 2000. Several guest musicians replaced them at later dates, including former member Joey Image, vocalist Zoli Téglás and drummer Ken \\"Renfield\\" Schalk. In early 2001, the group toured with a range of guests, including Eric Arce, former members Robo and Graves, former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena, and former Ramones drummer Marky Ramone. Both Cadena and Marky later became official members, before Doyle left the band in May 2001. Robo returned to replace Ramone in May 2005, remaining until November 2010 when he was replaced by Arce. In 2014, the band expanded to a four-piece with the addition of Only's son Jerry Caiafa II on guitar, although the following June it was announced that Cadena had to cease performing due to undergoing cancer treatment.

He is an advocate for production of ethanol fuel, especially at local, small and medium scales. ==Major work== Blume is the author of Alcohol Can Be A Gas!, a review of the history of alcohol used as a fuel, together with an extensive investigation of how to produce alcohol fuel from different crops, using a variety of tools and techniques, and with an explanation of relevant laws and industry practices. The focus of the book is on how to set up and run crops and facilities for local ethanol use, as opposed to large-scale industrial or commercial use. The book was originally written in 1983 for release with Alcohol as Fuel, a 10-episode how-to series on PBS produced by KQED in San Francisco. Copies of the original book and TV series, which was only aired on KQED, have since been nearly impossible to obtain. The book was rewritten and expanded to 640 pages over several years and re-released with the same title on November 1, 2007. Blume's primary insight follows from that of Buckminster Fuller, who wrote the foreword to the book in 1983: that alcohol (or ethanol) is a renewable variety of solar energy in liquid form, the cultivation of which can enhance soils, be used as a minimally- or non-polluting fuel, and enable farmers and individuals at large to make fuel locally. == Other projects == At one time or another Blume has been involved in the following projects. * Employed by NASA (1978), at an experimental solar self-sufficient energy, sewage treatment, desalinization plant in the Virgin Islands. * Employed by Mother Earth News Eco Village in North Carolina, part of team practicing alternative building techniques. * Founder, American Homegrown Fuel Co., an educational organization teaching farmers and others how to produce and use alcohol fuel. * Founder, Planetary Movers Inc (1984). * Board member, field worker, Ecosites International. * Board member, field worker, Vivamos Mejor (1990). * Board member, Committee for Sustainable Agriculture (aka Ecological Farming Association). * Executive director, Hidden Villa Farm and Wilderness Preserve. * Founder (1993), executive director, International Institute for Ecological Agriculture, Santa Cruz, CA. * Founder, Our Farm, a CSA formerly in Woodside, CA. == See also == * Alcohol fuel * Ethanol fuel * Food vs fuel == Bibliography == * Alcohol Can Be a Gas!: Fueling an Ethanol Revolution for the 21st Century (with editor Michael Winks; International Institute for Ecological Agriculture; November 1, 2007) * Alcohol Can Be A Gas!

She is considered as a disciple of another Varkari poet- saint Tukaram. Having been born in a brahmin family, Bahinabai was married to a widower at a young age and spent most of her childhood wandering around Maharashtra along with her family. She describes, in her autobiography Atmamanivedana, her spiritual experiences with a calf and visions of the Varkari's patron deity Vithoba and Tukaram. She reports being subjected to verbal and physical abuse by her husband, who despised her spiritual inclination but who finally accepted her chosen path of devotion (bhakti). Unlike most female-saints who never married or renounced their married life for God, Bahinabai remained married her entire life. Bahinabai's abhanga compositions, written in Marathi, focus on her troubled marital life and the regret being born a woman. Bahinabai was always torn between her duties to her husband and her devotion to Vithoba. Her poetry mirrors her compromise between her devotion to her husband and God. ==Early life== Bahinabai has written an autobiographical work called Atmamanivedana or Bahinibai Gatha, where she describes not only her current birth but also twelve previous births.Tharu p. 108For account of her previous lives, see Feldhaus pp. 598–9For complete English translation of Bahinabai's abhangas see Bahinabai: A Translation of Her autobiography and Verses by Justin E. Abbot (Poona, Scottish Mission, 1929). Some verses are given in Tharu pp. 109–115 The first 78 verses of the total 473 trace her current life..... As per the account, she was born in Deogaon(Rangari) or Devgaon(R) near Ellora or Verul in northern Maharashtra, where she spent her childhood. Her parents, Aaudev Kulkarni and Janaki were brahmins, the Hindu priest class, and considered their first child Bahinabai as a harbinger of good fortune. Bahinabai started reciting the names of God from an early age, while playing with her mates.Anandkar p. 64 Bahinabai was married at the age of three with a thirty-year-old widower called Gangadhar Pathak, who she describes as a scholar and \\"an excellent jewel of a man\\", but stayed with parents until she reached puberty as per the custom. When Bahinabai was about nine years old, she with her parents and husband, had to leave Devghar due to a family dispute. They wandered with pilgrims along the banks of river Godavari and begged for grain, as customarily wandering holy men do. They visited Pandharpur, the city which hosts the chief temple of Vithoba, in this period. By the age of eleven, she with her family finally settled in Kolhapur. She was \\"subjected to the demands of married life\\" at this age, but she was not into it.Aklujkar p. 121 ==Later life== Bahinabai reported visions of the Varkari's patron deity Vithoba, pictured In Kolhapur, Bahinabai was exposed to Hari-Kirtana songs and tales from the scripture Bhagavata Purana. Here, Bahinabai's husband was gifted a cow, who soon gave birth to a calf. Bahinabai reports a spiritual encounter with the calf. The calf, in Varkari literature, symbolises a person who has attained the highest state of yogic concentration in the previous birth, but due to some fault, is forced to take birth as a calf. The calf followed Bahinabai wherever she went. Bahinabai with the calf also attended the Kirtana of the famed swami Jayaram. Jayaram patted heads of the calf and Bahinabai. When Bahinabai's husband heard of the incident, he dragged Bahinabai by her hair, beat and tied her up in the house. Following this, the calf and the cow gave up food and water leading to the former's death. At its burial, Bahinabai fainted and lay unconscious for days. She awoke with her first vision of the Varkari's patron deity Vithoba and later of her contemporary poet-saint Tukaram. Following the incident, she had another vision of the duo that revived her from the sorrow of the calf's death.Feldhaus pp. 595–6 In these visions, Tukaram fed her nectar and taught her the mantra \\"Rama-Krishna-Hari\\". Thereafter, Bahinabai pronounced Tukaram as her guru.Anandkar pp. 66–7 In her visions, Tukaram initiated her into the path of bhakti (devotion) and instructed her to recite the name of Vithoba. Some people considered her behaviour as a sign of madness, while others considered it a mark of sainthood.Anandkar p. 67 Bahinabai's husband dissuaded her by saying that she being of a Brahmin, should not listen to the lower caste Shudra Tukaram. However, Bahinabai did not find happiness in the life of a dutiful wife and turns to bhakti, at the same time serving her husband. As her fame spread, her husband is portrayed to have been jealous of the attention Bahinabai received. Her hot-tempered husband is reported to have abused, beaten and confined Bahinabai to the cattle-shed. When all methods fail to deter her, he decided to leave Bahinabai, who was three months pregnant at the time.Feldhaus p. 596 However, he could not do so as he suffered a burning limbs sensation lasting a month, on the day of departure. Finally, he repented and was convinced of Bahinabai's faith and devotion to God.Aklujkar p. 122 At the same time, Bahinabai realised her neglect of her husband and decided \\"serving him was more important than devoting herself to (another) god.\\" Bahinabai writes:Feldhaus pp. 596–7 > I'll serve my husband – he's my god ... > My husband's my guru; my husband's my way this > is my heart's true resolve. > If my husband goes off, renouncing the world, > Pandurang (Vithoba), what good will it do me to live among men? ... > My husband's the soul; I'm the body ... > My husband's the water; I'm a fish in it. > How can I survive? ... > Why should the stone god Vitthal (Vithoba) > and the dream saint Tuka (Tukaram) > deprive me of the happiness I know? The family of Bahinabai went to Dehu, the home-town of Tukaram and paid their respects to him. Here, the brahmin Bahinabai's acceptance of the lower caste Sudra Tukaram as her guru, agitated local brahmins, which led to harassment of the family and threatening of ostracism. In Dehu, Bahinabai gave birth to a daughter, who she named Kasibai. But, she was distressed and mediated suicide. Tukaram in her vision, stopped her and blessed her with poetic powers and prophesied that she would have a son who was a companion in her previous birth, thus Bahinabai is believed to have started composition of poetry, the first of which were dedicated to Vithoba.Anandkar pp. 68–9 Consequently, she had a son, who she named Vithoba, the exact time of his birth is not provided, but he is mentioned in a later part of her autobiography. Finally the family moved to Shirur, where Bahinabai practised a vow of silence for a while. In 1649, on Tukaram's death, Bahinabai revisited Dehu and fasted for eighteen days where, according to the traditional account, she was blessed with a vision of Tukaram again. She then visited the saint Ramdas and stayed in his company until his death in 1681. Afterwards she returned to Shirur.Anandkar p. 70 In last sections of her autobiography, Bahinabai says she has \\"seen her death\\". She prophesied her death and wrote a letter to Vithoba, her son, who had gone to Shukeshwar to perform last rites of his wife. On her death-bed, Bahinabai told Vithoba (her son) that he had been her son throughout her twelve previous births and also in her current (thirteenth) birth, which she believed was her last. Further, she narrated the tale of her twelve previous births, which are recorded in her autobiography.Anandkar pp. 70–1 She died in 1700, at the age of 72. ==Literary works== Apart from her autobiography, Bahinabai composed abhangas, which deal with various subjects like praise of god Vithoba, Atman, Sad-guru, sainthood, Brahmanhood, and devotion. Bahinabai's abhanga compositions also focus on her troubled relationship with her husband, the conflict between husband and wife, and to certain extent its resolution. She even portrays her husband's hostile and harmful feelings with empathy.Tharu p. 109 Unlike many of the woman-saints of the period, Bahinabai remained married her entire life, dutifully serving her husband, balancing her roles pativrata (a devoted wife) and virata (the detached). Bahinabai does not revolt against social traditions and believed denouncement of the world is not the solution to a woman's suffering. Her poetry reflects her compromise between her devotion to her husband and her god Vithoba.Pandharipande pp. 169–170 Bahinabai also comments on the duties of a married woman. Some abhangas extol the merits of a pativrata, others advocate pure devotion to God which may lead to the ire of society. Others advocate the compromise. She also speaks of pravrtti (action) and nivrtti (quiescence), personified as wives of manas (the mind). Both of them argue over their own superiority, winning a particular moment in the debate and finally reconciling and together directing the mind to its ultimate goal. In her own life, Bahinabai sought to balance these two: pravrtti – the duties of a virtuous wife and nivrtti – renunciation of the world.Feldhaus p. 599 Bahinabai sometimes curses her fate of being born as a woman, which author Tharu interprets as \\"her scepticism, her rebelliousness and her insistent refusal to abandon her aspiration for the truth\\". She regrets her female birth as she was kept away from the knowledge of the holy scriptures like Vedas and sacred mantras, by the male-dominated brahmin society. Bahinabai sings in her abhanga:Tharu p. 107 > The Vedas cry aloud, the Puranas shout > \\"No good may come to woman.\\" > I was born with a woman's body > How am I to attain Truth? > \\"They are foolish, seductive and deceptive – > Any connection with a woman is disastrous.\\" > Bahina says, \\"If a woman's body is so harmful, > How in this world will I reach Truth?\\" At times, Bahinabai's abhangas call out to her god Vithoba (Panduranga, Hari) to help her to balance her twin roles. Bahinabai's wisdom can be summed up in her words as: \\"A woman's body is a body controlled by somebody else. Therefore the path of renunciation is not open to her.\\"Aklujkar p. 129 Bahinabai's philosophy reveals the social status of the seventeenth century Indian woman, who was supposed to no existence apart from her husband.Anandkar p. 71 She has also composed a text called Pundalika-Mahatmya, which details the legend of Vithoba and devotee Pundalik, a central figure in Varkari tradition. p. 56 ==NotesReferences== * * Pandharipande, Rajeshwari V.

This made the Nelson Battalion of Militia the first Army unit to be formed in the South Island and indeed one of the first in New Zealand. The 2nd Battalion (Canterbury and Nelson-Marlborough, and West Coast), Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment celebrates 12 August 1845 as the beginning of its preceding units. ==History== The battalion was commanded by a Commandant, Captain Donald Sinclair, who was also the Nelson Magistrate and was organised into two companies, each of 50 men. The appointment of the Commandant and other officers was gazetted on 28 August 1845 as being: * Captains: Donald Sinclair, John D. Greenwood, David Monro * Lieutenants: Thomas Renwick, Francis Dillion Bell * Ensigns: Charles Thorpe, Alexander le Grand Campbell * Quartermaster: Henry Seymour * Adjutant: Richard Newcombe The Militia Act of 1845, enabled the Governor to form local Militia units in districts that were under threat of hostile actions or emergencies. All males between the ages of 18 and 60, excepting judges, members of the Legislative Council, Māori and clergymen were expected to make themselves available for 28 days service every year. These Militia units were only permitted to operate within 25 mile radius of the settlement, and were consequently used mainly for garrison duties. Uniforms were a blue shirt of sailor type pattern, a cap and trousers of any type. Whilst armaments were old flintlock muskets - weapons that had originally been imported for bartering with the Māori. It is believed that the Nelson Militia had fifes and drums to provide them with musical support. The battalion paraded and trained three times a day for the first 28 days at Fort Arthur in Nelson. By 28 November 1845 the last of the Militiamen had completed their service obligations and the unit was disbanded. ==Fort Arthur== Fort Arthur was an elongated hexagonal earthwork about 445 ft by 259 ft (136 m by 80 m), with bastions at each corner, on the flanks of a hill. Within the earthworks, on high ground, stood a stockade measuring 156 ft by 48 ft (48 m by 15 m). It had been built in September 1843 on the site of what is now Christ Church Cathedral (or Cathedral Hill) by the New Zealand Company, to provide a safe haven for the settlers of Nelson following the Wairau Massacre and growing aggression from local Māori. ==See also== *10th (Nelson) Mounted Rifles ==References== * Latter, E.

The organisation's mission is \\"to promote the capacity, confidence and wellbeing of communities through the sharing of information, education and counselling, including the encouragement of women and children to recognise their potential and rights to participate in decision making.\\" Its head office is located in the capital city of Phnom Penh, however Khemara operates in seven of Cambodia's twenty five provinces. Over the past 25 years, Khemara has developed a range of services to protect and empower women and children to improve the quality of their lives. All programs are based on a robust set of principles for identifying those most in need in the community and establishing a clear and concise implementation plan. Working directly with commune councils, commune councils for women and children and communities across a range of project areas, Khemara’s services include: provision of childcare centres, child protection, justice for children, HIV prevention, non-formal education & vocational training, public health services, and income generation & capacity building. Khemara is recognised as a \\"child safe organisation\\" by the Cambodian government. == Khemara's Projects  Childcare Centres === Khemara's childcare centres are in line with Sustainable Development Goal 4, The Cambodian government's Education Strategic Plan and National Policy on Early Childhood Care and Development. Our childcare centres provide protection, care and education to vulnerable children, enabling parents and caregivers to earn a living to support their families and improve their quality of life. \\"Over 600 children aged 3 – 6 years old are provided with free pre-school education in 14 childcare centres in the Phnom Penh region and Tbong Khmum Province, supported by teachers and volunteers. Every centre is dedicated to giving children the best start to their education. In a happy and caring environment, the children receive literacy and numeracy education in both Khmer and English, with educational games to enhance and develop social and cognitive skills.\\" Balanced meals and health check-ups are integral to the running of our centres. This YouTube video shows a day in the life of a Khemara childcare centre. === Child Protection === \\"With such dire deprivation and poverty in Cambodia, it is vital we identify and assist orphans, vulnerable children and their families affected by HIV. Working with commune chiefs and the commune council for women and children (CCWC), we work to increase child rights awareness and commitment in communities, organise forums to discuss issues associated with HIV, child protection, and encourage education.\\" === Justice for Children === \\"Justice for Children ensures children are aware of their rights, receive preventative support when vulnerable and appropriate protection, legal advice and support when in the justice system – whether in conflict with the law or are victims of crime.\\" === HIV Prevention === Khemara's \\"HIV Prevention and Education project identifies people most at risk of contracting HIV and promotes awareness of STIs and other venereal and communicable diseases through outreach programs. By educating and working alongside the local ‘Key Affected Population’, predominantly Entertainment Workers (EW) including drug users, Men who have sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender groups (TG), we continue to successfully remove the stigma associated with HIV and other STIs within the local communities.\\" \\"It is also very important these vulnerable groups understand the various preventative measures at their disposal – be it the distribution of free condoms or simple classes on contraception and awareness. For our HIV Prevention and Education projects, Khemara works in the Preah Sihanouk Province and the urban Russey Keo district of Phnom Penh.\\" === Non-formal Education & Vocational Training === Khemara's \\"non formal education initiative works to promote and provide non-formal education to women, including literacy classes and vocational training. The programs objective is to free vulnerable women from sexual exploitation and discrimination, and to create opportunities to seek an alternative income. Through basic training in numeracy, literacy and problem solving, our students have the opportunity to improve the quality of their lives. Our vocational skills training provides courses such as sewing, hairdressing and cooking.\\" === Income Generation & Capacity Building === \\"The income generation and capacity building project is a partnership between Khemara Cambodia and Projects Abroad. It aims to promote local development by providing small, zero interest loans to members of the community interested in starting, or expanding their businesses. These beneficiaries are provided with ongoing training and guidance that helps serve them in their businesses and create a greater opportunities for success.\\" == Get Involved == Every effort counts. We help Cambodian women and children live in safety, where their hopes and aspirations can become realities rather than a lifetime of poverty and exclusion. Together, we can create a better future for Cambodia’s women and children. We want to give women a voice, and provide children with the tools to make the most of their lives. With your help, we can continue to improve the lives and future life chances of so many Cambodian families living in conditions of severe deprivation and poverty.

During that time, he published a number of significant papers and became known informally as \\"polynomial Pan\\" for his pioneering work in the area of polynomial computations. In late 1970s, he immigrated to the United States and held positions at several institutions including IBM Research. Since 1988, he has taught at Lehman College of the City University of New York. ==Contributions== Victor Pan is an expert in computational complexity and has developed a number of new algorithms. One of his notable early results is a proof that the number of multiplications in Horner's method is optimal. In the theory of matrix multiplication algorithms, Pan in 1978 published an algorithm with running time O(n^{2.795}). This was the first improvement over the Strassen algorithm, and kicked off a long line of improvements in fast matrix multiplication that later included the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm and subsequent developments. He wrote the text How to Multiply Matrices Faster (Springer, 1984) surveying early developments in this area. In 1998, with his student Xiaohan Huang, Pan showed that matrix multiplication algorithms can take advantage of rectangular matrices with unbalanced aspect ratios, multiplying them more quickly than the time bounds one would obtain using square matrix multiplication algorithms. Since that work, Pan has returned to symbolic and numeric computation and to an earlier theme of his research, computations with polynomials. He developed fast algorithms for the numerical computation of polynomial roots, and, with Bernard Mourrain, algorithms for multivariate polynomials based on their relations to structured matrices. He also authored or co-authored several more books, on matrix and polynomial computation, structured matrices, and on numerical root-finding procedures. ==Recognition== Pan was appointed Distinguished Professor at Lehman College in 2000. In 2013 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, for \\"contributions to the mathematical theory of computation\\". ==Selected publicationsResearch papers=Books=References * *Profile in American Scientist Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American computer scientists Category:Soviet emigrants to the United States Category:Soviet mathematicians Category:Soviet computer scientists Category:Theoretical computer scientists Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Lehman College faculty ","title":"Victor Pan"},{"id":"20369426","text":"Ozhalur Viswanatha Mudaliar Alagesan () (6 September 1911 – 3 January 1992) was an Indian politician and freedom fighter from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

Dudley Leavitt (1720–1762) was a Congregational minister born in New Hampshire, educated at Harvard College, who led a splinter group from the First Church in Salem, Massachusetts, during a wave of religious ferment nearly a decade before the Great Awakening. Following Leavitt's death at age 42, his congregation elected to christen itself 'The Church of Which the Rev. Dudley Leavitt was late Pastor' after the charismatic preacher.A Memorial of the Old and New Tabernacle, Salem, Massachusetts, 1854-5, Samuel Melanchthon Worcester, Published by Crocker and Brewster, 1855 Leavitt Street in Salem is named for the early minister. ==Life and work== Leavitt was born in Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1720 to a family with Puritan roots going back to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Leavitt's parents were Moses Leavitt Jr. of Exeter and his wife Sarah (née Leavitt) Leavitt.Sarah Ann Leavitt, the mother of Rev. Dudley Leavitt, was the daughter of Samuel Leavitt, born in Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1641, who later moved with his brother Moses to Exeter, New Hampshire. Samuel Leavitt's daughter Sarah Ann, born in Stratham, New Hampshire, in 1685, married her first cousin Moses Leavitt. Dudley Leavitt was named for his paternal great-grandfather Thomas Dudley, second colonial governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Educated at Harvard College, where he graduated at age 19 in 1739, Dudley Leavitt was first ordained pastor of Exeter's church in 1743, where he served for two years. On October 23, 1745, he was ordained second minister of a splinter church of First Church in Salem. (The congregation had followed Rev. Samuel Fisk from the church a decade prior to Leavitt's arrival, and although informally known as the Third Church, the congregation continued to insist on calling itself the First Church.) On September 21, 1751, the young minister married Mary Pickering of Salem,The Life of Timothy Pickering, Octavius Pickering, Charles Wentworth Upham, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2006 born at Salem's Pickering House, the daughter of Deacon Timothy Pickering and sister of Revolutionary War patriot Timothy Pickering.The Salem Press Historical and Genealogical Record, Vol. I, The Salem Press Publishing and Printing Company, Salem Massachusetts, 1891 Three years after his marriage Dudley Leavitt's uncle Moses Leavitt died at Stratham, New Hampshire, and named the novice preacher in his will.Will of Moses Leavitt, 1754, Stratham, New Hampshire, genealogy.com A year later, in 1749, Leavitt's brother Stephen died at Exeter, leaving Dudley most of his Stratham lands.Provincial and State Papers, Published by Authority of the Legislature of New Hampshire, Vol. 3, 1741-1749, Henry Harrison Metcalf, The Rumford Press, Concord, N.H., 1915 Rev. Leavitt was caught up in the wave of religious ferment which swept New England, taking the helm of the splinter group founded by Rev. Fisk, later known as the Third Church of Salem. \\"Our predecessors who built the former house\\", recounts the church history, \\"were thus compelled by a power, equal to that of the bayonet, to leave the place which they greatly loved, and to which they deeply, if not justly, felt that they had all the rights of a majority to retain.\\" Leavitt was part of the New Light evangelical movement that swept New England. Within the esteemed First Church, the movement by the evangelicals had shaken the Church to its foundations and prompted the exodus of the congregation Leavitt later led. In a letter from 'a gentleman in Salem' to a Boston friend in October 1745, the anonymous author recounted the subsequent dismissal of Fisk by his congregation, and his replacement by the young Leavitt. The letter was printed as a supplement to the newspaper The Boston Evening-Post on November 18, 1745, when printer Thomas Fleet openly identified himself as the printer of the anonymous letter.A Letter from a gentleman in Salem, to his friend in Boston, October 25, 1745, National Library of Australia Meriting a supplement to the daily newspaper of the state's capital, the episode epitomized the religious debates still raging in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts over a century after its founding as a Puritan refuge. \\"Mr. Leavitt was ordained at Salem about this time with vast disturbance\\", noted a contemporary ministerial observer. The observer attributed the disturbance to the fact that the schismatic congregation, still claiming to be the First Church of Salem, had axed the very man who led it out in protest.Journals of the Rev. Thomas Smith, and the Rev. Samuel Deane: Pastors of the First Church in Portland: with Notes and Biographical Notices: and a Summary History of Portland, Thomas Smith, Samuel Deane, Samuel Freeman, William Willis, Published by J.S. Bailey, 1849 The Third Church of Salem had been born of dissent: it split off from the First Church in 1735 under the leadership of Rev. Samuel Fisk, who had been let go by the First Church. Following Fisk's dismissal by his new congregation in 1745, the pastorate of Third Church was assumed by Leavitt.The Claims of the Tabernacle Church, Massachusetts Tabernacle Church, Salem, 1847 Dudley Leavitt's assumption of his minister's post in place of Samuel Fisk preceded the Great Awakening by a decade. The autocratic Fisk had broken off from his church in 1735, then a decade later he himself was deposed when church elders rebelled against ministerial authority and picked Leavitt as their candidate of change. Apparently in the decade of Fisk's control, his stern discipline in church matters alienated some of his supporters. After Leavitt's ordination, some of those who had voted a decade earlier to separate from First Church with Fisk instead elected to return to worship with their former enemies. Such were the ways of New England theocracy.Tenacious of Their Liberties: The Congregationalists in Colonial Massachusetts, James Fenimore Cooper, Oxford University Press US, 2002 Seeking reconciliation with other church members after Leavitt's ordination, the Third Church appealed to ecclesiastical authorities in Boston for reconciliation after Fisk's dismissal. In 1748, a letter was penned by Leavitt's congregation repenting the \\"misconduct of their Brethren from whom we had withdrawn communion\\", according to ecclesiastical authorities in Boston. The letter from Rev. Leavitt's church \\"acknowledging their offense, and asking Forgiveness and reconciliation\\" was meant to assuage those who were put off by Fisk's ministerial authoritarianism.History of the Old South Church (Third Church), Boston, 1669-1884, Hamilton Andrews Hill, Appleton P. C. Griffin, Published by Houghton, Mifflin and Company, Boston, 1889 The congregation's actions to atone for the offense they had apparently given under Fisk were applauded by church authorities in Massachusetts, who voted to resume contact with the Salem congregation. The confession was \\"so far satisfactory that the churches of the excommunicating council rescinded the actions of that council, one after another voting to resume the relations of fellowship.\\"Manual By United Church Board for Homeland Ministries, Vol. 4, Published by JMV-HHM, 1857 By the time of the Great Awakening, almost a decade later, Rev. Leavitt was seen as a 'New Light', and Rev. Fisk, who had himself been a call for change, as an 'Old Light'.The Life and Labors of Rev. Samuel Worcester, D.D.: Former Pastor of the Tabernacle Church, Salem, Massachusetts, Vol. I, Samuel Melanchthon Worcester, Published by Crocker and Brewster, Boston, 1852 Dudley Leavitt's congregation continued to cling to the name of First Church of Salem until 1763, a year after Leavitt's death, when the congregation finally assumed the name of Third Church of Christ in Salem.Report of the Commissioner of Public Records, Massachusetts Record Commission, v. 9-15, 1897 In a list of deceased ministers of 1764, Dudley Leavitt was still listed as minister of the First Church of Salem, even though the First Church refused to acknowledge that it had lost part of its congregation.The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, New England Historic Genealogical Society, Published by New England Historic Genealogical Society, 1908 Timothy Pickering of Salem; his sister Mary Pickering married Rev.

The bout took place on December 6, 2008 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. Pacquiao defeated De La Hoya via technical knockout when De La Hoya decided not to continue with the fight before the start of the ninth round. The card was a co-production of Bob Arum's Top Rank Boxing and De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions and was aired live on pay-per-view (PPV) on HBO PPV. The fight is notable for propelling Manny Pacquiao to full-blown superstar status in much of the western world (mostly in The United States), as Oscar De La Hoya symbolically \\"passed the torch\\", so to speak, to Pacquiao. Despite no title belts being disputed, the bout received a lot of publicity since the two boxers were decorated, with Pacquiao being the current number one pound for pound boxer in the world as judged by The Ring, and a five-time world champion in five different weight divisions (Pacquiao was the reigning WBC lightweight champion at the time of the bout). Meanwhile, De La Hoya was an Olympic gold medalist and past holder of 10 world titles in six weight divisions. Pacquiao had to step up two weight divisions (from lightweight), and De La Hoya had to go down one weight division (from light middleweight), to be eligible for the bout's welterweight division. ==Idea of the bout== Karylle sang Lupang Hinirang, the Philippine national anthem. The ideas of having De La Hoya and Pacquiao fight came from HBO boxing analyst Larry Merchant talking with ESPN boxing analyst Dan Rafael. Larry then presented the idea to Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer and Top Rank CEO Bob Arum. Bob presented the idea to Manny Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach. It was even mentioned on the PPV broadcast that it was Larry's idea, even mentioning Dan Rafael by name. Freddie Roach since the De La Hoya- Mayweather fight has said in the media and in the De La Hoya/Pacquiao 24/7 series, press conferences, promos leading to the Dream Match that Oscar \\"can't pull the trigger anymore.\\" ==Buildup== After De La Hoya's May 5 loss to Floyd Mayweather, Jr. in 2007 (see De La Hoya- Mayweather boxing match), De La Hoya decided to close out his career with three fights in 2008. The first would be a tune-up bout in May before finishing with two mega bouts in September and December respectively. De La Hoya defeated Stevie Forbes in the May tune-up bout in preparation for Mayweather. Due to Mayweather's unexpected retirement however, Ricky Hatton was the new potential candidate to fight De La Hoya on September 20. However, Hatton rejected the offer because he felt the scheduled date was too close to his last bout. De La Hoya then decided to pass on a fight in September to set the stage for a showdown against either Manny Pacquiao or Miguel Cotto, should Cotto win his fight against Antonio Margarito in July. After Cotto was defeated by Margarito, it was announced that De La Hoya and Pound For Pound superstar Manny Pacquiao had agreed to fight December 6, 2008 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas at the welterweight limit of 147 lbs. On August 28, 2008, a teleconference was held by Golden Boy Promotions to officially announce the fight.Rafael, Dan.Sources: De La Hoya, Pacquiao agree to Dec. 6 fight in Vegas, ESPN.com ==Pre-fight publicity== Presented by Golden Boy Promotions and Top Rank, Inc., the bout was scheduled as a 12-round, non-title fight contested at the 147-pound welterweight limit. Although Pacquiao went into the fight recognized as the leading pound-for-pound boxer in the world, some boxing pundits speculated that 147 pounds could be too far above his natural weight against the larger De La Hoya. Many boxing analysts believed the fight would favor Oscar. Boxing analysts stated that Oscar's size, reach, experience, and good chin made Manny the underdog in this mega fight. Training for the fight Oscar hired trainers Angelo Dundee, Ignacio \\"Nacho\\" Beristain, and young boxing talent Edwin Valero. Oscar told the news that his team is unbeatable, while Freddie Roach said, \\"No one is going to be able to help Oscar pull the trigger when he faces Manny Pacquiao on Dec. 6\\". Tickets reportedly sold out just hours after they went on sale. The total gate revenues were said to be nearly $17 million. That amount apparently gave the bout the second-largest gate revenue in boxing history (after the De La Hoya- Mayweather Jr. fight on May 5, 2007 which generated $18.4 million in gate revenue). == The fight == Manny Pacquiao soundly defeated Oscar De La Hoya, surprising many pre-fight analysts who had predicted a victory by De La Hoya. The fight ended at the beginning of the 9th round after Oscar and his corner threw in the towel. ===Rounds 1–4=== On round 1, De La Hoya's opening punches miss Pacquiao; Pacquiao's own straight left followed by a combination connects. The boxers exchange punches, with another Pacquiao straight left to end the round. At the start of the second round, a double jab by De La Hoya persuades Pacquiao to retreat. Only the second of De La Hoya's two combinations hits Pacquiao. A combo from Pacquiao leaves De La Hoya's face reddened. A flurry of punches from Pacquiao ends the round. The third round is more of the same as De La Hoya becomes increasingly unable to answer Pacquiao's combos. ===Rounds 5–7=== Pacquiao unleashes a flurry of punches in round 5; De La Hoya saw it coming but wasn't able to react fast enough. De La Hoya himself lands a body shot and a couple of hooks, but the two boxers exchange punches at the end of the round. The next round begins as the last ended, with the men exchanging jabs. Pacquiao appears winded as he misses a left hook, but the follow-up lands on target. Pacquiao lands a right, and a four-punch combo to end the round. In Round 7, Pacquiao lands a jab as De La Hoya misses his; Pacquiao unleashes another flurry of punches as De La Hoya's legs almost gave out, just as he ceased punching back. His uppercut misses Pacquiao as his opponent releases more jabs to end round 7. ===Round 8 and aftermath=== Pacquiao pursues De La Hoya's body but is warned by referee Tony Weeks to \\"keep them up\\" (keep punches above the belt). De La Hoya's right connects, but Pacquiao's combo pins De La Hoya in the corner. Another left by Pacquiao dazes the Mexican-American, as the Filipino follows up with another combination which wobbles De La Hoya. Pacquiao throws another combo as De La Hoya goes for the body. The Filipino unleashes a four-punch combo to end the round. The fight is stopped before the start of the ninth round and Pacquiao is awarded the victory. Pacquiao was ahead on all three judges' scorecards before the stoppage, with two judges scoring the fight at 80-71 (Pacquiao won all rounds) and one scoring it at 79–72 (Pacquiao won 7 rounds and lost 1). After the bout trainer Freddie Roach stated, \\"We knew we had him after the first round. He had no legs, he was hesitant and he was shot.\\" Confirming Roach's pre-fight predictions that he'd grown too old, De La Hoya crossed the ring to Pacquiao's corner after the bout was stopped and told Roach, \\"You're right Freddie. I don't have it anymore.\\" When asked by reporters whether he would continue fighting, De La Hoya responded, \\"My heart still wants to fight, that's for sure. But when your physical doesn't respond, what can you do? I have to be smart and make sure I think about my future plans.\\"https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hx1Xddmk1C1IaY354rWTaDLoj6OAD94TM1GG0 ==Business== On December 10, 2008, HBO announced that the fight generated 1.25 million PPV buys totalling more than $70 million in PPV revenue. This fight was only the fourth non-heavyweight bout to have more than one million buys at that time, along with De La Hoya–Mayweather Jr. (2.4 million buys) in May 2007, De La Hoya–Hopkins (1 million buys) in 2004, and De La Hoya–Trinidad (1.4 million buys) in 1999.

La Follette (born September 19, 1926) is an American politician from California and a member of the Republican party. ==Early career== La Follette began her political career in the '60s as an aide to then Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty. In 1969 she won a seat on the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees. She was a candidate for state controller in 1974 but lost in the Republican primary. In 1975 she was defeated for reelection to the college board by Ira Reiner, who would later become Los Angeles District Attorney. She joined the Los Angeles-based staff of newly elected U.S. Senator SI Hayakawa in 1977 and worked for him until 1980, when she ran for the legislature. ==State Assembly== La Follette won election to the 38th district in the California State Assembly, succeeding fellow Republican Paul V. Priolo. After the 1981 reapportionment, her district shifted entirely into the San Fernando Valley, forcing her to move from her Malibu home to Northidge. Early in her first term she authored legislation that would have broken up the Los Angeles Unified School District creating an independent district for the San Fernando Valley. Though the legislation was unsuccessful, the public debate it ignited (on whether the LA district is too large) lasts to this day. In 1986 La Follette made national headlines when she called for drug tests for California legislators. She also pushed for legislation to enact the death penalty for drug kingpins. She left the Assembly in 1990 to care for her ailing husband John Travis and endorsed her top aide, 24-year-old Rob Wilcox for the Republican nomination. Wilcox narrowly lost to realtor Paula Boland in the primary. ==Post Legislature== La Follette moved to Newport Beach where her two sons lived. John Travis died in 1991 and she returned to public life in 1992, moving to Thousand Oaks to run for state senate. ==State Senate race== The 19th State Senate District was being vacated by GOP stalwart Ed Davis, who had decided to retire. Davis, a former Los Angeles Police Chief, didn't much like the declared candidate for the seat, state assemblywoman Cathie Wright (whom he dubbed \\"The peroxide princess of Simi Valley\\"),\\"Complete Primary Results,\\" by A.G. Block, California Journal, July 1992, p.347. so he openly recruited La Follette to run in the GOP primary (a decision Wright said was \\"out of spite\\"). Despite Davis' considerable backing, however, La Follette lost to Wright 38% to 33%. ==Later years== After her election loss, La Follette moved back to Newport Beach. She was subsequently appointed to the Orange County Fair Board by Governor Pete Wilson. In the mid '90s La Follette ran an inn in Downeyville, California, which she credited with saving her life following her husband John Travis's death. She currently splits her time between Newport Beach and Northern California. ==References== Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:Living people Category:People from Van Nuys, Los Angeles Category:Women state legislators in California Category:California Republicans Category:1926 births ","title":"Marion W.

(2008) Multiple pathways for sorting mitochondrial precursor proteins. EMBO J 9(1): 42-49 ==Complex components== The sorting and assembly machinery is made up of three subunits, Sam35, Sam37 and Sam50, of which Sam50 is embedded within the outer mitochondrial membrane.Bolender, N., Sickmann, A., Wagner, R., Meisinger, C., Pfanner, N. (2008) Multiple pathways for sorting mitochondrial precursor proteins. EMBO J 9(1): 42-49. Both Sam35 and Sam37 are located on the cytosolic face of the SAM complex are peripheral membrane proteins that are not essential for survival.Chan, N.C, and Lithgow, T. (2008) The Peripheral Membrane Subunits of the SAM Complex Function Codependently in Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Biogenesis. Mol. Biol. Cell 19(1): 126-136 Sam35 is believed to bind to substrate proteins, while Sam37 acts after Sam35 to stimulate release of the substrate protein from the SAM complex. ==Protein import and integration== The sorting and assembly machinery is required for the assembly of beta barrel proteins, this includes proteins such as the Tom40 import pore and porin. Like all mitochondrial proteins, beta barrel proteins are transported into the intermembrane space of mitochondria via the translocase of the outer membrane. Following import, beta barrel proteins are transported to the SAM complex by chaperone complexes, formed by assembly of the small Tim proteins. The complex formed by the three sorting and assembly machinery subunits (SAM core complex), is responsible for the integration of beta barrel proteins into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mdm10 is another mitochondrial membrane protein that is responsible for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and distribution. It has been found to interact with the SAM core complex and may play a role in assembling Tom40 into the translocase of the outer membrane. ==NotesReferences== *Bolender, N., Sickmann, A., Wagner, R., Meisinger, C., Pfanner, N.

During the 2005 season, Mougey replaced starting quarterback Kevin O'Connell. ===2007=== The Aztecs wanted to utilize Mougey's superior size and athleticism, so they tried him out at wide receiver. At 6-foot-6 and boasting an impressive knack for catching footballs, he became a starter in his first game as a receiver. He played nine games in 2007, finishing third on the team with 32 catches for 368 yards and scoring two touchdowns. He missed three games due to injury. ===2008=== In his senior year in 2008, Mougey was matched with redshirt freshman quarterback Ryan Lindley, and Mougey was expected to be the main target of the young passer. Mougey missed two games, but still managed to improve his production to 34 receptions for 437 yards while scoring five times.

Drums and guitars were recorded at Straight Jacket Studios, Allston, Massachusetts from July to August 1996. Vocals were recorded at Trax East, South River, New Jersey in September 1996, where the album was also mixed. Split material that's featured on the CD editions of the album were all recorded and mixed at Trax East in April 1995. When the album was released in February 1997, the trio scheduled a tour in Japan to support the record. However, due to rising band tensions of scheduling conflicts, guitarist Rob Marton left the band, with Steve Procopio hired to fill in for his place. By the time the tour was completed in 1998, the group went on hiatus.

The program sought to promote confidence in the US banking system by guaranteeing interbank loans and no- interest transaction accounts, such as checking accounts. It was announced through an Interim Rule on October 14, 2008. ==Components== The Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program had two primary components: the Debt Guarantee Program, by which the FDIC guaranteed the payment of certain newly issued senior unsecured debt, and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program, by which the FDIC guaranteed certain noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. FDIC insured entities could opt out of either program. ===Debt Guarantee Program=== The Debt Guarantee Program guaranteed all newly issued senior unsecured debt up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities. As a result of this guarantee, the unpaid principal and contract interest of an entity’s newly issued senior unsecured debt were to be paid by the FDIC if the issuing insured depository institution failed or if a bankruptcy petition were filed by the respective issuing holding company. More than 6000 banks opted out of the program.DGP Opt-out list (.xls) The Debt Guarantee Program passed out debt guarantees in excess of $600 billion. Yet, unlike the other major agencies bailing out the financial sector during the global financial crisis of 2008—the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury—the FDIC has never disclosed the identity of all the banks taking advantage of the bailout guarantees. Wilson and Wu (2011) find that the recipients of the FDIC debt guarantees paid their CEOs significantly more than their peers. Thus, bailed out CEOs made significantly more than bank CEOs not accepting the FDIC's bailout loan guarantees.Wilson, Linus and Wu, Yan, Overpaid CEOs Got FDIC Debt Guarantees (December 27, 2011). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1977345 The Debt Guarantee Program stopped guaranteeing outstanding loans at the end of 2012. ===Transaction Account Guarantee Program=== The Transaction Account Guarantee Program provided for a temporary full guarantee by the FDIC for funds held at FDIC-insured depository institutions in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts above the existing deposit insurance limit. This would continue through the end of 2010. Thereafter section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act provided similar transaction account insurance until the end of 2012. ==See also== * Global financial crisis of 2008 ==References== * FDIC resources for TLGP * text of final rule * FDIC press release concerning release of final rule Category:Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ","title":"Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program"},{"id":"20370101","text":"Duaij Naser Abdulla (born January 18, 1983) is a Bahraini footballer currently playing for Al-Hala of Bahrain and the Bahrain national football team. ==External links== * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Bahraini footballers Category:Al-Gharafa SC players Category:Al- Shamal SC players Category:Al-Wakrah SC players Category:Qatar Stars League players Category:Bahraini Premier League players Category:Al Hala SC players Category:Association football forwards Category:Bahrain international footballers ","title":"Duaij Naser Abdulla"},{"id":"20370140","text":"Mount Santo Tomas is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Philippines located in the municipality of Tuba in the province of Benguet. THE AREA IS OFF LIMITS TO TOURISTS. On May 5, 2015, a Permanent Environmental Protection Order was issued by the Court of Appeals with the Writ of Kalikasan and Writ of Continuing Mandamus. Due to its high elevation, several communications and broadcasting companies constructed relay stations at the summit. ==Physical features== Mount Santo Tomas is a stratovolcano with numerous volcanic vents and fissures. ==Listings== Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) lists Mount Santo Tomas as potentially active volcano. The Global Volcanism Program is uncertain about the last activity of Mount Santo Tomas. ==Eruptions== There was a report of an eruption or \\"displacement\\" in the region on January 4, 1641, described as an outburst of water accompanied by an earthquake. January 4, 1641 is the date of the major eruption of Mt Parker volcano in southern Mindanao that impacted much of the Philippines. There have been no reports since. ==Geology== Rock type is not reported. Mount Santo Tomas is close to the auriferous volcanic placements near Baguio, and beside the fault line which occasioned the July 16, 1990 earthquake devastating much of Luzon, and especially Baguio. ==See also== *List of active volcanoes in the Philippines *List of potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines *List of inactive volcanoes in the Philippines *Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology ==References== Santo Tomas Santo Tomas Santo Tomas Santo Tomas Category:Landforms of Benguet ","title":"Mount Santo Tomas"},{"id":"20370177","text":"Nephrolenellus is an extinct genus of trilobite, fossil marine arthropods, of relatively small size (sagittal length of cephalon rarely exceeds 11 mm). Currently two species are attributed to it. Nephrolenellus lived at the end of the Lower Cambrian. Species are known from the Great Basin of California, Nevada and Arizona, with one specimen from Canada. == Taxonomy == N. geniculatus may have been a direct descendant of N. multinodus. == Distribution == Nephrolenellus multinodus occurs in the late Lower Cambrian of California (Toyonian, Pyramid Shale Member, Carrara Formation, Inyo County, 35.8° N, 116.2° W). and of Nevada (Toyonian, Lincoln County; and C-Shale Member, Pioche Formation, Ruin Wash, Chief Range, 37.8° N, 114.6° W). == Description == A drawing of the cephalon of Nephrolenellus geniculatusA drawing of the cephalon of Nephrolenellus multinodus As with most early trilobites, Nephrolenellus has an only thinly calcified exoskeleton. Although most of the body is rather flat, the frontal lobe (L4) of the central area of the cephalon (or glabella) is raised, but not bulbous, and does not overlap the border at the front in dorsal view. It also has the crescent-shaped eye ridges typical for the earliest trilobites. As part of the Olenellina suborder, Nephrolenellus lacks dorsal sutures. Like all other members of the Olenelloidea superfamily, the eye-ridges spring from the back of the frontal lobe (L4) of the glabella. Typically for Nephrolenellus the eyeridges are pointing backwards and significantly (45°) outwards (along the tangent between the base and termination). The glabella is strongly hourglass-shaped, very much constricted at the second pair of side lobes (L2). The furrow between the second and third pair of lobes (S2) is transverse or gently convex anteriorly. S3 is pit-like and isolated from furrow defining the glabella (or axial furrow). The spine at the outer backside of the cephalon is longer than the most backward lobe of the glabella (also called occipital ring or L0), and it is based at point the cephalon is at its widest. The prothorax consist of thirteen segments, and the third segments has enlarged side lobes (or pleural lobes) that each carry trailing spine at the side that is comparable in length to the entire exoskeleton. It lacks the long axial spine where prothorax ends. The portion of the thorax where the pleural lobes are reduced (or opisthothorax) consist of at least 23 segments. == References == Category:Cambrian trilobites of North America Category:Redlichiida genera Category:Biceratopsidae ","title":"Nephrolenellus"},{"id":"20370193","text":"Papyrus 123 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by \\\\mathfrak{P}123, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek.

Hydrogen- cooled turbo generators are designed to provide a low-drag atmosphere and cooling for single-shaft and combined-cycle applications in combination with steam turbines. Because of the high thermal conductivity and other favorable properties of hydrogen gas this is the most common type in its field today. ==History== Based on the air-cooled turbo generator, gaseous hydrogen first went into service as the coolant in a hydrogen-cooled turbo generator in October 1937, at the Dayton Power & Light Co. in Dayton, Ohio. ==Design== The use of gaseous hydrogen as a coolant is based on its properties, namely low density, high specific heat, and the highest thermal conductivity (at 0.168 W/(m·K)) of all gases; it is 7-10 times better at cooling than air. Another advantage of hydrogen is its easy detection by hydrogen sensors. A hydrogen- cooled generator can be significantly smaller, and therefore less expensive, than an air-cooled one. For stator cooling, water can be used. Helium with a thermal-conductivity of 0.142 W/(m·K) was considered as coolant as well, however its high cost hinders its adoption despite its non-flammability. Generally, three cooling approaches are used. For generators up to 60 MW, air cooling can be used. Between 60-450 MW hydrogen cooling is employed. For the highest power generators, up to 1800 MW, hydrogen and water cooling is used; the rotor is hydrogen-cooled, the stator windings are made of hollow copper tubes cooled with water circulating through them. The generators produce high voltage; the choice of voltage depends on the tradeoff between demands of electrical insulation and handling high electric current. For generators up to 40 MVA, the voltage is 6.3 kV; large generators with power above 1000 MW generate voltages up to 27 kV; voltages between 2.3-30 kV are used depending on the size of the generator. The generated power is sent to a nearby step-up transformer, where it is converted to the electric power transmission line voltage (typically between 115 and 1200 kV). To control the centrifugal forces at high rotational speeds, the rotor diameter typically does not exceed 1.25 meters; the required large size of the coils is achieved by their length and so the generator is mounted horizontally. Two-pole machines typically operate at 3000 rpm for 50 Hz and 3600 rpm for 60 Hz systems, half of that for four- pole machines. The turbogenerator also contains a smaller generator producing direct current excitation power for the rotor coil. Older generators used dynamos and slip rings for DC injection to the rotor, but the moving mechanical contacts were subject to wear. Modern generators have the excitation generator on the same shaft as the turbine and main generator; the diodes needed are located directly on the rotor. The excitation current on larger generators can reach 10 kA. The amount of excitation power ranges between 0.5-3% of the generator output power. The rotor usually contains caps or cage made of nonmagnetic material; its role is to provide a low impedance path for eddy currents which occur when the three phases of the generator are unevenly loaded. In such cases, eddy currents are generated in the rotor, and the resulting Joule heating could in extreme cases destroy the generator. Hydrogen gas is circulated in a closed loop to remove heat from the active parts then it is cooled by gas-to-water heat exchangers on the stator frame. The working pressure is up to 6 bar. An on-line thermal conductivity detector (TCD) analyzer is used with three measuring ranges. The first range (80-100% H2) to monitor the hydrogen purity during normal operation. The second (0-100% H2) and third (0-100% CO2) measuring ranges allow safe opening of the turbines for maintenance. Hydrogen has very low viscosity, a favorable property for reducing drag losses in the rotor; these losses can be significant, as the rotors have large diameter and high rotational speed. Every reduction in the purity of the hydrogen coolant increases windage losses in the turbine; as air is 14 times more dense than hydrogen, each 1% of air corresponds to about 14% increase of density of the coolant and the associated increase of viscosity and drag. A purity drop from 97 to 95% in a large generator can increase windage losses by 32%; this equals to 685 kW for a 907 MW generator. The windage losses also increase heat losses of the generator and the associated cooling problems. ==Operation== The absence of oxygen in the atmosphere within significantly reduces the damage of the windings insulation by eventual corona discharges; these can be problematic as the generators typically operate at high voltage, often 20 kV. ===Seal oil system=== The bearings have to be leak- tight. A hermetic seal, usually a liquid seal, is employed; a turbine oil at pressure higher than the hydrogen inside is typically used. A metal, e.g. brass, ring is pressed by springs onto the generator shaft, the oil is forced under pressure between the ring and the shaft; part of the oil flows into the hydrogen side of the generator, another part to the air side. The oil entrains a small amount of air; as the oil is recirculated, some of the air is carried over into the generator. This causes a gradual air contamination buildup and requires maintaining hydrogen purity. Scavenging systems are used for this purpose; gas (mixture of entrained air and hydrogen, released from the oil) is collected in the holding tank for the sealing oil, and released into the atmosphere; the hydrogen losses have to be replenished, either from gas cylinders or from on-site hydrogen generators. Degradation of bearings leads to higher oil leaks, which increases the amount of air transferred into the generator. Increased oil consumption can be detected by a flow meter for each bearing. ===Drying=== Presence of water in hydrogen has to be avoided, as it causes deterioration of hydrogen's cooling properties, corrosion of the generator parts, and arcing in the high voltage windings, and reduces the lifetime of the generator. A desiccant-based dryer is usually included in the gas circulation loop, typically with a moisture probe in the dryer's outlet, sometimes also in its inlet. Presence of moisture is also indirect evidence of air leaking into the generator compartment. Another option is optimizing the hydrogen scavenging, so the dew point is kept within the generator's specifications. The water is usually introduced into the generator atmosphere as an impurity in the turbine oil; another route is via leaks in water cooling systems. ===Purging=== The flammability limits (4-75% of hydrogen in air at normal temperature, wider at high temperatures,), its autoignition temperature at 571 °C, its very low minimum ignition energy, and its tendency to form explosive mixtures with air, require provisions to be made for maintaining the hydrogen content within the generator above the upper or below the lower flammability limit at all times, and other hydrogen safety measures. When the generator is filled with hydrogen, overpressure has to be maintained as inflow of air into the generator could cause a dangerous explosion in its confined space. The generator enclosure is purged before opening it for maintenance, and before refilling the generator with hydrogen. During shutdown, hydrogen is purged by an inert gas, then the inert gas is replaced by air; the opposite sequence is used before startup. Carbon dioxide or nitrogen can be used for this purpose, as they do not form combustible mixtures with hydrogen and are inexpensive. Gas purity sensors are used to indicate the end of the purging cycle, which shortens the startup and shutdown times and reduces consumption of the purging gas. Carbon dioxide is favored as due to the very high density difference it easily displaces the hydrogen. The carbon dioxide is admitted to the bottom of the generator first, pushing the hydrogen out at the top. Then air is admitted to the top, pushing the carbon dioxide out at the bottom. Purging is best done with the generator stopped. If it is done during slow- speed unloaded rotation, the generator fans will mix the gases, greatly increasing the time required to achieve purity. ===Make-up=== Hydrogen is often produced on-site using a plant consisting of an array of electrolysis cells, compressors and storage vessels. This reduces the need for storing compressed hydrogen and allows storage in lower pressure tanks, with associated safety benefits and lower costs. Some gaseous hydrogen has to be kept for refilling the generator but it can be also generated on-site. As technology evolves materials not susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement are used in generator designs. Not doing so can lead to equipment failure from hydrogen embrittlement. ==See also== *Timeline of hydrogen technologies *Precooled jet engine ==References *The turbogenerator – A continuous engineering challenge Category:Turbines Category:Electric power Category:Hydrogen technologies de:Turbogenerator#Kühlung ","title":"Hydrogen-cooled turbo generator"},{"id":"20370236","text":"Europe Asia Business School is a B-School founded by Industrialist and Academicians including Alumni of Harvard and Cambridge Universities.

The Tyee, August 4, 2006. Accessed on September 25, 2008. The event, which took place from August 19 to 26, was marked by LGBT-themed programming in several Canadian cities, including Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Saskatoon and Winnipeg. Programming included an art festival, a dance, picnic, a screening of a documentary and a rally for gay rights that occurred in all the participating cities. The event was, however, a one-off event which did not directly result in the creation of an annual LGBT pride festival in any of the participating cities. Although all do now have annual pride festivals, each of those was created later on as a local initiative rather than evolving directly out of the 1973 program. In Vancouver over 300 people attended the arts festival and dance of the first day of the week, and many of them attended the rally on the steps of the courthouse on the following day. The initial events are also said to have been attended by straight onlookers. The rally on August 25 marked the protest aspect of the otherwise celebratory. The aim of the protest was to “hear something of the growth of the gay movement and to declare their determination to continue the struggle.”“Festive Solidarity Marks Gay Pride Week.” Gay Tide, October 1973, p5. In general the week combined elements of commemoration, celebration and protest for further change. The Pride Week of 1973 marks the shift in Vancouver from the homophile movement into the gay liberation movement. The essence of the homophile movement is that of assimilation into the general society as well as the creation of hidden network for gays and lesbians to meet one another and form a community. The gay liberation movement is more active and aims to achieve change through visibility and protest. Pride Week 1973 was clearly a visible event aiming for openness and change, it was also the first one of its kind and is therefore a tangible shift of the mentality of the gay rights movement. This was the first large-scale event organized for the purpose of celebrating the community and actively pressing for change, thus it was a watershed event in the progression of gay liberation in Vancouver. Other cities, such as Toronto, had previously held similar events. For Vancouver, and others, it was a first. Pride Week 1973 also marked the emergence of the concept of gay pride and the first Pride Parade like event in Vancouver. The rally was, although not flamboyantly colourful as pride parades are today, a typical parade of the time. It marked visibility and unity on part of the gay community, it celebrated the difference of the members of the community and aimed to incite change. However, it wasn't until 1978 that the pride parade was organized in and of itself. Due to the collaboration of Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and the other cities to organize Pride Week together, the event marks the unity, visibility and strength of the movement in Canada. It was a noticeable protest on a country wide basis. Thus this event is significant on a number of different levels, as it represents the shift from the homophile movement into the gay liberation movement, it shows the emergence of the concept of gay pride, and it can also be considered to be the first pride parade in Vancouver. == References Further reading== * Kinsman, Gary.

Its mission is \\"to promote Christ-centered marriage and family life; to help individuals and their families to live the Christian faith in everyday life; and to improve society through actions of love, service, education and example.\\" CFM action groups contain five to seven families and the adults meet one or two nights each month in each other's houses. At meetings, the members of CFM practice the Observe - Judge - Act method, usually guided by the various programs provided by the CFM USA National Office. The members discuss what they have observed in their family or neighborhood and then judge what they have observed by the standards of the life and teachings of Jesus. After these discussions, they commit to actions that will positively affect their communities, in either big or small ways. This method has led to action in such areas as \\"foster-parenting, prison ministry, refugee sponsorship, religious education and couple counseling\\". Joseph Cardijn, the founder of the Young Christian Workers Movement in Belgium, was the originator of the Observe Judge Act method (also known as the Jocist Method).Andy. Christian Family Movement. 24 NOV 2008. Christian Family Movement. 24 Nov 2008 ==History== The first CFM groups began in the early 1940s in South Bend, Indiana and Chicago, Illinois. Burnie Bauer and his wife Helene formed a Young Christian Students group in 1940. They began to include couples into their group where they used the Jocist Method (observe/judge/act) to help young married couples with their problems trying to focus on having a Christ-centered marriage. Pat Crowley and six other men began to meet in a law office in Chicago in February 1942 to discuss the laymen's role in the church community. Using the Jocist Method they began to focus their discussions on the relationship of husband and wife in relation to the church. The group hosted a day of husband and wife recollection in 1943 that marks the start of the Cana Conference. The wives of these men began to form a group that birthed the Pre-Cana Conference (the Catholic Church's conference for engaged couples). The Christian Family Movement was born when Burnie and Helene Bauer and Pat and Patty Crowley met each other at the Cana Conference in August 1948. The Christian Family Movement had its first national seminar in June 1949 where it was represented by 59 delegates from 11 different cities. Pat and Patty Crowley were first elected to be the Executive Secretary Couple where they led the movement for the next 20 years. CFM had become a nationwide movement. This was shown through its first publication (ACT), its official recognition by the church, and the way that CFM groups from other cities were able to communicate with each other. The first CFM program was called For Happier Families and was dispersed to over 2,500 groups within the span of a year. The CFM moved through the country at a fast pace in the 1950s. In the 1960s CFM even caused the formation of such new organizations as the Foundation for International Cooperation (FIC) and the Christian Family Mission Vacation. The next big move of CFM was the formation of the International Confederation of Christian Family Movements (ICCFM) in 1966 which placed CFM in over 50 nations. CFM members in 1975 wrote and tested a family centered drug awareness campaign that was published by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. They also worked together on the U.S. Bishop's Call the Action manuscript about the \\"Family\\". Members became joined in with the White House Conference on Families and were able to present eight position papers in 1979 and 1980. CFM and ICCFM contributed to Pope John Paul II's council on issues dealing with the family. ==The Changing Movement== The Christian Family Movement in the US, while still existent and active, has fewer English speaking members than in decades past, but the growth in the CFM in the Spanish Catholic community is robust. The Christian Family Movement in North America consists of three movements: CFM- USA www.cfm.org (English), MFCC-USA www.mfccusa.com (Spanish) and MFC-Los Angeles www.mfclosangeles.org (Spanish). All three are members of the International Confederation of Christian Family Movements (ICCFM), which has members in 48 countries and 4 continents, with over 90,000 families, clergy, and religious. The three US organizations reflect the increasingly multi- cultural and multi-lingual American Church. Although they are in North America, the MFCs of Mexico and Central America are associated with Latin America MFC. Over the years, the decline in membership in CFM-USA reflects the larger changes happening in the U.S. Catholic Church, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s. According to Tim Unsworth from the National Catholic Reporter, the factors contributing to the decline in CFM include the reconfirmation of the Church's prohibition on artificial birth control in Humanae Vitae, the integration of upper-class neighborhoods, the increased number of women in the working world, the increase in car travel changing parish boundaries, and the increased use of Catholic schools causing parents to be unable to see the need for having parental conversations with other adults outside of their spouse.Unsworth, Tim. \\"Millennium reunion of faded movement\\". National Catholic Reporter 37.3 (Nov 3, 2000): 18. Academic OneFile. Gale. 10 Nov. 2008 The decline of the CFM can be measured throughout the years by the declining number of families involved. Robert McClory explained in his book review of Disturbing the Peace: A History of the Christian Family Movement that \\"after 1964 the movement shrank: from a high of 50,000 couples in the United States and Canada to 32,000 in 1967, to 16,000 in 1968, to 4,313 in 1974, to an all time low of 1,100 couples in 1980\\".McClory, Robert. \\"At 50, CFM is still alive and risking\\". National Catholic Reporter 34.n38 (Sept 4, 1998): 22(1). Academic OneFile. Gale. 10 Nov. 2008 The MFC-Los Angeles (Spanish) was established in 1964 at the Parrish level. Mission San Conrado Catholic Church, Our Lady of Los Angeles (La Placita ), San Alfonso Church, St. Isabel Church were the first Parishes that initiated the MFC- Los Angeles. In 1967 Our Lady of Holy Rosary initiated the MFC. The literature and material was implemented and follow the guidelines from the MFC in Chicago. In 1970 all of the coordinators from each Parrish was invited to attend a meeting to discuss if they can be united as a team and under the umbrella of the Los Angeles Archdioceses. In this meeting, several couples attended Roberto and Consuelo Perez, Jorge and Dora Antillon, Salvador y Maria Rangel, Enrique y Pilar Pacheco, Lauro y Tere Romero including Bishop Manuel Moreno from Tucson, Arizona. In that meeting and agreement was accepted to elect vote for couple to be presidents for a term of two years. Responding to the U.S. Catholic Bishops' call that the 1980s be the Decade of the Family, CFM supplemented its annual program with special publications for teens, widows, families in crisis, families affected by divorce and separation, and middle-years families. In 1987, CFM contributed to the U.S. Bishops' preparation for the synod in Rome on the Vocation and Mission of the Laity in the Church and in the World. Six years later, CFM again offered input to the U.S. bishops for their 1994 pastoral letter, Follow the Way of Love. CFM's work to enhance the quality of Christian family life has been recognized by the National Association of Catholic Family Life Ministers (NACFLM) and it received a Circles of Peace Award from the Families Against Violence Advocacy Network (FAVAN) in 1999.Christian Family Movement. Acting on Faith: The Acts of the Apostles and Today's Christian Families. 2012. p. 80. Starting in 1994, CFM published a column called \\"Taking the Time to Make a Difference\\", written by Paul Leingang, that has received several awards for excellence in spirituality from the Catholic Press Association of the United States and Canada. In 1999 CFM celebrated its 50-year anniversary and was awarded the Salt and Light Award by the Hillenbrand Institute. More recently, CFM participated in the Pontifical Council for the Family in 2009 and the Marriage Summit of Catholic Family Life Organizations, which was organized by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2012.Christian Family Movement. Acting on Faith: The Acts of the Apostles and Today's Christian Families. 2012. p. 81. CFM leaders participated in preparation sessions for lay movements at the Synod on the Family in Rome in 2015. ==Leadership== The first national presidents were Pat and Patty Crowley from 1949 to 1968. Other presidents have been Ray and Dorothy Maldoon (1968–1977), Bob and Irene Tomonto (1977–1981), Gary and Kay Aitchison (1981–1985), Wayne and Sue Hamilton (1985–1989), Peter and Carolyn Broeren (1989–1993), Paul and Jane Leingang (1993–1997), Chuck and Jan Rogers (1997–2001), Peter and Jane Buchbauer (2001–2005), John and Lauri Przybysz (2005-2009), Bob and Anne Tomonto (2009-2013), Tom and Mary Kay Halpin (2013-2015). John and Mary Poprac (2015-2019) and the current presidents Brian and Mary Ann Thelen. ==Mission statement== The Mission Statement of CFM, taken directly from its website, was adopted by its Board of Directors on March 10, 2002. \\"The mission of the Christian Family Movement is to promote Christ- centered marriage and family life; to help individuals and their families to live the Christian faith in everyday life; and to improve society through actions of love, service, education and example\\". CFM also uses the Bible verse James 1:22—Be doers of the word, and not merely hearers—to help portray its mission to its fellow Christians. Anthony M. Pilla, Bishop of Cleveland, explained the mission of CFM best when he addressed the Christian Family Movement on August 5, 1995. ==Goals== The Christian Family Movement website has 6 recorded goals for their members to strive to accomplish: # to develop a consciousness (both a family and a social consciousness) based on Christian principles and examples; # to develop responsible, concerned and happy families that are part of a supportive and affirming network of families within every community who will individually and collectively reach out to others in need; # to offer opportunities for families to grow in their personal relationships with one another as well as with their friends, neighbors and co-workers; # to develop a caring society that not only recognizes, but actively supports family life; # to initiate and encourage research on the actual needs of Christian families; and # to continue to foster the international spirit of the Christian Family Movement. ==The Symbol== The CFM symbol shows the Holy Family in silhouette behind a modern family, with the text \\"Christian Family Movement - CFM\\". It depicts the family as an active agent of evangelization, participating in the mission of Jesus. With the model of the holy family to guide them, the CFM family is moving forth to bring the message and the love of Christ to a changing world. Father, mother, sons and daughters are Christian emissaries to the world. This symbol was adopted in 2012. Previously, the movement had a symbol made up of four different parts. They are the ancient signs for man, woman, and child joined together with the Christian symbol for Christ. The symbol is supposed to form a single unit that shows the most basic characteristics of the Christian Family. Christ – covering the top of the whole symbol is the symbol for Christ; this is the \\"Chi Rho\\", which is said to hold the family together and supposed to be the center of family life. Man – shown lifting his arms to God, it represents a strong tower, being the total embodiment of the head of the family. Woman – shown reaching toward the earth, which enhances her similarity to the earth in her ability to give birth. Child - the circle is a sign of life that shows the closeness of the power of man and woman to God's power of creation. ==The Catholic Family and Lay Ministry== During the early years of the movement (1948-1956), CFM received some criticism because it did not fall squarely under the clerical authority of the American bishops as a whole. In particular, Father Edgar Schmiedeler, director of the National Catholic Welfare Council (NCWC), which later became the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, also accused the lay movement of carrying out the ministerial work that he saw as the rightful work of the Family Life Bureau, which was under the direction of the NCWC. Still, CFM had the approval of Samuel Cardinal Stitch, of the Archdiocese of Chicago, the founding diocese of CFM. While CFM and the FLB had many of the same goals and was part of the same apostolate, Schmiedeler argued that the American Bishops had not given it official approval. In the days before the second Vatican Council, such approval was difficult to receive, in part because of differing views on jurisdictions; Kathryn Johnson notes that \\"the NCWC had been set up as an advisory conference\\" and that \\"bishops proved unwilling to tread on one another's individual diocesan decisions.Johnson, Kathryn. \\"' Stealing ' Movements: Conflict between CFM and the Family Life Bureau\\". Catholic Historical Review Vol 86. Issue 2.Apr 2000 229. 10 Nov 2008 In addition, this early conflict between CFM and the FLB was complicated by the larger changes and questions about the role of the laity in the Catholic Church, some of which were addressed during the Second Vatican Council. Individual groups would have priests serve as spiritual directors, for example, but these chaplains would struggle with how to balance the responsibility for overseeing the group's actions with a desire to allow the group to be driven by the initiative of its lay members. As one priest noted, \\"Clerical domination will bring [the movement] to a grinding halt.Johnson, Kathryn. \\"' Stealing ' Movements: Conflict between CFM and the Family Life Bureau\\". Catholic Historical Review Vol 86. Issue 2.Apr 2000 229. 12 AUG 2012 Later leaders of the NCWC and other church officials of the time, while still insisting that clear lines of authority should be maintained, admitted the grass-roots movement's benefits and felt that the conflicts between the FLB and lay movements, including CFM and the Cana Conference could have been handled better. Archbishop Patrick O'Brien, of the Archdiocese of Washington decided that the FLB could not take on CFM's active ministries, stating that it was \\"not equipped to go into the active field-- [it was] lacking the personnel of the right kind and the sufficient number.\\"Johnson, Kathryn. \\"' Stealing ' Movements: Conflict between CFM and the Family Life Bureau\\". Catholic Historical Review Vol 86. Issue 2.Apr 2000 229. 12 AUG 2012 Other groups like CFM, including the Young Christian Workers, the Grail Movement, and the Sister Formation Conference, prompted Catholics and the Church as a whole to reevaluate the way that the laity could play an active role in ministry: ==See also== * Teams of Our Lady, a similar European-founded Roman Catholic lay movement (French Equipes Notre Dame) active in 75 countries, recognized by the Holy See as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical right. * Couples for Christ, another international Catholic lay ecclesial movement founded in Asia (traces its origin to Manila, Philippines) whose goal is to renew and strengthen Christian values. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Johnson, Kathryn. \\"'An Effort was Made to Get Good Will': Changing Views on CFM\\".

The film stars Tom Hardy as Michael Peterson, known from 1987 as Charles Bronson. The film follows the life of this prisoner, considered Britain's most violent criminal, who has been responsible for a dozen or so cases of hostage taking while incarcerated. He was given the name Charles Bronson by his fight promoter, for his bare-knuckle fighting years. Born into a respectable middle-class family, Peterson became known as one of the United Kingdom's most dangerous prisoners. Because of his violence, Bronson was repeatedly put into isolation or solitary confinement, which may have contributed to his emotional problems. ==Plot== The film begins with scenes from Peterson's delinquent early life which he narrates with self-deprecating humour. Initially he addresses the camera dressed in prison garb; other times he tells his tale in a vaudeville-style theatre with a live audience. The film's story unfolds as a surreal narrative of connected vignettes punctuated by vaudeville interludes. He recounts episodes of crime and violence leading to his first prison sentence of seven years. At sentencing his mother hopes he will be out in four but his violence in prison extends his sentence beyond seven years. He is sent to a psychiatric hospital where he continues to rebel and is administered drugs which he claims make him physically weak. His first escape attempt is to walk sluggishly toward the exit, where he is waved back to a chair by a staffer. He decides to escape by earning a transfer back to prison and attempts to strangle another detainee but is apprehended before killing the man. He comments to the audience that despite all his prison time and solitary confinement, he has never killed anyone. In the vaudeville theatre he shows film footage of a rooftop protest during which he claims to have caused \\"tens of millions of pounds' damage\\". He credits this destruction with the government's decision to declare him \\"sane\\" and have him released. After a brief reunion with his parents he sets off to see his flamboyant Uncle Jack. He is welcomed and reintroduced to an old prison mate who promises to set him up as a bare- knuckle boxer and gives him the name Charles Bronson, after the American actor. Bronson enjoys the violence and showmanship of bare-knuckle boxing. Not content with his meagre winnings, he ups the stakes by fighting two opponents at once and even fights a dog. He proposes to a woman and steals a thousand- pound ring in the hope that she will marry him. She declines and after sixty- nine days of freedom Bronson is sent back to jail. He takes the prison librarian hostage and waits for reinforcements to arrive, alternately screaming at his hostage and peaceably enquiring after his family. When other guards arrive he strips naked and forces the librarian to assist in applying his \\"body armour\\" of petroleum jelly, to make him harder to grab in the imminent brawl. After being restrained he is warned by the prison governor that he will die inside if his behaviour does not improve. Encouraged by a prison art teacher who notices something special in his drawings, he becomes a model prisoner for a while, channelling his confusion and pain into vivid imagery of birds and grotesque creatures. When told the art studio will be closing Bronson attacks the teacher and holds him hostage. While prison officials wait outside he demands music be played. He paints his naked body black and ties the teacher to a post. He paints a moustache onto the teacher's face, forces an apple into his mouth and removes his hat and glasses to put on the teacher's head. After this human still-life has been arranged to his satisfaction, he accepts his fate, calling for the prison guards to burst in for yet another brawl, for which he will be sent back to solitary confinement. ==Cast== * Tom Hardy as Michael Gordon Peterson/Charles Bronson * Matt King as Paul Daniels, nightclub owner and former fellow prisoner * James Lance as Phil Danielson, prison art teacher * Amanda Burton as Charlie's mother * Kelly Adams as Irene Peterson, Charlie's wife * Juliet Oldfield as Alison, Charlie's lover * Jonathan Phillips as the Prison Governor * Mark Powley as Prison Officer Andy Love * Hugh Ross as Uncle Jack * Luing Andrews as Prison Officer * Joe Tucker as John White, fellow patient in Rampton * Gordon Brown as Screw, the first guard Bronson fights * Charlie Whyman as fellow patient in Rampton ==Production== Hardy and director Nicolas Winding Refn promoting Bronson in 2009 For the role, Hardy had telephone conversations with Charles Bronson, before meeting him. Bronson was so impressed by how Hardy had managed to build up his physique for the role and how good he was at imitating him, that he shaved off his trademark moustache for it to be used as a prop for Hardy to wear in the film.Morgan, Sion (6 Oct 2013). \\"Charles Bronson: 'I chopped off my moustache and sent it to actor Tom Hardy'\\". WalesOnline. Retrieved January 26, 2019. \\"I honestly believe nobody on the planet could play me as Tom did. He is more like me than I am\\", Bronson told The Times. Filming was done in and around the St. Ann's, Sherwood, Worksop and Welbeck Abbey areas of Nottingham in Nottinghamshire. In a late 2009 interview with Michael Slenske of Interview magazine, Tom Hardy discussed the fitness routine he had developed to get in shape to play Bronson, ==ReceptionBox office=== Bronson opened in a single cinema in North America and made $10,940. The film ended up earning $104,979 in the U.S with the widest release being in 10 cinemas. Internationally it made $2,155,733 for a total of $2,260,712. ===Critical response=== Upon release, Bronson received positive reviews, with many praising Hardy's performance, the film's writing and direction, as well as the humour and the action sequences, though it was criticised for its violence. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, gives the film an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 82 critics, with an average rating of 6.6 out of 10 with the consensus \\"Undeniably gripping, Bronson forces the viewer to make some hard decisions about where the line between art and exploitation lies.\\" Metacritic gives the film a \\"generally favourable\\" average score of 71 out of 100 based on 22 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and praised the decision not to attempt to rationalise and explain Bronson's behaviour, stating in his review: Bronson was not initially allowed to view the film, but had said that if his mother liked it, he was sure he would as well. According to Refn's DVD audio commentary, his mother said she loved it. On 15 November 2011, he was granted permission to view it. Describing it as \\"theatrical, creative, and brilliant\\", Bronson heaped praise upon Hardy, but disagreed on the implied distance between himself and his father; and the portrayal of Paul Edmunds, a former prisoner and nightclub owner (portrayed in the film by Matt King as 'Paul Daniels') as \\"a bit of a ponce\\". Bronson challenged his own family's reaction to the portrayal of his Uncle Jack, stating that he \\"loved\\" it, as would Jack himself. Bronson's trust in Hardy's acting grew such that once he had seen the film, he said, \\"If I were to die in jail then at least I live on through Britain's No 1 actor\\". Bronson had been originally displeased with the choice of Hardy as star, but during their first meeting in person, Hardy assured him that he would \\"fix it\\".\\"Tom Hardy: Becoming Bronson\\".

Boy Scouts of America was a high-profile case filed in 1997 before the Supreme Court of California to determine whether the Boy Scouts of America is a business establishment within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, § 51) and has the right to exclude girls from membership.DUI Defense Lawyers == Background == Katrina Yeaw attempted to join her twin brother Daniel's Boy Scout Troop No. 349 in the Golden Empire Council in her hometown of Rocklin, California. When she was rejected due to the fact she is female, she filed suit against the Boy Scouts of America, accusing them of discrimination. ==Case== In 1995, Katrina Yeaw brought action through James Yeaw, her father and guardian ad litem, against the Boy Scouts of America and the Golden Empire Council. She was represented by activist attorney Gloria Allred. Katrina alleged (as in the Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts of America, 17 Cal. 4th 670 and Randall v. Orange County Council, 17 Cal. 4th 736) that the BSA is a business establishment within the meaning of California's Civil Code section 51 and engaged in prohibited discrimination by excluding girls from membership. BSA moved to have the case dismissed but Allred sought a preliminary injunction stopping BSA from refusing to admit Katrina to membership in her brother's troop. In 1996, the case went to trial before Sacramento Superior Court Judge John Lewis. After hearing arguments, Judge Lewis denied the preliminary injunction. Judge Lewis noted in his ruling that Katrina was denied admission into a troop and therefore the troop is the appropriate entity upon which to focus in addressing plaintiffs arguments under the act. Relying principally on the California Supreme Court decision in Warfield (Warfield v. Peninsula Golf & Country Club (1995) 10 Cal. 4th 594), Judge Lewis found that a Scout troop is not a business establishment. Judge Lewis maintained that the BSA is a membership organization whose benefits derive primarily from the interpersonal associations among its members.BSA discrimination.org Allred appealed Judge Lewis' decision to the Third District Court of Appeal. In 1997, the Court of Appeal upheld Judge Lewis' decision. Finally, Allred appealed the decision to the California Supreme Court. In a brief order, the California Supreme Court announced that it would consider Katrina's appeal. However, the Court deferred hearing the appeal until a decision was reached in both the Curran and Randall cases, both of which were pending before the Court at the time.Ms Magazine In March 1998, the California Supreme Court ruled in the Curran and Randall cases that the Boy Scouts of America is not a business establishment, as defined in the Unruh Act, and can therefore set its own membership criteria. Katrina's lawsuit was in effect \\"finished\\" by the decision, according to Allred.LA Times 1998 A few months later, Katrina withdrew her appeal. However, she vowed to keep fighting, claiming: \\"I was born a girl, and no matter what else I do with my life, that’s what it all comes down to–being a girl.

Following Vinci's success, Metastasio's text was used by numerous composers of the baroque and classical eras for their own operas, including Pietro Torri (1736), Antonio Vivaldi (1737), Giovanni Battista Ferrandini (1753) and J.

It was organized by the European Table Tennis Union (ETTU) annually for men's and women's teams. It was first held in session 1960/61 for the men's competition, and the women's competition three years later. However, the competition was replaced by the present European Champions League for the men's and women's competition in session 2001/02 and 2005/06 respectively. ==Format== The competition was contested by the current national champion team of ETTU member associations of each season. In the 1960/61 season, the first competition for men was held and three years later there was also the women's competition. Since 1994/95, the \\"best of three\\" format was replaced, rather the new format that if a team won both the home and away match then it won the game. If each team won for a match, then a decision game would be played. Magazine \\"Deutscher Tischtennis Sport\\", 1998/9 S.22 In the session 1998/99, a new competition of different format, named \\"European Champions League\\", was held for the men's competition. The success of the Champions League called for the discontinuation of the Men's European Cup in 2001/02, after three years' co-existence, and ultimately replaced the women's competition as well in session 2005/06. ==Results== In the early years, the competitions were mostly dominated by the Eastern European teams, in the men's competition until the late 1970s, and in the ladies - especially by the Hungarian club Statisztika Budapest - by the end of the 1980s. This led to the promotion of table tennis in the Eastern Europe, where players had the best training facilities and good coaches available. Later on, Western European teams won more frequently, especially the German teams. This shift is owing to the growing professionalization in the sports and the sponsorship obtained in those countries, thus attracting some top foreign players playing for the Western European clubs. ===List of Winners of the Men's Competition=== ** 1961 - CSM Cluj ** 1962 - GSTK Zagreb ** 1963 - Vasetupitö Törekves ** 1964 - CSM Cluj ** 1965 - CSM Cluj ** 1966 - CSM Cluj ** 1967 - CSM Cluj ** 1968 - Slavia Prague ** 1969 - Slavia Prague ** 1970 - Spartacus Budapest ** 1971 - Spartacus Budapest ** 1972 - Ormesby TTC ** 1973 - GSTK Zagreb ** 1974 - GSTK Zagreb ** 1975 - Sparta Prague ** 1976 - GSTK Zagreb ** 1977 - Sparta Prague ** 1978 - Sparta Prague ** 1979 - Spartacus Budapest ** 1980 - Spartacus Budapest ** 1981 - Spartacus Budapest ** 1982 - Heinzelmann Reutlingen ** 1983 - Heinzelmann Reutlingen ** 1984 - Simex Jülich ** 1985 - AZS Gdansk ** 1986 - ATSV Saarbrücken ** 1987 - Zugbrücke Grenzau ** 1988 - Zugbrücke Grenzau ** 1989 - Borussia Düsseldorf ** 1990 - UTT Levallois ** 1991 - Borussia Düsseldorf ** 1992 - Borussia Düsseldorf ** 1993 - Borussia Düsseldorf ** 1994 - Sporting Villette Charleroi ** 1995 - UTT Levallois ** 1996 - Sporting Villette Charleroi ** 1997 - Borussia Düsseldorf ** 1998 - Borussia Düsseldorf ** 1999 - TTV Hornstein ** 2000 - Zugbrücke Grenzau ** 2001 - Večernji Zagreb ===List of Winners of the Women's Competition=== ** 1964 - Vointa Arad ** 1965 - Vointa Arad ** 1966 - DTC Kaiserberg ** 1967 - Progresul Bucharest ** 1968 - BSG Aussenhandel ** 1969 - BSG Aussenhandel ** 1970 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1971 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1972 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1973 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1974 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1975 - Sparte Prague ** 1976 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1977 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1978 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1979 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1980 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1981 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1982 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1983 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1984 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1985 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1986 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1987 - Avanti Hazersvoude ** 1988 - Spartak Vlasim ** 1989 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1990 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1991 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1992 - SPVG Steinhagen ** 1993 - SPVG Steinhagen ** 1994 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1995 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1996 - Statisztika Budapest ** 1997 - FC Langweid ** 1998 - Team Galaxis Lübeck ** 1999 - Statisztika Budapest ** 2000 - Statisztika Budapest ** 2001 - Statisztika Budapest ** 2002 - Henk ten Hoor DTK ** 2003 - FSV Kropach ** 2004 - Müllermilch Langweid ** 2005 - Müllermilch Langweid ==References== Category:Table tennis competitions Category:European international sports competitions ","title":"European Club Cup of Champions"},{"id":"20370481","text":"John Fawkner College (formerly Fawkner Secondary College) is a government- funded co-educational secondary day school, located in Fawkner, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. the school had approximately 400 students from Year 7 to Year 12.Fawkner Secondary College , school website, Accessed 12 August 2009 ==Overview== Opened in 1956, John Fawkner College is recognised for its innovative approaches to teaching and learning achieving recognition in 2009 for all of the previous year's VCE graduates successfully engaged in further education, training or work.

She is also a former member of the hip hop group Big Brovaz. She has been with both groups since they both started. Cherise released a solo album, Look Inside before the debut album Nu-Flow by Big Brovaz was released. It only spawned one single, \\"2nd Best\\", while the album won a MOBO award. ==History2002–2006: early career and Big Brovaz=== Cherise, and her friend Nadia, both began their career in the R&B; group Big Brovaz, who had considerable success following their launch in 2002. Cherise was an established singer before the group's success, recording the solo album Look Inside and single \\"2nd Best\\". The album was much praised and won a MOBO Award. After scoring top five hits with songs such as \\"Favourite Things\\" and \\"Nu Flow\\", Big Brovaz received rave reviews from fans and critics for their unique style, and received comparisons with other groups such as Outkast and solo artists such as Eminem, Nelly and Jamelia. After a lengthy hiatus following one member's drug addiction being revealed, Big Brovaz re-instated their career in 2004 with new single \\"Yours Fatally\\". Expectations were high following their previous string of top ten hits, although the single disappointingly stalled at number 15 in the UK Top 40 and third female member Dion left the band. Subsequently, the band were dropped by their record label. This resulted in a three-year gap before they finally released a second studio album. In April 2007, new album Re-Entry was released, although it was a commercial disaster and failed to chart. Booty Luv was created during early recordings of Big Brovaz' Re-Entry album when music executives offered Cherise and Nadia the chance to record and promote a new version of R&B;/soul singer Tweet's club hit \\"Boogie 2nite\\". Following the poor sales of early singles from Re-Entry in mid-2006, the girls accepted the offer and began recording their new version of the song, initially only as a promotional track for the record label Hed Kandi. Six months later in December, however, Booty Luv's version of \\"Boogie 2nite\\" was decided to be released as an actual single in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe following positive reviews from club DJs on the dance scene. It peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, behind Take That's comeback single, \\"Patience\\". ===2006–2009: Booty Luv=== In late 2006, the video for \\"Boogie 2nite\\" was sent to top music channels and the song was heavily promoted. The original dance remix by Seamus Haji was chosen for the song's download and physical releases, while the video was chosen to feature the remix by the group DB Boulevard. The song continued its success onto digital music video channels, holding Number one positions on The Hits Most Selected and TMF Hitlist UK. The song was released on download format a week before the physical release, and shot to Number 1 on the 3 Download Chart. This furthered its success into the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at Number 19 on download sales before climbing as high as Number 2 following its physical release. It also became their first Number 1 single in the UK Dance Charts. Spending 17 weeks inside the UK Top 75, the positive response for \\"Boogie 2nite\\" resulted in Booty Luv extending their contract with Hed Kandi to four follow up singles and an album. As of September 2009, the single re-entered the UK Dance Chart at number 31 following on from the popularity of the band's recent single \\"Say It\\", three years after its original release. In 2007, after taking several months to record their debut album, Booty Luv released the follow-up single \\"Shine\\", a cover of the Luther Vandross song on 14 May. It was well received by radio and added to the A-List on BBC Radio 1, peaking at Number 17 on the UK Airplay Chart. In its first week of release, \\"Shine\\" entered the UK Singles Chart at Number 25 on downloads alone, and became the group's second top ten single the following week when it jumped 15 places to Number 10 following its physical release, spending an eventual seven weeks inside the UK Top 40. It also managed to hit the top spot on the UK Dance Charts. Their debut album Boogie 2nite was released 17 September 2007, one week after third single \\"Don't Mess with My Man\\" (a cover of a Lucy Pearl song) made the UK Top 20 at Number 11, and the UK Dance Charts at Number 1, taking their number of UK Dance Number 1 singles to three. The album features the three hit singles \\"Boogie 2nite\\", \\"Shine\\" and \\"Don't Mess with My Man\\", a new cover as well as five original songs, including the final UK Top 20 hit from the album, \\"Some Kinda Rush\\". The album is co-written by Booty Luv and two co-writers. On 24 September 2007, Boogie 2nite entered the UK Albums Chart at a respectable Number 11 and just missed the top twenty the next week, falling to Number 26. It was officially certified as Silver by the BPI in late 2008, denoting 70,000+ copies sold. The fourth single to be released from the album was \\"Some Kinda Rush\\", the first original release by the group.\\"Booty Luv Interview\\", Digital Spy. URL last accessed 21 April 2008 On the week commencing 28 November 2007, the song had a surge in download sales solely from the album following the song's early promotion, when it entered the UK Top 100 at Number 93, four weeks before its official download release. It continued to hold inside the UK Top 100 before becoming Booty Luv's fourth consecutive UK Top 20 hit when it rose to Number 19 following its combined physical and download sales. On the week commencing 28 January 2008, the single outlasted \\"Don't Mess with My Man\\" in the UK Top 40 despite its lower peak, with \\"Some Kinda Rush\\" spending seven weeks on the chart, and \\"Don't Mess with My Man\\" spending only four. Their debut album Boogie 2nite also experienced a resurgence into the UK Top 100 following the success of \\"Some Kinda Rush\\". It re-entered the UK Top 100 Albums at Number 96, before climbing as high as 87. The album has so far spent four weeks inside the UK Top 100 following the release of \\"Some Kinda Rush\\", and eight weeks in total. In late 2007 iTunes offered fans the chance to download one of the original songs from the album - \\"Something To Talk About\\" free of cost, since it was the \\"Free Single of the Week\\". A fifth single from the album, \\"Dance Dance\\", was given a limited release across Europe in 2008, managing to achieve Top 5 success in the Netherlands' Dance Chart. It furthered this success onto the official Netherlands chart, peaking at number 27. The CD track listing included two new remixes and a megamix of the group's singles so far. Nadia and Cherise confirmed in an interview with Digital Spy in 2007 that they planned to begin work on their second album in 2008. They also mentioned that they were talking about future plans with Hed Kandi and did not want the next album to feature any cover versions, but for the new album to contain only original songs. In an interview with Digital Spy in July 2009, Nadia revealed that the band had been working with multiple producers, whereas with Boogie 2nite they only worked with one. It was thus revealed that the album had \\"an edgier style\\", as described by Shepherd. She also commented that \\"some tracks have a real R&B; vibe to them, others are proper dance tracks and some are typical poppier tracks. It's a really exciting mixture of sounds.\\" Bandmate Cherise also stated that they had been working with Fraser T. Smith, the producer behind Tinchy Stryder's number one hit \\"Number One\\". The track they worked on with him is apparently entitled \\"One Dance\\". The first single from the new album is titled \\"Say It\\", and was premiered on Friday 10 April 2009. The first performance of the single was at Sony Ericsson's Dance Nation Festival where the girls did a set. The musicality of the song differs slightly from the previous material released by the band, having more of an electro feel to it. The single was released on 31 August 2009, and was premiered on the official Hed Kandi website and the video sharing site YouTube. The single was Popjustice's \\"Single of the Day\\" on 10 April 2009. It was added to BBC Radio 1's B-List at the start of August, moving up to the much-coveted A-List during the successful week of release.

Recognition came to him with a home designed in 1937 for the Manor family in Orinda, California; one which was included as an example of modern architecture's effect on the contemporary ranch house in California in several post-war published compilations of residential works. ==Career== Mayhew took a job in San Francisco with well- known architect Arthur Brown Jr. sometime around 1922, working as a draftsman. Brown encouraged Mayhew to study at l'École des Beaux-Arts in Paris for two years; Mayhew finished in 1925. Returning to California, Mayhew obtained his architect degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1927. Mayhew was subsequently hired by Miller and Pflueger and worked with that firm for six years during a time when they were designing prominent skyscrapers and movie palaces as well as taking occasional commissions for residential dwellings. In 1934 or 1935, Mayhew formed his own firm: Clarence W.W. Mayhew, Architect. Mayhew's influential Manor House was designed in 1937 for Marjorie and Harold V. Manor. Manor was a San Francisco native who married Marjorie W. Arnold in 1908. He joined three different garden clubs including the California Horticultural Society.Archive.org. Texts.

The house that Mayhew designed for the Manors was basically a ranch house in structure, but light and airy with floor-to-ceiling windows and extensive skylights. It received notice across the country for its clean, light, asymmetrical lines and its embrace of both indoor and outdoor spaces. Its U-shaped plan enclosed a central lawn, and cost US$14,500 to build in 1938.ArchitectDB - structure record id 10810: Manor, Harold V., House, Monte Vista, Orinda, CA A series of publications made mention of the design—it appeared in House and Garden, Architect and Engineer,ArchitectDB - publication record id 7925: Recent Work of Clarence W.W.

Full text of Tomorrow's House (1945) by George Nelson and Henry Wright and If You Want to Build a House. In 1974, architectural historian David Gebhard wrote of the design: \\"...California’s ability to wed indoors and outdoors was beautifully captured in the solarium, with its glass roof, sliding glass walls, and the adjacent sliding glass walls of the living room. This house was a realization of flexible indoor/outdoor space, so often discussed by the exponents of modernism but never achieved in such a lyric fashion.\\" Mayhew was quoted in Architectural Forum in 1939 as saying that \\"the house has a Japanese character in both plan and elevation. Although I did not copy any Japanese details, I did copy the underlying principle.\\" Chermayeff designed a greater level of privacy on the street facing, saving expansive glass walls for the garden side Mayhew designed his own house in collaboration with Serge Chermayeff, associate architect and employee of Mayhew's during 1940-1941 when Chermayeff was also teaching at California School of Fine Arts. Chermayeff was brought in so that Mayhew would not have his own wife for a client. The house contrasted sharply with existing homes on Hampton Road, and appeared to be made of rectangular shapes descending the sloped property. The house divided into two functional groups, one for adults and one for children, with all living and sleeping rooms facing south. Glass walls were specified to allow maximum sunlight and viewing pleasure.ArchitectDB - structure record id 10242: Mayhew, Clarence W.W., House, Piedmont The two main structural units enclosed a private garden and were connected by a broad stairway enclosed against the weather, with the street side made of solid wood and the garden side fully glazed. The three children's rooms were separated with demountable hanging walls that could be changed to adapt to the family's needs. Author Alan Hess wrote in 2007 that the clean abstraction of the rectilinear blocks appeared to be based on Chermayeff's Bauhaus leanings but that the casual, site-specific interaction of garden, house and modernity showed the relaxation of California living apparent in Mayhew's prior work. A view of the outdoor terrace behind Mayhew's Alumni House at the University of California, Berkeley Mayhew designed two alumni houses for local colleges. The Reinhardt Alumnae House was completed in 1949 for Mills College, and the Alumni House was finished in 1953 for the University of California, Berkeley.

He served as \\"Father\\" at The Family and took part in the Bohemian Club's summer encampments at the Bohemian Grove where he directed the Lecture series for 20 years and was known as \\"Hap\\". He volunteered with the props and sets department in at least one Grove Play: Birds of Rhiannon (1930) and in 1969 he gave a Lakeside Talk. Mayhew was a board member of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and of the Talent Bank. He joined the St. Francis Yacht Club and the California Pioneers. Late in life, Mayhew developed Parkinson's disease. He and his wife Joan Virginia Rapp Mayhew moved to San Rafael together. Mayhew died there in 1994; Joan died in 2005 at age 91, survived by their daughter, Joan Mayhew Beales. ==Works== *1929 - Brat House, Friedman Residence, Woodside, California *1930-1931 - McGuire House Project, Wildwood Gardens, Piedmont, California *1935 - Edward G.

Part apologetics, part polemic, the book was composed when Zoroastrians endured a perilous status as a harassed and declining minority. Its author discusses several neighboring religions, hence it contains nascent elements of an academic discipline: comparative religion. This article includes a description and analysis of the text, and also briefly addresses its context and relevance, with respect to other religions and to the continuing traditions of Zoroastrianism. ==The Author== What little is known of the person Mardan-Farrukh (Martānfarrux-i Ohrmazddātān) comes to us through the pages of his book, written in Middle Iranian using the Pahlavi script. Its title Shkand-Gumanik Vichar has been rendered Analytical Treatise for the Dispelling of Doubts,R. C. Zaehner, DTZ (1961) at 194. or Decisive Solution for Doubts.Škand-gumanik Vičār: la solution décisive des doubtes per Jean de Menasce (1945). A published text, as translated into English, runs 135 pages.Sikand-gumanik Vigar in E. W. West, Pahlavi Texts, Part III (S.B.E., v.24), SGV at 117-251. West notes his division of the SGV text into 16 chapters (at 116). His annotated SGV contents is at x-xi; his SGV introduction at xxv-xxxvi.The Parsi Dastur Hoshang, along with West, published the SGV text in the Pazend script (1887). Edward G. Browne at I: 106n; E. W. West (SBE 24) at xxxvi.Shikand Gumani Vazar, excerpts in R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976), containing SGV chapter VIII entire as well as several short selections and various quotations from Mardan-Farrukh's book, translated by Zaehner.R. C. Zaehner, ZZD (1955, 1972) contains a short passage of SGV at 392-396, which is also found in S. H. Nasr and M. Aminrazavi at 59-61. The Muslim conquest of his native Persia was completed by 651 C.E.Alessandro Bausani at 111. Based on references made in his book to the then editions of other Zoroastrian works (e.g., the Dinkart), Mardan Farrukh has been dated to the 9th century. \\"[I]t is evident that he lived after the time of Roshan, son of Atur-frobag, son of Farukh-zad. ...Abalis, the Zandik, had a religious deputation with Atur- frobag, son of Farukh-zad, in the presence of the Kalifah Al-Mamun who reigned A.D. 813-833.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at xxvi-xxvii and at 120,n2. West also mentions that this Atur-frobag and an Aturpad son of Hemid had edited books of the Zoroastrian Dinkart. \\"[T]his Aturpad was a contemporary of Zad-sparam who was living in A.D. 881.\\" E. W. West (SBE 24) at xxvii. These other authors are referenced from time to time in the Shkand Gumanik Vichar, e.g., E. W. West (SBE 24) at 138-139 (SGV chapter IV: sections 106-108), and at 169-170 (SGV chapter X: sections 50-57). Near the beginning of his book he states, \\"[T]his composition is provided by me, who am Mardan-farukh son of Auharmazd-dad.\\" He goes on to say, \\"I have been fervent-mindedly, at all times in my whole youthful career, an enquirer and investigator of the truth.\\" He declares, \\"The possession of the truth is the one power of the faithful, through the singleness of truth.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 120 (SGV chapter I: sections 35, 36, 33). > \\"Now, as I have said above, I have always been earnestly anxious to know God > and have been curious in searching out his religion and his will. In this > spirit of inquiry I have traveled to foreign countries and (even) to > India... for I did not choose my religion simply because I inherited it, but > I wanted (only that religion) which was most firmly based on reason and > evidence... .\\"R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 52-53, quoting from SGV > chapter X: sections 43-46.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 168-169 (re SGV X: 43-46). Apparently Mardan-Farrukh the author was young, earnest, well-traveled and committed. He was ably acquainted with his own religion, both its writings and the views of its authorities; also he was conversant with other systems of belief. Among Zoroastrian authors of the Pahlavi period, Mardan-Farrux can best lay \\"claim to being considered a philosopher.\\"R. C. Zaehner, ZZD (1955, 1972) at 107. A practicing layman who drew on priestly Zoroastrian books in the Pahlavi, his work \\"is distinguished by its clarity of thought and orderly arrangement.\\"Mary Boyce, ZACV (1992) at 153. It creates a \\"rationalist and philosophic climate.\\"R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 67.Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Medhi Aminrazavi at 5. ==His Book== The Shkand-gumanig Vizar of Mardan- Farrukh was written during an \\"intellectual renaissance of Zoroastrianism\\" which occurred \\"shortly before the rapid decline of Zoroastrianism, migrations to India, and conversions to Islam.\\"Richard N. Frye (1963) at 239. Several reasons may account for its occurrence: > \\"First, the times not only permitted but provoked such writings. > Mu'tazilites, or Islamic free-thinkers, many of whom were Persians, had > created an atmosphere of free debate and interest in philosophical and > theological questions. ... Second, the Zoroastrians were losing ground and > they passed from a militant defiance of Islam or the Arabs to an > intellectual defensive. This may be seen in a number of apologetic works > written at this time such as the Shkand Gumanik Vicar... .Third, was current > (ninth and early tenth century) Zoroastrian need for \\"written treatises\\" > whereas before reliance had been placed on \\"oral transmission\\". Richard N. > Frye (1963) at 239. In the first half of his book, Mardan-Farrukh provides his version of the prevailing Zoroastrian response to issues of theodicy (chapters 1-4 and 7-10). As he sees it, the acute moral quandary is how and why a wise and powerful God would create a world that seemingly has turned out so imperfect, which can at times appear merciless and cruel to creatures living in it.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 185 (SGV XI: 146). He outlines what might be called a dualist ethical metaphysics and a cosmology. In his remaining pages, the author discusses critically other neighboring religions. He addresses (chapters 11 and 12) the doctrines of the Qur'an, and later those of the Bible, both the Hebrew scriptures (chapters 13 and 14), as well as the Gospels (chapter 15). Earlier materialists (atheists or sophists) had been discussed and dismissed (chapters 5 and 6). He concludes with an adverse review of the brand of dualist theology particular to the Manichees (chapter 16).Jean de Menasce, O.P. (1975) at 561-563. The chapter descriptions given are porous, e.g., the translator West thought it appropriate to footnote six times to the Hebrew and Greek Bible on a page (179) within a chapter (XI) assigned to Islam. In a limited sense his work might be described as a nascent, adumbrated forerunner of comparative religion studies with the understanding, of course, that it is rendered from the view point of a 9th-century Zoroastrian.Mary Boyce, ZRBP (1979, 1985) at 155: The author relates that preparatory to writing his book he \\"set out to compare the teachings of Zoroastrianism with those of other faiths... .\\"Cf. H. W. Bailey at 79 et seq., who notes the cosmopolitan environment of Zoroastrians of that era, whose own writings display the influence of Indian culture, of Greek philosophy, and of Syrian Christianity. Bailey notes the recent arrival of Islam, which had displaced the Sasanid Empire. To the east their linguistic cousins in Bactria widely followed Buddhism. Not to mention, there were strong reciprocal influences of the Zoroastrians on their neighbors. R. C. Zaehner gives this description of Mardan-Farrukh's Shkand- Gumänïg Vichär: > This is in some ways the most interesting of all the Zoroastrian books since > it presents a philosophical justification of Zoroastrian dualism in a more > or less coherent form; and it further contains a detailed critique of the > monotheistic creeds, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity as well as an attack > on Zoroastrianism's dualistic rival, Manichaeanism.\\" The Škand-gumanik Vičār was translated first into Sanskrit c. 1100, for the benefit of the Parsis (the Zoroastrians of India).Mary Boyce, ZRBP (1979, 1985) at 168-169. Neryosang Dhaval (fl. 1100) also transcribed the Middle Persian language of the SGV text from its Pahlavi script into the more accessible Avestan script (when so employed it is termed Pazand). In 1887 a new Pazand edition of the SGV was published by West and Hoshang (see above, note 3).Cf., Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla, discussion at 4-6. He dates the Sanskrit version of SGV to the 13th century. Modernly, the book has been translated into several European languages.See the Bibliography, e.g., Jean de Menascy (1945), and E. W. West (S.B.E., v. 24). ==The textGood vs evil=== Regarding issues of theodicy Mardan-Farrukh provides a summary of Zoroastrian doctrine. This view presents Ohrmazd, the Creator of the world, being opposed by and contested by the satanic Ahriman. The author justifies this belief by pointing to the universal presence of good vis-à-vis bad everywhere in the world, e.g., \\"darkness and light, knowledge and ignorance, perfume and stench, life and death, sickness and health, justice and disorder, slavery and freedom... visible in every country and land at all times.\\" These distinct opposites are not of function, like that of the male and female, sun and moon, but rather are of the essence. \\"For where there is good there cannot possibly be evil. Where light is admitted darkness is driven away.\\" Thus the antagonistic pairing prevalent everywhere springs from the opposing natures of Ohrmazd and Ahriman. \\"The material world is the effect of the spiritual, and the spiritual is its cause.\\"R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 59, 60 (SGV VIII: 4-11, 16-19, 20-21, 24 et seq.)Cf., E. W. West (SBE 24) at 124 (SGV III: 1-2), and 152-153 (re SGV VIII). Accordingly, the wise and powerful Ohrmazd is not the maker of the evil that blights creation.E.g., E. W. West (SBE 24) at 128, 133-134 (SGV IV: 11, 60-61).Cf., Mary Boyce, ZRBP (1979, 1985) at 25: Ahriman \\"broke in violently\\" to Creation \\"marring its perfection.\\" He turned Waters salt; attacking Earth he caused the deserts. He withered the Plant, and slew the Bull and the first Man. Reaching Fire he \\"sullied it with smoke, so that he had physically blighted all the good creation.\\"Cf., E. W. West (SBE 5) at 15-20 (Bundahis at Chapter 3: attack on creation by Ahriman and his demons). \\"There is one dogma on which [Mardan-Farrukh] firmly takes his stand: God is good.\\"R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 55.Cf., Mary Boyce, ZRBP (1979) at 9, and 19-20, regarding perhaps the original ethical nature of Ohrmazd. Rather the Zoroastrians teach that it is his antagonist Ahriman who has corrupted the creation.Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla at 259-260.J. Darmesteter at 4-10 (Vendidad, Fargard I). The late Zoroastrian Dastur, Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla, writes: > \\"The author of the Shikand Gumanik Vijar, who is himself a dualist of the > most pronounced kind, strongly urges in his polemics against other religions > that good and evil can on no account have originated from one and the same > source. Evil is considered to have as independent and complete existence as > good; they are both primeval. They are so entirely separate from each other > that neither good originates from evil, nor evil from good. Each one of them > exists by itself, and entertains perpetual antagonism towards the > other.\\"Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla at 384. Mardan-Farrukh observes that if Ohrmazd and Ahriman had created the world together or in cooperation, then Ohrmazd would be \\"an accomplice and confederate with Ahriman in the harm and evil which ever arise.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 128 (SGV IV: 6).The author further develops the theme of the complete separation of good and evil, i.e., of Ohrmazd and Ahriman. He employs various philosophical analyses, including \\"the impossibility of any existent thing being infinite, the nature of infinity, the relationship between epistemology, essence, and quality, and the immutability of substance.\\" Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Mehdi Aminrazavi at 5. Prior to creation Ohrmazd exists \\"fully complete in his own self\\", such that \\"his perfection consists in his having no need for any advantage or increase\\" from the outside. Hence when he created the world it was not to obtain \\"any advantage or aggrandizement\\". Yet Ohrmazd being \\"wise and sagacious\\" his actions \\"cannot be irrational or unmotivated\\". \\"We must conclude,\\" continues Mardan-Farrukh, \\"that the reason and occasion\\" for the creation of the world was \\"to repel and ward off\\" his external adversary Ahriman and defeat the evil he intends; \\"this is the whole reason and occasion for the act of creation.\\"R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 61-62 (SGV VIII: 49, 48, 50-51).E. W. West (SBE 24) at 154 (re SGV VIII).Cf., Mary Boyce, ZACV (1992) at 73. Ohrmazd's strategy is that the good creation will act as a trap to capture Ahriman and neutralize his evil. Ahriman being aggressive, rash and ignorant (he \\"does not know the final outcome\\"), as against the thoughtful and prudent Ohrmazd, certainly the ultimate result will be the triumph of good; undoubtedly creation will be restored.R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 49-51 (SGV IV: 63-80), and at 61, 63-64 (SGV VIII: 46-47, & 71-72, 76-80).E. W. West (SBE 24) at 134-136 (re SGV IV), and at 155, 157-158 (re SGV VIII). The entire cosmic process from the original creation by Ohrmazd and the attack by Ahriman, until the triumphant rehabilitation of physical goodness of creation, lasts twelve thousand years. Along with the Amesha Spenta, humankind plays a vital rôle in the defeat of Druj (the Lie) and victory of Asha (the Truth).Mary Boyce, ZRBP (1979) at 26.R. C. Zaehner, DTZ (1961) at 310-321 (plan of Ohrmazd), 250 (12,000 years), 147 (humanity's rôle), 36 (Asha and Druj). Mardan-Farrukh notes, \\"The duty of the creature is to understand and perform the will of the creator, and to abstain from what is disliked by him.\\" To do so \\"is to preserve the soul.\\" The will of the creator is known through his religion. From its care \\"for the soul are manifested [its] grandeur\\" and value, and \\"the compassion and [mercy] of the sacred being.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 166 (SGV X: 17-18, 19, 20, 24, 23).Cf., Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla at 354-356. ===Method=== The author at the start announces his intention to find the truth, which brings an \\"inward dignity\\". Yet by the \\"thorough understanding of the truth\\" he means the \\"blessedness and truth of the good religion\\" first taught by Zarathustra. The author does follow up on this quest later in his book. At one point Mardan-Farrukh describes several specific approaches to discovering the true (the matter at issue being the existence of the \\"exalted sacred being\\"). \\"[A] knowledge of anything is acquired in three modes: by knowing what is inevitable, or by knowing what is analogous, or by what is possible and fit to exist.\\" Later he adds the obvious: the direct tangibility of nature.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 121 (SGV I: 39) re truth leading to dignity and the true religion. The three approaches to knowledge listed: at 140 (SGV V: 10-11). Tangibility also: at 142 (SGV V: 46), and at 163, 164 (SGV IX: 5-6, 18). Emphasis added. An example of inevitable knowledge is \\"once one is one, and twice two is four\\" and within the inevitable it is not possible to say that sometime or someplace twice two will be five or three. Knowledge by analogy announces something invisible derived from the visible through similarity or resemblance, e.g., from the presence of a thing made one may infer the absent maker. Information about what is possible and fit to exist seems to rely on the trustworthiness and good character of the person testifying.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 140-142 (SGV V: 12-14, 15-30, 31-35). A variety of the inevitable (elimination of the impossible) is described at 142 (SGV V: 36-40). Miscellaneous falsehoods (e.g., \\"an existing thing which is not temporary and localized\\") are mentioned at 142 (SGV V: 41-45). This attention to methods (logic, analogy and inference, testimony, and tangible evidence) demonstrates some respectful rigor and craft in persuasion.\\"[T]he Denkart and the Sikand [appear] thoroughly permeated with Aristotelian thought.\\" R. C. Zaehner, ZZD (1955, 1972) at viii. Yet the Zoroastrian Denkart claims wisdom itself over the subtlety of Byzantine philosophers and the learned of India. Ibid. at 252. ===Sophistry=== Mardan-Farrukh addresses \\"the assertors of the non-existence of a sacred being\\" or the atheists.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 146 (SGV VI: 1). Here at note 4, the translator Neryosang (fl. 1100) is said to call the atheists dahari [Sanskrit \\"digambara\\"] which signifies Buddhist ascetics, whom West calls \\"the nearest approach to atheists with which Neryosang was acquainted.\\" Earlier at 139 (SGV chapter V: 1) \\"assertors of the non-existence of a sacred being\\" were mentioned, but chapter V proceeds to describe methods of proof and does not further discuss such atheists. Some atheists are said to believe \\"that there is no reward for good works, no punishment of sin, no heaven and hell, and no stimulator of good works and crime. Besides this, that things are only worldly, and there is no spirit.\\" Mardan-Farrukh responds \\"that to be made without a maker... is as impossible as to prepare what is written without a writer.\\" As to \\"that there is no recompense of good works and punishment of crime\\" he responds that \\"no one whatever is seen that has come... from death back to life, and it is not possible to say so.\\" Further, Mardan-Farrukh invokes what he calls in humankind \\"the manifestation of the maintenance of a hope for a supreme inspection over mankind, and indeed, over wild animals, birds, ad quadrupeds.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 146-147 (SGV VI: 7-8, 9-10), and at 148-149 (SGV VI: 27, 25, 34). The sophist may argue that no distinctions can be made, as honey is sweet, but \\"bitter to those abounding in bile\\" or that bread is both pleasant \\"to the hungry and unpleasant to the surfeited.\\" Yet the wise say, 'Even this statement of you sophists, about the jaundiced nature of everything, is alike jaundiced, and there is no truth in it.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 149-150 (SGV VI: 38-41, 45). ===Islam=== As Muslim regimes ruled in the Iran of Mardan-Farrukh, he did not mention Islam by name in his critique.Mary Boyce, ZRBP (1979, 1985) at 146. An unpleasant rule of victor over vanquished is presented.Alessandro Bausani at 111-112, who offers a mixed picture of a sometimes very harsh conquest, followed by a generally peaceful transition (which after a run of several centuries resulted in a Muslim majority in Iran). Bausani points out that the Qur'an itself was influenced in some particulars by Iran; he discusses unexpected similarities between Islam and Zoroastrianism. Bausani at 114-121.Not all Muslims, however, were hostile to Zoroastrianism, e.g., the exemplary humanist Al-Masudi (c.896-956). Ahmad M H Shboul, Al-Mas'ūdī and his world. A muslim humanist and his interest in non-muslims (London: Ithaca Press 1979), re Zoroastrians at 5, 112, 288. Zoroastrians lived under increasing pressure at the time Mardan- Farrukh was writing: > \\"[L]ate in the ninth century the tide began to ebb swiftly for the > Zoroastrians, with Islam now enjoying the full support of temporal power > everywhere. It was then that the founding fathers of the Parsi community > left their homeland to seek religious freedom in exile in India, and > thereafter those who held by their ancient faith in Iran were steadily > ground down into the position of a small, deprived, and harassed minority, > lacking all privileges or consideration.\\"Mary Boyce, PSZ (1977) at 1. As would be expected given his prior chapters on theodicy, he faults the type of monotheism practiced by Islam because it posits an all-powerful Deity who creates the world and apparently the evil in it, so that (as he puts it) \\"good works and crime, truth and falsehood, life and death, good and evil are owing to him.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 173 (SGV XI: 5). Mardan-Farrukh alludes to passages in the Qur'an where it seems to say that the Deity may lead people astray.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 194 (SGV XI: 271). In a footnote (no. 1 at 194) West cites two possible passages from the Qur'an that are at least similar to the gist of this Zoroastrian author of late antiquity: VI (\\"Cattle\\"), 39; and XIV (\\"Abraham\\"), 32, 34.M. M. Ali, at 329-333, comments that such Quranic passages would be based on \\"a very great misinterpretation\\", if said to regard a supposed al-Mudzill (the One who leads astray). On the contrary, Ali continues, if read in context it becomes plain that Allah only leads astray those who already have committed transgressions. Relentlessly from different points of view and using various illustrations, Mardan-Farrukh asks why the sacred being, with Divine wisdom and concern for the happiness of humankind, would have chosen freely to create the world as it is, a dangerous and contentious realm where evil exists and people suffer. That is, if \\"no opponent or adversary of his existed\\" then by reason the sacred being would be the only party responsible for the calamities endured by humankind.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 180-181 (SGV XI 91-92). Humans \\"with little knowledge and little wisdom... so far as they are able, do not let the lion and the wolf and other noxious creatures in among their own young ones... .\\" Yet then, \\"why has the merciful sacred being now let... the demons in upon his own... ?\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 182-183 (SGV XI: 111-113). When he placed Adam in paradise, \\"why was not that garden made by him fortified and strong, so that that deluder [Satan] could not have gotten into it?\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 180 (SGV XI: 79), and per 178-179 (XI: 61-67). Satan (Ahriman) not only lures the first man and woman to eat the forbidden fruit, but (according to Mardan-Farrukh) beforehand Satan (Ahriman) prepared this occasion of sin by corrupting their natural appetite with greed. Ibid. at 179 (XI: 68). ===Judaism=== Mardan- Farrukh likewise brings his criticism of a type of monotheism to the Jewish texts.Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla at 327-328, on the Jews in Iran from the 6th century B.C.E. to the 9th century C.E. Here, he challenges the creation story of the Bible. Of creation out of nothing in six days, he asks: if God needed only to command and it arises, \\"to what was that delay of six days owing? ...the existence of that delay of six days is very ill-seeming.\\" Accordingly, because of the use of time, \\"it is not fitting to speak of his producing [the world] from nothing.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 216 (SGV XIII: 94-99). Our author also notices the puzzle that the sun (the measure of days) was not created until the fourth day. Ibid. at 216 (SGV XIII: 100-101).The doctrine of creation ex nihilo (from nothing) may not belong to Biblical understanding before the second century B.C.E. Cf. James Hope Moulton at 291-292. Continuing along these lines, Mardan-Farrukh says of the Biblical God, \\"It is manifest that he was not light,\\" by inference from God's reaction to light following his creation of it. Mardan-Farrukh paraphrases from the Jewish Torah,Cf. Genesis 1:2, \\"And God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good.\\" and concludes that regarding light God \\"considered it for the reason that he had not seen it before.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 213 (SGV XIII: 51-53). Not stated here is that the Zoroastrian creator God, Ohrmazd, is essentially associated with light.R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 34-35 (Bundahishn I: 1). This celebrated text begins: \\"Thus it is revealed in the Good Religion. Ohrmazd was on high in omniscience and goodness: for infinite time he was ever in the light. The light is the place and space of Ohrmazd: some call it the Endless Light.\\"E. W. West (SBE 5) at 3-4 (Bundahis, chapter I: 2).Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla at 156. \\"Ahura Mazda [Ohrmazd] is synonymous with light.\\" Although transcending nature, \\"among objects of sense the Zoroastrian godhead most of all resembles the light.\\" A narration in some detail he gives of the story of Adam and Eve in the garden and their expulsion from it.Elsewhere he mentions Moses (Mûshâê) and Abraham. E. W. West (SBE 24) at 208, 225 (SGV XIII: 3; XIV: 40). Mardan-Farrukh notes that God made Adam and Eve and thus made their inclinations, and that God commanded them not to eat of a certain tree, yet nonetheless they disobeyed. For this reason, he observes of the Biblical God that his \\"will and command are inconsistent and unadapted, one to the other.\\" Hence the Biblical God is \\"manifestly an opponent and adversary to his own will.\\" Therefore, \\"to indulge in wrath about [Adam and Eve] is unreasonable.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 209-212 (SGV XIII: 15-45), at 218 (SGV XIII: 14-18), at 217 (SGV XIII: 108-109). Mardan-Farrukh also finds fault with this story in that the curse of God on Adam affects everyone, \\"reaches unlawfully over people of every kind at various periods.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 220-221 (SGV XIII: 148-149). In this vein, he states about the Biblical God, \\"This is what he says about his own nature, that is, 'I am the Lord, seeking vengeance, and retaliating vengeance, and I retaliate vengeance sevenfold upon the children, and one does not forget my original vengeance.'\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 221 (SGV XIV 1-8). Although not himself locating a matching Biblical passage, West in footnotes refers variously to Deuteronomy 32: 35; Romans 12: 19; Genesis 4: 15; also Isaiah 30: 27, 28, 30. In unspoken contrast would be the Zoroastrian Ohrmazd, \\"a wise Being whose actions were held to be wholly just and accessible to reason.\\"Mary Boyce, ZRBP (1979, 1985) at 149. ===Christianity=== Mardan-Farrukh himself notes that his unfavorable remarks on the type of monotheism held by Judaism and by Islam would apply as well to Christianity.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 229 (SGV XV: 2-3). Christians in the SGV are referred to as Tarsâk [God-fearers] (SGV XV: 1). During the prior Sasanid era (224–651), \\"non-Zoroastrians frequently occasioned heated polemics in which virulent criticism and derisive terms were exchanged between the Zoroastrian priests on the one side and the prelates of the rival faith on the other.\\" In the case of Christianity, contention was not only religious, but military. \\"There was a state of perennial war between Sasanian Persia and Byzantine Rome, which had embraced Christianity.\\"Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla at 326, per both Jews and Christians regarding the \\"heated polemics\\"; at 328, per the then \\"perennial war\\" between Mazdean and Christian. A prime instance would be the border region of Armenia, which had included Zoroastrian believers since the Persian Achaemenid Empire (c. 550-330);Cf. James R. Russell, Zoroastrianism in Armenia (Harvard University 1988). centuries later despite Sasanid pressure, Armenia converted to Christianity (after 300) and took the Byzantine side.M. Chahin, The Kingdom of Armenia (London: Croom, Helm 1987; reprint Dorset, New York 1991) at 252, 253, 255-256. In general Zoroastrian arguments contra Christianity first developed in the strong and prosperous Sasanid Empire; however, following several centuries under Islam, Zoroastrian fortunes had declined drastically.Richard N. Frye (1963) at 233, 238-241. Mardan-Farrukh first questions the virgin birth, concluding skeptically \\"the origin of their religion has all come forth from the testimony of a woman, which was given about her own condition.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 230 (SGV XV: 17). \\"Who apart from that woman saw the angel Gabriel? And on what account is it expedient to consider that woman truthful?\\" (SGV XV: 9). He demonstrates a studied knowledge of the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation, although the premise of God taking the status of human being evokes no response, other than to call it \\"very strange\\".E. W. West (SBE 24) at 231-232 (SGV XV: 25-36, 31-32). \\"Now there are some even who say that the Messiah is the sacred being himself. Now this is very strange, when the mighty sacred being... became of human nature and went into the womb of a woman... .\\" About the crucifixion (\\"death and execution on a tree\\") and its \\"resurrection\\" message for humankind,Mardan- Farrukh seems to mistake the Christian doctrine of the redemptive power of the crucifixion, but instead he identifies it as a sign of resurrection. E. W. West (SBE 24) at 232-233 (SGV XV: 40-42).Zoroastrians believe in a final Resurrection of the body for humankind, when Ahriman becomes totally defeated by the wise lord Ohrmazd. R. C. Zaehner (1956, 1976) at 139-140. its 'brutality' and its \\"disgrace\\" offend Mardan-Farrukh. He questions why, from all the possible ways there are to signal human resurrection, God would want to choose to suffer such a death, if God is indeed omnipotent. If so, he asks why God did not make it \\"without doubt\\" and \\"clear knowledge\\" to humankind? Mardan-Farrukh continues, asking rhetorically if God chose such a death \\"through the will of his enemies\\" why does he curse them? Should they not be rewarded?E. W. West (SBE 24) at 232-233 (SGV XV: 40-45). Regarding the cursing (SGV XV: 44-45), West footnotes Matthew xxiii, 29, 34, \\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! ... behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify.\\" At the crucifixion Jesus had said, \\"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\\" Luke xxiii, 34. Mardan-Farrukh next challenges the doctrine of the Trinity, \\"the father and son and pure wind\\". Yet he begins without finesse: \\"If it be proper for three to be one, that implies that it is certainly possible for three to be nine... .\\" He questions how a son could be equal to the father; then he discusses the trinity and the crucifixion. After a theodicean analysis similar to his about Adam and Eve (see the Judaic section above), Mardan-Farrukh observes that \\"the sacred being himself created the executioners of his son,\\" and concludes that these enemies then slew \\"the Messiah, who is the son, through the will of the father.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 233-236 (SGV XV: 46-76, 46, 49, 51, 64, 76). The author's interpretation here resembles aspects of the Christian heresy fostered by the 2nd century gnostic Marcion.\\"According to Marcion, Christianity is essentially a Gospel of Love, not of Law. ... Marcion rejected the Old Testament, which he saw as revelation of a cruel Demiurge, wholly different from the God of Jesus. ... [Marcion] attributed the Crucifixion to the God of the Old Testament.\\" Marcion's teaching were firmly rejected. S. G. F. Brandon, editor, Dictionary of Comparative Religion (New York: Scribners 1970) at 427. \\"By end of 3rd century most Marcionite communities were absorbed into Manichaeism.\\" Manichees originated in the Persian Sasanid Empire.Geo Widengren at 11, comments that Marcion \\"grew up in a strongly Iranianized atmosphere.\\" From a Zoroastrian perspective one can see a dualism inherent in some of Marcion's doctrines about Christianity.For further indication of Marcion's teachings in Mardan-Farrukh's book, cf. E. W. West (SBE 24) at 242-243 (SGV XV: 152-154), where at his conclusion Mardan- Farrukh makes the claim that the Messiah dissipated the laws of Moses. Mardan- Farrukh's analysis of free will in Christianity likewise (absent Ahriman) results in his ascribing to God responsibility for sins committed by humankind.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 236 (SGV XV: 77-83). Next he discusses St. Paul (Pâvarôs), quoting him thus, \\"Not the good works which I desire, but the iniquity which I do not desire, I do. And it is not I that do so, but that which is collected within me does it, because I always see that it is striving with me day and night.\\" Mardan-Farrukh may well have associated St. Paul's feeling of an iniquity \\"within me\\" to Ahriman, for in the first half of the Shkand-Gumanik Vichar he states (as a proof of the existence of metaphysical evil), \\"[A] knowledge of the existence of an opponent of the creatures [i.e., Ahriman] is obtainable from the innermost recesses of the body of man... \\" which may be observed.E. W. West (SBE 24): St. Paul at 237 (SGV XV: 91, 93-96). For the Christian text per Mardan-Farrukh's quotation of St. Paul, West footnotes Romans vii, 19, 20, 23. For the \\"innermost recesses of the body\\", E. W. West (SBE 24) at 163 (SGV IX: 5-8) His critique of Christianity concludes with illustrations that seek to demonstrate a dualism partially embedded in Christian scriptures, or as he says, \\"The word of the Messiah is specially inconsistently a demonstrator as regards the two original evolutions\\" [of Ohrmazd and of Ahriman]. \\"[T]hey say, from the words of the Messiah, that the original evolution from the sacred being is light and goodness; evil and darkness are separate from him.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 238 (SGV XV: 108), and at 237-238 (SGV XV: 97-98). West footnotes 1st John i, 5, which states: \\"God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.\\" Mardan-Farrukh quotes the Messiah, speaking to his human opponents: > \\"I am appointed by that sacred being doing good works. Why do you not hear > those words of mine? Only because you are from the iniquitous one it is not > possible for you to hear them, and you wish to do the will of your own > father. By him truth is not spoken; whatever he speaks he tells a lie of it, > therefore you are false yourselves together with your father. As for me, who > speak the truth, you do not believe it of me. And he who is from the sacred > being hears the words of the sacred being, but you, because you are not from > the sacred being, do not hear my words.\\" Mardan-Farrukh immediately adds, \\"By these sayings it is demonstrated by him that there are two original evolutions\\" [of Ohrmazd and of Ahriman], one which produces the Messiah, and one producing his opponents.E. W. West (SBE 24) at 240 (SGV XV: 124-130). West footnotes John viii, 42-47.The author of SGV seems to refrain from naming Jesus of Nazareth, preferring to write \\"the Messiah\\". Next the parable of the tree that bears good fruit is given: \\"[F]or every tree becomes manifest by its fruit, if it be of merit and if it be of offensiveness.\\" Again he quotes the Messiah: \\"[E]very tree which the father has not sown should be dug up, and should be cast into the fire.\\" Mardan- Farrukh concludes, \\"Wherefore it is fitting to understand from these words that there is a tree, which the father has not sown; that it is necessary to dig up and cast away.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 241 (SGV XV: 134), and at 242 (SGV XV: 144-145). West footnotes Matthew vii, 17, 18, and Luke vi, 44. Apparently our author is indicating an analogy to the cosmic contention between good and evil of Zoroastrian teaching, so that here Ohrmazd will surely dig up and cast away trees sown by Ahriman. Finally, Mardan-Farrukh quotes the Messiah: \\"Our father, that art in the sky, let thy empire arise! And may it be thy will that shall take place on earth as in the sky! Also give us daily bread! And do not bring us to a cause of doubt!\\" He then continues: \\"From these words it is evident that his will is not so unalloyed on earth as in the sky. Also this, that the cause of doubt of mankind is not owing to the sacred being.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 242 (SGV XV: 148-151). West footnotes Matthew vi, 9-11, 13. So does the author work to appropriate to the Zoroastrian dualist view the words of the Christian Messiah, i.e., that Ahriman has corrupted the earth and injected doubt into mankind. ===Manichees=== E. W. West (SBE 24) at 243 (SGV XVI). ==Perspectives== {WORK IN PROCESS} ===Dualism=== E. W. West ===Free Will=== Farhang Mehr ===Tawhid=== Similar issues were addressed by the Muslim writer Maulana Muhammad Ali (1874–1951). He rejects as misinformed what he terms a popular idea that the Deity in Islam is maker of both good and evil. This false notion he traces to a long-ago \\"clash of Islam with Persian religious thought.\\" Ali continues: > \\"The doctrine that there are two creators, a creator of good and a creator > of evil, had become the central doctrine of the Magian religion [another > name for Zoroastrianism]... .

Ali > adds: \\"The same act may be a virtue on one occasion and evil on another. A > blow struck in self-defence... . ... The Holy Qur'an, therefore, has not > dealt with the question of the creation of good and evil at all.\\" M. M. Ali > at 318, 319. Here, Ali does not refer to the Shkand-gumanig Vizar of Mardan- > Farrukh, or to any other Zoroastrian (or \\"Magian\\") source.Bausani at 113, > comments peripherally on this \\"clash of Islam with Persian religious > thought\\": > >> \\"On the Muslim side, these criticisms... disputes between Mazdeans and Muslims, especially at the court of the tolerant Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun... were answered with alicrity by the Mu'tazilites--the promoters, in Islam, of a dialectical dogmatic theology (kalam, i.e., 'speech'). The 'dualist' danger was strongly felt by these early theologians though it is not clear what they effectively meant by dualism (thanawiya, zandaqa) and we have sufficient data to believe that they often confused Mazdaism and Manichaeism. The term zandik (which already indicated heretics, and Manichaeans in particular, in Pahlavi) indicated the Manichaeans in its Arabized form of zindiq, and later became generally synonymous with free thinker, 'libertine'.\\" > > In this regard, Bausani (at 113) mentions two Zoroastrian books: the Denkart > and the Shkand-gumanig Vichar.The Shkand-gumanig Vizar refers to the > \\"Mutazilik\\", i.e., the Mu'tazili. E. W. West (SBE 24) at 195 (SGV XI: > 280).The caliph al-Ma'mun (r.813-833) was probably a generation or two prior > to Mardan-Farrukh. E. W.

From Mazdean Iran > to Shī'ite Iran (Princeton University 1976; reprint: I. B. Tauris 1990). Notwithstanding, Mardan-Farrukh asks why (if no adversary like Ahriman pre- existed as an independent source of evil) would the sacred being, who acts judiciously and desires universal \\"happiness and prosperity\\", come to create a world that results in \\"misery for multitudes of the innocent who are distressed, poor, necessitous, and sick.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 185 (SGV XI: 146); cf. SBE 24 at 205 (SGV XII: 47). Moreover, Mardan-Farrukh insists on the logic that a solitary creator would imply ultimately a single source for all moral qualities; \\"if it be said that evil and crime arise from [Satan] or mankind, that implies, as they are likewise created and produced by the sacred being, that he is the source of them.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 193 (SGV XI: 258).Another point contra M. M. Ali (see his quotes above): Ahriman is responsible for such evils as earthquakes and hurricanes, evils which are not caused by humankind. Rather instead, for Zoroastrians the cause-of-evil Ahriman in origin and nature is completely independent of Ohrmazd the sacred being;R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 65 (SGV VIII: 104, 108): \\"[W]hat is perfect and complete in its goodness cannot produce evil. ... If God is perfect in goodness and knowledge, plainly ignorance and evil cannot proceed from Him.\\"E. W. West (SBE 24) at 160 (SGV VIII: 104, 108). even now Ohrmazd is contending in the long-term but certain process by which he will defeat Ahriman with finality.R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 139-144 regarding Ohrmazd in his final victory or frashkart. Text excerpt at 145-150, from the Bundahishn, \\"On the Raising of the Dead and the Final Body\\" (chapter 30): victory when Ohrmazd as priest performs a Gathic rite that renders Ahriman powerless (at 150, verse 23).E. W. West (SBE 5) at 120-130 (Bundahis, chapter XXX); Ohrmazd as priest per the Gathic rite (at 128-129, verse 30). ===Book of Job=== From a comparative perspective,Mary Boyce, ZRBP (1979, 1985) at 51-52, 77, regarding Cyrus and Zoroastrian influence on Judaism. \\"[T]he Jews entertained warm feelings thereafter for the Persians, and this made them the more receptive to Zoroastrian influences. Cyrus himself is hailed... as a messiah, that is, as one who acted in Yahweh's name and with his authority.\\" She cites Isaiah 41:1,4. Boyce writes of the \\"influence which Zoroastrianism was to exert so powerfully on post-Exilic Judaism.\\" She later (at 77) lists Zoroastrian doctrines which Judaism shares.R. C. Zaehner, DTZ (1961) at 20-21, and at 57-58 (\\"Influence on Judaism\\"). \\"That Judaism was deeply influenced by Zoroastrianism during and after the Babylonian captivity can scarcely be questioned.\\" Ibid. at 51. a Jewish response to the Zoroastrian faith may be seen in the Book of Job, which was written during or following a period of fruitful interaction between the Jews and the Zoroastrian Persians.\\"Job, Book of\\" at 376, in Dictionary of Comparative Religion (New York: Charles Scribners' Sons 1970), edited by S. G. F. Brandon. The Judaic version, the Biblical Book of Job, is said to have been written between the 5th and 2nd centuries B.C.E., thus written after their return to Judea from their Babylonian captivity in Mesopotamia. This return was allowed the Jews following their liberation by the Persian Cyrus the Great (c.600-530), whom the Bible calls anointed of God (Isaiah 45: 1-3). The Book of Job preceded the SGV by a millennium.James Hope Moulton at 286-331, presents a chapter on \\"Zarathushtra and Israel\\", followed by an Appendix on \\"The Magian Material of Tobit\\" (at 332-340); he references the Book of Job twice. First (at 290), in his \\"comparison in detail\\" he leads by stating similarities between the Wise Lord and Yahweh, citing Job chapter 28, wherein \\"God said to men, 'To be wise, you must have reverence for the Lord. To understand, you must turn from evil'.\\" Later (at 305) he compares Ahriman to Satan in the Book of Job.R. C. Zaehner, TM (1956, 1976) at 56, states: \\"Man suffers at the hands of Ahriman but at least he has the comfort of knowing he is not being tormented by an all-powerful Being who is his own creator. The Zoroastrian does not know the predicament of Job.\\" In the Book of Job, the Biblical God allows Satan to severely punish Job, even though Job has done no wrong to merit the abuse. The tragedy of innocent suffering is discussed without resolution by Job and by several friends who blame Job unjustly. Finally, an epiphany of ecstasy is visited on Job by the merciful Deity, in which Job comes to hear God and to realize with awe the Mystery, that God's ways are beyond the reckoning of humankind.Book of Job, 1: 1-5 (Job's good fortune); 1: 6-12 (Satan's interview with God); 1: 13-19 (death of Job's children and destruction of his many flocks); 1: 20-22 (Job's steadfast faith); 2: 1-6 (Satan's second interview with God); 2: 7-8 (Job's loathsome illness); 2: 9-13 (mocked by wife and friends); 3 (Job curses day he was born); 4-31 (fault-finding speeches by four friends and self-justifying answers by Job); 32-37 (speeches by Elihu, e.g., God's greatness); 38-41 (from the whirlwind God speaks to Job); 40: 3-5 and 42: 1-6 (Job's response to God); 42: 7-9 (God rebukes the four friends); 42: 10-17 (God restores Job's good fortune). God to Job: \\"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.\\" (38: 4) \\"Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?\\" (40: 2) \\"Who then is he that can stand before me? Who has given to me, that I should repay him?\\" (41: 10-11) Job's response: \\"I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.\\" (42: 3) \\"Therefore, I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\\" (42: 6)Cf., Carl Jung, Antwort auf Hiob (Zürich 1952), translated as Answer to Job (Princeton University: Bollingen 1954; reprint Cleveland: Meridian 1960), e.g., in section I at ¶568 (p.8/p.30), where an argument found in the SGV is posed, without attribution. Jung writes: > \\"Yahweh, however, could get inordinately excited about man as a species or > men as individuals if they did not behave as he desired or expected, without > ever considering that in his omnipotence he could easily have created > something better than these 'bad earthenware pots'.\\" > \\"Any claim that the world was created by a good and benevolent god must > provoke the question why the world, in the outcome, is so very far from > good. Zoroaster's answer, that the world had been created by a good and an > evil spirit of equal power, who set up to spoil the good work, is a complete > answer: it is a logical answer, more satisfying to the thinking mind than > the one given by the author of the Book of Job, who withdrew to the claim > that it did not behoove man to inquire into the ways of Omnipotence.\\"W. B. > Henning, Zoroaster. Politician or Witchdoctor? (London 1951) at 46, as cited > by Gherado Gnoli in his article \\"Dualism\\" at paragrah 2, in the Encyclopedia > Iranica. Following a method found in modern comparative religion, more than one answer is possible, and several views may respectfully co-exist whatever the apparent mutual contradiction.Wilfred Cantwell Smith, Towards a World Theology. Faith and the Comparative History of Religion (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press 1981) at 152: The grand mission statement \\"is to interpret intellectually all human faith, one's own and others'; comprehensively and justly. Seeing one's own group and its history thus far as making up one complex strand in the total history of religion until now, a total history that one is endeavouring to understand from within... . Seeing one's own group as a component in the total community of humankind, a total community whose corporate critical self- consciousness... has yet to be articulated.\\" Hence, the Zoroastrian position as discussed more than a thousand years ago by Mardan-Farrukh in his Shikand- gumanik Vichar may be said to embody a rational search by an inquiring mind as befits a creature of God.Cf., Morris Jastrow, Bood of Job. Its origin, growth, and interpretation (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott (1920) at 181-184: \\"Zoroastrianism and the Book of Job\\". ===Hinduism=== R. C. ZaehnerArthur L.

The joint sales of the combined companies were about $3.5 billion; they had about 9,500 employees, and owned more than 3,600 licenses and patents. Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation acquired the company in 2014 and used the Life Technologies brand name for a family of biotechnology products and services from Feb 2014 to July 2015. Thermo Fisher retired the Life Technologies brand name and logos in late July 2015, following a world- wide release letter to all customers in five languages. ==Company name== The name \\"Life Technologies\\" was an old name from the history of Invitrogen. GIBCO (Grand Island Biological Company) had been founded around 1960 in New York; in 1983 GIBCO merged with a reagent company called Bethesda Research Laboratories and the merged company was named Life Technologies. In 2000, Invitrogen acquired Life Technologies and discontinued that name. When Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems merged, the companies revived the name. The use of the \\"Life Technologies\\" brand name is disputed. Life Technologies (India) Private Limited, a company founded in 2002, operating in this corporate name claims ownership of the brand name. In January 2014, a legal dispute on the use of the mark \\"Life Technologies\\" in India concluded as the Delhi High Court denied Life Technologies' request to prevent the similarly named biotechnology company Life Technologies India Pvt. Limited from using the \\"Life Technologies\\" mark and various related web domains. ==Acquisition== In 2013 Thermo Fisher agreed to buy Life Technologies for $13.6 billion. They completed the sale on 3 February 2014, and the Life Technologies brand became part of the Life Sciences Solutions Group of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Between its formation in 2008 and its acquisition by Thermo Fisher Scientific in 2014, Life Technologies Corporation was an independent multinational corporation based in Carlsbad, California, United States. ==Legal disputes== A court case involving Life Technologies (as the former Applera Corp) ended in January 2014, as the Connecticut District Court penalized Life Technologies Corp over $60 million for patent infringements by its parent companies prior to the merger. The jury awarded $48 million in royalty damages to the plaintiffs Enzo Biochem, Inc, Enzo Life Sciences, and Yale University. ==References== Category:Research support companies Category:Manufacturing companies based in California Category:Companies formed by merger Category:Companies based in Carlsbad, California Category:2014 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)"},{"id":"20370610","text":"Citibank Indonesia is a universal bank that offers a wide range of retail and commercial banking services.

The offenses came to light on March 11 when one of the 236 customers Malinda looked after complained about missing funds to Citigroup, which in turn called in the police. On March 7, 2012, Malinda was convicted of stealing from clients by a three-judge panel and sentenced to eight years in jail, according to a ruling delivered at the South Jakarta district court. Following this, in April 2011, Bank Indonesia temporarily banned Citibank from taking new customers for its Citigold wealth management division. On March 29, 2011, Irzen Octa, a small-businessman from Jakarta, was found lying motionless in Citibank's credit card collection department on the fifth floor of the Jamsostek Tower in Jakarta; he had been there to discuss an Rp 48 million principal debt on his Citibank platinum credit card. He was driven to a nearby hospital in a Citibank car, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Irzen's family alleged that he was assaulted by third-party debt collectors before his death. In June 2012, this charge was rejected by the Jakarta High Court which went by the results of a prior autopsy that determined that his death was caused by a ruptured blood vessel caused by his chronic hypertension. The court, however, sentenced to five years in prison, three debt collectors implicated in the death of Irzen Octa, annulling a previous sentence of one year each, for depriving Irzen's liberty which ultimately resulted in his death. Post these two incidents, Bank Indonesia (BI) announced severe sanctions on Citibank, effective 6 May 2011. These include barring Citibank from issuing credit cards to new customers for two years, prohibiting it from signing up new customers for its premium wealth service for one year, ordering Citibank not to use third-party debt collectors for two years and banning the bank from opening new branches for one year. BI also slapped managerial sanctions in the form of fit-and-proper tests on Citibank executives linked to the cases. It also instructed bank executives not to leave Indonesia until all tests were completed. BI also instructed 23 banks to stop signing up new customers for their priority banking businesses for a month starting May 2, 2011. On April 28, 2011, Citibank announced that it was hiring 1,400 debt collection staff who were previously outsourced. ==References * Citibank Indonesia * Citigold Citibank Indonesia Category:Citigroup Category:Banks of Indonesia Category:1918 establishments in the Dutch East Indies Category:Banks established in 1918 ","title":"Citibank Indonesia"},{"id":"20370636","text":"Lugbara may refer to: *Lugbara people *Lugbara language ","title":"Lugbara"},{"id":"20370639","text":"Vellakkinar is a junction in Thalavay village in Thalavady Panchayath, Kuttanad Taluk, Alappuzha District, Kerala State.

He was the son of Madog by the daughter of the Maer du or \\"black mayor\\" of Rûg in Edeyrnion however some sources cite his mother as Susanna making him legitimate instead. He was the brother of Gruffydd Maelor the ancestor of Owain Glyndŵr. Presumably Owain Brogyntyn would have been raised by his mother at Rûg in Edeyrnion. He was acknowledged by his father and granted by him the lordship of Edeyrnion and also Dinmael. It is quite possible that he inherited some of these lands through his maternal grandfather, the Maer Du, which were confirmed and perhaps extended by his father the king of Powys. At some point he also came into possession of Castle Brogyntyn on the English borders at Selattyn close to Oswestry. In 1160 after the death of his father and his eldest half-brother, he inherited a share of the Kingdom of Powys - specifically, the cantref of Penllyn (which included Edeyrnion and Dinmael).. The military skill and strength of Madog had prevented Owain Gwynedd (the ruling Prince of Gwynedd) from asserting hegemony over Powys, but following Madog's death, Owain Gwynedd was able to force Owain Brogyntyn to become his vassal; as a consequence, Penllyn became part of Gwynedd. Owain first married Jonet verch Hywel (whose ancestor was Athelstan Glodrudd of the Fifth Royal Tribe) but with her had no children. He next married Marred ferch Einion ap Seisyllt who was to be the mother of his three sons, Bleddyn, Gruffydd, Iorwerth. Bleddyn on the death of his father was made Lord of Dinmael, some notable descendants patrilineally of Bleddyn are the Wynn's of Dudleston descended from Howell second son of Owain ap Bleddyn whose coat of arms is the black lion rampart on an Ardent(Silver)shield, who were living in 1634 with the descendant of the family known as Morgan Wynn Barrister at Law living in the parish of Dudleston at the Estate inherited by the family through an earlier marriage, the Pentre Morgan property. He also had two younger brother Richard and Thomas Wynn. His youngest son, Iorwerth ab Owain Brogyntyn, married Efa verch Madoc the sole heir of Madoc, Lord of Mawddwy (the younger son of Gwenwynwyn, prince of Powys Wenwynwyn). The son of Iorwerth and Efa, Gruffudd ab Iorwerth, was confirmed in his lands as Baron of Edeyrnion by Edward I under the terms of the Statute of Rhuddlan by which England organised the subjugation of Wales. According to Philip York writing in 1799 a cup and a dagger belonging to Owain Brogyntyn were preserved at Rûg in Edeyrnion. Later accounts in the National Gazetteer dated 1868 state that a cup and dagger in the possession of \\"Colonel Vaughan of Rhug\\" were once owned by another Owain of Powys, the much later Owain Glyndŵr. These objects, whoever the original owner, may now be lost. The direct patrilineal descendants of Iorwerth ab Owain Brogyntyn survive to the present day in the Jones of Faerdref Uchaf family. ==References== * York, Philip The Royal Tribes of Wales 1799, p. 119,120 *Burke's Peerage of Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland page 222 under Mae. *George and Joseph Morris Genealogies Shropshire Archives Category:Monarchs of Powys Category:Welsh princes Category:House of Mathrafal Category:12th-century Welsh people Category:12th- century rulers in Europe ","title":"Owain Brogyntyn"},{"id":"20370694","text":"François Gény (1861–1959) was a French jurist and professor of law at the University of Nancy, who introduced the notion of \\"free scientific research\\" to the interpretation of positive law. His advocacy of judicial discretion in the interpretation of statutory law had an important influence across Europe. Gény also emphasized that judges should take into account social and economic factors when deciding cases. ==Biography== François Gény was the fourth child of a numerous family of 12 children. His father, Alfred Gény, was a forest warden in Baccarat (North-East of France). His mother, Marie-Eugénie Huin, was the daughter of a scrivener. Two of his brothers became priests, and another one became a teacher in the University of Roma. François Gény studied law in Nancy (North-East of France) from 1878 to 1887. He got his diploma and became college professor, he taught Roman law in Algiers (1888–1889). He also taught civil law and international law in the University of Dijon (1890–1900), where he met another famous law teacher, . He then taught civil law in Nancy from 1901 to 1931 and became dean of the faculty (1919–1925). He reintroduced classes of natural law named « Philosophical introduction to law study. » In 1930, he became a member of the French Institute and received the Légion d'honneur (French highest decoration) in 1934. Nine universities conferred him the title of Doctorate Honoris Causa: Groningen (1914), Leuven (1927), Warsaw (1929), Brussels (1929), Geneva (1930), Jassy (1934), Lausanne (1935), Basel (1936) and Athens (1937). In 1933, he was elected foreign member of the Boston American Academy of Arts and Sciences. ==Legal opinions== François Gény. At the end of the 19th century, the Civil code of 1804 was still the major reference in French law. This Civil Code was inspired by the French revolution principles, where judges were considered as the « mouth of the law » and obliged to apply it without any interpretations. However, François Gény decided to use an independent method based on the will of the law-maker. In his work Method of interpretation and sources of positive private law : a critical essay, published in 1899, François Gény declared that law has different implications. He noted that customs, tradition and scientific studies should be used to identify different interpretations of what is written in the law. In Science and technic in positive private law, published from 1914 to 1924, François Gény described a new method of interpretation called free scientific research with the goal to discover the origins of principles and rules. With this free scientific research, he based his studies on various \\"sciences\\" such as sociology, economics, linguistics, philosophy and theology, that previous law teachers had not used before. ==Political involvement== In 1936, François Gény was part of a local political group called the Lorraine national gathering. This group campaigned against the French socialist government elected in 1936. ==Selected works== * Essai critique sur la méthode d’interprétation juridique en vue d’une orientation nouvelle des études de droit privé (\\"Critical essay to juridical method of interpretation for a new orientation of private law studies\\") * Université de Dijon, Revue bourguignonne de l’enseignement supérieur, t.

The largest water consuming sector in Syria is agriculture. The domestic water use stand only at about 9% of total water use.M. Salman & W. Mulla. The Utilization of Water Resources for Agriculture in Syria: Analysis of Current Situation and Future Challenges A big challenge for Syria is the high population growth with a rapidly increasing demand of urban and industrial water. In 2006 the population of Syria was 19.4 million with a growth of 2.7%.World Bank (2001). Syrian Arab Republic Irrigation Sector Report. Rural Development, Water and Environment Group, Middle East and North Africa Region, Report No. 22602-SYR == Access == Public water supply systems cover about 95% of the households in urban areas and about 80% in rural areas.

Major water treatment facilities exist only for the domestic water supply system for Aleppo, which is provided with water from Lake Assad. == Water resources == Most of the domestic water in Syria is supplied by groundwater, wells and springs. One exception is Aleppo city, which receives water for domestic use by pipelines from the Assad reservoir.Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (Germany) & Ministry of Irrigation (Syria). Initial Assessment Study of Water Sector Management in the Syrian Arab Republic, Final Report. Damascus, September 2004 However, the city of Homs is supplied with surface water from the Orontes River through a pipeline from Lake Homs.Embasssy of Syria in China, Tourism:A lake dating back to Egyptian times, accessed on October 31, 2009 == Wastewater management == In 2002, total wastewater produced in Syria was estimated at 1,364 million m3. Of this total 550 million m3 (40%) was treated in the cities of Damascus, Aleppo, Homs and Salamiyah. All treated wastewater is reused for irrigation.FAO:FAO Aquastat Country Profile, 2008, accessed on October 31, 2009 In October 2009, the Ministry of Housing and Construction (Syria) announced a plan to develop Syria’s wastewater infrastructure. The plan involves the construction of 180 new wastewater treatment plants across the country. Two plants are in the foreground: one located in Jaramanah and the other serving the southern city of As Suwayda. The procurement of the two plants has been assigned to Syrian- Qatari Holding Company (SQHC).AMEinfo.com:Syrian-Qatari Holding (SQH) adds sewage treatment plants to its project list in Syria, November 1, 2009 SQH had planned to seek potential strategic partners through competitive tenders before February 2010. To increase the attractiveness of the project the Syrian Ministry of Finance has pledged to provide a sovereign guarantee for the agreements that will be signed with the partners. The two new plants would allow reusing treated effluent for agricultural irrigation, an established practice in Syria.GWI – Global Water Intelligence, Vol.10 Issue 11, November 2009, p.16 However, as of December 2010 the projects were delayed after SQH failed to reach a financial agreement with the government. Also, a law on public-private partnerships that would have been the legal basis for the Build-Operate Transfer (BOT) projects was delayed.Water left out as Syrian PPP law founders, Global Water Intelligence, December 2010, p. 16 ==Institutional framework== The Syrian water sector is fragmented and different institutions have overlapping functions and responsibilities. The Ministry of Housing and Construction (Syria) (MHC) is responsible for proposing, planning and executing the Government's programme in the field of water supply and sanitation. Through its 14 water and sanitation directorates (Establishments) it is also in charge of providing water supply and sanitation services. The Ministry of Local Administration (Syria) (MLA) has the task to plan and implement all governmental activities at regional level. MLAE is responsible for the protection of the environment by issuing the required standards and monitoring the quality of water for all uses. The State Minister for Environment Affairs is responsible for dealing with all main environmental issues. The Ministry of Irrigation (Syria) is responsible for supplying water for agriculture. == See also == * Water management in Greater Damascus * Water resources management in Syria == References == Category:Health in Syria ","title":"Water supply and sanitation in Syria"},{"id":"20370710","text":"Llangar is a former civil parish in Denbighshire in Wales, south west of Corwen, its post town, and north east of Bala.

He cancelled this order and replaced it with another for two locomotives of his own design, Nos. 83 and 84 which appeared in December 1871. Eighteen further locomotives were constructed between March 1873 and November 1874, Nos. 77-82 by Brighton works and the remainder by Messrs. Kitson & Co. ==Use== The class were powerful locomotives for their time and the design was \\"an archetype for heavy goods engines in Scotland as well as Southern England,\\" but in other respects were Stroudley's least successful design, suffering from poor steaming. Within a decade of their introduction the class was being replaced by his C1 class 0-6-0 design of 1882–87, on the heaviest trains. Nevertheless, they proved to be reliable locomotives and survived for nearly thirty years on secondary freight duties.

In 2 out of the 47 countries was there a majority that favoured keeping troops in Afghanistan – Israel (59%) and Kenya (60%). On the other hand, in 41 of the 47 countries pluralities wanted NATO troops out of Afghanistan as soon as possible. In 32 out of 47 countries majorities wanted NATO troops out of Afghanistan as soon as possible. Majorities in 7 out of 12 NATO member countries wanted troops withdrawn as soon as possible. The 24-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2008 again found that majorities or pluralities in 21 of 24 countries wanted NATO troops removed from Afghanistan as soon as possible. In 3 out of the 24 countries – the U.S. (50%), Australia (60%), and Britain (48%) – public opinion favoured keeping troops there until the situation stabilized. Since then, public opinion in Australia and Britain has shifted, and the majority of Australians and British now also want their troops to be brought home from Afghanistan. Of the seven NATO countries in the survey, not one showed a majority in favor of keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan – one, the U.S., came close to a majority (50%). Of the other six NATO countries, five had majorities of their population wanting NATO troops removed from Afghanistan as soon as possible. The 25-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2009 continued to find that the war in Afghanistan was unpopular in most nations and that most publics want American and NATO troops out of Afghanistan. The 2009 global survey reported that majorities or pluralities in 18 out of 25 countries wanted NATO to remove their troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible. (Changes from 2008 included Tanzania, South Africa, and Australia having been replaced by Israel, Kenya, the Palestinian Territories, and Canada in the survey, and shifts in opinions in India and Nigeria.) In 4 out of 25 countries was there a majority that favoured keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan – the U.S. (57%), Israel (59%), Kenya (56%), and Nigeria (52%). Despite American calls for NATO allies to send more troops to Afghanistan, there was majority or plurality opposition to such action in every one of the NATO countries surveyed: Germany (63% opposition), France (62%), Poland (57%), Canada (55%), Britain (51%), Spain (50%), and Turkey (49%). In Europe, polls in France, Germany, Britain, and other countries showed that the European public wanted their troops to be pulled out and less money spent on the war in Afghanistan.Afghan war exposes flaws in assumption of Nato unity ==International public opinion compared to American public opinion== In October 2001, a poll by CNN/Gallup/USA Today indicated that about 88% of Americans backed military action in Afghanistan, and a poll by Market Opinion Research indicated that about 65% of Britons supported having British troops involved. Published July 24, 2008. On the other hand, a large-scale 37-nation poll of world opinion carried out by Gallup International in late September 2001, found that majorities in most countries favoured a legal response, in the form of extradition and trial, over a military response to 9/11: In 3 of the 37 countries surveyed – the United States, Israel, and India – did majorities favour military action. In 34 out of the 37 countries surveyed, the survey found majorities that did not favour military action: in the United Kingdom (75%), France (67%), Switzerland (87%), Czech Republic (64%), Lithuania (83%), Panama (80%), Mexico (94%), etc. This dichotomy between American and international public opinion on the military operations continues to be seen, although opposition to the war is growing in the U.S. as well. A Gallup poll conducted July 10–12, 2009 reported that the majority 61% of Americans do not think the U.S. made a mistake in sending military forces in 2001, while 36% of Americans do. 54% also thought things are going well for the U.S.. An Angus Reid poll conducted July 15–18, 2009, found that 55% of Americans support the military operation, while 35% oppose it. 49% of Americans thought their country did the right thing in sending military forces. About half, 48%, of Americans felt that they did not have a clear idea of what the war is about.Britain, Canada Differ from U.S. on Afghan War Outside the United States international public opinion has been largely opposed to the war. In a 47-nation June 2007 survey of global public opinion, the Pew Global Attitudes Project found considerable opposition to NATO operations. In 4 out of the 47 countries surveyed was there a majority that favoured keeping troops: the U.S. (50%), Israel (59%), Ghana (50%), and Kenya (60%).
