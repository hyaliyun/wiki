Local amenities There are two public house/restaurants: \\"Blackwater Bar & Bistro\\" (purchased and refurbished by the present owners in late 2014)which is situated adjacent to the Blackwater Marina, and \\"Hardy's\\" (also recently refurbished). There are two sailing clubs enjoying the Blackwater River here: Maylandsea Bay Sailing Club, situated near to the boat yard & Bistro and the Harlow (Blackwater) Sailing Club,accessed via North Drive, Mayland. The sea wall walk is enjoyed by locals and many visiting ramblers' groups. The boatyard, originally Cardnells Boatyard, was involved in building motor torpedo boats (MTBs) in the Second World War. The present local primary school is Maylandsea County Primary School, in Katonia Avenue. It was built when increased development in Maylandsea and Lower Mayland made it impractical to transport the children to either Mayland & Althorne County Primary School, Southminster Road, Upper Mayland, or to Latchingdon C. of E. Primary school in the nearby village of Latchingdon. In The Drive, Maylandsea, there is a small shopping area serving the community; including (in 2017) a combined supermarket and Post Office; a bakery; general store; card shop; two hairdressers/barber's/beauty salon; dog grooming parlour; fish and chip shop; a second food outlet; pharmacy and a charity shop;. On Steeple Road, Mayland, the award-winning Indian restaurant \\"Zara\\" can be found in the converted old farm workers' cottages near the junction of Steeple Road and Grange Avenue, Mayland. Although the restaurant (previously a pub) has been known as \\"The Mayland Mill\\" for many years, this is not the site of the actual windmill. The Mayland post-mill, thought to have been built in 1817, was known for many years as Cardnell's Mill, as apparently George Cardnell occupied it from 1863 to 1899. The site of the windmill was in a field opposite Mill Road, Mayland, therefore further along the Steeple Road and on the opposite side. Although the mill was demolished many years ago, the mill house still remains as a residential property. The Henry Samuel Hall on Steeple Road, Mayland, has a fascinating history linked to the American philanthropist Joseph Fels and The Back to the Land Movement. This is still being researched, but it is known the hall was brought to Mayland from a site in Kingsway, London in 1908, arranged by Fel's agricultural smallholdings manager Thomas Smith, to be used as a temporary school for the children of the farmers and agricultural workers. There is also a local paper known as The Maylands Mayl which is a useful source of information for in and around the area. Parish council Mayland Parish Council meets monthly at the Lawling Hall, Lawling Park, off Katonia Avenue, Maylansea The villages of Mayland and Maylandsea are in an area, parts of which are considered to be at risk from flooding, and the Parish Council, working with Maldon District Council, is developing a localised emergency plan to link into the wider emergency strategy covering the whole district.

In 1570-1571 a short lived rebellion broke out under Emmanuel Mormoris in Himara region. After a prolonged siege the rebels managed to capture the castle of Nivicë. In 1798 Lukovë together with adjacent villages in the region south of Himara were attacked and plundered by the local Ottoman lord Ali Pasha of Ioannina. In the villages of Nivice and Shën Vasil massacres of Orthodox inhabitants were committed in Easter of 1798. As such cases of massive islamization among the local population were followed in the region. During the end of the 19th century Greek elementary schools were already operating in the villages of Lukovë, Nivicë, Çorraj and Shën Vasil.  Demographics  According to German academic research conducted in 1957 the villages of Piqeras, Lukovë and Sasaj were among the Greek speaking pockets on the Albanian Ionian coast. The municipal unit consists of the following settlements:Greece – Albania Neighbourhood Programme According to 1991 estimates, Lukovë, the municipal seat is inhabited by a majority Orthodox Albanian population (2076 or 82%) alongside minorities of Muslim Albanians (250 or 12%) and Greeks (150 or 6%). Borsh, Fterrë and Sasaj are exclusively populated by Muslim Albanians. Piqeras is inhabited by an Orthodox Albanian majority (991) with a minority of 100 Muslim Albanians and 50 Greeks. Çorraj is a mixed village inhabited by an Orthodox Albanian population and Albanian Muslims. Shën Vasil (Shënvasi) is inhabited by a majority Orthodox Albanian population (1434) and with a minority of Muslim Albanians (220) and Greeks (210). Nivicë is inhabited by an Orthodox Albanian majority (899) and a minority of Greeks (30). Qazim Pali is a new village established during the communist period and is populated by Muslim Albanians (861) alongside minorities of Orthodox Albanians (50) and Greeks (80). In a demographic investigation by Leonidas Kallivretakis in the late 20th century, the population of Lukovë commune and all its villages, 54% were Albanian Christians, 40% were Albanian Muslims and 6% were Greek Christians.Kallivretakis, Leonidas (1995). \\"Η ελληνική κοινότητα της Αλβανίας υπό το πρίσμα της ιστορικής γεωγραφίας και δημογραφίας [The Greek Community of Albania in terms of historical geography and demography.\\" In Nikolakopoulos, Ilias, Kouloubis Theodoros A. & Thanos M.

He developed a controversial theory detailing how the Great Pyramid of Giza was built. Pyramid construction theory Scheme inside the pyramid In 1999, Houdin's father, a retired civil engineer, started to develop the idea that the pyramids had been built from the inside. Jean-Pierre Houdin, using advanced 3D modelling technology, helped him identify a construction anomaly which they named \\"the spiral structure\\". It looked exactly like a ramp built inside the pyramid which they thought could have played a part in its construction. In 2003, his father created the Association of the Construction of the Great Pyramid (ACGP) in order to promote the project. This association enabled him to meet a number of experts. Analytical process In 2005, Mehdi Tayoubi and Richard Breitner from Dassault Systèmes invited him to join a new sponsorship programme “Passion For Innovation”. Together, they decided to examine the theory in the light of Dassault Systèmes's industrial and scientific 3D solutions. Using software applications such as CATIA to reconstitute the site of this gigantic construction in three dimensions allowed them to test in real-time whether such an approach was plausible. In order to explain and communicate it, Tayoubi and his team used 3D technology as a teaching medium and proposed an interactive voyage through time in three dimensions. This was presented both on the giant screen of La Géode (a famous hemispheric theater in Paris), and on the Internet. Also in 2005, a project was initiated to analyse the cracks in the King's Chamber of the pyramid. The group consisted of Houdin, the egyptologist Bob Brier, Tayoubi, Breitner, and a team of engineers from Dassault Systèmes. Their choice of software tools such as SIMULIA, are normally used by industrial corporations to simulate the behaviour of their products in operation, and to detect any structural weaknesses in order to solve problems as early as the products' design phase. Their scheme involves the use of a regular external ramp to build the first 30% of the pyramid, with an \\"internal ramp\\" taking stones up beyond that height.Mystery of Great Pyramid 'solved' BBC. March 31, 2007. The stones of the external ramp are re-cycled into the upper stories, thus explaining the otherwise puzzling lack of evidence for ramps. After 4 years working alone, Houdin was joined by a team of engineers from the French 3D software company Dassault Systemes, who used the most modern computer-aided design technology available to further refine and test the hypothesis, making it (according to Houdin) the only one proven to be a viable technique.French architect Houdin turns the pyramid theory inside out 2600 B.C. Lean Manufacturing (Tech Trends Feature) - Cadalyst AEC. July 1, 2007. In 2006 Houdin announced it in a book: Khufu: The Secrets Behind the Building of the Great Pyramid,Khufu: The Secrets Behind the Building of the Great Pyramid by Jean-pierre Houdin, , Farid Atiya Press, 2006. and in 2008 he and Egyptologist Bob Brier wrote a second one: The Secret of the Great PyramidThe Secret of the Great Pyramid: How One Man's Obsession Led to the Solution of Ancient Egypt's Greatest Mystery by Bob Brier & Jean-pierre Houdin, Collins 2008. In Houdin's method, each ramp inside the pyramid ended at an open space, a notch temporarily left open in the edge of the construction.(see diagram) This 10-square-meter clear space housed a crane that lifted and rotated each 2.5-ton block, to ready it for eight men to drag up the next internal ramp. There is a notch of sorts in one of the right places, and in 2008 Houdin's co-author Bob Brier, with a National Geographic film crew, entered a previously unremarked chamber that could be the start of one of these internal ramps.Bob Brier (2009) \\"Update: Return to the Great Pyramid\\" Archaeology 62(4): 27-29 In 1986 a member of the French team (see below) saw a desert fox at this notch, rather as if it had ascended internally. Houdin's thesis remains unproven and in 2007, UCL Egyptologist David Jeffreys described the internal spiral hypothesis as \\"far-fetched and horribly complicated\\", while Oxford University's John Baines, declared he was \\"suspicious of any theory that seeks to explain only how the Great Pyramid was built\\".Secrets of a lost world The Engineer, May 8, 2007. The team concluded that the pyramid’s architect, Hemiunu, concerned that the cracks imperiled the whole structure, had cut a tunnel into a sealed space above the burial chamber to assess the damage, and then had filled the cracks with plaster as a tell- tale that would indicate if they were widening. The beams held and the pyramid was completed.

His father Kumaraswami was a merchant. Kamaraj had a younger sister named Nagammal. Kamaraj was first enrolled in a traditional school in 1907 and in 1908 he was admitted to Yenadhi Narayana Vidhya Salai. In 1909 Kamaraj was admitted in Virudupatti High School. Kamaraj's father died when he was six years old, his mother was forced to support the family. In 1914 Kamaraj dropped out of school to support his mother. Politics As a young boy, Kamaraj worked in his uncle's provision shop and during that time he began to attend public meetings and processions about the Indian Home Rule Movement. Kamaraj developed an interest in prevailing political conditions by reading newspapers daily. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was the decisive turning point in his life - he decided to fight for national freedom and to bring an end to foreign rule. In 1920, when he was 18, he became active in politics. He joined Congress as a full-time political worker. In 1921 Kamaraj organised public meetings at Virudhunagar for Congress leaders. He was eager to meet Gandhi, and when Gandhi visited Madurai on 21 September 1921 Kamaraj attended the public meeting and met Gandhi for the first time. He visited villages carrying Congress propaganda. In 1922 Congress boycotted the visit of the Prince of Wales as part of the Non-Cooperation Movement. He came to Madras and took part in the event. In 1923–25 Kamaraj participated in the Nagpur Flag Satyagraha.K.Kamaraj. virudhunagar.nic.in In 1927, Kamaraj started the Sword Satyagraha in Madras and was chosen to lead the Neil Statue Satyagraha, but this was given up later in view of the Simon Commission boycott. Kamaraj went to jail for two years in June 1930 for participating in the \\"Salt Satyagraha\\". led by Rajagopalachari at Vedaranyam; he was released before he served the two year sentence as a result of 1931 Gandhi-Irwin Pact. In 1932, Section 144 was imposed in Madras prohibiting the holding of meetings and organisation of processions against the arrest of Gandhi in Bombay. In Virdhunagar, under Kamaraj's leadership, processions and demonstrations happened every day. Kamaraj was arrested again in January 1932 and sentenced to one year's imprisonment.Freedom Movement In Madras Presidency With Special Reference To The Role Of Kamaraj (1920–1945), Page 3 In 1933 Kamaraj was falsely charged in the Virudhunagar bomb case. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph argued on Kamaraj's behalf and proved the charges to be baseless.George Joseph, a true champion of subaltern At the age of 34, Kamaraj entered the Assembly winning the Sattur seat in the 1937 election. Kamaraj conducted a vigorous campaign throughout the state asked people not to contribute to war funds when Sir Arthur Hope, the Madras Governor, was collecting contributions to fund for the Second World War. In December 1940 he was arrested again at Guntur, under the Defence of India rules for speeches that opposed contributions to the war fund, and sent to Vellore Central Prison while he was on his way to Wardha to get Gandhi's approval for a list of Satyagrahis. While in jail, he was elected as Municipal Councillor of Virudhunagar. He was released nine months later in November 1941 and resigned from this post as he thought he had greater responsibility for the nation. His principle was \\"One should not accept any post to which one could not do full justice\\". In 1942, Kamaraj attended the All-India Congress Committee in Bombay and returned to spread propaganda material for the Quit India Movement. The police issued orders to all the leaders who attended this Bombay session. Kamaraj did not want to be arrested before he took the message to all district and local leaders. finishing his work and sent a message to the local police that he was ready to be arrested. He was arrested in August 1942. He was under detention for three years and was released in June 1945. This was his last prison term. Kamaraj was imprisoned six times by the British for his pro-Independence activities, that added up to more than 3,000 days in jail. During the anti-cow slaughter agitation in 1966, Kamaraj's house near the parliament was burnt down by Hindutva groups. The agitation was incited by Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the political arm of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). They also surrounded his house with an intent to attack him. Kamaraj had a narrow escape. Chief Minister On 13 April 1954, Kamaraj became the Chief Minister of Madras Province. To everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated C. Subramaniam and M. Bhakthavatsalam, who had contested his leadership, to the newly formed cabinet. As Chief Minister, Kamaraj removed the family vocation based Hereditary Education Policy introduced by Rajaji. The State made immense strides in education and trade. New schools were opened, so that poor rural students had to walk no more than three kilometres to their nearest school. Better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strived to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education up to the eleventh standard. He introduced the Midday Meal Scheme to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor school children. Later it was expanded to four more schools. This was the precursor to the free noon meal schemes introduced by K. Kamaraj in 1960's and expanded by M. G. Ramachandran in the 1980s.. He introduced free school uniforms to weed out caste, creed and class distinctions among young minds. Kamaraj Statue in Marina Beach, Chennai depicting his contribution to education in the state Perunthalaivar Kamarajar Statue in Kamaraj Colony, Hosur During the British regime the education rate was only 7%. But after Kamaraj's reforms it reached 37%. Apart from increasing the number of schools, steps were taken to improve standards of education. To improve standards, the number of working days was increased from 180 to 200; unnecessary holidays were reduced; and syllabi were prepared to give opportunity to various abilities. Kamaraj and Bishnuram Medhi (Governor) took efforts to establish IIT Madras in 1959. Major irrigation schemes were planned in Kamaraj's period. Dams and irrigation canals were built across higher Bhavani, Mani Muthar, Aarani, Vaigai, Amaravathi, Sathanur, Krishnagiri, Pullambadi, Parambikulam and Neyyaru among others. The Lower Bhavani Dam in Erode district brought of land under cultivation. of land benefited from canals constructed from the Mettur Dam. The Vaigai and Sathanur systems facilitated cultivation across thousands of acres of lands in Madurai and North Arcot districts respectively. Rs 30 crores were planned to be spent for Parambikulam River scheme, and 150 lakhs of acres of lands were brought under cultivation; one third of this (i.e. 56 lakhs of acres of land) received a permanent irrigation facility. In 1957–61 1,628 tanks were de-silted under the Small Irrigation Scheme, and 2,000 wells were dug with outlets. Long term loans with 25% subsidy were given to farmers. In addition farmers who had dry lands were given oil engines and electric pump sets on an instalment basis. Industries with huge investments in crores of Rupees were started in his period: Neyveli Lignite Corporation, BHEL at Trichy, Manali Refinery, Hindustan raw photo film factory at Ooty, surgical instruments factory at Chennai, and a railway coach factory at Chennai were established. Industries such as paper, sugar, chemicals and cement took off during the period.

Bhuvaraghan Publicity and Information } Kamaraj Plan Kamaraj remained Chief Minister for three consecutive terms, winning elections in 1957 and 1962. Kamaraj noticed that the Congress party was slowly losing its vigour. Kamaraj statue at East Tambaram, Chennai On Gandhi Jayanti day 2 October 1963, he resigned from the post of the Chief Minister. He proposed that all senior Congress leaders should resign from their posts and devote all their energy to the re-vitalization of the Congress. In 1963 he suggested to Nehru that senior Congress leaders should leave ministerial posts to take up organisational work. This suggestion came to be known as the Kamaraj Plan, which was designed primarily to dispel from the minds of Congressmen the lure of power, creating in its place a dedicated attachment to the objectives and policies of the organisation. Six Union Ministers and six Chief Ministers including Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jagjivan Ram, Morarji Desai, Biju Patnaik and S.K. Patil followed suit and resigned from their posts. Impressed by Kamaraj's achievements and acumen, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru felt that his services were needed more at the national level. In a swift move he brought Kamaraj to Delhi as the President of the Indian National Congress. Nehru realised that in addition to wide learning and vision, Kamaraj possessed enormous common sense and pragmatism. Kamaraj was elected the President of Indian National Congress on 9 October 1963.K Kamaraj. dpcc.co.in National politics After Nehru's death in 1964, Kamaraj successfully navigated the party through turbulent times. As the president of INC, he refused to become the next Prime Minister himself and was instrumental in bringing to power two Prime Ministers, Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1964 and Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi in 1966. For this role, he was widely acclaimed as the \\"kingmaker\\" during the 1960s. When the Congress split in 1969, Kamaraj became the leader of the Indian National Congress (Organisation) (INC(O)) in Tamil Nadu. The party fared poorly in the 1971 elections amid allegations of fraud by the opposition parties. He remained the leader of INC(O) until his death in 1975.

He refused to use the Z-level security that was provided to him as the CM of Tamil Nadu and instead travelled with just one police patrol vehicle. He did not marry, did not own any property and was never tempted by power. When he died, he left behind 130 rupees, 2 pairs of sandals, 4 shirts, 4 dhotis and a few books.

It is located in the Dordogne River valley in Le Buisson-de-Cadouin, Dordogne, Aquitaine, France. The cave was discovered on September 30, 2000, by amateur speleologist Marc Delluc and formally announced by the French Ministry of Culture on December 8, 2000. It is currently under protection for scientific study, and closed to the public. The cave's artworks are estimated to be 25,000 years old, and are almost exclusively engravings, often very large, made with stone tools on the walls, or with fingers on clay soil. Pigments are limited to very few red dots. They include both classic instances of Upper Paleolithic animal art (bison, horses, mammoths, rhinoceroses, ibex) and rarer images including birds, enigmatic figures, and perhaps four female profiles. All appear close in theme and style of those known to Gravettien in the Quercy caves, in particular Pech Merle. The cave's human remains appear to represent one of very few associations of parietal works and human burials in Paleolithic Europe. At least five people, four adults and a teenager, were deposited in the cavities, with bones dated by Carbon 14 measurements to approximately 25,000 years in age.

KBDZ was a Class A station known as B93 until it was granted a construction permit to increase its power to 50,000 watts and become a Class C2 station. The expanded signal added coverage the southern part of the St. Louis metropolitan area and Metro East south to Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The station's signal also covers a large part of the St. Louis metropolitan area's Metro East, Illinois and southern Illinois region. As a result of its fringe coverage of St. Louis, St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Blues broadcasts were moved to KSGM to avoid overlap. An additional change to 36,000 watts at a larger height above average terrain was later approved. In November 2013, KBDZ changed from a country music format to classic rock.

Mursi is inhabited an Orthodox Albanian majority, alongside a few Muslim Albanians and Greeks. pp. 197-198. The first village, Xarrë, contains a mixed population in regard to confession and language.[3] The village is about 15 km from the Albanian-Greek border crossing point (for pedestrians) of Qafë Bota and around 30 km from the district capital, Sarandë.

This is the case with the Muslim Roma of Filiati in Thesprotia who, following the expulsion of the Muslim Albanian Chams from Greece in 1944-1945, were settled in the village of Shkallë, Sarandë in Albania. The majority of the families, more than fifteen, gradually settled in Greece.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The first church on the site was built by Aldhelm in the late 7th century. Major building work was undertaken in the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries with little remaining of the Norman and Saxon structures. In 1852 the controversial priest William James Early Bennett was appointed as the vicar and undertook major changes both in the organisation of the parish and the fabric of the church. The restoration by Charles Edmund Giles included stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe and statuary by James Forsyth. The entrance to the church passes a holy well and stone-sculptured Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) depicting seven scenes from the Stations of the Cross. It is unique in the Anglican church in England. History William James Early Bennett (1804-1886) The parish church of St John the Baptist, with its tower and spire, was built between the late 12th century and early 15th century replacing a Saxon building that had stood since 685 AD. The first church of St John the Baptist ('in honorem sancti Johannis Baptista') had been established when Aldhelm obtained a grant from Pope Sergius I to establish a foundation of mission priests to spread the faith in Selwood Forest. William of Malmesbury stated that the church was still there in 1125. By the second half of the 11th century the church was under the control of Regenbald. Nothing remains of the original church apart from some fragments of masonry; these are fragments, close to the entrance of St Andrew's Chapel, of what may have been crosses. The location of the first Saxon church is unknown, though it is likely to have shared the same rocky platform as the present church, located between two streams running down the hill on either side, what are now Blindhouse Lane and Gentle Street. When the church was being restored from the 1850s, foundations of arcades and possible Saxon interments were found, but these were quickly covered so the rebuilding was not delayed. The fabric of the current church was built in the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries but largely rebuilt in the 19th. Around 1418 William Starke was the vicar.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/629; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H5/CP40no629/bCP40no629dorses/IMG_1341.htm; 4th entry. The executors of the will of William Starke, parson of St John the Baptist in Frome (Woodland,) are given as Robert Crass & John Perys In the 1540s separate chantry chapels to St Andrew, St Nicholas and Our Lady were established. The controversial priest William James Early Bennett was appointed as the vicar in 1852. Bennett is celebrated for having provoked the decision that the doctrine of the Real Presence is a dogma not inconsistent with the creed of the Church of England. As a leading member of the Oxford Movement he had served as vicar to various churches in London but resigned in 1851, following doctrinal complaints and a theological dispute with his bishop, Charles Blomfield - after being accused of ritualism. His publication The Old Church Porch (1854–1862), issued at Frome, is sometimes cited as being in effect the first parish magazine, although this claim has been disputed. Within a few years of Bennett's arrival the system of pew privilege, by which the wealthy bought their pews was abandoned and many of the pews and the galleries were removed. He also divided the parish into 12 districts and established schools, classes, a dispensary and other charities for the population. He set up a choir school for 12 boys and creches for the children of the town's factory workers. He bought some of the properties surrounding the church for the school, which is now used as the church hall and known as the Bennett Centre. The altar and reredos The chancel was restored in 1844 and further restored in the 1850s and 1860s by C. E. Giles, which entailed almost total rebuilding. Bennett employed the sculptor James Forsyth to carve statues of saints, the reredos and 18 medallions. Forsyth was also responsible for the carving of the Via Crucis alongside the steps on the north side of the church. It was designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1983. The parish and benefice of Frome (St John the Baptist) is within the archdeaconry of Wells and the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture font surrounded by a pavement showing the seven virtues and seven deadly sins. The church contains a chancel, Lady chapel and baptistery and has a 7 or 8 bay nave. Fragments of Norman work are left including carved stones at the base of the tower and parts of the arch into the Lady Chapel. The interior is elaborately adorned with sculptures and stained glass, most of which is by Charles Eamer Kempe. The font was moved from St Andrew's Chapel to the Chapel of St Nicholas which became the baptistry. It is surrounded by a pavement showing the seven virtues and seven deadly sins. There are brass gates to the Chancel and a forged metal screen to the Lady Chapel, complete with gas lamp feature, both locally manufactured by John Webb Singer. There is a fine brass lectern and brass candlesticks in the church, but it is uncertain that these are Singer products; he did make such items for the church, but there has been some clearance of excess Victorian items. Outside the east end of the church is the tomb of Thomas Ken (July 1637 – 19 March 1711) who was an English cleric who was considered one of the fathers of modern English hymnology and the most eminent of the seven Bishops who refused the oath of Indulgence 1689 to William and Mary and was consequently deprived of his See of Bath and Wells. Hence the symbolism: an empty grave, and empty coffin, outside the church. He is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 8 June. Ken is honoured with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 20 March. The Via Crucis The Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) is unique and stone- sculptured. It was added in the 1860s, when several buildings were demolished to make way for it. The carvings by James Forsyth depict seven scenes from the Stations of the Cross. The first shows Christ being condemned by Pontius Pilate, while the second is Christ carrying his cross. The third sculpture illustrates Christ falling under his cross, supported by Simon of Cyrene. The next tableau is of Christ meeting his mother and then having his clothing removed. The final representations as you climb the steps towards the church are of Christ being nailed to the cross and then his death, which is displayed on the gable of the north porch. In the southwestern corner of the churchyard a well rises. This is used as a site for well dressing each year in May. The screen and gates at the entrance to the forecourt of the church was built in 1814 by Jeffrey Wyatt. Organ The church has a large three manual pipe organ. The earliest parts of the organ date from ca. 1680 by Renatus Harris, but there is later work by Young, Richard Seede and Vowles. In 1923 the organ was rebuilt by William Hill & Sons and Norman and Beard.

History Acknowledged as the equal oldest rugby club in the North East of Scotland, (founded in 1871), AURFC has had a long and successful history producing both Scotland and British Lions players. Its traditional playing venue has been Kings Playing Fields right in the heart of old Aberdeen and the centre of campus for the University of Aberdeen, the fifth oldest university in Britain. It was not until 1882 that AURFC affiliated to the Scottish Rugby Union, it was the 17th club to join the SRU structure and the first club north of Edinburgh to join after the University of St Andrews RFC, which is one of the founder members of the Scottish Rugby Union.LIST OF MEMBER CLUBS SHOWING SENIORITY IN MEMBERSHIP Scottish Rugby Union University rugby is exceptionally important to Scottish Rugby with one quarter of the oldest teams in Scotland being university based. Decline and rebirth AURFC was disciplined by the Scottish Rugby Union for not fulfilling fixtures in the late 1990s. This resulted in the club being removed from the SRU league structure and forced to start from the bottom division. This was the lowest point in the club's long and distinguished history. With Aberdeen Grammar being demoted from the Scottish Premier league a void of high class rugby teams in Aberdeen existed and resulted in many university players returning from clubs to play for AURFC. Several seasons of straight promotions in the beginning of the new century has seen the team rise to Caledonian Division League 1CALEDONIA DIVISION 1 Scottish Rugby and also a return to the first division of the Scottish Universities Sport and BUCS Leagues and won Division 1A in 2010. Achievements The club's achievements have been considerable. Most notably was the 2007/08 Scottish Hydro Electric Scottish Rugby Union Plate victory at Murrayfield. This was the first time a university side has ever reached the final of an SRU competition. They followed up this success in season 2008/09 when they successful defended their title with a 33-10 win against Duns. In the same year the university 1st XV was promoted to Division 1A and narrowly missed out on winning the league coming in second place, but in 2010 the 1st XV won Scotland's top University league. The real halcyon period for AURFC was in the 70's when under the tutelage of Mal Reid they dominated University rugby in Scotland winning seven championships and providing countless players and captains for Scottish Universities. In 1975, the Scottish Universities team that beat England away had 10 Aberdeen players in the fifteen. Affiliations AURFC is a full member of Aberdeen University Sports Union and the Scottish Rugby Union. Notable players The club throughout history has boasted some impressive individual rugby players and have represented Scotland and the British and Irish Lions. Since the dawn of the professional era, the club has not had any Scottish international or British Lions players again but annually boasts several age group Scottish internationals and in 2008/09 had 15 players selected for the Scottish Universities squad. * Ronald S.

Career Boden was born in Sheffield. In 2008, Boden was loaned out from Sheffield United to play five matches for IFK Mariehamn in the Finnish Premier Division. Boden left the Åland islands for England and Chesterfield after his stint at the Mariehamn based club. In October 2011 Boden moved to Macclesfield Town on a one-month loan. He was offered a new one-year contract by Chesterfield in May 2012 which Boden accepted.

Dalai Lamas are important monks of the Gelug school, the newest school of Tibetan Buddhism, which was formally headed by the Ganden Tripas. From the time of the 5th Dalai Lama to 1959, the central government of Tibet, the Ganden Phodrang, invested the position of Dalai Lama with temporal duties.Buswell, Robert E.; Lopez, Donald S., Jr. (2013). The Princeton dictionary of Buddhism. Princeton: Princeton University Press. . Entries on \\"Dalai Lama\\" and \\"Dga' ldan pho brang\\". The 14th Dalai Lama was born in Taktser, Tibet. He was selected as the tulku of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937 and formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama in a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939. On 26 January 1940, the Regent Reting Rinpoche requested the Central Government to exempt Tenzin Gyatso from the lot-drawing process of the Golden Urn to become the 14th Dalai Lama. The request was approved by the Central Government. His enthronement ceremony as the Dalai Lama was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940 and he eventually assumed full temporal (political) duties on 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, after the People's Republic of China's occupation of Tibet. The Gelug school's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the Tibet Autonomous Region, just as the nascent PRC wished to assert control over it. During the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the Dalai Lama fled to India, where he currently lives as a refugee. He has traveled the world and has spoken about the welfare of Tibetans, environment, economics, women's rights, nonviolence, interfaith dialogue, physics, astronomy, Buddhism and science, cognitive neuroscience, reproductive health and sexuality, along with various topics of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist teachings. A recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 and the US Congressional Gold Medal in 2006, Time magazine named him one of the \\"Children of Mahatma Gandhi\\" and Gandhi's spiritual heir to nonviolence.  Early life and background  Lhamo Thondup was born on 6 July 1935 to a farming and horse trading family in the small hamlet of Taktser, or Chija TagtserA 60-Point Commentary on the Chinese Government Publication: A Collection of Historical Archives of Tibet, DIIR Publications, Dharamsala, November 2008: \\"Chija Tagtser born holy precious child Lhamo Dhondup ... the holy reincarnate child in Chija Tagtser.\\" (), at the edge of the traditional Tibetan region of Amdo in Qinghai Province.Thomas Laird, The Story of Tibet. Conversations with the Dalai Lama, Grove Press: New York, 2006. His family was of Monguor extraction.Hill, Nathan. 'Review of Sam van Schaik. Tibet: A History. London and New York: Yale University Press, 2011.' http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/13173/1/Hill_rv_2012_van_Schaik_review.pdf \\"Finally, the remark that 'Yonten Gyatso ... remains the only non-Tibetan to have held the role of Dalai Lama' (p. 177) presents a Monpa (sixth Dalai lama), and a Monguor (fourteenth Dalai Lama) as Tibetan although neither spoke Tibetan natively.\\" He was one of seven siblings to survive childhood. The eldest was his sister Tsering Dolma, eighteen years his senior. His eldest brother, Thupten Jigme Norbu, had been recognised at the age of eight as the reincarnation of the high Lama Taktser Rinpoche. His sister, Jetsun Pema, spent most of her adult life on the Tibetan Children's Villages project. The Dalai Lama has said that his first language was \\"a broken Xining language which was (a dialect of) the Chinese language\\", a form of Central Plains Mandarin, and his family did not speak the Tibetan language.Thomas Laird, The Story of Tibet: Conversations With the Dalai Lama, p. 262 (2007) \\"At that time in my village\\", he said, \\"we spoke a broken Chinese. As a child, I spoke Chinese first, but it was a broken Xining language which was (a dialect of) the Chinese language.\\" \\"So your first language\\", I responded, \\"was a broken Chinese regional dialect, which we might call Xining Chinese. It was not Tibetan. You learned Tibetan when you came to Lhasa.\\" \\"Yes\\", he answered, \\"that is correct...\\"Politically incorrect tourism, The Economist, 26 February 2009: \\"When the Dalai Lama was born, the region, regarded by Tibetans as part of Amdo, a province of their historic homeland, was under the control of a Muslim warlord, Ma Bufang. The Dalai Lama and his family didn't learn Tibetan until they moved to Lhasa in 1939.\\" The Dalai Lama as a child Following reported signs and visions, three search teams were sent out to the north- east, the east, and the south-east to locate the new incarnation when the boy who was to become the 14th Dalai Lama was about two years old.Bell 1946, p. 397. Sir Basil Gould, British delegate to Lhasa in 1936, related his account of the north-eastern team to Sir Charles Alfred Bell, former British resident in Lhasa and friend of the 13th Dalai Lama. Amongst other omens, the head of the embalmed body of the thirteenth Dalai Lama, at first facing south-east, had turned to face the north-east, indicating, it was interpreted, the direction in which his successor would be found. The Regent, Reting Rinpoche, shortly afterwards had a vision at the sacred lake of Lhamo La-tso which he interpreted as Amdo being the region to search. This vision was also interpreted to refer to a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it to a hill to the east, opposite which stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The team, led by Kewtsang Rinpoche, went first to meet the Panchen Lama, who had been stuck in Jyekundo, in northern Kham. The Panchen Lama had been investigating births of unusual children in the area ever since the death of the 13th Dalai Lama.Laird 2006, p. 265. He gave Kewtsang the names of three boys whom he had discovered and identified as candidates. Within a year the Panchen Lama had died. Two of his three candidates were crossed off the list but the third, a \\"fearless\\" child, the most promising, was from Taktser village, which, as in the vision, was on a hill, at the end of a trail leading to Taktser from the great Kumbum Monastery with its gilded, turquoise roof. There they found a house, as interpreted from the vision—the house where Lhamo Dhondup lived. The 14th Dalai Lama claims that at the time, the village of Taktser stood right on the \\"real border\\" between the region of Amdo and China.Laird 2006, pp. 262–263. When the team visited, posing as pilgrims, its leader, a Sera Lama, pretended to be the servant and sat separately in the kitchen. He held an old mala that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama, and the boy Lhamo Dhondup, aged two, approached and asked for it. The monk said \\"if you know who I am, you can have it.\\" The child said \\"Sera Lama, Sera Lama\\" and spoke with him in a Lhasa accent, in a dialect the boy's mother could not understand. The next time the party returned to the house, they revealed their real purpose and asked permission to subject the boy to certain tests. One test consisted of showing him various pairs of objects, one of which had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama and one which had not. In every case, he chose the Dalai Lama's own objects and rejected the others.Laird 2006, pp. 265–266. House where the 14th Dalai Lama was born in Taktser, Amdo From 1936 the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang ruled Qinghai as its governor under the nominal authority of the Republic of China central government. According to an interview with the 14th Dalai Lama, in the 1930s, Ma Bufang had seized this north-east corner of Amdo in the name of Chiang Kai-shek's weak government and incorporated it into the Chinese province of Qinghai.Laird 2006, p. 262. Before going to Taktser, Kewtsang had gone to Ma Bufang to pay his respects. When Ma Bufang heard a candidate had been found in Taktser, he had the family brought to him in Xining.Mullin 2001, p. 459. He first demanded proof that the boy was the Dalai Lama, but the Lhasa government, though informed by Kewtsang that this was the one, told Kewtsang to say he had to go to Lhasa for further tests with other candidates. They knew that if he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, the Chinese government would insist on sending a large army escort with him, which would then stay in Lhasa and refuse to budge.Bell 1946, p. 398. Ma Bufang, together with Kumbum Monastery, then refused to allow him to depart unless he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, but withdrew this demand in return for 100,000 Chinese dollars ransom in silver to be shared amongst them, to let them go to Lhasa.Richardson 1984, p. 152. Kewtsang managed to raise this, but the family was only allowed to move from Xining to Kumbum when a further demand was made for another 330,000 dollars ransom: one hundred thousand each for government officials, the commander-in-chief, and the Kumbum Monastery; twenty thousand for the escort; and only ten thousand for Ma Bufang himself, he said.Bell 1946, pp. 398–399. Two years of diplomatic wrangling followed before it was accepted by Lhasa that the ransom had to be paid to avoid the Chinese getting involved and escorting him to Lhasa with a large army.Richardson 1984, pp. 152–153. Meanwhile, the boy was kept at Kumbum where two of his brothers were already studying as monks and recognised incarnate lamas.Laird 2006, p. 267. The payment of 300,000 silver dollars was then advanced by Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa. They paid Ma Bufang on behalf of the Tibetan government against promissory notes to be redeemed, with interest, in Lhasa.Richardson 1984, p. 153. The 20,000-dollar fee for an escort was dropped, since the Muslim merchants invited them to join their caravan for protection; Ma Bufang sent 20 of his soldiers with them and was paid from both sides since the Chinese government granted him another 50,000 dollars for the expenses of the journey. Furthermore, the Indian government helped the Tibetans raise the ransom funds by affording them import concessions. Released from Kumbum, on 21 July 1939 the party travelled across Tibet in an epic journey to Lhasa in the large Muslim caravan with Lhamo Thondup, now 4 years old, riding with his brother Lobsang in a special palanquin carried by two mules, two years after being discovered. As soon as they were out of Ma Bufang's area, he was officially declared to be the 14th Dalai Lama by the Central Government of Tibet, and after ten weeks of travel he arrived in Lhasa on 8 October 1939.Laird 2006, pp. 268–269. The ordination (pabbajja) and giving of the monastic name of Tenzin Gyatso were handled by Reting Rinpoche. There was very limited Chinese involvement at this time. Tibetan Buddhists normally refer to him as Yishin Norbu (Wish-Fulfilling Gem), Kyabgon (Saviour), or just Kundun (Presence). His devotees, as well as much of the Western world, often call him His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the style employed on the Dalai Lama's website. According to the Dalai Lama, he had a succession of tutors in Tibet including Reting Rinpoche, Tathag Rinpoche, Ling Rinpoche and lastly Trijang Rinpoche, who became junior tutor when he was nineteen. At the age of 11 he met the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer, who became his videographer and tutor about the world outside Lhasa. The two remained friends until Harrer's death in 2006. In 1959, at the age of 23, he took his final examination at Lhasa's Jokhang Temple during the annual Monlam or Prayer Festival. He passed with honours and was awarded the Lharampa degree, the highest-level geshe degree, roughly equivalent to a doctorate in Buddhist philosophy.  Life as the Dalai Lama  Lhasa's Potala Palace, today a UNESCO World Heritage site, pictured in 2006 Historically the Dalai Lamas or their regents held political and religious leadership over Tibet from Lhasa with varying degrees of influence depending on the regions of Tibet and periods of history. This began with the 5th Dalai Lama's rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705–1750), during which period the Dalai Lamas headed the Tibetan government or Ganden Phodrang. Until 1912 however, when the 13th Dalai Lama declared the complete independence of Tibet, their rule was generally subject to patronage and protection of firstly Mongol kings (1642–1720) and then the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1720–1912). In 1939, at the age of four, the present Dalai Lama was taken in a procession of lamas to Lhasa. The Dalai Lama's childhood was then spent between the Potala Palace and Norbulingka, his summer residence, both of which are now UNESCO World Heritage sites. The Kuomintang government ratified the 14th Dalai Lama and a Kuomintang representative, General Wu Zhongxin, presided over the ceremony. The British Representative Sir Basil Gould, who was also at the ceremony, disputes the Chinese claim to have presided over it. He criticised the Chinese account as follows: Tibetan scholar Nyima Gyaincain wrote that based on Tibetan tradition, there was no such thing as presiding over an event, but two things are clear, first, the word \\"主持 (preside or organize)\\" was used in many places in communication documents. The meaning of the word was different than what we understand today. Second, Wu Zhongxin spent a lot of time and energy on the event, his effect of presiding over or organizing the event was very obvious. However, according to Goldstein: Chiang Kai Shek ordered Ma Bufang to put his Muslim soldiers on alert for an invasion of Tibet in 1942. Ma Bufang complied, and moved several thousand troops to the border with Tibet. Chiang also threatened the Tibetans with aerial bombardment if they worked with the Japanese. Ma Bufang attacked the Tibetan Buddhist Tsang monastery in 1941. He also constantly attacked the Labrang monastery. In October 1950 the army of the People's Republic of China marched to the edge of the Dalai Lama's territory and sent a delegation after defeating a legion of the Tibetan army in warlord-controlled Kham. On 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, the 14th Dalai Lama was enthroned formally as the temporal ruler of Tibet.  Cooperation and conflicts with the People's Republic of China  14th Dalai Lama arrives at Beijing railway station with the 10th Panchen Lama, 1954 Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai meeting with Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama to celebrate Tibetan New Year, 1955 The Panchen Lama and Dalai Lama had many conflicts throughout Tibetan history. Dalai Lama's formal rule was brief. He sent a delegation to Beijing, which ratified the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. He would later claim that the delegation did so without his authorization.Gyatso, Tenzin, Dalai Lama XIV, interview, 25 July 1981.Goldstein, Melvyn C., A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951, University of California Press, 1989, pp. 812–813. He worked with the Chinese government: in September 1954, together with the 10th Panchen Lama he went to the Chinese capital to meet Mao Zedong and attend the first session of the National People's Congress as a delegate, primarily discussing China's constitution.Goldstein, M.C., A History of Modern Tibet, Volume 2 – The Calm before the Storm: 1951–1955, p. 493.Ngapoi recalls the founding of the TAR, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, China View, 30 August 2005. On 27 September 1954, the Dalai Lama was selected as a Vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,Goldstein, M.C., A History of Modern Tibet, Volume 2 – The Calm before the Storm: 1951–1955, p. 496. a post he officially held until 1964. In 1956, on a trip to India to celebrate the Buddha's Birthday, the Dalai Lama asked the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, if he would allow him political asylum should he choose to stay. Nehru discouraged this as a provocation against peace, and reminded him of the Indian Government's non-interventionist stance agreed upon with its 1954 treaty with China. Long called a \\"splitist\\" and \\"traitor\\" by China, the Dalai Lama has attempted formal talks over Tibet's status in China. In 2019, after the United States passed a law requiring the US to deny visas to Chinese officials in charge of implementing policies that restrict foreign access to Tibet, the US Ambassador to China \\"encouraged the Chinese government to engage in substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, to seek a settlement that resolves differences\\". The Chinese Foreign Ministry has warned the US and other countries to \\"shun\\" the Dalai Lama during visits and often uses trade negotiations and human rights talks as an incentive to do so. China sporadically bans images of the Dalai Lama and arrests citizens for owning photos of him in Tibet. Tibet Autonomous Region government job candidates must strongly denounce the Dalai Lama, as announced on the Tibet Autonomous Region government's online education platform, \\"Support the (Communist) Party’s leadership, resolutely implement the [Chinese Communist] Party’s line, line of approach, policies, and the guiding ideology of Tibet work in the new era; align ideologically, politically, and in action with the Party Central Committee; oppose any splittist tendencies; expose and criticize the Dalai Lama; safeguard the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity and take a firm stand on political issues, taking a clear and distinct stand\\". The Dalai Lama is a target of Chinese state sponsored hacking. Security experts claim \\"targeting Tibetan activists is a strong indicator of official Chinese government involvement\\" since economic information is the primary goal of private Chinese hackers. In 2009 the personal office of the Dalai Lama asked researchers at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto to check its computers for malicious software. This led to uncovering GhostNet, a large-scale cyber spying operation which infiltrated at least 1,295 computers in 103 countries, including embassies, foreign ministries, other government offices, and organizations affiliated with the Dalai Lama in India, Brussels, London and New York, and believed to be focusing on the governments of South and Southeast Asia. A second cyberspy network, Shadow Network, was discovered by the same researchers in 2010. Stolen documents included a years worth of the Dalai Lama's personal email, and classified government material relating to Indian, West Africa, the Russian Federation, the Middle East, and NATO. \\"Sophisticated\\" hackers were linked to universities in China, Beijing again denied involvement. Chinese hackers posing as The New York Times, Amnesty International and other organization's reporters targeted the private office of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Parliament members, and Tibetan nongovernmental organizations, among others, in 2019.  Exile to India  Potala. The empty vestment placed on the throne symbolises his absence At the outset of the 1959 Tibetan uprising, fearing for his life, the Dalai Lama and his retinue fled Tibet with the help of the CIA's Special Activities Division,The CIA's Secret War in Tibet, Kenneth Conboy, James Morrison, The University Press of Kansas, 2002. crossing into India on 30 March 1959, reaching Tezpur in Assam on 18 April.Richardson (1984), p. 210. Some time later he set up the Government of Tibet in Exile in Dharamshala, India,\\"Witness: Reporting on the Dalai Lama's escape to India.\\" Peter Jackson. Reuters. 27 February 2009.Witness: Reporting on the Dalai Lama's escape to India Reuters which is often referred to as \\"Little Lhasa\\". After the founding of the government in exile he re- established the approximately 80,000 Tibetan refugees who followed him into exile in agricultural settlements. He created a Tibetan educational system in order to teach the Tibetan children the language, history, religion, and culture. The Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts was established in 1959 and the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies became the primary university for Tibetans in India in 1967. He supported the refounding of 200 monasteries and nunneries in an attempt to preserve Tibetan Buddhist teachings and the Tibetan way of life. The Dalai Lama appealed to the United Nations on the rights of Tibetans. This appeal resulted in three resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in 1959, 1961, and 1965, all before the People's Republic was allowed representation at the United Nations. The resolutions called on China to respect the human rights of Tibetans. In 1963, he promulgated a democratic constitution which is based upon the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, creating an elected parliament and an administration to champion his cause. In 1970, he opened the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Dharamshala which houses over 80,000 manuscripts and important knowledge resources related to Tibetan history, politics and culture. It is considered one of the most important institutions for Tibetology in the world. In 2016, there were demands from Indian citizens and politicians of different political parties to confer the Dalai Lama the prestigious Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honour of India, which has only been awarded to a non-Indian citizen twice in its history.  International advocacy  The Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu The alt= At the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in 1987 in Washington, D.C., the Dalai Lama gave a speech outlining his ideas for the future status of Tibet. The plan called for Tibet to become a democratic \\"zone of peace\\" without nuclear weapons, and with support for human rights. The plan would come to be known as the \\"Strasbourg proposal\\", because the Dalai Lama expanded on the plan at Strasbourg on 15 June 1988. There, he proposed the creation of a self-governing Tibet \\"in association with the People's Republic of China.\\" This would have been pursued by negotiations with the PRC government, but the plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991. The Dalai Lama has indicated that he wishes to return to Tibet only if the People's Republic of China agrees not to make any precondition for his return.Interview with The Guardian, 5 September 2003 In the 1970s, the then-Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping set China's sole return requirement to the Dalai Lama as that he \\"must [come back] as a Chinese citizen ... that is, patriotism\\". The Dalai Lama celebrated his seventieth birthday on 6 July 2005. About 10,000 Tibetan refugees, monks and foreign tourists gathered outside his home. Patriarch Alexius II of the Russian Orthodox Church alleged positive relations with Buddhists. However, later that year, the Russian state prevented the Dalai Lama from fulfilling an invitation to the traditionally Buddhist republic of Kalmykia.Fagan, Geraldine. \\"Russia: How Many Missionaries Now Denied Visas'.\\" Forum 18 News Service. Vol. 7. 2005. Then President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), Chen Shui-bian, attended an evening celebrating the Dalai Lama's birthday at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei. In October 2008 in Japan, the Dalai Lama addressed the 2008 Tibetan violence that had erupted and that the Chinese government accused him of fomenting. He responded that he had \\"lost faith\\" in efforts to negotiate with the Chinese government, and that it was \\"up to the Tibetan people\\" to decide what to do. Thirty Taiwanese indigenous peoples protested against the Dalai Lama during his visit to Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot and denounced it as politically motivated. The Dalai Lama is an advocate for a world free of nuclear weapons, and currently serves on the Advisory Council of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation. The Dalai Lama has voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.  Teaching activities, public talks  Gyatso during a visit to Washington, D.C. in 1997 Despite becoming 80 years old in 2015 he maintains a busy international lecture and teaching schedule. His public talks and teachings are usually webcast live in multiple languages, via an inviting organisation's website, or on the Dalai Lama's own website. Scores of his past teaching videos can be viewed there, as well as public talks, conferences, interviews, dialogues and panel discussions. The Dalai Lama's best known teaching subject is the Kalachakra tantra which, as of 2014, he had conferred a total of 33 times, most often in India's upper Himalayan regions but also in the Western world. The Kalachakra (Wheel of Time) is one of the most complex teachings of Buddhism, sometimes taking two weeks to confer, and he often confers it on very large audiences, up to 200,000 students and disciples at a time. The Dalai Lama is the author of numerous books on Buddhism, many of them on general Buddhist subjects but also including books on particular topics like Dzogchen, a Nyingma practice. In his essay \\"The Ethic of Compassion\\" (1999), the Dalai Lama expresses his belief that if we only reserve compassion for those that we love, we are ignoring the responsibility of sharing these characteristics of respect and empathy with those we do not have relationships with, which cannot allow us to \\"cultivate love.\\" He elaborates upon this idea by writing that although it takes time to develop a higher level of compassion, eventually we will recognize that the quality of empathy will become a part of life and promote our quality as humans and inner strength. He frequently accepts requests from students to visit various countries worldwide in order to give teachings to large Buddhist audiences, teachings that are usually based on classical Buddhist texts and commentaries, and most often those written by the 17 pandits or great masters of the Nalanda tradition, such as Nagarjuna, Kamalashila, Shantideva, Atisha, Ayradeva and so on. The Dalai Lama's main teaching room at Dharamshala Dalai Lama conferring Kalachakra initiation at Bodh Gaya, India, December 1985 Overview of teaching venue at Bodh Gaya Kalachakra, 1985 The Dalai Lama refers to himself as a follower of these Nalanda masters, in fact he often asserts that 'Tibetan Buddhism' is based on the Buddhist tradition of Nalanda monastery in ancient India, since the texts written by those 17 Nalanda pandits or masters, to whom he has composed a poem of invocation, were brought to Tibet and translated into Tibetan when Buddhism was first established there and have remained central to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism ever since. As examples of other teachings, in London in 1984 he was invited to give teachings on the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising, and on Dzogchen, which he gave at Camden Town Hall; in 1988 he was in London once more to give a series of lectures on Tibetan Buddhism in general, called 'A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism'. Again in London in 1996 he taught the Four Noble Truths, the basis and foundation of Buddhism accepted by all Buddhists, at the combined invitation of 27 different Buddhist organisations of all schools and traditions belonging to the Network of Buddhist Organisations UK. In India, the Dalai Lama gives religious teachings and talks in Dharamsala and numerous other locations including the monasteries in the Tibetan refugee settlements, in response to specific requests from Tibetan monastic institutions, Indian academic, religious and business associations, groups of students and individual/private/lay devotees. In India, no fees are charged to attend these teachings since costs are covered by requesting sponsors. When he travels abroad to give teachings there is usually a ticket fee calculated by the inviting organization to cover the costs involved and any surplus is normally to be donated to recognised charities. He has frequently visited and lectured at colleges and universities, some of which have conferred honorary degrees upon him. Dozens of videos of recorded webcasts of the Dalai Lama's public talks on general subjects for non-Buddhists like peace, happiness and compassion, modern ethics, the environment, economic and social issues, gender, the empowerment of women and so forth can be viewed in his office's archive.  Interfaith dialogue  The Dalai Lama met Pope Paul VI at the Vatican in 1973. He met Pope John Paul II in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990, and 2003. In 1990, he met a delegation of Jewish teachers in Dharamshala for an extensive interfaith dialogue.Kamenetz, Rodger (1994)The Jew in the Lotus Harper Collins: 1994. He has since visited Israel three times, and in 2006 met the Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 2006, he met Pope Benedict XVI privately. He has met the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Robert Runcie, and other leaders of the Anglican Church in London, Gordon B. Hinckley, who at the time was the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), as well as senior Eastern Orthodox Church, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, and Sikh officials. The Dalai Lama is also currently a member of the Board of World Religious Leaders as part of The Elijah Interfaith Institute and participated in the Third Meeting of the Board of World Religious Leaders in Amritsar, India, on 26 November 2007 to discuss the topic of Love and Forgiveness. In 2009, the Dalai Lama inaugurated an interfaith \\"World Religions-Dialogue and Symphony\\" conference at Gujarat's Mahuva religions\\", according to Morari Bapu. In 2010, the Dalai Lama, joined by a panel of scholars, launched the Common Ground Project, in Bloomington, Indiana (USA), which was planned by himself and Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad of Jordan during several years of personal conversations. The project is based on the book Common Ground between Islam and Buddhism.  Interest in science, and Mind and Life Institute  The Dalai Lama's lifelong interest in science and technology dates from his childhood in Lhasa, Tibet, when he was fascinated by mechanical objects like clocks, watches, telescopes, film projectors, clockwork soldiers and motor cars, and loved to repair, disassemble and reassemble them. Once, observing the Moon through a telescope as a child, he realised it was a crater-pocked lump of rock and not a heavenly body emitting its own light as Tibetan cosmologists had taught him. He has also said that had he not been brought up as a monk he would probably have been an engineer. On his first trip to the west in 1973 he asked to visit Cambridge University's astrophysics department in the UK and he sought out renowned scientists such as Sir Karl Popper, David Bohm and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who taught him the basics of science. The Dalai Lama sees important common ground between science and Buddhism in having the same approach to challenge dogma on the basis of empirical evidence that comes from observation and analysis of phenomena. His growing wish to develop meaningful scientific dialogue to explore the Buddhism and science interface led to invitations for him to attend relevant conferences on his visits to the west, including the Alpbach Symposia on Consciousness in 1983 where he met and had discussions with the late Chilean neuroscientist Francisco J. Varela. Also in 1983, the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science, was already considering the idea of facilitating for him a serious dialogue with a selection of appropriate scientists. In 1984 Engle formally offered to the Dalai Lama's office to organise a week-long, formal dialogue for him with a suitable team of scientists, provided that the Dalai Lama would wish to fully participate in such a dialogue. Within 48 hours the Dalai Lama confirmed to Engle that he was \\"truly interested in participating in something substantial about science\\" so Engle proceeded with launching the project. Francisco Varela, having heard about Engle's proposal, then called him to tell him of his earlier discussions with the Dalai Lama and to offer his scientific collaboration to the project. Engle accepted, and Varela assisted him to assemble his team of six specialist scientists for the first 'Mind and Life' dialogue on the cognitive sciences, which was eventually held with the Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamsala in 1987. This five-day event was so successful that at the end the Dalai Lama told Engle he would very much like to repeat it again in the future. Engle then started work on arranging a second dialogue, this time with neuroscientists in California, and the discussions from the first event were edited and published as Mind and Life's first book, \\"Gentle Bridges: Conversations with the Dalai Lama on the Sciences of Mind\\". As Mind and Life Institute's remit expanded, Engle formalised the organisation as a non-profit foundation after the third dialogue, held in 1990, which initiated the undertaking of neurobiological research programmes in the United States under scientific conditions. Over the ensuing decades, as of 2014 at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various world-renowned scientists have followed, held in various countries and covering diverse themes, from the nature of consciousness to cosmology and from quantum mechanics to the neuroplasticity of the brain. Sponsors and partners in these dialogues have included the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, the Mayo Clinic, and Zurich University. Apart from time spent teaching Buddhism and fulfilling responsibilities to his Tibetan followers, the Dalai Lama has probably spent, and continues to spend, more of his time and resources investigating the interface between Buddhism and science through the ongoing series of Mind and Life dialogues and its spin-offs than on any other single activity. As the institute's Cofounder and the Honorary chairman he has personally presided over and participated in all its dialogues, which continue to expand worldwide. These activities have given rise to dozens of DVD sets of the dialogues and books he has authored on them such as Ethics for the New Millennium and The Universe in a Single Atom, as well as scientific papers and university research programmes. On the Tibetan and Buddhist side, science subjects have been added to the curriculum for Tibetan monastic educational institutions and scholarship. On the Western side, university and research programmes initiated by these dialogues and funded with millions of dollars in grants from the Dalai Lama Trust include the Emory-Tibet Partnership, Stanford School of Medicine's Centre for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARES) and the Centre for Investigating Healthy Minds, amongst others. In 2019, Emory University's Center for Contemplative Sciences and Compassion- Based Ethics, in partnership with The Dalai Lama Trust and the Vana Foundation of India, launched an international SEE Learning (Social, Emotional and Ethical Learning) program in New Delhi, India, a school curriculum for all classes from kindergarten to Std XII that builds on psychologist Daniel Goleman's work on emotional intelligence in the early 1990s. SEE learning focuses on developing critical thinking, ethical reasoning and compassion and stresses on commonalities rather than on the differences. In particular, the Mind and Life Education Humanities & Social Sciences initiatives have been instrumental in developing the emerging field of Contemplative Science, by researching, for example, the effects of contemplative practice on the human brain, behaviour and biology. In his 2005 book The Universe in a Single Atom and elsewhere, and to mark his commitment to scientific truth and its ultimate ascendancy over religious belief, unusually for a major religious leader the Dalai Lama advises his Buddhist followers: \\"If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims.\\" He has also cited examples of archaic Buddhist ideas he has abandoned himself on this basis. These activities have even had an impact in the Chinese capital. In 2013 an 'academic dialogue' with a Chinese scientist, a Tibetan 'living Buddha' and a Professor of Religion took place in Beijing. Entitled \\"High-end dialogue: ancient Buddhism and modern science\\" it addressed the same considerations that interest the Dalai Lama, described as 'discussing about the similarities between Buddhism and modern science'.  Personal meditation practice  The Dalai Lama uses various meditation techniques, including analytic meditation. He has said that the aim of meditation is \\"to maintain a very full state of alertness and mindfulness, and then try to see the natural state of your consciousness.\\"  Social instances   Abortion  The Dalai Lama has said that, from the perspective of the Buddhist precepts, abortion is an act of killing.Gary Stivers Dalai Lama meets Idaho’s religious leaders, sunvalleyonline.com, 15 September 2005 He has also clarified that in certain cases abortion could be considered ethically acceptable \\"if the unborn child will be retarded or if the birth will create serious problems for the parent\\", which could only be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Democracy, nonviolence, religious harmony, and Tibet's relationship with India  Tenzin Gyatso in Vienna, Austria, in 2012 The Dalai Lama says that he is active in spreading India's message of nonviolence and religious harmony throughout the world. \\"I am the messenger of India's ancient thoughts the world over.\\" He has said that democracy has deep roots in India. He says he considers India the master and Tibet its disciple, as great scholars went from India to Tibet to teach Buddhism. He has noted that millions of people lost their lives in violence and the economies of many countries were ruined due to conflicts in the 20th century. \\"Let the 21st century be a century of tolerance and dialogue.\\"I'm messenger of India's ancient thoughts: Dalai Lama, I'm messenger of India's ancient thoughts: The Dalai Lama – Hindustan Times, Dalai Lama Story Page – USATODAY.com , Canada Tibet CommitteeNewsroomWTN \\"I'm messenger of India's ancient thoughts\\": Dalai Lama; 14 November 2009; Itanagar. Indian Express Newspaper; Hindustan Times Newspaper; PTI News; Dalai Lama Quotes Page – USATODAY.com; Official website; Signs of change emanating within China: Dalai Lama; By Shoumojit Banerjee; 27 May 2010; The Hindu newspaper In 1993, the Dalai Lama attended the World Conference on Human Rights and made a speech titled \\"Human Rights and Universal Responsibility\\". In 2001, in response to a question from a Seattle schoolgirl, the Dalai Lama said that it is permissible to shoot someone in self-defense (if the person was \\"trying to kill you\\") and he emphasized that the shot should not be fatal. In 2013, the Dalai Lama criticised Buddhist monks' attacks on Muslims in Myanmar and rejected violence by Buddhists, saying: \\"Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance, compassion. If from one corner of your mind, some emotion makes you want to hit, or want to kill, then please remember Buddha's faith. ... All problems must be solved through dialogue, through talk. The use of violence is outdated, and never solves problems.\\" In May 2013, he said \\"Really, killing people in the name of religion is unthinkable, very sad.\\" In May 2015, the Dalai Lama called on Myanmar's Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to do more to help the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, said that he had urged Suu Kyi to address the Rohingyas' plight in two previous private meetings and had been rebuffed. In 2017, after Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo died of organ failure while in Chinese government custody, the Dalai Lama said he was \\"deeply saddened\\" and that he believed that Liu's \\"unceasing efforts in the cause of freedom will bear fruit before long.\\"\\"His Holiness the Dalai Lama Deeply Saddened by Liu Xiaobo's Passing…\\". The 14th Dalai Lama. 18 July 2017. In October 2020, the Dalai Lama stated that he did not support Tibetan independence and hoped to visit China as a Nobel Prize winner. He said \\"I prefer the concept of a 'republic' in the People's Republic of China. In the concept of republic, ethnic minorities are like Tibetans, The Mongols, Manchus, and Xinjiang Uyghurs, we can live in harmony\\".  Diet and animal welfare  The Dalai Lama advocates compassion for animals and frequently urges people to try vegetarianism or at least reduce their consumption of meat. In Tibet, where historically meat was the most common food, most monks historically have been omnivores, including the Dalai Lamas. The Fourteenth Dalai Lama was raised in a meat-eating family but converted to vegetarianism after arriving in India, where vegetables are much more easily available and vegetarianism is widespread. He spent many years as a vegetarian, but after contracting hepatitis in India and suffering from weakness, his doctors told him to return to eating meat which he now does twice a week. This attracted public attention when, during a visit to the White House, he was offered a vegetarian menu but declined by replying, as he is known to do on occasion when dining in the company of non-vegetarians, \\"I'm a Tibetan monk, not a vegetarian\\". His own home kitchen, however, is completely vegetarian.  Economics  The Dalai Lama has referred to himself as a Marxist and has articulated criticisms of capitalism.Catherine Phillips (15 January 2015). ‘I Am Marxist’ Says Dalai Lama. Newsweek. Retrieved 16 January 2015. He reports hearing of communism when he was very young, but only in the context of the destruction of Communist Mongolia. It was only when he went on his trip to Beijing that he learned about Marxist theory from his interpreter Baba Phuntsog Wangyal. At that time, he reports, \\"I was so attracted to Marxism, I even expressed my wish to become a Communist Party member\\", citing his favorite concepts of self-sufficiency and equal distribution of wealth. He does not believe that China implemented \\"true Marxist policy\\", and thinks the historical communist states such as the Soviet Union \\"were far more concerned with their narrow national interests than with the Workers' International\\". Moreover, he believes one flaw of historically \\"Marxist regimes\\" is that they place too much emphasis on destroying the ruling class, and not enough on compassion. Despite this, he finds Marxism superior to capitalism, believing the latter is only concerned with \\"how to make profits\\", whereas the former has \\"moral ethics\\". Stating in 1993:  Environment  The Dalai Lama is outspoken in his concerns about environmental problems, frequently giving public talks on themes related to the environment. He has pointed out that many rivers in Asia originate in Tibet, and that the melting of Himalayan glaciers could affect the countries in which the rivers flow. He acknowledged official Chinese laws against deforestation in Tibet, but lamented they can be ignored due to possible corruption. He was quoted as saying \\"ecology should be part of our daily life\\"; personally, he takes showers instead of baths, and turns lights off when he leaves a room. Around 2005, he started campaigning for wildlife conservation, including by issuing a religious ruling against wearing tiger and leopard skins as garments. The Dalai Lama supports the anti- whaling position in the whaling controversy, but has criticized the activities of groups such as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (which carries out acts of what it calls aggressive nonviolence against property). Before the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, he urged national leaders to put aside domestic concerns and take collective action against climate change.  Sexuality  A monk since childhood, the Dalai Lama has said that sex offers fleeting satisfaction and leads to trouble later, while chastity offers a better life and \\"more independence, more freedom\\". He has said that problems arising from conjugal life sometimes even lead to suicide or murder. He has asserted that all religions have the same view about adultery. In his discussions of the traditional Buddhist view on appropriate sexual behavior, he explains the concept of \\"right organ in the right object at the right time\\", which historically has been interpreted as indicating that oral, manual and anal sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) are not appropriate in Buddhism or for Buddhists. However, he also says that in modern times all common, consensual sexual practices that do not cause harm to others are ethically acceptable and that society should accept and respect people who are gay or transgender from a secular point of view. In a 1994 interview with OUT Magazine, the Dalai Lama clarified his personal opinion on the matter by saying, \\"If someone comes to me and asks whether homosexuality is okay or not, I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then I think I would say, 'If two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay.'\\"OUT Magazine February/March 1994 However, when interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor Evan Solomon on CBC News: Sunday about whether homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism, the Dalai Lama responded that \\"it is sexual misconduct\\". In his 1996 book Beyond Dogma, he described a traditional Buddhist definition of an appropriate sexual act as follows: \\"A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else ... Homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact.\\"Beyond Dogma by the Dalai Lama He elaborated in 1997, explaining that the basis of that teaching was unknown to him. He also conveyed his own \\"willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic context\\".\\"Dalai Lama Urges 'Respect, Compassion, and Full Human Rights for All', including Gays\\". Conkin, Dennis. Bay Area Reporter, 19 June 1997. In 2006, the Dalai Lama has expressed concern at \\"reports of violence and discrimination against\\" LGBT people and urged \\"respect, tolerance and the full recognition of human rights for all\\".  Women's rights  In 2007, he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman: \\"If a woman reveals herself as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form.\\" In 2009, on gender equality and sexism, the Dalai Lama proclaimed at the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee: \\"I call myself a feminist. Isn't that what you call someone who fights for women's rights?\\" He also said that by nature, women are more compassionate \\"based on their biology and ability to nurture and birth children\\". He called on women to \\"lead and create a more compassionate world\\", citing the good works of nurses and mothers. At a 2014 appearance at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, the Dalai Lama said, \\"Since women have been shown to be more sensitive to others' suffering, their leadership may be more effective.\\" In 2015, he said in a BBC interview that if a female succeeded him, \\"that female must be attractive, otherwise it is not much use,\\" and when asked if he was joking, replied, \\"No. True!\\" He followed with a joke about his current success being due to his own appearance.  Health  In 2013, at the Culture of Compassion event in Derry, Northern Ireland, the Dalai Lama said that \\"Warm-heartedness is a key factor for healthy individuals, healthy families and healthy communities.\\"  Response to COVID-19  In a 2020 statement in Time magazine on the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dalai Lama said that the pandemic must be combated with compassion, empirical science, prayer, and the courage of healthcare workers. He emphasized \\"emotional disarmament\\" (seeing things with a clear and realistic perspective, without fear or rage) and wrote: \\"The outbreak of this terrible coronavirus has shown that what happens to one person can soon affect every other being. But it also reminds us that a compassionate or constructive act - whether working in hospitals or just observing social distancing - has the potential to help many.\\"https://time.com/5820613/dalai-lama-coronavirus-compassion/ https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/tribhuvandarbari/statement-by- the-dalai-lama-on-covid-19-tribhuvan-darbari-11255/  Immigration  In September 2018, speaking at a conference in Malmö, Sweden home to a large immigrant population, the Dalai Lama said \\"I think Europe belongs to the Europeans\\", but that Europe was also \\"morally responsible\\" for helping refugees and to \\"receive them, help them, educate them\\"; he does add that refugees \\"ultimately should rebuild their own country\\". Speaking to German reporters in 2016, the Dalai Lama said there are \\"too many\\" refugees in Europe, adding that \\"Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country.\\" He also said that \\"Germany is Germany\\".  Retirement and succession plans  In May 2011, the Dalai Lama retired from the Central Tibetan Administration. In September 2011, the Dalai Lama issued the following statement concerning his reincarnation: > When I am about ninety I will consult the high Lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist > traditions, the Tibetan public, and other concerned people who follow > Tibetan Buddhism, and re-evaluate whether the institution of the Dalai Lama > should continue or not. On that basis we will take a decision. If it is > decided that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should continue and there > is a need for the Fifteenth Dalai Lama to be recognized, responsibility for > doing so will primarily rest on the concerned officers of the Dalai Lama's > Gaden Phodrang Trust. They should consult the various heads of the Tibetan > Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are > linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. They should seek > advice and direction from these concerned beings and carry out the > procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition. I > shall leave clear written instructions about this. Bear in mind that, apart > from the reincarnation recognized through such legitimate methods, no > recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for > political ends by anyone, including those in the People's Republic of > China.Statement of His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, on > the Issue of His Reincarnation Website of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama > of Tibet 24 September 2011. In October 2011, the Dalai Lama repeated his statement in an interview with Canadian CTV News. He added that Chinese laws banning the selection of successors based on reincarnation will not impact his decisions. \\"Naturally my next life is entirely up to me. No one else. And also this is not a political matter,\\" he said in the interview. The Dalai Lama also added that he was not decided on whether he would reincarnate or be the last Dalai Lama. In an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag published on 7 September 2014 the Dalai Lama stated \\"the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose\\", and that \\"We had a Dalai Lama for almost five centuries. The 14th Dalai Lama now is very popular. Let us then finish with a popular Dalai Lama.\\" Gyatso has also expressed fear that the Chinese government would manipulate any reincarnation selection in order to choose a successor that would go along with their political goals. In response the Chinese government implied that it would select another Dalai Lama regardless of his decision.  CIA Tibetan program  In October 1998, the Dalai Lama's administration acknowledged that it received $1.7 million a year in the 1960s from the U.S. government through a Central Intelligence Agency program. When asked by CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus in 1995 to comment on the CIA Tibetan program, the Dalai Lama replied that though it helped the morale of those resisting the Chinese, \\"thousands of lives were lost in the resistance\\" and further, that \\"the U.S. Government had involved itself in his country's affairs not to help Tibet but only as a Cold War tactic to challenge the Chinese.\\" His administration's reception of CIA funding has become one of the grounds for some state-run Chinese newspapers to discredit him along with the Tibetan independence movement. In his autobiography Freedom in Exile, the Dalai Lama criticized the CIA again for supporting the Tibetan independence movement \\"not because they (the CIA) cared about Tibetan independence, but as part of their worldwide efforts to destabilize all communist governments\\". In 1999, the Dalai Lama said that the CIA Tibetan program had been harmful for Tibet because it was primarily aimed at serving American interests, and \\"once the American policy toward China changed, they stopped their help.\\"  Chinese criticisms   Ties to India  Stone Plaque at a plantation by Tenzin in Amaravathi The Chinese press has criticized the Dalai Lama for his close ties with India. His 2010 remarks at the International Buddhist Conference in Gujarat saying that he was \\"Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality\\" and referral to himself as a \\"son of India\\" in particular led the People's Daily to opine, \\"Since the Dalai Lama deems himself an Indian rather than Chinese, then why is he entitled to represent the voice of the Tibetan people?\\" Dhundup Gyalpo of the Tibet Sun replied that Tibetan religion could be traced back to Nalanda in India, and that Tibetans have no connection to Chinese \\"apart ... from a handful of culinary dishes\\". The People's Daily stressed the links between Chinese Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism and accused the Dalai Lama of \\"betraying southern Tibet to India\\". In 2008, the Dalai Lama said for the first time that the territory India claims and administers as part of Arunachal Pradesh is part of India, citing the disputed 1914 Simla Accord.  Shugden controversy  The Dorje Shugden Controversy reappeared in the Gelug school by the publication of the Yellow Book in 1976, containing stories about wrathful acts of Dorje Shugden against Gelugpas who also practiced Nyingma teachings. In response, the 14th Dalai Lama, a Gelugpa himself and advocate of an \\"inclusive\\" approach to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism, started to speak out against the practice of Dorje Shugden in 1978. The controversy has attracted attention in the West because of demonstrations held in 2008 and 2014 by Dorje Shugden practitioners. A 2015 Reuters investigation determined \\"that the religious sect behind the protests has the backing of the Communist Party\\" and that the \\"group has emerged as an instrument in Beijing's long campaign to undermine support for the Dalai Lama\\".Lague, David. Mooney, Paul. and Lim, Benjamin Kang. (21 December 2015). \\"China co-opts a Buddhist sect in global effort to smear Dalai Lama\\". Reuters. Retrieved 21 December 2015. After the Reuters investigation revealed that China backs it, the Shugden group halted operations and disbanded.  Gedhun Choekyi Nyima  In April 2018, the Dalai Lama confirmed the official Chinese claims about Gedhun Choekyi Nyima by saying that he knew from \\"reliable sources\\" that the Panchen Lama he had recognized was alive and receiving normal education. He said he hoped that the Chinese-recognised Panchen Lama (Gyaincain Norbu) studied well under the guidance of a good teacher, adding that there were instances in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, of a reincarnated lama taking more than one manifestation.11th Panchen Lama alive, receiving education: Dalai Lama, The Statesman, 25 April 2018: \\"Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Wednesday said 11th Panchen Lama Gedhun Choekyi Nyima \\"according to reliable source is alive and receiving normal education\\".

He said there are instances in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, \\"where a reincarnated lama took more than one manifestation\\".\\"Dr. Andrea Galli, Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama quarrel: The way for rapprochement with China, Modern Diplomacy, 9 May 2018.  Public image  The Dalai Lama meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama in 2016 Buddhist temple in Kalmykia, Russia The Dalai Lama places highly in global surveys of the world's most admired men, ranking with Pope Francis as among the world's religious leaders cited as the most admired. The Dalai Lama's appeal is variously ascribed to his charismatic personality, international fascination with Buddhism, his universalist values, and international sympathy for the Tibetans. In the 1990s, many films were released by the American film industry about Tibet, including biopics of the Dalai Lama. This is attributed to both the Dalai Lama's 1989 Nobel Peace Prize as well as to the euphoria following the Fall of Communism. The most notable films, Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet (both released in 1997), portrayed \\"an idyllic pre-1950 Tibet, with a smiling, soft-spoken Dalai Lama at the helm – a Dalai Lama sworn to non-violence\\": portrayals the Chinese government decried as ahistorical.

In 1996 the Chinese Communist Party once again reinstated the total prohibition of any photo of the 14th Dalai Lama. According to the Tibet Information Network, \\"authorities in Tibet have begun banning photographs of the exiled Dalai Lama in monasteries and public places, according to reports from a monitoring group and a Tibetan newspaper. Plainclothes police went to hotels and restaurants in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, on 22 and 23 April and ordered Tibetans to remove pictures of the Dalai Lama...\\" The ban continues in many locations throughout Tibet today.

In 1988 the Dalai Lama was awarded the Dr Leopold Lucas Prize on behalf of the Protestant faculty of the University of Tübingen, for his work on inter-people dialogue and interfaith dialogue, as well as to his commitment to tolerance and non-violence. The Dalai Lama donated the 50,000 Deutsche Mark prize to a German charity active in Tibet. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Dalai Lama the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. The Committee officially gave the prize to the Dalai Lama for \\"the struggle of the liberation of Tibet and the efforts for a peaceful resolution\\" and \\"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi\\" although the President of the Committee also said that the prize was intended to put pressure on China, which was reportedly infuriated that the award was given to a separatist. In 1994, he received the Freedom Medal from the Roosevelt Institute. In 2005, the Dalai Lama received the Christmas Humphreys Award from the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom. In 2006, he became one of only six people ever to be granted Honorary Citizenship of Canada. In February 2007, the Dalai Lama was named Presidential Distinguished Professor at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia; it was the first time that he accepted a university appointment. In 2007, the Dalai Lama received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award bestowed by American lawmakers, The Chinese government declared this would have \\"an extremely serious impact\\" on relations with the United States.

The moving-average model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on the current and various past values of a stochastic (imperfectly predictable) term. Together with the autoregressive (AR) model, the moving- average model is a special case and key component of the more general ARMA and ARIMA models of time series, which have a more complicated stochastic structure. The moving-average model should not be confused with the moving average, a distinct concept despite some similarities. Contrary to the AR model, the finite MA model is always stationary.  Definition  The notation MA(q) refers to the moving average model of order q: : X_t = \\\\mu + \\\\varepsilon_t + \\\\theta_1 \\\\varepsilon_{t-1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\theta_q \\\\varepsilon_{t-q} \\\\, where μ is the mean of the series, the θ1, ..., θq are the parameters of the model and the εt, εt−1,..., εt−q are white noise error terms. The value of q is called the order of the MA model. This can be equivalently written in terms of the backshift operator B as :X_t = \\\\mu + (1 + \\\\theta_1 B + \\\\cdots + \\\\theta_q B^q)\\\\varepsilon_t. Thus, a moving-average model is conceptually a linear regression of the current value of the series against current and previous (observed) white noise error terms or random shocks. The random shocks at each point are assumed to be mutually independent and to come from the same distribution, typically a normal distribution, with location at zero and constant scale. Interpretation The moving-average model is essentially a finite impulse response filter applied to white noise, with some additional interpretation placed on it. The role of the random shocks in the MA model differs from their role in the autoregressive (AR) model in two ways. First, they are propagated to future values of the time series directly: for example, \\\\varepsilon _{t-1} appears directly on the right side of the equation for X_t. In contrast, in an AR model \\\\varepsilon _{t-1} does not appear on the right side of the X_t equation, but it does appear on the right side of the X_{t-1} equation, and X_{t-1} appears on the right side of the X_t equation, giving only an indirect effect of \\\\varepsilon_{t-1} on X_t. Second, in the MA model a shock affects X values only for the current period and q periods into the future; in contrast, in the AR model a shock affects X values infinitely far into the future, because \\\\varepsilon _t affects X_t, which affects X_{t+1}, which affects X_{t+2}, and so on forever (see Vector autoregression#Impulse response). Fitting the model Fitting the MA estimates is more complicated than it is in autoregressive models (AR models), because the lagged error terms are not observable. This means that iterative non-linear fitting procedures need to be used in place of linear least squares. The autocorrelation function (ACF) of an MA(q) process is zero at lag q + 1 and greater. Therefore, we determine the appropriate maximum lag for the estimation by examining the sample autocorrelation function to see where it becomes insignificantly different from zero for all lags beyond a certain lag, which is designated as the maximum lag q. Sometimes the ACF and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) will suggest that an MA model would be a better model choice and sometimes both AR and MA terms should be used in the same model (see Box–Jenkins method#Identify p and q).

It rises very abruptly from the Hudson Valley to summits above in elevation, including three of the Catskill High Peaks, with almost no foothills. The plateau to the south and west averages above sea level. The Escarpment was the first area of the Catskills to attract the interest of European settlers. Botanist John Bartram wrote a widely read account of an expedition there prior to independence, and a century later the North-South Lake area he had visited became home to a number of exclusive resorts, including the Catskill Mountain House. Views of it inspired Thomas Cole and other painters of the Hudson River school, the first art movement in the United States. Today much of it is New York State Forest Preserve within the Catskill Park, and a popular place for hiking, camping and other outdoor recreation. Geography The Catskill Escarpment begins in the south at Overlook Mountain, just north of Woodstock. The graded trail to the summit and the 360-degree unobstructed view from the fire tower is a popular destination. The next mountain in the chain, directly to the north-northeast, is Plattekill Mountain, at dwarfed by its western neighbor, Indian Head Mountain, eastern end of the Devil's Path. To the north of Plattekill the ridge is broken by deep and narrow Platte Clove, the first of three breaks in the Escarpment. Just north of it the range crosses the Greene County line.. This definition of the Escarpment extends further to the northwest than that commonly used. View from Overlook, showing (from right) Plattekill Mountain, Kaaterskill High Peak, and Blackhead Range It rises again quickly to a high area around Kaaterskill High Peak, the easternmost Catskill High Peak and the first of three along the Escarpment. North of it the Escarpment is again breached by Kaaterskill Clove, the largest of its three breaks. It carries NY 23A through the Escarpment to the towns of Haines Falls, Tannersville and Hunter. Along its northern side is Kaaterskill Falls, one of the Catskills' oldest tourist attractions. Above Kaaterskill Clove rises South Mountain, after which the ridge levels to North-South Lake, the former locale of the Catskill Mountain House and other resorts of the late 19th century. Today it is a busy public campground. North of it the ridge rises again to North Mountain, with the open views from North Point to its south one of the Catskills' most popular hikes. Beyond North Point the Escarpment turns to the northwest. The land drops off slightly, then rises once again to Stoppel Point, in elevation. Then the Escarpment is broken once again by Dutcher or East Kill Notch, traversed only by an old road now used as a hiking trail. Another sharp rise leads up again to a ridge almost as high as Stoppel Point known unofficially as Arizona due to its dryness. North of it rises Blackhead Mountain, the easternmost peak of the Blackhead Range and fifth highest in the Catskills overall. Its summit is the highest point along the Escarpment, visible with its neighbors from as far north as Albany. After its steep northern slope the range curves more sharply to the west. Minor peaks Burnt Knob and Acra Point form the northern wall of Big Hollow along with Windham High Peak, the last of the three High Peaks along the Escarpment and the mountain traditionally considered its northern end, as the lesser ranges to its west divide and do not rise as drastically as the Escarpment itself does from the nearby land. Northern Escarpment Hydrologically, the entire Escarpment is within the Hudson River's drainage basin. To the east, Plattekill and Kaaterskill creeks drain the two cloves that share their names, and runoff from the ridge feeds Catskill Creek and other smaller tributaries of the Hudson in that area. To the west, with the exception of Kaaterskill High Peak, runoff feeds the headwaters and upper tributaries of Schoharie Creek, which rises at the height of land between Plattekill and Indian Head mountains. This makes them part of New York City's water supply due to the creek's impoundment at Schoharie Reservoir. Beyond there the Schoharie drains into the Mohawk and then back into the Hudson at Cohoes. The Escarpment is considered the only place in the Catskills where the region's boundary is distinct and unambiguous. In other directions the slow descent of the mountains into the hills of the Allegheny Plateau leads to arbitrary delineations of the range's extent. Due to its prominence, the Escarpment can be seen from a long distance around. It is a constant sight from not only the New York State Thruway in Greene County and the river but the Taconic State Parkway across the river and the mountains of western Connecticut and Massachusetts. From the Escarpment it is possible to see all those areas, plus Vermont, on a clear day. An overlook along Route 23 as it climbs the northern Escarpment is called Five State Lookout since New Hampshire's White Mountains are also visible. Along the lower slopes, it forms part of the border between Ulster and Greene counties at its southern end. Within Greene County, it separates the towns of Catskill, Cairo and Durham on the lowland side from Hunter, Jewett and Windham in the mountains. The Catskill Park Blue Line also follows an irregular path along old property lines along its slopes from its southern end to the Route 23 junction, the northernmost point in the park. Natural history The Escarpment owes its formation to three phases in different geological epochs. Two different processes shaped the range into what it is today. Its limestone bedrock began forming 400 mya, during the Silurian period, when the Catskill region was a river delta and the shallow sea it drained into. The river carried eroded material from the Taconic Mountains to the northeast, then reaching as high as over present-day sea level. Later, during the Acadian orogeny, the sea became the deeper Appalachian Basin, and the sand and clay from the newer mountains became the shale and sandstone found throughout the Catskills today.Titus, 49–50. Eventually the sea floor itself began to drain and uplift. The area of today's Escarpment and northeastern Catskills had been the river's distributaries and had the thickest layer of Devonian sediments, leading it to uplift as a whole and become a plateau rather than fracturing into mountains. Gradually, the upper levels of the plateau began to erode and create stream basins, eventually becoming today's mountains and valleys Platte Clove, carved out of the Escarpment by glaciers The Escarpment of that time was more gradually sloped than it is now, with much loose rock from its uplift. Sometime between 100,000 and 300,000 years ago, the Illinoian glaciation swept through the region. This had two impacts on the Escarpment. Not only did it scour and steepen its slopes, leaving the many bare cliffs found today, it carved out both Platte and Kaaterskill cloves from the narrower, shorter and shallower valleys of smaller streams.Titus, 132. In the latter, the gouge in the Escarpment was so deep it resulted in stream capture, as the outflow streams from North-South Lake, the headwaters of what would eventually be named Schoharie Creek instead flowed down into the new gorge. This both created Kaaterskill Falls, one of the Catskills' early tourist attractions, and relocated the source of the Schoharie to its present location.Titus, 136. As the Escarpment began to revegetate in the wake of the retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation, its forests remained exposed to weather due to their location. Lightning in particular caused many forest fires. Catskill forest historian Michael Kudish believes that the southern Escarpment \\"has been burned over many times, perhaps hundred of times, during the last several thousand years\\".Kudish, 134. Human history The history of the Escarpment is, in its early stages, the history of the Catskills, as the two were one and the same until modern surveying and science broadened the definition of the region in the late 19th century. No longer home to the Catskills' highest peak, the Escarpment became just the most visible of the Catskill ranges. Native Americans and colonial era The Munsee and Mahican tribes of Native Americans indigenous to the Hudson Valley did not live in the mountains, but settled heavily in the valley below.Kudish, 47-48. They went up the Escarpment only to hunt or start fires to nurture hunting grounds and provide defensive barriers against other tribes, or to follow trails to other communities on the far side of the mountains. While nothing has been recorded from the early years of contact with European settlers of what role the mountains above them played in their religious beliefs, it is very likely that they did, given their animistic traditions.Evers, 9–10. \\"The lower slopes of the outer Catskills were hunting grounds and not year-round residences through a thousand years and more of Indian life ... The Indian's physical connection with the Catskills was never great, yet the mountains loomed large in Indian life ... We have a right to assume that [Indian religious beliefs about the mountains] existed. Indians were animists.\\" In 1609 Henry Hudson's Half Moon sailed up the river later named for him in search of a route to China. It’s sailors became the first Europeans to see the Escarpment, and thus the Catskills.Evers, 10. \\"Robert Juet, who was first mate of the Half Moon when it sailed up the Hudson in 1609, had the first word. 'At night', he wrote, 'we came to other Mountaines which lie from the Rivers side.' ... Juet's mountains were the Catskills. No one would explore them for a century, until Johannes Hardenbergh secured the 2 million-acre (810,000 ha) land grant that bore his name from colonial governor Lord Cornbury in 1708, a patent later affirmed by his cousin, Queen Anne. The language of the document specified that its northeastern corner was at a lake above the Escarpment believed to be the source of Kaaterskill Creek, later North-South Lake.Evers, 74–75. \\"...It was to make sure that the Kaaterskill and Kaaterskill Clove were included in his grant that Hardenbergh and Company gave as their northeast corner 'ye head of a certain small river commonly known by ye name of Cartwright's Kill' ... By these words Hardenbergh and Company established as their corner the point at which the Kaaterskill emerges from the more southern of the two lakes, the one known today as South Lake.\\" The murky circumstances of the patent, likely involving official corruption,Evers, 36–39. compounded by litigation from a competing group of claimantsEvers, 49. \\"For more than fifteen years the lawsuit against Hardenberg and Company raged and languished by turns.\\" and interference with the crews attempting to survey the propertyEvers, 59-64. limited efforts to explore or settle the Escarpment, much less the whole region. North-South Lake, the \\"shady vale\\" explored by naturalist John Bartram That began to change in 1741 when early American naturalist John Bartram climbed up to a \\"shady vale\\" around North-South Lake, where he collected samples of the resin of the \\"Balm of Gilead\\" tree (balsam fir) to send to his English patron, Peter Collinson. He returned the next year for more.Evers, 79-80. Collinson regularly prevailed on Bartram over the next several years to return for some seeds of the tree, which the former hoped to grow in England, and in 1753 he did, accompanied by a guide and his son William. Despite being seriously ill, he returned to South Lake. He was unable to harvest any seeds, but in the process became the first person to record a visit to Kaaterskill Falls. His account, \\"To ye Cats Kill Mountains with Billy\\", illustrated by the boy, was the first scientific report on the Catskills. It listed most of the flora of the area and speculated on how the mountains might have been formed.Evers, 88–96. Independence and 19th century After the Revolution, the members of the Livingston family whose ancestral estate were the portion of the Hudson's eastern shore now the Hudson River Historic District, a National Historic Landmark (NHL), continued to enjoy the semi-feudal landownership they had broken with the Crown to protect. They made sure their estate houses, like Clermont Manor and Montgomery Place, both also NHLs, provided ample views of the Escarpment across the river, lands which the family had started to acquire. \\"The view to be had from these houses became of the very first importance,\\" according to Catskill historian Alf Evers. \\"... [A] man looking toward the Catskills from the east bank could see a view the equal in almost every respect to the already famous ones admired by so many tourists to England's Lake District.\\"Evers, 286. Horatio Spafford voiced a similar opinion at the time. \\"[The mountains] associate a mass of interesting, picturesque and sublime objects, no where exceeded in this country\\", he wrote in his 1813 gazetteer of the state.Quoted at Evers, 286. Later on, they followed the principles of Andrew Jackson Downing in designing their landscapes to provide views from their roads and paths. Even after the Livingstons moved on to other regions of the country, their reputation made the Catskills known in Britain as well as the U.S.Evers, 288. Contemporary image of part of the view from Pine Orchard. In 1812, Washington Irving visited the Livingston estates for a week; he may have taken some of his inspiration for \\"Rip Van Winkle\\", published seven years later, from that view.Evers, 290. Other prominent American writers of the time took notice of the Catskills as well. In a famous passage in James Fenimore Cooper's The Pioneers, written in 1823, Natty Bumppo describes both Kaaterskill Falls and the Pine Orchard, the area Bartram had explored and written about decades before. The same year the hotel later to become the Catskill Mountain House was built at the spot.Evers, 359. DeWitt Clinton was an early visitor.Evers, 360. In 1824, the Hunter Turnpike, forerunner of today's Route 23A, was cut through Kaaterskill Clove, making the whole area more accessible.Kudish, 132. Otherwise, the area remained the same undeveloped wilderness Bartram had explored. View on the Catskill, Early Autumn, one of Thomas Cole's paintings of the Escarpment It was an ideal subject for a young painter named Thomas Cole, who visited the Catskills in 1825 and stayed at the new hotel. Struck by its wildness and the many scenic views both from the Escarpment and of it, he took sketches of the area and returned several times to get more. The Catskills had been a subject of art since the 1730s, but the landscape paintings Cole eventually produced caused a sensation back in New York, with John Trumbull observing that Cole \\"has done what I have all my life attempted in vain\\".Evers, 372-377. Other artists like Asher Durand and Frederick Church began following Cole up the Hudson, and their similarly styled Romantic renderings of the region, dubbed the Hudson River school, became the young nation's first native art movement. Hotel era Poet William Cullen Bryant similarly used his art to glorify the Catskills, helping to create interest in the region as a tourist destination. Steamboat service up the Hudson, and later the railroads, made it even more accessible from New York City. Charles Beach took over a failing Catskill Mountain House in 1846 and turned it into one of mid-19th century America's most exclusive resorts, visited by presidents and other dignitaries. Guests explored the area, following paths and trails that still exist, to visit Kaaterskill Falls and other scenic spots.Evers, 451-60. The Catskill Mountain House, c. 1915 Competing hotels opened up nearby over the next several decades. The Kaaterskill Hotel, founded by a disgruntled Mountain House guest, was located near the summit of South Mountain.Evers, 496-509. The more modest Laurel House stood near the top of Kaaterskill Falls.Evers, 481-86. Several hoteliers attempted to make a similar success on the summit of Overlook Mountain.Evers, 470-480. In the 1880s, the hotels started to lose their luster. The Catskills had already been displaced as New York's highest mountains by the Adirondacks‘ Mount Marcy and other High Peaks there; in 1879 Princeton geology professor Arnold Guyot, a regular summer guest at the Mountain House since the Civil War, announced that not only were the so-called \\"Shandaken Mountains\\" in Ulster County to the southwest geologically continuous with the Catskills, one of them, Slide Mountain, was at the highest peak in the entire range, instead of the Escarpment's Kaaterskill High Peak. He had also found that the Mountain House itself was not as high as Beach claimed. Beach and the other Escarpment resort owners tried to discredit Guyot and his findings, but within years they had been verified by others.Evers, 487-95. A few years later, in 1885, the state legislature responded to increasing concerns that rampant logging in the Adirondacks might cause erosion that would silt up the Erie Canal and make it unnavigable by creating the Forest Preserve, under which any state land in several counties was to be left \\"forever wild\\". The Catskills were included in a later, revised version of the bill, when the Ulster County delegation saw a chance to take some tax-delinquent properties, and the county's obligations to the state, off the counties' hands. In 1894 the legislature and voters responded to loopholes in the legislation by writing it into the state constitution, where its language has remained as Article 14 ever since.Evers, 581-589. While this had no immediate effect on the hoteliers, other trends of the era began producing a decline in guests at the Escarpment hotels. Expansions of the railroad network meant that the wealthy guests who had previously been content to go to the Mountain House or Kaaterskill instead went to their own Great Camps in the Adirondacks, or to other mountainous or coastal regions. Competing hotels in areas further inland now recognized as being in the Catskills claimed to offer a more genuine mountain experience, and purer air, to their guests. The guests who did come tended to stay for shorter periods, mainly hot weekends in the summer. Beach and the Mountain House made a long-planned joint venture to build an incline railway up the Escarpment to the hotel a reality in 1892, but it cut into their profits.Evers, 549-50. \\"The 'Otis' cars were filled for only a short time each year when nights in the city of New York were at their hottest. The rest of the year the line lost money.\\" 20th century The state made its first significant purchases along the Escarpment in 1900, with parcels along the ridgetop north of Blackhead.Kudish, 133-34. Beach, who had finally dropped his resistance to Jewish guests and electricity, died in 1902 and left his hotel to his sons. The roads up the cloves were paved to accommodate the then-new automobile. Since guests could then more easily reach the newer resorts further into the mountains, the Mountain House continued to suffer. The incline railroad was shut down in 1918. When the Hotel Kaaterskill burned down in 1924, it was not rebuilt.Evers, 688. The next year the state acquired Stoppel Point, complementing its purchase of Kaaterskill High Peak, most of Overlook, Plattekill and Roundtop in 1921, which had capped two decades of acquisitions on the northern Escarpment. It closed in on the Mountain House with the purchase of South Mountain and the former Kaaterskill site as the decade ended, and the son-in-law who now owned the Mountain House had to sell most of the tract to the state to make ends meet. Despite the onset of the Great Depression, the Mountain House struggled through a few years, closing for a while, then reopening for one final season in 1942 under new ownership. New owners also began building a third Overlook Hotel in 1927 and continued throughout the 1930s; however, their supplies were stolen during World War II and the project was abandoned. Its decaying frame remains near the mountain's summit.Kudish, 122 There were some attempts to revive the Mountain House after the war, and preservationists urged that it be restored as an architectural treasure. But the increasingly decrepit building was becoming hazardous to the hikers who explored it, and after the state acquired the building and the lands around it in 1962, the then-Conservation Department burned it down early the next year. Only its stone gateposts remain. Five years later the Laurel House was demolished as well.Kudish, 136. North Point, a typical open ledge of the Escarpment The Escarpment's transition from private paradise to public playground was complete, although the last mountaintop parcel, the summit of Overlook, was not fully acquired until 1996.Kudish, 121. Over the course of the rest of the century, the state developed North-South Lake into the busy campground it is today and cut new trails and marked old roads and paths throughout the range. Today the Forest Preserve along the Escarpment is divided into several different management units and administered according to the Catskill State Land Master Plan. Natural environment The forests of the Escarpment reflect their history, location and topography. The retreat of the glaciers, particularly on the ridgetops and northern and eastern slopes, scoured the rock, further distressing the growing environment on what are the Catskills' steepest and most exposed slopes. As a result, the coniferous evergreen species characteristic of boreal forests such as red spruce and the balsam fir Bartram sought appear in much higher concentrations, and at lower elevations, then they do elsewhere in the Catskills.Kudish, 3. \\"The slopes of the eastern Catskills, particularly on the Escarpment, are steeper on average than the slopes of the western Catskills. The mean slope for the eastern peaks is 15.1 degrees ... Steeper slopes indicate more frequent and higher bedrock ledges, more exposure and shallower soils. This helps explain why there are more spruce and fir in the eastern Catskills than there are in the western ...\\" The summit of North Mountain, at 3,180 feet (970 m) above sea level, is covered in boreal forest, the lowest Catskill summit of which this is true. While there are no true alpine zones in the Catskills, Kudish has found the only areas in the range which come close along the Escarpment at elevations between along the Escarpment as it rises from lakes to North Mountain. These are exposed ridgetops where three-toothed cinquefoil, and in one mountain sandwort, is found. Since those species are shade-intolerant, it suggests that the sites have not reforested since the end of glaciation.Kudish, 18. \\"While today no arctic-tundra zone remains in the Catskills, two species typical of arctic vegetation persist. These are the mountain sandwort (Minuartia groenlandica, formerly named Arenaria groenlandica) and the three-toothed cinquefoil (Potentilla tridentata) ... Apparently these sites, usually exposed ledgetops with mineral soil almost non-existent and under an acre in size, have never been forested since deglaciation; the growth of a forest above the shade-intolerant arctic plants would have eliminated them ... The locations for the three-toothed cinquefoil, are, in order of increasing elevation: (1) several sites from 2,260 to 2,720 feet along the Escarpment from just north of the Catskill Mountain House site to Albany Point ... The mountain sandwort's single location in the Catskills is at Albany Point where the two arctic species co-exist.\\" At lower elevations, the many fires that have raged over the region have left it with a mixed forest where oak and pine predominate.Kudish, 131-32. Several large areas of Norway spruce were planted on the north slopes of Windham High Peak during reforestation efforts following state land acquisitions in the 1930s. Due to the history of fires and logging on the northern sections of the range, there are very few areas of first-growth remaining outside of the boreal plots. The largest is the summit of Blackhead; the largest hardwood first-growth is likewise the around the summit of Windham High Peak. The eastern hemlocks around Spruce Creek below Kaaterskill Falls are also a virgin stand. They survived the era when tanners sought the species for the tannin in its bark since the steep and perilous nature of that terrain made them too difficult to profitably extract. It and many of the other ravines draining into Kaaterskill Clove also support some plants species rare in New York State, such as roseroot stonecrop and fragrant cliff fern (listed as threatened and endangered at the state level, respectively). Dominant fauna of the Escarpment are the species found elsewhere in the Catskills: white-tailed deer, porcupine, fisher, black bear and snowshoe hare. There have been some rare bobcat sightings up on the ridge. Bird species like the rare Bicknell's thrush and ruffed grouse nest in the boreal forests. A few timber rattlesnake dens are known to exist on the rocky ledges of Overlook at the southern end of the range. The paucity of water on the ridgetops and the slopes means that there are few major fish or amphibian species in the Escarpment, save around North-South Lake. Protected areas Most of the Escarpment, including all its mountaintops and ridges, has been acquired by the state and added to the Forest Preserve, requiring that it be kept forever wild. Private land is found only in the cloves, where some of it is also protected. The Forest Preserve lands are divided into management units by the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Initially all of the state lands save North-South Lake Public Campground were classified as Wild Forests, a protection level unique to New York that is slightly less restrictive than wilderness. In 2008 an updated Catskill State Land Master Plan combined the North Mountain, Windham High Peak and Blackhead Range Wild Forests into one new unit, the Windham-Blackhead Range Wilderness. Two old roads through the Escarpment were also given a new classification, Primitive Bicycle Corridor, to accommodate mountain bikes., New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, August 2008; retrieved December 8, 2008; 2. From north to south, the areas are: *Overlook Turnpike Primitive Bicycle Corridor: The road up Overlook Mountain and past Plattekill Mountain to the end of Prediger Road in the Town of Hunter.CPSLMP, 72. *Overlook Mountain Wild Forest: around the road up Overlook and the mountain's summit.CPSLMP, 67. *Indian Head Wilderness Area. Eastern section of the wilderness area that includes the entire Devil's Path located on the Escarpment. Includes Echo Lake, the only significant body of water in a Catskill wilderness area.CPSLMP, 61. *Platte Clove Preserve. A tract owned by the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development at the head of the clove. The only privately owned protected area in the Escarpment. *Kaaterskill Wild Forest This management unit includes all the state land on Kaaterskill High Peak, and, in the updated plan, the Kaaterskill Clove and South Mountain areas including Kaaterskill Falls.CPSLMP, 66-67. *North Lake-South Lake State Campground. The former site of the Mountain House and other hotels is the most-visited section of the Escarpment, with over two hundred campsites.CPSLMP, 73. *Windham- Blackhead Range Wilderness. Created in the updated master plan from the merger of three smaller Wild Forests. Its surround the Big Hollow Valley and include the Escarpment from North Point to past Windham high Peak.CPSLMP, 62-63. *Colgate Lake/Dutcher Notch Primitive Bicycle Corridor: The old road from the lake through the notch and down the east side of the Escarpment.CPSLMP, 72. *Elm Ridge Wild Forest: Formerly part of the Windham High Peak Wild Forest, this unit occupies the north end of the Escarpment within the Catskill Park. Kaaterskill Falls, still a popular destination for visitors. Recreational use All the Escarpment's public lands are available for passive recreation such as hiking, camping and birding. Hunting and fishing are permitted within season and as otherwise regulated by the state. Unpowered boating is permitted on Echo and North-South lakes. Use is free except for North-South Lake Public Campground, for which a $8 fee is charged per vehicle in season (Campers are also charged $22 for the site). In return, heavier-impact camping and activities are allowed, and greater services are provided to visitors. There is also a 12-mile (18 km) snowmobile loop trail around Kaaterskill High Peak and Round Top. The Escarpment has many hiking trails. Foremost among them is the Escarpment Trail, which begins at Schutt Road just outside the campground gate. From there it goes north to Route 23, climbing over Stoppel Point, Blackhead and Windham High Peak along the way. All but the southernmost are also part of the Long Path long-distance trail, which itself traverses Kaaterskill High Peak and descends Kaaterskill Clove to near Palenville and then reascends to join the Escarpment Trail. Backpackers starting near Woodstock can use the trail up that mountain to hike the entire Escarpment, connecting to the Long Path between Indian Head and Plattekill mountains. Other trails climb the ridge, all from the west with the exception of the Dutcher Notch Trail. They mainly provide access to the Escarpment Trail, except for the old trails around the Mountain House property at North-South Lake which provide short connections and loop trips between the campground and various sections of the Escarpment Trail. The most popular trail in the entire Catskills is the short trail up to Kaaterskill Falls from Route 23A, formerly the southernmost section of the Escarpment Trail until it was closed above the falls for safety reasons.

Education and career Alfred Darbyshire was born on 20 June 1839 in Salford, Lancashire, to William Darbyshire, the manager of a dyeworks, and his wife Mary née Bancroft. He was a nephew of George Bradshaw, the compiler of railway guides. His education began at the Quaker school in Manchester and continued from 1852 at the Quaker Ackworth School where his artistic abilities were recognised and encouraged by Henry Sparkes. He completed his education at Liudow Grove Academy, Alderley. On leaving school he was articled to PB Alley of the architects' firm of Lane and Alley in Manchester and enrolled in the Manchester School of Art. In 1862 he established his own architectural practice at St James's Square, Manchester. Early commissions included additions to Lyme Hall and a house in Newton-le-Willows. He was one of the founders of the first Manchester Architectural Association. Frederick Bennett Smith joined him as a partner from about 1885 to 1905. Darbyshire died in Manchester in 1908 and was buried at Flixton Church. () Works Darbyshire admired the Gothic Revival style of Alfred Waterhouse but also designed in the neoclassical style. He is best known for his theatrical architecture. He designed Manchester's Gaiety Theatre and a theatre at Rawtenstall, and carried out alterations at Manchester's Theatre Royal and the Prince's theatres. In London he altered and decorated the Lyceum Theatre. Concerned by the danger of fire in theatres, he worked with the actor Henry Irving to develop the Irving- Darbyshire safety plan which consisted of isolating separate parts of the theatre and providing fireproof escape routes. He first implemented this plan when he rebuilt the theatre in Exeter which had been destroyed by a fire in 1887. His last major theatre was the Palace of Varieties in Manchester. Other buildings designed by Darbyshire include Pendleton Town Hall, Manchester Corporation Abattoir, Alston Hall in Lancashire, the Carnegie Library in Knutsford and the churches of St Cyprian and St Ignatius in Salford. He made designs for temporary exhibitions, including a military bazaar in Manchester in 1884, a Shakespearean show in the Royal Albert Hall the same year and in the Royal Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester in 1887. Darbyshire was also involved in the design of several distilleries and factories for the Jameson family and was later engaged by Andrew Jameson to design a Tudor revival style mansion house for the family on Howth Head in the Northern suburbs of Dublin called Sutton House. Theatre Darbyshire as Jacques in As You Like ItT. A. Lockett, Three Lives: Samuel Bamford, Alfred Darbyshire, Ellen Wilkinson. (It Happened Round Manchester.) London: University of London Press Limited, 1968 ISBN 0-340-07262-8 Alfred Darbyshire was a man of many talents which centred on the theatre. As well as building them, he acted in them and became famous for his extravagant stage productions. In 1869 Charles Calvert, actor-manager of the Prince's Theatre, Manchester, employed Alfred to redecorate the theatre. They became good friends and Alfred assisted Calvert with the staging of some of his great 'revivals' of Shakespeare's plays. In 1872 he built a spectacular set for the triumphal entry of the King into London in Henry V. He reproduced the streets of London, the seaport of Southampton, the walled town of Harfleur, the battle field of Agincourt, the palaces of Westminster and Rouen, and the cathedral of Troyes. It contained between two and three hundred persons. The production was carried through the United States and into Australia. In New York more than 100,000 people visited Booth's Theatre to see the play. Paintings upright=0.5upright=1.3 As a landscape painter he sketched and painted in Italy, France, Belgium and Germany. He was friendly with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown and Walter Crane. Alfred could produce an intricate architectural watercolour depicting Durham Cathedral, or a busy colourful picture of a harbour in Whitby, now both in Stockport Art Gallery. Writing He was an art critic for the Manchester Guardian from 1868 to 1874 and thereafter until 1905 he was an art critic for the Manchester Courier. He wrote a number of books on architecture, heraldry and art – including A Booke of Olde Manchester and Salford containing about 70 illustrations of ancient buildings, which he compiled for the Jubilee celebrations of 1887. He published a volume The Art of the Victorian Stage, and innumerable pamphlets and brochures for such occasions as the Old Manchester and Salford Exhibition. He also wrote an autobiography. upright=0.8 Publications *A Booke of Olde Manchester and Salford (1887) *A Chronicle of the Brasenose Club, Manchester (in two volumes, 1892–1900) *An Architect's Experiences: Professional, Artistic and Theatrical (1897) *The Art of the Victorian Stage (1907) Personal life In 1870 he married Sarah Marshall with whom he had a son and three daughters. Darbyshire was an amateur actor and a friend of many actors, in particular Charles Calvert and Henry Irving. He continued to be a member of the Society of Friends. He became a fellow of the Institute of British Architects in 1870 and was its vice-president from 1902 to 1905. He was president of the Manchester Society of Architects from 1901 to 1903. He collected books on heraldry and these are now in the John Rylands Library, Manchester. Alfred lectured to many societies. He was a member of the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts (1867,) Manchester Arts Club (1870,) the Brasenose Club and a council member for the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society. He was cousin to the American industrialists and philanthropists William Poole Bancroft and Samuel Bancroft, the latter of whom corresponded extensively with Darbyshire about artwork.

She lived on a farm in the Central Tablelands of New South Wales and many of her books evoke the stress and satisfaction of living in the Australian countryside, floods, bushfires, drought and all. Two of her novels, Good Luck to the Rider and The Family Conspiracy, won the Australian Children's Book of the Year Award. Biography Joan Phipson was born in Warrawee, New South Wales, on 16 November 1912, to English parents. She spent much of her childhood traveling between Australia, England and India. She attended the Frensham School, where she later worked as a librarian and printer, setting up Frensham Press. She studied journalism and worked for Reuters in London before the war. From 1941 to 1944 she served as a telegraphist in the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force. She married Colin Fitzhardinge in 1944 and they settled in the NSW countryside. Her first children's book, about a girl on an Australian ranch who adopts an orphaned colt, was published in 1953, and she continued to write into the 1990s. She died on 2 April 2003, aged 90, survived by her children, Guy and Anna. Awards Good Luck to the Rider was named Australian Children's Book of the Year in 1953. The Family Conspiracy won the award in 1963, and also won the New York Herald Tribune Children's Spring Book Festival Award in 1964. The Watcher in the Garden received an International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) Honour Diploma. Hit and Run was chosen as a White Ravens Selection of the International Youth Library in Munich and was also chosen for the American Library Association Notable Books list for children and for the ALA Best Books list for young adults. In 1987 Joan Phipson was awarded the Dromkeen Medal for advancing children's literature in Australia, and in 1994 became a member of the Order of Australia.It's an Honour website Literary significance At a time when Australian literature was dominated by English and American books, Joan Phipson provided an authentic Australian voice. Her early books concerned family life in the country, animals, riding and sailing. Her first book with an urban setting was Peter and Butch. Later, in the 1970s and '80s, she handled a variety of challenging subjects such as the brutal racket in rare bird smuggling (Fly into Danger), urban breakdown (Keep Calm), nuclear warfare (Dinko) and teenage alienation (The Watcher in the Garden). Maurice Saxby, the children's literature expert, wrote: \\"More than any other writers, Eleanor Spence and Joan Phipson have perhaps helped guide the direction of Australian children's literature in the past 30 years. They have both expressed in their novels of family life not only social changes but the concerns and preoccupations of a growingly complex Australian society.\\" Most of her books were published in the UK and the US as well as Australia, and her work was translated into French, German, Swedish and Hungarian.

It is located southwest of the village of Mawbray, and southwest of the city of Carlisle. It has a population of about 35 people. Salta can only be accessed from the lane from Mawbray, which goes on to join the B5300 coast road, although two public bridleways provide access over the fields from Hailforth and Mawbray. The hamlet consists of mainly bungalows, and a farm is still in operation in the vicinity. A caravan park, Manor House Park, is situated across the Moss to the southeast, to the southwest of the hamlet of Edderside. The settlement's name is derived from \\"sēalt-tir\\", meaning \\"salt land\\" in Old English, as during Anglo-Saxon times, salt making was a major industry on the Solway Plain. Fortified during the Roman period, in the 1550s, Salta participated in a system called \\"seawake\\", a night watch to guard the coast against incursions across the Solway by the Scots. Salta Moss was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1954 and forms part of the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is home to a diversity of wildlife, including Adders, Britain's only native venomous snake, and several varieties of heather, as well as the purple moor grass Molinia caerulea. History The name \\"Salta\\" comes from Old English \\"sēalt-tir\\", meaning \\"salt land\\". In Anglo-Saxon times, salt making was a major industry on the Solway coast, and there are remains of medieval salt pans near Milefortlet 21, only a few miles down the coast from Salta. Salta appears in older documents with several variant spellings, including \\"Sathowe\\". The road in Salta after being resurfaced in 2014. On Salta Moss, an area of common land next to the hamlet, a Bronze Age rapier (a kind of sword) was discovered in the 1980s, proving that the area was settled by ancient Britons millennia ago. The rapier currently resides in the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle, and archaeologists date it as being crafted as early as 1100 BC. Two perforated axe-hammers and a polished axe dated to the Neolithic period were unearthed at nearby Mawbray. After the arrival of Romans in Britain, the area around Salta was fortified as part of the coastal defences which extended beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall. By the 1550s, Salta participated in a system called \\"seawake\\", which was a night watch to guard the coast against incursions across the Solway by the Scots. These incursions were frequent, and on one occasion in 1592 at Dubmill, near Salta, a Mr Barwise the local miller was taken prisoner by Scottish raiders. One of the properties in Salta is known to date from the 16th century, and the hamlet has been continually inhabited ever since. During the Second World War, 43 evacuees from the Newcastle-Upon-Tyne area were billeted to the parish of Holme St. Cuthbert, and several ended up in Salta. Development in the 20th century saw new houses built, but mainline water and electricity arrived later than in other parts of Britain, perhaps due to the small population. Excavations of a cropmark enclosure at Edderside, beyond the Moss to the southeast of Salta, were conducted in 1989–1990 by Robert H. Bewley. The Kelsick House wind turbine was approved for construction in 2013 in spite of local opposition, to the northeast, to the south of Abbeytown, and will join a number of other wind turbines in the area around Salta. Geography and farming Looking up the hill at Salta. An irrigation ditch runs next to an unpaved track on Salta Moss. Salta lies near the coast of northwestern Cumbria. By road it is situated south of Mawbray, north of Allonby, southwest of Holme St Cuthbert and southwest of Abbeytown. It shares very close community ties with nearby Mawbray, although the city of Carlisle provides wider amenities, some to the northeast. The shore of Allonby Bay, an inlet of the Solway Firth, is a mere half-a-mile to the west of the hamlet. A beck (a local word meaning \\"stream\\") flows through Salta, fed in part by irrigation channels. This beck eventually joins the Black Dub and drains into the Solway Firth at Dubmill. Salta looking towards the Northeast. Salta Moss is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, both for its natural and historical significance, and is itself is located in a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty which covers much of the Solway Plain. The Moss is an area of peatland, containing \\"mainly oligotrophic semi-fibrous grass-sedge peat\\" according to Soil Survey Record. It combines characteristics of both a raised bog and a valley mire, and lies atop deposits of glacial sand from the last ice age. It was designated an SSSI in 1954. Having been cut with irrigation channels, and been the site of burning and peat working, Salta Moss has different flora than other bogs or mires on the Solway Plain. The Moss today is common ground, but a track runs through it to provide access for local farmers to outlying fields, which surround it. An irrigation ditch has also been dug to provide drainage to the surrounding farmland. There is some concern that areas of the Moss have been damaged or partly destroyed as a result of agricultural activity, including the digging of drainage ditches. Natural England, the agency responsible for the management of SSSIs in England, has suggested that no further irrigation channels should be dug, existing ones should not be deepened, and that the area should not be exposed to fertilisers or surface water run-off. Natural England further notes that the site's continued status as an SSSI depends on maintaining a high water table. Climate Salta, like the rest of the Solway plain, has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb), with mild summers and winters which generally avoid extremes of temperature. Salta has a cool climate, with average daytime highs of around 19 °C during July and August, and 6 °C during December. Overnight lows are 12 °C in July and August, falling to 2 °C in December, January, and February. Temperatures as high as 30 °C have been recorded in particularly hot summers, as have lows of −12 °C in winter. It is wet year-round, with rain or drizzle expected on 16 to 19 days of most months. Snowfall is relatively uncommon. Salta, and this part of the Cumbrian coast, can be subject to high winds especially during the winter months, with windstorms and gale-force winds most likely to occur between October and April. The hamlet avoided major flooding which hit the region in 2009, and escaped the worst effects of Storm Desmond in 2015. Severe weather warnings were in effect in December 2015 as Storm Desmond hit, including a \\"red\\" warning for rain indicating severely bad weather. Wind gusts in the area exceeded 80 mph (129 km/h) during this storm. Flora and fauna A gorse flower on Salta Moss, Cumbria. Salta, and the Moss in particular, is home to a variety of plant and animal life, including some rare specimens. Adders, Britain's only native venomous snake, are seen on the Moss, and prey upon small rodents, such as voles. Many wild bird species inhabit Salta and the surrounding area, including larger species such as pheasants, which are also bred locally for hunting. The Moss contains several varieties of heather, as well as the purple moor grass Molinia caerulea. Ferns and gorse are common too, and in areas where peat has been cut in the past, there are bog mosses, the bog bean Menyanthus trifoliata, and marsh pennywort. Landmarks and amenities The public bridleway which leads from Salta to Mawbray. Salta today is still a very small settlement, home to approximately 35 people. Most of the houses are fairly modern bungalows, such as those named Barnfield, Heather Moor, Moss View and Tamberry, although there are older two-floor cottages on either side of the hamlet. Another bungalow is named Anchorage, which features a ship anchor scheme on its gates.Google Street View There is still a functioning farm in Salta, which is passed on the lane accessing the hamlet. There are other farms in Mawbray and Allonby, and the hamlet is surrounded by farmland belonging to these local farmers. Though the road through the hamlet comes to a dead-end, and is accessed by lane only from the coastal B5300 road or Mawbray, two public bridleways at the end provide access over the fields to Hailforth and Mawbray, with the latter emerging right next to the pub in the centre of the village. A caravan park, Manor House Park, is situated across the peat to the southeast, to the southwest of the hamlet of Edderside. Allerdale Borough Council provides refuse collection, streetlighting, and other modern amenities. The nearest primary schools are Allonby Primary School in Allonby and Holme St Cuthbert School near Mawbray, and the nearest secondary school is Beacon Hill Community School in Aspatria. Modern Salta is a predominantly Christian community, though the local Church is located at Holme St Cuthbert, several miles away. As at 2014, a bus service runs between Silloth and Workington on the B5300 approximately every two hours, and can be requested to make a stop at Dubmill, near Salta. Salta is part of the Workington parliamentary constituency. The current Member of Parliament as of 2019 is Mark Jenkinson, a Conservative, who unseated former MP Sue Hayman at the 2019 General Election. The Labour Party had previously won the seat in every general election since 1979; the Conservative Party had only won the 1976 Workington by-election since the Second World War.

Her first works were of an Asian American nature, attempting to make sense of being raised with eastern values while schooled in U.S. thought. The plays following, whether experimental or traditionally non-ethnic, have always attempted to juxtapose and commingle contradiction, and also articulate a female sensibility at the core of the work.  Awards  In the year 2000, Los Angeles’ Mark Taper Forum honored her with the Richard E. Sherwood Award in June, while New York's Downtown Arts Project awarded her the Colbert Award for Excellence that fall. She was also given a New Voices Playwriting Award from East West Players and awarded a slot at Seattle's ACT/Hedgebrook Playwriting Festival that year as well. Two years prior, Tuan was endowed with the NEA/TCG Residency Program for Playwrights through Los Angeles’ East West Players (1998–2000) while also given a Playwright in Residence grant through the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs/California Arts Council at the Los Angeles Theatre Center (1998–1999). Upon graduating from Brown University with an MFA in Creative Writing in 1997 (having been endowed with the Binecke Playwright Fellowship from 1995–1997), Tuan was the winner of the Perishable Theater 5th Annual Woman's Playwriting Festival. She was also awarded the Drama-Logue Award for Best Play that year for scribing Ikebana, a play telling the relations of a 3-generation Chinese family, each scene having been written based on a Japanese flower arrangement.  Plays  Tuan has had over a dozen works produced, including Last of the Suns, Ajax (por nobody), Coastline, The Roaring Girle, and BATCH, one-act plays Some Asians and Manilova, 9 short plays and a self-scribed hypertext performance as part of En Garde Arts’ final production, the site specific Secret History of the Lower East Side. The best known of these plays, Ajax (por nobody), had a year run at New York's Flea Theater and traveled to the Melbourne Fringe Festival in September 2001. It is also archived in the Billy Rose Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. Thomas E. Jenkins notes ‘Tuan’s Ajax is less a direct adaptation of a Greek tragedy than an exploration of what “tragedy” means in the context of American theatre, and even American social context. Tuan's clever use of classical allusions and stage techniques, however, roots the play in the most ancient of performance traditions even as it pushes the boundaries of contemporary sensibilities concerning sex and sexuality.’. In 2012, Canadian director Zack Russell directed the first fully staged production of this explicit work in Toronto's SummerWorks Festival to rambunctious reviews and sold out houses. Last of the Suns, her first play, tells of a Chinese Nationalist army general shriveling away under the harsh California sun as his failed and defecting ice-skating granddaughter comes to visit him on his 100th birthday. It premiered at Berkeley Repertory Theatre and was later produced by New York's Ma-Yi Theater Company. Matthew Murray begins his review ‘The world of Alice Tuan's Last of the Suns is one that, as in many great plays, exists somewhere between the real and the fantastic. Real people seem fictional, imaginary creatures are among the most human characters, and absolutely nothing is as it seems at first glance.’ More recent works include the Virtual Hypertext Play Coastline, which traveled to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2005, and BATCH: An American Bachelor/ette Party Spectacle,' directed by Whit MacLaughlin and in collaboration with New Paradise Laboratories. Commissioned by the Actors Theatre of Louisville, BATCH had its world premiere at the Humana Festival of New American Plays in March 2007. In writing about BATCH in The Feminist Spectator, Jill Dolan states: \\"Alice Tuan’s plays stretch the proprieties of American morality. She stares in the face of all our taboos and preconceptions, and insists that we take a very close look along with her, staging a gaze so intense that everything we thought we knew begins to melt from its heat.\\"'' HIT, originally commissioned by New York's Public Theater, opened at the Los Angeles Theater Center in May 2014, produced by the Latino Theater Company and directed by Laurel Ollstein. In a Stage Raw review, Steven Leigh Morris writes 'HIT isn't so much a drama as a comic-despondent point of view on what it means to be alive here, in our perverse sliver of history.'  Teaching Tuan has facilitated playwright workshops at all levels throughout the United States, including MFA candidates at both the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas, Austin, and the California Institute of the Arts. Before becoming a playwright, Tuan taught English as a Second Language (ESL) in China and Los Angeles.  References  Thomas E.

As a rule, scientific efforts are directed at discovery of knowledge or proofs of concept, employing pilot studies or laboratory-based experiments to achieve these goals. Such studies generally do not address questions of whether findings can be generalized or applied in a practice-based domain. Implementation research is the effort to understand the pathway from scientific findings to practical benefit. Public Health  In the context of public health, the World Health Organization describes implementation research as a form of research which “addresses implementation bottlenecks, identifies optimal approaches for a particular setting, and promotes the uptake of research findings: ultimately, it leads to improved health care and its delivery.” and identifies four notable characteristics: it is systematic, multidisciplinary, contextual, and complex. More broadly, implementation research has been defined as “the scientific inquiry into questions concerning implementation -- the act of carrying an intention into effect, which in health research can be policies, programmes, or individual practices (collectively called interventions).” A range of qualitative and quantitative research methods are used in implementation research in health. Some methods have been developed specifically for the purpose of implementation research. These are pragmatic trials, participatory action research, effectiveness-implementation hybrid trials and quality improvement studies. A 2018 review of study designs in implementation research found that randomized designs, like cluster RCTs, were used 77% of the time, and 61% of studies included both quantitative and qualitative methods. A working group of researchers in public health has proposed a standard for reporting implementation studies (_StaRI_) in public health. Education As with wider social and human science-related fields, education and learning, involve many personal, social and environmental factors that could influence the outcomes of educational processes and student learning. As a consequence, controlled experiments widely used in educational research at times are hard to reproduce and it is difficult to disseminate their results in real-life setting. As a way to address such problems, in the 20th century a range of methodologies that study real-life learning processes were developed. Among these can be counted lesson study, action research (when applied to education and learning) and phenomenography. More recently more structured methodologies that apply iterative changes to a learning process have been developed, notably design- based research.

The term is used to distinguish them from Banyamulenge, Rwandans who emigrated in a wave in the 19th century. They acquired Congolese citizenship at independence from Belgium on 30 June 1960. The Congolese law on citizenship said that to be Congolese one should be a member of a tribe (ethnic) that was within Congolese boundaries as established at the Berlin Conference in 1885. Congolese Banyarwanda occupied Rutshuru, Masisi, Walikale and Kalehe before 1885. Later they were reaffirmed as citizens in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1972 by Mobutu Sese Seko when he needed their support, and subsequently had their citizenship revoked in 1981. This decision was reconfirmed near the end of the Mobutu regime, during 1992's Sovereign National Conference. One has to understand the ambiguity around the Mobutu regime in regards the Banyarwanda. The word Banyarwanda simply means \\" people of Rwandan origin\\". It is important to know that before the Berlin Conference in 1885, which divided Africa among the colonial powers, there were no actual borders between Rwanda and Congo. The Banyarwanda were organized in kingdoms and these kingdoms extended to the eastern Congo in Masisi, Rutshuru, Kalehe, Walikale, Munigi and the town of Goma. One has to understand as well that there were Rwandan, mainly Tutsi refugees who fled the Rwandan Hutu revolution in 1959-1962. These refugees acquired citizenship through the Mobutu decree dated 1972. When the RPF seized power in Rwanda in 1994 many of these refugees returned to Rwanda. All of the following groups are Banyarwanda that have lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: \\\\- Kinyarwanda speaking people who were within Congolese boundaries in 1885 before the Berlin Conference and acquired citizenship at independence \\\\- People of Rwandan origin who immigrated to settle in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1885 and 1960 and acquired citizenship at independence \\\\- People of Rwandan origin who came to work in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to work in the mines in Katanga. They retained their Rwandan citizenship \\\\- Rwandan refugees who fled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1959-1962 (Rwanda became independent in 1962). They returned to Rwanda when the RPF took power in Rwanda in 1994 \\\\- Rwandan citizens who live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \\\\- Rwandan Hutu refugees who fled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1994.

Abhá is a superlative of the word Baháʼ, and a form of the Greatest Name. It can be compared to the takbir of Islam, Allahu Akbar \\"God is Great\\" or Subhan Allah \\"how pure is God\\". Alláh-u-Abhá is used both when greeting someone or bidding someone farewell. Baháʼís are asked to engage in the practice of dhikr: to repeat the phrase Alláh-u-Abhá 95 times per day, as described by Baháʼu'lláh, founder of the Baháʼí Faith, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, his book of laws. Nader Saiedi explains that the significance of the number 95 originates from the Persian Bayán, where the Báb states that ninety-five stands for the numerical value of \\"for God\\" (lillāh), symbolizing the recognition of the manifestation of God and obedience to his laws, which are inseparable from each other, as confirmed by Baháʼu'lláh in the opening paragraph of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The form ' is the nominative case of Allah \\"God\\". The form ' is the elative of the adjective ' \\"beauty, brilliancy\\". In Baháʼí writings, it is usually translated as \\"most glorious\\".

History Hattertown takes its name from the hat-manufacturing trade around which the village grew in the early 19th century. \\"Hatting\\" was a major economic activity in western Connecticut in the 19th century, having started in Danbury in about 1780. Hats were made from felt formed from animal fur. As hat production increased, the manufacturing activity spread from Danbury to surrounding areas where the supply of fur-bearing animals such as muskrat, fox, and beaver had not yet been depleted. A small village existed at the site of Hattertown before 1821, when the Taylor and Benedict families arrived there and began hat production. Hattertown was later to become one of the few places in the region where an entire village was directly involved in the hat trade. Hatting in the village was a cottage industry in which hat producers made rough-formed hats for sale to wholesalers in Danbury or \\"front shops\\" in New York City where they would be finished. Hatting continued in Hattertown until at least 1856, but it was in decline by the 1840s as fur processing and hat forming were becoming increasingly mechanized and the local supply of fur-bearing animals was largely depleted. Historic district The Hattertown Historic District is centered on the Hattertown Green, which dates from the late 19th century and is bound by Hattertown Road, Hi Barlow Road, Gregory Lane, and the intersections of Castle Meadow Road and Aunt Park Lane. The historic district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and includes a local historic district subject to requirements administered by the Hattertown Historic District Commission. Eleven historic residences are contributing properties of the National Register historic district, ranging in age from c.1750 (Levi Taylor House) to c.1850 (52 Aunt Park Lane). There are also several secondary structures from the same time period, such as barns, sheds, and privies that contribute to the architectural significance of the area. A schoolhouse from c.1780, now the Gregory Orchard's District School, was originally on the green (corner of Aunt Park Lane and Hattertown Road) and was moved in 1975 to its present location adjacent to the Morgan House.

Moritz Karl Georg Wiggers (October 17, 1816 - July 30, 1894), German politician, started out as a lawyer and a notary in his home town of Rostock. The Revolution of 1848 prompted him to enter public life as a representative to the Mecklenburg constitutional convention, of which he was also elected president. Once the constitution was adopted in 1849, he was elected to its legislature, again being named president. A court of arbitration in Freienwalde declared the constitution as invalid, and the legislature was dissolved in 1850. Wiggers regarded this action as illegal and called the legislature to meet again, but this was prevented by force. He was also tried for aiding the flight of Gottfried Kinkel from Spandau prison, but was acquitted. Nevertheless, he was caught up by the \\"Rostock high-treason proceedings.\\" A police agent had infiltrated Wiggers' democratic club, and in 1853, he was tried for conspiracy and imprisoned. On his release in 1857, he remained a private citizen for a decade. In 1867, he was elected as representative from the third Berlin precinct (not being permitted to run in Mecklenburg) to the Reichstag of the North German Confederation. In 1871, he was elected as representative, from Berlin and Mecklenburg, to the German Reichstag. There he served with the German Progressive Party until 1881. After this time, he devoted himself to the construction of a canal between Rostock and Berlin. He was the author of several historical studies, political pamphlets and reports on the progress of the canal. His outstanding traits were his unyielding commitment to his liberal convictions and his peaceable nature.

Education Royal Naval College, circa 1913, while it was located in Halifax, Nova Scotia John Moreau Grant was born in 1895 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. His father was the 11th Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia MacCallum Grant. One of his 5 brothers (also 1 sister) was Harold Taylor Wood Grant. He spent two years at school in Heidelberg, Germany. He returned to Halifax in 1909. In January 1911 he joined the Royal Naval College of Canada as one of a class of twenty-one cadets. He entered a strenuous regime conducted by Royal Navy instructors with a heavy emphasis on engineering subjects. He graduated as a midshipman in 1913. Naval Service He joined the cruiser , and sailed for the West Indies for training. In Mexico and Venezuela, he was part of a force sent to protect British interests against revolutionaries. After courses at Halifax, Nova Scotia he joined another cruiser, , which patrolled off the eastern seaboard of the United States where she stopped shipping to search for German nationals of military age, who were removed. Since he spoke German, he was always a member of the boarding party. He was also involved in the escort of troopships to England. He was appointed to , an I-class destroyer. He was constantly at sea, patrolling to the Hook of Holland. He escorted hospital ships to and from France. He employed anti-submarine and minesweeping methods. Asdic, depth charges, and the hydrophones used in the Great War could not be used when a ship was underway, however they were used in action against enemy submarines. He was ordered to the Mediterranean Sea in April 1918. He performed convoy, anti-submarine, and rescue work. He found that social and sports activities ashore were much improved. At Brindisi, Italy, efforts made to seal the Adriatic against movement of enemy submarines were only partially effective, since the sea was too deep to blockade. He served as the Executive Officer of HMS Beaver. He ferried troops to the Dardanelles when Turkey surrendered. He entered the Sea of Marmara and proceeded to Constantinople. In October 1918 he participated in the bombardment of Durazzo, Albania. From Constantinople they sailed to Odessa, Russia where the German army and the White Russians were attempting to keep some sort of civil order. Welcomed by the Rumanians, they sailed up the Danube where they attempted to keep the Rumanians and Bulgarians apart. In December 1918, he called at Sevastopol, Russia where he saw and visited the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which was largely abandoned and in a poor state of repair. He removed a number of political refugees from Odessa, Russia. Royal Canadian Naval College HMCS Royal Roads Hatley Castle After the Royal Naval College of Canada closed in 1931, the practice of sending Canadian naval officers to England for training was found to be expensive and unreliable.Michael L. Hadley, Robert Neil Huebert, Rob Huebert, Fred W. Crickard 'A Nation's Navy' In 1940, Rear Admiral Percy W. Nelles, then chief of naval staff, led a group of RNCC alumni who met with Angus Lewis Macdonald, then naval minister to discuss opening a college to train naval officers for the postwar navy and for civilian employment in the merchant marine. The college was to be similar to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth and to the former RNCC. In 1940, Angus Lewis Macdonald explained to the House of Commons \\"it will be a proud day for this country, when our Canadian naval effort will be directed by Canadian men, trained in Canada and operating in ships built in this country.\\" In November 1940, the Hatley Park and grounds was purchased by the Royal Canadian Navy for $75,000 to house a Naval Training Establishment. Captain Grant was appointed the first commandant of the Royal Canadian Naval College HMCS Royal Roads from 1940 to 1944. From 13 December 1940 – October 1942, HMCS Royal Roads operated as an Officer Training Establishment for short-term probationary RCNVR sub-lieutenants. Royal Roads trained cadets for the executive branch, the engineer branch and the accountant branch of the Royal Canadian Navy. He later served as the Executive Officer of the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. Grant died in 1986. Honours Grant was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The Grant Building which is the main academic building, laboratories, cafeteria, and offices at the Royal Roads Military College (later Royal Roads University) was named for Captain Grant. The building, which is on the Registry of Historic Places of Canada, was recently renovated.Registry of Historic Places of Canada – Grant Building The National Portrait Gallery in Ottawa, Ontario holds a portrait of Captain John Moreau Grant.

A member of the House of Braganza by birth, Adelgundes became a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma through her marriage to Prince Henry of Bourbon-Parma, Count of Bardi. She was also the Regent of the Monarchic Representation of Portugal and for that reason was granted the title of Duchess of Guimarães, usually reserved for the Head of the House. Early life Adelgundes de Jesus Maria Francisca de Assis e de Paula Adelaide Eulália Leopoldina Carlota Micaela Rafaela Gabriela Gonzaga Inês Isabel Avelina Ana Estanislau Sofia Bernardina, Infanta de Portugal, Duquesa de Guimarães, was born in Bronnbach, Wertheim, Germany. Her father died a few days after her eighth birthday, and Adelgundes and her siblings were educated in a Catholic and conservative environment by their mother. Her maternal uncle, Furst Carl zu Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, was like a second father to the children. Marriage Adelgundes married Prince Henry of Bourbon-Parma, Count of Bardi, fourth child and youngest son of Charles III, Duke of Parma and his wife Princess Louise Marie Thérèse of France, on 15 October 1876 in Salzburg, Austria–Hungary. Henry, who was 25 years old, had been previously married to Princess Luisa Immacolata of the Two Sicilies, who had died three months after their marriage at the age of 19 in 1874. Henry had taken part in the Carlist war and fought in the Battle of Lacar. War wounds turned him into an invalid. Their union produced no issue, as her nine pregnancies all ended in miscarriages. The failed pregnancies, the last of which she suffered in 1890, were a source of great grief to the couple. They divided their time between the Castle of Seebenstein in Austria and the Vedndrami-Caligari palace in Venice. Adelgundes spent long years looking after her paralyzed husband. The Count of Bardi was described by relatives as a disagreeable man who tyrannized his sweet, petite wife. After almost 30 years of marriage, Adelgundes became a widow in 1905. She was close to her many nephews and nieces, particularly Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde of Luxembourg, from the time of her abdication to her early death. Regent-in-absentia Between 1920 and 1928, Adelgundes acted as the regent-in-absentia on behalf of her nephew and Miguelist claimant to the Portuguese throne, Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza, who was only twelve years old when his father Miguel renounced his claim to the throne in favor of his son. At the beginning of her regency in 1920, Adelgundes was created 7th Duchess of Guimarães. In 1921 she authored a manifesto outlining the House of Braganza's goals for the restoration of the Portuguese monarchy. During her regency, Aldegundes signed an accord with ex- King Manuel II of Portugal, by which he recognized Duarte as his heir. Duarte lived with her at Seebenstein until the German occupation of Austria when the whole family relocated to Bern, Switzerland, where she died in Gunten on 15 April 1946 at age 87.

Perdix (Ancient Greek: Πέρδιξ means \\"partridge\\") was a nephew and student of Daedalus in Greek mythology. In other sources, Perdix is the parent of Talos or Attalus.John Tzetzes. Chiliades, 1.19 line 493 Mythology Daedalus was so proud of his achievements that he could not bear the idea of a rival. His sister, sometimes named as Perdix, had placed her son (variously named Perdix, Talos, or Calos) under his charge to be taught the mechanical arts. He was an apt scholar and showed striking evidence of ingenuity. While walking on the seashore, he picked up the spine of a fish or a serpent's jaw. Imitating it, he took a piece of iron and notched it on the edge, thus inventing the saw. He made a pair of compasses by putting two pieces of iron together, connecting them at one end with a rivet, and sharpening the other ends. Daedalus was so envious of his nephew's accomplishments that he took an opportunity, when they were together one day on the top of a high tower, to push him off. But Athena, who favors ingenuity, saw him falling and arrested his fate by changing him into a bird called after his name, the perdix (partridge). This bird does not build its nest in the trees, nor take lofty flights, but nestles in the hedges, and mindful of his fall, avoids high places. For this crime, Daedalus was tried and banished. In some accounts, Athena leaves Daedalus with a scar in the shape of a partridge, to remind him of what he did. Perdix is mentioned in book VIII of Ovid's Metamorphoses. According to Ovid, Perdix was the mother of Deadalus' nephew and not the nephew himself.

The Valée system (French:\\"Système Valée\\") was an artillery system developed between 1825 and 1831 by the French artillery officer Sylvain Charles Valée,Elements of Military Art and History by Nicolas Édouard Delabarre-Duparcq, p.146-147 and officially adopted by the French Army from 1828.

Ammunition: shell within sabot, 7.7 kg. The Valée system consisted in various technical improvements to the Gribeauval system and Napoleon I's Year XI system. The system mainly improved the mobility of the artillery train, and simplified maintenance by standardizing limber usage and wheel size, and reducing the number of carriage types to two. It also allowed for cannoniers to be able to sit on the ammunition chests of the battery itself during transportation, allowing the whole artillery train to move as fast as the infantry or cavalry. Valée also improved the guns themselves slightly, by making them lighter, and with a longer range.Systeme An XI and the re-design of the French Artillery. by Paul L Dawson BSc Hons FINS The complete Valée system consisted in siege guns of 24 and 16 pounds (French pounds), and field guns of 12 and 8 pounds. It also included field howitzers of 24 pounds and 6 inches (Obusier de 15 cm), and a siege howitzer of 8 inches. Mountain artillery pieces were of 12 pound caliber. Mortars were of 12, 10 and 8 inches, with a 15 inches stone mortar. Deployment Canon de 12 Valée with carriage, 1854.

It is entirely in Shanghai, except for a small section in the nearby province of Jiangsu at its northwest end. It forms the final ring in a series of four orbital roads around the city of Shanghai, with the others being the Inner Ring Road, Middle Ring Road, and the S20 Outer Ring Expressway. Part of G1503 Shanghai Ring Expressway in northern Pudong New Area is concurrent with the third ring, the S20 Outer Ring Expressway, due to the nature of the coastline of Shanghai with the East China Sea.  Route  The kilometre zero of the Shanghai Ring Expressway is located at an interchange with S20 Outer Ring Expressway and Yixian Elevated Road in Baoshan District, and increase in a clockwise fashion. Immediately to the east of the interchange, the expressway descends into the Outer Ring Tunnel, so named because this section is concurrent with S20 Outer Ring Expressway. As the tunnel ends in Pudong New Area, it becomes an elevated highway for a short portion, curving southeast and then south, reaching the Wuzhou Avenue Interchange. Here, the concurrency with S20 Outer Ring Expressway ends, with the Outer Ring Expressway continuing to the south, Wuzhou Avenue to the west, while the Shanghai Ring Expressway continues east. The expressway curves to the southeast, meeting the G40 Shanghai–Xi'an Expressway at its eastern terminus. The expressway continues southward, interchanging with S1 Yingbin Expressway, S32 Shanghai–Jiaxing–Huzhou Expressway, and S2 Shanghai–Luchaogang Expressway as it traverses Pudong New Area before curving west and entering Fengxian District. Its east section, from Longdong Avenue to former Nanhui District border, was named as Yuandong Avenue before the expressway is finished and became a ring in 2008. The expressway travels west along the southern suburbs of Shanghai, passing through Fengxian District, where it interchanges with S4 Shanghai–Jinshan Expressway and Jinshan District. At an interchange with S19 Xinnong–Jinshanwei Expressway to the south and S36 Tinglin–Fengjing Expressway to the west, the expressway continues north, passing through Songjiang District, where it intersects with the concurrent G60 Shanghai–Kunming Expressway and G92 Hangzhou Bay Ring Expressway, and Qingpu District, where it interchanges with the G50 Shanghai–Chongqing Expressway. It then leaves the direct-controlled municipality of Shanghai for a short portion, entering the city of Kunshan in Jiangsu province, where it curves to the northeast and intersects with the concurrent G2 Beijing–Shanghai Expressway and G42 Shanghai–Chengdu Expressway at the Anting Interchange. The expressway turns east, back into the Jiading District of Shanghai, where it intersects with the G15 Shenyang–Haikou Expressway and the S5 Shanghai–Jiading Expressway. Re-entering Baoshan District, the expressway becomes an elevated road, travelling above Fujin Road. At Tongji Road, the expressway curves to the south, paralleling the elevated Line 3 of the Shanghai Metro. This section is also known as Tongji Elevated Road, due to the fact that it runs above Tongji Road. At the southern end of Tongji Elevated Road, the Shanghai Ring Expressway returns to its kilometre zero marker.

Weraroa novae-zelandiae), is a hallucinogenic pouch fungus of New Zealand. Taxonomy The species was first described in the literature in 1924 by the New Zealand-based mycologist Gordon Heriot Cunningham, under the name Secotium novae-zelandiae. Rolf Singer transferred it to Weraroa in 1958. Phylogenetic analysis by Moncalvo (2002) and Bridge et al. (2008) has demonstrated the close relationship between Weraroa novae- zelandiae and the hallucinogenic blue-staining group of Psilocybe, particularly Psilocybe subaeruginosa. Phylogenetic analysis published by Borovička and colleagues (2011) shows this species is very close to Psilocybe cyanescens. Given this and the apparently distant relation with other species of Weraroa Borovička et al. (2011) suggest renaming the species Psilocybe weraroa. The specific epithet weraroa refers to the former generic name. The binomial Psilocybe novae-zelandiae could not be used, as it had already been used in 1978 by Gastón Guzmán and Egon Horak for another Psilocybe species.  Description  * Peridium: (1)3–5 cm tall, 1.5– 3 cm wide, irregularly roundish to ovate, elliptical or even depressed-globose, margin folded, light brown when young becoming pale blue-grey, often showing blue or blue-green stains with age, at first finely fibrillose becoming smooth, glabrous, slightly viscid, bruising blue when injured, slowly. Drying dingy brown. * Gleba: Chocolate or sepia-brown, sparse, chambered, contorted gill-like structures. * Spores: 11–15(17) x 5–8 µm in size, smooth, sepia-coloured, elliptic-ovate or elliptical in shape, rounded at one end with a thin epispore. * Stipe: Up to 4 cm tall, 6 mm thick, equal, cartilaginous, whitish to blue-grey, yellowish-brown at the base, hollow, bruising blue when injured. * Taste: Bitter-sweet, earthy flavor, released upon chewing of the raw fruit, probably not a taste sought after for culinary purposes. * Odor: Organic, similar to ferns, undertone of rubber. * Microscopic features: Oval Spores Weraroa virescens is often mistaken for P. weraroa since they are both naturally pale bluish, however, unlike P. weraroa, W. virescens does not stain blue. The sepia color of the gleba also serves to separate P. weraroa from similar species in the genus Weraroa. Habitat and distribution Psilocybe weraroa is found growing solitary to gregarious on decaying wood buried in forest leaf litter, often on the rotting branches of Melicytus ramiflorus. It has also been found fruiting on rotted cabbage trees and is often associated with decaying fern fronds, native to the forests of New Zealand, typically South of Wanganui in the North Island. It is fairly abundant from April till August in lowland mixed rain-forest around Wellington, Porirua, Hutt Valley, Kapiti Coast, Manawatu, and South Wairarapa . The pouch fungus has been found in winter in Central Hawkes Bay where they tend to be found around fallen pine cones - not in pine forests but in areas where pines are interspersed by other kinds of trees. They are also found in the South Island. The mushroom is sometimes hard to see because it is usually hidden under dried leaves. It is often eaten by slugs and sometimes hard to find specimens that haven't been nibbled on. Psychoactivity Psilocybe weraroa is psychoactive. Psilocin and psilocybin are the chemical components considered to be responsible for its effects, as with other blue-staining fungi of the genus Psilocybe. A cross- section of the gastrocarp.

He allowed the Victual Brothers, a pirate organization assaulting vessels of the Hanseatic League in the Baltic Sea, to use the Peene river as a winter refuge and the Bay of Greifswald as a basis.

He was then confined to Second XI appearances for three years, until he was given a short run of games in the first team in July and August 1988. These included 31 and 50 (his maiden first-class half-century) against Yorkshire, as well as the highest score of his short List A career, 36 in a Refuge Assurance League game against Sussex. The following summer, 1989, was the best of Bent's Worcestershire career. Although he had only a single (and unsuccessful) one-day outing, he played 13 first-class games and scored 530 runs at an average of just over 24. This was helped by a career-best innings of 144 against Kent at the end of July, in which he shared century partnerships with both Chris Tolley and Graeme Hick. Bent never again played such a significant part in a season: he played no more List A games, and made only seven first-class appearances in 1990 and eight in his final year of 1991. He hit one more century, scoring exactly 100 not out in an opening partnership of 225 with captain Tim Curtis against Lancashire at Stanley Park in August 1991. After the end of his Worcestershire career, Bent played minor counties cricket for Herefordshire in 1992, and unlike in his first-class days proved quite effective as a bowler, taking three or four wickets in an innings on a number of occasions.

In 2009 it was discovered that the Hubble Space Telescope had in fact directly imaged HR 8799 b eleven years earlier, in 1998, suggesting that more exoplanets might be revealed through analysis of HST photographic archives. Additional precovery images were also obtained by reanalyzing data taken in 2002 at the Subaru Telescope and in 2005 and 2007 at the W.M Keck Observatory Broadband photometry of HR 8799 b shows that it has thicker clouds in its atmosphere than do older, higher surface gravity substellar objects of the same effective temperature. Near infrared H band and K band spectroscopy of HR8799b published in May 2011 indicate a hydrogen rich, dusty atmosphere with disequilibrium CO / CH4 chemistry. Near infrared spectroscopy made with the Palomar Observatory show evidence of ammonia and/or acetylene as well as carbon dioxide, and some methane. In 2015, the signals of water, carbon monoxide and methane were reported in infrared spectra taken at the Keck telescope. However, a reanalysis of the same data in 2018 shows that water and carbon monoxide are present, but that the methane detection may have been spurious. Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope will be capable of confirming or disproving the presence of methane in HR 8799 b's atmosphere. __NOTOC__ See also * Fomalhaut b Notes References External links * Category:HR 8799 Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2008 Category:Giant planets Category:Pegasus (constellation) Category:Exoplanets detected by direct imaging ","title":"HR 8799 b"},{"id":"20239633","text":"Nicklas Söderblom is a personal trainer, actor, and author currently residing in Los Angeles, United States.

It travelled from Warwick to Killarney and operated from 1884 to 1964. Killarney railway station, circa 1905 Along with approval for the Fassifern and Crows Nest branches in 1880 came parliamentary approval for this branch. Although the owner of the large Canning Downs station offered land to enable a direct route from Warwick to Killarney, a more circuitous route was chosen to serve surrounding farms. It meant that the branch line ran 44 kilometres east from Warwick and then south to Killarney rather than take a direct 32 kilometre route through Canning Downs.\\"Triumph of Narrow Gauge: A History of Queensland Railways\\" by John Kerr 1990 Boolarong Press, Brisbane The Southern railway line reached Warwick in 1871. The terminus was then on the northern side of the Condamine River. After construction of a bridge over the river and extension of the line south to Stanthorpe, a stop at East Warwick became Warwick railway station and the old terminus was renamed Mill Hill railway station. The branch line to Killarney left the Southern Line a little beyond Mill Hill at what was called Killarney Junction. Swan Creek railway station, 1911 The Killarney branch opened as far as Emu Vale on 2 June 1884 and then to Killarney on 24 August 1885. Sidings for the first stage were located at Hermitage, Glencairn, Swan Creek, Karcaruda, Miount Sturt, Yangan and Brookbrae whilst in the second stage Danderoo, Wiyarra, Tannymorel and Grayson became stops. For the duration of the branch, a train ran six days a week. Grain traffic and cheese from a Yangan factory constituted its major cargo and, after the discovery of coal at Mount Colliery east of Tannymorel, it too contributed greatly to the profitability of the line. From 1930, a railmotor operated the run. The Mount Colliery Tramway, a private 5 km-long horse tramway, opened in 1908. The tramway joined the line at Tannymorel to transport coal from a nearby mine to the railway. The Killarney line, together with the colliery tramway, closed on 1 May 1964.

Migrations of distinct ethnolinguistic groups have probably occurred as early as 10,000 years ago. However, about 2.000 BCE early Iranian speaking people and Indo-Aryans have arrived in Iran and northern Indian subcontinent. Pressed by the Mongols, Turkic peoples oftenly migrated to the western and northern regions of the Central Asian plains. Prehistoric migrants from South China and Southeast Asia seem to have populated East Asia, Korea and Japan in several waves, where they gradually replaced indigenous people, such as the Ainu, who are of uncertain origin. Austroasiatic and Austronesian people establish in Southeast Asia between 5.000 and 2.000 BCE, partly merging with, but eventually displacing the indigenous Australo-Melanesians. In terms of Asian people, there is an abundance of ethnic groups in Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of the continent, which include arctic, subarctic, temperate, subtropical or tropical, as well as extensive desert regions in Central and Western Asia. The ethnic groups have adapted to mountains, deserts, grasslands, and forests, while on the coasts of Asia, resident ethnic groups have adopted various methods of harvest and transport. The types of diversity in Asia are cultural, religious, economic and historical. Pamirs Some groups are primarily hunter- gatherers, whereas others practice transhumance (nomadic lifestyle), have been agrarian for millennia, or have adopted an industrial or urban lifestyle. Some groups or countries in Asia are completely urban (e.g., Qatar and Singapore); the largest countries in Asia with regard to population are the China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Japan, Philippines, Vietnam, Iran, Thailand, Burma, and South Korea. Colonisation of Asian ethnic groups and states by European peoples began in the 16th century, reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (except in the former Soviet Union, which was dissolved in 1991). Central Asia Ethnic map of Central Asia Central Asia, in its most common definition, is deemed to consist of five former Soviet Socialist Republics: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. In a wider view, Xinjiang of western China, Mongolia, Afghanistan, and northern Pakistan are included. Turkic, Indo-Iranian, and Mongolic peoples comprise its general ethnicities. The main religions of Central Asia are Islam (Turkic/Indo-Iranian peoples) and Buddhism (Mongolia). Central Asia has a long, rich history mainly based on its geographical location along the ancient Silk Road. It has been conquered by Mongols, Tibetans, Timurids, Uzbeks Persians, Tatars, Russians, Afghans and Sarmatians, and thus has a very distinct, vibrant culture. The culture is influenced by Chinese, Indian, Persian, Afghan, Arabian, Turkish, Russian, Sarmatian and Mongolian cultures. The music of Central Asia is rich and varied and is appreciated worldwide. Meanwhile, Central Asian cuisine is one of the most prominent cuisines of Asia, with cuisines from Pakistan, India, China and Azerbaijan showing significant influence from the foods of Central Asia. One of the most famous Central Asian foods is kebab. The literature of Central Asia is linked with Persian literature as historically it has been part of the Persian Empire for a lot of its history. Furthermore, sitting at the junction of the Silk Road, it has numerous Chinese, Indian and Arabian literary works. East Asia Ethnolinguistic map of China East Asians is a term used for ethnic groups that are indigenous to East Asia, which consists of China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, and South Korea. The major ethnic groups that form the core of East Asia are the Han, Joseon, and Yamato. Other ethnic groups of East Asia include the Bai, Hui, Tibetans, Manchus, Ryukyuan, Ainu, Zhuang, and Mongols. The major East Asian language families are the Sinitic, Japonic, and Koreanic families.Sinitic means relating to China or the Chinese. It is derived from the Greco-Latin word Sīnai ('the Chinese'), probably from Arabic Ṣīn ('China'), from the Chinese dynastic name Qín. (OED)Shimabukuro, Moriyo. (2007). The Accentual History of the Japanese and Ryukyuan Languages: a Reconstruction, p. 1.Miyake, Marc Hideo. (2008). Other language families are Tibeto-Burman, Ainu languages, Mongolic, Tungusic, Turkic, Miao–Yao, Tai–Kadai, Austronesian and Mon–Khmer. Throughout the ages, the greatest influence on East Asia historically has been from China, where the span of its cultural influence is generally known as the Sinosphere laid the foundation for East Asian civilization. Chinese culture not only served as the foundation its own society and civilization, but for also that of its East Asian neighbors, Japan and Korea. The knowledge and ingenuity of Chinese civilization and the classics of Chinese literature and culture were seen as the foundations for a civilized life in East Asia. China served as a vehicle through which the adoption of Confucian ethical philosophy, Chinese calendar systems, political and legal systems, architectural style, diet, terminology, institutions, religious beliefs, imperial examinations that emphasized a knowledge of Chinese classics, political philosophy and culture, as well as historically sharing a common writing system reflected in the histories of Japan and Korea.Edwin O.

JSTOR The relationship between China and its cultural influence on East Asia has been compared to the historical influence of Greco-Roman civilization on Europe and the Western World. Major characteristics exported by China towards Japan and Korea include shared Chinese-derived language characteristics, as well as similar social and moral philosophies derived from Confucianist thought. The script of the Han Chinese characters has long been a unifying feature in East Asia as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to its East Asian neighbors. Chinese characters became the unifying language of bureaucratic politics and religious expression in East Asia. The Chinese script was passed on first to Korea, Vietnam in the 1st century, then to Japan, where it forms a major component of the Japanese writing system. In Korea, however, Sejong the Great invented the hangul alphabet, which has since been used as the main orthographic system for the Korean language. In Japan, much of the Japanese language is written in hiragana, katakana in addition to Chinese characters. North Asia Uralic, Altaic, and Yukaghir languages European influences, especially Russian, are strong in the southwestern and central part of the region, due to its high Russian population from Eastern Europe which began to settle the area in the 18th-century CE. For the most part, North Asia is considered to be made up of the Asian part of Russia solely. North Asia is geographically the northern extremity of East Asia and the physical characteristics of its native inhabitants generally resemble that of East Asians, however, this is principally divided along political lines under separate national identities, particularly that of China, Mongolia and Russia. The main ethnic groups of the region speak languages of the Uralic, Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic language families, along with East Slavs and various \\"Paleo-Siberian\\" peoples, with most of these ethnic groups being composed of nomads or people with a nomadic history. The geographic region of Siberia was the historical land of the Turkic people, the Tatars, in the Siberia Khanate. Russia, under expansion of its territory however, took control of the region now known as Siberia, and thus today it is under Russian rule. There are roughly 33 million people in North Asia. South Asia Language families in South Asia Traditional Rajasthani garments from Jaipur, Rajasthan South Asia, in general definition, consists of the countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The five Southern Indian states and north- eastern Sri Lanka share a Dravidian culture, due to the prominence of Dravidian languages there. The Brahuis of Pakistan also belong to Dravidian people group. Sri Lanka has two main languages, Sinhalese which has Indo-Aryan roots and Tamil which has Dravidian roots. Bangladesh and the Indian province West Bengal share a common Bengali language and culture. The provinces of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan of Pakistan share a common Dardic and Tibetic heritage with the Indian territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Similarly the Punjab province of Pakistan and Indian state of Punjab share a common Punjabi ethnicity, language and culture. In Pakistan, the two western regions of Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa share a greater Iranian heritage and while the provinces of Sindh share a more Indo-Aryan culture. Iranian is most prevalent in Afghanistan, with significant Turkic speakers. Regions of Nepal and parts of the Indian states and territories of Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Sikkim and Uttarakhand have cultural similarity to Tibet, Tibetan Buddhism being the dominant religion there. Finally the Northeast Indian states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and tribal groups of Assam and Tripura have cultural affinities with South East Asia. Bhutanese are often referred to in their literature as \\"Bhote\\" (people of Bhutia/Bhotia or Tibet). They follow Tibetan Buddhism to and it is a dominant political and cultural element in modern Bhutan. Their language, Dzongkha, is the national language and is descended from Old Tibetan. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, religions founded in the region that is today's India, are spread throughout the subcontinent. Islam and Christianity also have significant region-specific histories. While India and Nepal have a majority of people following Hinduism, Sri Lanka and Bhutan have a majority of Buddhists alongside Hinduism. Islam is the second largest religion after Hinduism with Muslim countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh. Indo-Aryan languages are spoken in most of North, East, West and Central India; Nepal; Bangladesh; Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Dravidian languages are spoken in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Maldives, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Tibeto-Burman languages are spoken in the hills of Bangladesh, Nepal, North Pakistan, North and North East India. Austroasiatic languages are spoken in certain northern and eastern areas of Bangladesh, parts of Nepal and scattered across different zones of India mostly concentrated around Chota Nagpur Plateau and the state of Meghalaya. Iranian languages are most prevalent in Afghanistan and western Pakistan. Turkic speakers are significant in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan as well. Southeast Asia Southeast Asia is often split into two parts: Mainland Southeast Asia, comprising Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam; and Maritime Southeast Asia, which includes Brunei, East Timor, Indonesia, East Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. China has historically influenced the region more than India, most notably through the large Chinese populations in many of the countries of the region. Demographically, Southeast Asia has had little Western immigration, although Western influence still exists due to the lasting legacy of colonialism. One example is the Philippines, which has been heavily influenced by Spain and slightly by the United States of America over the course of almost four centuries of colonisation. A common feature found around the region is stilt houses, while another is rice paddy agriculture, which originated in the region thousands of years ago. Dance is also a very important feature of the culture, utilizing movements of the hands and feet perfected over thousands of years. Furthermore, the arts and literature of Southeast Asia is very distinctive as some have been influenced by Indian, Hindu, Chinese, Islamic and Buddhist literature.

Photographed in Cyprus in 1873. West Asia is sometimes referred to as \\"Southwest Asia\\". West Asia consists of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, most of Turkey and Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Culturally, the region's dominant ethnic groups are Arab (about 150 million), Turkic (about 60 million), Persian (about 50 million) and Kurds (about 35 million). Other indigenous minorities include Greeks (600 thousand), Jews (6.2 million), Assyrians (about 400,000), Armenians (about 4.5 million), Azeris (about 40 million), Mandaeans, Yazidis, Circassians, and others. Many of the West Asian countries contain expansive deserts, and thus many nomadic groups exist today, most notably the Bedouin Arabs.

Pre-Grouping The 14 locomotives in this class were built at Brighton railway works and appeared in traffic between September 1876 and October 1883, intended for those duties where the limited water supply of a \\"D-tank\\" might prove to be a handicap. They were frequently employed on lightly loaded fast continental boat trains between London and Newhaven, and so were named after European cities. Thus they were frequently known as the \\"Lyons Class\\", after the first locomotive No.300 Lyons. The class performed well for a quarter of a century, and achieved good mileages but when they began to require major repairs, it was decided to withdraw the class and use the newer B2 and C2 class locomotives in their place.

Best known as the creator, executive producer, and actress on Global TV hit comedic drama Da Kink in My Hair. Early life Paul was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, to a father from Dominica and a mother from St. Kitts and Nevis. She is the younger sister of Green Party of Canada leader, Annamie Paul. Her upbringing created the foundation for her work as a social and cultural innovator. With academic roots in Birmingham Conservatory for Classical Theatre, Ngozi began her acting career on stage at the Stratford Festival of Canada. Career During the course of her professional career, Paul has worked in theatre and film projects and with performers such as Tonya Lee Williams, star of the popular daytime drama The Young and the Restless. In addition, Ngozi has been cast, most notably, with fellow actors Don Cheadle, Chiwetel Ejiofor (Talk to Me) and Rachel Weisz (The Whistleblower). In 2003, Paul was listed as one of Toronto's top ten actors by Now Magazine. She is the recipient of the prestigious Tyrone Guthrie Award for her work with the Stratford Festival, and was Best Actress nominee at the International Black Film Festival for her performance in the film Banyan. She played a leading role in Charles Officer’s Genie-nominated film Short Hymn, Silent War, featured at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. More recently, Paul played a young Nelson Mandela in the Toronto production of the screenplay In the Freedom of Dreams: The Story of Nelson Mandela. Paul’s production credits include founding Ngozika Productions, which showcases film and TV projects from an Afro-Canadian perspective. In addition to being co-producer of the Tonya Williams Gospel Jubilee, Paul served as the creative director, associate producer, story editor and as a writer on the Gemini-nominated series Lord Have Mercy! (2003). Paul was a participant of Talent Lab, a four-day intensive program for emerging filmmakers interested in mobile movie filmmaking. Following the groundbreaking and successful run of the theatre production Da Kink in My Hair, Ngozi co-created, executive produced, and starred in the television series of the same name (2007-2009). This top-rated sitcom has been broadcast and celebrated around the world. In 2015, Paul's The Emancipation of Ms. Lovely—which she penned and in which she starred—was nominated for six Dora awards and won Outstanding New Play. This hilarious and evocative tale weaves Paul’s personal stories with the story of Sarah Baartman (aka The Venus Hottentot) in a transcontinental allegory on the black woman’s multitudinous identity. Lovely prompted Toronto’s Now Magazine to write, “The magnetic Paul holds every moment onstage in a fierce, funny and moving performance.” Paul remains steadfast in her mission to produce innovative, evocative, and compelling content that showcases the diversity of human experience. She currently has a docu-series on-air entitled Care for Color and is in advanced development of The 1st Time Project, a multi-platform documentary exploring female sexuality from inter-generational and inter-cultural perspectives. Paul donates her time and talents towards raising awareness for social issues such as domestic violence and homophobia within the West Indian community. In 2005, she was a celebrity cast member for the Toronto performance of The Vagina Monologues with proceeds helping local organizations assist women in abusive relationships. Paul has traveled the world extensively in both personal and professional capacities, most notably as a global ambassador for Because I’m A Girl and the Stephen Lewis Foundation.

Background After recording the minimalist Mark Twang, Hartford returned to the studio with a band. The new material leaned more toward country-rock than bluegrass, which he would continue with 1977's Dillard Hartford Dillard collaboration and All in the Name of Love. The instrumental \\"John McLaughlin\\" is a tribute to the jazz/fusion guitarist. For the CD release (Flying Fish FF70028), the track \\"Joseph's Dream\\" has been replaced by a recording of the song \\"Get No Better\\". This recording is an alternative version to the one released on the Dillard Hartford Dillard release Glitter-Grass from the Nashwood Hollyville Strings. There has been no definitive explanation for this substitution. Thus, this studio version of \\"Joseph's Dream\\" remains unreleased on CD. It was, however, released as a digital download. Reception Writing for Allmusic, critic Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. called the album \\"highly eccentric\\" and wrote \\"Hartford's approach on Nobody Knows What You Do is just about as far out as Hartford ever ventured...

The station occupies the same site as the former Aylsham South railway station, which operated here between 1880 and 1952. History Aylsham South railway station, the first on this site, opened in 1880.Branch opening recorded here. It was operated by the East Norfolk Railway, then the Great Eastern Railway, and became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station passed into the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. In 1952 the passenger service stopped, and the freight service was discontinued in 1977. The fine period station buildings stood after closure until 1990, when the Bure Valley Railway opened. Taking over the site, the original buildings were deemed unsuitable for the new project, and were demolished.Norfolk By Rail. The new Aylsham railway station was constructed on the site, and opened on 10 July 1990. Facilities A train prepares to depart from platform 2 at Aylsham railway station. The station has three platforms. Platform 3 sees only occasional passenger use, but is used for stock storage. Platforms 1 and 2 are in regular use. Both are linked to a central locomotive release road. These two platforms and the central release road are all supplied with terminal headshunts, all of which are linked via a complex tri-directional set of points. Platforms 1 and 2, and the release road, are all protected by an overall station roof. (These platforms were originally numbered 2, 3, and 4, but were re-numbered as 1, 2, and 3 as the original platform 1 had been subsumed into the new Aylsham locomotive depot.) The modern station buildings contain a cafeteria, booking office, staff room, shop, administrative offices, toilets, and entrance foyer. Additionally, a substantial wooden building has been set up on platform 3 by the supporters association, the Friends of the Bure Valley Railway. There is a large car park. Alongside the station is the railway's Aylsham Locomotive Depot, a large three-track engine shed, capable of housing all the railway's locomotives. Behind the locomotive depot is the railway's main engineering workshop, equipped to carry out running repairs or full-scale locomotive overhauls. This facility also contains locker rooms, wash rooms, and administrative offices for the railway's engineers. The operating facilities of the station also include a turntable, several sidings (used primarily for engineering vehicles), facilities for fueling and watering locomotives, and a signal box containing the main line control centre, from which computerised control and radio communication are used to operate the block section system of train control.

The population is included in the civil parish of Lessingham.  History  The placename Eccles comes from the Latin ecclesia meaning church, and usually indicates an early British Christian site, as ecclesia was not taken into the Anglo-Saxons' vocabulary, other than in inherited place names. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, Eccles-on-Sea was a thriving community of some , but as it was situated in a low-lying area on the North Norfolk coast it was prone to inundation. The manor of Eccles was in medieval times part of the territory of the Earls of Norfolk and later of the Bishops of Norwich. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it was granted by the Crown to the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Nicholas Bacon, and his heirs. After the death in 1622 of Sir Nathaniel Bacon, who had no male heirs, it passed by inheritance to the family of his second wife, Dorothy Hopton. It then passed by sale to the Lamb family and, in 1712, to the Green family. In 1605, according to William White's History, Gazetteer, and Directory of Norfolk, 1883, the inhabitants petitioned for a reduction in their taxes when only 14 houses and of land remained following a ferocious storm in 1604.\\"History, Gazetteer, and Directory of Norfolk, 1883\\". GENUKI. However, this 1604 date cannot be verified by reference to the storm record, and probate evidence clearly demonstrates that by the early 17th century Eccles had been united with Hempstead for some thirty years. By 1881 it had only 17 inhabitants and comprised of land divided into two farms. Today the majority of the area is occupied by the Bush Estate – a collection of about 200 mostly pre-war bungalows tucked in behind the sand dunes. The Bush Estate was originally a simple holiday retreat, with just one well between the inhabitants and no mains drainage or power. However, over the years the properties have been improved, the utility companies subsequently laid on mains drainage, electricity and telephones and the community took on a more permanent feel. Today about half the dwellings are occupied all year round and many of the more temporary structures have been rebuilt as conventional bungalows. The community at Eccles is now nestled behind concrete sea defences constructed after the North Sea flood of 1953.  Church of St Mary The circa 12th- century round-tower church of Eccles St Mary next the Sea was badly damaged by storms in 1570, with the nave and chancel dismantled soon after. The parish of Eccles St Mary was combined with neighbouring Hempstead St Andrew by a Deed of Union dated January 1571. The church steeple, comprising a basal round tower surmounted by an octagonal belfry was not demolished in recognition of its usefulness as a seamark, and perhaps as a lighthouse. Thereafter Eccles became part of the combined parish of Hempstead with Eccles, although rectors continued to be appointed to St Mary's until the late 19th century as a sinecure, defined as 'a Rectory without cure of souls.' The steeple remained close to the foreshore, often surrounded by sand dunes, for some 350 years, although coast erosion continued to affect the area throughout that time. In 1605 the villagers applied for a reduction of taxes in a document entitled 'the ruynated state of the town of Eccles' explaining that some 2,000 acres of land and 66 households had been lost to the sea by that time. By the early 19th century the sea advanced, chewing ever more land away and the sand dunes were pushed back around the church. When Robert Ladbrooke engraved the tower for his series of illustrations of the churches of Norfolk in 1823, the tower was still, just, on the landward side of the dunes. By 1893, the church was not only on the beach, the chancel ruins had been destroyed... The fact that the tower stood until 1895 and formed such a local landmark made it an attraction for early photographers and so we have a number of early plates, most notably the fine image taken by a Mr Fitt, a Norwich photographer c.1890, and which was reproduced and sold in some numbers by him after the tower fell. ... it has been possible to show that the parish church was originally a two- celled building which had a round west tower... and a south aisle subsequently added. The tower is difficult to date, but from its size, proportions and coursed flint walling, appears to be Norman in date, probably of the 12th century.\\"Sand, Sea and Sherds: Intertidal Archaeology on the East Norfolk Coast, Tim Pestell, 2001. In January 1913, a large storm reportedly exposed much of the church and the village of Eccles.The Calumet News 27 January 1913, Page 5 In the 1960s it is said that the location of the church was obvious from two large piles of flint, but they are covered by sand today. For a 15-year period from the mid-1980s the site of Eccles, by then designated as the Eccles Deserted Medieval Village was exposed by beach scours, most notably in 1991 and 1993. An archaeological watching brief undertaken at the time identified the church ruins, evidence of burials, ancient trackways and foundations of former dwellings in the vicinity of the church, including some dozen abandoned water wells. Excavation of these wells produced a wide range of metal, leather, timber and pottery all dateable to the late 16th century, indicating that the village had been abandoned at that time.Stannard D. \\"The Timing of the Destruction of Eccles juxta Mare\\" Norfolk Archaeology XLVI (2014), 45-54 Norfolk County Council Archive has a few Victorian prints of the tower still standing, although publication is not permitted.

In the shooting, 22-year-old culinary arts student Matti Juhani Saari shot and killed ten people before committing suicide. Eight students had been killed ten months before in the Jokela school shooting in southern Finland. The Government of Finland held a crisis meeting, and declared a national day of mourning for September 24, with ministers agreeing that Finland's laws pertaining to gun ownership should be reviewed. Suggestions included introducing legislation to aid police officers in accessing information about the mental and physical health of applicants for firearms licenses, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. The question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns was also raised. The Finnish Police increased Internet surveillance, and investigated over 200 threats against schools. In November the police announced the increased surveillance had stopped a potential attack against a school. At the affected college all lessons were cancelled for the remainder of the week, and classes were relocated to a temporary facility. The town's other schools remained open. A candlelight vigil was held near the school grounds on the day after the shooting, and Kauhajoki Church held a memorial service on the evening of September 23. The Finnish Red Cross announced that some of the proceeds from its annual fund drive would be contributed towards helping students and teachers affected by the incident. Government national flag flown outside the school at half-mast. This practice was observed across the country on September 24. After the incident a crisis meeting was held, with government ministers, chairs of the parliamentary groups, and police officials all in attendance. Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen described it as a \\"tragic day\\" and appealed for unity in the hope \\"that events like these will not happen again.\\" A national day of mourning was declared for the following day, and Vanhanen travelled to Kauhajoki to meet with students. After the meeting, Justice Minister Tuija Brax said that Finland's laws pertaining to gun ownership should be reviewed \\"as soon as possible\\", and Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen pledged government action. Neither specified what measures the government would be taking. Finland's population owned an averaged total of 2.9 million firearms within a population of 5.2 million people, and thus ranked as having the third highest gun ownership rate in the world, behind only the US and Yemen, according to a 2007 small arms survey carried out by the Graduate Institute of International Studies. The government had previously discussed raising the minimum age for owning a gun from 15 (with parental consent) to 18 after the Jokela High School shooting (Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the shooter in that incident, was aged 18), but no law regarding this had taken effect. On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister said that a review was necessary, with Vanhanen suggesting that the time had come to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered. Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who had ordered the original investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the mental and physical health of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009. Despite these assurances that change would be forthcoming, Holmlund came under considerable pressure from some members of parliament, particularly those in the Left Alliance, to resign for not acting sooner. Leading the call for her deposition was Anneli Lapintie; Tarja Filatov, parliamentary group leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) also questioned the government over what it had done since the Jokela incident. Vanhanen launched a defence of the government by saying that inquiries were ongoing, even into the Jokela case. A survey by pollster Taloustutkimus for YLE showed that dissension towards Holmlund was not widespread: only a quarter of members from smaller parties felt she should step down, only 10% of SDP members (with 80% supporting her to stay on), and 90% of the government's partners wanted her to hold onto her ministry. Amongst the population, 82% felt she should continue. Brax said that personal data protection legislation needed to be adjusted to allow a freer access to information among professionals. She said that this had impeded the investigation into the Jokela incident, and meant that people in the teaching profession were left unable to help students to some degree. Police Police vehicles at the scene of the Kauhajoki shooting Police Chief Paatero said that he would support a blanket ban of semi-automatic pistols. Paatero, like Brax, announced a change in policy vis-à-vis information. It was announced the National Bureau of Investigation (KRP) would increase its Internet surveillance, entailing longer working days for KRP officers and more officers being assigned to the task of monitoring Internet activity. However, he said that scrutiny would not extend to private websites, as doing so would be like \\"looking for a needle in a haystack;\\" the KRP said its main policy when surveying the Internet was still to respond to tip-offs. Paatero faced opposition from police posts across the country, most of whom claimed that the resources allocated towards IT, and staffing, were insufficient. Within days of the shooting, the police said they had received a sizeable number of tip- offs alerting them to suspicious photographs, videos, and comments on chat rooms. In December the police announced that they had received over 200 threats in the months following the shooting. Finnish media reported that several bomb threats and other threatening messages were circulating among students nationwide in the few days after the shootings as well. Areas affected included Kajaani, Siikajoki, Rauma, Masku, Joroinen, and Liminka. Kauhajoki was not immune to this, and a police spokesman, Urpo Lintala, said that threats of a secondary incident (unspecified by police) were causing \\"fear and hysteria among young people.\\" To help cope with threatening SMS messages circulating in the nearby town of Seinäjoki, an anonymous tip-line was set up by police. The threats of copycat incidents included: *Kajaani, where an 18-year-old man was detained after threatening to shoot people at his school. Later a 23-year-old man was detained for talking about blowing up the school. *Keuruu, where a school was evacuated after a bomb threat. Two 15-year-olds were later detained. *Joroinen, were the local school was sealed off by the police following a bomb threat. An 18-year-old student of the school was detained. *Masku, where another 15-year-old boy reportedly frightened people by making threats. His case came under investigation by police, but no charges were lifted. *Kuopio, where an 18-year-old vocational student was detained for uploading ominous material to IRC-Galleria. The student also created a fan group dedicated to the perpetrator on the site, albeit it was only intended to be a prank. The fan group included a link to the website of an artist also called Matti Saari, which led to him press charges on the student for defamation. The State Secretary and assistant to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools could no longer be considered isolated incidents, and that police and security forces had to approach them with a new perspective in the aftermath of Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more emergency exits, and better access to the architectural lay-out of school buildings for police. Each school is to undergo a risk assessment before the implementation of this plan. In November 2008 the police announced their increased surveillance of the Internet had stopped a potential attack against a Finnish school. They did not specify which school was under threat, but revealed the suspect was receiving treatment. Students and residents of Kauhajoki In the aftermath of the shootings, all lessons at the college were cancelled for the remainder of the week, and classes were relocated to a temporary facility the following Monday. The town's other schools remained open. A candlelight vigil was held near the school grounds on the day after the shooting, and Kauhajoki Church held a memorial service on the evening of September 23. A second memorial service, on September 28, the Sunday following the shootings, was held, with the President and students attending. Three members of the congregation lit a further eleven candles (one for each killed, including Saari) at the service. Leading the service was Bishop Simo Peura, who reflected on Finland's treatment of young people, asking the question, \\"What kind of society are we building?\\". Residents and members of the media gathered around the vigil. The Finnish Red Cross, which had been quick to descend upon the scene in the immediate aftermath, said that some of the proceeds from its annual fund drive, which began two days after the shootings, would be contributed towards helping students and teachers affected by the incident. This would include financial provisions for the ongoing counselling services being provided. On the day after the killings, the head of the State Treasury, Pekka Syrjänen, said that students would be able to seek compensation from the state for physical and psychological damage caused by the shootings. This was in accordance with the Crime Damage Act, which also stipulated that payments were to be adjusted in relation to other forms of compensation that the students received. Claimants were able to apply if they had suffered a loss of earnings, pain and suffering, or damage or loss to personal belongings as a consequence of the attack. Relatives were also able to gain compensation for costs incurred whilst caring for those affected, or funeral or hospital bills. The total compensation demanded by families of the victims came to 830,000 euros. Victims' families were also reported to want the police inspector who did not confiscate Saari's gun in the days before the shooting (Saari was interviewed in relation to his internet videos), who was charged with dereliction of duty, to be additionally charged with involuntary manslaughter. Assessment of society A number of criticisms were made of Finnish society in response to the shootings. Bishop Peura asked whether the nation had been blind to young people's problems, and Juha Mieto, Centre Party member and Kauhajoki representative, said that societal \\"malaise\\" was due to a decline in traditional lifestyles, and lack of order. Psychologist Salli Saari, from the Helsinki University Central Hospital, said that the country had not responded adequately to calls after the Jokela incident that boys had been neglected within the schooling system. Matti Rimpelä, a professor of welfare in Helsinki, attributed the problems with young people to a lack of institutional support in schools and daycare, which had not been provided due to Finland's rapid change from being a predominantly rural country to a \\"post- industrial information society\\". Rimpelä and Jukka Mäkelä, a child psychologist at the National Research Development Centre for Welfare and Health in Helsinki, concurred that Finland had a cultural problem surrounding suicide, while daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat wrote in an editorial that, \\"The Web cannot be held responsible for this, but you can certainly ask how much the Web feeds the dark side of human nature\\". Other Like those in the police force, many in the medical profession were reluctant to abide by the new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.

Retrieved January 13, 2020 (11 February 1940 - 14 December 2019), known as 'Lord' Tim Hudson, was an English DJ. He worked in Los Angeles for KFWB during the mid 1960s and was the manager of The Seeds and The Lollipop Shoppe. He was also a voice actor, an artist and a sports manager, notably of the cricketer Ian Botham. His obituary in The Times characterised him as a \\"colourful chancer\\". Biography Hudson was born George Timothy Bramwell in Prestbury, Cheshire, and was educated at Strathallan School, Perthshire. His father served in Bomber Command in World War II and died in a raid over Belgium in 1944. His mother remarried Henry Hudson in 1948; his stepfather owned a cotton business. Tim Hudson lived in London in the early 1960s, became a member of the fashionable \\"Chelsea Set\\", and claimed responsibility for introducing The Moody Blues to Decca Records. Hudson then moved to Montreal, Canada, where, as \\"Lord Tim of Liverpool\\", he became a successful DJ on station CKGM. Biography, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 13 January 2020 When The Beatles embarked on their 1965 North American concert tour, radio station KCBQ in San Diego employed Hudson. He described himself as a record producer who claimed to know The Beatles personally, and to have helped discover the Moody Blues. Hudson made broadcasts publicising the \\"Fab Four\\"'s appearances in the San Diego area. Using his contacts in England, Hudson managed to get permission to travel with the group prior to their concert in San Diego, and to file reports to be aired exclusively on KCBQ. However, it was said of him that: > He used his suave British accent to promote himself and became particularly > popular among women. His problems surfaced, despite his claims to the > contrary, when he could not do the simplest of tasks such as working the > controls, playing records, or punching in ads. Having never before been on > the radio, all he could do was sit in the studio and talk on the microphone. > His brief stint at KCBQ, in terms of radio work, was one of the station’s > worst staffing disasters. In March 1966, Hudson presented Nancy Sinatra in Hollywood, California, with a gold disc to mark her million seller, \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\". However, as the actual gold record had failed to arrive in time from New York, Hudson had to present Sinatra with the similarly earned disc of Dean Martin's \\"Everybody Loves Somebody\\"; at one point, Hudson was engaged to Martin's daughter. In 1967, he became the manager of The Seeds, promoting the band and writing liner notes for their record releases. At the time, he claimed to have invented the term \\"flower power\\". He later managed another band, The Lollipop Shoppe, but left the music industry, disillusioned, in 1969. Hudson was also a voice actor during the 1960s and 1970s, and appeared in Disney's The Jungle Book (1967) as Dizzy the Vulture, and The Aristocats (1970) as 'Hip Cat' the English cat. In the early 1970s, he invested in property in Hollywood, remarried, and set up what he claimed was the first organic food restaurant in Hollywood. Later in the decade he had a radio show, Hudson's Theater of the Mind, on station KXLU. Returning to England, he bought Birtles Old Hall near Macclesfield in Cheshire, with an attached cricket ground, in 1984. A keen cricket fan, he invited the professional cricketer, and one-time England captain, Ian Botham to play in a match in at his ground. After Botham had been convicted on drugs charges, Hudson offered to become his manager, and promoted Botham in Hollywood as a potential film star, suggesting to film producer Menahem Golan that Botham could be the next James Bond. However, Botham became disillusioned with Hudson's plans, and eventually fired him. Hudson hosted celebrity cricket matches at the ground, known as the \\"Birtles Bowl\\", throughout the 1980s; he later sold both the house and the cricket ground.

Format The format of the show was simple. An elderly lady named Liz showed what items are needed for this week's shopping list (first announced by the presenters on their radio show the previous Friday). She placed them one by one on the counter of her sweet shop. \\"Drop the Prop\\" saw a prop dropped from the ceiling with the numbers 1–5 in a circle upon it. An audience member was then asked to pick a number which was torn off by one of the presenters to reveal one of five names. The person corresponding to that name was invited down from the audience to play the game. Another prop was dropped against a background of the show's theme music. It contained the numbers 1-5 as well, this time with five separate topics. The contestant chooses their number and thus their topic. Typical topics were Shakespeare, Colin Farrell and U2. A selection of skypers was scrolled randomly along a large screen in the studio. The contestant had thirty seconds to either refuse (\\"next\\") or choose (\\"I want you\\"). The contestant had to answer a question based on the chosen topic. If they answered correctly they won money for themselves and the contestant. Either way another similar prop was soon dropped. This contained five challenges. \\"Random Guy\\" gave a demonstration of the chosen topic, e.g. sticking pins up his nose. The skyper had to then successfully complete this task within a specific time limit to win more money for themselves and the contestant. If successful the contestant remained to play the next round but another skyper was chosen. If unsuccessful another contestant was chosen via the same route and the game begins again. There were other random inserts such as \\"Celebrity Skyper\\" and one where Jim-Jim asked an audience member what a skyper could do. Colm clutches the prop, a central component of the show. Colm and Jim-Jim watch Random Guy as he attempts to eat pizza.

Fuerty is known for a ruined church and ancient graveyard on the site of a Celtic Christian abbey. Church and graveyard It is said that Saint Patrick visited Fuerty and left a deacon to found a monastic settlement here. The deacon, Justus, baptised Saint Ciarán, a local man around the year 500. Ciaran went on to found Clonmacnoise, which became one of the most important monasteries and centres of learning in Europe. Two 8th century granite grave slabs in the west side of the tower bear inscriptions that can still be read. One of them bears the name of Ardeachan, Abbot of Clonmacnoise. The abbey was attacked and destroyed by the English Elizabethan invaders and all its monks were slain. Later, during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, it is claimed in a book by Skeffington Gibbon (published in 1829) that Cromwellian troops, under the leadership of Colonel (or Major) Ormsby, 'immolated' (ie killed by fire) more than one hundred elderly clergy at Fuerty abbey. The existing ruins are of a 17th- century Church of Ireland. The tower was added in 1790 but the church was destroyed by fire in 1870.

Clevosaurus was extremely similar to the modern tuatara in almost every way; the two genera differ in only certain features of the teeth and skull anatomies, as well as size. Clevosaurus was smaller than the modern tuatara. Clevosaurus possibly ate plants as well as insects, as suggested by the form of the teeth. Fossils of Clevosaurus, as well as other sphenodontians, early mammals and dinosaurs have been found in ancient cave systems of Great Britain. Clevosaurus is now believed to have had Pangaean distribution. In regards to its Pangaean distribution, C. hadroprodon is the oldest record of a sphenodontian from Gondwana. Discoveries Some fossils from South America (into Geopark Paleorrota) found in 2006 represent a new species of Clevosaurus (C. brasiliensis). A new species has been named Clevosaurus sectumsemper after the spell from Harry Potter. In August 2019, Clevosaurus hadroprodon, thus far the oldest fossil of sphenodontians in former Gondwana, was discovered. Species Below is a cladogram of the relationships within Clevosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis of Hsiou et al. (2015): \\"Clevosaurus\\" latidens was recovered outside of Clevosauridae, as the sister taxon of Opisthodontia. It was subsequently assigned to a new genus, Fraserosphenodon, in 2018.

The feedback provider and the feedback consumer are the two formal endpoints of the feedback loop (blue arrow). Senders need to subscribe, possibly using a web form similar to the one depicted on the upper left corner, in order to become feedback consumers. Recipients typically click a spam button on a web mail page to start the process. A feedback loop (FBL), sometimes called a complaint feedback loop, is an inter-organizational form of feedback by which a mailbox provider (MP) forwards the complaints originating from their users to the sender's organizations. MPs can receive users' complaints by placing report spam buttons on their webmail pages, or in their email client, or via help desks. The message sender's organization, often an email service provider, has to come to an agreement with each MP from which they want to collect users' complaints. Feedback loops are one of the ways for reporting spam. Whether and how to provide an FBL is a choice of the MP. End users should report abuse at their mailbox provider's reporting hub, so as to also help filtering. As an alternative, competent users may send abuse complaints directly, acting as mailbox providers themselves.  Rationale  Marketers striving for their mail to be delivered have a twofold advantage: they can remove subscribers that don't want to receive that kind of advertising (listwashing), and they can analyze the complaint rate and hence how their advertising meets market expectations. By unsubscribing users who complain, marketers reduce their overall complaint rate per IP or domain, ensuring that targeted mail is much more likely to reach subscribers who actually want to receive it. ESPs, when playing the sender's role, are very sensitive to how sending mail on behalf of their customers may affect their reputation. Monitoring the complaint rate is one of the ways they can control what their users are sending. One-click unsubscription A weakness of FBL is its relative asynchrony, which can produce glitches. A possibly large time interval sits between ESP subscription to an FBL and a recipient clicking the junk button. The interval between that click and actual deletion of the recipient name from the list is much shorter, but may be noteworthy in the case of huge mailbox providers such as Gmail or AOL. Bulk messages can provide information on how to unsubscribe directly, in the header fields \`List-Unsubscribe:\` and \`List-Unsubscribe-Post:\`. Besides providing a more direct, better way to unsubscribe, that also allows to tell apart unsubscription from junk reporting (for example, one can report that a message posted to a discussion list is junk, while staying subscribed.) The author explains .  Reporting process  # Spencer sends a message to Alice. # Alice complains to Isaac (her ISP or MP) about the message, e.g. by hitting the report spam button. # Isaac encapsulates the message as either an Abuse Reporting Format MIME part, or (less commonly) a standalone message/rfc822 MIME part, and sends it to Spencer if Spencer has signed up to receive that feedback. As sketched above, the process implies that Spencer, besides being the author (or sender) of the message, is connected to the postmaster responsible for his mail domain. Subscribing to an FBL usually involves the postmaster's authorization. An FBL subscriber may or may not forward abuse reports to the relevant authors. If no subscribers exist for a given mail domain, Isaac can omit sending an abuse report at all. In fact, subscriptions have to be done one by one, a laborious task that mail domains not engaged in mass mailing may want to skip. addresses the latter shortcoming by proposing auto-subscribe just-in-time FBLs, which can be started by sending an unsolicited abuse report with further directives (at a minimum, a way to unsubscribe). Ipsos noted that a majority of respondents to a survey on spam reporting marked messages as spam based solely on the subject and sender data. For years, end users have been told not to trust email unsubscribe links, so many users hit the spam button as an alternative to unsubscribing. Consequently, report spam may act as unsubscribe in some cases. One of the reasons not to hit unsubscribe links is to avoid confirming that the message had been received and opened.  Reporting formats  The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) is the standard format for FBL reports. Much like bounce messages, whose design is inherited by ARF, an abuse report consists of a human readable part, followed by a machine readable part, and the original message. The report is characterized by a Feedback-Type field whose values may indicate one of abuse, fraud, virus, or other (more types are registered at IANA). Microsoft, who use the name Junk Mail Reporting (JMR), also use their own format. Google's Gmail is beta testing a non-traditional FBL with select ESPs. Gmail uses their own format—an aggregate report that reveals spam rate per notable sender. SendGrid reports that the Gmail FBL, developed and launched by Julian Tempelsman and Sri Somanchi, is effective at identifying spam that other anti-spam systems miss.  Criticism  * The report spam button is said by some to often be used improperly. * The feedback loops fail to meet the generic anti-spam criterion of not generating more email messages. Even if the amount of feedback is just a fraction of the number of messages that an ESP sends out, most ESPs are not yet organized for handling it. * Using the same button for both abuse reports and list unsubscribe implies guesswork by the (automated) help desk. For example, it does not ease reporting to a list owner that a specific post in the (non moderated) list is actually spam. * Some FBLs provide no option for communicating feedback automatically to multiple parties: the sender, the ESP (if one is involved), or the upstream datacenter/network address provider—as currently construed by the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) \\"Follow the Money\\" strategy. * The majority of ESP offering Feedback Loop do not include in the report the email address of the recipient, who marked the message. This makes it impossible to remove the recipient from the mailing list, where it has subscribed. Such ESPs' practice encourages mailing-lists providers to send individualized message to each recipient (contrary to sending everybody literally the same message), so that mailing list providers can extract from the individualized message coming over the feedback loop the original recipient.

It provides an extensive overview of mathematics, and is noted for the high caliber of the contributors. The book was a 2011 winner of the Euler Book Prize of the Mathematical Association of America, given annually to \\"an outstanding book about mathematics\\".......... Topics and organization The book concentrates primarily on modern pure mathematics rather than applied mathematics, although it does also cover both applications of mathematics and the mathematics that relates to those applications; it provides a broad overview of the significant ideas and developments in research mathematics. It is organized into eight parts: *An introduction to mathematics, outlining the major areas of study, key definitions, and the goals and purposes of mathematical research. *An overview of the history of mathematics, in seven chapters including the development of important concepts such as number, geometry, mathematical proof, and the axiomatic approach to the foundations of mathematics. A chronology of significant events in mathematical history is also provided later in the book. *Three core sections, totalling approximately 600 pages. The first of these sections provides an alphabetized set of articles on 99 specific mathematical concepts such as the axiom of choice, expander graphs, and Hilbert space. The second core section includes long surveys of 26 branches of research mathematics such as algebraic geometry and combinatorial group theory. The third describes 38 important mathematical problems and theorems such as the four color theorem, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, and the Halting problem. *A collection of biographies of nearly 100 famous deceased mathematicians, arranged chronologically, also including a history of Nicolas Bourbaki's pseudonymous collaboration. *Essays describing the influences and applications of mathematics in the sciences, technology, business, medicine, and the fine arts. *A section of perspectives on the future of mathematics, problem solving techniques, the ubiquity of mathematics, and advice to young mathematicians. Despite its length, the range of topics included is selective rather than comprehensive: some important established topics such as diophantine approximation are omitted, transcendental number theory, differential geometry, and cohomology get short shrift, and the most recent frontiers of research are also generally not included. Target audience The book's authors have attempted to keep their work accessible by forgoing abstraction and technical nomenclature as much as possible and by making heavy use of concrete examples and illustrations. Compared to the concise and factual coverage of mathematics in sources such as Wikipedia and MathWorld, the articles in the Princeton Companion are intended to be more reflective and discursive, and to convey the beauty and depth of modern mathematics. Quoting a passage from Bertrand Russell that \\"Pure Mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form p implies q\\", the editor of the Companion states that it \\"is about everything that Russell’s definition leaves out.\\" The core sections of the Companion are aimed primarily at readers who are already familiar with mathematics at the undergraduate level. Much of the rest of the book, such as its collection of biographies, would be accessible to a mathematically inclined high school student, and there is enough depth of coverage in the book to interest even professional research mathematicians. Reviewer Jonathan Borwein summarizes the audience for this book broadly:In his review, Robin Wilson expresses very similar sentiments: \\"Once in a while a book comes along that should be on every mathematician’s bookshelf. This is such a book.\\" Contributors The contributors to The Princeton Companion to Mathematics consist of 133 of the world's best mathematicians. Timothy Gowers, its editor, is the recipient of the Fields Medal, considered to be the top honor in mathematics. Other contributors include Fields medalists Michael Atiyah, Alain Connes, Charles Fefferman, and Terence Tao, and well-known mathematicians Noga Alon, George Andrews, Béla Bollobás, John P. Burgess, Clifford Cocks, Ingrid Daubechies, Persi Diaconis, Jordan Ellenberg, Oded Goldreich, Andrew Granville, Jeremy Gray, Frank Kelly, Sergiu Klainerman, Jon Kleinberg, János Kollár, Peter Lax, Dusa McDuff, Barry Mazur, Carl Pomerance, Eleanor Robson, Peter Sarnak, Madhu Sudan, Clifford Taubes, and Avi Wigderson. Among the historians who contributed to it are Charles C. Gillispie, Ivor Grattan-Guinness, Jeremy Gray, Niccolò Guicciardini, Ulf Hashagen, Eberhard Knobloch, Karen Hunger Parshall, Eleanor Robson, and Erhard Scholz.

Early life Edwin was the eldest son of William Field and was born at Leam, near Warwick. He was educated at his father's school, and on 19 March 1821 was articled to the firm of Taylor & Roscoe, solicitors, of King's Bench Walk, Temple. For some years after arriving in London he lived in the family of the junior partner, Robert Roscoe, to the influence of whose artistic tastes he attributed much of the pleasures of his later life. Edgar Taylor (died 1839), the senior partner, was also known as a scholar. At Michaelmas term, 1826, Field was admitted attorney and solicitor. He had thoughts of beginning business in Warwick, but remained in London on the advice of James Booth, joining his fellow-clerk, William Sharpe (1804–1870), brother to Daniel and Samuel and nephew to the poet Samuel Rogers, to form the firm of Sharpe & Field, in Bread Street, Cheapside in 1827. Henry Ellwood was their first clerk. In 1835 Taylor, who was then alone, took Sharpe and Field into partnership with him. The office of the firm was long in Bedford Row, London, afterwards in Lincoln's Inn Fields.Gordon (1888) Jurist and dissenter In 1840 Field came forward as an advocate of chancery reform. His Observations of a Solicitor attracted much attention. In 1841 two of his suggestions were carried out, by the abolition of the Exchequer of pleas as a court of equity, and the appointment of two additional Vice-Chancellors. The energy with which he continued to press his views had much to do with the passing of the Court of Chancery Act 1842,5 & 6 Vict. c. 103 by which the Six Clerks and Sworn Clerks were abolished, and the path was opened for further improvements in the efficiency and economy of chancery proceedings. In 1844 Field was in communication with the Board of Trade on the subject of a winding-up act for joint-stock companies. The Joint Stock Companies Act 1848 substantially embodied the proposals contained in a draft bill laid before the legal adviser of the Board of Trade on 27 April 1846, by Field and his friend Rigge, who had formerly been in his office. As early as 1846 Field took up the question of reform in the system of legal remuneration, advocating an ad valorem system, with the option of special contract. He had the support of Lord Langdale, then Master of the Rolls, and pressed the matter on various legal societies, giving evidence on the subject in July 1851 before a committee of the House of Lords. Lord Westbury's bill of 1865, on which Field was consulted, was not passed but the act of 1870 gave effect to his views so far as regards the option of contract. In 1861 he was appointed on a royal commission to report on the Accountant General's department of the Court of Chancery. The Courts of Justice Building Act 186528 & 29 Vict. c. 48 and Courts of Justice Concentration (Site) Act 186528 & 29 Vict. c. 49 were largely promoted by his exertions. He was secretary to the royal commission appointed in that year to prepare a plan for the new Royal Courts of Justice, and declined any remuneration for his services. As a unitarian dissenter, Field was naturally interested in the decisions in the Hewley Fund and other cases, which invalidated the title of unitarians to any trust property created before 1813, the date of their legal toleration. Field suggested the remedy of an act of parliament, and was the mainspring of the agitation which secured the passing of the Dissenters' Chapels Act 1844, making the legal toleration of unitarian opinion retrospective and, in the case of all dissenting trusts not in favour of specific doctrines, legalising the usage of twenty-five years. His co- religionists raised a sum of £530 in acknowledgment of Field's unpaid services. He applied it towards the rebuilding of his father's meeting-house at Kenilworth. A further memorial of the passing of the act was the building of University Hall, Gordon Square (opened 16 October 1849), towards which Field himself collected much money. In 1847 he was consulted by Robert Hibbert about a trust which he was proposing to create, with the aim of securing a higher culture in the ministry of his denomination. The provisions of the trust deed (executed 19 July) were mainly due to Field's suggestions. He induced Hibbert to modify his original plan in favour of what has become practically an endowment for research, and which produced, since 1878, the annual series of Hibbert Lectures. His third cousin Thomas Field Gibson assisted him with both the Hibbert Trust and University Hall. Art From 1857 Field exerted himself in procuring a measure for establishing artistic copyright. He worked hard for the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862, though it did not do all he desired. In reply to the thanks of the Society of Arts, he wrote that no labour he could ever give would repay his obligations to art and artists. Field's maxim was, Have one horse, and one hobby. The beginning of his love for art he traced to a Warwickshire artist, William Ryder. Early in his professional life he introduced a drawing class at the Harp Alley school, and taught it once a week. Forced to rusticate at Ventnor by a broken leg, he spent a long vacation in sketching. From this period art was the perpetual joy of his busy life. He taught it to working men, cultivated it in the \\"conversation society\\" founded at his residence, Squire's Mount, Hampstead, and pursued it in successive long vacations on the Thames, at Mill House, Cleve, near Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. His original sketches fill many folios. He greatly assisted Henry Crabb Robinson in forming the Flaxman Gallery at University College, London. He was a member of the committee of the fine art section of the 1862 International Exhibition. In 1868 he took a leading part in framing the scheme for the Slade School of Art (opened 1871) in connection with University College. Few things gratified him more than the token of regard presented to him in 1863 by his artist friends of the Old Water-colour Society, in the shape of a portfolio of their original drawings. Personality, death and memorial Writing in 1888, Gordon observed, \\"Field's character impressed even casual acquaintances, and accounted for the warmth and range of his friendships. All his ideals were high; and his pace and force were tremendous. His convictions were strong; equally strong was his love of independence in others. ‘Do you believe that heresy is the salt of the earth?’ was a characteristic question of his. A certain bluffness of manner expressed the rapidity of his mind, without veiling his robust goodness of heart.\\" He was twice married:Gordon rev. C. Pease-Watkin (2004) *In 1830, to Mary, daughter of Sutton Sharpe and sister of Samuel and Daniel Sharpe. Mary died at Leamington in 1831, soon after the birth of her son Rogers, named after his great-uncle, the poet Samuel Rogers; and *In 1833, to Letitia, daughter of Robert Kinder, by whom he had seven children. His sons Basil and Allen followed the legal profession, Walter Field devoted himself to art. Field was drowned in the Thames by the capsizing of a boat on 30 July 1871 while in company with Henry Ellwood, his old clerk. Both were good swimmers but their strength had been exhausted in supporting another clerk, who could not swim, and was saved. On 4 August he was buried at Highgate Cemetery, in a vault next to that of his friend Robinson. A statue stands in the Royal Courts of Justice. References Bibliography *Gordon, A.

He repeated the role of Pelléas at the Manhattan Opera Company in 1908 and at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo. He appeared in numerous other world premieres, most notably Ramiro in Ravel's L'heure espagnole (1911) and leading roles in Messager's Véronique (1898) and Fortunio (1907). Périer's other roles at the Opéra-Comique included Clément Marot in La Basoche, Juliano in Le domino noir, Lindorf in Les contes d’Hoffmann, Lescaut in Manon, Ulysse in Télémaque, Laerte in Mignon, César in Les rendez-vous bourgeois, Caoudal in Sapho, Francois in Le Chemineau, Crispin in Le légataire universel and Auguste in L'enfant roi.Wolff S.

His was a declamatory art, and he created convincing characters with the help of his clear diction and his ability as an actor. In addition to his opera career, he acted in several films between 1900 and 1938. His voice on one of the seven published recordings he made (Act 2 of Véronique, 1904) is described as dry and husky.Cohen J. Sing high, sing low. Classic Record Collector, Spring 2007; 48:24–28.

The lake is roughly oval shaped being approximately three miles in length east to west and two miles (3 km) north to south. Grindstone Lake is in size (including islands) with a maximum depth of and a shoreline of .Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources information on Grindstone Lake, including a map. The lake has a small inlet stream (Grindstone Creek) that enters on the east shore of the lake and that originates from a series of springs (Upper Grindstone, Grindstone, Graveyard, and Lower Grindstone Springs) that are located a short distance northeast of the lake.See United States Department of the Interior Geographical Survey, Reserve Quadrangle, 7.5 minute series. There is an outlet on the southeast shore of the lake that leads through a small stream (also called Grindstone Creek) to Lac Courte Oreilles. Grindstone Lake is located approximately six miles southeast of the city of Hayward, the primary commercial and retail center of the area, and is one of three large natural lakes (Lac Courte Oreilles, Grindstone Lake, and Round Lake) located to the south and east of the city. There is a small unincorporated residential community on the south side of the lake commonly referred to as Northwoods (or North Woods) Beach. The eastern part of the lake is located in the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. The shore of the lake is principally occupied by seasonal lake cabins and homes. There are two public boat landings on Grindstone Lake: an improved landing at the southwest corner and a small, unimproved landing at the southeast corner near the outlet stream. A large commercial Cranberry bog was formerly located on the southwest shore of the lake near the improved boat landing but has now been closed. Grindstone Lake is a popular resort area drawing cabin owners and visitors from the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Milwaukee, and Chicago metropolitan areas. Origin of name The Dictionary of Wisconsin History states that the name \\"Grindstone Lake\\" originates from the Chippewa word Gaa-zhiigwanaabikokaag meaning \\"a place abundant with grindstones.\\"This dictionary was formerly found on the Wisconsin Historical Society website but is no longer present on that website. According to the WorldCat site the book itself is available at the Wisconsin Historical Society. However, the lake has not always been referred to as \\"Grindstone Lake\\" in the past. Henry Schoolcraft in the report of his expedition through this area in 1831 called it \\"Lac du Gres\\" which means \\"Sandstone Lake\\" in French.Schoolcraft's Expedition to Lake Itasca; ed. Philip P. Mason; Michigan State University Press; East Lansing; 1958 (page 115). Captain James Allen who accompanied Schoolcraft on an expedition in the following year (1832) to the source of the Mississippi River produced a detailed map of the northern Minnesota/Wisconsin area after that trip. On this map he labels Grindstone Lake in English as \\"Sandstone Lake.\\"Reproduced picture of Allen's map.Note that the published reports of Schoolcraft's 1832 expedition have no indication that the participants actually visited Grindstone Lake during that trip. Accordingly, it appears that Allen based his drawing and name of the lake on information provided by others, perhaps from Schoolcraft himself who had visited that area the year before in 1831 as described above. See, generally, Schoolcraft's Expedition to Lake Itasca; ed. Philip P. Mason; Michigan State University Press; East Lansing; 1958. History Prior to European exploration, the area of Grindstone Lake was inhabited by the Ojibwa Indians. The first known visit by Europeans to the area was around 1659 when Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers travelled from Chequamegon Bay on Lake Superior southward through the area and stayed for a period at an Indian village that has been identified as being located on the nearby Lac Courte Oreilles.The Explorations of Pierre Esprit Radisson; ed. Arthur T. Adams; Ross & Haines, Inc.; Minneapolis; 1961 (pages 128-130). The editor indicates that Lac Courte Oreilles was identified as the location of the Indian village by Father Chrysostome Verwyst in Parkman Club Papers (No. 11), vol. II, pp. 1-24. Adams also argues that the visit occurred in 1661 rather than 1659, the year normally ascribed to the visit. Grindstone Lake was apparently well travelled by Indians and early traders and explorers who used it as part of the route from Lac Courte Oreilles (in the Chippewa River watershed), through Grindstone Lake and Windigo Lake and over the Namekagon Portage, to the Namekagon River (in the St. Croix River watershed). A later explorer, Jonathan Carver, passed through the area in 1767 and (on his way from the Indian village on Lac Courte Oreilles to the Namekagon River) specifically travelled through what the editor identifies as Grindstone Lake on June 29, 1767.Journals of Jonathan Carver; ed. John Parker; Minnesota Historical Society Press; St. Paul; 1976 (pages 129 and 167). The area was later visited by Henry Schoolcraft in 1831 who described crossing from the St. Croix River watershed to the Chippewa River watershed by ascending the Namekagon River, crossing the Namekagon Portage, and passing through Windigo Lake (called by him Lac des Isles) and Grindstone Lake (called by him Lac du Gres) to Lac Courte Oreilles.Schoolcraft's Expedition to Lake Itasca; ed.

He sold the bar in 1989 but remained a fixture there until shortly before his death. The bar still retains his name. Tarracino was politically active in Key West politics running for mayor four times before winning office in 1989 by only 32 votes out of more than 6,000 cast. He sought to \\"limit Key West's growth and to keep its reputation as a refuge for eccentrics and renegades who had found their way to the southernmost point of the continental United States.\\" As mayor, he preserved Key West's daily sunset celebration but he lost a bid for re- election in 1991 to Dennis Wardlow, \\"prime minister\\" of the tongue-in-cheek protest secessionist Conch Republic.

Later he moved into broadcasting, after being offered a job immediately following a feature interview to the BBC African Service. He changed careers and became a producer for the BBC World Service specialising in African affairs. After five years in radio, in which he specialised in current affairs, documentaries and drama, Terrill joined BBC television as a documentary producer, making investigative documentaries and observational films and series about communities all over the world. As a programme maker, Terrill has always favoured anthropological methodology, particularly participant observation,Participant observation—a type of research strategy. It is a widely used methodology in many disciplines, particularly, cultural anthropology, but also sociology, communication studies, and social psychology. Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, or sub cultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their natural environment, usually over an extended period of time. rather than more conventional documentary making techniques.

Other notable films/series he made for the BBC were Subway, Yellow Line, Race Game, Miami Wild, HMS Brilliant, Alison's Last Mountain, Beloved Country, Soho Stories (see below), The Cruise, Jailbirds, Tito's Story, Through the Eyes of the Old and The Ship. After 20 years at the Corporation, and with over 100 prime time films and numerous awards to his name, he left the corporation in 2003 after being headhunted by Elisabeth Murdoch for her newly set up Shine company. For Shine Terrill made several prime time music and arts films and a major series about the Royal Navy (Shipmates BBC1). Two years later Terrill set up his own company, Uppercut Films, and began to specialise in military and high adventure documentariesUppercut also has a small but vibrant arts department which specialises in theatre based films due to Terrill's passion for live theatre: \\"When you have your own film company you can choose what films you want to make—it is like having a massive toybox full of all your favourite toys.

The Radio Times published one article about Terrill's work which was titled rather provocatively: Meet the Explorer who Makes Bear Grylls Look Like Barbie In 2009 Terrill made a series on the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London, called Theatreland for Sky Arts. This was an intimate portrait of theatre people at work and featured Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Anna Friel. In the same year he made a two-part film series about Royal Marines, badly injured in Afghanistan, attempting to climb in the high Himalayas (Wartorn Warriors—Sky1).This series was shortlisted for the 2010 Mind Mental Health Media Awards and one of the films' main contributors, Marine Danny Claricoates, received 'The Speaking Out Award' for his courage in talking so openly about his own Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after seeing his two best friends blown up and killed in front of him. In 2010 he spent six months on in the Caribbean filming counter narcotics operations as well as humanitarian disaster relief during the hurricane season (Royal Navy: Caribbean Patrol for Channel Five and National Geographic). In 2011 Terrill returned to working with the Royal Marines when he joined 42 Commando in the dangerous Nad e Ali (north) district of Helmand Province. This was for a 6-part series commissioned by Channel Five entitled \\"Royal Marines: Mission Afghanistan\\" transmitted in January/February 2012. In late 2011 Terrill embarked on a project that brought together the military and the theatre. The Theatre Royal, Haymarket (where Terrill had filmed Theatreland in 2009) put on a play using injured soldiers and marines as the actors, singers, and dancers. The play, written by the poet Owen Sheers and based on the experiences of the soldiers mostly in Afghanistan, was called The Two Worlds of Charlie F and was performed on 22 January 2012. Terrill's feature-length film entitled Theatre of War, documenting the preparation of the play, was shown on BBC1's Imagine strand and was nominated for a prestigious Grierson Award in the best arts documentary category. In 2014 Terrill's current affairs film for the BBC: Marine A: Criminal or Casualty of War? won the Evcom Clarion Award for ethics in journalism. In 2015 Terrill became a Fellow of the Maritime Foundation and was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Throughout 2016 and 2017 Terrill was embedded in the ship's company of to make a major series for the BBC about the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy, \\"Britain's Biggest Warship\\". He returned to HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2018 and spent four months at sea to make a second series, \\"Britain's Biggest Warship: Goes to Sea\\". This focuses on the marrying of the ship with the F35 Lightning Stealth Fighter off the eastern seaboard of the US. In January 2018 Terrill was conferred Doctor of Science at the Winter Congregation of Durham University \\"for pioneering work in anthropology and filmmaking\\" Terrill lectures widely on film making techniques – especially on working solo in the field. He holds regular workshops at the London Film School. Personal life In 1999 Terrill was engaged for a brief period to former glamour model Heather Mills. He proposed to her on a fishing boat whilst sailing up the Mekong River in Cambodia, where they were making a film about landmines. Terrill is now married to the BAFTA award-winning filmmaker Christine Hall. On 9 February 2013 Terrill received a full apology in open court from News Group for repeatedly hacking his phone in 2005/06. They also paid undisclosed but substantial damages plus costs.

The case has been the subject of much criticism in failing to effectively clarify the area of mistake to identity.Elliot 2004Foster 2004MacMillan 2004, p. 373 Facts A rogue went to a dealer to buy a Mitsubishi Shogun on hire purchase. The rogue told them that his name was Mr Patel and produced Mr Patel’s driving licence. The dealer communicated with Shogun Finance, which did a credit check on Mr Patel. Finding no problems, Shogun Finance authorized the hire purchase agreement and the rogue drove away. The rogue then sold the car to Mr Norman Hudson, who had no knowledge that the vehicle belonged to Shogun Finance and was subject to an apparent hire purchase agreement. Shogun Finance brought a claim against Mr Hudson for the return of its vehicle. Mr Hudson relied on section 27 of the Hire Purchase Act 1964, which creates a statutory exception to the common law principle that \\"nemo dat quod non habet\\" (nobody can pass better title than he has), since a non-trade buyer of a car who buys in good faith from a hirer under a hire purchase agreement becomes the owner. Judgment In a 3-2 decision, the majority of the House of Lords held there was no contract of hire purchase between Shogun Finance and the rogue, section 27 of the Hire Purchase Act therefore did not apply and the car was not Mr Hudson's. Lord Hobhouse, Lord Phillips and Lord Walker followed the principle established in Cundy v Lindsay, a contract where identity is of key importance is void if the purchaser lies about their identity. The face-to-face exemption established by Phillips v Brooks Ltd did not apply because the seller was not the dealer but the finance company. Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett dissented, arguing that a better policy would be to remove the face-to-face distinction and protect the good-faith purchaser in all cases: Such an idea was proposed by the Law Reform Committee in 1966 in its twelfth report. That would mean that in all cases of mistake to identity, contracts would be voidable, rather than immediately void. Therefore, if the original seller did not repudiate the contract before the goods have been sold on, the third party would be protected. Reception The result of Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson is that the area of mistake to identity retains the 'face to face' distinction: contracts of immediate vicinity differ from contracts made over distance. Such a distinction has been labelled \\"artificial and unfair\\"Elliott 2004, p. 385 to third parties, who bear the entire loss if, at least in the instant case, it is argued that Shogun Finance Ltd had far better means to uncover the rogue's fraud than the independent purchaser;Elliot 2004, p. 386 in any case, the original seller is usually in the better position to protect and insure against such risks.Foster 2004, p. 13 See also * Cundy v Lindsay *Morrisson v Robertson *Misrepresentation in English law *Mistake in English law Notes References * Elliot, C (2004). \\"No justice for innocent purchasers of dishonestly obtained goods: Shogun Finance v Hudson\\", Journal of Business Law, May 2004 * Foster, A (2004). \\"Sale by a non-owner: striking a fair balance between the rights of the true owner and a buyer in good faith\\", Coventry Law Journal, 9(2) * MacMillan, C (2004). \\"Mistake as to identity clarified?\\", Law Quarterly Review, 120(Jul) External links *Full text of the judgment from parliament.uk Category:English misrepresentation case law Category:English mistake case law Category:House of Lords cases Category:2003 in case law Category:2003 in British law ","title":"Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson"},{"id":"20240541","text":"The Profession of Arms () is a 1983 Canadian documentary film directed by Michael Bryans and Tina Viljoen.

Originally from Trinidad and Tobago, he settled in England in the 1950s. He is most widely recognised as one of the founding figures of the Notting Hill Carnival in London, United Kingdom. Biography Russell Henderson was born in Belmont, Port-of-Spain, where he grew up. He founded the Russell Henderson Quartet in the 1940s and was soon well known in Trinidad, accompanying calypsonians such as Lord Pretender, Mighty Growler and Roaring Lion.Stephen Spark, \\"Russell Henderson – panman, pianist and pioneer\\", Soca News, 23 August 2015. He was also pianist for Beryl McBurnie's dance troupe at the Little Carib Theatre in Woodbrook, and taught melodies to the steelpan pioneer Ellie Mannette of Invaders Steelband.\\"Russell Henderson\\" at Best of Trinidad. In 1951, Henderson travelled to England to study piano tuning at the North London Polytechnic. He settled in England and founded Britain's first steelband combo (The Russ Henderson Steel Band) with Mervyn Constantine and Sterling Betancourt in late 1952. They played their first gig at The Sunset Club at 50 Carnaby Street.\\"Sterling meets Russel Henderson: The beginning of UK Steelbands\\", Nostalgia Steelband. Retrieved 24 July 2014. Other compatriots Henderson worked with in the early London days were calypsonians Lord Kitchener and Young Tiger.Val Wilmer, \\"Russ Henderson obituary\\", The Guardian, 24 August 2015. From 1962 Henderson began playing on Sunday lunchtimes at the Coleherne pub on Old Brompton Road, Earls Court, where he wa joined by other West Indian jazz musicians including Joe Harriott and Shake Keane.\\"The rise and fall of the drinking club\\", Black London Histories: Black London, 1958 to 1981, quoting Valerie Wilmer, \\"Sunday at the Coleherne\\", Flamingo, August 1964, pp. 23–25. Henderson was vitally involved in building up Notting Hill Carnival, having played at the first Children's Carnival there in 1964. In 1966, a street party for neighbourhood children turned into a carnival procession when Henderson decided to liven things up by leading his steel band down the street, followed by a growing crowd. He was a friend of the 606 Club in London, where he performed a monthly show with his revised jazz quartet, sharing the evening with the Al Whynette Band. In his retirement Henderson gave numerous interviews with BBC Radio 4 and BBC Four on his Notting Hill past. Russell Henderson died on 18 August 2015 at the age of 91. Honours * In 2006 Henderson was appointed a member of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for Services to Music. * On Friday, 24 August 2012, just prior to the Notting Hill Carnival weekend, the Nubian Jak Community Trust organised the unveiling of two blue plaques in Notting Hill at the junction of Tavistock Road known as \\"Carnival Square\\", to honour the contributions to the development of Carnival by two \\"living giants\\": Russell Henderson, the Trinidadian musician who led the first carnival parade in 1965, and Leslie Palmer, also from Trinidad and Tobago, who is credited with helping transform the local community festival into an internationally recognised event.Lizzie Davies, \\"Notting Hill carnivalgoers hope to put seal on London's summer-long party — Spirits are particularly high this year after multicultural success of the Olympics\\", The Observer, Sunday, 26 August 2012.

The saeta () is a revered form of Spanish religious song, whose form and style has evolved over many centuries. Saetas evoke strong emotion and are sung most often during public processions. Performance The saeta by Julio Romero de Torres (1918). The saeta is a song of Catholic Spain dating back many centuries.Manuel Ríos Ruiz at page 71. The saeta's etymology is not clear. The saeta antigua [old saeta] probably arose from the recitation of psalms under the influence of liturgical music.Ángel Álvarez Caballero at pages 126-127. \\"Saetas vary greatly in form and style, ranging from simple syllabic melodies to highly ornamented ones.\\"Willi Apel, Harvard Dictionary of Music (Cambridge: The Belknap Press 1944, 1969) at 748. In the older tradition, solemn drums and horns might accompany the singer, or the saetero sang alone. Since the nineteenth century, however, the more favored saetas have incorporated distinct elements associated with Flamenco music, particularly the siguiriyas.Ángel Álvarez Caballero at 125-129. The saeta is best known for its mournful power during Holy Week in Spain.The week in the Church calendar of the Entry into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection. The song is performed during the processions by religious confraternities that move slowly through the streets of cities and towns in southern Spain.Ángel Álvarez Caballero at p. 127.Domingo Manfredi Cano p. 183-184.Context and background of confraternities: Payne pp. 105-106, 183; French similarities, p. 106. Possessing a plaintive emotional intensity, and dramatic charge, the saeta is sung by the saetero, often from a balcony, and may be addressed to the statue of Jesus below, in his agony on the Via Dolorosa, or to that of his suffering mother Mary.José Carlos de Luna p. 51-52. These and other crafted statues are mounted on platforms and carried along the streets on the shoulders of several penitents who pass among the assembled public.Timothy Mitchell at 137-154, 170-180. The immediate emotional response to the saeta, often of intense sorrow, may be the reason for its name, as the Spanish word saeta can mean \\"arrow or dart\\".Andrés Batista at 16, 72.Saeta can also mean \\"bud of a vine\\" or \\"hand of a clock\\" or \\"magnetic needle\\". Appleton's New Cuyás Dictionary, v.2 (NY 1928; Cumbre, México 16th ed. 1966), p. 488. Saetas are also sung at outdoor devotions throughout Lent, and may be sung during the Christmas season as well. A special form of the saeta (the saeta carcelera) is also sung at prisons during visits there by the confraternities.Timothy Mitchell at 76-79. Several of the cities in Andalusia have their own peculiar styles of the saeta.Julian Pemartin at 138. Four intentions or themes have been distinguished from the religious lyrics, which mark the music of Saeta: descriptive, praising, prayerful, and exhortative.Manuel Ríos Ruiz at p. 72, approving earlier work by Ricardo Molina and Antonio Mairena. The music The saeta is frequently sung a cappella. Taken from flamenco music are the melismas, tercios, and other flourishes. Although the saeta is one of the cantes a palo seco, the singer may also be accompanied, e.g., by beating drums, and horns. Arabic and Hebraic origins have been proposed.Ángel Álvarez Caballero at 126, quoting Durán Muñoz, Andalucía y su cante (1968).Félix Grande at I: 161-162, referring to the Kol Nidrei. Palos of flamenco adopted by the saeta include especially the siguiriyas and the martinetes. Other forms include the saeta por soleares, the por polos, the por cañas, and the por fandangos.Ángel Álvarez Caballero at 129; he quotes Hipólito Rossy on the musical transformation: \\"El martinetes ya no suena a martinetes, sino a saeta.\\" [\\"The martinetes no longer sound like martinetes, but as saeta.\\"] Flamenco guitar accompaniment may be in or time, or may interchange regularly between and .The saeta por siguiriyas alternates between and time (\\"1, 2, 3, and a 4, and a 5\\"). Cf., Andrés Batista at 16, 18, 72, 74. Commonly the saetero sings in a minor key finishing on the dominant; the meter of different verses will often be variable depending on the interpretation. The cantaor Manuel Torre (1878–1933) was well regarded for his Saeta.Ángel Álvarez Caballero at 199-200.Manuel Ríos Ruiz at p. 74. Its passion Of a diverse heritage, the Saeta has become the emotional artistic fruit of several cultures. The Gypsies \\"se sienten identificados con los episodios de la Pasión y consideran a Jesús como un hermano en desgracia que sufre persecusión y muerte.\\"Ángel Álvarez Caballero at 129. The Gitanos \\"see themselves in the scenes of the Passion and look upon Jesus as a brother of sorrows who suffers persecution and death.\\" Nothing of course substitutes for hearing and bearing witness to the Saeta. > \\"La saeta, pues, costituye la síntesis antropológica del andaluz (hondura, > plástica, señorío, dolor metafísico) coronada en santidad. La saeta exige un > máximo de veracidad pasional, por lo mismo que a nadie le es dado > encaramarse en la audacia de sus ayes sin la potencia y la certeza que > brinda la posesión heroica del dolor.\\"Anselmo González Climent at 317. \\"The > saeta, well, it constitutes the anthropological synthesis of the Andalucian > (profundity, adaptiveness, aristocracy, metaphysical sadness) crowned with > holiness. The saeta demands the maximum of true passion, so that nobody is > given to rise above by their bold cries without the potential, the certainty > of being offered the heroic possession of suffering.\\" It is said that Andalusians must talk to God during Holy Week, singing the Saeta during a cofradía procession being a mode of choice.Domingo Manfredi Cano at 183.Manuel Ríos Ruiz at pp. 72-74.

He was also a much admired old friend of the nationalist politician, Frank Hugh O'Donnell, and the poet and novelist Katharine Tynan.Laurence J. Kettle, Material for Victory: The Memoirs of Andrew J. Kettle, Right Hand Man to Charles Stewart Parnell (Dublin, 1958) Biographical Note (XVII). Early life and career Born into the Jacobean- style manor, Drynam House, Swords, Co. Dublin and educated at Ireland's most prestigious Catholic boarding school, Clongowes Wood College, he was an affluent farmer owning various holdings in County Dublin. He married Margaret McCourt, daughter of Laurence McCourt of St. Margaret’s, Finglas, North Co. Dublin. They lived mainly in Millview House, Malahide, Co. Dublin and had twelve children, among whom were the industrial pioneer, Laurence Kettle, and the writer, poet, Irish Volunteer and Member of Parliament (MP) at Westminster, Thomas Kettle, a man widely regarded as one of the greatest minds of his generation, who died in World War I. He and his father were members of the Repeal Association. As a member of the Tenant Right League in the 1850s, he was influenced by the policies of Isaac Butt following the publication of Butt’s Plea for the Celtic Race (1866),Hickey, D.J. & Doherty , J.E., A new Dictionary of Irish History from 1800, pp. 251-252, Gill & MacMillan (2003) so was from an early age in the constitutional movement to achieve Irish home rule. Kettle later became a close supporter of Michael Davitt and was instrumental in persuading Charles Stewart Parnell to support the land agitations of the late 1870s. He presided at the first meeting of the Land League in October 1879, at which Parnell became president and Kettle its honorary secretary. In 1881 Kettle proposed that the answer to the British government’s Coercion policy was that ‘’the whole Irish Party should rise and leave the House of Commons, cross over to Ireland and carry our a ‘no rent campaign’.’’ This policy of confrontation though opposed by Parnell, was adopted in modified form. Kettle was imprisoned for organising resistance to coercion. He was a signatory of the No Rent Manifesto. Following the Kilmainham Treaty he retired from active politics to spend more time working his farms. He adhered to Parnell in his crisis of 1890, giving support to Parnell’s policies. As Parnell's right-hand man, Kettle shared a lot of his opinions, and wrote of his own views: > I confess that I felt [in 1885], and still feel, a greater leaning towards > the British Tory party than I ever could have towards the so-called > Liberals.Laurence J.

He was one of the founders of the Dublin > Tenants’ Defence Association, and in that capacity was one of the deputation > that induced the youth Parnell to challenge the Tory hold on County Dublin, > in the contest against Colonel Taylor, which was Parnell’s baptism of fire > in Irish politics. When Davitt unfurled the banner of the Land League he > joined him in the foundation of the organisation, and was one of the most > prominent members of the Land League Executive. Upon the arrest of Parnell, > Dillon, Davitt, and the other leaders in 1861, he assumed with Mr. Patrick > Egan the control of the organisation; and was one of the signatories of the > No Rent Manifesto. His arrest under the Forster Coercion Act speedily > followed, and he was imprisoned first at Naas and afterwards at Kilmainham. > At the General Election of 1880 he had been put forward by the Land League > as a candidate for County Cork in opposition to Colonel Colthurst. Though > powerful forces were in operation against him, he secured a substantial > vote, which however, failed to carry him to victory. After the lamentable > events of 1890 he adhered to Mr. Parnell, and stood as a candidate for the > representation of County Carlow, upon the death of O’Gorman Mahon. Again he > was defeated in his Parliamentary candidature after a tough fight Strenuous > as he was in battle, there was no more tolerant and generously minded man, > and none welcomed more eagerly the re-union of the Nationalist forces.

In Folklore The Elder Mother is thought to be the guardian of the elder trees, and it was said, until recent times in various parts of England and Scandinavia that to take wood from the elder tree one would have to ask the Elder Mother first, or else ill luck would befall the woodsman. The woodsman would have to ask the Elder Mother like so: > \\"Old girl, give me some of thy wood and I will give thee some of mine when I > grow into a tree.\\" Burne, Charlotte Sophia (2003) Handbook of Folklore, > Kessinger Publishing, One such story of the Elder Mother's revenge concerns a writer earlier in the 20th century. When calling in on the mother of a sick child, the mother told him: > \\"It were all along of my maister’s thick ‘ead. It were in this ‘ow't’ rocker > comed off t'cradle, and he hadn’t no more gumption than to mak’ a new ‘un > out on illerwood (elder wood) without axing the Old Lady’s leave, and in > course she didn’t like that, and she came and pinched the wean that > outrageous he were a’most black in t’ face; but I bashed un off, and putten > an eshen on, and the wean is gallus as owt agin.\\" Another tale, from Somerset, casts the Elder Mother as the villain, a witch that a farmer sees as an elder milking his cow. The farmer shoots at the witch with a silver bullet but misses and is chased back into the farmhouse. The old granny, however, picks up the burning coal from the fire with a shovel and throws it at the elder tree, burning cinders, and thus the witch is dead. A tale from Northamptonshire tells of man who cut a stick from an elder, and saw that the tree was bleeding. Later he meets the local witch and sees that she has a bloodied bandage on her arm. Another tale not only has the elder-tree witch (sometimes later claimed to be various famous characters such as Mother Shipton) as the somewhat dubious heroine, but also with saving England from being conquered by a king and his knights (sometimes said to be Danes). This is also the story of how the Rollright Stones that lie on the border between Oxfordshire and Warwickshire came to be. When the king and his knights marched towards Long Compton they came upon a witch who told the king: > \\"Seven long strides thou shalt take, > And if Long Compton thou shalt see, > King of England thou shalt be.\\" The king however went onwards saying: > \\"Stick, stock, stone > As King of England I shall be known.\\" However, on the King's seventh stride a hill rose up before Long Compton making him unable to see the town. The witch was there again with her chant: > \\"As Long Compton thou canst not see > King of England thou shalt not be. > Rise up stick and stand still stone > For King of England thou shalt be none; > Thou and thy men hoar stones shall be > And I myself an eldern tree.\\" And thus the king and his knights were turned to stone and the witch turned herself into an elder tree. Similar and related beliefs In Denmark, an elder twig put in the mouth was traditionally thought to drive out evil spirits and thus could cure toothache. Also in Denmark, if you were to stand under an elder on Midsummer's Eve you could see the Elf-king and his host. A similar tradition existed in Scotland where it was said to happen on All Hallows or Samhain. In England, it was thought that the elder tree could never be hit by lightning and that carrying the twigs of an elder could protect their bearer from rheumatism. Farmers used to protect their animals from evil by placing a cross made from elder on their cow-sheds and barns. In some Slavic countries, such as Russia, it is thought that the tree had the power to ward off evil. In Sicily, it was claimed to have the power to ward off snakes.

The Zinkensdamm manor was demolished. The name is today used for Zinkensdamm metro station and the sports ground Zinkensdamms IP. History Wealthy customs manager Wilhelm Böös Drakenhielm, who was active in the mid 17th century, placed his wealth in agricultural real estate. He bought a large property in this area in 1668. The area was mountainous and not suitable to be built upon, and Drakenhielm probably bought the land to have some carp ponds, which was considered \\"a must\\" for a wealthy person of that time. After Drakenhielm's finances deteriorated, royal councillor Claes Fleming (1649-1685) took over. Following his death in 1685, in the same year, his widow Anna Cruus sold the property to the merchant Frantz Zinck, who was a large supplier of textiles to the Swedish crown, for a sum of 36,000 Swedish riksdaler (copper). Zinck did however have problems in paying the full amount, and did therefore not hold the title to the property when he died in 1690. Despite this, the area still carries his name.

The degree is often titled Master of Finance or Master in Finance (abbreviated M.Fin., MiF, MFin), or Master of Science in Finance (MSF in North America and MSc in Finance in the UK and Europe). In the U.S. and Canada the program may be positioned as a professional degree. Particularly in Australia, the degree may be offered as a Master of Applied Finance (MAppFin). In some cases, the degree is offered as a Master of Management in Finance (MMF). Structure MSF and M.Fin / MSc programs differ as to intended career preparation and hence degree focus — with the former centered on financial management and investment management, and the latter on more technical rolesMaster's of the Financial Universe, businessweek.com, April 6, 2009. (although, see below for further discussion as to this distinction). Both degree types, though, emphasize quantitative topics, and may also offer some non-quantitative elective coursework, such as corporate governance, business ethics and business strategy. Programs generally require one to two years of study, and are often offered as a non-thesis degree. The MSF program, typically, prepares graduates for careersDetermine If a Master's in Finance Is the Right Move, usnews.com, Feb. 9, 2015. in corporate finance, investment banking and investment management.For example Johns Hopkins - Carey's MS in Finance The core curriculum is thus focused on managerial finance, corporate finance and investment analysis. These topics are usually preceded by more fundamental coursework in economics, (managerial) accounting, and \\"quantitative methods\\" (usually time value of money and business statistics). In many programs, these fundamental topics are a prerequisite for admission or assumed as known, and if part of the curriculum, students with appropriate background may be exempt from these.Delaware-Lerner The program usually concludes with coursework in advanced topics — where several areas are integrated or applied — such as portfolio management, financial modeling, mergers and acquisitions and real options; managerial economics and various quantitative finance topics may also be offered as advanced courses. The M.Fin / MSc prepares graduates for more technical roles, and thus \\"focuses on the theory and practice of finance\\" Cambridge's Master of Finance with a \\"strong emphasis on financial economics in addition to financial engineering and computational methods.\\" The MSF core topics are (often) also covered, although in (substantially) less detail. Elective work includes specific topics in quantitative finance and computational finance, but also in corporate finance, private equity and the like; several of the MSF advanced topics — such as real options and managerial economics — will thus also be offered, here differing as to a more technical orientation. As regards coverage of quantitative finance as compared to more specialized degrees, see below. Topics (or specializations MSF Curriculum, Gies Machine Learning for Finance MSc, University of Limerick) in data science and machine learning are becoming common.Master of Science in Finance, Eccles The MSF-M.Fin distinction is not absolute: some MSF programs, although general in coverage, are \\"quantitatively rigorous\\"Pacific Lutheran University MSF or offer a \\"quantitative track\\"For example: Boston College - Carroll's MSF; Brandeis IBS' MSF; Alabama's MSF (and may be STEM-designated SUNY BuffaloCarlson-Minnesota Master of Science in Finance); while others are specifically technically oriented,For example Clark University and IIT-Stuart or, in some cases, even offer a finance and mathematics dual degree.For example, Tulsa-Collins Also, although the \\"MSc in Finance\\" generally corresponds to the M.Fin, many schoolsFor example Exeter and Essex offer a range of MSc programs where finance may be combined with accountancy and/or management, and these then correspond to the MSF; many MSc programs are further specialized, with the degree as a whole focused on, for example, Behavioral finance, Islamic finance or Wealth management.For example Henley-ICMA and City University London - Cass MMF programs may, similarly, offer either broad- or specialized finance coverage.For example: McGill; Witwatersrand The MAppFin spans the MSF-M.Fin spectrum in terms of available specializations and corresponding coursework; it differs in that it is \\"for and by practitioners\\" Master of Applied Finance: Macquarie University. and therefore \\"blends... finance theory with industry practice\\",Master of Applied Finance: Charles Sturt University. as appropriate to the specialization. Similar to the MSc, programs are sometimes specifically focused on Financial Planning or Banking, for example, as opposed to more general coverage of finance. Some universities offer both the MAppFin and the MFin, with the latter requiring additional semester-time and coursework (and exclusively offering doctoral access). These programs may also differ as to entrance requirements.See for example: Australian National University ; University of Western Sydney ; Curtin University, . Programs require a bachelor's degree for admission, but many do not require that the undergraduate major be in finance, economics, or even general business. The usual requirement is a sufficient level of numeracy, often including exposure to probability / statistics and calculus.Hofstra MS The M.Fin and MSc will often require more advanced topics such as multivariate calculus, linear algebra and differential equations; these may also require a greater background in Finance or Economics than the MSF.See Fordham's MSGF and MSQF Some programs may require work experience (sometimes at the managerial level), particularly if the candidate lacks a relevant undergraduate degree. Comparison with other qualifications :See also Outline of finance#Education. Although there is some overlap with an M.B.A.,Getting an MBA vs. a Master’s in Finance or Economics, mbapodcaster.com the finance Master's provides a broader and deeper exposure to finance, but more limited exposure to general management topics. Thus, the program focuses on finance and financial markets,Masters Degree in Financial Markets, Rhodes University while an M.B.A., by contrast, is more diverse, covering general aspects of business, such as human resource management and operations management. An M.B.A. without a specialization in finance will not have covered many of the topics dealt with in the MSF (breadth), and, often even where there is specialization, those areas that are covered may be in less depth (certainly as regards the M.Fin). M.B.A. candidates will sometimes \\"dual major\\" with an M.B.A./MSF — certain universities also offer this combination as a joint degreeSuffolk-SawyerMBA with Master of Finance Lazaridis — or later pursue an M.Fin degree to gain specialized finance knowledge; some universities offer an advanced certificate in finance appended to the MBA, allowing students to complete coursework beyond the standard finance specialization.See for example Duke-Fuqua, Pittsburgh-Katz, Missouri State. The MSM MSM - Lally, RPICase-Weatherhead or M.Com MComm - UNSW, Coursework Masters in Finance Programmes- University of Cape Town finance (or financial management MCom in Financial Management Sciences - Pretoria) closely correspond to the MSF. These degrees typically place more emphasis on theory and (sometimes) less on practice. As above, some MSF and all M.Fin programs overlap with degrees in financial engineering, computational finance and mathematical finance; see Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF). Note, however, that the treatment of any common topics — usually financial modeling, derivatives and risk management — will differ as to level of detail and approach. The MSF deals with these topics conceptually, as opposed to technically, and the overlap is therefore slight: although practical, these topics are too technical for a generalist finance degree, and the exposure will be limited to the generalist level. The M.Fin / MSc, on the other hand, cover these topics in a substantially mathematical fashion, and the treatment is often identical. The distinction here though, is that these place relatively more emphasis on financial theory than the MQF, and also allow for electives outside of quantitative finance; at the same time, the range of quantitative electives is often smaller. Entrance requirements to the MQF are significantly more mathematical than for the MSF, while for the M.Fin / MSc the requirements may be identical. A Master of Financial Economics focuses on theoretical finance, and on developing models and theory. The overlap with the M.Fin / MSc, then, as with the MQF, is often substantial. As regards the MSF, on the other hand, although the two programs do differ in the weight assigned to theory, there is some overlap: firstly, some MSF curricula do include a formal study of Financial Economics;For example: MSF Curriculum, Villanova University; Curriculum; Vanderbilt, Owen GSM. secondly, even where the theory is not studied formally, MSF programs do cover the assumptions underpinning the models studied (at least in overview); thirdly, many financial economics programs include coverage of individual financial instruments, corporate finance and portfolio management, although this treatment is usually less practical. (As regards managerial economics, similar comments apply. The course is taught to strengthen the theoretical underpin of the degree; however, since the emphasis is application, it is not developed.) The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation is sometimes compared to a Master's in Finance.Recognized by UK NARIC (December 2009) as comparable to QCF Level 7. In fact, several universitiesFor example Saint Xavier UniversitySpecialized Masters - Finance: Fisher College of Business - Ohio State have embedded a significant percentage of the CFA Program \\"Candidate Body of Knowledge\\" into their degree programs;CFA Program Partners Overview, cfainstitute.org and the degree title may reflect this: \\"Master in Financial Analysis\\" or similar.For example USF, Exeter, Rutgers In general though, the CFA program is focused on Portfolio management and Investment analysis, and provides more depth in these areas than the standard Finance Master's, whereas for other areas of finance the CFA coverage is in less depth.The MiF can offer an edge over the CFA Financial Times, June 21, 2015. (Likewise, several programs have curricula aligned with the FRM / PRM,eg: Baruch-Zicklin; Suffolk-Sawyer or the CAIA;Queen's MFin note that the so-called \\"Indian C.F.A.\\" is, in fact, a master's degree.) A further distinction — as regards all such designations — is that (most) Masters programs include practice on, for example, the Bloomberg Terminal, or in building advanced financial models, while \\"hands on\\" training of this sort will not (typically) be included in a professional certification program.

After a successful career in his native UK and Australia, his later career was based in the United States. Early life James Digby Wolfe was born to a father who was an international banker and a mother who was a Vogue magazine artist. His mother named him after a character in Beau Geste. When he was four, his father died after being hit by a golf ball, and he was brought up by his mother in Felixstowe. Film and television career He made his film debut in the 1948 film The Weaker Sex. He began writing and performing in comedy series in England in the 1950s. Together with Jimmy Wilson he wrote a revue, with music by John Pritchett and Norman Dannatt, for the Irving Theatre. He appeared alongside Ronnie Corbett, Hattie Jacques and Charles Hawtrey, in his own television show Wolfe at the Door before moving to Sydney in 1959, where he made frequent television appearances and was host of the variety shows, Revue '61 and Revue '62. At that time, his resident comedian was Dave Allen, who later became a household name in the UK and Australia. Wolfe returned to England for a while in the early 1960s and was a writer on the seminal TV satirical review That Was the Week That Was. He also taught screenwriting at USC in the MPW (Master of Professional Writing) program. Career in the US In 1964, he moved to the United States, where his television credits included The Monkees, Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie, and The Munsters, while his film roles included voice parts in The Jungle Book and Father Goose, in which he sang the main theme. His writing credits included Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (for which he won an 'Emmy' in 1968), and The Goldie Hawn Special. He also wrote for John Denver, Shirley MacLaine, Cher and Jackie Mason, among others. In 1976 he hosted two episodes of the Australian version of This Is Your Life.Wolfe biodata, Internet Movie Database; accessed 26 November 2018. Later life and death Until 2002 Wolfe taught dramatic writing at the University of New Mexico, first as a visiting professor, then as the chair of the Robert Hartung Dramatic Writing Program in the Theatre and Dance Department. He was awarded 'Teacher of the Year' at that university in 2001.Melbourne Observer, 14 November 2007. Wolfe died in Albuquerque, New Mexico, aged 82, on 3 May 2012, after a short battle with cancer, and was survived by his wife, Patricia Mannion, and his sister, Hilary Hammond- Williams.

It is a papyrus manuscript of the Gospel of John, containing verses 1:29-35 & 1:40-46 in a fragmentary condition. The manuscript has been paleographically assigned to the early 3rd century.Philip W. Comfort, Encountering the Manuscripts. An Introduction to New Testament Paleography & Textual Criticism, Nashville, Tennessee: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 2005, p. 75. The manuscript is currently housed at the Sackler Library (Papyrology Rooms, shelf number P. Oxy. 4445) at Oxford. Description The original manuscript would've been around 12.5 cm x 23 cm, with about 35 lines per page.Comfort, P. W., & Barrett, D. P. (2001). The text of the earliest New Testament Greek manuscripts, pp. 644 Due to pagination being extant (gamma/Γ (=3) on the front and delta/Δ (=4) on the reverse of the leaf), this indicates that the manuscript was either a single codex of John, or had John at the beginning of a collection.Philip W. Comfort, Encountering the Manuscripts. An Introduction to New Testament Paleography & Textual Criticism, Nashville, Tennessee: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 2005, p. 33. The text is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type (rather proto- Alexandrian), bearing familiarity to \\\\mathfrak{P}66, \\\\mathfrak{P}75, Codex Sinaiticus (א), and Vaticanus (B).

It has since become one of the most acclaimed grindcore albums of all time. The album, along with its production history, was made the subject of the 2012 book Compiling Autumn: The Making of Discordance Axis' \\"The Inalienable Dreamless\\", a limited edition paperback that was released to aid the Japanese Red Cross Society. The album was repressed on black and blue vinyl for Record Store Day in 2011. Many of the tracks refer to elements from the anime/manga franchise Neon Genesis Evangelion, including \\"Angel Present\\", \\"Pattern Blue\\", \\"The End of Rebirth\\", and \\"The Third Children\\". Background and production After the release of the 1997 album Jouhou, guitarist Rob Marton left the band right before they could start their Japanese tour, citing schedule conflicts with his job as a main reason. To fill in his place, the band hired guitarist Steve Procopio for the tour. The band would then take a two year hiatus before reforming in 1999 to work on new material, Marton now back in the band. The trio was then offered by Hydra Head Records after label head Aaron Turner listened to Jouhou. The Inalienable Dreamless was recorded, mixed, and mastered in four days during late 1999 at Trax East. Originally, Steve Evetts was to engineer the record, however he quit and left the studio before the band could start the sessions, so Jon D'Uva was hired last minute to replace him. During the sessions, D'Uva added a subharmonic bass synthesizer effect to the guitar recordings, giving the recordings a more \\"full\\" sound. The album was released in August 2000 on compact disc and vinyl formats. Artwork, packaging, and lyrics The CD edition of the album was packaged in a keep case, which is normally associated with DVDs. The booklet included with the CD release includes lyrics in unique handwritten fonts displayed over pictures of the oceanside taken by photographer Scott Kinkade. The photos were taken out at Sea Bright, New Jersey, which was where drummer Dave Witte was living during the production of the album. Kinkade was hired to take the photos because he had been friends with the band ever since they met each other at a show in 1996. The LP edition of the album too featured the booklet, and was pressed on black and clear vinyl. The clear edition was a pressing of only 100 copies. All LP editions featured etchings in the run-out grooves that read \\"Are You My Pal...Danny?\\" Lyrical themes of the album include loneliness and despair, a departure from the group's earlier politically motivated works. The lyrics also include references to, and were heavily inspired by, the anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in particular the films Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth and End of Evangelion. Authors Philip K. Dick and Joseph Conrad are referenced as well. Reception and legacy Since its initial release, the album has received critical acclaim from critics, and is considered by many to be one of the best modern grindcore albums ever made. In 2009, Decibel magazine included the album in its \\"Hall of Fame\\" list. William York of AllMusic awarded the album a near perfect score of 4.5 out of 5 and \\"Recommended Pick\\" status, praising the band's musicianship. Greg Patt of Brave Words gave the album a perfect 10/10 score, complimenting the \\"painfully emotional and poetic\\" lyrics and Dave Witte's drumming. Stylus Magazine writer Clay Jarvis rated the album with an A score.

The team is based in Presentation Brothers College Sports Ground, Cork. The team was formed in 2001, playing along with 4 other teams that year. The Admirals became one of the best teams in the IAFL, appearing in the playoffs semifinals numerous times. The teams also held a reputation for a lot of records in the IAFL mostly in points in a game and rushing.  History  The Admirals first game was in December 2002. In a rain soaked game the Admirals lost 28-18 to the Dublin Rebels in an 8-a-side challenge match. Despite the loss the performance held encouraging signs for the team, and increased enthusiasm in the club. The team stepped up to 11-a-side for the next two friendly matches. Unfortunately both games resulted in defeat for the Admirals, going down 26-12 to the Dublin Rebels and 8-0 to the Dublin Dragons. In the 2003 season, the club's first season of IAFL league play, the team managed only a 1-5 record. The first victory came in the spring of 2003, defeating the UL Vikings in an 8-a-side contest. The club would get its first 11-a-side victories against the same side that winter in two challenge games. The following year saw the Cork Admirals improve to a 3-5 record in the expanded IAFL. Despite this the Dublin Dragons, with a similar 3-5 record beat the Admirals to the final playoff spot. The final game of that season was the Admirals best performance, beating the Dublin Dragons 68-20 at Pfizer Sports Grounds. The Admirals held a recruitment drive in the Autumn of 2004, adding starting players and depth alike. Many of the current Admirals players were found in this recruitment drive. A victory against Limerick in a November challenge game introduced the rookies to Admirals football and prepared them for the season ahead. The Admirals season got off to a poor start when the U.L. Vikings recorded their first ever win over the Cork side. This started a four-game losing spell for the Admirals, despite some encouraging performances and close losses, as injuries and low squad numbers took their toll. The Summer brought about improved play from the Admirals and the results followed. The Admirals won three of their final four contests of the season, including two home wins to clinch a playoff spot, and return the Admirals to playoff contender status. The Belfast Bulls, league winners in 2005, proved too strong for the Admirals, however, ending the Admirals hopes for a Shamrock Bowl berth that season. In May 2013, the Admirals encountered players numbers problems and briefly halted playing operations. However, they have now made a return guided by a core nucleus of young players making the IAFL-1 Bowl final but losing out to UCD 40-0. They returned to the IAFL-1 Bowl final in 2015 but unfortunately lost out on a nailbiter to Waterford Wolves 13-12. Finally having won the IAFL-1 with an undefeated season in 2016, they re-entered the Shamrock Bowl Conference for 2017.  Shamrock Bowl XXI  In 2007, the Admirals made their first Shamrock Bowl with a victory over the Dublin Rebels 8-6 in the semifinals. The team faced IAFL South division rivals, the UL Vikings. In a very tight contest, the Admirals were unable to beat the Vikings. The game finished 22-14. Good individual efforts by players gave the Admirals high hopes going into the 2008 IAFL season.  Shamrock Bowl XXXII  In 2018 the Admirals returned to the Shamrock Bowl after an 11-year gap to their last appearance. The (5-3) Admirals took on the (6-2) Dublin Rebels in Tallaght Stadium on 19 August. The game ended in dramatic fashion after a back and forward 4th quarter. Admirals took the lead in the 1st quarter when Stephen Hayes connected with Simon 'Kit' O'Keeffe for an 8-yard score at the back left of the end zone. The XP was missed, however. With just seconds left in the 1st half Hayes picked out Jahn Dasini on the right sideline in the end zone and he was able to drag his toes and haul in the score. The trick play 2PAT was unsuccessful and Admirals went into the break leading 12-0. The 3rd quarter was mostly a defensive stalemate but the game exploded into life in the final quarter. Rebels scored first through Wello Omo and Simon Mackey added the 2PAT at the left pylon to leave it 12-8. With 5 minutes left on the clock, Wello Omo broke off a huge run from well inside his own half to put the Rebels ahead. The 2 PAT was unsuccessful to leave the score at 14-12 to the Rebels. With just over 2 minutes left on the clock, the Rebels were backed up in their own red zone on 3rd and 30. A quick punt was blocked down. The punter regathered and attempted to punt again but Dan Sheedy batted it down and it bounced into the end zone where he was able to pounce on the ball to score. The XP was missed leaving the Admirals ahead 18-14. The Rebel drove again but the Admirals were able to keep them at bay when the ball was picked off by CB Paul Farrell. Starting in their own red zone they were unable to get anything going on offence and elected to punt. Rather than attempt a difficult punt from their own end zone O'Keeffe elected to run out the back of the end zone to give the Rebels a safety and leave the score 18-16. This meant the Admirals could kick uncontested from their own 20. The Rebels went 4 and out after a negative kick return and the Admirals knelt out the game and were crowned Shamrock Bowl XXXII and National Champions.  Hall of Fame  The Admirals created a Hall of Fame in 2016. The first inductee was RB Keith O'Callaghan who is also currently a coach for the team. In 2017 LB Trevor O'Connell was the second inductee to the Hall of Fame.  Alain Pezeron and Keith O'Callaghan runningback duo  Historically the Admirals were known to have had one of the most punishing ground attacks in the IAFL. Pezeron and O'Callaghan have broken numerous records in the league. Alain Pezeron has broken records for most points scored by a single player at 34 points and rushing touchdowns in a single game at 5. Keith O'Callaghan has been named Offensive Player of the Year for the Admirals a record six years in a row. Keith O'Callaghan was inducted into the Admirals Hall of Fame in 2016. He returned to play in 2017 after a 9-year absence and is currently also a coach.

In 2011 Hull City Council decided to demolish the school, and rebuild it with better facilities as part of the Building Schools for the Future programme. This programme saw 17 new schools built in Hull, including Kingswood Academy, at a cost of £123 million. Construction of the new 1,350 pupil capacity school began in April 2011, with a stated construction cost of around £25 million. The school was designed by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, and built by the \\"Esteem Consortium\\" with Morgan Sindall as the main construction contractor. Initially planned to open in September 2012, opening was delayed to January 2013. On completion of the new building the school changed its name to Kingswood Academy. The new school building opened in January 2013. When the Academy opened as an AET Academy free school uniform was distributed in order to improve the image of the academy and its pupils in the local community. In 2009 1,067 pupils were enrolled at the school; in 2012 the number had dropped to 797 students. Dale Jackson replaced Bob Dore as Principal in 2015. As of 2016 the Academy had 588 pupils.

After a six-year hiatus the show was renewed by the TV3 Group. The show aired its ninth season on Virgin Media One (formerly known as \\"TV3\\") from January 2015. History The show premiered on RTÉ One in the 2000s. The show ran for eight seasons on the public service broadcaster after a six-year hiatus the show was recommissioned by the [TV3 Group. The ninth season aired on TV3 Ireland from 2015. Each episode features a different head chef, usually claimed to have some sort of celebrity background. Sometimes politicians would participate, among them Enda Kenny, Ruairi Quinn, Michael Healy-Rae and Alan Shatter. When it aired on RTÉ it proved to be a very successful format often beating even the likes of Neven Maguire and Donal Skehan's cookery shows in the ratings. Format Each episode sees a celebrity head chef taking on the culinary challenge of producing a full three-course meal with two wines. This meal is then served to the restaurant's customers and the resident critics, Tom Doorley and Paolo Tullio, who are joined each week by a guest critic. The head chef arrives on location at 10:00 on the day of filming and immediately begins working with the team. The head chef's first task is to describe their own menu to the kitchen staff. The head chef works with Workovich on starters, McAllister on the main courses and Lennox on desserts. They prepare their meal until 18:30 and diners enter the restaurant at 19:00. The head chef leaves the kitchen at 22:00 to reveal their identity to the dining room. The chef's identity remains a secret to those being served their food until the end of the show when all has been eaten. The critics give the meal a star rating of between one and five, which is then pulled from an envelope after the head chef joins the critics' table. The Restaurant is voiced over by Seán Moncrieff and the restaurant is manned by John Healy, Maitre'D; the kitchen staff, chefs David Workowich, Stephen McAllister and Louise Lennox and food researcher, Stephen Quin, and waiting staff, waitress, Elaine Normile and waiters, Lee Bradshaw and Vivian Reynolds. During its original run on RTÉ The Restaurant moved location to County Westmeath, where filming took place at Wineport Lodge overlooking Lough Ree, in Glassan village. RTÉ also published The Restaurant – The Magazine, which included images and recipes from the series. The seventh series began on 16 November 2008, running on Sundays at 20:30.

The move paid off as the Billikens won the inaugural NCAA Division I championship.A Big Splash For St. Louis Guelker continued to coach St. Louis through the 1966 season, taking the team to a 95–10–5 record and winning five championships (1959, 1960, 1962, 1963, 1965).

Published in 1940 by Collins (UK) and Little, Brown (USA), it was adapted for television in 1993 as part of the Inspector Alleyn Mysteries.. The episode was directed by Michael Winterbottom and starred Patrick Malahide as Roderick Alleyn. The novel's title is a pun on the legal term the bar, and the public house as the plot concerns the murder of a leading KC (King's Counsel, or barrister-at-law) during a game of darts in the bar of a pub in a small South Devon village. The novel is (unusually) dated on its final page 'May 3rd 1939, New Zealand'; so despite its publication after the start of World War Two, the story is clearly set before the war, in Spring 1939. Plot Luke Watchman, a top London barrister and King's Counsel holidays in the fictional village of Ottercombe, South Devon, staying for a second year at the village pub, The Plume of Feathers, with his cousin Sebastian Parish, a West End matinée idol, and their good friend Norman Cubitt, a painter. Ottercombe is a small, self- contained and not too obviously picturesque fishing village, accessible only by a narrow road and foot tunnel, described as \\"an alarming entrance\\" that has saved Ottercombe \\"from becoming another Clovelly or Polperro. Ladies with Ye Olde Shoppe ambitions would hesitate to drive through Coombe Tunnel and very large cars are unable to do so\\". The Feathers is run by Abel Pomeroy and his son Will, who is an enthusiastic Communist, much involved in the recently formed Coombe Left Movement, which has acquired a mysteriously recent arrival Bob Legge (who lives at the pub) as its Treasurer and Secretary. Also staying at the Feathers is Hon. Violet Darragh, a middle-aged, hard-up Anglo-Irish aristocrat and amateur water-colorist. The cast of suspects is completed by Decima Moore, a local farmer's daughter recently graduated from Oxford University, who has an understanding with Will Pomeroy, based on their shared left wing views, and with whom Watchman is eager to rekindle a brief fling from the previous year. The evening after his arrival, Watchman is struck in the finger by a dart while taking part in a darts display and dies suddenly of cyanide poisoning, a particularly toxic rat poison used earlier in the pub's garage, traces of which are found on the dart. Since Bob Legge, who threw the dart, has had no opportunity to infect it, the inquest delivers a verdict of accidental death. Feelings run high at Ottercombe in the aftermath and Alleyn is despatched, with Inspector Fox, to investigate what the local police believe must be a peculiarly baffling case of murder. Alleyn rapidly detects the usual welter of motives, and the case seems to revolve around an old fraud trial, in which Watchman successfully defended Lord Bryonie by suggesting he was the gullible pawn of Montague Thringle, who was convicted and given a severe prison sentence. Before Alleyn can unmask Watchman's killer, in the face of considerable obstruction or outright hostility from the suspects, he only just contrives to save his assistant Inspector Fox from death by drinking cyanide-laced sherry from a bottle set aside for the two policemen. At this point in the Alleyn saga (Spring 1939), we learn that he is 43 to Fox's 50 years old, and that Alleyn is now happily married to the painter Agatha Troy (who is mentioned only briefly). The novel omits altogether Alleyn's former customary 'Watson', the journalist Nigel Bathgate. The 'Watson' role is partly played in the novel by the local Chief Constable, Colonel the Hon. Maxwell Brammington, who is thoroughly eccentric and shares the affected speech of such other Marsh characters as the playwright John Rutherford in Opening Night. Background & Commentary In her autobiography Black Beech And Honeydew, Ngaio Marsh describes Marton Cottage, the home in the hills outside Christchurch (NZ) she shared with her widowed father, as \\"a masculine household... with the emphasis on my father's generation\\", who would gather there of an evening to play darts. According to Marsh biographer Joanne Drayton, by April 1938, Marsh had returned to Christchurch after a long 1937-8 visit to England, where she had spent time with her old friends, the Rhodes family, visiting Devon and Cornwall, including Polperro (on which she drew for her fictional Ottercombe), adding to Death At The Bar her knowledge of the darts games her father Henry Marsh enjoyed, in which Ngaio sometimes took part. While sitting firmly within the traditional Golden Age whodunit formula at which Ngaio Marsh was such an expert - the 'cosy' English setting, the closed circle of suspects, the orthodox class structure, the exotic murder method etc - Death At the Bar has some unusual features as well as some familiar Marsh characteristics. We have the quaint West Country dialect that crops up in some of her books (cf Dead Water), the knowledgeable presentation of professional actors and painters (Marsh having impressive and extensive experience of both, throughout her life) and, unusually for a 1930s whodunit, the development of a theme around Left Wing politics and a local communist group, as well as a (for the period) unorthodox discussion of the rights and wrongs of capital punishment.

His championship career with the Mayo senior team spanned thirteen seasons from 1961 until 1974. Morley is widely regarded as one of Mayo's greatest ever players. Born in Kiltimagh, County Mayo, Morley was educated locally and later attended St. Jarlath's College in Tuam where he first played competitive football. Here he won back-to-back All-Ireland medals in 1960 and 1961. At club level Morley first played at juvenile and underage levels with Kiltimagh before later lining out with a variety of clubs. His greatest success was with the Ballaghaderreen club with whom he won a county senior championship medal in 1972. Morley made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he was selected for the Mayo minor team in 1960. He enjoyed one championship season with the minor team which ended without success. He subsequently joined the Mayo senior team, making his debut during the 1961-62 league. Over the course of the next thirteen seasons, Morley enjoyed much success, winning Connacht medals in 1967 and 1969 and a National League medal in 1970. He played his last game for Mayo in June 1974. After being chosen on the Connacht inter-provincial team for the first time in 1962, Morley was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for almost a decade. During that time he won Railway Cup medals in 1967 and 1969. Morley, who rose to the rank of detective in the Garda Síochána, was murdered on 7 July 1980 by alleged members of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) during a pursuit in the aftermath of a bank robbery near Loughglynn, County Roscommon. Morley's colleague, Henry Byrne, was also killed in the pursuit. The officers' deaths provoked national outrage. Three men were apprehended, convicted and sentenced to death for capital murder. Two of the sentences were later reduced to 40 years imprisonment while the third was overturned.

A dedication to Connor's daughter Summer, her second child with American pop singer Marc Terenzi, it was written by Connor along with frequent collaborators, Rob Tyger and Kay Denar, for her sixth studio album, Sexy as Hell (2008), with production helmed by the latter. Musically, \\"I'll Kiss It Away\\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad with contemporary R&B; influences that combines classic chord progression on an acoustic guitar with a modern- sounding 808 drum beat. The song samples US Billboard Hot 100 top ten hit Tattoo by R&B; singer Jordin Sparks. Released as the album's second single on November 7, 2008 in German-speaking Europe, the song peaked at number twenty- one in Germany, where it became Connor's first single to miss the top twenty since 2001's \\"French Kissing\\".

It was published in Britain by Collins and in the USA by Little, Brown. Although set in a large English country house, immediately after the 2nd World War, it is effectively one of Ngaio Marsh's crime stories with a theatrical setting, given that it concerns Alleyn's wife Agatha Troy accepting a commission to paint a portrait of the great actor Sir Henry Ancred in the role of Macbeth, onstage at the theatre of his ancestral home, Ancreton Manor, to be unveiled at his 70th birthday party, amongst his family, most of whom are actively involved in the London theatre, one way or another. The novel was well received and reviewed. Plot In 1946 England, with World War Two finally ended, the painter Agatha Troy awaits (not without trepidation, after a lengthy wartime separation) the return of her husband Roderick Alleyn, who has been chasing spies in New Zealand (as in the preceding two books in the series, Colour Scheme and Died in the Wool), while 'Troy' (as she is invariably called) has been making maps and 'pictorial surveys for the army'. She reluctantly accepts a commission to paint the celebrated actor Sir Henry Ancred at his ancestral home Ancreton Manor, where she meets his adult children and grandchildren, and witnesses the tensions and dynamics of a family of theatricals, all with temperaments to match. The main cause of trouble is the bitterly resented presence in the household of Sonia Orrincourt, a brassy young actress Sir Henry has made his mistress and then fiancée. A series of practical jokes are generally felt to be the work of Sir Henry's youngest granddaughter, Patricia (known as Panty), a precocious, outspoken, mischievous child currently attending a school evacuated to Ancreton during the war, where an outbreak of ringworm has happened. Soon after the portrait is finished, Sir Henry, who has been in poor health, dies, apparently of natural causes, and his will (which he has recently changed) creates a furore of suspicion and accusation among the Ancred family. Troy returns home and is reunited with her husband. Alleyn is soon assigned to investigate Sir Henry's death, which proves to have been a case of poisoning by thallium (a depilatory used in those days as a preparatory to the treatment of ringworm). Soon, another murder occurs, and Alleyn duly identifies the killer. Background & Commentary Ngaio Marsh, as her biographers Margaret Lewis and Joanne Drayton describe, spent World War Two in her native New Zealand, living with her father at their home outside Christchurch, continuing to write her increasingly popular crime novels, two of which (Colour Scheme and Died In The Wool) are set in New Zealand, and devoting much energy and creativity to directing and touring the Canterbury University Players in memorable productions, revitalising the New Zealand theatre in the process. Final Curtain, written in New Zealand and set in 1946 England, should really be considered as the third of Marsh's 'theatre' novels, despite its setting in the traditional country house of a well-to-do family, because the Ancreds are flamboyant theatricals, revolving around paterfamilias Sir Henry, a grand old classical actor, somewhat in the tradition of Sir Donald Wolfitt. Sir Henry belongs in a line of Marsh's larger-than-life, often egotistical or temperamental theatre stars, including Opening Nights Adam Poole, False Scents Mary Bellamy, Death At The Dolphins Marcus Knight, Photo Finishs Isabella Sommita and Light Thickens ' Sir Dougal Macdougal, who share a regrettable tendency to arouse hostility and in some cases get bumped off. Among her cast of suspects, Marsh includes... her customary nice young couple of juveniles, one of her bitchily camp young designers, one of her many cats - Marsh, like Dorothy L Sayers, was a great cat lover, and featured them prominently in her crime fiction - and the first of her monstrously knowing juveniles, Panty, who bears a passing kinship to Josephine in Agatha Christie's 1949 crime novel Crooked House, a Christie favourite among her own books. Comparison with Christie is interesting as regards Final Curtain 's use of the poisonous element thallium. Marsh was a thorough and careful researcher, but she did not enjoy the advantage of Christie's experience in both World Wars, working in hospital pharmacies. Thallium is rare in real life criminal cases (eg Martha Marek in 1930s Austria or Graham Young in 1970s England). When Christie used it in her ingenious 1962 novel The Pale Horse, she described with great accuracy the symptoms of a slow-acting poison, whereas in Final Curtain, thallium's effects are well described as regards its depilatory and post mortem effects, but not in terms of its symptoms after ingestion... not that it matters to the reader of an ingenious classic Ngaio Marsh whodunit, combining social comedy and murder mystery.  Television Adaptation  Final Curtain was adapted in 1993 for the BBC TV series The Inspector Alleyn Mysteries, starring Patrick Malahide as Roderick Alleyn, Belinda Lang as Agatha Troy and a cast including Elinor Bron and Jonathan Cullen.

Both models are used for the prediction of thermodynamic properties, especially the estimation of phase equilibria. The UNIFAC consortium is a successful example of private sponsorship of a public university in Germany.  History  The consortium was founded in 1997 when the public financing of the further development of the models became unlikely. The models UNIFAC and mod. UNIFAC (Dortmund) have already been used widely in software for the simulation and synthesis of chemical processes. Many companies doing process development in the field of chemical engineering had announced their support for a new way to subsidize the further development. This is facilitated through the support of over 40 companies, and is particularly aided by the DDBST GmbH, which supplies the complete Dortmund Data Bank (DDB) and several software tools for free. The DDB, a factual data bank for thermodynamic data, especially phase equilibrium data, is the main source for the work of the consortium.  Objectives  The normal work of the consortium includes * the creation of new and the improvement of older model parameters * the measurement of experimental data (partly own work, partly given to contractors) * holding annual member meetings The consortium has e. g. added or modified 404 interaction parameters in the original UNIFAC matrix compared to the 635 parameters from the latest publication.Wittig R., Lohmann J., Gmehling J., „Vapor-Liquid Equilibria by UNIFAC Group Contribution. 6.

Every location in the United Kingdom has a designated territorial police force with statutory responsibility for providing policing services and enforcing criminal law, which is set out in the various police areas below. Special police forces and other non territorial constabularies do not have police areas and their respective specialist areas of responsibility are shared with the relevant geographic territorial police force. Ultimately the Chief Officer of a territorial police force has primacy over all law enforcement within his police area even if it is within the remit of a special police force such as the British Transport Police on the railway infrastructure, the Ministry of Defence Police on MOD property or a Port Constabulary on a port. History The Metropolitan Police District was the first example of a police area. Police areas were introduced with the passage of the Police Act 1964 and Police (Scotland) Act 1967, when a number of small (mainly county borough) police forces were merged with county ones. The current system of police areas in England and Wales is set out by Section 1 of the Police Act 1996. There are 43 police areas in England and Wales, most of which are defined by Schedule 1 of the 1996 act. They may be altered by order of the Home Secretary.Section 32, Police Act 1996 The two other areas, the Metropolitan Police District and the City of London police area, are defined by Section 76 of the London Government Act 1963 and the City of London Police Act 1839 respectively. Northern Ireland and Scotland each have only one territorial police force: the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and Police Service of Scotland.

Currently, it competes in the Slovenian First League. The team plays its home matches at the Tabor Hall, a 3,261 capacity multi-purpose sports venue in Maribor. Between 2004 and 2010, the team was known as RK Klima Petek Maribor due to sponsorship reasons. Their biggest success is reaching the final of the Slovenian Handball Cup twice and reaching the quarter-finals of the EHF Cup in the 2012–13 season. History Handball in Maribor Rudar in 1961 The first handball team in Maribor was formed in 1925, when the women's selection of the 1. SSK MB played their first Czech handball match at the Ljudski vrt area. In 1928, the 1. SSK Maribor have won the national league. The first men's handball team, named Polet, was formed in 1949. They were renamed to Branik in 1951, when they participated in the Yugoslav First League qualifiers. In 1954, Branik have won their first Slovenian Republic League title, and were promoted to the Yugoslav First League. The women's team have won the league one year later, in 1955. Between 1955 and 1968, Branik did not achieve any major success and were even relegated to the local Styrian League in 1966, but returned to the top Slovenian division two years later. They were relegated again in 1972, but once again returned in 1979 after spending a few years in the local regional leagues. In 1977, the team was merged with Kovinar Tezno to form Maribor. The team was struggling in the next decade and did not achieve any major results. After the independence of Slovenia, the team was reformed with a help from some former handball players, including Marko Šibila. They reached the 3. DRL (Third National Handball League). Maribor Branik In 2003, a new club called Maribor Branik was founded. In their first season, the team was promoted to the 2. DRL East. In 2005–06, they were promoted to the 1. B DRL, where they stayed until the 2008–09 season. They were the runners-up and were promoted to the elite Slovenian First League of Handball. In the same year, they finished in the third place in the Slovenian Handball Cup. In their first season in the top division, they finished eight and were the runners-up in the Slovenian Handball Cup, where they lost to Celje in the final, which was held at the Tabor Hall. As the runners-up, they gained a place in the 2010–11 EHF Cup Winners' Cup. They reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to the Spanish side San Antonio. In the same season, the team finished in the fifth place in the Slovenian League. They again finished in the fifth position in the 2011–12 season, and were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the 2011–12 EHF Challenge Cup by Maccabi Tel Aviv from Israel. The most successful international season for the club was in 2012–13, when they reached the group stages of the EHF Cup, defeating Dudelange, Kópavogs and Siscia in the qualifications. They were drawn in the group with Danish team Tvis Holstebro, Norwegian Elverum and Polish Wisła Płock. With seven points out of six games, Maribor Branik qualified to the quarter-finals of the competition, where they were eliminated by Göppingen with 57–56 on aggregate. In 2013–14 and 2014–15, the club finished in the third place in the Slovenian League, which is their best result since establishment. The club was about to enter the regional SEHA League alongside Celje and Gorenje in the 2014–15 season, but all three Slovenian clubs rejected entrance due to an unacceptable financial demands. In the 2016–17 season, Maribor Branik reached the final of the Slovenian Cup for the second time in their history, where they lost to Celje 36–28. Arena Maribor Branik play their home matches at a 3,261 capacity Tabor Hall in the Tabor District of Maribor. The reserve venue of the club is Lukna Sports Hall, a 2,100 capacity all-seater indoor hall, also located in Maribor. Supporters and rivalry The club had a supporters group called Maribor Supporters. They started to attend a games in the 2008–09 season, when the club was playing in the Slovenian Second League. However, the supporters group was official established in 2011. In February 2012 there was an incident, when the small number of Maribor Supporters chanted a song about the Srebrenica massacre against the Bosnian team Gradačac in the first leg of the 2011–12 EHF Challenge Cup. The group was banned from attending the Branik's home games. Maribor Branik do not have any major rivals; however, games between Maribor Branik and RK Celje are addressed as the \\"Styrian derby\\", named after the Styria region in Slovenia with Maribor and Celje being the two biggest cities in the region. Colours, kits and crest Originally, the club's colours were white and black, which is the main colour of the Branik Sports Association. However, at the start of the 2011–12 season, RK Maribor Branik changed their main colour to purple due to popularity of NK Maribor, the most successful association football club in the country, which main colour is purple. As of the 2020–21 season, Maribor Branik's home kit is purple, while the away kit is white. The club's first crest was a shield-shape with a black and white abstract silhouette of a handball player. In 2012, they changed the colours of the crest to purple and white.

It runs Guy's Hospital in London Bridge, St Thomas' Hospital in Waterloo, Evelina London Children's Hospital and community services in Lambeth and Southwark. Guy’s and St Thomas’ is one of the largest hospital trusts in the country, with around 18,050 staff; 25,650 foundation trust members; an annual turnover of almost £1.7 billion; and 2.6 million patient contacts a year. Guy's Hospital was first established as an NHS Trust including University Hospital Lewisham but in 1993 Lewisham became independent and Guy's and St Thomas' joined together. In December 2013 it was announced that a proposed merger with King's College Hospital and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust foundation trusts had been suspended because of doubts about the reaction of the Competition Commission. In 2019 it was closely involved with Kings, with which it shares its chair, Sir Hugh Taylor, its strategy director and IT director. In 2014 the Trust established ETL (Essentia Trading Limited), a unique multidisciplinary consultancy that enables public and private sector organisations to transform their environments and create a meaningful legacy. ETL re-invest profits within the Trust. ETL provides infrastructure advisory services in healthcare, higher education, science and research sectors across capital development, cost management, project and programme management, property consultancy, health strategy and planning and sustainability. Facilities The trust has one of the eleven Genomics Medicines Centres associated with Genomics England which opened across England in February 2014. The trust is a partner in Viapath a London-based provider of pathology services jointly owned with Serco, and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. It is one of the biggest provider of specialised services in England, which generated an income of £383.7 million in 2014/5. In October 2018 it had to impose geographical limits on specialist paediatric referrals for dermatology and urology after a large increase in referrals from North London, Kent and Sussex made the waiting times unmanageable. It made a contract with Johnson & Johnson in 2017 to open eight new operating theatres by 2020. The first one opened in April 2019. Private patients The Trust offers a range of services privately including assisted conception, services for children and maternity. Other complex care specialties including cardiology, vascular and thoracic surgery, gynaecology, general surgery and medicine are available at the Westminster Unit. Guy's and St Thomas' Private Healthcare also specialise in adult and children’s renal transplantation and operate one of the largest programmes in Europe. The Trust built a £100 million integrated cancer centre in conjunction with HCA Healthcare near London Bridge in 2016.

It was accepted that through the more rapid population growth in the North Island, the number of its electorates would continue to increase, and to keep proportionality, three new electorates were allowed for in the 1967 electoral redistribution for the next election. In the North Island, five electorates were newly created and one electorate was reconstituted while three electorates were abolished. In the South Island, three electorates were newly created (including South Canterbury) and one electorate was reconstituted while three electorates were abolished. The overall effect of the required changes was highly disruptive to existing electorates, with all but three electorates having their boundaries altered. These changes came into effect with the . In the 1967 electoral redistribution, the electorate move significantly north, and most of that electorates area came to the South Canterbury electorate. In the south, some area was gained from the electorate. Rural land that was previously with the electorate was also absorbed. The electorate was rural and settlements included Mount Somers, Mount Cook Village, Albury, Burkes Pass, Fairlie, Kimbell, Lake Tekapo, Twizel, Geraldine, Pleasant Point, Kurow, and Waimate. In the 1972 electoral redistribution, the southern boundary shifted slightly north, and Kurow and Waimate transferred to the electorate.

Paff (born May 16, 1946 in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania) is one of the founders and current National Organizer of Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a rank-and-file union democracy movement organizing to reform the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), or Teamsters. Early years Ken Paff was born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, a small Rust Belt town near Pittsburgh. He was the son of a union steelworker and a homemaker, the youngest of seven children. In 1956, when Paff was ten, his parents divorced, and he moved to Santa Ana, California with his mother, where he attended high school.La Botz, Dan. Rank and File Rebellion: Teamsters for a Democratic Union. London and New York: Verso Press, 1990, , p. 177.Terkel, Studs. Hope Dies Last: Keeping the Faith in Difficult Times. New York and London: The New Press, 2003, , p. 109. Joining the movement In 1964 he gained admission to the University of California, Berkeley, where he went to study physics. There he became involved in the Free Speech Movement and the civil rights movement. After receiving his bachelor's degree, Paff began a Ph.D. program in physics at UC Berkeley, but quickly abandoned his studies to focus on movement activism. His first exposure to labor movement activism was in 1970 as a supporter of Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers union, when he leafleted supermarkets in support of striking farmworkers in the Salinas Valley.Terkel, op. cit., pp. 109–10. During this time he worked briefly as a computer programmer, then a teacher, but did not feel that either profession suited him.La Botz, op. cit., p. 177. Building Teamster reform Paff eventually found work as a truck driver in California, and soon moved to Cleveland, where he took a job with Shippers Dispatch, which was bought out by Preston Trucking. As a driver for Preston he became a member of Teamsters Local 407, the major freight local in the Cleveland area.Fitch, Bob. Revolution in the Teamsters, pp. 19–24, 71–74 in Tikkun, vol. 8 no. 2 (March 1993), pp. 22–24.La Botz, op. cit., p. 177.Crowe, Kenneth. Collision: How the Rank and File Took Back the Teamsters. New York: Charles Scribner Sons, 1993, , p. 61. At Shippers and Preston, Paff connected with rank and file workers across the Midwest who had been active in previous Teamster efforts such as Teamsters United Rank and File (TURF), and he got involved with starting a new Teamster reform organization. It was initially called Teamsters for a Decent Contract (TDC), since it was organized around mobilizing for the 1976 National Master Freight Agreement negotiations. At their founding convention at Kent State University outside of Cleveland in September 1976, TDC formally changed their name to Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU).La Botz, op. cit., p. 177.Crowe, op. cit., pp. 46–51, 60–61 Being based in Cleveland, Paff and TDU drew the attention of Cleveland Teamster boss Jackie Presser, who would be elevated to Teamster General President in the 1980s. Indeed, Presser organized a contingent of retirees to picket the founding TDU Convention,Crowe, op.cit., p. 60. and opposed TDU members who showed up at union meetings. He also enlisted the help of associates of Lyndon LaRouche to oppose the TDU. The LaRouche followers, along with a mix of Teamster officials and others, eventually created the Brotherhood of Loyal Americans and Strong Teamsters (BLAST) in opposition to the TDU.Terkel, op. cit., pp. 110–11.King, Dennis. Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism. New York: Doubleday, 1989, Chapter 37. http://lyndonlarouche.org/fascism37.htm From rank-and-filer to TDU national organizer Paff and the reformers continued to build their organization. As members saw how TDU was consistently standing up to the Teamster officialdom, TDU began to grow. By 1978, the movement was too big to run on a purely volunteer basis, and the TDU Steering Committee voted to hire Paff as its full-time National Organizer. Paff decided to leave his job at Preston, take a very large pay cut, and take the position, which he holds to this day. At that point, TDU also moved its headquarters from Cleveland to Detroit, which brought Paff to the Motor City.Terkel, op. cit., pp. 110–11.La Botz, op. cit., pp. 177–78. As TDU's National Organizer, Paff has been a central force behind TDU's many accomplishments in the years since its founding, including defeating concessionary agreements such as the notorious freight \\"relief rider\\" that Presser attempted to foist on the membership in 1983, overturning the so-called \\"two-thirds\\" rule, which allowed contracts to be ratified with as little as one-third of the membership voting to approve, protecting Teamster members' pensions, and helping countless numbers of rank and file Teamsters learn their rights, run campaigns to reform their local union bylaws, run for shop steward, and win office to reform their locals. One of Paff's best-known accomplishments is his work helping Teamster members win the right to vote for their top leadership. As detailed most clearly by author Kenneth Crowe, it was TDU's intervention with the Justice Department (assisted by attorneys Thomas Geoghegan and Paul Alan Levy of Public Citizen) that led the government to reject their initial plan to impose a government trusteeship of the IBT and opt instead for a system of government-supervised elections.Crowe, op. cit., especially pp. 65–128Paff, Ken, \\"Let Members Rebuild Teamsters,\\" Cleveland Plain Dealer, June 18, 1987.Paff, Ken, \\"Let the Teamsters Vote,\\" Washington Post, June 21, 1987, p. B5. Once Teamster members won the right to vote for top officers, the Teamster reform movement then faced the problem of fielding a candidate to run for office. After extensive internal debate, TDU decided to endorse Ron Carey, head of New York Local 804, for Teamster General President at their 1989 convention. In the ensuing two years, Paff was the acknowledged \\"field general\\" of the grassroots operation that led dark horse reform candidate Carey to be elected to the top office in the IBT.Crowe, op cit.Dobbs, Frank. \\"Can Carey Reform the Teamsters?,\\" The Nation, February 15, 1993, pp. 192–95. With Carey in office, TDU faced the new problem of how to redefine their relationship to a changed International Union. Although some thought that TDU's job was done now that Carey had been elected, Paff understood the continued necessity of an independent rank and file organization. \\"We need to be an independent movement that unites the best in the Teamsters, from top to bottom,\\" he said. \\"The 1991 election opened up some important doors, but only the membership can complete the job we started.\\"Dobbs, op. cit., p. 195.Livingston, Sandra, \\"Reformers for Teamsters Face a Complicated Task,\\" Cleveland Plain Dealer, November 17, 1992, p. 8F. That necessity became abundantly clear as Teamster old guard officials, although no longer in power at the International level, continued to use their power at the local and Joint Council level to stonewall Carey's reform efforts, sparking a virtual civil war within the union. In response, TDU helped Teamster members organize to pressure their recalcitrant local leaders to get on board with Carey's mobilizing strategies, particularly surrounding national contract negotiations in carhaul, freight, and at UPS. Although difficult at first, that so-called \\"pincer\\" strategy—with a mobilized rank and file uniting with a reform leadership at the top to pressure the mid-level leadership—paid off, as evidenced by the landmark 1997 strike against UPS.Dobbs, op. cit., p. 193.Kosterlitz, Julie, \\"Collision Course.\\" National Journal, July 6, 1996.Larkin, Jim. \\"Teamsters: The Next Chapter,\\" The Nation, January 4, 1999, p. 18. Soon after the UPS victory, however, TDU faced yet another, far more serious challenge, as Carey was removed from office when his campaign manager was caught laundering union money. In the subsequent 1998 rerun election he was replaced by old guard favorite James P. Hoffa. While some forecast TDU's demise, Paff worked with the rank and file TDU leadership to keep the reform movement on track. By keeping the movement focused on core substantive issues of union reform, such as contract campaign, member mobilization, and local union elections, Paff played an important role in guiding TDU through that difficult period.Livingston, Sandra, \\"Teamster Reformers Ready to Move Forward,\\" Cleveland Plain Dealer, November 22, 1997, p. 1CLarkin, Jim, \\"Teamster Tragedy: Carey is Dead, Long Live the Reformers,\\" The Progressive, Vol. 62, No. 1Slaughter, Jane, \\"Teamster Reform Movement Survives Carey's Debacle,\\" Monthly Review, Vol. 49, No. 11.  Organizing in Opposition  While TDU survived Carey's removal from office and the return of old-guard Teamster leadership under James P. Hoffa, it was a challenging period for the Teamster reform movement. Under Paff's leadership, TDU focused its efforts on local issues and national contract enforcement. It continued to play a key role in International Union politics, backing Oregon Local 206 head Tom Leedham's challenge to Hoffa's leadership in the 2001and 2006 international elections, then New York Local 805 head Sandy Pope's campaign in 2011. While these were hard-fought campaigns, each came up short, garnering roughly one-third of the overall vote every time save for 2011, where Hoffa won with 59 percent of the vote in a three-way race. Despite Hoffa's large electoral victory margins, this did not signal broad approval of his leadership. In particular, Teamsters covered by national contracts, such as freight, UPS, and carhaul workers, expressed growing frustration with the International. After years of eroding wages and working conditions, Teamster members started organizing to pressure their leadership to resist further givebacks. Paff and TDU played a coordinating role, helping to organize \\"vote no\\" campaigns in core Teamster industries. These began to bear fruit in the mid-2010s. At UPS, the largest Teamster employer, members narrowly ratified the 2014 national agreement by a 47-53 margin, but rejected 18 key local and regional supplements, preventing the contract from being ratified. After members rejected several attempts at renegotiating the supplements in three areas, the IBT leadership declared the contract ratified. At YRC Freight, the largest freight employer, members initially rejected a concessions-laden contract extension in January 2014 by nearly two-to-one, forcing the negotiating team back to the bargaining table. While the revised deal that members approved eliminated certain concessions, it retained a 15 percent wage cut and a reduction in pension contributions. In October 2015, carhaul members rejected the proposed master agreement by a 7-to-1 margin, then again by a slimmer margin in September 2016, only approving a revised deal in March 2017. Meanwhile, there was growing concern over the solvency of Teamster pension funds, particularly the giant Central States Pension Fund. While the 2008 financial crisis was partly to blame, a bigger problem was that Teamster leaders had let key contributing employers walk away from their pension obligations, leaving the funds in dire shape. Adding to the crisis were the Wall Street financial firms that lost billions of dollars for Teamster funds while collecting large management fees. Faced with drastic cuts to promised benefits, Teamster members and retirees organized a pension protection committees with help from TDU. These committees built community alliances and pressured politicians for legislative solutions to the pension crisis. They successfully blocked Central States administrators' proposal to cut benefits in 2015, and built support for the Butch Lewis Act, named for a TDU leader and pension activist who died in 2015. The bill would offer low-interest loans to struggling funds in order to shore up their solvency. Concerns about eroding wages, contract standards, and pension security fed into the 2016 election campaign, which pitted Hoffa against reform candidate Fred Zuckerman, head of Louisville, Kentucky Local 89. With Paff and TDU once again playing a key role in providing organizing infrastructure, Zuckerman's Teamsters United slate gained broad support among key layers of the Teamster membership, particularly those covered by national contracts. The slate almost defeated Hoffa, winning the popular vote among U.S. Teamsters and regional vice-president slots in the Central and Southern regions. Only when Canadian locals were included, where Teamsters United did not have the resources to campaign, did Hoffa prevail by a margin of roughly 6,000 votes out of 200,000 votes cast overall. Despite narrowly avoiding defeat, Hoffa and his administration did not change course in the aftermath. They proceeded to negotiate a concessionary contract with UPS once again in 2018. Unlike the 2014 negotiations, the master agreement was rejected outright, with 55 percent voting no. Members also rejected several local and regional supplements, as well as the UPS Freight agreement. However, rather than returning to the bargaining table, the Teamster leadership declared the contract ratified. They used a provision in the Teamster constitution that gives the General President the power to ratify a contract when less than two-thirds vote to reject if less than 50 percent of affected members vote overall. With member dissatisfaction growing, Paff and TDU are already gearing up for the 2021 election. Now into his fifth decade as National Organizer of TDU, Paff continues to help rank and file Teamsters defend their rights, speak out for greater democracy, and prod reluctant union leaders to protect wages, benefits, and working standards. Organizing philosophy Those who have studied TDU's origins and its ability to persist over time have credited Paff's organizing strategy for much of its success. Kenneth Crowe notes that, while Paff could certainly be \\"stern\\" and even \\"caustic,\\" he \\"provided the kind of egoless, highly organized, and determined leadership that the organization needed.\\"Crowe, op. cit., p. 50. \\"The key for us in TDU,\\" as Paff explained it, \\"is faith in the members. You're going to have hope that ordinary people can do extraordinary things, because if they can't, there ain't gonna be no hope for the change we're interested in. We started out to change the union, and we ended up changing ourselves.\\" Terkel, op. cit., p. 112. In keeping with his emphasis on faith in the members, Paff has developed and instilled an organizing culture within TDU that emphasizes local member initiative, and establishes a close connection between the staff, the elected leadership (known as the International Steering Committee, or ISC), and the membership.La Botz, op. cit., p. 178. He also argued forcefully from TDU's inception that the movement should operate openly, not clandestinely. \\"The employers are going to find out about you,\\" he said. \\"The people that aren't going to find out about you are the rank and file. We're going to put ourselves out there. We're going to take that chance. If they come after us, they're going to have to do it publicly.\\"Terkel, op cit., p. 112. Many analysts have credited TDU's model of mobilizing tactics and its long tradition of rank and file organizing as being key factors behind the successful 1997 strike at UPS.Witt, Matt and Rand Wilson, \\"The Teamsters' UPS Strike of 1997: Building a New Labor Movement.\\" Labor Studies Journal, Vol. 24 No. 1, 58–72 (1999) Schiavone, Michael, \\"Rank-and-File Militancy and Power: Revisiting the Teamster Struggle with the United Parcel Service Ten Years Later.\\" Working USA: The Journal of Labor and Society, Vol. 10 No. 2, pp. 175–191. Awards and recognition In 1988 Paff received the Nat Weinberg Award, given to \\"men and women who ... stubbornly refus[e] to accept defeat and...assert the right of working people to address and solve the problems that confront them.\\" Nat Weinberg Award Selection Committee notification letter to Ken Paff, August 15, 1988 In 1996 he was named a Petra Fellow by the Petra Foundation, awarded to \\"unsung individuals making distinctive contributions to the rights, autonomy and dignity of others.\\"Petra Foundation website, http://www.petrafoundation.org/about.html , accessed October 17, 2008.

Veloce introduced the Venom Thruxton production model in 1965 with an advertised 41 horsepower at the crankshaft. Period tests clocked it at without race tuning. The well-proven Venom was improved by Velocette designer (and owning-family member) Bertie Goodman with rearward placed footrests having brake pedal and remote gear-change linkage to suit, close-ratio four speed gearbox, alloy rims, twin-leading shoe front brake and 'clip-on' handle bars. The engine gained a race specification cylinder head to accommodate extra-large valves, a downdraught inlet port and an Amal 5GP2 13/8 bore carburettor with extended inlet tract which was so long it required a special cut out in the rear of the fuel tank. The upgraded engine delivered , 5 bhp more than the Venom.

Synopsis The British Home Secretary, Sir Derek O'Callaghan MP, has received several death threats from anarchists affiliated with Stalinist Communism - and a pleading letter threatening suicide from Jane Harden, a nurse with whom he had a short affair some months earlier. O'Callaghan's old friend and family physician, Sir John Phillips, visits to ask about O'Callaghan's relationship with Jane. She is Phillips's scrub nurse and Phillips has loved her from afar for years. O'Callaghan brutally informs Phillips that Jane is \\"easy\\" and not worth his regard; he and Phillips almost come to blows before Phillips threatens his life in front of a servant. One week later, O'Callaghan is introducing a bill in the House of Commons to deal with anarchism when he doubles over, incapacitated by acute appendicitis. His wife, unaware of the fight or of Phillips's threats, has her husband moved to Phillips's private hospital (\\"nursing home\\" in contemporary usage) and begs Phillips to operate immediately. He does so against his own wishes, as assisted by Dr. Roberts, the anaesthetist; Dr. Thoms, the assistant surgeon; Sister Marigold, the matron; Nurse Banks, the circulating nurse; and Jane Harden, the scrub nurse. The operation goes well, but O'Callaghan weakens near the end of the operation and dies one hour later, apparently of peritonitis. The next day, Lady O'Callaghan is going through her late husband's papers and finds both the death threats from anarchists and Jane Harden's letter. Convinced that her husband has been murdered, she calls in Roderick Alleyn of Scotland Yard. It turns out that O'Callaghan has died of an overdose of hyoscine, a drug used in anaesthesia. Suspicion falls not just on Phillips and Harden but also on Nurse Banks, an outspoken Communist whose constant vicious insults toward O'Callaghan during and after the operation have led to her dismissal. Alleyn's digging reveals that it would have been possible for any member of the surgical team to have committed the crime. He learns that Harden loved O'Callaghan to the point that even after his death she was unable to return Phillips's feelings; that Banks is a member of an anarchist society almost completely controlled by the authorities (and which has more bark than bite, as Alleyn finds out when he attends a meeting in disguise with his amanuensis, Nigel Bathgate); that O'Callaghan's sister, an unbalanced, shrill, unintelligent hysteric, has been bullying her brother into taking quack medicine produced by an avowed Communist; and that Dr. Roberts the anaesthetist is a firm believer in eugenics to the point that he is unable to prevent himself from expounding on the topic for hours. Frustrated, Alleyn finally arranges for a re-enactment of the operation; he is suspecting Roberts to be the killer but has no real evidence for this. During the re-enactment Sister Marigold brushes by Roberts's bulky anaesthetics cart during a weak moment and Dr. Thoms erupts in anger and nervousness, screaming that she could have blown up the entire room had the cart (which carries ether) fallen over. The incident makes Alleyn notice how keen Roberts is not to let anyone get too close to the cart. After the re-enactment has ended, the cops see to it that Roberts (who tries to stay on the spot) is lured away from the room on a pretext, Alleyn quickly checks the cart and finds that one of the \\"bolts\\" holding the cart together is actually the top of a syringe. Hours later, he and Fox visit Roberts at his home and charge him with murder. Roberts admits to having injected O'Callaghan with hyoscine, but claims that he was justified: O'Callaghan's family had a \\"hereditary taint\\" (as shown by his sister), and it was his duty to remove such \\"tainted\\" persons from society. At the end, Alleyn points out that Roberts himself is insane and may have committed several similar murders, as suggested by the notches on his stethoscope. In the epilogue Alleyn expresses doubt that Phillips and Harden will ever get together, and remarks that such things only happen in the \\"movie-mind\\".

It existed from 1908 to 1946, and from 1954 to 1978. It was represented by six Members of Parliament. Population centres In the 1907 electoral redistribution, a major change that had to be allowed for was a reduction of the tolerance to ±750 to those electorates where the country quota applied. The North Island had once again a higher population growth than the South Island, and three seats were transferred from south to north. In the resulting boundary distribution, every existing electorate was affected, and three electorates were established for the first time, including the Stratford electorate. These changes took effect with the . The electorate was mixed urban and rural, with the town of Stratford located near the electorate's southern boundary. In the 1908 election, the rural / urban split for the country quote was a ratio of 4 to 1, and it more or less held this ratio until the country quota was abolished. In the 1918 electoral redistribution, the town of Inglewood was gained from the adjacent electorate. In the 1927 electoral redistribution, the electorate was not landlocked any longer for the first time, but gained the North Taranaki Bight coastline from just east of Waitara to the Mokau River, and the settlement of Mokau was thus gained. The Electoral Amendment Act 1945 abolished the country quote, and this was implemented through the 1946 electoral redistribution, which saw a reduction in the number of rural electorates, and an increase in their size. Many electorates were abolished, including Stratford, and its area was subsumed in the enlarged electorate. The First Labour Government was defeated in the and the incoming National Government changed the Electoral Act, with the electoral quota once again based on total population as opposed to qualified electors, and the tolerance was increased to 7.5% of the electoral quota. There was no adjustments in the number of electorates between the South and North Islands, but the law changes resulted in boundary adjustments to almost every electorate through the 1952 electoral redistribution; only five electorates were unaltered. Five electorates were reconstituted (including Stratford) and one was newly created, and a corresponding six electorates were abolished; all of these in the North Island. These changes took effect with the . History The electorate existed from 1908 to 1946, and from 1954 to 1978.

He is a left footed winger that can play either on the left or right wing. Club career Early years Koutsianikoulis began his football career at his local amateur club Iraklis Chalkis, at the time playing in the Delta Ethniki, the fourth tier of the Greek football league system. His performances drew the attention of Greece U-19 coach Nikos Nioplias, who arranged for his first international call-up as well as sending him on a trial period at his former club OFI in April 2007. Koutsianikoulis played a single pre-season friendly game with OFI against local rival Ergotelis. As OFI coach at the time Reiner Maurer had second thoughts on signing Koutsianikoulis on his outfit, Ergotelis, who were impressed with his performance during that friendly approached the player and signed him instead. Ergotelis Koutsianikoulis debuted for Ergotelis during the 2007–08 Superleague season, where he played in a total of 12 matches, 10 of which he came in as a substitute. In total, Koutsianikoulis played 126 minutes, and did not score any goals. His breakout season came the next year, when he became a regular starter. Due to his short stature and agility, Koutsianikoulis demonstrated an impressive ability to evade opposing tackles and beat the defensive line on attacking runs, while his finishing and precise passing to create scoring opportunities for his teammates led the Greek media to dub him \\"the Greek Messi\\" or \\"Messi for the poor\\", often drawing comparisons between his and the Argentinian super-star's playing style, though Koutsianikoulis himself requested these nicknames and comparisons to be dropped. He impressed with his performance in an uncommon 3−0 club home win against Aris in September 2008, where he assisted his club's second goal and posed a continuous threat to the opposing defense. He followed up this performance with 2 goals and one assist in his club's 2−3 away win vs. Panathinaikos, considered at the time one of the biggest upsets in the \\"Greens\\"' history. After scoring one more goal, and consistently performing well vs. reigning champions Olympiacos, Koutsianikoulis was called-up for the Greek National Team by coach Otto Rehhagel, an uncommon call-up for a player not playing in one of the traditional giants of Greek football, and a first for an Ergotelis player. Despite eventually not making any international caps, Koutsianikoulis' league performances with Ergotelis (he finished the season with 4 goals and 6 assists in 27 games) and rising popularity among Greek fans and press made him a target for all major clubs in Greece. PAOK During the summer transfer window of 2009, Ergotelis reportedly received, and declined transfer offers from Olympiacos and Panathinaikos, eventually reaching an agreement with PAOK on May 22, 2009. Koutsianikoulis became the most expensive transfer in Ergotelis history, earning his club a transfer fee of a reported €1,2M, as well as a friendly match between the two teams of which all ticket sales' income would be paid to Ergotelis. He signed a 4-year contract with PAOK on May 25, 2009. Despite high hopes placed on Koutsianikoulis' development, and a dream debut in the 2009–10 Superleague opening match vs. Levadiakos, where he scored one goal and delivered two assists in an easy 3−0 home win for his club, his eventual performances did not manage to impress PAOK coach Fernando Santos, who benched him for the majority of games in the 2009–10 season, while fans were frustrated and left to expect more from the \\"Greek Messi\\". His second year with the club was even more unremarkable, as he played in only 11 matches across all competitions. As PAOK sought to rid themselves of Koutsianikoulis' contract, Ergotelis' officials, who were still owed money from Koutsianikoulis' transfer fee and believed in his talent, reached out to PAOK and arranged for his return to Crete. Return to Ergotelis In July 2007, Ergotelis announced the return of Koutsianikoulis in a transfer deal involving a 50% co-ownership of the player's rights with PAOK for an undisclosed fee clearing PAOK's debts to Ergotelis, while the player's annual contract was estimated at €400K. Koutsianikoulis signed a 4-year contract with his former club and managed to re-establish himself while in Crete, playing in 27 matches and scoring one goal. Ergotelis failed to avoid relegation At the end of the 2011−12 season however, and as the board of directors decided to release many of the club's players with wealthy contracts, the club pre- maturely terminated Koutsianikoulis' contract on mutual consent, all while the player was rumored to be close to a free transfer move to AEK and continue his career in the Superleague. OFI Reports had linked Koutsianikoulis with both AEK and OFI in the weeks after his release from Ergotelis and it seemed the Athenian club had convinced the Greek youth international to join, despite their well-documented financial troubles. AEK were keen to sign Koutsianikoulis, and confirmed negotiations between club president Thomas Mavros and the player's manager in an attempt to strengthen AEK's squad, which had been decimated by the departure of a raft of key players during the summer. Eventually however, Koutsianikoulis chose to move to his former club's local rival OFI, who had secured the required license from the tax office to partake in the 2012−13 Superelague season.Koutsianikoulis snubs AEK, joins OFI On August 20, 2012 Koutsianikoulis finally signed a 3-year contract with OFI. He made his debut with the club in August 2012, during a 0-0 home draw against Skoda Xanthi, and scored his first goal on 29 October 2012 during a 2-2 home draw against Panetolikos. He spent the next three seasons at OFI, making 89 appearances in both the Greek Superelague and the Greek Cup, scoring 8 goals. In 21 March 2015, OFI withdrew from professional competitions, as the administration failed to meet the club's pressing financial obligations and criticized the top-flight circuit for “unfair and uneven decisions” against the club.Αποχώρησε ο ΟΦΗ (Greek), www.sport-fm.gr In a symbolic gesture, Koutsianikoulis, along with the other 14 players who still comprised the club's roster at the time walked on the pitch of the Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium on that day (before match-day 29) and waived OFI's fans farewell. As a result of OFI's departure, Koutsianikoulis was released from his contract with the club. In June 2015, Koutsianikoulis was reported to join Greek Superelague side Veria, under the advise of the club's Technical Director Zisis Vryzas, with whom Koutsianikoulis had collaborated during his time at PAOK.Θέλει Κουτσιανικούλη ο Βρύζας Retrieved 27 June 2015 The deal was however never realized. AEL After brief flirts with Veria and Trikala, Koutsianikoulis eventually signed a 3-year contract with Football League side AEL on September 3, 2015, marking his return to his hometown Larissa.Στην ΑΕΛ ο Κουτσιανικούλης Retrieved 3 September 2015 He made 23 appearances for AEL and scored one goal during the 2015−16 Football League season, helping his club win the division title and achieve instant promotion to the Superleague. After returning to the Superleague with AEL, Koutsianikoulis' playing time significantly dropped. He made only 7 league appearances during the 2016−17 season, and just one appearance in next year's edition of the competition. As a result, Koutsianikoulis' contract was terminated by the club on mutual consent in September 2017.Έφυγε από την ΑΕΛ ο Κουτσιανικούλης 1 September 2017 Return to OFI On 11 September 2017, Koutsianikoulis returned to OFI, at the time playing in the Football League, signing a one-year contract with the club for an undisclosed fee.Στον ΟΦΗ ο Κουτσιανικούλης Retrieved 11 September 2017 On 30 October 2017 he scored his first goal since his return during a 2−1 away win against Panserraikos.\\"Διπλό\\" του ΟΦΗ στις Σέρρες, επιστροφή με νίκη η Παναχαϊκή Retrieved 30 October 2017 Again faced with the club's recurring financial troubles, Koutsianikoulis raised his game after the departure of several key players in OFI's attempt to return to the Superleague, scoring crucial goals in a 0−2 away win against Panegialios on 13 January 2018, and a 3−0 home win against fellow promotion contenders Doxa Drama on 17 January 2018. On 31 March 2018, he scored with a wonderful strike, curling the ball into the net from distance with the help of a slight deflection, as his club made another huge step towards promotion to the Superleague, defeating 3-0 nearest challengers Panachaiki. At the end of the 2017-18 season, he celebrated the promotion to Superleague. On 28 May 2019, the team announced that his contract would not be renewed. Olympiacos Volos On 11 September 2019, Koutsianikoulis joined Olympiacos Volos as a free transfer for an undisclosed fee. International career Koutsianikoulis' skills during his time with Iraklis Chalki, drew the attention of Greek U−19 coach Nikos Nioplias, who enlisted him in the squad that featured in the 2007 UEFA European U−19 Championship, in which Greece reached the Final. Koutsianikoulis played for one half against Spain during the competition Group stage, and then again in the competition Final, once more against Spain, where the Greeks narrowly lost the title (1–0). Aged 20 and already an international with Greece U−21, Koutsianikoulis shot to prominence in 2008, during a string of impressive matches with Ergotelis against Aris, Panathinaikos and Olympiacos. His performances were eventually rewarded by Greece head coach Otto Rehhagel, who named Koutsianikoulis in his 20-man squad for an international friendly against Italy on 19 May 2008 at Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus.Greece coach Otto Rehhagel sprang a surprise by naming Ergotelis forward Vassilis Koutsianikoulis in his squad for Thursday's (AEDT) friendly against Italy. Despite being considered a strong prospect for the national team, Koutsianikoulis was ultimately not fielded during the match, and the eventual decline of his career after his transfer move to PAOK severely hurt his chances for receiving another call-up.

He was known as the \\"voice from London\\" during World War II, when listening to foreign radio in Norway was illegal, and from October 1942 implied risk of death penalty. Personal life  Øksnevad was born in Høyland, a son of teacher Arnt Øksnevad and Kirsten Torine Folkvord, and was a brother of librarian Reidar Øksnevad. His daughter married journalist and film director Arne Skouen, and he was a grandfather of composer Synne Skouen. He died in Oslo in 1975. Journalist career  Øksnevad was a journalist for Dagbladet from 1912 to 1920, was press attaché in Paris 1920-1924, and again journalist for Dagbladet 1924-1927. He was editor-in-chief for the regional newspaper Romsdalsposten 1927-1933. He started working for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) in 1933, and became the leader for the news department in 1938. In April 1940 he fled from occupied Norway to neutral Sweden, and traveled to London in August 1940, to negotiate with BBC. In London he participated in the BBC's broadcasting in the Norwegian language until 1945. Øksnevad was the program director of NRK-in- exile, except for brief periods.

Designed and built by Hughes Aircraft Company (HAC) in 1983-1991, there were five VI-series satellites built: 601, 602, 603, 604, and 605.  Design  The Intelsat VI satellite was designed as a spinning satellite as had previous satellite designs. The main body of the spacecraft was spun at 30 revolutions per minute (rpm) to impart gyroscopic stability to the satellite in the Earth's gravitation field. A section of the spacecraft supporting the communications payload and antenna was de-spun to allow the antenna to point at the desired location on the earth. The Intelsat VI series combined two design features of previous HAC satellites, larger solar array and wide body design.Hughes Aircraft Corporation Space and Communications Group Intelsat V brochure 826421M/20K/10-82 The HS376 extended power spinner satellite had an extra concentric cylindrical solar array which deployed after launch to increase the power generating capability of the satellite, and allow for a larger communications payload. The U.S Government's Wide-body Spacecraft was a larger diameter satellite designed to be launched by the Space Transportation System (STS, US Space Shuttle). Thus the Intelsat VI satellite were of a wide body spinning design with a larger solar array, due to the deploy-able array. The later HS393 series of satellites also used the wide body and extended solar array design. This resulted in a spacecraft that was in diameter and approximately tall as configured for launch on an Ariane 4 rocket. When the spacecraft had arrived at its assigned orbital location, the concentric solar array would be extended (deployed), along with deployment of the communications antenna. The spacecraft would then be in length. The Intelsat VI series of satellite were designed to be launched by either Ariane 4 rockets or the U.S. Space Shuttle.  Propulsion  A liquid bi-propellant propulsion subsystem was used on the Intelsat VI series satellites, and used nitrogen tetra-oxide and mono-methyl hydrazine. Four radial thrusters, rated at 22 newtons (N) (5 lbf) are used for east-west station-keeping, and spin- up/spin-down control. Two 22 N axial mounted thrusters provide north-south station-keeping and attitude control. Two apogee thrusters were used to provide the apogee boost to the satellite and support re-orientation maneuvers. Power subsystem The solar array on the Intelsat VI was sized to provide about 2600 watts of power at the beginning of the satellites life. The Intelsat VI satellites used nickel hydrogen pressure vessel batteries to support operation when the spacecraft was in eclipse behind the earth. As noted in the introduction, the Intelsat VI series of satellites were designed with a cylindrical spacecraft body which was covered by photovoltaic (PV) solar cells. Since the satellite was rotating at 30 rpm, a flat panel solar array on a side of the spacecraft would be exposed to the sun intermittently and not generate continuous power. With a cylindrical array part of the solar array would always be in sunlight and would generate power for the spacecraft to operate. Communications payload The communications payload basically consists of the receivers, filters, amplifiers and interconnection cables or waveguide used to receive radio signals from earth transmitters, and convert them to suitable downlink frequencies, and retransmit the signals back to the earth. The Intelsat VI satellite used C band at 6 GHz for the uplink/4 GHz for the downlink, and Ku-band at 14 GHz uplink/11 GHz downlink, and had 50 communications transponders which were designed to carry 33,000 telephone circuits, the equivalent of 33,000 two way telephone calls, as well as four television channels. The Intelsat VI satellites used a RF switching network to allow static connections between the uplink channels and downlink channels. The satellite also used a time division multiple access (TDMA) dynamic microwave switching network on channels 1-2 and 3-4 to allow the dynamic cross connection of the channels for TDMA type signals.  Antennas  The antenna system and coverages were designed to be identical for all of the Intelsat VI satellites. This provided simplicity of design and manufacturing for the five satellites in the series, since all the antenna components could be made identical for each of the five satellites. It also allows for any of the VI series satellites to replace another satellite in case of an on-orbit failure. A 2.0 m diameter reflector antenna was used for receiving C-band signals transmitted up from the earth. The satellite had two C-band \\"hemi\\" beam coverages which were designed to cover the landmass areas as seen from any of the orbital locations. Four beams were designed to provide smaller zone coverage for specific areas of the earth depending on the orbital location. Both the \\"hemi\\" and zone beams used an antenna reflector in diameter with a focal length. A 149 element feed horn array and four switching networks (three were switchable in orbit) allowed the zone coverage to be changed to match the orbital location. The satellite had a C-band global coverage horn, which provided coverage of the entire earth, for receive and transmission of two channels or repeaters. The satellite also had two Ku-band steerable spot beams which could be moved to cover any specific area on the earth, and could be re- pointed as needed. The Ku-band spot beams provide both receive and transmit capability. TC&R; The telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C;), or telemetry, command and ranging (TC&R;) subsystem is used to receive spacecraft control commands sent from ground control stations, send telemetry from the satellite subsystems to ground receivers, and support tracking and ranging of the satellite by ground stations. The Intelsat VI satellites used C-band for the TC&R; subsystem, and a pair of omni-directional antennas were mounted on a deploy-able boom. Launch  Via Ariane 4 When launched by the Ariane 4 the satellite would be mounted to a SPELDA adapter (a satellite payload carrier system), which is mounted on the top of the Ariane 4 rocket. A protective shroud or fairing covers the satellite and upper stage and protects it from aerodynamic forces (high speed air flow) during launch. The fairing is jettisoned when the rocket has reached the upper atmosphere and the aerodynamic forces are no longer significant. When the upper stage has finished firing and is coasting, the upper stage (and satellite) was spun up to 5 rpm prior to release of the satellite. This provides initial stability for the satellite after release from the rocket upper stage. The Ariane 4 put the Intelsat VI satellites directly into a transfer orbit. Ground commands would fire the apogee engines for circularizing of the initial orbit and stabilization at the desired geostationary orbital location. Ground commands would then also be used to command the satellite to spin up to its normal spin rate. Via U.S. Space Shuttle When launched by the U.S. Space Shuttle a solid propellant perigee stage (motor and carrier) would be attached to the bottom of the spacecraft. This carrier was used to mount the satellite into a cradle in the Space Shuttle cargo bay. The satellite was ejected from the space shuttle \\"Frisbee-style\\" which imparted a stabilizing spin to the satellite. The satellite was allowed to drift a safe distance from the space shuttle before the perigee motor was fired.SBS F6 Prime brochure, Hughes Space and Communications Group 856268/6-85/10M The perigee motor provided energy (velocity) to the satellite to raise the apogee of the satellite's orbit; it is named for the location in the orbit at which it is used. The perigee motor was jettisoned after it was used. The liquid fuel apogee engines of the Intelsat VI satellites were then used to boost the perigee of the satellite and provide orbit circularization through apogee burns. On station Upon arrival on station (assigned geostationary orbital location) and after correct orientation, the payload (and antenna) section of the satellite would be de- spun and pointed at the desired location on the earth, the solar array would be deployed, and the communications antenna would be deployed.  Intelsat 603  Intelsat 603 was launched by a Commercial Titan III on 14 March 1990. The separation of the upper (second) stage from the satellite failed. This left the satellite and the upper stage attached to each other, and Intelsat was unable to fire the perigee motor to boost the satellite to its higher orbit. Intelsat flight controllers jettisoned the perigee motor which detached the satellite from the Titan upper stage. However without the perigee motor the satellite could not be boosted to its nominal geostationary orbit. The on- board propulsion system was used to move the satellite into a slightly higher stable orbit. Intelsat arranged for a rescue of 603 by the US Space Shuttle. STS-49 was launched on May 7, 1992, 7:40 p.m. EDT. Three of the shuttle astronauts successfully captured the satellite by hand on May 14, 1992, after several failed attempts using a capture bar. After being secured in the shuttle cargo bay, a new perigee kick motor was installed. Intelsat 603 was released from the shuttle and the perigee kick motor was successfully ignited and 603 was placed into the proper geostationary orbit.  Intelsat VI Model  A 1/2 scale model is on display in the main lobby of the Intelsat Headquarters building, which is located at 3400 International Drive NW, Washington DC 20008. There are other Intelsat satellites models displayed, along with models of several rockets that have been used to launch Intelsat satellites.

Its core was the Ioannina Eyalet, centred on the city of Ioannina in southern Epirus in 1787 but at its peak between the period of 1789-1821 it comprised most of Southern and Central Albania, Thessaly, western portions of Greek Macedonia in Northern Greece and Peloponnese. It basically included for 33-34 years southern and central Albania and most of today's modern Greece. History Firman issued by Ali Pasha in 1810 and written in vernacular Greek. Ali used Osmanlica ( Ottoman Turkish) and Koine Greek for all his courtly dealings. In 1787 Ali Pasha was awarded the pashalik of Trikala in reward for his support for the sultan's war against Austria. This was not enough to satisfy his ambitions; shortly afterwards, in 1788, he seized control of Ioannina, which remained his power base for the next 34 years. Like other semi-autonomous regional leaders that emerged in that time, such as Osman Pazvantoğlu, he took advantage of a weak Ottoman government to expand his territory still further until he gained de facto control of most of Southern Albania, western Greece and the Peloponnese, either directly or through his sons. Ali's policy as ruler of Yanina was governed by little more than simple expediency; he operated as a semi-independent despot and allied himself with whoever offered the most advantage at the time. In order to gain a seaport on the Ionian coast Ali formed an alliance with Napoleon I of France who had established Francois Pouqueville as his general consul in Yanina. After the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 where Napoleon granted the Czar his plan to dismantle the Ottoman Empire, Ali switched sides and allied with the British. His machinations were permitted by the Ottoman government in Constantinople from a mixture of expediency – it was deemed better to have Ali as a semi-ally than as an enemy – and weakness, as the central government did not have enough strength to oust him at that time. The poet George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron visited Ali's court in Yanina in 1809 and recorded the encounter in his work Childe Harold. He evidently had mixed feelings about the despot, noting the splendour of Ali's court and some Orthodox cultural revival that he had encouraged in Yanina, which Byron described as being \\"superior in wealth, refinement and learning\\" to any other Albanian town. In a letter to his mother, however, Byron deplored Ali's cruelty: \\"His Highness is a remorseless tyrant, guilty of the most horrible cruelties, very brave, so good a general that they call him the Mahometan Buonaparte ... but as barbarous as he is successful, roasting rebels, etc..\\" Ali Pasha's grave. In 1820, Ali ordered the assassination of a political opponent in Constantinople. The reformist Sultan Mahmud II, who sought to restore the authority of the Sublime Porte, took this opportunity to move against Ali by ordering his deposition. Ali refused to resign his official posts and put up a formidable resistance to Ottoman troop movements, indirectly helping the Greek Independence as some 20,000 Turkish troops were fighting Ali's formidable army. On 4 December 1820 Ali Pasha and the Souliotes formed an anti-Ottoman coalition, in which the Souliotes contributed 3,000 soldiers. Ali Pasha gained the support of Souliotes mainly because he offered to allow the return of the Souliotes in their land and partially because of Ali's appeal based on shared Albanian origin. Initially the coalition was successful and managed to control most of the region, but when the Muslim Albanian troops of Ali Pasha were informed of the beginning of the Greek revolts in the Morea they abandoned it. In January 1822, however, Ottoman agents assassinated Ali Pasha and sent his head to the Sultan. After his death, the pashalik ceased to exist and was merged with Pashalik of Berat for creating again Ioannina Eyalet with Sanjak of Ioannina, Sanjak of Berat, Gjirokastër and Preveza.

Mower (born January 31, 1933) is an American cardiologist and the co-inventor of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. He has served in several professional capacities at Sinai Hospital and Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. In 1996, he became the chairman and chief executive officer of Mower Research Associates. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2002 for the development of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator with Michel Mirowski in the 1970s. He now continues his research in the biomechanical engineering laboratories at Johns Hopkins University. Early life Morton Mower was born in Baltimore and raised in Frederick, Maryland. His father was a shoe repairman and his mother raised three children. During his summers while in grade school, Mower worked at his Uncle Sam's salt-water bathhouses in Atlantic City. Shortly thereafter, he became a salesman at his uncle's toy store on the Atlantic City boardwalk. When Mower was 15 years old, his uncle fell ill and a family physician made frequent house calls to treat Mower's uncle. Mower was inspired by the outstanding quality of patient care the family physician provided. As a result, Mower applied to Johns Hopkins University to pursue medical studies. Education Mower graduated from the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University in 1955. He then graduated from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1959. From 1963 to 1965, he served as a captain and Chief of Medicine in the Medical Corps of the United States Army in Bremerhaven, Germany. After returning from Germany, he served his residency and a fellowship in cardiology at Sinai Hospital. Career During his fellowship at Sinai Hospital in 1966, Mower was named co-investigator of a coronary drug project. Then in 1969, he started work on an implantable heart defibrillator with Michel Mirowski, an Israeli physician. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Mower served in several capacities at Sinai Hospital. He was a research associate in the Cardiopulmonary Laboratory, acting administrative director of the Division of Cardiology, acting chief of cardiology, and chief of cardiology. Mower also held the positions of secretary-treasurer, vice- president, and president of the medical staff at Sinai Hospital. Medical licenses Mower is a licensed cardiologist in Maryland, Colorado, and Minnesota. He is Board Certified in internal medicine and cardiovascular diseases. Professorships Mower has served as instructor in medicine, assistant professor, associate professor, and visiting associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He has also served as professor of physiology and biophysics at Howard University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C. Private sector In 1989, Mower became vice president of medical science at Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. in St. Paul, Minnesota. While at Cardiac Pacemakers, he designed and executed studies in medical education. From 1995 to 1996, he was a senior consultant for Guidant Corporation, a branch of Boston Scientific that manufactures cardiovascular medical products. In 1996, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Mower Research Associates in Baltimore, Maryland. Inventions Mower's most notable invention is the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD). Mower holds 26 patents, which includes one for a special ski boot that helps skiers make sharp turns. Automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) The AICD was an implantable defibrillator that served as a substitute to portable defibrillators for patients with chronic cardiac problems. The AICD performs the same function as the portable defibrillator developed by Prof. Frank Pantridge in Belfast in the 1960s. Skepticism Several cardiology experts doubted the AICD's potential for clinical success. In 1972 Bernard Lown, the inventor of the external defibrillator, wrote in the journal Circulation, \\"The very rare patient who has frequent bouts of ventricular fibrillation is best treated in a coronary care unit and is better served by an effective antiarrhythmic program or surgical correction of inadequate coronary blood flow or ventricular malfunction. In fact, the implanted defibrillator system represents an imperfect solution in search of a plausible and practical application.\\" Inventors Marlin Stephen Heilman, Alois A. Langer, Morton Mower, and Michel Mirowski were the first physicians to jointly develop the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Dr. Michel Mirowski was inspired to develop the device after the death of his mentor, Dr. Harry Heller. Heller was the director of medicine at the Israeli hospital at which Mirowski had completed his residency. While serving his fellowship at Johns Hopkins University, Mirowski discovered that Heller had suffered an attack of ventricular fibrillation. Heller died several weeks after his first attack because he refused to remain under observation in a hospital. Heller's death prompted Mirowski to begin work on an implantable defibrillator for patients in need of continuous heart monitoring. In 1968, Mirowski, then the director of the Coronary Care Unit at Sinai Hospital, met Mower, the chief of medicine in the Coronary Care Unit. In 1973, Mirowski and Mower partnered with Heilman, the founder of Medrad, a medical device company, to develop a working prototype of the implantable defibrillator. Alois Langer was also involved in the development of the AICD because he held extensive knowledge in the field of electrocardiograph signal analysis. Concept The automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD). Normally, the heart's pacemaker regulates the contraction of the heart's ventricles. Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia occur when there are irregularities in the electrical signals from the pacemaker, causing the heart's ventricles to contract abnormally and preventing blood from circulating throughout the body. Ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia can lead to sudden cardiac death if not treated immediately. An implantable defibrillator is a device implanted under the skin through an incision in the shoulder. Leads from the implanted defibrillator pass through a vein into the heart. The leads are attached to electrodes that monitor the electrical activity in the heart. When irregular electrical activity is detected in the heart, the defibrillator delivers a shock to restore normal electrical activity. The automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator is the size of a deck of cards and weighs nine ounces. Although these devices have become smaller since they were first patented, the technology from the original patent has not been replaced by new technology. The AICD patent (U.S. Patent 4,202,340), issued on May 13, 1980, is entitled “Method and Apparatus for Monitoring Heart Activity, Detecting Abnormalities, and Cardioverting a Malfunctiong Heart.” First human implantation Despite the lack of financial backing and grants, Mower and his team of physicians developed a working AICD by 1980. Dr. Levi Watkins, Jr. implanted the first AICD in a human patient in February 1980. At the time of the implantation, Mirowski and Mower had demonstrated that the device was effective in canines. The operating room at Johns Hopkins Hospital in which the first operation took place was crowded with onlookers. Mower recalled, “It was the talk of the whole hospital that these crazy guys are going to put in an automatic defibrillator. If something had gone awry, we would have never lived it down.” Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). After the device was implanted, physicians induced a cardiac arrhythmia in the patient and the AICD was successful in restoring normal electrical activity to the heart. The patient, a resident of California, died from unrelated causes 10 years after the surgery was completed. Commercial success The AICD received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 1985. Eli Lilly and Co. commercialized the device and began marketing it in the late 1980s. From 1980 to 1985, over 800 patients were treated with automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators. By 1988, nearly 5,000 people had benefited from the device. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has estimated that 416,000 AICDs were implanted between 1990 and 2002 in the United States. The device is now implanted in over 300,000 people worldwide and is 99% effective in correcting heart rhythm abnormalities and cardiac arrest. United States Vice President Dick Cheney received an implantable defibrillator in 2002. Improvements to the original design Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. (CPI), which has since become Guidant, acquired the rights to the AICD in May 1985. The first AICD was five times larger and three times heavier than Guidant's latest implantable defibrillators. In the 1980s, Mower improved his original defibrillator by redesigning the AICD to administer resynchronization therapy.

In 2004 he received the first Career Achievement Award from Chiang Mai University in Thailand. In 2001, he was the recipient of the University of Maryland Medical Alumni Association's Honor Award & Gold Key. Mower is currently a member of the Mirowski Committee that selects the recipient of the annual Mirowski Award for Excellence in Clinical Cardiology and Electrophysiology. Personal life Family Mower married Tobia Kurland on September 23, 1965, and they have two children, Mark and Robin Sara. Social involvement Mower has served on the Board of Jewish Recovery Houses, an organization that helps Jewish men and women in the early stages of recovery from alcohol and drug addiction. He served on the board of directors of House of Hope, a faith based recovery house for Jewish men, founded in 1994 by Baltimore community activists Jon and Ina Singer. Mower and his wife have also been very involved with Tova House, a recovery house for Jewish women, founded several years later by the Associated Jewish Charities of Baltimore and subsequently purchased from the Associated by House of Hope. The recovery houses use a 12-step program to rehabilitate drug and alcohol addicts. All residents are required to attend Friday Shabbat dinners. Mower explained, \\"The addicts felt put off that they had to go to churches for their AA meetings. It's a very self-destructive feeling. You're all alone.” Mower is also a member of the Jewish National Fund, Hadassah, and Ben Gurion University. Art collection Mower and his wife often put their extensive collection of art on exhibit at the Mattin Center at Johns Hopkins University. Pieces in their collection include: *60 Rembrandt prints *Lithograph by Roy Lichtenstein entitled Hunter and Dog (1951) *Andy Warhol’s Hamburger prints (1986) *Icon, a silkscreen print of a barking dog by Keith Haring (1990) The Mowers endowed the Mattin Center’s drawing studio, which opened in 2001. Their home collection includes works by Degas, Pissarro, Sisley, Bonnard, Renoir, Picasso, Léger, and Warhol. About his interest in art, Mower said, “For me collecting these etchings has been a unique opportunity to demystify some of the techniques of art and gain insight into those times. I’ve long been fascinated with modes of multiple reproductions—silkscreen, lithography, engraving. Etching was the photography of Rembrandt’s day. And he gives us a window into both the everyday life and cosmopolitan themes that captured his imagination.” Political contributions In 2008, Mower contributed $2,000 to the political action committee of Republican Andy Harris (U.S. Congress). In 2007, Mower contributed $2,600 to the political action committee of Republican Michael Steele (U.S. Congress). In 2000, Mower contributed $1,000 to the political action committee of Republican Paul Rappaport (U.S. Senate) Hobbies Mower is an avid skier and offers informal ski lessons. Current work Mower continues his research in the biomechanical engineering laboratories at Johns Hopkins University. His current work focuses on the correction of auricular fibrillation. Legacy In celebration of the twenty- fifth anniversary of the first successful implantation of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator, Sinai Hospital renamed the Sinai Medical Office Building on Belvedere Avenue in Baltimore the Morton Mower, M.D. Medical Office Building. Neil M. Meltzer, president and chief operating officer of Sinai Hospital, said, “It is an honor, on behalf of the institution where their journey began, to salute the enduring legacy of Michel Mirowski, M.D., and Morton Mower, M.D. The research done here, at Sinai Hospital, by Mirowski and Mower has helped improve the quality of life for thousands of patients. The hospital continues to follow in their footsteps, providing the highest level of commitment to cardiology and medicine to its patients.” Key patents Method and apparatus for treating hemodynamic dysfunction Method and Apparatus to Allow Cyclic Pacing at an Average Rate Just Above the Intrinsic Heart Rate so as to Maximize Inotropic Pacing Effects at Minimal Heart Rates Cardioverting Device Having Single Intravascular Catheter Electrode System and Method for its Use Cardiac Electrode with Attachment Fin Atrial Sensing and Multiple Site Stimulation as Intervention Means for Atrial Fibrillation Method and apparatus for correcting abnormal cardiac activity by low energy shocks Low Energy Defibrillation Electrode Antitachycardial Pacing System and method for multiple site biphasic stimulation to revert ventricular arrhythmias References Wickelgren, Ingrid. \\"New Devices are Helping Transform Coronary Care.\\" Science 272 (1996): 668-70.

During Miller's government, the Anti-Proprietors, led by John Culpeper, provoked the Culpeper's Rebellion.  Career   Early years  Miller, originally a merchant and apothecary in Ireland, emigrated to North Carolina and settled in Albemarle County in 1673, where he secured leadership of the proprietary political faction. Miller was later jailed for blasphemy, treason, and loathing towards the Lords Proprietors, although the Virginia Council acquitted him in May 1676. After the trial, he travelled with Thomas Eastchurch to London, England, where they convinced the Lords Proprietors that Eastchurch should govern Albemarle County. Miller was granted the titles of council member, secretary, and customs collector. In 1677, Miller and Eastchurch travelled to Albemarle.NCpedia: Thomas Miller. Written by Dennis F. Daniel. Research Branch, NC Office of Archives and History, 2006.

Written by J.D.Lewis. 2007. Miller was nominated because after leaving London and embarking again to North Carolina together with Eastchurch, they had to stop temporarily at Nevis Island in the Caribbean. Eastchurch met and married a woman on the island before eventually returning to North Carolina and spending his honeymoon there. During his absence, Miller occupied his place in the government of the county,Culpeper Rebellion. North Carolina History project. 2015 John Locke Foundation. being elected by Eastchurch because he was his fellow proprietary and travelling companion. Miller arrived in Albemarle in July 1677 and claimed the government of Albemarle county. During his role he punished the anti-proprietors for several offences which they had apparently committed. He also increased taxes and diverted public money in order to cover the salary of his armed guards. Miller jailed Zachariah Gillam for customs violations and he also tried to jail George Durant, the leader of the anti-proprietary faction, which led to the Culpeper's Rebellion against him in Albemarle.  Culpeper's Rebellion and consequences  The revolt began when Thomas Miller was apprehended by his opponents and imprisoned in a log house of about 10 or 11 square feet, that had been purposely built for him. Although Eastchurch arrived in Virginia in December 1678, he could not occupy the position of governor of Albemarle because of the developing revolution there. He demanded that the settlers should surrender their weapons, and that all prisoners should be released. Furthermore, he recommended that a delegation should be formed with the aim of teaching those who visited Virginia the origin of the popular revolt, and that Miller's government was to be restored. Although Eastchurch's demands were rejected, he was able to stop the advancement of the trial developing against Miller. Therefore; although he remained in prison for two years until his friends broke him out, his execution was avoided. Miller travelled to London to complain to the Lords Proprietors, the Commissioners of Customs, and the Privy Council about the events that had happened. Because of this, the leaders of Culpeper's Rebellion, Zachariah Gillam and John Culpeper, were jailed after their arrival in London, although Gillam was released from jail because of the lack of evidence to prove the charges. Culpeper himself was later absolved of his treason. As compensation, the royal treasury paid Thomas Miller.  Last years  In March 1681, he was appointed customs collector in Poole, England. However, in July 1682, he was fired from this position and incarcerated for embezzlement. He later died in prison sometime in October 1685.

Early life Born in Hampden, Maine, Curtis attended the normal schools while growing up. He never graduated, but instead worked for the family and others to earn a living. He initially earned a salary of $5 a month, but eventually worked his way up to $24 a month. Curtis worked as a farmhand as well as a swamper, clearing underbrush and making roads through the woods. Mid life Curtis thought it would be practical to use spruce resin, beeswax and flavorings to make spruce gum as a chewing gum. His family moved to Bangor in 1848, where there would be a better market for such a product. Over a Franklin stove in the Curtis home, they cooked up their first batch. The label they printed on their new product read \\"State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum.\\" Curtis made a sufficient production of his gum and went to market it in Portland, Maine. This was the first commercial production of chewing gum. For the first two days in Portland he had no luck selling this new product to merchants. The third day he finally made a sale, but it was a hard sale because of the annoying nature of the product. There was very little market for the product in Portland in 1848 and 1849. Curtis decided to become a traveling salesman starting in 1850, selling additional products like patent medicine. His motto was \\"Give a man all you can for his money, while making a fair profit yourself.\\" Curtis was quite ambitious and many times would travel well into the night just to get to the next town before his competition. This way he would have most of that town's business as the wholesale peddler, since the most active would get the principal patronage. The first year he traveled all throughout New England and earned six thousand dollars. Eventually Curtis advanced from being just a peddler to a commercial sales traveler, and included the West into his territory: areas west of Maine such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Minnesota and Missouri. He traveled on the Erie Canal and down through the Mississippi River and Ohio River. He would even extend credit for as much as a year. In the United States he was one of the first, if not the very first commercial sales broker as a representative of an Eastern business marketing firm. Curtis's father tended to the making of the chewing gum product while Curtis himself traveled to sell it. His father had his men pick the gum from the trees. After a week or two of collecting the raw product, they would bring it out of the woods to the Bangor factory for processing. The business did quite well and the fifteen square foot processing area became too small. They then moved their chewing gum business to larger facilities at Portland, Maine. A few pounds of raw material was adequate in their first years; however, later they bought up to ten tons of material at once. This was considered very risky. One day Curtis even purchased $35,000 worth of raw gum material, considered probably the largest transaction in that type of business ever made in the nineteenth century. Curtis and his father's firm, \\"Curtis & Son,\\" eventually increased the business to occupy a factory that was 51 x in area and three stories high. They employed 200 people, who turned out eighteen hundred boxes of chewing gum in a day. Curtis himself invented most of the machinery used in the production process. He never took out a patent on any of his inventions. The firm instead kept secret their process of making chewing gum. Some of the spruce gums Curtis & Son made were called \\"American Flag,\\" \\"Yankee Spruce,\\" \\"White Mountain,\\" \\"200 Lump Spruce,\\" \\"Licorice Lulu,\\" \\"Trunk Spruce\\", \\"Sugar Cream,\\" \\"Four-in-Hand,\\" and \\"Biggest and Best.\\" Later life In 1872, Curtis went into the dredging business. He worked on jobs that ranged from $50,000 to a half a million dollars. He was successful at this business as well. He later opened a shipyard and built ten large ships. He also owned the controlling interest in the ferry between Portland and South Portland and a line of steamers until 1896. Curtis was even in the silver and coal mining business in Maine. In 1880, Curtis was in the farming business on a grand scale near Gothenburg, Nebraska. Here he owned over where he raised Hereford cattle. In 1878, Curtis bought the largest and most expensively built house in Deering Center, Maine. During the last months of his life he took an interest in ancient Egypt and the pyramids. His creed was \\"do good.\\" In his will, Curtis bequeathed funds to the town of Bradford for the construction of a library. That library is named the John B. Curtis Free Public Library in his honor, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

MAP is designed for evaluation of a manager's proficiency in 12 prescribed competencies, and other criteria. Assessments can be generated for an employee, as well as for a department or the organisation as a whole. Normative values, used for comparative purposes in each assessment, are based upon the performance of over 110,000 managers, across 17 countries, in more than 600 organisations that have used MAP, according to the UK-based company, Development Processes Group plc, that licenses the tool into organisations. The Managerial Assessment of Proficiency - (MAP2), copyright 2012, 2014, HRD Press, Inc. is an assessment tool published by HRD Press, Inc. Amherst, MA USA, and is available throughout the world. \\"Development Processes Group plc\\" is the exclusive representative in the United Kingdom. The 12 competencies are fundamental in determining the proficiency of an effective manager, according to the methodology. Implicit in the approach for developing managerial excellence is the definition of the competencies: a \\"group of related skills, knowledge, and attitudes that correlate with success in one’s job and can be improved through training.\\" MAP assessment process Dr. Scott Parry, founder of Training House, Inc.,creator of the tool and 1999 inductee into the ASTD (ATD) and, Academy of Resource Development, Halls of Fame, developed the MAP competency framework by first analysing the results of a series of large competency studies conducted by a number of major organisations. Dr. Parry, sold Training House in 1999 to HRD Press, Inc. who authorized Development Processes Group, plc as the exclusive representative and developer of the MAP assessment within the United Kingdom. Cliff Lansley leads the further development of MAP with fellow Director Cameron Robertson has used the tool in studies across hundreds of major public and private sector organisations and he says' \\"we now have powerful benchmarking data of leadership competencies across most organisational sectors. What is unique here, is that MAP is the only objective diagnostic tool for managerial and leadership compenece measurement that exists in the world. All other tools are based merely on self-report, 360 degree opinion or subjective judgement by an assessor\\". The studies looked at a number of leading corporations to identify the competencies and attributes that were important to the performance of managers. IBM, AT&T;, Henley Management College, Ford and Kodak came up with very similar managerial competencies and these were analysed. The developers of MAP selected 12 of the most frequently mentioned competencies, those common to most frameworks, and arranged them in 4 clusters and 2 broad categories: task-handling (left column) and people-handling (right column). {  border=\\"1\\" -  administrative (managing your job)  communication (relating to others) -  time management and prioritising, setting goals and standards, planning and scheduling work  listening and organizing, giving clear information, getting unbiased information -  cognitive (thinking clearly)  supervisory (building a team) -  identifying and solving problems making decisions and weighing risk, thinking clearly and analytically  training, coaching, delegating appraising people and performance, disciplining and counselling } Dr. Scott Parry, developer of the MAP Assessment competency framework and tool, defines competencies as \\"a group of related skills, knowledge, and attitudes that correlate with success in one’s job and that can be improved through training”. The assessment involves studying a series of real-life management situations covering a week in the life of a typical manager and his team and answering a series of questions about your judgement of what you’ve seen. The situations covered include: * team meetings * time management * delegating * discipline and empathy * appraising staff * performance management * problem solving * listening. Following each short scene the delegates answer a series of questions based on what they have been watching. They are then asked if, in their opinion, the management behaviour they have seen is good or bad practice. The scenarios are very effective in getting managers to be a part of the assessment process because they are based on the real situations that they regularly have to deal with on a day-to-day basis, resulting in high face validity scores. There are also two paper-based questionnaires that help determine their preferred styles of managing and communicating and the impact that can have in the workplace. At the end of the day the assessment is scored online and a personal profile produced within minutes. This is in readiness for Day 2 of the MAP Assessment process. The second day of the process is the interpretation of the assessment scores providing delegates with a development ‘road map’ for their ongoing development. If a team is being assessed then a group profile is also produced to take into account the department or team’s training and development needs. Validating the MAP assessment Before making the assessment available to clients, Cliff Lansley, one of the developers of MAP validated the methodology in 11 organisations. Managers were selected to cover the full range of proficiency at work from ‘excellent’ to ‘below average’. Working independently, three senior managers assigned ratings on a 5-point scale to each manager being assessed, thereby establishing a rank order. A total of 253 managers from 11 organisations went through the video-based assessment. Their overall proficiency percentiles (average of the 12 competency scores) were compared with their senior managers’ ratings of their performance at work, using the Spearman's rank order correlation analysis. Correlations were positive, ranging from .71 to .92. This supported the following assumptions:- #the competencies that were assessed enabled the developers to discriminate between high performing managers and their less effective counterparts, #the assessment instrument could therefore be used as a predictive index of one’s performance on the job, #the process constituted the basis for a ‘needs analysis’ for identifying training and development opportunities. Cliff Lansley, Director and owner of Development Processes Group plc, the lead organisation for MAP across the UK, is undertaking an extended research and validation exercise and the results will be referenced on completion. The construct validity can be measured by the degree to which the developers’ assessment data agrees with the actual performance of managers at work. But participants are also concerned with face validity, the degree to which they can identify with the video episodes and accept their proficiency profile as accurate. On the post-assessment evaluation sheet, 92% said they had no difficulty relating to the episodes, and 86% said that the scores they received were probably accurate. A further examination of the list of 12 competencies will support the assumption that they can all be improved via training. This is in contrast to the characteristics, qualities, and attributes that appear in some organisations’ lists of competencies¼ self- confidence, initiative, flexibility, ambition and so on. These are best defined as personality traits, not competencies, according to Dr. Scott Parry. They are typically formed early in life and, short of clinical intervention, are not subject to significant change through participation in a training programme. The developers of MAP restricted the assessment to competencies that can be developed through training. The impact of MAP Famous chef, Raymond Blanc, experienced the tool himself and he outlines in the link below how he used MAP within his organisation and found it to be a good predictor of managerial performance. MAP has also been used as a central part of qualifications accredited by the Institute of Leadership and Management and the Chartered Management Institute. MAP has been deployed across the UK by a range of Licensed Delivery Centres by Development Processes Group PLC. One of its centres, Metricate Ltd, have supported its work in assessing and researching competencies in the construction, engineering and logistics industry sectors. The goal was to identify the implications of any deficiencies for the businesses concerned and assess how and where they impacted upon the organisation. (‘Understanding the Real Skills Gap: Management and Leadership’ 2008, Metricate Ltd). The specific management competencies in deficit on this study, according to a MAP analysis, were identified as:- #Training, coaching and delegating #Thinking clearly and analytically #Listening and organising From follow-up interviews with managers at Company Board level, there were a number of strategic and operational problem areas for companies stemming from the deficit in the management competencies described:- #problems with succession planning for the business and key staff #low profitability: chasing turnover at the sacrifice of margin #poor productivity: unproductive use of staff at all levels #response to globalisation: failure to grow and compete with larger rivals #new environmental, technology, techniques, legislation: struggling to respond and develop commercial advantage #aging workforce: inability to recruit and retain sufficient new staff #skills gaps: staff lacked the management and technical skills to compete successfully Specification of a development program The work of Metricate Ltd went on to confirm in their study that development programs were most effective in resolving the deficiencies in competence where they met the following program design specifications:- #A thorough needs analysis undertaken at the outset, to support an agreed understanding of the problems and desired outcomes #MAP measurement before and after the intervention, and against relevant industry and national benchmarks #The development program should be led ‘from the top down’, with active endorsement by the directors #Training program targeted at three levels simultaneously: the individual, teams and the organisation #Customized to organizational challenges and personalized to individuals’ needs: this is achieved through interviews, following MAP assessment #Modes of delivery matched to all learning styles: such as workshops, coaching and self-study #Development of a cross-functional approach involving different teams/ departments, to ensure an integrated understanding of the issues for the organization #Establish self and organizational awareness, to embed a culture of autonomous development #Programme over an extended period – ‘little and often’ – up to 12 months, to ensure assimilation and minimise the disruption of training #Post development assessment to measure progression and ROI (Return on Investment) See also *Human resources Websites and links * Assessment Information * Linked Training * studies and product details about MAP * a round table discussion on MAP with Cliff Lansley * the national training and development organisation responsible for MAP, based in the UK * the MAP tool explained in detail * Raymond Blanc's experience with the diagnostic tool * HRD, Academy of Resource Development, Hall of Fame – the Award is presented to scholars in human resource development and related disciplines http://www.ahrd.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=56783 * Metricate, one of the DPG plc Licensed Delivery Centres providing assessment and development programmes for the construction, engineering and logistics sectors * Article: Performance management masterclass: the fifth TJ roundtable discussion hosted by DPG plc and Dr Peter Honey examined the impact performance assessment has had on the ever-changing role of the manager Books #HRD Manager's Route to Competence: Cliff Lansley; Developing a Strategic Approach to HRD v. 3 (Paperback); # Design Learning Programmes: Cliff Lansley; (Paperback0; #Training for Results; Scott Parry; ASTD March 7, 2000; Category:Human resource management ","title":"Managerial assessment of proficiency"},{"id":"20242930","text":"The Three Doctors is a group of African-American motivational speakers, authors, and doctors.

Both truly white horses and the more common grey horses, with completely white hair coats, were identified as \\"white\\" by various religious and cultural traditions. Portrayal in myth The Hindu world saviour Kalki with his white Horse. Punjab Hills, Guler, c. 1765. From earliest times, white horses have been mythologised as possessing exceptional properties, transcending the normal world by having wings (e.g. Pegasus from Greek mythology), or having horns (the unicorn). As part of its legendary dimension, the white horse in myth may be depicted with seven heads (Uchaishravas) or eight feet (Sleipnir), sometimes in groups or singly. There are also white horses which are divinatory, who prophesy or warn of danger. As a rare or distinguished symbol, a white horse typically bears the hero- or god-figure in ceremonial roles or in triumph over negative forces. Herodotus reported that white horses were held as sacred animals in the Achaemenid court of Xerxes the Great (ruled 486–465 BC), while in other traditions the reverse happens when it was sacrificed to the gods. In more than one tradition, the white horse carries patron saints or the world saviour in the end times (as in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), is associated with the sun or sun chariot (Ossetia) or bursts into existence in a fantastic way, emerging from the sea or a lightning bolt. Though some mythologies are stories from earliest beliefs, other tales, though visionary or metaphorical, are found in liturgical sources as part of preserved, on-going traditions (see, for example, \\"Iranian tradition\\" below). Mythologies and traditions European Celtic In Celtic mythology, Rhiannon, a mythic figure in the Mabinogion collection of legends, rides a \\"pale-white\\" horse.The Four Branches of the Mabinogi: The Mabinogi of Pwyll by Will Parker (Bardic Press: 2007) . online text.

In Irish myth horses are said to be symbols of sovereignty and the sovereignty goddess Macha is associated with them. One of Cúchulainn's chariot-horses was called Liath Macha or \\"Macha's Grey\\" Bellerophon riding Pegasus The La Tène style hill figure in England, the Uffington White Horse dates back to the Bronze Age and is similar to some Celtic coin horse designs. In Scottish folklore, the kelpie or each uisge, a deadly supernatural water demon in the shape of a horse, is sometimes described as white, though other stories say it is black. Greek In Greek mythology, the white winged horse Pegasus was the son of Poseidon and the gorgon Medusa. Poseidon was also the creator of horses, creating them out of the breaking waves when challenged to make a beautiful land animal. A secondary pair of twins fathered by Zeus, Amphion and Zethus, the legendary founders of Thebes, are called \\"Dioskouroi, riders of white horses\\" (λευκόπωλος) by Euripedes in his play The Phoenician Women (the same epithet is used in Heracles and in the lost play Antiope). Norse The Tjängvide image stone is thought to show Odin entering Valhalla riding on Sleipnir. In Norse mythology, Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir, \\"the best horse among gods and men\\", is described as grey.Faulkes, Anthony (Trans.) (1995). Edda, page 36. Everyman.

Forgotten Books. Slavic In Slavic mythology, the war and fertility deity Svantovit owned an oracular white horse; the historian Saxo Grammaticus, in descriptions similar to those of Tacitus centuries before, says the priests divined the future by leading the white stallion between a series of fences and watching which leg, right or left, stepped first in each row.The Trinity- Тројство-Триглав @ veneti.info, quoting Saxo Grammaticus in the \\"Gesta Danorum\\". Hungarian One of the titles of God in Hungarian mythology was Hadúr, who, according to an unconfirmed source, wears pure copper and is a metalsmith. The Hungarian name for God was, and remains \\"Isten\\" and they followed Steppe Tengriism. The ancient Magyars sacrificed white stallions to him before a battle.Peeps at Many Lands – Hungary by H. T. Kover, READ BOOKS, 2007, , page 8. Google books copy Additionally, there is a story (mentioned for example in Gesta Hungarorum) that the Magyars paid a white horse to Moravian chieftain Svatopluk I (in other forms of the story, it is instead the Bulgarian chieftain Salan) for a part of the land that later became the Kingdom of Hungary. Actual historical background of the story is dubious because Svatopluk I was already dead when the first Hungarian tribes arrived. On the other hand, even Herodotus mentions in his Histories an Eastern custom, where sending a white horse as payment in exchange for land means casus belli. This custom roots in the ancient Eastern belief that stolen land would lose its fertility. Iranian In Zoroastrianism, one of the three representations of Tishtrya, the hypostasis of the star Sirius, is that of a white stallion (the other two are as a young man, and as a bull). The divinity takes this form during the last 10 days of every month of the Zoroastrian calendar, and also in a cosmogonical battle for control of rain. In this latter tale (Yasht 8.21–29), which appears in the Avesta's hymns dedicated to Tishtrya, the divinity is opposed by Apaosha, the demon of drought, which appears as a black stallion. White horses are also said to draw divine chariots, such as that of Aredvi Sura Anahita, who is the Avesta's divinity of the waters. Representing various forms of water, her four horses are named \\"wind\\", \\"rain\\", \\"clouds\\" and \\"sleet\\" (Yasht 5.120). Hindu White horses appear many times in Hindu mythology and stand for the sun. The Vedic horse sacrifice or Ashvamedha was a fertility and kingship ritual involving the sacrifice of a sacred grey or white stallion.Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend by Anna L. Dallapiccola. Thames and Hudson, 2002. . Similar rituals may have taken place among Roman, Celtic and Norse people, but the descriptions are not so complete. Uchchaihshravas In the Puranas, one of the precious objects that emerged while the devas and demons were churning the milky ocean was Uchaishravas, a snow-white horse with seven heads. Turaga was another divine white horse that emerged out of the ocean and taken by the sun god Surya. Uchaishravas was at times ridden by Indra, lord of the devas. Indra is depicted as having a liking for white horses in several legends – he often steals the sacrificial horse to the consternation of all involved, such as in the story of Sagara,The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa: Book 3, Vana Parva.

Hayagriva the Avatar of Vishnu is worshipped as the God of knowledge and wisdom, with a human body and a horse's head, brilliant white in colour, with white garments and seated on a white lotus. Kalki, the tenth incarnation of Vishnu and final world saviour, is predicted to appear riding a white horse, or in the form of a white horse. Buddhist Kanthaka was a white horse that was a royal servant and favourite horse of Prince Siddhartha, who later became Gautama Buddha. Siddhartha used Kanthaka in all major events described in Buddhist texts prior to his renunciation of the world. Following the departure of Siddhartha, it was said that Kanthaka died of a broken heart. Abrahamic Jewish The Book of Zechariah twice mentions coloured horses; in the first passage there are three colours (red, dappled, and white), and in the second there are four teams of horses (red, black, white, and finally dappled) pulling chariots. The second set of horses are referred to as \\"the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world.\\" They are described as patrolling the earth and keeping it peaceful.

Native American In Blackfoot mythology, the snow deity Aisoyimstan is a white-coloured man in white clothing who rides a white horse. Literature and art The statue of the \\"fine lady upon a white horse\\" at Banbury Cross. The mythological symbolism of white horses has been picked up as a trope in literature, film, and other storytelling. For example, the heroic prince or white knight of fairy tales often rides a white horse. Unicorns are (generally white) horse- like creatures with a single horn. And the English nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross\\" refers to a lady on a white horse who may be associated with the Celtic goddess Rhiannon. A \\"white palfrey\\" appears in the fairy tale \\"Virgilius the Sorcerer\\" by Andrew Lang. It appears in The Violet Fairy Book and attributes more than usual magical powers to the ancient Roman poet Virgil (see also Virgil#Mysticism and hidden meanings). The British author G. K. Chesterton wrote an epic poem titled Ballad of the White Horse. In Book I, \\"The Vision of the King,\\" he writes of earliest England, invoking the white horse hill figure and the gods: The white horse is a recurring motif in Ibsen's play Rosmersholm, making use of the common Norse folklore that its appearance was a portent of death. The basis for the superstition may have been that the horse was a form of Church Grim, buried alive at the original consecration of the church building (the doomed protagonist in the play was a pastor), or that it was a materialisation of the fylgje, an individual's or family's guardian spirit.

The number of sheep in New Zealand peaked in the 1980s and is now reducing due to lower profits. In New Zealand, agriculture is the largest sector of the tradable economy, contributing about two-thirds of exported goods in 2006–7. The export figure includes agriculture, horticulture and forestry. For the year ended March 2002, agricultural exports were valued at over $14.8 billion. New Zealand is unique in being the only developed country to be totally exposed to the international markets since subsidies, tax concessions and price supports for the agricultural sector were removed in the 1980s. However, as of 2017, the New Zealand Government still provides state investment in infrastructure which supports agriculture. Pastoral farming is the major land use but there are increases in land area devoted to horticulture. New Zealand is a member of the Cairns Group, which is seeking to have free trade in agricultural goods. History Early label from a tin of mutton from New Zealand The government offered a number of subsidies during the 1970s to assist farmers after the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community and by the early 1980s government support provided some farmers with 40 percent of their income. In 1984 the Labour government ended all farm subsidies under Rogernomics, and by 1990 the agricultural industry became the most deregulated sector in New Zealand. To stay competitive in the heavily subsidised European and US markets New Zealand farmers had to increase the efficiency of their operations. Animal farming is pasture based; cows and sheep are rarely housed or fed large quantities of grain, with most farmers using grass based supplements such as hay and silage during feed shortages. Pigs are usually kept indoors, either in gestation crates, farrowing crates, fattening pens, or group housing. Production In 2018, New Zealand produced 414 thousand tons of Kiwifruit (it was the 3rd largest producer in the world). In addition, in the same year, it produced 511 thousand tons of potato, 453 thousand tons of apple, 426 thousand tons of grape, 379 thousand tons of barley, 371 thousand tons of wheat, 265 thousand tons of maize, 246 thousand tons of onion, in addition to smaller yields of other agricultural products, such as pumpkin, tomato and carrot.New Zealand production in 2018, by FAO Sectors Pastoral farming Beef and dairy cattle are important components of New Zealand agriculture In Northland, the major form of pastoral farming is beef cattle. In the Waikato and Taranaki areas, dairy cattle predominate. Through the rest of New Zealand, sheep farming is the major rural activity, with beef cattle farming in the hills and high country, and dairying increasing in Canterbury, Otago and Southland.New Zealand Official Yearbook, 2008, p 359 New Zealand is the world's eighth largest milk producer, with about 2.2% of world production. Total production was 1.3 billion kg of milk solids, and $8.38 billion of dairy products were exported in the year ending 30 September 2007.New Zealand Official Yearbook, 2008, p 358 There are approximately 4.2 million dairy milking cows in New Zealand, and 5.26 million dairy cattle in total at 30 June 2007, an increase from 3 million in 1982. In mid-2005, there were 12,786 dairy farms, with a total area of 2.1 million hectares. Traditional dairy production areas are the wetter areas of the country: Waikato, Taranaki, Southland, Northland, Horowhenua, Manawatu and Westland. Fonterra is the major processor of milk in New Zealand. It processes 94.8 percent of all milk solids from dairy farms. Other large dairy companies are Tatua Co-operative Dairy Company, Westland Milk Products and Synlait. Rural landscape with sheep Livestock is predominantly grass-fed, but hay and silage is used in the winter months to make up for slower pasture growth. There were 38.5 million sheep and 4.39 million beef cattle in New Zealand in June 2007. The number of sheep saw a substantial fall from the 70.3 million in 1982, while beef cattle numbers declined by about ten percent over the same period. In June 2006. 573,000 tonnes of sheep meat was produced in 2006–7, and 164,000 tonnes of clean wool. $2.08 billion of lamb, $283 million of mutton, and $938 million of raw wool and wool products was exported in the year ending 30 September 2007. Production of beef and veal in 2006-7 was 623,000 tonnes, with $1.64 billion in exports. There were 13,254 beef farms, 13,905 sheep farms and 1,614 mixed beef/sheep farms in 2005, with areas of 1.5 million hectares, 8.1 million hectares, and 655,000 hectares respectively.New Zealand Official Yearbook, 2008, pp 360–61New Zealand Official Yearbook, 2008, p 365 Deer farming has increased dramatically from a herd of 150,000 in 1982 to 1.59 million in 2006, with 1,617 deer farms occupying 218,000 hectares of land in 2005. $252 million of venison was exported in the year ending 30 September 2007. New Zealand is the largest exporter of farmed venison in the world. In the 1970s and 80s there was a huge industry carrying out live deer recovery from forested areas of New Zealand. The deer are a pest animal that has a negative impact on the biodiversity of New Zealand. The deer-farm stock was bred from the recovered wild animals. In 2005, there were 264 pig farms with a total area of 12,831 hectares. There were also 855 mixed livestock farms and 633 other livestock farms, with areas of 178 and 18,000 hectares, respectively. The 50,000 tonnes of pork produced in 2007 was supplemented by 40,000 tonnes of imported pork products to meet domestic demand.New Zealand Official Yearbook, 2008, pp 368–9 14.7 million chickens were raised for meat in 2007, with 145 tonnes of chicken meat produced. No other poultry is raised in significant numbers in New Zealand. Approximately 3.1 million laying hens are kept, producing 900 million eggs in 2006. Goats are also farmed for meat, milk, and mohair, and to control weeds. Forestry Marlborough Milling of New Zealand's extensive native forests was one of the earliest industries in the settlement of the country. The long, straight hardwood from the kauri was ideal for ship masts and spars. As the new colony was established, timber was the most common building material, and vast areas of native forest were cleared. Rimu, tōtara, matai, and miro were the favoured timbers. The Monterrey Pine, Pinus radiata was introduced to New Zealand in the 1850s.New Zealand Official yearbook, 1990 It thrived in the conditions, reaching maturity in 28 years, much faster than in its native California. It was found to grow well in the infertile acidic soil of the volcanic plateau, where attempts at agriculture had failed. The Government initiated planting of exotic forests in 1899 at Whakarewarewa, near Rotorua. This was to address growing timber shortages as slow-growing native forests were exhausted. In the 1930s, vast areas of land were planted in Pinus radiata by relief workers. The largest tract was the 188,000-hectare Kāingaroa forest, the largest plantation forest in the world. As the major forests matured, processing industries such as the Kinleith Mill at Tokoroa and the Tasman Mill at Kawerau were established. Plantation forests of various sizes can now be found in all regions of New Zealand except Central Otago and Fiordland. In 2006 their total area was 1.8 million hectares, with 89% in Pinus radiata and 5% in Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) Log harvesting in 2006 was 18.8 million m3, down from 22.5 million m3 in 2003. This is projected to rise as high as 30 million m3 as newer forests mature. The value of all forestry exports (logs, chips, sawn timber, panels and paper products) for the year ended 31 March 2006 was $NZ 3.62 billion. This is projected to rise to $4.65 billion by 2011. Australia accounts for just over 25% of export value, mostly paper products, followed by Japan, South Korea, China and the United States. Within the New Zealand economy, forestry accounts for approximately 4% of national GDP. On the global stage, the New Zealand forestry industry is a relatively small contributor in terms of production, accounting for 1% of global wood supply for industrial purposes. Horticulture Marlborough New Zealand has around 135,000 hectares of horticultural land. Total exports in 2018 were valued at $5,474 million, of which $4,286 million (78.3%) come from three products: kiwifruit, wine, and apples. There are about 400 growers of stone fruit who utilise 3000 hectares of land, mostly in the Hawke's Bay and Otago regions. Three-quarters of the fruit produced is consumed domestically. Peaches, nectarines and plums are produced for domestic consumption, and apricots and cherries, almost all from Otago, are exported. About 30 varieties of apples and pears are exported, with over 16 million tray carton equivalents (18 kg) of apples and 300,000 tce's of pears exported in 2007. Most pipfruit is grown in the Hawke's Bay and Tasman regions, with about 10,000 hectares planted.New Zealand Official Yearbook, 2008, pp 372–73 Kiwifruit is grown in many regions of the North Island and in the north of the South Island, but is most concentrated in the Bay of Plenty. There are 2,700 kiwifruit growers, with over 13,000 hectares planted. Over 80 million trays of kiwifruit were exported in 2006, about one- quarter of the world's production. Kiwifruit is New Zealand's largest horticultural export by value. In 2007 there were over 29,000 hectares planted in grapes (mostly in Marlborough, Hawke's Bay and Gisborne), 205,000 tonnes of grapes were produced, and there were 543 wineries. Citrus fruit is grown in Gisborne, Northland and Auckland. Blackcurrants and other berry fruits are grown in Tasman, Waikato, Canterbury and Auckland. Avocados and other subtropical fruits are grown in Northland and the Bay of Plenty. Total exports of fresh fruit were worth $1,200 million in 2007, and $105 million of processed fruit was also exported. 76 million litres of wine, worth $698 million, was exported.New Zealand Official Yearbook, 2008, p 374 Vegetable growing occupies more than 50,000 hectares of land and employs 25,000 people. More than 50 different vegetables are grown in New Zealand. Approximately 1,450 growers produce fresh vegetables with a value of over $400 million in 2007. $260 million of fresh vegetables, mainly onions and squash, were exported in 2007. 750 growers produce vegetables worth over $100 million for processing, and $297 million of processed and frozen vegetables, mostly potatoes, sweetcorn and peas, were exported in 2007. $63 million worth of seeds and bulbs, and $43 million of cut flowers and foliage, were exported in 2007.  Arable crops  Hay bales in Otago Almost all hay and silage is consumed on the same farm as it is produced. Most supplementary feed crops are grown in the South Island, where the colder climate forces additional feeding of stock during winter. Wheat is mostly grown in the Canterbury region and is used for domestic consumption in bread and biscuits. By-products are bran and pollard, which are used for stock feed. Barley is used for stock feed and for malt. Some barley is exported, depending on international price fluctuations. Maize is grown in the Waikato and Manawatu-Wanganui regions as feed for chickens, pigs and cattle. Oats are grown in Canterbury and Southland for animal feed, and for rolled oats and oatmeal.New Zealand Official Yearbook, 2008, pp 370–71 Aquaculture Mussel long line in Pelorus Sound Aquaculture started in New Zealand in the late 1960s and is dominated by mussels, oysters and salmon. In 2007, aquaculture generated about NZ$360 million in sales on an area of 7,700 hectares with a total of $240 million earned in exports. In 2006, the aquaculture industry in New Zealand developed a strategy aimed at achieving a sustainable annual billion NZ dollar business by 2025. In 2007, the government reacted by offering more support to the growing industry. Beekeeping New Zealand had 2,602 beekeepers at the end of 2007, who owned 313,399 hives. Total honey production was 9700 tonnes. Pollen, beeswax, and propolis are also produced. Beekeepers provide pollination services to horticulturalists, which generates more income than the products of bee culture. Approximately 20–25,000 queen bees, and 20 tonnes of packaged bees (which include worker bees and a queen) are exported live each year.New Zealand Official Yearbook, 2008, p 370 Organic farming Organic farming practices began on a commercial scale in the 1980s and is now an increasing segment of the market with some of the larger companies such as Wattie's becoming involved.

Māori burned forest to flush out game and to encourage the growth of bracken fern, which was used as a food source, and practised agriculture using plants they brought from tropical Polynesia. The Europeans logged and burned off a third of the forest cover to convert land to pastoral farming. In 1993, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research summarised available data on the quality of water in rivers. They concluded that \\"lowland river reaches in agriculturally developed catchments are in poor condition\\" reflecting \\"agriculturally derived diffuse and point source waste inputs in isolation or in addition to urban or industrial waste inputs\\". The key contaminants identified in lowland rivers were dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved reactive phosphorus and faecal contamination. Small streams in dairy farming areas were identified as being in very poor condition. New Zealand's rivers and lakes are becoming increasingly nutrient enriched and degraded by nitrogen, animal faecal matter, and eroded sediment.Oram, R. (2007). The RMA now and in the future, paper presented at the Beyond the RMA conference, Environmental Defence Society, Auckland, NZ, 30–31 May Many waterways are now unsafe for swimming. Fish and Game New Zealand launched a \\"dirty dairying\\" campaign to highlight the effect of intensive agriculture on waterways. Fonterra, the largest dairy company in New Zealand, in conjunction with government agencies responded with the Dairying and Clean Streams Accord. In 2009, the Crafar Farms group of dairy farms in the North Island became known as the 'poster boys for dirty dairying' after a string of prosecutions in the Environment Court for unlawful discharges of dairy effluent. In 2004 the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment released a report on the environmental effects of farming in New Zealand. It noted that the trend was towards an increasing pressure on New Zealand's natural capital. Between 1994 and 2002 the number of dairy cows increased by 34% and the land area used grew by just 12% resulting in a more intensive land use. In the same period synthetic fertiliser use across all sectors grew by 21% and urea use grew by 160%. Almost half of the greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand are due to the agricultural sector. A portion of this is due to methane from belching ruminants. An agricultural emissions research levy was proposed, quickly becoming known as the \\"Fart Tax\\". The proposed levy encountered opposition from the farming sector and the National Party, resulting in plans for the levy being abandoned. The Pastoral Greenhouse Gas Research Consortium was formed as an alternative to imposing the levy on farmers. Agricultural pests A number of plant and animal introductions into New Zealand has reduced the income from farming. Tight border controls to improve biosecurity have been put into place to ensure any new and unwanted pests and diseases do not enter the country. Monitoring is done around sea and airports to check for any incursions. Animal pests The Common Brushtail Possum was introduced from Australia to establish a fur trade. It soon became one of New Zealand's most problematic invasive species because of the huge effect on the biodiversity of New Zealand as well affecting agricultural production since it is a vector for Bovine tuberculosis. The disease now endemic in possums across approximately 38 per cent of New Zealand (known as 'vector risk areas'). In these areas, nearly 70 per cent of new herd infections can be traced back to possums or ferrets. The Biosecurity Act 1993, which established a National Pest Management Strategy, is the legislation behind control of the disease in New Zealand. The Animal Health Board (AHB) operates a nationwide programme of cattle testing and possum control with the goal of eradicating M. bovis from wild vector species across 2.5 million hectares – or one quarter – of New Zealand's at-risk areas by 2026 and, eventually, eradicating the disease entirely. Possums are controlled through a combination of trapping, ground-baiting and, where other methods are impractical, aerial treatment with 1080 poison. From 1979–1984, possum control was stopped due to lack of funding. In spite of regular and frequent TB testing of cattle herds, the number of infected herds snowballed and continued to increase until 1994. The area of New Zealand where there were TB wild animals expanded from about 10 to 40 per cent. That possums are such effective transmitters of TB appears to be facilitated by their behaviour once they succumb to the disease. Terminally ill TB possums will show increasingly erratic behaviour, such as venturing out during the daytime to get enough food to eat, and seeking out buildings in which to keep warm. As a consequence they may wander onto paddocks, where they naturally attract the attention of inquisitive cattle and deer. This behaviour has been captured on video. The introduced Canada Geese became prolific and began to adversely affect pastures and crops. In 2011 restrictions on hunting them were dropped to allow them to be culled. Plant pests Gorse was introduced as a hedgerow plant but has become the most expensive agricultural plant pest costing millions of dollars in efforts to control its spread over farmland. Other serious pasture and crop land plant pest are nodding thistle (Carduus nutans), Californian thistle (Cirsium arvense), ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), broom (Cytisus scoparius), giant buttercup (Ranunculus acris), fat-hen (Chenopodium album), willow weed (Polygonum persicaria), and hawkweed (Hieracium species). Biosecurity Because of its geographical isolation New Zealand is free of some pest and diseases that are problematic for agricultural production in other countries. With a high level of international trade and large numbers of inbound tourists biosecurity is of great importance since any new pest or diseases brought into the country could potentially have a huge effect on the economy of New Zealand. There have been no outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in New Zealand. If an outbreak did occur there is potential for severe economic losses given that agricultural exports are a large segment of exports.Biosecurity New Zealand Foot and mouth disease New Zealand has strict biosecurityhttp://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/enter measures in place to prevent the introduction of unwanted pests and diseases. In 2017, some cattle near Oamaru in the South Island were found to be Mycoplasma bovis positive, see 2017 Mycoplasma bovis outbreak. Tenure review Many areas of the high country of the South Island were set up as large sheep and cattle stations in the late 19th century. Much of this land was leased from The Crown but after the passing of the Crown Pastoral Land Act 1998 the leases were reviewed. Environmentalists and academics raised concerns about the process saying that farmers were gaining an advantage and that conservation issues were not being resolved. Agricultural and Pastoral Shows A fixture in many rural towns, the annual Agricultural and Pastoral (A&P;) showRoyal Agricultural Society organises competitions for the best livestock and farm produce. Carnivals, sideshows, equestrian events and craft competitions also take place in association with A&P; shows.  Policy, promotion and politics  The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), the government agency responsible for the agricultural sector, has both policy and operational arms. Federated Farmers, a large and influential lobby group, represents farmers' interests. It has a voluntary membership which stands at over 26,000. The Soil & Health Association of New Zealand, established in 1941, promotes organic food and farming. The New Zealand Young Farmers, a national organisation formed in 1927 with regional clubs throughout the country, runs the annual Young Farmer Contest. Irrigation New Zealand, a national body representing farmers who use irrigation as well as the irrigation industry, opposes water conservation orders. Future of New Zealand agriculture There are two main views on the immediate future of New Zealand agriculture. One is that, due to fast-rising consumer demand in India and China, the world is entering a golden age for commodities, and New Zealand is well placed to take advantage of this. The other view is that New Zealand will only gain limited rewards from this boom because of increasing production competition from developing countries. For New Zealand to remain competitive, farmers will either have to intensify production to remain commodity producers (increasing stock and fertiliser per hectare) or, instead, become producers of higher value, more customised products. AgResearch Ltd (New Zealand's largest Crown Research Institute) believes that new technologies will allow New Zealand farmers to double their output by 2020, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and other detrimental environmental impacts associated with farming practices. Impact on New Zealand culture Rural New Zealand has affected the culture of New Zealand. Country Calendar is a factual television programme about farming methods and country life, and is watched by both rural and urban New Zealanders. The show first premièred on 6 March 1966, and is the country's longest-running locally-made television series. The gumboot, a waterproof boot commonly used by farmers and others, is a cultural icon with Taihape hosting an annual Gumboot Day. Fred Dagg, a comedy character created by John Clarke, was a stereotypical farmer wearing a black singlet, shorts and gumboots. Number 8 wire is used for fencing and has become part of the cultural lexicon. It is used for all manner of tasks and it describes the do it yourself mentality of New Zealanders.

It is the premier club competition trophy of the Wellington Rugby Football Union, and the current holders are Tawa, following their 24-20 defeat of Marist St Pats in the 2016 final. Origins and history The Jubilee Cup was first presented for competition in 1929 by the WRFU, honouring the union's 50th Jubilee. The first winners were the Victoria University club, defending the title they won in 1928. Petone are the club with the most Jubilee Cup successes, winning the trophy 22 times, including five consecutive wins from 1967-1971. Two of these titles were shared, with St Pat's Old Boys in 1949 and Wellington in 1982. The next most successful club is Marist St Pats (14 titles since formation in 1971) who can also claim another 6 titles from its predecessor clubs Marist Brothers Old Boys (3 outright, 2 shared) and St Pat's Old Boys (1 shared). Other clubs with five or more titles are Athletic (7 outright, 1 shared), Victoria University (7 outright, 1 shared), Wellington (five outright, two shared), and Poneke (five outright plus another two in amalgamation with Oriental during World War II). By contrast Oriental-Rongotai's 2011 victory was their first outright Wellington title since 1910. Old Boys-University's 2015 success was their first since their 1991 merger, and first for the merger identity since University's last win in 1966. Recent history Between 1993 and 1996 the trophy was rebranded as the Lion Brown Trophy for sponsorship purposes. This also coincided with the introduction of the current finals format. Since then the trophy has been won by Marist St Pats (7), Petone (3), Norths (3) Poneke (2), Hutt Old Boys Marist (2), Tawa (2), Western Suburbs (1), Oriental- Rongotai (1), and Old Boys-University (1). Norths and Marist St Pats also shared the 2008 title after the final finished 10-all and the competition rules did not allow for extra-time to be played, a situation which has since been rectified. Competition format Currently the Jubilee Cup round is the second round of the Wellington competition. The fourteen teams in the Premier competition firstly play the round-robin Swindale Shield competition over 13 rounds, with the top 8 teams moving onto the Jubilee Cup round (the bottom 6 teams are joined by the top 2 eligible teams from the Premier Reserve competition to contest the Hardham Cup). The Jubilee Cup is also contested in a round-robin format, this time over seven rounds, with the top 4 teams progressing to the semi-finals where the top team (since 2009 awarded the Andy Leslie Trophy) hosts the fourth-placed qualifier and second hosts third. The final is then held at usually a neutral venue. Athletic Park hosted the final up to the 1999 decider, since then Westpac Stadium has been the main venue, though recent finals have been held at the Petone Recreation Ground, Hutt Recreation Ground, and Porirua Park.

The fortifications of Kotor (Italian: Fortificazioni di Cattaro) are an integrated historical fortification system that protected the medieval town of Kotor (then called \\"Cattaro la veneziana\\") containing ramparts, towers, citadels, gates, bastions, forts, cisterns, a castle, and ancillary buildings and structures. They incorporate military architecture mainly of Venice, but also a few of Illyria, Byzantium, and Austria. Together with the old town and its natural surroundings the fortifications were inscribed in the list of World Heritage Sites in 1979 labelled Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor and represent the only such site of cultural significance in Montenegro. The fortified city of Kotor was also included in UNESCO's World Heritage Site list as part of Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar in 2017. History The top of the mountain of St.John was already fortified during Illyrian times. In the 6th century the emperor Justinian I reconstructed the fortress. With the retreat of the Byzantines, eventually and in spite of numerous incursions some independence was attained, however this had no lasting effects upon the fortifications. This changed when in 1420 the then independent Republic of Cattaro (one of the neolatin Dalmatian city-states) succumbed to Venetian rule. As part of Albania Veneta the fortifications received their current structure. During this time there were two successful Ottoman sieges followed by occupations, 1538 – 1571 and 1657 – 1699. In 1797 the fortifications passed to the Habsburg Monarchy with the Treaty of Campo Formio. In 1805, Kotor (then named Cattaro) was assigned to the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy by the Treaty of Pressburg, but initially occupied by Russian troops under Dmitry Senyavin until they left after the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807. Three years later it was incorporated into the French Empire's Illyrian Provinces. The fortifications of the city were attacked by the British naval Captain William Hoste with his ship HMS Bacchante (38 guns). In an \\"unmilitary manner\\" he hauled his ships' cannon to positions above the fort using block and tackle and started the shelling.: \\"[Kotor] surrendered on 5 Jan. 1814, as soon as Hoste had, in what was denounced as a 'very unmilitary manner,' established a battery of heavy guns and mortars on the top of a rugged hill which dominated the enemy's position.\\" After a ten-day siege, the French garrison had no alternative and surrendered on 5 January 1814. With the Congress of Vienna Kotor was returned to the Austrian Empire. After their defeat in World War I the Austrians left and the fortress was no longer manned. During World War II Kotor was occupied by the Axis forces and was part of Italy's Governorate of Dalmatia. German troops occupied the city in September 1943: it was liberated on 21 November 1944, a date commemorated over the Sea Gate. Severe earthquakes that damaged the fortifications occurred in 1563, 1667, and most recently, on 15 April 1979. Description The castle St. John (San Giovanni) and the western hillside wall. The medieval part of the town of Kotor is located on a triangular piece of land that is bordered by the most inner extension of the Bay of Kotor at its south-western side, the river Skurda toward the North, and the mountain of St. John (San Giovanni) towards the East. City walls protect the city on its northern and south- western side, towards the waters. The walls are fortified by bastions, most prominent being the Kampana tower and citadel (13th to 14th century) near the point where the river enters the bay. Close to it is the Sea Gate (also Main Gate) from 1555 allowing access from the bay, the two other gates to the city are the River Gate (also North Gate) from 1540 with the nearby Bembo Bastion from 1540 and the Gurdic Gate (also South Gate), the latter modified many times and fortified by the Gurdic Bastion from 1470. The Bembo Bastion has been converted into an open theatre. Two additional gates were present, one walled up south of the Sea Gate, the other, Spiljarskia Gate, within the ramparts of the hillside towards the old road to Cetinje. From the Bembo Bastion and the Gurdic Bastion ramparts climb up to the top of the St. John Mountain that backs the city. The ramparts have positions at various points; within them is a network of communications as well as additional buildings including the Church of Our Lady of Remedy from 1518. On top of the mountain is the San Giovanni castel at a 280-meter height dominating the eastern bay, the fortification system and the city. Behind the castle hill the inhabitable and mountainous countryside further ascends toward the Lovcen. The circumference of the outer wall is 4.5 km, with a thickness between 2 and 16 m, and a height up to 20 m. Preservation The 1979 earthquake damaged much of the buildings in Kotor including the fortifications. The site was placed on the World Heritage List the same year, and also on the List in Danger. After rehabilitation it was taken off the latter in 2003, however, most of the rehabilitation took place in the old town. The fortifications are the most significant aspect of the World Heritage site and while they contain elements of different epochs, it was the Venetians who constructed most of the present structures. As such the monument represents one of the most important examples of defensive Venetian military architecture. The International Council on Monuments and Sites urged in 2001 the revitalization of the fortress. The European Commission took interest in the fortification not only for its cultural significance but also to maintain and develop it as a resource for tourism, a major part of the local economy. It found the fortifications in poor condition. They had been abandoned since the departure of the Austrians in 1918. Lack of maintenance, erosion, earthquakes, and vegetation have contributed to its ongoing deterioration. It was proposed to restore the ramparts of the hillside and the city, and to repair towers and sightseeing points, footpaths and accessory buildings to repair the fortification complex and harness its economic potential.

However, it has changed owners and locations several times, which may invite the claim that it is not \\"continuously operated\\". The bar and restaurant in the Willard InterContinental Washington also lays claim to being the oldest bar and restaurant in the city. However, the original building was torn down and a new one erected on the same lot in 1901, and the hotel was closed from 1968 to 1986. As of 2010, the oldest bar in the city without an ownership change or interruption in service due to location change was Billy Martin's Tavern, which opened in 1933. See: Kelly, John. \\"D.C.'s Oldest Bar, Oldest Hotel? That's a Tricky Question,\\" Washington Post, June 20, 2010. and as of 2012 was owned by Clyde's Restaurant Group. It opened as an unnamed restaurant in the Ebbitt House Hotel. The Hotel distinguished itself as the first hotel in Washington to remain open all summer instead of closing when Congress adjourned. In 1827, the Hotel was razed and rebuilt in the same location. Ebbitt House Hotel was razed in 1925 to make way for the National Press Building, built in 1926. The restaurant was incorporated by Anders Lofstrand, Sr., as a stand-alone business. It moved into new quarters at 1427 F Street NW. After Lofstrand's death in 1955, the restaurant was purchased by Peter Bechas in 1961. The restaurant was sold at a tax sale in June 1970, and was purchased by Clyde's Restaurant Group. The 1427 F Street NW location was demolished in 1983 during redevelopment, and Old Ebbitt Grill moved into its current quarters at 675 15th Street NW. For many years as part of Ebbitt House, the bar/restaurant had no stand-alone name or identity. It began using the name \\"New Ebbitt Café\\" in November 1910. In 1926, after the restaurant became incorporated as a stand-alone business, it was known as both \\"Ebbitt's Grill\\" and \\"Old Ebbitt Grill\\". Over time, only the \\"Old Ebbitt Grill\\" name was used. It retained that name after its ownership changes in 1961 and 1970. Since 1970, because of its popularity Old Ebbitt Grill has been frequented by numerous politicians, some known for scandals and maneuvering. It has also been the site of parties hosted by famous actors and singers. For many years, it has been the restaurant with one of the highest amount of sales in the United States. Old Ebbitt Grill created a popular annual event known as the Oyster Riot in 1995. Ebbitt House: 1856 to 1925 First Ebbitt House The building which later was owned by William E. Ebbitt was located on the southeast corner of F Street NW and 14th Street NW in the city of Washington, D.C. In June 1798, William Crawford obtained title to four parcels of land on the southeast corner of 14th and F streets.Larner, p. 101.At the time, the District of Columbia was not divided into quadrants, and the streets had yet to be described as northwest, southeast, etc. The four parcels lay west-to-east along 14th Street. In 1800, Crawford built two four- story Federal-style houses on the two easternmost parcels of this property.Goode, p. 210. The garden of the houses extended west onto the two empty lots on the corner, and down the hill in the rear almost to Pennsylvania Avenue.Henry, p. 90. In 1833, Bushrod W. Reed relocated to the District of Columbia from Westmoreland County, Virginia, purchased the two easternmost lots from Crawford, and between 1833 and 1836 built a double-wide, four-story, Federal-style building on the corner next to the Crawford homes.Larner, p. 100.Brown, George Rothwell. \\"Ebbitt Hotel, Gone, Had Its Beginning in Boarding House.\\" Washington Post. April 8, 1926. Crawford's daughter, Sarah, married Richard Forrest, one of the first eight clerks appointed in 1801 by Thomas Jefferson in the United States Department of State. William Crawford installed Richard and Sarah Forrest in his houses, and they inherited them upon his death. Richard Forrest died in 1828, and Sarah died in 1832.Barnes, p. 89. Although it is unclear what happened to the property after Sarah Crawford's death, some time prior to 1856 it was purchased by William J. Smith.Larner, p. 101-102. Smith joined the two houses into a single unit, and named them \\"Frenchman's Hotel\\" because he employed a French immigrant as the manager of the facility.Eskew, p. 156. Ebbitt House in 1865, after the Reed and Ebbitt properties were joined In 1856, William E. Ebbitt purchased Frenchman's Hotel from Smith, turned it into a boarding house, and renamed it Ebbitt House. During this time, the boarding house also took in guests from the Willard Hotel.Eskew, p. 170.There was a family connection between Ebbitt House and the Willard Hotel. Richard Forrest's eldest son, Julius, married Sophia Ogle, daughter of Benjamin Ogle. Benjamin Ogle was the maternal grandfather of Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, the man who owned the Willard Hotel. See: Watson, p. 1; Barnes, p. 89. On September 1, 1863, Ebbitt sold the boarding house to his son-in-law, Albert H. Craney.Larner, p. 102. Exactly a year later, Craney sold the property to Caleb C. Willard, brother of Willard Hotel owner Henry A. Willard. Willard converted the boarding house into a hotel. The same year, Willard purchased Bushrod Reed's property as well. He joined the Ebbitt and Reed properties into a single unit enclosing a wide alley between the two and built bathrooms with oval windows in the space above. A three-story house on 14th Street adjacent to Ebbitt House was occupied by the Reed family as well, although by 1864 it had been purchased by Willard, who raised the roof.Larner, p. 102-103. At that time it was not yet part of the hotel; Willard leased the building to the New York Times for use as office space. Two single-story buildings south of the Reed home were also built and owned by Reed. By 1865, they were used as offices by the Philadelphia Inquirer, New York Evening Post, and other newspapers. Next to the one-story buildings was Farnham House. It was originally owned and built by David Burns, whose plantation had covered much of the downtown area that would be developed as Washington, D.C. Burns gave Farnham House to his daughter Marcia, who in turn sold it to William H. Dorsey in 1802. On May 16, 1818, Dorsey sold the house to William Blanchard. Blanchard's daughter, Jane Farnham, inherited the property on June 10, 1850, after his death. By 1865, it housed the D.C. offices of the New York Herald. Given the numerous newspapers with offices along 14th Street between E and F Streets, the area was nicknamed \\"Newspaper Row,\\" a name it would hold into the 1930s.Peck, p. 25-26; Evelyn, Dickson, and Ackerman, p. 74. Farnham sold her house at auction to Caleb Willard on October 4, 1866, for $74,000.Larner, p. 102-103. For many years prior to the construction of the Ebbitt House stables in 1872, a large house known as Bull's Head stood at the rear of the hotel. The house marked the northeast corner of Murder Bay. Bull's Head housed prostitutes and contained a large, lower-class gambling den.\\"Story of Murder Bay.\\" Washington Post. July 8, 1888.Savage, p. 100-101; Gutheim and Lee, p. 73; Lowry, p. 61-65; Evelyn, Dickson, and Ackerman, p. 63-64. Second Ebbitt House Willard razed Ebbitt House in 1872, doubled its size, and built a six-story, Second Empire-style hotel with a mansard roof.\\"Keeping Hotel To- Day.\\" Washington Post. March 6, 1892. The hotel had 300 rooms, canopied windows, and an elevator.Townsend, p. 576. The dining room was two stories high, with floor to ceiling windows, white marble floor, white painted walls, and a fresco on the ceiling.Porteus, p. 41. The dining room was in the rear of the hotel, on the site of what used to be Farnham House, which in photographs from the period shows as the last three windows on 14th Street.Larner, p. 103. The massive chandeliers led the dining room to be called \\"the Crystal Room.\\" The paneled bar was reached by passing through the lobby and down a flight of stairs into the basement.Otero, p. 289. In the late 1800s, this hotel was considered one of the most fashionable in the city; its lodgings and restaurant were patronized by politicians and high-ranking military officers. Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, Commanding General of the United States Army William Tecumseh Sherman, and Rear Admiral Samuel Rhoads Franklin all lived there for a time.Franklin, p. 292-293. It is well-documented that President Ulysses S. Grant and President Andrew Johnson both dined in the restaurant frequently,Zon, p. 5. as did abolitionist clergyman Henry Ward Beecher.Barrows, p. 454. Future president William McKinley and his wife lived there from 1877 to 1890, during his entire congressional career.Hodgson, p. 279. He dined almost nightly with his wife in the restaurant.Corning, p. 138. His close friend, Representative and later President James A. Garfield, visited McKinley often in the hotel.Phillips, p. 26. McKinley departed from the hotel for his presidential inaugural. Presidents Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Warren G. Harding all drank in the bar there. Chief Justice of the United States Salmon P. Chase lived there while working in the capital and died there in October 1886.\\"The Removal of Chief Justice Chase's Body.\\" Washington Post. October 13, 1886. Rear Admiral John Lee Davis also lived and died there.\\"Admiral Davis Dead.\\" Washington Post. March 13, 1889. William Howard Taft lived there from 1890 to 1892 when he was United States Solicitor General. Ebbitt House in 1903. The first two stories of the building in the rear constituted the restaurant. Ebbitt House struggled to compete against the larger and more lavish Willard Hotel, and the Raleigh Hotel, built in 1893.Goode, p. 210, 218. From the late 1860s until the 1910s, it was considered \\"Army and Navy Headquarters\\" because of the number of military personnel who lived there and the large number of veterans' meetings held there.\\"New Manager for Ebbitt.\\" Washington Post. May 17, 1910. In November 1889, Caleb Willard hired Henry C. Burch and Charles E. Gibbs, both veteran hotel managers in the city, to run Ebbitt House.\\"The Ebbitt in New Hands.\\" Washington Post. November 17, 1889.\\"H.C. Burch Dead.\\" New York Times. November 26, 1906. Over the next two years, Burch and Gibbs completely refurnished all the rooms, adding new furniture and Belgian carpets, re-papered or added painted frescoes to the ceilings, and installed new furniture in the hallways. On the east side was the now-famous Red Parlor, a gentleman's lounge fitted with rich red and gold draperies, fabric wall coverings, and upholstered furniture. The restaurant, called \\"cheerful and sunny\\" by the Washington Post, fronted onto 14th Street NW, was lit with crystal chandeliers, and could seat up to 225 people. It was completely remodeled by Burch and Gibbs. Guests dined at tables set with tablecloths imported from Scotland, using Haviland & Co. Limoges porcelain china, silver-handled knives and forks manufactured by Reed & Barton, and Bohemian glassware. Cut-glass flower vases, finger bowls, and water bottles were used for serving. Diners sat in high-backed leather chairs. At breakfast, the waiters wore brown cutaway jackets, vests, and pants with a gold stripe, while in the evening they changed into black tuxedos. The kitchen was renovated. New steam tables and massive coffee urns manufactured by Brambull, Deane & Co. of New York City were installed. The menu — served buffet-style — included Blue Point oysters, green sea turtle, Kennebec River salmon, mutton, chicken, hominy fritters, stewed diamondback terrapin, canvasback duck, English pheasant, and a variety of vegetables, fruits, cheese, crackers, nuts, pies, and puddings. Wines, whiskeys, and brandies were served from two large storerooms.\\"Ebbitt House Changes.\\" Washington Post. November 26, 1891. Despite the success of the changes, Gibbs left Ebbitt House in 1893 after purchasing Wormley's Hotel.Ingham and Feldman, p. 710. Burch became the sole manager of the hotel.\\"Sole Manager of the Ebbitt.\\" Washington Post. October 8, 1893. He conducted extensive renovations to the exterior of the hotel in 1895. An enormous two-story mansard roof, with central and corner pavilions influenced by the French Beaux-Arts movement, was added to the top floor, replacing the original single-story, restrained mansard roof.Goode, p. 211. Ebbitt House slowly declined. In 1907, John Helmus, who oversaw the serving staff and bar for 39 years, died.\\"Hotel Loses Old Employee.\\" Washington Post. October 22, 1907. Caleb Willard, now one of the most famous and wealthiest men in Washington, D.C., died on August 2, 1905.\\"Caleb Willard Dead.\\" Washington Post. August 3, 1905. H.C. Burch died the following year. Willard's estate rented Ebbitt House to George R. Shutt, who had formerly managed the National Hotel at 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW.Goode, p. 202-203. Shutt said it was his intention to move all the stores occupying the 14th Street side of the building to the south side, and to add a large café in its place. He also planned to add a women-only restaurant to the lobby, at a time when many public facilities excluded women.\\"Rents Ebbitt House.\\" Washington Post. August 25, 1909; \\"To Remodel Ebbitt House.\\" Washington Post. September 5, 1909. Lucy Parker Willard, widow of Caleb Willard, died on January 12, 1910.\\"Mrs. Willard Is Dead.\\" Washington Post. January 13, 1910. Shutt took over management of the hotel on May 16, 1910. Shutt's plans had changed somewhat in the intervening nine months. He decided to devote the whole 14th Street side to the restaurant, as well as to renovate the kitchen. A new head chef and assistant chefs had already been hired. The women's café was moved into the basement, where it occupied a portion of the old restaurant. The office space was enlarged. The restrooms were moved into the basement so they could be enlarged with lounges. An air conditioning plant was installed, elevators replaced, sleeping rooms enlarged, and bathrooms added to all sleeping rooms. What was known as the \\"New Ebbitt Café\\" opened in November 1910. It was widely considered the most luxurious restaurant in the city when it opened. The floors were colorful mosaic tiles, the furnishings were expensive, and the café profusely decorated with palms and ferns.\\"Ebbitt Cafe Is Ready.\\" Washington Post. November 24, 1910. Razing of the second Ebbitt House Ebbitt House was razed to construct the National Press Building (depicted). The hotel continued to decline. A fire broke out in the kitchen on August 12, 1913, doing extensive damage. Two fire companies had to respond to the blaze, which did $5,000 worth of damage.\\"Blaze in Ebbitt House.\\" Washington Post. August 13, 1913. Three months later, city officials accused Shutt of selling liquor in the bar to underage children. A jury could not reach agreement on the charges in December 1913,\\"Jury In Ebbitt House Case Fails to Agree.\\" Washington Post. December 13, 1913. but the charges were not dismissed until September 1914.\\"Ebbitt House Case Dropped.\\" Washington Post. September 26, 1914. The renovations were not enough. Shutt died in 1919, and his widow attempted to run the hotel. Mrs. Shutt eventually turned the hotel over to Augustus Gumpert.Whitehead, Frank Insco. \\"Landmark Passes As Ebbitt House Doors Are Closed.\\" Washington Post. May 10, 1925. Prohibition began in the District of Columbia on November 1, 1917. The night before, Ebbitt Grill ran out of liquor by 10:45 P.M. While Prohibition lasted, Ebbitt Grill was known as part of \\"Rum Row\\"—former bars in an area bounded by 13th and 14th streets NW and E and F streets NW which continued to sell alcohol furtively.Zak, Dan. \\"Three Bars With Ties to D.C.'s Prohibition Past.\\" Washington Post. December 7, 2008. In 1923, the Willard estate, which had retained ownership since Lucy Willard's death in 1910, decided to sell the hotel. The new owners refused to renew Gumpert's lease on a yearly basis. They insisted on a month-to-month lease, but Gumpert could not come to agreement with his vendors, who required a yearly lease to ensure a steady stream of income. Gumpert and the new owners both agreed the hotel should close. Ebbitt House and its restaurant were razed in 1926 to make way for the National Press Club building.Reed, p. 100. Ebbitt House closed to the public at noon on Friday, May 1, 1925, and the furnishings were auctioned off on Tuesday, May 5.\\"Ebbitt to Close Friday.\\" Washington Post. April 30, 1925. By this time, the hotel was so run down that the furnishings often went for a fraction of their replacement value, most going for less than a dollar.\\"Ebbitt House Auction Draws Curious Crowd.\\" Washington Post. May 6, 1925. It was not clear if a new Ebbitt House hotel would be built. In July 1925, the Washington Post reported that Gumpert was constructing a new 10-story, 125-room Ebbitt House hotel at 10th and H Streets NW. The old hotel continued to stand, and rumors said the building would be turned into a department store or a movie theater.\\"New Ebbitt Hotel Under Construction.\\" Washington Post. July 26, 1925. However, in November 1925, the owners announced that the building would be razed to make way for the National Press Club Building.\\"Passing of the Ebbitt.\\" Washington Post. November 24, 1925. Demolition of the building began at 1:00 P.M. on January 6, 1926, as National Press Club President Henry L. Sweinhart ceremoniously removed a brick from the existing building.\\"Press Club to Start Ebbitt House Razing.\\" Washington Post. January 6, 1926.

Note the image hanging on the wall on the right, depicting the original 1856 Ebbitt House. The history of the restaurant between its establishment in 1926 and the 1980s is not well documented. The media reported on Old Ebbitt Grill only a few times. For example, after the repeal of Prohibition in the United States, Ebbitt Grill sought a liquor license in May 1934.\\"Special Notices.\\" Washington Post. Mar 20, 1934. Lofstrand years The Ebbitt House bar, its paneling, and decorations were removed before the hotel's demolition and installed at a new location at 1427 F Street NW.

Bechas' ownership of the restaurant was marred by repeated tax problems. Between April 1961 and April 1970, the restaurant paid its sales tax in only six of 105 months. Bechas was successfully prosecuted for failure to pay sales taxes in 1963 and 1966, and was prosecuted again in 1970. The business also failed to deposit withholding taxes on employee wages with the city. The restaurant had little reputation by 1969, and was primarily known for its pork chops, seafood, and steaks, and as one of the few D.C. restaurants to serve dinner until 12:30 A.M.Kramer, Joan. \\"Joining the Night Owls for Dinner.\\" Washington Post.

July 3, 1977. In June 1974, a Washington Post food review declared Old Ebbitt's fare to be \\"American, plain, and not bad\\".\\"Old Ebbitt Grill.\\" Washington Post. June 2, 1974. By 1977, Washington Post food critic Donald Dresden was praising the restaurants bacon cheeseburgers and innovative menu items: \\"Imitators are still trying to top Clyde's and the Ebbitt's bacon cheeseburgers and the disc-shaped deep-fried potatoes that come with—but they'll have to keep trying still.\\" The new owners retained Old Ebbitt's dark paneling, shelves of beer steins, mounted game trophies, and spittoons, which it had long showcased. The decor was made more whimsical, however, leading Washington Post architectural critic Wolf Von Eckardt to declare in 1978 that the Grill was \\"one of the most charming rendezvous on the Eastern Seaboard\\".Von Eckardt, Wolf \\"Big Stakes In a New City Game.\\" Washington Post. March 4, 1978. The restaurant featured bare, unpolished wood flooring throughout, with a fern bar on the second floor. Washington Post reporter Pamela Kessler said in 1981, \\"The restaurant feels like old Philadelphia, rather than a slicker, parvenu Washington\\". Old Ebbitt Grill gained notoriety in 1977 as the location where a Soviet spy ring operated. In 1976, Vladimir I. Alekseyev, a reporter for the Soviet Union's news agency, TASS, contacted United States Information Agency employee Ronald L. Humphrey—who was already acting as a spy for the North Vietnamese government.\\"2 Sentenced to Jail Term As Viet Spies.\\" Associated Press. July 8, 1978. Humphreys had already been identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and was facing prosecution for his actions. Humphrey and his attorney told the FBI about the contact immediately, and Humphrey agreed to act as a double agent. Alekseyev and Humphrey met at Old Ebbitt Grill in December 1976. The United States expelled Alekseyev on February 6, 1977.Dickey, Christopher. \\"Court Told Humphrey Reported Soviet Spy Offer.\\" Washington Post. March 22, 1978. The restaurant continued to improve through the late 1970s and into the early 1980s. In 1978, it was one of the few establishments in Washington, D.C., to serve Guinness Stout on tap.\\"Eateries.\\" Washington Post. October 20, 1978. In 1979, Washington Post restaurant reviewer Lon Tuck noted that Old Ebbitt's Omelet Room was one of the most famous locations in the city.Tuck, Lon. \\"'WWR' and Ford: Celebrating a Union.\\" Washington Post. June 8, 1979. Its trademark omelets were the \\"Old Ebbitt\\", made with sharp cheddar cheese and Bermuda onions, and another made with chili and served with a garden salad with Roquefort blue cheese dressing.Kessler, Pamela. \\"Out to Dinner and a Show.\\" Washington Post. November 27, 1981. Washington Post reporter Pamela Kessler observed in 1981 that its signature dishes included chili, blue cheese and Welsh rarebit hamburgers, quiche Lorraine, a Reuben sandwich, and steaks. Its crab cakes were poorly reviewed as too bland and heavy with bread.Davis, Melissa. \\"Let Them Eat Crab Cakes.\\" Washington Post. September 9, 1979. It was one of the few dining places in the city to stay open until 1:00 A.M. Demolition of 1427 F Street Old Ebbitt Grill was demolished in 1983 during redevelopment of the site. The restaurant was first threatened with demolition in 1962. Around the corner from the restaurant on 15th Street NW and across the street from the U.S. Treasury Building stood the nearly block- long Keith-Albee Building designed by noted architect Jules Henri de Sibour and Rhodes' Tavern, the first polling place in the city, the first city town hall, and the place where citizens of the District of Columbia first petitioned Congress for the right to vote.Goode, p. 196-197. Developer Morris Cafritz, who purchased the Keith-Albee Building and Rhodes' Tavern in 1956, wanted to tear down the entire half-block to construct a new office building.Von Eckardt, Wolf. \\"Treasury's Losing Regal Old Friend.\\" Washington Post. July 22, 1962. He did not proceed at the time, but the threat of demolition was a catalyst to a committee of citizens known as the \\"Landmarks Committee\\" recommending in 1970 that the city enact legislation protecting the two structures and Old Ebbitt Grill.Eisen, Jack. \\"Panel Asks Buildings Be Preserved.\\" Washington Post. November 9, 1970. No legislation was enacted, however. In 1977, developer Oliver T. Carr proposed tearing down the entire block between F and G streets NW and 14th and 15th streets NW and constructing a 12-story hotel and office building complex to be called Metropolitan Square. Demolition would include Old Ebbitt Grill and Rhodes' Tavern. Carr had already negotiated to move the Old Ebbitt Grill to a new location within the new structure.McCombs, Phil and Oman, Anne H. \\"$40 Million Mall Is Planned.\\" Washington Post. November 12, 1977. There was little opposition to the demolition of most of the block, which included the Old Ebbitt Grill site. A series of lawsuits, petitions, and intervention by city and federal officials occurred. As demolition proceeded, Old Ebbitt Grill hosted a large party which won notice in the Washington Post. Attendance was so large, the party spilled out into the street. Music was provided by Federal Jazz Commission, a traditional \\"classic\\" jazz band which made music indoors and out. In February 1980, Carr agreed to preserve the facades of the Keith-Albee and National Metropolitan Bank buildings as part of the Metropolitan Square development.Wheeler, Linda. \\"City Allows Demolition of Historic Tavern.\\" Washington Post. February 12, 1980. Whether the city gave the Oliver T. Carr Co. any financial incentives for saving the facade is in dispute. Joseph N. Grano, Jr., campaign coordinator for the Save Historic Rhodes Tavern Initiative Committee, asserted it did. Robert O. Carr, executive vice president of the Oliver T. Carr Co., asserts it did not. See: Grano, Jr., Joseph N. \\"Rhodes Tavern Should Be Saved.\\" Washington Post. November 3, 1983; Carr, Robert O. \\"Metropolitan Square Should Be Completed.\\" Washington Post. November 3, 1983. In August 1980, Carr announced that Old Ebbitt Grill would reopen in a corner location near to its old 1427 F Street NW spot. The restaurant said it would lease of space on two levels, with the bar, main restaurant, and oyster bar on the main level. Old Ebbitt intended to close its doors in April 1983 and reopen a few weeks later in the new location in May.Bucklin, Randolph E. \\"Old Ebbitt to Be Moved Next Door.\\" Washington Post. August 18, 1982. The time frame for closure proved optimistic. Old Ebbitt Grill did not close its doors at 1427 F Street until September 12, 1983.Weil, Martin. \\"Staff, Patrons Toast Old Ebbitt's Demise As They Await Its Rebirth on 15th Street.\\" Washington Post.

October 21, 2007. Old Ebbitt's famous mahogany bar was not installed in the new location. A replica was crafted instead. The walls were paneled in mahogany and the ceilings decorated with murals and stencils. The restaurant had seating for 200 at tables and in booths. The booths had green leather seats and velvet-covered walls, and were separated from one another by etched glass dividers. The long bar still sported mounted game animal trophies overhead, the fixtures were of marble or brass, and the curtains of lace. An oyster bar was added to the rear of the restaurant on the main floor. The kitchen featured a special charcoal-burning grill, and the wine cellar featured a Cruvinet wine dispensing system.Richman, Phyllis. \\"Old Ebbitt Grill.\\" Washington Post. February 5, 1984.Cruvinet is the name of a company which invented a system for dispensing wine similar to the way beer is dispensed on tap. Cruvinet systems, which can be mobile or installed and can accommodate anywhere from two to 120 bottles, immediately recork a bottle of wine. Nitrogen gas is pumped through a valve in the replacement cork to prevent oxidation. This allows a bottle of wine to remain open for up to two weeks without spoiling. The system was invented in 1978, although many different companies make \\"wine bar systems\\" today. See: Chamberlain, Chris. \\"Cruvinet: It's Like Wine on Tap.\\" Nashville Scene.

A year after the Grill opened, the Washington Post said it had the best dining ambience of any restaurant in the city.\\"Superlatives to Eat By.\\" Washington Post. March 24, 1985. The restaurant also instituted a \\"back waiter\\" system. Back waiters were trained to balance plates of food on their arms, so they could get them to tables faster without the need to load and unload trays. Back waiters were required to have excellent physical strength and good balance. The back waiter system was created so that waiters continued to wait on tables rather than spending time in the kitchen waiting for orders to be filled.\\"Stepping Up to the Plates.\\" Washington Post.

Instead, the basement contained a large private dining room. The new restaurant was immediately popular.Pyatt, Jr., Rudolph A. \\"Can Rhodes Tavern Be Resolved?\\" Washington Post. December 23, 1983. Washington Post food critic Phyllis Richman declared the restaurant's signature hamburger its best entree. She found the appetizers and salads excellent, but considered the pasta dishes hit-or-miss and disparaged the main entrees. Within a year, the restaurant was mostly being patronized by yuppies, lawyers, and tourists.\\"Apres Show: More Food For Thought.\\" Washington Post.

A 1986 food review in the Washington Post concluded that Old Ebbitt Grill had the worst omelets and pancakes in the city, but the best appetizers. Its main claim to fame was its hefty portions and moderate prices. Old Ebbitt Grill was the site of a discussion among administration officials hoping to protect President Reagan from fallout related to the Iran–Contra affair of 1986. Beginning in 1984, officials in the Reagan administration sought to sell conventional weapons to Iran via Israel in exchange for Iran using its influence to win the release of American hostages being held by Hezbollah and other terrorist groups in Lebanon, which was then in the throes of a civil war. In December 1985, Oliver North, a Lieutenant Colonel in the Marine Corps who was serving as a military aide to the National Security Council, proposed selling the weapons directly to Iran at a $15 million mark-up. He would use the excess funds to supply arms and supplies to the Contras. The Contras were guerrilla fighters opposed to the communist government of Nicaragua led by Daniel Ortega. The United States was barred by the Boland Amendment from supporting the Contras. The Iran-Contra affair was exposed by the press on November 3, 1986, and on November 13, President Reagan publicly admitted that an arms-for-hostages deal existed. However, the diversion of funds to the Contras was not yet exposed. On November 22, Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds discovered an April 1986 draft memo from North to National Security Advisor John Poindexter, who was at the time also serving as a Vice Admiral in the United States Navy, which suggested that $12 million in Iranian weapons sales be used to help the Contras. Reynolds discovered the document in North's files during a meeting with North in his White House office. Reynolds smuggled the document out of North's office and took it to a luncheon meeting at Old Ebbitt with Attorney General Edwin Meese. When shown the document, Meese allegedly said, \\"Oh, darn.\\" Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper, a young appointee in the Office of Legal Counsel, also at the lunch, said the memo was a \\"bomb.\\"Pincus, Walter and Morgan, Dan. \\"High-Level Iran Cover-Up Shown in Testimony, Documents.\\" Washington Post.

It lives in sandy coastal soils of the coastal sage scrub ecoregion. It eats seeds and some insects. It was believed to be extinct until 1993, when a small population was discovered. It is now a federally listed Endangered animal species. Physical description The Pacific pocket mice all have different characteristics ranging from the male, female and the baby mice. Since the pocket mice are members on the Heteromyidae, which consists of animals surviving on seeds and grain, they have fur-lined cheek pouches externally.North American Mammals: Perognathuslongimembris Most of the pocket mouse's body is covered in fur that feels silky. The coats of the pocket mice are spineless and bristle free. The color of the Pacific pocket mouse has to do with the environment they live in, hence the color of the soil. The dorsal side of the pocket mouse is usually brown and pinkish while the ventral is usually white. On the pocket mouse, there are typically two patches of hairs that are lighter at the base of the ear. The tail of the pocket mouse can either be distinctly or indistinctly bicolored. The soles of the hind feet are hairy, which are also the distinguishing marks on the Pacific pocket mouse along with the two patches of hair that are lighter at the base of the ear. The young baby of a pocket mouse is called a “pinkie, kitten or pup.” The females are called “does” and the males are called “bucks.”Desert Pocket Mouse (Chaetodipus penicillatus) The pocket mouse group is called a “nest, colony, harvest, horde or mischief.” The skull and hind foot are almost the smallest of all the pocket mouse species. Since the Pacific pocket mice are in the midst of the smallest subspecies of little pocket mice, they range from to in length from the nose to the tip of the tail. The tail of the pocket mouse is . The height of the pocket mouse is .625 inches. The pocket mice weigh usually from 0.25 oz. to 0.33 oz. A pocket mouse can have 8 to 10 pups (baby mice) every year. Habitat and distribution The Pacific pocket mouse is endemic to the immediate coast of southern California from Marina del Rey and El Segundo in Los Angeles County, south to the vicinity of the U.S.-Mexican border in San Diego County. They have not been recorded farther than away from the ocean. They are found in fine-grain or sandy areas that are close to the Pacific Ocean. Their habitat consists of coastal strand, coastal dunes, and coastal sage scrub growing on marine terraces.http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps37166/980928c.pdf General and social behavior The Pacific pocket mouse is the smallest mammal that hibernates. They hibernate during the winter season. During hibernation they feed on seed caches that are stored in their burrows. They eat the seeds of grasses and forbes, and they also eat leafy material. A Pacific pocket mouse lives around seven years in captivity and about three to five years in the wild. Pacific pocket mice normally only interact with their own species. Interactions are experienced within their own habitat. When they are not interacting with one another they are escaping predators that roam their habitat. Predators such as a gray fox and feral or domestic cats threaten the survival of the Pacific pocket mouse. Along with trying to avoid such predators they are also in danger because of the exotic Argentine ants. These ants invade the coastal sage scrub areas of the Pacific pocket mouse's habitat. The Pacific pocket mouse has been on the endangered species list since 1994.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0193-7723_ITM Reproduction Like other heteromyids, the Perognathus longimembris pacificus (Pacific pocket mouse) is generally asocial and solitary. Other than during reproduction, they do not engage in direct social interactions often. There is relatively little information on the breeding biology of the Pacific pocket mouse. The Pacific pocket mouse does not reproduce offspring in large quantities or at a high speed. Most females typically produce one litter per year, sizing from about two to eight pups; occasionally, females may produce two litters in one year.Friends of the Santa Margarita River: Table of Contents Generally, the breeding season for the Pacific pocket mouse is the months April through July, peaking in the spring. But, the breeding season can vary due to a few factors. The temperature, amount of food available, and the quantity of plant growth around the Pacific pocket mouse's habitat can all affect its breeding season. In years with lower than average rainfall, reproduction may not take place. The gestation period for the Pacific pocket mouse lasts for twenty-two to twenty-three days. Newly born mice are smaller than one inch long and weigh less than one gram. As a mammal, the first thing Pacific pocket mouse subsists on is its mother's milk. Young are weaned after approximately thirty days. The Pacific pocket mouse attains sexual maturity two to five months after birth, but a small number of young may be able to breed less than a month after weaning. In the wild, the Pacific pocket mouse lives about three to five years. The life span of a Pacific pocket mouse is sporadic because of their vulnerability in their own habitat. The Pacific pocket mouse is very simple. They stay within the habitat of their birth and feed on simple vegetation that are available within their surroundings. In captivity, its longevity increases to approximately four to six years, no longer than seven and one-half years. In captivity, Pacific pocket mice are able to breed and reproduce more times than in the wild. Feeding behavior The Pacific pocket mouse's diet consists of seeds, nuts, and green vegetation, when available.3 Mouse, Pacific pocket (Perognathus longimembris pacificus) These granivores will leave the burrow at night to gather the seeds, in order to avoid direct contact with the desert sun. Most of these seeds and vegetation can be found in bushes or small shrubbery close to the burrow. When seeds are not easily accessible, the mouse will use its forelimbs to dig holes in order to find resources. Due to the harsh climate, many pocket mice are susceptible to droughts, heat, and extreme temperature changes that can happen within the day. It can live for long periods of time without water by using the moisture from its food and digestive system.Mouse, Pacific pocket (Perognathus longimembris pacificus) A pocket mouse is highly influenced when seeking its food. Many foraging factors play a part in a pocket mouse's dietary needs. These factors can range from: 1\\\\. Seed size: The size of the seed can determine how filling it will be. 2\\\\. Density of food supply: This aspect can determine if a pocket mouse will have enough resources available within a certain distance of its burrow. 3\\\\. Nutritional value: This determines if the food is healthy and adequate enough to last through harsh environmental changes. 4\\\\. Predation Risk: Pocket mice living in highly vulnerable predator areas are less likely to scavenge for food and must do so with caution. 5\\\\. Type of soil: If the soil is too hard, pocket mice must find other means of obtaining their food. When a pocket mouse has found sufficient seeds, it will begin to store these resources in its fur-lined cheeks. These pockets can vary in length from three inches (76 mm) to twelve. The sizes of the pockets are determined by the ratio of body length and jumping span. These pockets aid the mouse by trimming the amount of time and energy needed to scavenge over a period of time. Its pouches also allow the mouse to survive when there is limited food or predation risk. Once the pocket mouse has filled its cheeks with the seeds, it will scurry down into its burrow to unload its provisions. These seeds are then stored in certain compartments within its burrow. When the time comes, these seeds will be taken out of storage and used as food for the pocket mouse. If supplies are low, a pocket mouse will leave the burrow to refill its supply. Also, during the spring and autumn months, pocket mice will forage more often in order to prepare for the coming of summer and winter when it will be harder to find food. Endangered species and conservation efforts Perognathus longimembris pacificus (Pacific pocket mouse) was believed to be extinct for nearly 20 years until it was rediscovered in 1993. It was immediately placed on emergency listings by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and received full protection status in 1994. In September 1997 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a recovery plan for the Pacific pocket mouse with the intent of down listing its status to threatened by the year 2023. Currently it is estimated that there are only 150 Pacific pocket mice left in existence. In attempts to conserve the Pacific pocket mouse the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is focusing its efforts on stabilizing current populations, searching for new populations, and establishing additional populations by means of the release of captive-bred individuals. Their goal is to protect the Pacific pocket mouse until it is no longer necessary. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in San Diego and the city of Dana Point have expressed deep concern for the protection of the Pacific pocket mouse. The United States Marine Corps has authorized the relocation of the Pacific pocket mouse to off-base sites in order to create new populations. The Dana Point City Council unanimously supported a residential development proposal that would give the Pacific pocket mouse in the Dana Point Headlands in 1998.http://documents.coastal.ca.gov/reports/2007/10/Th19-10-2007-a2.pdf They also decided that the Dana Point Headlands Pacific pocket mouse property would be privately owned. It is the intention of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance with the U.S. Marine Corps and the city of Dana Point to relocate the Pacific pocket mouse out of MCB Camp Pendleton and into the Dana Point Headlands. In 2010, as part of a U.S.G.S. project at Camp Pendleton, scat detection dogs from Conservation Canines were used to locate Pacific pocket mice. They discovered a 5-fold increase in occupied habitat.http://www.werc.usgs.gov/Project.aspx?ProjectID=116 Threats to species The principal threats to the species and the cause of its present reduced state are habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. These threats are due to different kinds of area development such as urban, agricultural, residential, and recreational. Other threats include ground disturbances or vegetation removal from grading, ripping, or off-road driving. Impacts from construction of roads, railroads, airports and other structures also impact the survival of the Pacific pocket mouse. The loss of groundwater and or blow-sand necessary for habitat maintenance is significant to this species' survival. Because this mouse is an sensitive species, factors such as illegal trash dumping, invasive species, domestic animal predators, vehicular roadway threats, and inadequate regulatory mechanisms affect the species' well being, not to mention the elevated extinction risks that can play a common role on greatly reduced populations. There are five factors that figure into whether or not a species may be determined endangered or threatened. One of those factors is the present or threatened destruction, modification and curtailment of its habitat or range. This is recognized as a form of destruction, modification and curtailment of Pacific pocket mouse habitat and range. This was a major factor in affording it endangered status. Both physical and biological features figure into an organism's critical habitat. In the case of the Pacific pocket mouse, its physical requirements are sandy loamy soil and its biological requirements are a suite of plant communities including coastal sage scrub and grassland. Due to interaction of demographic, genetic, and environment factors, small populations are more susceptible to extinction than larger populations. In addition to the ongoing threats to its habitat, several development projects are proposed or approved within core habitat areas.

Several years later Hellingly moved cricket grounds around the village until in 1953 a new cricket pitch was laid and a pavilion was erected back at Horsebridge Recreation Ground. 1972 saw six local clubs get together to form the East Sussex Cricket League. Hellingly in 1975 were the tenth team to join the league. Today the league has grown and now has twelve divisions with over 110 teams playing in it. In 2007, Hellingly made the decision to join the Sussex Cricket League, and 2008 saw them join the new 'Division 3 East' of the league. Grounds and Facilities The Club plays its home games at Horsebridge Recreation Ground and Ninfield. Ninfield is used for third and fourth eleven games, and Horsebridge is used for all other home matches. Horsebridge Recreation ground has a bar and Clubhouse, four sight-screens, two permanent nets as well as a roller net.

In 1977 the Swedish government-owned company Telub was contacted by a representative of the Libyan military who wanted to explore the possibilities to buy education for a group of Libyan military students. The education was in the field of telecommunication techniques and engineering. Telub won the contract in fierce competition with other European companies, and in March 1979 the contract between Telub and the Libyan military was signed. The 96 Libyan students arrived in Sweden in March 1980. The case became heated when the newspaper Expressen in an article described the group of Libyan students as future terrorists. One of the strongest critics was Olle Wästberg, an MP for the People's Party, who described them as agents of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In January 1981 it was revealed that the technical education also had some military fields of use. While there was no legal ground to force Telub to cancel its education, the pressure on the company eventually became so hard that the Libyan students had to leave Sweden. A German company then overtook the contract. The case was reviewed by the parliamentary Committee on the Constitution. The committee criticised Minister for Trade Staffan Burenstam Linder for his handling of the case. However, Minister for Foreign Affairs Karin Söder and Minister for Defence Eric Krönmark were not criticised since the Communist Party laid down their votes in those cases. The Swedish government also started an official investigation, which published its report in 1981.

After being originally patented as a liquid crystal for LCDs, it was developed by the pharmaceutical company Novartis in the late 1990s. It was found to produce neuroprotective effects following acute brain injury in animal studies, although it was unclear whether these results were purely from mGluR5 blockade as it also acts as a weak NMDA antagonist, and as a positive allosteric modulator of another subtype mGlu4, and there is also evidence for a functional interaction between mGluR5 and NMDA receptors in the same populations of neurons. It was also shown to produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animals, and to reduce the effects of morphine withdrawal, most likely due to direct interaction between mGluR5 and the μ-opioid receptor. The main significance of MPEP has been as a lead compound to develop more potent and selective mGluR5 antagonists such as MTEP, but research using MPEP itself continues, and recently it was shown to reduce self-administration of nicotine, cocaine, ketamine and heroin in animals, possibly through an MPEP-induced potentiation of the rewarding effect of the self-administered drug, and MPEP was also shown to possess weak reinforcing effects by itself.

She was encouraged to create art in her childhood.Ella Sophonisba Hergesheimer. Johnson Collection. Retrieved August 20, 2014. Hergesheimer was the great-great granddaughter of Philadelphia artist Charles Willson Peale, who named one of his daughters Sophonisba after the Italian artist, Sofonisba Anguissola. Hergesheimer chose to use Sophonisba as her first name. Education She studied at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women for two years, and then went on to study at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts for four years. At the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, she studied with Cecilia Beaux, Hugh Breckenridge, and William Merritt Chase. She was considered by Chase to be one of his finest students, and spent the summer of 1900 studying at Chase's Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art on Long Island. As a senior at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, she was judged the best pupil in her class and was awarded the Cresson Traveling Scholarship. This allowed her to study abroad in Europe for three years, where she trained at the Académie Colarossi and exhibited at the Paris Salon. She is listed among the students of Blanche Lazzell, who was known for her white-line color woodcuts. Doll, Susan M. (2004), \\"Blanche Lazzell Biography\\", Blanche Lazzell: The Life and Work of an American Modernist, Morgantown: West Virginia University Press Career As a result of having her work including in a 1905 traveling exhibition organized by the Nashville Art Association, she received a commission in 1907 to paint the portrait of Holland Nimmons McTyeire, the Methodist bishop who convinced Cornelius Vanderbilt to endow Vanderbilt University. To work on the commission, she relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, where she remained the rest of her life - first occupying a studio on Church Street, and later one at Eighth Avenue and Broadway. She spoke fondly of the region and its residents, stating: \\"The country around Nashville is, some of it, the most beautiful I have ever seen––a large and bounteous field for the landscape painter. There are hosts of beautiful women and children and strong, fine men to inspire great portraits.\\" She also conducted art classes in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where her circle of friends included fellow artists Frances Fowler, Sarah Peyton, and Wickliffe Covington. She also maintained a lifelong friendship with landscape painter Orlando Gray Wales, who also was raised in Allentown and also studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Hergesheimer's most notable portraits are those of Speaker of the House Joseph W. Byrns, Sr., which hangs in the United States Capitol building, and of Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury, which hangs in Maury Hall at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Though portraiture was her primary source of income, Hergesheimer experimented in other painting genres and artistic techniques, including printmaking, which she pursued alongside the artist Blanche Lazzell.

The building has a tall, curving frontage which overlooks Blackfriars Bridge on the north bank of the River Thames. The site of Unilever House was previously occupied by Bridewell Palace, a residence of Henry VIII, which later became a poorhouse and prison. These buildings were destroyed in 1864 making way for De Keyser's Royal Hotel.De Keyser's Royal Hotel, Victoria Embankment, London In 1920, Lord Leverhulme leased the site to build the London headquarters of his soap manufacturing company Lever Brothers, which became Unilever in 1930. Construction did not commence until 1929. Design and construction The design was a collaboration between James Lomax-Simpson, the Unilever company architect and a member of its board, and John James Burnet and Thomas S. Tait, partners in the firm of Sir John Burnet and Partners. However, there has been much confusion over the relative contributions of these architects. A note by Simpson claimed exclusive credit, suggesting that Burnet and Tait merely approved the final design; but Burnet and Tait exhibited the design as a joint work with Simpson at the Royal Academy; and drawings held at London Metropolitan Archives are signed by Burnet and Tait alone. Burnet was on the point of retiring owing to ill health; while Tait was a leading proponent of modern architecture, little of which is evident in the final design. The conclusion of Clive Aslet is that Lomax-Simpson was responsible for the overall concept (an early drawing by him dated October 1929 depicts the frontage very much as built); while Burnet and Tait were invited to become involved because of the prestige of their practice's name, but contributed only details.Aslet 1981. The main contractor for the construction was Holland, Hannen & Cubitts. Architecture The most striking aspect of the building is its enormous curving frontage along the Victoria Embankment, with its giant Ionic columns between the fourth and sixth floors. The heavily rusticated ground floor is windowless to reduce traffic noise inside the building. The corners are marked by entrances surmounted by large plinths on which are placed sculptures of human figures restraining horses (called Controlled EnergyPhilip Ward-Jackson: Public Sculpture of the City of London (Public Sculpture of Britain).

Written by James Berg and Stan Zimmerman and directed by Philip Charles MacKenzie. It follows lead character Roseanne Conner on her visit to a gay bar. \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" originally aired on March 1, 1994. \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" generated enormous controversy before it aired because it included a same-sex kiss between Roseanne and Sharon, played by guest star Mariel Hemingway. ABC initially planned not to air the episode. The network eventually relented and the episode was viewed by an audience of some 30 million people. \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" was an early entry on a list of American television episodes in which a lesbian or possibly lesbian character kisses a straight-identifying character. These lesbian kiss episodes often occurred during times of the year when networks were most concerned about generating ratings, and have come to be viewed by some critics as gimmicks to help secure those ratings. Plot To prove that she's cool, Roseanne Conner (Roseanne Barr) goes out dancing at a gay bar called \\"Lips\\" with her sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) and friend Nancy (Sandra Bernhard) and Nancy's girlfriend Sharon (Mariel Hemingway). Roseanne is having fun until Sharon kisses her, causing Roseanne anxiety. The next day, after discussing the kiss with Jackie and getting into an argument with Nancy, Roseanne realizes that she may not be as cool as she thinks she is. Reception and controversy ABC, fearing viewer and sponsor backlash, initially planned not to air the episode. Roseanne executive producer Tom Arnold went public with the network's decision in an interview with Variety. Arnold stated that he was told by network executives that \\"a woman cannot kiss a woman. It is bad for the kids to see.\\"Gross, p. 89 and that the network stood to lose up to $1 million in advertising revenue. In response, Barr threatened to move her series, then one of the most popular on television, to another network. LGBT media watchdogs the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation urged ABC to air the kiss uncensored, while the conservative Media Research Center declared the episode an insult to American families. ABC eventually relented and not only aired \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" uncensored, but began specifically promoting it as \\"the lesbian kiss episode\\".Gross, p. 90 The network did, however, place a parental advisory warning on the episode. At least one sponsor, Kraft Foods, sent out a memo to network affiliates and local advertising agencies ordering that no ads for its products run during the episode, a move that Out magazine's then-publisher Michael Goff said was motivated by \\"their fear from dealing with America as it is\\". Barr spoke about the controversy the week before the episode aired, questioning network standards that deem it \\"shocking to see a woman kiss another woman but not shocking to see a woman raped, mutilated and shot every two seconds\\". Television critic Frank Rich of The New York Times called \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" \\"a small step forward for the stirring of homosexuals into the American melting pot\\" and a \\"sophisticated half-hour [that] turned homophobia on its ear\\". \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" scored 30 million viewers upon first airing.Semonche, p. 208 Approximately 100 telephone calls came in to ABC in response to the episode, with most of them being positive. Writers Stan Zimmerman and Jim Berg were nominated for a Writers Guild of America award for their work on the episode. Roseanne was one of the first American television series to feature an intimate kiss between two women. Three years earlier, L.A. Law had aired an episode that included a kiss between bisexual-identified character C.J. Lamb (Amanda Donohoe) and straight-identifying Abby Perkins (Michele Greene). The kiss led to complaints to the network and five sponsors pulled their ads from the episode. In reviewing incidents of lesbian kisses on network television programs, The New York Times noted that they tended to happen during \\"sweeps\\" periods, when the networks use Nielsen ratings to determine advertising rates. Noting lesbian kisses during sweeps periods on such shows as L.A. Law, Picket Fences, Party of Five and Ally McBeal in addition to the Roseanne episode and noting that they occur about once per year, the Times concludes that kisses between women are: > \\"Eminently visual; cheap, provided the actors are willing; controversial, > year in and year out; and elegantly reversible (sweeps lesbians typically > vanish or go straight when the week's over), kisses between women are > perfect sweeps stunts. They offer something for everyone, from advocacy > groups looking for role models to indignation-seeking conservatives, from > goggle-eyed male viewers to progressive female ones, from tyrants who demand > psychological complexity to plot buffs.\\" Michele Greene confirmed in an interview with AfterEllen.com that her kiss with Amanda Donohoe's C.J. was a ratings ploy and that there was never any intention on the part of producers to seriously explore the possibility of a relationship between two women. During a period in network television history when producers were pushing the broadcast boundaries on sexually explicit content with such shows as NYPD Blue, the controversy over this and other television episodes that made inroads into presenting same-sex sexuality or affection led producers not to present any sexualization of their gay and lesbian characters. > \\"So viewers got to see Carol and Susan wed on Friends, but they didn't get > to see them kiss. And fans of NYPD Blue could hear male hustlers talk about > their johns, but the only sex they got to see involved the precinct's > straight cops—naked butts and all. Clearly, chastity was the price gay > characters paid for admission to prime-time television in the 1990s.\\"Becker, > p. 179 Mariel Hemingway reprised her role as Sharon in the 1995 episode \\"December Bride\\", in which long-time character Leon (Martin Mull) marries his boyfriend Scott (Fred Willard). Roseanne's husband Dan (John Goodman) is distressed at seeing two men kiss and Roseanne chastises him for making a fuss about two people of the same sex kissing. Sharon then sits down behind Roseanne and says hi. Her cameo serves as a callback to this episode and the controversy it engendered. Hemingway had also playfully made light of the controversy outside of Roseanne: on September 30, 1995, during her opening monologue while hosting the season premiere of Saturday Night Live, she took viewers on an introductory backstage tour of the show - which had been recast and re-branded over the summer - in which she kissed all three female cast members and director Beth McCarthy.Saturday Night Live transcript: Mariel Hemingway Notes References *Becker, Ron (2006).

Watauga's powerhouse is located nearly a mile downstream from the dam, and is connected to the reservoir intake by a tunnel. Just above the powerhouse, the tunnel splits into two steel conduits that carry the water to a valve house just above the turbines. Background and construction Watauga Dam, (from upstream), circa 1950. The hydroelectric potential of the Watauga River had been recognized since the early 1900s, when the Watauga Power Company built Wilbur Dam downstream from the modern Watauga Dam site. In the 1920s, the Holston River Power Company began making plans for a large-scale dam-building project in the South Fork Holston River watershed, and had identified two possible dam sites along the Watauga, one of which was the current site of Watauga Dam (the company called it the \\"Cardens Bluff\\" site). In the early 1940s, the Tennessee Valley Authority-- which had assumed oversight of flood control operations in the Tennessee River watershed in the previous decade, suggested a dam at the Cardens Bluff site to provide badly needed flood storage and help with the region's World War II energy demands. The dam project garnered widespread local support, especially from Elizabethton, which had been ravaged by a flood in 1940. The Watauga project was authorized December 17, 1941, and work on the dam began on February 16, 1942. Construction work at the Watauga Dam site, circa 1940s The construction of Watauga Dam and its reservoir required the purchase of of land, of which had to be cleared. 761 families, 1,281 graves, and of roads had to be relocated, and three new bridges were built. Wilbur Dam, located just downstream, had to be raised and outfitted with a new spillway. The town of Butler had to be moved. In October 1942, the U.S. War Production Board ordered TVA to halt the Watauga project, deeming it unnecessary for the nation's wartime needs. TVA spent several weeks securing the dam site and tunnel, and the project was set aside until the end of the war. Construction proceeded on May 22, 1946. Watauga Dam was completed and its gates opened December 1, 1948. The dam's first generator went online August 30, 1949, and the second went online September 29, 1949. The total cost of the Watauga project was just over $32 million.

Богословие святого Максима Исповедника / 4.2 Тропос существования и энергия природы / 4.2.6 Теория волевого акта: воля природная и воля гномическая / p. 395 Overview This notion belongs of St Maximus the Confessor. The term 'gnomic' derives from the Greek gnome, meaning 'inclination' or 'intention'. Within Orthodox theology, gnomic willing is contrasted with natural willing. Natural willing designates the movement of a creature in accordance with the principle (logos ()) of its nature towards the fulfilment (telos (), stasis ()) of its being. Gnomic willing, on the other hand, designates that form of willing in which a person engages in a process of deliberation culminating in a decision. Within the theology of St Maximus, which was endorsed by the Sixth Ecumenical Council in condemning monothelitism, Jesus Christ possessed no gnomic will. St Maximus developed this claim particularly in his Dialogue with Pyrrhus. According to St Maximus, the process of gnomic willing presupposes that a person does not know what they want, and so must deliberate and choose between a range of choices. However, Jesus Christ, as both man and the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, possessed complete congruence of His two wills, the divine and the human. Therefore, St Maximus reasoned, Christ was never in a state of ignorance regarding what he wanted, and so never engaged in gnomic willing. Aristotle, a major philosophical influence on Maximus, in comparing the works of Nature with those of a human worker, had also declared that any process of deliberation, far from indicating superior intellect, is a sign of our weakness.

The band split in 1993 after its members decided amicably to move on to other projects. Members went on to play in groups such as Antioch Arrow, Clikatat Ikatowi, and Second Story Window; vocalist Matt Anderson also worked with A Minor Forest, Mohinder, and Angel Hair. Matt and Scott even played in the legendary San Diego punk/hardcore band, Battalion of Saints from 2005-2008. Posthumous legacy Though the group was active for only four years and received little attention during the band's actual lifespan, the release of the Gravity compilation, as well as later accolades, resulted in their receiving considerable posthumous acclaim. Geoff Rickly, lead singer of Thursday, named Heroin as one of his major influences. Allmusic called the group \\"one of the defining innovators in early '90s hardcore\\". In 2008, Alternative Press named Heroin as a group of significant interest in its profile of \\"23 Bands who Shaped Punk\\", writing that \\"Heroin never received overdue credit for inspiring the aesthetic that Story of the Year, From First to Last and others eventually took to the bank.\\" Emo subculture and history website Fourfa describes Heroin's self-titled LP as \\"A wall of furious, chaotic noise, vocal-chord-shredding screaming, lyrics of ultimate disillusionment and pain, and just the right amount of melody to pull things together without interrupting the flow of angst.\\"Fourfa's Hardcore Emo Top Ten Members * Matt Anderson - vocals.

Its headquarters are in Ottawa.\\"Contact the NDEB.\\" National Dental Examining Board of Canada. Retrieved on December 23, 2011. \\"Address: 80 Elgin Street, 2nd Floor, Ottawa ON CANADA K1P 6R2\\" - Address in French: \\"80 rue Elgin, 2e étage, Ottawa ON K1P 6R2 CANADA\\" According to the Act of Parliament, the NDEB is responsible for the establishment of qualifying conditions for a national standard of dental competence for general practitioners, for establishing and maintaining an examination facility to test for this national standard of dental competence and for issuing certificates to dentists who successfully meet this national standard. The NDEB, in cooperation with the Royal College of Dentists of Canada, is also responsible for the establishment of qualifying conditions for a single standard national certificate for dental specialties. History In 1906 under the auspices of The Canadian Dental Association (CDA) the Dominion Dental Council was formed to conduct national written examinations, the successful completion of which would grant the candidate a Dominion Dental Council certificate. The National Certificate could then be presented to the Provincial Dental Regulatory Authorities (DRA's) as evidence of the candidate's ability to meet a basic national standard of competence. Some DRA's were prepared to grant licenses to practice on the basis of the certificate, however, others chose to accept the certificate as an academic base only and required the candidate to pass provincial practical tests in addition. The Dominion Dental Council proved to be rather ineffective. A name change to The Dental Council of Canada in 1950 along with attempts to improve the efficiency of the examination mechanism still failed to attract strong support from the DRA's. This was in spite of the fact that the DRA's agreed with the general concept. They had indicated a desire to be free of provincial licensing examinations, providing that a strong competent national examination system could be introduced, which they could support. The following year (1951) the CDA encouraged the ten DRA's to meet in an attempt to develop a satisfactory plan for a National Examining Board. Its purpose was to provide a facility by which members of the profession could become eligible, on a national basis, to apply for practice privileges in the province of their choice. This meeting resulted in the incorporation of The National Dental Examining Board of Canada (NDEB) in 1952 by an Act of Parliament of Canada. The Act was supported by all ten DRA's and by the CDA and this support continues today. Since 1952, the NDEB has issued 21,907 certificates. Structure The National Dental Examining Board of Canada is composed of twelve members. Each DRA appoints one member and two members are appointed by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada. In 1994, the Board designated representatives from the Royal College of Dentists of Canada, the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada, the Canadian Dental Association and the CDA Committee on Student Affairs as official observers. In 2004, the Board designated a representative from the Canadian Dental Regulatory Authorities Federation (CDRAF)as an official observer and appointed a Public Representative. The Executive Committee of the Board, consisting of the President, President-Elect, Past-President and two other members, meets two or three times a year. The full Board meets annually. The NDEB also has standing committees dealing with examinations, appeals, finances and by-laws. The NDEB appoints a Chief Examiner for the examinations. Examiners are appointed by the Board from lists submitted by the DRA's and lists submitted by the Deans of Canadian dental faculties. The NDEB is a non-profit organization supported financially by fees charged to candidates for examination certification. Certification Prior to 1971, a graduate of an undergraduate dental program in Canada was required to successfully complete the NDEB examination (written essay-type) in order to be certified. This policy was changed in 1971, when the NDEB decided to recognize the examinations and evaluation administered by Canadian faculties of dentistry and issue certificates to current graduates of these faculties without further examination. The conditions for certification of current graduates were established at this time to be proper application and graduation from an undergraduate dental program approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada. The NDEB, through its representatives on the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada and an appointee on each undergraduate program survey team actively participates in the accreditation process. In addition, the NDEB gives an annual grant to the Commission to be applied to accreditation costs of undergraduate dental programs in Canada and the United States. In 1988 concern was expressed by several DRA's about the validity of establishing clinical competence solely by accreditation. This concern was further intensified by the extension of the accreditation cycle from five to seven years. The NDEB, therefore, in 1989 established a committee \\"to explore whether the granting of a certificate on the basis of accreditation alone continues to be acceptable.\\" This committee (Certification Review Committee or CRC) presented its report at the 1990 NDEB Annual Meeting. The report stated that certification based on accreditation alone was no longer acceptable, a finding which was further supported in the Parker Report. As a result, the NDEB authorized two pilot projects which introduced and tested the use of NDEB external examiners/observers. In 1991 this involved the University of British Columbia, l’Université de Montréal and the University of Toronto. In 1992, the Universities of Alberta, Manitoba, McGill, Western Ontario and l’Université de Montréal participated in this pilot project. The pilot projects were deemed highly satisfactory by the NDEB. In 1993, certification for graduates of accredited Canadian Faculties of dentistry was based on present requirements and a successful report on the faculties’ participation in the NDEB External Examiner System. In 1994, at the request of the DRA's, the NDEB abandoned the External Examiner System and required that Canadian graduates pass the Written Examination. The NDEB committed to develop and implement an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). As a result of changes adopted at the 1993 Annual Meeting, in 1995 and onwards, graduates of dental programs accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada were required to pass both the NDEB Written Examination and the NDEB Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) in order to be certified. In 1995 and 1996 an intense and lengthy consultation process with the DRA's, the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada (CDAC), the Association of Canadian Faculties of Dentistry (ACFD), the American Association of Dental Schools (AADS) and the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association (ADA) was held. As a result, a Notice of Motion was presented to the 1995 Annual Meeting that would significantly change the Board's certification process. This Notice of Motion was circulated to the communities of interest and as a result, was revised, outlining conditions that required action by the ADA, the ACFD and the CDAC. In addition, to preserve national portability, the motion had to be ratified by all ten DRA's. During 1996, the ADA, CDAC and ACFD confirmed that the required changes would be made. The motion was subsequently passed by the NDEB at the November 1996 Annual Meeting and was ratified by all ten DRA's. As a result of the ADA Commission on Dental Accreditation making requested changes to their accreditation procedures, including the addition of state and national licensing board representatives to all site survey teams, the codification of the relationship between the ADA Commission on Dental Accreditation and the CDAC that ensures formal representation and involvement in each other's process, the identification of the requested outcome measurement similar to the CDAC's the Clinical Outcomes Review (CORE) Process. The NDEB was able to verify that the CDAC and the ADA accreditation processes were equivalent. Therefore, as of January 1, 1997, graduates of both US and Canadian accredited undergraduate dental programs were considered “accredited graduates”. To be certified, these graduates must pass the Written and OSCE Examinations within a specified period of time. Until December 31, 1999, graduates of accredited programs who did not successfully complete the Written and OSCE Examinations within 7 years of graduation were granted a certificate by the Board following successful completion of the Examination for Certification of graduates of non-accredited dental programs established by the Board. After January 1, 2000, graduates of accredited dental programs who do not successfully complete the Written and OSCE Examinations within 7 years of graduation were eligible to receive the Board's certificate by successfully completing a Qualifying Program and then successfully completing the Written and OSCE Examinations. As a result of wide consultation during a Strategic Planning process in 2003, the Board revised the “7 year rule” and allowed graduates of accredited programs who were more than 60 months past the date of their graduation to apply for special consideration to participate in the Board's certification process. Also, in 2003, the Board placed a limit on the number of times a candidate could take an examination and added a public official observer. Since the changes to the certification process for graduates of non-accredited dental programs in 1996, the Executive Committee of the National Dental Examining Board of Canada (NDEB) has been continually monitoring the results. The 1996 changes introduced the 2 year Qualifying/Degree Completion Programs. The Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada's (CDAC) Standards for the Qualifying/Degree Completion Programs initially required that these programs be two academic years in length. Presently, these are approximately 80 students accepted into these programs each year. These programs work extremely well, faculties report that virtually every student requires the full 2 years in the programs to meet the national standard. However, it has been reported that there have been a few students who may not have needed the full 2 years. In 2001, to provide more flexibility, the NDEB and the Canadian Dental Regulatory Authority Federation (CDRAF) requested the CDAC change the standards to allow a student to demonstrate competence in a shorter time. Although CDAC modified the standards, the Qualifying Programs find it difficult to satisfactorily evaluate students until they have almost completed the programs. In addition, as of 2006, all Faculties of Dentistry in Canada have moved to Degree Completion Programs which, due to university regulation, have 2-year residency requirements. Currently, the CDRAF has initiated a certification process for graduates of non-accredited dental specialty programs, and several Provincial Dental Regulatory Authorities (DRA's) have indicated the need to develop an alternative process for certification of general dentists. Structure of Examination Written Examination The Written Examination consists of 2 papers, each with 150 multiple choice type questions. Each paper is given in a 2 hours and thirty minutes examination session. The sessions are held in the morning and afternoon of one day. One part of the written examination tests the basic sciences while the other tests the clinical sciences. The basic sciences portion resembles Part I of the National Board Dental Examination in the United States, while the clinical portion is similar to Part II. Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) The OSCE is a station type examination (also known as \\"bell-ringer\\" type). The majority of the stations have two questions and require the candidate to review the information supplied (e.g. case history, photographs, radiographs, casts, models) and answer extended match type questions. Each extended match type question has up to 15 answer options and one or more correct answer(s). A few stations may require the candidate to review the information supplied and write an acceptable prescription for a medication commonly prescribed by general dentists in Canada. Candidates have five minutes at each station to answer the questions, after which they move on to the next station. Current Exam The dates of the current exam cycle are a Saturday and a Sunday in March, June and December. The examination is administered on two consecutive days; the written section on Saturday and the OSCE on Sunday. Accommodations can usually be made for candidates who have conflicting religious observations. For candidates who observe the Sabbath on Saturday, the written exam may be taken on Friday. The current fee for the exam is CDN $2800. Once graduation from an accredited dental school is confirmed, the NDEB sends successful candidates an official certificate, which in turn is used to apply to individual provinces and territories for licensure.

Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game adventure, designed to be compatible with the Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set. Plot summary Adventures in Blackmoor is a scenario set in the land of Blackmoor, 3000 years before other D&D; scenarios by TSR. The player characters are transported from their \\"modern\\" time to the time of Blackmoor and must rescue King Uther from The Prison Out of Time. The adventure takes place in three parts inside an inn. The first part of the adventure takes place in a dungeon setting. Clues found in the inn lead to the second part of the adventure. The inn shifts between dimensions for the second part of the adventure, which concerns itself with certain changes taking place inside the inn as it shifts. In the third and final part of the adventure, the inn shifts to another dungeon. The final 20 pages of the adventure give a description of Blackmoor, and detail 38 prominent NPCs from the setting. The module includes campaign setting material on Blackmoor and the Thonian Empire. Publication history DA1 Adventures in Blackmoor was written by Dave L. Arneson and David J. Ritchie, and published by TSR in 1986 as a 64-page booklet with a color map and outer folder. The module uses Arneson's original campaign setting of Blackmoor, updated for the D&D; Expert Rules. It features cover art by Jeff Easley and interior artwork by Jim Holloway. It is designed for character levels 10–14,Product page on paizo.com. and features some locations and characters from Dave Arneson's original Blackmoor campaign.Dave Arneson Series at acaeum.com. This module consists of a 64-page booklet and an A2 color map inside a wraparound card cover. Also included are seven pages of background for the DM, which give the history of the area in which the adventure is set, as well as three more pages introducing the player characters to the world of Blackmoor. Reception Graeme Davis reviewed Adventures in Blackmoor for White Dwarf #86, calling the adventure \\"a device to get the Player characters into the world of Blackmoor from wherever they happen to be at the time\\". Davis felt that having the adventure take place in three versions of the same inn \\"cuts down on the map requirement but can lead to a static feel in play\\". He noted that while the adventure's introduction links it to X1 Isle of Dread, the device could be used in any game world. He felt that ending the adventure in an old-fashioned \\"zoo-dungeon\\" was disappointing, \\"reminding us of Blackmoor's origins\\", but that the clues leading to the second part of the adventure were intriguing. Davis felt that the background provided on Blackmoor was interesting information, but was too little for Dungeon Masters to base further adventures on the setting. He found that the adventure only has one core idea that doesn't get explored much. He was also disappointed that Blackmoor wasn't explored much \\"despite the colour map which comes as part of the package\\". Davis does note that players familiar with TSR and Judges' Guild products of the late 1970s would get a feeling of nostalgia from this adventure, and that the \\"zoo-dungeon\\" is \\"well written and set out, with a reasonable plot, and should provide an interesting and enjoyable session's play\\", despite how such adventures had become old fashioned by the time this module was published. He concluded the review by stating that the module \\"makes a reasonably good introduction to Blackmoor, but a lot will rest on DA2 and the rest of the series; as a campaign starter DA1 has a lot going for it, but it will stand or fall on what comes next\\".

The part is located in the borough of Grim, north of the centre of the city of Kristiansand, just to the northeast of the Baneheia recreation area. The park was constructed from 1874-1878 by military soldiers under the command of Colonel, later Major General, Joseph Frantz Oscar Wergeland. History Ravnedalen was the former billeting area called Grimsmoen, which had room for about 1,200 soldiers. In the 1860s, the military camp was moved to Gimlemoen. There were plans for using the old camp area as a rifle range, but Colonel Wergeland protested and insisted that the area would be perfect for a pleasure garden. In 1872 Byselskabet, where Wergeland was a chairman, applied for fundings, and the park was constructed during 1874-1878, by soldiers with spades instead of weapons. Ravnedalen. The cafè is in the background Construction The park was constructed as a romantic garden, in a valley with dramatic cliffs and waterfalls. A dam fointaine was built with natural pressure support from the nearby lake Baanetjønn. The garden has open areas for public arrangements like concerts, gatherings and festivals. The former gardener house is today used as a café. There used to be apes and peacocks, while today ducks and swans dominate the lakes. Some of Norway's largest spruce trees, planted around 1875, are found in the park. Exotic plants were imported and planted, like rhododendron, magnolia, mimosa, yew and cypress. Culture Major General Wergeland in Ravnedalen, by sculptor Gustav Lærum In the 1880s and 1890s the area was used for public feasts. Today, Ravnedalen is one of Kristiansand's cultural sites, where concerts and other arrangements are held regularly. The location has a capacity of 5,000 spectators in front of the outdoor stage. Gustav Lærum's 1917 bronze statue of Wergeland is located in Ravnedalen. The granite rock faces that form the backdrop of the park is a popular venue for rock climbers. Ravnedalen has about 70 established climbing routes. The selection of routes spans several grades and comprise bolted, partially bolted and traditionally protected climbs.

A drive for Marcos Racing International in the BPR Global Endurance GT series, saw him finish third in the GT2 class at the end of the season in 1996. Again, his race in the Le Mans 24 Hour race ended in retirement with Cor Euser and Pascal Dro. In the BRDC GT Championship he drove in just a few selected races. For 1997 he first raced for Cirtek Motorsport in a Ford Saleen Mustang GT2, before switching to AJL Racing, where he drove a Jaguar XJ220 GT1, where he achieved four podium finishes. He also drove in two rounds of the FIA GT Championship for Cirtek Motorsport. Yet again his race in the Le Mans 24 Hour ended in a retirement. In 1998 he raced in several different cars in BRDC GT Championship, including a TVR Cerbera GT2, a Porsche 911 GT2 and finally back with a Marcos LM600 for NCK Racing, which he continued with in 1999 and 2000. Also in 1999, he finished in twenty- second place overall in the Le Mans 24 Hours. His Chrysler Viper GTS-R finished the race but struggled with mechanical problems. In 2000 he drove in one round of the ALMS at the Nürburgring, where he finished in second in a Chrysler Viper GTS-R for Chamberlain Motorsport. BTCC Erdos got a drive in the prestigious British Touring Car Championship in 2001. Originally the ABG Motorsport Team had planned to field two independent Lexus IS200s along with Kurt Luby. In the end only one car raced all season, with Erdos replacing Luby halfway through the season. Despite driving in only twelve rounds from a total of twenty-six, he managed to impress many people by challenging with the works team and finishing the season in seventh place in points. He was lined up for a possible drive in the BTCC in 2007 for Xero Competition, but the team failed to raise the funds needed. GT and Le Mans Part 2 In January 2002 Erdos, together with Ian McKellar Jnr and Bobby Verdon-Roe, ran in the Daytona 24 Hours in a Saleen S7R entered by Graham Nash Motorsport (GNM). The car was so new that it ran in unpainted carbon fibre. Erdos was fastest in class in the early stages despite running against the formidable Jaguar of Paul Gentilozzi. However, alternator failures forced the team to 'park' the car after the opening few hours, using their remaining alternator to enable them to take the chequered flag by coming out to complete the final few laps. For the 2002 season Erdos was paired with Ian McKellar Jnr in the British GT championship driving the same Saleen S7R run by GNM, now painted white, with support from several AD Group companies together with Mouchel Metro and Renault trucks South West. The pair won the championship and Erdos won the Top Gun award for achieving pole position at every round. In the same year Erdos, together with Pedro Chaves and Gavin Pickering, was entered in the Saleen at Le Mans by GNM. Erdos began 2003 at Daytona in the Rolex 24 and then Erdos contested the FIA GT Championship in a Saleen S7R entered by GNM. His co- driver was Mike Newton and the car ran in the livery of Newton's AD Group of Companies. At Le Mans, the same car was run by Ray Mallock Ltd (RML) and Erdos' co drivers were Chaves and Newton. They failed to finish after a gearbox failure in the 24th hour. Erdos competed in the one off 1000 km race run on the Bugatti circuit at Le Mans in November 2003 in an MG EX257 with co- drivers Chris Goodwin and Newton. The RML entry retired after 65 laps with mechanical failure. Erdos was very busy in 2004 driving the MG EX257 in the inaugural Le Mans Endurance Series of 1000 km races together with Newton and Miguel Ramos and also sharing the Saleen with Newton in the FIA GT Championship. Both cars were run by RML. He finished 5th in LMP1 class of the LMES and 6th in the GT class of the FIA GT Championship. For Le Mans he shared the MG with Newton and Nathan Kinch but a good run was ended by engine failure. He once again started the 2005 season at the Rolex 24 at Daytona resulting in a best finish of 4th in the DP class and 7th overall. At Le Mans he shared the MG with Newton and Warren Hughes this time with Judd V8 power. A disastrous start with the car overheating on lap 1 and visiting the pits to have the cooling system bled and replenished left them last in class. However, a remarkable comeback with Hughes and Erdos setting fastest lap times throughout the night resulted in a class win by 4pm on Sunday. In the Le Mans Series Erdos looked set to win the P2 class, but, in the last round in Turkey, a startline incident involving Jean-Marc Gounon resulted in the MG making heavy contact with the pitwall. A remarkable feat of pit work by the RML crew saw the car rebuilt in record time. They rejoined the race and climbed back up the field to be beaten to the championship by one point. For 2006 the MG returned to Le Mans with AER power and this time, class victory was achieved from the front. Sharing with Newton and Andy Wallace the Erdos finished 8th overall after an almost trouble free run. At the final round of the LMS series in Jarama, Spain, Erdos was once again heading for championship victory having dominated the class throughout the season. An engine failure minutes before the end of the race meant that, once again, he just missed out on the top prize. Le Mans was less kind to him in 2007 when retirement followed an accident in the Porsche Curves whilst Andy Wallace was driving. However, the LMS series finally came Erdos' way that season with victory in the P2 class.

His rhyming style makes use of lyrics which are largely conceptual in nature and his hip-hop sound is known for blending various influences, ranging from reggae to traditional Japanese music to jazz. The style of music has made him a significant presence within the underground rap community, and he has achieved recognition beyond the scene for rapping \\"Battlecry\\", the theme song of the hip-hop-influenced chanbara anime Samurai Champloo, produced by late Japanese jazz rap DJ Nujabes. Biography Shingo Annen was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1975 and grew up in various cities in Tanzania and Japan, as well as London. At the age of fifteen, Shing02 moved to the San Francisco Bay Area of California just following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, where he became involved in various creative arts programs. He then moved to Berkeley for schooling and studied art at the University of California, Berkeley. Living in the Oakland and San Francisco Bay Area he became immersed in the hip-hop scene amongst direct descendants of members of civil rights movement groups such as the Black Panthers and Asian American activists. Shing02 has said of his music that \\"it was natural to have political and social messages in my music; I was fortunate to be exposed to it.\\" In 2010, Shing02 teamed up with Japanese-American jazz vocalist Emi Meyer for her second album, Passport. The two initially met via Myspace and Meyer joined Shing02 on his summer tour of Japan in 2008, after which they began work on Passport. Shing02's remix of the song \\"Odakias\\" by Ryuichi Sakamoto was uploaded to Sakamoto's SoundCloud in July 2012.

Life Ingestre Hall, Staffordshire He was the only child of Walter Chetwynd (1598–1669), the eldest son of Walter Chetwynd (died 1638), who built Ingestre Hall. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1657, but returned his native Staffordshire and occupied various local offices. In 1674, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Stafford when the sitting member died, but lost his seat in the second election of 1679. During the Popish Plot, he supported Titus Oates, but in 1682, he was providing information on the Staffordshire activities of the Duke of Monmouth. He regained Stafford in 1685 even though he had been appointed Sheriff of Staffordshire for that year. His attitude the Glorious Revolution was cautious, reporting the passage through Staffordshire of troops hostile to James II and did not sit in the Convention Parliament, but was elected for Staffordshire in 1690, greeting William III on his arrival at Lichfield in 1690. Chetwynd was also significant as a historian of his native county, building on the work of Sampson Erdeswicke. He began work on this subject in the 1660s and worked on it for the rest of his life. In doing this, he was following on the work of William Dugdale on Warwickshire. His writing of 'A Short Account of Staffordshire' began in 1679, but by 1688, he had only covered Pirehill Hundred in the northwest of the county. This remained unpublished until the early 20th century, when William Salt Archaeological Society published it in two of their volumes in 1909 and 1914. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1678, but took little part in its activities. He probably knew Christopher Wren, who was probably the architect of his new church at Ingestre, started in 1673 and completed in 1676.R. Plot, Natural History of Stafforshire (1686), 298-300. This interests were widespread, including numismatics, literature, theology, mathematics, but above all antiquities and natural history. Thus he gave hospitality and help to Robert Plot while he wrote his Natural History of Staffordshire from 1679. He was a hospitable and convivial man. He died in London in 1693 of smallpox and was buried at Ingestre. Family On 14 Sept. 1668, he married Anne, eldest daughter of Sir Edward Bagot, 2nd Baronet, of Blithfield, Staffordshire, leaving an only daughter, Frances, who died in her infancy. The Ingestre estate passed to his cousin Walter Chetwynd who was created Viscount Chetwynd. Notes References * *M. W.

Hands-on computing can make complicated computer tasks more natural to users by attempting to respond to motions and interactions that are natural to human behavior. Thus hands-on computing is a component of user-centered design, focusing on how users physically respond to virtual environments. Implementations * Keyboards * Stylus pens and tablets * Touchscreenshttp://research.microsoft.com/sendev/ * Human signaling Keyboards Keyboards and typewriters are some of the earliest hands-on computing devices. These devices are effective because users receive kinesthetic feedback, tactile feedback, auditory feedback, and visual feedback. The QWERTY layout of the keyboard is one of the first designs, dating to 1878.Baber, Christopher. Beyond the Desktop. Academic Press. 1997. New designs such as the split keyboard increase the comfort of typing for users. Keyboards input directions to the computer via keys; however, they do not allow the user direct interaction with the computer through touch or expression. Stylus pens and tablets Tablets are touch-sensitive surfaces that detect the pressure applied by a stylus pen. This works via changes in magnetic fields or by bringing together two resistive sheets, for magnetic tablets and resistive tablets respectively. Tablets allow users to interact with computers by touching through a stylus pen, yet they do not respond directly to a user's touch. Touchscreens Touchscreen allow users to directly interact with computers by touching the screen with a finger. It is natural for humans to point to objects in order to show a preference or a selection. Touchscreens allow users to take this natural action and use it to interact with computers. Problems may arise due to inaccuracy: people attempt to make a selection, but due to incorrect calibration, the computer does not accurately process the touch. Human signaling New developments in hands- on computing have led to the creation of interfaces that can respond to gestures and facial signaling. Often haptic devices like a glove have to be worn to translate the gesture into a recognizable command. The natural actions of pointing, grabbing, and tapping are common ways to interact with the computer interface. The latest studies include using eye tracking to indicate selection or control a cursor. Blinking and the gaze of the eye are used to communicate selections. Computers can also respond to speech inputs. Developments in this technology have made it possible for users to dictate phrases to the computer instead of type them to display text on an interface. Utilizing human signal inputs allows more people to interact with computers in a natural way. Current problems There are still many problems with hands- on computing interfaces that are currently being eradicated through continuing research and development. The challenge of creating a simple, user-friendly interface and developing it in an inexpensive and mass-producible way is the main complication in hands-on computing technologies. Because some interactions between human and machine are ambiguous, the mechanical response is not always the desired result for the user. Different hand gestures and facial expressions can lead the computer to interpret one command, while the user wished to convey another one entirely. Solving this problem is currently one of the main focuses in research and development. Researchers are also working to find the best way to design hands-on computing devices, so that the consumer can use the product easily. Focusing on user-centered design while creating hands-on computing products helps developers make the best and easiest-to-use product. Research and development This new field has a lot of room for contributions in research and product development. Hands-on computing technologies require scientists and engineers to use a different problem-solving strategy, which considers the devices for interaction rather than just input, the interaction devices in terms of tool use, how interaction will mediate user performance, and the context in which the devices will be used. In order for a machine to be successfully used, people need to be able to transfer some of their current skill set to operate it. This can be done directly, by comparing the interface to a known and familiar topic to help people understand, or by aiding the user to draw new inferences through feedback. Users must be able to understand how to use and manipulate the interface, in order to use it to its full capability. By applying their current skills, users can operate the machine without learning new concepts and approaches.Waern, Y. \\"Human Learning of Human-Computer Interaction: An Introduction.\\" Cognitive Ergonomics: Understanding, Learning and Designing Human-Computer Interaction (1990): 69-84.

From 2006 to 2018, he served in the Virginia House of Delegates representing the 50th district, made up of the city of Manassas and part of Prince William County in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. He is a member of the Republican Party, and was the House majority whip from 2012 to 2018. In the 2017 election, Miller lost his seat to a democratic socialist challenger, Democratic candidate Lee Carter. Miller has served on the House committees on Commerce and Labor (2010-2018), Courts of Justice (2008-2018), General Laws (2008-2009), Privileges and Elections (2007-2018), and Science and Technology (2007-2009). Early life, education Miller was born in Washington, D.C. He attended W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax County, Virginia, graduating in 1985. He received a B.S. degree in urban planning from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1990. He served in the United States Army Reserve 1989-1999, attaining the rank of captain. Electoral history In May 2004 Miller ran for a four-year term on the nonpartisan Manassas city council. In a race for three available seats, he finished third among four candidates. On March 28, 2006, 84-year-old Republican Delegate Harry J. Parrish died, leaving the 50th House district seat vacant. Miller ran as the Republican nominee, replacing Parrish in a special election held together with the November congressional election. He lost his seat in 2017 to a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Many regard his lost as the biggest surprise of the 2017 election cycle. The media believes the loss was due to a rise in voter turnout because of low approval ratings of president Donald Trump. {  - ! Date !! Election !! Candidate !! Party !!

Its sequel is The Phoenix Endangered. Plot Harrier Gillain is the youngest of four brothers and born in a family that has held the Harbor Master position in Armathelieh for centuries. As the youngest, he must follow in his father's footsteps to become the next Harbor Master. He is good friends with Tiercel Rolfort, the eldest of 6 children and born and into minor Nobility. The story begins during Festival Sennight in the city and Harrier's naming day falls on the first day. He receives a book called A Compendium of Ancient Myth and Legend, Compiled from the Histories of the City from his frequently travelling uncle, Alfrin. Having no desire to read the book, he hands it to Tiercel to read who is fond of reading and is actually interested in the book. A couple of days later Tiercel begins reading the book and his interests are piqued when he comes across topics he has not heard of before, among them are: High Mages, High Magick, and the Third War against the Light. The only magic he, or anyone he knows has ever heard of was Wild Magic, his curiosity gets the better of him. Tiercel goes off to the Great Library to look for a book titled A History of the City in Six Volumes. Working in the city harbor, Harrier stumbles upon a ship that is wrecked, the captain of the vessel claims that it is a kraken that attacked the ship, but krakens were presumably destroyed along with all the Endarkend at the conclusion of the Third War against the Light. Harrier showed Tiercel the ship and its damage and explained to him the story the captain is giving on the damage's origin. Tiercel felt sympathetic to the captain's losses and was determined to see if High Magick can discover the truth of the matter. Having discovered a spell from one of the books in the Great Library called a Knowing Spell, Tiercel decides to attempt to cast it on a piece of the ship so he can know the truth of the captain's tale. Tiercel attempts to cast the spell at home not following the instructions verbatim but nothing happens, he gets tired and falls asleep. During his sleep he starts to dream about a beautiful lady within a lake of fire. She is waiting for something and he knows that if she gets her hands on whatever it is, its going to be trouble. Although the dream's imagery is not scary, the feeling that he gets frightens him greatly—more so because he feels that it is so real. Tiercel then wakes up amidst a fire in his room, the fire is snuffed out by his servants and he reports to his parents that he was trying to read during the night. He realizes that he must have messed up on the spell, having to improvise on a few things. He remembers from his readings that the simplest High Magick spell that can be cast is fire. Unknowingly, Tiercel has become the first High Mage in more than a thousand years.

Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History, (Google Books), ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 304, (), accessed November 13, 2008. William C.

Specifications The Flettner rotor was seven inches long and winged. It could carry a liquid or dry biological agent and was designed to be used as a sub-munition in a missile warhead, cluster bomb or dispenser. The fins, or wings, were designed to extend by centrifugal force, thus stabilizing the bomblet as it flew to the target area. The Flettner rotor has a glide angle of 44 degrees. The Flettner rotor made it possible for a single B-52 to cover an area of 20,000 square kilometers with biological agent. The Flettner rotor utilized the delayed action dissemination technique (DADT) fuse. This type of fuse has two functions. The first is that the internal fuse can initiate the gas expulsion system in the event of tampering, or certain environmental conditions. This DADT fuse also self-destructs after three days if the munition fails to dispense its agent on impact as designed. Fuses incorporating self-destruct mechanisms are considerably more expensive than traditional fuses.Kirby, Reid. \\"The CB Battlefield Legacy: Understanding the Potential Problem of Clustered CB Weapons \\", Army Chemical Review, pp. 25-29, July-December 2006, accessed November 16, 2008.

It was recorded at Twelfth and Porter in Nashville, Tennessee in April 1985. Recording Although Van Zandt had always been known primarily as a solo performer, by the mid-1980s he had expanded his touring band with the addition of Leland Waddell on drums, his brother David on bass, and Boston transplant Donny Silverman on saxophone and flute. The group was rounded out by Van Zandt's longtime guitarist Mickey White, who recalled to Van Zandt biographer John Kruth in 2007, \\"Unfortunately the rehearsals just turned into big drunken orgies with everybody arguing all the time. We'd just get drunk and wind up screaming at each other. If we'd been sober, we woulda been a great band.\\" The band gigged around Texas mostly, but Van Zandt eventually realized that hauling a full band around with him was a logistical nightmare, and by the time his manager Harold Eggers booked the show at Twelfth and Porter in Nashville, the Waddell rhythm section had been abandoned. According to the book To Live's To Fly: The Ballad of the Late, Great Townes Van Zandt, the show was well hyped, with Guy Clark, Rodney Crowell, Rosanne Cash, and Neil Young attending to see Van Zandt perform, although the book quotes White as saying, \\"I didn't like the way it was recorded and tried to talk Townes out of releasing it.\\" In his 2018 memoir My Years with Townes Van Zandt: Music, Genius, and Rage, road manager and business partner Harold Eggers takes credit for suggesting the idea of recording the show at the 12th and Porter show and getting leading music writer Robert K. Oermann to write an article in The Tennessean titled \\"Poet Laureate of Texas' Rambles into Music City\\" to hype the concert. Eggers writes: Reception AllMusic praises Live and Obscure, noting that \\"The rambling Texas troubadour did not disappoint his fans, peers, and colleagues that night...In this intimate setting, Van Zandt's aw-shucks charm comes through not just his songs, but his in-between banter.\\"  Track listing  All songs written by Townes Van Zandt # \\"Dollar Bill Blues\\" – 2:40 # \\"Many a Fine Lady\\" – 3:51 # \\"Nothin' \\" – 3:23 # \\"Pueblo Waltz\\" – 2:24 # \\"Talking Thunderbird Blues\\" – 2:09 # \\"Rex's Blues\\" – 2:19 # \\"White Freightliner Blues\\" – 3:12 # \\"Loretta\\" – 3:31 # \\"Snake Mountain Blues\\" – 2:53 # \\"Waiting Around to Die\\" – 2:54 # \\"Tecumseh Valley\\" – 4:28 # \\"Pancho and Lefty\\" – 4:19 # \\"You Are Not Needed Now\\" – 4:41 Personnel *Townes Van Zandt – vocals, guitar *Donny Silverman – flute, saxophone *Mickey White – guitar Production notes *Produced by Stephen J.

Due to term limits established by the Oklahoma Constitution, incumbent Democratic Governor Brad Henry could not seek re- election. The race had been hotly contested by both political parties, with several well-known Oklahomans announcing their candidacy up to two years before the election. This was the first time a woman challenged another woman for Governor of Oklahoma. The non-partisan Cook Political Report and CQ Politics rate the gubernatorial election as \\"likely Republican\\" and \\"leaning Republican\\", respectively. On November 2, 2010, Republican candidate Mary Fallin was elected, defeating Democratic candidate Jari Askins. Overview Democratic governor Brad Henry was easily re-elected in 2006 and maintains the highest approval rating of any state official in Oklahoma. In 2008, Republicans made gains in the state legislature and took control of both the House and the Senate for the first time in Oklahoma history. As both parties nominated female candidates (Jari Askins for the Democrats and Mary Fallin for the Republicans; both of whom have also previously held the office of lieutenant governor), and as no third-party or write-in candidate qualified for the ballot, Oklahoma was guaranteed its first ever female governor.

Joseph Hawley III was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, a son of Joseph Hawley II (28 August 1682 - 1 June 1735) and Rebekah Stoddard (d. 1766), the daughter of Solomon Stoddard (1643-1729). Stoddard, a minister who held the pulpit of Northampton's First Congregational Church for sixty years, was succeeded in his pulpit by his grandson, Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758). Thus, Joseph Hawley III was a first cousin to Jonathan Edwards. Through his sermons and ministry, Edwards led his congregation in an early manifestation of the First Great Awakening in 1734-1735. Joseph's father Joseph Hawley II, in deep distress over the perceived depth of his own sinfulness, committed suicide in 1735 when Joseph III was eleven years old, which Edwards publicly attributed to the work of Satan and the Hawley family’s history of mental illness, described as \\"melancholy\\". Joseph Hawley III graduated from Yale College in 1742 (he studied theology), and served as a chaplain in a Massachusetts regiment during the 1745 Louisbourg expedition. He studied law under Phineas Lyman, and began practicing in 1749. He served in a variety of public offices, and was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1751. Hawley was active in getting Jonathan Edwards dismissed from his position as pastor of the Northampton church. During the Stamp Act crisis he emerged, with Samuel Adams and James Otis, Jr., as a leader of the popular (or Whig) party. He declined election to the First Continental Congress in 1774, but was an active leader of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. He urged Massachusetts's delegates to the Second Continental Congress to issue the United States Declaration of Independence. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1776 and never again served in the legislature, but he continued to write important political essays. He was charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780. Joseph Hawley is the namesake of the city of Hawley, Massachusetts. Notes References *Stephen E.

The Marist Red Foxes compete in NCAA Division I athletics as a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) the only exception being football, a member of the Pioneer Football League (PFL). The Red Foxes make up 23 varsity teams. Separate men's and women's teams are sponsored for basketball, tennis, crew, lacrosse, soccer, cross country, track, swimming and diving. Sponsored women's teams are softball, volleyball, and water polo. While sponsored men's teams are baseball and football. These varsity programs involve more than 550 Marist student-athletes. The crew programs are among the few in the nation that claim on-campus facilities. The red fox or reynard is indigenous to the Hudson Valley where Marist is located and is regarded as highly intelligent and cunning. It is the red fox from which Marist's school colors of red and white are derived. Marist has been recognized by Sports Illustrated as having one of the top 200 college athletic programs in the U.S.  Overview  The Marist athletic department is the biggest and most successful in the MAAC. Marist has been awarded the MAAC conference's highest honor, the Commissioner's Cup, more than any school in history. The Commissioner's Cup is given annually to the most successful MAAC athletic department over the course of the year. Student athletes at Marist routinely excel in the classroom. In 2019 for the 18th straight year Marist led the MAAC with 262 selections to the conference's Academic Honor Roll. Marist also had 57 student athletes selected to the PFL's Academic Honor Roll and four men's rowers named to the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) 2019 All-Academic Team.

They would not reach the 20 win plateau again until the hiring of Brian Giorgis before the 2002–2003 season. In Brian's first season Marist would go 20–11, (13–5 MAAC). Since then, under Brian's guidance, Marist has dominated the MAAC with 10 championships and has become a powerhouse on the national stage. The first conference crown came in 2004 followed by another one in 2006. Although Marist would lose both times in the first round of the NCAA Tournament (2004 to Oklahoma and 2006 to Georgia) these games were just building blocks for greater successes. Marist women's basketball game vs Boston University at McCann ArenaIn March 2007, after a going 27–5 and making the NCAA tournament for the third time in school history, Marist's women's basketball team surprised a nation of NCAA fans under the leadership of co- captains Alisa Kresge and Nikki Flores, carried by Rachele Fitz. They became the third 13th seed to make it to the Sweet 16 since the women's tournament expanded to 64 teams. They defeated 4th-seeded Ohio State and 5th-seeded Middle Tennessee to make it to the Sweet 16. In March 2008, the women's basketball team was seeded 7th in the New Orleans Regional of the NCAA Basketball Tournament where they defeated the 10th seeded Depaul Blue Demons 76–57. They were then defeated by the 2nd seeded LSU Lady Tigers 68–49 on March 24, 2008, ending Marist's 22-game winning streak. The 2009 and 2010 Women's NCAA Basketball Tournaments saw Marist lose in the first rounds to Virginia and Georgetown respectively. In the 2011 NCAA tournament the women's basketball team defeated Iowa State in the first round and were thoroughly defeating Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium in the 2nd round until Marist's best player Erica Allenspach was injured. Duke took the lead late in the 2nd half and prevailed 71–66. During the 2011–2012 season the Marist women's basketball team won their seventh straight MAAC championship by crushing Fairfield in the MAAC Final 61–35. They would go on to the NCAA Tournament as a 13 seed and beat 4th seed Georgia 76–70. Marist would then lose a tough game in the second round 66–63 to the 5th seed St. Bonaventure ending another successful season for a team that was viewed as Marist's most vulnerable in years. The 2012–2013 season was the third time in the last six years that Marist would go undefeated in MAAC regular season play (18–0). Marist cruised through the MAAC tournament and defeated Iona 72–48 in the championship game. This was Marist's 9th MAAC title tying St. Peters for the most championships in MAAC history. Shortly after winning the 2013 MAAC crown Brian Giorgis was named an assistant coach for the USA Women's World University Games Team during the 2013 games to be held in Kazan Russia. In the first round of the 2013 NCAA Tournament Marist struggled offensively and lost a tough first-round game to Michigan State 55–47. Marist extended their MAAC dominance during the 2013–2014 season winning their 10th overall MAAC crown and 9th straight after overcoming a 17-point deficit against Quinnipiac University in the conference tournament championship game to win 70–66. The game was Marist's 26th MAAC tournament win in a row. Marist was defeated 87–65 by their hosts, a red hot shooting Iowa Hawkeyes team who shot 12 of 25 from 3-point range and 57 percent from the field, in the first round of the 2014 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament. Second seeded Marist lost to #1 seed Quinnipiac in the 2015 MAAC Tournament Championship Game ending the Red Foxes' nine-year run as champions and 28 game winning streak in conference tournament games. This was also the first time in 35 MAAC tournament games that Marist wasn't the higher seeded team.  Crew  Marist College Crew rowing bladeMarist has a large and active rowing program. Marist currently hosts both men's and women's heavyweight and lightweight teams. The women's teams compete as part of the MAAC. The teams row out of the Marist Boathouse on campus and use Longview Park to host races. Each spring Marist competes against the United States Military Academy for the President's Cup Trophy. The two teams switch off hosting the event each year. West Point's proximity (30 miles south, on the opposite shore of the Hudson) and its competitive rowers (despite its club team status) has led to an intense rivalry developing over the years. The President's Cup Regatta, named in honor of former Marist College President Linus Richard Foy has been an annual event for over four decades. Spectators at the 1907 Poughkeepsie Regatta In October 2009, to celebrate the quadricentennial of Henry Hudson's exploration of the Hudson River, Marist hosted a reenactment of the Intercollegiate Rowing Association's now defunct Poughkeepsie Regatta at Longview Park. From 1895 to 1949 the IRA's national championship race was held in Poughkeepsie on the same site that is now Longview Park. The original races started off Rogers Point in Hyde Park and ended about a mile south of the Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge. The top college teams would attend and Poughkeepsie was known as the rowing capital of the world. There were about 125,000 fans along the route in 1929, and 100,000 in 1930. 2009 competitors included Marist, Columbia, Cornell, Navy, Pennsylvania, Syracuse, Army, and Vassar College. Since 2009 Marist's autumn Poughkeepsie Regatta has been held intermittently. Marist routinely participates in the annual ECAC championships, the NYSCCA (New York State) rowing championships and the IRA national championships. During the summer of 2002 the Marist men's varsity eight boat advanced to the semifinals of the Temple Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. In 2013 the women's program qualified for the inaugural NCAA Rowing Championships in Indianapolis.  Football  Sacred Heart in 2013 Football started at Marist as a club sport in 1965 and became a varsity sport in 1978 as a Division III independent. In 1993 football moved up to Division I-AA and in 1994 became the first Marist athletic team to become a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Marist plays its home games in Tenney Stadium on the main campus in Poughkeepsie. In February 2008, Marist joined the Pioneer Football League as its tenth member effective for the 2009 season, ending the MAAC Football League.\\"Marist to join Pioneer League in 2009\\" .

In the 2015 tournament #20 Marist bested Bryant University 10-6 in a first four game. However #2 ranked Syracuse had too much talent for the foxes in their first-round game winning 20-8. Originating as a club sport during the 1970s, men's lacrosse subsequently became an NCAA Division III varsity sport and by the early 1980s, began transitioning up to Division I. In 1981, the Marist men's lacrosse team captured the Knickerbocker Conference title. The women's team has been to two NCAA Tournaments.

Many fans and sportswriters refer to this match-up as \\"The Battle of I-87\\" because of the two-hour proximity of each school on Interstate 87 (Coincidentally, the approximate distance between the two is 87.4 miles). Although this rivalry exists in all sports, it is most heated during the basketball season. During the 1983–1984 season a brawl between the two basketball teams, their fans and coaches at McCann put the series on hiatus for three years. The animosity goes back to when both schools competed at the Division II level, then the ECAC Metro Conference and continues today in the MAAC. Facilities James J. McCann Recreation Center The James J. McCann Recreation Center consists of three major areas and dozens of minor ones. The three major areas are the McCann Field House, the Natatorium, and the Strength and Conditioning Center. McCann Arena is a 3,200-seat multi-purpose arena home to the men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball teams. It also hosts special events such as concerts for the student population. The natatorium is a facility, ranging in depth from to . It provides six lanes and an independent diving well. The well contains two 1-meter and one 3-meter diving board. The Strength and Conditioning Center is two floors. The lower floor consists of weight training equipment, the upper floor consists of cardiovascular training equipment. All told, the facility can easily accommodate 100 students simultaneously. Minor areas include two racquetball courts, a dance studio, five locker rooms, a classroom, the Pepsi Hall of Fame multi-media meeting room, the Dr. Maynard Center for Sports Medicine, the Academic Enhancement Center, the Coach's Complex, an Mondo-surfaced auxiliary gymnasium, used heavily by intramurals and club sports, and a student lounge. Tenney Stadium at Leonidoff Field McCann Baseball Field Tennis pavilion In 2006, a tennis pavilion opened to support the men's and women's tennis programs. It features eight lighted, regulation-sized courts, a center walkway, and a pergola-covered spectator area. Along with Marist the United States Military Academy and the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York, host site of the U.S. Open, are the only tennis venues in the area that can boast a Deco II playing surface. Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill the pavilion is located on the east campus. The pavilion replaced the old tennis courts that were removed in 1994 to make room for the construction of the Murray Student Center. Boathouse Row and Longview Park Gazebo at Longview ParkCornell (foreground) and Marist boathouses with Poughkeepsie Bridge in distance The athletic facilities with the greatest amount of history in the Marist College Athletic Department are the boathouses located on campus, which sit on the banks of the Hudson River. It is rare in collegiate rowing to have on-campus rowing facilities. Two houses exist: the original Cornell University boathouse once occupied by Cornell's crew teams during their annual training and racing at the Poughkeepsie Regatta, which was held in Poughkeepsie from the late 19th century until 1949, and the newer adjacent Marist boathouse, which stands on the former site of the University of California and University of Washington boathouses. The Marist boathouse features a boat bay, which contains a fleet of 16 top-of-the-line Vespoli shells. Additionally, on the second floor are 30 Concept II ergs, free weights, a video viewing lounge and a coaching office. The Cornell boathouse was remodeled in 2008, and currently is used by the school President for administrative functions, as well as housing a few racing shells for the women's team. The 12 acre Longview Park is home of the champion Marist men's and women's rowing teams. It is where Marist hosts intercollegiate and interscholastic rowing regattas. It has a bike/walk path along the Hudson River's east shore, a fishing pier, the boathouses, and a gazebo with scenic vistas on a promontory in the center of the park. Gartland Athletic Field & Softball Field Also known as North Field, the Gartland Athletic Field now serves as a core practice facility for Marist intercollegiate sports, including soccer, lacrosse, and rugby. It is also a playing field for club sports and general recreation. At almost in size, the field is large enough to accommodate three team practices simultaneously. The turf is composed of a Kentucky bluegrass, rye and fescue mix situated on a sand and organic material base. An irrigation system provides 85 sprinkler heads to help maintain this practice location. The intercollegiate Softball field, equipped with a state-of-the-art electronic score board and newly renovated dugouts, resides in the far corner of North field.

In 1981, Janda played in the Academy Award-winning movie Mephisto. In 1982, she played the lead character in Ryszard Bugajski's film Przesłuchanie (Interrogation), which first premiered seven years later in 1989, following the collapse of communism. Despite the film's late release, she garnered international acclaim for her performance, including winning Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival and Polish Film Festival in 1990. In 1993, she was a member of the jury at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. Janda is also known for her leading role in the second episode of Dekalog series of Krzysztof Kieślowski. She is considered one of the greatest and most popular actresses in the history of Polish cinema. Life and work  She was born on 18 December 1952 in Starachowice, Polish People's Republic. She graduated from the Wojciech Gerson State High School of Fine Arts in Warsaw (), and in 1975 she graduated from the State Dramatic Arts College in Warsaw (currently the Aleksander Zelwerowicz State Theatre Academy). She made her acting debut in 1974 playing the role of Maria Kulygina in Anton Chekhov's play Three Sisters, directed by Aleksander Bardini and broadcast in a Television Theatre production. In the same year, she played the role of Mannequin 34 in a street grotesque play The Ball of Mannequins by Polish futurist poet Bruno Jasieński, directed by Janusz Warmiński. In 1976, she played in the role of Dorian Gray based on Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, adapted by John Osborne and directed by Andrzej Łapicki in Warsaw's \\"Little Theatre\\". In the years 1976–1987 she worked as an actress in the Ateneum Theatre in Warsaw. She made her film debut in 1973, when she starred in the historical-based TV series Czarne chmury (\\"Black Clouds\\"), but a turning point in her acting career came with the role of Agnieszka in Andrzej Wajda's Man of Marble (1976). She became known for portraying strong and determined female characters with complex personalities in her film roles. Apart from Man of Marble, her most memorable roles include characters in critically acclaimed films like Man of Iron, Interrogation and My Mom's Lovers. She also embarked on a career as a singer and made her debut in 1977 during the 15th National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, where she sang the song Guma do żucia (\\"The Chewing Gum\\") with lyrics written by Marek Grechuta. Krystyna Janda by artist Zbigniew Kresowaty In the 1980s she appeared in numerous films and stage productions and started working as a film and theatre director herself. In 1995 she directed the film Pestka based on a novel by Anka Kowalska. During her professional career she has played over 60 theatre roles in virtually all the major theatre genres as well as appeared in around 100 films. Her role in Euripides's Medea is considered among her most successful ones. She is particularly known for her artistic collaboration with renowned Academy Award-winning filmmaker Andrzej Wajda. She starred in six of his films altogether: Man of Marble (1976), Man of Iron (1981), Without Anesthesia (1978), The Orchestra Conductor (1980), Solidarity, Solidarity... Man of Hope (2005), and Sweet Rush (2009). Throughout her career, she has received numerous prestigious awards, such as Best Actress at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, Silver Shell for Best Actress at the San Sebastian Film Festival for her role in Waldemar Krzystek's film Zwolnienie z życia, Best Actress Award at the 1987 Montreal Film Festival for the role in Helma Sanders-Brahms's Laputa, Best Actress Award at the Belgrade Film Festival for Interrogation, the Zbigniew Cybulski Award for best young Polish actress, as well as 4 Golden Duck Awards. She is widely regarded as one of the greatest actresses in the history of Polish cinema and was selected in a 1998 Polityka magazine survey among the greatest actresses of the 20th century. In 2005, she established her own private \\"Polonia Theatre\\" in Warsaw. She is also the founder and head of the Krystyna Janda Cultural Foundation. In 2010, her foundation opened another theatre in Warsaw – the \\"Och-teatr\\" in the district of Ochota. She has also worked as a columnist in a number of magazines such as Poradnik domowy, Pani, and Uroda. She is also a member of the Supervisory Board of the Fundacja Okularnicy, which is a foundation dedicated to the promotion and popularization of Agnieszka Osiecka's poetic legacy. In 2019, she received the World Cinema Dramatic Special Jury Award for Acting for her role in Jacek Borcuch's film Dolce Fine Giornata at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Personal life In the years 1974–1979 she was in a relationship with actor Andrzej Seweryn. In 1981, she married Edward Kłosiński, who died on 5 January 2008.

These factors are required for the binding of mRNA to 40S ribosomal subunits. In addition these proteins are helicases that function to unwind double-stranded RNA.  Background  The mechanisms governing the basic subsistence of eukaryotic cells are immensely complex; it is therefore unsurprising that regulation occurs at a number of stages of protein synthesis – the regulation of translation has become a well- studied field. Human translational control is of increasing research interest as it has connotations in a range of diseases. Orthologs of many of the factors involved in human translation are shared by a range of eukaryotic organisms; some of which are used as model systems for the investigation of translation initiation and elongation, for example: sea urchin eggs upon fertilization, rodent brain and rabbit reticulocytes. Monod and Jacob were among the first to propose that \\"the synthesis of individual proteins may be provoked or suppressed within a cell, under the influence of specific external agents, and the relative rates at which different proteins may be profoundly altered, depending upon external conditions\\". Almost half a century after the flurry of postulations arising from the revelation of the central dogma of molecular biology, of which the preceding supposition by Monod and Jacob is an example; contemporary researchers still have much to learn about the modulation of genetic expression. Synthesis of protein from mature messenger RNA in eukaryotes is divided into translation initiation, elongation, and termination of these stages; the initiation of translation is the rate limiting step. Within the process of translation initiation; the bottleneck occurs shortly before the ribosome binds to the 5’ m7GTP facilitated by a number of proteins; it is at this stage that constrictions born of stress, amino acid starvation etc. take effect.  Function  Eukaryotic initiation factor complex 2 (eIF2) forms a ternary complex with GTP and the initiator Met-tRNA – this process is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange and phosphorylation and serves as the main regulatory element of the bottleneck of gene expression. Before translation can progress to the elongation stage, a number of initiation factors must facilitate the synergy of the ribosome and the mRNA and ensure that the 5’ UTR of the mRNA is sufficiently devoid of secondary structure. Binding in this way is facilitated by group 4 eukaryotic initiation factors; eIF4F has implications in the normal regulation of translation as well as the transformation and progression of cancerous cells; as such, it represents an interesting field of research. Mechanism The repertoire of compounds involved in eukaryotic translation consists of initiation factor classes 1 – 6; eIF4F is responsible for the binding of capped mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit via eIF3. The mRNA cap is bound by eIF4E (25 kDa), eIF4G (185 kDa) acts as a scaffold for the complex whilst the ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A (46 kDa) processes the secondary structure of the mRNA 5’ UTR to render it more conducive to ribosomal binding and subsequent translation. Together these three proteins are referred to as eIF4F. For maximal activity; eIF4A also requires eIF4B (80 kDa), which itself is enhanced by eIF4H (25 kDa). A study conducted by Bi et al. in wheat germ seemed to indicate that eIF4A has a higher binding affinity for ADP than ATP except in the presence of eIF4B, which increased the ATP binding affinity tenfold without affecting ADP affinity. Once bound to the 5’ cap of mRNA, this 48S complex then searches for the (usually) AUG start codon and translation begins. Genes In humans, the gene encoding eIF4A isoform I has a transcript length of 1741bp, contains 11 exons, and is located on chromosome 17. The genes for human isoforms II and III reside on chromosomes 3 and 17 respectively. Proteins The 407 residue, 46 kDa, protein eIF4A is the prototypical member of the DEAD box helicase family, so-called due to their conserved four-residue D-E-A-D sequence. This family of helicases is found in a range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms including humans, wherein they catalyse a variety of processes including embryogenesis and RNA splicing as well as translation initiation. Crystallographic analysis of yeast eIF4A carried out by Carruthers et al. (2000) revealed that the molecule is approximately 80 Å in length and has a “dumbbell” shape where the proximal section represents an 11 residue (18 Å) linker postulated to confer a degree of flexibility and distension to the molecule in solution. eIF4A is an abundant cytoplasmic protein.

Tom Cooper circa 1897. Tom Cooper (1874 – November 1906Thomas \\"Tom\\" Cooper (1874-1906) findagrave.com) was an 1890s champion bicycle racer and early auto racing driver. He is best known for his rivalry with Major Taylor as well as his later work with Henry Ford and Barney Oldfield.  Early years  Tom Cooper began his cycling career in Detroit. His talent and athletic ability soon made him a national celebrity in the US as he climbed to the top of the sport. As a champion bicycle racer, Cooper was a contemporary of Barney Oldfield, Carl G. Fisher, Johnny Johnson, Arthur Gardiner, \\"Plugger Bill\\" Martin and Eddie Bald. At the 1898 League of American Wheelmen championship race on the Newby Oval in Indianapolis, Cooper won the half-mile professional event. He went on to win the Bicycle Championship of America for the 1899 season. Cooper was instrumental in the formation of the American Racing Cyclists Union in 1898, a rival to the League of American Wheelmen. Cooper, like many bicycle racers at the time such as Fisher and Oldfield, was drawn to the nascent automobile industry in the early 1900s. The gears and chains of bicycles were the heart of the powertrains of the earliest automobiles.  The Cooper-Ford racer  In 1902, Cooper formed a partnership with fellow Detroiter Henry Ford to build two high-speed race cars. This was about a year before Ford founded the Ford Motor Company. The result of the project were two wood-frame racers with four cylinder, 1,080 cubic inch engines. The cars were initially temperamental and Ford sold his share of their partnership to Cooper in October 1902. This was just days before Cooper entered them in the Manufacturer's Challenge Cup at Grosse Pointe, Michigan on October 25, 1902. Cooper, assisted by mechanic Ed \\"Spider\\" Huff, agreed that Barney Oldfield should drive the machine they had focused on, \\"999\\" (named after a New York Central railroad train). The result of the event became the topic of national news when Oldfield defeated millionaire Alexander Winton, founder of the Winton Motor Carriage Company, and widely recognized as America's top race driver. Oldfield continued to race for Cooper for another 10 months, doing much to establish Ford's reputation as an automotive engineer by winning several races. He also drove the Cooper-Ford \\"999\\" racer to the first \\"mile a minute\\" (60 mph) on a circular track at the Indiana State Fairgrounds dirt oval in June 1903.  Cooper-Oldfield barnstorming  Cooper and Oldfield remained partners in many ways even after Oldfield left their race team to drive for Alexander Winton in August 1903. The two toured the Midwestern United States negotiating $1,000-plus purses from organizations such as the State Fair Association of Milwaukee in 1903. One of the highlights of these events for Cooper was his victory over Oldfield and one of his Winton racers at Grosse Pointe, Michigan on September 9, 1903. Cooper was a recognized top driver in his own right, and barnstormed on occasion without Oldfield. Some of these events were odd exhibitions, such as his special mile record on September 5, 1906, when he drove a Matheson automobile with seven passengers to a record for the distance under those conditions at 50.2 seconds or 71.71 mph. This record was achieved on the beach at Atlantic City.  Vanderbilt Cup career  Although Cooper never raced in the Vanderbilt Cup, he did work with the American Matheson team in 1905 and 1906, and was entered in the 1905 American Elimination Trials on September 22, 1905. In the final day of practice for the 1905 American Elimination Trial, Cooper's Matheson had a faulty lubricating system, destroying the main engine bearing. In 1906, Cooper returned with Matheson not as a driver, but as team manager. The driver was the Italian Ralph Mongini. Mongini led a few miles of the first lap around the 29.71 mile course before losing control of his machine and crashing into a telegraph pole. The 1906 race was held September 23.  Vanderbilt Cup Broadway play  Cooper and Oldfield took several creative approaches to making money. Bicycle racers, mechanics, race car drivers, they even owned a gold mine together in Colorado at the turn of the 20th century. In January 1906, they attempted to parlay their renown as race drivers into an easier way to generate large sums of money. Together they created a special effect using two race cars (the Peerless Green Dragon and the Peerless Blue Streak), bags of dirt, two large treadmills and stage props to create the illusion of a motor race for a Charles Dillingham play, The Vanderbilt Cup, starring Elsie Janis. The two appeared on stage nightly. The show was a success but Oldfield and Cooper tired of the acting lifestyle in less than three months and returned to auto racing full-time.  Death  Cooper was killed in an auto accident in New York City on November 16, 1906. He is buried in Woodmere Cemetery in Detroit.

In addition to hearing the Torah portion read in the synagogue, a person should read it himself twice during that week, together with a translation usually by Targum Onkelos and/or Rashi's commentary.Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 285:1-6Peninei Halacha, Different Customs Relating to Shnayim Mikra Ve-eĥad Targum In addition, while not required by law, there exists an Ashkenazi custom to also read the portion from the Prophets with its targum.Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 285:7  Sources  According to the gemara: :\\"...אמר רב הונא בר יהודה אמר רבי אמי \\"לעולם ישלים אדם פרשיותיו עם הצבור שנים מקרא ואחד תרגום :Rav Huna bar Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Ammi: \\"one should always complete the reading of one's weekly Torah portion with the congregation, twice from the mikra (i.e. Torah) and once from the Targum.\\"Berakhot 8a This statement was interpreted as the ritual of Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum and is codified in the Shulchan Aruch:Orach Chaim 285:1 :\\"Even though each person hears the Torah reading each week in the public reading, we are obligated to read each parasha twice in the hebrew and once in the Aramaic targum... Rashi's commentary shares the status of Targum, and those who fear Heaven will read the parashah with both Rashi's commentary and the targum.\\"  Laws  { style=\\"float: right;\\" border=\\"1\\" Times of Recitation (starting with most ideal) 1\\\\. On Friday, after the morning prayer 2\\\\. On Friday, after midday 3\\\\. On the Sabbath morning, before the lunch meal 4\\\\. After the Sabbath lunch meal but before the time for the Mincha prayer 5\\\\. Up until Tuesday evening following the Sabbath of a particular weekly portion 6\\\\. Up until Shemini Atzeret of that particular year } As above, the basic obligation of Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum involves reciting the Hebrew text of the weekly portion twice and then reciting Targum Onkelos once. *One should read a passage from the Torah twice, followed by the Targum translation of that passage, then continuing to the next Torah passage in order. However, if one read the verses out of order, or read the translation of a passage between the two readings of the passage itself, one's obligation is fulfilled and one does not need to repeat the reading. * There are multiple customs for how the Torah text is divided for the purposes of shnaim mikra (which affects the sequence in which the text and translation are read). Some divide the text into individual verses, reading a single verse twice followed by its translation, then continuing to the next verse. Otherse.g. the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 72:11 divide the Torah into its closed and open paragraphs as set out in a Torah scroll and in most printed copies, reading each paragraph as a whole, first twice in Hebrew and then once in Targum. Others divide by aliyot, reading one or two a day (see below) or according to other divisions. *While listening to the Torah in synagogue, one can read the text along with the reader and count it towards one recitation of mikra.Mishnah Berurah 285:2; Aruch Hashulchan 285:3,13 *By “Targum,” the Talmud refers to the Targum Onkelos. Numerous authoritiesincluding the Rosh (Berachot 1:8) and the Tur (O.C. 285) say that the commentary of Rashi is also acceptable. Someincluding the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim 285:2) maintain that it would be appropriate for one to study both Rashi and the Targum. If one does not have time for both, however, most poskim agree that Targum takes precedence over Rashi. The Mishnah Berurah285:5 concludes that if one cannot understand the commentary of Rashi, he may use a translation that conforms with traditional interpretations of the text;Tosafot (Berachot 8a, “Shnayim”) acknowledge the opinion that any translation of the Torah into one’s own language is acceptable, but they do not conclude agreeing with this opinion, since Targum Onkelos is a unique combination of translation and commentary. as an example, the book Tseno Ureno in Yiddish is suggested.\\"...at least one posek ruled that by reciting Mendelssohn’s translation of the Torah (for those not adept at reading Rashi’s commentary on the Torah), one has fulfilled the rabbinic obligation of שנים מקרא ואחד תרגום, no small matter.\\" * Multiple customs exist for when shnayim mikra should preferably be read. Some do the entire reading nonstop on Friday morning. Others read one aliyah of shnayim mikra on each day of the week. One should preferably finish the reading by the Shabbat morning Torah reading. *The Hebrew text should be recited with cantillation and with proper pronunciation. The Targum, however, should not be recited with cantillation.Hayyim ben Joseph Vital, Peri Etz Chaim, Sha'ar Hanhagat Limmud. This may not always have been the case. Some fragmentary manuscripts from Israel contain passages from the Targum with cantillation marks: Paul Kahle, Masoreten des Westens. This may have been for public synagogue reading rather than private study. *According to some, after completing shnaim mikra, the last verse should be read in Hebrew again so as not to complete the portion in the Targum translation. According to Chaim Yosef David Azulai, the last verse should be read twice. * When a holiday falls on a Friday, the weekly portion should be read on the Sabbath before the lunch meal. Some hold that Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum may be read on Yom Tov itself. * On the day of Hoshana Rabbah (any part of the daytime), Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum should be read for the V'Zot HaBerachah portion. *Moses Isserles, on 285:7, states that similarly reciting the Haftarah is customary although not obligatory (see Minhag). Other sources, e.g. Kitzur Shulchan Aruch ad. loc., likewise mention this custom. When (and if) the Haftarah for a bridegroom is read, one nevertheless reads the regular Haftarah here.  Specialized books  Although one may read Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum from any text, special books have been published which print the Hebrew text twice consecutively followed by the Aramaic Targum so as to assure that the reader will recite the requisite repetitions of each verse. Examples include Chumash Haavarat HaSidra and Chumash Shnayim Mikra Ve'Echad Targum. Electronic versions for use in smartphones, tablet computers and e-book readers are also available.Best Android apps for: Shnayim mikra Other works designed for daily Torah study (such as Chok l'Yisrael, which includes the Torah with other study texts divided by the weeks of the year) will print the Hebrew text once, and, as with a standard Chumash, the reader must remember to repeat the Hebrew text before going on to the Targum. Some of these works divide the weekly portion by day and, generally correspondingly, by Aliyah (Sunday: first Aliyah, Monday: Second Aliyah...). Others divide the weekly portion differently: for example Chok L'Yisrael prescribes a set number of verses for each day of the week, with the remainder of the portion to be read on Friday.

The headquarters are in the town of Walikale. The locality is situated between Bukavu and Lubutu (Maniema Province) on DR Congo National Road No. 2 in the valley of the river Lowa, 135 km to the west of Goma. Walikale is rich in cassiterite, which is refined elsewhere into tin. As of 2008, Walikale's cassiterite resources were largely controlled by warlords empowered by the ongoing Kivu conflict. Specifically, the renegade FARDC 85th Brigade, under Colonel Samy Matumo, controlled the mine at Bisie, up to early 2009, when it was replaced by \\"accelerated integration\\" FARDC elements. The FDLR is continuing its activities in the territory, with May 2009 attacks in Busurungi, in the area bordering South Kivu.MONUC, MONUC condemns the attack in Busurungi and despatches a joint protection team Busurungi has around 7,000 inhabitants, spread between the villages of Bunyamisimbwa, Busurungi, Kahunju, Kamaito, Kamanyola, Kasebunga, Katokoro, Kichanga, Kifuruka, Kilambo, Kitemera, Moka, Ndaboye, Nyamimba, and Tuonane.S/2009/603 (French version), 23 November 2009, footnote 4 at page 87.  Territory  The territory is divided into 2 collectivities, Bakano (4238 km²) and Wanianga (19,237 km²), and comprises 15 \\"groupements\\" totalling 90 localities. Walikale is the largest territory in the province of Nord-Kivu, with 39.46% of its surface.Monographie provinciale du Nord-Kivu, DSRP Many armed groupings, often former Interahamwe or the militias of Laurent Nkunda, control the forests and have forced a significant proportion of the population into urban settlements. These armed groups often inflict robbery and violence on the local people, as well as engage in hunting and poaching of nominally protected species. The territory is composed of various terrestrial and fresh water eco-regions. There are transition forests in the northeast and wet tropical forests and farmed land in the southeast and from Gilbertiodendron and Uapaca to the western edge of the province.  Population  The principal peoples of the territory are: * Nyanga (see Nyanga language) * Kanu (see Kanu language) * Kobo * Hunde (see Hunde language) (primarily in Masisi and Rutshuru Territories) * Komo (see Komo language) (primarily in Lubutu Territory) * Tembo (see Tembo language) (primarily in Kalehe Territory) * Kusu (see Kusu language) * Mbuti (Pygmies)  Armed groups   The FDLR: Forces Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda  The ‘Forces Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda’ (FDLR) was initially a political-military movement that was created in 2000 by Hutu rebels that had participated in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. During the first Congo war in 1996, the Rwandan army started to dismantle the refugee camp that had been created to host the refugees of 1994, in search of ex-FAR (Forces Armées Rwandaises). The ALIR (Armée de Libération du Rwanda), former FDLR, was, therefore, created by these Hutu rebels in order to dismiss the new Rwandan Government and to resettle a Hutu government. The use of the acronym FOCA (Forces combattantes Abacunguzi) refers to a kinyarwanda word meaning ‘saviors’ or ‘liberator’. However, their presence in the DRC was supposed to be temporary, in order to allow them time and protection (the wideness of the territory and its forests offers much more possibility to hide than Rwanda) to build up an army and to organize their potential coup d’Etat.Brune Mercier, Ressources Naturelles et Violence en RDC: les cas des FDLR, GRIP, 2009 The FDLR FOCA is, today, divided in three main brigades commanded by ‘Colonel’ Mutima, ‘Colonel’ Sadiki and ‘Colonel’ Omega. Their number has been evaluated between 3000 and 4500 rebels (Mercier 2009) In order to develop their influence and control over the territory, the FDLR tried on a few occasions to create alliances with the Mayi-Mayi Kifufua, Simba or Tseka, but at the moment no long term alliance has been created and fights between the FDLR and these groups are believed to have occurred on access to mines. The FDLR have an important impact in Walikale today: from all the armed groups’ presents in the region, they are the most organized, numerous, structured and their knowledge of the territory constitutes their strength. On the other hand, the accumulation of years and years of fighting and wild livelihoods (part of their members literally live in the forest all year long) as well as the discovery that their chiefs (involved in the 1994 genocide) have absolutely no interests in going back to Rwanda (the official and initial aim of the FDLR), where they would probably be judged by the National of International court of justice. Location in Walikale: approximate zones of FDLR’s actions. The FDLR control the territory of Walikale on wide superficies. Their presence has been detected on a wide axis going from the east of Oninga (border with Lubutu) to Walowa Yungu (Mpito/Ntoto area) as well as on the western part of the southern axis going from the Kahrizi-Biega Park. They have different basis: *In the South, they are currently based in Isangi (next to the river of Lukele, more or less five hours road from Itebero market) as well as Mpenbenema, Luenge (on the South Kivu direction) and Kamale (on the Shabunda direction). (Mercier 2009) *In the East, their base is located in the forest of Kabale (between Luberick and Ntoto). Ntoto used to be their basis before the first intervention of the FARDC in the region; they have now moved more or less thirty kilometers away from the east of Ntoto, in Ishunga (Mutshéri locality). Only the military police of the FDLR under the command of ‘Major Eric’ have stayed in Ntoto.GRIP, Armes légères dans l'Est du Congo: Enquête sur la perception de l'insécurité, 2011 Mining activities The areas controlled by the FDLR are mainly isolated forests and mining sites, exploited illegally and manually, with their own governance system, out of which we can identify: *The Bakano area: eight mining squares in Isangi, two in Mpango. They both are cassiterite, coltan, and gold mines. *The Ihana area: three mining squares in Ihana of gold and cassiterite. *The Luberick area: one mining square in Bana Mutati of gold and cassiterite, another mining square in Walowa of cassiterite and coltan. Cassiterite, coltan, and gold are being extracted from these mines and brought illegally to Goma through Masisi territory. The only way to reach these sites is by plane from Goma to Walikale Centre, followed by a long trek into the forest by motor bike and on foot (of a minimum of six hours).International Alert, The complexity of resource governance in a context of State Fragility: The case of Eastern DRC, 2010  The Mayi-Mayi Simba  The Mayi-Mayi Simba group was initially created in 1964 during the ‘Lumumbist rebellion’. It used to share communitarians ideals and motivations, but its motivations today are exclusively related to pillage and looting. They are located in the north of Walikale territory, on the western axis near the borders with Lubutu and Maniema (region of Oninga), but their activities have decreased in the last years in Walikale. It is very hard to evaluate their number, as today they often attack in alliance with the Mayi-Mayi Tseka, or very occasionally with the FDLR. One of the most recent grouped attacks is the one lead in the famous mining site of Bisié.idem, GRIP, 2011  The Mayi-Mayi Kifuafua  Initially, the Mayi-Mayi Kifuafua was a self-defense group, aiming at defending their villages against the CNDP (previously called the RDC) in the region of Ufamando, in South Kivu. Today they have moved to South Walikale, in Walowa Loanda and Walowe Ubora regions, and control the southern axis of Chambucha to Karete. This position is very strategic as it is right on the trade road linking Bukavu to Walikale. They also control the eastern area of the Chambucha-Karete axis. The Mayi-Mayi Kifuafua is divided into two groups, and antagonisms have started to arise between the leaders of these factions *‘Colonel’ Delphin Bahenda, Walowa Loanda: this faction tends to collaborate partially with the MONUSCO and the governmental army. It has sometimes fought against the FDLR. However Colonel Delphin appears to be exclusively interested by his personal enrichment and would be manipulating the governmental army and the MONUSCO in order to beneficiate from both looting and subventions from the formers.Grasset Julia, Conflicts and Food Security in Walikale: Feasibility and Challenges to Program Implementation, Sciences Po Lille (unpublished) 2012 *Colonel Jules, Walowa Ubora: Colonel Jules appears as a very egocentric person, his personal dream of becoming a General is at the core of the faction’s ‘policy’. He refuses to collaborate with the governmental army unless he obtains the grade of General. In this perspective, this faction can potentially create an alliance with the FDLR, because of their geographic proximity and previous alliances. They have already led common attacks on populations, such as the well known massacre of 29 October 2009.Idem. These different tendencies and orientations are believed to be at the origins of ethnic tensions between Walowa Loanda and Walowa Ubora.  The Mayi-Mayi Tseka  The official motivation of the Mayi-Mayi Tseka is the protection of Walikale against the Tutsi invader. This faction was formed by Tseka, a merchant of ore, by young peasant from Walikale having lost their lands during the war, by some deserters of the FARDC or by formers CNDPs. Their location – on the western axis directed toward Kisangani, on the North of the cities of Mubi and Ndjingala, next to the famous mining area of Bisié – is representative of their concrete motivation, which is mining exploitation.idem GRIP, 2011  Accessibility   From Goma to Walikale Centre  There are three main ways to access Walikale Centre from Goma. The easiest and most secure way is by plane: there are no internal flights between Walikale and Goma, but the MONUSCO often flies from one city to the other, as well as some commercial planes. The landing strips are also very precarious. The other ways of accessing Walikale Center from Goma are by land: *Taking the Northern Road: the road crosses Masisi territory and is known for being very dangerous. The first axis when entering Walikale territory is Kibati Kibua; the road is very damaged and almost unpracticable during the rainy seasons. The second axis from Kibua to Mpofi has a good road which has been rehabilitated by the NGO AAA. However,attacks on humanitarians have been reported in the surroundings of Mpofi. Finally, the road from Mpofi to Walikale is also in relatively good conditions. Frequent check points of rebels from the FDLR have been reported in the Walikale – Kibua axis ( and more precisely, the Mpofi – Kibua axis). The overall trip in good conditions takes 10 to 15 hours but is not recommended to humanitarians, especially for the transportation of material. *Taking the Southern Road: by travelling across the Kivu Lake, either until Kalehe (if possible, according to the season and to availability of boats) or Bukavu. In both cases, the main road heading to Walikale is the N3, a national road following the axis Bukavu – Hombo (at the border with south Kivu) and then the axis Itebero – Walikale. The axis Walikale-Hombo (approximately 40 km) is almost unpracticable; very few trucks take the risk to take this road, but incidents are frequents. The most frequent, and advised, way of transport is motorbike, bikes or walking. It takes more or less 9 hours non-stop motorbike driving to reach Musenge from Walikale. From Hombo to Musenge, the axis used to be controlled by the Mayi- Mayi Kifuafua, and is now controlled by another faction of Mayi Mayi; From Musenge to Walikale via Itebero, the axis is relatively protected by the FARDC.  From Kisangani to Walikale Centre  Another possibility to access Walikale Centre is from Kisangani, the capital of the Orientale Province. It is the longest way of the three (the distance between Goma and Walikale Centre via Kisangani is more or less 1700 km) but it is the safest. From Goma, it is possible to take planes to Kisangani. The itinerary from Goma to Walikale via Kisangani is the best to transport material, as the roads are good enough for trucks. It implies crossing North Kivu, following the axis Goma - Butembo, Butembo – Komanda, Komanda – Nia Nia, Nia Nia – Bafwasende and finally Bafwasende – Kisangani. Then from Kisangani to Walikale, until Lubutu, the road follows the N3, and then secondary roads link Lubutu to Walikale Centre. The overall trip can take up to one week.  Food insecurity and emergency  In 2011, 55% of the population of Walikale has been affected by the consequences on the ongoing crisis in North-Kivu. This ongoing crisis is a security crisis but also tends to become a food crisis. Years of recurrent conflicts in Walikale has increased the vulnerability of the population and has disrupted the basic functioning of the economy and the society; without being considered as a humanitarian emergency yet, the situation in Walikale is too unstable and threatens the life of too many people to be left out of food security programs planning.Julia Grasset, Conflicts and Food security in Walikale, Sciences Po (unpublished ) 2012 The context of protracted crisis worsened food insecurity but did not totally originate it; it is essential not to limit the analysis to insecurity itself, but also to consider the root causes of food insecurity, which can vary from one region to another. Unlike some other conflicts, where armed groups' activities and insecurity directly provokes food insecurity, in the case of Walikale it appears that structural causes, historical causes of food insecurity and insecurity itself are intrinsically linked.  Historical causes  *The disruption of customary laws over access to land: these disruptions were mainly provoked by the implementation of the Bakajika law under the Mobutu area, which was based on the nationalization of land and designation of local authorities by the state. The ambiguity around the status of land is steel subject to conflicts today.Zwa, Conflict-sensitive land policy and governance in Africa, 2005 *Ethnic segregation, which started under the colonial period and was maintained under Mobutu’s dictators. This segregation was political – refusal of giving the Congolese citizenship to some ethnic group – but was also based on refusal to some ethnic groups to access land,Jean-Claude William, Banyarwanda et banyamulenge: Violences Ethniques et Gestion de l'Identitaire au Kivu, 1997 which marginalized some parts of the population and prompted the creation of self-defense groups and ethnic tensions.Mahmood Mamdami, When victims become killers: Colonialism, Nativism and the Genocide in Rwanda, 2001 *Foreign immigration during the war: the great lakes conflicts, also known as the first African World War, prompted the immigration of non Congolese ethnicities, which were later on refuted access to land; some of these ethnic groups joined or created armed groups and compensated access to land with natural resources looting and pillage of the local populations.Severine Autesserre, The trouble with the Congo, 2010 The case of Hutu immigration right after the Rwandan genocide and of the FDLR is the best example of this form of immigration.  Structural causes  *The extension of the Kahuzi- Biega National Park: the extension of this national park encroached upon the lands of rural communities which were neither consulted nor indemnified by the government. It consequently provoked resentment of behalf of the population, some of with reconverted into mining exploitation and armed groups' activities, internally displaced people and conflicts over land.UNDP, Exercice participatif d'analyse des conflits et capacités de paix pour la planification du développement dans la province du Nord-Kivu, 2008 *The wideness and density of forest which represent a shelter for armed groups and represents a real challenge to stabilization programs *The impact of internally displaced people on hosting communities and families: the growing number of IDPs represents a threat to food security as the hosting families and communities are not prepared to host and to feed extra people and sometimes do not have the means to do it. *Mining activities: the reconversion of farmers into mining activities is more and more frequent. Mining activities are more lucrative and more secure than farming. This tendency is a threat to food security as it tends to diminish agrarian and pastoral production in a context of growing food insecurity. *Access to land, which is referred to as physical access to land by the local population. The tendency of armed groups to steal their food directly from the local populations had disastrous consequences on food security. Cultivation of fields, sometimes remote from the villages, has become a dangerous activity especially for women, and some communities have decided to abandon their remote fields for security reasons.Amnesty International, Mass Rapes in Walikale: Still a need for protection and justice in Eastern Congo, 2010Timothy Raeymaekers, Conflicts and Food Security in Beni - Lubero, 2010 *Infrastructures: the lack of adequate material and infrastructures represent a restrain to food security development as it does not allow agricultural and pastoral development (for instance, total absence of vegetal and animal epidemic surveillance infrastructures or adequate treatments in local communities) Timothy Raeymaekers, Conflicts and Food Security in Beni Lubero, 2005 *Access to markets: roads infrastructures in Walikale are disastrous and worsen the isolation of some communities. The absence of trade routes does not allow some population to have access to local markets, and therefore to sell their products and buy the products they need. Not only does it provoke malnutrition and poor diets in remote regions, but it is also at the origin of food prices raise.Alinovi; Hemrich;Russo, Addressing Food Insecurity in Fragile States: case studies from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and Sudan, 2007  Politics  Walikale Territory is represented in the National Assembly by two deputies: *Elysée Munembwe (ARC) *Juvenal Munubo (UNC)  Umoja Wetu, Kimya II and Amani Leo  After the Congolese wars, Walikale territory had known a period of relative calm: surely, armed groups' activities had not ceased, \\"food lootings\\" were still frequent, and armed groups benefited from the central state’s ignorance of the region to continue their mining exploitation activities and to extend their local power. However, almost no conflicts were going on between armed groups, and neither the governmental army nor was the MONUC was interfering with their activities.GRIP, 2011 In addition, some armed groups such as the FDLR had even started to integrate into the social and economic organization of Walikale; as shown in a report by the Pole Institute dating from 2008, the FDLR had begun to constitute \\"a state within a state\\" (Rudahigwa, 2008): customary chiefs admitted at the time that an important part of Walikale territory was under control of the FDLR, who had imposed its own rules and organization. Regular collections were organized within the local population of each village, and a part of their harvest had to be given, as a sort of tax. In exchange, the FDLR protected them. Furthermore, the members of the FDLR even started to develop economic activities other than mining looting, such as farming, local trade of foodstuff or manufactured products, and even building a hospital or social infrastructures. Even though in 2008 the FDLR represented an obstacle to food security in the sense that, through their taxing system and their lack of integration within the local population, the population was deprived from an important part of their harvest, the stability they imposed to the region ensured a certain regularity of food production and trade. In addition, the vulnerability of the population was lower because the FDLR taxing system encouraged the production of foodstuff and the cultivation of land; the farmers and peasants were fewer victims of attacks and could access their camp with lesser fear than today. The growing power and activities of the FDLR in North Kivu led Kagame and Kabila to plan a joint intervention in 2009, to stop FDLR activities and to repatriate to Rwanda its combatants: this 2009 Eastern Congo offensive was named Umoja Wetu (\\"Our Unity\\" in Swahili). Judging whether this first intervention was efficient or not is irrelevant here, but two months after, in March 2009, the FDLR had grown in power again and started to lead reprisal attacks on the population. In Walikale, the consequences of these reprisals led to a food and humanitarian crisis in 2009 and marked the beginning of insecurity and violence in Walikale. (GRIP, 2011) Many \\"volunteers\\" also joined the FDLR after the Umoja Wetu operation, mostly members of the CNDP and various Mayi-Mayi groups. The FDLR therefore represented at that moment, the most powerful opposition to the FARDC and by extension, to the central government, and therefore reassembled all military groups or rebels opposed for various reasons to the Congolese government.Primo Pascal Rudahigwa, La conférence de Goma et la question des FDLR au Nord et au Sud-Kivu, Pole Institute, 2008 http://www.pole- institute.org/documents/RCN%B021.pdf The consequences on the population of Umoja Wetu were dreadful: civilians became tools of the war, and the instauration of terror, recurrent massacres, and killings that followed Umoja Wetu were exclusively meant to put a pressure on the government. The military operation Kimia II and Amani Leo, led by the FARDC and supported by MONUC (which then became MONUSCO), worsened the insecurity in Walikale: not only were civilians victims of abuses meant to force the FARDC to stop their attacks, but also, entire villages were destroyed by fighting between the FDLR and the FARDC. (GRIP, 2011) Therefore, this military operation completely destabilized the relative organization of food production and trade in Walikale. Instead of regular taxation, armed groups began to steal directly from the populations and to commit exactions in villages and on the fields. Food and rapes became weapons of the FDLR and other armed groups in Walikale, weapons that led to the current situation of food instability and humanitarian upcoming crisis. The November 2011 election was also a factor in explaining the resumption of armed groups’ activities, and in particular of FDLR activities. In fact, the accumulations of the alliance between Kabila and Kagame and of the various military operations led to the development of a real hatred on behalf of the FDLR against the government of Kabila; his reelection in November therefore provoked a movement of protest orchestrated by the FDLR, which once again was reflected as a resumption of attacks on the population and the intensification of fighting with the FARDC. According to a member of a local NGO, this resumption could also be related to the fact that the opposition was constituted by members supporting the FDLR and the Mayi-Mayi.

The Pagan River (Warraskoyak) is a tributary of the James River located in Isle of Wight County, Virginia. The colonial seaport town of Smithfield (and its National Register-listed Smithfield Historic District) sits on the banks of this river. Formed about three miles north of Smithfield, the river runs narrow until it is joined by Cypress Creek. The Pagan then opens to a large expanse of wetlands and marsh before bottle-necking into the James River. Unlike many of the tributaries along the James, it is largely untouched by development — 88 percent of its watershed is a mix of forest, pasture, grasslands and wetlands, according to a 2001 report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The Pagan, however, played an integral role in the growth of Smithfield, a town of approximately 8,000 people best known for producing Virginia hams. First settled in 1634, Smithfield became an important Hampton Roads trading port. Peanut warehouses lined the river banks until a 1921 fire prompted the industry to shift to Suffolk. Founded 15 years later, Smithfield Foods soon took its place as the town's economic engine. Following years of expansion, it is now the world's largest pork producer and processor. Its headquarters occupy a sizable portion of the town's waterfront. Yet unlike other inland waterways, such as the Hampton River, the Pagan remains largely pastoral. In 2000 about 18,000 people lived in its watershed, according to the USGS. The Hampton River, less than half the Pagan's length, had a population of nearly 75,000 at the same time.Nealon, Cory (January 13, 2010). \\"Watermen on the Pagan River face up to oysters' decline.\\" Daily Press (Virginia) The name of the river may come from the Algonquin language word for pecan (Cree pakan, Ojibway pagan, Abenaki pagann) \\"that which is cracked with a tool\\" referring to the nut.

S. pneumoniae is a common member of the bacterial flora colonizing the nose and throat of 5–10% of healthy adults and 20–40% of healthy children. However, it is also a cause of significant disease, being a leading cause of pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, and sepsis. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2005 pneumococcal infections were responsible for the death of 1.6 million children worldwide. Infections Pneumococcal meningitis Pneumococcal pneumonia represents 15%–50% of all episodes of community-acquired pneumonia, 30–50% of all cases of acute otitis media, and a significant proportion of bloodstream infections and bacterial meningitis.Verma R, Khanna P (2012) Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine: A newer vaccine available in India. Hum Vaccin Immunother 8(9) As estimated by WHO in 2005 it killed about 1.6 million children every year worldwide with 0.7–1 million of them being under the age of five. The majority of these deaths were in developing countries.  Pathogenesis  S. pneumoniae is normally found in the nose and throat of 5–10% of healthy adults and 20–40% of healthy children. It can be found in higher amounts in certain environments, especially those where people are spending a great deal of time in close proximity to each other (day-care centers, military barracks). It attaches to nasopharyngeal cells through interaction of bacterial surface adhesins. This normal colonization can become infectious if the organisms are carried into areas such as the Eustachian tube or nasal sinuses where it can cause otitis media and sinusitis, respectively. Pneumonia occurs if the organisms are inhaled into the lungs and not cleared (again, viral infection, or smoking-induced ciliary paralysis might be contributing factors). The organism's polysaccharide capsule makes it resistant to phagocytosis and if there is no pre-existing anticapsular antibody alveolar macrophages cannot adequately kill the pneumococci. The organism spreads to the blood stream (where it can cause bacteremia) and is carried to the meninges, joint spaces, bones, and peritoneal cavity, and may result in meningitis, brain abscess, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis. S. pneumoniae has several virulence factors, including the polysaccharide capsule mentioned earlier, that help it evade a host's immune system. It has pneumococcal surface proteins that inhibit complement-mediated opsonization, and it secretes IgA1 protease that will destroy secretory IgA produced by the body and mediates its attachment to respiratory mucosa. The risk of pneumococcal infection is much increased in persons with impaired IgG synthesis, impaired phagocytosis, or defective clearance of pneumococci. In particular, the absence of a functional spleen, through congenital asplenia, surgical removal of the spleen, or sickle-cell disease predisposes one to a more severe course of infection (overwhelming post-splenectomy infection) and prevention measures are indicated (see asplenia). People with a compromised immune system, such as those living with HIV, are also at higher risk of pneumococcal disease. In HIV patients with access to treatment, the risk of invasive pneumoccal disease is 0.2–1% per year and has a fatality rate of 8%. There is an association between pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza. Damage to the lining of the airways (respiratory epithelium) and upper respiratory system caused by influenza may facilitate pneumococcal entry and infection. Other risk factors include smoking, injection drug use, Hepatitis C, and COPD. Virulence factors S. pneumoniae expresses different virulence factors on its cell surface and inside the organism. These virulence factors contribute to some of the clinical manifestations during infection with S. pneumoniae. *Polysaccharide capsule—prevents phagocytosis by host immune cells by inhibiting C3b opsonization of the bacterial cells *Pneumolysin (Ply)—a 53-kDa pore-forming protein that can cause lysis of host cells and activate complement *Autolysin (LytA)—activation of this protein lyses the bacteria releasing its internal contents (i.e., pneumolysin) *Hydrogen peroxide—causes damage to host cells (can cause apoptosis in neuronal cells during meningitis) and has bactericidal effects against competing bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus) *Pili—hair-like structures that extend from the surface of many strains of S. pneumoniae. They contribute to colonization of upper respiratory tract and increase the formation of large amounts of TNF by the immune system during sepsis, raising the possibility of septic shock *Choline binding protein A/Pneumococcal surface protein A (CbpA/PspA)—an adhesin that can interact with carbohydrates on the cell surface of pulmonary epithelial cells and can inhibit complement-mediated opsonization of pneumococci * Competence for genetic transformation likely plays an important role in nasal colonization fitness and virulence (lung infectivity) Diagnosis Depending on the nature of infection an appropriate sample is collected for laboratory identification. Pneumococci are typically gram-positive cocci seen in pairs or chains. When cultured on blood agar plates with added optochin antibiotic disk they show alpha-hemolytic colonies and a clear zone of inhibition around the disk indicating sensitivity to the antibiotic. Pneumococci are also bile soluble. Just like other streptococci they are catalase-negative. A Quellung test can identify specific capsular polysaccharides. Pneumococcal antigen (cell wall C polysaccharide) may be detected in various body fluids. Older detection kits, based on latex agglutination, added little value above Gram staining and were occasionally false-positive. Better results are achieved with rapid immunochromatography, which has a sensitivity (identifies the cause) of 70–80% and >90% specificity (when positive identifies the actual cause) in pneumococcal infections. The test was initially validated on urine samples but has been applied successfully to other body fluids. Chest X-rays can also be conducted to confirm inflammation though are not specific to the causative agent.  Prevention  Due to the importance of disease caused by S. pneumoniae several vaccines have been developed to protect against invasive infection. The World Health Organization recommend routine childhood pneumococcal vaccination; it is incorporated into the childhood immunization schedule in a number of countries including the United Kingdom, United States, and South Africa.  Treatment  Throughout history treatment relied primarily on β-lactam antibiotics. In the 1960s nearly all strains of S. pneumoniae were susceptible to penicillin, but more recently there has been an increasing prevalence of penicillin resistance especially in areas of high antibiotic use. A varying proportion of strains may also be resistant to cephalosporins, macrolides (such as erythromycin), tetracycline, clindamycin and the fluoroquinolones. Penicillin-resistant strains are more likely to be resistant to other antibiotics. Most isolates remain susceptible to vancomycin, though its use in a β-lactam-susceptible isolate is less desirable because of tissue distribution of the medication and concerns of development of vancomycin resistance. More advanced beta-lactam antibiotics (cephalosporins) are commonly used in combination with other antibiotics to treat meningitis and community-acquired pneumonia. In adults recently developed fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are often used to provide empiric coverage for patients with pneumonia, but in parts of the world where these medications are used to treat tuberculosis, resistance has been described. Susceptibility testing should be routine with empiric antibiotic treatment guided by resistance patterns in the community in which the organism was acquired. There is currently debate as to how relevant the results of susceptibility testing are to clinical outcome. There is slight clinical evidence that penicillins may act synergistically with macrolides to improve outcomes. Resistant Pneumococci strains are called penicillin-resistant Pneumococci (PRP), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin resistant (SPPR), or drug-resistant Strepotococcus pneumomoniae (DRSP).  History  In the 19th century it was demonstrated that immunization of rabbits with killed pneumococci protected them against subsequent challenge with viable pneumococci. Serum from immunized rabbits or from humans who had recovered from pneumococcal pneumonia also conferred protection. In the 20th century, the efficacy of immunization was demonstrated in South African miners. It was discovered that the pneumococcus's capsule made it resistant to phagocytosis, and in the 1920s it was shown that an antibody specific for capsular polysaccharide aided the killing of S. pneumoniae. In 1936, a pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine was used to abort an epidemic of pneumococcal pneumonia. In the 1940s, experiments on capsular transformation by pneumococci first identified DNA as the material that carries genetic information. In 1900 it was recognized that different serovars of pneumococci exist and that immunization with a given serovar did not protect against infection with other serovars. Since then over ninety serovars have been discovered each with a unique polysaccharide capsule that can be identified by the quellung reaction. Because some of these serovars cause disease more commonly than others it is possible to provide reasonable protection by immunizing with less than 90 serovars; current vaccines contain up to 23 serovars (i.e., it is \\"23-valent\\"). The serovars are numbered according to two systems: the American system, which numbers them in the order in which they were discovered, and the Danish system, which groups them according to antigenic similarities.

Cherry Creek Road continues west, however the section west of Cherry Creek has never had a state route number. History Before the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's state routes, the road from US 93 to Cherry Creek was designated SR 35. The change to SR 489 was first seen on state highway maps in 1978. SR 489 remained unchanged on official maps until 1993, when the route number was removed from the state highway map. Both the paved and unpaved sections of Cherry Creek Road are now part of White Pine County Route 21.

Although its purpose and original intent has become a matter of some dispute, the book's immense and lasting influence on the history of theology and the philosophy of religion is indisputable. It consists of four parts, called \\"Pieces\\" (Stücke), originally written as a series of four journal articles. He strongly criticises ritual, superstition and a church hierarchy in this work.https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant- religion/ Royal censorship The First Piece originally appeared as a Berlinische Monatsschrift article (April 1792). Kant's attempt to publish the Second Piece in the same journal met with opposition from the king's censor. Kant then arranged to have all four pieces published as a book, routing it through the philosophy department at University of Jena to avoid the need for theological censorship. Kant was reprimanded for this action of insubordination. When he nevertheless published a second edition in 1794, the censor was so irate that he arranged for a royal order that required Kant never to publish or even speak publicly about religion. Title meaning and translations The book's title is based on a metaphor Kant introduces in the Prefaces and uses throughout the book, whereby rational religion is depicted as a naked (\\"bare\\") body while historical religions are regarded as \\"clothing\\" that are not appropriate \\"vehicles\\" for conveying religious truths to the populace. The earliest translation treats this metaphor too literally: using \\"naked\\" ignores the fact that Kant's \\"bloßen\\" can also mean \\"mere\\". The most recent translation solves this problem by using the English \\"bare\\", which also has both meanings.

The accident was blamed on a crew member who was allegedly playing with a fire suppressant system that he thought was not operative. Freon gas was released inside two compartments of the submerged submarine during the vessel's sea trials in the Sea of Japan. Victims were asphyxiated or suffered frostbite in their lungs. The high casualty count was attributed in part to the large number of civilians on board who were assisting with the testing for commissioning. Three of the dead were military personnel and the rest were civilians from the Vostok, Zvezda, Era, and Amur shipbuilding yards.Ren TV, Moscow, 2030 GMT 10 November 2008 The incident was the worst Russian submarine disaster since the sinking of Kursk in 2000.  Sequence of events  At the time of the accident, Nerpa was undergoing sea trials at the Russian Pacific Fleet's test range in Peter the Great Gulf, an inlet of the Sea of Japan adjoining the coast of Russia's Primorski Krai province. The vessel had not yet been commissioned by the Russian Navy and was undergoing plant tests under the supervision of a team from the Amursky Ship Building Plant. For this reason, it had a much larger than usual complement aboard, totaling 208 people, 81 military personnel and 127 civilian engineers from the shipyards responsible for building and outfitting the submarine. The accident occurred at 8:30 pm local time on 8 November 2008, during the submarine's first underwater test run. The submarine's fire extinguishing system was triggered, sealing two forward compartments and filling them with R-114B2 gas (dibromotetrafluoroethane, known as khladon in Russian). The gas, a hydrobromofluorocarbon refrigerant, is used in the Russian Navy's LOKh (lodochnaya obyemnaya khimischeskaya – \\"submarine volumetric chemical\\") fire- suppressant system. Each compartment of a Russian submarine contains a LOKh station from which the gas can be delivered into that or adjacent compartments.Romanov, D.A.; Moore, Kenneth J.; trans. Acus, Jonathan E. Fire at Sea: The Tragedy of the Soviet Submarine Komsomolets, p. 250. Brassey's, 2006. The gas displaces oxygen and chemically interferes with combustion, enabling it to extinguish fires rapidly in enclosed spaces. In high concentrations, it can cause narcosis, which progresses by stages into excitation, mental confusion, lethargy, and ultimately asphyxiation. Twenty people died of asphyxiation in the accident. The number of injured was initially put at 21 but was later revised to 41 by the Amurskiy Shipbuilding Company, some of whose employees were among the injured. Many of the injured were reported to have suffered from frostbite caused by the chilling effect of the gas. Following the incident, the and the rescue vessel Sayany were dispatched from Vladivostok to provide assistance to the stricken submarine. The injured survivors were transferred to the destroyer and sent to military hospitals for treatment, while the submarine returned under its own power to Primorsky Krai. According to naval spokesman Igor Digaylo, the vessel was not damaged in the incident and radiation levels remained normal.\\"Primorye flags at half-mast mourning over killed in sub accident\\". Information Telegraph Agency of Russia, 11 November 2008  Causes  Two principal explanations of the disaster have been advanced by naval experts and the media – an equipment failure or human error.  Equipment failure  The LOKh fire suppression system aboard Nerpa was reportedly of a new type that had not previously been used aboard any Russian submarine. Earlier versions of the LOKh system only operate under manual control from the duty shift console. The new system installed on Nerpa could also operate in automatic mode, responding to smoke and rises in compartment temperature and activating individually in each compartment. According to the testimony of an engineer from the Zvezda shipyard, this had malfunctioned before while the submarine was being readied for its sea trials. Some commentators speculated that the system could have been accidentally activated.  Human error  On 10 November, a Russian Navy statement blamed the disaster on an \\"unsanctioned operation\\" of the fire suppression system aboard Nerpa. Three days later, naval investigators announced that a crewman, named unofficially as Dmitry Grobov, had turned on the system \\"without permission or any particular grounds\\". According to reports in the Russian media, Grobov believed that a local control unit was not connected. Out of boredom, he started playing with it. The submarine local control units are protected by five-digit access numbers, but during sea trials, the access codes were penciled on the units. The seaman increased readings up from the original value of 30 °C to 78 °C, causing the control system to believe that a fire was on board. The control unit requested permission to start the fire-suppression system. Grobov granted permission, possibly without realizing what he was doing.Матрос запустил смертельный газ на глазах у своего командира? Komsomolskaya Pravda 15 November 2008 Матрос включил систему пожаротушения на \\"Нерпе\\" от скуки Lenta.ru 15 November 2008 He was charged and would face up to seven years in prison if convicted. In April of 2013, Grobov was acquitted by a jury. This trial followed an earlier not guilty verdict on September 14, 2011. This verdict was overruled by the Supreme Court's military board in May 2012, leading to the April retrial. Colleagues expressed skepticism at this accusation, describing the accused crewman as an experienced and skilled specialist. A number of retired naval officers told the business daily Kommersant that they doubted that Grobov was solely to blame, as one person could not activate the system due to it requiring multiple levels of confirmation before it can be activated.  Exacerbating factors  According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and may not have been alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to don breathing kits before they suffocated. Igor Kurdin, a former Typhoon-class submarine commander and the current head of the St. Petersburg Submariners Club, attributed the high casualty count to the presence of a large number of civilian specialists on the submarine at the time of the accident. Seventeen of 20 people who perished in the accident were civilians. He noted that civilian observers would be untrained in the proper response to the release of the boat's firefighting gas, which would be preceded by a specific light and sound signal, after which all on board are supposed to put on oxygen masks to allow them to survive during the 30-minute period required to ventilate the compartments before they can be reopened. In addition, because the accident occurred at 8:30 pm, many of the civilian specialists and crewmen would likely have been asleep, and unable to don their oxygen masks in time. The accident is the country's worst since the controversial 12 August 2000, sinking of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk. Mikhail Barabanov, editor-in-chief of Moscow Defense Brief, said the potential for accidental discharge of the fire-suppression system on Russian submarines is not unheard of, but this type of incident does not normally result in fatalities. However, Nerpa was carrying what he described as a \\"crowd of civilians\\" on board. The presence of the civilian shipbuilding contractors in addition to the military crewmen resulted in the vessel becoming \\"overcrowded\\". His estimation of the events that compounded the loss of life were: \\"the fire alarm failed to work, so passengers did not realize that the gas started to displace oxygen in the affected compartments.\\" Some suggested that not enough breathing kits had been available for the larger than usual number of people aboard, or that the civilians had not been properly trained in their use. Survivors stated that some breathing apparatuses had not worked or had failed after only a few minutes; some of the dead were reportedly found still wearing their breathing kits.  Official reactions   Russia  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered Defence Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov to undertake an immediate investigation into the causes of the accident. Colonel General Aleksandr Kolmakov, the First Deputy Minister of Defence, and Admiral Vladimir Vysotskiy, the Navy Commander-in- Chief, were sent to the Far East region to oversee the investigation. The President also ordered Prosecutor General Yuriy Chayka to undertake a criminal investigation of the incident and a team of officers from the Main Military Procuracy were sent to investigate the case. The Russian Navy and the governments of the Primorsky Krai and Khabarovsk Krai regions announced compensation packages to assist the families of those who lost their lives in the accident.Centre TV, Moscow. 1130 GMT, 10 November 2008  India  Initially, there were reports in Russian and Indian media of a crew from the Indian Navy heading to Vladivostok later in November 2008, where they will start \\"trainings and preparations\\" aboard Nerpa. These reports came amid speculations that Russia might lease a newly built nuclear submarine to India. Reports later confirmed that the submarine which suffered the accident was indeed the one which was planned to be leased to India. Indian naval officials said, \\"Our officials are already in Russia monitoring the submarine project; both during its construction phase and now during the sea trial phase. We are keeping a close watch on the developments.\\" Opinions were divided among analysts about the effect that the accident would have on military relations with India. A Russian defense analyst remarked that it was unlikely that the incident \\"would scare India away.\\" On the other hand, Golts stated, \\"I think this is going to be another serious blow to cooperation with India. India will be even more concerned about the quality of Russian weapons.\\" He also stated that India had desired secrecy, lest the United States apply pressure to scuttle the deal, but that with no other suppliers of such submarines, India would probably still accept the deal. The planned lease of the submarine to India was in 2008 reported to be cancelled following the incident. However, the submarine was officially inducted into the Indian Navy on 4 April 2012 as INS Chakra.

By the end of 1963 there were five assemblies and Liberian Baháʼís elected their first National Spiritual Assembly in 1975. Hosting various conferences through the '70's the community was somewhat disrupted by the First Liberian Civil War with some refugees going to Côte d'Ivoire in 1990 and the re-establishment of the National Spiritual Assembly in 1998. Third parties invited the modern Baháʼí community into their dialogues in the country while Baháʼís have continued their work supporting a private Baháʼí school, the Baháʼí Academy and a private radio station.Review of Radio Baha'i Ecuador Author: Kurt John Hein Published by: George Ronald, 1988; Review by Des O'Shea, published in CADE: Journal of Distance Education 4,1 (1989) The Association of Religion Data Archives(relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 11,691 Baháʼís in 2005. Early phase In 1916-1917 ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States and Canada asking the followers of the religion to travel to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The publication was delayed until 1919 in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919 after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. Particular plans to bring the religion to Uganda began in 1950 involving the cooperation of American, British, Egyptian, and Persian Baháʼí communities and reached a level of coordination and detail that materials were translated into languages widely used in Africa before pioneers reached Africa. Wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. In 1952, American William Fosterpioneered to Liberia as the first presence of the religion in the country and began a Baháʼí school named the Baháʼí Academy. Granadan Hermione Vera Keens-Douglas Edwards and Jamaican Julius Edwards (Knight of Baháʼu'lláh for Ghana in 1953) moved to Liberia and Foster and others helped form the first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly in 1958 in Monrovia. Mrs. Edwards served for many years under the Continental Board of Counsellors for Africa. In 1959 Muhammad Mustafa traveled to Liberia and was commissioned to explain some Muslim concerns about the Baháʼí Faith. This was ultimately published as There was a second assembly in Bomi Hills (see Tubmanburg) before 1963. Growth In 1956, the western African region with about 1000 Baháʼís was organized into the regional National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of North-West Africa including Tunisia, Algeria, the various Moroccos and Cameroons, Togolands, the Gold Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Madeira, the Canary Island, Cape Verde Islands, and St. Thomas Island. At this time the Baháʼís in Liberia had an endowment or a national center in Bomi Hills By the end of 1963 there were assemblies in Bomi Hills, Harper City, Pleebo, Gboweta, and Monrovia. There were smaller groups of Baháʼís in the a district of Gbarnga, Mano River Camp and Totota. Individual Baháʼís lived in Belefania, Gbarma, another district of Gbarnga, Harbel, Kakata, Knowoke, Lazamai, Soboreke, Suakoko, and districts of Webbo. In 1967, the Baháʼí marriage ceremony was accepted in Liberia. And Enoch Olinga also had a large influence on growth of the community including witnessing the first election of the National Spiritual Assembly in 1975. In 1971, the Baháʼís of Liberia hosted one of the Continental Conferences called for by the Universal House of Justice. The Baháʼí Faith was a recognized part of the intellectual milieu at the University of Liberia in the early 1970s. The community hosted a West African Baháʼí Women's Conference held at the University of Liberia in December 1978. However, between the First and Second Liberian Civil War stretching from 1989 to 2003, some 200 Liberian Baháʼí refugees fled to Côte d'Ivoire in 1990 and there re-elected Local Assemblies, established regular Baháʼí meetings, invested the equivalent of $20 in order to buy tools for gardens and fish ponds and by ??? about 1,000 Baháʼís and 25 Local Assemblies in the area. The use of folk art was mentioned as one reason for growth in the community - Liberian Baháʼís had established a Light of Unity Project for promoting the arts. and Baháʼí radio stations of which Liberia has one. In 1994 the first national youth conference held at which 75 youth came. By 1998, the National Spiritual Assembly was re-elected. Modern community Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio- economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. While Liberia was still in civil war Baháʼís continued to be active in and near Liberia. In 2000 a Baháʼí was among the volunteers that gave relief to refugees in Ghana. In 2002, Kathleen and Brannon Underwood pioneered in Liberia for a short time. Brannon had just retired in 2002 from a 30-year career as a professor of rehabilitation counseling in the master's program at South Carolina State University. In 2005 the United States Embassy in Liberia supported a panel discussion among religious leaders from the Islamic, Christian, and Baháʼí faiths. In 2007, the Liberian Better Future Foundation (BFF), in collaboration with the United Nations Refugee Agency, invited Baháʼí youth to be among the participants in a two-day interfaith leadership workshop in Jacob Town and Chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly in 2007, James Peabody spoke to the assemblage. Baháʼí Academy In 2004, Kathleen Underwood returned to serve as principal of the K-12 Baháʼí Academy, which was on the verge of closing. It was broke, needed to repair the roof and didn't have the means necessary to secure a license from the ministry of education have no textbooks relying solely on their instructors for information. Near the end of their studies, students must pass the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) which is administered by the West African Examinations Council. Each day the students participate in Formation, which includes the raising of the Liberian Flag, morning prayer and the recitation of the pledge to their flag. Demographics A small percentage of the Liberian population is Baháʼí, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, or atheist. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 11,691 Baháʼís in 2005.

More specifically, the effect a partner has on another's career and overall occupational status. In the past, less research had been done to observe the effects of spousal education and status position on one another because it had been assumed that the wife would adopt the husband's status. Over the past few decades, however, opportunity for women in the workplace has increased dramatically giving them a larger role in overall family income and status. Women's expanded role has brought about many changes in the opportunities for families. De Graaf, Paul M. \\"Stratification: Partner Effects.\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (Ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online Time use and productivity Partners often face time budget problems when both are working full-time. Therefore, partners have to devise a plan to balance between paid and unpaid work. Unpaid work includes domestic work around the house, such as cooking and cleaning. Couples must decide how much time each person will spend in the labor force and how much time they will spend doing domestic work. Most often this decision is weighed by comparative advantage. While this is often the most productive way to reach a balance in time, it generally places women in the domestic work and men in the labor market. Career opportunities There are two possibilities that influence a partner's career opportunities. The first possibility is that the spouse will positively effect on the other's career. This often happens when one can use their partner's social network to better themselves in the labor market. Research has also found that married men tend to make more money and increase wages at a faster rate versus single men. Research suggests that when a man gains a new partner, he loses some of the domestic responsibilities and can put forth more energy toward his job. Thorn, Elizabeth. \\"Gender, Work, and Family.\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (Ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 12 This gain in ability can be seen as a positive partner effect on a career opportunity. The second possibility of a partner's influence on a career opportunity is a negative effect. This means that by obtaining a spouse, one of the partners is now restricted in the labor force. This negative influence can be seen in the economic theory of comparative advantage. If it is more efficient for the husband to work in the labor force full-time and the wife to work at home full-time, it can be viewed as a negative effect on the wife's career. Another example of a partner's negative impact on career opportunity is when the family must move because of a job change. This is a common occurrence and can ultimately decrease the opportunities for career advancement in the new area. On the contrary, in some circumstances it can positively effect the partner and broaden their career outlook. Labor effects on health When viewing the effects of labor on health, one would assume that with more earnings, more can purchase advanced health care. While this statement is true, there can also be other factors that affect the health care of workers and their spouses. Studies have shown that there can actually be a negative effect on people when their spouses work excessive amounts. According to Ross Stolzenberg, when a man's wife works more than forty hours a week it shows largely negative effects on the husband. Strangely, women's health on the other hand is generally not affected by the number of hours their husband works.

These transitions play a major role in the development of young people's decisions and serve as a milestone which can direct them in a number of ways. There are two main types of school transitions: normative school transitions and non-normative school transitions or transfers. Frisco, Michelle L. \\"School Transitions.\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (Ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 13 November 2008 Normative school transitions Normative school transitions refer to the transitions of students from elementary school to middle school and from middle school to high school. As each transition occurs, the student generally undergoes many different changes. These changes can be anything from an increase in the size of the school, to the change in friends that one meets. Every student adapts to normative transitions differently and there are a multitude of things that influence how easily or poorly they adapt. Race, gender, location, age, and academic ability all affect the transition. According to Karen Könings from Maastricht University, the expectations students have when arriving to a new school are widely influential to how they will perform. Könings, Karen, Saskia Brand-Gruwel, Jeroen Van Merriënboer, and Nick Broers. \\"Does a new learning environment come up to students' expectations? A longitudinal study.\\" Journal of Educational Psychology 100 (2008): 535-48. PsycINFO. Academic Search Premier. Often it is among the first few weeks that students build the relationships and networks that collectively form these expectations. Non-normative school transitions/transfers School transfers refer to any transition in schooling when a child is moved from one school to another between normative transfers. These transitions are less common than normative school transitions but still happen fairly often. Often people end up making non-normative school transitions by participating in what is called the school choice program. This is a policy used by some school systems that spend public funds to give parents and students more of a say in their education. School choice often gives participants a variety of different types of schools to choose from including different charter schools, magnet programs, and tax credits for private schools. While choice schooling has seemed to cause a large increase in scores for private schooling, its effects on public schools tends to show less improvement. Davies, Scott. \\"School Choice.\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (Ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 13 November 2008 Some believe that these problems in the public schools are actually a sign of increasing inequality. While choice schooling has made it both financially and institutionally easier for people to choose where they would like to attend school, many of the lower-class families do not have the resources to send their children to the farther away magnet schools or private schools. In most cases, the lower-class parents send their children to the nearest school because there is a bus to pick them up. The wealthier families on the other hand tend to take advantage of the choice program and are able to attend the private schools and higher-rated public schools outside of the city.

It is primarily used for football matches with Konyaspor being the main tenants. It is part of complex of sports venues that are planned on the outskirts of the city, as part of the Konya Olympic Village. It replaced the aging Konya Atatürk Stadium, which has been in use since the early 1950s. The stadium has a capacity of 42,000 (all-seated) and is totally covered. The stadium is located in Selçuklu, the main district of Konya.  Details  The stadium meets all requirements of UEFA and will be a part of an ensemble with a brand new multi-sport hall, an athletic stadium, a velodrome and different multi sports areas. The stadium and the Sports Park are located on a 40 hectare spot 8 km in the north of the city center, projected by the authorities as a sports and recreation area and surrounded by a new residential area that is still under construction. The design of the new stadium is a tribute to the Konya region, its history, its traditions and its locals. It portrays an allegory of the dance of the whirling dervishes and also Konya’s reputation as a “Cycling City”. While the undulation of the round shaped tribunes are transforming the dance of the dervishes into a new dimension, the roof is designed as a “Spoke Wheel”. Especially during evening events the combination of these elements create an inimitable sign symbolizing the city of Konya. The semi transparent screen façade renders the characteristic conic shape and allows laser shows and the projection of images from outside and the inside as well. The stadium is designed as a one-tier- stadium with a formidable east and west stand – both have more than 60 rows – and will achieve a great atmosphere for the spectators, for instance the fantastic view for the VIP and the media from the west to the east stand. Furthermore, the multifunctional prepared stadium will have fitness and physiotherapy centre available and shops as well. The VIP club will be used also as a public restaurant and a rentable event location. Also the design of the north and south stands allow the extension with exclusive lounge satellites and sky gardens. As part of the accommodation concept in Konya, the Sports Park will contain several apartment buildings that will be used as dormitories and residential houses as well. Beyond that, the ecological sustainability of the stadium building will be achieved by innovative integrated measures that will effect in symbiosis long lasting benefits for the stadium operator. This measures include an integrated sun protection by a screen façade helping to minimise the need of air conditioning, a grey water use for toilets and natural green (dual water supply + rainwater) to reduce potable water use by 50%+ and the use of recyclable and low energy building materials. Furthermore, a permanent use of local high efficient cogeneration energy supply for the stadium and the residential area around is scheduled to increase the efficiency of energy production from 60% to 95% - only emergency power supply will be guaranteed by general power grid. Last but not least roof mounted solar panels will save ecological resources and reduce energy costs.

He was a brother to criminologist Friedrich Christian Benedict Avé-Lallemant (1809-1892) and music critic Theodor Avé-Lallemant (1806-1890). He earned his medical doctorate from the University of Kiel, and in 1836 relocated to Brazil, where he subsequently became director of a sanatorium for yellow fever patients in Rio de Janeiro. In 1855 he returned to Germany, and enlisted as ship's doctor for the Austrian Novara expedition with a special recommendation from Alexander von Humboldt. After the SMS Novara had crossed the Atlantic Ocean to South America in 1857, Avé-Lallemant disembarked in Rio de Janeiro, leaving the expedition. Here he found work as a physician at the Fremdenhospital, but soon afterwards began scientific exploration of the country's interior. During his second time in Brazil. he spent approximately two years performing extensive exploration of the country, having the support of Emperor Pedro II. In 1859 he returned to Lübeck, where he practiced medicine and became the author of numerous books. He published several books on his experiences in Brazil, including two major works; Reise durch Süd-Brasilien im Jahre 1858 (Journey through Southern Brazil in 1858) and Reise durch Nord-Brasilien im Jahre 1859 (Journey through Northern Brazil in 1859).

A Garside element is in general not unique: any power of a Garside element is again a Garside element. Garside monoid and Garside group A Garside monoid is a monoid with the following properties: * Finitely generated and atomic; * Cancellative; * The partial order relations of divisibility are lattices; * There exists a Garside element. A Garside monoid satisfies the Ore condition for multiplicative sets and hence embeds in its group of fractions: such a group is a Garside group. A Garside group is biautomatic and hence has soluble word problem and conjugacy problem. Examples of such groups include braid groups and, more generally, Artin groups of finite Coxeter type. The name was coined by Patrick Dehornoy and Luis Paris to mark the work on the conjugacy problem for braid groups of Frank Arnold Garside (1915–1988), a teacher at Magdalen College School, Oxford who served as Lord Mayor of Oxford in 1984–1985.

Its music is known for its nonstop sound and relentless blast beats, with regards to drummer Marc Palmen. The band has been recognized as one of the most notable grind acts in the Dutch music scene. History Erwin de Wit and Hans Smits often came together in Soos Plock, where they socialised and saw bands like Blood, Agathocles, Dreft and other bands who were into grindcore/noisecore at that time. It also was the heyday of some other underground bands such as Fear of God, Napalm Death, Sore Throat, Anal Cunt, and 7 Minutes of Nausea. These bands inspired them to go and start their own grind/noise band. Erwin was in a grindcore band called Fatal Error prior to joining Last Days of Humanity. When Erwin organised a gig with Drudge, Agathocles and some other bands on December 30, 1989, in Plock, he saw the opportunity to add their own noise project to the bill, and Last Days of Humanity was born. Last Days of Humanity at this time consisted of only two vocalists (Erwin and Hans). Their music was originally crafted by using two screaming voices that were deformed by a pitch shifter intended for guitar. In 1990, a more traditional band setup was formed when the first real gig of Last Days of Humanity was planned. They were scheduled to play on October 6, 1990, together with Fatal Error at Soos Plock. In 1993, the band went into the studio to record their second demo. In 1996, they got their first record deal. Afterwards, they booked 2 studio days to record their first album. After one day recording they only recorded approximately 12 minutes of music. Their label then informed the band that they had to come up with 18 additional minutes of new material in 24 hours, or the album would not be released. After this dispute, they quickly moved to Bones Brigade. The band split up in 2006. Bones Brigade announced that Last Days of Humanity officially reformed. The band appeared at Bloodshed Fest 2010 at the Dynamo club in Eindhoven, Netherlands, Maryland Deathfest 2011 at Sonar in Baltimore, and toured the United Kingdom in December 2011. They also appeared at Hellfest 2011 in Clisson, France, and Obscene Extreme 2011 in Czech Republic.

Their debut album, Lvl. 1, was released through Tribunal Records in 2007. Their first major label debut, Level 2, came in 2011 through Prosthetic Records. The band's third studio album, Level 3, was released on August 6, 2013. History Early years and first EP (2004−2007) Last Chance to Reason toured throughout 2005,2006 and 2007 supporting their first EP. Shows with Unearth, The Autumn Offering and As I Lay Dying helped their fan base grow. Several DIY tours and show trading helped LCTR become a staple of the central Maine metal scene. During these times the band experienced several lineup changes. It was also during this time that the band released their first music video for their song \\"SBTBATAC\\", filmed and edited by award winning director Kevin James Custer. Lvl. 1 and lineup changes (2007–2009) 2007 saw the group's first major lineup change with the departure of guitarist Dustin Boudreau, vocalist Mike Levenseller and the arrival of Bob Delaney. Delaney, a staple of the Maine music scene, became the vocalist for the band's first LP release, Lvl. 1, and would stay with the band until 2008. This also marked a change in style for the band, moving from mathcore to a more progressive based sound. Lvl. 1 was recorded, mixed and mastered by Jamie King in North Carolina and released by Tribunal Records in August 2007. Influences from video games to King Crimson saw the band take on new song structures and melodies. Touring for Lvl. 1 was intense and almost non-stop. Tours with Look What I Did and Car Bomb helped the bands fan base grow even larger. Level 2 and label signing (2009–2012) Writing for Level 2 began in late 2007 with drummer Evan Sammons and guitarist A.J. Harvey writing and recording a basic demos of the record. In September 2008 it was announced that Mike Lessard would be taking over vocal duties and Delaney would no longer be in the band, the departure was seen as amicable for both parties involved. With the vocal situation settled the band began to focus on recruiting a second guitarist, this spot would be filled by Evan Haines. However Haines would eventually be replaced by longtime friend Tom Waterhouse in the summer of 2010. After writing for Level 2 was complete, the band recruited friend and original producer of Lvl 1, Jamie King, to record the album in North Carolina. The drums and vocals were recorded entirely with King, while guitar, bass, and keyboards were recorded by the band at their Mother Brain studios in central Maine. The album was edited, mixed and mastered by King and released on April 12, 2011 through Prosthetic Records. Guitarist Thomas Waterhouse and keyboardist Brian Palmer left the band in early August 2011 during a tour of America, reducing the line-up to four again, before recruiting Mike Abdow as a replacement for Waterhouse. Level 3 (2013–present) Last Chance to Reason announced their third album, Level 3, via their Facebook page on June 20, 2013. The album was released through Prosthetic Records on August 6, 2013. The band had previously said that Level 3 would be a concept album like Level 2. The next day, the band released the first single and music video entitled \\"The Escapist\\". They also announced that they be touring from July–August in support of the album, with Evan Brewer supporting them on the tour. As well as this, it was announced that Robby Baca of The Contortionist would be filling on guitars in place of AJ Harvey and Mike Abdow, who left the band shortly after the completion of Level 3. On June 21, 2013, Mike Lessard announced that he would now be the full-time vocalist for The Contortionist and that Last Chance To Reason would become a side project, as the band had come to a standstill after the completion of Level 3. He stated that discussions had already begun between him and Robby Baca regarding The Contortionist's third album and that he would be flying back to Indianapolis after Last Chance To Reason's North American tour to begin writing the album. On the future of the band, Evan Sammons said in July 2016, \\"There's no timeline for it, but it's been no secret that we plan to make another record.\\"  Members  ;Current * Chris Corey – bass guitar (2004–present) * Evan Sammons – drums (2004–present) * A.J.

Victor Child was again among these artists when in 1934 he donated work for the André Lapine Benefit exhibition chaired by Sir Wyly Grier. During the 1920s and '30s he was on staff at the Mail & Empire and Star Weekly newspapers in Toronto as an illustrator. He married portrait painter Marjorie Thompson in 1928. Later, in 1940, he joined the Telegram and worked there until his death. Child was a decidedly conservative artist. He illustrated religious subjects for the Salvation Army and the Anglican Church of Canada and worked on instructional materials for the Toronto Board of Education. For their annual shows in 1946 and 1947 he exhibited canvases with the Ontario Society of Artists.Toronto Telegram, 13 July 1960. Perhaps the most significant moment in Canadian art history that involved Child's paintings occurred in 1959 when his work was featured in the exhibition Points of View, organized by Clare Bice, curator of the Public Library and Art Museum in London, Ontario. At this show, visitors saw the work of the traditionalist/realist Ontario Institute of Painters, of which Child was a founding member in 1958, hung beside paintings by the Canadian modernist abstract group Painters Eleven.Kay Woods, \\"A History of Painters Eleven (The Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa, Ontario, 1970)\\". artscanada (May/June 1979). Crowds of art enthusiasts, especially at Hart House in Toronto were large. As a popularity contest in critical opinion it was perhaps a draw, but the fame of the abstract artists soon far eclipsed that of the realists. Victor Child died in Toronto on July 12 of the following year.

Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre (25 June 1539, Hurstmonceaux, Sussex – 25 December 1594, Chelsea, Middlesex, England) was an English courtier. He was the son of Thomas Fiennes, 9th Baron Dacre (c. 1515-1541) and Mary Neville. His father was convicted of the murder of a gamekeeper and hanged like a common criminal at Tyburn in 1541, and the aftermath the family was stripped of its lands and titles by Henry VIII. In the following years, his mother battled to have the properties restored on behalf of her children, and on her ascension in 1558 Queen Elizabeth restored the title of Baron Dacre to Gregory, his elder brother Thomas having died of the plague at age 15. In 1565, he married Anne Sackville, daughter of Sir Richard Sackville and Winifred Brydges. They had one daughter, Elizabeth, who died young. Fiennes, his wife, and their daughter, are buried at Chelsea Old Church within a magnificent marble tomb. Fiennes also had an illegitimate daughter named Mary in about 1571, but no mention of this child is made in the tomb heraldry.

It is an American college football rivalry between the Maryland Terrapins football team of the University of Maryland and the Navy Midshipmen football team of the United States Naval Academy. The two institutions, located in close proximity in the state of Maryland, first met for a football game in 1905. Since then, the series has often been marked by controversy, with incidents by players and supporters occurring both on and off the field.Rick Snider, Ill will lingers at Navy, Maryland; Rivalry to restart in Crab Bowl, The Washington Times, page 1, August 29, 2005.Alex Baldinger, Terps meet Navy at Baltimore stadium, The Diamondback, August 31, 2005, accessed November 18, 2008. The winner of the game is awarded the Crab Bowl Trophy. A similar rivalry between the two programs is present in men's lacrosse (Maryland–Navy lacrosse rivalry). Navy dominated the series early by winning the first eight games, between 1905 and 1930, which remains the longest streak. Maryland secured its first win in 1931 at a neutral site in Washington, D.C. After two more meetings, the series was suspended in 1934 when the Maryland administration protested a play. The teams met again in 1950 when Navy had a last-minute opening in its schedule. The Terrapins won three consecutive games from 1950 to 1952, and the Midshipmen won three from 1958 to 1963. During the 1964 game, a Maryland player twice flashed an obscene gesture, which prompted Navy to cancel the series again. After contractual obligations were fulfilled with the following year's game, the series was put on hiatus for 40 years. Maryland and Navy finally resumed the rivalry in 2005 and again in 2010, with the Terps winning both contests.Maryland 23, Navy 20, ESPN, Associated Press, September 3, 2005, accessed November 20, 2008.Maryland stuns Navy 17–14, YahooSports.com, September 6, 2010, accessed September 12, 2010. Background The 1963 game program. The Naval Academy and the University of Maryland are separated by about 30 miles in the state of Maryland. The schools by their nature, a Federal service academy and a public university, differ radically in terms of culture and lifestyle. For many years, the University of Maryland possessed the reputation of a blue-collar, working-class school. Some students viewed the Naval Academy, with its strictly regimented culture, as elitist. A former Terrapins linebacker, Jerry Fishman, believed that many Midshipmen \\"thought they were far superior to the Maryland redneck coal miners.\\" A former Navy fullback, Pat Donnelly, said that compared to a \\"public institution, [the Naval Academy] was night and day. I think there was a feeling of mutual dislike, but it wasn’t personal, it was more institutional.\\" According to former Maryland head coach (and former Maryland player) Ralph Friedgen, the sentiment at Navy has been that beating their archrival \\"Army is a must, but Maryland is a necessity.\\"Play by Play , Terp Magazine, Spring 2005. Darryl Hill, who attended both schools and broke the color barrier on each team, said that the Midshipmen \\"had a saying that beating Army is great, but beating Maryland is a must.\\" Despite a lopsided start in the early 20th century, the Terps and Midshipmen were evenly matched for most of the history of the series. Between 1931 and 1965, Navy won six and Maryland five games. In the 2005 season opener, Navy was coming off one of its best seasons in history with a 10–2 record the previous year. Maryland struggled later in 2005, but proved a competitive match for Navy and achieved a last-minute win, 23–20.Terps vs. Navy – Game Day Central, University of Maryland, August 29, 2005, accessed November 19, 2008. In addition to proximity and competitiveness, the rivalry was fueled by controversial incidents both on and off the field. Maryland supporters long held that Navy players used unnecessary roughness during play, a charge counter-accused by the Academy after the 1963 game. Some Midshipmen would travel to College Park to meet female students, which served to aggravate the ill feelings. Pranks and vandalism were commonplace on both campuses and exacerbated the already tense situation between Maryland and Navy. Series history Early years: 1905–1934 A forward pass during the 1931 game.On October 25, 1905, the team then known as the Maryland Agricultural \\"Farmers\\" (or \\"Aggies\\") traveled to Annapolis to meet the Navy \\"Admirals\\" for the first time. In the first eight games of the series, Navy outscored the teams of the Maryland Agricultural College, Maryland State College (1916 and 1917), and finally, the University of Maryland (1930 onwards) by a combined margin of 256 points to 7. The 1930 game proved to be the first competitive match of the series. Navy scored the only points with a 65-yard touchdown run on the second play of the game. The remainder was a defensive struggle, and Navy and Maryland advanced to the opposing one- and nine-yard lines, respectively, before being rebuffed.Lucky Bag, Class of 1931 yearbook, United States Naval Academy, p. 431, 1930. The 1931 match-up was held for the first time at a neutral site, Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C.. In the first Maryland win of the series, the Terrapins scored the only points on a trick \\"triple-pass\\" play.Lucky Bag, Class of 1932 yearbook, United States Naval Academy, p. 391, 1931. The Maryland administration put a halt to the series in 1934 amidst claims that Navy scored the winning go-ahead, 16–13, on an illegal play after reviewing game tape. Revival: 1950–52 The series resumed in 1950 after Georgetown unexpectedly canceled a scheduled game with Navy. Maryland agreed to fill in for Georgetown and hosted the Academy for the Byrd Stadium dedication game in front of a then Washington area-record crowd of 43,836 fans.Chevy Chase Bank Field at Byrd Stadium , University of Maryland, accessed November 20, 2008. The two teams last met in 1934, and since that time the Terrapins had hired head coach Jim Tatum. Tatum, an innovator of the split-T offense, had brought consistent success to Maryland in the intervening years.Gary King, The Forgotten Man of Oklahoma Football: Jim Tatum , Sooner Magazine, University of Oklahoma Foundation, Inc., Spring 2008, retrieved 17 December 2008. Fearing a renewal of post-game mischief, the Midshipmen attending the match were given strict orders: \\"Behave like gentlemen and go straight home after the Maryland–Navy football game in College Park tomorrow. No midshipmen will enter the goal post activity or other altercation following the game.\\" A Terrapin tackles a Midshipman in the 1952 game. Newspapers predicted that Navy would win the 1950 game due to the inexperience of the Maryland quarterbacks, who were led by 19-year-old sophomore Jack Scarbath.Terrapin, Class of 1951 yearbook, University of Maryland, p. 281. A week before, Scarbath had his first start in a 27–7 loss to Georgia, but he would later become one of Maryland's greatest quarterbacks and the 1952 Heisman Trophy runner-up.1952 – 18th Award , Heisman.com, retrieved February 10, 2009.Year-By-Year Results, 2007 Terrapin Football Record Book, University of Maryland, 2007, retrieved February 10, 2009. In the first quarter against Navy, Scarbath scored on a quarterback keeper. Before the half, he completed passes to ends Stan Karnash and Pete Augsburger for 44- and 59-yard touchdowns. In the third quarter, the Midshipmen responded with a score of their own. In the final period, Maryland end Elmer Wingate returned an interception 34 yards for another touchdown. Then, 54 seconds later, end Lew Weidensaul recovered a Midshipmen fumble, which allowed Ed Modzelewski to rush five yards for the final score by the Terrapins. Navy scored twice more, but Maryland held on to win, 35–21. In 1951, pranks soon returned to the two campuses. Midshipmen were caught in the act of painting the letter \\"N\\" on various buildings on the Maryland campus and defacing the grass with the Navy emblem. Early in the 1951 game, Navy's Frank Brady returned a punt 100 yards to take the lead, 7–0. It was the only time of Maryland's undefeated season that they trailed an opponent. The Terrapins responded, and by the end of the third quarter, they had taken the game in hand, 34–7. Against the stubborn Navy line, Scarbath resorted to the pass more than usual, and completed 16 of 34 for 285 yards. Despite a late Midshipmen surge, Maryland held on for the win, 40–21.Terrapin, Class of 1952 yearbook, University of Maryland, p. 171. Navy resurgence: 1958–1963 Maryland struggled after the departure of Jim Tatum, and, in the next meeting in 1958, Navy routed them, 40–14. In 1959, Maryland students painted a presumptive final score of \\"Maryland 59, Navy 0\\" on the statue of Tecumseh in front of Bancroft Hall. The prediction was off the mark, as first-year head coach Wayne Hardin and future Heisman-winning halfback Joe Bellino helped Navy to a victory, 22–14.Ted Patterson and Edwin H. Remsberg, Football in Baltimore, 2000, JHU Press, . In the early 1960s, the Terrapins were coached by former Florida State head coach Tom Nugent. While with the Seminoles, Nugent had wanted to recruit a black player, but felt the racial climate there was unsuitable. He said that \\"the head of the Ku Klux Klan lived in Tallahassee. You'd come to your car and there'd be a notice on it announcing a Klan meeting that night.\\" When he took over at Maryland in 1959, Nugent saw his opportunity. He instructed the Terrapins' quarterbacks coach Lee Corso to find a black player who was academically and athletically suited to come to College Park. Corso had been impressed by Roger Staubach's preferred receiver, Darryl Hill, during a freshman match between Maryland and Navy, and had also heard a rumor that he was considering leaving the Naval Academy. In 1962, Corso convinced Hill to transfer to Maryland, a school that had just 32 African- Americans in its 35,000 student body, and become the first black player in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Once there, Hill quickly befriended the team's only Jew, linebacker Jerry Fishman.Tom D'Angelo, \\"Barriers made to be broken\\", University of Maryland, October 25, 2006, accessed January 17, 2008. Middle-finger incident: 1964 Roger Staubach (#12) gets rid of the ball as Jerry Fishman (#31) and others close in.Before the 1964 game, Maryland supporters stole the Navy mascot, Bill the Goat, but what happened in the game itself was far more controversial.Mark Selig, \\"Old rivalry revisited\\", The Diamondback, August 31, 2005, accessed January 17, 2008. Terrapin players said they would seek revenge against Navy for roughing up Darryl Hill in 1963. Roger Staubach, Navy's Heisman Trophy quarterback, said that \\"it was not a friendly game ... Jerry [Fishman] did not have friendliness in his eyes. He had an extra mean streak that day.\\" After a punt return, Fishman was penalized for a hard hit that injured receiver Skip Orr directly in front of the Navy stands, intensifying the ever-present heckling from the crowd. In response, Fishman approached the Brigade of Midshipmen section and raised an extended middle finger. After Fishman was penalized again for a late hit on Staubach, Fishman gave the obscene gesture for a second time. High-ranking Navy officers noticed Fishman's middle finger and became incensed. Staubach later said that Fishman \\"told the fans he thought Maryland was number one and got his fingers wrong.\\" Due to Fishman's actions, Academy officials allowed their contractual obligation to the series to lapse after the 1965 game. Years later, Bud Thalman, Navy sports information director at the time, said the incident had taken place \\"when there was still some level of sportsmanship in athletes ... It was so out of character it was stunning. There was no inclination from Navy to seek out a renewal. That untoward act of sportsmanship created a bad taste among people.\\" Navy head coach Wayne Hardin called Fishman's act \\"a disgrace to college football.\\" Maryland's head coach, Tom Nugent, had a different opinion and said, \\"Both teams appeared to be just a bunch of red-blooded guys trying to kill each other.\\" The game itself was closely contested. Staubach completed 25 passes, but also threw two interceptions. Late in the fourth quarter, Navy took the lead, 22–21. With less than three minutes remaining, the Midshipmen kicked off and halfback Ken Ambrusko fielded the ball from the Terrapins' endzone. Ambrusko returned it 101 yards for a touchdown, and Maryland won the game, 27–22.Terrapin, Class of 1965 yearbook, University of Maryland, p. 238–241. Despite his later assertions to the contrary, Maryland backup quarterback Jim \\"King\\" Corcoran did not play in the game. Corcoran, Fishman and some of the other Terrapins had defeated Staubach as freshmen on their respective universities' junior varsity teams in 1961.Matt Schudel, Jim Corcoran Dies; 'Poor Man's Joe Namath' Reigned in Minor League Football, The Washington Post, August 1, 2009. Another revival: 2005 Josh Wilson (#4) dives to tackle slotback Reggie Campbell (#7). In 1997, Maryland had a new head coach, Ron Vanderlinden, and he immediately saw that Navy was a natural rival for his team, but was unaware of the past history. Vanderlinden attempted to renew the game, but it was not until after his relief that the idea materialized.Will 33-year grudge end?, The Washington Post, February 2, 1997. In 2001, Ralph Friedgen was hired as his successor and spearheaded efforts to reinvigorate the team's old rivalries, including that against Navy. Friedgen, who played for Maryland as an offensive guard, was at the 1964 game as a recruit. He had also coached for nine years as Georgia Tech's offensive coordinator, and he harbored nostalgic feelings for a rivalry with the passion of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. Friedgen stated that, in addition to the rivalries with West Virginia and Virginia, a renewed in-state series would be even more meaningful.David Ginsburg, Navy, Maryland to Resume Football Rivalry In 2005, University of Maryland, Associated Press, October 29, 2002, accessed November 20, 2008.Jeff Barker, \\"Terps want big buildup\\", The Baltimore Sun, August 4, 2008, accessed November 19, 2008. In 2002, the two schools agreed to meet for the first Crab Bowl Classic in forty years, scheduled for 2005. The 2005 game was played at the M&T; Bank Stadium in Baltimore and attended by 67,809 fans. The game was a close contest marked by costly Maryland turnovers and Navy penalties. A Sam Hollenbach interception helped Navy to end the first quarter with a 14–3 lead. Immediately before halftime, Maryland kicked a field goal and another third-quarter field goal narrowed the deficit to 14–9. Both Maryland and Navy rushed for touchdowns and failed to make two-point conversions in the final quarter. Maryland took over on their own 18-yard line after the Navy kick, trailing 20–15 with 4:37 left on the clock. Hollenbach then engineered a 12-play, 82-yard drive capped by an 11-yard touchdown pass and a two-point conversion. Navy took over with one minute left, and completed a first down on their 33-yard line before an interception sealed the game for the Terps 23–20.Terps Outlast Midshipmen, University of Maryland Terrapins, Associated Press, September 3, 2005, accessed November 20, 2008. Bowl game snubs: 2006–08 In the next postseason, Maryland declined an invitation to face Navy in the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. Instead, the Terps had their sights on the Champs Sports Bowl, to play Purdue in Orlando. According to Maryland athletic director Deborah Yow and coach Friedgen, the decision was based on the players' preference, a bigger school pay-out, warmer weather, a Big Ten opponent, and more media exposure. Also, the Champs Sports Bowl was deemed to be the fourth-most prestigious non-BCS bowl while the Meineke game was number-six.Mike Burke, \\"Navy feels snubbed by Terps; what else is new?\\", Cumberland Times-News, August 8, 2007, accessed January 17, 2008. Navy athletic director Chet Gladchuk stated that Maryland's snub was the basis for their rejection of Maryland offers to renew the series in 2010: \\"The stage was set for everything we had talked about, and all the good things that could have happened for fans—a big rematch, a bowl setting, a great city ... It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do something else. That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship.\\" Ralph Friedgen responded by saying \\"He's gotta get over it,\\" and that the Navy rivalry never entered into the decision-making process. snap during the 2005 game. In 2008, Navy accepted a bid to play an ACC team in the inaugural EagleBank Bowl at Washington D.C.'s RFK Stadium. Maryland officials said they could not accept an invitation to the game due to it conflicting with the school's final exams.Patrick Stevens, ACC pick for D.C. bowl uncertain, The Washington Times, 2 December 2008. Gladchuk said, \\"We have exams that week, too, but we're going to show up ... Everybody has an excuse why they can't do this or can't do that. We're finding a way to accommodate the bowl's situation.\\"Heather Dinich, Navy, Maryland meant to be rivals, ESPN, 2 December 2008. The Maryland staff reevaluated the EagleBank Bowl but determined it was impossible as many players had an exam on the game date. Yow said, \\"There are people who are at [academic] risk and need every moment of that week to prepare for the exams.\\"Jeff Barker and Don Markus, \\"Boise for Terps—or Detroit?\\", The Baltimore Sun, December 3, 2008. As a result, Navy played Wake Forest for the second time of the season in the EagleBank Bowl and Maryland traveled to Boise, Idaho to play Nevada in the Humanitarian Bowl.2008–09 Bowl schedule/results, ESPN, accessed January 24, 2009. Future of the series: 2010– In 2007, the two teams agreed to schedule a rematch for September 6, 2010.Maryland and Navy Agree to 2010 Football Game , University of Maryland, October 24, 2007. Deborah Yow stated that, \\"The citizens of Maryland have made it clear they want this game.\\" Alluding to the Navy athletic staff's perceived reticence, she added, \\"We got past the Charlotte situation.\\" The delay in scheduling was attributed to the need for a three-way contract between Maryland, Navy, and the stadium tenants, the Baltimore Ravens. For this reason, a renewal as far off as 2014 was not seriously discussed.Heather Dinich, Maryland vs. Navy, The Baltimore Sun, October 24, 2007. Ralph Friedgen said, \\"I would like to see it as an annual game, but that's not for me to decide.\\"Andrew Zuckerman, Football will play Navy in 2010, The Diamondback, October 25, 2007. M&T; Bank Stadium before the 2010 Crab Bowl ClassicThe 2010 game would be the first to award the Crab Bowl Trophy to the winner. 69,348 fans turned out to see the game at M&T; Bank Stadium in Baltimore, which was considered a home game for Maryland. Navy dominated the game statistically, controlling the ball for nearly 40 minutes and gaining 485 yards. The Midshipmen also converted 10 of 18 third-down chances. But their errors and failure to convert near the goal line cost them dearly. Navy kicker Joe Buckley missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, quarterback Ricky Dobbs lost a fumble at the Maryland 1-yard line, and Maryland eventually walked away with a 17–14 victory. As of 2017, there are no future football games scheduled between Navy and Maryland. Trophy In 2010, the Touchdown Club of Annapolis commissioned the Crab Bowl Trophy, with underwriting by the D'Camera group. The trophy is a large \\"pewter bowl overflowing with pewter crabs\\", meant to be replicas of the Chesapeake Bay blue crab. The bowl \\"rests atop a mahogony base\\", engraved with \\"the results of the twenty previous Maryland-Navy games\\", which reach back to the rivalry's origin in 1905. It was designed by Tilghman Company, a family-owned jewelry store in Annapolis, Maryland. The Touchdown Club, founded in 1954, has been associated with both teams for a long time, and annually hosts a dinner honoring both teams.

History In 1892, the Italian explorer Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti for the first time labeled as Somalia the region in the Horn of Africa referred to as Benadir. The area was at the time under the joint control of the Somali Geledi Sultanate (who, also holding sway over the Shebelle region in the interior, was at the height of its power) and the Omani Sultan of Zanzibar.I. M. Lewis, A modern history of Somalia: nation and state in the Horn of Africa, (Westview Press: 1988), p.38 Italian Somaliland  In April 1905, the Italian government acquired control (from a private Italian company called SACI) of this coastal area around Mogadishu, and created the colony of Italian Somaliland. From the outset, the Italians signed protectorate agreements with the local Somali authorities.Mariam Arif Gassem, Somalia: clan vs. nation, (s.n.: 2002), p.4 In doing this, the Kingdom of Italy was spared bloody rebellions like those launched by the Dervish leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (the so-called \\"Mad Mullah\\") over a period of twenty-one years against the British colonial authorities in northern Somalia, an area then referred to as British Somaliland.Laitin, David. Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience Section: Italian Influence. p. 73 In 1908, the borders with Ethiopia in the upper river Shebelle River (Uebi- Scebeli in Italian) were defined, and after World War I, the area of Oltregiuba (l\\"Beyond Juba\\") was ceded by Britain and annexed to Italian Somaliland. The dawn of Fascism in the early 1920s heralded a change of strategy for Italy. With the arrival of Governor Cesare Maria De Vecchi on 15 December 1923, the then-ruling northeastern Somali Sultanes were soon to be forced within the boundaries of La Grande Somalia. Italy hitherto had access to these areas under various protection treaties, but not direct rule. Under its new leadership, Italy mounted successive military campaigns against the Somali Sultanate of Hobyo and Majeerteen Sultanate, eventually defeating the Sultanates' troops and exiling the reigning Sultans. The colonial troops called dubats and the gendarmerie zaptié were extensively used by De Vecchi in this military campaign. Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, founder of the Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi, the main agricultural settlement in Italian Somaliland. In the early 1930s, the new Italian governors, Guido Corni and Maurizio Rava, started a policy of assimilation of the local populace, enrolling many Somalis in the Italian colonial troops. Some thousands of Italian settlers also began moving to Mogadishu as well as agricultural areas around the capital, such as Genale and the Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi.Bevilacqua, Piero. Storia dell'emigrazione italiana. p. 233 In 1928, the Italian authorities built the Mogadishu Cathedral (Cattedrale di Mogadiscio). It was constructed in a Norman Gothic style, based on the Cefalù Cathedral in Cefalù, Sicily. Following its establishment, Crowned Prince Umberto II made his first publicized visit to Mogadishu. Crowned Prince Umberto I would make his second publicized visit to Italian Somaliland in October 1934. In 1936, Italy then integrated Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Italian Somaliland into a unitary colonial state called Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana), thereby enlarging Italian Somaliland from 500,000 km2 to 700,000 km2 with the addition of the Ogaden and so creating the Somalia Governorate. From 1936 to 1940, new roads such as the \\"Imperial Road\\" from Mogadishu to Addis Abeba were constructed in the region, as were new schools, hospitals, ports and bridges. New railways were also built, such as the famous Mogadishu-Villabruzzi Railway (Italian: Ferrovia Mogadiscio-Villabruzzi). During the first half of 1940, there were about 50,000 Italians living in Italian Somaliland. In urban areas, the colony was one of the most developed on the continent in terms of standard of living.Tripodi, Paolo. The Colonial Legacy in Somalia. p. 66 In the late 1930s the triangle area between Italian Mogadiscio, Merca and Villabruzzi was fully developed in agriculture (with a growing export of bananas to Europe), but was even experiencing an initial industrial development thanks to the presence of asphalted roads, railways, and a new international airport & port in the capital. In the second half of 1940, Italian troops invaded British Somaliland and ejected the British. The Italians also occupied areas bordering Jubaland around the villages of Moyale and Buna. However, Britain retained control of the almost exclusively Somali- inhabited Northern Frontier District.Africa Watch Committee, Kenya: Taking Liberties, (Yale University Press: 1991), p.269Women's Rights Project, The Human Rights Watch Global Report on Women's Human Rights, (Yale University Press: 1995), p.121Francis Vallat, First report on succession of states in respect of treaties: International Law Commission twenty-sixth session 6 May-26 July 1974, (United Nations: 1974), p.20 In the spring of 1941, Britain regained control of British Somaliland and conquered Italian Somaliland with the Ogaden after some months of bloody fighting in all Italian East Africa. However, until the summer of 1943, there was an Italian guerrilla war in all the areas of the former Italian East Africa. After World War II During the Second World War, Britain occupied Italian Somaliland and militarily administered the territory as well as British Somaliland. Faced with growing Italian political pressure inimical to continued British tenure and Somali aspirations for independence, the Somalis and the British came to see each other as allies. The first modern Somali political party, the Somali Youth Club (SYC), was subsequently established in Mogadishu in 1943; it was later renamed the Somali Youth League (SYL).I. M. Lewis, A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa, (LIT Verlag Münster: 1999), p. 304. A voting registration card in Mogadishu during the British military administration (1949). In 1945, the Potsdam conference was held, where it was decided not to return Italian Somaliland to Italy.Federal Research Division, Somalia: A Country Study, (Kessinger Publishing, LLC: 2004), p.38 and that the territory would be under British Military Administration (BMA). As a result of this failure on the part of the Big Four powers to agree on what to do with Italy's former colonies, Somali nationalist rebellion against the Italian colonial administration culminated in violent confrontation in 1948. 24 Somalis and 51 Italians died in the ensuing political riots in several coastal towns. In November 1949, the United Nations finally opted to grant Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition—first proposed by the Somali Youth League (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (later Hizbia Dastur Mustaqbal Somali, or HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL), that were then agitating for independence—that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.Zolberg, Aristide R., et al., Escape from Violence: Conflict and the Refugee Crisis in the Developing World, (Oxford University Press: 1992), p.106Gates, Henry Louis, Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience, (Oxford University Press: 1999), p.1749 Despite the initial unrest, the 1950s were something of a golden age for the nearly 40,000 remaining Italian expatriates in Italian Somaliland. With United Nations funds pouring in and experienced Italian administrators who had come to see the territory as their home, infrastructural and educational development blossomed. Relations between the Italian settlers and the Somalis were also generally good. This decade passed relatively without incident and was marked by positive growth in many sectors of local life. The economy was controlled by the Bank of Italy through emissions of the Somalo shilling, that was used as money in the Italian administered region from 1950 to 1962. In 1960, Italian Somaliland declared its independence and united with British Somaliland in the creation of modern Somalia. In 1992, after the fall of the Siad Barre administration, Italian troops returned to Somalia to help restore peace during Operation Restore Hope (UNISOM I & II). Operating under a United Nations mandate, they patrolled for nearly two years the southern riverine area around the Shebelle River.Tripodi, Paolo. The Colonial Legacy in Somalia p. 88 By the early nineties, there were just a few dozen Italian colonists left. All were elderly and still concentrated in Mogadishu and its surroundings. The last Italian colonist, Virginio Bresolin, died in Merka in early 2010. Italian population in Somalia After the conquest of Ethiopia in 1936, Italian Somaliland was expanded by the Italian government with the annexation of the Ogaden region. The first Italians moved to Somalia at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1923, there were fewer than a thousand Italians in Italian Somaliland. However, it was not until after World War I that this number rose, with the settlers primarily concentrated in the towns of Mogadishu, Kismayo, Brava, and other cites in the south-central Benadir region. The colonial period emigration to Italian Somaliland initially mainly consisted of men. Emigration of entire families was only later promoted during the Fascist period, mainly in the agricultural developments of the Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi (Jowhar), near the Shebelle River. In 1920, the Societa Agricola Italo-Somala (SAIS) was founded by the Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in order to explore the agricultural potential of central Italian Somaliland and create a colony for Italian farmers. The area of Janale in southern Somalia (near the Jubba River) was another place where Italian colonists from Turin developed a group of farms. Under governor De Vecchi, these agricultural areas cultivated cotton, and after 1931, also produced large quantities of banana exports. In 1935, there were over 50,000 Italians living in Italian Somaliland. Of those, 20,000 resided in Mogadishu (called Mogadiscio in Italian), representing around 40% of the city's 50,000 residents. Other Italian settler communities were concentrated in the Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi, Adale (Itala in Italian), Janale, Jamame, and Kismayo. The same year, during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, there were more than 220,000 Italian soldiers stationed in Italian Somaliland.Nicolle, David, \\"The Italian Invasion of Abyssinia 1935–1936\\", p. 41 By March 1940, over 30,000 Italians lived in Mogadishu, representing around 33% of the city's total 90,000 residents. They frequented local Italian schools that the colonial authorities had opened, such as the Liceum. Italian Somalis were concentrated in the cities of Mogadishu, Merca, Baidoa, Kismayo and the agricultural areas of the riverine Jubba and Shebelle valleys (around Jowhar/Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi). After World War II, the number of Italians in Somali territory started to decrease. By 1960 and the establishment of the Somali Republic, their numbers had dwindled to less than 10,000. Most Italian settlers returned to Italy, while others settled in the United States, United Kingdom, Finland and Australia. In 1972, there were 1,575 Italians remaining in Somalia, down from 1,962 in 1970. This decline was largely due to the nationalization policy adopted by the Siad Barre administration. By 1989, there were only 1,000 of the settlers left, with fewer after the start of the civil war and the fall of the Barre regime in 1991. Many Italian Somalis had by then departed for other countries. With the disappearance of Italians from Somalia, the number of Roman Catholic adherents dropped from a record high of 8,500 parishioners in 1950 (0.7% of Mogadishu's population) to just 100 individuals in 2004. { border=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" style=\\"border: 1px solid #999; background-color:#FFFFFF\\" -align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffbbbb\\" ! year !!

It was concentrated in the area around the triangle Mogadishu – Merca – Jowhar (the most developed region in those decades). An Italian ambassador in the 1990s believed that the wide practice of concubinage during the colonial years had created a kind of \\"ethnic community\\" with nearly 50,000 Somalis who had at least one grandfather or a great-grandfather Italian-born. It is a situation similar to the one documented in former Italian Eritrea. There are about 15,500 direct descendants of Italians colonists & military in Eritrea, because of concubinage (in Italian) However, in the 2010s the Somalis who declare they have Italian ancestors are only a few thousands, concentrated mainly in Mogadishu and surroundings. Italian language in Somalia Prior to the Somali civil war, the legacy of Italian influence in Somalia was evinced by the relatively wide use of the Italian language among the country's ruling elite. Until World War II, the Italian language was the only official language of Italian Somaliland. Italian was official in Italian Somaliland during the Fiduciary Mandate, and the first years of independence. By 1952, the majority of Somalis had some understanding of the language. In 1954, the Italian government established post-secondary institutions of law, economics and social studies in Mogadishu. These institutions were satellites of the University of Rome, which provided all the instruction material, faculty and administration. All the courses were presented in Italian. By the end of the trust period in 1960, over 200,000 people in the nascent Somali Republic spoke Italian. In 1964, the institutions offered two years of study in Somalia, followed by two years of study in Italy. After a military coup in 1969, all foreign entities were nationalized, including Mogadishu's principal university, which was renamed Jaamacadda Ummadda Soomaliyeed (Somali National University). Until 1967, all schools in central and southern Somalia taught Italian. In 1972, the Somali language was officially declared the only national language of Somalia, though it now shares that distinction with Arabic. Due to its simplicity, the fact that it lent itself well to writing Somali since it could cope with all the sounds in the language, and the already widespread existence of machines and typewriters designed for its use,Andrew Simpson, Language and National Identity in Africa, (Oxford University Press: 2008), p. 288 the government of Somali president Mohamed Siad Barre, following the recommendation of the Somali Language Committee that was instituted shortly after independence with the purpose of finding a common orthography for the Somali language, unilaterally elected to only use the Latin script for writing Somali instead of the long-established Arabic script and the upstart Osmanya script.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.73 During this period, Italian remained among the languages used in higher education. In 1983, nine out of the twelve faculties in the Somali National University used Italian as the language of instruction. Until 1991, there was also an Italian school in Mogadishu (with courses of Middle school and Liceum), later destroyed because of the civil war. The Somali language also contains a few Italian loanwords that were retained from the colonial period. The most widely used is ciao, meaning goodbye. As part of a broader governmental effort to ensure and safeguard the primacy of the Somali language, the post-independence period in Somalia saw a push toward replacement of such foreign loanwords with their Somali equivalents or neologisms. To this end, the Supreme Revolutionary Council during its tenure officially prohibited the borrowing and usage of Italian and English terms. Alongside English, Italian was declared a second language of Somalia by the Transitional Federal Government in the Transitional Federal Charter adopted in 2004. Somali (Maay and Maxaa-tiri) and Arabic were the official national languages.According to article 7 of Transitional Federal Charter for the Somali Republic: The official languages of the Somali Republic shall be Somali (Maay and Maxaatiri) and Arabic. The second languages of the Transitional Federal Government shall be English and Italian. Following the adoption of the Provisional Constitution in 2012 by the Federal Government of Somalia, Somali and Arabic were retained as sole official languages.According to article 5 of Provisional Constitution : The official language of the Federal Republic of Somalia is Somali (Maay and Maxaa-tiri), and Arabic is the second language.

The declaration asserted Estonia's sovereignty and the supremacy of the Estonian laws over the laws of the Soviet Union. Estonia's parliament also laid claim to the republic's natural resources: land, inland waters, forests, mineral deposits and to the means of industrial production, agriculture, construction, state banks, transportation, municipal services, etc. in the territory of Estonia's borders. November 16 is now celebrated annually as the \\"Day of Declaration of Sovereignty\\" (\\"Suveräänsuse deklareerimise päev\\"). Overview Estonia gained independence in the aftermath of World War I and Estonian War of Independence (1918–1920). In 1940 as a consequence of the German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact and its Secret Additional Protocol of August 1939 Estonia was occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union. The majority of Western nations refused to recognize the incorporation of Estonia de jure by the Soviet Union and only recognized the government of the Estonian SSR de facto or not at all. Such countries recognized Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian diplomats and consuls who still functioned in the name of their former governments. These aging diplomats persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of Baltic independence.Diplomats Without a Country: Baltic Diplomacy, International Law, and the Cold War by James T. McHugh, James S. Pacy, Page 2. In the 1980s new policies of Perestroika and Glasnost were introduced and political repression in the Soviet Union came to an end. As a result, during the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt a 20 August 1991 declaration proclaimed the reestablishment of the independent Estonian republic almost three years after the declaration was made, becoming the last of the Baltic republics to declare the reestablishment of independence (after Lithuania and Latvia in 1990). On September 6, 1991, the Soviet Union recognized the independence of Estonia and the country was admitted to the UN on September 17. After more than three years of negotiations, on August 31, 1994, the armed forces of Russia withdrew from Estonia. The Russian Federation officially ended its military presence in Estonia after it relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in Paldiski in September 1995. Estonia joined the European Union in May 2004, shortly after it became a member of NATO, and later joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2010.

He is the First Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of Government Business in Parliament. He was appointed to that position on 6 June 2016. He previously served in the Cabinet of Uganda as Third Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of Government Business from May 2011 until June 2016. He has also been the elected Member of Parliament for East Moyo County in Adjumani District since 2011. Background and education Moses Ali hails from Adjumani District, West Nile sub-region, in Northern Uganda. He was born on 5 April 1939. He holds the degree of Bachelor of Laws (LLB), obtained from Makerere University. He also holds the Diploma in Legal Practice, from the Law Development Center in Kampala. Moses Ali also holds qualifications from military educational institutions in Uganda, Israel and the United Kingdom. He is a Muslim.https://semuwemba.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/nubians-of-east- africa.pdf Career Ali was involved in the 1971 Ugandan coup d'état that overthrew President Milton Obote and brought Idi Amin to power. He consequently rose in the ranks during the duration of the Second Republic of Uganda, when Amin ruled the country as military dictator. Ali was appointed Minister of Finance, and used his position to organize an Islamic charity. This garnered him a lot of popular support, but also raised Amin's suspicions, as he feared Ali was attempting to construct a Muslim political base of support. In April 1978, the President organized a meeting in the capital Kampala, where he railed against ministers whom he deemed disloyal, too powerful or incompetent, including Ali. Accusing the Minister of Finance of mismanaging the Bank of Uganda and gross corruption, Amin became so angry during his speech that he threw a trashcan at Ali. Having realized that his situation was untenable, Ali get away as soon as possible. He quietly snuck out of Kampala in his private car and fled to his home in the West Nile region. When got there, however, a group of hitmen attacked him, but he fended them off in a gunfight. Ali was convinced that his downfall and the attempted assassination had been organized by the Uganda Army commander Yusuf Gowon, a long-time rival of his. Amin subsequently stripped him of all of his military honours. When Amin's regime collapsed during the Uganda–Tanzania War of 1978—1979, Ali fled into exile in southern Sudan, finding refuge in Nimule. In the 1980s he led the Uganda National Rescue Front (UNRF) in an armed rebellion against the government of reinstated President Milton Obote, and became a warlord ruling a fief in southern Sudan. Using his influence and military poweress to his advantage, Ali eventually negotiated a favorable deal with Yoweri Museveni who took power as President at the Ugandan Bush War's end in 1986. His forces were integrated into Uganda's new national army, the National Resistance Army which later became the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF), and he was appointed a Major General. As a result of his powerful position in Uganda's new government and military, Ali became highly influential and quite wealthy. Ali even rose to First Deputy Prime Minister in Museveni's government. He served in the Ugandan Parliament from 2001. He was further promoted to Lieutenant General on 13 March 2003, but lost both his parliamentary seat and his ministerial appointment in 2006. In 2011, at the age of 72, he regained his position in parliament and was assigned new cabinet responsibilities. In the next year, Ali was once again promoted to the rank of General in the UPDF. In 2016, following his re-election to parliament, he was again appointed First Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of Government Business in Parliament.

It encompasses the old town of Kotor (Italian Cattaro), the fortifications of venetian Cattaro), and the surrounding region of the inner Bay of Kotor. Description Old town of Kotor The old town of Kotor (called historically \\"Cattaro la Veneziana\\"Italian Cattaro) is contained within the city walls and a well preserved and restored medieval cityscape with notable buildings including the Cathedral of Saint Tryphon (built in 1166). The Cathedral of Saint Tryphon Kotor was heavily damaged during the earthquake on April 15, 1979, and this prompted the site to be also listed on the Danger List in 1979 when the site was inscribed. After significant rehabilitation within the town, the site was taken off this list in 2003. Fortifications of Kotor The fortifications consist of a system of defensive military buildings to protect the medieval town of Kotor. They include the city walls with gates and bastions, ramparts that ascend the mountain of St. John, the castle of St. John (San Giovanni), and supportive structures. While some of the structures date back to Roman and Byzantine times, most of the fortifications were erected during the Venetian rule; later some modifications were made by the Austrians. The fortifications are the most significant aspect of the World Heritage site. Region of Kotor The region that is included in the heritage is the inner bay of Kotor (past the Verige strait) with its surrounding mountains and towns, notably Risan and Perast in addition to Kotor. Further the islets of St. George (Sveti Đorđe) and Our Lady of the Rocks (Gospa od Škrpijela) are part of the heritage site. Preservation In 1979, when the site was inscribed it was also placed on the List in Danger due to earthquake damage. Due to concerted international efforts much of this, specifically concerning the city of Kotor, has been mitigated. In 2003 the site could be taken off the danger list. The heritage site faces challenges in a number of ways. Natural dangers such as erosion and earthquakes will always remain a threat. More acute, however, is the impact of human activity. Thus some urban development has been noted to be incongruent with the goals of preservation. An issue has been the proposal to bridge the Verige strait: the proposed Verige bridge between Cape St. Nedjelja and Cape Opatovo would facilitate traffic of the Adriatic Highway that currently utilizes a ferry system to cross the bay. When the site was inscribed in 1979, it was done so based on its cultural values; a 2008 UNESCO Mission Report suggests to also consider its outstanding value as a “cultural landscape” which may lead to a re-submission.

This series is principally remembered as an early target of the 'Clean Up TV' campaigner Mary Whitehouse who thought it unsuitable for an early evening audience. An episode in August 1964 featured Mrs Smallgood, a character parodying her, who was depicted launching a \\"Freedom from Sex\\" campaign. A scene with a prostitute was cut from another episode of the series, after a television studio worker leaked an advance copy of the script to her. She was told \\"It's too late to re-shoot.\\", and answered \\"I don't want re-shooting, I want _cuts_.\\" She delivered a letter of complaint in person to the Postmaster General of the United Kingdom, who appears to have passed the matter on to the BBC, and the scene Mrs Whitehouse found offensive was cut. Turner resigned from the series.The account of the whole incident is taken from Michael Tracey and David Morrison Whitehouse, London: Macmillan, 1979, p.70-71 A leader in The Times criticised the series for suggesting councillors were less than honest. With the exception of Peter Black in the Daily Mail, national critics dismissed the series. The reviewer in The Guardian faulted it for \\"amateurish performances\\" and described it as \\"a new low in tastelessness.\\" Television programmes from this era were often wiped, discarded or not recorded at all if they went out live.

The book documents a series of scientific observations and political processes, bringing attention to the causes and effects of global climate change. Kolbert travels around the world where climate change is affecting the environment in significant ways. These locations include Alaska, Greenland, the Netherlands, and Iceland. The environmental effects that are apparent consist of rising sea levels, thawing permafrost, diminishing ice shelves, changes in migratory patterns, and increasingly devastating forest fires due to loss of precipitation. She also speaks with many leading scientists about their individual research and findings. Kolbert brings to attention the attempts of large corporations such as Exxon Mobil and General Motors to influence politicians and discredit scientists. She also writes about America’s reluctance in the global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Leading this resistance, she explained, was the Bush administration, which was opposed to the Kyoto Protocol since it was ratified in 2005. Kolbert concludes the book by examining the events surrounding the events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and arguing that governments have the knowledge and technologies to prepare for such disasters but choose to ignore the signs until it is too late.

Corcoran played college football, mostly as a back-up, for the Maryland Terrapins. He gained notoriety for his flamboyant dress and playboy lifestyle, which earned him the reputation of being a \\"poor man's Joe Namath\\". Early life and college Corcoran was born on July 6, 1943 in Jersey City, New Jersey to an Irish Catholic family. His father, a truck driver, died in 1966, after which Corcoran never saw his mother, who died in 2008. At the age of 15, he was on his own; with his younger brother Raymond, they lived out their adolescence in a room at the YMCA. According to Corcoran, he gained the nickname \\"King\\" as a high school senior. A driving rainstorm hit during the first half of an important game, but when it let up at half time, Corcoran appeared wearing a clean uniform and sunglasses and the manager holding his helmet. Someone from the crowd yelled, \\"Hail to the King,\\" and a melee erupted. Corcoran said, \\"I was ink now, I was someone . . . I went from a nothing quarterback to second-string all-state in two weeks. It was the turning point in my life.\\" According to The Washington Times, Corcoran was recruited by Notre Dame, Miami, and Maryland. Corcoran claimed students at Notre Dame did not party and those at Miami did so too much. He chose to attend Maryland because he felt it offered a balance between a social life and the opportunity to play football.Thom Loverro, A journeyman on the field but always a 'King' off of it, The Washington Times, July 23, 2009, retrieved May 10, 2010. He attended the University of Maryland starting in 1961. He played as a back-up quarterback behind Dick Shiner and Alan Pastrana, but rarely started because of disagreements with the coaching staff. An injury benched Corcoran for the 1963 season. Corcoran's greatest college football accomplishment was leading Maryland's 1961 freshman team to an undefeated season, including a 29–27 victory over Navy, led by future Pro Football Hall of Famer Roger Staubach.Matt Schudel, Jim Corcoran Dies; 'Poor Man's Joe Namath' Reigned in Minor League Football, The Washington Post, August 1, 2009.

At Maryland, Corcoran first developed his reputation for brashness, and he referred to himself as \\"The King\\".WFL Philadelphia Bell, 1974–1975, Helmet Hut, retrieved February 11, 2009. The Washington Post described him as such: > \\"[H]e was flamboyant, brash and utterly unforgettable. He was a showman, an > unapologetic playboy, an egomaniacal self-promoter who traveled with his own > PR agent. And, not least of all, he was a lady-killer on an epic scale. Not > for nothing was he called the \\"poor man's Joe Namath,\\" after the Hall of > Fame New York Jets quarterback and notorious skirt chaser.\\" Professional career In 1966 and 1967, he spent some time in camp with the American Football League's Denver Broncos, but was ultimately cut from the team. According to The Washington Post, he was allegedly caught by the coach in bed with six women. Corcoran then signed with the Waterbury Orbits of the Atlantic Coast Football League. In 1967, Corcoran spent time on the AFL New York Jets taxi squad, where he was first described as a \\"poor man's Joe Namath\\". After being cut by the Jets, Corcoran signed with the Lowell Giants, a farm team of the Boston Patriots. In 1968, he got his first taste of big- time football when he spent two games with the parent club.http://www.newspaperarchive.com/LandingPage.aspx?type=glpnews&search;=jim%20king%20corcoran&img;=\\\\\\\\ a0002\\\\6804409\\\\57243572_clean.html (He appeared in one Patriots game, completing 3-of-7 passes for 33 yards, but was intercepted twice. Cocoran spent his next game in a Boston uniform on the bench, then was cut.) In 1969, Corcoran was back in the minors, signing a hefty three-year, $125,000 contract with the Pottstown Firebirds, a farm club of the Philadelphia Eagles. Corcoran would lead the Firebirds to back to back championships in 1969 and 1970, but the club folded after the 1970 season. Given another chance at the NFL, he moved up to the Eagles, but was released during the 1971 pre-season. Corcoran then signed with the Norfolk Neptunes, leading them to an ACFL title, his third straight minor-league championship. In 1972, Corcoran headed north to play with Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League, but quit the team after refusing to serve as its third-string quarterback; instead, he moved to the Chambersburg Cardinals of the Seaboard Football League.Simpson signs with Bills, Eugene Register-Guard, July 29, 1972. Corcran played two years in Chambersburg, leading them to a league title in 1973, his fourth in five years. In 1974, he signed with the Philadelphia Bell of the newly formed World Football League. He led the WFL in passing touchdowns in the league's only full season.World Football League , retrieved August 3, 2009. Corcoran completed 280 of 545 passes for 3,531 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also threw 24 interceptions and suffered 20 sacks. After the WFL folded, Corcoran retired from professional football in 1975 and became involved in real estate. In the 1980s, he took up polo, and despite having had no prior experience with horses, was an adequate amateur competitor. He married and had children, but they eventually moved to Florida without him. Corcoran later spent some time in Las Vegas as a singer and performed with Engelbert Humperdinck. Some of Corcoran's business dealings were of questionable legality, and he had been embroiled in legal troubles since the 1970s. He was convicted of fraud for selling property he did not own, and in 1997, Corcoran spent six months in a federal prison for tax evasion. He moved frequently and spent his last years in various locations in the Baltimore- Washington metropolitan area. At the time of his death, he was living at a friend's house in Takoma Park, Maryland. He died of cardiac arrest on June 19, 2009 at Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park.The King is Dead – Terrapin legend King Corcoran Dies of Cardiac Arrest, Terp Talk, June 27, 2009. King Corcoran was inducted into the American Football Association's Semi Pro Football Hall of Fame 1982. In popular culture An episode of The Rockford Files, \\"The No-Cut Contract\\", guest starring Rob Reiner as QB \\"King\\" Sturtevant, is a clear tongue-in-cheek reference to Corcoran. \\"King\\" is a quarterback playing in the lower leagues, unsuccessful womanizer, and unlikable character.

Its beginning is near a retention pond behind the old studios of WJXX. It outputs into the Arlington River (north of Atlantic Boulevard and west of Arlington Road) which in turn empties into the St. Johns River. The creek primarily flows through the heart of Jacksonville's Southside, and through southern parts of the Arlington neighborhood. Tour The Pottsburg Creek originates in the Southpoint section of Jacksonville's Southside. The origins of the pond are unknown, however, most ideas point to a retention pond near a television studio formerly used by ABC affiliate WJXX. Historical records of Spanish land grants filed with the Florida territorial government, such as for the plot owned by Peter Bagley, indicate a tributary of the Arlington River named Pottsburg Creek on maps of the area as early as 1824. The creek starts out as very narrow, and almost swamplike canal. The creek travels under busy J. Turner Butler Blvd., heading north. The creek here is very overgrown, and almost impossible to see while driving at the normal speed limit. The creek meanders north through suburban parts of Jacksonville, being fed directly or indirectly by heavy amounts of pollution and fertilizers. Many retention ponds and storm drains owned by JEA, the utility company, feed into this part of the creek. This creates a heavily fluctuating water level through this section. The creek continues north where it approaches U.S. 90/SR 212/Beach Blvd. Located along the creeks are several television transmitters, including ones for WFOX-TV, WJAX-TV, and WCWJ. The transmitters for WTLV, WJXT, and the digital transmitter for WJXX are also visible nearby, across busy Southside Blvd. This area is known as Killarney Shores. The creek begins to widen as it starts to head out of the southside area and into Arlington. The creek is also frequented by boat traffic due to the city boat ramp nearby. Soon the creek is joined by the spring run for Pottsburg Spring and the Little Pottsburg Creek. The creek widens even more as it passes under Atlantic Blvd. and out to the St. Johns River. Tributaries The Pottsburg Creek is mainly fed by rainwater, retention ponds, and storm drain runoff. Other named tributaries include the Little Pottsburg Creek, Strawberry Creek, Silversmith Creek, and discharge from the Pottsburg Spring.

Santiago.Anonymous (1989-02-08). \\"Film Reviews: The Expendables\\", Variety 334 (3): 20. It stars Anthony Finetti, Peter Nelson, Loren Haynes and Kevin Duffis. It was written by Philip Alderton. Its running time is 89 minutes. Since the movie is low budget, there is very little information about the movie and it is currently only available through VHS.  Plot  The movie is a Vietnam exploitation film where a commando makes an elite team out of rebels. The men are trouble makers and rebels, but are able to perform well. The men are sent out to blow up a bridge and manage to destroy the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) guards. However, another NVA force arrives and an all out battle commences. During the battle, two of the men are killed, but the team kills off all of the NVA reinforcements and captures their leader. The team is next sent on another mission to capture two village women, and then another to destroy an enemy base where another member is killed. They kill all of the NVA forces in the base, but their mission gets tougher when a prisoner escapes and captures American women and holds them hostage. The NVA splits up into two forces: one at an old fort and the other to ambush the team as it arrives. Despite the NVA plan of ambush, the NVA are wiped out, but they manage to kill two of the women and one of the special squad. Realizing that there is little time, the squad goes on with their mission and finds the fort. Their squad leader goes inside the fort to recon and is captured. The squad decides to go in and rescue him, the POW girls, and kill the NVA leader.

Known for his bold cinematic style, innovative use of realistic, on-location shooting and often gritty, controversial subject matter, Kuei found critical and commercial success working in a variety of genres, including the hard-boiled crime drama of The Teahouse (1974) and its sequel, Big Brother Cheng (1975), wuxia classic Killer Constable (1981), and the cult horror favorites The Killer Snakes (1975) and Hex (1980). Kuei often added subtle commentary to even his most mainstream projects, depicting the poverty of the public housing system, police corruption and colonial government rule with an unflinching honesty.  Early life  Kuei was born in Guangzhou (in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong) on 20 December 1937. Kuei's passion for cinema began as a high school student in Hong Kong, where he would cobble together makeshift shorts from a shoebox projector and discarded film stock. After graduating from high school, he studied stage production and filmmaking at Taiwan's National School of the Arts, experimenting on several 8 mm films. After writing a few film scripts for the Taiwan film industry, Kuei joined the famous Shaw Brothers Studio in the early 1960s. Initially hired as an assistant director on two Taiwan-shot Shaw films, Lovers' Rock (1964) and Song of Orchid Island (1965), his skill quickly led to projects in Hong Kong and an apprenticeship in Japan, where Kuei continued to hone his craft.  Shaw Brothers career  At the large Shaw Brothers Studio, Kuei gained a reputation as one of the most promising assistant film directors on numerous Hong Kong productions. In 1970, at the age of 34, he finally got the opportunity to direct a feature, Love Song Over the Sea. Shot in Singapore and Malaysia, the troubled production was initially suspended after the film's star Peter Chen Ho, fell ill. The original director, Shi Mashan, left due to contractual reasons, allowing Kuei to step in. Pleased with his work on this film, the studio quickly gave him a number of directorial projects, including the musical comedy, A Time for Love and The Lady Professional (1971), both starring Lily Ho. In 1973, he joined forces with the popular Shaw Brothers filmmaker, Chang Cheh, co-directing The Delinquent, an edgy action drama about a young dishwasher who falls into a life of crime. Though a collaboration between the two men, it is Kuei who is credited with the film's distinctive visual style, including the then pioneering use of on-location shoots in Hong Kong's gritty streets and public housing complexes. The film's success led to a string of early '70s hits with Kuei as the sole director, including the women-in prison exploitation flick, The Bamboo House of Dolls and the acclaimed vigilante drama, The Teahouse. He proved a versatile, imaginative filmmaker with a distinctive style that carried through to a number of diverse genres including comedy (The Bod Squad, Rat Catcher) and horror (Ghost Eyes). The Teahouse, about an immigrant restaurant owner trying to protect his family from juvenile gangs, takes a scathing look at the criminal justice system in Hong Kong and is considered one of Kuei's landmark works. The film is also a strong example of Kuei's penchant for eschewing studio sets for the realistic immediacy of urban locations, vividly depicting the harsh environment of lower-class immigrant life. It was followed by a hit sequel in 1975, Big Brother Cheng, with kung fu star Kuan Tai Chen reprising the eponymous role. Kuei transcended the tired revenge tropes of many action sequels, making Big Brother Cheng a compelling and uncompromising examination of crime, juvenile delinquency and social injustice. Though Kuei's contributions to Hong Kong cinema have often been neglected in recent decades, one film in particular ensured that he would enjoy a devoted cult audience for many years to come. Reaching new extremes in graphic sex and violence, the horror movie The Killer Snakes, is still considered one of Kuei's most notorious and controversial pictures. The plot centers on a young man's special powers with venomous snakes, which allow him to take revenge on those who have wronged him. Several over-the-top scenes of S&M; sex and of course lethal snake attacks earned The Killer Snakes its following as a midnight movie classic and to some degree, cemented Kuei's reputation as a maverick filmmaker. The movie is also noteworthy for actor Kam Kwok-Leung's crazily committed performance and the use of hundreds of live poisonous snakes. Kuei continued to challenge himself by directing segments for The Criminals film series, an acclaimed anthology based on actual Hong Kong cases. His episodes (across four films from 1975 to 1977) included \\"The Deaf Mute Killer,\\" \\"The Informer\\" and \\"Arson\\". During the late '70s, Kuei also expanded his filmography to include Cantonese-language comedies (Mr. Funnybone, Crazy Imposters, The Reckless Cricket) and kung fu (The Iron Dragon Strikes Back). The 1980s saw the versatile Kuei reinventing himself once again, this time with the popular supernatural fantasy, Hex and its two sequels, Hex vs. Witchcraft and Hex After Hex. The latter contained Kuei's signature social satire, taking on such hot-button topics as real estate development and Hong Kong's looming reunification with China. In fact, an early cut of the 1982 film featured a sequence where a character is branded on his behind with \\"1997\\" the year mainland China would resume control over Hong Kong. Deemed too politically sensitive, the scene was re-edited and the branded posterior featured \\"SB\\" (for Shaw Brothers) instead. Still, Kuei ingeniously found a way to insert a visual gag at the studio's expense. Kuei also delved into the wuxia genre for the first time with Killer Constable (1980). Though a box-office disappointment at the time of its release, today Killer Constable is considered one of Kuei's finest, most accomplished movies. Reuniting with his Teahouse/Big Brother Cheng star, Kuan Tai Chen, Kuei's kung fu drama is set in ancient Beijing (a rare period piece for the director). Kuan plays a loyal detective investigating a burglary at the royal palace, who slowly realizes that the corruption and betrayal he is assigned to vanquish lies at the highest levels of power. The film was praised for its dark, violent tone, vivid on-location cinematography and genuine pathos. Kuei's directorial credits during the 1980s also included Corpse Mania, Bewitched and The Boxer's Omen. With the rise of Hong Kong's New Wave filmmakers, a fresh cinematic style was emerging, though Kuei did not get to participate in this movement. He made one last film, the comedy Misfire, in 1984, before immigrating to the United States, where he opened a pizza restaurant. Kuei died of liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 61.  Legacy  Though often overlooked due to his penchant for exploitation genres and his early retirement from the film industry, Kuei Chih-Hung's films have received a renewed appreciation and attention in recent years. Today, he is often fondly referred to as the \\"Hong Kong Cult Meister.\\" In 2011, the Hong Kong Film Archive published a bilingual edition of Kuei Chih-Hung, the Rebel in the System, a look at his life and films. That same year, the 35th Hong Kong International Film Festival paid tribute to Kuei with a seven-film retrospective, including screenings of The Teahouse, Killer Constable and the Hex series. Kuei's son, Ming Beaver Kwei, a film producer whose credits include Sophie’s Revenge, My Lucky Star and The Meg was in attendance. The film retrospective allowed the son to view his father's notorious cult classic, The Killer Snakes for the first time, 37 years after its initial release. “This is a film that’s totally psychotic, perverse and grossed out. It’s beyond rated R,” was how he described it to The Hollywood Reporter in 2011. Kwei acknowledged that his dad would be pleased the films were still finding an audience, decades later. > “He’d bitch about his work every day, never quite satisfied how his work had > turned out, or how it was being distributed. He was only ever happy when he > knew for a day that a film had worked at the box office, then he’d start > worrying again. He’d be so happy to know that his films were getting a > second look today.” With more of his films now available on home video and streaming platforms, Kuei's bold, iconoclastic approach and distinctive auteur style continue to reach new film audiences. Kuei's maverick career was the subject of one of Film Comment writer Grady Hendrix's “Kaiju Shakedown” columns in 2015: > “But while he was regarded as minor league during his time at Shaw Brothers, > today he’s a giant, standing alongside Chang Cheh and Lau Kar-leung as one > of the best directors the studio produced. A pissed off perfectionist with > proletarian sensibilities, he directed groundbreaking, realistic crime > flicks and some of the filthiest horror movies ever to leave a slime trail > across the silver screen. Kuei applied the technical chops of Lau Kar-leung > to exploitation material. He had Chang Cheh’s obsession with violence, but > he was willing to offend his audience in a way that Cheh wasn’t.” Kuei's ‘80s-era horror films have gained a following in the United States in recent years. The Boxer’s Omen, in particular, has a strong American fanbase following a 2006 DVD release and a 2012 screening at the New York Asian Film Festival. Kuei’s horror films were the focus of an extensive article by Simon Abrams in Fangoria magazine. Abrams describes The Boxer’s Omen as “a spectacularly sensory-overloading gross-out, the kind of Stendhal syndrome- inducing gem that spoils you for any further exploration of its creators’ prior work.” “You will see things in The Boxer’s Omen that you’ve never seen before,” Abrams wrote. “And you’ll probably be left wondering ‘how the hell was this film made?’.” The New York Asian Film Festival has called Kuei “ one of the Shaw Brothers’ best and most underrated directors” and screened three of his films — Killer Constable, The Delinquent and Killers on Wheels — in 2014.

But I did not have the money so I made a projector out of a shoe box. I placed a light bulb in it and saved up for film. At the time, movie studios would throw away bits and pieces of used film that did not make the cut. I bought them for my shoe box projector. The film stock back then was nitrate and highly flammable. One time the bulb got overheated and the film started burning. It almost caused a fire and my father gave me a good scolding.\\" \\"I am not interested in making fanciful romantic movies at all. I have always wanted to take the realism approach. But in Hong Kong, that is so hard to do. If you make a movie about the mob, you may offend the real mob. If you object to the lenient sentences for juvenile delinquents, you may be condemned as 'agitator'. And if you include provocative dialogues, you may be mistaken as being political.\\" \\"A lot of people in Hong Kong tend to indulge themselves in mahjong playing and turn a blind eye to social problems. They think that as long as they do not get mugged themselves, everything is fine. I hope Big Brother Cheng can make them think again.\\" \\"In a time when movie-making is considered only an industry, I feel as if I were a factory worker. My job is the director, expected to produce whatever the market demands and I have no right to question that.\\" \\"The audience is hard to please. Their tastes tend to be low. The more vulgar the movie, the more likely you will make money. If you try to do something different or try to say something true to your beliefs, you might end up with a disastrous flop. To please the audience, you must resort to gimmicks. I make fantasy movies because audiences like them. But I'm not cavalier making them. I devoted a lot of thought on photography, lighting and so on.\\" \\"Compared to smaller studios, there are advantages and disadvantages to working for Shaw Brothers. Perhaps things have improved now, but in the past, independent productions were always running out of funds and that affected both the quality of the movie and your own livelihood. Shaw Brothers is at least well-equipped. If you need a set for a period movie, for example, just take a look in the sculpture room of the studio and you will find Shanghainese masters who specialize in making antique furniture. It is also true that New Wave directors have raised the standard. Now I can ask my crew, 'How do we compete with them when we are complacent?'\\"  Notes   External links  * *Kuei Chih-Hung at the Hong Kong Movie Database *http://www.celestialpictures.com/co-shaw-star.asp?id=23 Celestial Pictures Biography *http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/people.asp?id=1413 Hong Kong Cinemagic Biography *https://web.archive.org/web/20111006122337/http://www.shaw-brothers- reloaded.com/html/hkiff_celebrates_shaw_director.html \\"HKIFF Celebrates Shaw Director Kuei Chih-Hung\\" *http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kuei-chih- hungs-work-offered-169566 \\"Kuei Chih Hung's Work Offered Up to New Generation\\" Category:Film directors from Guangdong Category:Hong Kong film directors Category:1937 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Place of death missing Category:Artists from Guangzhou Category:Chinese film directors ","title":"Kuei Chih-Hung"},{"id":"20248511","text":"The Alan Dale Show is an early American television program which ran on the DuMont Television Network in 1948, and then on CBS Television from 1950-1951.

He is best known as the designer of the Dragon Age RPG, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (second edition), and Freeport: The City of Adventure. Career Early career Pramas began his career in the game industry as a freelancer in 1993, contributing to games such as Mayfair Games' Underground, Pariah Press' Dangerous Prey supplement (1995), and Hogshead Publishing's The Dying of the Light (1995) Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay campaign. He also contributed to the game Over the Edge. In early 1996, Pramas acquired The Whispering Vault rights from Mike Nystul and formed Ronin Publishing with his brother Jason Pramas and their mutual friend Neal Darcy; Jason Pramas left before long, and Ronin Publishing only successfully published The Book of Hunts (1997) before the rights to The Whispering Vault were transferred to another company. In August 1997, Pramas moved to Seattle, Washington, and made freelancing his full-time occupation. Pramas worked on Blood of the Valiant (1998), a Feng Shui sourcebook for Daedalus Games; when that company went out of business, Pramas instead got a license to publish the adventure, which became Ronin Publishing's second and final book. Wizards of the Coast Pramas accepted a job offer from Wizards of the Coast in March 1998. Working as an RPG designer for Wizards, he designed Dragon Fist, a wuxia-inspired version of AD&D;, which was released as one of the company's first PDF releases in 1999. Pramas also contributed to several AD&D; products and co-authored the Dark•Matter adventure The Final Church (2000), another PDF-only release. Pramas was then pulled into Wizards' new miniatures division as the creative designer for the Chainmail Miniatures Game (2001). Pramas designed the world for Chainmail, which he called the \\"Sundered Empire\\"; he originally intended this to be a standalone setting but management asked him to place the Sundered Empire in Greyhawk, so he made it into the subcontinent Western Oerik. Pramas' work for Dungeons & Dragons includes: Slavers (2000, with Sean K. Reynolds), Guide to Hell (1999), Apocalypse Stone (2000, with Jason Carl), Vortex of Madness (2000), as well as some work on the third edition Player's Handbook (2000) and Dungeon Master's Guide (2000). Green Ronin Pramas founded Green Ronin Publishing in 2000 with his wife Nicole Lindroos, and by 2001 they had brought on a third member of the team, Hal Mangold, to do freelance graphic layout for the company. In March 2002, Pramas was laid off from Wizards of the Coast. Toren Atkinson of the band The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets arranged with Pramas to have Green Ronin publish his RPG Spaceship Zero (2002) based on one of his band's albums. Pramas asked Steve Kenson to design a new d20-based superhero RPG for Green Ronin, which resulted in Mutants & Masterminds (2002). In 2004, Green Ronin was incorporated as an LLC, with Pramas, Lindroos, and Mangold coming on as the three partners. Pramas designed the second edition Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (2005) for Games Workshop. For Green Ronin, Pramas wrote The Pirate's Guide to Freeport (2007) with Patrick O'Duffy and Robert J. Schwalb. While continuing to lead Green Ronin Publishing, Pramas is a content designer for the Pirates of the Burning Sea massively multi-player online game at Flying Lab Software.

He is the younger brother of 2003 World Master Tony West and resides in Waltham Abbey, England BDO career West showed signs of a promising career quickly by reaching the final of the 2005 French Open, losing to local Dominique le Roy. He also reached the last 32 of the 2005 World Masters where he lost to Gary Anderson. In 2007, West reached another Open final in the 2007 Dutch Open, one of the BDO's biggest Open tournaments. Amongst his scalps were Dutchmen Co Stompé and Edwin Max before losing in the final to Scott Waites. Following this and three further quarter- finals, he qualified for the 2007 International Darts League, but was knocked out at the Preliminary Group Stage. West then won his first Open title, winning the 2007 Denmark Open, beating the Netherlands' Niels de Ruiter in the semi-finals and then beat fellow Englishman James Wilson in the final. His performances earned him qualification for the 2008 BDO World Championship. He faced former World Champion Ted Hankey in the first round and lost 3–2 despite leading 2–1. West bounced back from his Lakeside defeat to win the 2008 German Gold Cup beating Andree Welge in the final. He then won the Finnish Open, beating local favourite and former Masters finalist Jarkko Komula in the semi- finals and then beat Norway's Robert Wagner in the final. He also made two semi-final showings in the Belgium Open and the French Open and reached the quarter-finals of the Northern Ireland Open. These performances helped West qualify automatically for the 2009 BDO World Championship at the Lakeside, where he was the number 13 seed. However, he was outclassed by Alan Norris 3–0 in the first round. West could not better this in 2010 either, as once again he relinquished a 2–1 lead this time to Irish débutante Martin McCloskey. In 2011, West once more lost in the first round to 2010 finalist Dave Chisnall after missing three darts at double top to win before Chisnall came back to force a tiebreak in the final set and eventually win. In 2012, West lost in the first round of the BDO World Championship for the fifth year in a row against former runner-up and world #1 Tony O'Shea. This levelled him with Davy Richardson and Tony Payne for the record of most first-round losses at the World Championship before finally winning. It was announced at the end of the 2012 BDO World Championship that Steve would be one of many players to compete in the rival PDC's 'Q School' the following season, including his brother Tony. PDC career Stevie won a PDC tour card in the second day of 2012 qualifiers, defeating Gino Vos in the last round a day after Tony had earned his card. However, he did not play the full schedule of PDC ProTour events due to major hip surgery and could not advance beyond the last 64 in any of the ones he did play. He returned in 2013 to play in each of the eight UK Open Qualifiers where his best result came in event five, losing in the last 16 to Jelle Klaasen. West was placed 44th on the UK Open Order of Merit to enter the event in the second round, where he beat Jake Pennington 5–3. Further wins followed over Ian White and Richie Burnett to set up a fifth round meeting against Peter Wright, which he lost 9–4. The furthest he advanced during the rest of the season came in two Players Championships where he lost in the last 32 to Paul Nicholson and Wright both by 6–4 scorelines. West's two-year PDC tour card expired after the 2014 World Championship and he finished outside the top 64 on the Order of Merit so therefore entered Q School in January 2014 to retain his place. He was successful on the final day by defeating Mareno Michels 5–3 in his last match, revealing afterwards that he has changed his throwing action due to a hip replacement and bone graft he received in late 2012. He qualified for the UK Open where he lost 5–4 against Tony Randall in the second round. West played in two European Tour events during the campaign, the German Darts Masters and European Darts Trophy, and was defeated by Dave Chisnall and Simon Whitlock both in the second round. West began 2015 just outside the top 64 in the world rankings as he was number 66 and so once again entered Q School. On the third day he came through the event for the third time by beating Tim Martin 5–2 in the final round to earn a fresh two-year tour card. He was eliminated in the last 16 stage of four Players Championships during the year and lost 6–5 to Terry Jenkins in the second round of the European Darts Trophy after leading 4–1. West made his debut in the Grand Slam of Darts this year after overcoming Dean Winstanley, Wes Newton, Robert Owen and Eddie Dootson in the qualifying event. He finished third in his group after losing 5–2 and 5–3 to Kim Huybrechts and Michael van Gerwen and recording a 5–0 whitewash over Mark Oosterhuis. In 2016 West's best results came in the second half of the year. Wins over Mike Zuydwijk, William O'Connor, Jeffrey de Zwaan, Simon Whitlock, Cristo Reyes and Ricky Evans at the 16th Players Championship event saw him play in his first PDC final. West was 4–2 down to Michael van Gerwen, but took out a 116 finish to lead 5–4. He threw for the title in a deciding leg and was unable to take out 110 as Van Gerwen won it 6–5. A semi-final followed in the 18th event after beating Adrian Lewis 6–3 and he lost 6–1 to Whitlock. The result qualified him for the World Grand Prix and he pulled off what he called the biggest moment of his darting life by knocking out 11-time winner of the event Phil Taylor 2–1. He lost 3–0 to Daryl Gurney in the second round with each set going to a deciding leg. He met his brother Tony in the first round of the German Darts Championship and averaged 109.98 in a 6–0 whitewash. West went on to see off Stephen Bunting 6–2 and Kim Huybrechts 6–5, before being defeated 6–2 by Alan Norris in the quarter-finals. He qualified for his first European Championship and lost the first five legs against Jelle Klaasen in the opening round and went on to be eliminated 6–3. On his PDC World Championship debut, West won the opening two sets and was on 36 for the match in the third, when Mervyn King took out 136, went on to win the set and level at 2–2. In the decider, West missed two match darts and was knocked out 3–2. After a solid 2017 in which West reached a Pro Tour final (losing to Michael van Gerwen in a deciding leg) and won several matches in televised majors, West finally picked up his first ever victory at either version of the world championship at the seventh time of asking, by defeating Benito van de Pas 3-1 in the first round. He followed this with a win over another Dutchman, Jermaine Wattimena, 4-1 after surviving several darts to go 1-0 down. He was defeated by two-time champion Gary Anderson 4-2 in the last 16.

Biography  In 1780 he became an associate professor of theology and philosophy at the University of Wittenberg, where he served as rector in 1790–91. In 1792 he was appointed Oberhofprediger (first preacher) to the Saxon court in Dresden. Reinhard was one of the more influential Protestant ministers of his era, and was an important representative of \\"enlightened theological supernaturalism\\". He was not opposed to contemporary rationalist thought, yet at the same time stressed the importance of divine supremacy and Biblical authority. In his sermons and lectures he attempted to establish the \\"truth of Lutheranism\\" by rational means. Reinhard was a prominent figure in the Leben-Jesu-Forschung (Quest for the Historical Jesus) movement, a concept initiated by Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694-1768). He also exerted considerable influence upon the German educational system.  Published works  Among written works attributed to him was a 39-volume collection of his sermons that were published between 1793 and 1837. Other noted publications by Reinhard include: * Versuch über den Plan, welchen der Stifter der christlichen Religion.. (1781); translated into English in 1831 as \\"Plan of the Founder of Christianity\\". * System der christlichen Moral (System of Christian morals); (1792). * Vorlesungen über die Dogmatik (Lectures on dogmatics); (1801).

Life Elizabeth Pabodie was born Elizabeth Alden in 1623, the firstborn child of the Plymouth Colony settlers Priscilla Mullins and John Alden, who were both passengers on the Mayflower in 1620. She married William Pabodie (Peabody), a leader of Duxbury, Massachusetts, on December 26, 1644. All 13 of their children were born in that settlement before Elisabeth eventually moved to Little Compton, Rhode Island in the 1680s. She died on May 31, 1717 in Little Compton and was buried in the cemetery on Little Compton Common, officially called Old Commons Burial Ground. Her memorial is on Find A Grave as memorial #6868310. Descendants thumb Elizabeth Pabodie's first child was a daughter, Lydia; next came a son named William after his father. In 1683 Lydia married Daniel Grinnell Jr; they also had 13 children together. William the younger and his wife Judith had a daughter Rebecca Peabody, who married the Reverend Joseph Fish. Their daughter Mary Fish married Gold Selleck Silliman (1732–1790), and they were the parents of Benjamin Silliman, the first person to distill petroleum, and grandparents of Benjamin Silliman, Jr.. The Sillimans started the Chemistry Department at Yale, a forerunner of the Sheffield Scientific School. Benjamin Silliman, Jr. married Susan Huldah Forbes; their daughter Alice Trumbull Silliman married William Richardson Belknap (1849-1914). It is through this lineage that the Belknap and Humphrey families of Kentucky descended. Other descendants of Elizabeth Alden Pabodie and William Pabodie include Priscilla Pabodie, Rebecca Pabodie, Eleanor Belknap Humphrey (1876-1964), William Burke Belknap the younger, Alice Belknap Hawkes, Dr. Edward Cornelius Humphrey, Rev. Robert P. Shuler, Alice Humphrey Morgan, economist Thomas MacGillivray Humphrey, Barbara Morgan Meade, co-founder of the Washington, D.C. bookstore, Politics and Prose and whistleblower Edward Snowden. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was also a descendant of Elizabeth Pabodie. He made her parents John Alden and Priscilla Mullins famous through his poem The Courtship of Miles Standish.

Rousseau had meant to publish the essay in a short volume which was also to include essays On Theatrical Imitation and The Levite of Ephraim. In the preface to this would-be volume, Rousseau wrote that the Essay was originally meant to be included in the Discourse on Inequality, but was omitted because it \\"was too long and out of place\\".Victor Gourevitch, Rousseau: The Discourses and other early political writings, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp. 393–4. The essay was mentioned in Rousseau's 1762 book, Emile. In this text, Rousseau lays out a narrative of the beginnings of language, using a similar literary form as the Second Discourse. Rousseau writes that language (as well as the human race) developed in southern warm climates and then migrated northwards to colder climates. In its inception, language was musical and had emotional power as opposed to rational persuasion. The colder climates of the north, however, stripped language of its passionate characteristic, distorting it to the present rational form. In the later chapters, this relation is also discussed in terms of music, in ways that resonate with observations that Rousseau makes in his 1753 Letter on French Music. Chapter Nine of the Essay is an explication of the development of humankind, eventually inventing language. As this format closely adheres to that of the Second Discourse, some have discussed whether one account ought to be read as more authoritative than the other. As the text was initially written in 1754, and was sent to the publisher in 1763, it appears safe to argue that the tensions between the Essay and the Second Discourse were intentional. The third chapter of Jacques Derrida's Of Grammatology critiques and analyzes Rousseau's essay.

Bernard Weinstein (September 9, 1930 - November 3, 2008) was an American physician and researcher who studied the effect of pollutants and other environmental factors in causing cancer and headed the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University. He has been credited with helping create the field of molecular epidemiology, which studies how genetic and environmental risk factors are related to the spread of disease in populations. Weinstein was born in Madison, Wisconsin as the youngest of four sons of Russian immigrants. He earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He also earned his medical degree there and conducted research at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was hired by Columbia University as an assistant professor of medicine in 1961 and appointed as a professor in 1973. From 1978 to 1990, he was director of the division of environmental sciences at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. He held appointments on the Columbia faculty as professor of genetics and development and public health at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center of Columbia University and as the school's Frobe Jensen Professor of Medicine.I. Bernard Weinstein. M.D., National Foundation for Cancer Research. Accessed November 17, 2008. Irving Comprehensive Cancer Research Center Starting in the 1970s, Weinstein was among the first groups of researchers to make the connection between chemical compounds that are commonly found in the environment and their cancer-causing potential by identifying carcinogens that would be able to find molecular targets in the body.Perera, Frederica P.; and Weinstein, I. Bernard. \\"Molecular epidemiology: recent advances and future directions\\", Carcinogenesis (journal), March 2000. Accessed November 17, 2008. Weinstein investigated the cancer risks caused by benzo[a]pyrene, which is found in automobile exhaust, barbecued food and tobacco smoke. He also studied nitrosamines, a cancer-causing compound found in cured and smoked meats and in pickled foods, generated when nitrites in the food react with strong acids or high temperatures. Neuroscientist Richard Axel, a student of Weinstein's who shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, described how his mentor's \\"knowledge of emerging molecular genetics was combined with his research on the chemical causes of cancer to help in the creation of a new field, the field of molecular epidemiology\\". Studies performed by Weinstein in the 1990s of the human gene cyclin D1 showed that variations of the gene could foster the growth of cancer cells and tumor formation in the breast, esophagus, prostate and stomach, which led to theories that drugs targeted at cyclin D1 could help prevent the development of these cancers.I Bernard Weinstein, Columbia University Medical Center.

He served on many boards and advisory committees and as a consultant to water resources agencies worldwide, and received awards for his service. Caulfield was born in New York City, and died in Fort Collins, Colorado, where he retired in 1986. Early life Caulfield grew up with his parents, Henry P. Caulfield and Grace Nelson Caulfield, along with his brother Edward Nelson Caulfield, in Hollywood, California, graduating from Hollywood High School in 1931. He attended the California Institute of Technology, Lingnan University, Canton, China, and Oxford University, England, before earning his undergraduate degree at Harvard College in government and economics in 1940, an MPA degree from Harvard University's Littauer School of Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government) in 1949 and completing his comprehensive examination for the Ph.D. in political economy and government there in 1950. He began his public service career as an economist with the Works Projects Administration (1940–41) before serving in the U.S. Navy, where he was assigned to the Office of the Secretary (1942–45) and received a Commendation Award from the Secretary of the Navy, eventually retiring as lieutenant commander. He served briefly as executive assistant to the director, White House Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion in 1946, before being named assistant for international affairs to the assistant director for statistical standards of the U.S. Bureau of the Budget (1946–48), predecessor of the current Office of Management and Budget.\\"Henry P.

He was one of a few political appointees who, at the end of the Johnson Administration, declined to automatically submit his resignation, apparently feeling it was a mark of distinction to be fired by President Nixon. Caulfield was a member of the water board of the City of Fort Collins, Colorado (1974–88), and its vice president (1984–88). In this capacity he played a leading role in development of the city's policies with respect to water rights, treatment capacity, water meters and rates, wastewater treatment, environmental impacts and drought. Professor From 1969 to 1986 Caulfield was professor of political science at Colorado State University, where with Phillip O. Foss and Norman I. Wengert he helped establish its doctoral program in environmental politics and policy, and on his retirement, was emeritus professor. One of his principal graduate courses was the Politics of Water Resources Planning and Management. During his career, Caufield was invited to lecture during visiting academic appointments on the faculties of many universities, including: *University of Washington *University of Massachusetts *University of California, Davis *Duke University *Virginia Polytechnic and State University *University of North Carolina *University of Wisconsin *University of Georgia Caulfield also lectured during shorter appointments at some 30 institutions within the U.S. and overseas, including: *Institute of Water Resources, Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Belvoir, Virginia *University of Sarajevo, Yugoslavia *University of Alberta, Canada *Western Executive Training Center, U.S. Office of Personnel Management *Zhongshan University, People's Republic of China *East China Technical University of Water Resources *Yangtze River Planning Office, Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power *Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power Research Institute, Academy of Sciences *Japan Institute of Energy Law *Yamanashi University, Japan *Economic Research Institute, Kyoto University, Japan Advisory committees and consultancies Indicative of the extent of his national and international reputation, Caulfield served on many advisory committees, including those of the National Academy of Science and the National Science Foundation. For many years he was a delegate to the Universities Council on Water Resources; a member of its executive board (1978–81); and its president (1979–80).

The aircraft was carrying members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, a special force that is independent from the Iranian Army, on an unknown mission. Strong winds were reported in the region of the crash when the aircraft disappeared from the radar screens; approximately at the same time, villagers in the area described hearing a loud explosion. There were no survivors among the 275 occupants on board the aircraft. the crash remains the second deadliest on Iranian soil (behind Iran Air Flight 655) and the deadliest crash of an Il-76. Accident The IL-76 was flying a route from Zahedan Airport to Kerman Airport carrying members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on an unspecified mission. The four-engine Russian transport aircraft with a crew of 18, lost contact with air traffic control at 5:30 pm after flying into poor weather conditions. The aircraft crashed into the Sirch mountains, southeast of Kerman, about 500 miles southeast of Tehran, killing all aboard. Investigators believe it was a controlled flight into terrain, citing the deteriorating weather conditions and high winds. Recovery and aftermath Immediately after the crash, members of the Revolutionary Guards and Red Crescent were sent to the accident scene. Two helicopters attempting to reach the scene turned back due to bad weather. A cordon of the area was completed as well, limiting access to journalists and the public. President Mohammad Khatami's cabinet sent a message of condolence to families of the victims about the tragic event in which a group of IRGC brothers—Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps—were killed. The Iranian government also blamed U.S. sanctions against Iran for playing a part in the crash since the restrictions make it more difficult for Iran to maintain its aircraft. There was speculation that the accident was the result of a mid-air collision due to the high number of fatalities (the Il-76 normally carries fewer than 200 passengers). A terrorist organization called the Abu-Bakr Brigades also claimed responsibility for the crash.

The identity mapping of a graph onto itself is always an automorphism, and is called the trivial automorphism of the graph. An asymmetric graph is a graph for which there are no other automorphisms. Examples The smallest asymmetric non-trivial graphs have 6 vertices. The smallest asymmetric regular graphs have ten vertices; there exist ten-vertex asymmetric graphs that are 4-regular and 5-regular... One of the five smallest asymmetric cubic graphs is the twelve-vertex Frucht graph discovered in 1939.. According to a strengthened version of Frucht's theorem, there are infinitely many asymmetric cubic graphs. Properties The class of asymmetric graphs is closed under complements: a graph G is asymmetric if and only if its complement is. Any n-vertex asymmetric graph can be made symmetric by adding and removing a total of at most n/2 + o(n) edges. Random graphs The proportion of graphs on n vertices with nontrivial automorphism tends to zero as n grows, which is informally expressed as \\"almost all finite graphs are asymmetric\\". In contrast, again informally, \\"almost all infinite graphs are symmetric.\\" More specifically, countable infinite random graphs in the Erdős–Rényi model are, with probability 1, isomorphic to the highly symmetric Rado graph.. Trees The smallest asymmetric tree has seven vertices: it consists of three paths of lengths 1, 2, and 3, linked at a common endpoint.. In contrast to the situation for graphs, almost all trees are symmetric. In particular, if a tree is chosen uniformly at random among all trees on n labeled nodes, then with probability tending to 1 as n increases, the tree will contain some two leaves adjacent to the same node and will have symmetries exchanging these two leaves.

A few of the Milki were also founded in Karachi in Pakistan.Tribes and castes of Northwestern Provinces and Oudh by William Crooke They kept the same surnames used in the Hindu Jatt community. In Northern India, the community speaks Urdu and its dialects (Awadhi and Khari Boli). In Pakistan, the community speaks Punjabi.

The Jatt Muslims were once a community of substantial landowners in the Awadh region. People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan & J C Das pages 968 to 972 Manohar Publications  Origin  The Milki get their name from the fact that their ancestors received revenue-free grants (milk in Persian) of land during the Delhi Sultanate period. They were given land as an incentive to settle it. In Unnao District, they were substantial landowners and played an important role in the history of that district. The Milki were also appointed to the position of clerks and official record keepers by the state in the Awadh region. As part of their duties, they learned Turkish and Arabic, economics, administration, and taxation. They successfully adapted themselves as scribes and functionaries under the new colonial British rule. The Milki have many things in common with the neighbouring Muslim community, the Kayatha Muslims, and Manihar with whom they share many traditions and customs.Tribes and castes of Northwestern Provinces and Oudh by William Crooke  Present circumstances  The Milki of Unnao District claim to be Siddiqui Shaikhs, while those of Azamgarh and Ballia claim to be of Turkish origin. All groups of Milki practice intermarriage, and there are also instances of intermarriage within the Qidwai, Manihar, and Kayastha Muslim communities. The Milki are also found in the districts of Faizabad, Pratapgarh, Barabanki and Allahabad. Some Milki are Sunni, while others are Shia.

Early education and activism Howard (\\"Howie\\") Machtinger was born in the Bronx, New York, on April 23, 1946.(FBI, 155) Machtinger earned his baccalaureate degree cum laude in Sociology and English from Columbia University, in 1966.(Slate 3) He was born to \\"Harry\\" Herszla Machtinger and Yetta Migden, who were Polish-Jewish immigrants.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/heraldsun/obituary.aspx?n=barbara- machtinger&pid;=185952611&fhid;=21520 His siblings included Barbara, Evelyn and Leonard. Ted Gold was a cousin; his mother Ruth Migden was the sister of Yetta Migden. He became an active SDS member while he was a graduate student in Sociology at the University of Chicago in 1968.(FBI, 7) Machtinger was a regional director of SDS from autumn of 1968 until the SDS Split and made contributions to New Left Notes, an SDS publication.(Judiciary Committee, 85) He was part of a steering committee which took over the administration building at University of Chicago on January 30, 1969.(Judiciary Committee, 86) During the takeover, 300 students occupied the university's administration building, protesting the non-renewal of Marlene Dixon's contract with the Sociology department. Students believed the department voted her out because she was a woman with politically radical views.Janson, 18 Weatherman Machtinger was one of the founding members of Weatherman (later known as the Weather Underground), an organization that formed as a result of the SDS split in June 1969.(Jacobs, 147) He was a part of the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM), a faction of SDS who believed revolution was imperative. Machtinger, like other members of RYM, criticized members of the Progressive Labor (PL) faction of SDS for placing emphasis on the class struggle rather than focusing on the issue of racism, which he viewed as a dire problem plaguing America.(Jacobs, H. 344) Machtinger was one of the eleven co-authors of the Weatherman statement, which appeared in the issue of New Left Notes presented at the 1969 SDS National Convention in Chicago.(Jacobs, 25) Machtinger co- wrote \\"You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows\\" with Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Jeff Jones, Mark Rudd, John Jacobs, Terry Robbins, Jim Mellen, Karin Ashley, Gerry Long, and Steve Tappis.Ayers et al., 1.

He was among the Weathermen who eventually went underground.(FBI, 155) Indictment and life underground On April 2, 1970, Machtinger was indicted with twelve other Weatherman members on charges of conspiracy and violation of the Federal Antiriot Act during the Days of Rage. He was accused of leading Days of Rage but the charges were dismissed as electronic surveillance had not been court-ordered.(Judiciary Committee, 86) Machtinger was indicted again on July 24, 1970. Along with ten other members of Weather, Machtinger was charged with conspiring to bomb the Detroit Police Officers Association Building.(Judiciary Committee, 86) He went underground in the early 1970s and was arrested on East 86th Street in New York in April 1973. Machtinger was released on bail, and subsequently went back underground.(FBI, 155) Upon averting jail time, Machtinger released a statement to the press explaining his desire to remain underground and to continue working for Weather's Cause.(Berger, 147) In his letter, written October 16, 1973, Machtinger explores the dilemma of being a revolutionary fugitive in the following excerpt: What should I do? Go to jail and do time-- for how long?...Do my political work behind steel bars, get out and figure a new way to integrate myself in the revolution? Or, if I had the opportunity, return to what I had been doing: trying to build secret--from the state power --bases of strength as one means of aiding in the overthrow of the imperialist, sexist, racist state.Raskin, 88 '' Resurfacing and recent history Machtinger surrendered in Criminal Court on May 11, 1978.Branegan, D5 Upon resurfacing, he continued to pursue education, earning an A.A.S degree in computer science and business technology from Seattle Central Community College in 1981.(Slate, 2)UNC Institute of African American Research He taught high school history from 1993 until he received his master's degree in history from San Francisco State University in 1996.(Slate,2) Machtinger's 1995 dissertation, titled Clearing Away the Debris : New Left Radicalism in 1960s America, further explores the New Left movement of the 1960s.

Adrenal disorders may cause hyperfunction or hypofunction, and may be congenital or acquired. The adrenal gland produces hormones that affects growth, development and stress, and also helps to regulate kidney function. There are two parts of the adrenal glands, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex produces mineralocorticoids, which regulate salt and water balance within the body, glucocorticoids (including cortisol) which have a wide number of roles within the body, and androgens, hormones with testosterone-like function.Adrenal Glands, Johns Hopkins Medicine Health Library. The adrenal medulla produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Disorders of the adrenal gland may affect the production of one or more of these hormones.  Tumors of the adrenal gland  * Adrenal adenoma, a benign tumor of the adrenal gland which may result in overproduction of one or more adrenal hormones, or may be inactive. * Adrenocortical carcinoma, cancer of the adrenal cortex * Adrenal incidentaloma, an adrenal tumor (of any type) discovered accidentally during a scan which performed for an unrelated reason * Pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-producing tumor of the adrenal medulla, which may or may not be cancerous  Hereditary disorders associated with adrenal tumors  * Von Hippel–Lindau disease, a mutation of the VHL1 tumor- suppression gene associated with many types of tumor, including pheochromocytoma * Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, a family of syndromes in which genetic abnormalities contribute to the development of endocrine tumors  Notable people with adrenal gland disorders  * John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States was diagnosed with Addison’s disease. * Some have suggested Jane Austen was an avant la lettre case of Addison's Disease, but others have disputed this. * Scientist Eugene Merle Shoemaker, co- discoverer of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 had Addison's Disease.  Disorders of hormone over/under-production  * Addison's disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, a disease in which the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient glucocorticoids (sometimes also mineralocorticoids) for a reason directly related to the adrenal gland itself, such as auto-immune damage to the adrenal gland or adrenal gland atrophy due to medication use * Adrenal crisis, a life-threatening medical emergency resulting from insufficient levels of cortisol * Adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient glucocorticoids (or sometimes mineralocorticoids. This is often due to another adrenal disorder, such as Addison's Disease or Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, however it may also result from a problem elsewhere in the body (such as the hypothalamus or pituitary gland) that leads to abnormalities in the production of hormones regulating adrenal function * Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, a hereditary disorder in which one of the enzymes involved in cortisol synthesis does not function properly. This disorder is also often associated with an over- production of androgen hormones. * Cushing's disease, a disorder in which cortisol levels are abnormally high * Hyperaldosteronism (including Conn's syndrome), a condition in which aldosterone is over-produced * Hypoaldosteronism, a condition in which aldosterone is under-produced References ","title":"Adrenal gland disorder"},{"id":"20249874","text":"This is a list of football games played by the South Korea national football team between 2000 and 2009. 2000 {  style=\\"font- size:95%\\" -

He had to wait almost two years for his next cap, which came to him in the 2006 Trophy,https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/5/Asian_Cricket_Council_Trophy_2006.html where he played in all of Hong Kong's matches in their run to the final, earning Hong Kong their second Asia Cup appearance. Kruger himself had little impact with the team but he was being talked about as a leadership prospect already. His World Cricket League debut came in the 2007 Division Three tournamenthttps://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/6/ICC_World_Cricket_League_Division_Three_2007.html in the north of Australia. He scored his first, and so far only, international half-century against Italy in Darwin,https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/122/122314.html anchoring his team's winning total of 195. In the next edition of Division Three, 2011, Kruger began to realise his potential with a brace of 40s against Oman and Denmarkhttps://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/14/ICC_World_Cricket_League_Division_Three_2010-11.html in victories that contributed to their promotion to Division Two, which carried List A status.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/14/ICC_World_Cricket_League_Division_Two_2011.html In his Hong Kong career, Kruger has represented his country in 54 internationals, as well as seven non-internationals against historic English club sides, and the Sri Lanka colts.

He was a part of the same group of players that contained Hong Kong mainstays Irfan Ahmed, Nadeem Ahmed and Jamie Atkinson, a golden generation of Hong Kong home-grown talent. Also in 2020, he was rightly given out by Lewis Skinner at the mayflower in a win for Boston and surely the greatest ever debut from a BCC player. 2 wickets a catch and a run out from Lewis. Electrifying action. Illness In November 2007, Kruger was travelling home from representing Hong Kong at the ACC Twenty20 when he complained of debilitating headaches.http://www.scmp.com/article/735133/alvin-sallay When he returned to Hong Kong, doctors discovered an abscess in his brain.http://www.scmp.com/article/735133/alvin-sallay To relieve the pressure, half of Kruger's skull had to be removed for three months; he was bedridden for six.

Ayalon Mall is also notable for its owner, David Azrieli, inventing the word for \\"mall\\" in Hebrew for this mall, \\"kanyon\\". In addition, Ayalon Mall is the place of the first McDonald's location in Israel, which opened there in 1993.Israel Business Today, October 1993 The mall was originally one story tall, but in 2006 an extension which contains a second floor with cinemas above some of the mall was built. A second extension in 2015 added many shops and restaurants. Since the mall is close to Tel Aviv and Bnei Brak, many visitors come from these areas. The mall is built near the Ramat Gan Stadium and Bnei Brak Railway Station. The mall contains international stores such as Zara, and Aldo, in addition to Israeli chains such as Castro, Fox, and Honigman. New additions Inside view of the mall's second floor In July 2006, a partial new two-story wing was added, which included a new 15 screen movie theatre, \\"Yes Planet\\" (sponsored by the Israeli satellite company Yes), and some fast food restaurants. The new theatre replaced the old approximately 10-year-old one which had only 4 screens. The old cinema was replaced with about 10 new stores. In mid 2014, the construction of the second floor extension had begun, and in April 2015 the construction was completed.

Bondkomik (rustic humor) was a popular form of entertainment in turn-of-the-century Sweden. It also had a large following among Swedish Americans. The rustic comic, often clad as a country bumpkin, assumed an alias to go along with his outlandish appearance. Widdén, for instance, sometimes went by the name of Olle ve Kvarna (Olle at the Mill). Hjalmar Peterson was another bondkomiker from Sweden, who was active at the same time and had a similar repertoire. Peterson was better known by his stage name of Olle i Skratthult (Olle from Laughtersville).Svensk-amerikanska bondkomiker Olle i Skratthult och Charlie \\"fun\\" Widdén by Ulf Beijbom, (The Swedish Emigrant Institute of Växjö, Sweden, 1973).

Newspapers proclaimed Widdén the foremost Swedish humorist in America and a noted provider of laughter throughout the land. In 1921 Charles G. Widdén returned to his hometown of Worcester for a concert at Horticultural Hall. Demand for tickets to his Thursday February 3rd program was so great that a second show was added for Saturday February 5th.Svea February 02, 1921.

Popular recording artist Between 1913 and 1924 Charles G. Widdén recorded over 100 sides for the Columbia, Edison and Victor labels. His output was steady. His new releases came out every single year in this period. Widdén's repertoire consisted of songs, poems, stories and monologues.Songs, poems and stories archive.org. Retrieved: July 22, 2018.

Retrieved: July 5, 2015. whose lyrics and stories — popular on both sides of the Atlantic — were a staple of rustic humor. Widdén recorded Fröding's poems concerning the supernatural: Bergslagstroll (Mountain trolls) and Skögsrån (The wood sprite) Gustaf Fröding: selected poems by Charles Wharton Stork, (New York:The Macmillan Company, 1916). as well as those dealing with immigration to America: Farväll (Farewell) and I bönhuset (At the prayer meeting). Värmland poet Oscar Stjerne likewise contributed to Widdén's repertoire with two poems: Dektarelott (A poet's lot) and (A strange people). J. L. Runeberg's poems of patriotic Finns were also represented: Soldatgossen (The soldier boy) and Sven Duva (a hero of the 1808-1809 war against Russia).Anthology of Swedish lyrics from 1750 to 1915 by Charles Wharton Stork, (New York: The American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1917). These verses were part of Runeberg's epic work Fänrik Ståls Sägner (The Tales of Ensign Stål). About one third of Widdén's output was spoken word material, and much of his popularity rested on his original comic monologues. Today he is mainly remembered for the yodel-like laugh with which he punctuated these homespun tales. When speaking Swedish he sometimes assumed the comic persona of Olle ve Kvarna (Olle at the Mill). In English he became \\"Peterson\\". His 1917 story \\"Peterson at the Turkish bath\\" was one of the first Scandinavian dialect recordings.Chicago record stores archive.org. Retrieved: November 7, 2016. Charles G. Widdén had a wide-ranging musical repertoire. He recorded over sixty songs — drawing on everything from folk music and vaudeville to musical revues and dance tunes. Most notably Widdén recorded Kostervalsen (The waltz on Koster isle) and seventeen other numbers by Göran Svenning and David Hellström. He also covered songs by Lars Bondeson, Axel Engdahl, Adolf Englund, Gustaf Fröding, Skånska Lasse, Emil Norlander, Theodor Pinet and Ernst Rolf. Widdén's comic songs often dealt with marital problems. Swedish songs such as Jäntblig (Maidens' glances) and Stackars Olson (Poor old Olson) were joined by American songs in translation: \\"Lucky Jim\\" as Lycklige Jim and \\"Don't take me home\\" as Mister Johnsons klagan (Mister Johnson's lament). The poem Herre i sitt hus (Master of his house) by Gösta Schönberg was in a similar vein.Gösta poem archive.org. Retrieved: May 27, 2019. Regardless of the source, they were cautionary tales of henpecked husbands. Våran bal (Our ball) was a Swedish version of the Irving Berlin hit \\"Everybody's doin' it now\\". Although not inherently racist, the Berlin composition was considered a Coon song because of the affected manner in which it was sung by White artists. Charles G. Widdén made his final recording in 1924, leaving behind an enormous catalog of music and humor. More than ninety years later his records are still sold by vintage music stores and online retailers. In 2011 the Library of Congress opened its National Jukebox web site with streaming audio for eighteen of Widdén's songs and stories. Renewed interest in Charles G. Widdén Samuelson's Confectionery 1890 In the 1970s Charles G. Widdén was rediscovered in his native country and in the United States. The Swedish Emigrant Institute of Växjö gave prominent mention to Olle i Skratthult (Hjalmar Peterson) and Charles G. Widdén in a 1973 exhibit on entertainment in Swedish America. A small disc was produced for the occasion with excerpts from their songs and stories. The Snoose Boulevard Festival was held in the Cedar- Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis from 1972 through 1977. In the late 19th century Cedar Avenue became known as \\"Snoose Boulevard\\", a nickname often given to the main street in Scandinavian communities. The term derived from the residents' fondness for snus (snuff), an inexpensive form of tobacco. The event, which celebrated the area's Scandinavian past, featured the music, food, and arts of the immigrants who had once lived there. The headline performer was Anne-Charlotte Harvey, a singer originally from Stockholm, Sweden. In conjunction with the festival she recorded three albums of folk tunes, emigrant ballads, hymns, waltzes and comic songs. The non-profit Olle i Skratthult Project sponsored the annual celebration and the recordings.Seward Profile April 2005. Harvey's albums, produced by the renowned ethnomusicologist Maury Bernstein, included six songs from Widdén's discography. The Swedish singers Gustav Fonandern and Lydia Hedberg toured the United States and made recordings for Columbia and Victor Records during the 1920s. Three of their songs — ones that Widdén had also recorded — were released by the Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research on the 1981 LP \\"From Sweden to America\\".From Sweden To America (Stockholm: Caprice Records, 1981). The album was issued as a CD in 1996 and in 2011 became available at iTunes and Amazon mp3.

Because he made a grab for one of the pieces of steak, and it happened to be the biggest steak that he got a hold of. So Carlson he didn't like that very much, so he said to Peterson, \\"Say, Peterson, you is not very polite in your table manners. Now if I had taken one of those pieces of steak first I would have taken one of the smaller pieces instead of the bigger.\\" \\"Well\\", said Peterson, \\"you got the small piece of steak.

Braley was one of the original members of the Revolutionary Youth Movement, a group devoted to anti-racism and Third World struggles which later evolved into Weatherman. Revolutionary beginnings Martin Luther King Jr. was an inspiration for Scott Braley, and the reason for Braley's desire to see an escalation in the struggle for equal rights.Berger 56 \\"It seemed like a pretty clear choice,\\" Braley was quoted as saying, \\"To be on the immoral and historically losing side of white supremacy, or to join a vibrant struggle for liberation around the world.\\"Berger 57 It was because of MLK that Braley dropped out of school in 1967 and started organizing SDS chapters in his area full-time. Flint War Council Braley attended the December 1969 SDS National Meeting, held in Flint, Michigan and later called the Flint War Council.Berger 122 It was during this meeting that members of Weatherman officially decided to move underground. Attendees at the War Council discussed issues such as women's liberation, youth culture, and the imperialism that existed in the events of the Vietnam War.Berger 123 SDS demonstrated these issues and opinions through satirical Christmas carols and spinoffs of popular songs, such as changing the lyrics to the Supremes' \\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\" to \\"Stop This Imperialist Plunder.\\" Government documents note that the room in which the SDS National War Council was held was rented under Braley's name.Judiciary Committee (85-86) Hampton-Clark murders Government surveillance and violence against civil rights leaders served to strengthen Scott Braley's political resolve. Fred Hampton was an activist and the leader of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panthers. Considered by Weather members to be a comrade in the struggle for black rights, Hampton criticized Weatherman actions, especially those used in the Days of Rage, calling the group opportunistic and chauvinistic.\\"Weather Underground\\" documentary Two months after the Days of Rage in 1969, Hampton was found murdered in his apartment, along with fellow Black Panther Mark Clark.Berger 119 When the murder was linked to the FBI, Braley was quoted as saying that the murders proved that \\"the stakes really were what we thought they were.\\"Berger 121 Underground Braley remained underground with the group until the dissolution of WUO in 1977. Originally opposed to the suggestion of surfacing, Braley stated in an interview excerpted in Dan Berger's book Outlaws of America that the decision was tormenting.Berger 241 Red Dragon Print Collective In 1973, the Weather Underground Organization established a printing operation called the Red Dragon Print Collective, a venture which Braley helped run.Berger 185 Operating out of a soundproof apartment, the print collective was a formative part of the Weather Underground Organization for its final three years. The Red Dragon Print Collective was responsible for producing the Weather Underground Organization's book Prairie Fire. All printing, binding, and collating of materials was done by the members themselves. As a precaution, work was done wearing gloves to ensure that no fingerprints would be left. Later life Scott Braley lives in Oakland, California where he works as a photographer for social justice and non-profit organizations.Berger 311 Notes :See References below for publications cited References * *FBI Files: Weather Underground Organization (Weathermen) Retrieved from http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/weather.htm * *The Weather Underground.

Definitions and examples An ontology is a kind of dictionary that describes information in a certain domain using concepts and relationships. It is often implemented using OWL (Web Ontology Language), an XML-based standard language that can be interpreted by computers. * A Concept is defined as abstract knowledge. For example, in the geopolitical ontology a non-self-governing territory and a geographical group are concepts. Concepts are explicitly implemented in the ontology with individuals and classes: ** An individual is defined as an object perceived from the real world. In the geopolitical domain Ethiopia and the least developed countries group are individuals. ** A class is defined as a set of individuals sharing common properties. In the geopolitical domain, Ethiopia, Republic of Korea and Italy are individuals of the class self-governing territory; and least developed countries is an individual of the class special group. * Relationships between concepts are explicitly implemented by: ** Object properties between individuals of two classes. For example, has member and is in group properties, as shown in Figure 1. ** Datatype properties between individuals and literals or XML datatypes. For example, the individual Afghanistan has the datatype property CodeISO3 with the value \\"AFG\\". ** Restrictions in classes and/or properties. For example, the property official English name of the class self-governing territory has been restricted to have only one value, this means that a self-governing territory (or country) can only have one internationally recognized official English name.Official names of countries from FAO terminology database Figure 1. An example of concepts and relationship in the geopolitical ontology. The advantage of describing information in an ontology is that it enables to acquire domain knowledge by defining hierarchical structures of classes, adding individuals, setting object properties and datatype properties, and assigning restrictions. FAO ontology The geopolitical ontology provides names in seven languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, English, Spanish, Russian and Italian) and identifiers in various international coding systems (ISO2, ISO3, AGROVOC, FAOSTAT, FAOTERM, GAUL, UN, UNDP and DBPediaID codes) for territories and groups. Moreover, the FAO geopolitical ontology tracks historical changes from 1985 up until today;Country or area code changes since 1982: United Nations Statistics Division - country or area codes added or changed provides geolocation (geographical coordinates); implements relationships among countries and countries, or countries and groups, including properties such as has border with, is predecessor of, is successor of, is administered by, has members, and is in group; and disseminates country statistics including country area, land area, agricultural area, GDP or population. The FAO geopolitical ontology provides a structured description of data sources. This includes: source name, source identifier, source creator and source's update date. Concepts are described using the Dublin Core vocabulary (http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description). In summary, the main objectives of the FAO geopolitical ontology are: * To provide the most updated geopolitical information (names, codes, relationships, statistics) * To track historical changes in geopolitical information * To improve information management and facilitate standardized data sharing of geopolitical information * To demonstrate the benefits of the geopolitical ontology to improve interoperability of corporate information systems It is possible to download the FAO geopolitical ontology in OWL and RDF formats. Documentation is available in the FAO Country Profiles Geopolitical information web page. Features of the FAO ontology The geopolitical ontology contains : *Area types:When an area (territory or group) changed but kept the same name, the ontology differentiates the two areas by sub-fixing the name of the obsolete one with the year (e.g. “FAO 2006”). The year indicates the beginning of validity of that particular area. **Territories: self-governing, non-self- governing, disputed, other.The area type Other is used for Antarctica which has no government and belongs to no country. See also Politics in Antarctica. **Groups: organizations, geographic, economic and special groups.Special groups term is used for non-economical or greographical territory groups like the Small Island Developing States, Land Locked Countries, Low Income Food Deficit Countries, Least Developed Countries, etc. *Names UN official names: Reports of the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (official, short and names for lists) in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Russian and Italian. *International codes: UN code – M49, ISO 3166 Alpha-2 and Alpha-3, UNDP code, GAUL code, FAOSTAT, AGROVOC FAOTERM and DBPediaID. *Coordinates: maximum latitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, minimum longitude. *Basic country statistics: country area, land area, agricultural area, GDP, population. *Currency names and codes. *Adjectives of nationality. *Relations: **Groups membership. **Neighbours (land border), administration of non-self-governing. **Historic changes: predecessor, successor, valid since,The value of the datatype property \\"validSince\\" is the first year of validity of a territory or group. The geopolitical ontology traces back historic changes only until 1985. Therefore if an area has a validSince = 1985, this indicates that the area is valid at least since 1985. valid until.The value of the datatype property \\"validUntil\\" is the last year of validity of the territory or group. In case the area is currently valid, this value is set by default to 9999. Implementation into OWL The FAO geopolitical ontology is implemented in OWL. It consists of classes, properties, individuals and restrictions. Table 1 shows all classes, gives a brief description and lists some individuals that belong to each class. Note that the current version of the geopolitical ontology does not provide individuals of the class \\"disputed\\" territories. Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate datatype properties and object properties.  Geopolitical ontology in Linked Open Data  The FAO Geopolitical ontology is embracing the W3C Linked Open Data (LOD) initiativehttp://linkeddata.org and released its RDF version of the geopolitical ontology in March 2011. The term 'Linked Open Data' refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web. The key technologies that support Linked Data are URIs, HTTP and RDF. The RDF version of the geopolitical ontology is compliant with all Linked data principles to be included in the Linked Open Data cloud, as explained in the following. Resolvable http:// URIs  Every resource in the OWL format of the FAO Geopolitical Ontology has a unique URI. Dereferenciation was implemented to allow for three different URIs to be assigned to each resource as follows: * URI identifying the non-information resource * Information resource with an RDF/XML representation * Information resource with an HTML representation In addition the current URIs used for OWL format needed to be kept to allow for backwards compatibility for other systems that are using them. Therefore, the new URIs for the FAO Geopolitical Ontology in LOD were carefully created, using “Cool URIs for Semantic Web” and considering other good practices for URIs, such as DBpedia URIs. New URIs The URIs of the geopolitical ontology need to be permanent, consequently all transient information, such as year, version, or format was avoided in the definition of the URIs. The new URIs can be accessed at http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/ For example, for the resource “Italy” the URIs are the following: ;http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/Italy : identifies the non-information resource. ;http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/data/Italy : identifies the resource with an RDF/XML representation. ;http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/page/Italy :identifies the information resource with an HTML representation. In addition, “owl:sameAs” is used to map the new URIs to the OWL representation. Dereferencing URIs When a non-information resource is looked up without any specific representation format, then the server needs to redirect the request to information resource with an HTML representation. For example, to retrieve the resource “Italy” (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/Italy), which is a non-information resource, the server redirects to the HTML page of “Italy” (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/page/Italy). At least 1000 triples in the datasets The total number of triple statements in FAO Geopolitical Ontology is 22,495. At least 50 links to a dataset already in the current LOD Cloud: FAO Geopolitical Ontology has 195 links to DBpedia, which is already part of the LOD Cloud. Access to the entire dataset FAO Geopolitical Ontology provides the entire dataset as a RDF dump. It is available at http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/data The RDF version of the FAO Geopolitical Ontology has been already registered in CKAN (http://ckan.net/package/fao-geopolitical-ontology) and it was requested to add it into the LOD Cloud. Example of use Figure 3. a website of introducing the geopolitical ontology in FAO Country Profiles. The FAO Country Profiles is an information retrieval tool which groups the FAO's vast archive of information on its global activities in agriculture and rural development in one single area and catalogues it exclusively by country. The FAO Country Profiles system provides access to country-based heterogeneous data sources.Inventory of data sources used in the FAO country profiles By using the geopolitical ontology in the system, the following benefits are expected:Integrating country-based heterogeneous data at the United Nations: FAO's geopolitical ontology and services. * Enhanced system functionality for content aggregation and synchronization from the multiple source repositories. * Improved information access and browsing through comparison of data in neighbor countries and groups.

Established in 1918, the utility is a public agency funded by water rates and new tap fees, not taxes. It is Colorado's oldest and largest water utility. Overview Denver Water's primary water sources are the South Platte River, Blue River, Williams Fork and Fraser River watersheds, but it also uses water from the South Boulder Creek, Ralston Creek and Bear Creek watersheds. History The first residents of the Denver area drank water directly from the creek and river. Surface wells and buckets of water sufficed for a while as a delivery system, but they soon proved inadequate. Irrigation ditches were the next step forward. In 1870, when the rapidly growing community had a population of almost 5,000, the Denver City Water Company was formed. In 1872, with a large well, a steam pump and four miles (6 km) of mains, Denver City Water Company began to provide water to homes. Over the next two decades, 10 water companies fought, collapsed or merged. Several companies merged, and in 1894, the Denver Union Water Company—predecessor of Denver Water—emerged to establish a stable system. In 1918, Denver residents voted to form a five-member Board of Water Commissioners and buy the Denver Union Water Company's water system for $14 million, creating Denver Water. From that time on, Denver Water planned and developed a system to meet the needs of the people of Denver and the surrounding areas. Flash floods between 1996 and 2002 led to erosion and damage to Denver's reservoirs. This erosion were exacerbated by the insects and disease in the 1990s that had weakened forests. To address this, Denver Water began replanting mountainsides with drought-resistant trees in order to better maintain its waterways.

A global recession is recession that affects many countries around the world—that is, a period of global economic slowdown or declining economic output.  Definitions  The International Monetary Fund defines a global recession as \\"a decline in annual percapita real World GDP (purchasing power parity weighted), backed up by a decline or worsening for one or more of the seven other global macroeconomic indicators: Industrial production, trade, capital flows, oil consumption, unemployment rate, percapita investment, and percapita consumption\\". According to this definition, since World War II there were only four global recessions (in 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009), all of them only lasting a year (although the 1991 recession would have lasted until 1993 if the IMF had used normal exchange rate weighted percapita real World GDP rather than the purchasing power parity weighted percapita real World GDP). The 2009 global recession, also known as the Great Recession, was by far the worst of the four postwar recessions, both in terms of the number of countries affected and the decline in real World GDP per capita. Before April 2009, the IMF argued that a global annual real GDP growth rate of 3.0 percent or less was \\"equivalent to a global recession\\".Lall, Subir. \\"IMF Predicts Slower World Growth Amid Serious Market Crisis,\\" International Monetary Fund, April 9, 2008. By this measure, there were six global recessions since 1970: 1974–75,http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/update/01/index.htm IMF Jan 2009 update 1984-85, 1990–93, 1996, 2008–09, and 2018–19.  Overview  Informally, a national recession is a period of declining economic output. In a 1974 New York Times article, Julius Shiskin suggested several rules of thumb to identify a recession, which included two successive quarterly declines in gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the nation's output. This two- quarter metric is now a commonly held definition of a recession. In the United States, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is regarded as the authority which identifies a recession and which takes into account several measures in addition to GDP growth before making an assessment. In many developed nations (but not the United States), the two-quarter rule is also used for identifying a recession.Japan's Economy Shrinks 0.4%, Confirming Recession By Jason Clenfield Whereas a national recession is identified by two quarters of decline, defining a global recession is more difficult, because a Developing country is expected to have a higher GDP growth than a Developed country. According to the IMF, the real GDP growth of the emerging and developing countries is on an uptrend and that of advanced economies is on a downtrend since late 1980s. The world growth is projected to slow from 5% in 2007 to 3.75% in 2008 and to just over 2% in 2009. Downward revisions in GDP growth vary across regions. Among the most affected are commodity exporters, and countries with acute external financing and liquidity problems. If a global recession were to occur in its full magnitude, an estimated 100 million jobs would be lost around the world, with total lost capital hovering at 120 trillion USD. Countries in East Asia (including China) have suffered smaller declines because their financial situations are more robust. They have benefited from falling commodity prices and they have initiated a shift toward macroeconomic policy easing. The IMF estimates that global recessions occur over a cycle lasting between eight and ten years. During what the IMF terms the past three global recessions of the last three decades, global per capita output growth was zero or negative.

Directed by Suman Mukherjee, the movie featured Rituparna Sengupta, Dhritiman Chaterji, Subrata Dutta, Joy Sengupta and Kabir Suman. Plot Based on the 1916 novel by author Rabindranath Tagore, Chaturanga is about a love caught between conflicting worlds of ideas. Set in Colonial Bengal at the turn of the twentieth century, the film weaves a rich tapestry of crisscrossing desires and moralities. The protagonist Sachish fleets from radical positivism to religious mysticism in his quest for life's meaning. However, his search ultimately yields nothing but crushing disillusionment. This is because he cannot square his abstract ideals with the powerful presences of two women in his life. One of them is Damini, a young Hindu widow, and the other is Nanibala, the abandoned mistress of Sachish's own brother. Sachish tries to convince himself that Nanibala is simply a helpless woman who needs to be 'rescued' by him. Similarly, during his later religious phase, he pretends that the widow Damini is merely an enticement of Nature that must be avoided at all costs for spiritual salvation. Chaturanga thus becomes, after a point, a psychodrama of cruelty. Nanibala becomes a victim of it because as a 'fallen woman' she can only be 'saved', but her humanity cannot be recognized. Damini is first given away by her dying husband, along with all her property, to a religious guru. She then falls in love with Sachish who can accept her only without her sexuality.

The divine is expressed in them through allegorical depictions of the illicit love between Krishna and Radha, who was actually his aunt. There is a radical side to this blend of eroticism and divinity. Radha's love for Krishna is beyond all social norms. It is directly expressed, without the priest or the Brahmin caste coming in between. When devotees sing and rejoice in that form of love, it is thus a popular and democratic process that defies caste divisions. # \\"Allah Ke Nur—Shafqat\\" — Amaanat Ali & Chorus #\\"Din Thakte Tiner Sadhan\\" — Kartick Das Baul #\\"Bhajo Patito Udhadharana\\"— Arijit Chakraborty & Chorus #\\"Hara Gauri Prananath\\" — Dohar #\\"Esraj\\" — Instrumental #\\"Hari Haraye Nama\\" — Monomoy Chakraborty & Chorus #\\"Jagohu Brishobhanu\\" — Sri Bani Kumar Chatterjee & Chorus #\\"Hese Khele Nao Re Jogu\\" — Neel Mukherjee & Chorus #\\"Rupo Lagi Aankhi Jhure\\" — Raghab Chatterjee #\\"Joy Radhe Radhe\\" — Arijit Chakraborty & Chorus #\\"Moula Tere Bina\\" — Shafqat Amaanat Ali & Chorus #\\"Nirodo Nayane\\" — Santa Das #\\"Background Music\\" — Instrumental #\\"Praner Majhe Sudha (Hum)\\" — Parama Banerjee #\\"Radha Madhabo\\" — Kabir Suman & Chorus #\\"Aalo Je Amar Gaan Kore\\" — Parama Banerjee References External links * *Official Website Category:2008 films Category:2000s Bengali-language films Category:Indian films Category:Bengali- language films Category:Films directed by Suman Mukhopadhyay Category:Films based on works by Rabindranath Tagore Category:Memorials to Rabindranath Tagore Category:Films scored by Debojyoti Mishra ","title":"Chaturanga (film)"},{"id":"20250709","text":"Anatoly Alexeyevich Karatsuba (his first name often spelled Anatolii) (; Grozny, Soviet Union, January 31, 1937 – Moscow, Russia, September 28, 2008http://iopscience.iop.org/1064-5632/72/6/E01/pdf/1064-5632_72_6_E01.pdf) was a Russian mathematician working in the field of analytic number theory, p-adic numbers and Dirichlet series. For most of his student and professional life he was associated with the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, defending a D.Sc. there entitled \\"The method of trigonometric sums and intermediate value theorems\\" in 1966. He later held a position at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences.1998 Russian Mathematical Survey 53 419 http://iopscience.iop.org/0036-0279/53/2/M21 His textbook Foundations of Analytic Number Theory went to two editions, 1975 and 1983. The Karatsuba algorithm is the earliest known divide and conquer algorithm for multiplication and lives on as a special case of its direct generalization, the Toom–Cook algorithm.D. Knuth, TAOCP vol. II, sec. 4.3.3 The main research works of Anatoly Karatsuba were published in more than 160 research papers and monographs.List of research works, Anatolii Karatsuba, Steklov Mathematical Institute (accessed March 2012). His daughter, Yekaterina Karatsuba, also a mathematician, constructed the FEE method.  Awards and Titles  * 1981: P.L.Tchebyshev Prize of Soviet Academy of Sciences * 1999: Distinguished Scientist of Russia * 2001: I.M.Vinogradov Prize of Russian Academy of Sciences  The early works on Informatics  As a student of Lomonosov Moscow State University, Karatsuba attended the seminar of Andrey Kolmogorov and found solutions to two problems set up by Kolmogorov. This was essential for the development of automata theory and started a new branch in Mathematics, the theory of fast algorithms.  Automata  In the paper of :Edward F. Moore, (n; m; p), an automat (or a machine) S, is defined as a device with n states, m input symbols and p output symbols. Nine theorems on the structure of S and experiments with S are proved. Later such S machines got the name of Moore machines. At the end of the paper, in the chapter «New problems», Moore formulates the problem of improving the estimates which he obtained in Theorems 8 and 9: : Theorem 8 (Moore). Given an arbitrary (n; m; p) machine S, such that every two states can be distinguished from each other, there exists an experiment of length n(n-1)/2 that identifies the state of S at the end of this experiment.'' In 1957 Karatsuba proved two theorems which completely solved the Moore problem on improving the estimate of the length of experiment in his Theorem 8. : Theorem A (Karatsuba). If S is a (n; m; p) machine such that each two its states can be distinguished from each other then there exists a ramified experiment of length at most , by means of which one can find the state S at the end of the experiment. : Theorem B (Karatsuba). There exists a (n; m; p) machine, every states of which can be distinguished from each other, such that the length of the shortest experiment finding the state of the machine at the end of the experiment, is equal to .'' These two theorems were proved by Karatsuba in his 4th year as a basis of his 4th year project; the corresponding paper was submitted to the journal \\"Uspekhi Mat. Nauk\\" on December 17, 1958 and published in June 1960. Up to this day (2011) this result of Karatsuba that later acquired the title \\"the Moore-Karatsuba theorem\\", remains the only precise (the only precise non-linear order of the estimate) non-linear result both in the automata theory and in the similar problems of the theory of complexity of computations. Works in Number Theory The main research works of A.A.Karatsuba were published in more than 160 research papers and monographs.  The p-adic method  A.A.Karatsuba constructed a new p-adic method in the theory of trigonometric sums. The estimates of so-called L-sums of the form : S = \\\\sum_{x=1}^P e^{2\\\\pi i (a_1x/p^n+ \\\\dots a_nx^n/p)}, \\\\quad (a_s,p) = 1, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le s \\\\le n, led to the new bounds for zeros of the Dirichlet L-series modulo a power of a prime number, to the asymptotic formula for the number of Waring congruence of the form : x_1^{n} + \\\\dots + x_t^{n} \\\\equiv N \\\\pmod{p^k}, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le x_s \\\\le P, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le s \\\\le n, \\\\quad P < p^k, to a solution of the problem of distribution of fractional parts of a polynomial with integer coefficients modulo p^k. A.A. Karatsuba was the first to realize in the p-adic form the «embedding principle» of Euler-Vinogradov and to compute a p-adic analog of Vinogradov u-numbers when estimating the number of solutions of a congruence of the Waring type. Assume that : x_1^{n} + \\\\dots + x_t^{n} \\\\equiv N \\\\pmod{Q}, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le x_s \\\\le P, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le s \\\\le t, \\\\quad (1) and moreover : P^r \\\\le Q < P^{r+1}, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le r \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{12}\\\\sqrt{n}, \\\\quad Q = p^k, \\\\quad k \\\\ge 4(r+1)n, where p is a prime number. Karatsuba proved that in that case for any natural number n \\\\ge 144 there exists a p_0 = p_0(n) such that for any p_0 > p_0(n) every natural number N can be represented in the form (1) for t \\\\ge 20r + 1, and for t < r there exist N such that the congruence (1) has no solutions. This new approach, found by Karatsuba, led to a new p-adic proof of the Vinogradov mean value theorem, which plays the central part in the Vinogradov's method of trigonometric sums. Another component of the p-adic method of A.A. Karatsuba is the transition from incomplete systems of equations to complete ones at the expense of the local p-adic change of unknowns. Let r be an arbitrary natural number, 1 \\\\le r \\\\le n. Determine an integer t by the inequalities m_t \\\\le r \\\\le m_{t+1}. Consider the system of equations : \\\\begin{cases} x_1^{m_1} + \\\\dots + x_k^{m_1} = y_1^{m_1} + \\\\dots + y_k^{m_1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dots\\\\dots\\\\dots\\\\dots\\\\dots\\\\dots\\\\dots\\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_1^{m_s} + \\\\dots + x_k^{m_s} = y_1^{m_s} + \\\\dots + y_k^{m_s}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_1^{n} + \\\\dots + x_k^{n} = y_1^{n} + \\\\dots + y_k^{n} \\\\end{cases} : 1 \\\\le x_1,\\\\dots,x_k,y_1,\\\\dots,y_k \\\\le P, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le m_1 < m_2 < \\\\dots < m_s < m_{s+1} = n. Karatsuba proved that the number of solutions I_k of this system of equations for k \\\\ge 6rn\\\\log n satisfies the estimate : I_k \\\\ll P^{2k-\\\\delta}, \\\\quad \\\\delta = m_1 + \\\\dots + m_t + (s-t+1)r. For incomplete systems of equations, in which the variables run through numbers with small prime divisors, Karatsuba applied multiplicative translation of variables. This led to an essentially new estimate of trigonometric sums and a new mean value theorem for such systems of equations.  The Hua Luogeng problem on the convergency exponent of the singular integral in the Terry problem  p-adic method of A.A.Karatsuba includes the techniques of estimating the measure of the set of points with small values of functions in terms of the values of their parameters (coefficients etc.) and, conversely, the techniques of estimating those parameters in terms of the measure of this set in the real and p-adic metrics. This side of Karatsuba's method manifested itself especially clear in estimating trigonometric integrals, which led to the solution of the problem of Hua Luogeng. In 1979 Karatsuba, together with his students G.I. Arkhipov and V.N. Chubarikov obtained a complete solution of the Hua Luogeng problem of finding the exponent of convergency of the integral: : \\\\vartheta_0=\\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\cdots\\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\biggl\\\\int\\\\limits_{0}^{1}e^{2\\\\pi i(\\\\alpha_{n}x^{n}+\\\\cdots +\\\\alpha_{1}x)}dx\\\\biggr^{2k}d\\\\alpha_{n}\\\\ldots d\\\\alpha_{1}, where n \\\\ge 2 is a fixed number. In this case, the exponent of convergency means the value \\\\gamma, such that \\\\vartheta_0 converges for 2k > \\\\gamma + \\\\varepsilon and diverges for 2k < \\\\gamma - \\\\varepsilon, where \\\\varepsilon > 0 is arbitrarily small. It was shown that the integral \\\\vartheta_{0} converges for 2k > \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(n^{2}+n)+1 and diverges for 2k \\\\le \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(n^{2}+n)+1. At the same time, the similar problem for the integral was solved: \\\\vartheta_1=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\biggl\\\\int_{0}^{1}e^{2\\\\pi i(\\\\alpha_n x^n + \\\\alpha_m x^m + \\\\cdots + \\\\alpha_r x^r)}dx\\\\biggr^{2k}d\\\\alpha_{n}d\\\\alpha_{m}\\\\ldots d\\\\alpha_{r}, where n, m, \\\\ldots, r are integers, satisfying the conditions : 1 \\\\le r < \\\\ldots < m < n, \\\\quad r + \\\\ldots + m + n < \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(n^2+n). Karatsuba and his students proved that the integral \\\\vartheta_1 converges, if 2k > n + m + \\\\ldots + r and diverges, if 2k \\\\le n + m + \\\\ldots + r. The integrals \\\\vartheta_0 and \\\\vartheta_1 arise in the studying of the so called Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem. Karatsuba and his students obtained a series of new results connected with the multi-dimensional analog of the Tarry problem. In particular, they proved that if F is a polynomial in r variables (r \\\\ge 2) of the form : F(x_{1},\\\\ldots, x_{r})\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\sum\\\\limits_{ u_{1} = 0}^{n_{1}}\\\\cdots \\\\sum\\\\limits_{ u_{r} = 0}^{n_{r}}\\\\alpha( u_{1},\\\\ldots, u_{r})x_{1}^{ u_{1}}\\\\ldots x_{r}^{ u_{r}}, with the zero free term, m = (n_{1}+1) \\\\ldots (n_{r}+1)-1, \\\\bar{\\\\alpha} is the m-dimensional vector, consisting of the coefficients of F, then the integral : \\\\vartheta_{2}=\\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\cdots \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\biggl\\\\int\\\\limits_{0}^{1}\\\\cdots\\\\int\\\\limits_{0}^{1}e^{2\\\\pi iF(x_{1},\\\\ldots, x_{r})}dx_{1}\\\\ldots dx_{r}\\\\biggr^{2k}d\\\\bar{\\\\alpha} converges for 2k > mn, where n is the highest of the numbers n_1, \\\\ldots, n_r. This result, being not a final one, generated a new area in the theory of trigonometric integrals, connected with improving the bounds of the exponent of convergency \\\\vartheta_2 (I. A. Ikromov, M. A. Chahkiev and others).  Multiple trigonometric sums  In 1966—1980, Karatsuba developed (with participation of his students G.I. Arkhipov and V.N. Chubarikov) the theory of multiple Hermann Weyl trigonometric sums, that is, the sums of the form : S = S(A) = \\\\sum_{x_1=1}^{P_1}\\\\dots\\\\sum_{x_r=1}^{P_r}e^{2\\\\pi i F(x_1,\\\\dots,x_r)} , where F(x_1,\\\\dots,x_r) = \\\\sum_{t_1=1}^{n_1}\\\\dots\\\\sum_{t_r=1}^{n_r}\\\\alpha(t_1,\\\\dots,t_r)x_1^{t_1}\\\\dots x_r^{t_r} , A is a system of real coefficients \\\\alpha(t_1,\\\\dots,t_r). The central point of that theory, as in the theory of the Vinogradov trigonometric sums, is the following mean value theorem. : Let n_1,\\\\dots,n_r,P_1,\\\\dots,P_r be natural numbers, P_1 = \\\\min(P_1,\\\\dots,P_r),m = (n_1+1)\\\\dots(n_r+1). Furthermore, let \\\\Omega be the m-dimensional cube of the form :: 0 \\\\le \\\\alpha(t_1,\\\\dots,t_r) < 1 , 0 \\\\le t_1 \\\\le n_1, \\\\dots,0 \\\\le t_r \\\\le n_r, in the euclidean space : and :: J = J(P_1,\\\\dots,P_r;n_1,\\\\dots,n_r;K,r) = \\\\underset{\\\\Omega}{\\\\int\\\\dots\\\\int}S(A)^{2K} dA . : Then for any \\\\tau \\\\ge 0 and K \\\\ge K_{\\\\tau} = m\\\\tau the value J can be estimated as follows :: J \\\\le K_{\\\\tau}^{2m\\\\tau}\\\\varkappa^{4\\\\varkappa^2\\\\Delta(\\\\tau)}2^{8m\\\\varkappa\\\\tau}(P_1\\\\dots P_r)^{2K}P^{-\\\\varkappa\\\\Delta(\\\\tau)} , : where \\\\varkappa = n_1 u_1+ \\\\dots + n_r u_r , \\\\gamma\\\\varkappa = 1, \\\\Delta(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{m}{2}(1-(1-\\\\gamma)^{\\\\tau}) , P = (P_1^{n_1}\\\\dots P_r^{n_r})^{\\\\gamma}, and the natural numbers u_1, \\\\dots , u_r are such that: :: -1 < \\\\frac{P_s}{P_1} - u_s \\\\le 0 , s= 1,\\\\dots , r . The mean value theorem and the lemma on the multiplicity of intersection of multi-dimensional parallelepipeds form the basis of the estimate of a multiple trigonometric sum, that was obtained by Karatsuba (two-dimensional case was derived by G.I. Arkhipov). Denoting by Q_0 the least common multiple of the numbers q(t_1,\\\\dots,t_r) with the condition t_1 + \\\\dots t_r \\\\ge 1, for Q_0 \\\\ge P^{1/6} the estimate holds : S(A) \\\\le (5n^{2n})^{r u(Q_0)}(\\\\tau(Q_0))^{r-1}P_1\\\\dots P_rQ^{-0.1\\\\mu} + 2^{8r}(r\\\\mu^{-1})^{r-1}P_1\\\\dots P_rP^{-0.05\\\\mu} , where \\\\tau(Q) is the number of divisors of the integer Q, and u(Q) is the number of distinct prime divisors of the number Q.  The estimate of the Hardy function in the Waring problem  Applying his p-adic form of the Hardy- Littlewood-Ramanujan-Vinogradov method to estimating trigonometric sums, in which the summation is taken over numbers with small prime divisors, Karatsuba obtained a new estimate of the well known Hardy function G(n) in the Waring's problem (for n \\\\ge 400): : \\\\\\\\! G(n) < 2 n\\\\log n + 2 n\\\\log\\\\log n + 12 n.  Multi-dimensional analog of the Waring problem  In his subsequent investigation of the Waring problem Karatsuba obtained the following two- dimensional generalization of that problem: Consider the system of equations : x_1^{n-i}y_1^i + \\\\dots + x_k^{n-i}y_k^i = N_i , i = 0,1,\\\\dots, n , where N_i are given positive integers with the same order or growth, N_0 \\\\to +\\\\infty, and x_{\\\\varkappa},y_{\\\\varkappa} are unknowns, which are also positive integers. This system has solutions, if k > cn^2\\\\log n , and if k < c_1n^2, then there exist such N_i, that the system has no solutions.  The Artin problem of local representation of zero by a form  Emil Artin had posed the problem on the p-adic representation of zero by a form of arbitrary degree d. Artin initially conjectured a result, which would now be described as the p-adic field being a C2 field; in other words non-trivial representation of zero would occur if the number of variables was at least d2. This was shown not to be the case by an example of Guy Terjanian. Karatsuba showed that, in order to have a non-trivial representation of zero by a form, the number of variables should grow faster than polynomially in the degree d; this number in fact should have an almost exponential growth, depending on the degree. Karatsuba and his student Arkhipov proved, that for any natural number r there exists n_0 = n_0(r), such that for any n \\\\ge n_0 there is a form with integral coefficients F(x_1,\\\\dots,x_k) of degree smaller than n, the number of variables of which is k, k \\\\ge 2^u, : u = \\\\frac{n}{(\\\\log_2n)(\\\\log_2\\\\log_2n) \\\\dots \\\\underbrace{(\\\\log_2\\\\dots\\\\log_2n)}_r\\\\underbrace{(\\\\log_2\\\\dots\\\\log_2n)^3}_{r+1}} which has only trivial representation of zero in the 2-adic numbers. They also obtained a similar result for any odd prime modulus p.  Estimates of short Kloosterman sums  Karatsuba developed (1993—1999) a new method of estimating short Kloosterman sums, that is, trigonometric sums of the form : \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n\\\\in A}\\\\exp{\\\\biggl(2\\\\pi i\\\\,\\\\frac{an^{*}+bn}{m}\\\\biggr)}, where n runs through a set A of numbers, coprime to m, the number of elements \\\\A\\\\ in which is essentially smaller than m, and the symbol n^{*} denotes the congruence class, inverse to n modulo m: nn^{*}\\\\equiv 1(\\\\mod m). Up to the early 1990s, the estimates of this type were known, mainly, for sums in which the number of summands was higher than \\\\sqrt{m} (H. D. Kloosterman, I. M. Vinogradov, H. Salié, L. Carlitz, S. Uchiyama, A. Weil). The only exception was the special moduli of the form m = p^{\\\\alpha}, where p is a fixed prime and the exponent \\\\alpha increases to infinity (this case was studied by A. G. Postnikov by means of the method of Vinogradov). Karatsuba's method makes it possible to estimate Kloosterman sums where the number of summands does not exceed :m^{\\\\varepsilon}, and in some cases even :\\\\exp{\\\\\\\\{(\\\\ln m)^{2/3+\\\\varepsilon}\\\\\\\\}}, where \\\\varepsilon > 0 is an arbitrarily small fixed number. The final paper of Karatsuba on this subject was published posthumously. Various aspects of the method of Karatsuba have found applications in the following problems of analytic number theory: * finding asymptotics of the sums of fractional parts of the form : {\\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}}'\\\\biggl\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{an^{*}+bn}{m}\\\\biggr\\\\\\\\}, {\\\\sum_{p\\\\le x}}'\\\\biggl\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{ap^{*}+bp}{m}\\\\biggr\\\\\\\\}, : where n runs, one after another, through the integers satisfying the condition (n,m)=1, and p runs through the primes that do not divide the module m (Karatsuba); * finding a lower bound for the number of solutions of inequalities of the form : \\\\alpha<\\\\biggl\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{an^{*}+bn}{m}\\\\biggr\\\\\\\\}\\\\le\\\\beta : in the integers n, 1\\\\le n\\\\le x, coprime to m, x<\\\\sqrt{m} (Karatsuba); * the precision of approximation of an arbitrary real number in the segment [0,1] by fractional parts of the form : \\\\biggl\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{an^{*}+bn}{m}\\\\biggr\\\\\\\\}, : where 1\\\\le n\\\\le x, (n,m)=1, x<\\\\sqrt{m} (Karatsuba); * a more precise constant c in the Brun–Titchmarsh theorem : \\\\pi(x;q,l)< \\\\frac{cx}{\\\\varphi(q)\\\\ln\\\\frac{2x}{q}}, : where \\\\pi(x;q,l) is the number of primes p, not exceeding x and belonging to the arithmetic progression p\\\\equiv l \\\\pmod{q} (J. Friedlander, H. Iwaniec); * a lower bound for the greatest prime divisor of the product of numbers of the form : n^{3}+2, N (D. R. Heath-Brown); * proving that there are infinitely many primes of the form: a^{2}+b^{4} (J. Friedlander, H. Iwaniec); * combinatorial properties of the set of numbers : n^{*} \\\\pmod{m} 1 \\\\le n \\\\le m^{\\\\varepsilon} (A. A. Glibichuk).  The Riemann zeta-function   The Selberg Zeroes  In 1984 Karatsuba proved, that for a fixed \\\\varepsilon satisfying the condition 0<\\\\varepsilon < 0.001, a sufficiently large T and H = T^{a+\\\\varepsilon}, a = \\\\tfrac{27}{82} = \\\\tfrac{1}{3} -\\\\tfrac{1}{246}, the interval (T,T+H) contains at least cH\\\\ln T real zeros of the Riemann zeta function \\\\zeta\\\\Bigl(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\\\Bigr). The special case H\\\\ge T^{1/2+\\\\varepsilon} was proven by Atle Selberg earlier in 1942. The estimates of Atle Selberg and Karatsuba can not be improved in respect of the order of growth as T\\\\to +\\\\infty.  Distribution of zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the short intervals of the critical line  Karatsuba also obtained a number of results about the distribution of zeros of \\\\zeta(s) on «short» intervals of the critical line. He proved that an analog of the Selberg conjecture holds for «almost all» intervals (T,T+H], H = T^{\\\\varepsilon}, where \\\\varepsilon is an arbitrarily small fixed positive number. Karatsuba developed (1992) a new approach to investigating zeros of the Riemann zeta-function on «supershort» intervals of the critical line, that is, on the intervals (T,T+H], the length H of which grows slower than any, even arbitrarily small degree T. In particular, he proved that for any given numbers \\\\varepsilon, \\\\varepsilon_{1} satisfying the conditions 0<\\\\varepsilon, \\\\varepsilon_{1}<1 almost all intervals (T,T+H] for H\\\\ge\\\\exp{\\\\\\\\{(\\\\ln T)^{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\\\\\}} contain at least H(\\\\ln T)^{1-\\\\varepsilon_{1}} zeros of the function \\\\zeta\\\\bigl(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\\\bigr). This estimate is quite close to the one that follows from the Riemann hypothesis.  Zeros of linear combinations of Dirichlet L-series  Karatsuba developed a new method of investigating zeros of functions which can be represented as linear combinations of Dirichlet L-series. The simplest example of a function of that type is the Davenport-Heilbronn function, defined by the equality : f(s)=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(1-i\\\\kappa)L(s,\\\\chi)+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(1 \\\\,+\\\\,i\\\\kappa)L(s,\\\\bar{\\\\chi}), where \\\\chi is a non-principal character modulo 5 (\\\\chi(1) = 1, \\\\chi(2) = i, \\\\chi(3) = -i, \\\\chi(4) = -1, \\\\chi(5) = 0, \\\\chi(n+5) = \\\\chi(n) for any n), : \\\\kappa=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{10-2\\\\sqrt{5}}-2}{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}. For f(s) Riemann hypothesis is not true, however, the critical line Re \\\\ s = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} contains, nevertheless, anormally many zeros. Karatsuba proved (1989) that the interval (T, T+H], H = T^{27/82+\\\\varepsilon}, contains at least : H(\\\\ln T)^{1/2}e^{-c\\\\sqrt{\\\\ln\\\\ln T}} zeros of the function f\\\\bigl(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\\\bigr). Similar results were obtained by Karatsuba also for linear combinations containing arbitrary (finite) number of summands; the degree exponent \\\\tfrac{1}{2} is here replaced by a smaller number \\\\beta, that depends only on the form of the linear combination.  The boundary of zeros of the zeta function and the multi-dimensional problem of Dirichlet divisors  thumb To Karatsuba belongs a new breakthrough result in the multi- dimensional problem of Dirichlet divisors, which is connected with finding the number D_{k}(x) of solutions of the inequality x_{1}*\\\\ldots *x_{k}\\\\le x in the natural numbers x_{1}, \\\\ldots, x_{k} as x\\\\to +\\\\infty. For D_{k}(x) there is an asymptotic formula of the form : D_{k}(x) = xP_{k-1}(\\\\ln x)+R_{k}(x) , where P_{k-1}(u) is a polynomial of degree (k-1), the coefficients of which depend on k and can be found explicitly and R_{k}(x) is the remainder term, all known estimates of which (up to 1960) were of the form : R_{k}(x) \\\\le x^{1-\\\\alpha(k)}(c\\\\ln x)^{k} , where \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{ak+b}, a,b,c are some absolute positive constants. Karatsuba obtained a more precise estimate of R_{k}(x), in which the value \\\\alpha(k) was of order k^{-2/3} and was decreasing much slower than \\\\alpha(k) in the previous estimates. Karatsuba's estimate is uniform in x and k; in particular, the value k may grow as x grows (as some power of the logarithm of x). (A similar looking, but weaker result was obtained in 1960 by a German mathematician Richert, whose paper remained unknown to Soviet mathematicians at least until the mid-seventies.) Proof of the estimate of R_{k}(x) is based on a series of claims, essentially equivalent to the theorem on the boundary of zeros of the Riemann zeta function, obtained by the method of Vinogradov, that is, the theorem claiming that \\\\zeta(s) has no zeros in the region : Re \\\\ s \\\\ge 1 - \\\\frac{c}{(\\\\ln t)^{2/3}(\\\\ln\\\\ln t)^{1/3}},\\\\quad t> 10 . Karatsuba found (2000) the backward relation of estimates of the values R_{k}(x) with the behaviour of \\\\zeta(s) near the line Re \\\\ s = 1. In particular, he proved that if \\\\alpha(y) is an arbitrary non-increasing function satisfying the condition 1/y \\\\le \\\\alpha(y)\\\\le 1/2, such that for all k\\\\ge 2 the estimate : R_{k}(x) \\\\le x^{1-\\\\alpha(k)}(c\\\\ln x)^{k} holds, then \\\\zeta(s) has no zeros in the region : Re \\\\ s \\\\ge 1 - c_{1}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\alpha(\\\\ln t)}{\\\\ln\\\\ln t},\\\\quad t\\\\ge e^{2} (c, c_{1} are some absolute constants).  Estimates from below of the maximum of the modulus of the zeta function in small regions of the critical domain and on small intervals of the critical line  Karatsuba introduced and studied the functions F(T;H) and G(s_{0};\\\\Delta), defined by the equalities : F(T;H) = \\\\max_{t-T\\\\le H}\\\\bigl\\\\zeta\\\\bigl(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\\\bigr)\\\\bigr,\\\\quad G(s_{0};\\\\Delta) = \\\\max_{s-s_{0}\\\\le\\\\Delta}\\\\zeta(s). Here T is a sufficiently large positive number, 0, s_{0} = \\\\sigma_{0}+iT, \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\le\\\\sigma_{0}\\\\le 1, 0<\\\\Delta < \\\\tfrac{1}{3}. Estimating the values F and G from below shows, how large (in modulus) values \\\\zeta(s) can take on short intervals of the critical line or in small neighborhoods of points lying in the critical strip 0\\\\le Re \\\\ s\\\\le 1. The case H\\\\gg \\\\ln\\\\ln T was studied earlier by Ramachandra; the case \\\\Delta > c, where c is a sufficiently large constant, is trivial. Karatsuba proved, in particular, that if the values H and \\\\Delta exceed certain sufficiently small constants, then the estimates F(T;H) \\\\ge T^{- c_{1}},\\\\quad G(s_{0}; \\\\Delta) \\\\ge T^{-c_{2}}, hold, where c_{1}, c_{2} are certain absolute constants.  Behaviour of the argument of the zeta-function on the critical line  Karatsuba obtained a number of new results related to the behaviour of the function S(t) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\arg{\\\\zeta\\\\bigl(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\\\bigr)}, which is called the argument of Riemann zeta function on the critical line (here \\\\arg{\\\\zeta\\\\bigl(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\\\bigr)} is the increment of an arbitrary continuous branch of \\\\arg\\\\zeta(s) along the broken line joining the points 2, 2+it and \\\\tfrac{1}{2}+it). Among those results are the mean value theorems for the function S(t) and its first integral S_{1}(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t}S(u)du on intervals of the real line, and also the theorem claiming that every interval (T,T+H] for H \\\\ge T^{27/82+\\\\varepsilon} contains at least : H(\\\\ln T)^{1/3}e^{-c\\\\sqrt{\\\\ln\\\\ln T}} points where the function S(t) changes sign. Earlier similar results were obtained by Atle Selberg for the case H\\\\ge T^{1/2+\\\\varepsilon}.  The Dirichlet characters   Estimates of short sums of characters in finite fields  In the end of the sixties Karatsuba, estimating short sums of Dirichlet characters, developed a new method, making it possible to obtain non-trivial estimates of short sums of characters in finite fields. Let n\\\\ge 2 be a fixed integer, F(x) = x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\\\ldots + a_{1}x + a_{0} a polynomial, irreducible over the field \\\\mathbb{Q} of rational numbers, \\\\theta a root of the equation F(\\\\theta) = 0, \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\theta) the corresponding extension of the field \\\\mathbb{Q}, \\\\omega_{1},\\\\ldots, \\\\omega_{n} a basis of \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\theta), \\\\omega_{1} = 1, \\\\omega_{2} = \\\\theta, \\\\omega_{3} = \\\\theta^{2},\\\\ldots, \\\\omega_{n} = \\\\theta^{n-1}. Furthermore, let p be a sufficiently large prime, such that F(x) is irreducible modulo p, \\\\mathrm{GF}(p^{n}) the Galois field with a basis \\\\omega_{1}, \\\\omega_{2}, \\\\ldots,\\\\omega_{n}, \\\\chi a non-principal Dirichlet character of the field \\\\mathrm{GF}(p^{n}). Finally, let u_{1},\\\\ldots, u_{n} be some nonnegative integers, D(X) the set of elements \\\\bar{x} of the Galois field \\\\mathrm{GF}(p^{n}), : \\\\bar{x} = x_{1}\\\\omega_{1} + \\\\ldots + x_{n}\\\\omega_{n} , such that for any i, 1\\\\le i\\\\le n, the following inequalities hold: : u_{i} < x_{i} < u_{i} + X . Karatsuba proved that for any fixed k, k\\\\ge n+1, and arbitrary X satisfying the condition : p^{\\\\frac{1}{4}+\\\\frac{1}{4k}} \\\\le X \\\\le p^{\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{4k}} the following estimate holds: : \\\\biggl\\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\bar{x}\\\\in D(X)}\\\\chi(\\\\bar{x})\\\\biggr\\\\le c\\\\Bigl(X^{1-\\\\frac{1}{k}}p^{\\\\frac{1}{4k}+\\\\frac{1}{ 4k^{2}}}\\\\Bigr)^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!n}(\\\\ln p)^{\\\\gamma}, where \\\\gamma = \\\\frac{1}{k}(2^{n+1}-1), and the constant c depends only on n and the basis \\\\omega_{1},\\\\ldots, \\\\omega_{n}.  Estimates of linear sums of characters over shifted prime numbers  Karatsuba developed a number of new tools, which, combined with the Vinogradov method of estimating sums with prime numbers, enabled him to obtain in 1970 an estimate of the sum of values of a non-principal character modulo a prime q on a sequence of shifted prime numbers, namely, an estimate of the form : \\\\biggl\\\\sum\\\\limits_{p\\\\le N}\\\\chi(p+k)\\\\biggr\\\\le cNq^{-\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^{2}}{1024}}, where k is an integer satisfying the condition k ot\\\\equiv 0 (\\\\mod q), \\\\varepsilon an arbitrarily small fixed number, N\\\\ge q^{1/2+\\\\varepsilon}, and the constant c depends on \\\\varepsilon only. This claim is considerably stronger than the estimate of Vinogradov, which is non-trivial for N\\\\ge q^{3/4+\\\\varepsilon}. In 1971 speaking at the International conference on number theory on the occasion of the 80th birthday of Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov, Academician Yuri Linnik noted the following: «Of a great importance are the investigations carried out by Vinogradov in the area of asymptotics of Dirichlet character on shifted primes \\\\sum\\\\limits_{p\\\\le N}\\\\chi(p+k), which give a decreased power compared to N compared to N\\\\ge q^{3/4+\\\\varepsilon}, \\\\varepsilon > 0, where q is the modulus of the character. This estimate is of crucial importance, as it is so deep that gives more than the extended Riemann hypothesis, and, it seems, in that directions is a deeper fact than that conjecture (if the conjecture is true). Recently this estimate was improved by A.A.Karatsuba». This result was extended by Karatsuba to the case when p runs through the primes in an arithmetic progression, the increment of which grows with the modulus q.  Estimates of sums of characters on polynomials with a prime argument  Karatsuba found a number of estimates of sums of Dirichlet characters in polynomials of degree two for the case when the argument of the polynomial runs through a short sequence of subsequent primes. Let, for instance, q be a sufficiently high prime, f(x) = (x-a)(x-b), where a and b are integers, satisfying the condition ab(a-b) ot\\\\equiv 0 (\\\\mod q), and let \\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{q}\\\\right) denote the Legendre symbol, then for any fixed \\\\varepsilon with the condition 0<\\\\varepsilon<\\\\tfrac{1}{2} and N>q^{3/4+\\\\varepsilon} for the sum S_{N}, : S_{N} = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{p\\\\le N}\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{f(p)}{q}\\\\biggr), the following estimate holds: : S_{N} \\\\le c\\\\pi(N)q^{-\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^{2}}{100}} (here p runs through subsequent primes, \\\\pi(N) is the number of primes not exceeding N, and c is a constant, depending on \\\\varepsilon only). A similar estimate was obtained by Karatsuba also for the case when p runs through a sequence of primes in an arithmetic progression, the increment of which may grow together with the modulus q. Karatsuba conjectured that the non-trivial estimate of the sum S_{N} for N, which are \\"small\\" compared to q, remains true in the case when f(x) is replaced by an arbitrary polynomial of degree n, which is not a square modulo q. This conjecture is still open.  Lower bounds for sums of characters in polynomials  Karatsuba constructed an infinite sequence of primes p and a sequence of polynomials f(x) of degree n with integer coefficients, such that f(x) is not a full square modulo p, : \\\\frac{4(p-1)}{\\\\ln p} \\\\le n \\\\le \\\\frac{8(p-1)}{\\\\ln p}, and such that : \\\\sum\\\\limits_{x =1}^{p}\\\\left(\\\\frac{f(x)}{p}\\\\right) = p. In other words, for any x the value f(x) turns out to be a quadratic residues modulo p. This result shows that André Weil's estimate \\\\biggl\\\\sum\\\\limits_{x=1}^{p}\\\\left(\\\\frac{f(x)}{p}\\\\right)\\\\biggr \\\\le (n-1)\\\\sqrt{p} cannot be essentially improved and the right hand side of the latter inequality cannot be replaced by say the value C\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\sqrt{p}, where C is an absolute constant.  Sums of characters on additive sequences  Karatsuba found a new method, making it possible to obtain rather precise estimates of sums of values of non-principal Dirichlet characters on additive sequences, that is, on sequences consisting of numbers of the form , where the variables x and y runs through some sets A and B independently of each other. The most characteristic example of that kind is the following claim which is applied in solving a wide class of problems, connected with summing up values of Dirichlet characters. Let \\\\varepsilon be an arbitrarily small fixed number, 0<\\\\varepsilon<\\\\tfrac{1}{2}, q a sufficiently large prime, \\\\chi a non-principal character modulo q. Furthermore, let A and B be arbitrary subsets of the complete system of congruence classes modulo q, satisfying only the conditions \\\\A\\\\>q^{\\\\varepsilon}, \\\\B\\\\>q^{1/2+\\\\varepsilon}. Then the following estimate holds: : \\\\biggl\\\\sum\\\\limits_{x\\\\in A}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{y\\\\in B}\\\\chi(x+y)\\\\biggr\\\\le c\\\\A\\\\\\\\cdot\\\\B\\\\ q^{-\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^{2}}{20}},\\\\quad c = c(\\\\varepsilon)>0. Karatsuba's method makes it possible to obtain non-trivial estimates of that sort in certain other cases when the conditions for the sets A and B, formulated above, are replaced by different ones, for example: \\\\A\\\\>q^{\\\\varepsilon}, \\\\sqrt{\\\\A\\\\}\\\\cdot\\\\B\\\\> q^{1/2+\\\\varepsilon}. In the case when A and B are the sets of primes in intervals (1,X], (1,Y] respectively, where X\\\\ge q^{1/4+\\\\varepsilon}, Y\\\\ge q^{1/4+\\\\varepsilon}, an estimate of the form : \\\\biggl\\\\sum\\\\limits_{p\\\\le X}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{p'\\\\le Y}\\\\chi(p+p')\\\\biggr\\\\le c\\\\pi(X)\\\\pi(Y)q^{-c_{1}\\\\varepsilon^{2}}, holds, where \\\\pi(Z) is the number of primes, not exceeding Z, c = c(\\\\varepsilon)>0, and c_{1} is some absolute constant.  Distribution of power congruence classes and primitive roots in sparse sequences  Karatsuba obtained (2000) non- trivial estimates of sums of values of Dirichlet characters \\"with weights\\", that is, sums of components of the form \\\\chi(n)f(n), where f(n) is a function of natural argument. Estimates of that sort are applied in solving a wide class of problems of number theory, connected with distribution of power congruence classes, also primitive roots in certain sequences. Let k\\\\ge 2 be an integer, q a sufficiently large prime, (a,q) = 1, a\\\\le \\\\sqrt{q}, N\\\\ge q^{\\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2(k+1)}+\\\\varepsilon}, where 0<\\\\varepsilon<\\\\min{\\\\\\\\{0.01, \\\\tfrac{2}{3(k+1)}\\\\\\\\}}, and set, finally, : D_{k}(x) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{x_{1}*\\\\ldots *x_{k}\\\\le x}1 = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n\\\\le x}\\\\tau_{k}(n) (for an asymptotic expression for D_{k}(x), see above, in the section on the multi-dimensional problem of Dirichlet divisors). For the sums V_{1}(x) and V_{2}(x) of the values \\\\tau_{k}(n), extended on the values n \\\\le x, for which the numbers (n+a) are quadratic residues (respectively, non- residues) modulo q, Karatsuba obtained asymptotic formulas of the form : V_{1}(x) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}D_{k}(x) + O\\\\bigl(xq^{-0.01\\\\varepsilon^{2}}\\\\bigr),\\\\quad V_{2}(x) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}D_{k}(x) + O\\\\bigl(xq^{-0.01\\\\varepsilon^{2}}\\\\bigr) . Similarly, for the sum V(x) of values \\\\tau_{k}(n), taken over all n\\\\le x, for which (n+a) is a primitive root modulo q, one gets an asymptotic expression of the form : V(x) = \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{p_{1}}\\\\right)\\\\ldots \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{p_{s}}\\\\right)D_{k}(x) + O\\\\bigl(xq^{-0.01\\\\varepsilon^{2}}\\\\bigr) , where p_{1},\\\\ldots, p_{s} are all prime divisors of the number q-1. Karatsuba applied his method also to the problems of distribution of power residues (non-residues) in the sequences of shifted primes p+a, of the integers of the type x^{2}+y^{2}+a and some others.  Works of his later years  In his later years, apart from his research in number theory (see Karatsuba phenomenon, Karatsuba studied certain problems of theoretical physics, in particular in the area of quantum field theory. Applying his ATS theorem and some other number-theoretic approaches, he obtained new results in the Jaynes–Cummings model in quantum optics.  Personal life  In Crimea All his life Karatsuba enjoyed many sports: in his younger years, athletics, weightlifting and wrestling, then hiking, rock climbing, caving and mountaineering. In Pamir Four times he climbed Mount Elbrus. He hiked in the mountains of Caucasus, Pamir Mountains and, especially in the last years of his life, Tian Shan in Zailiysky Alatau and Teskey Ala-Too. He loved classical music and knew it very well, especially Johann Sebastian Bach and Antonio Vivaldi.

JDEM was a partnership between NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy. In August 2010, the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Science Foundation recommended the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission, a renamed JDEM-Omega proposal which has superseded SNAP, Destiny, and ADEPT, as the highest priority for development in the decade around 2020. This would be a 1.5-meter telescope with a 144-megapixel HgCdTe focal plane array, located at the L2 Lagrange point. The expected cost is around $1.6 billion. Earlier proposals Dark Energy Space Telescope (Destiny) The Dark Energy Space Telescope (Destiny), was a planned project by NASA and DOE, designed to perform precision measurements of the universe to provide an understanding of dark energy. The space observatory will derive the expansion of the universe by measuring up to 3,000 distant supernovae each year of its three-year mission lifetime, and will additionally study the structure of matter in the universe by measuring millions of galaxies in a weak gravitational lensing survey. The Destiny spacecraft features an optical telescope with a 1.65m primary mirror. The telescope images infrared light onto an array of solid- state detectors. The mission is designed to be deployed in a halo orbit about the sun-earth Lagrangian point.Destiny project website The Destiny proposal has been superseded by the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) The Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) Mission is expected to provide an understanding of the mechanism driving the acceleration of the universe and determine the nature of dark energy. To achieve these goals, the spacecraft needs to be able detect these supernovas when they are at their brightest moment.An Integral Field Spectrograph for SNAP Supernova Identification, https://arxiv.org/ftp/astro- ph/papers/0210/0210087.pdf The mission is proposed as an experiment for the JDEM.SNAP-Kent, The satellite observatory would be capable of measuring up to 2,000 distant supernovae each year of its three-year mission lifetime. SNAP will also observe the small distortions of light from distant galaxies to reveal more about the expansion history of the universe.SNAP homepage, http://snap.lbl.gov/science/index.php The SNAP is still in the proposal stages, and has yet to receive final approval. Should it be approved, the hoped launch date is 2013. To understand what is driving the acceleration of the universe, scientists need to see greater redshifts from supernovas than what is seen from Earth. The SNAP can detect redshifts of 1.7 from distant supernovas up to 10 billion light years away. At this distance, the acceleration of the universe will be easily seen. To measure the presence of dark energy, a process called weak lensing will be used.How Is SNAP Going to Learn About Dark Energy?, http://snap.lbl.gov/science/how.php The SNAP will use an optical setup called the three-mirror anastigmat. This consists of a main mirror with a diameter of 2 meters to take in light. It reflects this light to a second mirror. Then this light is transferred to two additional smaller mirrors which direct the light to the spacecraft's instruments. It will also contain 72 different cameras. 36 of them are able to detect visible light and the other 36 detect infrared light. Its cameras combined produces the equivalence of a 600 megapixel camera. The resolution of the camera is about 0.2 arcseconds in the visible spectrum and 0.3 arcseconds in the infrared spectrum. The SNAP will also have a spectrograph attached to it. The purpose of it is to detect what type of supernova SNAP is observing, determine the redshift, detect changes between different supernovas, and store supernova spectra for future reference.Spacecraft and orbit, http://snap.lbl.gov/mission/spacecraft.php JDEM has recognized several potential problems of the SNAP project: # The supernovas that SNAP will detect may not all be SN 1a type. Some other 1b and 1c type supernovas have similar spectra which could potentially confuse SNAP. # Hypothetical gray dust could contaminate results. Gray dust absorbs all wavelengths of light, making supernovas dimmer than they actually are. # The behavior of supernovas could potentially be altered by its binary-star system. # Any objects between the viewed supernova and the SNAP could gravitationally produce inaccurate results.Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP): An Experiment to Measure the Properties of the Accelerating Universe, http://supernova.lbl.gov/~evlinder/snap_sum.pdf See also *Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (2009–2011) References External links * JDEM at Berkley Lab Category:Space telescopes Category:Cancelled spacecraft Category:Spacecraft using halo orbits ","title":"Joint Dark Energy Mission"},{"id":"20250809","text":"Teenage marriage is the union of two adolescents, ranging in age from 13 to 19, who are joined in marriage. Many factors contribute to teenage marriage such as love, teenage pregnancy, religion, security, wealth, family, peer pressure, arranged marriage, economic and/or political reasons, social advancement, and cultural reasons. Studies have shown that teenage married couples are often less advantageous, may come from broken homes, may have little education, and work low status jobs in comparison with those that marry after adolescence. A majority of teenage marriages suffer from complications, with many ending in divorce. In the United States, half of teenage marriages dissolve within 15 years of the marriage. Even in Nepal girls and boys who marry without their consent before age 12 in most rural regions later end up divorced saying that they were married at a young age and were unknown about it and don't want to live with each other any more. The rate of teenage marriage, however, is decreasing due to the many opportunities that are available now that previously were not available before. Christian teenage marriage in the Middle Ages In the 21st century, teenage marriage is largely unrecognized or illegal in most countries, as most laws classify it as child abuse. Teenage marriage continues to be most prevalent in culturally or geographically isolated parts of the world, and it is decreasing where education is the main focus of the population. Background The legal status of circumstances surrounding teenage marriage varies from one area or era to the next. Marriage has often been used as a tool to create allegiances or agreements, rather than a link between two people in love. Almost every country has a legal minimum age for marriage, which ranges from as low as 12 in some Latin American countries to as high as 22 in China. The age requirement is commonly 16 for women and 18 for men. Despite laws concerning the age of marriage, tradition usually takes precedence and marriage continues to occur at very young ages. In many African and Asian countries as much as two-thirds of teenage women are or have been married. In many nations, marrying off a young daughter means one less mouth to feed and no fear of illegitimate children, a dishonor to the family. But these youthful brides often suffer physical and psychological damage, according to a UNICEF report. Historically, most marriages in western culture have had a late age of marriage and an emphasis on the nuclear family. The percentage of women ages 15-19 who are married in the United States is 3.9%, while in the Democratic Republic of the Congo the percentage is 74%. In the U.S., teenage marriages declined significantly after the mid-20th century, but experienced resurgence in the 1990s, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Census data from 2000 show that 4.5% of 15- to 19-year-olds were married, up from 3.4% in 1990. While that was an increase of almost 50%, it was still far below the 9.5% recorded in 1950.Senderowitz, Judith. Adolescent Health: Reassessing the Passage to Adulthood. Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 1995.  History   Pre-20th century  * According to a study of U.S. census data, in 1890 there were 9.7 percent of teen girls and 0.5 percent of teen boys between the ages of 15 and 19 years who had been married at some time.  20th century   1940s–1950s  * After the Second World War, there was a significant increase in teen marriage. During the 1940s, nearly 12 percent of teen girls between the ages of 15 and 19 years old had been married. This number increased to over 17 percent by the 1950s.  1960s  * More teen girls were getting married than boys. A study found that 32.1 percent of teens girls at ages 18-19 were married while only 8.9 percent of teen boys got married.  1970s  * Less teenagers got married. Only 11.9 percent of girls and 4.1 percent of boys ages 15-19 got married in 1970. Religious aspect The article Religious Heritage and Teenage Marriage suggests that many religions such as Pentecostalism, Fundamentalist Christianity, and other institutionalized sects give the message that leads parents and teens to view early marriage as the only acceptable means of culminating romantic relationships. It also became the tradition to the first generation. More recently, research shows that religion has slowed down the rates of teen marriage and teen pregnancy rate since 1991, a reversal of earlier trends. Legal aspect In the Siriono culture of Bolivia, a girl may marry before she reaches puberty. The Murnigin girl of Australia is likely to become a wife when her breasts first begin to develop. The Murmuring boy of Australia might marry for the first time when his beard begins to appear. A Lepcha girl in Tibet is sometimes married at eight years of age, while boys are often married when they are 12 years old. Boys marry at 15 years of age or less in 10 percent of 58 societies. Another 42 percent marry between 16 and 19 years of age. Thirty-eight percent marry in their twenties, and 10 percent marry when they are 30 years of age. (Ayer) Scientists and psychologists made a discovery in 1963 that in traditional societies, boys and girls have usually begun to do serious work well before they reach puberty. Girls are often doing womanly work at a certain age: cooking, weaving, gardening, and taking care of their siblings from the age of six to the age of nine. Some girls have to do these chores at an even earlier age like three or four. Boys on the other hand, learn how to farm, herd, and hunt before they reach manhood. Some mothers and fathers attempt to let their children to choose their potential loved ones. However, about 70% of decisions regarding marriage of children are made by their parents. Parents who fail to marry a child at the proper age are thought to be neglecting their responsibilities. These parents usually have their reputations ruined. Across cultures, females tend to be married earlier than males. Boys are married later than girls in 85 percent of 45 cultures. In the remaining 15 percent, both sexes marry at a roughly the same age. The differential in age of marriage for males and females is from one to five years in 78 percent of 37 societies and between six and ten years in another 18 percent. US state listing of teen marriage license laws ; Alabama :* Under 18 applicants need certified copy of birth certificate, both parents must be present with identification, or if you have a legal guardian they must be present with a court order and identification. If one or both parents are deceased, proper evidence of such must be provided. ; Alaska :* Under 18 applicants need certified copy of birth certificate, both parents must be present with identification, or if you have a legal guardian they must be present with a court order and identification. ; Arizona :* If applicant is under the age of 16, either a notarized parental consent form is needed, or the parents must accompany the applicant, present the proper identification, and sign the parental consent form in front of the clerk issuing the license. :* If applicant is age 16 – 17 one of the following documents showing proof of age is needed: :** certified copy of birth certificate :** current driver's license :** state or military I.D. card :** or current passport :* If applicant is age 16 or under, a court order is also necessary. ; Arkansas :* Under 18 requires consent of both sets of parents. ; California :* If either the bride or groom is under 18, at least one of the minor's parents, or legal guardian, must appear with the couple. Certified copies of birth certificates are required. The couple must also schedule an appointment with a counselor and then appear before a superior court judge. ; Colorado :* If applicant is 16 or 17, consent of both parents (or parent having legal custody), or guardian, or judicial approval is necessary. :* Before August of 2019, if applicant is under 16, a Judicial Court Order along with parental consent is necessary. ; Connecticut :* If applicant is under the age of 18 written consent of the parent or guardian is required and under the age of 16 the Judge of probate must endorse with written consent on the license. Results and consequences Consequences According to the book of Eleanor H. Ayer, another situation that could lead teenagers to an early marriage is often unprotected sex, which could lead to a pregnancy.Ayer, Eleanor H. Teen Marriage. The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc. 1990., Other factors that also lead to marriage are love, lust, fear of losing their partner, abuse, extreme parental control, sexual harassment and step-family difficulties. Results One in three teen marriages ends in divorce by the age of 25. Additionally, according to Bob and Sheri Stitof, \\"marriages and divorce rates have increased by 68 percent since 1995. Also, one out of every four teenagers have parents that are divorced.\\" See also *List of youngest wives *Child marriage *Marriageable age *Age of consent *Teenage pregnancy References External links *Teenagers: Marriages, Divorces, Parenthood, and Mortality CDC, U.S. Government *Early Teen Marriage and Future Poverty Demography, August 2010 *Teenage marriage and births in developed countries OECD Countries Category:Types of marriage Category:Marriage age ","title":"Teenage marriage"},{"id":"20250821","text":"Robert Earl (Bob) Winograd (born June 6, 1950) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey player.

Todd Dickinson (December 21, 1952 – May 3, 2020) was an Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). He was an Executive Director of the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA), and had been mentioned by some sources for possible reappointment to his former post as Director of the USPTO by the Barack Obama administration prior to the appointment of David Kappos to that post. Personal Dickinson was born in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, the eldest son of John and Martha Dickinson. He and his brother John grew up in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, graduating from Mt. Lebanon High School. Dickinson and his husband Robert H. Atkins married in 2017, after a decade as partners, they lived in The Plains, Virginia. Early career Dickinson earned a B.S. degree in Chemistry from Allegheny College in 1974, and a J.D. from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1977. He was a member of the Bars of Pennsylvania, California, and Illinois, and was registered to practice before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Dickinson began his legal career as a patent and trademark lawyer with Baxter Travenol Laboratories in Deerfield, Illinois, and then took a job with the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania law firm of Blenko, Buell, Ziesenheim and Beck. From 1981 to 1990, he served as counsel for Chevron Corporation in San Francisco, California, focusing on domestic and international intellectual property matters. Dickinson was a founding member of the Bay Area Lawyers for Individual Freedom and served as a national governor of the Human Rights Campaign. In 1990, Dickinson moved to Philadelphia to be Chief Counsel for Intellectual Property and Technology at Sun Company, Inc., a post he would hold until 1995, when he joined the law firm of Dechert Price & Rhoads. Dickinson was a founding master of the Benjamin Franklin Inn of Court, for intellectual property, in Philadelphia. He was also a member of the Liberty City LGBT+ Democratic Club, the Pride of Philadelphia Election Committee, and the LGBTQ Bar Association. Career at the USPTO President Bill Clinton appointed Dickinson Deputy Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks in June 1998, and he became the Acting Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks on January 1, 1999, succeeding Bruce Lehman. Dickinson was nominated for Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks by President Clinton on July 31, 1999. After confirmation by the Senate, Dickinson took the oath of office, on November 17, 1999, as Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. In 1999, Congress passed the American Inventors Protection Act, which changed the office and titles to Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Dickinson served as the first Under Secretary and Director of the USPTO, until January 2001. After the USPTO After leaving the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Dickinson joined the Washington, D.C. office of Howrey Simon Arnold & White, becoming co-chair of its intellectual property practice.

Thompson founded in 1998 True Tunes News out of his Wheaton, Illinois Christian record shop, True Tunes. The store itself, founded in 1989, with Chris Langill, was relatively unique because it focused exclusively on alternative Christian music at a time when Christian bookstores wouldn't carry products based on rock, hip hop, or other hard forms of music. In 1995 Thompson founded a live music club for Christian acts called True Tunes Upstairs. In 1997 the store, magazine, and related assets were bought by the Charlottesville, VA based company Journey Communications. Journey closed the shop in early 1998 citing lagging sales due to the spread of alternative Christian music to larger retailers, and turned operations to the printed magazine and the internet. Despite competition from CCM, HM, and 7ball magazines True Tunes News was extremely successful, achieving a worldwide circulation of 50,000 issues by 1993. This made it the largest Christian rock magazine by circulation, a title it held through the late 1990s. In the late 1990s the magazine ran into financial trouble when several of the record labels whose advertising financed it and it went defunct in 1998. When it ceased publishing the editors turned to the internet for distribution, but this effort has now been disbanded.

This meant a factory could be set up anywhere in India and the transportation of minerals would be subsidised by the central government. The policy was introduced in 1952, and remained in force until 1993. The policy hurt the economic prospects of the mineral-rich states like Bihar (including present-day Jharkhand), West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh (including present-day Chhattisgarh) and Odisha, since it weakened the incentives for private capital to establish production facilities in these areas. As a result of the policy, businesses preferred setting up industrial locations closer to the coastal trade hubs and markets in other parts of the country.  Rationale  The freight equalisation concept made \\"essential\\" items available at same prices throughout the country. These items included coal, steel and cement among many others. The idea was to achieve promote balanced regional development of industries throughout the country. Results Industrialists interested in setting up plants anywhere in the country would get coal, iron ore, aluminium etc. at the same price as they used to get in the mineral-rich states. A factory could be set up anywhere in the country and the transportation of minerals would be subsidised by the central government. As a result, there was growth of heavy and middle level-industry outside the mineral-rich regions of the country. The policy took away the competitive advantage of the eastern parts of the country, and benefited the western, southern and northern regions. According to Professor Stuart Corbridge, the policy discouraged the establishment of \\"resource-processing industries in eastern India, as opposed to the extractive industries, which seem to have imposed on the region a version of the 'resource curse' noted more frequently in sub-Saharan Africa.\\" In the western region, the policy especially benefited the coastal states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat. The finance minister T. T. Krishnamachari also equalised the freight, which greatly benefited the cement manufacturers in the South Indian states, as limestone and dolomite became cheaper to transport from North India. The North Indian areas that benefited from the policy included Delhi, its surrounding districts and Punjab. The sufferers of this policy were the states of West Bengal, Bihar (including present-day Jharkhand), Madhya Pradesh (including present-day Chhattisgarh) and Odisha. These states lost their competitive advantage of holding the minerals, as the factories could now be set up anywhere in India. This was not the case in the pre-independence era, when the major business houses like the Tatas and the Dalmias set up industries in Bihar, and most of the engineering industry was located in the state of West Bengal. Even after the removal of the policy in the early 1990s, these states could not catch up with the more industrialised states. In 1996, the Commerce & Industry minister of West Bengal complained that \\"the removal of the freight equalisation and licensing policies cannot compensate for the ill that has already been done\\".

They won the 2006 and 2008 World Hip Hop Dance Championships.Hip- hop community viewed All-Star as one of most jaw-dropping crew to ever exist. They were formed on 2005 by twelve individuals that were working in the Manila underground Hip-hop scene. They also joined the “Artists Revolution: 365 days to change” campaign which asks the Filipino voters to be more critical in choosing their political leaders in the coming 2010 elections.This Group set the high Standard of Dancing in the Philippines and gave the young dancers hope and inspirations. History The Philippine Allstars was started in 2005 by Twelve friends who wanted to collectively represent their country in the World Hip-Hop Championships held in the US. That year after taking first in the Maximum Groovity II, National Hip-Hop Open, they proudly placed sixth in the World. In 2006, Allstars put the Philippines on the map of Hip-hop dance in becoming the first Asian country to win back-to-back World Gold titles in the International Hip-hop Open d’Ítalia in Turin, Italy and in the World Hip- Hop Dance Championships in Los Angeles, California. The next year, the group took Bronze in the same competition and also won Team of the Year from V.Ent’s First Annual Dance Awards. Now in 2008, they came back strong again and took Gold with their 2008 iconic and legendary routine in the World Hip-Hop Dance Championships held in Las Vegas,they also won the Grand Champion in the Malta Guinness Street Dance Competition, Kenya, Africa, and in the same year won 1st Runner Up, UDO World Street Dancing Championships, Blackpoll, United Kingdom. The group hopes to elevate the status of dancers in the Philippines, because for too long have dancers been considered second-rate performers. Through their efforts and many talented others, they want to show that dancing is a great art form and should be more respected and rewarded than what is currently being offered by the entertainment industry. They share in a movement that strives to unite and inspire this generation through Faith, Hip- hop, and One Love. Lastly, a goal of the group is to teach and help under- privileged kids through dancing and inspiring them to strive for something more than what they have been told they can achieve. The Allstars advocates for Gawad Kalinga, has taught in US Embassy Outreach Programs, has spoken and performed for the QC Detention Cell, and participated in programs such as Pathways Workshop and Walk for Education. The Allstars are featured in many events, concerts, tours, TV guestings, commercials, music videos, films, and print ads. In February 2010, they opened their first dance school, the Allstars Dance School, located in San Juan city Philippines. The dance school is the realization of the Allstars' ultimate goal, and is their greatest achievement to date.

It was founded in 1920 and opened to visitors in 1921.  History  The building of the Museum was built in 1893–1902. The Italian Renaissance-style mansion is immense and takes up an entire city block. There are four floors in some parts of the building. It was designed by Polish architect Józef Gosławski. Adornments made from copper When the Red Army entered Baku in April 1920, Taghiyev's residence – like that of other wealthy oil barons – was immediately confiscated. Under a resolution of the USSR People's Commissariat, the residence was established as a museum in June 1920, only two months after the Bolsheviks took Baku. In May 1934, a special order was adopted to improve the teaching of history and geography in schools, or, more precisely, to inculcate the ‘advantages’ of socialist society in its members in order to nurture the rising generation in the ideology of the totalitarian regime. Marxist understanding of history was delivered through the establishments of historical research and other institutions. In addition, new kinds of historical and regional museums were created to inspire the teaching and promotion of history. The network of museums with a historical profile was enlarged in regard with the new system. Furthermore, mechanisms of Soviet advocacy became much stronger and mouthpieces during this period. Moreover, the knowledge of the history of our native land was developed through the museum’s achievements in research. In this fashion, phrases like “the first” and “for the first time” are often used when conversation turns to its ninety years of work. From 1925 to the 1960s, until the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences was made responsible for archaeological work, the foundations for the scientific investigation of ancient material and cultural monuments on the territory of Azerbaijan were laid under the direction of archaeologists Davud Sharifov, Yevgeniy Pakhomov, Ishak Jafar-Zadeh, Movsum Salamov, Saleh Gaziyev, Mammadali Huseynov. Excavations were carried out in Khojaly, Qabala, Ganja, Kharaba Gilan, Orangala, Mingechevir and other places. Museum’s collection consists of the materials discovered during these excavations and from ethnographic expeditions. Undoubtedly, museum’s collection allows enriching data for a great many books and theses.  Architecture  Museum's exposition On the second floor of Taghiyev's residence, side by side there are two major ballrooms. One is based on Oriental designs (Mauritanian) style and the other, on Occidental design. The Oriental Room has enormous plate glass windows, gilded arches, highly ornamental walls, ceilings and chandeliers. The lines in the Occidental Room are more perpendicular to each other – rectangular. According to photographs that are about 90 years old, one of the most elaborate rooms was Taghiyev's wife's boudoir (private sitting room). All of the movable furniture and paintings in this room have disappeared. Nothing remains today except the ornate mirrored mosaic ceiling. During the Soviet period, four layers of white paint were applied over the highly decorative floral designs on the walls. Still in the main halls of the residence, the original paint has withstood the passage of time incredibly well. The paint was made of finely ground egg shell as was the practice of artists of Byzantine icons. Nearly 100 years later, the original colors with their subtlety and sophistication have neither faded nor chipped.National History Museum: Taghiyev's Residence Azerbaijan International Magazine  Departments  The museum has more than 2000 exhibits and includes the following departments:Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences * Modern history department * Ethnography department * Department of ancient and medieval history of Azerbaijan * Scientific excursion department * Laboratory for restoration of museum exhibits * Fund of Numismatics: Including the collection of Yevgeni Pakhomov * Art design group * Library  Address  4 Hadji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev str., Baku, 1005 (near “Sahil” metro station).

Early life and academia Wall was born in Nottingham on 25 April 1925 to Thomas Wall, the director of education for Middlesex, and his wife Ruth Cresswell. He was educated at St Paul's School in London. He matriculated to Oxford University, studying medicine at Christ Church,Maltby (2002) p. 136 where he became interested in pain. He published his first two papers, in the prominent science journals Brain and Nature, at the age of 21. While at Oxford he had also helped found the British Medical Students' Journal, partially to help campaign for the introduction of the NHS. He graduated in 1948, by which time he had published three papers in prominent science journals. After graduating, he spent a short time treating holocaust survivors and refugees in mainland Europe, and then moved to the United States where he took up a position as an instructor at the Yale School of Medicine investigating the use of lobotomies as a method of controlling depression. Work in the United States He remained as an instructor until 1950, when he was offered a position as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. He moved again in 1953 to serve as an instructor at Harvard University, and again in 1957 to work as an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was promoted to full professor in 1960, and while at the Institute met Ronald Melzack, who was to become a long-time collaborator. At Melzack's urging they wrote a paper on the Gate control theory of pain and published it in Brain in 1962; according to Wall it was read by around three people. After expanding and rewriting the article they republished it as Pain Mechanisms: a new theory in Science in 1965 where it drew wider attention, with mostly negative comments. The paper was looked at in a new light after Wall collaborated with Bill Sweet to produce the Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator, developed along the lines of the theory. The effective working of the device validated Wall and Melzack's paper, and Wall gained acclaim as a leading neuroscientist. In 1965 he published TRIO - The Revolting Intellectuals' Organisation, a thriller novel. In 1973 he acted as the scientific study officer for the launch of the International Association for the Study of Pain, and subsequently acted as the first editor of its medical journal, Pain. Return to Britain In 1967 he returned to Britain due to threats from the CIA that refusal to disclose the political affiliations of his research group could jeopardise his funding, and took up a position as Professor of Anatomy at University College London,Maltby (2002) p. 137 under JZ Young. While there he was given the nickname of \\"Mr. Pat\\". Thanks to his reputation as a neuroscientist the laboratories at UCL attracted a large number of students and researchers, and his lectures were well received by both students and fellow lecturers. In 1972 he travelled to Jerusalem, and subsequently held a chair at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he taught for several months a year. In 1982 he published The Challenge of Pain with Melzack followed by a second collaboration a year later with The Textbook of Pain, which is currently in its fifth edition. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Physicians in 1984 and the Royal Society in 1989; by this point he had been repeatedly short-listed for a Nobel Prize. His left-wing views and the enemies that came with them were an apparent reason for his overdue election as a Fellow of the Royal Society, along with the society's reluctance to elect medical officials. He was awarded the Sherrington Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1988, and in 1992 he was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Anaesthesiologists. He retired the same year and continued experimental research at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School. In 1999 he was awarded the Royal Medal 'in recognition of his fundamental contributions to our knowledge of the somatosensory system and, in particular, pain mechanisms'. Death In 1996 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer after collapsing while on holiday in Cork. After treatment he went into remission, which held for five years; the cancer returned in 2001, and after a kidney operation on 2 August he discharged himself on 8 August so he could die at home. While suffering from cancer he had published the book Pain: The Science of Suffering. His body was left for medical dissection. Personal life Wall was married three times; first to Betty Tucker on 10 August 1950, an artist and poet whom he divorced in 1973, second to Vera Ronnen on 26 August 1976, an artist from Jerusalem whom he also divorced and finally to Mary McLellan on 6 May 1999. Wall was a chain-smoker, and enjoyed bird-watching outside of his work, although he preferred not to talk about his personal life. An exception to this was politics; Wall was fervently left-wing, and had set up various student and other organisations to support various causes.

It was proposed by Ross QuinlanQuinlan, J. Ross. \\"Induction of decision trees.\\" Machine learning 1.1 (1986): 81-106., to reduce a bias towards multi-valued attributes by taking the number and size of branches into account when choosing an attribute.http://www.ke.tu- darmstadt.de/lehre/archiv/ws0809/mldm/dt.pdf Information Gain is also known as Mutual Information.  Information gain calculation  Let Attr be the set of all attributes and Ex the set of all training examples, value(x,a) with x\\\\in Ex defines the value of a specific example x for attribute a\\\\in Attr, H specifies the entropy. The values(a) function denotes the set of all possible values of attribute a \\\\in Attr. The information gain for an attribute a\\\\in Attr is defined as follows: IG(Ex,a)=H(Ex) -\\\\sum_{v\\\\in values(a)} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in Exvalue(x,a)=v\\\\\\\\}}{Ex} \\\\cdot H(\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in Exvalue(x,a)=v\\\\\\\\})\\\\right) The information gain is equal to the total entropy for an attribute if for each of the attribute values a unique classification can be made for the result attribute. In this case the relative entropies subtracted from the total entropy are 0.  Intrinsic value calculation  The intrinsic value for a test is defined as follows: IV(Ex,a)= -\\\\sum_{v\\\\in values(a)} \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in Exvalue(x,a)=v\\\\\\\\}}{Ex} \\\\cdot \\\\log_2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in Exvalue(x,a)=v\\\\\\\\}}{Ex}\\\\right)  Information gain ratio calculation  The information gain ratio is just the ratio between the information gain and the intrinsic value: IGR(Ex,a)=IG / IV Advantages Information gain ratio biases the decision tree against considering attributes with a large number of distinct values. So it solves the drawback of information gain—namely, information gain applied to attributes that can take on a large number of distinct values might learn the training set too well. For example, suppose that we are building a decision tree for some data describing a business's customers. Information gain is often used to decide which of the attributes are the most relevant, so they can be tested near the root of the tree. One of the input attributes might be the customer's credit card number. This attribute has a high information gain, because it uniquely identifies each customer, but we do not want to include it in the decision tree: deciding how to treat a customer based on their credit card number is unlikely to generalize to customers we haven't seen before.

It was completed in March 1948, during the presidency of Harry S. Truman.  Controversy over construction plans  This photograph, taken at Franklin D. Roosevelt's fourth Inaugural Address, shows the White House's south face before the Truman Balcony was built. The awnings that Truman disliked are visible. Truman's plans to build a balcony off the Yellow Oval Room were controversial. Truman argued that the addition of a balcony would provide shade for the first floor portico, avoiding the need for awnings, and would balance the White House's south face by breaking up the long verticals created by the columns. Critics of the proposal, including members of the Commission of Fine Arts, argued that the Classic Greek style of the building would be undermined in order to create a leisure space for the First Family. The Commission's chairman, civil engineer and landscape architect Gilmore David Clarke, wrote to Truman to voice his opposition to the balcony. Truman responded, restating his belief that the residence would be enhanced by the project especially as it presented an opportunity to replace unattractive awnings, which he said collected dirt and constituted an eyesore, with wooden shades that could be rolled up under the new balcony. Contemporary political cartoonists satirized the President's balcony project, suggesting that it might even cost him the 1948 presidential election. Construction and subsequent history President George W. Bush entertaining Mexican President Vicente Fox on the Truman Balcony in September 2001 Plans for the balcony were approved by architect William Adams Delano. No request was made to Congress for the $16,050.74 () cost of constructing the balcony, as Truman had saved a sufficient sum from his household account. Once the balcony was completed, several of those who had opposed the project wrote to the President acknowledging that the balcony had in fact improved the south face of the Residence. In a September 2012 interview in Vanity Fair, President Barack Obama listed the balcony as his and his wife Michelle Obama's favorite spot in the White House.Vanity Fair interview, September 2012 References  Further reading  *Conflict and Crisis: The Presidency of Harry S.

Life and career Grandrieux was born in Saint- Étienne.Frédéric Zarch, Dictionnaire historique du cinéma de Saint-Étienne, PU, Saint-Étienne, 2008, p 81. He studied film at the INSAS (Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle) in Belgium. He exhibited his first video work at Galerie Albert Baronian, Bruxelles. In the 1980s, he worked in collaboration with the French Institut National de l'Audiovisuel (INA) and the television channel La Sept/Arte where he helped develop new cinematographic forms and formats that called into question some basic principles of film writing: for instance, the conventions behind documentary, information and film essays. In 1990, he created the film research lab “Live” which produced one-hour-long sequences by Thierry Kuntzel, Robert Kramer and Robert Frank... Since 2005, programs devoted to Grandrieux's features (Sombre, La Vie nouvelle, Un lac), installations, video, documentary work and shorts have been broadcast all over the world. 2012 / 2013 Philippe Grandrieux is Visiting Fiction Film Professor at Harvard University (USA) / In progress, a feature film Fever and a film/installation Meurtrière. Work Grandrieux's work covers several cinematographic fields - TV experimentation, video art, research movie, film essay, documentary and museum exhibition. His uncompromised vision of Art, leads him to push the boundaries of the cinematographic fields he is working on. As a consequence, he is always producing an inventive and radical cinema. His first two full-feature movies Sombre (which won an award at the Locarno Film Festival) and La Vie Nouvelle (A New Life) are examples of Grandrieux's creativity in photography, sound and narration. Following the work of Teinosuke Kinugasa, Jean Epstein and Pier Paolo Pasolini who were constantly looking for and inventing new narrative forms that would only fit films, Grandrieux's films, deriving from horror movies and experimental movies, give the viewer intense sensorial experiences. His goal is to make the viewer psychologically involved in his movies. Its films actually express a whole world of energies based on sensations and affects despite a linear narration and an iconography that relies on archetypes that refer to the archaic images of the fairy tale and the legend. Tim Palmer situates Grandrieux's work within an ongoing tendency of a cinema of the body, linked to other filmmakers such as Marina de Van, Diane Bertrand, Damien Odoul.Tim Palmer, Brutal Intimacy: Analyzing Contemporary French Cinema, Wesleyan University Press, Middleton CT, 2011. . For his soundtrack, he worked with Alan Vega (on Sombre) and with the musicians, poets and performers of the band Etant Donnés (on A New Life). The American actor Zachary Knighton played the main character with Anna Mouglalis. The writer Eric Vuillard also participated in the writing of the script of A New Life. A part of the email exchange between Grandrieux and Vuillard about the script has been published in the French film review Trafic. Published also: \\"La Vie nouvelle/nouvelle Vision, à propos d'un film de Philippe Grandrieux,\\" under the direction of Nicole Brenez, Paris, Ed. Léo Scheer, février 2005. With texts from - Jonathan Rosenbaum, Raymond Bellour, Nicole Brenez, Sothean Nhieim, Fabien Gaffez, Serge Kaganski, Augustin Gimel, Lionel Soukaz, Adrian Martin, Vincent Amiel, Peter Tscherkassky... This book including a DVD of La Vie nouvelle. The psychanalist Jean-Claude Polack declares about Grandrieux's movies that they “carefully try to understand the exact inner-working of one's psychic, and more especially the part that deals with desire and transformation. How does desire work? What are the elements that this energy- matter is using to expand its empire? What are the social repressions that desire has to face? Unlike Pasolini who is really interested in the way that society is theatrically transforming the ceremony of predating into a show, there is here an experimental cinema; it is true; that is trying to register, thanks to the camera, what humans eyes would never be able to see in order to deconstruct and analyze reality. Grandrieux's films are analytical films, like a microscope, that give the viewer the possibility to see more accurately what is movement, emotion, sensation, colour, darkness and the emergence of the image (either material or thought). What is the process that enables something to become an image in the dark? Why can this process only be seen as a threat?”La Vie nouvelle/nouvelle Vision, Editions Leo Scheer, Paris, 2005 In 2006, Grandrieux appeared in Sarah Bertrand's documentary There is no direction. In 2007, the singer Marilyn Manson, who admits having seen La Vie nouvelle several times, asked Grandrieux to direct his video-clip for his song Putting Holes in Happiness that belongs to the album Eat Me, Drink Me. In 2008, Japan paid homage to Grandrieux's work, thanks to the French Ambassy, in the famous Uplink movie theater of Tokyo, under the title \\"Extreme Love - around Philippe Grandrieux\\". The same year, the Tate Modern of London, along the retrospective \\"PARADISE NOW ! Essential French Avant-Garde cinema 1890-2008,\\" played Putting Holes in Happiness, A New Life, The Late Season and an excerpt of Un Lac (A Lake), his latest movie, which was not completed back then. Un Lac, was ready for the 65th Venice Film Festival (2008) where he won a Special Mention in the Orrizzonti Section which rewards movies that initiate new cinematographic trends.http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/program/en/14366.html [ In 2011, his documentary It May Be That Beauty Has Strengthened Our Resolve - Masao Adachi (PG co-author of the project with Nicole Brenez) has been programmed in more than 35 festivals... and was awarded at: CPH:DOX Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival / Denmark. The NEW:VISION AWARD that aims at promoting the experimental documentary in the field between documentary and art was given to Philippe Grandrieux's documentary about the Japanese filmmaker Masao Adachi.

This concept includes electrothermal vortex, electrophoresis, dielectrophoresis, and electroosmosis induced by combination of optical and electrical energy or by optical-electrical energy transfer. In 1995, an electrothermal vortices induced by a strong IR (infrared) laser projected into an electric field have been utilized to concentrate microparticles and molecules. In 2000, UV(ultraviolet) pattern projected onto ITO (indium tin oxide) electrode has been applied for patterning colloidal particles. Illumination of the ITO electrode by UV light results in a small increase in the current from the generation of electron-hole pairs at the ITO/water interface. In 2005, optoelectronic tweezers (OET), wherein a photoconductive material was utilized to induce electric field using the optical decrement of electrical resistance on a partially illuminated area, has been reported.

Nosokinetics brings together the Greek words for noso: disease and kinetics: movement. Black box models are currently used to plan changes in health and social care systems. These input-output models overlook the process of inpatient care, as a result suboptimal decisions are made. Nosokinetics, (analogous to Pharmacokinetics), seeks to develop dynamic methods which measure and model the process of inpatient care. The aim is to develop a scientific base to underpin the planning of sustainable health and social care systems.  Establishment  Nosokinetics is a new science that was established in the UK in the early 1990s by Prof Peter H Millard after publishing his PhD thesis. In 2004 Nosokinetics group newsletter was established.Peter Millard Resume & Photo  Origin  Prof Peter H Millard writes about Nosokinetics : \\"If the random forces of wind and tide can make such a beautiful statue (referring to an iceberg), how much better could mankind do if a new science was developed which explains the complex processes of health and social care. Until new methods of planning health and social care services to meet the needs of an ageing population are introduced, service delivery will stumble on from crisis to crisis. The world population is ageing and sustainable systems of health care need to be developed.\\" He has established the nosokinetics group of interested researchers. The group collaborates to organize conferences and disseminates news of nosokinetics and other researchers' research and practical use of modelling to enhance decision making in health and social care systems.  Network  The Nosokinetics Group has succeeded in attracting a lot of researchers. Nosokinetics interested people are present in many countries including Australia, UK & Egypt. They are from different disciplines ranging from health care providers to management scientists. The news related to nosokinetics is shared to the network through the bimonthly newsletter Nosokinetics NewsNosokinetics newsletter archive which helps to communicate papers, conferences and events of interest to the Nosokinetics network.

Today, the company is known primarily for its power amplifiers, but has also manufactured microphones, a line of commercial audio products as well as digital audio networking products. History International Radio and Electronics Corporation (IREC) was established in 1947 by Clarence C. Moore, an Elkhart, Indiana minister. The company started out building rugged, open reel tape recorders for use by missionaries in far off parts of the world.Crown Audio. History A converted chicken coop served as the first manufacturing facility. In the 1960s, the company's name was changed to \\"Crown International\\", as suggested by Moore's wife and co-founder, Ruby, as she felt the name \\"International Radio and Electronics Corporation\\" was too long, and because the emblem on many of their tape recorders was a crown. In 1975, the company's name was changed to Crown International, Inc., as voted by the stockholders. A fire destroyed 60% of the Crown facility on Thanksgiving Day 1971 and rendered much of the remaining building severely damaged. US$1 million of uninsured assets were lost. The plant was rebuilt, and D-60 amplifier production was brought back on line within six weeks. In March, 2000, Crown International was acquired by Harman International as their primary supplier of audio power amplifiers. The radio frequency broadcast division was subsequently repurchased by descendants of Clarence Moore who restructured the division in order to continue the manufacture of broadcast transmitters and RF amplifiers using Moore's original firm name: \\"International Radio & Electronics Corporation\\".Audio Annals. Crown International Following Crown International's acquisition by Harman International, additional offices were set up in Northridge, Los Angeles, California, where AKG Acoustics, another Harman company, maintains its North American headquarters. In June, 2018, Harman International shut down the Crown International headquarters in Elkhart, IN and moved manufacturing to Mexico in an effort to consolidate resources. Product timeline In 1947, Clarence and Ruby Moore began by modifying existing makes and models of tape recorders to make them more rugged.Crown Audio timeline In 1949, Moore obtained a groundbreaking patent, the first tape recorder with a built-in power amplifier for public address duties, which was introduced in 1950. In 1953, Crown added a line of compact loudspeakers as accessories to the reel to reel tape recorders. The Crown DC300, introduced in 1967, helped define the era of modern power amplifiers In 1959, Crown began making standalone tube power amplifiers. By 1963, solid state electronics development allowed Crown to produce a more robust tape recorder, and in 1964, their first solid state power amplifier: the low- profile SA 20-20. In 1967, the DC300 was introduced as the first AB+B circuitry amplifier with 150 watts per channel at eight ohms. The DC300 proved very popular with sound reinforcement system owners and moved Crown into a leadership position in terms of power amplifier sales worldwide. As well, the DC300 was seen as a breakthrough product by commercial sound system contractors seeking to power their constant voltage speaker systems without the frequency response limitations and power losses associated with output power transformers which had previously been required.Crown Audio. Guide to Constant-Voltage Systems In November 2007, after 40 years of service, the Crown DC300 was inducted into the TEC Awards TECnology Hall of Fame in New York on the opening day of the Audio Engineering Society's 123rd convention. George Peterson, executive editor of Mix magazine, said of the DC300 that it \\"was a classic that really ushered in and defined the era of the modern power amplifier.\\"Crown Audio. Press release. Crown DC 300 Enters TECnology Hall Of Fame In 1971, the grounded bridge amplifier design was invented by Crown, allowing greater output power without increasing amplifier sizeCrown Audio. Grounded Bridge and also gave lower distortion, less thermal stress and greater reliability. The first grounded bridge product released by Crown was the M600 amplifier (1974) primarily employed for commercial sound installations including constant voltage loudspeaker systems.Crown Audio. Legacy products. M600 Instruction Manual Crown received a patent for the invention in 1974. After proving itself in the field, the topology was used to design the Microtech MT-1000 in 1984. Further development of the grounded bridge yielded the Macrotech line which set a new standard for touring sound reinforcement in 1992 with the MA-5000VZ. In 1976, Crown patented the synergistic equalizer, releasing the stereo EQ-2 graphic equalizer which used a combination of shelving filters and eleven active frequency adjustment faders per channel. The faders were connected to constant bandwidth, variable Q, 1/2-octave filters placed on octave centers but with adjustable frequency knobs to shift the center frequency for greater flexibility.Crown Audio. Legacy products. EQ-2 A limited number of units were sold to audiophiles and audio researchers. By 1977, all of Crown's tape recorder products had been phased out. In 1979, Crown introduced the PSA-2 & SA-2 power amplifiers with analog computer control of transistor performance to maximize output characteristics. The FM-1 stereo radio tuner was praised at the Consumer Electronics Show. In 1981, the FM-2 with digital tuning was released. A line of Pressure zone microphones (PZM) was introduced by Crown in 1980, culminating in the PZM-30 series in 1990.Crown Audio. PZM-30R, PZM-30F: Pressure Zone Microphone Other microphones introduced by Crown included the PCC-160 directional boundary microphone in 1986, the tiny GLM series and the patented Differoid CM310 in 1987. The SASS stereo microphone was patented in 1989. Garth Brooks was the first performer to wear the Crown CM311A headset microphone in 1993. The CM700 studio condenser was introduced in 1995.

In 1997, it was successfully nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.Complete list of biosphere reserves (pdf), Publication Date: 03-11-2008, retrieved from UNESCO website, 29 December 2008 Tonlé Sap The lake is linked to the Mekong River by the Tonlé Sap River. From November until June the lake flows into the Mekong. However, each year during the rainy season (mid June-late October) the Mekong River is inundated with rain waters. Its lower delta becomes flooded and cannot flow into the sea quickly enough to eliminate all the excess water. This causes the Mekong River to rise enough to reverse the flow of the Tonlé Sap River causing it to flow back into the lake. The lake expands from 2500 km2 to more than 16,000 km2 creating an enormous wetland area. This wetland area supports a tremendous amount of biodiversity including plants, reptiles, mammals, birds and other animals. Many of these are known to be rare or endangered. These wetlands are also an important breeding area for fish from the lake and Mekong River.http://www.mekonginfo.org Both Siamese crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis) and saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) once occurred side-by-side in the lake, and there is thought to be inter-species breeding amongst the crocodiles found in the floating farms on the western part of the Lake in and around Prek Toal. Biosphere Reserve In 2001, the Tonlé Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) of Cambodia was established by Royal Decree of the government of Cambodia to fulfil 3 key functions. These are: *a) a conservation function to contribute to the conservation of biological diversity, landscapes, and ecosystem, including genetic resources, plant, fishery and animal species, and to the restoration of the essential character of the environment and habitat of biodiversity; *b) a development function to foster sustainable development of ecology, environment, economy, society, and culture; *c) a logistic function to provide support for demonstration projects, environmental education and training, research and monitoring of environment related to the local, national and global issues of conservation and sustainable development. Water dwelling community on the Tonlé Sap The Biosphere has been divided into 3 core areas for protection. These are; Prek Toal in Battambang Province, Boeng Tonle Chhmar in Kampong Thom Province and Stoeng Sen also in Kompong Thom. Boeng Tonle Chhmar has been selected as a Ramsar Convention site, which designates wetlands of international importance. The core areas function similar to national park areas and cover 42,300 ha. including the Great Lake.http://www.tsbr-ed.org Some people still live in these areas and are allowed to fish in them according to fishery law in Cambodia. Illegal fishing and poaching are major problems which threaten the fish population. Cutting of the flooded forest to make room for farming is also a serious issue. Many of the people who live around the lake are extremely poor and depend on it for their livelihoods. It is a challenge for sustainable development and conservation to coexist.\\"Plan helps birds, villagers thrive in Cambodia\\", Christian Science Monitor, March 16, 2006 It is also of vital importance. During the recent past the number of large fish caught has declined and the poor people who live around the lake are having an even more difficult time providing for themselves and their families. This creates a vicious cycle of increasing poverty, and in turn increasing threats and danger to the lake. This is also why 2 of the functions of the Royal Decree support education and support for the people living around the lake. TSBR Secretariat A TSBR Secretariat was established to further the goal of protecting the biosphere and implement and support the functions of the Royal Decree. Since 2003 the Cambodian Government has supported the TSBR Secretariat with funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).ADB Provides $20M to Assist Cambodia's Tonle Sap Region, Press Release - Asian Development Bank, Dec 6 2007 The major goal of the Secretariat is to develop a coordinated management strategy. Coordinated management is important because different stakeholders have various objectives. For example, farmers build channels to irrigate their fields. However, this leaves less water in fishing areas. Or farmers use pesticides on their crops which can get into the water; then people who live on the lake use this same water for bathing and other household uses and can become sick. This creates conflicts between user groups. The TSBR Secretariat attempts to lower these conflicts and find a solution that provides sustainability for all user groups and protects the biosphere reserve at the same time. The Secretariat is also responsible for developing and maintaining a web based knowledge repository for information about the lake and the biosphere. This website contains over 10,000 textual documents, over 150 tables and over 200 maps all relevant to the biosphere.

Political career José María Rojas Garrido had a wide and extensive political career, serving at the Local, Departmental and National levels, and in the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the National Government. Early political career Rojas Garrido received his Doctorate in Jurisprudence in 1847 from the Colegio de San Bartolomé. In 1851 he was appointed Governor of the Province on Neiva by his close friend President José Hilario López. In 1856 he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives for the State of Antioquia, and shortly after was appointed Chargé d'affaires in Venezuela by President José María Obando. Rojas Garrido had a very close relationship with General Mosquera, they were close friends, and Rojas Garrido was appointed four times to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs four times, during the various administrations of Mosquera. In 1861 he served as Governor of the Province of Bogotá, and in 1862 served as Deputy in the Antioquia State Assembly, and from 1862 to 1863 he regained the office of Secretary of Foreign Affairs, having this time also control of the Ministry of War and Navy. In 1864 he returned to Venezuela this time as Minister Plenipotentiary and Special Commissioner. When he returned return to New Granada he was elected by Congress to the Supreme Court of Colombia. Presidency 1865 In 1866, former President General Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera was elected once again to the Presidency. On February 17, 1866, Congress held elections for the Presidential Delegates for that calendar year and elected José María Rojas Garrido First Presidential Designate, and Santos Acosta, and Marcelino Gutierrez as the Second and Third Presidential Designates. The Presidential Delegates were those who because of the abolishment of the office of Vice President were in line to succeed the President in his absence. The title did not carry an official office, but because General Mosquera was in Europe at the time, Rojas Garrido assumed the office of the Presidency on April 1, 1866, acting in the absence of the President Elect as the 3rd President of the United States of Colombia, until May 22, 1866 when General Mosquera returned to the country and was sworn in. Post presidency After ceding power, José María Rojas Garrido remained an active advisor to the President being appointed one last time as Secretary of Foreign Affairs. He was later re-elected as Magistrate to the Supreme Court in 1870, and in 1872, Rojas Garrido ran an unsuccessful bid for the Presidency, losing the election to Manuel Murillo Toro. José María Rojas Garrido remained in the Supreme Court until his death on July 18, 1883 in Bogotá because of a pulmonary congestion.

Located in the middle of the Melbourne Yard precinct in the suburb West Melbourne near North Melbourne station, the site is now occupied by the Melbourne Steel Terminal. The depot was described by railway employees as \\"the hub of the universe\\", \\"the VR's nearest approach to Dante's Inferno\\", or \\"the Black Hole of Calcutta\\" depending on their disposition. History Steam locomotives E 462, R 483, and M 224 around one of the turntables circa 1905. The depot was opened sometime in the 1880s by the Victorian Railways, replacing its first locomotive depot located in the Spencer Street station yard. It was located beside the Railway Canal, a section of Moonee Ponds Creek that enabled the direct unloading of coal transported by sea from New South Wales. The rectangular building was built of brick and iron with three turntables located inside. There were six track entrances, two at the front from the main goods yard, three from the stabling roads, and one at the rear. A three road coal stage was located to the south of the depot, along with a number of open air stabling roads.Victorian Railways Signal Diagram: Melbourne Goods Yard 6'33 (1933) As late as the 1950s the depot housed 160 locomotives, but with dieselisation from 1952 the end was near. The new South Dynon Locomotive Depot was opened across the creek for the new locomotives as part of the North East standard gauge project, with the last steam-hauled train leaving Melbourne on 18 May 1964 - R703 on the 18:05 to Geelong.

Yiftahel () is an archaeological site located in the Lower Galilee in northern Israel. Various salvage excavations took place here between 1992 and 2008. The best known periods of occupation are the Early Bronze Age I and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B. In the Early Bronze Age village ca. 20 oval and rounded structures were uncovered. This is regarded as the most typical village of its period in the southern Levant. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic B village is characterized by rectangular architecture and plastered floors of burnt limestone. One of the most important processes underway during the Neolithic period was the shift from a hunter-gatherer economy to early agriculture. The finds from Yiftahel shed light on the domestication of both animals and plants. Yiftahel produced over 1,000,000 lentils, an enormous quantity, clearly indicating controlled cultivation. The most important agricultural finding here, however, is the earliest appearance of domesticated horsebean seeds.

It was caused by heavy rainfall coinciding with the regular Alpine meltwater. By late May, the annual spring meltwater from the Alps meant many Bavarian rivers were already at a high water level. On May 22 the rainstorm \\"Quartus\\" hit the northern Alps, bringing an additional 180 litres/m², causing the Ammersee and the Amper and Isar rivers to expand and flood large areas. These flooded areas expanded quickly covering parts of the Oberallgäu on the river Iller. The flood then continued downstream to some of the more inhabited areas in Bavaria. The water level of the Isar, which flows through Munich, was lowered by the Sylvensteinspeicher reservoir near Bad Tölz. However causeways on the Iller failed, flooding Sonthofen, parts of Augsburg and Neustadt. In Hindelang- Hinterstein the flood reached a peak not recorded in the previous 250 years. A subsequent Alpine highwater on 23-24 August 2005 again did damage to these areas. In the Vorarlberg area the Rhine flood affected Lake Constance damaging Hard and Bregenz. In Tirol the village Pflach in Lechtal was flooded.

The area is of some historic significance, as it initially was ruled by a cadet branch of the House of Griffin and did not belong to the Duchy of Pomerania (Slavinia) under Duke Wartislaw I and his descendants, when they became vassals of the Holy Roman Emperor in 1181. Ruled by the Samboride dukes of Pomerelia from 1227 and conquered by Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg- Stendal in 1309, it was not incorporated into the Duchy of Pomerania until 1317. Geography The small region comprises the easternmost lands of historic Farther Pomerania, where the Wieprza and Słupia Rivers empty into the Baltic Sea. The area laid beyond the territory of the Prince-Bishops of Cammin, with the border running along the Unieść creek, Lake Jamno and the Góra Chełmska hill (about east of Koszalin) in the west. In the east, the Łeba River marked the historic border with Lauenburg and Bütow Land in Pomerelia (Gdańsk Pomerania). Since World War II and the implementation of the Oder- Neisse line in 1945, the Farther Pomeranian region belongs to Poland. Part of the larger Szczecin Voivodeship from 1945, the powiats (counties) of Sławno and Słupsk in 1950 were incorporated into Koszalin Voivodeship and from 1975 belonged to the smaller Słupsk Voivodeship. Since the 1998 administrative reform the Lands of Schlawe-Stolp are divided between West Pomeranian Voivodeship (Sławno) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (Słupsk). History In the early 12th century, the Pomeranian lands had been again subdued by the Polish prince Bolesław III Wrymouth. His vassal, the Griffin duke Wartislaw, then ruled over the lands around the mouth of the Oder River and Szczecin, while the eastern Lands of Schlawe and Stolp since the 1120s were ruled by his brother Duke Ratibor I. When Wartislaw was murdered about 1135, Ratibor also assumed the rule over his late brother's duchy as regent for his minor nephews, however upon his own death in 1156, the domains were again separated: Schlawe-Stolp was inherited by Ratibor's sons Swietopelk and Bogislaw, the so- called \\"Ratiborides\\" cadet branch of the Griffin House of Pomerania, while their cousin Duke Bogislaw I of Pomerania pledged allegiance to Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1181. Nevertheless, all Pomerania was under Danish occupation from the 1180s to 1227. Samborides The last member of the Ratiborides branch of the Griffins, Ratibor II, died in 1223. This led to an inheritance dispute between the Pomeranian Griffins and the Samborides dukes of neighbouring Pomerelia, vassals of the Piast Kingdom of Poland. As Ratibor II had died during the Danish period, Denmark administered the area until she had to withdraw after the lost Battle of Bornhöved in 1227. Duke Barnim I of Pomerania immediately took control of the lands after the Danish withdrawal, but had to yield rights to the Pomerelian duke Swietopelk II, who claimed a closer relationship to the extinct Ratiborides, and took over Schlawe-Stolp in 1235/36. In the 1250s, the Pomeranian dukes mounted an unsuccessful campaign to regain the area. After the death of Duke Swietopelk II in 1266, Duke Barnim I of Pomerania again assumed the rule over the Land of Schlawe, which he ceded to Prince Vitslav II of Rügen, the founder of Rügenwalde, in 1269. However, the Griffins had to cope with the rising Margraves of Brandenburg, who had secured their enfeoffment with Pomerania by Emperor Frederick II in 1231. On 1 April 1269 the Ascanian margraves John II, Otto IV and Conrad of Brandenburg- Stendal signed the Treaty of Arnswalde with late Swantopelks's son Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia and acquired the seignory over Schlawe-Stolp.

In 1283, Mestwin II of Pomerelia finally took over. With his death in 1294 the Samborides dynasty became extinct. Competition arose anew, as in his testimony late Duke Mestwin II had ignored his earlier contracts and by the secret Treaty of Kępno had inserted the former Polish High Duke, Przemysł II of Greater Poland, as his successor.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.87, Inheritance conflict Kingdom of Poland in 1294-96, Pomerelian and Greater Polish lands of Przemysł II in yellow Przemysł II was crowned King of Poland in 1295 and assumed the rule over the Pomerelian lands with Schlawe-Stolp.

The Pomeranian dukes, acting under the sovereignty of Brandenburg, were forced out and had to withdraw at about 1301, after Wenceslaus II had become king of both Poland and Bohemia.

The attack failed, however, since the local warlord, Wŀadisŀaw Ŀokietek, had recruited soldiers of the Teutonic Knights in order to help defending it. After the Teutonic takeover of Danzig in November 1308, whereby the Knights seized the city and allegedly slaughtered many of the inhabitants, the Ascanian Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg-Stendal by the Treaty of Soldin sold his claims to Pomerelia east of the Łeba River to the Teutonic Order for the sum of 10,000 silver marks, but retained Schlawe-Stolp. Grand Master Siegfried von Feuchtwangen and Master Heinrich von Dirschau und Schwetz integrated remaining Gdańsk Pomerania into their Monastic State. Emperor Henry VII ratified the Soldin Treaty in 1313, and, though he could not assert any feudal claims to the territory of the extinct Samboride dukes, the now Brandenburgian Lands of Schlawe and Stolp finally were incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire. Duchy of Pomerania Schlawe and Stolp as part of the Duchy of Pomerania-Wolgast, about 1400 The districts of Schlawe (now Sławno), Rügenwalde (Darłowo) and Stolp (Słupsk), remained with the Margraviate of Brandenburg and were ruled by the margraves' vassals, the Swienca family, who had administered the area already before under other dynasties. Upon the 1317 Treaty of Templin, the Griffin duke Wartislaw IV of Pomerania-Wolgast could take over these areas as a fief from Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg. In 1347, the area became fully attached to the Duchy of Pomerania-Wolgast.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.105, The lands of Stolp were pawned to the Teutonic Order from 1329 to 1341, the Bütow area was bought by the Order in 1329 and thus remained outside Pomerania-Wolgast.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.106, The lands of Schlawe and Stolp became part of the Duchy of Pomerania-Stolp after the partition of the Pomeranian duchy in 1368. While the Pomerelian lands were incorporated into the Polish province of Royal Prussia in 1466, the eastern border of the lands of Schlawe and Stolp to Pomerelia shifted several times, before they, together with adjacent Lauenburg and Bütow Land, were integrated into the Prussian Province of Pomerania in 1653.Roderich Schmidt: Die Lande Lauenburg und Bütow in ihrer wechselnden Zugehörigkeit zum Deutschen Orden, zu Pommern und Polen und zu Brandenburg-Preußen, in: Reiche und Territorien in Ostmitteleuropa - Historische Beziehungen und politische Herrschaftslegitimation (D.

History Origin In spite of local claims of much earlier construction (dating to founding of Tappan in 1686), the '76 House appears only to predate the American Revolution by several decades. The earliest confirmed dates concerning any structure on or near the site involve one Antie Myers, a widow, who was licensed in 1705 to sell drink, \\"as per her recognizance,\\" in her house in the immediate neighborhood of today's '76 House. After her death around 1721 her home was purchased by Yoast Mabie, a brother of Casparus. The house was demolished in 1835. In 1753, Casparus Mabie bought a piece of land from Cornelis Myers, Antie's son. The following year he built a house on this lot on what was to become Main Street in Tappan. He included space for a tavern, probably no more than a few tables and benches in a corner of the front room. Two years later, in 1756, court records indicate that the \\"Supervisors for the County of Orange [met] at the House of Casparus Maybe, in Orange Town October the 5th Anno Domine 1756.\\" These documents describe meetings of the Board of Supervisors over the years and provide details of the food and ale they consumed and the business they conducted.Howard I.

Maps of this neighborhood and its neighbors appear in Tappan: 300 Years, 1686-1986 (Tappantown Historical Society, 1988), p. 26. Major John André was confined An old hearsay that the '76 House was known as \\"Mabie's Inn\\", home to Yoast Mabie, and the site of the signing of the Orangetown Resolutions in 1774, has been disproved by historians. Mabie's actual house, around the corner, was demolished.Durie, 1981-1982. David Cole, History of Rockland County, NY (New York: 1884), p. 27\\\\. The text of the Orangetown Resolutions was printed in the New York Journal, or General Advertiser, ed. John Holt, on July 14, 1774, Issue 1645, page 3. The paper clearly states that the Resolutions were signed in the \\"house of Yoast Mabie,\\" which as noted above was around the corner from Casparus's house, today the '76 House restaurant. Revolutionary headquarters The '76 House was often used during the American Revolutionary War as a meeting place for local Patriots. For a few days in 1780, it served as the prison of the Revolution's most notorious spy, Major John André. When the Continental Army encamped in Tappan, the house was the headquarters for General Nathanael Greene. By this time, owner Casparus Mabie had built another house for his family on \\"very good upland\\" behind the '76 House on what is today called André Hill, where the spy was hanged after his trial in the Tappan Reformed Church. General George Washington did not attend the trial, nor did he \\"question\\" André, as some sources claim. In fact, Washington did not respond to the spy's request that he be shot as befitted a gentleman and an officer rather than hanged like a common criminal.Cole, 1884, chs. IV-XIII. Fabend, 2006, p. 20. As the war continued, Fort Lee in New Jersey and New York City were British strongholds, West Point was a Revolutionary stronghold, and Tappan became a front line in the conflict. George Washington made the nearby De Wint House his headquarters. Once again, despite local claims, there is no documentary evidence that he ever drank or ate at the '76 House. He brought his own chef to Tappan with him, Samuel Fraunces of Fraunces Tavern. Nor is there evidence that he met the British Commander Carleton at the '76 House at the end of the war. The dinner they had together in Tappan was at the De Wint House, prepared by Fraunces, and another aboard the H.M.S. Perseverance.Isabelle K. Savell, Wine and Bitters, An account of the meetings in 1783 at Tappan, N.Y. and aboard H.M.S. Perseverance, between George Washington and Sir Guy Carleton, commanding generals of the American and British forces at the close of the Revolution (Historical Society of Rockland County), 1975. Restoration In 1987, Rob Norden purchased the restaurant, which is now owned and operated by his son, also Rob. The Nordens undertook a significant research and restoration project to restore the older appearance and deal with structural problems. The foundation was strengthened with concrete. The floor and ceiling joists, weakened by sagging of the foundation, were replaced by others from a barn in Ontario as old as the tavern, and the floorboards were replaced with similar boards from a schoolhouse in Pennsylvania. The '76 House is a contributing property to the Tappan Historic District.

In 1881, he sang at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome in the theatre's first performances of Rossini's The Barber of Seville (Figaro), Bellini's La sonnambula (Count Rodolfo), and Verdi's La forza del destino (Fra Melitone). He returned there in 1894 for the Costanzi's first performance of Manon Lescaut (Geronte). Polonini appeared frequently at the Teatro Regio di Torino. In addition to his performances there in the world premieres of Manon Lescaut (1893) and La bohème (1896), he sang in the world premieres of two now forgotten Italian operas - Antonio Cagnoni's Francesca da Rimini (1878) and Gaetano Luporini's I dispetti amorosi (1894).

In Italy, Eutimio Polonini sang in the premieres of Saverio Mercadante's Il bravo, ossia La veneziana, (La Scala, 1839) and Otto Nicolai's Il templario (Teatro Regio di Torino, 1840). He made his London debut in 1847 and for 21 years sang with the Royal Italian Opera. In April 1855 he appeared there in Beethoven's Fidelio in the presence of Queen Victoria and Napoleon III, as part of the French emperor's state visit to Britain.

The company develops, rents and sells formwork and scaffolding products for the main construction trade and civil engineering projects. Aside from that, Harsco Infrastructure offers an extensive range of services for the planning and development of projects, on top of logistics. The majority of the small- and medium-size enterprises which are its customers, come from the construction trade as well as the building industry, whereas the revenues in the scaffolding segment are mainly composed of sales to non-industrial clients.  History  Emil Mauritz Hünnebeck founded the Rautennetz GmbH in 1929 in Essen, which dedicated itself to the construction and further development of the \\"lozenge net\\" technique. Then in 1937, the company relocated its main offices to Düsseldorf. In the years that followed, large construction projects such as shipyards and airplane hangars were built inside and outside of the country utilizing patented methods. In 1956, the Deutsche Stahllamelle Hünnebeck GmbH in Lintorf erected a plant with 16 halls, several administration buildings as well as a stockyard for the production of steel- tube props and telescopic ceiling beams on its 155,000 sqm large premises with private railway siding. The company was later renamed to Hünnebeck GmbH in 1961. The sales outside of Germany were made through contracts with exclusive importers. At the beginning of the 1960s, the first foreign subsidiaries were founded, such as the Skandinavisk Hünnebeck A/S in Denmark, followed by subsidiaries in Austria in 1968 and Sweden in 1970. Hünnebeck was taken over by the Thyssen AG in 1988 and thus merged with the since 1953 affiliated service organization RöRo. As a result of Germany’s reunification, the company expanded into the new federal states with 12 further branch offices. In 1995, the first steps were made in the U.S. and a 50% share of Safway Services Inc., in Milwaukee was acquired. Nowadays the company is represented in more than 30 countries. In Europe, the near and Middle-East, Africa and South America, Hünnebeck sells its products and services through 15 established subsidiaries, whereas the other countries are supplied through licensed distributors and dealers. On 31 August 2003, the American investment company Sun Capital acquired most shares of Hünnebeck GmbH and its 9 European subsidiaries at that time. As of November 2005, Hünnebeck officially became part of the Access Services division of the American Harsco Corporation, situated in Harrisburg/Pennsylvania. At the end of 2009, the three tradition-rich companies, Hünnebeck, SGB and Patent, joined forces to operate under the common name Harsco Infrastructure. This gave birth to one of the biggest global suppliers of formwork, scaffolding and powered access equipment as well as industrial services with sales of approximately 1.11 billion US-dollars (2011).  Prominent Projects  • Burj Khalifa, United Arab Emirates – Hünnebeck formwork technology was used in the construction of the highest and safest skyscraper of the 21st century. • Golden Terrace, Poland – Hünnebeck equipment employed in the building of one Europe’s biggest shopping centers. • Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Germany – For the construction of the new main rail station, Hünnebeck supplied the formwork solution for both office towers. • Hipogeno de Andacollo, Chile – Hünnebeck was part of one of the largest expansion projects for mines in South America. • Power Plant Boxberg, Germany – Great amounts of formwork and scaffolding equipment as well as an intensive technical supervision were Hünnebeck’s main contributions to this large-scale project.

Following the government's decision to remove the SD Primary Channel limitations, the channel returned as an HD simulcast on channel 20 on 6 December 2016. On 6 December 2016, when ABC HD was revived, ABC News's HD feed was removed and reduced to standard definition (SDTV). History Origins Starting on 1 January 2002, the ABC began a prime-time simulcast of ABC's Sydney station ABN, except that it had no watermark and was upconverted from standard definition to 1080i high definition. On 1 January 2005 it was changed to 576p to accommodate the launch of new channel ABC2 (now ABC Comedy) and gradually expanded its operating hours. 2008 rebrand On 1 January 2008, the ABC's high definition simulcast was rebranded as ABC HD, relaunching as a high definition multichannel with its own logo and branding. The channel was also enhanced to 720p to mark the start of native high-definition content. Throughout its multichannel era, ABC HD continued providing a high definition simulcast of ABN Sydney. As a result, viewers outside of New South Wales would see Sydney-based news bulletins and other localised content. The purpose of this as of 2008, was to provide high-definition versions of ABC1 shows when available (Prior to this, the broadcaster relied on regulation exemptions that allowed it to meet a high-definition quota using content upscaled from standard definition). There were exceptions to the ABC1 simulcast: During the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, ABC HD became a dedicated sports broadcaster, simulcasting the dedicated coverage on ABC2 for most of the day. The 2009 VFL Grand Final was shown exclusively live on ABC HD. For a time up until ABC HD branding ceased, ABC HD screened a \\"7:30 Select\\" national highlights package instead of the Sydney version of Stateline. Closure On 10 June 2010, ABC HD's unique branding was replaced with that of ABC1, reverting the channel to an ABN Sydney simulcast. ABC HD ceased being a simulcast of ABC1 from 6 July 2010 in Tasmania and the ACT; 7 July 2010 in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory; and on 8 July 2010 in Victoria and New South Wales, all replaced by a looped pre- launch promotion for ABC News 24 (now ABC News) on channel 24. This made ABC the second broadcaster in Australia to permanently discontinue the high definition simulcast of its main channel, following the removal of Ten HD to create Ten's former sports and now entertainment channel One in 2009. 2016 revival Following the government's decision to remove SD primary channel limitations, ABC Director of Television Richard Finlayson announced in November 2015 that the ABC would recommence simulcasting in high definition in June 2016. However, the launch date was later pushed back to an indefinite time in late 2016 due to technical reasons, with the launch date finally announced as 6 December 2016. However, in contrast to its past, ABC HD provided region-specific simulcasting, not just a nationwide simulcast of ABN Sydney. Additionally, the channel broadcast in MPEG-4 format as opposed to the traditional MPEG-2 format. As a result of the channel's revival, the ABC News channel was reduced to a standard definition broadcast. Availability Original channel ABC HD was available exclusively in 720p high definition from the network's eight states stations ABC Australian Capital Territory, ABD Northern Territory, ABN New South Wales, ABQ Queensland, ABS South Australia, ABT Tasmania, ABV Victoria, ABW Western Australia. Revival channel Upon its revival on 6 December 2016, ABC HD returned to 1080i50 high definition, but it broadcast in MPEG-4 format as opposed to the standard MPEG-2 format. ABC HD covered all ABC-owned state stations. ABC HD is available to Foxtel cable subscribers via its HD+ package.

A cost estimator will typically use estimating software to estimate their bid price for a project, which will ultimately become part of a resulting construction contract. Some architects, engineers, construction managers, and others may also use cost estimating software to prepare cost estimates for purposes other than bidding. Methods Traditional methods Construction contractors usually prepare bids or tenders to compete for a contract award for a project. To prepare the bid, first a cost estimate is prepared to determine the costs and then establish the price(s). This involves reviewing the project's plans and specifications to produce a take off or quantity survey, which is a listing of all the materials and items of work required for a construction project by the construction documents. Together with prices for these components, the measured quantities are the basis for calculation of the direct cost. Indirect costs and profit are added to arrive at a total amount.Frederick S.

With the advent of computers in business, estimators began using spreadsheet applications like VisiCalc, Lotus 1-2-3, and Microsoft Excel to duplicate the traditional tabular format, while automating redundant mathematical formulas.Christofferson, Jay. \\"Estimating with Microsoft Excel,\\" Brigham Young University.Nickols, Robert Duane. \\"Construction Estimating Using Excel,\\" Lexington Technical Institute, University of Kentucky. Many construction cost estimators continue to rely primarily upon manual methods, hard copy documents, and/or electronic spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. While spreadsheets are relatively easy to master and provide a means to create and report a construction cost estimate and or cost models, their benefit comes largely from their ability to partially relieve estimators of mundane calculations. Accuracy, however, is not necessarily improved and productivity is not maximized. For example, data entry remains tedious and prone to error, formula errors are common, and collaboration and information sharing are limited. Commercial estimating software Estimating Software Block Diagram As cost estimators came to rely heavily on spreadsheets, and the formulas within the spreadsheets became more complex, spreadsheet errors became more frequent.Caulkins, Jonathan P., et al. \\"Do Spreadsheet Errors Lead to Bad Decisions ,\\" Carnegie Mellon University. These were typically formula errors and cell-reference errors which would often lead to cost overruns. As a result, commercial cost estimating software applications were originally created to overcome these errors by using hard-coded formulas and data structures. Other benefits include the use of reference databases for costs and other data, predictable and professional looking reports, speed, accuracy, and overall process standardization. As cost estimating programs became more and more popular over the years, more advanced features, such as saving data for reuse and trade-specific calculations, have become available. For example, programs that are designed for building construction, include libraries and program features for traditional builders. In sharp contrast, programs that are designed for civil construction, include libraries and program features for roadway, utility, and bridge builders. Sophisticated, cost estimating and Efficient Project Delivery Software systems are also available to integrate various construction delivery methods such as Integrated Project Delivery, Job Order Contracting, and others (IDIQ, JOC, SABER...) simultaneously and securely. These systems enable cost estimators and project managers to collaboratively work with multiple projects, multiple estimates, and multiple contracts. A 'short list' of additional capabilities includes the ability to work with multiple cost books/guides/UPBs, track project status, automatically compare estimates, easily copy/paste, clone, and reuse estimates, and integrated sophisticated visual estimating and quantity take-off (QTO) tools. Owners, contractors, architects and engineers are moving to advanced cost estimating and management systems, and many oversight groups such are beginning to also require their use. The level of collaboration, transparency, and information re-use enabled by Cost Estimating and Efficient Project Delivery Software drives 15-25%+ reductions in procurement cycles, six to ten times faster estimating, reduce overall project times, as a significant reduction in change orders and the virtual elimination of contract related legal disputes. Typical features Three functions prove to be the most critical when buying cost estimating software: *Takeoff software - this provides for measurement from paper or electronic plans *Built-in cost databases - this provides reference cost data which may be your own or may come from a commercial source, such as RS Means *Estimating worksheets - these are the spreadsheets where the real work takes place, supported by calculations and other featuresTechTarget. \\"Construction Estimating Software Buyer's Guide: Benefits,\\" Construction Software Review. Other typical features include:Estimate.\\"Open Source Web-based Cost Estimation, Material Takeoff and Reconciliation Tool,\\" Hosted on Sourceforge. * Item or Activity List: All estimating software applications will include a main project window that outlines the various items or activities that will be required to complete the specified project. More advanced programs are capable of breaking an item up into sub-tasks, or sub-levels. An outline view of all of the top-level and sub-level items provides a quick and easy way to view and navigate through the project. * Resource Costs: Resources consist of labor, equipment, materials, subcontractors, trucking, and any other cost detail items. Labor and equipment costs are internal crew costs, whereas all other resource costs are received from vendors, such as material suppliers, subcontractors, and trucking companies. Labor costs are usually calculated from wages, benefits, burden, and workers compensation. Equipment costs are calculated from purchase price, taxes, fuel consumption, and other operating expenses. * Item or Activity Detail: The detail to each item includes all of the resources required to complete each activity, as well as their associated costs. Production rates will automatically determine required crew costs. The SharpeSoft Estimator, displaying an example of a trench calculation. * Calculations: Most estimating programs have built-in calculations ranging from simple length, area, and volume calculations to complex industry-specific calculations, such as electrical calculations, utility trench calculations, and earthwork cut and fill calculations. * Markups: Every program will allow for cost mark-ups ranging from flat overall mark-ups to resource-specific mark-ups, mark-ups for general administrative costs, and bonding costs. * Detailed Overhead: Indirect costs, such as permits, fees, and any other overall project costs can be spread to billable project items. * Closeout Window: Many estimating programs include a screen for manually adjusting bid prices from their calculated values. * Reporting: Project reports typically include proposals, detail reports, cost breakdown reports, and various charts and graphs. * Exporting: Most software programs can export project data to other applications, such as spreadsheets, accounting software, and project management software. * Job History: Storing past projects is a standard feature in most estimating programs.

She was executed by lethal injection, the first woman to be executed in Arkansas since 1845. Killing of Justin Dalton Thomas and Shelby Alexis Riggs Riggs' children were killed in their beds at the family's Sherwood, Arkansas home. The plan involved giving the children undiluted potassium chloride just after giving them amitriptyline to sedate them. However, the potassium chloride was not diluted properly and it burned her son's veins, causing Justin terrible pain but not death.\\"Christina Marie Riggs\\" Office of the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney She eventually smothered him when the injection was ineffective. She then smothered her daughter Shelby, without injecting her, after seeing the pain that the drug caused Justin. She laid the children on her bed, covered them with a blanket, and wrote suicide notes. She then attempted suicide by taking 28 amitriptyline pills and injecting herself with undiluted potassium chloride. Nineteen hours later, Riggs' mother discovered her unconscious on the floor of her home. Riggs' defense said she was suffering from depression and apparently did not want to have her children split up after her intended suicide. The children had different fathers. Trial and conviction At her June 1998 trial, Riggs contended she was not guilty by reason of insanity, but the Pulaski County jury convicted her. During the penalty phase, Riggs would not allow attorneys to put on a defense, saying she wanted a death sentence. Riggs was placed in the Arkansas Department of Correction system and held at the McPherson Unit, which included the female death row, until her execution.Haddigan, Michael. Arkansas Times.

Her family has lived in the West Virginia for generations, and she comes from a long line of coal miners. Activism Gunnoe became involved in activism in 1997 as a volunteer. She expanded her efforts in the 2000s, when a coal company started a mountaintop removal mine near her home. The mining caused pollution and dangerous flooding near her home, leaving her home nearly washed away. The water near her home was also rendered contaminated. To protect her home, Gunnoe decided that she would start activist work against the coal company and mountaintop mining. She has continued to be active in advocating against mountaintop mining despite receiving both threats and acts of violence, including having her dog shot and killed. She has become an organizer for the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition and SouthWings, a company that conducts flights to show aerial views and photography of mountaintop mining and mountaintop removal.

It is in the form of a shallow crescent, some 4 miles or 6 km across, between St Ives in the west and Godrevy Head in the east. At the most southerly point of St Ives Bay, the River Hayle flows into the sea through sand dunes and across the beach. Behind the dunes, the river forms a broad tidal estuary which includes an area of salt marsh and a largely disused port (see article on the industrial history of Hayle). The estuary is a popular place for birdwatching and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds maintains a reserve there. The eastern coast of the bay is a three-mile (5 km) unbroken sandy beach backed by a substantial system of coastal dunes known as The Towans which stretches from Porth Kidney Sands in the west to Godrevy Head in the east. This stretch of beach is popular for surfing, particularly in the Gwithian area. The western side of the bay is on higher ground and is more densely inhabited with substantial settlements at Lelant, Carbis Bay and St Ives. The western coast of the bay is rockier with several small beaches separated by headlands. The Stones reef lies about one mile north-west of Godrevy Head and presents a hazard to navigation - the lighthouse on Godrevy Island warns mariners of the danger. Inshore hazards include the strong tidal stream around Godrevy Island and the tidal current at the mouth of the River Hayle.  Transport and access  The St Ives Bay Line By rail: The Penzance to Plymouth Cornish Main Line railway passes south of the bay with stations at St Erth and Hayle and a branch, the St Ives Bay Line, runs from St Erth to St Ives.

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. Born and raised in Newcastle New South Wales, Cockley attended school at Callaghan College. As a young cricketer he played for the Waratah-Mayfield District Cricket Club. At the age of 17 he made his First Grade debut for Waratah-Mayfield. After being selected in the NSW Country Colts and NSW Country sides, Cockley moved to Sydney to play for Randwick Petersham Cricket Club in the Sydney Grade Cricket Competition. After only one season in Sydney, Cockley was picked for the NSW State side. He debuted in First Class cricket for NSW against Tasmania at Hobart in the 2007/08 season. In February 2009 he was selected by the Kings XI Punjab franchise of the Indian Premier League for the 2009 season and in November 2009 he was added to Australia's injury-ravaged squad in India, as a replacement for Peter Siddle. The last match of the tour which he was called up for was cancelled due to monsoon weather. Upon returning home from the ODI tour of India, Cockley was struck down with a stress fracture in his back while playing against Western Australia and ruled out for the following 5 months. Upon his return through grade cricket with his grade club, Randwick Petersham DCC, he ruptured his ACL in his front leg while bowling a bouncer. Complication ensued with staph infection in his knee which required the hamstring graft to be removed. 10 weeks later a new graft was inserted into his knee once the infection and knee had settled down following the complications. Cockley returned to playing after 10 months of rehab and managed to finish out the remainder of the 2011/12 season with NSW 2nd XI. He moved to Western Australia in 2012 and played his first matches for the state team early in 2013. Cockley tore his meniscus in the same troubled knee while playing against England in a tour game for Western Australia which required surgery. Cockley came off contract at the end of the 2013/14 season. In 2017 Cockley moved back to Newcastle for 5 months while waiting for his visa to be approved for the USA. Cockley took on a playing/coaching role with his old club Waratah Mayfield DCC and also represented Newcastle DCA that also won the NSW Country State Championships. Cockley now resides in Kansas, USA where he has relocated with his wife. Cockley is currently completing his Masters of Sports Science Degree and working as a strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas.

As a result the B3 class was developed from the B2, and the B2X class was later rebuilt from these locomotives with larger boilers. History When R. J. Billinton took over as chief mechanical engineer of the LB&SCR; in 1890, following the sudden death of William Stroudley, the London to Brighton trains were adequately served by Stroudley's Gladstone class but the lighter Portsmouth expresses were beginning to struggle behind his G class singles. Billinton therefore designed a small 4-4-0, specifically for these services. However, during the course of 1892-1893 the London-to-Brighton trains began to increase in weight, and the board of governors of the railway agreed to invest money in larger turntables and so Billinton was able to enlarge his design further to make them more generally useful. Three locomotives appeared in 1895, with a further eight in 1896 and fourteen in 1897. They were named after famous politicians, bankers and railway engineers. The new design was clearly influenced by the locomotives of Samuel Waite Johnson on the Midland Railway, for whom Billinton had previously worked, and were the first LB&SCR; locomotives to have leading bogie wheels. It incorporated Billinton's C2 class boiler. They proved to be adequate for the lightly loaded Portsmouth express trains but barely so for heavier trains. They also tended to ride unevenly and consequently acquired the nickname of grasshoppers by their crews. B3 and B2X classes As a result of the complaints about the use of the class on the Brighton line, Billinton fitted the last locomotive in the class No. 213 Bessemer, with a larger boiler when new, which thereafter became known as the B3 class. This caused a slight improvement in performance but not one significant enough to alter the entire class at that time. However, once the original boilers were worn out, it became more of an economic proposition to do so. Thus between October 1907 and 1910, Billinton's successor Douglas Earle Marsh rebuilt the entire class (including 213 Bessemer) with the improved boiler used on his C3 class, thereby creating the B2X class. The rebuilt locomotives were a significant improvement in both looks and performance and were used on the heaviest expresses to Portsmouth and Hastings and semi-fast trains on the Brighton line.  Post-grouping  All 25 locomotives were still in regular use in December 1922, at the grouping of the railways of southern England to form the Southern Railway. The class continued to find useful work on secondary passenger services between London and the south coast until 1929, when the impending electrification of the Brighton line began to make them redundant. They were thus all withdrawn between June 1929 and March 1933, and none have survived in preservation. Accidents and incidents *On 9 July 1928, B2X locomotive No. B210 was in a sidelong collision with an electric multiple unit at due to the driver misreading signals. Two people were killed and nine were injured, six seriously.

It holds the official Guinness World Record as world's largest walk when a record-breaking 77,500 participants joined on 21 May 2000 at the Singapore National Stadium to mark the 10th anniversary. The 10-kilometre walk takes an estimated 3 hours to complete and usually starts from its traditional starting point, Singapore National Stadium at 6 o'clock in the morning. History The event was founded by The New Paper. The very first Big Walk took place on 16 June 1991, and only 4,500 walkers were expected. However, expectations were exceeded when more than 7,000 walkers showed up on the day of the walk. Since then, the event has become more popular and today boasts the participation of tens of thousands of people annually. On its 10th anniversary, The New Paper Big Walk 2000 broke into the official Guinness World record as World's Largest Walk. Having the Guinness certificate means that this popular Singaporean mass event has ranked among the largest world events, such as the Boston Marathon. The event took a one-year hiatus in 2007, amid news that its venue of choice, the National Stadium at Kallang & Madash, was going to be torn down to make way for a world-class integrated sports' hub. Locations The Singapore National Stadium Regarded as the venue of choice by The New Paper for its crowd-friendly features, character and location, the Singapore National Stadium has long been an integral part to the event's success. However, the impending news that the Singapore government had plans to tear down the National Stadium to make way for a new state-of-the-art integrated sports hub led to the organizers decision to take a one-year hiatus as they went in search of an alternative venue for the event. The 2008 edition of the event was relocated to Marina Bay area and was aptly renamed \\"The Big Walk on Water.\\" The Marina Barrage As part of The New Paper's 20th- anniversary celebrations, The New Paper Big Walk relocated to Singapore's \\"coolest\\" and \\"hottest\\" spots. Flagging off at Suntec City's Fountain of Wealth, the revised 5 kilometres walk take participants across the Marina Channel, The Esplanade, the Singapore Flyer, and part of the race track of the Formula One Singtel Singapore Grand Prix, which was held on 28 September 2008, before ending at the Marina Barrage. The Big Walk on Water The \\"Big Walk on Water\\" is the new event name for The New Paper Big Walk as it makes its transition from the crowd-friendly National Stadium to the waters of Marina Bay. The event, which returned after a one-year hiatus, also marked the 20th anniversary of its organizers—The New Paper—and allowed readers and participants a chance to \\"walk on water\\" by crossing the dam across the Marina Channel. Participation The New Paper Big Walk has been attracting more and more locals, which explain the leap in numbers, an increase by approximately 11 times since its inaugural walk back in 1991. Today, the event attracts a healthy participation rate that includes both registered and non-registered participants that add to the spectacle of the event. Programs and contests Other than the 5 km walk, there was a series of fun-filled programs and contests organised. A post walk carnival at Suntec City Mall was held, where three contests like Spot Me, Green Fancy Dress and Stabilo Colouring awarded Fairprice shopping vouchers. Significance The Big Walk on Water 2008 was organised to mark three significant events that happened that year. First, the event was held as part of the celebrations for the success of the inaugural Formula One Singtel Singapore Grand Prix race—F1's first ever night race—held on 28 September 2008, by moving participants onto part of the race track where the drivers drove on race day. Second, the event was also to mark the opening of the new Marina Barrage that officially opened on 1 November 2008. Participants of the Big Walk on Water will most likely be the first few people to be allowed to visit the magnificent new Barrage and reservoir at Marina Bay. The Big Walk on Water was organised to mark the 20th anniversary of \\"The New Paper\\". The change of name and its new location highlight and signify the \\"New Paper's\\" evolution to become one of Singapore's best selling newspapers today. The New Paper Big Walk@Marina Bay 2010 After skipping a year, the New Paper Big Walk returned in 2010. It was held on 18 July 2010, in conjunction with the significant openings of many new developments in Singapore. The 5 km route will allow the walkers to take in sights such as the Marina Bay skyline, the Singapore Flyer and the Helix Bridge, at a leisurely pace. Some 20,000 participants were expected to put their best foot forward for The New Paper Big Walk @ Marina Bay 2010. The Big Walk was co-organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), with sponsors NTUC FairPrice, Singapore Flyer, POSBank, Anlene, Nikon Singapore and Asus Singapore.

The building is one of Japan's Registered Tangible Cultural Properties. History Salon de thé François was established in 1934 by Shōichi Tateno (September 7, 1908 – June 6, 1995). The building was originally built as a traditional wooden townhouse (Machiya) and was later converted into a western- style café.Sato, Yuichi \\"Kyoto popular front: Anti-fascist movement at a café in Kyoto during the 1930s,\\" Hokuto Shobo Books, Kyoto, Japan, , 2012. Tateno had graduated from Kyoto Municipal Art School and became one of the most active leaders of the labor movement in Kyoto in the 1930s. He decided to found a café with the spirit of enlightenment of socialism and art. The café was named “Salon de thé François” in homage to the French painter Jean- François Millet. The profit of the Salon de thé François became a secret source for funding the Japanese Communist Party. On July 1936, the Salon de thé François started to support distribution of an anti-fascist newspaper, “Doyōbi.” The Doyōbi (“Saturday,” in Japanese) was a six-page tabloid edited by Masakazu Nakai, a lecturer at Kyoto Imperial University, and Raitarō Saitō, an actor at the Shochiku movie studio. The Doyōbi was issued twice a month, distributed mainly in Kyoto and Osaka, and reached a circulation of 8,000. In July 1937, a week after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tateno was arrested because of his anti-war activities. In November 1937, Nakai and Saito were also arrested and the Doyōbi was discontinued. During their imprisonment, Rushiko Sato, one of the hall staff members, operated the Salon de thé François. After his release from Yamashina Prison, Tateno decided to remodel the Salon de thé François. Tateno asked an Italian friend, Alexsandro Bencivenni, to design a new interior. Bencivenni was an academic at Kyoto Imperial University who had escaped from fascist Italy. In these days, Fosco Maraini, an Italian ethnologist, also resided at Kyoto Imperial University for the same reason. While Bencivenni worked on the master plan, Shirō Takagi, another friend of Tateno, designed stained glass windows and painted several murals. The interior hall of 40 square meters was arched with a dome 4.5 meters high, which emulated a public room of an ocean liner sailing between Europe and Asia. The decorative motif represented the Italian Baroque style of the 17th century although several columns were designed to represent the style of the Italian Renaissance. The Salon de thé François continued business even after the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, although the name was changed to Japanese “Miyako Sabō” (Kyoto Tea Room) because of the prohibition of the use of enemy languages. When Italy signed the armistice with the allies on September 1943, the Japanese authorities demanded Bencivenni declare allegiance to the fascist puppet republic of Salo. Bencivenni refused to do this and consequently was interned with Fosco Maraini and other Italians in a concentration camp at Nagoya for two years.Maraini, Fosco “Meeting with Japan” translated from the Italian by Eric Mosbacher, Viking Press, New York, 1959Maraini, Dacaia “Ein Schiff nach Kobe” Das Tagebuch meiner mutter, Aus dem Italienischen von Eva-Maria Wager, Pieper Verlag GmbH, München, 2003 The Salon de thé François could no longer purchase coffee beans, and thus served green tea and dried banana chips as snacks. Tateno closed the shop in late 1944 because of the shortage of food and increased air raids. The Salon de thé François returned to business after the end of the war. In 2002, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs certified the building as a Registered Tangible Cultural Property. The three children of Tateno now operates the shop.

The deviation of the line is some distance to the west of the original line and crosses the Hutt River on a steel bridge with concrete piers - the replacement station is several hundred yards to the north of the old station. An adjacent level crossing had automatically locking gates installed to stop pedestrians using the crossing until a second train clears the crossing (after a 2003 accident).

After being commissioned in Europe, he commanded troops of the British Army in North America and the West Indies, including during the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War. Prevost was recalled to service during the American Revolutionary War, when he served briefly as colonial governor of the Province of Georgia in 1778 after the British occupied Savannah, Georgia. He also served more than once in the West Indies and died in Jamaica of wounds suffered earlier in the war. Early life Prevost was born in 1736 in the French-speaking Republic of Geneva to a family originally from Bossy near Geneva.Prevost (Prévost) (GE), in the Historical Dictionary of Switzerland. He had eight siblings, including elder brothers Augustine (born 1723) and Jacques Prevost (born 1725). The two elder brothers both served in the army of the King of Sardinia, who then ruled the Dutch Republic. Seven Years' War Prevost appears to have joined his two brothers in the military in the Netherlands. They were recruited and commissioned as officers by Great Britain for its new Royal American Regiment: Augustine received the rank of major, Jacques the rank of colonel, and Jacques Marcus the rank of captain. In the Thirteen colonies, Britain recruited German and Swiss immigrant settlers as soldiers for the regiment after General Benjamin Braddock's defeat in 1755 in western Pennsylvania in the French and Indian Wars. Britain was threatened by war with France as part of the Seven Years' War in Europe. The three Prevost brothers were sent as officers to North America in 1756. Jacques Marcus was wounded at the battle of Ticonderoga in New York in 1758. Augustine was also seriously wounded that year, while serving with General James Wolfe's army near Quebec. The two Prevost brothers recuperated in New York City. Augustine served further with the Royal American Regiment, especially in the Caribbean, rising to lieutenant colonel. After recovery, in 1761 Jacques Marcus traveled with Henry Bouquet, a Swiss colonel in the Royal American Regiment, to set up a British post at Presque Isle (present-day Erie, Pennsylvania). They intended to deter French troops at Fort Niagara. Prevost was next assigned to command a body of troops in New York City; after Britain defeated France and military activity was reduced, he was put on half pay. Marriage and family While in New York City convalescing, Jacques Marc had met Theodosia Stillwell Bartow. They married in Trinity Church in 1763. They had five children together, including Augustine James Frederick Prevost (1765–1842) and John Bartow Prevost (1766–1825). While he was away fighting for the British, Prevost's wife Theodosia formed a relationship with the ten years younger American politician Aaron Burr. She married him in 1782, soon after learning she was a widow. Burr adopted Prevost's five children. They had five children together, but only daughter Theodosia Burr Alston survived to adulthood, and she was lost at sea. Northwest wars Prevost's next assignment was to command a detachment of Bouquet's force at Fort Loudoun on the Pennsylvania frontier. He fought against Native American forces in the Muskingum River Valley of present-day Ohio, returning to Theodosia in New York in 1765. Prevost went back onto half pay for several years. After his unit was posted to the West Indies in 1772, he returned to New York in 1773. By then the couple had moved to their Ho-Ho- Kus, New Jersey residence, called The Hermitage. American War of Independence At the outbreak of the American War of Independence, Prevost was a lieutenant-colonel living at home in Paramus, New Jersey. He and his elder brother, brigadier general Augustine Prevost, were stationed at St. Augustine to help lead the Southern campaign for the British. Jaques Marcus Prevost led British troops at the Battle of Brier Creek, a rout of the Americans that reversed their momentum and delayed the eventual outcome by a year. The battle culminated with the British capture of Savannah in December 1778, where Prevost was briefly assigned as British governor of Georgia, in succession to Archibald Campbell. Georgia was the only American state to be retaken by the British in the war. Sent with troops to Jamaica to put down an uprising in 1781, he died there that year of wounds suffered earlier in the war. While Prevost was in the South fighting successfully for the British, his wife Theodosia Bartow Prevost was at their home in New Jersey hosting George Washington and other leaders of the Continental Army. Guests at their home included James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr.

The language being unattested in any readable contemporary source, hypotheses regarding its nature are reduced to purported loanwords and substratum influence, notably the substratum in Vedic Sanskrit and a few terms recorded in Sumerian cuneiform (such as Meluhha), in conjunction with analyses of the undeciphered Indus script. There are a handful of possible loanwords from the language of the Indus Valley Civilization. Sumerian Meluhha may be derived from a native term for the Indus Valley Civilization, also reflected in Sanskrit mleccha meaning foreigner and Witzel (2000) further suggests that Sumerian GIŠšimmar (a type of tree) may be cognate to Rigvedic śimbala and śalmali (also names of trees).An Indus loanword of \\"para-Munda\\" nature in Mesopotamian has been identified by Michael Witzel, A first link between the Rgvedic Panjab and Mesopotamia: śimbala/śalmali, and GIŠšimmar? In: Klaus Karttunen and Petteri Koskikallio (eds.) Vidyarnavavandanam. Essays in Honour of Asko Parpola. 2000 (Studia Orientalia, published by the Finnish Or. Soc. 94): 497–508. See also Witzel, The language or languages of the Indus civilization , July 2007. Identification There are a number of hypotheses as to the nature of this unknown language: *One hypothesis places it in the vicinity of Dravidian, perhaps identical with Proto-Dravidian itself. Proposed by Henry Heras in the 1950s,Heras, Henry. Studies in Proto-Indo-Mediterranean Culture, Bombay: Indian Historical Research Institute, 1953. the hypothesis has gained plausibility and is endorsed by Kamil Zvelebil, Asko Parpola and Iravatham Mahadevan. *Michael Witzel as an alternative suggests an underlying, prefixing language that is similar to Austroasiatic, notably Khasi; he calls it \\"para-Munda\\" (i.e. a language related to the Munda subgroup or other Austroasiatic languages, but not strictly descended from the last common predecessor of the contemporary Munda family). Witzel argues that the Rigveda shows signs of this hypothetical Harappan influence in the earliest historic level, and Dravidian only in later levels, suggesting that speakers of Austroasiatic were the original inhabitants of Punjab and that the Indo-Aryans encountered speakers of Dravidian only in later times.Michael Witzel, Substrate Languages in Old Indo-Aryan. EJVS 5,1, Aug. 1999, 1-67 cf. reprint in: International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, IJDL 2001, 1 sqq. *a \\"lost phylum\\", i.e. a language with no living continuants (or perhaps a last living reflex in the moribund Nihali language). In this case, the only trace left by the language of the Indus Valley Civilization would be historical substratum influence, in particular the substratum in Vedic Sanskrit. Hypotheses that have gained less mainstream academic acceptance include: *an Indo-European language, close or identical to Proto-Indo-Iranian: suggested by archaeologist Shikaripura Ranganatha Rao.Indo-Iranian presence is likely only from the Late Harappan period (20th century BCE) at the earliest; see e.g. *a Semitic language: Malati Shendge (1997) identified the Harappan culture with an \\"Asura\\" empire, and these Asura further with the Assyrians.Malati Shendge, The Language of the Harappans Abhinav Publications (1997), .  Multiple languages  The Indus script indicates that it was used to write only one language (if at all). But it is quite possible that multiple languages were spoken in the IVC, similar to how Sumerian and Akkadian co-existed in Mesopotamia for centuries. Jane R. McIntosh suggests one such possibility: Para-Munda was originally the main language of the civilization, especially in the Punjab region. Later, the proto-Dravidian immigrants introduced their language to the area in 5th millennium BC. The Dravidian language was spoken by the new settlers in the southern plains, while Para-Munda remained the main language of those in Punjab.

Radial axles were widely used on carriages in the late 19th century before the adoption of bogies. They were also used on the leading or trailing carrying axles of locomotives, particularly tank locomotives. The idea was first tried successfully by William Bridges Adams on the London and South Western Railway in 1863 and was known as the Adams Axle. It was subsequently taken up by other engineers, notably his namesake William Adams, Locomotive Superintendent of the LSWR, who introduced a class now known as \\"Adams Radials\\". Radial axles were also used in locomotives designed by F.W. Webb of the London and North Western Railway, and by William Stroudley and R. J. Billinton of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway. Webb's form of radial axle used a cannon box bearing where the two axle bearings are carried in a single curved casting, the 'cannon box', which can slide sideways in a circular track. David Joy, designer of the eponymous valvegear, described encountering these axleboxes on Webb's Precedent class. The earlier Adams design had relied on the axle and thrust- faces within the axle bearings to keep the hornblocks in position.

They were founded in 1998, first presented by the Gaylactic Network in 1999, and in 2002 they were given their own organization, the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards Foundation. Awards are given in categories for novels, short fiction and best other work, although in some years the award for short fiction has not been presented due to lack of sufficient nominees or no nominee of high enough quality. Other categories have also been added and removed in intervening years, and works produced before the inception of the awards are eligible to be inducted into the \\"Hall of Fame\\". The short fiction category is open to submissions of short written works released during the prior calendar year in North America that includes \\"significant positive GLBT content\\". The long list of nominees is reduced to a short list of finalists, and the results are generally announced and presented at Gaylaxicon, a convention dedicated to LGBT science fiction, although they have also been presented at Worldcon in the past. This article lists all the \\"Best short fiction\\" award nominees and winners, and short fiction hall of fame inductees. Each award consists of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in a triangle logo, which is based on the logo the Gaylactic Network. The award winner's name, work title, award year and award category are etched on a small plaque on the base or on the plexiglass itself. A small cash stipend is awarded to winners in the Best Short Fiction category. The cost of the awards is paid for through individual donations and fundraising events.

Indigenous Americans have been using native metals from ancient times, with recent finds of gold artifacts in the Andean region dated to 2155-1936 BCE, and North American copper finds dated to approximately 5000 BCE. The metal would have been found in nature without need for smelting, and shaped into the desired form using hot and cold hammering without chemical alteration or alloying. To date \\"no one has found evidence that points to the use of melting, smelting and casting in prehistoric eastern North America.\\" In South America the case is quite different. Indigenous South Americans had full metallurgy with smelting and various metals being purposely alloyed. Metallurgy in Mesoamerica and Western Mexico may have developed following contact with South America through Ecuadorian marine traders.Anawalt, Patricia Rieff. \\"Ancient Cultural Contacts between Ecuador, West Mexico, and the American Southwest: Clothing Similarities.\\" Latin American Antiquity 3, no. 2 (1992): 121. South America South American metal working seems to have developed in the Andean region of modern Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina with gold and copper being hammered and shaped into intricate objects, particularly ornaments. Recent finds date the earliest gold work to 2155-1936 BCE. and the earliest copper work to 1432-1132 BCE.Boletín del Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino. Volumen 15, Nº 1, 2010 - more articles in Spanish in regard to ancient metalwork from the same period Ice core studies in Bolivia however suggest copper smelting may have begun as early as 2000 BCE. Further evidence for this type of metal work comes from the sites at Waywaka (near es:Andahuaylas, Lugares de interés, southern Peru), Chavín and Kotosh, and it seems to have been spread throughout Andean societies by the Early horizon (1000-200 BCE). Unlike other metallurgy traditions where metals gained importance through practical use in weaponry and everyday utensils, metals in South America (and later Central America) were mainly valued as adornments and status objects (though some functional objects might have been produced). During the Early horizon, advances in metal working produced spectacular and characteristic Andean gold objects made by the joining of smaller metal sheets, and also gold-silver alloy appeared. Two traditions seem to have developed alongside each other - one in northern Peru and Ecuador, and another in the Altiplano region of southern Peru, Bolivia and Chile. There is evidence for smelting of copper sulphide in the Altiplano region around the Early horizon. Evidence for this comes from copper slag recovered at several sites, with the ore itself possibly coming from the south Chilean-Bolivian border. Near Puma Punku, Bolivia and at three additional sites in Peru and Bolivia, \\"portable\\" smelting kilns were used to manufacture I-beams in situ, to join large stone blocks during construction. Their chemical analysis shows 95.15% copper, 2.05% arsenic, 1.70% nickel, .84% silicon and .26% iron. The estimated date of these pours lies between 800 -500 BCE. Evidence for fully developed smelting, however, only appears with the Moche culture (northern coast, 200 BCE-600 CE). The ores were extracted from shallow deposits in the Andean foothills. They were probably smelted nearby, as pictorially depicted on the metal artifacts themselves and on ceramic vessels. Smelting was done in adobe brick furnaces with at least three blow pipes to provide the air flow needed to reach the high temperatures. The resulting ingots would then have been moved to coastal centers for shaping in specialised workshops. Two workshops found and studied near the administrative sections of their towns, again showing the prestige of metal. The objects themselves were still mainly adornments, now often being attached to beads. Some functional objects were fashioned, but they were elaborately decorated and often found in high-status burials, seemingly still used more for symbolic than for practical purposes. The appearance of gold or silver seems to have been important, with a high number of gilded or silvered objects as well as the appearance of Tumbaga, a alloy of copper and gold, and sometimes also silver. Arsenic bronze was also smelted from sulphidic ores, a practice either independently developed or learned from the southern tradition. The earliest known powder metallurgy, and earliest working of platinum in the world, was apparently developed by the cultures of Esmeraldas (NW Ecuador) before the Spanish Conquest Beginning with the La Tolita culture (600 bc - 200 ad), Ecuadorian cultures mastered the soldering of platinum grains through alloying with copper, gold and silver, producing platinum-surfaced rings, handles, ornaments and utensils. This technology was eventually noticed and adopted by the Spanish c.1730. Metallurgy gradually spread north into Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica, reaching Guatemala and Belize by 800 CE. By c.100-700 CE, 'depletion gilding' was developed by the Nahuange culture of Colombia to produce ornamental variations such as 'rose gold'. Only with the Incas did metals really come into practical use. Nonetheless, they remained materials through which to display wealth and status. The characteristic importance placed on colour, which had led to some of the earlier developments, was still present (sun/moon association with gold/silver). Metals other than gold also had an intrinsic value, with axe pieces being of particular note in this regard. With the spread of metal tools by the Incas, it is thought possible that a more Old World use of metals would have become more common. In any case, as Bruhns notes, \\"Bronze can be seen as an expensive substitute for the equally efficient stone\\". Central America and Caribbean  Gold, copper and tumbaga objects started being produced in Panama and Costa Rica between 300-500 CE. Open-molded casting with oxidation gilding and cast filigrees were in use. By 700-800 CE, small metal sculptures were common and an extensive range of gold and tumbaga ornaments comprised the usual regalia of persons of high status in Panama and Costa Rica. The earliest specimen of metalwork from the Caribbean is a gold-alloy sheet carbon dated to 70-374 CE. Most Caribbean metallurgy has been dated to between 1200 and 1500 CE and consists of simple, small pieces such as sheets, pendants, beads and bells. These are mostly gold or a gold alloy (with copper or silver) and have been found to be largely cold hammered and sand-polished alluvial nuggets, although a few items seem to have been produced by lost wax casting. It is presumed that at least some of these items were acquired by trade from Colombia Marcos Martinon-Torres et al, 'Metallic Encounters in Cuba: the technology, exchange and meaning of metals before and after Columbus,' Journal of Anthropological Archaeology Vol.31: 4, December 2012, pp. 439-454 Mesoamerica Copper alloy bells and tool, Tarascan state (1300 to 1530) Metallurgy only appears in Mesoamerica in 800 CE with the best evidence from West Mexico. Much like in South America, fine metals were seen as a material for the elite. Metal's special qualities of colour and resonance seemed to have appealed most and then led to the particular technological developments seen in the region. Exchange of ideas and goods with peoples from the Ecuador and Colombia region (likely via a maritime route) seems to have fueled early interest and development. Similar metal artifact types are found in West Mexico and the two regions: copper rings, needles and tweezers being fabricated in the same ways as in Ecuador and also found in similar archaeological contexts. A multitude of bells were also found, but in this case they were cast using the same lost-wax casting method as seen in Colombia. During this period, copper was being used almost exclusively. Continual contact kept the flow of ideas from that same region and later, coinciding with the development of Andean long distance maritime trade, influence from further south seems to have reached the region and led to a second period (1200-1300 CE to the Spanish arrival). By this time, copper alloys were being explored by West Mexican metallurgists, partly because the different mechanical properties were needed to fashion specific artifacts, particularly axe-monies - further evidence for contact with the Andean region. However, in general the new properties such alloys introduced were developed to meet regional needs, especially wirework bells, which at times had such high tin content in the bronze that it was irrelevant for its mechanical properties but gave the bells a golden colour. The actual artifacts and then techniques were imported from the south, but west Mexican metallurgists worked ores from the abundant local deposits; the metal was not being imported. Even when the technology spread from West into north-eastern, central and southern Mexico, artifacts that can be traced back to West Mexican ores are abundant, if not exclusive. It is not always clear if the metal reached its final destination as an ingot, an ore or a finished artifact. Provenance studies on metal artifacts from southern Mesoamerica cast with the lost-wax technique and dissimilar to west Mexican artifacts have shown that there might have been a second point of emergence of metallurgy into Mesoamerica there since no known source could be identified. The Aztecs did not initially adopt metal working, even though they had acquired metal objects from other peoples. However, as conquest gained them metal working regions, the technology started to spread. By the time of the Spanish conquest, a bronze-smelting technology seemed to be nascent. Northern America Hopewell copper falcon, ca. 200 BCE-1 CE, Ohio\\"Falcon-shaped Cut-Out.\\" Ohio Pix. (retrieved 12 July 2011) Malden, Etowah and Spiro Moundville Archaeological evidence has not revealed metal smelting or alloying of metals by pre-Columbian native peoples north of the Rio Grande; however, they did use native copper extensively. As widely accepted as this statement might be it should not be considered synonymous with a lack of metal objects, as it points out native copper was relatively abundant, particularly in the Great Lakes region. The latest glacial period had resulted in the scouring of copper bearing rocks. Once the ice retreated, these were readily available for use in a variety of sizes. Copper was shaped via cold hammering into objects from very early dates (Archaic period in the Great Lakes region: 8000-1000 BCE). There is also evidence of actual mining of copper veins (Old Copper Complex), but disagreement exists as to the dates. Extraction would have been extremely difficult. Hammerstones may have been used to break off pieces small enough to be worked. This labor-intensive process might have been eased by building a fire on top of the deposit, then quickly dousing the hot rock with water, creating small cracks. This process could be repeated to create more small cracks. The copper could then be cold- hammered into shape, which would make it brittle, or hammered and heated in an annealing process to avoid this. The final object would then have to be ground and sharpened using local sandstone. Numerous bars have also been found, possibly indicative of trade for which their shaping into a bar would also serve as proof of quality. Great Lake artifacts found in the Eastern Woodlands of North America seem to indicate there were widespread trading networks by 1000 BCE. Progressively the usage of copper for tools decreases with more jewelry and adornments being found. This is believed to be indicative of social changes to a more hierarchical society. Thousands of copper mining pits have been found along the lake shore of Lake Superior, and on Isle Royale. These pits may have been in use as far back as 8,000 years ago. This copper was mined and then made into objects such as heavy spear points and tools of all kinds. It was also made into mysterious crescent objects that some archaeologists believe were religious or ceremonial items. The crescents were too fragile for utilitarian use, and many have 28 or 29 notches along the inner edge, the approximate number of days in a lunar month. However this Great Lake model as a unique source of copper and of copper technologies remaining somewhat static for over 6,000 years has recently come into some level of criticism, particularly since other deposits seem to have been available to ancient North Americans, even if a lot smaller. The Old Copper Culture mainly flourished in Ontario and Minnesota. However at least 50 Old Copper items, including spear points and ceremonial crescents have been discovered in Manitoba. A few more in Saskatchewan, and at least one, a crescent, has turned up in Alberta, 2,000 kilometres from its homeland in Ontario. It is most likely that these copper items arrived in the plains as trade goods rather than people of the Old Copper Culture moving into these new places. However from one excavated site in eastern Manitoba we can see that at least some people were moving northwest. At a site near Bissett archaeologists have found copper tools, weapons, and waste material of manufacture, along with a large nugget of raw copper. This site however was dated to around 4,000 years ago, a time of cooler climate when the boreal forest's treeline moved much further south. Though if these migrants moved with their metallurgy up the Winnipeg River at this time they may have continued onward, into Lake Winnipeg, and the Saskatchewan River system. This Old Copper Culture never became particularity advanced, and never discovered the principal of creating alloys. This means that many, though they could make metal objects and weapons, continued to use their flint tools, which could maintain a sharper edge for much longer. The unalloyed copper could simply not compete, and in the later days of the Old Copper Culture the metal was almost exclusively used for ceremonial items. During the Mississippian period (800-1600 CE, varying locally), elites at major political and religious centers throughout the midwestern and southeastern United States used copper ornamentation as a sign of their status by crafting the sacred material into representations connected with the Chiefly Warrior cult of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (S.E.C.C.). This ornamentation includes Mississippian copper plates, repousséd plates of beaten copper now found as far afield as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. Some of the more famous of the plates are of raptorial birds and avian-themed dancing warriors. These plates, such as the Rogan plates from Etowah, the Spiro plates from the Spiro in Oklahoma, and the Wulfing cache from southeast Missouri, were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept known as the S.E.C.C. The only Mississippian culture site where a copper workshop has been located by archaeologists is Cahokia in western Illinois, where a copper workshop dating to the Moorehead Phase (c. 1200 CE) was identified at Mound 34. Gregory Perino identified the site in 1956 and archaeologists subsequently excavated it. Numerous copper fragments were found at the site; metallographic analysis indicated that Mississippian copper workers worked copper into thin sheet through repeated hammering and annealing, a process that could be successful over open-pit wood fires. After the collapse of the Mississippian way of life in the 1500s with the advent of European colonization, copper still retained a place in Native American religious life as a special material. Copper was traditionally regarded as sacred by many historic period Eastern tribes. Copper nuggets are included in medicine bundles among Great Lakes tribes. Among 19th century Muscogee Creeks, a group of copper plates carried along the Trail of Tears are regarded as some of the tribe's most sacred items.  Iron in the Pacific Northwest  Native ironwork in the Northwest Coast has been found in places like the Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site, where iron chisels and knives were discovered. These artifacts seem to have been crafted around 1613, based on the dendrochronological analysis of associated pieces of wood in the site, and were made out of drift iron from Asian (specifically Japanese) shipwrecks, which were swept by the Kuroshio Current towards the coast of North America.Coupland, G., Mackie, Q. & Matson, R.G. (2003) Emerging from the Mist: Studies in Northwest Coast Culture History. Vancouver: UBC Press. The tradition of working with Asian drift iron was well-developed in the Northwest before European contact, and was present among several native peoples from the region, including the Chinookan peoples and the Tlingit, who seem to have had their own specific word for the metallic material, which was transcribed by Frederica De Laguna as gayES. The wrecking of Japanese vessels in the North Pacific basin was fairly common, and the iron tools and weaponry they carried provided the necessary materials for the development of the local ironwork traditions among the Northwestern Pacific Coast peoples,Quimby, G.I. (1985) Japanese Wrecks, Iron Tools, and Prehistoric Indians of the Northwest Coast. Arctic Anthropology, 22 (2), pp. 7-15. although there were also other sources of iron, like that from meteorites, which was occasionally worked using stone anvils.

As of 2018, official statistics showed 16,198 registered foreigners of Pakistani origin living in the country.https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/nenkan/69nenkan/1431-02.html There were a further estimated 3,414 illegal immigrants from Pakistan in Japan as of 2000. The average increase in Pakistani population is about 2-3 persons per day if we compare the statistics from 2000 to onward.https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/nenkan/69nenkan/1431-02.html Migration history As early as 1950, only three years after the independence of Pakistan in 1947 which created the Pakistani state, there were recorded to be four Pakistanis living in Japan. However, Pakistani migration to Japan would not grow to a large scale until the 1980s. The later Pakistani migrants in Japan largely come from a muhajir background; their family history of migration made them consider working overseas as a \\"natural choice\\" when they found opportunities at home to be too limited. While Pakistanis saw North America as a good destination to settle down and start a business, Japanese employment agencies commonly advertised in Karachi newspapers in the 1980s, when Japan offered some of the highest wages in the world for unskilled labour; it came to be preferred as a destination by single male migrants, who came without their families. The wages they earned could reach as high as twenty times what they made in Pakistan. Another attraction of Japan over other traditional migration destinations, particularly the Middle East, was the social freedom it offered to migrants; some young Pakistanis came not so much out of economic motives, but instead out of a desire to find freedom which seemed unattainable at home or in other Muslim countries. Pakistani citizens once enjoyed the privilege of short-term visa-free entry to Japan, but when controversy arose in Japanese society over illegal foreign workers, the Japanese government revoked this privilege. With little chance of acquiring a work visa or even permission to enter the country, Pakistanis paid as much as ¥300,000 to people smugglers in the late 1980s and early 1990s to enter the country. According to Japanese government statistics, the number of Pakistanis illegally residing in Japan peaked in 1992 at 8,056 individuals and declined after that. However, Pakistani sources suggest that as late as 1999, the total population of Pakistanis was 25,000 and still included a significant amount of illegal immigrants. Some Pakistanis were able to obtain legal resident status by finding Japanese spouses. However, in the tightened security environment following the September 11 attacks in the United States, many were deported; the population shrunk to around 10,000 legal immigrants. In January 2010, two children born in Japan to a Filipina mother and a Pakistani father were ordered to be deported along with their parents because the latter lacked proper visas when they came to Japan 20 years earlier. Demographics Pakistan festival in Ueno Park, Tokyo According to 2008 Japanese government figures, 19.9% of registered Pakistanis lived in Saitama, 17.8% in Tokyo, 12.3% in Kanagawa, 10.4% in Aichi, 8.98% in Chiba, 7.59% in Gunma, 6.02% in Ibaraki, 4.44% in Tochigi, 4.21% in Toyama, 3.27% in Shizuoka and the remaining 4.98% in other prefectures of Japan.7 Only an estimated 200 Pakistanis hold Japanese citizenship. Business and employment Many Pakistanis in Japan run used car export businesses. This trend was believed to have begun in the late 1970s, when one Pakistani working in Japan sent a car back to his homeland. The potential for doing business in used cars also attracted more Pakistanis to come to Japan in the 1990s. Though many migrants come from a middle-class family background in Pakistan, because they often work at so-called Dirty, Dangerous and Demeaning (3D/3K) jobs and because of their portrayal in the Japanese media, even their co-workers tended to misperceive their background and level of education. Religion Many Japanese wives of Pakistani migrants have converted to Islam and in fact form the largest group of native Japanese converts to Islam. They often send their children to mosques so that they can learn about their ancestral religion and study the Arabic language. In 2001, an incident of Qur'an desecration in Toyama, where about 150 Pakistanis lived, sparked protests from the community. At least one Qur'an was taken from a makeshift prayer room used by Pakistanis, with allegations that six others had also been stolen; someone later left torn Qur'an pages at a Pakistani-owned used car dealership. Hundreds of Pakistani Muslims marched in Tokyo and nine representatives from the Pakistani Association of Japan met with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to deliver a letter of protest. In 1989, the Islamic Center in Japan requested publishers, newspapers, magazines and broadcast stations not to translate or reproduce the novel The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie which it called an \\"anti-Islamic\\" work that \\"contains filthy remarks and ridicules fundamental beliefs of Islam\\". A leader of the Japanese association of Pakistanis joined the condemnations of Rushdie, saying he deserved to die because of the book. Subsequently, the Japanese translator Hitoshi Igarashi was found slain at a university northeast of Tokyo on 12 July 1991. Media Japan has some Urdu language media aimed at Pakistanis, such as the freely distributed Pak Shimbun, as well as other Japanese-language publications targeted towards Muslims at large.

The game was traditionally played on a slab of stone, and the board pattern etched on it. Tukvnanawopi resembles draughts and Alquerque. Each player attempts to capture each other's pieces by hopping over them. It is unknown how old the game is; however, the game was published as early as 1907 in Stewart Culin's book \\"Games of the North American Indians Volume 2: Games of Skill\\". A similar game (with a similar name) also played by the Hopi is Tuknanavuhpi. The only difference is that in Tuknanavuhpi lines of intersection points become unplayable as opposed to rows or columns of squares in Tukvnanawopi when the game progresses. Rule #7 under the Game Play and Rules section elaborates on this. Another similar game is played by the Keres native American tribe in New Mexico called Aiyawatstani. Lastly, the game is also similar to Kharbaga from Africa which may suggest a historical connection.  Goal  The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins.  Equipment  A 4x4 square board is used. Left and right leaning diagonal lines run through each square. This accounts for 41 intersection points. Each player has 20 pieces called \\"pokmoita\\" which means animals. One set of 20 pieces may be black, and the other set of 20 pieces may be white.  Game Play and Rules  1\\\\. Players decide who will start first, and which among them will play the black and white pieces. 2\\\\. Each player's 20 pieces are set up on their half of the board on the intersection points including the middle (5th.) rank specifically the two intersection points to the left of the middle point. The middle point is the only intersection point left vacant in the beginning. 3\\\\. Players alternate their turns. A player may only use one of their own pieces to either move or capture. 4\\\\. On a player's turn, a piece may be moved in any direction along a line onto an adjacent intersection point that is vacant. In the beginning, the first player must bring a piece to the middle point as it is the only vacant intersection point. 5\\\\. Alternatively, a player may use a piece to capture an adjacent enemy piece by leaping over it, as in draughts and Alquerque, and landing on a vacant point immediately beyond. A player can leap an enemy piece from any direction. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. 6\\\\. It is uncertain if captures are compulsory, and whether multiple leaps and captures are allowed since no source specifically mentions it. 7\\\\. When a row or column of squares on one end of the board becomes empty during the course of the game, pieces can no longer be played in that row or column of squares. It is uncertain, however, if the points on the line between the rows or columns of squares can be played upon when one of the rows or columns is empty and unplayable 8\\\\. As the game progresses, another row or column of squares on one end of the board will eventually become empty, and therefore unplayable. The playing area of the board continues to shrink during the course of the game.

During the Middle Ages from the 5th century AD to the 16th century, Western Europe saw a blooming period for the mining industry. The first important mines here were those at Goslar in the Harz mountains, taken into commission in the tenth century. Another famous mining town is Falun in Sweden where copper has been mined since the thirteenth century. The rise of Western European mining industry depended, of course, closely on the increasing weight of Western Europe on the stage of world history. Although the subject has sometimes been overlooked by historians, advances in medieval mining and metallurgy enabled to a large extent the flourishing of Western European civilization. Metallurgical activities were also encouraged by the central political powers, regional authorities, monastic orders and ecclesiastical overlords, who tried to claim royal rights over the mines and a share in the output, both in private lands and regions belonging to the Crown. They were particularly interested in the extraction of the precious metal ores, and for this reason the mines in their territories were open to all miners (Nef 1987, 706-715).  Early Middle Ages, 500-1000 AD  The social, political, economic stagnation and decline that followed the Roman World affected Europe throughout the early medieval period, and had critical impact upon technological progress, trade and social organization. Technological developments that affected the course of metal production were only feasible within a stable political environment, and this was not the case until the 9th century (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, a). During the first medieval centuries, the output of metal was in a steady decline and constraint in small scale activities. Miners adopted methods much less efficient than those of the Roman times. Ores were extracted only from shallow depths or from remnants of former abandoned mines. The vicinity of the mine to villages or towns was also a determinant factor when deciding about working on site, because of the high cost of material transportation (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, b). Apparently only the output of iron diminished less in relation to the other base and precious metals until the 8th century. This fact, correlated with the dramatic decrease in copper production, may indicate a possible displacement of copper and bronze artifacts by iron ones (Forbes 1957, 64; Bayley et al. 2008, 50). By the end of the 9th century, economic and social conditions, that dictated the increased need of metal for agriculture, arms, stirrups and decoration, started to favor metallurgy and a slow but steady general progress was noted. Starting from the reign of the emperor Otto I in the 960s, smelting sites were multiplied. New mines were discovered and exploited, like the well-known Mines of Rammelsberg, close to the town of Goslar in the Harz Mountains. Open-cast mining and metallurgical activities were mostly concentrated in the Eastern Alps, Saxony, Bohemia, Tuscany, the Rhineland, Gaul and Spain (Nef 1987). French, Flemish, but mainly German miners and metallurgists were the generators of metal production.  High Middle Ages, 11th to 13th centuries  Medieval mine on the Bockswieser Gangzug north of Oberschulenberg in Germany. The period right after the 10th century marks the widespread application of several innovations in the field of mining and ore treatment. It marks a shift to large scale and better quality production. Medieval miners, and metallurgists, had to find solutions for the practical problems that limited former metal production, in order to meet the market demands for metals. The increased demand for metal was due to the remarkable population growth from the 11th to the 13th centuries. This growth had impact on agriculture, trade, and building construction, including the great Gothic churches. The main problem was the inefficient means for draining water out of shafts and tunnels in underground mining. This resulted in the flooding of mines which limited the extraction of ore to shallow depths close to the surface. The secondary problem was the separation of the metal bearing minerals from the worthless material that surrounds it, or is closely mixed with it. There was also the difficulty of the transportation of the ore, which resulted in additional high costs. The economic value of mining resulted in investment in the development of solutions to these problems, which had a distinct positive impact on medieval metal output. This included innovations such as water power using waterwheels for powering draining engines, bellows, hammers; or the introduction of advanced types of furnaces. These innovations were not adopted at once, or applied to all mines and smelting sites. Throughout the medieval period these technical innovations, and the traditional techniques, coexisted. Their application depended on the time period, and geographical region. Water power in medieval mining and metallurgy was introduced well before the 11th century, but it was only in the 11th century that it was widely applied. The introduction of the blast furnace, mostly for iron smelting, in all the established centres of metallurgy contributed to quantitative and qualitative improvement of the metal output, making metallic iron available at a lower price. In addition, cupellation, developed in the 8th century, was more often used. It is used for the refinement of lead-silver ores, to separate the silver from the lead (Bayley 2008). Parallel production with more than one technical method, and different treatment of ores would occur wherever multiple ores were present at one site. (Rehren et al. 1999). Underground work in shafts, although limited in depth, was accomplished either by fire-setting for massive ore bodies or with iron tools for smaller scale extraction of limited veins. The sorting of base and precious metal ores was completed underground and they were transferred separately (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, b). Permanent mining in Sweden proper begun in the High Middle Ages and did not spread to Finland until 1530 when the first iron mine was begun operations there. Late Middle Ages, 14th to 16th centuries Beschreibung allerfürnemisten mineralischen Ertzt unnd Bergkwercks Arten (Description of most distinguished kinds of mineral ores and mines) by Lazarus Ercker, 1580 By the 14th century, the majority of the more easily accessible ore deposits were exhausted. Thus, more advanced technological achievements were introduced in order to keep up with the demand in metal. The alchemical laboratory, separating precious metals from the baser ones they are typically found with, was an essential feature of the metallurgical enterprise. However, a significant hiatus in underground mining was noted during the 14th and the early 15th century because of a series of historical events with severe social and economic impacts. The Great Famine (1315–1317), the Black Death (1347–1353), which diminished the European population by one third to one half, and the Hundred Years War (1337–1453) between England and France, that amongst others caused severe deforestation, had also dramatic influences in metallurgical industry and trade. Lead mining, for example, ground to a halt due to the Black Death pandemic, when atmospheric lead pollution from smelting dropped to natural levels (zero) for the first and only time in the last 2000 years. The great demand of metals, e.g. for armour, could not be met due to the lack of manpower and capital investment. It was only by the end of the 13th century that great capital expenditures were invested and more sophisticated machinery was installed in underground mining, which resulted in reaching greater depths. The wider application of water- and horse-power was necessary for draining water out of these deep shafts. Also, acid parting in separating gold from silver was introduced in the 14th century (Bayley 2008). However, notable signs of recovery were present only after the mid-15th century, when the improved methods were widely adopted (Nef 1987, 723). Nevertheless, determinant for the European metal production and trade was the discovery of the New World, which has affected world economy ever since. New rich ore deposits found in Central Europe during the 15th century were dwarfed by the large amounts of precious metal imports from the Americas.  Smiths and miners within medieval society  Metallurgists throughout medieval Europe were free to move within different regions. German metallurgists in search of rich precious metal ores, for instance, took the leading part in mining and affected the course of metal production, not only in East and South Germany but in almost all Central Europe and the Eastern Alps. As mining gradually became a task for specialized craftsmen, miners moved in large groups and they formed settlements with their own customs close to mines. They were always welcomed by the regional authorities since the latter were interested in increasing the revenue and the exploitation of the mineral-rich subsurface was quite profitable. The authorities claimed a part of the output, and smiths and miners were provided with land for cottages, mills, forges, farming, and pasture, and they were allowed to use streams and lumber (Nef 1987, 706-715). Progressing to the high and late Middle Ages, as smelting sites became geographically independent from mines, metalworking was separated from ore smelting. The urban expansion from the 10th century onwards and the dominant role of towns provided metallurgists with the right environment to develop and improve their technology. Metallurgists got organized in guilds and, usually, their workshops were concentrated in town peripheries (McLees 1996). In medieval societies, liberal and mechanical arts were considered as totally different from each other.

It was developed by Winning Moves UK in 2008.http://www.theclinicgame.com - Accessed Nov 26 2008 The Clinic's gameplay is similar to psychological profile quizzes found in magazines, where players answer a series of multiple choice questions and eventually arrive at a set psychological profile at the end.http://www.career-tests-guide.com/fun- personality-quiz.html - Accessed Nov 26 2008 The game's name and theme comes from the UK media obsession with fame, celebrity, and the pressures of being in the spotlight, as illustrated by publications such as Heat (magazine), OK!, Hello!, the London Lite and thelondonpaper. It seeks to play on the notion that any normal person can be thrust into the limelight via reality and talent shows such as Big Brother or The X Factor.  How To Play  The gameplay is designed to encourage discussion and banter over players' questions and answers, many of which are humorous and edgy in nature. Play begins when one player draws a question card from the pile and asks that question of the player to their left, along with the four multiple choice answers. The player gives the answer that they feel best applies. The questioner then looks at the question card to see whether the player has given a Mad, Bad, Sad or Glad answer. The player who has answered then makes an answer on their clipboard in the appropriate section, Mad, Bad, Sad or Glad. Play continues until all players have been asked the set number of questions. At this point, players add up the marks on their clipboard in the four sections, which gives them a tally of Mad, Bad, Sad or Glad. For example, if a player has: Mad: 10 Bad: 5 Sad: 4 Glad: 11 Then their profile will be Glad, Mad, Bad, Sad, or GMBS. Players then look up their profile in the Clinic Analysis Book, which gives them a full psychological profile, including which celebrities they are most like, which celebrity friends they might socialise with, what television shows they might appear on, and a final Clinic Rating which answers the game's opening question of \\"Are You Mad?\\"  Unprofessional Opinion cards  Several of the question cards in The Clinic are Unprofessional Opinion cards. Instead of the player answering these questions, all the other players vote on which answer they think best applies to that player. This leads to further discussion, debate and banter as players try to agree on an answer, and also allows for subterfuge as players can influence the other players' final GBMS tally by voting for a specific answer.

Activities of the colonial missionaries in the ancient city of Zaria forced the royal dynasty of Zaria to request them to move outside the city's ancient walls. The missionaries were given the liberty to select any place of their choice for the continuation of their activities. One of the reasons which informed the decision of the royal family to move the activities of the missionaries outside the city was the conversion of many residents of the Zaria city, including some members of the ruling class, to Christianity. The rulers, then, who were earlier reluctant in relocating the missionaries, found their activities intolerable when some members of the royal family began to accept Christ as their redeemer. This was why Dr. Miller, the head of the missionaries’ team, was asked to go anywhere outside Zaria city to find a convenient place to relocate his school. The missionaries had already built a school and a hospital in the city. Dr. Miller's school was becoming popular with each passing day. The need for space for the expansion of the Miller's school was another reason which forced the movement. When colonial explorers came to Zaria, they first settled in Babban Dodo inside the ancient city. Dr. Miller, who was given the liberty to choose a new settlement, opted for the present Wusasa and the Emir did not hesitate to give him the land to use on loan for 60 years. Before Dr. Miller found Wusasa area, which was then known as Wusa-Wusa, he had visited many places. The head of the missionaries was attracted by the Wusa-Wusa rock. He was said to have met some Wusa-Wusa indigenous hunters who took him round the land. After Dr. Miller had found the area suitable for his activities, the white man, who couldn't pronounce the name Wusa-Wusa, changed the name to his convenience, which is Wusasa. After his royal highness, the then emir of Zazzau Kwasau, and later Sarki Ibrahim, had given them the permission to relocate to Wusasa, the missionaries with some of the Hausa-Fulani early Christians, settled in the area and continued with their evangelism. They built a Church, hospital and school in 1929. The Church is still in the shape the missionary built it in 1929. It is only the roofing that was modified to zinc instead of its original thatch and mud. Some parts of St. Luke's Anglican Hospital, the second prominent hospital in Zaria after ABUTH, are still maintaining their original shape as built in 1929 by the missionaries. The first clay building of the hospital, which consists of three rooms, had however collapsed. The hospital management had continued to retain the relics of the building despite the various expansion and development which took place in the hospital. The coming of Christianity to Zaria and the subsequent founding of Wusasa had its root when in the year 1899; a group of Christian missionaries from Britain came to the Hausaland of Nigeria to establish Christianity. The group of five; Bishop Jugwell, the leader, Dr. Miller, Mr. Burgin, Rev. Dudley Rider and Rev. Richardson came to Nigeria after learning the Hausa language at Tripoli, capital city of Libya, from the Nigerian Hausa pilgrims who usually had a stop-over amidst their foot journey to Mecca. The team of missionaries journeyed from Lagos to Kano. In Kano, the missionaries were turned back by the then authorities. In 1902, the emir of Zazzau Aliyu Kwasau allowed the missionaries to settle in Zaria city. He assigned two locations to them within the city; one was at Durumin Mai- Garke - Babban Dodo - and the other at Kofar Kuyanbana. Dr. Miller became the ordained reverend Minister of the Church. He was ordained in 1922. Dr Miller in conjunction with J.T Umar and P.A Yusufu translated the Holy Bible to Hausa for the benefit of their evangelism of Hausaland and the Zaria area in particular. This historic trend made Wusasa the way it is now where in the same household one can find Muslims and Christians living together as brothers and sisters. Wusasa residents don't discriminate. Apart from attending their different Churches and Mosques, they almost do everything together, celebrate each other's festivities like Sallah and Christmas, attend to each other's naming or wedding ceremonies and mourn together in the event of death or any tragedy. Sometimes a Muslim even marries from a Christian family. The resistance of some original indigenes of Wusasa to accept Christianity is the reason behind the presence of Muslims in Wusasa today, any Christian there that is not Hausa-Fulani came from outside to settle there. The original people, apart from the indigenes, who settled here along with the missionaries, were Hausa-Fulani. All the Chiefs of Wusasa are reporting to the emir of Zazzau. Wusasa has produced many intelligent elites that gave the northern part of the country its place of pride. The first Northern Nigerian medical doctor, I. B. Dikko, was trained in Wusasa. Late Professor Ishaya Audu, Malam Zakari, late Malam John Tafida, Rhoda Mohammed, the first woman Nigeria's ambassador to United Nations, General Yakubu Gowon, former head of state and quite a number of other prominent Nigerians have their roots at Wusasa. Apart from technocrats, Wusasa had produced veteran journalists like the late James Audu, musicians like the late Bala Miller and academicians like Professor Adamu Biki. Notable people *R. A. B.

It is also played in many parts of Mexico. The game was traditionally played on a slab of stone with the board pattern etched on it. Tukvnanawopi resembles draughts and Alquerque. Players attempt to capture each other's pieces by hopping over them. It is not known when the game was first played; however, the game was published as early as 1907 in Stewart Culin's book Games of the North American Indians Volume 2: Games of Skill. A similar game (with a similar name) also played by the Hopi is Tukvnanawopi. The only differences are that in Tuknanavuhpi lines of intersection points become unplayable as opposed to rows or columns of squares in Tukvnanawopi, and that in Tukvnanawopi there can be two or four players. (A more elaborate description is provided in the Game Play and Rules section.) Another similar game called Aiyawatstani is played by the Keres Native American tribe in New Mexico. Additionally, the game is also similar to Kharbaga from Africa, which may suggest a historical connection. Objective The object of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces. The player who does so wins. Equipment The initial state of the board. A 5×5 square board is used. Left and right leaning diagonal lines run through each square. This accounts for 41 intersection points. Each player has 20 pieces called pokmoita, which means animals. Each set of 20 pieces is discernible from the other, generally by color. The design of pieces varies, with common variants including grains of maize or black and white stones. Gameplay and rules #Players decide who will play with which color pieces. White (or the lighter of two colors) goes first. #Each player's 20 pieces are set up on his or her half of the board on the intersection points including the middle (fifth) rank, specifically the two intersection points to the left of the middle point. The middle point is the only intersection point left vacant in the beginning. #Players alternate their turns. Each turn consists of a player selecting just one of his or her pieces and performing either a single move or one or more captures. A player may not perform both a move and a capture in a single turn. #A move consists of relocating a piece from one intersection point along a line in any direction to an adjacent intersection point, so long as the destination intersection point is vacant. At the start of play, the first player must move a piece to the middle point as it is the only vacant intersection point. After performing a move, the player's turn is over. #A capture consists of a player using a piece to \\"hop\\" over an opponent's piece that lies on an adjacent intersection point in any direction, and \\"landing\\" on a vacant intersection point along that same line and immediately proceeding the hopped-over opponent's piece. The piece that is hopped over is thus captured and removed from the board. Only one piece may be hopped over at a time. If, after performing a capture, the player is able to make another capture using the same piece and without having to execute a move, he or she may do so, and may continue to do so until no further capture opportunities are available for that piece, at which point the turn ends. #Although it is the object of the game to capture all of an opponent's pieces, executing a particular capture — while it may be legally possible — may prove strategically unwise. There is no indication from available sources that performing a capture is required simply because it is executable. However, it would appear that during one's turn, one must perform at least one legal action, whether a move or a capture. \\"The player who goes first moves a piece into the empty space and the opponent jumps over and captures it.\\" Because the only legal action to start the game is a move, the first player must do so. Because the only legal action the opponent may follow with is a capture, he or she must do so. #When a line of intersection points (row or column) on one end of the board becomes empty during the course of the game, pieces can no longer be played on that line of intersection points. It is uncertain, however, if a row or column of intersections points within a row or column of squares is considered to be a \\"line of intersection points\\". No specific source clarifies this for now. #As the game progresses, another line of intersection points (row or column) on one end of the board will eventually become empty, and therefore unplayable. The playing area of the board continues to shrink during the course of the game.

It is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the brain, typically from low blood pressure. There are sometimes symptoms before the loss of consciousness such as lightheadedness, sweating, pale skin, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or feeling warm. Syncope may also be associated with a short episode of muscle twitching. When consciousness and muscle strength are not completely lost, it is called presyncope. It is recommended that presyncope be treated the same as syncope. Causes range from non-serious to potentially fatal. There are three broad categories of causes: heart or blood vessel related; reflex, also known as neurally mediated; and orthostatic hypotension. Issues with the heart and blood vessels are the cause in about 10% and typically the most serious while neurally mediated is the most common. Heart related causes may include an abnormal heart rhythm, problems with the heart valves or heart muscle and blockages of blood vessels from a pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection among others. Neurally mediated syncope occurs when blood vessels expand and heart rate decreases inappropriately. This may occur from either a triggering event such as exposure to blood, pain, strong feelings or a specific activity such as urination, vomiting, or coughing. Neurally mediated syncope may also occur when an area in the neck known as the carotid sinus is pressed. The third type of syncope is due to a drop in blood pressure when changing position such as when standing up. This is often due to medications that a person is taking but may also be related to dehydration, significant bleeding or infection. There also seems to be a genetic component to syncope. A medical history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) are the most effective ways to determine the underlying cause. The ECG is useful to detect an abnormal heart rhythm, poor blood flow to the heart muscle and other electrical issues, such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. Heart related causes also often have little history of a prodrome. Low blood pressure and a fast heart rate after the event may indicate blood loss or dehydration, while low blood oxygen levels may be seen following the event in those with pulmonary embolism. More specific tests such as implantable loop recorders, tilt table testing or carotid sinus massage may be useful in uncertain cases. Computed tomography (CT) is generally not required unless specific concerns are present. Other causes of similar symptoms that should be considered include seizure, stroke, concussion, low blood oxygen, low blood sugar, drug intoxication and some psychiatric disorders among others. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Those who are considered at high risk following investigation may be admitted to hospital for further monitoring of the heart. Syncope affects about three to six out of every thousand people each year. It is more common in older people and females. It is the reason for one to three percent of visits to emergency departments and admissions to hospital. Up to half of women over the age of 80 and a third of medical students describe at least one event at some point in their lives. Of those presenting with syncope to an emergency department, about 4% died in the next 30 days. The risk of a poor outcome, however, depends very much on the underlying cause. Causes Causes range from non-serious to potentially fatal. There are three broad categories of causes: heart or blood vessel related; reflex, also known as neurally mediated; and orthostatic hypotension. Issues with the heart and blood vessels are the cause in about 10% and typically the most serious while neurally mediated is the most common. There also seems to be a genetic component to syncope. A resent genetic studie has identified first risk locus for syncope and collapse. The lead genetic variant, residing at chromosome 2q31.1, is an intergenic variant approximately 250 kb downstream of the ZNF804A gene. The variant effected the expression of ZNF804A, making this gene the mostly driver of the association .  Neurally mediated syncope  Reflex syncope or neurally mediated syncope occurs when blood vessels expand and heart rate decreases inappropriately leading to poor blood flow to the brain. This may occur from either a triggering event such as exposure to blood, pain, strong feelings or a specific activity such as urination, vomiting, or coughing. Vasovagal syncope Vasovagal (situational) syncope is one of the most common types which may occur in response to any of a variety of triggers, such as scary, embarrassing or uneasy situations, during blood drawing, or moments of sudden unusually high stress. There are many different syncope syndromes which all fall under the umbrella of vasovagal syncope related by the same central mechanism. First, the person is usually predisposed to decreased blood pressure by various environmental factors. A lower than expected blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Or heat causing vaso-dilation and worsening the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, needle phobia), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirements because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. A feedback response to the medulla is triggered via the afferent vagus nerve. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is thereby modulated by vagal (parasympathetic) outflow leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response causing loss of blood flow to the brain. The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack. Avoiding what brings on the syncope and possibly greater salt intake is often all that is needed. Associated symptoms may be felt in the minutes leading up to a vasovagal episode and are referred to as the prodrome. These consist of light- headedness, confusion, pallor, nausea, salivation, sweating, tachycardia, blurred vision, and sudden urge to defecate among other symptoms. Vasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms: *Isolated episodes of loss of consciousness, unheralded by any warning symptoms for more than a few moments. These tend to occur in the adolescent age group and may be associated with fasting, exercise, abdominal straining, or circumstances promoting vaso- dilation (e.g., heat, alcohol). The subject is invariably upright. The tilt- table test, if performed, is generally negative. *Recurrent syncope with complex associated symptoms. This is neurally mediated syncope (NMS). It is associated with any of the following: preceding or succeeding sleepiness, preceding visual disturbance (\\"spots before the eyes\\"), sweating, lightheadedness. The subject is usually but not always upright. The tilt-table test, if performed, is generally positive. It is relatively uncommon. Syncope has been linked with psychological triggers. This includes fainting in response to the sight or thought of blood, needles, pain, and other emotionally stressful situations. One theory in evolutionary psychology is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of playing dead which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment. \\"Blood-injury phobia\\", as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people. It is often possible to manage these symptoms with specific behavioral techniques. Another evolutionary psychology view is that some forms of fainting are non-verbal signals that developed in response to increased inter-group aggression during the paleolithic. A non- combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in blood-injection-injury type phobias such as needle phobia as well as the gender differences. Much of this pathway was discovered in animal experiments by Bezold (Vienna) in the 1860s. In animals, it may represent a defence mechanism when confronted by danger (\\"playing possum\\"). Situational syncope Syncope may be caused by specific behaviors including coughing, urination, defecation, vomiting, swallowing (deglutition), and following exercise. Manisty et al. note: \\"Deglutition syncope is characterised by loss of consciousness on swallowing; it has been associated not only with ingestion of solid food, but also with carbonated and ice-cold beverages, and even belching.\\" Fainting can occur in \\"cough syncope\\" following severe fits of coughing, such as that associated with pertussis or \\"whooping cough.\\" Neurally mediated syncope may also occur when an area in the neck known as the carotid sinus is pressed. A normal response to carotid sinus massage is reduction in blood pressure and slowing of the heart rate. Especially in people with hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome this response can cause syncope or presyncope.  Cardiac  Heart related causes may include an abnormal heart rhythm, problems with the heart valves or heart muscle and blockages of blood vessels from a pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection among others.Syncope from bradycardia. Cardiac arrhythmias The most common cause of cardiac syncope is cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) wherein the heart beats too slowly, too rapidly, or too irregularly to pump enough blood to the brain. Some arrhythmias can be life-threatening. Two major groups of arrhythmias are bradycardia and tachycardia. Bradycardia can be caused by heart blocks. Tachycardias include SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and VT (ventricular tachycardia). SVT does not cause syncope except in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Ventricular tachycardia originate in the ventricles. VT causes syncope and can result in sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia, which describes a heart rate of over 100 beats per minute with at least three irregular heartbeats as a sequence of consecutive premature beats, can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, which is rapidly fatal without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. Long QT syndrome can cause syncope when it sets off ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes. The degree of QT prolongation determines the risk of syncope. Brugada syndrome also commonly presents with syncope secondary to arrhythmia. Typically, tachycardic-generated syncope is caused by a cessation of beats following a tachycardic episode. This condition, called tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, is usually caused by sinoatrial node dysfunction or block or atrioventricular block. Obstructive cardiac lesion Blockages in major vessels or within the heart can also impede blood flow to the brain. Aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis are the most common examples. Major valves of the heart become stiffened and reduce the efficiency of the hearts pumping action. This may not cause symptoms at rest but with exertion, the heart is unable to keep up with increased demands leading to syncope. Aortic stenosis presents with repeated episodes of syncope. Rarely, cardiac tumors such as atrial myxomas can also lead to syncope. Structural cardiopulmonary disease Diseases involving the shape and strength of the heart can be a cause of reduced blood flow to the brain, which increases risk for syncope. The most common cause in this category is fainting associated with an acute myocardial infarction or ischemic event. The faint in this case is primarily caused by an abnormal nervous system reaction similar to the reflex faints. Women are significantly more likely to experience syncope as a presenting symptom of a myocardial infarction. In general, faints caused by structural disease of the heart or blood vessels are particularly important to recognize, as they are warning of potentially life-threatening conditions. Among other conditions prone to trigger syncope (by either hemodynamic compromise or by a neural reflex mechanism, or both), some of the most important are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, acute aortic dissection, pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, aortic stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Other cardiac causes Sick sinus syndrome, a sinus node dysfunction, causing alternating bradycardia and tachycardia. Often there is a long pause (asystole) between heartbeats. Adams-Stokes syndrome is a cardiac syncope that occurs with seizures caused by complete or incomplete heart block. Symptoms include deep and fast respiration, weak and slow pulse and respiratory pauses that may last for 60 seconds. Subclavian steal syndrome arises from retrograde (reversed) flow of blood in the vertebral artery or the internal thoracic artery, due to a proximal stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery. Symptoms such as syncope, lightheadedness, and paresthesias occur while exercising the arm on the affected side (most commonly the left). Aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta) and cardiomyopathy can also result in syncope. Various medications, such as beta blockers, may cause bradycardia induced syncope. A pulmonary embolism can cause obstructed blood vessels and is the cause of syncope in less than 1% of people who present to the emergency department. Blood pressure Orthostatic (postural) hypotensive syncope is caused primarily by an excessive drop in blood pressure when standing up from a previous position of lying or sitting down. When the head is elevated above the feet the pull of gravity causes blood pressure in the head to drop. This is sensed by stretch receptors in the walls of vessels in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. These receptors then trigger a sympathetic nervous response to compensate and redistribute blood back into the brain. The sympathetic response causes peripheral vasoconstriction and increased heart rate. These together act to raise blood pressure back to baseline. Apparently healthy individuals may experience minor symptoms (\\"lightheadedness\\", \\"greying-out\\") as they stand up if blood pressure is slow to respond to the stress of upright posture. If the blood pressure is not adequately maintained during standing, faints may develop. However, the resulting \\"transient orthostatic hypotension\\" does not necessarily signal any serious underlying disease. It is as common or perhaps even more common than vasovagal syncope. This may be due to medications, dehydration, significant bleeding or infection. The most susceptible individuals are elderly frail individuals, or persons who are dehydrated from hot environments or inadequate fluid intake. For example, medical students would be at risk for orthostatic hypotensive syncope while observing long surgeries in the operating room. There is also evidence that exercise training can help reduce orthostatic intolerance. More serious orthostatic hypotension is often the result of certain commonly prescribed medications such as diuretics, β-adrenergic blockers, other anti-hypertensives (including vasodilators), and nitroglycerin. In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the autonomic nervous system due to systemic diseases (e.g., amyloidosis or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension refers to an orthostatic drop in blood pressure despite high levels of sympathetic adrenergic response. This occurs when a people with normal physiology is unable to compensate for >20% loss in intravascular volume. This may be due to blood loss, dehydration or third- spacing. On standing the person will experience reflex tachycardia (at least 20% increased over supine) and a drop in blood pressure. Hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension occurs when the person is unable to sustain a normal sympathetic response to blood pressure changes during movement despite adequate intravascular volume. There is little to no compensatory increase in heart rate or blood pressure when standing for up to 10 minutes. This is often due to an underlying disorder or medication use and is accompanied by other hypoadrenergic signs. Central nervous system ischemia The central ischemic response is triggered by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood in the brain. Common examples include strokes and transient ischemic attacks. While these conditions often impair consciousness they rarely meet the medical definition of syncope. Vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks may produce true syncope as a symptom. The respiratory system may compensate for dropping oxygen levels through hyperventilation, though a sudden ischemic episode may also proceed faster than the respiratory system can respond. These processes cause the typical symptoms of fainting: pale skin, rapid breathing, nausea and weakness of the limbs, particularly of the legs. If the ischemia is intense or prolonged, limb weakness progresses to collapse. The weakness of the legs causes most people to sit or lie down if there is time to do so. This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow. An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode. This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders. Vertebro-basilar arterial disease Arterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain that causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply. This may occur with extending the neck or with use of medications to lower blood pressure. Other causes There are other conditions which may cause or resemble syncope. Seizures and syncope can be difficult to differentiate. Both often present as sudden loss of consciousness and convulsive movements may be present or absent in either. Movements in syncope are typically brief and more irregular than seizures. Akinetic seizures can present with sudden loss of postural tone without associated tonic-clonic movements. Absence of a long post-ictal state is indicative of syncope rather than an akinetic seizure. Subarachnoid hemorrhage may result in syncope. Often this is in combination with sudden, severe headache. It may occur as a result of a ruptured aneurysm or head trauma. Heat syncope occurs when heat exposure causes decreased blood volume and peripheral vasodilatation. Position changes, especially during vigorous exercise in the heat, may lead to decreased blood flow to the brain. Closely related to other causes of syncope related to hypotension (low blood pressure) such as orthostatic syncope. Some psychological conditions (anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder) may cause symptoms resembling syncope. A number of psychological interventions are available. Low blood sugar can be a rare cause of syncope. Narcolepsy may present with sudden loss of consciousness similar to syncope. Diagnostic approach A medical history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) are the most effective ways to determine the underlying cause of syncope. Guidelines from the American College of Emergency Physicians and American Heart Association recommend a syncope workup include a thorough medical history, physical exam with orthostatic vitals, and a 12-lead ECG. The ECG is useful to detect an abnormal heart rhythm, poor blood flow to the heart muscle and other electrical issues, such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. Heart related causes also often have little history of a prodrome. Low blood pressure and a fast heart rate after the event may indicate blood loss or dehydration, while low blood oxygen levels may be seen following the event in those with pulmonary embolism. Routine broad panel laboratory testing detects abnormalities in <2–3% of results and is therefore not recommended. Based on this initial workup many physicians will tailor testing and determine whether a person qualifies as ‘high-risk’, ‘intermediate risk’ or ‘low-risk’ based on risk stratification tools. More specific tests such as implantable loop recorders, tilt table testing or carotid sinus massage may be useful in uncertain cases. Computed tomography (CT) is generally not required unless specific concerns are present. Other causes of similar symptoms that should be considered include seizure, stroke, concussion, low blood oxygen, low blood sugar, drug intoxication and some psychiatric disorders among others. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Those who are considered at high risk following investigation may be admitted to hospital for further monitoring of the heart. A hemoglobin count may indicate anemia or blood loss. However, this has been useful in only about 5% of people evaluated for fainting.Grubb (2001) p. 83 The tilt table test is performed to elicit orthostatic syncope secondary to autonomic dysfunction (neurogenic). A number of factors make a heart related cause more likely including age over 35, prior atrial fibrillation, and turning blue during the event. Electrocardiogram Electrocardiogram (ECG) finds that should be looked for include signs of heart ischemia, arrhythmias, atrioventricular blocks, a long QT, a short PR, Brugada syndrome, signs of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), and signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD/C). Signs of HCM include large voltages in the precordial leads, repolarization abnormalities, and a wide QRS with a slurred upstroke. Signs of ARVD/C include T wave inversion and epsilon waves in lead V1 to V3. It is estimated that from 20–50% of people have an abnormal ECG. However, while an ECG may identify conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart block, or a new or old heart attack, it typically does not provide a definite diagnosis for the underlying cause for fainting.Grubb (2001) pp. 83–84 Sometimes, a Holter monitor may be used. This is a portable ECG device that can record the wearer's heart rhythms during daily activities over an extended period of time. Since fainting usually does not occur upon command, a Holter monitor can provide a better understanding of the heart's activity during fainting episodes. For people with more than two episodes of syncope and no diagnosis on “routine testing”, an insertable cardiac monitor might be used. It lasts 28–36 months and is inserted just beneath the skin in the upper chest area.

For people with uncomplicated syncope (without seizures and a normal neurological exam) computed tomography or MRI is not generally needed. Likewise, using carotid ultrasonography on the premise of identifying carotid artery disease as a cause of syncope also is not indicated., which cites: #* #* #* Although sometimes investigated as a cause of syncope, carotid artery problems are unlikely to cause that condition. Additionally an electroencephalogram (EEG) is generally not recommended. A bedside ultrasound may be performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm in people with concerning history or presentation. Differential diagnosis Other diseases which mimic syncope include seizure, low blood sugar, and certain types of stroke. While these may appear as \\"fainting\\", they do not fit the strict definition of syncope being a sudden reversible loss of consciousness due to decreased blood flow to the brain. Management Management of syncope focuses on treating the underlying cause. This can be challenging as the underlying cause is unclear in half of all cases. Several risk stratification tools (explained below) have been developed to combat the vague nature of this diagnosis. People with an abnormal ECG reading, history of congestive heart failure, family history of sudden cardiac death, shortness of breath, HCT<30, hypotension or evidence of bleeding should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and monitoring. Low-risk cases of vasovagal or orthostatic syncope in younger people with no significant cardiac history, no family history of sudden unexplained death, and a normal EKG and initial evaluation may be candidates for discharge to follow-up with their primary care provider. Recommended acute treatment of vasovagal and orthostatic (hypotension) syncope involves returning blood to the brain by positioning the person on the ground, with legs slightly elevated or sitting leaning forward and the head between the knees for at least 10–15 minutes, preferably in a cool and quiet place. For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting. At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell. After the symptoms have passed, sleep is recommended. Lifestyle modifications are important for treating people experiencing repeated syncopal episodes. Avoiding triggers and situations where loss of consciousness would be seriously hazardous (operating heavy machinery, commercial pilot, etc.) has been shown to be effective. If fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease. In the case where syncope is caused by cardiac disease, the treatment is much more sophisticated than that of vasovagal syncope and may involve pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators depending on the precise cardiac cause.  Risk tools  The San Francisco syncope rule was developed to isolate people who have higher risk for a serious cause of syncope. High risk is anyone who has: congestive heart failure, hematocrit <30%, electrocardiograph abnormality, shortness of breath, or systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg. The San Francisco syncope rule however was not validated by subsequent studies. The Canadian syncope risk score was developed to help select low-risk people that may be viable for discharge home. A score of <0 on the Canadian syncope risk score is associated with <2% risk of serious adverse event within 30 days. It has been shown to be more effective than older syncope risk scores even combined with cardiac biomarkers at predicting adverse events.  Epidemiology  There are 18.1–39.7 syncope episodes per 1000 people in the general population. Rates are highest between the ages of 10–30 years old. This is likely because of the high rates of vasovagal syncope in the young adult population. Older adults are more likely to have orthostatic or cardiac syncope. Syncope affects about three to six out of every thousand people each year. It is more common in older people and females. It is the reason for 2–5% of visits to emergency departments and admissions to hospital. Up to half of women over the age of 80 and a third of medical students describe at least one event at some point in their lives.  Prognosis  Of those presenting with syncope to an emergency department, about 4% died in the next 30 days. The risk of a poor outcome, however, depends very much on the underlying cause. Situational syncope is not at increased risk of death or adverse outcomes. Cardiac syncope is associated with worse prognosis compared to noncardiac syncope. Factors associated with poor outcomes include history of heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, ECG abnormalities, palpitations, signs of hemorrhage, syncope during exertion, and advanced age. Society and culture Fainting in women was a commonplace trope or stereotype in Victorian England and in contemporary and modern depictions of the period. Syncope and presyncope are common in young athletes. In 1990 the American college basketball player Hank Gathers suddenly collapsed and died during a televised intercollegiate basketball game. He had previously collapsed during a game a few months prior. He was diagnosed with exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia at the time. There was speculation that he had since stopped taking the prescribed medications on game days. Falling-out is a culture-bound syndrome primarily reported in the southern United States and the Caribbean. Some individuals occasionally or frequently play the \\"fainting game\\" (also referred to in the US as the \\"choking game\\"), which involves the deliberate induction of syncope via voluntary restriction of blood flow to the brain, an action that can result in acute or cumulative brain damage and even death.  Etymology  The term is derived from the Late Latin syncope, from Ancient Greek συγκοπή (sunkopē) 'cutting up', 'sudden loss of strength', from σύν (sun, \\"together, thoroughly\\") and κόπτειν (koptein, \\"strike, cut off\\").

Background  The Big Pitch was launched on 6 December 2007 and was open for 10 weeks. Over 200 projects applied for the scheme including multi-award-winning filmmakers from around the UK. After thorough assessment of the applications a longlist of 30 was drawn up before 12 teams were invited for interview. After interviews the Moxie Panel selected 8 projects to enter The Big Pitch Training Programme based on talent, experience, marketability and quality.http://visionandmedia.co.uk/page/the-big-pitch:-call-for-entries The Big Pitch Training Programme kicked off with an intensive four-day induction and development workshop at the end of April. The workshop gave a structured overview of micro-budget feature film development and production with recognized industry experts speaking on their relevant areas of expertise. Whilst the eight teams were at the workshop to learn, they were also competing for just six places on the four-month development programme. Following the workshop the teams then had three weeks to devise and deliver their project development plans in advance of the next elimination meeting in Cannes Film Festival on 16 May 2008. The Panel reconvened to eliminate two projects based on the strength of the projects and their progress during and after the workshop. The panel consisted of Christine Alderson and Hayley Manning (Moxie Makers), Lorianne Hall (Ipso Facto Films), Eve Gabereau (Soda Pictures), Mark Vennis (Moviehouse Entertainment) and Denise Parkinson (Bauer Media). The six selected projects then spent four-months working to perfect their project and presentation as a whole. They worked with feedback from: a project mentor, a script editor, a poster/marketing pack designer, a casting director, a UK distributor and an international sales agent. On 17 October 2008, the panel convened and made the final selection based on script quality, marketing plan, poster concept, UK Box Office potential, International potential, Awards Prospects and the applicants ability to deliver.  The Finalists  Four teams reached the final. Audiences were encouraged to vote online for their favourite project by visiting The Big Pitch website. Voting opened on Wednesday 19 November 2008 and closed on the day of the final.https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/U8326926.  The Final  The competition final took place in conjunction with Northern Lights Film Festival, which is held annually in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.http://www.nlff.co.uk/2007/future/thebigpitch.php On 6 December 2008, at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, the four finalists appeared on stage and had fifteen minutes to convince a live audience that their film should be made. The footage was filmed and available to download after the event. Once the final team presented the audience votes were counted and the winner was announced at the awards ceremony that same evening. After all the votes were counted it was announced that there were literally just a few votes separating first and second place. Second place went to Derek Boyes' neo-noir thriller Blackout but the winners of The Big Pitch 08/09 with their psychological thriller Different Shades of Graham were Keith Lynch, David Lynch, Brad Watson and Simon Thomas. Different Shades of Graham was produced during 2009 and premiered at the Northern Lights Film Festival 2009.

The film is set in his home city, Glasgow, Scotland. The young actors in film were members of the Glasgow Youth Theatre. The film also features Richard Demarco, the Edinburgh gallery owner, playing himself. The four main actors went on to feature in Forsyth's following film Gregory's Girl. Plot Ronnie (Robert Buchanan), Wal (Billy Greenlees), Andy (John Gordon Sinclair) and Vic (John Hughes) are four bored, unemployed teenagers from Glasgow. One day, Ronnie comes up with the idea of stealing stainless steel sinks from a warehouse and selling them. Their plan involves dressing up as girls and using a chemical 'stop-motion' potion.

So I asked the teenagers at a Glasgow community center if they would appear in my movie at no pay. Actually, I promised them points in the film (a percentage of any profits).\\" Locations Filming took place on location around the city of Glasgow; scenes featured locations such as Kelvingrove Park, Dennistoun, Springburn and Bishopbriggs railway stations, Cowcaddens, Sighthill and the Butney in Maryhill. Dubbed soundtrack The film was released in the United States four years after the United Kingdom, following the success of Gregory's Girl and Local Hero. For the American market, (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) the soundtrack was re-dubbed using more mainstream accents from Edinburgh. The MGM version cost more to re-dub than the entire budget for the film itself. Reception In 1987 Forsyth said the film earned $90,000, \\"and we still haven't seen any profit from it.\\" Philip French, writing in The Guardian, described the premiere of That Sinking Feeling as 'Among the happiest surprises of my years as a movie critic', writing that the arrival of the film marked Bill Forsyth as a 'major new talent'. Vincent Canby, in The New York Times wrote that ' That Sinking Feeling doesn't have quite the panache of Gregory's Girl and Local Hero' but nonetheless praised it as 'amiable', 'funny' and 'gentle'. A review in Empire gave That Sinking Feeling four stars out of five, calling it 'funnier, meaner and less wistful than [Forsyth's] subsequent successes'. DVD release In September 2009, a restored copy of the film was re-released on DVD by 2 Entertain. This has generated controversy however due to the use of the re-dubbed soundtrack, which had the effect of impinging upon the delivery of the dialogue and character of the film. The British Film Institute, through their Flipside arm, released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on 21 April 2014, with the original Glaswegian dialogue track restored. This release also featured an audio commentary by Bill Forsyth and critic Mark Kermode, as well as other short films Forsyth was involved with.

The Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCH) is responsible for Richmond Health Services and Richmond Hospital. History Richmond Hospital first opened February 26, 1966 with 132 beds, and was first known as Richmond General Hospital. The first patient was admitted and the first baby was born in the hospital on March 17, 1966. The original building is now known as the \\"North Tower\\"; the \\"South Tower\\" was completed in 1980. In 1992 Richmond General Hospital was rebranded as \\"The Richmond Hospital\\" while the Minoru Residence extended care facility was opened two years later. In 1997 the Westminster Health Centre building was opened to house administration, psychiatry and ambulatory care. The same year the hospital was amalgamated with the Vancouver/Richmond Health Board. In 1999, due to space opened up by opening the Westminster building, the Emergency Department and Diagnostic Imaging were considerably expanded. The Vancouver/Richmond Health Board was re-structured to become part of the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, which includes \\"Richmond Health Services\\" as the local umbrella organization. The hospital is currently part of Richmond Health Services and now known simply as \\"Richmond Hospital\\" (without the preceding \\"The\\"). Facilities and amenities Richmond Hospital Richmond Hospital is the only hospital in Richmond, British Columbia, and is a large community hospital with 200 beds serving the needs of residents in Richmond, Delta, as well as travelers using the Vancouver International Airport and BC Ferries. It is a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of British Columbia. The Emergency Department is classified as a Level 3 trauma centre, opens 24/7, and sees more than 50,000 patients annually. The hospital can provide most of the medical and surgical care for its patients. Some patients requiring highly specialized care would need to be transferred to tertiary care facilities in Vancouver. Richmond Hospital has transfer agreements and policies with Vancouver General Hospital, St. Paul's Hospital, British Columbia's Children's Hospital, and BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre. In addition to an established inpatient psychiatry unit and outpatient psychiatry services, a Psychiatric Emergency Unit was completed in March 2009 for short-term admission of psychiatric patients in crisis. In September 2009, the new $6.5 million birth centre opened.\\"Hospital celebrates birth of new maternity centre\\", Richmond Review, September 11, 2009. It features 15 private maternity care rooms, a six-bed Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and a maternity-specific operating room and recovery area. On April 8, 2009 the provincial government announced a $10 million upgrade package for RH. These renovations were completed in April, 2011 and include a expansion and upgrade to the Emergency Department ($4.9 million), expansion of ambulatory surgical services ($2.9 million) and an expansion and upgrade of the Sterile Processing Department ($2.4 million). Non-medical amenities and enhancements include a large atrium inside the main entrance where one can find a Starbucks and a gift shop. There is a cafeteria on the second floor. There are several well-maintained gardens on the hospital property. The hospital is right beside Minoru Park which has many footpaths, trees and several small lakes. In April, 2014, work began on a $2 million renovation to the atrium area inside the main hospital entrance. It is funded almost entirely by the Milan and Maureen Ilich Foundation and scheduled for completion in August, 2014. The Westminster Health Centre building and the renovated atrium area will be renamed the Milan Ilich Pavilion. The reconfigured space will become a hub for information and services and include a new admitting desk, a dedicated family and patient centre and a simpler way- finding strategy. There will even be an expansion of the existing Starbucks outlet. During the COVID-19 pandemic, parking at Richmond Hospital became free for staff and visitors starting April 1, 2020.  Future Expansion plans  In March 2018, the ministry announced a new acute-care building for the hospital. The new building shall include more beds and alleviate the concerns that the original building shall collapse due to seismic activity. In July 2020, the province announced that the building will be bigger then the one announced in 2018. In addition to the acute tower, it shall include an expanded emergency room, ICU, pharmacy, pediatric unit, and surgical suit. It will also add 113 new beds. Completion of the business plan for the project is expected in September 2020, with construction starting soon after. It is due to open 2024.

Later models were also called the Mazda Hydrogen RE Plug in Hybrid. The first car was unveiled in 2005, with an improved version shown at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. Mazda planned for the car to enter production and leased a few cars to end users in 2009 in 2010. Background Mazda launched its first hydrogen-powered concept car, the HR-X, in 1991. The car was followed by other models, refining their technology over the following decade until the Mazda RX-8 Hydrogen RE of 2003. This car was the first hydrogen-powered rotary-engined vehicle to be offered on a commercial lease in Japan and was used in the Norwgian HyNor project to demonstrate the viability of hydrogen as a vehicle fuel. Design 2005 model Realising the limitations of these smaller vehicles, Mazda developed a hydrogen vehicle based on the successful Premacy compact MPV. Mazda had previously produced the prototype Premacy FCEV in 2001 but this had been powered by a fuel cell. The new model was different and was designed to demonstrate a vehicle that could make hydrogen power mainstream. The drivetrain was taken from the Mazda RX-8 Hydrogen RE but had a 40% increase in power and increased range. Power was provided by a two rotor REGENESIS Wankel engine of capacity combined with a electric motor. Energy was stored in a petrol tank, hydrogen storage tank and nickel metal hydride battery, and the front mounted engine drove the front wheels. The battery was recharged by regenerative braking and provided some power to increase acceleration as in a mild hybrid. Internally, the car was equipped with three rows of seats, with the additional components, including the electric motor and hydrogen storage tanks having limited impact on the internal space. The car was first unveiled at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show, with a vision to be in showrooms by 2008. 2007 model An improved version was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. This vehicle had a range of different features, not least that although motors were still mounted at the front, drive was to the rear. Similarly, rather than use a gearbox, drive was through the electric motor, creating a series hybrid vehicle drivetrain. The hydrogen tank stored hydrogen at , while the petrol tank had a capacity of . While running on hydrogen, the Wankel engine produced and up to torque at 5000 rpm. While running on petrol, the engine produced and torque at the same engine speed. The battery was also updated to a lithium model and power increased to . The battery was not designed to be a major energy source, providing limited range, but the car was fitted with an external plug for recharging. Performance The 2007 car was capable of a maximum speed of and could accelerate to in 10 seconds. It had a claimed range of on hydrogen and on petrol. Production The car was produced in small numbers for demonstration in Japan. The first lease for a Premacy Hydrogen RE Hybrid started in March 2009. The first car was delivered to Iwatani Corporation on 26 May 2009. By January 2010, the company had leased five vehicles to end users.

In 1961, it was classified as a monument historique. History First building The amphitheatre was built at the foot of the La Croix-Rousse hill at what was then the confluence of the Rhône and Saône . An inscription on one of the blocks found in 1957 (Inscription latine des Trois Gaules, n°217 (AE 1959, n°61)) connects the amphitheatre with the sanctuary of Rome and Augustus and allows its origins to be identified : [...] [...] [...] Which can be completed as :[... :For the safety of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, C. Julius Rufus, citizen of the city of Santons (Saintes), priest of Rome and of Augustus, [and Caius Julius ?...] his son and grandson built this amphitheatre and its podium at their own expense. This dates the building to 19 A.D. The figures who financed its construction belonged to an old Gallic family in Saintes which had held Roman citizenship since the Gallic Wars and also built the arch of Germanicus there. The curious formula \\"filii f(ilius)\\" perhaps derives from a wish to affirm the antiquity and continuity of the family's lineage, as on the arch of Germanicus, which names Rufus's ancestors. Other stones bear the names of Gallic tribes (Arverni, Tricasses, Bituriges) confirming its identification as federal sanctuary. Excavations have revealed a basement of three elliptical walls linked by cross-walls and a channel surrounding the oval central arena. The arena was slightly sloped, with the building's south part supported by a now-vanished vault. The arena's dimensions are 67.6m by 42m, analogous to those at the arenas at Nîmes and Arles, though with a smaller number of rows of seats (probably only 4 levels) that gave the amphitheatre external dimensions of 81m by 60m (much smaller than those of Nîmes, which was 133m by 101m). This phase of the amphitheatre housed games which accompanied the imperial cult, with its low capacity (1,800 seats) being enough for delegations from the 60 Gallic tribes. Expansion Stele of the Amphitheatre of the Three Gauls The amphitheatre was expanded at the start of the 2nd century, according to J. Guey by C. Julius Celse, procurator of Gallia Lugdunensis from 130 to 136. Two galleries were added around the old amphitheatre, raising its width from 25 metres to 105 metres and its capacity to about 20,000 seats (though this was still modest compared to the amphitheatres at Nîmes and Arles). In so doing it made it a building open to the whole population of Lugdunum and its environs. Historians identify the building as the site of Saints Blandina and Pothinus's martyrdoms as part of the persecution in 177 and a post in the middle of the arena commemorates this event and Pope John-Paul II's visit to Lyon in 1986. Rediscovery A 16th century plan of Lyon indicates the survival to that date of some arches (probably substructures) and a hollow (the arena) known as \\"Corbeille de la Déserte\\". The first excavations between 1818 and 1820 revealed the perimeter of the arena before re-covering it, allowing urban expansion in the 19th century to destroy the south half of the amphitheatre remains. From 1956 serious excavations were begun, followed by 1966/67, 1971/72 and 1976/78 campaigns, leading to the exposed remains on show today. The modest remains which had survived (the supporting walls for half of the amphitheatre's superstructure) were integrated into the Jardin des Plantes and opened to visitors.

He was a member of the South Australian team which won the Sheffield Shield in 1963/64. A right- handed top order batsman, Lill was good enough to tour New Zealand in 1959/60 with the Australian team. He played two matches against New Zealand but they weren't given Test status. This was because it was in effect a 'Second XI', with the first choice players given a rest after back to back tours of India and Pakistan. Lill fared poorly in his four innings, scoring 1, 15, 6 and 0. Back home, Lill had his most prolific season in 1960/61 when he amassed 809 runs in all first-class fixtures, at an average of 42.57. His only first-class wicket was Victorian batsman Jack Potter, whom he dismissed for 156, caught by Barry Jarman in 1962. Lill was also a talented footballer and played in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) with Norwood. A centre half forward, Lill was Norwood's top goal-kicker in 1961 and 1962, with 40 and 52 goals respectively. He participated in the famous 1961 'Bloodbath' Grand Final against West Adelaide.

It was discovered independently in late November 1743 by Jan de Munck, in the second week of December by Dirk Klinkenberg, and, four days later, by Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux. It became visible with the naked eye for several months in 1744 and displayed dramatic and unusual effects in the sky. Its absolute magnitude — or intrinsic brightness — of 0.5 was the sixth highest in recorded history.Kidger, M. Comet Hale-Bopp Light Curve, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, accessed 17-11-08 Its apparent magnitude may have reached as high as -7, leading it to be classified among what are called the \\"Great Comets\\". This comet is noted especially for developing a 'fan' of six tails after reaching its perihelion.  Discovery  The comet was discovered on November 29, 1743, by Jan de Munck at Middelburg,De Munck, J., Sterrekundige Waarneemingen op de Comeet of Staart-Sterre; Sedert den 29 November des Jaars 1743. tot op den 1 Maart van den Jaare 1744, Amsterdam/Middelburg: Isaak Tirion/Hendrik van Hoekke, 1744. and was independently sighted on December 9, 1743 by Klinkenberg at Haarlem, and by Chéseaux from the observatory at Lausanne on December 13. Chéseaux said it lacked a tail and resembled a nebulous star of the third magnitude; he measured the coma as five minutes across.Kronk, G. W. Cometography: A Catalog of Comets, I, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 408. The comet brightened steadily as it approached perihelion. By February 18, 1744, it reportedly was as bright as the planet Venus (with an apparent magnitude of -4.6) and at this time displayed a double tail.  Perihelion, \\"six tails\\"  The comet reached perihelion about March 1, 1744, when it was 0.2 astronomical units from the Sun. At about this time it was bright enough to be observed in daylight with the naked eye.Kronk, p.410 As it moved away from perihelion, a spectacular tail developed — extending well above the horizon while the comet's head remained invisible due to the morning twilight. In early March 1744, Chéseaux and several other observers reported an extremely unusual phenomenon — a 'fan' of six separate tails rose above the horizon.Kronk, p.410 The Great Comet on 16 February 1744 over Nuremberg. An engraving illustration of \\"COMET-STERNS\\" (Comet-Stars) by astronomer & master engraver Johann Georg Puschner (1680-1749) of Comet Klinkenberg. The tail structure was a puzzle to astronomers for many years. Although other comets had displayed multiple tails on occasion, the 1744 comet was unique by having six. It has been suggested that the 'fan' of tails was generated by as many as three active sources on the cometary nucleus, exposed in turn to solar radiation as the nucleus rotated.Kronk, p.411 It also has been proposed that the tail phenomenon was a very prominent example of the \\"dust striae\\" seen in the tails of some comets, such as Comet West and C/2006 P1 (McNaught).  Other observations  Chéseaux, on March 9, was the last known observer in the northern hemisphere to see the comet, but it remained visible for observers in the southern hemisphere, some of whom reported a tail length of approximately 90 degrees on March 18.Kronk, p.411 The comet was not seen after April 22, 1744. The comet also was noted in Japanese astronomical records in the Nihon Odai Ichiran of the Kanpō era.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Nihon Odai Ichiran; or, Annales des empereurs du Japon. Paris: Royal Asiatic Society, Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland, p. 418. OCLC 5850691. Researchers have found in Chinese astronomical records that some Chinese observations describe audible sounds associated with the comet, which may, if true, have resulted from the interaction of particles with the Earth's magnetosphere, as sometimes described for the aurora.Keay, C. Explanation of Auroral Sounds, Australian Space Weather Agency, accessed 17-11-08 Among those who saw the comet was the thirteen-year-old Charles Messier, on whom it had a profound and inspirational effect. He went on to become a significant figure in astronomy, and later discovered many comets during his observations. Catherine the Great, then Sophia, also observed the brilliant comet as a young girl as she was travelling to Russia to be wedded.

Some evidence from historical linguistics suggests that the Nok culture of Nigeria may have practiced iron smelting from as early as 1000 BC;Duncan E. Miller and N.J. Van Der Merwe, 'Early Metal Working in Sub Saharan Africa' Journal of African History 35 (1994) 1-36Minze Stuiver and N.J. Van Der Merwe, 'Radiocarbon Chronology of the Iron Age in Sub-Saharan Africa' Current Anthropology 1968. Tylecote 1975 archaeological evidence dates this not later than 550 BC. Evidence also exists for earlier iron metallurgy in parts Nigeria, Cameroon, and Central Africa. The nearby Djenné-Djenno culture of the Niger Valley in Mali shows evidence of iron production from 250 BC. The Bantu expansion spread the technology to Eastern and Southern Africa during 500 BC to AD 400, as shown in the Urewe culture K. Shillington, History of Africa (3rd ed. 2005), 61-68\\\\. of the Lake Victoria region.  Archaeological evidence for the origins and spread of iron production in Africa  Although the origins of iron working in Africa have been the subject of scholarly interest since the 1860s, it is still not known whether this technology diffused into sub-Saharan Africa from the Mediterranean region, or whether it was invented there independently of iron working elsewhere.Alpern, S. B. (2005) Did they or didn’t they invent it? Iron in sub-Saharan Africa. History in Africa 32:41-94. Although some nineteenth- century European scholars favored an indigenous invention of iron working in sub-Saharan Africa, archaeologists writing between 1945 and 1965 mostly favored diffusion of iron smelting technology from Carthage across the Sahara to West Africa and/or from Meroe on the upper Nile to central Africa.van der Merwe, N. J. 1980. The advent of iron in Africa. In The Coming of the Age of Iron, eds. T. S. Wertime, J.D. Muhly, pp. 463-506. New Haven: Yale University Press. This in turn has been questioned by more recent research. The invention of radiocarbon dating in the late 1950s enabled dating of metallurgical sites by the charcoal fuel used for smelting and forging. By the late 1960s some surprisingly early radiocarbon dates had been obtained for iron smelting sites in both Nigeria and central Africa (Rwanda, Burundi), reviving the view that iron-making was independently invented in sub-Saharan Africa.Trigger, B.

These dates preceded the known antiquity of ironworking in Carthage or Meroe, weakening the diffusion hypothesis. In the 1990s, evidence was found of Phoenician iron smelting in the western Mediterranean (900–800 BC),Descoeudres, E. Huysecom, V. Serneels and J.-L.

According to archaeometallurgist Manfred Eggert, \\"Carthage cannot be reliably considered the point of origin for sub-Saharan iron ore reduction.\\" It is still not known when iron working was first practiced in Kush and Meroe in modern Sudan, but the earliest known iron metallurgy dates from Meroe and Egypt do not predate those from sub-Saharan Africa, and thus the Nile Valley is considered unlikely to be the source of sub-Saharan iron metallurgy. From the mid-1970s there were new claims for independent invention of iron smelting in central NigerQuéchon, G. and J.-P. Roset (1974). Prospection archéologique du massif du Termit (Niger).

This funded both the conference on early iron in Africa and the MediterraneanDescoeudres at al. 2001 (above) and a volume, published by UNESCO, that generated some controversy because it included only authors sympathetic to the independent-invention view.Bocoum, H. (ed.) 2004 The Origins of Iroen Metallurgy in Africa: New Light on Its Antiquity – West and Central Africa. Geneva:UNESCO Two reviews of the evidence from the mid-2000s found major technical flaws in the studies claiming independent invention, raising three major issues.Killick, D.J. (2004) Review Essay. What do we know about African iron working? Journal of African Archaeology 2(1):97-112.Alpern 2005 (above) The first was whether the material dated by radiocarbon was in secure archaeological association with iron-working residues. Many of the dates from Niger, for example, were on organic matter in potsherds that were lying on the ground surface together with iron objects. The second issue was the possible effect of \\"old carbon\\": wood or charcoal much older than the time at which iron was smelted. This is a particular problem in Niger, where the charred stumps of ancient trees are a potential source of charcoal, and have sometimes been misidentified as smelting furnaces. A third issue is the weaker precision of the radiocarbon method for dates between 800 and 400 BC, attributable to irregular production of radiocarbon in the upper atmosphere. Unfortunately most radiocarbon dates for the initial spread of iron metallurgy in sub-Saharan Africa fall within this range. Controversy flared again with the publication of excavations by Étienne Zangato and colleagues in the Central African Republic.Zangato, E. (2007) Les Ateliers d’Oboui: Premières Communautés Métallurgistes dans le Nord-Ést du Centrafrique. Paris: Editions Recherche sur les Civilisations (ERC).Zangato, E. and Holl, A.F.C. (2010) ‘On the iron front: new evidence from Central Africa’, Journal of African Archaeology 8:7-23. At Oboui they excavated an undated iron forge yielding eight consistent radiocarbon dates of 2000 BC. This would make Oboui the oldest iron-working site in the world, and more than a thousand years older than any other dated evidence of iron in Central Africa. Opinion among African archaeologists is sharply divided. Some specialists accept this interpretation, but archarologist Bernard Clist has suggested that Oboui is a highly disturbed site, with older charcoal having been brought up to the level of the forge by the digging of pits into older levels.Clist, B. (2012) Vers une réduction des prejugés et la fonte des antagonisms: un bilan de l’expansion de la métallurgie du fer en Afrique sud- Saharienne, Journal of African Archaeology 10:71-84. Clist also raised questions about the unusually good state of preservation of metallic iron from the site.Pringle, H. 2009. Seeking Africa's first iron men. Science 323:200-202. Archaeologists such as Craddock, Eggert, and Holl however, have argued that such disruption is highly unlikely given the nature of the site. Additionally, Holl, regarding the state of preservation, argues that this observation was based on published illustrations representing a small unrepresentative number of atypically well-preserved objects selected for publication. At Gbabiri, also in the Central African Republic, Eggert has found evidence of an iron reduction furnace and blacksmith workshop with earliest dates of 896-773 BC and 907-796 BC respectively. In the Nsukka region of southeast Nigeria (now Igboland), archaeological sites containing iron smelting furnaces and slag have been excavated dating to 750 BC in Opi (Augustin Holl 2009) and 2,000 BC in Lejja (Pamela Eze-Uzomaka 2009). According to Augustin Holl (2018), there is evidence of ironworking dated to 2,153–2,044 BC and 2,368–2,200 BC from the site of Gbatoro, Cameroon. In 2014, archaeo-metallurgist Manfred Eggert argued that, though still inconclusive, the evidence overall suggests an independent invention of iron metallurgy in Sub-Saharan Africa. In a 2018 study, Archaeologist Augustin Holl also argues that an independent invention is most likely. In summary, there is no proof that iron working technology was taken across the Sahara into sub-Saharan Africa; nor is there proof of independent invention. Given the multitude of potential problems with radiocarbon dating in the first millennium BC, archaeologists trying to date the earliest African metallurgy need to make routine use of luminescence dating of the baked clay from smelting furnaces. While the origins of iron smelting are difficult to date by radiocarbon, there are fewer problems with using it to track the spread of ironworking after 400 BC. In the 1960s it was suggested that iron working was spread by speakers of Bantu languages, whose original homeland has been located by linguists in the Benue River valley of eastern Nigeria and Western Cameroon. Although some assert that no words for iron or ironworking can be traced to reconstructed proto-Bantu,de Maret, P and F. Nsuka (1977) History of Bantu metallurgy: some linguistic aspects. History in Africa 4:43-65 place-names in West Africa suggest otherwise, for example (Okuta) Ilorin, literally \\"site of iron-work\\". The linguist Christopher Ehret argues that the first words for iron-working in Bantu languages were borrowed from Central Sudanic languages in the vicinity of modern Uganda and Kenya,Ehret, C. (2000) The establishment of iron-working in Eastern, Central and South Africa: linguistic Inferences on technological history. Sprache ind Geschichte in Afrika 16/7:125-176. while Jan VansinaVansina, J. (2006) Linguistic evidence for the introduction of ironworking into Bantu-speaking Africa. History in Africa 33: 321-361. argues instead that they originated in non-Bantu languages in Nigeria, and that iron metallurgy spread southwards and eastwards to Bantu speakers, who had already dispersed into the Congo rainforest and the Great Lakes region. Archaeological evidence clearly indicates that starting in the first century BC, iron and cereal agriculture (millet and sorghum) spread together southward from southern Tanzania and northern Zambia, all the way to the eastern Cape region of present South Africa by the third of fourth century AD.Killick, D. (2014) Cairo to Cape: the spread of metallurgy through eastern and southern Africa. In Archaeometallurgy in Global Perspective: Methods and Syntheses, edited by Ben Roberts and Christopher Thornton, pp. 507-528. New York: Springer. It seems highly probable that this occurred through migrations of Bantu-speaking peoples.  Techniques  All indigenous African iron smelting processes are variants of the bloomery process. A much wider range of bloomery smelting processes has been recorded on the African continent than elsewhere in the Old World, probably because bloomeries remained in use into the 20th century in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, whereas in Europe and most parts of Asia they were replaced by the blast furnace before most varieties of bloomeries could be recorded. W.W. Cline's compilation of eye-witness records of bloomery iron smelting over the past 250 years in AfricaCline, W.W. (1937) Mining and Metallurgy in Negro Africa. Menasha, WI: George Banta is invaluable, and has been supplemented by more recent ethnoarchaeological and archaeological studies. Furnaces used in the 19th and 20th centuries ranges from small bowl furnaces, dug down from the ground surface and powered by bellows, through bellows-powered shaft furnaces up to 1.5 m tall, to 6.5m natural-draft furnaces (i.e. furnaces designed to operate without bellows at all). Over much of tropical Africa the ore used was laterite, which is widely available on the old continental cratons in West, Central and Southern Africa. Magnetite sand, concentrated in streams by flowing water, was often used in more mountainous areas, after beneficiation to raise the concentration of iron. Precolonial iron workers in present South Africa even smelted iron-titanium ores that modern blast furnaces are not designed to use.Killick, D.J. and D. Miller (2014). Smelting of magnetite and magnetite-ilmenite ores in the northern Lowveld, South Africa, ca. 1000 CE – ca.1880 CE. Journal of Archaeological Science 43:239-255. Bloomery furnaces were less productive than blast furnaces, but were far more versatile. The fuel used was invariably charcoal, and the products were the bloom (a solid mass of iron) and slag (a liquid waste product). African ironworkers regularly produced inhomogeneous steel blooms, especially in the large natural-draft furnaces. The blooms invariably contained some entrapped slag, and after removal from the furnace had to be reheated and hammered to expel as much of the slag as possible. Semi-finished bars of iron or steel were widely traded in some parts of West Africa, as for example at Sukur on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, which in the nineteenth century exported thousands of bars per year north to the Lake Chad Basin.David, N. (editor) Metals in Mandara Mountains Society and Culture. Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press. Although many African ironworkers produced steel blooms, there is little evidence in sub-Saharan as yet for hardening of steel by quenching and tempering. or for the manufacture of composite tools combining a hard steel cutting edge with a soft but tough iron body. Relatively little metallography of ancient African iron tools has yet been done, so this conclusion may perhaps be modified by future work. Unlike bloomery iron-workers in Europe, India or China, African metalworkers did not make use of water power to blow bellows in furnaces too large to be blown by hand-powered bellows. This is partly because sub-Saharan Africa has much less potential for water power than these other regions, but also because there were no engineering techniques developed for converting rotary motion to linear motion. African ironworkers did however invent a way to increase the size of their furnaces, and thus the amount of metal produced per charge, without using bellows. This was the natural-draft furnace, which is designed to reach the temperatures necessary to form and drain slag by using a chimney effect – hot air leaving the topic of the furnace draws in more air through openings at the base. (Natural-draft furnaces should not be confused with wind-powered furnaces, which were invariably small). The natural-draft furnace was the one African innovation in ferrous metallurgy that spread widely.Killick, D. J. (1991) A little known extractive process: iron smelting in natural-draft furnaces. JOM (Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society) 43(4):62-64. Natural draft furnaces were particularly characteristic of African savanna woodlands, and were used in two belts – across the Sahelian woodlands from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east, and in the Brachystegia-Julbenardia (miombo) woodlands from southern Tanzania south to northern Zimbabwe. The oldest natural-draft furnaces yet found are in Burkina Faso and date to the seventh/eight centuries Serneels, V., Donadini, F., Kiénon-Kaboré, H.T., Koté, L.,Kouassi, S.K., Ramseyer, D. and Simporé, L.

Schweizerisch-Liechtensteinische Stiftung für Archäologische Forshungen I'm Ausland (SLSA), Annual Report 2013:65-112. The large masses of slag (10,000 to 60,000 tons) noted in some locations in Togo, Burkina Faso and Mali reflect the great expansion of iron production in West Africa after 1000 AD that is associated with the spread of natural-draft furnace technology.Robion-Brunner C.

Bassar: a quantified, chronologically controlled, regional approach to a traditional iron production centre in West Africa. Africa 56:148-174. But not all large scale iron production in Africa was associated with natural draft furnaces – those of Meroe (Sudan, first to fifth centuries AD) were produced by slag-tapping bellows-driven furnaces,Shinnie, P.L. and F.J. Kense (1982) Meroitic iron working, in: N.B. Millet, A.L. Kelley (Eds.) Meroitic Studies: Proceedings of the Third International Meroitic Conference, Toronto 1977, Akademie-Verlag, Berlin, DDR, 1982, pp. 17-28. and the large 18th-19th century iron industry of the Cameroon grasslands by non-tapping bellows-driven furnaces.Warnier, J.-P. and Fowler, I. (1979). A nineteenth- century Ruhr in central Africa. Africa 49:329-351. All of the large-scale iron smelting recorded so far are in the Sahelian and Sudanic zones that stretch from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east; there were no iron-smelting concentrations like these in central or southern Africa. There is also evidence that carbon steel was made in Western Tanzania by the ancestors of the Haya people as early as 2,300-2,000 years ago by a complex process of \\"pre-heating\\" allowing temperatures inside a furnace to reach 1300 to 1400 °C. These techniques are now extinct in all regions of sub-Saharan Africa, except, in the case of some of techniques, for some very remote regions of Ethiopia. In most regions of Africa they fell out of use before 1950. The main reason for this was the increasing availability of iron imported from Europe. Blacksmiths still work in rural areas of Africa to make and repair agricultural tools, but the iron that they use is imported, or recycled from old motor vehicles.  Uses  Iron was not the only metal to be used in Africa; copper and brass were widely utilised too. However the steady spread of iron meant it must have had more favourable properties for many different uses. Its durability over copper meant that it was used to make many tools from farming pieces to weaponry. Iron was used for personal adornment in jewelry, impressive pieces of artwork and even instruments. It was used for coins and currencies of varying forms. For example, kisi pennies; a traditional form of iron currency used for trading in West Africa. They are twisted iron rods ranging from <30 cm to >2m in length. Suggestions for their uses vary from marital transactions, or simply that they were a convenient shape for transportation, melting down and reshaping into a desired object. There are many different forms of iron currency, often regionally differing in shape and value. Iron did not replace other materials, such as stone and wooden tools, but the quantity of production and variety of uses met were significantly high by comparison.  Social and cultural significance  It is important to recognize that while iron production had great influence over Africa both culturally in trade and expansion (Martinelli, 1993, 1996, 2004), as well as socially in beliefs and rituals, there is great regional variation. Much of the evidence for cultural significance comes from the practises still carried out today by different African cultures. Ethnographical information has been very useful in reconstructing the events surrounding iron production in the past, however the reconstructions could have become distorted through time and influence by anthropologist's studies. The Iron Age of Africa was based around the agricultural revolution, driven by the use of iron tools. Tools for cultivation and farming made production far more efficient and possible on much larger scales. Fishing hooks, arrow heads and spears aided hunting. Iron weapons also influenced warfare. These items, in addition to the production of other iron goods helped stimulate economic activity, the rise of chiefdoms and even states. The control of iron production was often by ironworkers themselves, or a \\"central power\\" in larger societies such as kingdoms or states (Barros 2000, p. 154).de Barros, P., 2000. \\"Iron Metallurgy: Sociocultural Context\\". J. O. (ed.) Ancient African Metallurgy, The Socio- Cultural Context. England: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers Inc, pp. 147–198 The demand for trade is believed to have resulted in some societies working only as smelters or smiths, specialising in just one of the many skills necessary to the production process. It is possible that this also led to tradesmen specialising in transporting and trading iron (Barros 2000, pg152). However, not every region benefited from industrialising iron production, others created environmental problems that arose due to the massive deforestation required to provide the charcoal for fuelling furnaces (for example the ecological crisis of the Mema Region (Holl 2000, pg48)). Iron smelters and smiths received different social status depending on their culture. Some were lower in society due to the aspect of manual labour and associations with witchcraft, for example in the Maasai and Tuareg (Childs et al. 2005 pg 288). In other cultures the skills are often passed down through family and would receive great social status (sometimes even considered as witchdoctors) within their community. Their powerful knowledge allowed them to produce materials on which the whole community relied. In some communities they were believed to have such strong supernatural powers that they were regarded as highly as the king or chief. For example, an excavation at the royal tomb of King Rugira (Great Lakes, Eastern Africa) found two iron anvils placed at his head (Childs et al. 2005, p. 288 in Herbert 1993:ch.6). In some cultures mythical stories have been built around the premise of the iron smelter emphasising their godlike significance.  Rituals  The smelting process was often carried out away from the rest of the community. Ironworkers became experts in rituals to encourage good production and to ward off bad spirits, including song and prayers, plus the giving of medicines and even sacrifices. The latter are usually put in the furnace itself or buried under the base of the furnace. Examples of these date back as far as the early Iron Age in Tanzania and Rwanda (Schmidt 1997 in Childs et al., 2005 p. 293).Schmidt, P.R., 1997. Iron Technology In East Africa. Symbolism, Science and Archaeology. Oxford, James Currey Publishers. Some cultures associated sexual symbolism with iron production. Smelting is integrated with the fertility of their society, as with natural reproduction the production of the bloom is compared to the conception and birth. There are many strict taboos surrounding the process. The smelting process is carried out entirely by men and often away from the village. For women to touch any of the materials or be present could jeopardise the success of the production. The furnaces are also often extravagantly adorned to resemble a woman, the mother of the bloom.

The neighborhood is divided into les pentes (slopes, belonging to the city's 1st arrondissement) and le plateau (atop the hill, part of the 4th arrondissement). The name \\"La Croix-Rousse\\" ('the russet/red cross') comes from a reddish-brown stone cross erected there in the 16th century. This zone is served by Metro line . The appearance of the neighborhood is heavily influenced by the central role that Lyon played in the silk industry in France. The vast majority of buildings in the area feature large vaulted ceilings with exposed wooden rafters. The larger internal height available in these buildings, compared to other areas in Lyon, was necessary for housing the tall silk looms that were operated in the area. Also of note are the traboules of Croix-Rousse. These are covered passageways used by silk merchants to travel and ferry material between buildings while being sheltered from rain. The area has since been subject to gentrification, and now exhibits a vibrant cultural scene. La Croix-Rousse has always possessed a unique atmosphere compared to the rest of the city. As an illustration, some inhabitants call themselves Croix-roussiens. In Lyon, La Croix-Rousse is nicknamed la colline qui travaille ('the hill that works') in contrast to the better-known hill to the southwest, Fourvière, which is known as la colline qui prie ('the hill that prays'). The district started developing in the 18th century when the silk workshops moved here from the Vieux-Lyon area. The canuts (silk workers) were subject to extremely poor working conditions. On account of these conditions, they staged many worker uprisings, known as the Canut revolts. The first revolt, in October 1831, is considered to be one of the first worker uprisings. The area was immortalized in Paul-Jacques Bonzon's book series Les Six Compagnons, which depicts the adventures of seven young working-class teenagers from the area.

The school is run by the Queensland State Government, and is split on either side of Kent Street. The school colours are blue and brown. In 2019 MSHS had 870 students (including 79 students identifying as indigenous) with 74 teachers (78 full-time equivalent) and 50 non-teaching staff (35 full-time equivalent). The school has had many incarnations, starting its life as Maryborough Boys Grammar School and Maryborough Girls Grammar School, then from 1937 a segregated boys and girls state high school. The school became coeducational from 1974. From 2017, Maryborough State High School is an Independent Public School. The school is the only Regional Queensland School identified as a Brisbane Roar School of Football for Soccer Excellence.  History  The Maryborough Boys Grammar School was founded on the north side of Kent Street in 1881 and the Maryborough Girls Grammar School on the south of Kent Street in 1883. An assembly hall was added to the side of the Girls Grammar School in 1888. Four Rhodes scholars graduated from Maryborough Boys Grammar School and many students went on to distinguished careers. Hit hard by the effects of the Great Depression, the Grammar Schools were forced to close. They were subsequently taken over by the Department of Education in 1936 to become the Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Boys and Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Girls. The Boys' and Girls' High Schools were amalgamated in 1974 to form Maryborough State High School.MSHS Annual Report 2007 The school has a long-standing tradition of excellence in the Maryborough region and has had many notable Australians attend the school. The original building of Maryborough Boys Grammar School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992. It now houses the English and Humanities Departments.Grade 12 2008, Photo taken in the Fairy Ring  Location  The campus is situated on either side of Kent Street adjacent to the Maryborough CBD.  Facilities  The school has a number of sporting facilities - an artificial hockey surface, multipurpose gymnasium, 2 ovals, ping pong tables, a gym and a tennis court. There are six computer labs with network and internet access with individual user accounts. The school also offers a Bring Your Own Device (BYOx) model so all students can bring their own computer or device to use in all classrooms.

The only named species in the genus is Duriavenator hesperis, formerly known as Megalosaurus hesperis. Duriavenator lived during the Bajocian stage, around 170 million years ago, making it one of the oldest-known Tetanurae. The genus name combines the Latin name of Dorset, Duria, with Latin for \\"hunter\\", venator.Benson, R.B.J. (2008). \\"A redescription of \\"Megalosaurus\\" hesperis (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Inferior Oolite (Bajocian, Middle Jurassic) of Dorset, United Kingdom\\". Zootaxa 1931: 57-67. This genus has also gone under the unofficial name \\"Walkersaurus\\", which is a nomen nudum. It's been estimated to be 7 meters (23 feet) in length. Discovery Lithograph of the holotype, with the same bones shown on a monitor lizard on the lower right In the Spring of 1882, a friend of contractor Edward Cleminshaw during construction at Redhole Lane in Sherborne, discovered stone blocks with skull remains. The stones had been removed from a quarry at the back of a row of houses at Cold Harbour Road in Greenhill in West Dorset. In 1883, the fossils were by Richard Owen referred to the type species of Megalosaurus, Megalosaurus bucklandii. Owen considered the find especially useful to complete information on the head of Megalosaurus as few of its skull bones had been identified until then.Owen, R., 1883. \\"On the skull of Megalosaurus\\". Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London 39(1-4): 334-347 After 1883, the reference was generally accepted. In 1964 however, Alick Donald Walker concluded that the specimen represented a separate species within the genus Megalosaurus, due to its higher tooth count, but as yet did not name this species.Walker, A.D. 1964. \\"Triassic reptiles from the Elgin area: Ornithosuchus and the origin of carnosaurs\\". Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B, 244: 53–134 In 1974, Michael Waldman, in close cooperation with Walker and after further preparation of the fossil, named and described it as a new species of the genus Megalosaurus: Megalosaurus hesperis. The specific name is derived from the Greek Ἑσπερίς, \\"West\\" or \\"western\\". The holotype of the species, BNMH R. 332, had been found in a layer, the \\"freestone\\", of the Upper Inferior Oolite dating from the late Bajocian, about 168 million years old. It consists of skull and lower jaw parts. It contains both premaxillae, a right maxilla, a possible vomer, both dentaries and a right surangular. Most of the material is present in a main block; a second block had been separated, longitudinally splitting the maxilla. In the seventies, Samuel Paul Welles and Jaime Emilio Powell prepared a study on European theropods, planning to name a separate genus \\"Walkersaurus\\". Their manuscript remained unpublished but in 1994 and 1995 Stephan Pickering divulged parts of it, also containing the name \\"Walkersaurus hesperis\\".Pickering, S., 1995. \\"Jurassic Park: Unauthorized Jewish Fractals in Philopatry\\" in: A Fractal Scaling in Dinosaurology Project, 2nd revised printing, Capitola, California This is generally considered an invalid nomen nudum or nomen non rite publicatum. By the early twenty-first century, a consensus had developed that the species was in need of a new genus name. In 2004, the textbook The Dinosauria indicated it as an \\"unnamed tetanuran\\". e.a., 2004, The Dinosauria, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, p. 72 In 2008, Roger Benson named a separate genus Duriavenator. The generic name is a combination of the Latin Duria, \\"Dorset\\", and venator, \\"hunter\\". The type species of the genus is Megalosaurus hesperis. The combinatio nova is Duriavenator hesperis. Classification The following is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Carrano, Benson & Sampson (2012), showing the relationships of Duriavenator:Carrano, M. T.; Benson, R. B.

Biography Dhaliwal was born in the Punjab, and moved with her family to England at the age of four and grew up in Southall, London.\\"Sarindar Dhaliwal rewrites the past at A Space\\" At the age of fifteen, she migrated again with her family to Canada and settled down on a farm near Brampton, Ontario. Finding it challenging to adapt to small town life, she worked to save up for a trip back to London, where she stayed for a year. She received a BA in Fine Art at Falmouth University, Cornwall in England (1978), then moved back to Canada where she still lives. She gained a MA from York University, Toronto in 2003. Subsequently, she earned a Ph.D in Cultural Studies from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Dhaliwal's Art Dhaliwal's work is narrative based, exploring issues of cultural identity, and includes installation, printmaking, collage, painting and video projection. Much of Dhaliwal's work deals with memory - specifically childhood memories. Dhaliwal's art tells the story of her life as a global citizen by cleverly exploring the complex relationships between memory and place, language and colour, sport and ritual, family and society, and the histories of colonialism and migration focusing on racism, conflict, and identity. As a result, Dhalwal's art is simultaneously personal and universal, defying all attempts at categorization. the green fairy story book (bookwork with table, 2010) is influenced by Dhaliwal's love of colour which she developed in childhood from reading fairy stories in colourful books at the library. Southall:Childplay (chromira print, 2009) covers an entire wall with her own collection of coloured pencils, which she used to play with. In When I grow up I want to be a namer of paint colors (mixed media on graph paper, 2010), Dhaliwal gives names to colours: crushed raspberry, Indian summer, burnt persimmon. Dhaliwal's love of colour is also evident in the glowing colours of 28 ambassador cars (chromira print, 2010) driving around an island of text. It was Dhaliwal's own lived experience of racism in the West that nurtured her love of colour. However, all colors are equal for her. In Corner Flags and Corner Shops (mixed media installation, 2013) depicting a racist incidence even on the soccer field, she paints in multicoloured butterflies on white paper, to point out that colours are natural and racism is not a part of nature. Dhaliwal's videowork olive, almond and mustard (2010) depicts her childhood memory of growing up in Britain having her long black hair washed with white yoghurt and oiled and braided by her mother. This piece moves back and forth from India to Britain with nursery rhymes, Bollywood film music, English pop songs and BBC Radio news describing her immigrant childhood in Great Britain. The cartographer's mistake: the Radcliffe Line (chromira print, 2012) depicts the partition of the Indian subcontinent in Marigold flowers. Marigolds are traditionally a symbol of welcome but here they set the country afire. In 1947, Cyril Radcliffe was charged with carving up the subcontinent into 2 countries on the basis of religion: India and Pakistan. Even today, people are still writing and talking about the nightmare of partition. Exhibitions Dhaliwal has exhibited her work at many major Canadian public galleries, including The Edmonton Art Gallery and the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Ontario. She is represented in the Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art.Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art.

M. Stirling. It is the sixth book in the Emberverse series. Rudi Mackenzie and his group leave Iowa, heading through Wisconsin, out onto the Great Lakes, into what was once Maine and finally to Nantucket. All the while they are pursued by the Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT), led by a High Seeker (a CUT priest with supernatural powers) and Major Graber. Plot summary Rudi Mackenzie and Edain Aylward Mackenzie head out through post-Change Illinois on a mission given to them by the Bossman of Iowa to recover Ingolf Vogeler's wagons that he abandoned there. They break up an ambush by Knifers and save three Southside Freedom Fighters (Southsiders), descendants of survivors from Chicago, including their leader Jake. Rudi adopts the tribe and they help him bring Ingolf's wagons back to Iowa. Along the way, Rudi and Edain teach them how to make bows and arrows, then train them as military archers. Southsiders listen to them sing and add the songs to their story-poor culture. Soon the Southsiders consider themselves part of Clan Mackenzie. Meanwhile, Mary and Ritva Havel are trying to find a way to break Ingolf out of the Bossman's prison. Then Captain Denson of the Iowa State Police has a conversation with Ingolf and offers to release him from prison if he lures the CUT troops from Des Moines. When Ingolf agrees, Denson takes him out while his men kill the other prisoners who witnessed the conversation. When Rudi reaches the Mississippi River, Denson meets them on the east side of the river. He brings Ingolf with him. They cross the river and meet the Bossman and the rest of Rudi's party in Dubuque. Meanwhile, the Corvallis Meeting is fighting CUT and Boise invaders. The Prophet's troops are converging on the Meeting lands from several directions. While the Meeting nations can slow the invasion down, they have been unable to drive the invaders back. News that the Portland Protective Association are losing castles due to the strange abilities of the CUT High Seekers causes morale to drop. Back in Iowa, the Major Graber and his CUT forces attempt to kill Rudi and his allies. Though Rudi survives, the CUT manage to assassinate the Bossman of Iowa. Thanks to Mathilda Arminger's efforts, however, she manages to encourage the Bossman's wife to take power as Regent, creating a new ally for Rudi and his group. Rudi and his group leave Iowa heading north along the Mississippi River. While en route, Rudi's companions swear loyalty to him as the High King of \\"Montival\\", the new name the group has chosen for the Pacific Northwest. Rudi reluctantly accepts. Rudi and his group arrive in the nation of Richland, Ingolf's home. While there Ingolf makes amends with his estranged brother, a local sheriff, who agrees to help Ingolf and his friends reach Nantucket. Heading north around the Great Lakes using skis to move over the snow, the party is attacked once again by CUT forces who are allied with French-speaking savages from former Quebec. Though they succeed in driving off the CUT forces, Jake is killed in the battle. Arriving in Maine, Rudi and his followers are taken in by survivors who have adopted a Viking-like culture. They agree to help Rudi reach Nantucket, but upon arriving at a coastal town, they discover it under siege by Major Graber and Muslim Corsairs. Rudi and his forces succeed in lifting the siege and capture one of the pirate leaders, but Odard Liu is killed during the battle. Rudi convinces the pirate captain to take him and his followers to Nantucket. They are chased there by Major Graber who has commandeered another pirate vessel. As both ships arrive at Nantucket, reality begins to change as alternate versions of Nantucket begin to appear at random. Rudi and his followers fight their way onto Nantucket. There Rudi is transported into the presence of Maiden, Mother, and Crone who have taken the form of Rudi's mother (Juniper Mackenzie) and Marion Alston and Swindapa from the Nantucket series. They explain the reason behind the Change, alluding at humanity's importance (the Fermi paradox) and that certain forces saw the need for humanity to mature more before it self-destructed due to abuse of technology. They also explain the powers that are aiding CUT as a result of a disagreement between those forces on how best to guide the changed humanity. Rudi is last seen removing the Sword of the Lady from its sheath. Back in Montival, Juniper calls on the help of the gods against the CUT in a ceremony (Cone of power). During the ceremony visible light emanates from Juniper's hands and she proclaims the coming of the High King. Literary significance and reception As of September 3, 2009, The Sword of the Lady has ranked 13th on the New York Times Best Seller List. This is the first time that a Stirling novel has reached the top 15 on the list.

It reached #18 on the charts.I Prefer the Moonlight - Kenny Rogers  Awards  AllMusic Though the album only reached #163 in the Billboard 200, the success in the country market was enough for it to go gold. It contained three top five singles: the title cut and the grammy-winning duet with Ronnie Milsap, \\"Make No Mistake, She's Mine\\" and \\"The Factory\\". The album was Rogers' final studio album for RCA Records. Singles The initial single was the Ronnie Milsap duet \\"Make No Mistake, She's Mine\\", which brought Rogers and Milsap to the top of the charts in both the US and Canada. The title cut was released next, and reached #2, a feat equaled to the north as well. \\"The Factory\\" was the third single, and reached #6 in the US and #3 in Canada. A final venture was made with \\"I Don't Call Him Daddy\\", a lesser hit, peaking at #86. (The release of \\"I Don't Call Him Daddy\\" was to support the 1988 RCA \\"Greatest Hits\\" release, and received little promotion as Rogers was leaving the label.)

A former international with 67 caps to his name, he came close to making the 2006 FIFA World Cup team for Trinidad and Tobago. He played for La Brea Angels, Trintoc, United Petrotrin, and Trinity Pros, before signing with Scottish club Raith Rovers in March 1995. He helped the club to the First Division title in 1994–95, before joining Hibernian in July 1997 for a £250,000 fee. He helped \\"Hibs\\" to secure the First Division title in 1998–99, before he was sold on to English club Port Vale for £175,000 in January 1999. He moved on to Reading for £325,000 in August 2000, and helped the \\"Royals\\" to promotion out of the Second Division in 2000–01. He switched to Brentford in May 2003, before joining Bristol City in March 2004. He then had spells in China with Nanjing Yoyo and in America with Rochester Rhinos, before returning to Trinidad to play for United Petrotrin, North East Stars, and FC South End. Club career Starting his career in his native Trinidad and Tobago with La Brea Angels, Trintoc, United Petrotrin, and Trinity Pros, Rougier switched the Caribbean for Raith Rovers of Kirkcaldy, Scotland in March 1995. He would have signed for Bradford City, but could not secure a work permit in time. He spent the first half of 1998–99 with Hibernian, playing eighteen games and scoring once against Morton. It would prove to be an easy campaign for Alex McLeish's \\"Hibs\\", as they eventually finished 23 points clear of second place Falkirk. Rougier was not at Easter Road for the celebrations, however, having been sold to English club Port Vale for £175,000 in January 1999. He arrived at Vale Park with the club about to suffer a drastic downturn in fortunes as chairman Bill Bell replaced manager John Rudge with Brian Horton. He made twelve appearances for Vale at the end of the season. Rougier scored nine goals in 41 games in 1999–2000, becoming a crowd favourite and the club's top scorer, but it was not enough to prevent the \\"Valiants\\" from losing their First Division status. In August 2000 he was sold on to fellow Second Division side Reading for £325,000, signing a three-year contract. Reading got to the play-off final at the end of the 2000–01 season, but Rougier scored an own goal as they lost to Walsall after extra-time. The following season, the club pushed for a second successive promotion, aiming for the Premier League. Rougier was loaned out to Brighton & Hove Albion late in the season, scoring twice for the \\"Seagulls\\" in six appearances, leading to speculation of a permanent transfer. Returning to the Madejski Stadium in time for the play-offs, he played a part of the semi-final second leg, replacing Darius Henderson after 64 minutes. Eventual play-off winners Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Reading 3–1 on aggregate. At the end of the campaign, Rougier was not offered a new contract, and instead signed with Brentford. Rougier played 34 games for Brentford in the 2003–04 season before switching to Bristol City in late March. On 2 May, his 21st-minute winner over Barnsley proved not enough to catch Queens Park Rangers, though the club had easily qualified for the play-offs. He scored the opener of the semi-final with Hartlepool United at Victoria Park, City winning 2–1 on aggregate, before falling 1–0 at the Millennium Stadium to his old club Brighton. He was then released by City. After a short spell with Chinese club Nanjing Yoyo and speculation of signing with Northampton Town in September 2005, he spent a brief period in the USA with USL Pro club Rochester Rhinos. He ended his playing career back in Trinidad with United Petrotrin, before becoming Technical Advisor at North East Stars under manager David Farrell in 2008. In 2009, he co-founded FC South End, which is the newest club to compete in the TT Pro League. In July 2009, he registered himself as a player-coach in order to boost the fortunes of his struggling side. International career Rougier earned 67 caps for the Trinidad and Tobago national team between 1995 and 2005, scoring five goals. He served as captain on numerous occasions. During this time his country won the Caribbean Cup in 1996 and 1999, beating Cuba on home soil in the final on both occasions. They also reached the final in 1998, but were beaten 2–1 by Jamaica. He was also in the squad for the 1996 and 2000 editions of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. He was on the 24-man shortlist for the squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but was excluded from the final 23. Manager Leo Beenhakker said: \\"The guy worked fantastically and he did everything he had to do to try and make it and in the end I had to make a decision.\\" Personal life A \\"proud and passionate Christian\\", Rougier used to celebrate goals with a prayer. He advised good friend and fellow footballer Dwight Yorke to \\"calm down a bit with the ladies\\" following Yorke's love life being splashed across the British tabloids. He grew up next door to cricketer Gus Logie and worked at an airport in New York City before trying his luck with football in England. Rougier is a lifelong teetotaler. On multiple occasions during his playing career, he was awarded a bottle of champagne for winning the man of the match award, only to refuse it and hand it back to the organisers. His family include wife Trisha and daughters Alishia-Kae and Maya- Kai.

Background He was bred and raced by Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, a member of the prominent horse-racing Whitney family. Out of the mare Swanky, whose damsire Mahmoud won the 1936 Epsom Derby, he was sired by Whitney's Phalanx, the 1947 Belmont Stakes winner and American Champion Three- Year-Old Male Horse. Career Boy was trained by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Sylvester Veitch. Racing career At age two, Career Boy won important races such as the Grand Union Hotel Stakes and the United States Hotel Stakes. He ran second to Needles in the Hopeful Stakes, then had another second-place result in the Garden State Stakes to winner Prince John but ahead of third-place finisher Needles. Going into his three-year-old season in 1956, Career Boy was assigned the Experimental Free Handicap's 126 pound high- weight. Under jockey Eric Guerin, Career Boy won the Gotham Stakes and ran second in the Blue Grass Stakes en route to a sixth-place finish in the 1956 Kentucky Derby. He did not run in the Preakness Stakes, but in the ensuing Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, he made a powerful stretch run to finish a neck second to Needles with Preakness winner Fabius in third. In September 1956, Career Boy showed an affinity for racing on the grass with a one-length win under jockey Sam Boulmetis in the United Nations Handicap at Atlantic City Racecourse. Owner C. V. Whitney then decided to send his top two runners to Longchamp Racecourse in Paris, France, to run in the prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Entered with stablemate Fisherman and with Eddie Arcaro riding, Career Boy finished fourth in the 1956 Arc to Ribot. Career Boy's 1956 performances earned him American Champion Male Turf Horse honors. Stud record Retired to stud duty, Career Boy stood in the United States until age thirteen when he was sent to a breeding operation in Argentina. He was not successful as a sire.

The regiment served in the Army of the Potomac in the Eastern Theater and was heavily engaged in the second day of fighting at the Peach Orchard outside of Gettysburg. History The regiment was organized in August 1862, with Henry J. Madill as colonel, Guy H. Watkins as lieutenant colonel, and Israel P. Spalding as major. It was sent to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where it was organized at Camp Curtin. After a couple of weeks, it was sent to picket the Potomac River in the area of Poolesville, Maryland. The regiment became part of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of the III Corps. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, the regiment formed part of the force which engaged the Confederate right flank but lost few men. After the battle, the regiment went into winter quarters, but in the spring of 1863 was heavily engaged at the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1–3, 1863, suffering over 50% casualties. At the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863, the unit was detached from the rest of the brigade and sent to the southern part of the Peach Orchard. There, the 141st helped repel the attack of Brigadier General Joseph B. Kershaw's South Carolina Brigade. However, shortly after this the Peach Orchard salient began to collapse. Separated from the rest of its brigade, the regiment never received orders to withdraw and stayed in line of battle near the Peach Orchard. Possibly because of the thick battle smoke, the regiment did not fire on the approaching brigade of Brigadier General William Barksdale. The 141st suffered a devastating volley at close range from one of Barksdale's Mississippi regiments, and after a brief resistance withdrew towards Cemetery Ridge with a loss of almost 70% of its members. Of 209 men present for roll- call earlier in the day, 149 were killed, wounded, or missing in action. Following the Gettysburg Campaign, the regiment fought in the Bristoe Station Campaign, seeing action at the Battle of Auburn Bridge, one of the final actions fought by the III Corps before its incorporation into the II Corps. The regiment received many replacements over the winter. In 1864, the regiment fought in the Battle of the Wilderness (May 6–7, 1864), the Battle of Spotsylvania (May 11–12, 1864), and at the Battle of Petersburg (June 18, 1864). The regiment then took part in the Siege of Petersburg. The 141st participated in the final campaign of the Army of the Potomac and fought at the Battle of Sayler's Creek on March 25, 1865, and again at the Battle of Farmville (April 6–7, 1865). The 141st was present at the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House. The regiment participated in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington and was mustered out on May 29, 1865.

Prucalopride was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2009, in Canada in 2011, in Israel in 2014, and in the United States in December 2018. The drug has also been tested for the treatment of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.  Medical uses  The primary measure of efficacy in the clinical trials is three or more spontaneous complete bowel movements per week; a secondary measure is an increase of at least one complete spontaneous bowel movement per week. Further measures are improvements in PAC-QOL (a quality of life measure) and PAC-SYM (a range of stool, abdominal, and rectal symptoms associated with chronic constipation). Infrequent bowel movements, bloating, straining, abdominal pain, and defecation urge with inability to evacuate can be severe symptoms, significantly affecting quality of life. In three large clinical trials, 12 weeks of treatment with prucalopride 2 and 4 mg/day resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients reaching the primary efficacy endpoint of an average of ≥3 spontaneous complete bowel movements than with placebo. There was also significantly improved bowel habit and associated symptoms, patient satisfaction with bowel habit and treatment, and HR-QOL in patients with severe chronic constipation, including those who did not experience adequate relief with prior therapies (>80% of the trial participants). The improvement in patient satisfaction with bowel habit and treatment was maintained during treatment for up to 24 months; prucalopride therapy was generally well tolerated.  Contraindications  Prucalopride is contraindicated where there is hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, renal impairment requiring dialysis, intestinal perforation or obstruction due to structural or functional disorder of the gut wall, obstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon/megarectum.  Side effects  Prucalopride has been given orally to ~2700 patients with chronic constipation in controlled clinical trials. The most frequently reported side effects are headache and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea). Such reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment.  Mechanism of action  Prucalopride, a first in class dihydro-benzofuran-carboxamide, is a selective, high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist with enterokinetic activities.SmPC. Summary of product characteristics Resolor (prucalopride) October, 2009: 1-9. Prucalopride alters colonic motility patterns via serotonin 5-HT4 receptor stimulation: it stimulates colonic mass movements, which provide the main propulsive force for defecation. The observed effects are exerted via highly selective action on 5-HT4 receptors: prucalopride has >150-fold higher affinity for 5-HT4 receptors than for other receptors. Prucalopride differs from other 5-HT4 agonists such as tegaserod and cisapride, which at therapeutic concentrations also interact with other receptors (5-HT1B/D and the cardiac human ether-a-go-go K+ or hERG channel respectively) and this may account for the adverse cardiovascular events that have resulted in the restricted availability of these drugs. Clinical trials evaluating the effect of prucalopride on QT interval and related adverse events have not demonstrated significant differences compared with placebo.  Pharmacokinetics  Prucalopride is rapidly absorbed (Cmax attained 2–3 hours after single 2 mg oral dose) and is extensively distributed. Metabolism is not the major route of elimination. In vitro, human liver metabolism is very slow and only minor amounts of metabolites are found. A large fraction of the active substance is excreted unchanged (about 60% of the administered dose in urine and at least 6% in feces). Renal excretion of unchanged prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Plasma clearance averages 317 ml/min, terminal half-life is 24–30 hours, and steady-state is reached within 3–4 days. On once daily treatment with 2 mg prucalopride, steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/ml, respectively. In vitro data indicate that prucalopride has a low interaction potential, and therapeutic concentrations of prucalopride are not expected to affect the CYP-mediated metabolism of co-medicated medicinal products.  Approval  In the European Economic Area, prucalopride was originally approved for the symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief. Subsequently, it has been approved by the European Commission for use in adults – that is, including male patients – for the same indication.

Background René de Latour was born in 42nd Street, New York. His father was French, born in Lyon, and his mother Belgian, from Verviers. The family returned to France at the start of World War I, when de Latour was eight. He never lost a slight American accent when he spoke English. The war was an exciting time for a young boy and de Latour made the most of that and his freedom. In 1917 he met American soldiers in Paris and became their interpreter and guide. He took them to the Folies Bergère when he was 11.Woodland, Les (2003), Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France, Yellow Jersey, UK p. 113 His American links gave him an interest in baseball but it was cycling that filled his life. Cycling The venue for cycle-racing in the centre of Paris was the Vélodrome d'Hiver, an indoor track close to the Eiffel Tower. There he met the Canadian star, Willie Spencer, becoming not just interpreter and guide but his odd-job boy, or runner, during races. He boasted that that was the last time he ever paid to enter the velodrome. De Latour shared a bike with his brother until he was 15. The next year he saved for his own and then joined the Club Sportif de Montrouge, in southern Paris. He became a modest racer but nothing better. At 20, French law gave him the opportunity to decide his nationality. He could be American through his birth in the USA or French through his father. He chose to be French and spent 18 months in the army. He returned to the Vel' d'Hiv' on leaving national service and again looked after Americans, including the motor-paced champion, Charlie Jaeger. That brought him a job with Reggie McNamara during six-day racesSporting Cyclist, UK, November 1967, p. 26 and eventually as trainer, or at any rate advisor, to Hubert Opperman in the Tour de France. It was in the Vel' d'Hiv, according to a report in The Bicycle that \\"Latour, cycling reporter\\" was held with other cycling officials and journalists as a suspected collaborator during the German occupation of France between 1940 and 1944.The Bicycle, 18 October 1944, p. 6 Journalism René de Latour's byline first appeared in Paris-Soir in 1932. He was recruited by the chief cycling writer, Gaston Benac. He helped Benac find the route for the first Grand Prix des Nations. He moved to L'Équipe, for which he not only wrote but directed the Tour de l'Avenir for 10 years. He said the highlight of his career was being taken for dinner by Fausto Coppi and hearing from him of his dispute and rivalry with Gino Bartali. Personality Jock Wadley, who recruited de Latour for Sporting Cyclist and took him to International Cycle Sport after Sporting Cyclist 's closure, described de Latour as \\"an undemonstrative man who may appear sullen. His humour is dry and, to an Englishman, rather stern;\\" The British journalist Ron White once asked de Latour what happened to the British riders in the Tour de l'Avenir. De Latour answered, without looking up: \\"I don't know - I wasn't that far back.\\" De Latour often travelled by scooter, usually a Vespa. He paced Fausto Coppi during his warm-up for the world hour record at the Vigorelli track in Milan. De Latour was the last editor of Vespa Journal while he was still working at L'Équipe He wrote a novel, Le Mort mène le Peloton (death leads the race) in 1951 and, in English, World Champions I Have KnownKennedy Brothers, UK, 1970, ASIN: B0006C6X8K Retirement and death De Latour retired at the start of the 1980s to a cottage with a library in Quiberon.

Israt Manzil was one of the royal residences of the Nawabs of Dhaka. The mansion served as a retreat for members of the Dhaka Nawab Family. Israt Manzil is best known for hosting the opening session of the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in 1906. The conference, sponsored by Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah, the Nawab of Dhaka, established the All India Muslim League, the first Muslim political party of the Indian Subcontinent. The party, which became the prime platform for Indian Muslims and led to the creation of Pakistan, was formed against the backdrop of political agitation by the Indian National Congress against the 1905 Partition of Bengal. During the durbar at Israt Manzil palace, delegates debated the new name to be given to the political party. A party styled as All India Muslim Confederacy was discussed. But, in the process the name All India Muslim League, proposed by Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur and seconded by Hakim Ajmal Khan, was resolved in the meeting. In 1912, a delegation led by Baron Hardinge of Penshurst, the Viceroy of India, met with Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah. During the meeting, Sir Salimullah demanded the establishment of a university for the mainly Muslim people of eastern Bengal. The demands would be realised with the establishment of the University of Dhaka in 1921. The present day Madhur Canteen, situated in the northeastern part of the Arts Faculty compound of Dhaka University was the Jalsaghar of this garden-house. The floor and the spacious surrounding area of the building were covered with marbles. The building was also called 'Skating Pavilion' since members of the Nawab family used to skate there.

The collection's focus includes materials that supported putting farmers first and increasing number of smallholder farmers and their heterogeneous livelihood systems on a global scale. One of the two core areas covered is the development over time of methods that help development professionals understand the livelihood of smallholder farming and its limited resource households. The second core area includes literature describing the diverse livelihood strategies of the households living in various parts of the world. These limited resource households represent nearly a billion people struggling to survive on a daily basis.

Preparation and structure Salcomine is commercially available. It may be synthesized from cobalt(II) acetate and salenH2. Salcomine crystallizes as a dimer. In this form, the cobalt centers achieve five-coordination via a bridging phenolate ligands. A monomeric form crystallizes with chloroform in the lattice. It features planar Co centers. Salcomine is both a Lewis acid and a reductant. Several solvated derivatives bind O2 to give derivatives of the type (μ-O2)[Co(salen)py]2 and [Co(salen)py(O2)]. Applications dmf)]2O2 The 1938 report that this compound reversibly bound O2 led to intensive research on this and related complexes for the storage or transport of oxygen.

Sprinkler systems installed by sprinkler fitters can include the underground supply as well as integrated systems and standpipes. The fire suppression piping may contain water, air (in a dry system), antifreeze, gas or chemicals as in a hood system, or a mixture producing fire retardant foam. Sprinkler fitters work with a variety of pipe and tubing materials including several types of plastic, copper, steel, cast iron, and ductile iron. Sprinkler fitters specialize in piping associated with fire sprinkler systems.

The two have been organizing indigenous communities in Ecuador to fight against international oil companies, in order to clean up devastated areas in the Ecuadorian jungle, which has become polluted from years of oil production. Yanza and Fajardo's publication of the environmental effects from oil production has led to stronger environmental protection laws in Ecuador. Legal action As president of the Frente de Defensa de la Amazonia, Yanza has spearheaded a multibillion-dollar class action lawsuit against Chevron- Texaco for its environmental damage in Ecuador. With Steven Donziger and others, he represented 30,000 indigenous people and farmers affected by the Lago Agrio oil field. Yanza stated that the \\"trial is not about accidental damages. We´re talking about harm to people and the environment that was done in a deliberate manner.\\" The Ecuadorian courts, which were originally requested by Chevron, ruled in favour of the plaintiffs on three occasions. After being ordered to pay $9.5 billion, Chevron refused and presented a defence that Ecuadorian judge Nicolás Zambrano accepted a $500,000 bribe in exchange for ruling against them. This was called into question in 2015 when Alberto Guerra, the alleged witness to the bribery, recanted. Notes References *Handler, Marisa. Loyal to the Sky: Notes from an Activist.

The males are from long and the female is from long. The flour mites are found in grain and may become exceedingly abundant in poorly stored material. The female produces large clutches of eggs and the life cycle takes just over two weeks.

After a while, predatory mites tend to move in, and these keep the flour mites under control. Flour mites that contaminate grains, flour and animal feedstuffs, create allergens in the dust produced, and also transfer pathogenic microorganisms. Foodstuffs acquire a sickly sweet smell and an unpalatable taste. When fed infested feeds, animals show reduced feed intake, diarrhea, inflammation of the small intestine, and impaired growth. Pigs have their live-weight gain, feed-to-gain ratio, and nitrogen retention markedly reduced by infested feeds. Flour mites are intentionally inoculated into Mimolette cheese to improve the flavor. When used for this purpose, they may be referred to as \\"cheese mites\\". The mites sometimes bite humans, which can cause an allergic reaction known as Baker's itch.

The Reagan Service was modeled on Woodrow Wilson's. Walter Scott Lenox was the American businessman who established Lenox china, supplying the first complete American-made bone china table service for Woodrow Wilson's White House. Biography Lenox resolved to become a potter early in his boyhood. Starting in 1875 at the age of sixteen he first worked for a number of Trenton potteries. By his early twenties he had developed an excellent reputation, and based on this he was hired by Ott and Brewer Pottery Company of Trenton, then Willetts Manufacturing, as its art design director.Trenton City Museum: History of Trenton Pottery Making Then he focused on ceramic design and decoration. When Lenox was thirty he had saved enough money to enter a partnership with Jonathan Coxon. They started a company called the Ceramic Art Company. Lenox wanted to be an expert in bone china. In the nineteenth century American pottery was inferior to European products. Lenox had three goals to accomplish for his goal to produce good quality bone china: # master the difficult bone china manufacturing techniques # obtain sufficient financial backing for his factory operations # overcome the wealthy’s prejudices against American bone china Ceramic Art Company struggled financially in its early years, with the material and labor costs exceeded their income. Lenox bought out Coxon’s interests in 1894, and subsequently he operated it on his own as Lenox's Ceramic Art Company. He concentrated on manufacturing Belleek style pottery, which is Parian ware produced in Belleek, Northern Ireland. Lenox hired two expert Belleck potters to help him master the technique. However, the troubled company went further in debt with the lack of sales and profits. He even had to consent to a new factory building being designed to allow it to be easily converted into an apartment building if the company failed. In the early 1900s Lenox's health began to decline, and he became paralyzed and partially blind. However, Lenox continued to work at the factory daily. His chauffeur carried him to his office where he began to monitor the production of porcelain with his hands. He relied heavily on trusting his assistant and secretary Harry Brown, a long-time employee. In 1906 Lenox established Lenox, Inc. Lenox’s company finally received a large order from a retailer, Shreve and Company. Soon after the delivery, the retailer’s store was leveled in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and everything destroyed, except for an undamaged single Lenox bone china plate. This plate became the cornerstone of Lenox's marketing campaign. Lenox made the first complete set American-made White House china table service, which was for President Woodrow Wilson.

History On June 22, 1960, at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Boulder, Colorado, Harvey Lance presented a paper titled \\"The Nation's Electronic Standards Program: Where Do We Stand?\\" suggesting the need for an organization of standards laboratories to promote cooperative efforts for solving the common problems faced by measurement and testing laboratories. The next morning a committee was formed to \\"investigate the possible organization, scope, and objectives appropriate for an organization of standards laboratories\\". September 15, 1961, the National Conference of Standards Laboratories (NCSL) was formally established with NBS as its sponsor. Primarily due to the growth and acquired ability of NCSL to run its own affairs, NBS (currently known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST) ended its sponsorship role in July 1986. The two agencies maintain a close and collaborative relationship. During the 1960s and early 1970s the Cold War climate caused a dilemma for NCSL which included many US aerospace and military facilities amongst its membership. There was concern over complying with US State Department regulations relating to technology transfer and discussion while allowing non-US entities to participate. NCSL considered national security a serious enough issue to warrant US-only membership. In 1974, however, the board of directors decided the substantial advantages of an open international membership outweighed the security considerations and NCSL enrollment was opened to non-US organizations. In 1975, Graham Cameron from the Canadian Department of National Defence became the first non-US delegate to serve on the board. In 1976 the first International Region was established. By 1996 non-US organizations comprised roughly 15% of the total membership.\\"A Narrative History of NCSLI; The Middle Years\\" NCSLI Newsletter July 2001:2 In the year 2000, NCSL began the process of formally changing its name to NCSL International to better represent its membership. Cooperative activities Annual conference The inclusion of \\"Conference\\" in NCSLI demonstrates the importance the organization's founders placed on convening periodic conferences. The annual NCSL International Workshop & Symposium is a four-day event held in late July/early August in a variety of locations. Papers are presented by speakers during technical sessions occurring throughout the conference. A Best Paper Award is given to the highest scoring presentation in several categories associated with the theme for that year. The Dr. Allen V. Astin Award is presented to the overall best paper. Two annual events are hosted by NCSL International. The first is a Technical Exchange, were tutorials had given on various Metrology Topics. The second is an annual Workshop & Symposium that includes an exhibit hall with over one hundred companies showcasing a variety of goods and services including calibration hardware and software, management tools, education and training organizations, calibration labs and accreditation services. Tutorials are offered two days before the start of the conference and one day following. Beyond technical information, the conference allows the opportunity to network with people who share common interests and numerous meetings are held by the board of directors and committees. Region/section meetings and committees NCSL International is organized in regions and sections around the world and each region/section is guided and directed by a volunteer coordinator. Meetings are held periodically as a way for professionals in the local metrology community to assemble, network and learn from each other. A typical meeting involves a tour of the host facility, speakers and presentations, exhibitors and updates from the region/section coordinator. A total of seventy-four national and international sections/regions were active in 2006.\\"The 1962 NCSLI Organizational Chart: For Contrast\\" NCSLI Newsletter July 2006:33 Committee participation enables members to confer with colleagues with common interests, similar challenges and solution strategies specific to their industry. Each committee is open to all members to volunteer, share ideas and work on projects. Some committees concentrate on the inner workings and business of NCSL International itself. This would include publication oversight, conference planning and site selection, by-laws and guidelines. Other committees were established for discipline-specific, special interest or industry groups. Under measurement science and technology, committees range in focus from automatic test and calibration systems to chemical and dimensional metrology; from deadweight pressure gauges to the triple point of argon. Industrial programs features committees for healthcare, airline, automotive, and small business metrology. Documentary standards encompass calibration systems, laboratory facilities, measurement decision risk, and accreditation resources. A total of sixty-two committees (in 2006), composed solely of volunteers, endeavor to advance the work of NCSL International. It is from the effort of these committees that all NCSL International published standards originate. Learning and development Education and outreach > \\"If you talk to almost any person involved in the metrology profession about > new talent entering the field, you'll probably get the same response: 'There > are not enough young people entering the field to replace the many baby > boomers getting ready to retire.'\\" -Christopher L. GrachanenGrachanen, > Christopher L., June 2007, The Metrology Job Description Initiative: NCSLI > and ASQ-MQD Partnering for the Future, NCSL International Measure Vol.2 > NO.2, pg 26 A search of the US Department of Labor Standard Occupational Classification System (SOC) will result in few references to metrology. Although it does contain a listing for 'metrologist', this has been deemed grossly inadequate by those employed in the profession.Grachanen, Christopher L., June 2007, The Metrology Job Description Initiative: NCSLI and ASQ Partnering for the Future, NCSL International Measure Vol.2 NO.2, pg 26 The SOC is the basis for the Occupational Outlook Handbook, a publication of the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, accepted as a reference for guidance counselors, job seekers and those planning a career path. In a joint effort between ASQ-MQD and NCSLI a survey was conducted to generate job titles with descriptions within the field of metrology. The titles proposed are, in general order of hierarchy: Calibration Technician, Calibration Engineer, and Metrologist. Application has been filed to include this data in the SOC update of 2010. The aim is to increase awareness amongst new talent that may be interested in joining the metrological profession. To further the goal of encouraging interest in metrology as a career, NCSL International supports scholarships to institutions and individuals. The general scholarship program awards money to accredited schools that offer metrology education. NCSLI is also an institutional sponsor, along with ASQ-MQD and the Measurement Science Conference, of the Joe D Simmons Memorial Scholarship given to individuals with a strong academic record and an interest in measurement science. NCSLI applied for and received inclusion in the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). Workplace and professional development The NCSL International business office located in Boulder, CO maintains a training facility and a multimedia training aids library covering both technical and managerial topics. The annual conference offers technical sessions covering up-to-date information as well as more detailed half or full day tutorials. Available more locally, region/section meetings feature speakers and Regional Training Events provide both classroom and hands on learning. Further, NCSLI supports management and human resource departments by clarifying job descriptions and career paths, providing information on appropriate certifications and qualifications and by awarding continuing education units or CEU's for attending and completing many of the development opportunities offered. Publications Periodicals NCSLI Measure, The Journal of Measurement Science (ISSN 19315775) is a scientific and technical journal published quarterly by NSCL International. Measure is written primarily for metrology professionals in calibrations laboratories, such as lab managers, engineers and technicians. Issues are composed of peer-reviewed technical articles and up-to-date information on calibration techniques, uncertainty analysis, measurement standards, quality processes and laboratory accreditation. NCSL International also publishes Metrologist, NCSLI Worldwide News () to provide news and information about the organization and its members. Metrologist is a glossy quarterly containing reports and updates from committees, regions and the board of directors, and featuring member news and trade information. The first Newsletter was printed June 1, 1962 and contained six pages. The Newsletter increased in content and became the primary communication tool of NCSL until 2007 when it was discontinued. Metrologist was designed as an extended successor of the NCSL Newsletter. Standards As committees address various issues it sometimes becomes apparent that other metrologists would be interested in the result of their investigations. This often leads to publications including: recommended practices (RP), recommended intrinsic/derived standards practices (RISP), or laboratory management publications (LMP). NCSL International also writes and/or adopts national standards as a standards writing body recognized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Of these RP-1 (Establishment and Adjustment of Calibration Intervals), RP-6 (Calibration Control Systems for the Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Industry), RP-7 (Laboratory Design), RP-14 (Guide to Selecting Standards-Laboratory Environments) and ANSI/NCSL Z540 (US Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) are referenced in the metrology textbook The Metrology Handbook.Bucher, Jay L.,Editor, The Metrology Handbook, 2004, pgs 19,29,37,41-42,48,61,90,95,99,103-104,138,305,318-319,444-445,471,476,486; References  External links  * Category:Metrology Category:International professional associations Category:Standards organizations in the United States Category:International organizations based in the United States ","title":"NCSL International"},{"id":"20257152","text":"Akris is a Swiss fashion house specializing in luxury goods for women designed by creative director Albert Kriemler.

Albert Kriemler Expands Akris's Global Footprint (November 19, 2015) Akris's success is largely due to trunk shows and word of mouth; the company does very little advertising. Unlike other fashion houses, the company does not produce fragrances and does not license its name. Akris have a reputation for working with artists. Two notable examples have been a collaboration with the German photographer Thomas Ruff and separately the British painter David Wightman. Campaigns Renowned photographer Steven Klein has shot the Akris collections for fifteen years. Sales and stores Akris is the largest Swiss clothing producer, though it does not disclose sales or profit figures. Its value has been reported as approximately US$500 million; the company has not disputed this figure, but the number may be an overestimate \\"judging from [Albert] Kriemler's response when that number is tossed out. The brand is sold in more than 300 locations worldwide. Approximately 40% of Akris sales are in North America.Socha, Miles. \\"Akris names Brown U.S. chief\\". Women's Wear Daily (November 13, 2006). Akris was first sold in the United States in 1988; the brand can now be found in 70 U.S. stores, including over 20 Neiman Marcus locations and 30-some Saks Fifth Avenue locations, where Akris shares floor space with brands like Bottega Veneta, Fendi and Lanvin. Freestanding Akris boutiques are located in Boston, New York City, Atlanta, Palm Beach, Bal Harbor, Dallas and Houston. Akris Punto is sold in approximately 100 stores in the United States.

The design process begins with the fabric; Kriemler then sketches his designs. Akris fabrics are often custom-produced; sometimes, development of a fabric may take years. Most of the fabrics used in Akris clothing are produced in specialized mills in northern Italy. Akris clothing is generally produced in ateliers in St. Gallen, Zurich, and Ticino, Switzerland. Kriemler has aimed to continue St. Gallen's textile-based history by hiring local artisans. About half of the company's 280 manufacturing employees are highly skilled artisans; two years of training are required for a seamstress to master the hand-finishing of Akris's double-faced cashmere jackets, each of which requires two and a half days to complete.

Devereux had played for the Worcestershire Second XI since 1959, but his first-class debut had to wait until May 1963, when he was selected to face Middlesex at Lord's. He top-scored with 22 not out from number eight in Worcestershire's painful first-innings progress to 79 all out in 55.4 overs, then took 0/49 with the ball; the game was drawn. He stayed in the side until the middle of June, playing along the way in his only List A game, a Gillette Cup quarter- final in which he made an important 30 from number nine, and making his only first-class half-century, 55* against Cambridge University; he also took his best innings figures of 3/44 in that game. but then a paucity of wickets forced him back to the seconds. There, he still found it hard at first to take wickets, though he did score a couple of fifties. However, in July Devereux took ten wickets in the match against Kent II, and seven more wickets in the next match, against Essex II, propelled him back into the first team before the month was out. Not for long, however: once more he struggled to take wickets, and after he had taken none at all in three successive games against Essex, Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire he was back in the Second XI.

Since her launch, the ship has been registered under the Liberian flag and homeported in Monrovia. Incidents and accidents Hijacking On 17 November 2008, the U.S. Navy announced Sirius Star was hijacked by Somali pirates. Lt. Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, said the pirates hijacked the very large crude carrier at about 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, 15 November, while she was southbound, about southeast of the coast of Kenya at — the farthest out to sea Somali pirates have struck. The attack also made Sirius Star the largest vessel ever to be hijacked. It is estimated that for the pirates to reach Sirius Star, they must have voyaged south for three to four days. At the time of the attack, the ship was carrying a full load of of crude oil more than one-quarter of Saudi Arabia's daily oil production output, and worth at least and was bound for the United States via the Cape of Good Hope. According to officials from Puntland, the pirates anchored Sirius Star at the Somali port of Harardhere, contrary to early reports from the United States Navy that she was anchored near Eyl. As a result of the full load of cargo, the height from the main deck to the waterline was relatively low; if the reported draft was correct, her freeboard was about . Ships in this low-freeboard condition are easier to climb aboard and thus easier targets for pirates. The 25 member crew, consisting of 19 Filipinos, 2 Britons, 2 Poles, 2 Croat and 1 Saudi Arabian, were reported to be safe. On 18 November 2008, Polish media confirmed that the two Polish officers on board were the Captain Marek Niski and technical officer Leszek Adler. On 19 November 2008, Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office named two of the British officers aboard the vessel: Chief Engineer Peter French of County Durham and second officer James Grady of Strathclyde. On 18 November 2008 the pirates opened negotiations with Vela. In a press release dated that day, Vela stated that all crewmembers were safe. In the same press release, the company said it was working towards a \\"safe and speedy return\\" of all crewmembers, leaving open the possibility of ransom payment. Ransom demand and deadline Ransom being dropped by parachute on 9 January 2009 On 19 November, the alleged pirate, Farah Abd Jameh, provided information regarding the ransom by audio tape broadcast over Al-Jazeera television. The tape specified that an unspecified cash ransom was to be delivered to Sirius Star, where it would be counted using machines that were able to detect counterfeit bills. On 20 November, the pirates demanded a ransom having set a 10-day deadline. Mohamed Said stated: \\"We do not want long-term discussions to resolve the matter. The Saudis have 10 days to comply, otherwise we will take action that could be disastrous.\\" The then Foreign Secretary David Miliband ruled out the UK paying any form of ransom, saying \\"There is a strong view of the British Government, and actually the international community, that payments for hostage-taking are only an encouragement to further hostage-taking.\\" By 24 November, the pirates had reduced their ransom demand to US$15 million. A small faction of Somali Islamic rebels planned to attack Sirius Star to liberate her from her hijackers. The faction's planned attack on the hijackers is seen in retaliation for them seizing a \\"Muslim\\" vessel. Locals in Harardhere have said the threats of attack from Islamic militants have forced the pirates to leave the port and remain approximately offshore. A spokesman for the Islamic rebel group, Abdirahim Isse Adow, stated \\"We are against this act and we shall hunt the ship wherever she sails, and free it.\\" Ransom and release Sirius Star was freed On 9 January 2009 after a US$3 million ransom payment. Five of the \\"dozens\\" of pirates drowned after their small boat capsized in a storm after leaving Sirius Star with their share of the ransom. The body of one of the pirates that drowned later washed ashore with US$153,000 in cash in a plastic bag. After her release, Sirius Star sailed to the port of Fujairah in the UAE, and the crew was replaced. Effects of the hijacking After hijack the vessel was anchored at Harardhere, Somalia The attack came soon after naval forces from NATO, Russia, and India began to patrol the Horn of Africa region, in response to hijacking seven weeks earlier and many other incidents. However, these patrols focus further north, especially near the Gulf of Aden, and the attack came as a surprise. A British intelligence expert commented that \\"there will never be enough warships\\" to secure so much of the Indian Ocean by patrol. This attack has shown that the pirates are now operating in an area of over 2.8 million square kilometers (1.1 million square miles), which extends beyond the recently established international patrols closer to the Horn of Africa. News of the attack raised crude oil prices on global markets.

Number 0800 556 557 National Accident Helpline is part of the NAHL Group PLC and is run on a for-profit basis. NAHL and its panel of solicitors process compensation claims on a no win no fee agreement, removing the financial risk from making a claim. Any solicitor fees are then taken from a claimant's compensation if they win.  History  The National Accident Helpline was formed in 1993 by two businessmen, Alan Kennedy and Paul Follett, along with the Northampton legal firm Tollers. In 2006, Lloyds TSB Development Capital (LDC), the private equity arm of the Lloyds TSB Group, backed a management buyout enabling Kennedy to buy out Tollers and other shareholders. LDC later sold part of its stake to Inflexion Private Equity. In April 2008, National Accident Helpline released an SMS callback service on a platform provided by SMSshortcode.co.uk. The following month, the personal injury claims management company revealed a new version of the company website, featuring an interactive no win no fee compensation calculator. February 2009 saw National Accident Helpline listed in the Sunday Times Deloitte Buyout Track 100 for the first time. In 2012, the company was listed in 70th place with year-on-year growth from 2010/11 to 2011/12 cited as 32%. Specialist claims websites National Accident Helpline also owns no-win-no- fee.co.uk and Benchmark Insurance. In 2010 it started advertising through underdog.co.uk. In April 2010, National Accident Helpline published three new specialist claims websites: industrial-accident.co.uk, work-accident.co.uk and clinical-medical-negligence.co.uk. In October 2011, the company announced mobile-friendly versions of its two core websites, National Accident Helpline and underdog.co.uk. Marketing National Accident Helpline initially found its clients by advertising in the press. It was then one of the first claims companies to use television advertising, and this became its main source of business in the 2000s. The company's television adverts have been one of its most visible sources of marketing. The adverts feature a character called Underdog, who is voiced by UK actor Joe Pasquale. More recent adverts have included musical backing tracks, including Chumbawamba's 1997 hit \\"Tubthumping\\" and a version of Marvin Gaye's \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" where the chorus lyrics had been changed to include the brand name. Stance against cold calling National Accident Helpline displays a clear policy against cold calling, cold texting and nuisance marketing on its website. National Accident Helpline has never cold called and in December 2014 the personal injury advice service confirmed it would no longer be contacting prospective customers by email. The firm states that any incident of cold- calling under its name has no connection with the real National Accident Helpline. It also asks victims of cold calling to report any incidents where the victim has been contacted by imposters posing as National Accident Helpline.  Ethical Marketing Charter  In July 2015, National Accident Helpline founded the Ethical Marketing Charter alongside seven other personal injury firms. By November 2016, the total number of signatories stood at over 50 firms. The Ethical Marketing Charter encourages companies in the personal injury sector to stand against cold calling and spam marketing by signing up to a series of commitments against nuisance marketing practices. National Accident Helpline also recently published findings on the impact of cold calling on the UK economy. Adverts National Accident Helpline was the first personal injury company to advertise in the press in 1994 and on television in 1997. The first set used from 1997 to 1999 featured the spokeswoman (Teresa Quigley) telling people that if they had an accident which wasn't their fault, they could be entitled to compensation. As she continues, two people are shown with their name tag and how much they earned in compensation. In 1999, people took on a more active role, still featuring the same spokeswoman at the start and end, as they shared their story of accidents and what the company did to earn them their compensation. From 2002 up to 2009, the most familiar set of adverts aired. They featured actors recreating scenes where they have an accident and said how much money they earned in compensation and how they earned it with no problems at all. The advert then ends once again with the spokeswoman. The most famous one includes a woman named Katy Freeman, whose advert is the longest-running of all appearing from 2003 and edited occasionally until 2009, who was walking into an office reception and did not know the floor was wet because there was no warning sign. As a result, she slipped and injured her knee. She then explains how worried she was about claiming, but was assured by the National Accident Helpline that they run on a no-win, no fee basis and got £5,000 in compensation. She is known for her fringe, which had been parodied by many. Another features a man named David Morris, who was unaware he received the wrong type of ladder whilst installing a fire alarm system in a house wall. The ladder slipped as he drilled and fell off, resulting in his left arm crushed and right shoulder dislocated. He received £7,500 in compensation, concluding he didn't even have to go to court. Three new adverts began airing from 2006 in a modified format. Beginning with the accident with no name tag featuring the spokeswoman again and going back to the victim, saying how much they earned in compensation and what happened afterward. The Freeman and Morris adverts were re-edited to include the modified logo and music (except the last ten seconds faded out into the old jingle) while the others were dropped. All five were edited again in 2008 to feature another new logo and animation at the end. Alongside the 2008 set, some new adverts aired featuring the spokeswoman (her last set of adverts) surrounded by accidents happening in reverse with the tagline \\"Accidents devastate lives, but who can help put the pieces back together again?\\" The adverts aired during late 2008 and throughout 2009 and are based on the same style used by Claims Direct for their adverts in 2001. From 2010, adverts for National Accident Helpline no longer had the spokeswoman and instead took on a humorous tone. It features a dog known as Underdog (voiced by Joe Pasquale) trying to get compensation from an unseen man (voiced by Brian Blessed) who rejects him. Underdog then says he will go to National Accident Helpline instead; the unseen man tries to convince him to go to him instead, which Underdog refuses. As part of the company rebrand in 2017, adverts now focused on real calls taken from the company by accident victims explaining their story along with the caller telling them they'll look into the claim more. The ads feature the tagline \\"When it's wrong, make it right\\" Charity partnerships National Accident Helpline has been involved in a number of charity partnerships. It was announced in April 2014 that National Accident Helpline's new company charity was The Air Ambulance Service The Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT), a member of The Disabilities Trust, was the company's charity for the year 2010-2011. National Accident Helpline's employees have also been involved in a number of charity ventures. A team of four senior employees ran the 2010 London Marathon in aid of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, raising over £6000. Staff have also raised money for BIRT.

Early life Ysmael Yrastorza Yuzon was born on November 22, 1983 in Manila, Philippines. His elder brother is Yan Yuzon (of the bands Pupil and Archipelago) and he has a younger sister named Ysabel. His mother Elsa is a retired flight attendant and his father Johnny, a retired accountant. He is of Basque origin, as his grandfather was an immigrant from Gipuzkoa, Spain. He is a first cousin of Filipino singer and actress Donna Cruz. Yuzon graduated from Ateneo de Manila University with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature. Career It all started in 1998 when Gosh Dilay and Yael Yuzon spotted each other in Ateneo High School and met through the theater club, Teatro Baguntao. Yuzon was the front man of a rock band named White Chapel at that time. However, since he and Gosh Dilay met, he always felt the urge to form a new band with Dilay and two other members of the group. That was then they form a band and call it \\"Sponge\\", named after R. S. Surtee's Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour. However, soon after they formed Sponge, they learned about a Detroit grunge band already is using the name Sponge, that's why they all agree to add \\"cola\\" in result of \\"Sponge Cola.\\" It gives their band name more semblances. This paved Yuzon's way to fame and the popularity of the band, as they competed and won several recognitions. After a few years, Yuzon and Gosh Dilay remained in the band while the two other members leave and were replaced by Christopher \\"Chris\\" Cantada and Erwin \\"Armo\\" Armovit. Armovit was a former guitarist of the band Rampqueen, considered the sister band of Sponge Cola. Yuzon's career started early, though. His fame being the lead rock vocalist of the band has earned him many credits and awards as well. He and his bandmates came up with a self-titled EP in the last quarter of 2003. This is enclosed with five original songs namely, \\"Saturn,\\" “Cigarette,\\" “Jeepney,\\" “Lunes,\\" and \\"A Tear.\\" These extensive songs have opened Yuzon's ability to adjust his vocal range to shift from mellow to scream o tone without losing its touch. With their self-titled EP, he was able to get more shows, exposures, and concerts from all over the country. Yael Yuzon portrays as Eli in 2014 horror film Shake, Rattle & Roll XV. Yuzon, too, managed to sing a version of Madonna’s \\"Crazy for You\\", which then became such an admired underground internet hit. The favorable response from the public further led Yuzon and his band mates to larger opportunities. The band's breakthrough in the mainstream was when they signed up for a record distribution under Sony BMG Records Philippines in their first full-length debut album. The band is now currently signed up for Universal Records. The song \\"Tambay\\", which Yuzon co-wrote with Dilay, receives an outstanding Diamond record award with over 150,000 copies sold. Personal life Yuzon was rumored to have dated singer-actress Karylle around 2010. In early 2011, both Yuzon and Karylle denied their relationship and have been rather evasive when it comes to said topic. By 2012, the two became more open about their relationship. On February 8, 2014, Karylle announced through It's Showtime that they are already engaged and their wedding is already set within March. On March 21, 2014, Singer-actress Karylle married Yuzon in an afternoon ceremony attended by family and friends at the San Antonio de Padua Church in Silang, Cavite.

Sponge Cola's debut album Palabas, was released in 2004 under Sony BMG, spawning radio hits like \\"KLSP\\", \\"Gemini\\", and \\"Jeepney\\". Sponge Cola's acoustic live cover of the Madonna classic \\"Crazy for You\\" gained popularity among fans and casual listeners after it became an Internet download favorite. Right after finishing college, the quartet immediately dished out their second record, Transit, under Universal Records in 2006. The album found a more focused unit as proven by the strong radio singles like the anthemic \\"Bitiw\\", \\"Tuliro\\" and \\"Pasubali\\".

Sponge Cola's eponymous third album under Universal Records was released on September 19, 2008 and launched on September 26 at Eastwood in Libis Quezon City. Cantada's departure however was done gradually because he was still in the band's fouthcoming videos and TV appearances meant to promote new records. Sponge Cola hired session drummers to fill in Cantada's slot during live gigs, until Tedmark Cruz was officially announced as the new drummer in 2009. Solo After leaving Sponge Cola for three years due to health problems, Cantada released his solo debut album entitled Heartbeat (all songs written by Cantada himself), distributed under Universal Records and co- produced by Yael Yuzon.

At various times in their history, they were associated with the neighboring Atakapa and Chitimacha peoples. The name Opelousa has been thought to have many meanings, but the one most commonly accepted is \\"Blackleg.\\" The tribe was known for painting or staining their lower legs a dark color.Hebert, Rev. Donald J., \\"Appendix C: Rummaging through old church records of Opelousas\\", Southwest Louisiana Records, Vol 1B, Complete Revision, 1996. p. 762. Michel De Birotte, who lived in Louisiana from 1690 to 1734, about forty years of which he spent living among the Indians, said the Appalousa lived just west of two small lakes. This description is thought to apply to Leonard Swamp (east of present-day Opelousas). During the period, this was the westernmost channel of the Mississippi River. Because of mineral deposits and the great number of leaves covering the bottom, the waters of the lake appeared black. The Appalousa who hunted and fished in the lake found their legs became stained black from these waters. Language Dr. John Sibley reported in an 1805 letter to Thomas Jefferson that the Opelousa spoke a language different from all others but many understood Atakapa (itself a language isolate) and French. (This area had been colonized by the French since the mid-eighteenth century.) Their language is completely undocumented. In the early twentieth century, anthropologists John R. Swanton and Frederick W. Hodge tentatively classified the Opelousa language as Atakapa. References *Goddard, Ives.

It took its name from the town of Amboise in Touraine. The house of Amboise formed the two branches of Thouars (extinct in 1469 in the house of La Trémoille) and Chaumont (extinct in 1525) that gave the branches of Bussy (extinct in 1515) and Aubijoux (extinct in 1656).Père Anselme de Sainte-Marie \\"Histoire généalogique et chronologique de la maison royale de France...\\" 1733, volume 7, page 119 to 129 : Généalogie de la maison d’Amboise. Cardinal Georges d'Amboise (1460–1510) was the son of Pierre d'Amboise, Seigneur de Chaumont. History Origins First house of Amboise (circa 1100-extinct in 1255) The first house of Amboise was founded in the eleventh century by Lisois, who was appointed as captain of the castle of Amboise by Foulk III Nerra, Count of Anjou. Geoffrey II, Count of Anjou gave to Lisois some Lands in Amboise to reward him. Lisois became lord of Amboise and died about 1061. His grandson Hugues I of Amboise became in 1107 the only lord of Amboise. Second house of Amboise (1255-extinct 1656) Renaud lord of Berrie in Loudunnois who was living in 1206 (grandson of Pierre lord of Berrie living in 1100) married Marguerite d'Amboise, daughter of Hugues III lord of Amboise. The second house of Amboise was founded by Jean of Berrie, his son, who succeeded to the lords of Amboise and Chaumont sur Loire in 1255, after the death of his cousin Mahaud lady of Amboise, Countess of Chartres, daughter of Sulpice III Lord of Amboise. Jean of Berrie took the name & arms of Amboise and died in his castle of Berrie in 1274. His descendants formed the two branches of the house of Amboise : Thouars and Chaumont. The history of the first house of Amboise is told in the Book of the Construction of the Castle of Amboise and the Deeds of Its Lords. Branch of Thouars (elder) Françoise of Amboise (1427-1485) duchess of Brittany. This elder branch was founded by Pierre II of Amboise, who became Viscount of Thouars in 1397 after the death of Perronelle of Thouars, his maternal aunt. His mother was Isabelle of Thouars, Countess of Dreux, daughter of Louis Viscount of Thouars and Jeanne Countess of Dreux. The branch of Thouars ended in 1470 by the death of Louis of Amboise who had no son.Père Anselme de Sainte-Marie \\"Histoire généalogique et chronologique de la maison royale de France...\\" 1733, volume 7, page 119 to 129 : Généalogie de la maison d’Amboise.

Most of the congregation had immigrated from either Germany or Poland and had already spent several decades in the American West. By now rather assimilated to American ways, they adopted the Reform prayerbook Minhag America, used both English and Hebrew in their services, seated both sexes together, and followed San Francisco's Congregation Emanu-El in using an organ during services. They observed each holiday for a single day, rather than the two days observed by the Orthodox. Prior to constructing a synagogue, the congregation met at Wickstrom Hall at 8th Avenue and Columbia Street on First Hill.

It opened on September 18, 1892, four days after Reform Temple Emanu-El in Spokane, making the latter the first synagogue in Washington. The Spokane congregation later merged into Beth Shalom, Spokane. Ohaveth Sholum Congregation also had a cemetery (established 1889) on Queen Anne Hill. The congregation disbanded 1895 or 1896, and the building was foreclosed upon. The cemetery passed first into the hands of the Seattle Hebrew Benevolent Society and later (in 1910) Temple De Hirsch, later merged into Temple De Hirsch-Sinai. Notes References * .

Design The wooden sloops of the Cruizer class were designed under the direction of Lord John Hay, and after his \\"Committee of Reference\\" was disbanded, their construction was supervised by the new Surveyor of the Navy, Sir Baldwin Walker. A pair of ships named Cracker and Hornet had been ordered from Deptford and Woolwich in April 1847 as \\"steam gun schooners\\", with the intention of ordering four more. They were suspended in August 1847, and the new ships Cruizer and Hornet were re-ordered on 1 November 1850. Harrier was ordered in 1851, Fawn in 1852, and both Falcon and Alert on 2 April 1853. Cruizer differed from the rest of the class in having a lower-rated geared engine and a displacement of 960 tons, compared to 1,045 tons for the rest of the class. Propulsion Their two-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engines generated an indicated horsepower of between and ; driving a single screw, this gave a maximum speed of between and . Sail plan All ships of the class were built with a barque-rig sail plan. Armament All the ships of the class were provided with one 32-pounder (56cwt) long gun on a pivot mount and sixteen 32-pounder (32cwt) carriage guns in a broadside arrangement. Alert had her guns reduced to four Armstrong breech-loaders in 1874 as part of her conversion to an Arctic exploration vessel. Development The Greyhound-class sloop of 1855 was essentially a Cruizer-class design adapted to carry a more powerful engine developing an indicated horsepower of up to , giving a top speed under steam of . The second and last ship of the Greyhound class, Mutine, had originally been ordered as the seventh vessel of the Cruiser class.

Loaned again to the Canadian Government for survey and laid up in 1894 } Operational histories Cruizer From 1853 to 1856, Cruizer took part in the Baltic campaign of the Russian War. Renamed Cruiser in 1856, she served on the China station during the Second Opium War, including the taking of Canton and the attack on the Taku Forts on the Peiho river in 1859. Laid up in Portsmouth from 1861 to 1866, she recommissioned for the Mediterranean, where she served until 1870. She became part of the Steam Reserve in 1870, but in 1872 she recommissioned in Portsmouth for service as a sail training ship in the Mediterranean, for which role her engines were removed. In May 1893 she was renamed Lark and in 1912 she was sold at Malta. Hornet Hornet served in the Baltic in 1854 during the Russian War, and from 1854 until 1859 she served in the East Indies and in China, taking part in the Second Opium War. After a refit in 1859-1860 she recommissioned for the Cape of Good Hope Station and served both there and on the East Indies Station. She paid off at Portsmouth on 22 September 1864 and was broken up by White of Cowes in 1868. Harrier From 1854 to 1856 Harrier took part in the Russian War as part of the naval force in the Baltic. She served on the South Atlantic Station before refitting in Portsmouth in 1860. She recommissioned on 29 October 1860 for the Australia Station, where she took part in the New Zealand Wars. Her captain, Commander Edward Hay, was killed on 30 April 1864 during the storming of Gate Pā, and his Coxswain, Samuel Mitchell, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery. Harrier paid off at Portsmouth on 31 March 1865 and was broken up the next year. Miranda (left) during the Regatta of January, 1862 (\\"the race of the Maori war canoes\\") Fawn Fawn commissioned at Sheerness on 30 October 1859 and until 1863 served on the Australia Station. She refitted at Sheerness in 1863, and from 1864 to 1868 served on the North America and West Indies Station. After a second refit at Sheerness in 1869 she went to the Pacific Station, where she remained until 1875. In 1876 she was converted to a survey ship, and in this role she surveyed areas of the east coast of Africa, the Sea of Marmara and the Mediterranean. On 6 April 1883 she paid off, and she was broken up the next year. Falcon Falcon served in the Baltic during the Russian War before transferring to the North America and West Indies station, where she served until 1857. She refitted in Portsmouth in 1858, then served on the West Coast of Africa from 1859 to 1862. She refitted again in Portsmouth during 1863 before spending the rest of her active life on the Australia Station. During this period she took part in the New Zealand Wars. She paid off at Woolwich on 3 October 1868 and was sold on 27 September 1869 to C Marshall for breaking at Plymouth. Alert Alert in pack ice during the Arctic Expedition of 1876From 1857 to 1868 Alert served on the Pacific Station, with a refit in Plymouth in 1862. In 1874 she was converted for Arctic exploration; her engines were replaced with R & W Hawthorn compound-expansion engines, she was reboilered to , she was reduced to four guns and her hull was strengthened with felt-covered iron and teak sheathing. The modifications caused her displacement to increase to 1,240 tons. During the British Arctic Expedition of 1875-76 Alert reached a latitude of 82°N, and her second-in-command, Commander Albert Hastings Markham, took a sledge party as far as 83° 20' 26\\"N, a record at the time. She was used to survey the Strait of Magellan, as well as Canadian and Australian waters, and on 20 February 1884 was loaned to the US Navy to assist in the rescue of the expedition under Adolphus Greely. In 1885 she was transferred again to the Canadian Government for survey in the Hudson Bay area, on completion of which she was employed as a lighthouse supply vessel and buoy tender. She was laid up in November 1894 and sold, the bill of exchange being forwarded to the Admiralty, since she was still officially on loan. Alert, Nunavut, the northernmost permanently inhabited place on earth, is named after her.

According to the Cambridge HSPS website: graduates pursue careers in \\"research (both academic and policy research), the Civil Service (including the Foreign Office), journalism, management consultancy, museums, conservation and heritage management, national and international NGOs and development agencies, the Law, teaching, publishing, health management, and public relations.\\" The Faculty houses 4 departments: The Department of Archaeology,Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, Department of Social Anthropology,, Department of Politics and International Studies Department of Politics and International Studies and Department of Sociology.Department of Sociology Each of these departments has a worldwide reputation for teaching and research, and the undergraduate curriculum (Tripos) is designed to serve both students who have a clear disciplinary commitment at the time of application as well as those who want a broader multidisciplinary degree. Students with a passion for politics can take advantage of links with such departments as Economics and History, those with interests in Sociology can draw on Anthropology and Geography, while those dedicated to pursuing an archaeology career can specialise from the first year or combine this with Biological and Social Anthropology. Undergraduate students study several disciplines in their first year and then specialise in one or two disciplines in their second and third years. Clearly specified tracks (Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Politics, Psychology, Social Anthropology, Sociology, or a combination of disciplines) ensure that students graduate with appropriate intellectual and professional skills. Assyriology and Egyptology are also possible specialisations, within the Archaeology track. At the postgraduate level, there are established one-year M.Phils in Archaeology (including Assyriology and Egyptology), Biological Anthropology, International Studies, Social Anthropology and Sociology. The sociology M.Phil allows for specialisation in one of four areas: reproduction; political economy; marginality and exclusion; and media and culture. A new M.Phil in Politics was launched in 2008. For further post graduate study, Ph.D students conduct research within a wide range of subjects within Archaeology, Assyriology, Egyptology, Biological and Social Anthropology, Politics & International Studies and Sociology. The Faculty is currently spread across several sites. The SPS Library (now affiliated with the University Library) and the Department of Sociology are on Free School Lane at the New Museums Site. The Department of Politics & International Studies is currently located at the Alison Richard Building on the Sidgwick Site. The Department of Archaeology & Anthropology is spread across the Downing Site, New Museums Site, and Henry Wellcome Building.

A reason of ongoing interest in this field is the particular bond between regional history and the exploitation of metals. References to mines in the area exist in Strabo's works. However the first accomplished study on the topic was attempted by Oliver Davies in 1935. Other momentous researches were that of geologist John S. Jackson about mines in Ireland and Lewis, Jones in Dolaucothi goldmine in Wales, and the pioneering work of Ronald F. Tylecote. Moreover, in the 1980s and 1990s a new generation of amateurs and scientists began investigations in different locations in the British Isles, including Duncan James on the Great Orme's Head, Simon Timberlake with the Early Mines Research Group at sites in Wales and William O'Brien in Ireland.  Prehistoric Period  thumb Signs of Bronze Age metal extraction have been identified from several locations in the British Isles; this has been certified with carbon-14 analysis. Oliver Davies has accomplished the most intensive archaeological investigation in central Wales at Cwmystwyth. The first investigation conducted in 1935, however in 1986 a group of scientists instituted the Early Mines Research Group and reinvestigate the Copa Hill region including Cwmystwyth.Timberlake 2003a, 24 Even though lead deposits are the main concentration the first metal extracted in the area was copper. The main lead lode is at \\"Comet lode\\" where a large opencast was excavated. At the walls of the opencast, revealed entrances of tunnels, which were constructed to follow smaller veins. At one of them, a wooden \\"pipe\\" was found. Moreover, in the same area a considerable amount of dump was exposed including stone hammers and lead ores. Charcoal samples from the site give several different dates from 2000–1900 BC to 1400 BC.Graddock 1995; O'Brien 1996; Timberlake 1990a; Timberlake 2003a; Timberlake 2003b Other two significant sites are Parys Mountain and Nantyreira mine located in mid- Wales. Copper was the reason for their early exploitation even if Nantyreira's main lode contained predominantly lead ores. S.Timberlake and the Early Mines Research Group in 1986 explored them. The excavations had as a result the discovery of dump in both sites. Charcoal and stonehammers were found inside the tip. The C14 samples place both areas at the Early Bronze Age 2000–1500 BC.O'Brien 1996; Timberlake 1990b; Timberlake 2003b The Great Orme mine exploitation, on the North Wales coast began in the Bronze Age and continued until the nineteenth century. According to remains, mine workings have been traced in the Bryniau, Poethion and Pyllau valley. The dolomitised limestone deposits are rich in copper which early miners must extract mostly by malachite. Because of ground composition, the extraction was sufficiently easy, this explains also the scale of the operations.Duncan 1990; Graddock 1995 ,60–61; Lewis 1990,5;O'Brien 1996 In 1976 Duncan James revealed in Great Orme a shaft which included a firesetting in connection with stone hammers, bone tools and rock dump. The deposit was placed by radiocarbon-dating to 1395–935 BC. Andy Lewis continued the research in the area at the late 1980s. It is believed that the operations in the location ended shortly after 1000 BC. Extractions techniques with visible remains are the opencasts at the surface and group of caverns and underground shafts. The underground system was accessible by many different openings which simultaneously used as a ventilation system for the tunnels. The tools in the site constitute mainly by pointed bone tools and stonehammers. Other stone tools revealed at the locations were stone mortars and pestles, which indicate another stage in the ores exploitation. Moreover, a unique find for British Isles were the giant hammers.Graddock 1995, 60–61; James 1988, 115–121; O'Brien 1996, 19,24–25, 49–51 Evidence for early quarrying was also discovered in Alderley Edge though industrial operations in the 19th century destroyed a big part of the earlier deposits.The Institute of Metals 1991, pg13; Timberlake and Prag 2005 Ireland also has many areas related with mining activities from the prehistoric period (O'Brien 2003). However, the two important mines are Mount Gabriel and Ross Island mines. Ross Island lies near Killarney. Inside its area they have been exposed two primitive mines. O'Brien excavate \\"Danish mines\\" and revealed a mine cave and a huge spoil concentration nearby thus after the excavation of the latter, another unknown mine also appeared. Furthermore, he investigates pits and dips in the bedrock, which also considered primitive. The feature that differentiates this site is the discovery of a Beaker settlement very close with metallurgical pits, hammers and rock waste. This finds in combination with an early phase in 2400 BC makes the site and the settlement very important for mining Archaeology in the British Isles.O'Brien 1996; O'Brien et al. 2004 Mount Gabriel located close to west Cork provides useful evidence for the exploitation of copper ore in the Early Bronze Age about 1700 BC. Through research thirty-two areas of activity were underlined. Shallow concaves and significant amount of dump with charcoal and tools are the evidences of Bronze Age copper extraction in the region. Mount Gabriel constitute until now the only locations, where primitive assemblages remained undisturbed by 19th century deeds due to the low quality of its veins.O'Brien 1994; O'Brien 1996 With the beginning of the Iron Age about 700 BC operations associated with ore exploitations spread around the British Isles. A representative example of the period are Puzzlewood's surface mines. The site prospered especially in the Romano-British period and the late Middle Ages. The limonite ores represent a small part of the local Carboniferous Limestone. The archaeological remains of mining which can be detected in the area are opencasts, known as Scowles Holes. It's important to underline the discovery of habitations areas in close proximity, dated around 100–400 AD.The Institute of Metals 1991, 31–32  Roman Period  During the Roman period massive veins exploitation took part in the Mendips and Dolaucothi . Further metallic lead pigs originate from Peak District in Derbyshire has been discovered but the exact position of the mines remains unknown.Shepherd 1980,219; The Institute of Metals 1991, 14; Tylecote 1964, 26 It is possible that the Mendip sources were already exploited in Late Bronze Age and some evidence earthworks are associated with British Iron Age activity, but the peak of production is linked with Roman era. Even if we do not have many actual evidences about the mines, through the examination of the archaeological sites in the area is known to us that the Charterhouse Roman Town were guarded by a fort and similar conditions may occurred in Green mines also at least for a period.Ellis 1992, 32; Tylecote 1964,26 Dolaucothi The aqueducts at Dolaucothi Though the most acquainted site is the Dolaucothi Gold Mines near Pumpsaint in Wales. The gold mines were investigated by Jones and Lewis in 1969. The mines were in use until nowadays and their utilisation is obvious towards the surface of the site but also underground. The Roman presence in the area is dated from the beginning of their establishment in Great Britain and for a period of 300 years. The remains of mine workings former than 19th century are concentrated in five areas Ogofau, Niagara, Allt Cwmhenog, Pen- lan-wen and Cwrt-y-Cillion trenches. Furthermore, in the Ogofau region a number of pits came to light. Despite the concentrations of dump and posterior workings the opencasts of Roman period are visible and well preserved. The main one had preserved a depth of 24 metres at least other two opencasts are dated in the same period the co-called \\"Roman pit\\" and the \\"Mitchell pit\\". Likewise a second location with possible Roman dated exploration is Pen-lan- wen where a group of adits was found, traces of chisels and picks were obvious at the surfaces of the ambit's walls but the evidence are tenuous.The Institute of Metals 1991, 38–40; Shepherd 1980, 218 Map of the gold mine Undoubtedly the most striking feature of Dolaucothi mines is the constructions linked with hushing. Through the excavations by Lewis and Jones four main leats, a complex group of tanks and reservoirs were revealed in different areas either in direct vicinity with the mines or nearby water sources. Another crucial discovery was the fragment of a \\"drainage wheel\\", suggesting the existence of an underground wheel system similar to the well-known system of Rio Tinto in Spain.The Institute of Metals 1991, 38–40; Graddock 1995  Medieval Period  The Middle Ages was a flourishing period for the exploitations of metal in general, a prime mover for this was the inference of monasteries in extraction of minerals.Gerrard 2000; The Institute of Metals 1991; O'Brien 2004 A famous archaeological site of this period is the northern Pennines at Brownhill, Cumbria, where lead ores were extracted from argentiferous lodes. The mine was under the jurisdiction of the Crown. The lead ores were obtained by opencasts that took a semi-ellipsoid shape thus they called \\"bell-pits\\". Evidences of medieval exploitation are preserved also at Copa hill were small parts of a leat system came to light. Further Ross Island excavations displayed a smelting site connected with a settlement nearby the local mines but the contemporary workings are untraceable. As far as tin industry concerns \\"lode back pits\\" at Godolphin have identified as medieval.  The contribution of other fields in Mining Archaeology  To shape an overall image for mines in antiquity we have to consider in mind many different factors not only the architectural remains. Social context is one of these factors. The term includes the social status of the miners, their way of life, the relationships with adjoined communities due to archaeological record, the symbolic value of the ore which was reflected also at the finished objects and in general to recreate the past society in which these operations took part. Yet in collaboration with experimental archaeology important observations have occur as far as primitive techniques of extraction and their traceable residues or ways in which mining tools were used their properties and the distinctive marks of their usages. Moreover, scientific analytical methods can submit important data about chemical composition of minerals, slag and artefacts allowing archaeologists to build correlations or identify provenance. Further the science of geology and pollen analysis can give us an image of landscape per eras. Finally documents and inscriptions as well offer valuable help for the historical periods.Craddock 1990; Grabbock 1990; Graw 1990; Hall 1990; Henderson 2000; Pinckin 1990; Richardson 1974; Timberlake 1990c; Topping and Lynott 2005; Tuck and Topping 2005  References   Bibliography  * Craddock B. 1990.

Career  Her first noted appearance was alongside Ronnie Barker in the comedy Futtock's End in 1970. Following small roles with Frankie Howerd in the films of Up Pompeii and Up the Chastity Belt (1971) she secured a regular part in the sitcom Doctor in Charge in 1972 playing Nurse Sandra Crumpton. This role ran for six episodes of the first series. Soon after she appeared as Gretel in the 1972 film The Pied Piper starring Donovan. In 1973 she was offered the role of Carol in a new children's science-fiction series, The Tomorrow People. Winmill played the role throughout the thirteen episodes of the first series but declined to continue in the part, despite being offered a three-year contract. This was mainly due to her fear of being typecast and wanting to do more stage work, although the actress now believes that she quit the role too early. Winmill went on to do much theatre work over the next few years before landing another regular television role in The Duchess of Duke Street in 1976. She played the part of Ethel for eleven episodes until 1977. She also appeared in an episode of The Professionals, but by the early 1980s she had decided to retire from the industry. Over the next few years, Winmill became involved in other activities such as folk singing (she also plays guitar) and joined the Template Foundation, due to her interest in the psychic mind. She also organises drama and dance workshops specifically for women with an emphasis on spiritual well-being. In the late 1990s she made a return to acting, appearing in a one-woman show which she wrote herself and starred in a number of science-fiction audio drama CDs.

She broke the world record in the 3000 metres in 1971 and is a three-time medallist at the International/World Cross Country Championships, including winning in 1972. She went on to twice win the London Marathon, becoming the first British woman in history to run under 2:30 when winning in 1981 with 2:29:57, before further improving the British record to 2:29:43 when winning in 1982. She also competed in the 1500 metres at the 1972 Munich Olympics and finished 11th in the marathon at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, aged 46. Biography Smith was born in Stoke Newington, London, and began running competitively in the 1950s, at which time the longest distance for women in international competitions was 800 meters. She won the English National Crosscountry Championship (AAA) in 1959 and 1960. In 1965, she told Athletics Weekly that she intended to continue competing \\"for two more years at the most\\" and stopped running competitively in 1968. Smith returned to competitive running in 1969, and broke the world record for the 3000 metres distance in 1971,https://www.arrs.run/RecProg/RP_wwT.htm and won the bronze medal in 1971, the gold medal in 1972 and the silver medal in 1973 in the IAAF World Cross Country Championships.https://www.arrs.run/XC_Medal.htm She reached the semi-final of the 1500 metres at the 1972 Olympic Games. In 1973, she won her third National Crosscountry Championship. She won the bronze medal in 3000 m at the European Athletics Championships in 1974. In 1978, she retired from track running after setting a new world record for 3000 m in the age group W40 of 9:11.2 minutes, which was broken 27 years later, and ran her first marathon in 1979, beating the previous British record held by Rosemary Cox by nine minutes and seventeen seconds in a time of 2:41:37.https://www.arrs.run/RecProg/RP_GBRR.htm In 1979, she won the Avon International Marathon in Waldniel. In 1979 and 1980, she won the first two editions of the Tokyo International Women's Marathon. In 1980, she set a new British 25 kilometre record of 1:28:18 in Bruges, which was also the new W40 world record which was broken 24 years later. In 1981, she won the first London Marathon in 2:29:57, becoming the first British woman and the first woman over 40 to complete the distance in less than two and a half hours. A year later, she won the event in 2:29:43, again setting a new British record, and becoming the oldest woman to win the race at 44 years, 195 days, a record which has not yet been broken. In the first World Athletics Championships in 1983 in Helsinki, she finished ninth in the marathon. In 1984, she became the oldest female Olympic athlete by running in the first women's Olympic marathon, and finished eleventh at the age of 46. She retired from competitive running in 1986 after setting a new W45 record for the ten mile distance of 55:33. In 1984, Smith was awarded the MBE. She and her husband, Bryan, are on the board of trustees of the London Marathon Charitable Trust. Bryan is a marathon coach who also organises the Mini London Marathon.

Sediments are picked up by the run-off and carried as suspended matter or bed-load. Muddy floods are typically a hill-slope process, and should not be confused with mudflows produced by mass movements. Muddy floods can damage the road infrastructure and may deposit layers of mud blanket and may also clog sewers and damage private property. It has been referred to 'muddy floods' since the 1980s.Boardman, J. (1984). Soil erosion and flooding on downland areas. The Surveyor, 164, 8-11. A similar designation appeared in French ('inondations boueuses'Auzet, A.V. (1987). L'érosion des sols cultivés en France sous l'action du ruissellement. Annales de Géographie, 537, 529-555.) during the same period.  Muddy flood generation  Difference of soil cover by vegetation for two crops (winter wheat vs. maize) at the end of May, in central Belgium Muddy runoff is generated on agricultural land when the soil surface is exposed or sparsely covered by vegetation. Large quantities of run- off usually generated by heavy storms is needed to start such a flood.Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., Bielders, C.L., van Wesemael, B. (2008). Seasonal evolution of runoff generation on agricultural land in the Belgian loess belt and implications for muddy flood triggering. Earth Surface Processes & Landforms 33(8), 1285-1301.  Muddy flood occurrence  Muddy floods have been observed in the entire European loess belt. Other affected areas include Normandy and Picardy (France), central Belgium and southern Limburg, the Netherlands. Muddy floods have also been observed in Slovakia and Poland.  Temporal evolution  An increase in muddy flood frequency has been observed during the last twenty years (e.g. in central Belgium,Evrard, O., Bielders, C., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B. (2007). Spatial and temporal variation of muddy floods in central Belgium, off-site impacts and potential control measures. Catena 70 (3), 443-454.). This increase in their frequency may be due to a number of factors including: * Change in agricultural practices that leave field bare of crops in the autumn and winter * A shift to crops that are more sensitive to soil erosion; * land consolidation (enlargement of fields, removal of landscape buffer elements such as hedges. * construction of new houses, upstream of cropland increasing run-off volumes and intensity * increased frequency of heavy rainfall.  Control measures  Grassed waterway during a beautiful day in Velm, Belgium Grassed waterway in Velm, Belgium, after a thunderstorm Preventive measures consist in limiting runoff generation and sediment production at the source. Alternative farming practices (e.g. reduced tillage) to increase runoff infiltration and limit erosion in their fields may assist. Curative measures generally consist in installing retention ponds at the boundary between cropland and inhabited areas.Verstraeten, G., Poesen, J., (2001). The nature of small-scale flooding, muddy floods and retention pond sedimentation in central Belgium. Geomorphology, 29, 275–292. An alternative is to apply other measures than can be referred to as intermediate measures. Grass buffer strips along or within fields, a grassed waterway (in the thalwegs of dry valleys) or earthen dams are good examples of this type of measures. They act as a buffer within landscape, retaining runoff temporarily and trapping sediments.Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B., Bielders, C.L, 2008. A grassed waterway and earthen dams to control muddy floods from a cultivated catchment of the Belgian loess belt. Geomorphology 100, 419-428. Implementation of these measures is best coordinated at the catchment scale.

Background Born at 33 Cedric Road, Glasgow, the son of Percival Carter (1895–1956), customs and excise officer, and his first wife, who was from Glasgow, Isabella Smith (Isobell), née Stirratt, (1897–1931). His parents had married in Liverpool on 23 December 1920. After his mother's death, Carter's father moved back to the city, where in 1938 he married Elsie Alexandra Jones (1902–1974). Shortly after his family moved back to Liverpool, Carter visited Everton Football Club's Goodison Park home for the first time. He attended Waterloo Grammar School in Waterloo, Liverpool. Career After National Service in the RAF from 1945 to 1947, Carter joined Littlewoods in 1948. Carter's business acumen was soon recognized by Littlewoods founder John Moores, who became his mentor. Carter later became a store manager, then a senior buyer, and was appointed to the main board by Moores in 1965. In 1976 Moores made Carter managing director, a position he held until taking early retirement in 1983. On 18 August 1995 he was appointed chairman of Forminster plc. Everton He has had three spells with Everton Football Club. His first began in July 1975 when he joined the board of directors, after being invited by John Moores. Two years later Carter became vice-chairman after Moores retired from the board. In August 1978 he replaced Bill Scott as chairman. In February 1979 Trevor Francis become British football's first £1 million footballer. Asked why Everton hadn't competed for the forward's signature, Carter replied: ‘Everyone was of the opinion that Francis was a first-class player, myself included, but we felt that a million pounds was a ridiculous price for anyone … I am certain the board and myself would not condone that sort of irresponsible behaviour’.Liverpool Daily Post, 17 February 1979 Carter was involved with the formation of the Premier League. He along with four others were invited to dinner with ITV to discuss a break-away league that would feature the five largest clubs in the country (Arsenal, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur) more frequently than any other teams thus those five clubs would receive more money than the others. He responded favourably. While Carter was chairman of Everton, he oversaw some of their greatest successes, including the 1984 FA Cup triumph, the European Cup Winners' Cup glory of 1985, as well as two league championships (the first in 1985, the second in 1987). On 31 October 1987, he famously disowned a host of Everton fans who were making racist chants at Liverpool winger John Barnes in a First Division Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. His condemnation of the club's racist supporters (\\"Stay Away You Scum\\") made the front page of several national newspapers. Carter said, \\"We do not need this kind of nonsense. If people cannot control themselves the message is very simple – stay away because we do not want you here. It is incredible to think that 60,000 people can enjoy a game and yet a few mindless idiots can attempt to spoil it.\\"The Times – 30 October 1987 When Peter Johnson purchased the club in late 1993, Carter vacated his position only to be asked to return for a second spell by Johnson's buyer Bill Kenwright in 1998 where he remained in the position for six years before opting to retire, aged 77. In 2008, he was brought back to the board of directors for a second time by Bill Kenwright, this time because an Extraordinary General Meeting had been called and there were not enough available directors to attend (a minimum of three is needed) following the resignation of Keith Wyness. Carter voiced his approval of Everton FC relocating out of the city of Liverpool. He was awarded a CBE in 1982 and later a knighthood in 1991. Personal life Carter married Harriet Rita Evans (b. 1925), a machinist at a glove factory, at St Edmund's Roman Catholic Church, Waterloo, Liverpool, on 25 May 1946. They had two daughters, Gillian and Philippa, and a son, Terence. Death Grave in Frankby Cemetery On 23 April 2015, Carter died at his home in Noctorum Road, Birkenhead, after a battle against Liver Cancer which had been diagnosed the previous year.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography External links * evertonfc.com profile References Category:1927 births Category:2015 deaths Category:English football chairmen and investors Category:Everton F.C. directors and chairmen Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Football players and officials awarded knighthoods Category:People from Glasgow Category:People from Birkenhead Category:Presidents of the English Football League ","title":"Philip Carter"},{"id":"20257793","text":"The Headquarters Building at Lassen Volcanic National Park was built in 1928 in an adapted National Park Service Rustic style. The building served not only as the administration building but as a visitor center, and it quickly became too small for the developing park's needs. It was remodeled three times during its first eleven years. In 1932, the west wing was expanded with an addition that included men's and women's bathrooms and an enlargement to the superintendent's office. A back porch was added in 1935 to protect the doorways and windows from snow and to provide storage space for furnace wood. The park's Developmental Outline for 1938 states that due to development in the park, the building was not large enough, adding \\"[m]oreover, the present building does not have sufficient storage space, is hard to keep warm in winter, and presents a bleak and unattractive aspect on the outside which gives all park visitors coming by the Headquarters Area a very bad first impression of the park.\\" The park proposed moving the present building elsewhere on the site and converting it to housing, and building a new Administration and Visitor Center Building. Funding was not available for a new building so from 1939 through 1940 the building received a major renovation with the addition of an east wing, which also included an addition to the basement. This work was done according to drawings LV-NP 3004 C & D, designed by G. W. Norgard of the Branch of Plans and Designs, and was a Civilian Conservation Corps construction project. At that time, an engineer's office was added to the second floor, the stairs were reconfigured, a clerk's office was added to the first floor and the Assistant Superintendent's office was expanded. The new east wing had a wood shingled dormer on the south side, and a similar dormer was added to the west wing and the eave extended. The front entrance porch in the north wing was enclosed to expand the lobby and a new stone porch was added to its east side. Stone veneer was applied below the windows on the front and on the exposed concrete foundations. A wood flagpole in a stone base and a stone water fountain were installed on the front lawn.

The 93rd episode of the show overall, it aired on February 25, 2009, on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada.CTVglobemedia, (December 10, 2008) \\"A Gets Lost as Midseason Schedule Announced\\", A. Retrieved on December 20, 2008. The episode was written by showrunners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Jack Bender. John Locke, after stopping the time shifts and being transported to 2007 in the Tunisian Desert, starts his journey as Jeremy Bentham. At the crash site of the Ajira Airways Flight 316, the passengers try to find the identity of an unidentified man. Plot The episode begins an unknown amount of time after the crash of Ajira Airways Flight 316, which took off from Los Angeles in the previous episode, \\"316\\", and has crashed on the small island where the Dharma Initiative Hydra Station is located. One of the crash survivors, Caesar (Saïd Taghmaoui), searches through Benjamin Linus's (Michael Emerson) old office in the Hydra Station, finding several documents and a sawed-off shotgun. He is interrupted by Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson), who informs him that a man no one remembers seeing on the plane has been found: John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Locke explains to Ilana that the last thing he remembers is dying. The narrative shifts into an extended flashback of Locke's time off the island, since he left it in \\"This Place is Death\\". In late 2007, Locke awakens in a desert in Tunisia, where he is taken to a local hospital and visited by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale). Widmore tells Locke that he led the Others until Ben took over and tricked him into leaving the island. Widmore pledges to help Locke reunite the Oceanic Six—Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son, Aaron—in order to take them back to the island. Widmore gives Locke a fake identity, Jeremy Bentham, and assigns Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) to assist him. Sayid, Hurley and Kate all refuse to go back to the island after being visited by Locke. Locke also visits Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), but decides not to ask him to return to the island because he has been through enough already. Meanwhile, Kate's conversation with Locke leads him to look for his old girlfriend, Helen Norwood (Katey Sagal), who he discovers has died. While visiting her grave, Abaddon is shot and killed; Locke gets into a car accident after he flees the scene in a panic. He awakens in Jack's hospital, where the two once again argue about the island. Before Jack leaves, Locke tells him that his father, Christian Shephard (John Terry), is alive on the island. This greatly upsets Jack, and he leaves. Locke then goes to a hotel, where he attempts to hang himself. Ben, however, shows up and talks Locke down. He admits to shooting Abaddon, claiming it was to protect Locke. After learning of Locke's plan to seek advice from Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan) on how to return to the island, Ben kills Locke, making it look like suicide. He then takes Jin-Soo Kwon's (Daniel Dae Kim) wedding ring, which Jin had entrusted to Locke. The narrative returns to the present on the island, where Locke discovers an unconscious Ben among the injured passengers of Flight 316. Production This episode and \\"316\\" were written at the same time by executive producers Lindelof and Cuse. \\"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\\" was originally meant to be aired first, but the order was switched because they felt it made more sense and was \\"cooler.\\" While in the \\"mini- camp\\" where the writing team decided the plot elements of season five, it was decided to have five episodes continuing the story of most characters, before a \\"concept episode\\" telling the story of Locke's journey before dying, as it was \\"the missing piece\\" to the story of the Oceanic Six and their return to the island. The script originally requested for Locke to suffer a head-on collision, but stunt coordinator Michael Trisler suggested a change to a crossroads accident between three cars, because a head-on could not be reenacted in a way it would be safe to the stunt driver. Two blue cars like the one Locke drives were used for the stunts.Lost: On Location - The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham.

Morello started playing guitar in the mid 80's in the band Electric Sheep together with future Tool guitarist Adam Jones on bass. After graduating cum laude from Harvard University in 1986 with a BA in political science, he moved to Los Angeles, where he briefly worked as an aide to Senator Alan Cranston. Later Adam Jones moved to L.A. as well; Morello introduced Jones and Maynard James Keenan to Danny Carey, who would come to form the band Tool. In the late 80's Morello was recruited to replace original guitar player Mike Livingston in the rock band Lock Up, in 1989 the band released its only album Something Bitchin' This Way Comes. In 1991 Morello left Lock Up to start a new band, after being impressed by Zack de la Rocha freestyle rapping he invited him to join his band, he also drafted Brad Wilk who had previously auditioned as a drummer for Lock Up. After Zack convinced his childhood friend Tim Commerford to join as the band's bass player the line up was complete. The band released their self-titled debut album Rage Against the Machine in 1992, which became a commercial success, leading to a slot at Lollapalooza in 1993. Four years later the band released their follow-up record Evil Empire. The band's third album The Battle of Los Angeles was released in 1999. During their initial nine-year run, they became one of the most popular and influential political bands in contemporary music.Devenish, Colin (2001), Rage Against the Machine: St. Martin's Griffin After the band break up in 2000, the band released their fourth studio album Renegades, which is composed entirely of cover songs. Vocalist Zack de la Rocha started a low- key solo career; while Morello and the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with former Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. Audioslave released their self-titled debut album in 2002, critics initially described Audioslave as an amalgamation of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden, but with the band's second album, Out of Exile, noted that the band had established its own separate identity. The band's trademark sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s grunge. Morello also incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the band's sound. After Audioslave released three successful albums, received three Grammy nominations, and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba, Cornell issued a statement in February 2007 that he was permanently leaving the band \\"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences\\". After a seven-year hiatus, Rage Against the Machine reunited in January 2007 at the Coachella Festival and have has continued to perform at multiple live venues since, however, according to Morello, Rage Against the Machine has no plans to record new material. In 2003 Morello created the identity of The Nightwatchman, an \\"artist of the people,\\" when a desire to return to political activism in his music struck him, after over a year of playing non-activist rock in Audioslave. Morello first began playing political acoustic folk music in a Los Angeles coffeehouse before a small crowd, and soon after went on Billy Bragg's Tell Us the Truth tour. He initially had no plans to record, but later recorded the song \\"No One Left\\" for Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11 In 2007, Morello announced his solo album, One Man Revolution, which was released on April 24 in the US and May 7 worldwide. Late 2008 Morello released his second studio album The Fabled City, which features guest appearances by Serj Tankian, Shooter Jennings and Perry Farrell.

Listed at , , he batted and threw left-handed. Career A native of Dante, Virginia, Perkowski started his baseball career playing semi-pro ball in the coal fields around his hometown. He later pitched briefly for the Natchez Giants of the Evangeline League before getting drafted and joining the U.S. Navy in 1943. Perkowski joined the amphibious force during World War II, helping escort troops and tanks into hot spots on Landing Craft Tanks. He served 19 months in the Atlantic and 11 months in the Pacific, including four invasions during the war in Africa, Sicily, Italy, and Normandy. \\"I was all over the place just about\\", he later recalled. Following his discharge from military service in 1946, Perkowski signed with the Cincinnati Reds and enjoyed an outstanding year in the Pioneer League for the Ogden Reds, posting a 23–6 record with 209 strikeouts and a 2.09 ERA in 247 innings pitched. He led the league with his 23 wins and his six shutouts tied for the league lead. In 1947, Perkowski gained a promotion to the Columbia team of the South Atlantic League, where he finished 17–12 with 133 strikeouts and a 3.57 ERA in 247 innings before joining the Reds in late September. He posted a 3.68 ERA in three games (one start) before the season ended, but Cincinnati felt he was not quite ready for the major leagues at this point. Perkowski spent 1948 with the Tulsa Oilers of the Texas League, hurling his second 20-victory season in the minors. He finished 22–10 with 163 strikeouts and a 2.98 ERA in 263 innings, leading the league in wins and hurled a remarkable 21 complete games to lead his team to a 91–63 record. In 1949, he went to the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League and posted a 14–12 record with 138 strikeouts and a 3.70 ERA in 209 innings. After that, Perkowski joined the Reds again in 1950 and remained with the team for the next five years. His most productive season came in 1952, when he went 12–10 with career-highs in innings pitched (194), strikeouts (86) and ERA (3.80). He finished 12–11 with a 4.52 ERA in 1953. On July 19 of that year, he pitched a 12-inning, three-hit, 1–0 shutout against the New York Giants at Crosley Field. Battery teammate Hobie Landrith provided the difference with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 12th. At the end of 1954, Cincinnati traded Perkowski along with Jim Bolger and Ted Tappe to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for Johnny Klippstein and Jim Willis. He made 25 appearances for the Cubs in 1955, then returned to the minors in 1956 where he continued pitching until 1960, spending time with Los Angeles, Tulsa, Memphis, Fort Worth and Denver clubs. In an eight-season majors career, Perkowski posted a 33–40 record with a 4.37 ERA in 184 appearances, including 76 starts, 24 complete games, four shutouts, five saves, and 698 innings of work. Arm troubles soon caught up with Perkowski, though. He possessed a hard fastball and a devastating curve, but his delivery was bothered by control problems for most of his career as shown by his 0.91 strikeout-to-walk ratio (296-to-324). A good-hitting pitcher, he eventually was used in pinch-hitting duties. In 197 games, he posted a .180 average (43-for-239) with 13 RBI and nine extra bases, including one home run. A fine fielder as well, he committed only two errors in 169 chances for a .988 fielding percentage. Later life and death Following baseball Perkowski served in local law enforcement, ambulance and school bus driver, and with the West Virginia Department of Highways. He died in Beckley, West Virginia on April 20, 2016, aged 93.

The village lies on the southern slopes of the Jelovica Plateau. The settlement consists of three hamlets: Pri Cerkvi, Na Pečeh, and Jelenšče. Name Dražgoše was attested in written sources in 1291 as Drasigos (and as Drasigvs in 1318 and Draschigosch in 1481). The name is derived from *Dražigosťane, a plural demonym derived from the Slavic personal name *Dražigostь, referring to a local resident. In the past it was known as Draschgosche in German. History Dražgoše was already inhabited in prehistoric times, as evidenced by archaeological excavations at a hillfort in the hamlet of Jelenšče. The site has visible defensive trenches. A school was established in Dražgoše in 1894, replacing instruction that had previously been offered at the sexton's residence in the village since 1889. What is now Dražgoše was originally two villages named Pri Cerkvi () (with the hamlet of Jelenšče; in older sources Jelenčice) and Na Pečeh (). These were combined into today's single village in 1931. During the Second World War it was the site of the Battle of Dražgoše between Slovene Partisans and Nazi Germany armed forces, which took place between January 9 and January 11, 1942. After suffering heavy losses the Nazi forces set fire to the village, shot 41 hostages, and deported the remaining residents. In 1976 the Dražgoše war memorial was built just outside the village to commemorate this battle and the destruction of the village. In August 1945, the new communist government presented a plan to modernize the village by rebuilding it with apartment blocks and collective farm infrastructure. The villagers reacted negatively to this plan, and then the government withheld funding for reconstruction, and so the villagers rebuilt Dražgoše themselves without any state support from 1949 to 1960. The government also left the road to the village—which was built using forced labor by German prisoners of war—unfinished, stopping construction at Rudno. The road connection from Rudno to the hamlet of Na Pečeh was completed in the fall of 1949, allowing the villagers to transport cement and brick to the village using motorized transport. A road connection was built from the village to Jamnik in 1966. A water main was installed at Na Pečeh in Dražgoše in 1946, and it was expanded to Pri Cerkvi in 1950. The village received a telephone connection in 1952. Construction of a new primary school in the village started in 1953, and the school was opened in 1959. Church The parish church in Dražgoše stands in the hamlet of Pri Cerkvi and is dedicated to Saint Lucy. It is administered by the Parish of Železniki. The current church was designed by Anton Bitenc in 1964 and built in 1967, after two decades of bureaucratic opposition. It features paintings by Stane Kregar. The new church replaced an older structure destroyed in 1942. That church was a Baroque structure dating from 1642. Masses were held at the ruins of the old church until its successor was built. Today the stonework from the old church is stored in the former bell tower, and the church's gilded altar is displayed at the Loka Museum in Škofja Loka. Masses are offered at the ruins of the old church before the Feast of the Ascension and on All Souls' Day.

Biography Yaakov Alperon was born in Israel in 1955 to a poor family of Jewish immigrants from Egypt, and grew up in a small apartment in Givat Shmuel. Alperon and his brothers learned boxing and began taking over small businesses in the area, before eventually the family gained power by protection rackets across the Gush Dan region of Israel. Alperon was first arrested when he was in his twenties, and 1993, he was jailed for 4.5 years after the police shut down his extortion business. Two of his brothers, Nissim and Zalman, were also convicted. Alperon's main enemies included Zeev Rosenstein, a notorious drug lord in Israel who had also been the target of murder attempts, and the Abutbul and Abergil families over money from bottle recycling, an industry that brings in $5 million a year, based on police estimates. As part of a protection racket offered to restaurant owners, the businesses would pay for the mobsters' \\"services\\" by leaving empty bottles, which would leave no documentation and could be redeemed for cash to provide an apparently legitimate revenue source.Staff and Associated Press. \\"Mobster Yaakov Alperon assassinated\\", Jerusalem Post, November 17, 2008.

In March 2004, Israeli police arrested four suspected contract killers from Belarus who had been found with weapons, including explosives and shoulder-held missile launchers, at their hideout. The arrested hitmen had been accused of involvement in a failed murder attempt against Yaakov Alperon in December 2003, and earlier attempts that same year against Alperon's brother Nissim and another attack against a member of a crime family linked with the Alperons.Weisman, Steve via Associated Press. \\"Police nab suspected hit men in Israel's bloody mob wars\\", The San Diego Union-Tribune, March 9, 2004.

The arbitration efforts failed, gun and knife fights broke out resulting in Mulner being stabbed in the neck, allegedly by Alperon. Afterwards Alperon and his son went into hiding and were not found despite a two-month nationwide search, however the two later turned themselves into police custody.Heller, Aron. \\"Suspected Israeli Mob Boss Extradited\\", Associated Press, March 6, 2006.

Alperon had also been involved in setting up internet cafés during a time when few had computer access at home, in which the fee paid for use of the computer would be paid in cash to the restaurant and would then be used to gamble on the computer. The internet business was shut down in spring 2002 after mounting costs started to exceed the gambling revenues.Weitz, Gidi; and Blau, Uri. \\"Losing streak\\", Haaretz, November 13, 2008.

He had been arrested for stabbings, assault, blackmail and intimidation over the course of his career. Death Fifty-three-year-old Alperon was killed on November 17, 2008, by a bomb explosion in his white Volkswagen Jetta, at the crowded intersection of Yehuda HaMaccabi Street and Namir Road in Tel Aviv. The explosion resulted in Alperon's death and at least three other people were wounded, including a 13-year-old boy. Police were trying to determine the identity of a vehicle that had been spotted driving away from the site of the explosion. The body was identified as wearing the same shirt that Alperon had been wearing in court for the indictment of his son on unrelated charges. His funeral on November 18, 2008, at Ra'anana Cemetery was attended by thousands, including several known Israeli underworld figures. At the grave site, one of Alperon's sons was quoted as saying that \\"We will find the man who did this. I'll send this man to God.

He was sired by Sunday Silence and was out of the mare Golden Sash by Dictus.  Early years  Stay Gold made his debut at Hanshin Racecourse on December 1, 1996 but it was more than a year before he won for the first time. On September 7, 1997, he won a minor race, the \\"Lake Akan-ko special()\\", and then did not win again for more than two years.  Silver Collector  Between 1998 and 2000, Stay Gold ran prominently in many of Japan's top races, including the Diamond Stakes, Tenno Sho (Spring), Takarazuka Kinen, Arima Kinen, and Tenno Sho (Autumn). He collected 9 places and 7 shows, but victory proved elusive. Although he didn't win any graded races, Stay Gold accumulated significant earnings. His title was \\"Major Racing Wins: Lake Akan-ko special\\" all the time, but had many other nicknames. He was called \\"the successor to Nice Nature,\\" a Japanese race horse who won 6 graded races but was better known for his many placed efforts.  The biggest victory  On May 20, 2000, he was ridden by Yutaka Take and in the Meguro Kinen and obtained victory for the first time in 2 years and 8 months. It was his only win of the year. In 2001, Stay Gold began with a win in the Grade II Nikkei Shinshun Hai and was then aimed at the Dubai Sheema Classic(UAE-G2:then) at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse. Fantastic Light, winner of the previous year's World Series Racing Championship, was the clear favourite, with Stay Gold a 33-1 shot. Fantastic Light took the lead a furlong out, but Stay Gold rallied to get up on the line and win by a nose. It was the first victory outside Japan for Sunday Silence's progeny. In October, he took on two of Japan's best thoroughbreds, T M Opera O and Narita Top Road, in the Kyoto Daishoten and defeated them, only to be disqualified for interfering with Narita Top Road. His last run was Hong Kong Vase at Sha Tin Racecourse, Hong Kong. Stay Gold caught Ekraar in the final strides and won by a head. After the race, Yutaka Take, who rode him, said, \\"Wings grew on his back.\\" At the end of the season, the Japan Racing Association gave Stay Gold the JRA Special Award for becoming the first overseas G1 race winner bred by Japanese farms.In fact, the first Japanese- bred horse to win at the highest level was Shiva in the 1999 Tattersalls Gold Cup, but she did not belong to JRA and was trained in Britain at the time. On January 20, 2002, Stay Gold's retirement ceremony was performed at Kyoto Racecourse. Stay Gold died suddenly on February 5, 2015.人気種牡馬ステイゴールドが急死  Stud Record  At the end of his racing career, Stay Gold was retired to become a breeding stallion and has proved to be a very successful sire of winners. When he was in Hong Kong, he wore a Zeichen written as \\"\\" in the Chinese language. In Japanese, this kanji means \\"golden journey\\".

It has a saltbox-style side profile, with an asymmetrical roof which slopes lower on the back. __TOC__ History Nicholas Gotten immigrated from Germany at the age of 22 in 1854. He was a blacksmith and served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War under Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. In the years following the war, Gotton made a living as a miller and ginner. He and his wife Julia Coleman raised three children in the house.Historical marker in front of the Gotten House. Until the late 1970s, the Gotten House was owned by the City of Bartlett and used as the Bartlett Police Station. In the early 1980s, the house was leased by the City of Bartlett to the Bartlett Historic Society in a 50-year contract for $1 per year, to save the house from planned demolition and to refurbish the property. The structure became the seat of the Bartlett Historic Society, and since 1990 it has housed the Bartlett Museum. Exhibits on display at the museum are of relevance to local history: the collection includes photographs, written documents on the history of Bartlett, artifacts, and period furniture. The museum is open to the public every first and third Sunday of the month from 2-4 pm. Admission to the museum is free. On March 20, 2002, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After a $100,000 renovation in 2007, which included authentic new windows, doors and fixtures, the Gotten house was declared a Bartlett Historic Landmark by the Bartlett Historic Preservation Commission in 2008.

E.g., the longer a sentence (measured in terms of the number of clauses) the shorter the clauses (measured in terms of the number of words), or: the longer a word (in syllables or morphs) the shorter the syllables or words in sounds. According to Altmann (1980), it can be mathematically stated as: y=a \\\\cdot x^{b} \\\\cdot e^{-c x} where: * y is the constituent size (e.g. syllable length) * x size of the linguistic construct that is being inspected (e.g. number of syllables per word) * a, b, c are the parameters The law can be explained by the assumption that linguistic segments contain information about its structure (besides the information that needs to be communicated). The assumption that the length of the structure information is independent of the length of the other content of the segment yields the alternative formula that was also successfully empirically tested. Beyond quantitative linguistics, Menzerath's law can be discussed in any multi-level complex systems. Given three levels, x is the number of middle-level units contained in a high-level unit, y is the averaged number of low-level units contained in middle-level units, Menzerath's law claims a negative correlation between y and x. Menzerath's law is shown to be true for both the base-exon- gene levels in the human genome, and base-chromosome-genome levels in genomes from a collection of species. In addition, Menzerath's law was shown to accurately predict the distribution of protein lengths in terms of amino acid number in the proteome of ten organisms.

History The 1890 structure was originally located at the Tubbs Cordage factory, at 611-613 Front Street, San Francisco. It was moved to Hyde Street Pier for display and preservation in 1963, and moved again in 1990. The Tubbs Cordage Company Office is of local historical significance in the category of industry due to its association with the Tubbs Cordage Company and its rope factory founded in San Francisco by Alfred L. Tubbs and his brother Hiram where the first commercial manufacture of rope on the Pacific Coast was accomplished. Description The office is a small, single-story, single-room office building (with the addition, after the historic period, of a small closet, with a sink and toilet, as well as an office cubicle). The exterior is painted a dark brownish-red, common on industrial buildings in the last century, and sometimes referred to as \\"mineral\\" red or \\"iron\\" red, with white trim. This was the color scheme of the office at the time of its move to Hyde Street Pier. The structure stands by itself at the pier, just as it did on the original site. Rectangular in shape, the building dimensions are 21 by 26 feet. There is no basement, and the structure rests upon redwood sills. One story high, the building is framed with redwood siding.

In 1956, the Levies were renamed the Trucial Oman Scouts. In 1971, upon the formation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the scouts were handed to the United Arab Emirate's government and formed its Federal Union Defence Force (UDF) which is today renamed as the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. The Trucial Oman Scouts were a highly respected and impartial gendarmerie and were regarded as well trained, well paid, and efficient. Trucial Oman Levies The Trucial Oman Scouts were established at Sharjah, in a location adjacent to the RAF base, originally as the Trucial Oman Levies (TOL) in 1951, but renamed in 1956 by Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), Field Marshal Templar. They were originally to be used to suppress the slave trade (but not slavery itself as this was considered an 'internal affair' by the British) and later expanded to include the protection of British political officers, to help maintain law and order, assist the Trucial Rulers in fulfilling their treaty obligations as regards the slave trade and prevent internal tribal conflicts from interfering with the work of oil companies seeking to explore for oil under concessions agreed with the Rulers. The Rulers of the Trucial States were not consulted regarding the formation or establishment of the force and only the Ruler of Sharjah, who rented out the base to be used by the Levies on a 10-year lease, was informed of their establishment. The force was founded following consultation between the British Foreign Office and Brigadier John Bagot Glubb ('Glubb Pasha'), at the time the British commander of the Jordanian Arab Legion. Glubb suggested an annual budget of £40,000, the Foreign Office (FO) agreed a budget of £30,000 and the Levies was established under a British commander, Major Hankin Turvin, with two Arab officers and 32 other ranks seconded from the Arab Legion. , p.174. It was later expanded to 30 British officers in command positions, with a handful of Arab officers. It recruited its soldiers locally, mostly from Abu Dhabi. By 1952 the force numbered some 200 men. There were also Yemeni soldiers assigned to the Trucial Oman Scouts from the Aden Protectorate Levies (APL), a British colonial militia based in South Yemen. It finally reached battalion strength. In November 1952, some TOL soldiers were believed to be selling ammunition to the Saudis in Buraimi. Major Otto Thwaites, the commander of the TOL, went to Buraimi to investigate. There, three Yemeni soldiers of the TOL shot him dead. A Jordanian Regimental Sergeant Major, Daud Sidqi, and a Royal Air Force doctor, Flying Officer A.L.C. Duncan, were also killed in the attack, and two British NCOs, Sergeant Chinn and Corporal Cruickshank, were wounded but were able to drive away and get help. The three Yemeni soldiers who had carried out the attack fled to Saudi Arabia, but were eventually returned to Sharjah to stand trial after the intervention of His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. The shootings revealed a key weakness in not screening the Yemeni soldiers from the APL before they joined the Trucial Oman Levies. The first major achievement of the Levies was the cessation of both the slave trade into Saudi Arabia and abductions into slavery, especially in the area of the Buraimi Oasis, and by the end of 1951 this trade had reportedly ceased. By 1955, the Trucial Oman Levies had 500 personnel organized into three rifle squadrons. In 1956, the force was organised into four rifle squadrons, including one squadron based at Buraimi.  Buraimi Dispute  The Trucial Oman Levies fought a brief battle at the Al Buraimi Oasis on 26 October 1955. Two rifle squadrons deployed, along with troops from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's personal guard, forcibly to evict a 15-man Saudi Arabian armed police garrison in an old fort and the village of Hamasa. The Saudi garrison had been based there since August 1952 when they occupied the Buraimi Oasis following an armed clash in which three people were killed. The dispute arose from Saudi Arabia's claim, first made in 1949, of sovereignty over a large part of Abu Dhabi territory where oil was suspected to be present and an area in a 20-mile circle around the centre of the Buraimi Oasis. The claim arose after a geological party from the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) crossed the 'Riyadh line'. This was a border line negotiated in 1935 by the British on behalf of Oman and Abu Dhabi with Saudi Arabia, which the latter had rejected. The Aramco party was accompanied by Saudi guards and was met by Patrick Stobart, then the British political officer for the Trucial States. Stobart was briefly detained by the Saudis, who disarmed his guards. The incident led the British to formally protest to the king of Saudi Arabia, King Abdul Aziz Al Saud. The Saudis responded by extending their territorial claim to include the right to negotiate with the Sheikhs of the entire Buraimi/Al Ain Oasis and areas of the southern and western part of Abu Dhabi. P 188 The British planned to use overwhelming force to prevent bloodshed, sending in 220 men, two squadrons of the Trucial Oman Levies, against the small Saudi force. However, the operation was complicated by the presence of large numbers of Bedouin around the oasis, including Kaabis from Mahadah under Sheikh Obaid bin Juma, who were subjects of Muscat but supported Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad of the Al Bu Shamis, themselves a notable force. The Na'im were also, under Sheikh Saqr Al Nuaimi, an unknown quantity. The operation was intended to quickly displace the Saudi force and fly them out of the area. On 25 October, the Trucial Oman Levies quickly took the oasis and captured all fifteen of the Saudi contingent under the Saudi Emir Bin Nami, who was shot and lightly wounded when attempting to resist arrest and save a chest containing some 170,000 Rupees. The Saudi force was flown out on an RAF Valetta, which took them to Sharjah and then on to Saudi Arabia by sea. Most of the fighting took place after the surrender of the Saudis, with the Bedouin force of some 200 men putting up a spirited resistance to the Levies. A Lincoln bomber was called in, but couldn't use its machine guns as the area was populated by civilians. The TOL operation in October 1955 resulted in nine deaths, including seven Saudi policemen/military personnel and two TOL soldiers, Jundi (private) Obaid Mubarak al Katabi and Jundi Sayid al Hadhrami. Three TOL soldiers were decorated for gallantry during this battle. Captain A. R. Steggles was awarded the Military Cross for saving a wounded TOL soldier under heavy fire. Sergeant Mohammed Nakhaira was awarded the Military Medal for his \\"courage, cool nerve and leadership.\\" Lance Corporal Said Salem was awarded the Military Medal for driving a vehicle under heavy fire to deliver ammunition and retrieve wounded. Lance Corporal Salem was wounded in the fighting, and showed \\"the highest standard of personal courage and devotion to duty.\\" The Buraimi Dispute resulted in a proposed move to shrink the TOL being reversed and the force being increased. This move forced the Foreign Office to seek funding and in 1956, the Foreign Office and War Office shared the burden of funding the TOL equally. In order to encourage volunteers to the force, it was decided in late 1955 to change its name to the Trucial Oman Scouts. Trucial Oman Scouts By 1957, the Scouts included 160 British officers and soldiers and, by 1960, had 1,000 paramilitary personnel. Two companies of the Trucial Oman Scouts fought in the Jebel Akhdar War in the Sultanate of Oman between 1955-1959, a rebellion against the Sultan of Muscat. Sergeant Major Khamis Hareb was awarded the Military Medal for his \\"fine leadership and courage\\" on 21 August 1956. Sir George Middleton, the British Political Resident in the Trucial Coast, pinned the medal on Sergeant Major Hareb. In January 1962, John Profumo, the British War Minister visited and inspected the Scouts in Aden, and chatted to one of the British Sergeants: Bert Baverstock.Photographic Records held by Bert Baverstock's sister, Uptom Poole, accessed January 2014 by Dr Michael Foster, Rector of Tarrant Hinton, Dorset – also War Office files for 1962 The final defeat of the rebels took place in January 1959 in an action led by the British SAS that the Trucial Oman Scouts supported, along with the Sultan's Northern Frontier Regiment. The move to use the TOS, seen as a purely internal force, to intervene in a neighbouring conflict led to criticism in the Trucial States, among both the Rulers and their people and a large number of recruits withdrew their applications. During the 1962-1976 Dhofar Rebellion, it was believed that many members of the Dhofar Liberation Front were former soldiers from the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces (SAF), or the Trucial Oman Scouts. In 1960, the Scouts mounted a road-building program, leading the construction of roads from Masafi to Fujairah through the Wadi Hamm, and from Masafi to Dibba through the Wadi Ayyinah, by blasting a route through the mountains using dynamite. This route remains a key road link to the East Coast of the UAE today. By 1964 the Scouts had 1,500 Arab officers, NCOs and men, with 100 British officers, warrant officers and NCOs. It was organized into five rifle squadrons, each with three British and three Arab officers and 145 Arab other ranks, and one group equipped with machine guns and 3-inch mortars. There were also a reserve squadron, a signals squadron, a motor transport squadron, a medical centre, a workshop, a cadet squadron, a cadet school, and a training depot. From March 1964, the Commanding Officer (COMTOS) was Freddie de Butts. Among his officers was Jack Briggs, formerly a police officer in both Palestine and Qatar, who would go on to command the Dubai Police. By 1965, the British Government was investing some £2 million annually in maintaining the Scouts, which ultimately reported to the Political Resident of the time. Former TOS commander Freddie de Butts cites this relationship as a cause behind the formation of the Abu Dhabi Defence Force by Sheikh Shakhbut in 1965. This was followed by the formation of similar forces by the Rulers of other emirates. In 1967, Captain Jon Cousens in the Trucial Oman Scouts (previously a Commando Gunner in 29 Cdo Regt RA) flew a Percival Prentice (G-AOPL) from Shackleton Aviation at Sywell in the United Kingdom to Sharjah. Later, it was flown on to South Africa, where it remained until it ceased flying. In 1969, British General Roland Gibbs became Commander of British Land Forces in the Persian Gulf, where he re-organised the Trucial Oman Scouts and laid the foundations for what is now the Sultan of Oman's Land Forces. The Scouts then expanded from 1,600 to 1,700 personnel in 1970 and to 2,500 in 1971.  Sharjah Military Base  The TOS was headquartered in Sharjah, with its base moving from RAF Sharjah to Mirgab , a purpose-built base located in the Northern Sharjah suburb of Al Heera. The Scouts maintained small garrisons in most of the coastal towns and other key posts, including a base in Dubai from 1952 and a permanent garrison – one Field Squadron – at Buraimi Oasis. The Mirgab Military base included a Medical Centre, Mechanical Transport Squadron, Signals Squadron and Quartermaster, with a dhobi and coffee shop owned and operated by an Iranian, Esa bin Mousa Al Amri, as well as a camp shop owned by a Mr Lalchand and managed by a Sikh gentleman by the name of Hari Singh Bhatia. A Scouts Club was eventually built at the base, constructed by local contractor Esa Mousa. The base is still in use today, as the headquarters of the Sharjah Police Special Tasks Department. The TOS Training School and Depot for Arab Recruits was located in Manama, Ajman, while the Desert Regiment and Mortar Troop were based at Adhen. Other TOS squadrons maintained bases at Jahili Fort, Al Ain; Masafi; Mirfa and Khatt, in Ras Al Khaimah.  School  Local recruits had been sought by the TOS since the early 1950s, with a team travelling around the villages of the interior to seek new recruits. It was eventually decided to open a school to act as a feeder for recruitment, as well as to improve the image of the government. The TOS opened its school in May 1961 in the inland village of Manama, an exclave of Ajman and in its first year enrolled 50 students. The school offered an elementary education and, after finishing three years' study, students were given preference to enter the TOS. By 1954, the school was training 65 students aged between 10 and 17. The most promising of these were sent to the UK for officer training. Union Defence Force seven emirates and formation of the Union Defence Force. The formation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971 resulted in the Scouts being reassigned into the Federal military body, the Union Defence Force (UDF). At the time, the Force consisted of 2,500 regular military personnel. In 1975, the UDF had 3,250 regular military personnel organised into six Mobile Squadrons and an Air Detachment with seven helicopters. The Force was equipped with Scorpion light tanks, Ferret armoured cars, Land Rovers, eight 81mm Mortars, and two dhows. The handover from the Trucial Oman Scouts to the Union Defence Force formally took place on 22 December 1971, when UAE Minister of Defence Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum visited all the Trucial Oman Scouts bases together with TOS Commanding Officer Freddie de Butts. In January 1972 during an attempted coup d'etat in which 18 armed supporters of the former ruler of Sharjah, who included the former ruler, Sheikh Saqr bin Sultan (who ruled from 1951 until the British deposed him in 1965), attacked and seized the palace. The attackers killed Sheikh Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, ruler since 1965, along with one of his bodyguards. Sharjah soldiers and troops of the Union Defence Force then surrounded the palace. Several UDF troops were wounded, including a British captain, before the rebels surrendered next morning. Sheikh Saqr was then exiled. In February 1972, there was a brief border war between Bedu tribesmen from Kalba and Fujairah over a disputed area that only covered a quarter of an acre but included water wells and date palm trees. Twenty-two people were killed and another 12 were wounded before UDF troops were able to impose a ceasefire. In May 1976, the Union Defence Force unified and incorporated the military forces of the various UAE emirates. The former state units then lost their individual identities. The UDF was organized as highly mobile light armored cavalry and included 40% locally recruited Arab personnel, including 50 Jordanian NCOs and Omanis, who formed the bulk of the troops. It also included Iranians, Indians, and Pakistanis. It remained under the command and control of 30 British officers until the mid-1980s.

Reed, SSC, enthroned as assisting bishop in 21 September 2019, and effective since 31 December 2019 after the retirement of Jack Iker. The controversial separation between it and the identically named Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth in the Episcopal Church arose out of events in 2008, when the 26th annual convention of the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth voted to leave the Episcopal Church and join the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone. At the time of the vote in 2008 to separate from the Episcopal Church, the diocese had geographically fixed boundaries covering 24 counties in Texas and claimed 19,000 members. Afterward, in accordance with the non-geographical concept of dioceses in the Anglican Church of North America, it began to accept congregations outside its previous territory. In November 2012, the diocese reported 62 congregations, of which 60 are in Texas, one in Louisiana and one in Arkansas. The cathedral of the diocese is St. Vincent's Cathedral in Bedford. History Position in the Episcopal Church Jack Iker, former Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth The Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth came into being in 1983 and, within the Episcopal Church, was long seen as a leader of Anglo-Catholicss and other theological conservatives within American Anglicanism. The diocesan bishop, Jack Iker, SSC, was the last diocesan bishop in the Episcopal Church who held that a bishop could not ordain women to the priesthood. In 2006, a substantial majority of the 51 parishes in the diocese affiliated with the Anglican Communion Network, an association of dioceses, parishes, and clergy working to counteract a liberal shift in doctrine and practice that abandons or ignores traditional teaching and discipline. Realignment In November 2008, delegates at a diocesan convention voted to leave the Episcopal Church and join the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone. The Episcopal Church maintained that the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth was still a part of the Episcopal Church, and that only the individuals in favor of these motions had left the Episcopal Church. The decision of convention was challenged on canonical and legal grounds by members from several parishes (the vote to leave TEC was 72 to 19 clergy and 102 to 25 laity), who then reorganized and remained within the Episcopal Church with the Rt. Rev. Ted Gulick as provisional bishop. Following the vote of diocesan convention to leave the Episcopal Church, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, Katharine Jefferts Schori, declared that Bishop Iker was inhibited from exercising his office as a bishop in the Episcopal Church, on the grounds that he had violated Title IV, Canon 9, by abandoning the \\"Doctrine, Discipline or Worship of the Church\\". In response, Iker rejected the authority of the presiding bishop. Thus, the presiding bishop, on December 5, with the advice and consent of her council of advice (bishops who are the presidents or vice-presidents of each province), deemed that Iker had renounced ordained ministry and declared him removed from it.http://www.ecusa.anglican.org/79901_103480_ENG_HTM.htm The standing committee of the departing diocese declared the inhibition of Iker to be an \\"illegal, unconstitutional, and uncanonical attempt to interfere with the rights and ministry of a diocese of another province of the Anglican Communion\\", thus affirming their decision to realign with the Southern Cone.http://www.fwepiscopal.org/downloads/reFortWorthBishopInhibition.pdf The Episcopal Church, however, rejected this action. The presiding bishop determined that in addition to Bishop Iker's removal, there were no longer any qualified members of the standing committee in the diocese. A new standing committee was appointed from among those who remained loyal to the Episcopal Church.https://episcopaldiocesefortworth.org/assets/Opinion-178pgs.pdf Anglican Church in North America membership In 2009, the diocese was a founding jurisdiction of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA), the first convention of which was held at St. Vincent's Cathedral. Joining ACNA therefore created a dual affiliation for the diocese, which remains affiliated to the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America. In 2017, Bishop Iker declared the diocese to be in a state of \\"impaired communion\\" with the dioceses of the ACNA that ordain women to the priesthood. Property dispute Both entities claiming to be The Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth dispute the other's ownership of church properties since the conservatives' split from the Episcopal Church and realignment with the Southern Cone and the Anglican Church of North America. The trial court initially ruled in favor of the Episcopal Church as to ownership. However, the Supreme Court of Texas ruled on August 30, 2013, to remand the case to the trial court. Specifically, the court ordered the trial court to apply a \\"neutral principles of law\\" approach as to ownership of the property. The Supreme Court of the United States denied a petition of the Episcopal Church plaintiffs for the reversal of the decision, on November 3, 2014, returning the case to Texas jurisdiction.\\"U.S. Supreme Court denies TEC petition\\", November 3, 2014, The Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth official website. Iker, in a public statement, stated, \\"We are pleased that the Supreme Court has agreed with our position that the TEC [Episcopal Church] petition for a review was without merit.\\"http://www.fwepiscopal.org/news/supremecourt.html As the court has explained, a denial of a writ of certiorari cannot be interpreted as anything other than a signal that fewer than four justices of the court deemed it desirable to review the decision of the lower court, and that such a denial indicates nothing about the merits or demerits of a case.See Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., 338 U.S. 912 (1950). On remand, the trial court ruled in favor of the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (ACNA), but the matter was appealed to the Texas Court of Appeals, Second District.http://www.fwepiscopal.org/diocesanconvention/16convention/2016report.html On April 5, 2018, the appeals court ruled that the Corporation of the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth held legal title to all properties.https://episcopaldiocesefortworth.org/assets/Judgment-2pages.pdf The court also ruled that the corporation was controlled by the Episcopal Church group rather than the ACNA group and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings in light of the court's opinion. On July 27, 2018, the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (ACNA) filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of Texas.http://www.fwepiscopal.org/downloads/TXSCpetition0718.pdf On Friday, May 22, 2020, the Texas Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Second Court of Appeals and affirmed the trial court's ruling in favor of the ACNA group thus giving them legal title to all properties.https://www.star- telegram.com/entertainment/living/religion/article242938111.html The Texas Supreme Court ruled that: \\"(1) resolution of this property dispute does not require consideration of an ecclesiastical question, (2) under the governing documents, the withdrawing faction is the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth, and (3) the trial court properly granted summary judgment in the withdrawing faction's favor. We therefore reverse the court of appeals' contrary judgment.\\" Thus, the court again rejected TEC's contention that the determination of property ownership was an ecclesiastical matter which would otherwise require \\"deferential principles\\" to the hierarchical church pursuant to the 1st Amendment. The court found that the Fort Worth Diocese was chartered as an unincorporated association and thus falls under the governance of the Texas Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations act. Under this law, \\"control and governance are determined by the terms of the Fort Worth Diocese's charters.\\" The charter, in this case, gives amending authority, electing of bishops, officers, etc. to the majority vote of the diocese convention; not TEC. Moreover, the trust held by the diocese does not require affiliation with TEC, so whether or not a diocese can secede from TEC does not affect property rights of the withdrawing diocese nor does the diocese's organizing documents restrict the diocese's authority to amend their constitutions and cannons pursuant to the national church's approval. Thus, the majority votes of the Diocesan Conventions of 2007 and 2008 amended the Diocese's charters removing all mention of TEC in compliance with state law. Thus, the real Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth's identity is determined by what its charters say pursuant to the amendments of 2007 and 2008. The court also rejected, again, the Dennis Canon's validity since TEC worded the Dennis Canon as a \\"revocable trust\\" and did not specify that it is \\"irrevocable\\" as required by Texas law. Therefore even if the Dennis Canon were valid, it is revokable and was revoked by the diocese in the 1989 amendment to the Diocesan Constitution and Canons. Lastly, in agreement with the Second Court of Appeals, the court ruled that TEC has no standing to pursue claims against the Diocesan Corporation's individual trustees for breach of duties to TEC.https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1446580/180438.pdf Schools * St. Vincent's Cathedral School References External links * Official website Category:Dioceses of the Anglican Church in North America Category:Protestantism in Texas Category:Anglican realignment Category:Christian organizations established in 2008 Category:Anglican dioceses established in the 21st century ","title":"Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (ACNA)"},{"id":"20258298","text":"Henry Edward Moberly (born 11 December 1822 at Madras; died 22 September 1907 at Winchester, Hampshire) was an English cleric and school housemaster.

First printed in the newspaper Neue Freie Presse in 1922, Amok appeared shortly afterwards in the collection of novellas Amok: Novellas of a Passion. As Zweig was fascinated and influenced by Sigmund Freud’s work, Amok includes clear psychoanalytical elements. It deals with an extreme obsession, which leads the protagonist to sacrifice his professional and private life and, eventually, to commit suicide. The title of the novella comes from the Indonesian-origin term \\"amok\\", which was uncommon in those days. It refers to people who attack the enemy in supposedly blind anger and try to kill the enemy as well as anyone else in their way, randomly, without taking into consideration any danger. The actual title is Der Amokläufer an apparent High German neologism from the Indonesian original and the basis of \\"running amok\\". In the novella, as in Moonbeam Alley, Zweig brings the altruistic concerns of the protagonist into the forefront. Plot The nameless first-person narrator travels from India to Europe on the ocean liner Oceania in 1912. One night, during a walk on deck, he meets a man who, disturbed and scared, avoids any social contact on the ship. The following night the narrator meets this man again. Although intimidated at first, the man soon begins to trust the narrator and tells him his story. A physician from Leipzig, he moved to Indonesia seven years earlier to practise medicine in a small and remote village. After some time, the solitude depresses him more and more and he felt “like a spider in its web, motionless for months already.” One day, a white woman, “the first white woman in years,” appears unexpectedly and fascinates him with her haughty and distant nature—something he never experienced with the reverent and submissive indigenous women. In the course of their conversation it becomes clear that the woman, an Englishwoman and wife of a Dutch merchant, has come to see him for a discreet abortion, for which she is willing to pay a large amount of money. However the doctor, struck by a sudden passion, does not want the money. Instead he tells her to ask him for the abortion and suggests that she should visit him again outside his office hours. She refuses and storms out. The obsession seizes the doctor more and more: like a homicidal maniac, he follows the woman to her house, scaring her and making her even more distant. As she does not want her pregnancy to become public, she eventually confides in an indigenous healer. The procedure fails and the woman dies in agony. In her death throes, she makes the doctor promise to do everything possible to ensure that neither her husband nor anyone else would learn the truth about her cause of death. From then on, the doctor is obsessed with fulfilling the woman’s last wish. He issues a falsified death certificate and when the dead woman’s husband has her transferred to Europe with the cruiser Oceania, the doctor, too, leaves Indonesia on the same liner—sacrificing his career and pension. He wants to prevent further investigations on her cause of death at all costs. On board, he hides from all the other passengers and only leaves his cabin at night in order to avoid meeting the widower. When the first person narrator offers to help the doctor, the latter categorically turns down the offer, disappearing to be never heard of again. Only at the arrival in Naples, the narrator learns about a mysterious accident that happened while the cargo was being discharged: when the lead coffin with the woman’s remains was being unloaded, the doctor threw himself onto the coffin that was fastened to ropes, thereby dragging both the coffin and him down to the bottom of the sea. Neither could the person running amok be saved nor could the coffin be recovered.

Carrillo (born 1969) is a one-time admiralty lawyer from New Orleans, Louisiana, who is U.S. Senator John McCain's chief of staff. In that capacity, Carrillo led McCain's investigations of the Jack Abramoff tribal lobbying scandal and the KC-X Boeing tanker scandal, which McCain referred to extensively throughout his campaign. Role in Jack Abramoff Tribal lobbying scandal Carrillo served, as The Washington Monthly described in May 2006, as \\"McCain's wingman on Indian Affairs\\", as his Chief Investigative Counsel on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. There, Carrillo led a high-profile investigation into allegations that flamboyant GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his partner Michael Scanlon, a former aide of House Leader Tom Delay, bilked several Indian tribes out of tens of millions of dollars. Holding what Vanity Fair described as \\"five gory, highly publicized [hearings] in 2004 and 2005\\" on that issue, Carrillo's investigation first exposed Abramoff and Scanlon's scheme to defraud these tribes and led to, according to The Washington Post, \\"one of the widest ranging federal corruption investigations in decades,\\" which \\"may help McCain, a likely contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, reinforce his image as a Washington reformer and a proponent of campaign finance reform.\\" That investigation was also described by Roll Call as \\"set[ting] a standard for what Congressional oversight should be, but often isn't\\" and the New York Post as giving rise to possibly \\"the worst Washington corruption scandal since the Abscam sting nailed six congressmen and a senator 25 years ago.\\" It helped expose wrongdoing that recently led to, among other things, guilty pleas from Abramoff, Michael Scanlon, a US congressman, and two senior congressional staffers on fraud and public corruption charges; a guilty plea from the head of a bogus non-profit organization for lying to Congress and tax fraud; the conviction of the Bush White House's chief of procurement policy and a former deputy Interior secretary for, among other things, lying to Congress; the development of lobbying reform legislative initiatives; and the publication of a major Senate report, called \\"'Gimme Five'—Investigation of Tribal Lobbying Matters\\". Role in the Boeing tanker scandal Carrillo led McCain's investigation of the Air Force's decision to replace its tanker fleet by leasing airplanes from Boeing. The investigation resulted in a major corruption scandal, which led to successful prosecutions of Boeing's CFO Michael M. Sears and senior Air Force official Darleen Druyun; and Boeing being forced to deduct about a half- billion dollars in payments required under a global settlement agreement with the Justice Department. The investigation received widespread praise: The Seattle Times described that investigation as \\"hav[ing] outmaneuvered Air Force brass and Boeing's 35 person Washington lobbying operation in a classic Washington power play and a media blitz worthy of Madison Avenue\\"; a major watchdog group as \\"congressional oversight at its best, something we rarely see anymore\\"; and The New Yorker as \\"burnish[ing] [McCain's] reputation as a giant killer.\\" Carrillo's role in that investigation was profiled by the National Journal's CongressDaily and the investigation, in among others places, 60 Minutes Wednesday. Other Carrillo is a graduate of Tulane University and Tulane Law School, where he served as Managing Editor for the Tulane Law Review. References 1 LinkedIn Professional Networking Website—Pablo E.

Larnaca Municipal Wind Orchestra at Larnaca Municipal Theatre, Larnaca, Cyprus. History The first efforts to establish a Wind Orchestra in the Municipality of Larnaca date back to the beginning of the previous century. The first maestro was renowned Leopold Glazner, who was followed by Isaias Kalmanovitz. The current Municipal Wind Orchestra was founded in 1987, and has been since then under the direction of the present maestro, Mr. Andreas Andreou. In 1988 the new Municipal Band made its first appearance in Larnaca at the parade of 28 October, a national holiday in Greece and Cyprus. Since, its agenda has been full of important appearances and achievements in Cyprus as well as in Greece, in various occasions to Bulgaria, in Thessaloniki, in Rhodes, Corinth, Athens, Ilioupoli City, Czech Republic, Saint Petersburg, Romania, Hungary. In 1991 Larnaca Municipal Wind Orchestra made its appearance in Bulgaria, in 1993 in Greece, in 1994 in Rhodes and also in 1994 in Cyprus at a Band Festival of numerous bands from abroad which was organised by the Municipality of Larnaca.

Left, Tonto Polychrome. Right, Gila Polychrome. Gila Polychrome Bowl Roosevelt Red Ware, also known as Salado Red Ware and Salado Polychrome, is a late prehistoric pottery tradition found across large portions of Arizona and New Mexico. The tradition involves the combination of red, white, and black paint in varying configurations along with compositional and morphological characteristics. This ceramic tradition begins about AD 1280-1290 and lasts until at least AD 1450 based on tree-ring dating. History Archaeologists have argued over the nature of Salado as a cultural phenomenon or an ideological one spreading through the Southwest. Some archaeologists have chosen to use the term Salado Polychromes so as not to give undue emphasis to the Roosevelt Lake area, once thought to be the center of production. Both terms, Salado Red Ware and Roosevelt Red Ware are still used by archaeologists. In her 1994 volume, Dr. Patricia Crown suggested four models with which to analyze Salado Polychromes. They are \\"elite symbols of authority or items of exchange,\\" \\"indicators of participation in an economic alliance/regional system,\\" \\"objects associated with the spread of a religious ideology,\\" and as \\"markers of ethnicity for a migrant group\\" (Crown 1994: vi). More recently archaeologists have examined these types distribution across the Southwest (Lyons 2003) and suggests that these types are markers of migrant groups emanating from northeastern Arizona. Ceramic typology Roosevelt Red Ware is divided by archaeologists into a series of types, which cover shorter spans of time, based on configurations of the painted designs and rim profiles of bowls. Roosevelt Red Ware has traditionally been organized into three types based on stylistic differences. More recently researchers at Archaeology Southwest (previously named the Center for Desert Archaeology) in Tucson, Arizona have identified an additional six types based on a combination of stylistic and morphological characteristics. For bowls with both interior and exterior decoration, the exterior style is labeled as the variant (Example: Gila interior with a Tonto exterior would be labeled as Gila Polychrome: Tonto Variant) All types within this ware share a number of broad categorical similarities although over a roughly 250 year time span significant variation is seen. The paste is generally brown to reddish-brown in color and is tempered with sand. Generally red and/or white slip cover both the interior and exterior and black paint is used on one or both surfaces, usually surrounded by white rather than red slip. Black paint is most commonly organic, but a mixture of organic and mineral paint appears on some vessels. Petrographic analyses have shown that Roosevelt Red Ware is produced across the full distributional range. Pinto Polychrome Pinto Polychrome is the earliest of the Roosevelt Red Wares and dates from AD 1280 to 1330. Pinto Polychrome vessels are only found in the form of bowls and lack the banding line, also called a \\"life-line\\" by some authors, that identify Gila Polychrome. Stylistically Pinto Polychrome is reminiscent of St Johns Polychrome in its layout of opposed hatched and solid elements, although the type exhibits a period of experimentation with colors and layouts that continue through subsequent types. Pinto polychrome is found along the Mogollon Rim in Arizona as well as the Tonto Basin, Sierra Ancha, Globe Highlands, San Pedro Valley, Point of Pines Area, Kinishba Area and the Upper Gila Valley (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 34). There is a transitional variant that has been noted by some authors known as Pinto-Gila Polychrome. This type exhibits the more bold designs generally found in Gila Polychrome but lacks the banding line and is still only found in bowls. Some authors have chosen not to use this type arguing that types tend to blur in transitional periods between types and that adding types adds no additional analytical usefulness. Pinto Polychrome is also contains a Salmon Variety (see Gila Polychrome). Pinto Black-on-red Similar in dates, designs, and geographic distribution to Pinto Polychrome but without the white slip underlying black paint. Gila Polychrome Tonto Polychrome jar (olla), Tonto National Monument Gila Polychrome is the first type in this series to be found in both bowls and jars. Stylistically Gila Polychrome is identified by bolder motifs than Pinto Polychrome and bowls are most readily identified by the banding line just below the interior rim. Jars have broad stripes of white slip with black designs, although the bases are usually still slipped red. Sometimes jars exhibit multiple parallel bands of black on white decoration separated by thin bands of red slip. Gila Polychrome, Salmon Variety, replaces the usual white slip with a pinkish slip but otherwise remains stylistically similar (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 21-22). Gila Polychrome is produced from about AD 1300-1450 across Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico, north of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua. Gila Black-on-red Similar in dates, designs and geographic distribution to Gila Polychrome but without the white slip underlying black paint. Tonto Polychrome Tonto Polychrome is found in higher frequencies on jars. The black on white designs are generally narrower bands than on Gila jars, or panels of decoration, and are surrounded by red slip. This type has a later starting date than Gila Polychrome, AD 1340 and an end date of 1450. Cliff Polychrome Cliff Polychrome Bowl Cliff Polychrome is identified by stylistic and morphological characteristics that distinguish it from Gila Polychrome. Dates given for this type range from AD 1300-1450 (Lyons 2004). This type is found in bowl form and can be partially identified by recurved and semi-flaring rims. Accompanying the shift in bowl shape is a drop in the banding line, creating a secondary design field between the banding line and the rim. Design elements otherwise are similar to those found on Gila and Tonto Polychrome vessels. Lyons (2004) describes the spatial distribution for this type as ranging from Petrified National Forest, Arizona to Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico and from the Phoenix basin to Alamogordo, New Mexico. The locus of heaviest production for this type seems to be centered around southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico possibly indicating the location of origin for this type. Temporal distribution would seem to indicate that this type is temporally significant since sites exist throughout the distributional range containing both Gila and Tonto Polychrome, but lacking Cliff Polychrome. Nine Mile Polychrome Nine Mile Polychrome is similar to Cliff Polychrome in that it only occurs in bowls with a recurved rim with a black-on-white band of design on the bowl interior just below the rim, the area above the banding line on Cliff Polychrome. Unlike Cliff Polychrome however, the rest of the interior of this type is red slipped without any additional elaboration, including lack of a banding line. Generally Nine Mile Polychrome vessels have either a Gila or Tonto Polychrome exterior decoration. This type is found in the region from the Cliff Valley to Perry Mesa, and from the Middle Verde Valley to the area around Douglas, Arizona. While rare, this type seems to have its greatest density around the far southeastern portion of its distribution. This type dates from the timer period AD 1375-1450 (Neuzil and Lyons 2005). This type is named for the Nine Mile Site in the San Simon Valley excavated by Jack and Vera Mills in the 1940s. Phoenix Polychrome Phoenix Polychrome also occurs only in bowls with recurved rims. This type is similar to Nine Mile Polychrome with the difference being that Phoenix Polychrome lacks the band of black on white decoration on the interior of bowls and is instead entirely covered in red slip. As with other types, the exterior of these bowls may have either Gila or Tonto style decoration. This type dates to AD 1375-1450 and as the name suggests its distribution centers on the Phoenix basin, but distribution extends east to the Cliff Valley and is extends from the Verde Valley in the north to the Douglas, Arizona area in the south (Neuzil and Lyons 2005). Dinwiddie Polychrome Dinwiddie Polychrome Bowl Dinwiddie Polychrome is also defined by bowls with recurved rims and dates to AD 1375-1450. Decoration on this type is restricted to the exterior of vessels with the interior being smudged (Neuzil and Lyons 2005). Dinwiddie Polychrome has a very restricted spatial distribution and may \\"not occur west of a line drawn through Kinishba, near Whiteriver, and the Nine Mile site, near Bowie [Arizona]\\" (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 30). In Crown’s 1994 study, although she did not name this type, she noted that Roosevelt Red Ware bowls exhibiting smudged interiors were confined to a limited geographical range. Los Muertos Polychrome Los Muertos Polchrome has a long and storied history of recognition without formal description. Neuzil and Lyons (2005) note that archaeologists have noted this type as a variation of Gila Polychrome since 1927. Names under which this type has been known include Gila Polychrome with four colors, Las Colinas Polychrome, Perry Mesa Polychrome, Gila style with red, and Gila Polychrome; Trichrome Variety. This type is identified by red paint used in conjunction with black paint in white design fields. Design layout follows either Gila or Tonto styles and so is referred to with reference to either of these varieties. Distribution of this type is limited to the Verde Valley, the Agua Fria-Perry Mesa area, the Lower Salt River Valley, the Middle Gila, the Santa Cruz Flats, and the Tonto Basin (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 30-31). Cliff White-on-red Cliff White-on-red is also a recurved bowl form of Roosevelt Red Ware. The interior of the vessel is smudged on the interior and the exteriors exhibit the white-on-red decoration. Cliff White-on-red overlaps in distribution with Dinwiddie Polychrome and thus the range appears to be southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona. Similar white-on-red types exist in the Southwest, although all show sufficient differences for Cliff White-on-red to hold up as a distinct type. This type is different from Gila White-on-red in that Cliff White-on-red is thinned by scraping rather than paddle-and-anvil, and designs are broader than those found on Gila White-on- red. Unlike Cliff White-on-red, Salado White-on-red is white decoration on a red-slipped obliterated corrugated body. Finally, Tularosa White-on-red is most similar to Cliff White-on-red with a smudged interior and a recurved rim form. The differences are that Tularosa White-on-red has two to four coils around the neck and thinner lines used in the designs. (Neuzil and Lyons 2005) Mexican Forms Escondida Polychrome Jar In their exhaustive study of Casas Grandes, DiPeso, Rinaldo and Fenner (1974), the type Escondida Polychrome was formally named. While not officially a Roosevelt Red Ware, this type exhibits hallmark traits of these types. Escondida Polychrome is produced with locally available clay, a buff firing clay used for types such as Ramos Polychrome, and has black and red designs with many motifs being similar to those found on Roosevelt Red Wares. This type does lack the white slip found on Roosevelt Red Ware, and designs show influence from Chihuahuan types. Escondida Polychrome may be a hybrid type taking aspects of both Roosevelt Red Wares and Chihuahuan wares and being locally produced in northern Mexico. A second type, unnamed yet, is similar to Escondida Polychrome but exhibits the white slip found on Roosevelt Red Ware. Fenner (personal communication) feels that these vessels are most likely locally produced Roosevelt Red Wares and as such would be found under one of the above headings, although sherds would exhibit the buff- colored paste found in the region.

In November 2016, an outpost was launched in London by Philip Hamilton. History Aquavit was created and opened by Håkan Swahn in 1987. and was a pioneer in New York in creating two distinct dining rooms, a casual café with modern but rustic fare as well as a cutting-edge modern dining room. This was conceptually based on the Stockholm restaurant, Operakällaren, whose owner, Tore Wretman, was one of Aquavit’s original partners. Aquavit with the arrival of Chef Marcus Samuelsson in 1995 garnered greater culinary recognition. After 17 years in one location (13 West 54th StreetNew York Magazine, June 27-July 4, 1988, p. 192.), Aquavit relocated in 2005 to new premises, giving the restaurant an entirely new look. Aquavit opened a second restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1999, but it failed to take hold and ultimately closed in mid-2003. Aquavit enjoyed a three-star rating from The New York Times from 1995 until 2010, and 2015 onward. and was ranked by New York Magazine in 2006 as the 9th-best restaurant in New York. In 2002 the cook book “Aquavit and the new Scandinavian Cuisine” was written by Marcus Samuelsson based on the food of the restaurant. Concept The restaurant is an international restaurant with Scandinavian flair. It was conceived to be a restaurant for New Yorkers and visitors to New York and not a culinary home-away-from-home for Scandinavian emigrants. The menu has a Scandinavian flavor profile without featuring special Scandinavian ethnic dishes. The menu favors seafood and offers several tasting menus as well as a vegetarian menu. Aquavit’s café is distinctly more traditional in its roots. A substantial portion of the menu showcases Scandinavian specialties such as Meatballs with Lingonberries, Gravlax and a variety of herrings. The Lounge offers small portions of dishes offered in the café and the Private Dining Room has a menu targeted to corporate customers. Aquavit's design is modern but has its roots in Scandinavian designs from the 1950s, 60s and 70s, with designs of Arne Jacobsen, Poul Kjaerholm and Verner Panton. Modern photographic art by New York artists such as Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman and Laurie Simmons adorn the walls. Menu Aquavit features a wide array of its namesake beverage, some imported from Scandinavia but many flavored in the restaurant. The selection of Aquavits is complemented by a substantial selection of high-quality beers. Aquavit’s wine list has received numerous awards from The Wine Spectator Magazine. Awards The restaurant has received a number of awards and accolades over the years, including: * Two stars in the Michelin Guide in 2014; one star in the Michelin Guide in 2013 * Three star rating by the New York Times in 2015 * Selected 9th-best restaurant in New York 2006 by New York Magazine * Marcus Samuelsson voted Best Chef New York in 2003 by The James Beard Foundation * Inducted in Restaurant Hall of Fame USA in 2000 * Receiving the Ivy Award * Best Sunday Brunch New York Magazine The executive chef of Aquavit is Emma Bengtsson. In 2013, Zagats gave it a food rating of 25.

In August 2006, Jamal was appointed the provincial governor of Khost Province, in eastern Afghanistan. Khost lies adjacent to the Waziristan tribal region of Pakistan, base to militant groups. After leaving this post, Jamal worked on President Hamid Karzai's successful re-election campaign in 2009, acting as his campaign manager. He was nominated as minister for Border Affairs and Tribal Affairs and functioned as the acting minister, but failed to be confirmed by parliament.

They consist of services in each municipality, which are aided and supervised by different governmental bodies at the state as well as the county level. The Child Welfare Services’ statutory obligation is \\"to ensure that children and youth who live in conditions that may be detrimental to their health and development receive the necessary assistance and care at the right time.\\"Child Welfare Act, § 1-1 Roughly 3% of all children in Norway receive some sort of measure from the Child Welfare Services, most of them in the form of relief measures to the child and its parents (such as counselling, advice, external support contacts, access to day care etc.). In about one quarter of the cases, the children are placed outside their homes (mainly in foster families or institutions) after care orders.  Organisation  The Norwegian Child Welfare Services were established and regulated under the terms of the Child Welfare Act of 1992,Child Welfare Act which has the purpose \\"to ensure that children and youth who live in conditions that may be detrimental to their health and development receive the necessary assistance and care at the right time,\\" and \\"to help ensure children and youth grow up in a secure environment\\". The Ministry of Children and Equality (Norwegian Barne- og likestillingsdepartementet, abbreviated BLD) holds the chief jurisdiction over child welfare issuesChild Welfare Act, § 2-2 and is responsible for developing regulations and guidelines, but is not involved in individual cases.Child Welfare Act, § 2-3 Each Norwegian municipality is obliged to have Child Welfare Services.Child Welfare Act, § 2-1 These are responsible for the local and day-to-day implementation of the Child Welfare Act (such as preventive work, investigation, support service, approval of foster families, follow-up of children placed in foster families or institutions). This \\"municipal child welfare\\" is aided by two agencies that constitute the \\"governmental child welfare\\": * The Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Norwegian Barne-, ungdoms- og familiedirektoratet, abbreviated Bufdir) is a governmental body responsible for the \\"theoretical\\" aspects of child welfare (interpretation of the law and commissioning and dissemination of research). * The Office for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Norwegian Barne-, ungdoms- og familieetaten, abbreviated Bufetat) is a governmental body responsible for the \\"practical\\" aspects of child welfare (approval and management of child welfare institutions, recruitment and training of foster families). In addition, the following bodies at the county level are involved in child welfare: * The County Social Welfare Boards (Norwegian Fylkesnemnda for barnevern og sosiale saker) function as tribunals that have to approve of any compulsory measures and care orders (i.e., decisions that parents lose custody of their child). It has an autonomous position in relation to the Ministry and the County Governor.Child Welfare Act, chapter 7 * The County Governors, representing the governmental authority at the county level, supervise the activities of the municipalities and child welfare institutions and handle appeals.Child Welfare Act, §§ 2-3, 6-5  Support and assistance  The Child Welfare Services are responsible for implementing measures for children and their families in situations where there are special needs in relation to the home environment. Assistance may be provided as counselling, advisory services, and aid measures, including external support contacts, relief measures in the home, and access to day care.Child Welfare Act, § 4-4 Under the guidelines of the Norwegian Child Welfare Services, children are entitled to participate in decisions involving their personal welfare, and have the right to state their views in accordance with their age and level of maturity.Child Welfare Act, §§ 4-1, 6-3 This applies especially in cases where there are administrative and legal proceedings that will strongly affect the children's day-to-day lives.  Duties  The Child Welfare Services are required to take action if measures implemented in the home environment are not sufficient to safeguard the child's needs. In such cases, the Child Welfare Service may place children under foster care in consultation with the parents, in a child welfare institution, or introduce specific parent–child measures.Child Welfare Act, §§ 4-4, 4-4a Removing a child from the home without parental consent is a measure of last resort in cases of (justifiable suspicion of) serious neglect, maltreatment, violence, abuse, trafficking etc.Child Welfare Act, §§ 4-12, 4-29 This requires a decision from the County Social Welfare Board on the basis of a recommendation submitted by the municipal authorities.Child Welfare Act, §§ 4-4, 4-10 In urgent cases (i.e. imminent danger for the physical or mental health of the child), the municipal welfare services are entitled (and obliged) to issue a provisional care order.Child Welfare Act, § 4-6 Provisional care orders expire after six weeks unless they are confirmed by the County Social Welfare Board. Decisions taken by the County Social Welfare Board may only be overturned by the courts.Child Welfare Act, § 7-24 The municipal Child Welfare Services are charged with monitoring the development of children who have been placed in care outside their homes as well as their parents.Child Welfare Act, §§ 4-22, 4-30 Child Welfare Service employees are privy to a large amount of personal client information, and must comply with strict rules of confidentiality. However, information may be provided to other administrative agencies when this is necessary for carrying out child welfare service tasks.Child Welfare Act, § 6-7  Statistics  According to figures provided by Statistics Norway, 36,800 children received measures from the Norwegian Child Welfare Services at the end of 2015. This means that 2.9% of all children in Norway received some sort of measure. Of these, 12% were aged 0–2 years, 23% 3–5 years, 30% 6–12 years, and 35% 13–17 years. In addition, 6,800 young people aged 18–22 years (1.1% of their age class) received follow-up care. 60% of the 36,800 children received support measures within their families. 16% received support measures while placed outside their homes with the consent of their parents. In the remainder 24% of the cases, children were placed outside their homes after care orders. Of the 14,850 children living outside their homes by the end of 2015, 72% lived in foster families, 14% were old enough to live by themselves with follow-up from the Child Welfare Services, and 8% were taken care of in institutions, while 5% where temporarily placed in private homes awaiting other solutions. The main reasons for measures (both support measures and care measures) were lacking parenting skills (29%), parents’ mental problems (17%), high domestic conflict level (11%) and parents’ drug misuse (8%). Statistics Norway has also published some figures according to immigration status: while 2.2% of all children with Norwegian parents received measures, the corresponding figures were 3.2% for children born in Norway by immigrant parents, and 4.9% for immigrant children. The latter group includes minor asylum seekers arriving without parents.  National and international criticism  A protest against Barnevernet in Sofia, Bulgaria The Norwegian Child Welfare Services are periodically the subject of public criticism, generally on two main issues. On the one hand, they are criticised for detecting too few cases of parental neglect and helping children too late (i.e., for having a too high threshold for taking action). Taken together, the overall criticism is that the service is slow to take action but heavy handed when it does. On the other hand, they are criticised for taking over custody too easily (i.e., for having a too low threshold for taking action). Due to their duty of confidentiality, the Norwegian Child Welfare Services themselves cannot participate in public debates of single cases. The Norwegian Child Welfare Services are obliged to ensure the well-being of all children residing in Norway, irrespective of their (or their parents’) nationality.Child Welfare Act, § 1-2 While Norwegian legislation, following the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, treats children as legal subjects in their own rights, some cultures regard children as the sole responsibility of the family. In several cases, therefore, culture clashes seem to exacerbate conflicts between the Child Welfare Services and immigrant parents. Children with a foreign mother are four times more likely than other children in Norway to be forcibly taken from their families and the number of children taken into emergency care rose by 50% in just 5 years (from 2008 to 2013) with the commonest reason for a care order now being simply \\"lack of parenting skills\\". The European Court of Human Rights have by 2019 accepted twenty six separate hearings against Norway for the activity of its Child Welfare agency since December 2015. The ECHR rendered a judgement in one of these cases on the 7th of September, 2017 with a judgement of \\"No violation of Article 8\\".Judgments and decisions of 7 September 2017 However, on the 10th of September 2019, the Grand Chamber found a violation of Article 8 (the right to respect for family life) on account of shortcomings in the decision-making process leading to the adoption of a boy who had been placed in foster care in the judgment of Strand Lobben and Others v. Norway. * Pavel Astakhov, former Russian children’s ombudsman, made the allegation that the Norwegian Child Welfare Services abducts children from Russia in order to solve \\"population problems\\", in what was characterised as propaganda and misinformation by editor in chief of the Barents Observer, Thomas Nilsen. * Approximately 4000 people who were formerly taken into custody by the child welfare have sought compensation for suffering and abuse while living in orphanages or foster families between 1945 and 1980. Of these, 2637 have received compensation, in total $220 million (2010). * The services have been severely criticized by the Government of India for taking away two children from an Indian couple who were working in Norway. The case involved Norway's foreign minister (Jonas Gahr Støre) meeting with a special envoy from India in 2012. The father of the two children said to a local newspaper that The Norwegian Child Welfare Service had said the mother was force feeding the children. His point of view was that this was just \\"cultural difference\\" and that \\"it is not easy to understand Norwegian rules for a foreigner\\". Berit Aarset, who heads Human Rights Alert, Norway, has called the incident \\"state kidnapping\\". She says, \\"This is not the first time such a thing is happening in Norway ...the legal system favours the Child Welfare Services and they do what they want all the time... quite often when a Norwegian is married to a non-Norwegian they also do the same thing; they also do this to asylum seekers and in almost every case they say one of the parents has a mental problem just to make their case strong ...that is what has happened in [this] case too.\\" * In two widely publicized cases, the Polish private investigator Krzysztof Rutkowski has helped \\"kidnap\\" children (a Russian-born boy and a Polish girl) from Norwegian foster care in order to reunite them with their biological parents. The boy tried to look for help via mail (although he had banned access) to the Russian authorities. He eventually fled from the substitute family with the help of Polish detective. In spite of the threat of prosecution, her mother returned to Norway for her younger son, so far however unsuccessfully. Later Norwegian authorities’ claim for return of the girl has been declined by a Polish court as unjustified. The girl has purportedly been manipulated to confirm that she was mistreated by her parents. * In May 2011, the two sons of a Czech couple were removed by the Child Welfare Services due to the notifications from school nurses of child sexual abuse by the father; allegations denied by the couple. Parents were exonerated, but although their children were taken only under interim measures, they were not returned. The mother, who has since divorced her husband and continues to reside in Norway, has continued to pursue custody of her children through various channels, including the European Court of Human Rights, where her complaint was rejected without prejudice for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The children were separated by social workers and assigned to Norwegian families. The Czech President, Miloš Zeman, compared the organization to the Nazi Lebensborn program, with the claim that the children's organization is raising young Norwegians and that they are so called \\"de-nationalized\\". In the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, and the foreign minister Lubomír Zaorálek has sent a diplomatic note to Oslo regarding the matter. Several other Czech politicians also got involved in efforts to get the children back to their mother, including Jitka Chalánková (MP), Tomáš Zdechovský (MP) and Petr Mach (MEP). In January 2015, the Norwegian Embassy in Prague published a press release some issues regarding the Norwegian child welfare system in the hope that this will help in understanding\\" this case. However, the Norwegian Embassy soon removed the article. The mother could see her sons twice a year for fifteen minutes. She has however lost her parental rights to both children in 2015, since then she has no right to see them at all. The organization justified its decision among other things by too high media coverage of the case and that the children became accustomed to the foster parents. * In November 2015, a Romanian-Norwegian couple of Pentecostal faith were accused of using physical discipline against their children, and all five children were removed from their custody.. In June 2016, the municipality came to terms with the parents, and the children were re-united with their parents. All five children have been returned to their family after a settlement was reached, a county board hinting they will rule against the agency. * A Romanian family's two children were removed in October 2015. Their daughter was filmed while playing and said she has been slapped by her parents. After one year, the Nord-Troms District Court ruled against the agency and decided to return the children to their family. * In 2016, a Norwegian family's twin daughters were removed shortly after birth due to the mother’s alleged “undetermined mental disability” supposedly diagnosed 11 years earlier when she was 13 years old. The family took Norwegian Child Welfare Services to court, after 7 months eventually they were granted timely care over their biological daughters. Fearing that their daughters may be taken away once again, they fled to Poland and settled in the city of Katowice. On behalf of Norway, they were sought by Interpol as fugitives who kidnapped their own children.https://www.tv2.no/a/8426843/ In January 2017, the news reached them that the mother was pronounced fully sane, and that they won full custody over their children, however in the end they decided to stay in Poland.https://www.tv2.no/a/8846262/ * In May 2017, a Norwegian woman named Silje Garmo fled to Poland with her 1-year-old daughter Eira; the woman claimed she feared the baby would be taken away by Norwegian social services on inflated charges of overusing painkillers and chronic fatigue. Garmo asked for asylum in Poland and was later aided juridically by the Polish lawyers’ association Ordo Iuris.https://visegradpost.com/en/2018/06/19/polish-parliamentarians-met- silje-garmo-the-norwegian-woman-who-asked-for-asylum-in-poland-for-fleeing- barnevernet-with-her-daughter/ According to the media, in mid-December 2018 the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs withdrew their initial objections and consented to Garmo's request.Poland grants asylum to Norwegian woman: report, [in:] Radio Poland service 16.12.2018 [retrieved December 19, 2018].

From the 18th century (at least) to modern times, popular theatrical performances included music and often dance as well. Many composers and musicians had their careers launched in the theatres, and many compositions got their first airing on the stage. In addition to staging some European operas and operettas, Cuban composers gradually developed ideas which better suited their creole audience. Characters on stages began to include elements from Cuban life, and the music began to reflect a fusion between African and European contributions. Recorded music was to be the conduit for Cuban music to reach the world. The most recorded artist in Cuba up to 1925 was a singer at the Alhambra,list of theatres in Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la música cubana. p401 et seq. Adolfo Colombo. Records show he recorded about 350 numbers between 1906 and 1917.Díaz Ayala, Cristóbal 1994. Cuba canta y baila: discografía de la música cubana 1898–1925. p193 et seq. Colombo's last two recordings were in 1929 (Catalog of Cristóbal Díaz collection at Florida International University library) The first theatre in Havana opened in 1775, called the Coliseo, and later the Teatro Principal.Robreño, Eduardo 1961. Historia del teatro popular cubano. La Habana. p15 The first Cuban-composed opera appeared in 1807. Theatrical music was hugely important in the 19th centuryLeal, Rine 1986. Teatro del siglo XIX. La Habana. and the first half of the 20th century; its significance only began to wane with the change in political and social weather in the second part of the 20th century. Radio, which began in Cuba in 1922, helped the growth of popular music because it provided publicity and a new source of income for the artists.  Cuban theatre in the early 19th century  In 1810, says Alejo Carpentier, a Spanish company arrived in Havana that would perform for more than 22 years. This company had artists of serious merit.Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. p172 et seq. The troupe included Andrés Prieto (a famous actor), Manuel García (who played the villain), the singer María del Rosario Sabatini, Antonio Hermosilla and others. After a few months it was reinforced by more Spanish talent: Mariana Galino, Isabel Gamborino (the famous tonadillaSpanish musical form of theatrical origin; not danced singer), and her sister the ballerina Manuela Gamborino, whom Carpentier describes as \\"an agile and luscious bombshell who had the men of Havana in a spell.\\" The life of some of these players was theatre itself: Marina Galino provoked her husband to jealousy, whereupon he stabbed her and left her for dead, finally slitting his own wrists. But the lady was not dead, and eventually recovered to give exhibitions of European dance styles, such as the bolero (Spanish style), minuets, gavots polkas, folías (Canary Islands), cachuchas (Andalusian solo song and dance), manchegas (from La Mancha), , and so on. Many of these were taught at Havana dance academies, but the contradanza and the waltz were the long-lasting favourites. Within twenty years of the contradanza arriving from abroad, it had begun to show signs of cubanization in its rhythm. This was the start of the fusion which eventually effected so much music and life generally in Cuba. A Cuban actor, Francisco Covarrubias, was a prominent member of the troupe, and figured on its posters. He was a basso buffo, and an author of entremeses (one-act farces), zarzuelas and sainetes. As the vogue for Spanish-style theatre waned, Covarrubias led the way to genuinely Cuban theatrical formats.  Zarzuela  Zarzuela is a small-scale light operetta format. Starting off with imported Spanish content (List of zarzuela composers), it developed into a running commentary on Cuba's social and political events and problems. Zarzuela has the distinction of providing Cuba's first recording artist: the soprano Rosalía 'Chalía' Díaz de Herrera made, outside Cuba, the first recordings by a Cuban artist. She recorded numbers from the zarzuela Cadíz in 1898 on unnumbered Bettini cylinders.Díaz Ayala, Cristóbal 1994. Cuba canta y baila: discografía de la música cubana 1898–1925. Fundación Musicalia, San Juan P.R. p49 and 297 Zarzuela reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. Musical director Jorge Anckermann produced zarzuelas, reviews and comedies at the Alhambra. A string of front-rank composers such as Gonzalo Roig, Eliseo Grenet, Ernesto Lecuona and Rodrigo Prats produced hits for the Regina and Martí theatres in Havana. Great stars like the vedette Rita Montaner, who could sing, play the piano, dance and act, were the Cuban equivalents of Mistinguett and Josephine Baker in Paris. Some of the best known zarzuelas are La virgen morena (Grenet), Nina Rita (Grenet and Lecuona), María la O, El batey, Rosa la China (all Lecuona); Gonzalo Roig with La Habana de noche; Rodrigo Prats with Amalia Batista and La perla del caribe; and above all, Cecilia Valdés (the musical of the most famous Cuban novel of the 19th century, with music by Roig and script by Prats and Agustín Rodríguez). Artists who were introduced to the public in the lyric theatre include Caridad Suarez, María de los Angeles Santana, Esther Borja and Ignacio Villa, who had such a round, black face that Rita Montaner called him Bola de Nieve ('Snowball').Article La zarzuela en Cuba in Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la música cubana. p440  Bufo  Cuban Bufo theatre is an example of a form of comedy, ribald and satirical, with stock figures imitating types that might be found anywhere in the country. Bufo had its origin around 1800-15 as an older form, tonadilla, began to vanish from Havana. Francisco Covarrubias the 'caricaturist' (1775-1850) was its creator. Gradually, the comic types threw off their European models and became more and more creolized and Cuban. Alongside, the music followed. Argot from slave barracks and poor barrios found its way into lyrics that are those of the guaracha: So the bufo theatre became fertile ground for that typically Cuban musical form, the guaracha.Leal, Rine 1982.

Contains full scripts and lyrics of important examples, but no musical scores.  Other theatrical forms   Vaudeville  Vernacular theatre of various types often includes music. Formats rather like the British Music Hall, or the American Vaudeville, still occur, where an audience is treated to a pot-pourri of singers, comedians, bands, sketches and speciality acts. Even in cinemas during the silent movies, singers and instrumentalists would appear in the interval, and a pianist would play during the films. Bola de Nieve and María Teresa Vera are two stars who played in cinemas in their early days. Burlesque was also common in Havana before 1960.  African 'theatre'  All the African cultures which were brought to Cuba had traditions, which survive erratically to the present day, not always in detail, but in general style. The best preserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the instruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations are quite well preserved. Not until after the Second World War do we find detailed printed descriptions or recordings of African sacred ceremonies in Cuba. Inside the cults, music, song, dance and ceremony were (and still are) learnt by heart by means of demonstration, including such ceremonial procedures as are conducted in an African language. The experiences were (and some still are) private to the initiated, until the work of the ethnologist Fernándo Ortíz, who devoted a large part of his life to investigating the influence of African culture in Cuba. The first detailed transcription of percussion, song and chants are to be found in his great works.Ortiz, Fernando 1950. La Afrocania de la musica folklorica de Cuba.

The IMO is the international body responsible for code regulation. These are two separated optimization problems. Marine energy management can both be applied on board and onshore. It is a complex problem, due to the number of inter-related energy systems on board vessels, such as the propulsion, the auxiliary engines, refrigeration systems, HVAC, etc. The weather and sea-state, plus the logistics involved in transporting goods from one port to another, also have big effects.

Charan  5:31  Vaali  } Production Development Nearly one year after the stupendous success of his film Chennai 600028, in May 2008, SPB Charan decided to produce his next film. He then got to meet Rajamohan, as erstwhile assistant, who worked under prominent directors like A. Venkatesh and Rajakumaran, who told him the story of his film, which he titled as \\"Kunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum\\", impressed of which, Charan decided to produce that film. Rajamohan became a director, since he wanted to fulfill the wish of his brother, who wanted to become a director, but died in an accident, before his wish was satisfied. Casting When looking out for the actor to play the hero's role, Rajamohan saw Ramakrishan one day walking on the road, who was an assistant director of Cheran and felt he would be the right person for the role and gave him the role of the protagonist. Tharshana, who later changed her name to Thananya, a second year medical student hailing from Andhra Pradesh, was picked as the heroine to play the female lead, after she was discovered by Charan and Rajamohan in a medical college. Though she was hesitating at first, she eventually agreed to take over the role of Thulasi, after Charan and Rajamohan explained her the importance and the scope of her role in the film and convinced her. Apart from Ramakrishnan and Tharshana, another newcomer, Tharun Chatriya, and an older woman, who dons the role of the grandmother of Thulasi, are said to be important characters in the film. Moreover, eight assistant directors and some \\"lightmen\\", do act in the film as well, who Rajamohan and Charan wanted to pay a tribute for their hard work and the effort they put in. Yuvan Shankar Raja, a regular of Charan's films, was assigned as the music director, as were the other crew members, who had also worked for Charan's previous venture Chennai 600028. Filming The shooting of the film started on 9 June 2008 in Nagercoil and was entirely shot in a small village called \\"Muttam\\" near Nagercoil and in surrounding areas. Trivia * In association with SRM Valliammai Engineering College at Kattankulathur, Kanchipuram district, the team of the film conducted a two-day event at the campus, where rural games were organized and 30 winners were chosen to attend the audio release of the film along with big stars from the film industry.

For other places called \\"Commonwealth Club\\", see Commonwealth Club. The Commonwealth Club, is a private gentlemen's club in Richmond, Virginia, USA. Its present clubhouse was completed in 1891. The defining structure of the Commonwealth Club Historic District, it is located at 401 West Franklin Street. The Commonwealth Club is considered to be one of the finest pieces of architecture in Richmond and was a physical symbol of Richmond's New South movement. The club hosts the annual Richmond German Christmas Dance, the oldest debutante ball in Virginia. Architecture After an unsuccessful attempt to acquire plans from local firms, the Board of the Commonwealth Club looked outside of Richmond to develop a style that reflected the momentum of a more national architectural movement. The site proposed for the building, formerly the Palmer House, was located high above the street level. While the board desired a style broadly fashionable, they also desired the building to reflect Richmond as a southern city. The New York City based firm of Carrère and Hastings was chosen from a group of four firms. The Commonwealth Club is a unique structure among Richmond buildings. Characterized by its deep red brick, brownstone trim and terra cotta cartouches, the building is a combination of Colonial revival and Richardsonian Romanesque styles. The Colonial revival tradition is reflected to promote a heritage for the future and the Richardsonian style reflected the ability of Richmonders to afford an architectural style fashionable on a national level. It is classified by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources as Italian Renaissance Revival.DHR Id#: 127-0373-0002 References External links *The Commonwealth Club (official site) Category:1891 establishments in Virginia Category:Carrère and Hastings buildings Category:Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Clubs and societies in the United States Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Virginia Category:Cultural infrastructure completed in 1891 Category:Gentlemen's clubs in the United States Category:Historic district contributing properties in Virginia Category:Italian Renaissance Revival architecture in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Richmond, Virginia Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Virginia Category:Richardsonian Romanesque architecture in Virginia ","title":"The Commonwealth Club"},{"id":"20258910","text":"The Raidāk River (रायडेक नदी), also called Wang Chhu or Wong Chhu in Bhutan, is a tributary of the River Brahmaputra, and a trans-boundary river. It flows through Bhutan, India and Bangladesh. Course Catchment area boundary Bhutan The Wang Chhu, or Raidāk, rises in the Himalayas. In its upper reaches it is also known as the Thimphu Chhu. The main river is a rapid stream, running over a bed of large boulders. Between Thimphu and the confluence with the Paro Chhu, the course of the river is not severely confined but, after leaving the confluence, it runs through a narrow defile between very steep cliffs. It subsequently flows southeast through a comparatively open valley, its course strewn with large boulders against which the water foams violently. It is joined by several small tributaries flowing from nearby mountains. Just above Paro Dzong a considerable feeder, the Ta Chhu, joins it from the left. To the west, the Ha Chhu drains into the Wong Chhu. At Tashichho Dzong the bed of the river is about above sea level and at the point of its exit in the Dooars its elevation is only .

Chukha hydel plant The 336MW Chukha hydel project, which harnesses the waters of the Wang Chhu or Raidak River, was historically one of the largest single investments undertaken in Bhutan, and it represented a major step toward exploiting the country's huge hydroelectric potential. It was built by India on a turnkey basis, with India providing 60% of the capital in a grant and 40% in a loan at highly concessional terms and conditions. In the arrangement, India receives in turn all the electricity generated from the project in excess of Bhutan’s demand at much cheaper prices than India’s generation cost from alternative sources. Located between Thimphu and the Indian border, a diversion dam was built at Chimakoti village, upstream of the confluence of the Ti Chhu and Wong Chhu rivers. From the dam water was diverted through long tunnels to a fall of more than to Chukha power house for generation of electricity. Construction started in 1974 and completed in 1986–88.

In 2019, Johnson received the R. Brinkley Smithers award from the American Association of Addiction Medicine.  Research  Johnson's research focus is on the neuropsychopharmacology of addiction. His work integrates the neuroscience and behavioural aspects of addiction medicine with the goal of formulating a more thorough understanding of the basis of drug-seeking behaviour and developing effective treatments. Central to his research is the role of and interaction between midbrain monoamine systems with a focus on serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate and dopamine. Johnson's Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) paper, titled \\"Topiramate for treating alcohol dependence: a randomized controlled trial\\" and published in 2007, gained national and international media attention. The 14-week US multi-site clinical trial involved 371 male and female alcoholics.

Houck's company, Circular Productions, held the event first weekend in May every year and at its peak, the event was hosted by 130 cities around the world. Houck is widely considered to be the premier course designer for disc golf not strictly based on the quantity (solo designs) but also on quality of the courses he has designed. His designs span four decades and his older courses are a testimony to the evolution of the sport. His philosophy for course design includes the showcasing of natural land features and beauty that is unique to each property. He continues innovate design and is teaching design through his workshops and course design articles in the PDGA magazine. His course design has ranked #1 in the world by player reviews in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015,2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, on the oldest and largest ranking platform for disc golf courses. Lakeside, Selah Ranch, Mt. Vernon, Texas, continues to rank #1 from 2012 thru March 2017. His course Harmony Bends at Strawn Park, Columbia, Mo is currently ranked #1 on DGCourseReview.com. He has designed the highest ranked course in Canada and the Canadian National Championships were hosted there in 2018 & 2019\\\\. In Texas, his designs fill the spots of #1, #2, #3 and #4th top ranked course in that state. Other states where his designs have the top ranking including Georgia, Missouri, Alabama, North Carolina, and New York. The Admiral disc golf course in Semmes, Alabama was his 100th course and over 250 players from six states attended the sneak peek. The course is getting much usage and hosted two Professional Disc Golf tournaments in the first month of opening. He designed his first vineyard course in 2017, Flat Creek Vineyard Disc Golf Course, Marble Falls, Texas. This course has become a popular destination for disc golf players. In 2021, two separate private venues will offer his world- class championship designs in Pennsylvania and in Kentucky.

Plot Casey, a rebellious teenage girl, is travelling with her mother Elaine, her stepfather Jonah, and her two younger half-siblings, Miranda and Paulie, to spend the New Year holiday at the secluded home of Elaine's sister, Chloe. Chloe, her husband Robbie, and their two young children, Nicky and Leah, welcome their visitors. Shortly after arriving, Paulie steps near some bushes and begins vomiting, which the adults believe is due to travel sickness or just some random bug as is usual for kids to catch. As the night progresses, Nicky and Leah also begin to show symptoms of an illness. Leah's vomit is shown magnified, where strange bacteria is proliferating exponentially. As everyone goes to bed, the family cat, Jinxie, goes missing. Casey, back at the woods, on the phone with a friend makes plans to escape later and attend a party, when she's startled by cat Jinxie snarling. However, she is not able to locate the cat, as snippets of the kids are seen playing in the bedroom, some of their play foreshadowing violence. By the next day, all of the children have become seemingly pale and infected. Casey has made contact with her friend who is to come pick her up at 2 p.m. The children and men are playing in the snow, and one of the children has Jinxie's collar in the play tent. At one point Jonah is discussing viruses with Robbie, and Miranda is whining because she feels poorly. Paulie shoves a sled downhill that hits Chloe, grazing her. Jonah is angry enough to spank Paulie. Robbie goes to smoke a blunt in the greenhouse, and Casey joins him, asking if she can have some. He sees her tattoo and asks about it. It is a fetus, the umbilical cord connected to her bellybutton, as represents \\"the abortion that got away\\" Casey herself. Chloe steps in and interrupts them. At dinner, Chloe mentions the tattoo and Elaine is upset. Miranda suddenly has a violent burst, scratching Chloe and ruining the food. While Jonah tries to comfort Miranda (his little \\"princess\\") upstairs, Robbie takes the rest of the children outside to play in the snow. As Robbie is sledding downhill, Nicky places a garden rake in the sled's path, which slices open Robbie's head on impact. The children scream, drawing the attention of Casey, Jonah, Elaine, and Chloe, as Robbie bleeds out in the snow. Elaine phones an ambulance, but Robbie quickly dies from his injuries. Paulie attacks Jonah with a knife, slicing his arm, then runs off before luring Elaine to a climbing frame and breaking her leg. Casey rescues her and they seek refuge in the greenhouse which is attacked by the kids with rocks, the resulting glass shards raining down dangerously upon them. Paulie crawls inside and attempts to stab them but is fended off by Casey who convinces Elaine something is wrong with the kids. Meanwhile, Chloe finds Robbie’s body has been dragged into the children’s play tent where it has been mutilated, a baby doll shoved within his cut-open stomach; she is then attacked by Leah and is saved by Casey. Chloe panics, blaming Casey for what is happening before fleeing into the house while Casey returns to the greenhouse and saves Elaine who in turn saves Casey by shoving off an attacking Paulie, who falls backward onto a protruding shard of glass, killing him. Jonah finds Paulie dead and attempts to hide him from Chloe. The group enter the house where Chloe accuses Casey and Elaine of going insane when Casey says Elaine killed Paulie only in order to save her. Jonah and Chloe abandon them in anger and leave to find Chloe’s missing kids. Casey starts barricading the house and Jonah and Chloe are separated in the woods, where Chloe is soon attacked by her kids and stabbed in the eye with a crayon, killing her. Casey finds Miranda beating the dead cat in the bedroom and attacks her; Jonah is tricked by Miranda into believing that Casey attacked them, so he slams Casey into a wall and hits her in the head with a toy, locking Casey in the bedroom before dragging Elaine back to the couch and telling her she deserved it, then going to another room calling for Miranda. Miranda removes the splint Casey had put on Elaine's broken leg, before running to Jonah. In the house, as Elaine attempts to drag herself upstairs to free Casey, Leah and Nicky seemingly enter through the pet door. Elaine is at the bedroom where Casey is locked in as the children come up the stairs, Nicky holding his mother's earring that he pulled free from her ear. Elaine is attacked by Leah and Nicky but is unable to hurt them due to them being just kids, so relents to them as they pounce upon her with a knife. Casey, fearing for her mother, breaks a panel of the bedroom door and kills Nicky, saving Elaine while Leah flees into the woods. Casey and Elaine flee the house and down the road find Jonah dead by Chloe's crashed car, Miranda mysteriously absent. As Casey investigates Jonah's body, Miranda suddenly attacks her. Elaine rams her with the car, killing Miranda and saving Casey. As they compose themselves, they suddenly notice various infected kids, including Leah, emerge from the woods all around. As Elaine had just noticed Casey vomiting in the woods, she's unsure whether to let Casey back in the car. Ultimately, as the children encroach upon them, she's unable to leave Casey behind and they drive off. As Elaine panics, Casey's demeanor changes and starts staring into space like the infected children did and the film ends leaving the audience wondering if the now wry smiling Casey has become infected too. Cast Box office The film opened at 10th place in the UK, grossing only £98,205 at 132 cinemas. In the weeks after its release, the film dropped to 13th place and then again to 22nd place. Critical response The film opened to generally positive reviews from UK critics. The Guardian writer Phelim O'Neill said, \\"the violence is skilfully enough executed to make you think you see much more than you actually do and the fundamentally disturbing and creepy aspects about such random and unpredictable child-centric mayhem are always present, no matter how ludicrously intense and darkly humorous things get\\". Time Out gave the film four out of five stars and said \\"This taboo-shattering movie taps in to primal fears about the unknow-ability of children, its blood-stained virgin snow and insidious terror recalling cruel fairy tales and ‘demon child’ movies such as The Omen.\\" In the United States reviewers were equally positive. Bloody Disgusting said \\"The Children has it all and is guaranteed to please even the hardest to satisfy horror fan.\\" IGN said of the film \\"The Children is a flawlessly mounted horror film that knows exactly how to scare its audience.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 17 critics. The site's consensus praises it as \\"Unsettling and spine-chilling low-budget British horror, with effective and disturbing scares\\".

It is primarily used in film still photography, so as not to interfere with the shooting of principal photography, and also in other situations where sound is distracting: theatrical photography, surveillance, and wildlife photography. It was invented by Irving Jacobson in the mid-1960s, and revolutionized film still photography by allowing stills to be taken during shooting, rather than after the fact.Hollywood Still Photography, by Patrick Ecclesine  Construction  thumb In construction, it is a rigid box, filled with foam, with holes for the lens and viewfinder, and switches so one can focus and release the shutter from the outside of the case. One can make one using an existing camera case and a cable release; Pelican cases by Pelican Products are frequently mentioned. A soft enclosure, the Camera Muzzle, is made by Sam Cranston; this is less effective than a hard enclosure, but significantly cheaper and easier to use; it is designed to be sufficient for most non-intrusive use, but not for demanding use such as film sets. Nikon makes a leatherette soft camera case, the CS-13 (NIK446), which suppresses sound somewhat, but is designed primarily for the film advance of film cameras, and provides little effective suppression for digital cameras.

Antiquity Map of the Balkans in the 6th century AD illustrating the Roman provinces, major settlements and roads. After the region fell to the Romans in 168 BC, it became part of the province of Macedonia. The central portion of modern Albania was later split off as Epirus nova (\\"New Epirus\\"), while the southern remained under Epirus vetus and the northern parts belonged to Praevalitana. Barbarian invasions In the first decades under Byzantine rule (until 461), Epirus nova suffered the devastation of raids by Visigoths, Huns, and Ostrogoths. In the 4th century barbarian tribes began to prey upon the Roman Empire. The Germanic Goths and Asiatic Huns were the first to arrive, invading in mid-century; the Avars attacked in 570; and the Slavic Serbs and Croats overran the region in the early 7th century. About fifty years later, the Bulgars conquered much of the Balkan Peninsula and extended their domain to the lowlands of what is now central Albania. In general, the invaders destroyed or weakened Roman and Byzantine cultural centers in the lands that would become Albania. Middle Ages Church split Since the 1st and 2nd century, Christianity had become the established religion in most of the eastern Roman Empire, supplanting pagan polytheism. But, though the country was in the fold of Byzantium, Christians in the region remained under the jurisdiction of the Pope of Rome until 732. In that year the iconoclast Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian, angered by archbishops of the region because they had supported Rome in the Iconoclastic Controversy, detached the church of the province from the Roman pope and placed it under the patriarch of Constantinople. When the Christian church split in 1054 between the East and Rome, the region of southern Albania retained its ties to Constantinople while the north reverted to the jurisdiction of Rome. This split marked the first significant religious fragmentation of the country. Byzantine rule and conflicts with Western powers Later, in the early 9th century, the Byzantine government established the theme of Dyrrhachium, based in the city of the same name and covering most of the coast, while the interior was left under Slavic and later Bulgarian control. Full Byzantine control over modern Albania was established only after the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria in the early 11th century. In his History written in 1079-1080, Byzantine historian Michael Attaliates referred to the Albanoi as having taken part in a revolt against Constantinople in 1043 and to the Arbanitai as subjects of the duke of Dyrrachium. It is disputed, however, whether that refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense.Pritsak, Omeljan (1991). \\"Albanians\\". Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium. 1. New York/Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 52-53. However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaliates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion in 1078, is undisputed. The wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series Authors Alexandru Madgearu, Martin Gordon Editor Martin Gordon Translated by Alexandru Madgearu Edition illustrated Publisher Scarecrow Press, 2008 , It was supposed that those Albanoi from 1042 were Normans from Sicily, called by an archaic name (the Albanoi were an independent tribe from Southern Italy). The following instance is indisputable. It comes from the same Attaliates, who wrote that the Albanians (Arbanitai) were involved in the 1078 rebellion of... p. 25 At this point, they are already fully Christianized. In the late 11th and 12th centuries, the region played a crucial part in the Byzantine–Norman Wars; Dyrrhachium was the westernmost terminus of the Via Egnatia, the main overland route to Constantinople, and was one of the main targets of the Normans (cf. Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)). Towards the end of the 12th century, as Byzantine central authority weakened and rebellions and regionalist secessionism became more common, the region of Arbanon became an autonomous principality ruled by its own hereditary princes. After the Fourth Crusade, the region came under the control of the Despotate of Epirus, but its control was never firm. Serbian influence began to be strongly felt at this time, as well as those of Venice and later of the Kingdom of Sicily, as both powers tried to gain control of coastal Albania for their purposes. The new administrative system of the themes, or military provinces created by the Byzantine Empire, contributed to the eventual rise of feudalism in Albania, as peasant soldiers who served military lords became serfs on their landed estates. Among the leading families of the Albanian feudal nobility were the Thopias, Balshas, Shpatas, Muzakas, Aranitis, Dukagjins, and Kastriotis. The first three of these rose to become rulers of principalities that were practically independent of Byzantium.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42642/The- Roman-Empire In 1258, the Sicilians took possession of the island of Corfu and the Albanian coast, from Dyrrhachium to Valona and Buthrotum and as far inland as Berat. This foothold, reformed in 1272 as the \\"Kingdom of Albania\\", was intended by the dynamic Sicilian ruler, Charles of Anjou, to become the launchpad for an overland invasion of the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines however managed to recover most of Albania by 1274, leaving only Valona and Dyrrhachium in Charles' hands. Finally, when Charles launched his much-delayed advance, it was stopped at the Siege of Berat in 1280–1281. Albania would remain largely part of Byzantine empire until the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347, when it fell shortly to the hands of the Serbian ruler Stephen Dushan.

He came five lengths off the lead turning for home, and built up enough strength to propel himself to the front so that he could fight with the front-runner. When they finished, there was a gap of 7½ lengths back to the third-place finisher. He finished the race in a sharp time of 1:22.42. He made his second appearance in an allowance race at Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans, Louisiana. The race was distanced at 1 mile and 40 yards, and he finished in front by a head.

It is intended to deter, and respond to, military aggression against any of the GCC member countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Creation In 1984, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) decided to create a joint military force of 10,000 soldiers divided into two brigades, called the Peninsula Shield Force, based in Saudi Arabia near the Kuwaiti and Iraqi borders. The PSF is composed of infantry, armor, artillery, and combat support elements from each of the GCC countries. In 1992, the Peninsula Shield Force was headed by a Saudi Arabian, based near King Khalid Military City at Hafar al Batin, and had one infantry brigade of 5,000 men from all the GCC member states. As of late 2006, the Peninsula Shield Force had 7,000 personnel and functioned as a joint intervention force to defend the joint border of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. In November 2006, the GCC Joint Defense Council considered a Saudi proposal to expand the capabilities of the Shield and to establish a joint command and control system. In December 2007, Kuwait's National Security Council chief Shaikh Ahmed Fahad Al Ahmed Al Sabah announced that the GCC plans to create a replacement for the Peninsula Shield Force. He stated that \\"the GCC options would always be unified just as they were when leaders declared the establishment of a common market at the Doha Summit.\\" Leadership and structure , the Peninsula Shield Force was commanded by Saudi Major General Mutlaq bin Salem al-Azima and has about 40,000 troops and continues to have its permanent base at King Khalid Military City near Hafar al Batin. According to Peninsula Shield Force commander al-Azima, any intervention by the force must include participation from all GCC member states. Use of the Peninsula Shield Force 1990–91 The Peninsula Shield Force was not sufficiently developed to be deployed in defence of Kuwait ahead of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990. A force of about 3,000 men from the Peninsula Shield Force, in addition to forces of its member states, took part in the liberation of Kuwait in March 1991. 2003 10,000 troops and two ships of Peninsula Shield Force were deployed to Kuwait in February 2003 ahead of the Iraq War to protect Kuwait from potential Iraqi attacks. It did not participate in operations against Iraq. Role in Bahraini uprising On 14 March 2011, the Bahraini government requested Peninsula Shield Forces enter Bahrain via the causeway from Saudi Arabia. Forces were from Saudi Arabia and the UAE entered Bahrain while Kuwait and Oman refrained from sending troops. The Bahraini uprising was the first GCC deployment in relation to an internal threat., In late March, Peninsula Shield Force commander al-Azima stated that the role of the force in Bahrain was to \\"secure Bahrain's vital and strategically important military infrastructure from any foreign interference\\" and to protect Bahraini borders while Bahrain security forces are \\"preoccupied with [Bahraini] internal security\\". He denied that the force caused any Bahraini citizen to \\"suffer so much as a scratch\\", and said that the force entered Bahrain \\"to bring goodness, peace, and love\\". The 2011 Bahraini intervention, involved about 10% of the Peninsula Shield Force. Every military unit present in Bahrain included soldiers from all six GCC member states. While some have argued that this was a Saudi attempt to block democratic processes taking hold, Bahraini officials argued that the Peninsula Shield Force was there to protect government facilities, rather than to intrude in the internal affairs of the country itself. In October 2011 the Peninsula Shield announced its intention to sue \\"a number of satellite TV channels for propagating lies and allegations about the Peninsula Shield forces that entered Bahrain\\". This followed persistent claims by these channels about the Gulf forces strafing demonstrators with warplanes and destroying mosques. Frequent Saudi Arabian street protests in and near Qatif in mid to late March, originally calling for political prisoners to be released, extended to opposition to the Peninsula Shield Force's presence in Bahrain. American urging of closer defense ties Chuck Hagel called for greater defense cooperation in the GCC, including block sales of American arms to the organization. On 11 December 2013, the GCC announced the formation of a joint military command. In 2016, Saudi Arabia held a military drill named \\"North Thunder\\", a consortium of 20 countries to display its military cooperation with Arab countries. Pakistan, Djibouti and other nations also contributed to the drill.

Comfort, Encountering the Manuscripts: An Introduction to New Testament Paleography & Textual Criticism, (Nashville, Tennessee: Broadman & Holman Publishers), 2005, p. 76. The manuscript is currently housed in the Papyrology Rooms of the Sackler Library at Oxford University, with the shelf number P. Oxy. 4494.  Description  Papyrus 110 verso The original manuscript would've been around 12 cm x 22 cm, with 40–43 lines per page. The handwriting script is representative of the Reformed Documentary or Professional (bookhand) style.Comfort, P. W., & Barrett, D. P. (2001). The text of the earliest New Testament Greek manuscripts, pp. 656 The Greek text of this fragment (and its parent codex) is considered to be representative of the Alexandrian text-type. Textual VariantsTaken from NA27 Edition Apparatus, and http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/nt-transcripts  :\\\\mathfrak{P}110 has several unique readings in Matt 10:14. * εξερχομενων υμων (as you are leaving) — This genitive absolute is a unique textual variant. All other witnesses have εξερχομενοι, a nominative plural participle, normally interpreted as semitism for an imperative (Leave!). \\\\mathfrak{P}110 specifies that the plurality of people leaving (εξερχομαι, literally 'coming out') is explicitly 'all of you' (υμας)—the disciples whom Jesus is addressing. * πολεως η κωμης (city or village) — \\\\mathfrak{P}110 agrees with Codex Sinaiticus (א), Minuscule 892 and Family 13 (f13). Other witnesses, including Codex Vaticanus (B) omit η κωμης. * omit εκεινης (that) — \\\\mathfrak{P}110 agrees with Codex Bezae (D) and Old-Latin manuscripts. The majority of witnesses include this feminine demonstrative, agreeing with two feminine nouns οικια (house) and πολις. (It would also agree with κωμη.) * απο (from) — This is another unique variant. Codex Sinaiticus (א), Codex Ephraemi (C), Minuscule 33 and 892 have εκ. Codex Vaticanus and other manuscripts have no preposition, just the genitive case, normally interpreted as a genitive of separation. * εκμαξατε (wipe) — This too is a unique variant, all other witnesses have εκτιναξατε (shake). {   Matthew 10:14 in \\\\mathfrak{P}110  Matthew 10:14 in Editio Regia (1550)  Matthew 10:14 in NA27 -FFEBCD\\"  και ος εαν μη δεξηται υμας μηδε ακουση τους λογους εξερχομενων υμων εξω της οικιας η της πολεως η κωμης εκμαξατε τον κονιορτον απο των ποδων υμων.  και ος εαν μη δεξηται υμας μηδε ακουση τους λογους υμων, εξερχομενοι της οικιας η της πολεως εκεινης εκτιναξατε τον κονιορτον των ποδων υμων.  και ος αν μη δεξηται υμας μηδε ακουση τους λογους υμων, εξερχομενοι εξω της οικιας η της πολεως εκεινης εκτιναξατε τον κονιορτον των ποδων υμων. - And if anyone does not accept you nor listen to the words, as you leave, out of the house or the city or village, wipe the dust away from your feet. And if anyone does not accept you nor listen to your words, leave that house or city, shake the dust from your feet. And whoever does not accept you nor listen to your words, leave, out of that house or city, shake the dust from your feet. } 10:25 (1) (word order) :επεκαλεσαν βεελζεβουλ: \\\\mathfrak{P}110c :βεελζεβουλ επεκαλεσαν: אc2, C, W, f13, 33, \\\\mathfrak{M}, it, syh, co, Cyp :10:25 (a) ::βεελσεβουλ: \\\\mathfrak{P}110* ::βεελζεβουλ: \\\\mathfrak{P}110c, Θ, 0171, f1 700, 1424, L, N, pm ::βεεζεβουλ: אc2, B, pc :10:25 (b) ::επεκαλεσεν: \\\\mathfrak{P}110* ::επεκαλεσαν: \\\\mathfrak{P}110c, אc2, B, C, W, f13, 33, \\\\mathfrak{M}, it, syh, co, Cyp ::επεκαλεσαντο: א*, L, N, pc ::εκαλεσαν: Θ, 0171 f1, 700, 1424, pm ::καλουσιν: D 10:25 (2) :τοις: \\\\mathfrak{P}110*, B :τους: א, D, C, W, f13, \\\\mathfrak{M}, it, syh, co 10:25 (3) :οικιοις: \\\\mathfrak{P}110* :οικιους: \\\\mathfrak{P}110c :οικιακοις: B :οικειακους: D :οικιακους: א, C, W, f13, \\\\mathfrak{M}, it, syh, co  See also  * List of New Testament papyri * Matthew 10 * Oxyrhynchus Papyri  References   Further reading  * Cockle, Walter E.

The Giessen nappe has the same colour as the Hörre zone, which is on the other, northwestern side of the Lahn syncline. The Giessen nappe () is a tectonic nappe in the southeastern part of the Rhenish Massif in western Germany. The nappe is an \\"alien\\" (allochthonous) unit in the Rhenohercynian zone of the Hercynian orogeny, it was thrusted over the usual slightly metamorphosed Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary rocks in this zone.Walter et al. (1992), p. 179 The Giessen nappe is often correlated with the Harz nappe in the HarzHuckriede et al. (2004) and similar units in the Bohemian Massif in the Czech Republic.Kalvoda et al. (2006), pp. 53-54 These units form the rare erosional leftovers of small microcontinents that were during the Hercynian orogeny squeezed between the paleocontinents Gondwana to the south and Laurussia to the north. Outcrop area Giessen nappe outcrops cover about 300 km2 from the western edge of the Vogelsberg over Braunfels, Wetzlar and Gießen, almost to Marburg. The river Lahn flows along the northern part of the nappe until it crosses the nappe between Gießen and Wetzlar to continue flowing westwards to the Rhine. Lithology and stratigraphy The Giessen nappe consists of a thin sequence of slightly metamorphosed Lower and Middle Devonian slates and radiolarites covered with Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous greywackes.Dörr (1990) At some spots along the base of the Giessen nappe alien tectonic slices of metabasalt occur. Chemical analysis of these rocks shows they were originally mid ocean ridge basalts.Grösser & Dörr (1986) Especially the Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous greywackes are clearly different from the rocks of this age of the Rhenohercynian basin, that now form the footwall of the Giessen nappe. This difference in lithology led German geologist Franz Kossmat in 1927 to the conclusion that the Giessen nappe is an allochthonous unit. The base thrust of the Giessen nappe consists of cataclasites, breccias and mylonites and forms a semi-horizontal thrust plane. Locally the thrust plane can be deformed by late stage folding and thrusting. Erosion has separated some small pieces of the nappe from the central mass, forming small klippes in the vicinity of Braunfels and Wetzlar. Internally, the rocks of the nappe are isoclinally folded and cut by shear zones. Notes Literature *; 1988: Die geologische Entwicklung der östlichen Lahnmulde (Exkursion C. am 7.

This squadron was a \\"White\\" (that is, anti-communist and anti-revolutionary) unit during the Russian Civil War. It was known also as the Russian Squadron (Русская Эскадра). History In 1920 the last remnants of the former Denikin's forces were confined to the Crimean Peninsula and commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel. In November 1920 the Bolsheviks captured the White position and the White forces evacuated to Turkey. The fleet was re-organised under the command of Rear Admiral Mikhail Alexandrovich Kedrov and was granted asylum by the French. The fleet moved to Bizerte in Tunisia by February 1921 and was interned there under the command of Rear Admiral Mikhail Berens. As well as the crews of the ships, the Russian community included 4,500 civilian refugees. The French government recognized the Soviet Union in 1924 and gave ownership of the ships to the Soviets. A technical commission directed by Alexei Krylov arrived in Bizerte in December and found the warships unrepairable. The ships were sold as scrap metal by the Soviet government in Bizerte.

Blumberg (1906 – October 8, 1997) was an American philosopher and political activist. He was an official of the Communist Party for several years before joining the Democratic Party as a district leader. Early life Albert was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to a middle-class Litvak family. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University and then furthered his education by acquiring a master's degree from Yale, studying at the Sorbonne, and receiving a doctorate from the University of Vienna. While studying in Vienna he became attracted to the Vienna circle of Logical Positivists, founded by the German philosopher Moritz Schlick. Professional life Within philosophy Albert Blumberg was best known for having co-authored with Herbert Feigl a paper which appeared in the Journal of Philosophy entitled, \\"Logical Positivism: A New Movement In European Philosophy.\\" For logical positivists the discipline of philosophy hinged on one task; to clarify the meanings of concepts and ideas, and what sort of statements really did have any \\"meaning\\" in the first place. There are only two distinctions of statements that have any meaning to logical positivists. The first involves necessary truths of logic, mathematics, and ordinary language. The second involves empirical propositions about the world around us that were not necessary truths, instead they are regarded as true with greater or lesser probability. In addition to being a student and professor of philosophy, Albert Blumberg also fought for economic and social reforms. In the year 1933 he joined the Maryland Communist Party where he served for four years as the chair of the Agitprop Committee. Political activism In 1937 Blumberg resigned his faculty position at Johns Hopkins, publicly announced his party membership, and took on the created position of district administrative secretary for the Communist Party. Blumberg also ran for public office on several occasions, for example, Communist candidate for Mayor of Baltimore City, 1939. As well Blumberg was several times under suspicion by various governmental organizations for communist activities, becoming one of the first convicted under a provision of the 1940 Smith Act. During his senior years Blumberg remained politically active, although not in the communist party. He enjoyed somewhat more success as the Democratic Party district leader in Manhattan. He died at the age of 91 near his home in Manhattan, New York City. See also *American philosophy *List of American philosophers References * Sarkar, Sahota, and Jessica Pfeifer.

The abandoned mine is located in Riverside County, California within the boundaries of the Joshua Tree National Park and is included on the National Register of Historic Places. A hiking trail leads to the mine. The mine is associated with Jim McHaney, a local cattle rustler, and Bill Keys, a noted rancher. The mine facilities are largely ruinous. The mine was not spectacularly successful but was sufficiently productive to remain in operation for nearly seventy-five years. The mine itself consisted of several vertical and horizontal shafts, of which four vertical shafts, five inclined shafts, and ten horizontal adits remain. Tailings piles appear in several places, with quantities of machinery scattered about the site. The mine was established by a man named Frank L. James in the early 1890s. The rich ore initially found prompted local outlaw gang leader and cattle rustler Jim McHaney to take over the mine. McHaney sent two of his men, Charley Martin and a man named Myers, to demand the mine from James. James refused, and Martin shot and killed him with a gun borrowed from Myers, after forcing James to sign over the property. Martin was acquitted of murder charges on grounds of self-defense. When the mine was first claimed by Jim McHaney, it was reported to be the Lost \\"Peg-Leg\\" mine of prospector Thomas Long \\"Pegleg\\" Smith. McHaney initially prospered but borrowed heavily to expand and fell behind on payments to the bank, ultimately losing the mine. The mine passed into the hands of William F. Keys around 1917, who operated the mine until 1961.

The shoreline of the port is between 10° 50’56’’ N and 10° 49’44’’ N. Karaikal Port project began with a Letter of Interest issued by Govt. of Pondicherry for development of a port at Karaikal in September 2005. MARG Ltd. signed the concession agreement in 2006 and work began in February, 2007. Phase 1 was envisaged to be operational in Aug 2009. Karaikal Port became operational in April 2009 when it received its first vessel. Phase 1 comprises 2 Panamax size berths capable of handling 5.2 million MT of cargo per annum. The port has received over 1655 vessels since Commercial Operations and has handled over 55 million MT of various cargo. KPPL has partners in Ocean Sparkle (marine operations) and PSTS (Stevedoring).

The > Iraq war, of course, is an important, serious, complex, and critical topic > for a high school to address…When the Theatre Arts teacher first broached > the idea of a play honoring soldiers in Iraq, we supported exploring it with > the understanding that there would be on-going communication between the > teacher and administration.

Wilton, CT March 24, 2007 Due in part to the high school's proximity to New York City and its activist theater community, the controversy began to garner outside attention. The New York Times, Fox News, CBS, and ABC each provided coverage of the unfolding events.  The play  The play itself centers around varied narratives of the Iraq War. Student portrayed soldiers, Iraqis, and others whose lives had been altered by the conflict. Some students contacted the very soldiers they were portraying in order to interview them.

D. Hoard, a former governor of Wisconsin. Hoard used the farm as a laboratory for testing ideas for his magazine Hoard's Dairyman, like the use of alfalfa for feeding dairy cattle. This farm was begun in the mid-1800s by Asa Snell. Much has changed since Snell's era, but a few of his buildings survive: the 1845 farmhouse, a machine shed/garage, a horse- barn/heifer shed, and the core of the main dairy barn. Snell's farmhouse is a two-story Italianate-styled building, with walls of brick made nearby at a brickyard owned by Snell himself and Milo Jones. A kitchen wing extends to the east leading to a summer kitchen, and other wings extend to the north and south. The house's roof was originally flat. Hoard replaced the flat roofs with hip roofs soon after he bought the farm. With Hoard bought the farm in 1899. Before then he had served in the Civil War, edited the _Jefferson County Union_ newspaper, started the Wisconsin Dairyman's Association, founded the important agricultural journal _Hoard's Dairyman_ in 1885, and served one term as governor of Wisconsin from 1889 to 1891. Despite his venture into politics, Hoard remained very interested in agriculture and the scientific improvement of dairy practices. He bought the farm to use as a lab for testing the effectiveness and practicality of the ideas that he promoted in his magazine. These are some of the important innovations tested at the farm: * Alfalfa: Hoard showed that this perennial legume could be grown in northern climates. He demonstrated practical methods of growing, harvesting, and preserving the crop. He further showed that it could be used as a high-quality feed for dairy cattle. Today, alfalfa is a staple in dairy cattle rations nationwide. * Record keeping on farms: The Hoard farm started keeping a herd book in 1905 and milk records back to 1920. These records support informed decisions about animals and practices. * Silos and silage: The farm tried this economical method for fermenting cattle feed, rather than drying it. * Eradication of bovine tuberculosis: Hoard had begun promoting a campaign against TB in 1895, and continued it at the farm. * Loose pen housing: In 1912 Hoard began advocating raising cattle in pens rather than individual stalls, aiming to save construction costs and ongoing labor. This is now common practice. thumb * Herd test: Starting in 1917 Hoard's farm \\"was the dominating influence in the founding of the herd test, proved sire, brood cow research program conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\\" * Single-purpose dairy cow: The farm maintains the oldest continuously registered herd of Guernsey cattle in the country. For over a century, the herd was housed in the same barn that was purchased by Hoard in 1899. It was enlarged several times to a final capacity of eighty cows. In the summer of 2007, the herd was moved to a new, state of the art free-stall facility and expanded to 270 milking cows.

Biography  Bittner was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania, on February 25, 1904, the son of the late Martin and Minnie Bittner. John was one of four children, he had a brother and two sisters all of whom were highly educated. As a young man he was so proficient in baseball, basketball, and track that he received offers of athletic scholarships at several schools. He chose to attend St. Stephen's College (now Bard College) where he received a B.A. degree in 1925, with honors in biology. He taught at Donaldson Preparatory School, Ilchester, Maryland, for one year before beginning graduate work at the University of Michigan. While there he received his M.S. degree in 1929, and his Ph.D. in 1930. His Ph.D. thesis was entitled \\"A Genetic Study of the Transplantation of Tumors Arising in Hybrid Mice.\\" His work on the genetics of breast cancer in mice, begun during his graduate years at Michigan, was continued at the newly formed Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Laboratory at Bar Harbor, Maine. The founding director of the lab was Clarence Cook Little, who had previously been the President of the University of Michigan. Thus, aware of Bittner's research, Little offered him a position as a Research Associate at the Jackson Laboratory. In 1940 Bittner became the lab's Assistant Director, where he remained until December 1942. After a fire at the Jackson Laboratory in 1947, Bittner was one of the main contributors of replacement mice because he still had the purebred mouse strains needed to continue their research. In January 1943 he became the George Chase Christian Professor of Cancer Research and Director of the Division of Cancer Biology at the University of Minnesota. He held this appointment until his death, of a heart attack, on December 14, 1961. In addition, Bittner was a consultant for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York for almost a decade prior to his death.  Cancer research  By far, the greatest impact of Bittner's contributions to cancer research was the discovery in 1936, while working at the Jackson Lab, that a cancerous agent, which he called a \\"milk factor\\", could be transmitted by cancerous mothers to young mice while nursing. Bittner used two families of mice: in Family A, almost all the mice, across many generations, developed breast cancer; in Family B, cancer seldom occurred. He then took a number of newborn mice from Family A, away from their cancerous mothers, and set them to nurse with immune mothers in Family B. Next, Bittner took babies from the immune Family B and set them to nurse with cancerous mothers from Family A. The result was that the young mice switched their cancer tendencies. Three out of four mice, which came from healthy Family B, developed cancer and died of it, while those originally from Family A remained healthy. Bittner noted that something in mouse milk appeared to pass the disease along. In other words, nursing mice transmit this agent, or \\"Bittner virus,\\" in their milk, which ultimately leads to tumors in their offspring. In addition, Bittner felt that genetic and hormonal influences, along with the milk agent, contributed to the origin of cancer. In 1966, it was proven that Bittner's \\"milk factor\\" was a virus that remained dormant during the early life of the young mouse but produced cancer when hormonal conditions were right in middle age. The Bittner virus is now known as the Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a retrovirus. (see Timeline of Discovery 1936 under Oncovirus). In 1947-48, Bittner was president of the American Association for Cancer Research and was a member of their board of directors from 1945 to 1951. He also served on the editorial advisory board of Cancer Research from 1941-1957. Throughout his career, Bittner served on numerous committees dealing with cancer research. During the summer of 1947, he was a member of the Medical Teaching Mission to Austria, sponsored by the Unitarian Service Committee, of the World Health Organization to \\"promote international exchange of medical and scientific knowledge.\\" Bittner authored, or co-authored, over 240 papers on cancer research, and contributed chapters to several books. He lectured widely in this country and abroad and attended many national and international meetings.  Honors  Bittner received many awards, citations, and medals during his career. The most notable include the following: * 1941 The Alvarenga Award - American College of Physicians in Philadelphia * 1950 Medal of the American Cancer Study * 1950 Honorary Doctor of Science Degree - Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York * 1951 1st Comfort Crookshank Award - Middlesex Hospital Medical School, London * 1957 Bertner Foundation Award - M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, University of Texas Medical School, Houston * 1957 Doctor of Medicine and Surgery honoris causae - University of Perugia, Italy  References  Ruddy, Kathleen T, MD \\"The End of Breast Cancer: A Virus and the Hope for a Vaccine\\" Skyhorse Publishing Inc (2017)(Previously published as \\"Of Mice and Women: Unraveling the Mystery of the Breast Cancer Virus\\") (2015) Rader, Karen A. \\"Making Mice Standardizing Animals For American Biomedical Research 1900-1955\\" Princeton University Press (2004) * \\"University of Minnesota, Institute for Molecular Virology, UMN Virology Timeline\\" * \\"Obituary, John Joseph Bittner, 1904-1961\\" * Science 1, May 1942 \\"The Milk-Influence of Breast Tumors in Mice\\" * Journal of Virology, June 1970 \\"Morphogenesis of Bittner Virus\\" Time Magazine articles: * May 24, 1971 Breast Cancer and Virus * March 18, 1946 Cancer Virus * June 9, 1941 Suckling’ Cancer Category:American geneticists Category:Cancer researchers Category:1904 births Category:1962 deaths Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Bard College alumni Category:University of Minnesota faculty Category:People from Meadville, Pennsylvania Category:20th-century American physicians ","title":"John Joseph Bittner"},{"id":"20259456","text":"The practice of dentistry in Canada is overseen by the National Dental Examining Board of Canada in conjunction with other agencies, such as the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada and the Royal College of Dentists of Canada. In 2013 there were 21,109 dentists in Canada according to the Canadian Dental Association.  Licensure  Dentistry is a regulated profession in Canada. In order to practice dentistry, a dentist must obtain a license or permit from the province or territory they wish to practice in. The main requirement to obtain licensure in all Canadian provinces and territories is passing the National Dental Examination Board exams. Several provinces require applicants to complete a jurisprudence and ethics examination which tests knowledge related to local laws, ethics, and regulation of the profession.  NDEB examination  Candidates seeking to practice dentistry in Canada must successfully complete a two-part examination administered by the National Dental Examining Board of Canada (NDEB). Dental students at accredited Canadian and American dental schools are permitted to take the examination no earlier than 3 months prior to graduation, which usually means the March of their graduating year. Upon successful completion of the exam, the NDEB issues a certificate to the candidate. To be eligible to write the NDEB exam, candidates must have: # Graduated from an accredited dental school in Canada, the United States, Australia (since 2011), New Zealand (since 2011), or Ireland (since 2012) or # Passed the equivalency process for graduates of other dental schools (foreign trained dentists). Qualifying (advanced standing) programs and the equivalency process for foreign-trained dentists Foreign-trained dentists can obtain a DMD or DDS from an accredited dental school in Canada or the United States by enrolling in a qualifying or advanced standing program. Typically, the program would consist of the last two to three years of a typical dental program. The dental schools that offer these programs in Canada are: *Dalhousie University *University of Alberta *University of British Columbia *University of Toronto *University of Manitoba *University of Western Ontario *McGill University *Université de Montréal *University of Saskatchewan In 2011, the equivalency process for foreign trained dentists was launched. The process consists of three exams: # Assessment of fundamental knowledge written exam. # Assessment of clinical skills exam: a practical exam on typodonts and manikins. # Assessment of clinical judgement written exam. The alternative route of going through a qualifying program or advanced standing program still exists. To gain a licence to practice dentistry in Canada: there is International Dentist Advanced Placement Program (IDAPP).Non-accredited programs Countries recognised by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of Canada (CDAC) or the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) are: Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, USA. If you qualified in a country not listed above, you will be considered non-accredited. When it first launched in 2011, only 44 candidates passed the equivalency process. In 2014 over 260 candidates passed and in 2017, that number rose to 307 candidates. These numbers are expected to keep going up as the number of candidates challenging the exams has been rising steadily year after year.  Over saturation of dentists in Canada  According to the Canadian Dental Association, the population-to-dentist ratio has been dropping in all provinces and territories. This dentist glut is resulting in growing competition and tough times for dentists especially in urban centres like Toronto.  Dental Groups in Canada  dentalcorp is Canada’s largest network of dental clinics. It started in 2011 and has grown to over 450 locations serving 2 million Canadians . Altima Dental was established in 1993 and has over 30 dental offices. Other dental groups include 123dentist ,Dental Choice and tooth corner Dental. Achievements The first woman to be licensed as a dentist in Canada was Emma Gaudreau Casgrain in 1898. She was trained by her husband, dental surgeon Henri-Edmond Casgrain, an innovator in dentistry.

Kowalsky (August 16, 1859 - November 28, 1914) was a notable San Francisco defense attorney. Notably, he was employed by King Leopold II of Belgium as a lobbyist to the US government in favor of the Congo Free State.https://archive.org/details/briefofhenryikow00kowa Kowalsky was known as \\"Colonel\\" without having ever been in the military. He earned the designation when he was appointed to, and served as, the Judge Advocate General for California Governor Robert Waterman.Lewis Publishing Company, The Bay of San Francisco: the metropolis of the Pacific Coast and ..., Volume 2, page 303 Biography The fourth son of Levi and Fannie Kowalsky, Henry was born in Buffalo, New York on August 16, 1859. His family moved to San Francisco, California in 1866 to join his father who had been living in different areas around the state. The young Henry attended Lincoln Grammar School in San Francisco until his graduation in 1874. His early attempt at business was short lived, selling his paper delivery route after only a few days of operation while still in school. He became the editor of a monthly magazine, originally called Our Boys Monthly Magazine, called Field and Fireside. Kowalsky's magazine became a success and he was praised for his leadership of the publication. It was discontinued, and he moved to Tomales, a small town in Marin County, California, and began working as a store clerk for his brother, Edward H. Kowalsky in 1872. Leaving the store in 1877, he and his brother became members of the United States Election Map Co., along with Henry C. Donnell and Charles S. Israel. King Leopold II controversy Kowalsky sought out the friendship of the Belgian heir apparent, Prince Albert, during one of the Prince's trips to the United States. Through this friendship, Kowalsky was introduced to King Leopold II in December 1904.Hochschild, Adam King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa King Leopold II was working to thwart negative press he was receiving in the United States, in regards to atrocities being committed in his personally owned Congo Free State. He needed someone with connections to the people who would shape the policy of the United States. The King hired Kowalsky with an annual retainer of 100,000 francs (over $2 million US in 2013 dollars). It seems however, that this new position raised the ire of Congo state officials already working in the US. After several months, Kowalsky gave them the ammunition they needed in order to work to remove him: getting into a fist fight with a creditor in open court. A year after signing it, the King let Kowalsky's hefty contract expire, embarrassing Kowalsky. He beseeched the King to reinstate it. As Kowalsky was becoming a burden, and an embarrassment to the Congo state, the King paid him off, reinstating the contract and adding 125,000 francs to go away quietly. The payoff backfired, and for a week after December 10, 1906, newspapers across the country detailed the correspondence between Kowalsky, King Leopold II, and the Congo state. This was a dreadful turn of events for the King, leading directly to joint efforts between the United States and Great Britain to end his one-man rule in the Congo.

This merger is present in many dialects, but is named for the Masovian dialect.Stanislaw Gogolewski, \\"Dialectology in Poland, 1873-1997\\", In: Towards a History of Linguistics in Poland, by E. F. K. Koerner, A. J. Szwedek (eds.) (2001) , p. 128 This phonological feature is observed in dialects of Masuria and Masovia (Masovian dialect), as well as in most of Lesser Poland and parts of Silesia, and on the periphery of Greater Poland (mainly Mazurzy wieleńscy). The boundary of mazurzenie runs from north-east to south-west. It may have originated between the 14th and 16th centuries in the Masovian dialect.Karaś, Halina. Gwary polskie: Mazurzenie A similar phenomenon, tsokanye, has been observed in the Old Novgorod dialect of Old East Slavic. It also occurs in a few areas of the Chakavian dialect of Croatian, known as tsakavism. In the Polish and Kashubian dialects there are also other similar phenomena, jabłonkowanie (in the dialects of some Silesian Górale) and kaszubienie (in many variants of Kashubian). In languages other than Slavic, a similar phenomenon can be observed in Tok Pisin, a creole language based on English, but having no post-alveolar consonants. For example, the word sip comes from English ship, and the word pisin comes from English pidgin (the consonant is additionally devoiced).

To save Rodrigo's life, Mina bites him, mutating him into a vampire, and together they take Pandora, Amélie and Petra Van Petra to \\"live\\" in Transylvania. After the end, it is revealed that Bóris has survived his death. Characters Protagonists *Bóris Vladescu An almost thousand-year-old vampire master and antagonist. He is dark, seductive, elegant and somewhat clumsy at the same time cold, cruel and malevolent. Before the beginning of the series, he fell in love with Princess Cecília but she doesn't recipocrate his feelings for her and in anger, he killed Cecília's husband, Count Rogério but in her sorrow she commits suicide rather than marry a vampire. Her death still haunts him. Several centuries, later he marries several woman in order to create an heir to his legacy since he is already tired of his position. He has a baby son with another vampiress who dies in childbirth, who he hides from his jealous wife Mina d' Montmatre, switches him with another baby and he is raised as the son of Lívia and Bobby. Bóris is an exceptionally powerful vampire, having been one of the oldest and he claims he cannot even remember how he started. He has superhuman strength, can mesmerize anyone with his eyes, can teleport to great distances, has control over animals, can summon a fiery sword to fight his enemies, can erase people's memories, and has led armies over the centuries. Bóris can shapeshift into a cloud of bats, a giant wolf, and mist. Bóris can control weather and curse other vampires by erasing their fangs, but he is also capable of possessing anyone, however while in somebody else's body, his original body becomes helpless. In the beginning, he was unlikable and harsh, considered the antagonist, but his relationship with the humans and the other characters soften his personality and he becomes more compromising, understandable, and altruistic. He desires Lívia more than anyone and wants to mutate her into his vampiress bride. Bóris bears a strong resemblance to Barnabas Collins from the TV Series Dark Shadows. *Zeca Bóris' teenage son and also a vampire. His true name is Attila Vladesco. He is the son of Bóris and his vampiress wife Marie but she died and in order to protect him and get close to Lívia, he switched him with Lívia's true son and he was raised as one of her children. When reaching the age of 13, he mutates into one of the undead as the heir of Bóris, however because of his loving personality, he doesn't become evil as his father expected, much to his chagrin and turns into a sort of \\"good vampire\\". When learning of each other, Jackie hates Bóris for making him what he is and is distrustful of him because he knows Bóris wants Zeca's adopted mother Lívia, but as the series progressed, Zeca learns to love his father and admire his good personality traits, but still defies him. Zeca never drinks blood or attacks humans but he has no problem when he uses his vampiric powers to impress anyone. He has super strength, can shapeshift into a bat or a wolf, can control his own shadow, can teleport, has telepathy and knows some few tricks but still his powers are not even a match to his father, but at one point he banished Martha Morta to Hell for a time before she returned a little bit pissed after a few seconds. He is even blessed by the angel Ezekiel, he can withstand sunlight without harm and enter churches or blessed houses. He is perhaps the only vampire who doesn't exhibit the evil behavior of other vampires in the series. Zeca has romantic feelings for a human girl called Liz and is afraid if she finds out about him, when Bóris suggested to mutate her into a vampiress, Zeca becomes disgusted and angry, and refuses to let that happen. In the final battle, Zeca helps his father who was mortally wounded by Nosferatu, and with the angel Ezekiel's help, they destroy Nosferatu. Zeca takes his father to his crypt, and weeps as he dies in his arms. Zeca tells his father he loved him so much, giving peace to Bóris in his death. Boris told Zeca, with his death, the vampiric power to sustain Zeca would be gone and he would become human. In the end, Zeca resumed his new life with his family to live happily after. His fate is unknown, because it is revealed Bóris survived his death, and it is unknown if Zeca will return to being a vampire. *Lívia The main protagonist of the show, she is a woman living in Maramures and the reincarnation of Princess Cecília, the old love of Bóris Vladescu. She has her son Renat, taken away from her without her knowledge and raised Bóris' son, Jackie as one of her own. She becomes a widow when her husband dies, who also was the reincarnation of the princess's husband, ironically both of them died at the hands of Bóris Vladesco, directly or not. Her children are Zeca, Tetê and Júnior, but it is revealed later in the series Zeca is a vampire and the real son of Bóris named Atilla Vladesco, and her real son, Renat, grew up in the orphanage until he became homeless in the streets but he was found by Zeca, who become his friend and later revealed to her, he was her true son. Lívia has a complex relationship with Bóris Vladescu, because in the beginning, he under the alias of Igor Pivomar, saw himself as a stranger in her life. Bóris then took over Rodrigo's body to have a chance with Lívia and they date for a time until Bóris could no longer stay much in his human body. When she comes to learn the vampire existence and Bóris being the head vampire and Igor Pivomar, she tries to stay away from him and come to hate and despise him for her husband's death. Over three occasions, Bóris tried to bite and mutate her, and failed in all. For the first time, he was interrupted by the angel Ezekiel, the second by Augusto, and in the third, he was interrupted by Princess Cecília's spirit herself, explaining to her she was saved by angels at the last second before hitting the ground. Lívia comes to respect Bóris when he becomes more benevolent and before the final battle against the forces of dark, he bids \\"Goodbye\\" and tells her he would love her in death, as he loved her in life and undeath. In response, she says \\"Goodbye, my darling\\". Lívia begun dating district attorney Augusto and marries him at the end of the series. During the final battle, she uses a heavenly dart to destroy Martha Morta and she protects the people from the evil vampires. After the battle, she confronts Zeca about Bóris' death. She reunited Renato with her children, marries Augusto and they have a happy life together. *Ezequiel A holy warrior with divine powers and the antagonist to Bóris Vladesco. He disguises himself as one of the citizens of Maramures, and it is also revealed he was the vampire hunter trying to protect Princess Cecília, now reincarnated as Ezequiel. He is kind and gentle, preferring to not fight the vampires and offering the chance of retreat before fighting. Ezequiel sees the people in black, white and shades of gray. He can teleport, control fire, is a skilled swordsman and can heal other people and bless them. He forms a friendship with Zeca knowing he is not an enemy, despite being his rival's son and even helps him withstand sunlight and blessed objects. Ezequiel clashes several times with Bóris but he cannot defeat him. In the final chapter, he fights Nosferatu and kills him with the help of Zeca. With the vampires destroyed or retreating to the darkness, he returns to Heaven having finished his job on Earth. *Augusto: A district attorney and one of the main protagonists of the series. He is trying to protect the historical monument of Maramures. He is also in love with Lívia. At first, he is skeptical about the vampires' existence in the city until he witnesses a vampire attack at his house. *Rodrigo: Rodrigo is a human being who goes to Maramures after being hired to work by Bóris. Boris actually intended to use the body of Rodrigo to win Livia. Rodrigo and Livia start a relationship, but always needed to face Boris' plots. Later Rodrigo manages the power ring of ownership that leaves the user as powerful as Boris, but slowly transforms into a malignant character. At the end Rodrigo ends up also mutating into a vampire. Antagonists *Mina d'Montmartre The initial antagonist of the series, she was a French actress bitten by Bóris Vladescu, who mutated her into his vampiress wife. Unfortunately, she could not give him children so Bóris abandoned her. His next vampiress wife, Márie, died giving birth to his son Atilla Vladescu, later to be known as Zeca. She tried to kill the baby, but Bóris staked her and hid the baby. Mina tried to kill Zeca several times, but he was much stronger than her. In the middle of the series, Mina had a relationship with the human Rodrigo, and was impregnated by him telling everyone it was Bóris' child. When Mina gave birth to a baby girl, she disappeared for a long time, to return with her daughter Pandora, now a teenager. When Rodrigo is mortally wounded in the battle against Nosferatu's forces, she mutates him into a vampire and they both live together and forever. *Nosferatu The final antagonist appearing near the end is a master vampire much like Bóris. Despite his name, he is not associated with Count Orlok from the movie of the same name but he bears a strong resemblance to Count Dracula in his aged form in the initial chapters. He wants to destroy Bóris so he can take over his title and then raise an army of vampires to turn Maramures into a Necropolis. He destroys Galileo, and convinces several vampires to join his cause, igniting the final battle between good and evil. He orders the hotel the humans used as a stronghold to be burned and one by one the vampires loyal to him perish, until he confronts Bóris. In a sign of defiance, Bóris throws away his weapons and allows himself to be mortally wounded by Nosferatu. Then Zeca challenged Nosferatu. Empowered by the angel Ezequiel's holy power, Zeca banishes him permanently to Hell. *Martha Morta Augusto' sister-in-law was blinded by a car accident that killed her sister and left her nephew handicapped. She abandoned their house and lived with Bóris Vladescu, who mutated her into his vampiress wife. She becomes more mean to everyone including Bóris, who regrets biting her. Eventually she is cursed several times by him, zipping her mouth shut and taking away her fangs. She betrays Bóris and becomes Nosferatu's lover, joining his cause of destroying Bóris Vladescu, but she is destroyed in a confrontation with Lívia. Her name actually is Portuguese for \\"Dead Martha\\". *Lara Rodrigo's seductive ex- girlfriend, she comes to Maramures to reassure he belongs to her. Heartbroken, she meets the vampire Victor, and asks him to bite her. He obeys and mutates her into a vampiress. She is sexually attractive and seductive, but at the same time she is treacherous and predatory. She always switches sides to her own benefit, even becoming Count Dracula's personal concubine. Due to Victor's destruction, she becomes once again human. *Victor Victorio A vampire, he is Bóris' right-hand man. Despite his position, Victor is not loyal to Bóris and tries to overthrow him in secret. He mutates Lara into a vampiress and they become lovers, but she leaves him to be Count Dracula's lover and he in turn stalked Ciça, visiting her in her sleep, ravishing her and drinking her blood, which causes her to fade until she dies, rather than mutate into a vampiress. Victor sided with Nosferatu, in part as revenge against Bóris and in the final battle, he mortally wounds Godzilla and is destroyed by Bóris. Supporting humans *Galileo Van Burguer A clumsy, absent-minded and lousy vampire hunter. His ancestor tried to destroy Bóris and Mina d'Montmartre decades ago, but they frightened him to death. Galileo belongs to the Van Burguer family, a lineage of vampire slayers bent on destroying Bóris' house. His son Bartô is skeptical about their legacy and doesn't believe in vampires. Unfortunately, Bóris' ex-wife Mina d'Montmartre and her servant Amélie attack Bartô and mutate him into a vampire but still, Galileo spares his son out of affection. Galileo is incompetent when it comes to vampire-hunting. His attempts annoy Bóris and Mina because he always misses the stake in their heart and he has a poor aim when he fires silver bullets at them. Despite his incompetence, he proves to be capable of destroying (unintentionally) Count Dracula by staking him in the heart, however he was trying to destroy Victor Victorio at the time, not Dracula. Galileo is destroyed by Nosferatu, who incinerates him. His remains are kept inside an urn and after his death, he comes back as a ghost haunting Nosferatu and appearing to Zoroastra in visions. In the end, he joins Zoroastra's spirit in Heaven. His name is derived from Galileo Galilei, and his family name is a joke on the Belmont family from the popular video game series Castlevania, known for also fighting against evil. Supporting vampires *Pandora Mina and Rodrigo's hybrid daughter, she is dhampir for her father being human and her mother a vampiress, but she is described as always a vampiress. She is heard inside of her mother's womb, and only make a real appearance as a baby during labor only to disappear without a trace, along with Mina. She reappears, now as a beautiful and attractive teenage girl having aged at an accelerated rate until adolescence where she would hit immortality. She has a romantic relationship with Jackie, but he insisted on having a fraternal relationship with her and he is also attracted to a human girl. Unlike the other vampires, Pandora is very girly and cheerful, and not necessarily evil and cruel. The character Pandora was created when Cláudia Raia, the actress who played Mina, became pregnant at the time of the running series, and she had to take a license to have her baby, then the author Antônio Calmon had the idea of creating a relationship between Mina and Rodrigo which would result in Pandora. *Bart Van Burger Galileo's only son, he is a hardcore punk-like vampire, who was mutated by Mina in order to regain her beauty. This event crushed his father Galileo, who is a vampire hunter, but he lets his son live out of mercy. Bart is quite extroverted and a joking person, but not an evil vampire, as a matter of fact, Bart is exceptionally cowardly and fearful, and rarely engage in battle unless if he came to protect his father or his lover Amélie, but occasionally runs when he is alone or in danger. In the end of the series, he is reverted to a human due to Bóris' power sustaining his vampiric energy gone with his death. His fate is unknown as Bóris survived his destruction, and it is left unclear if he will remain human or return to being a vampire. *Amélie Mina's vampiress servant. She is quite sissy and devilish, speaking with an evil tone of voice. She is loyal to Mina and Bóris and had dated Bart Van Burger after his metamorphosis at the fangs of Mina. *Godzilla A robber who tried to assault Bóris when he came to Maramures, but he mutated Godzilla into a vampire upon calling Bóris a \\"good- blood\\" and Bóris replied before biting him, \\"I like that, 'good blood'\\". Godzilla becomes loyal to Bóris alone as his chauffeur, butler and personal security man. Normally, Bóris asked Godzilla how he must curse the other vampires, and Godzilla answered by committing very bizarre acts, such as taking away their fangs, blinding them like bats and petrifying them into talking stone statues. Godzilla never did something to anger Bóris, and always would obey his master. When Bóris is destroyed at the end of the series, Godzilla becomes human again, without the vampiric energy sustained by Bóris' power. His fate is unknown as he chose to live a more good life, but it is shown that Bóris survived his death, and it is unknown if he will mutate into a vampire again though it is likely that he will. *Dr. Petra van Petra A vampiress doctor mutated by Mina several centuries ago, she becomes her close friend and helps her when she discovers Mina is impregnated by a human. Petra becomes Godzilla's lover and even offered her own neck for him to give the Vampire Kiss, but he becomes allergic to her perfume. Petra helps Mina give birth to her child and keeps the secret about the child' real father. *Count Dracula The best-known vampire in the media, he once was Vlad Tepes (Dracula the Impaler) and he was so evil that he mutated into a vampire.

T4 source files are usually denoted by the file extension \\".tt\\". Overview T4 is used by developers as part of an application or tool framework to automate the creation of text files with a variety of parameters. These text files can ultimately be any text format, such as code (for example C#), XML, HTML or XAML. T4 uses a custom template format which can contain .NET code and string literals in it, this is parsed by the T4 command line tool into .NET code, compiled and executed. The output of the executed code is the text file generated by the template. T4 can also be completely run within the .NET applications via the use of the TextTransformation class which eliminates the need for the end user to have Visual Studio installed. T4 is used within Microsoft in ASP.NET MVC for the creation of the views and controllers, ADO.NET Entity Framework for entity generation, and ASP.NET Dynamic Data. It is also used outside of Microsoft in projects such as SubSonic. T4 templating is also supported in MonoDevelop and JetBrains Rider.https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/ Controls There are four types of controls handed by the T4 template transformation engine. {  style=\\"font-size: 0.9em; margin-left: 1em\\" - ! Name ! Syntax ! Description -  Directives  \`<#@ ... #>\`  Instructions for the transformation engine -  Standard control blocks  \`<# ... #>\`  Code to be executed (e.g. loops) -  Expression control blocks  \`<#= ... #>\`  Expressions evaluated and converted to a string -  Class feature control blocks  \`<#+ ... #>\`  Class and function definitions } Criticism Microsoft has often been criticized for the lack of tooling support for T4 within the Visual Studio IDE, and relies on third parties namely Tangible Engineering and Clarius Consulting, however later revisions have included better tooling support. History * 2005: Microsoft released the first version of T4 as an out of band release for Visual Studio 2005 * 2008: Microsoft includes it with Visual Studio 2008 * 2010: Microsoft includes it with Visual Studio 2010 which included significant new features to improve performance, usability for both template authors and tool builders and better integration into Visual Studio's DSL tools. * 2015: Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 can use C# version 6.0 features https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/code-generation- and-t4-text-templates * 2017: Open source version of engine released which supports .NET Core https://github.com/mono/t4 * 2019: JetBrains adds support for T4 in Rider https://github.com/jetbrains/fortea See also * Comparison of code generation tools * m4 (computer language) * Smarty References External links * GitHub - mono/t4: T4 text templating engine Category:.NET Framework Category:Free and open-source software Category:Microsoft free software Category:Microsoft Visual Studio Category:Software using the MIT license Category:Template engines Category:2005 software Category:2008 software Category:2010 software ","title":"Text Template Transformation Toolkit"},{"id":"20259812","text":"Reverend William Dawson (1704?–1752)Encyclopedia.com — Dawson, William.
