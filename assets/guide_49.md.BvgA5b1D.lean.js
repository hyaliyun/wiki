He served in the military throughout the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). ==Profession== Jeptha Atherton was born ante 1735, probably in Bermuda. Atherton settled in Northampton Courthouse , Northampton County, Province of North Carolina in 1762, near what is now the courthouse square in Jackson. He allowed the use of his land (which he had purchased from Barnaby Thomas, a brother in law of Willie Jones) for county court meetings, while establishing a large plantation, including horse breeding and stables, a grist mill, a tavern, and a store. He became a prominent local farmer, politician, and later, the Northampton Regiments’ first Major during the Revolutionary War period. By the time of the First Census of the Unites States, Atherton held a total of 35 slaves. This was a considerable number in the Upper South, where men were classified as planters if they held 20 or more slaves. His last will and testament makes a big emphasis on the redistribution of his slaves amongst his descendants following his death. ===Horse breeder=== Atherton was one of the first residents of Northampton County to take a strong interest in blooded horses. He established a large plantation at Northampton Courthouse, where he bred and raced horses, and was the owner of a nationally famous British born stallion, Janus, who was a grandson of the Godolphin Arabian. He purchased Janus from Mildred Willis between late 1771 and the start of 1772. Janus was quick and compact and is acknowledged as the foundation sire of the American Quarter Horse. He was a chestnut horse born in England in 1746 and imported to Virginia Colony by Mordecai Booth in 1752 , and resold, before moving to North Carolina. Janus, who measured in excess of 14 hands , would have looked different to the other horses at the time; compact yet large boned. His muscular back legs helped him run fast., Atherton enthusiasm for horse racing was shared by many of his neighbors. He ran Mud Colt and Big Filly (bred by Turner Bynum, his son-in-law), in quarter races against Willie Jones (statesman) two horses, Paoli and Trick’em, losing to both. He bred Caelus and Harlot, later owned by his son-in-law James Barnes. On March 18, 1773, Atherton placed an advertisement in the Virginia Gazette; in it he refers to Janus being in North Carolina.. The horse, Celer, foaled in 1774 was considered to be his “best son”. On March 20, 1775, Atherton placed one of many advertisements in the Virginia Gazette to put Janus out to stud. Atherton retained ownership of Janus until the horses death in 1780, aged 34, having passed his many qualities to all his foals, including the celebrated American Quarter Running Horse Spadille. On March 26th, 1782 Thomas Burke (North Carolina politician) wrote to him advising that the horse he dispatched was unfit for Military service and requested another. ==Chronology of his efforts during the Revolutionary War== Jeptha Atherton received his Commission as Major of the Northampton Regiment from Governor William Tryon on December 6, 1770 in New Bern. Atherton was a patriot who served from 1775 to 1783 in the North Carolina Militia. His name is listed as Jeptha Atherton or Eatherton in some of the militia service records. *September 9, 1775: The Northampton County Regiment was one of 35 existing North Carolina county militias to be authorized for organization on September 9, 1775, by the North Carolina Provincial Congress. Atherton was commissioned as a 1st Major under Colonel Allen Jones, who lead the regiment from 1775 and 1776). *February 27, 1776: Atherton led a small contingent of the Northampton County Regiment of Militia at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. *April 22, 1776: Commissioned as a Lt. Col. under Colonel William Eaton in the Northampton County Regiment of Militia. *March 3, 1779: Atherton was attached to Col. Thomas Eaton's Warren County Regiment of Militia during the Battle of Briar Creek, Georgia. *1780: Atherton was commissioned as a full Colonel and served as a second colonel alongside Colonel Howell Edmunds, in the Northampton County Regiment of Militia. When Col. Howell Edmunds resigned at the end of 1780, Atherton became the Commandant over the Northampton County Regiment of Militia, a position he retained until the end of the war. *August 11, 1780: Atherton led the Northampton County Regiment of Militia at the Battle of Little Lynches Creek, South Carolina and Battle of Camden, South Carolina on August 16, 1780. ==Political and civic career== Atherton was appointed as a Justice of the Peace in Beatie County in 1739. As the population increased, Northampton separated to form its own County, with Atherton retaining this civic position. ===House of Burgesses=== Atherton served in the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses in 1775 as the elected representative of the Northampton County., Atherton is mentioned on 10 occasions. ===Provincial Congress=== He was elected to represent Northampton County in the Second North Carolina Provincial Congress in New Bern, North Carolina, in April 1775. He was again elected to the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress in August 1775 in Hillsborough, the Fourth North Carolina Provincial Congress in Halifax in April 1776 and the Fifth North Carolina Provincial Congress of November 1776, which created the North Carolina State Constitution. He also represented Northampton County in the North Carolina House of Commons during 1777, but he was soon elected as Northampton County Clerk and he stepped down from the House of Commons. ==Death and legacy== Atherton died on January 19, 1787, in Northampton County, North Carolina. His will was proven in June of that year. A number of enslaved people were mentioned in his last will and testament. On July 2, 1798, the North-Carolina Journal of Halifax reported on page 4: “For lease - - Land and Plantation at Northampton Courthouse formerly belonging to Col. Jeptha Atherton upon which is a good dwelling house - - convenient outhouses - - also a grist mill. Besides - - immediately at the courthouse there is a house which is now used as a tavern and is from its location well calculated for that purpose. And - - a storehouse near it which is well situated for a country store.” Atherton St, Jackson, NC is named after him. == Personal Life == Atherton married Sarah Tynes on September 13th, 1760. Atherton married Mary Elizabeth “Betsie” Thorpe, the widow of Thomas Jarrett at St. Luke’s Parrish, Southampton, VA. Some sources state that they only had one daughter. His Last Will and Testament says otherwise. === Family === Once he moved to North Carolina, Atherton secured greater influence by marrying his daughters into influential families, such as the Dawson’s, Barnes, Alston and Bynum’s. It is unclear whether his daughter Penelope (Atherton) Brunson came with her father to North Carolina. Her son, Asabel Brunson Jr was killed during the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. His daughter by his marriage to Betsie; Elisabeth “Dorothy” Atherton (1764-1789), married John Dawson Jr, who represented Northampton in the North Carolina House of Commons (1780-1782) and then Halifax (1787-1798). His father John Dawson Srhttp://www.ncpedia.org/biography/dawson-john had moved from Virginia to Bertie County, North Carolina in 1732, and within 2 years was a representative in the General Assembly, and a later a member of the Governors Council. Highly influential on local matters he was appointed Colonel of the Northampton Regiment towards the end of the Spanish Alarm period which lasted 9 years (1739-1748). Their son Jesse Atherton Dawson became a wealthy planter Atherton’s granddaughter, Mary Patience Dawson married Archibald S. Dobbins, a Colonel in the Confederate Army. His other daughter, Temperance Atherton, married James Barnes. They had 2 children. Descendants include David Collin Barnes (1875-1959) who was elected to the N.C. House of Representatives and the N.C. State Senate. Frances Atherton (1770-1830), married Gideon Alston (1765-1831) Mary Atherton, who married Turner Bynum. One son: Jesse Atherton Bynum (May 23, 1797 – September 23, 1868) was a Congressional Representative from North Carolina; born in Halifax County, North Carolina, May 23, 1797; attended Princeton College in 1817 and 1818; studied law; was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Halifax, North Carolina; member of the house of commons of North Carolina in 1822, 1823, and 1826–1829; elected as a Jacksonian to the Twenty-second and Twenty-third Congresses and as a Democrat to the two succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1833 – March 3, 1841); moved to Alexandria, Louisiana, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits; died in Alexandria, La., September 23, 1868; interment in Rapides Cemetery, Pineville, Louisiana. His only son, Jessee Atherton, died without issue according to Atherton’s will which states: D.S.P. from the Latin word dēcessit sine prōle. == References == Category:1733 births Category:1787 deaths Category:18th- century American politicians Category:North Carolina militiamen in the American Revolution Category:Members of the North Carolina Provincial Congresses Category:Members of the North Carolina House of Burgesses ","title":"Jeptha Atherton"},{"id":"63909975","text":"Greylisting can refer to: *Greylisting (email), a method of defending e-mail users against spam *Greylisting (employment), a form of blacklisting for lesser offenses *Hollywood graylist, people who were on the Hollywood blacklist operated by the major studios, but could find work at minor film studios on Poverty Row ","title":"Greylisting"},{"id":"63909978","text":"The Nedlands Masters was a professional golf tournament in Australia, held at the Nedlands Golf Club in Nedlands, Perth, Western Australia.

Glycans highlighted in blue. Structure taken from PDB entry 6VXX Glycan- Protein interactions represent a class of biological intermolecular interactions that occur between free or protein-bound glycans and their cognate binding partners. Together with protein-protein interactions, they form a mechanistic basis for many essential cell processes, especially for cell-cell interactions and host-cell interactions. For instance, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, employs its extensively glycosylated spike (S) protein to bind to the ACE2 receptor, allowing it to enter host cells. The spike protein is a trimeric structure, with each subunit containing 22 N-glycosylation sites, making it an attractive target for vaccine search. Glycans, a generic name for monosaccharides and oligosaccharides, represent one of the major post-translational modification of proteins contributing to the enormous biological complexity of life. Indeed, three different hexoses could theoretically produce from 1056 to 27,648 unique trisaccharides in contrast to only 6 peptides or oligonucleotides formed from 3 amino acids or 3 nucleotides respectively. In contrast to template-driven protein biosynthesis, the \\"language\\" of glycosylation is still unknown, making glycobiology a hot topic of current research given their prevalence in living organisms. The study of glycan-protein interactions provides insight into the mechanisms of cell-signaling and allows to create better-diagnosing tools for many diseases, including cancer. Indeed, there are no known types of cancer that do not involve erratic patterns of protein glycosylation. == Thermodynamics of Binding == The binding of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) to glycans could be modeled with simple equilibrium. Denoting glycans as G and proteins as P: Protein (P) + Glycan (G) \\\\rightleftharpoons PG With an associated equilibrium constant of K_a = \\\\frac{[PG]}{[P][G]} Which is rearranged to give dissociation constant K_d following biochemical conventions: K_d = \\\\frac{[P][G]}{[PG]} Given that many GBPs exhibit multivalency, this model may be expanded to account for multiple equilibria: P + G \\\\rightleftharpoons PG PG + G \\\\rightleftharpoons PG_2 \\\\dots PG_{n-1} + G \\\\rightleftharpoons PG_n Denoting cumulative equilibrium of binding with i ligands as P + iG \\\\rightleftharpoons PG_i With corresponding equilibrium constant: \\\\beta_i = \\\\frac{[PG_i]}{[P][G]^i} And writing material balance for protein (c_P denotes the total concentration of protein): c_P = [P] + [PG] + \\\\dots + [PG_n] Expressing the terms through an equilibrium constant, a final result is found: c_P = [P](1 + \\\\beta_1[G] + \\\\dots + \\\\beta_n [G]^n The concentration of free protein is, thus: [P] = \\\\frac{c_P}{1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\\\beta_i[G]^i}} If n=1, i.e. there is only one carbohydrate receptor domain, the equation reduces to [P] = \\\\frac{c_P}{1 + \\\\beta_1 [G]} With increasing i the concentration of free protein decreases; hence, the apparent K_D decreases too. == Binding with aromatic rings == Figure 1. The schematic representation of CH-\\\\pi interactions The chemical intuition suggests that the glycan-binding sites may be enriched in polar amino acid residues that form non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, with polar carbohydrates. Indeed, a statistical analysis of carbohydrate-binding pockets shows that aspartic acid and asparagine residues are present twice as often as would be predicted by chance. Surprisingly, there is an even stronger preference for aromatic amino acids: tryptophan has a 9-fold increase in prevalence, tyrosine a 3-fold one, and histidine a 2-fold increase. It has been shown that the underlying force is the CH-\\\\pi interaction between the aromatic \\\\pi system and the C-H in carbohydrate as shown in Figure 1. The CH-\\\\pi interaction is identified if the \\\\theta \\\\leqslant 40°, the CH-\\\\pi distance (distance from C to X) is less than 4.5Å. === Effects of stereochemistry === The definition of alpha and beta faces for glucose and galactose. The stereochemical difference for two hexoses is highlighted in red. This CH-\\\\pi interaction strongly depends on the stereochemistry of the carbohydrate molecule. For example, consider the top (\\\\beta) and bottom (\\\\alpha) faces of \\\\beta-D-Glucose and \\\\beta-D-Galactose. It has been shown that a single change in the stereochemistry at C4 carbon shifts preference for aromatic residues from \\\\beta side (2.7 fold preference for glucose) to the \\\\alpha side (14 fold preference for galactose). === Effects of electronics === The comparison of electrostatic surface potentials (ESPs) of aromatic rings in tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine suggests that electronic effects also play a role in the binding to glycans (see Figure 2). After normalizing the electron densities for surface area, the tryptophan still remains the most electron rich acceptor of CH-\\\\pi interactions, suggesting a possible reason for its 9-fold prevalence in carbohydrate binding pockets. Overall, the electrostatic potential maps follow the prevalence trend of Trp >> Tyr > (Phe) > His. Figure 2. Electrostatic Surface Potentials (ESPs) of aromatic amino acids. Electron rich areas are depicted with red, while electron poor areas are depicted with blue. == Carbohydrate-binding partners == There are many proteins capable of binding to glycans, including lectins, antibodies, microbial adhesins, viral agglutinins, etc. === Lectins === Lectins is a generic name for proteins with carbohydrate-recognizing domains (CRD). Although it became almost synonymous with glycan-binding proteins, it does not include antibodies which also belong to the class. Lectins found in plants and fungi cells have been extensively used in research as a tool to detect, purify, and analyze glycans. However, useful lectins usually have sub- optimal specificities. For instance, Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1), a plant-extracted lectin capable of binding to human blood type O antigen, can also bind to unrelated glycans such as 2'-fucosyllactose, GalNAcα1-4(Fucα1-2)Galβ1-4GlcNAc, and Lewis-Y antigen. === Antibodies === Although antibodies exhibit nanomolar affinities toward protein antigens, the specificity against glycans is very limited. In fact, available antibodies may bind only <4% of the 7000 mammalian glycan antigens; moreover, most of those antibodies have low affinity and exhibit cross-reactivity. === Lambodies === In contrast with jawed vertebrates whose immunity is based on variable, diverse, and joining gene segments (VDJs) of immunoglobulins, the jawless invertebrates, such as lamprey and hagfish, create a receptor diversity by somatic DNA rearrangement of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules that are incorporate in *vlr* genes (variable leukocyte receptors). Those LRR form 3D structures resembling curved solenoids that selectively bind specific glycans. A study from University of Maryland has shown that lamprey antibodies (lambodies) could selectively bind to tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (such as Tn and TF\\\\alpha) at nanomolar affinities. The T-nouvelle antigen (Tn) and TF\\\\alpha are present in proteins in as much as 90% of different cancer cells after post-translational modification, whereas in healthy cells those antigens are much more complex. A selection of lambodies that could bind to aGPA, a human erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein that is covered with 16 TF\\\\alpha moieties, through magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) has yielded a leucine-rich lambody VLRB.aGPA.23. This lambody selectively stained (over healthy samples) cells from 14 different types of adenocarcinomas: bladder, esophagus, ovary, tongue, cheek, cervix, liver, nose, nasopharynx, greater omentum, colon, breast, larynx, and lung. Moreover, patients whose tissues stained positive with VLRB.aGPA.23 had a significantly smaller survival rate. A close look at the crystal structure of VLRB.aGPA.23 reveals a tryptophan residue at position 187 right over the carbohydrate binding pocket. Crystal Structure of VLRB.aGPA.23 created from PDB Entry 4K79 === Multivalency in structure === Cartoon depiction of common oligomeric structures of lectins Many glycan binding proteins (GBPs) are oligomeric and typically contain multiple sites for glycan binding (also called carbohydrate-recognition domains). The ability to form multivalent protein-ligand interactions significantly enhances the strength of binding: while K_D values for individual CRD-glycan interactions may be in the mM range, the overall affinity of GBP towards glycans may reach nanomolar or even picomolar ranges. The overall strength of interactions is described as avidity K_D (in contrast with an affinity K_D which describes single equilibrium). Sometimes the avidity is also called an apparent K_D to emphasize the non-equilibrium nature of the interaction. Common oligomerization structures of lectins are shown below. For example, galectins are usually observed as dimers, while intelectins form trimers and pentraxins assemble into pentamers. Larger structures, like hexameric Reg proteins, may assemble into membrane penetrating pores. Collectins may form even more bizarre complexes: bouquets of trimers or even cruciform-like structures (e.g. in SP-D). == Current Research == Given the importance of glycan-protein interactions, there is an ongoing research dedicated to the a) creation of new tools to detect glycan-protein interactions and b) using those tools to decipher the so-called sugar code. === Glycan Arrays === One of the most widely used tools for probing glycan-protein interactions is glycan arrays. A glycan array usually is an NHS- or epoxy-activated glass slides on which various glycans were printed using robotic printing. These commercially available arrays may contain up to 600 different glycans, specificity of which has been extensively studied. Glycan-protein interactions may be detected by testing proteins of interest (or libraries of those) that bear fluorescent tags. The structure of the glycan-binding protein may be deciphered by several analytical methods based on mass-spectrometry, including MALDI-MS, LC-MS, tandem MS-MS, and/or 2D NMR. === Bioinformatics driven research === Computational methods have been applied to search for parameters (e.g. residue propensity, hydrophobicity, planarity) that could distinguish glycan-binding proteins from other surface patches. For example, a model trained on 19 non- homologous carbohydrate binding structures was able to predict carbohydrate- binding domains (CRDs) with an accuracy of 65% for non-enzymatic structures and 87% for enzymatic ones. Further studies have employed calculations of Van der Waals energies of protein-probe interactions and amino acid propensities to identify CRDs with 98% specificity at 73% sensitivity. More recent methods can predict CRDs even from protein sequences, by comparing the sequence with those for which structures are already known. === Sugar code === In contrast with protein studies, where a primary protein structure is unambiguously defined by the sequence of nucleotides (the genetic code), the glycobiology still cannot explain how a certain \\"message\\" is encoded using carbohydrates or how it is \\"read\\" and \\"translated\\" by other biological entities. An interdisciplinary effort, combining chemistry, biology, and biochemistry, studies glycan-protein interactions to see how different sequences of carbohydrates initiate different cellular responses. == See also == * Protein- protein interactions * Glycobiology == References == Category:Glycoproteins Category:Monosaccharides Category:Oligosaccharides Category:Glycobiology Category:Protein–protein interaction assays ","title":"Glycan-protein interactions"},{"id":"63910054","text":"The 1989–90 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team represented Villanova University in the 1989–90 season.

Upon the arrival of the pandemic in the United States, almost all television entertainment production ceased, besides those capable of being continued remotely and/or with reduced personnel (including new series or special episodes of existing series that were specifically designed around remote/at-home production, or otherwise set during the pandemic). By June, some productions began to resume, and begun to employ social distancing guidelines, quarantine measures, and other safety protocols in other to appeal to relevant health orders and protocols agreed upon by the television industry (including The pandemic is the most impactful shutdown on the American television industry since the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, which disrupted nearly all scripted and daily talk show television production. == Scripted programming == === Suspension of production === The production of many scripted television series have been affected by the pandemic. On March 10, Fox announced that a production member of the upcoming show NeXt has tested positive for the coronavirus. Production of the series was completed one week before the announcement. Furthermore, the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier suspended its international production in Prague, where a week of filming was set aside. Filming continued in Atlanta until filming statewide was suspended two weeks later. On March 12, Universal Television delayed shooting for the shows Russian Doll, Rutherford Falls, and Little America. A few hours later, NBCUniversal announced that 35 additional shows would suspend production, including unscripted shows. As such, programs such as the three series of the Chicago franchise as well as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, FBI, New Amsterdam and Superstore had their production suspended; Superstore had to modify its season finale with making its 21st episode in the fifth season the last one produced before the shutdown, short of a 22-episode order. Furthermore, it was revealed that production of Carnival Row had been suspended. Carnival Row was filming in Prague at the time of the production shutdown. The same day, Netflix announced that production on the final season of Grace and Frankie would be suspended as a number of the actors are at high risk for the virus due to their age. Also on March 12, ViacomCBS announced that One Day at a Time would continue production without a studio audience but on March 20, the executive producers stated that production has suspended. Apple suspended production of The Morning Show and Foundation as a precautionary measure. The following day, Apple suspended production on all upcoming shows. On March 13, CBS Television Studios announced several series would suspend production including all series that are part of the NCIS franchise, Bull, Dynasty, Nancy Drew, Charmed and The Good Fight. Most of the multi-camera sitcoms produced by CBS Television Studios had already completed production; The Neighborhood was to film its season finale without a studio audience, but ultimately chose to suspend production the next day, scrapping the planned season finale episode. The same day, AMC suspended production of Fear the Walking Dead and The Walking Dead. Also on March 13, Warner Bros. had suspended production on multiple series including All Rise, Batwoman, Bob Hearts Abishola, Euphoria, The Flash, God Friended Me, Riverdale, Supergirl, Supernatural, and Young Sheldon. Lastly, Netflix announced that production on all its films and series in the United States and Canada would be suspended. Production in other countries would be assessed on a case-by-case basis. With the show's cancellation by CBS, the last filmed episode of God Friended Me was retooled into a series finale, \\"The Mountain\\", by incorporating reusable stock footage from past episodes, and culminating with location footage that had originally been filmed for its pilot episode, but saved for potential use within a season or series finale. 20th Television and ABC Studios suspended production on multiple series, including Empire (prematurely ending its final season), Pose, Queen of the South, American Housewife, as well as Grey's Anatomy and Genius. On March 14, Sony Pictures Television announced that it would suspend production on several series including The Blacklist and The Goldbergs. The Blacklist would utilize animated sequences inspired by graphic novels in order to complete the partially-filmed episode as a premature season finale. On March 15, MGM Television revealed that it had suspended production of The Handmaid's Tale. Filmed episodes may air sometime in 2021.‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Also Suspends Production Over Coronavirus Another Hulu series, The Orville, also suspended production. Last Man Standing originally planned to film its season finale without a studio audience before ultimately suspending production. Both The Orville and Last Man Standing were among the last television series to suspend production. NBC pulled the April 7 episode of its medical drama New Amsterdam for sensitivity reasons (as it dealt with a flu pandemic affecting New York City, a real-life epicenter of the outbreak). The big three networks' soap operas also suspended production, with CBS's The Bold and the Beautiful and The Young and the Restless, and ABC's General Hospital eventually running out of first-run episodes by late-April and late-May respectively (leading to all three shows beginning to air themed reruns of classic episodes in the interim). Strategies were employed to ration remaining episodes, including not airing first-run episodes on Fridays (in favor of reruns), while General Hospital also employed increased use of flashback scenes from recent storylines to draw out its remaining inventory of episodes. By contrast, as episodes of NBC's Days of Our Lives are produced roughly eight months in advance of their broadcast, the program had a much larger backlog of first-run episodes available. Viewership of U.S. soap operas saw gains as mitigation measures were applied nationwide in late-March, with both The Bold and the Beautiful and General Hospital seeing their best ratings since March 2018, while Days of our Lives and The Young and the Restless saw their best ratings since 2019. === Topical programming === The children's program Sesame Street produced two half-hour specials. The first — Sesame Street: Elmo's Playdate — which dealt with the pandemic and socializing with others remotely. It premiered on April 14, airing in simulcast across multiple WarnerMedia networks (including HBO, which has served as the current first-run broadcaster of the series since 2016) and the PBS Kids channel. The special was underwritten by WarnerMedia parent company AT&T;, airing commercial-free. Apple TV+ also launched a spin-off of Fraggle Rock, Fraggle Rock: Rock On!, filmed entirely using iPhone smartphones from the performers' homes. Nickelodeon ordered two new shows, tentatively titled Group Chat: The Show and Game Face. The channel also ordered an extra episode of Danger Force, over web streaming. It also commissioned podcasts based on The Loud House, Blue's Clues & You!, The Casagrandes, and Are You Afraid of The Dark?, as well as one about its animation studio. YouTube commissioned a mystery series from Sinking Ship Entertainment, Locked Down, for its YouTube Originals brand. On April 30, NBC aired a one-off, remotely-produced reunion episode of its sitcom Parks and Recreation, \\"A Parks and Recreation Special\\", in support of Feeding America. In May, CBS legal drama All Rise aired a topical episode, \\"Dancing at Los Angeles\\", as a replacement season finale. It was filmed from its actors' homes using videoconferencing, depicting the in-universe version of the Los Angeles Superior Court conducting its first virtual bench trial due to the pandemic. On May 22, Apple TV+'s Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet released a special episode filmed using iPhone smartphones, showing an in-universe impact of the pandemic on its characters. Live-action sitcom One Day at a Time created an animated, presidential election-themed episode, \\"The Politics Episode\\", which premiered on June 16. On July 16, NBC broadcast a one-off reunion episode of its sitcom 30 Rock; the episode was co-produced by NBCUniversal's creative services department and intended to serve as its upfronts presentation in lieu of a physical event — incorporating product placement and promotions for upcoming series across NBCUniversal properties (including, in particular, its new Peacock streaming service), and being screened in a remote presentation to advertising partners and the media earlier in the day. Due to its promotional nature, many NBC affiliates declined to broadcast the special. On August 17, PBS children's series Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood premiered \\"Won't You Sing along With Me?\\", an episode dealing with the pandemic. It is also producing related episodes revolving around themes such as doctors, separation anxiety, changes at school and safety. Comedy Central animated series South Park broadcast a standalone, one-hour special, \\"The Pandemic Special\\", on September 30, satirizing the pandemic and political unrest in the United States. Several networks have ordered scripted series set during the pandemic, including Joanna Johnson's Love in the Time of Corona for Freeform, Jenji Kohan's anthology Social Distance for Netflix, Martin Gero and Brendan Gall's Connecting for NBC (which was ordered straight-to-series), and a remote work- themed workplace comedy being developed by Ben Silverman and Paul Lieberstein of The Office. === Resumption of modified production === In late-April 2020, Tyler Perry told Deadline Hollywood that he planned to resume production of programming at his Atlanta-based Tyler Perry Studios by June, with plans to test cast and crew members on-site before they travel, sequester them on the Fort McPherson site's housing, barracks, and other purpose-built structures for the duration of production (which Perry estimates typically takes two-and- a-half weeks for a full season), quarantine them until the results of a second test are received, and test them again at least every four days afterward. Perry stated that he wrote his scripts with a smaller amount of personnel and cast members in mind. On April 30, industry group Film Florida released a comprehensive series of recommendations and safety protocols for film and television production, ranging from regular health screenings to limits to the amount of on-site staff, not sharing microphones and other equipment, using clear barriers between actors when marking and establishing shots, and other considerations regarding use of personal protective equipment by crew members. The group noted that studios should \\"anticipate inefficiencies due to new procedures\\", and that the guidelines should be used in conjunction with industry guidelines once established. On May 22, Georgia (which, primarily via the Atlanta area, has become a major southern hub for television and film production) became the first state to formally release such guidelines, drawing from guidance from local officials and studios, as well as the Film Florida guidelines. On June 5, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that film and television production in California could resume beginning June 12, subject to approval by county public health officers following a review of local conditions. The California Department of Public Health stated that workers \\"should abide by safety protocols agreed by labor and management, which may be further enhanced by county public health officers.\\" Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer initially stated that she would not immediately allow film and television production due to an increase in recent hospitalizations, but later announced on June 10 that they would be covered under the next phase of local health orders taking effect June 12. That day, the Directors Guild of America, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and SAG-AFTRA published \\"The Safe Way Forward\\", which details health and safety protocols agreed upon for union film and television productions. This includes regular testing of cast and crew members, closed sets, access zones, shooting limited to ten hours, and all productions requiring an on-set health safety supervisor. On June 18, Deadline reported that NBCUniversal had begun an incremented return to work at its facilities, including exercises of new protocols. NBCUniversal also performed in-house production of materials such as face masks and hand sanitizer via its Facilities and Administration department for use at other sites outside of California. On June 17 at Television City, The Bold and the Beautiful became one of the first U.S. scripted television series to resume on-set tapings, although production subsequently went on a one-week hiatus in order to accommodate modifications to its protocols to handle the larger number of tests needed. Scenes are being filmed in such a way as to allow physical distancing on-set, and other family members of cast members may be used as stand-ins during scenes that require intimacy. On June 23, it was reported that the resumption had been delayed by one day, as the studio needed to switch testing providers because one provided by Television City had produced too many false positives The Bold and the Beautiful began airing first-run episodes on July 20. General Hospital resumed production on July 22, with first-run episodes resuming on August 3. Fellow CBS soap The Young and the Restless began airing new episodes on August 10, and Days of our Lives planned to resume production by September. On July 25, Tyler Perry's BET series Sistas became one of the first U.S. scripted primetime series to complete a full season of filming under COVID-19-related safety protocols. Perry reported that there were four positive cases among extras and crew who arrived, and that the start of production had faced a delay due to slower turnarounds for testing admit a nationwide spike. While Perry hoped a vaccine would soon be available, he explained that \\"we are set up for the long haul, we could be here for a year and a half, two years, five years if we needed to.\\" The second season of fellow Tyler Perry production The Oval was completed on August 14. Resumption of The Good Doctor in Vancouver was briefly disrupted by conflicts with local labor unions over the large amount of testing being required by Sony Pictures Television, citing Canadian requirements that already mandate 14 days self-isolation upon entering the country, and the relatively lower rate of transmission in the province of British Columbia at the time. Privacy issues with plans to contract private labs for testing was also cited as a factor. The impasse was resolved in mid-August. == Unscripted programming == === Suspension of production === In mid-March, Sony Pictures suspended production of its game shows Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! (Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek has a weakened immune system due to his pancreatic cancer). Other postponed productions included American Ninja Warrior, Card Sharks, The Price Is Right and The Real Housewives of New Jersey. ABC reality series The Bachelorette delayed filming for its sixteenth season, which was set to premiere on May 18. A retrospective spin-off, The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons – Ever!, premiered on June 8, featuring highlights and behind-the-scenes footage of past seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. On April 29, Variety reported that Bachelor spin-off series Bachelor in Paradise had postponed its seventh season to 2021, and that ABC was pursuing filming The Bachelorette over the summer for a fall premiere. ABC had also planned to produce The Bachelor Summer Games, but shelved the series shortly after the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics to July 2021 (which the series was intended to counterprogram, just as its counterpart The Bachelor Winter Games had for the 2018 Winter Olympics). Prometheus Entertainment claimed that its productions of the History programs Ancient Aliens, The Curse of Oak Island, and The UnXplained were exempt from Los Angeles' stay-at-home order, which declared \\"front line news reporters, studio, and technicians for newsgathering and reporting\\" to be \\"essential critical infrastructure workers\\". President Kevin Burns, according to The Hollywood Reporter, told employees they needed to \\"get over it\\" and were \\"hysterical\\"; the company required staff to attend work through at least March 20. CBS reality series The Amazing Race stopped production on its thirty-third season in late February after filming the season's first three episodes (which were mostly filmed in the United Kingdom), and the preceding thirty-second season was set to premiere on May 20 (although that season was filmed in late 2018) but was pushed back to a fall premiere. Production of the 41st and 42nd seasons of Survivor, which were due to film in Fiji at the end of respective months of March and May, postponed its production until spring 2021 due to the coronavirus threat in the country and closing the country's borders to non- citizens. While the program's producers aimed to potentially begin production of season 41 in May for a fall premiere, it did not come to fruition, and the next season of S.W.A.T. (originally scheduled for a midseason premiere) was moved up to take its place. === Modified production === Fremantle initially announced that the fifteenth season of America's Got Talent (NBC), and Season 22 of Family Feud (syndicated), would film without an audience. Starting the week of March 10, CBS began displaying disclaimers in the end credits for The Price Is Right during episodes recorded from late-2019 into 2020, disclosing that producers will arrange substitute prizes for contestants who won trips as prizes for locales impacted by the pandemic. ABC's primetime reboot of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire quickly filmed over eight episodes' worth of material during the weekend of March 14 (wrapping production one day sooner than scheduled). The program filmed with no studio audience beyond staff present on-set, resulting in the replacement of its \\"Ask the Audience\\" lifeline with \\"Ask the Host\\". The program's new host Jimmy Kimmel credited his early career in radio in helping adapt to the environment. A second run of episodes was scheduled for a fall premiere, featuring a mixture of celebrity contestants and frontline workers. After filming without an audience for the remainder of its audition rounds, the 15th season of America's Got Talent suspended production on March 14; filming of the auditions was originally scheduled to conclude on March 20. To help attract additional contestants, NBC announced on April 1 that it would open a new round of online auditions. By April 27, production staff decided that the season would premiere on May 26 as planned. The show ultimately resumed production in June with a streamlined version of its \\"Judge Cuts\\" round, in an outdoor stage setting in Simi Valley, California with enhanced safety protocols and remote performances. The live quarter-finals (which, due to the revised Judge Cuts format, also had a larger field with four heats rather than three as in past seasons) shifted to Universal Studios Hollywood, with a mix of pre-recorded remote performances, and in-person performances emanating from various locations around the park and the Universal Studios Lot. The 18th season of American Idol (ABC) shifted to an at-home format beginning with its Top 20 round on April 26, with its contestants and judging panel conducting the program from their residences. The 18th season of The Voice (NBC) followed suit for the final three weeks of the season. The 19th season of American Idol reworked its preliminary auditions to use a remote format rather than a nationwide tour, and is limiting filming for the audition rounds to locations in California (with auditionees being flown in from outside of the region). The third season of The Masked Singer (Fox) already completed filming before pandemic-related restrictions took effect. Acknowledgements to the pandemic were added in post- production of the final episodes, such as dialogue by Night Angel referencing the panic buying of toilet paper. The penultimate \\"Road to the Finals\\" episode also included a special performance of \\"What the World Needs Now Is Love\\" dedicated to first responders, featuring season 3 contestant Dionne Warwick and the remaining three finalists. The performance was filmed after filming wrapped. Post-production was performed remotely. After a pre-scheduled hiatus, Live PD (A&E;) returned on April 15 with a series of pandemic-themed episodes under the title Live PD: Special Edition. These episodes deviated from the program's usual format (which follows patrols by police officers in real time) by covering responses to COVID-19 by first responders, hospitals, and other officials. On June 10, after having been suspended on June 6 following protests over the police killing of George Floyd, the program was cancelled by A&E; and its producers. The live finale of Survivors 40th season (Winners at War) aired as scheduled on CBS, but it was conducted in a remote format. The second season of Love Island (CBS) was set to premiere on May 21, but production (which had been scheduled to occur in Fiji) was suspended indefinitely. On August 5, CBS announced that Love Island would premiere on August 24, and would be set at The Cromwell casino hotel in Las Vegas. ABC's Shark Tank also elected to film its upcoming season in a larger \\"bubble\\" setting in the Las Vegas area, rather than Los Angeles. After being delayed from its usual June premiere, the 22nd season of Big Brother (CBS) — Big Brother All-Stars — premiered on August 5. The format already takes place in an isolated living environment, but general precautions were taken by production staff (including use of masks and being restricted to specific areas), contestants were tested and quarantined prior to entering the Big Brother house, and are being tested weekly. Live shows were held without a studio audience. New and returning game shows also adopted similar changes, including remote auditions, reduction of on-site staff, no studio audiences, and set modifications for physical distancing or other factors (with Wheel of Fortune introducing handheld, cap-like grips, dubbed \\"the white thing\\" by host Pat Sajak, to grab the pegs of the eponymous wheel without making direct contact with them). Fellow syndicated game show 25 Words or Less planned to have host Meredith Vieira present the program remotely from her home in New York City, but still have contestants on-set in Los Angeles. CBS's The Price is Right resumed production in October for its 49th season, with set modifications to cover the audience area, and accommodations being made for all of its current games to comply with health and safety protocols. CBS later announced that both Price and sister show Let's Make a Deal would return with primetime specials on October 27 (ahead of their season premieres in daytime on November 16), with both featuring essential workers as contestants. Fox resumed production of its new music game show I Can See Your Voice in August 2020, after production was suspended with one episode completed. The second episode and further were taped with only essential personnel and no audience. The fourth season of The Masked Singer commenced production a few weeks later. Among noted production changes were extensions of protocols already used to protect the identities of the performers, a re-location from Television City to Red Studios Hollywood in order to have a larger \\"bubble\\", increased use of \\"virtual reality\\" effects on-stage, and the use of \\"quarantining and various camera tricks\\" to preserve the visible presence of an audience (including use of stock footage of audiences from past episodes). The format of the competition was adjusted to reduce the number of times each contestant needed to perform, and live-action \\"clue packages\\" were largely substituted for animated shorts to reduce the amount of filming needed. Executive producer Craig Plestis noted that the production was also able to leverage panelist Ken Jeong's experience as a physician, and as host and co-executive producer of I Can See Your Voice, for input on their protocols. === Topical programming === TLC premiered a spin-off of 90 Day Fiancé, 90 Day Fiancé: Self-Quarantined, on April 20, following the impact of the pandemic on series alumni. The series uses self-recorded video and videoconferencing. The network also announced Find Love Live, an interactive dating game show conducted via videoconferencing, as a three-week event series premiering on May 10. In June 2020, TLC renewed Find Love Live for additional episodes beginning June 22. Fox premiered Celebrity Watch Party—a 10-episode U.S. adaptation of the British series Gogglebox, on May 7. On May 11, Food Network premiered a pandemic-themed cooking show, Amy Schumer Learns to Cook, starring comedian Amy Schumer and her husband Chris Fischer. On May 29, CBS aired the Jerry O'Connell and Rebecca Romijn-hosted special Haircut Night in America, which focused on providing advice for DIY hairstyling. On July 13, E! premiered Celebrity Call Center, a series featuring celebrities engaging in remote conversations with members of the general public. == Talk shows and variety programs == On March 10 and 11, a number of talk shows announced they would begin filming without a studio audience, including both daytime (such as Walt Disney Television's Live with Kelly and Ryan, Strahan, Sara & Keke, The View). and late night talk shows. Beginning March 12, a number of talk showsincluding those which had before planned to tape without an audienceannounced they would suspend production entirely. Both The Late Show and The Tonight Show already had hiatuses scheduled in late-March. The View continued production, but panelist Joy Behar, and later Whoopi Goldberg, would begin appearing remotely due to health concerns, and the show modified its set for social distancing on March 17, replacing the panel's table with what Goldberg described as a \\"big- ass desk\\". On March 12, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (CBS), The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (NBC), and Jimmy Kimmel Live! (ABC, with guest host Pete Buttigieg) all aired one final, studio-based episode with no audience, while Late Night with Seth Meyers (NBC) shelved its originally-planned episode after its scheduled guests declined to attend. Meyers still filmed that night's \\"A Closer Look\\" segment as a web exclusive. Last Week Tonight (HBO) filmed one more episode from an alternate, undisclosed location (due to the closure of the CBS Broadcast Center, its usual studio, for disinfection), with host John Oliver announcing that the show would go on hiatus. === Migration to remote formats === In the wake of the suspensions, late-night hosts such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, and Seth Meyers began to produce topical videos for YouTube from their homes or other locations, with a focus on monologues and celebrity interviews performed via videoconferencing (while Kimmel also experimented with an in-person interview of Bill Burr by doing it from his car, taping an iPad to his side window to use as a camera). While primarily distributed on digital platforms such as YouTube, from March 16 to 18, CBS aired Colbert's segments on television to augment reruns of The Late Show (replacing the existing opening act of the respective episode; the dates had originally been scheduled for original episodes before a regularly- scheduled hiatus for the cancelled NCAA basketball tournament), while NBC began to similarly air Fallon's segments on March 18. The following week, NBC announced that it would continue on with and expand Fallon's \\"At Home Edition\\" format (interspersing new segments with highlights from past episodes), while several other news satire and talk shows, including The Daily Show (Comedy Central; billed as The Daily Social Distancing Show), Full Frontal with Samantha Bee (TBS), Last Week Tonight, and fellow HBO series Real Time with Bill Maher, announced that they would also return to air that week with episodes filmed from their hosts' homes. The Late Show announced on March 25 that it would return in a similar format on March 30 (billed as A Late Show with Stephen Colbert), while Jimmy Kimmel Live! announced a similar move on March 27making it the last of the big three networks' late-night shows to make such a transition. Fellow Comedy Central late-night program Lights Out with David Spade was suspended, and later cancelled by the network due to low ratings (after which The Daily Show expanded to 45 minutes beginning April 27, 2020). A number of daytime talk shows adopted a similar format, including The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The View, and The Talk. After a primetime special on March 30, The Late Late Show with James Corden returned to air with a similar format on April 13, with host James Corden presenting the program from his garage. NBC's late-night sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live suspended production on March 16, before returning with its own \\"at-home\\" episode on April 11, with sketches and music performances recorded or produced remotely from its cast members' and musicians' homes, and hosted by actor and COVID-19 patient Tom Hanks. After becoming the second-highest-rated episode of the season, NBC announced that a second episode with a similar format would air on April 25. An At Home season finale aired on May 9, hosted by Kristen Wiig. The annual PBS Independence Day special A Capitol Fourth cancelled its live concert in favor of recorded segments (including highlights of past editions in honor of the program's 40th anniversary, and tributes to first responders and African Americans), although the live fireworks on Capitol Hill would still go on and be televised. The Macy's 4th of July Fireworks Spectacular special on NBC similarly relied on recorded performances from various locations (including the Grand Ole Opry and the Prairie Sun Recording Studios), and the fireworks themselves were launched from locations in each New York City borough on multiple nights (with each night's location only revealed shortly prior to avoid prolonged gatherings), which were then compiled for broadcast. === Return to studio-based production === On July 6, 2020, after having used an at-home format, TBS's Conan became the U.S. late- night show to begin airing episodes from outside of their host's home, with host Conan O'Brien presenting the program from the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles with limited on-site staff. The program will continue to use remote interviews and be filmed without a studio audience (besides assistant Sona Movsesian). On July 13, The Tonight Show became the first U.S. late-night talk show to return to tapings at their normal facility (although at NBC Studios' Studio 6A with a new set rather than Studio 6B, where the show usually originates), with limited on-site crew (including his house band The Roots) and no in-studio audience or interviews. The program hosted its first in- studio music performance from 6A on August 11, with Trey Anastasio performing a song from his Lonely Trip album with The Roots. On August 6, 2020, CBS announced that its late-night shows would return to studio tapings with no audience on August 10; The Late Show returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater building but not the auditorium proper, using a smaller, secondary set modeled upon Colbert's personal office at the building, while The Late Late Show returned to a reconfigured version of its normal studio (with its sofa replaced by a single armchair for Corden, and audience seats removed). On September 14, Corden temporarily hosted from home, after being required to self-isolate due to a possible COVID-19 exposure outside of the studio. The rest of the program's staff remained in-studio, with Corden appearing on-stage via a monitor atop his desk. Jimmy Kimmel Live! resumed production at the Hollywood Masonic Temple when Kimmel returned from his summer break (covered by hiatuses and guest hosts) on September 21. === New programming ===  New variety programming  Various specials featuring musicians performing from their homes emerged, including Fox's iHeart Living Room Concert for America (which aired in place of the now-cancelled 2020 iHeartRadio Music Awards, and was simulcast by iHeartMedia radio stations and Fox Corporation cable channels), a CBS special featuring Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, ACM Presents: Our Country (a similar multi-artist program aired in place of the postponed ACM Awards, also on CBS), The Disney Family Singalong (an ABC special on April 16, which featured karaoke performances of songs from Disney works with celebrity guests), One World: Together at Home (which aired on April 18 as a multi-network simulcast across ABC, CBS, NBC, and various other cable networks and streaming services), Saturday Night Seder (streamed live of April 11), and Saving Our Selves (aired by BET on April 22, with a particular focus on the pandemic's impact on African-American communities), On May 16, the major networks and various other outlets simulcast Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020, a national special honoring graduating students.  New talk programming  AMC premiered a new weekly talk show on April 17, Friday Night In with The Morgans, hosted by Jeffrey Dean Morgan (of AMC series The Walking Dead) and his wife Hilarie Burton from their farm in New York, featuring remote interviews and other segments dealing with the pandemic. On May 4, AMC ordered additional episodes of the series. == Impact on scheduling == Upon the start of COVID-19-related restrictions, broadcasters were forced to rely on their remaining inventory of completed programs that had not yet aired, and the remaining completed episodes of series whose production was interrupted. Due to factors such as the need to ration series that have already completed production, some programs have faced scheduling changes (such as replacing double-runs of new episodes with single episodes), delays of their scheduled premieres, or dividing seasons of programs with natural hiatuses (with the remaining episodes airing at a later date once production resumes). It was reported in April 2020 that the major broadcast networks had begun to develop contingency plans in case of extended disruptions (especially if they were to impact fall series for the 2020–21 television season), including the possibility of filling schedules with series from co-owned cable networks and streaming services, or importing programs new to American audiences from other countries such as Canada. === Impact on the 2020–21 network television season === Most fall television premieres occur from mid-to-late September through October. Due to production delays, the Big Three networks initially targeted premieres for their scripted series within the year, with no specific dates set. With the steady resumption of production, the networks began to set premiere dates from late-October through mid-November. Some of NBC's fall programming, as well as all of Fox and The CW's fall scripted programming, was deferred to midseason premieres in 2021. Due to their quicker turnaround time in comparison to scripted series, non- scripted programs (including game shows and reality shows) were expedited by networks to fill gaps in their lineups, alongside the aforementioned contingencies.  ABC  Premiere dates were announced for ABC's lineup on September 17, with October premieres for reality series such as The Bachelorette, Dancing with the Stars, and Shark Tank, and game shows (including held over episodes from its Sunday-night block of Celebrity Family Feud, Press Your Luck, and Match Game on Thursday nights, a revival of Supermarket Sweep, and new episodes of Card Sharks and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire). ABC's sitcoms would largely return in late-October, and its dramas (including new series Big Sky) were set for mid-November.  CBS  CBS pushed back Season 32 of The Amazing Race to a fall premiere, with the new sports panel show Game On! moved up to fill its spot on the summer schedule. CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl stated that they hoped their scripted programs could return to production \\"at some point this summer\\", and that they could have \\"most if not all of these shows on at some point in the fall.\\" Kahl did not rule out other contingencies. On July 13, CBS moved up S.W.A.T. to a fall premiere to replace Survivor, which was unable to resume production in time. On August 26, CBS announced that it would air reruns of series from sister properties, such as the fourth season of One Day at a Time (Pop) and the first season of Star Trek: Discovery (CBS All Access, doubling as promotion for the upcoming third season. Its filming was completed in February, with post-production done remotely), and acquired series Manhunt: Deadly Games (acquired from cable provider Charter Communications) to round out its late-summer/early-fall schedule. CBS announced on September 17 that CBS Sunday Movies (which CBS introduced in May as a limited run to fill timeslots held by suspended programming) would air for six weeks through October and November, to fill timeslots until its scripted lineup resumes production. As before, they will draw from the library of corporate sibling Paramount Pictures. Premiere dates were announced for CBS's scripted lineup on October 13, which will begin with its Chuck Lorre sitcoms of Mom, Young Sheldon, and new series B Positive on November 5, NCIS: Los Angeles and New Orleans on November 8 (with the 10 p.m. hour being filled by \\"fan favorite\\" episodes of NCIS), S.W.A.T. on November 11, The Neighborhood, Bob Hearts Abishola, and All Rise on November 16, and NCIS on November 17.  Fox  Fox announced plans for its fall lineup in May 2020, having deferred most of its scripted live-action programs to midseason (animated series such as The Simpsons can be readily produced on a remote basis). The new summer dramas Filthy Rich and neXt were pushed back to fall premieres. The fourth season of The Masked Singer was to initially be joined on Wednesday nights by a new season of MasterChef Junior, while Fox also acquired network premieres of L.A.'s Finest (a series originally picked up by Charter after being turned down by NBC) and Cosmos: Possible Worlds (from former sister network National Geographic, which premiered on that channel earlier in the year) for the fall lineup, while Thursdays and Fridays would be filled by Thursday Night Football and WWE SmackDown as normal. In August 2020, Fox pushed back MasterChef Junior in favor of I Can See Your Voice, a new music game show that was able to resume production in August.  NBC  NBC announced on May 14 that it had acquired the Canadian medical drama Transplant, with a premiere date to be determined. In Canada, where the series aired at midseason on CTV, Transplant was the most-watched domestic production of the television season. A provisional fall schedule was unveiled in June 2020, focusing primarily on returning, established programs (with only one new series premiere originally planned, the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit spin-off Law & Order: Organized Crime), and no specific premiere dates announced. In August, NBC replaced New Amsterdam with Transplant for a September 1 premiere, and announced that the 12th season of American Ninja Warrior (which filmed at The Dome in St. Louis from late-June to mid-July) would premiere on September 7. On August 27, NBC announced premiere dates for a revival of the quiz show The Weakest Link on September 28, the new remote work sitcom Connecting... for October 1, the fourth season of Ellen's Game of Games for October 6, season 19 of The Voice for October 19, Superstore for October 22, and November premieres for The Blacklist, the Chicago franchise, Law & Order SVU, and This Is Us during the week of November 9. The network deferred its remaining fall series (including Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Law & Order: Organized Crime, Manifest, and New Amsterdam, among others) to midseason. On September 9, NBC bumped The Weakest Link to Tuesday nights with a September 29 premiere, in favor of a second new episode of Dateline on Monday nights from September 21 to October 12 (with The Weakest Link moving to Mondays to accompany The Voice beginning October 19). On September 23, NBC moved up the season premiere of This Is Us to October 27.  The CW  The CW deferred most of its fall scripted premieres to January 2021, The second half of the final season of Supernatural (which had been deferred to fall 2020 due to the pandemic, with two episodes left to film) would be joined by a lineup of acquisitions, non-scripted series, and delayed summer series for the network's late-summer and fall lineups, such as new seasons of The Outpost, Pandora, Penn & Teller: Fool Us, Two Sentence Horror Stories, Whose Line Is It Anyway?, and the new series World's Funniest Animals. It also acquired linear premieres of series from CBS and WarnerMedia's streaming services CBS All Access (Tell Me a Story) and DC Universe (Swamp Thing), and imported series such as Being Rueben, Coroner, Dead Pixels, Devils, Fridge Wars, Killer Camp, and Taskmaster (although Taskmaster would be pulled after its premiere due to low viewership). Many of The CW's scripted programs are filmed in Canada, which has had relatively better management of the pandemic than the United States. == News == === Modified broadcasting === Amidst their coverage, television newscasts and news channels, have encouraged physical distancing on-set, remote work, and increased use of remote interviewsin order to comply with CDC guidelines, with in-person interviews (universally with the reporter both shooting and editing their story alone) often using improvised setups to allow distancing, including microphone extensions adapted from monopods and improvised PVC pipe booms. Local newscasts have faced similar changes, with stations often limiting newscasts to one studio anchor (or two if physically distanced), and newsrooms minimally staffed. Local newscasters began working from home in some cases, with a minimal number of staff remaining at the studio. Some meteorologists have already had this capability, in order to provide coverage of severe weather events during overnight hours if no one else is present at the studio. On March 15, a one-on-one debate for the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries took place between former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders. After initially intending to hold the event at its original venue in Phoenix, Arizona with no audience or outside press, the debate was re-located to CNN's Washington, D.C. bureau to reduce unnecessary travel. It was ultimately the only debate during the pandemic, as Biden clinched the Democratic nomination shortly thereafter. Biden subsequently conducted media appearances and meetings from his home in Delaware via videoconferencing. Two of the Big Three networks' national morning shows — ABC's Good Morning America and NBC's Today —continued to have in-studio anchors in New York City, although some anchors were temporarily moved home, including Today Al Roker and Craig Melvin (as a precaution after a staff member of the program tested positive with mild symptoms), and GMA Robin Roberts (as a precaution due to past medical issues) and George Stephanopoulos. On March 11, the CBS Broadcast Center facility in New York City was closed for disinfection after two employees tested positive, resulting in CBS This Morning temporarily moving to the set of the CBS Evening News in Washington, D.C., and the newscasts of CBS-owned New York station WCBS-TV being produced and anchored remotely from the studios of its sister stations in California. While it re-opened on March 13, it was closed once again on March 18. CBS This Morning subsequently moved to the set of The Late Show at the Ed Sullivan Theater, before switching to a remotely-anchored format by late-March to minimize staff amidst heightening cases in the region. CBSN programs (including the CBS Weekend News) were hubbed from other CBS O&Os; and affiliates, and WCBS-TV newscasts were once again been hubbed, from Los Angeles sister station KCBS-TV. A WCBS-produced primetime newscast on WUPA — a CBS-owned The CW affiliate in Atlanta — was also suspended due to the shutdown of CBS Broadcast Center. From late-March through early-August, the newscast was replaced by a straight simulcast of a 10 p.m. newscast produced by sister CBS station WBZ in Boston, with little effort to localize the program's content besides a news ticker, and weather segments produced from Detroit (which aired alongside those that were Boston-specific). This arrangement remained until August 11, when WUPA's newscast was taken over by CBS's Fort Worth station KTVT and returned to a local format. On June 22, in concert with phase 2 of New York City's lifting of restrictions, CBS This Morning returned to its studio at the CBS Broadcast Center, with minimized staff and at least one anchor continuing to host from home as a contingency. Fox News Channel's morning show Fox & Friends also resumed in-studio production, with social distancing enforced on-set. === Pandemic-related programs === As the crisis became more obvious and activated, television news outlets began to increase their coverage of its impact at the local and national levels. Fox News Channel added more live rolling news blocks to its schedule (including an extension of Fox News @ Night to 1:00 a.m. nightly, and a new overnight block anchored by Trace Gallagher), while Fox Business scuttled most of its prime time programming in order to carry additional coverage on its impact. ABC replaced its daytime talk show Strahan, Sara and Keke with Pandemic: What You Need To Know, a special weekday program produced by ABC News Live and hosted by Amy Robach. After its late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! suspended production, ABC returned its long-running late- night newsmagazine Nightline to its original 11:35 p.m. timeslot from March 17 through April 10 (when it moved to 12:05 a.m., following the half-hour at-home episodes of Jimmy Kimmel Live!), with a focus on in-depth coverage. Most of NBC's owned-and-operated stations extended their local late-night newscasts to a full hour from March 16 to 27. NBC's Spanish network Telemundo pre-empted its late-night sports program Titulares y Más as sport had shut down because of the pandemic and extended their nightly news show Noticias Telemundo with additional programming billed as Coronavirus: Un Pais en Alerta (Coronavirus: A Nation On Alert), along with temporarily extending its morning show Un Nuevo Día by 90 minutes, its midday newscast Noticias Telemundo Mediodía by an additional half-hour and its afternoon newsmagazine Al Rojo Vivo by one hour, in place of telenovela repeats and unscripted entertainment programs normally shown in some weekday daytime slots. On April 26, Netflix premiered a special limited season of its documentary series Explained, entitled Coronavirus, Explained. The first of the three planned episodes was produced in two-and-a- half weeks, and reused interview footage that had previously been recorded for an episode on pandemics in general. In This Together: A PBS American Portrait Story premiered on May 8, 2020 as part of a larger series based on viewer- submitted content. Although What You Need To Know was initially promoted as a limited, interim replacement for Strahan, Sara and Keke, the program would persist indefinitely. Later in its run, it was quietly renamed GMA3: What You Need To Know (now branding it as a spin-off of ABC's morning show Good Morning America, using the GMA3 subtitle originating from Strahan, Sara and Keke), expanded its scope to include other news topics unrelated to COVID-19, and added T. J. Holmes as a co-anchor in September. In July and August 2020, it was reported by Page Six and co-host Keke Palmer respectively that Strahan, Sara and Keke had been cancelled by ABC, although the network has yet to officially confirm that this was the case. === Quarantines due to positive cases === Media organizations have also faced direct impact from the pandemic. Several correspondents have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including CBS News foreign correspondent Seth Doane, quarantined in Rome, ABC News correspondents Kaylee Hartung, quarantined in Los Angeles, and George Stephanopoulos (who contracted it asymptomatically from his wife Ali Wentworth while quarantined at home in New York City), and CNN anchors Chris Cuomo, Brooke Baldwin, and Richard Quest. === Departures from networks === On March 27, Fox Business pundit Trish Regan departed the network, amid criticism of a controversial March 9 opening monologue on her nightly program Trish Regan Primetime, accusing Democrats of exploiting the pandemic solely to blame President Donald Trump for it, and launch another round of impeachment hearings. == Sports == === Suspension of games === The suspension of nearly all sports leagues and competitions due to the pandemic caused complications for broadcasters, as major events frequently have a large number of live viewers and high advertising revenue. The largest and most significant events also represent a major investment by broadcasters; in 2019, the total market for sports media rights in the United States was estimated at $22.42 billion, representing 44% of the international market. CBS Sports and Turner Sports pay $785 million per-year to televise the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournamentwhose 2020 edition was cancelled only six days before it was scheduled to begin. In 2019, a 30-second commercial during the national championship game on CBS cost around $1.5 million, while CBS and Turner's contract to air the tournament accounts for nearly 72% of the NCAA's annual revenue. At the time of the suspensions, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL) were also approaching their respective playoffs, Major League Soccer (MLS) was already two weeks into its regular season, Major League Baseball (MLB) was approaching the start of its regular season, CBS Sports was approaching its spring events such as the Masters Tournament, and NBC Sports was also approaching its spring lineup (promoted as the NBC Sports Championship Season), including the Kentucky Derby, Indianapolis 500, French Open, and the NHL's Stanley Cup Playoffs—all postponed by the pandemic. Analysts felt that a postponement or cancellation of the 2020 Summer Olympics would have a major impact on NBCUniversal, due to the extensive rights fees it had paid to televise them, its large advertising inventory (NBC already announced that it had sold $1.2 billion in advertising for the Games), as well as the extensive use of NBCUniversal's various properties to promote the Olympics and vice versa; NBC was expected to use the Games to bolster the July launch of its new streaming video platform Peacock. On March 24, it was announced that the Games would be postponed to 2021. Sports-oriented cable networks have had to revise their schedules due to the lack of live programming, typically relying on reruns of classic events and other original programming, and cutting down on studio programming due to the lack of sports news to discuss beyond the pandemic's impact. An exception has been the National Football League (NFL), as it has already been in its off- season since early-February. The pandemic's surge in North America roughly coincided with the beginning of off-season business such as the free agency period, and the lead-up to the 2020 NFL Draft, which went on as scheduled, but with no public festivities, and conducted remotely. ESPN acquired reruns of several recent editions of WWE's WrestleMania events as part of the lead-up to WrestleMania 36, which had also been impacted by the pandemic, and ESPN2 organized an early reprisal of its annual \\"ESPN8\\" stunt (inspired by the depiction of a fictitious, eighth ESPN channel in the film DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story, which airs competitions that are \\"almost a sport\\") on March 22, followed by a May 2 edition on the main ESPN network (headlined by a deadlift world record attempt by strongman and Game of Thrones actor Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson). Regional sports networks have also been impacted; the sale of regional broadcast rights serve as a key source of revenue for many sports franchises. During the suspension of play, leagues granted RSNs easier access to archive content to help fill schedules, and some networks scheduled encores of games against opponents that their respective team would have played if the season had continued play as normal. === Modified programming ===  Professional wrestling  One of the few forms of sports-oriented programming in the United States to continue regular broadcasts at the onset of the pandemic was professional wrestling. WWE suspended in-arena broadcasts of its weekly shows Raw (USA Network) and SmackDown (Fox) beginning March 13, and moved them to a closed studio at its WWE Performance Center training facility in Orlando, with no audience and only essential staff present. WWE's flagship pay-per-view WrestleMania 36, originally scheduled for Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, took place under the same conditions (with two \\"cinematic\\" matches filmed at a second Orlando location, and at WWE's Stamford headquarters respectively). From the lead-up to WrestleMania through April 10 (and including WrestleMania itself), WWE used a pre-recorded format for its programs, before switching back to live shows on April 13. WWE NXT also returned to live broadcasts under similar conditions, from its usual home at Full Sail University in Orlando suburb Winter Park. Matches originally intended for NXT TakeOver: Tampa Bay — a cancelled WWE Network card that was meant to serve as a support event for WrestleMania — were retooled for airing on NXT episodes in April. The government of Florida issued an exemption to the state stay-at-home order on April 9, for staff of a \\"professional sports and media production\\" produced behind closed doors for a national audience. Mayor of Orange County, Florida Jerry Demings stated that the exemption was primarily intended for WWE, while Governor Ron DeSantis did not rule out its use by other sports bodies. All subsequent WWE pay-per-views until August 2020 were broadcast live from the Performance Center, and continued to include occasional pre-filmed and \\"cinematic\\" matches, including Money in the Bank (May, featuring a revamped version of its eponymous Money in the Bank matches taking place within WWE's Stamford headquarters), Backlash (June, featuring a pre-recorded \\"Greatest Wrestling Match Ever\\" between Edge and Randy Orton with new production techniques, simulated crowd noise, and other homages to WWE in the 1980s), and Extreme Rules (July, featuring a \\"swamp fight\\" match filmed at an outside location). All Elite Wrestling similarly moved its weekly Dynamite to the Daily's Place amphitheater in Jacksonville on March 18 for two more weeks of television. While closed to the public, other performers were present on the sidelines as an audience. The show moved to One Fall Power Factory, a wrestling training school in Norcross, Georgia owned by AEW producer Michael Cuellari for three days of taping on March 31, where the promotion recorded content for AEW's Road to Double or Nothing episodes of Dynamite. AEW returned to Daily's Place May 6 for Dynamite episodes (some tape days featured two shows taped in one day), and moved the Double or Nothing pay-per-view on May 23 from its original venue, the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, and also using neighboring TIAA Bank Field for a \\"Stadium Stampede\\" match. WWE began to add NXT talent and other Performance Center trainees as an on-set audience beginning with the May 25 Raw. They were spaced apart and placed behind glass panes. On August 12, AEW invited 150 friends, family, and selected fans to attend a Dynamite taping in an experiment to test changes for a return to ticketed events. On August 20, AEW announced that it would begin to sell tickets for in-person spectators at Daily's Place at 10-15% capacity, beginning with the August 27 Dynamite. Beginning with the August 21 SmackDown, WWE moved its main weekly shows and pay-per-views (including SummerSlam two nights later) from the Performance Center to Amway Center with a larger-scale production and a virtual audience.  Resumption of live sports  With the gradual resumption of live sporting events, broadcasters have taken steps to reduce the amount of on-site staff. Production teams on-site have typically been isolated into smaller units for social distancing reasons, if not working aspects of production remotely from their network's studio instead (a model that has been used for some sport broadcasts even before the pandemic). Commentators may also be required to call games remotely from their network's studio or at home. To reduce on-site staff during the 2020 Major League Baseball season, the home team's local broadcaster is responsible for producing a neutral host video feed to be used by each broadcaster carrying the game (including the away team's broadcaster and/or a national broadcaster, such as Fox or ESPN, where applicable), which augments it with commentary and surrounding coverage. MLB commentators will not travel to their teams' away games, but may broadcast home games on-site at their discretion. With the NBA and NHL having adopted a centralized \\"hub\\" approach to complete their 2019–20 seasons, both leagues employed a similar model with host feeds produced by their national broadcast partners (ESPN and TNT for the NBA, and NBC and Canadian broadcaster Sportsnet for the NHL). Both broadcasters had selected on-air personnel within the quarantine \\"bubble\\", but the majority of NBC's commentators worked games remotely during the early rounds. Both leagues are also experimenting with new types of camera angles that would not be possible in an arena with spectators present. To compensate for the lack of crowd due to games being held behind closed doors, some broadcasters are employing simulated crowd sounds sourced from their league's official video games, with the NHL combining them with recordings of team-specific chants contributed by fans, and the NBA using video boards erected on its courts at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex to display mosaics of remote fans powered by Microsoft Teams videoconferencing. Fox is experimenting with the use of \\"virtual\\", CGI fans to mask empty stands on its baseball broadcasts. By contrast, ESPN intentionally eschewed simulated crowd noise for its broadcasts of the MLS is Back Tournament, instead leveraging the lack of crowd and additional in-field microphones to provide enhanced in-game audio. WWE introduced a similarly styled \\"ThunderDome\\" staging at Orlando's Amway Center beginning with that week's SmackDown and SummerSlam pay-per-view), also using a virtual audience. === Alternative event programming === Sports broadcasters experimented with televised esports competitions, primarily involving sports video games and participants from their respective sports, such as the ENASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series (whose first event on March 22 attracted 903,000 viewers on Fox Sports 1, making it the highest-rated esports broadcast on U.S. linear television. A subsequent event simulcast the following week on Fox surpassed it with 1.339 million viewer),. a seven-week tournament that followed the original NASCAR Cup Series schedule (including taking the Easter week off), ending May 9, 2020 with a race on a recreation of historic NASCAR venue North Wilkesboro Speedway, in lieu of the Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway (which had been rescheduled for June 10), before the return of in-person Cup Series competition with The Real Heroes 400 at Darlington Raceway. The IndyCar Series and NBC Sports introduced a similar invitational series, while ESPN and the NBA organized an NBA 2K Players Tournament, and Major League Soccer partnered with Fox to hold a televised FIFA 20 tournament, featuring MLS players and professional FIFA 20 players from the game's esports circuit. In professional esports, ESPN2 would simulcast matches from the 2020 League of Legends Championship Series Spring playoffs. ESPN organized a televised H-O-R-S-E competition, featuring NBA and WNBA players competing via remote feeds from their personal courts. On May 4, 2020, ESPN announced that it had reached a deal for exclusive U.S. rights to KBO League baseball from South Korea for the 2020 season, leveraging ESPN Major League Baseball personalities working from home. Another major exception to the lack of live sports programming was thoroughbred racing at selected tracks; Fox Sports 1 is simulcasting the New York Racing Association's America's Day at The Races, while NBCSN partnered with TVG Network to simulcast its Trackside Live program on weekend afternoons. TVG itself switched to remote production, and on-air personalities began incorporating explanations of technical terminology to accommodate new viewers. == Impact on the broadcasting industry == Implementations of mitigations such as stay-at- home orders led to a major increase in the usage of streaming services. Two more major streaming services — HBO Max (WarnerMedia) and Peacock (NBCUniversal) also launched over the course of the pandemic, which has contributed to diffusion of content among multiple providers. In June 2020, Deloitte found in a survey that there was a growing \\"fatigue\\" over the number of competing streaming services, and that this and economic issues brought upon by the pandemic have led to increased churn, customers limiting the number of services they subscribe to at once, and growth in advertising- supported (either free or low-cost) streaming platforms. The pandemic also accelerated the market trend of cord cutting, the practice of reducing the use of traditional multichannel television services in favor of streaming services. Due to the suspension of production of launch programming for the network, Discovery Inc. delayed its planned relaunch of DIY Network as Magnolia Network (a new channel curated by Chip and Joanna Gaines of the former HGTV series Fixer Upper) from October 4, 2020 to a date in 2021. === On sports networks === Sports channels typically demand the highest per- subscriber carriage fees of any cable networks in the country. There were calls for broadcasters to compensate television providers for the lack of live events during lockdowns that these fees typically cover; New York Attorney General Letitia James stated that it was \\"grossly unfair that cable and satellite television providers would continue to charge fees for services they are not even providing\\". In 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios (as Diamond Sports Group) acquired the RSN chain Fox Sports Networks for $9.6 billion, a transaction mandated as part of Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox. The group holds regional rights to 42 professional teams across the country, and voluminous high school and college sports rights. Sinclair is also a joint venture partner with the Chicago Cubs in the team's new Marquee Sports Network. Concerns have been raised that Diamond Sports' investment in the networks may be vulnerable due to the lack of live programming, with an analyst stating that Diamond \\"may be heading for a liquidity crisis even sooner than we anticipated\\", as carriage negotiations with major providers may be more difficult without live events. In June 2020, citing the ending of its carriage agreements, the cancellation of NCAA tournaments, and uncertainties, ESPN announced that it would discontinue ESPN Goal Line/Bases Loaded, a part-time ESPN channel that carried rolling coverage of highlights and look-ins from regular-season college football games, and the NCAA baseball and softball tournaments. When ESPN instituted a similar channel for coverage of the MLB Wild Card Series games, such coverage was delegated to subscription service ESPN+. == Award shows == Several award shows were also postponed or reformatted, including the 2020 iHeartRadio Music Awards (originally to be held March 29 in Los Angeles and aired by Fox. Its ceremony was cancelled on August 24, with winners announced throughout the Labor Day weekend on iHeartMedia radio stations in lieu of a televised ceremony), the 2020 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards (originally to be held on March 22 in Inglewood, California and rescheduled for May 2 in a remote format), the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards (originally to be held April 5 and aired by CBS, but rescheduled for September 16), and the 2020 Billboard Music Awards (originally to be held on April 29, but rescheduled to October 14). The 74th Tony Awards (originally to be held on June 7 at Radio City Music Hall and aired by CBS) were postponed indefinitely, due largely to mandated closures of Broadway theaters in New York. CBS scheduled an airing of Grease as a CBS Sunday Night Movie in place of the ceremony. The 47th Daytime Emmy Awards cancelled its in-person ceremonies, which had originally been scheduled in a new three-night format. On April 28, the NATAS announced that the presentation would be rescheduled in a remote format, and announced on May 20 that the winners in leading categories would be presented in a CBS special on June 26 — which marked the return of the ceremony to television in any form (after having been aired online) for the first time since 2015, and its return to network television for the first time since 2011. On May 1, the Television Critics Association cancelled their summer 2020 press tour, originally scheduled for July 28 through August 13, and including the TCA Awards. The organization was unsure it could occur at all due to public gathering restrictions, and an anticipated lack of any new scripted or unscripted programming output, even in pilot form, to promote. The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards cancelled its in-person ceremonies (scrapping plans to hold a less- crowded ceremony at Barclays Center), relying mainly on pre-recorded performances and appearances on chroma key stages in New York City and Los Angeles (and in the case of K-pop group BTS, South Korea), and performances filmed on-location at sites across New York City. New one-off award categories for best home-filmed music videos, \\"quarantine performances\\", and music performances by first responders were also added. The ACM Awards would be moved to Nashville, with performances and award presentations divided between the Bluebird Café, the Grand Ole Opry House, and the Ryman Auditorium. The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards were produced behind closed doors from Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Jimmy Kimmel and award presenters appearing on- stage at the arena, and nominees appearing via remote feeds from various locations. == Affected productions == == See also == *2020 in American television *COVID-19 pandemic in the United States *Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television *2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike, last major interruption to U.S. television production == References == Category:2020 in American television Television ","title":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television in the United States"},{"id":"63910124","text":"Stjernberg is a Swedish surname.

Le protestantisme évangélique en France, 1800-2005, Édition Labor et Fides, France, 2005, p. 24 This is sometimes worth to him to be interpreted in a very literal way, in certain movements, and in particular the most conservative ones in religious matter (ultraconservative and fundamentalist movements). With the development of moderate evangelical theology in the 1940s in the United States,Robert H. Krapohl, Charles H. Lippy, The Evangelicals: A Historical, Thematic, and Biographical Guide, Greenwood Publishing Group, USA, 1999, p. 197 the study of bible has been combined with disciplines such as hermeneutics, exegesis, epistemology and apologetics.George Demetrion, In Quest of a Vital Protestant Center: An Ecumenical Evangelical Perspective, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2014, p. 128Roger E. Olson, The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2004, p. 49 == God == Evangelical churches and denominations had a Trinitarian theology.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 502-503John Howard Yoder, Theology of Mission: A Believers Church Perspective, InterVarsity Press, USA, 2014, p. 132 Thus, notwithstanding that in almost every major stream of Christianity, the one, eternal, and spirit God is eternally present and revealed in three divine Persons, namely, the Father (Almighty God), the Son (or \\"Only Son\\" - literal \\"μονογενης\\", \\"monogenes\\", \\"unique begotten\\", Jesus Christ); and the Holy Spirit.The insistent insistence of evangelicals in biblical writings certainly makes them differ from Catholicism in that they \\"only wish to justify this creed on the basis of biblical passages or concepts\\" and not on the Tradition or the Councils (knowing that the birth of this dogma is often attached to the Council of Nicaea which took place at the beginning of the 4th century). The evangelicals adhere (at least informally) to the Nicene Creed (381) defining the relational differentiation of God, both one and triune, as well as the principle of unity and identity, in the case of the two natures, in the person of Christ (christology),Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 95 as well as the positions of the First Council of Nicaea (and not at the council itself) which condemn Arianism. Nevertheless, in order to avoid any unnecessary controversy and especially because by humility they feel that the mystery of the exact relations between the three divine persons can only be beyond any human reason, they will not encourage speculative theology to this subject about what is not immediately deductible from the Bible. The Virgin Mary is so called because she was a virgin before the birth of Jesus but the evangelicals recognize the other children, brothers and sisters of Jesus and born after him, quoted in the Gospels (Mark 6: 3). She is recognized as \\"Maria Christotokos\\" (Mother of Christ) and is considered a model of faith, humility and obedience to God. Some evangelicals refute the name of \\"Theotokos\\" (Mother of God) of the Council of Ephesus (431) to avoid any confusion with the Marian devotion found in the Roman Catholic Church, but most evangelical theologians accept this formulation from a theoretical point of view by relying on the principle of communicating idioms and considering that rejecting it would amount to denying the uniqueness of the person of Christ; they generally complete it cautiously with a \\"according to its human nature\\".Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 596 The evangelicals reject the idea that Mary is co-redemptor or mediator, as well as the immaculate conception, the dormition and the assumption, considering them as biblically unjustified, as well as any form of Marian piety. This Trinitarian conception of God has various consequences in the Christian faith evangelical: === God the Father === For the Evangelicals like others Christians, God, is the creator of heaven and earth.Robert Paul Lightner, Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Kregel Academic, USA, 1995, p. 168 Moreover, God is presented as a loving Father, and the relation of the human to God must necessarily be that of a child vis-à-vis his father.Robert Paul Lightner, Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Kregel Academic, USA, 1995, p. === Jesus === Jesus is considered perfectly man and perfectly God (Christology). This component of the Trinity, has a resonance and particular consequences for the evangelicals # Jesus Christ is considered the \\"only begotten Son\\" of God or of the Father (John 3:16), without any biological connotation (belief in his miraculous birth), but in the biblical sense of the term, which according to the evangelical interpretation has a filial symbolic and spiritual status to God, brought closer to Isaac, the son of Abraham (book of Genesis).Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 240-241 # Jesus Christ is considered as \\"God made man\\".Robert Paul Lightner, Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Kregel Academic, USA, 1995, p. 75 It is a firm object of faith that Jesus Christ is only a carnal manifestation of God, and that He has existed from all eternity.Paul Jewett, God, Creation and Revelation: A Neo- Evangelical Theology, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2000, p. 429 # Jesus Christ is, considered in his divinity, as a stakeholder in the judgment of the living and the dead which will take place at the end times.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 671 === Holy Spirit === The Holy Spirit (or Spirit of God) God as Spirit is considered to be fully God. It is the eternal manifestation of God in the human dimension. It is the presence of the Spirit that Jesus promised in the Gospel to those who would be converted, attested by the first witnesses of Christ (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2).Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 569 All evangelical movements consider that the Holy Spirit is present and working in the personal stories of each believer, as well as in the future of the universal Church. As a stakeholder in the conversion of the individual, it is also considered to be the origin of various gifts, which vary a great deal from the New Testament writings, but it is common in the Charismatic movement emphasize on one gifts delivered by the Spirit.Peter Hocken, \\"Le réveil de l'Esprit: les Églises pentecôtistes et charismatiques\\", France, Editions Fides, 1994, p. 19-20 The gifts of the Holy Spirit are 9; creative gifts (writing and the arts), pastoral gifts (community guidance and guidance), apostolic gifts (preaching, teaching), prophetic gifts (prophecy in its various forms), prodigious gifts (wonders and miracles).Gabriel Tchonang, L’esprit saint dans l’orthodoxie et le pentecôtisme : étude comparative, Revue des sciences religieuses, France, 2008, paragraph 32 Evangelical Christianity, particularly in the Pentecostalism, Evangelical charismatic movement, Neo-charismatic movement, places an emphasis on the Spirit and its action in human lives and in the church.Sébastien Fath, Du ghetto au réseau. Le protestantisme évangélique en France, 1800-2005, Édition Labor et Fides, France, 2005, p. 183 == Adoration of God only == The evangelicals refute those designated as holy by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches because assimilating the worship of veneration, that gives these churches to the saints thus designated, and also particularly the worship to Mary, necromancy and idolatry.Franck Poiraud, Les évangéliques dans la France du XXIe siècle, Editions Edilivre, France, 2007, p. 212-213 They are based of the Ten Commandments.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 207, 1172 == Satan == For the evangelicals, Satan and his demons are responsible for curse s and temptations to sins.Robert Paul Lightner, Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Kregel Academic, USA, 1995, p. 141-143. == New birth== The name \\"evangelical\\" comes from the gospel term: from the Greek ευ-άγγελον (eu-ággelon, literally \\"good message\\", by extension \\"good news\\"). For the evangelicals, the good news is that every sinful man by nature must endure an eternal punishment in hell, but that by faith in Jesus and not by works, he can get the salvation and go to paradise.Brian Stiller, Evangelicals Around the World: A Global Handbook for the 21st Century, Éditions Thomas Nelson, USA, 2015, p. 49-50 In Evangelical Christianity, the believer obtains salvation by faith and grace only (Ephesians 2: 8). Salvation is the condition for access to paradise.Nigel G. Wright, The Radical Evangelical: Seeking a Place to Stand, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2016, p. 41 Salvation by faith is a personal decision and commitment.Richard Lints, Renewing the Evangelical Mission, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, USA, 2013, p. 141William A. Dyrness, Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen, Global Dictionary of Theology: A Resource for the Worldwide Church, InterVarsity Press, USA, 2009, p. 197 The believer is saved by the Imputed righteousness of Christ; all the merits of Christ are imputed to the believer by faith.Timothy Larsen, Daniel J. Treier, The Cambridge Companion to Evangelical Theology, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2007, p. 86 The new birth, this personal encounter with Jesus Christ that unfolds at the conversion of the believer, is considered a true passage from spiritual death to spiritual life.Wesley Peach, Itinéraires de conversion, Les Editions Fides, Canada, 2001, p. 56-57 This concept is based on John 3: 3 \\"Jesus replied, \\"Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again\\", \\"and John 10:10. Then we speak of \\"born again Christians\\" (see 2 Corinthians 5:17 and Galatians 6:15). It is indeed one of the most accurate ways of designating Christians of evangelical obedience from the angle of personal conversion. The meeting of the believer with Jesus and the decision to give him his life marks an important change of life.Frédéric Dejean, L’évangélisme et le Pentecôtisme: des mouvements religieux au cœur de la mondialisation, Géographie et cultures, 68, France, 2009, paragraph 5 It means repentance, which is recognition, confession and renunciation of sin.Robert H. Krapohl, Charles H. Lippy, The Evangelicals: A Historical, Thematic, and Biographical Guide, Greenwood Publishing Group, USA, 1999, p. 169 For the majority of evangelical Christians, the new birth occurs before the Believer's baptism, by immersion in the water.Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 54 For some churches, as Baptists, it is synonymous with the baptism of the Holy Spirit.Sébastien Fath, Du ghetto au réseau. Le protestantisme évangélique en France, 1800-2005, Édition Labor et Fides, France, 2005, p. 48, 111 For other churches, as Pentecostal, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a separate event that is necessarily accompanied by glossolalia and allows an experimentation of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.Olivier Favre, Les églises évangéliques de Suisse: origines et identités, Labor et Fides, Suisse, 2006, p. 55, 208 In the Evangelical Charismatic Charismatic and the Neo-Charismatic Movement, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is also a second experience. However, speaking in tongues (glossolalia) is not the only proof of this spiritual event. The believer may have received the other 8 gifts of the Holy Spirit set forth in 1 Corinthians 12-14.Sébastien Fath, Du ghetto au réseau. Le protestantisme évangélique en France, 1800-2005, Édition Labor et Fides, France, 2005, p. 219-220Thomas Hale, Commentaire Sur Le Nouveau Testament, Editions Farel, France, 1999, p. 447 == Sanctification == The sanctification of the believer is the process by which a person frees himself from sin and becomes pure and holy after the new birth.Justo L. González, Essential Theological Terms, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2005, p. 155 There are two evangelical positions on sanctification, progressive sanctification and whole sanctification.Roger E. Olson, The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2004, p. 319 === Progressive sanctification === Progressive sanctification is the work of sanctification of the believer through grace and the decisions of the believer after the new birth.Roger E. Olson, The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2004, p. 319 This is the position of some evangelical denominations, such as the Baptists churches and the Assemblies of God.Keith Kettenring, The Sanctification Connection: An Exploration of Human Participation in Spiritual Growth, University Press of America, USA, 2008, p. 29Cecil M. Robeck, Jr, Amos Yong, The Cambridge Companion to Pentecostalism, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2014, p. 76 === Entire sanctification === The entire sanctification is the sanctification work of the believer which becomes fully complete at the new birth.Roger E. Olson, The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2004, p. 319 This is the position of certain Pentecostal denominations, such as the International Pentecostal Holiness Church, Church of God (Cleveland), Christian and Missionary Alliance, and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel.William Kostlevy, Historical Dictionary of the Holiness Movement, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, p. 148 == Good works == According to evangelical theology, the good works are the consequence of the salvation and not its justification.Robert Paul Lightner, Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Kregel Academic, USA, 1995, p. 214 They are the sign of a sincere and grateful faith. They include actions for the Great Commission, that is, evangelism, service in the Church and to charity.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 524 They will be rewarded with the grace of God at the last judgment.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 1296 == Church == The local Evangelical Church is the organization that represents the universal Church and is seen by evangelicals as the body of Jesus Christ.Robert Paul Lightner, Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Kregel Academic, USA, 1995, p. 228 It is responsible for teaching and ordinances, mainly the believer's baptism and the Lord's Supper.Robert Paul Lightner, Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Kregel Academic, USA, 1995, p. 234 Many churches are members of Evangelical Christian denominations and adhere to a common confession of faith and regulations, despite the autonomy of the church.Brad Christerson, Richard Flory, The Rise of Network Christianity, Oxford University Press, USA, 2017, p. 58 Some denominations are members of a national alliance of churches of the World Evangelical Alliance.Brian Stiller, Evangelicals Around the World: A Global Handbook for the 21st Century, Thomas Nelson, USA, 2015, p. 210 === Ministries === Common ministries within evangelical congregations are pastor, elder, deacon, evangelist and worship leader.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, pp. 370, 778 The ministry of bishop with a function of supervision over churches on a regional or national scale is present in all the Evangelical Christian denominations, even if the titles president of the council or general overseer are mainly used for this function.John H. Y. Briggs, A Dictionary of European Baptist Life and Thought, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2009, p. 53William K. Kay, Pentecostalism: A Very Short Introduction, OUP Oxford, UK, 2011, p. 81 The term bishop is explicitly used in certain denominations.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 171 Some evangelical denominations operate according to episcopal polity or presbyterian polity. However, the most common form of church government within Evangelicalism is congregational polity. This is especially common among non-denominational evangelical churches. === Worship service === Worship service in Evangelical churches is seen as an act of God's worship.Gerald R. McDermott, The Oxford Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Oxford University Press, UK, 2013, p. 311 There is no liturgy, the conception of worship service is more informal.Roger E. Olson, The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, UK, 2004, p. 284 It usually contains two main parts, the praise (Christian music) and the sermon, with periodically the Lord's Supper.Bruce E. Shields, David Alan Butzu, Generations of Praise: The History of Worship, College Press, USA, 2006, p. 307-308Robert Dusek, Facing the Music, Xulon Press, USA, 2008, p. 65 The latin cross is one of the only spiritual symbols that can usually be seen on the building of an evangelical church and that identifies the place's belonging.Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christianity in the Global South, Volume 2, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 32Anne C. Loveland, Otis B. Wheeler, From Meetinghouse to Megachurch: A Material and Cultural History, University of Missouri Press, USA, 2003, p. 149 Because of their understanding of the second of the Ten Commandments, evangelicals do not have religious material representations such as statues, icons, or paintings in their places of worship.Cameron J. Anderson, The Faithful Artist: A Vision for Evangelicalism and the Arts, InterVarsity Press, USA, 2016, p. 124Doug Jones, Sound of Worship, Taylor & Francis, USA, 2013, p. 90 The main Christian feasts celebrated by the Evangelicals are Christmas, Pentecost (by a majority of Evangelical denominations) and Easter for all believers.William H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of the Baptists, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, p. 402 Daniel E. Albrecht, Rites in the Spirit: A Ritual Approach to Pentecostal/Charismatic Spirituality, A&C; Black, UK, 1999, p. 124Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 236-239 === Mission === For evangelicals, the mission is based on the Great Commission given by Jesus, to share the Good News of Kingdom of God, to form disciples and to baptize the believers. In churches, there are programs of evangelism local and international.Gerald R. McDermott, The Oxford Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Oxford University Press, UK, 2013, p. 170, 350 Most evangelicals believe that the conversion of hearts is the work of God alone, by his Holy Spirit (John 16: 8), but also know that sharing faith with unbelievers is an act of gratitude for what God did for them (Mathieu 10:32) Patrice de Plunkett, Les évangéliques à la conquête du monde, Éditions Perrin, France, 2009, p. 134-135 It takes shape in the distribution of leaflets and bible s, the formation of disciples, the support to the churches and the Christian humanitarian aid.Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christianity in the Global South, Volume 2, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 255 Various evangelical missionaries organizations have specialized in evangelization throughout history. === Charity === Charity, this concern for helping the needy, is one of three primary Christian virtues and a concept clearly established from the Old Testament.Frank M. Loewenberg, From Charity To Social Justice, Transaction Publishers, USA, 2001, p. 148 It is expressed first in terms of financial generosity but also in terms of time spent. It is also considered very important by most evangelical churches. Some churches give large sums of money each year on humanitarian aid (food support, medical aid, education, etc.). This value is at the origin of the modern Christian humanitarian aid.Christian Buckley, Ryan Dobson, Humanitarian Jesus: Social Justice and the Cross, Moody Publishers, USA, 2010, p. 15 At the beginning of the 20th century, the American Baptist pastor Walter Rauschenbusch, leader of the Social Gospel movement, developed the importance of social justice and humanitarian actions in Evangelical churches.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 1119 The majority of evangelical Christian humanitarian organizations were founded in the second half of the 20th century.Brian Steensland, Philip Goff, The New Evangelical Social Engagement, Oxford University Press USA, USA, 2014, p. 242-243 Among the most important are International Justice Mission, Prison Fellowship International, Samaritan's Purse, Mercy Ships, World Vision International.Wendy Murray Zoba, The Beliefnet Guide To Evangelical Christianity, Three Leaves Press, USA, 2005, p. XX The majority of Christian NGOs help everyone, regardless of religion.E. Ferris, \\"Faith-based and secular humanitarian organizations\\", International Review of the Red Cross 87, 858 (2005), p.317 == End of time == === Last Judgment === It is a belief in Christianity in general and in other monotheistic religions that at the end of time there will be a last judgment by God.Brian Stiller, Evangelicals Around the World: A Global Handbook for the 21st Century, Éditions Thomas Nelson, USA, 2015, p. 138 Jesus Christ will come back personally, corporally, and visibly. While other religions and branches of Christianity conceive that they will be judged on the basis of their actions, an important point of evangelical Christianity is to believe that humans will be judged on their faith, namely on their acceptance or not of Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord when they heard the Christian gospel in their lifetime. Good works are the consequence of the salvation and will be rewarded by the grace of God at the last judgment.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 1296 === The seven Dispensations === Some evangelicals are dispensationalists.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 344 They divide history into seven major periods (dispensations). These 7 periods are:Timothy J. Demy Ph.D., Paul R. Shockley Ph.D., Evangelical America: An Encyclopedia of Contemporary American Religious Culture, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2017, p. 100 # Innocence: Adam and Eve before their fall # Consciousness: Man becomes a sinner and has to answer to God # The human government: From the flood, God gives a political organization to humanity # The reign of the patriarchs (or the promise): Abraham, God promises the blessing to him who believes in him # The Law: God makes an alliance with Israel for His good and the blessing of the nations # The Church: God completely forgives those who believe in Jesus # The millennium: Jesus will come back and reign for 1000 years of peace on earth Thus, most of them believe in the second coming of Christ, or, for some, to its imminence that would then proceed to Rapture of the Church. According to them, and at first, the Church will be removed (1 Thessalonians 4.16-18) and thus preserved judgments that will affect the world (Book of Revelation 3:10 ) for 7 years, then will be united to the Messiah ( Rev 19: 7-8 ) before he comes to establish the millennium: ( Rev 20: 1-6 ) peace on Earth. After which will come the Last Judgment (Rev 20: 11-15), the end times and the entry into a new world (Rev 21: 1). * The Zionist Evangelicals: They are dispensationalists and Zionists because they believe they are at the end of the sixth dispensation. Indeed, for them, the creation of the modern state of Israel (1948) corresponds to the biblical and prophetic restoration of Israel, to the restoration of the chosen people, prologue the seventh dispensation and the return of Christ.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 1309 To help the full establishment of Israel and to support it is therefore to follow the plan and the will of God. *Non-Zionist Evangelicals: Though thinking to be in the sixth dispensation, they doubt or even perceive at all modern Israel as being the kingdom of Israel to be restored by the divine will.Tarek Mitri, Au nom de la Bible, au nom de l'Amérique, Labor et Fides, Liban, 2004, p. 183 For them, the modern state is a resultant of men and not of God; in this sense, they join the position Haredi or ultra-Orthodox Jews. To support this non-divine, non-prophetic Israel could then go against the divine will; their attitude thus oscillates between neutrality and hostility towards the state of Israel. * Non- dispensationalist Evangelicals: For them dispensationalism is a doctrine developed especially by Cyrus Scofield, human, not even mentioned in the Bible and therefore without any divine inspiration or foundation. However, this does not prevent them from estimating the second coming of Christ more or less close in time. Their attitude toward the state of Israel is therefore variable but generally neutral. == Controversies == A particularly controversial doctrine in the Evangelical Churches is that of the prosperity theology, which spread in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States, mainly through televangelism.Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 562 This doctrine is centered on the teaching of Christian faith as a means to enrich oneself financially and materially, through a \\"positive confession\\" and a contribution to Christian ministries.Kate Bowler, Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel, OUP USA, USA, 2013, p. 59 Promises of divine healing and prosperity are guaranteed in exchange for certain amounts of donations.Laure Atmann, Au nom de Dieu et… du fric!, notreafrik.com, Belgium, July 26, 2015Bob Smietana, Prosperity Gospel Taught to 4 in 10 Evangelical Churchgoers, christianitytoday.com, USA, July 31, 2018Gina Meeks, Megachurch Pastor Ed Young Promises to Refund Tithe if God Doesn't Open the Windows of Heaven, charismanews.com, USA, June 16, 2014 Fidelity in the tithe would allow one to avoid the curses of God, the attacks of the devil and poverty.John Blake, How passing the plate becomes the 'Sunday morning stickup', cnn.com, USA, June 14, 2015Raoul Mbog, Le juteux business du pasteur évangélique Dieunedort Kamdem, lemonde.fr, France, December 25, 2015Venance Konan, Églises évangéliques d’Abidjan - Au nom du père, du fils et... du business, koffi.net, Ivory Coast, May 10, 2007 The offerings and the tithe occupies a lot of time in the worship services.Marie-Claude Malboeuf and Jean-Christophe Laurence, Églises indépendantes: le culte de l'argent, lapresse.ca, Canada, November 17, 2010 Often associated with the tithe mandatory, this doctrine is sometimes compared to a religious business.Laurie Goodstein, Believers Invest in the Gospel of Getting Rich, nytimes.com, USA, August 15, 2009Jean-Christophe Laurence, Le business religieux, lapresse.ca, Canada, November 17, 2010 Trésor Kibangula, RDC : pasteur, un job en or, jeuneafrique.com, France, February 06, 2014Raoul Mbog, Le juteux business du pasteur évangélique Dieunedort Kamdem, lemonde.fr, France, December 25, 2015 It is criticized by pastors and church unions, such as the National Council of Evangelicals of France, in France.Henrik Lindell, Théologie de la prospérité : quand Dieu devient un distributeur de miracles, lavie.fr, France, August 8, 2012AFP, Le ruineux Evangile des \\"théologiens de la prospérité\\", lepoint.fr, France, March 26, 2013 == Bibliography == * Roger E.

He is also the director of the Imagineering Institute in Malaysia, the Mixed Reality Lab in Singapore and the CEO of Nikola Tesla Technologies Corporation in Malaysia. Cheok has sparked controversy for his conservative politics. == Education == Cheok obtained a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic) with First Class Honors in 1992, and PhD in Engineering in 1998 from the University of Adelaide. == Career == === Academic === In 2004, Cheok developed Human Pacman, an early augmented reality game. In 2005, he created the Poultry Internet project which used a customised haptic jacket to allow him to remotely hug a chicken. In 2015, Cheok and his students created Scentee, a device which allowed individuals to transmit fragrances via smartphones with the installed device and aroma cartridges. He has also performed research on taste simulation. In 2016, Cheok and student Emma Yang Zhang co-created Kissenger, a device which allows people to remotely transmit the physical sensation of kissing.

He is also among the faculty of Ducere Business School in Prahran, Victoria, and is a visiting professor at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia, at the Mihailo Pupin technical faculty. Cheok's research, in recent years, has focused on human sexual interaction with robots. Cheok has been criticised by colleagues for equating human-robot marriage with inter-racial and same-sex marriage, and concerns were raised over his professional conduct, specifically the ethical and consent issues of demonstrating cybersexual inventions with young female students. In 2019 Cheok announced plans to set up an institution called the Nikola Tesla Graduate School, with right-wing Australian politician Fraser Anning as honorary chairman and president. At the time, the school was asking for donations but did not yet have any physical address and was not registered with the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. ===Conferences=== Cheok is a General Co-Chair of David Levy's Love and Sex with Robots conference. The conference presented papers which explored the ethics and practical considerations surrounding sexuality and the field of robotics, specifically sex robots. Its 2015 conference in Malaysia was cancelled by police who declared it illegal and inappropriate for the country's culture, and in 2016 the conference was hosted by Goldsmiths, University of London. in 2017 Cheok provided a keynote speech for the Foundation of Digital Games conference. After the conference the organisers issued a formal statement censuring Cheok for his behaviour after he personally attacked an academic on Twitter when she criticised aspects of his presentation.Matsakis, Louise. (31 October 2018). \\"The Weird Saga of the Gaming Conference Hosting Steve Bannon\\", Wired. Retrieved 25 June 2020. Cheok served as chairman of the academic conference Advances in Computer Entertainment, and contributed to its demise in 2018 when members of the conferences's committee objected to Cheok appointing David Levy, who has been criticised for his views on the use of child sex robots, to the conference's steering committee without consultation, and adding a \\"Love and Sex with Robots\\" strand to the conference. Cheok responded by inviting Steve Bannon to give that year's keynote speech, prompting widespread international criticism from universities. Springer cancelled their involvement due to a low number of papers and concerns over irregularities in the paper submission and reviewing process.Matsakis, Louise.

At the 2019 Australian federal election, Cheok ran as a candidate for Anning's Conservative National Party in the Adelaide division of Boothby, receiving 0.79% of the vote.Boothby, SA, Tally Room 2019, Australian Electoral Commission. Cheok has been criticised for Islamophobic Facebook posts, and his use of Twitter has been unfavourably compared to Donald Trump tweets by critics.

The video was uploaded by Felix Kjellberg, the owner of the channel, on 2 October 2010. Also featuring Xebaz, a friend of Kjellberg's, the video shows the two playing Minecraft, a sandbox video game. \\"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\\" has been viewed more than 15 million times ==Background and release== Felix Kjellberg (pictured in 2019) released the video in 2010. Kjellberg registered his current YouTube account on 29 April 2010, after forgetting the password to his old YouTube account.This account would briefly serve as a 2nd channel from 2012 before it was later abandoned during 2014. His first YouTube upload was a different Minecraft video, which he deleted and no longer has access to. Nonetheless, \\"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\\" has been cited as Kjellberg's first video by various outlets. Kjellberg described his commentary at the time as 'shy', and stated \\"it was so weird to me, sitting alone in a room talking into a microphone. That was unheard of back at the time. No one really did it.\\" Released on 2 October 2010, the video is Kjellberg's oldest available for public viewing. The video was released while Minecraft was still in its alpha stage of development. The video's description reads: \\"My friend was going to show me something inside the building, somehow a zombie had spawn waiting for us in his minecart.\\" Indeed, the video featured \\"what sounded like a young man laughing heartily at an unlucky zombie that had gotten stuck in a tree.\\" The video featured mainly Swedish off-screen commentary from Kjellberg and Xebaz, although there is occasional swearing in English. This is in contrast to the English he has primarily employed in his later videos. ==Reception and legacy== \\"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\\" has been viewed over 14 million times as of May 2020. The video itself has been cited as one that turned Kjellberg \\"into [a] huge YouTube star\\" by Business Insider, as well as one of the \\"10 most important videos in YouTube history\\" by Observer. Despite Minecraft being particularly notable within the Let's Play community, which Kjellberg helped to popularize, he did not upload playthroughs of the game during early periods of the game's popularity. He stated in a video that \\"it felt like people were playing it just because it was popular, and not because they were actually [having fun] doing it.\\" However, in 2019, Kjellberg began to regularly upload Minecraft gameplays on his channel; Polygon wrote that he began to play the game, in part because, \\"he feels that he is flexible enough to not have the game define his channel.\\" The Verge cited one content strategist stating that Kjellberg was the top creator for the Minecraft keyword. ==See also== *PewDiePie videography ==References== == External links == * * Minecraft Multiplayer Fun on YouTube Category:2010 YouTube videos Category:Minecraft Category:PewDiePie ","title":"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun"},{"id":"63910230","text":"Ruan Tressoldi Netto (born 7 June 1999), often known as just Ruan, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a defender for the club Grêmio. ==Professional career== Ruan made his professional debut with Grêmio in a 4-3 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A loss to on 3 December 2017. ==Personal life== Ruan's twin brother, Ramon Tressoldi, is also a footballer in Brazil. ==Honours== Grêmio *Recopa Sudamericana: 2018 *Campeonato Gaúcho: 2018, 2019 ==ReferencesGrêmio Profile Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:People from Rio Grande do Sul Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense players Category:ABC Futebol Clube players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série A players ","title":"Ruan Tressoldi"},{"id":"63910255","text":"Prestige Ameritech is an American manufacturer of surgical masks and respirators based in Richland Hills, Texas. The company produced over a million surgical masks per day during the height of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and rose to prominence again during the Corona/COVID-19 pandemic. According to a whistleblower complaint by Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Prestige Ameritech offered to provide masks in January 2020 but was rebuffed by the Trump administration. Executive Vice President Michael Bowen noted that in the event of a \\"dire situation\\", his company could increase production by 1.7 million N95 masks per week by reactivating four N95 manufacturing lines in \\"like-new\\" condition at significant cost, but would require a major financial commitment from the government. White House economic adviser Peter Navarro said that \\"the company was just extremely difficult to work and communicate with.\\" On January 27 Bowen wrote to Bright, \\"Rick, I think we’re in deep shit. The world.\\" The same week Bowen predicted that China would eventually stop exporting masks to the United States, which would be a major problem as half of the U.S. hospital supply came from China. Bright asked a deputy to explore the possibility of diverting money earmarked for other purposes such as vaccines and biodefense towards buying masks and raised the alarm at a senior- level meeting but his pleas were dismissed by his boss Robert Kadlec, whom he later accused of nepotism in his whistleblower complaint. Ultimately FEMA took over mask acquisition for the government in March, during which Prestige submitted a bid. Bowen went on former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon's \\"War Room\\" podcast to press his case, and on April 7 Prestige won a $9.5 million FEMA contract to produce a million N95 masks per month over a period of one year at 79 cents apiece, a pace that did not require the company to restart its idle manufacturing lines. This deal was criticized as evidence of favoritism by the Trump administration, as this was only the second time in FEMA's history that a contract was awarded due to direct intervention by the president. == References == == External links == * Official website * Whistleblower complaint by Rick Bright Category:Health care companies based in Texas Category:Manufacturing companies based in Texas Category:Organizations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic ","title":"Prestige Ameritech"},{"id":"63910256","text":"Andriana Boyanova (; born 13 January 1985) is a Bulgarian footballer who plays as a forward.

Nakdimen covered many major stories in Louisville during his long career. He was elected to the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in 1998. ==Biography== David Abie Nakdimen was born in Rocky Station, Lee County, Virginia on June 28, 1933, the second of Lucy (née Steelman) and Abe Nakdimen's four children. ==Education== Nakdimen graduated from London High School in London, Kentucky. In the 1950s, Nakdimen attended the University of Kentucky as a Journalism student, where he performed research, collecting folklore in 1954 for William Hugh Jansen. Jansen had received the third Doctorate in Folklore in the United States from the Indiana University and was a member of the faculty of the University of Kentucky English Department from 1949 to 1979. Nakdimen was a member of the University of Kentucky's billiard team. Nakdimen and the team placed eighth in the National Intercollegiate Billiard tournament held February 23, 1954. While a student, Nakdimen also reported for the Kentucky Kernel. Nakdimen graduated with a degree in journalism. His first professional job after graduation was as a sports reporter for the Lexington Leader, then the afternoon newspaper in Lexington, Kentucky. Nakdimen was also a correspondent for the Louisville Courier-Journal in 1960. ==City Hall reporter== Known as \\"Dave Nakdimen\\" on- air and “Nak” inside the newsroom, Nakdimen joined WAVE (radio and television) News at the age of 28 on July 4, 1961. He was hired as the \\"City Hall\\" reporter. Nakdimen said of his hiring \\"WAVE was looking for somebody to cover City Hall,\\" he said. \\"I had never worked a day on radio or TV in my life, but I decided to take a shot at it.\\" In his first two weeks on the job, he met NBC news anchor David Brinkley and Ronald Reagan, then host of the General Electric Theater. He said \\"it was fun to talk with John Wayne, sit down with George Bush and chase Hubert Humphrey around.\\" ==Political reporter== Nakdimen's reporting professionalism and expertise quickly earned him the political reporter position at WAVE TV. Nakidimen covered Louisville and Jefferson County government, the Kentucky legislature, along with gubernatorial and other state and national elections for WAVE TV for 36 years. Nakdimen broke the story of the collapse of Louisville's Prudential Savings and American Building loan associations in the 1970s. Nakdimen also covered the Louisville area floods of 1964 and 1997, the 1978 blizzard, the open housing demonstrations of 1967, the tornados of 1974 and 1996, the Jefferson County school desegregation and court-ordered busing in 1975, the 1989 Standard Gravure shootings and other top stories including covering seven national political conventions. Nakidimen interviewed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during an open housing march in Louisville during the 1960s. After the interview, Nakdimen discovered his film camera hadn't correctly recorded the audio of the interview. \\"So when King came around the block again, we asked him if he'd do the interview over and he was nice enough to do it\\". ===Election coverage=== Nakdimen provided live and recorded remote coverage of the July 1984 Democratic national convention held in San Francisco, California for WAVE TV News. Additional commentary was provided by then WAVE anchor Don Schroeder who accompanied Nakdimen on the trip. During the 1988 presidential election coverage, then WAVE TV general manager Guy Hempel decided to \\"send the guy (Nakdimen) with years of local political reporting rather than anchor people\\" to cover the New Orleans Republican presidential convention that nominated incumbent Vice President George H. W. Bush. ===Louisville / Jefferson County (Kentucky) reorganization coverage=== In 1982, Nakdimen moderated a cable news show discussing the effort to reorganize the city of Louisville and Jefferson County, Kentucky as a combined metro government entity. Then County Judge Mitch McConnell and Louisville Mayor Harvey Sloane fielded phone calls during a live television show carried by the county and city cable television carriers. The 1982 vote for the Louisville / Jefferson County reorganization was predicted by all local television news departments as \\"an easy win\\". However, the referendum was \\"too close to call\\" four hours after the polls had closed. By 10:30 pm that evening, with 98% of the vote counted, the merger had been defeated. Nakdimen said \\"Modern computer science sometimes falls short and it did this time\\". In 1983, Nakdimen moderated a debate on government merger with representatives from both sides on the show Debate: The New Charter broadcast on WAVE TV on November 6, 1983. ===Commentator=== In 1970, Nakdimen was part of a WAVE TV News team that created Closeup: Report From Frankfort. The public affairs program was syndicated by the Kentucky Department of Public Information and was broadcast weekly in four cities in Kentucky and one in West Virginia. The 30-minute show featured \\"guest officials and legislators on issues vital to Kentuckians\\". Nakdimen frequently appeared as an interviewer on the program. Nakdimen regularly appeared as a panel commentator on the Kentucky Educational Television's show Comment on Kentucky from its inception in 1974 until his retirement. Nakdimen offered commentary from time to time during WAVE TV News newscasts both before and after his retirement. He ended each one by saying \\"...that’s my opinion. I’m Dave Nakdimen\\". ===Political debate panelist=== Nakdimen was a panelist in the 1975 gubernatorial debate between Julian Carroll and Robert \\"Bob\\" Gable, the first such debate ever telecast statewide in Kentucky. Nakdimen was a panelist in the October 8, 1984 Kentucky senatorial debate between Mitch McConnell and then Senator Walter \\"Dee\\" Huddleston broadcast statewide on the KET television network. The debate was held after the presidential debate between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale. Both debates took place at the Kentucky Center for the Arts in Louisville. ==News documentary producer== Nakdimen produced Open Housing, a 1966 color news documentary exploring the state of racial profiling in the Louisville housing market. Subjects interviewed included Louisville Mayor Kenneth Schmeid, Msgr. Alfred Horrigan, Rev. A. D. King and others. The one hour WAVE TV documentary aired on December 26, 1966. Nakdimen produced Downtown Louisville – What's The Big Idea?, a one-hour documentary that aired June 26, 1969. Nakdimen single-handedly produced the documentary over a period of 18 months. In a review by James Doussard, the Courier-Journal TV critic said \\"Dave (Nakdimen) has done one helluva good job\\". Written, filmed, edited and narrated by Nakdimen, the documentary earned praise for its deft use of humor to illustrate the challenges then facing the revitalization of Louisville. When Mayor Kenneth Schmeid said on camera he didn't \\"really think Fourth Street looks that bad\\", Nakdimen had \\"the camera - mounted in a car - pan down one side and up the other, letting viewers judge for themselves\\". Nakdimen said of the Urban Renewal efforts in Louisville \\"...some suggest the program has created a sort of ragweed Ponderosa, particularly in the West Downtown, where acres of land are cleared but undeveloped\\". After the documentary aired, WAVE TV's management said Nakdimen had been taken off regular news assignments, \\"turning him loose\\", becoming both the station's and the area's first full-time investigative reporter. ==Community activities== In 1984, Nakdimen appeared as a WGN Radio reporter in the then Louisville Museum of History and Science stage production of the transcripts of the Scopes \\"Monkey Trial\\". Nakdimen's character addressed the audience from behind a 1920's era radio microphone, leading the narrative through its ten scenes. The play was a part of the museum's \\"Jazz Age Beauties\\" exhibit, which examined American life in the 1920s. ==Reflecting on his career== When asked if he would repeat his thirty-six year career as a political reporter, Nakdimen said \\"I think so. I really enjoyed it. It was a lot of hard work, but it was a lot of fun too\\". ==After retirement== At his daughter's suggestion, Nakdimen started acting in the Mummers and Minstrels, an Anchorage, Kentucky-based volunteer performance group. He said \\"The first time I went on stage, it scared the hell out of me... there's no question that memorizing lines keeps you using your brain rather than sitting on the sofa and being a spud.\\" By 2011, Nakdimen had appeared in six productions in six years. ==Community service== Nakdimen served on the University of Kentucky Journalism Alumni Association Officers and Directors board. Nakidimen was a member of Louisville's Highland Baptist Church, where he served as a director of the church and as an honor deacon. ==Accolades== ===Upon retirement=== Senator Mitch McConnell offered a tribute to Nakdimen on the US Senate floor on July 31, 1997, saying \\"I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Dave Nakdimen, an outstanding newsman, who retired after a wonderful career in television news... in the world of television news it is extremely difficult to develop expertise in covering politics. Most of the political reporters that we deal with who are really talented... tend to be in print journalism. There is one real exception to that: Dave Nakdimen. Dave was the only expert political reporter I ever met in local television. He had a distinguished career. We will all miss him greatly. He is a man of great principle...\\" In a letter to the editor of the Courier-Journal newspaper, attorney Harry A. Triplett said of Nakdimen \\"Dave Nakdimen's retirement as a news reporter for WAVE TV will cause a void in the profession. He had a reputation among those who frequent the Courthouse, City Hall and the Hall of Justice as a 'straight arrow'. He was honest, fair and objective and never an iconoclast. He is a splendid role model for those who are and aspire to be reporters\\". ===Upon death=== Hearing of Nakdimen's death in 2020, Senator McConnell said \\"Growing up listening to election results on Eastern Kentucky radio, Dave Nakdimen seemed almost destined to become a political reporter. Dave was one of the best local television journalists I’ve ever had the privilege to speak with, and he earned a hall of fame reputation from his viewers and his colleagues alike. Dave was a trusted voice broadcasting some of Louisville’s biggest stories. He helped inform views on politics, housing and civil rights. Through it all, Dave brought integrity and principle to every aspect of his work, plus his signature dry wit.\\" ==Honors== 2011 – Silver Circle Award, National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, \\"recognizing lasting contributions to the TV industry in the Ohio Valley Region\\". 1998 – Gavel Award, Louisville Bar Association, given at the Bench & Bar dinner for coverage of the courts, including the first televised trial in Kentucky. 1998 – Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame, Kentucky Associated Press Broadcast Group. 1997 – Golden Mike Award, Louisville Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. 1997 – Jefferson Cup, Jefferson County (Kentucky) Fiscal Court. Jefferson County Judge Executive Dave Armstrong called Nakdimen \\"the icon of local news\\", saying \\"the community has come to rely on the credibility of his reporting\\". 1987 – Outstanding Television Editorial, Louisville Metro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi. 1986 – Honored by the Jefferson County, Kentucky Fiscal Court for having covered the County courthouse for 25 consecutive years. 1978 – Reporter of the Year, Louisville Bar Association for his ongoing interest in the legal system as reflected in his work. 1967 – Gabriel Award, Catholic Broadcasters Association of America for Open Housing documentary. ==References== Category:1933 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Lee County, Virginia Category:Radio personalities from Louisville, Kentucky Category:Television personalities from Louisville, Kentucky Category:University of Kentucky alumni category:American people of Russian- Jewish descent ","title":"David Nakdimen"},{"id":"63910278","text":"Airborne Forces Day also known as Paratroopers' Day () is a professional military holiday in Russia and other countries, celebrated on 2 August annually.

Specializing in Porsches for much of their history, the team competed at the top level of the World Sportscar Championship from 1983 until 1990 before finding success in the various incarnations of the Porsche Carrera Cup. The team was later known as Oberbayern Motorsport before their auto racing activities ceased in 2000. ==History== A former Obermaier Racing Porsche 956 on display Johann Obermaier started his small engine repair company in Halsbach in 1933. A takeover of the Allgaier tractor repair shop in 1952 brought Obermaier their first experience with Porsches through their tractor business. As agriculture sales started to diminish in the 1960s the company moved to automotive repairs until Johann passed away in 1967. Hans took over the company, eventually specializing in Porsche automotive repairs by the early 1970s while still working with agricultural equipment. The move into motorsports began in 1978, as the business was able to cover the cost of racing endeavors of Hans Obermaier with a Porsche Carrera RS and later Porsche 934. Obermaier had early amateur success, including winning a four-hour race at the Nürburgring and aiding the development of a rallying Porsche for Walter Röhrl but became frustrated with Porsche. Instead, a former factory BMW M1 was purchased for the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft (DRM) in 1980 for driver Jürgen Lässig, achieving mixed success over the following years. The pair formally creation Obermaier Racing in 1983 following the purchase of a Porsche 956 with funding from sponsor Hugo Boss, setting their sights on international motorsport with the Interserie and European Sportscar Championship with their new Porsche. Lässig with co-driver Axel Plankenhorn completed the European Endurance Championship for Drivers in seventh place, finishing all races during the season. Belgian Hervé Regout became Lassig's new teammate for the World Sportscar Championship from 1984 onward before later being joined by Spaniard Jesús Pareja, earning consistent top-ten finishes over the years. During this time Obermaier also made an entry in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) with a BMW 635 CSi for Harald Grohs, finishing third in the championship in 1984 and 1985. Obermaier upgrade to a new Porsche 962C in 1987 as well as new sponsorship from French company Primagaz brought by new driver Pierre Yver. The highlight of the year was a second-place finish at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of only 14 cars to complete the race duration. Meanwhile, Grohs competed in Porsche's new 944 Turbo Cup series, finishing in third place in 1986 and 1988. Lässig and Yver returned for a full World Championship campaign in 1989 but earned no points over the season. Otto Altenbach joined the team as a driver and team principal in 1990, purchasing a second 962C for the team but the season was yet again fruitless. Obermaier partnered with Antoine Salamin's eponymous team for the 1991 campaign with the best finish of fourth at the Nürburgring for Altenbach and Jürgen Oppermann. The team rounded out their 962 era with two final appearances at Le Mans in 1992 and 1993 with a seventh-place finish in latter event. The team instead concentrated on the new Porsche Supercup series starting in 1993, although international sports car racing was kept alive by appearances in the BPR Global GT Series with Porsche 911 Turbos as well as a joint effort with a Ferrari F40 at Le Mans in 1994. Obermaier continued to rank in the top five in the Porsche Supercup and Carrera Cup Germany championships, including winning the Supercup teams championship in 1996, until Hans Obermaier ended racing activities in 2000, concentrating instead on motorsport and automotive repairs and restorations. ==References== ==External link== * Category:German auto racing teams Category:1983 establishments in Germany Category:24 Hours of Le Mans teams Category:World Sportscar Championship teams Category:Porsche Supercup teams ","title":"Obermaier Racing"},{"id":"63910297","text":"The 1989–90 Northeast Louisiana Indians men's basketball team represented the University of Louisiana at Monroe in the 1989–90 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

Harris, Scarfe & Co., later known as Harris Scarfe. His son Harold Law-Smith was prominent in the history of the company. ==History== Smith was born in Westerham or Brasted, Kent, son of William Smith and Ann Smith, née Solomon. He received a good education and worked for a firm of ironmongers in Coventry. He came to South Australia in June 1863 aboard the Countess of Fife, under engagement to the firm of George P. Harris of Hindley Street, and transferred to Gawler Place in 1864. Smith was employed as a travelling salesman, serving customers in the rapidly developing districts of the South East and Yorke Peninsula. Smith was the ideal man for the job — knowledgeable, tireless and reliable, ever on the lookout for fresh fields to conquer, yet not one for self- aggrandizement — and was taken on as a partner in 1866. Around this time Harris also took on George Scarfe as a partner, and the business became Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe, & Co. in December 1866, with Smith as managing director. The company never looked back, but grew into one of the largest firm of traders in the Southern Hemisphere, with a reputation for good products and a fair deal. Around December 1918 Smith's health began to fail, and only attended his office intermittently, then died after a few weeks' incapacity. The funeral took place on 28 March 1919 and his remains interred in the family vault, Brighton Cemetery. ==Other interests== From the 1890s Smith was involved with other commercial concerns. He was a director of *Mutual Life Insurance Company of Australasia *Executor Trustee and Agency Co. of South Australia *United Insurance Co. of Australasia *Stannary Hills Mining Co. *Adelaide Rope, Nail, and Barbed Wire Co. *Adelaide Chemical and Fertiliser Co. and was a *foundation and life member of the SA Commercial Travellers' Association Inc. *councillor with the Town of Glenelg and Mayor in the three terms 1893 to 1895 *fine tennis player and in later life an enthusiastic bowler, one of the mainstays of the Glenelg club *contributor to patriotic causes during the Great War *sponsor of the Soldiers' Memorial Hall at St Peter's College *breeder of high-grade Shropshire sheep at \\"Sweetholme\\", his property at Strathalbyn. *breeder of shorthorn cattle at \\"Nomgetty\\" station of in Western Australia. ==Recognition== A window in St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide was dedicated to his memory ==Family== Richard Smith (born 1836) married Emma Law (1844 – 13 March 1918), daughter of John Law (died 1887?) on 20 March 1869.

Unlike most other video game genres, which are classified by their gameplay, horror games are nearly always based on narrative or visual presentation, and use a variety of gameplay types. ==History== The incorporation of general horror genre themes into video games came early on in the medium, with Haunted House for the Atari 2600 in 1982 one of the first such works. At time point, video game technology lacked the fidelity to carry the themes of horror in the technology and was instead wrapped more in game manuals and other presentation materials. Text adventure games like Mystery House The Lurking Horror by Infocom in 1987 also incorporated horror elements through its textual descriptions of rooms. 3D Monster Maze for the Sinclair ZX81 in 1981, while not containing images tied with horror games, was one of the first games to induce the feeling of suspense and mystery typically associated with the genre. With more graphical capabilities, games should start to include horror-related imagery, often present in the licensed games based on horror films in the 1980s and 1990s such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and Friday the 13th, as well as games inspired by horror films such as Project Firestart inspired by the Alien films. Due to limitations of consoles and computers, these horror images were often limited to cutscenes rather than the animated spirits used in the action-based gameplay as to give the fidelity to the details of the horror scene. Alone in the Dark in 1992 was one of the first horror games to bring the game to a more immersive presentation, using crude 3D figures drawn atop a 2D pre-rendered background, so that players would control their character from a fixed camera angle. This gave the developers to create the necessary sense of tension throughout the adventure game. Alone in the Dark was a global success, and directly inspired the creation of the first Resident Evil game in 1996, for which Capcom coined the term \\"survival horror\\". ==Defined subgenres== Historically, the classification of video games into genres ignores the narrative themes, which would include science fiction or fantasy games, instead preferring systems based on the style of gameplay or at times, types of game modes or by platform. Horror games is the only narrative-based classification that has generally not followed this pattern, with the narrative genre label used broadly for games designed to scare players. This broad association to the narrative theme of horror games leads to the lack of well-defined subgenres of horror games. Many gameplay-definmed genres have numerous games with horror themes, notably the Castlevania platform game series uses monsters and creatures borrowed from numerous horror mythos. In such cases, these games are still categorized by their original gameplay genre, the horror aspect considered a literary aspect of the game. However, there are some specific areas in the broad horror game classification that have been identified as unique subgenres in horror. ===Survival horror game=== One of the best-defined and most common types of horror games are survival horror games. These games tend to focus on the survival of the player- character in a horror setting with limited resources, and thus tend to be more geared as an action game or action-adventure game. A common theme of these games is escape or survival from the equivalent of a zombie apocalypse, with weapons, ammunition, and armor limited. The Resident Evil series coined the term and serves as the prime example of such games. Other notable survival horror series include Clock Tower, Dead Space, Fatal Frame, Left 4 Dead, Dead Rising, and Parasite Eve. ===Psychological horror game=== Psychological horror games are meant to scare the player through emotional, mental, or psychological states rather than through monsters or scares. The fear comes from \\"what is not seen, rather than what is\\". These games commonly rely on the player-character's unreliable perceptions or questionable sanity in order to develop the story. Through the use of unreliable narrators, such games may explore the fear of losing one's capacity to think rationally or even to recognize one's own identity. Psychological horror games may not depend as much on action compared with survival horror games, instead giving time for the player to explore and witness events. Phantasmagoria (1995) is considered one of the first such works of type, while the Silent Hill series, which is also based on survivor horror elements, is considered one of the defining psychological horror games. Such games may also take advantage of the video game medium to break the fourth wall and appear to affect the player's computer or console directly, such as with Eternal Darkness and Doki Doki Literature Club! Psychological horror games may still be tied to action-based genres; Spec Ops: The Line is a third-person shooter but with a psychological horror narrative inspired by works like Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. ===Jump scare horror games=== Jump scare horror games are designed around moments aimed to immediately surprise or shock the player when they do not expect it, as well as creating a sense of dread while anticipating the next jump scare. While jump scares may be elements in other horror games along with other gameplay aspects, jump scare horror games are generally limited to this type of gameplay mechanism. They are often aimed towards generating reactions from players, which have proven popular to watch over streaming playthroughs of games. Five Nights at Freddy's is considered one of the first main examples of this style of game. ==See also== * List of horror games ==References== Category:Video game genres ","title":"Horror game"},{"id":"63910650","text":"Leonardo Olivera (born 8 June 1987) is a Chilean footballer who now plays for C.D.

A second mine was opened across the river in 1899. One of the mines closed in late 1904, as it was no longer profitable. The remaining mine was closed in 1912 in response to miners taking a day off to support the Waihi miners' strike. The mine reopened at the end of 1914 although coal output didn't begin until August 1915. After industrial disputes and flooding, the mine closed permanently in June 1921 although fire clay was extracted from 1923 and there was some further coal mining at the end of the decade. ==Notes== Category:Whangarei District Category:Populated places in the Northland Region ","title":"Kiripaka"},{"id":"63910863","text":"The 1922 Akron football team was an American football team that represented the University of Akron in the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) during the 1922 college football season.

Upon his return a year later, his father made him finish school, and enrol in Law at the University of Melbourne. However after six weeks of studying Law, he ran away to sea again and didn't return for three years. During that time, he served in both the Swedish and Norwegian navies. After learning Swedish, he sat for the exams to obtain a Swedish master's ticket. Upon returning to Australia, he finally joined his father's business, staying for five years and studying accountancy. While working for his father, as a side business, Warner acquired a small fleet of fishing boats based in Tasmania. From time to time, he would take a break from business and work aboard boats in the fleet. Skippering his yacht, Astor, Peter Warner won line honours in 1961, 1963, and 1964 in the annual Sydney to Hobart yacht race, and came second in 1962 by 1 minute . The boat was named after the Warner family's household appliance company, Astor Radio Corporation. ===Boys marooned on the island of 'Ata=== On 11 September 1966, Captain Warner was sailing his Australian fishing boat Just David past the Tongan island of Ata. He noticed patches of burned grass on the island's cliff sides, which he thought unusual, and approached to investigate. Warner was greeted by the six boys, who had been keeping a lookout for more than a year. Although they had lit signal fires each time a ship passed, four had failed to sight the boys. Once aboard Warner's boat, they told him that they were students at a boarding school in Nukualofa, the Tongan capital. They had decided to steal a fishing boat one day, only to get caught in a storm. The boys had fallen asleep after dropping anchor north of the island of Tongatapu, when a squall broke their anchor rope and they drifted out into wild seas and gale force winds. Their trip to the island lasted eight days, and they needed to constantly bail water from the 24 ft boat. Fortunately, when at anchor they had caught some fish, and by eating it raw were kept sustained during the journey. The boat was beginning to break up when they sighted ʻAta, the southernmost island in the Tongan group. One of the boys, Sione Filipe Totau, went ashore first to scout the island. The others joined him, but it was nighttime and they were weak from hunger and thirst. That night the boys went hunting, drinking the blood of sea birds and draining their eggs. Once established on the island, they climbed to the top of a volcanic crater where they found wild taro, bananas and chickens descended from those cultivated when the island had been inhabited a century earlier. By the time Captain Warner arrived, the boys had set up a commune with a food garden, hollowed-out trees to store rainwater, a gymnasium, badminton court, chicken enclosures and a permanent fire. Upon their return, the boys were greeted by their friends and relatives, who had presumed them dead and held their funerals. However, they were arrested for stealing the boat, as its owner, Mr Taniela Uhila, wanted to press charges. Warner helped the boys get out of jail by paying Mr Uhila for the boat. He also secured the documentary rights to the story, with the boys acting as themselves in the film. He later had a new ship built, and hired the boys as crew. Author Rutger Bregman has compared the incident to Lord of the Flies, the 1954 novel by William Golding. ===Another Saved Crew=== In 1974 Captain Warner was undertaking sea trials of his refurbished fishing boat 'Ata'. On reaching Middleton Reef in the Tasman Sea he discovered four Welsh sailors from the sailing boat 'Sospan Fach' who had been shipwrecked on the lonely reef. The crew man who sighted the distress flashes from a mirror was none other than Sione Filipe Totau, the lead boy from Ata Island - now a deckhand on Warner's ship ! ==Later years== In 1968, Warner moved with his family to Tonga and lived there for the next three decades. In 1990, he became a member of the Baháʼí Faith and, in 1996, he helped found the Ocean of Light International School in Tonga, a Baháʼí school. In the 1990s, Warner’s career turned from fishing and shipping to horticulture, tree management, and the farming of nuts. Several years after returning to Australia in 1998, Warner founded Tree Carers Pty Ltd, a business dedicated to nut farming. In 2019, Peter Warner published a book about his life as a fishing boat captain and ocean racing sailor. He has published three volumes of his auto-biography- Astor: Adventures Ashore & Afloat Connor Court Publishing 2020 - on his upbringing and taking to sea and his yachting successes up to 1965.

A small, inconspicuous species that grows in the cracks of rock surfaces, it has a cosmopolitan distribution and has been recorded on all continents, including Antartica. ==Taxonomy== It was originally described by German botanist Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart in 1796 as a species of Verrucaria. Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst transferred it to the genus Lecanora in 1845. It is commonly known as the granite-speck rim lichen. ==Description== Closeup of apothecia on rock surface; scale bar is 0.5 mm Lecanora polytropa has a scanty thallus, which sometimes resembles tiny pale yellowish areoles. The tiny, flat apothecia typically measure 0.3–0.9 mm in diameter and may be scattered or clustered together. They have a waxy texture and are yellow to pale orange, lacking pruina. The margins of the apothecia are smooth, not prominent, and tend to be lighter in colour than the central disc. Ascospores are ellipsoid and measure 8–15 by 5–7 μm. ==Habitat and distribution== Lecanora polytropa grows on siliceous rock, particularly granite. It prefers locations with full sun exposure. It is common on exposed granite boulders and outcrops throughout its range, although it may readily be missed due to its small size. The lichen has a cosmopolitan distribution, and is known from all continents. It is found in the maritime and continental Antarctic, including the Antarctic Peninsula, Queen Mary Land, and Victoria Land. In a study of the community structure of saxicolous lichens found on rock faces within a radius of the Mount Tokachi volcano in Japan, researchers found that Lecanora polytropa thrived in the volcanic environment (close to the active fumarole) that was intolerable for many other species. Its tiny thalli can insert into the small depressions and cracks on the rock, helping it gain a foothold and begin surface colonization even when faced with the weathering associated with high winds and storms. Lecanora polytropa is also involved in the succession of lichens that appear on gravestones, and tends to maintain its presence long after its initial colonization. ==Similar species== Lecanora polytropa may be confused with L. fuscobrunnea, which has larger apothecia (up to 1.6 mm wide) that are partially blackened to completely black, and may have a rudimentary stipe. In L. polytropa, the apothecia are always sessile and not blackened. ==See also== *List of Lecanora species ==References== Category:Fungi described in 1796 Category:Fungi of Africa Category:Fungi of Antarctica Category:Fungi of Asia Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of North America Category:Fungi of South America polytropa ","title":"Lecanora polytropa"},{"id":"63911101","text":"Jacqueline Alway OBE, professionally known as Jackie Alway, is a British-born music publishing executive.

He was the winner of the Triple Crown in Trinidad and Tobago in 1982 and is considered by some to be the greatest horse to ever race in Trinidad and Tobago. == Backgrounds == Royal Colours is a Chestnut colt with a blaze going down his face. He had no white markings on his front feet however he has two socks on his hind legs. Both sides of his pedigree come from Great Britain. His sire is Calpurnius a sire with both Bull Lea and Hyperion in his pedigree, and his dam is Baby Princess. Royal Colours was bred in Santa Cruz Valley on the island of Trinidad. He was bred by Alwin Poon Tip and John Sellier who were also co- owners. == Racing career == At the age of 2 Royal Colours was not a particularly amazing racehorse. He wasn't a dominant force but he would manage to run in a handful of stakes races that year. He would have a few very tough defeats in stakes races mainly a second-place finish behind Mercurius. He was also second place in the Nursery Stakes to Search Part. But he was still able to win stakes races taking the Benson & Hedges Premium Stakes. As well as the Challenge Gold Cup managing to very game victory by holding off the late- charging Miss Amity. === Trinidadian Triple Crown === At the age of 3, he didn't start super promisingly with 2 defeats including finishing 8th 16 lengths behind the winner. Despite this, he would prove he had potential when racing against older horses in lower company at 1400 meters. In the race, he would come flying late to get up in the final strides to win the race over Acabar who was carrying 8.5 kilograms more than him during the race. Things would get more difficult after that as he would then run in the first jewel of the Trinidadian Triple Crown the Easter Guineas. The race would be packed full of difficult horses including his old rival at the age of 2 Mercurius who was considered the best 2-year-old the previous year. Even so, the race was going to be a difficult one for all of them as the race was a huge field of 17 horses total. The gates opened and one of the other runners Sailing Home throws off his rider at the start. Almost immediately the field of horses jostle for position with Royal Colors putting himself right behind the front runners closely behind Mercurius who took up a similar position. Shortly after the first turn, another horse throws off his rider by bolting to the outside. Mercurius was just ahead of Royal Colours but with about 600 meters to go Mercurius makes his move and takes over the lead. Royal Colours follows right behind making sure to not let Mercurius get too far ahead. But by the far turn through Royal Colours took the lead and opened up 10 lengths in the stretch. Following his win in the first jewel, he would continue his success with a win in the second jewel by 3 1/2 lengths as well as sandwiching in the Trial Stakes by 5 lengths. Those 2 races would be his preps for the final jewel of the Trinidadian the Trinidad Derby. The race began and with Roman Way setting the pace early as they went around the first turn quickly. However, this didn't last long as Casanova took the lead from him and began to open up but Royal Colours moved as well and by the far turn, it turned into a 2 horse race. The two battled down the stretch head and head neither giving an inch until the final 100 meters when Royal Colours gained the inch opening up 3/4ths of a length at the last moment. === Rest of career === Following his triple crown victory, he would then attempt a 5th straight classic race the Hopeful Stakes. In a surprise, Royal Colours took the lead and set it for most of the race. He leads around the first turn and around the backstretch and into the homestretch. He kept the lead but then in the final turn Cassanova took over sneaking up on the inside to take the lead by half a length. But there was still a good amount of stretch left with all his heart Royal Colours repelled Cassanova and took back his lead to win by half a length in the final strides. He would also add the Black and White Creole Trophy to his wins that year. However, he also suffered a hand full of defeats coming second and later being disqualified both the Diamond Jubilee Caribbean Champion Stakes and the President's Cup. To end his 3-year-old season he would run in the biggest race of his life the Clásico del Caribe. Immediately a change from turf to dirt was already gonna make it hard. As well as that no horse from Trinidad And Tobago had ever won the race. The race began and for most it right behind the front runner Guaybanex. In the final turn, he tried to make a move to catch Guaybanex but he didn't have it in him Guaybanex was simply too strong and would repel him 2 other horses would also make there move leading to a 3-way photo finish for second place. Royal Colours would get the short end of the stick finishing fourth only a length behind Guaybanex and a nose behind second and third. At age 4 he would run a total of 7 times managing 2 victories with 3 second-place finishes as well. Which included the introduction of the graded stakes system that same year. Royal Colours would get his first official grade 1 race when he took the President's Easter Trophy by a length. As well as having second places in major races such as the Cockspur 'Five Star' Gold Cup although that race was. His last major stakes victory would come in the International Trust Caribbean Stakes defeating champions from Barbados such as Martinique. As well as Dominican Republics Champion 3-year-old Senorita Cuquina. == Death == Despite managing such huge success winning against international champions from all over the Caribbean his 4-year-old season was cut short due to a fatal case of laminitis which would eventually take his life in October 1983. Despite this Royal Colours is still considered one of the greatest horses to ever run in Trinidad And Tobago and was able to mass up $384,117 Trinidad dollars as well as US$15,300 and 12000 Barbados dollars. In his honor Santa Rosa Park the racetrack where he took the Triple Crown has since given him his own race the Royal Colours Classic. It's a grade 3 race currently held in early February for 3-year-olds at a distance of 1350 meters. As well as immortalizing him amongst the greatest in Trinidad and Tobago by inducting him into the Trinidad and Tobago Racing Hall Of Fame.http://www.ttra.net/JetSamAward/RacingHallOfFame.pdf == References == Category:Individual male horses Category:1979 racehorse births Category:1983 racehorse deaths Category:Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing winners ","title":"Royal Colours"},{"id":"63911163","text":"Deblina Sarkar is an Indian inventor and scientist. She is an Assistant Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the AT&T; Career Development Chair Professor of the MIT Media Lab. Sarkar has been internationally recognized for her invention of an ultra thin quantum mechanical transistor that can be scaled to nano-sizes and used in nanoelectronic biosensors. As the Principal Investigator of the Nano Cybernetic Biotrek Lab at MIT, Sarkar leads a multidisciplinary team of researchers towards bridging the gap between nanotechnology and synthetic biology to build new nanodevices and life-machine interfacing technologies with which to probe and enhance biological function. == Early life and academic career == Sarkar was born in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, and pursued an undergraduate education in electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad, India. During her undergraduate degree, she focused her research on nanoscale device design and spintronics, receiving international recognition for her work. The paper she published explored the efficacy of double-gate MOSFETs. Before completing her degree, she spent a summer as an intern in Laurens Molenkamp’s laboratory at the Wurzburg University, Germany conducting research in Spintronics. She graduated with her B.E. degree in 2008, and moved to the United States to pursue both a master's degree and a Ph.D. at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB). At UCSB, Sarkar trained in nanoelectronics under the mentorship of Kaustav Banerjee where she pioneered techniques to improve energy-efficiency in nanodevices and developed novel field effect transistor biosensors using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). After completing her Ph.D. work in 2015, Sarkar began her postdoctoral fellowship at MIT in the Synthetic Neurobiology group. Under the mentorship of Edward Boyden, Sarkar developed novel technologies to map brain structure and function. In 2020, Sarkar joined the faculty at MIT as an Assistant Professor and became the AT&T; Career Development Chair Professor at MIT Media Labs. Sarkar is the Principal Investigator of a group of researchers which she has called the Nano- Cybernetic Biotrek Lab. Sarkar broke down the name of her group to explain why the name represents the scientific questions and adventure they engage in. The \\"nano\\" refers to the fact that the team builds nanoscale devices, cybernetic refers to using technology to control computing, biological, or hybrid systems, the bio represent the integration of biology, and “trek” represents the scientific adventure they have embarked on. == Research and inventions == === Atomically Thin Channel Sub-thermal Transistor === Sarkar invented the world's thinnest channel (six-atom thick) quantum-mechanical transistor, called the atomically thin and layered semiconducting-channel tunnel-FET (ATLAS-TFET). This device overcomes the fundamental thermal limitations in power of conventional transistors and achieves subthermionic subthreshold swing due to quantum mechanical tunneling based carrier transport. Efficient tunneling is achieved because of its unique heterostructure design consisting of doped germanium source, atomically thin MoS2 channel, and large tunnelling area. This transistor can help in addressing both dimensional and power scalability issues of Information Technology. Sarkar's efforts to build this quantum-mechanical transistor, was published in Nature (journal). This work was highlighted by Nature News and Views as \\"Flat transistor defies the limit\\". === Ultra-Sensitive Electrical Biosensors === Sarkar developed a novel Field-effect transistor based biosensor using MoS2 which provides high sensitivity, 74-fold higher than graphene, but also ease of patternability and device fabrication as it has a 2D atomically layered structure. Her development is compatible in biological tissues and provides a novel pathway to detect single molecules, highlighting the power of MoS2 materials in the next-generation of biosensors. Moreover, Sarkar showed that steep turn-ON characteristics, obtained through novel technology such as band-to-band tunneling, can result in unprecedented performance improvement compared to that of conventional electrical biosensors, with around 4 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity and 10-fold lower detection time. This can open up new avenues for wearable/implantable medical devices as well as point-of-care applications. === High-Frequency Model of Graphene === Sarkar and team developed a detailed methodology for the accurate evaluation of DC to high- frequency impedance of 2D layered structures. This model provides insights into the physics of on-chip 2D interconnects and inductors and revealed for the first-time anomalous skin effect in graphene. Going beyond the simplifying assumptions of Ohm’s law, this model takes into account the effects of electric-field variation within mean free path and current dependency on the nonlocal electric-field, to accurately capture the high-frequency behavior of graphene. It showed for the first time that the high-frequency resistance of intercalation doped multi-layer graphene interconnects is lower than that of Cu and Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs). Moreover, as high as 32% and 50% improvements in Quality-factor compared to Copper and CNTs respectively, can be achieved with graphene-based inductors. This model is critical for building high frequency/RF devices in emerging technologies including “all 2D” integrated circuits, which can lead to flexible/conformable computers and prosthetic devices. === Nanoscale Mapping of the Brain === Sarkar and team, developed a novel tool called iterated direct expansion microscopy (idExM), which enables researchers optical access to nanoscale structures by expanding tissues. Cellular structures, such as synapses between neurons, are densely packed with molecules impeding access of antibodies and other labelling tools. Further, target molecules might be beyond the limits of diffraction such that light microscopes are unable to capture the fine detail and resolution of biological units. To enable visualization of nanoscale biological architectures as well as gain labeling access to even the most dense biological structures, Sarkar and her team developed idExM where they imbed tissue in hydrogel and use both mechanical and electrostatic forces to achieve nearly 100 fold linear expansion of tissues. This technology revealed nanoscale trans-synaptic architecture in brain tissue and intricate organization of amyloid-β plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease. == Awards and honors == * 2020 Distinguished Alumnus Award as a \\"Young Achiever\\" from Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad * 2018 NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award * 2018 MIT Technology Review's Top 10 Innovator Under 35 from India == Select publications == * Iterative Direct Expansion Microscopy.

He was also the founder of the Christian Ranist movement. == Biography == He followed the philosophy courses and for three years he lived in seclusion in a monastery in Pietrasanta under the advice of Don Orione. He was a great admirer of San Francesco D’Assisi and therefore he could not adapt to the conventional commercial system; his innumerable works were thus sold by him for little money. He was an artist practicing asceticism, to imitate the saint to whom he was devoted. The two natures, the human and the aesthetic, perfectly coincide in his tormented figure. === From Genoa to Courmayeur === Gentilini was born in Genoa on 7 February 1911, but Courmayeur, precisely in Portoud in Val Vení, where his family owned a hotel, was his adopted homeland, where he spent his youth. Of the period of Courmayeur are the \\"Totems\\", as the artist named his wooden creations, which recall something primitive and raw, rich in images and signs that show an instinctive force, an explosion of sensations still messy and confused. === The retreat in Volpeglino === In the early 1960s, Gentilini retired to Volpeglino, where he remained until his death on August 10, 1982, and, today, following a donation, the house-studio, in which he painted walls, doors, windows and furniture with furniture and objects built by assembling the most varied materials, belongs to the Municipality and could be transformed into a museum center dedicated to the artist's works. === His painting === His painting captures the moments, small moments that we try to hold back, nuances of the soul, sensations that remain in a sign, in a hatch that vaguely recalls Mirò with the decomposition of Picasso, Braque and Lager. It captures a characteristic characteristic of art and Fauvism (thus recalling Matisse) which suggests feelings and moods through the subjective and anti-naturalistic use of colors. His paintings are characterized by bright colors, strident and violent colors, developed in almost cubist compositions, in which the fillings of pure color create a dialectic that is projected out of the canvas, expressing the artist's moods in a genuine way, often of pain and despair, responding in color in the joy of living, a mystical and spiritual tension towards God who wants to communicate to the whole world. His pictorial sign is fast, decisive, like his gestures, essential and urgent, expressed characters expressed through the use of guaches and acrylic colors. thumb He was very innovative in fact for his time, dedicating himself to painting with great transport, preferring the oil technique without neglecting the use of acrylic colors that date back to the years spent in Portud (Courmayeur), years where his sensitivity led him to observe and protect animals (like St. Francis) and take on the frog as a symbol of man. Thus he founded the Sect of the Ranists. Painting and sculpture are the means of reaching mystically a revelation of the divine. It was very prolific and had its heyday around the 1970s when his fame spanned regional borders to Switzerland. Some evidence of his art can also be found in the frescoes and stained glass windows of the church of Santa Giulietta S. Colombano in Pavia, where his abstract figurative tale is made of lights, colors of spaces and rhythms. === Values of the Ranists === The frog is a symbol of man: it takes the momentum, makes a small jump and then falls to the ground to jump again, but it does not presume to detach itself from the world. So is man in his search for God. Man cannot move by himself, nor dominate matter. Ranists are a group of ascetics who in divine contemplation and work find the completion and full realization of earthly life. == Quotes == \\"I try to make the void – said Gentilini – This emptiness causes me a certain catharsis: I observe sensitive values that I respect, I re-evaluate them, but I never know how I will fall into the picture and this is the realization of a truth towards the sign never thought\\". A talent moved thanks to the mother who believed in him: \\"... as a boy I drew very well. It was a childish drawing. It had characteristics above normal. Then I was started by mom, cared for above all by this mom, at the drawing. I started with drawing to move on to painting. When I felt that this talent was moving and could make up for every technique, I also abandoned drawing for painting ... \\" From man to artist: “Everywhere I go I have an ideal citizenship. It is not for nothing that I spent ten years on the sidewalk, homeless, as reporters say, in search of human contacts, to better express in art the spirit of an era that is anything but twilight, even inclined to convert austerity from parade of the old architecture in free, aerial figurations. I come from the figurative, I am immensely interested in the 'beat' costume, which I consider the best of today's society \\" Gentilini defines himself as not a painter but \\"inventor of shapes\\" == Quotes about the author == The poet Curzia Ferrari wrote about him when he said that Aldo Gentilini was able to \\"unhinge men and objects to mix the fragments in\\" gouaches \\", paintings and sculptures that seem to bring us back, through color or shape, to a primordial analysis of matter\\". Dominga de la Quintana defines it as an epigone of cubism, \\"a reality torn in its most hidden details and recomposed according to ever-changing patterns\\". The \\"Panorama\\" magazine of 1963 defines Aldo Gentilini \\"painter of all the anxieties of our time\\". The Corona Cinematografica production company talks about it in 1975 in a video from the Luce Archive (created for the Exposition in Milan at the Science Museum): \\"Welcomed with enormous success at the Science Museum of Milan, the Madonnas of Aldo Gentilini, the Genoese painter and sculptor who has now become a permanent member of the great masters of our century, endowed with a great humanistic culture and educated to a strict and voluntary monastic discipline, With his works, Aldo Gentilini transmits a message of brotherhood and a yearning for freedom that everyone can understand and accept. Gentilini's works appear in the galleries of the most important Italian and foreign cities, the exhibitions dedicated to his works are not counted, nor they have been staged in France, Belgium, Holland, America and Australia. Gentilini's painting which critics have always approached with the awareness of having in front of authentic works of art, can be exuberant and full of colors in sadness and knows how to dispense joy even with the shades of tragedy. The compositions of this artist have a common denominator, the will to make people feel the power of human relationship understood as a possibility of survival offered to our civilization.\\" === Exhibitions === He has exhibited in many collective and personal exhibitions in Italy, France, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Canada, America, Australia, Germany and Switzerland. In 1953 he exhibited at the Galleria S. Matteo in Genoa, in 1959 he exhibited at the Palazzetto di Venezia in Rome, in 1958 and 1967 at the S. Fedele in Milan. In 1973 he exhibited in anthology at the Cloister of the Monastery of Pietrasanta and in 1976 in Lugano. As in the case of Guttuso and Brindisi, in 1982 he was awarded \\"The Golden Oak\\" prize in Bologna. === List by year === 1953 – Exhibition in Genoa at the S.

June 22, 1979) is a Swiss electrical engineer and an Associate Professor and Principal Investigator of the Power Systems Laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zürich within the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering. Hug studies the control and optimization of electrical power systems with a focus on sustainable energy. == Early life and education == In 1999, Hug pursued her graduate studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zürich. She first obtained her Master’s in 2004 and then went on to complete her Ph.D. in 2008. During her Master’s, Hug worked under the mentorship of Manfred Morari where she conducted research on flexible AC transmission system devices (FACTS) which enable enhanced opportunities to control and optimize power usage in existing and new power lines. Her thesis explored a new way of controlling water level in river power plants. She based her method on Model Predictive Control in order to minimize variations and fluctuations that lead to wasted energy and environmental harm. Hug then worked in the Power Systems Laboratory during her PhD under the mentorship of Göran Andersson. She explored the methods to determine appropriate settings for FACTS where the considered area of the FACTS is determined by a sensitivity analysis. This simulation with a restricted area allows determination of the state of an energy system in the case of a black out without having to compete a full-load flow simulation of the entire area. While pursuing her engineering degrees, Hug also completed her Diploma in Higher Education Teaching in 2007. == Career and research == Following her graduate training, Hug moved to Canada in 2008 where she worked within the Special Studies Group at Hydro One in Toronto, Ontario. She worked for one year as an Assistant Network Management Engineer. In 2009, Hug joined the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as Affiliated Engineering Professor in Engineering and Public Policy. She also became the Co-Director of the electric Energy Systems Group (EESG) at Carnegie Mellon, as well as the leader of the thrust area on Transmission and Distribution Management in the SRC Smart Grid Research Center. At Carnegie Mellon, Hug worked on exploring optimal operation of electrical energy systems in order to explore the best way to distribute energy generation, and store energy within an energy system. Distributed energy generation and storage capacity will enable integration of renewable energy sources and lead to more sustainable, efficient, and flexible energy systems. As such, Hug worked to develop flexible algorithms such that storage devices can be efficiently regulated between storage modes and usage modes. Since 2015 she has been an Associate Professor and Principal Investigator of the Power Systems Laboratory at ETH Zürich. Hug also continues to be a Collaborating Professor at Carnegie Mellon in Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as in Engineering and Public Policy. She is also a member of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center. === Control and optimization of distributed energy systems === Hug emphasizes the need to switch to renewable energy sources to keep the world a hospitable place. She works on exploring ways to address the variability and intermittency of renewable energy generation such that one day we can use various sources of sustainable energy to reliably power the grid. To do this, Hug and her team simulate the grid and determine the optimal decisions in order to combine and distribute energy sources within the grid. Since coordinating the large number of distributed nodes will be quite challenging, Hug has proposed a distributed energy management approach which uses intelligence to balance supply and demand. Hug also shows that distributed cooperative control strategies work to coordinate energy storage systems in the energy grid. These energy storage systems need to be able to charge and discharge at the right times to be effective, so Hug tested the implementation of a distributed cooperative control strategy to manage the energy storage systems. Through simulating her distributed cooperative control strategy, Hug saw that losses can be minimized while supply and demand balance is met. Since a distributed grid contains a lot of data regarding energy usage, this data has a high potential to be cyber-attacked, so in addition to her energy optimization research, Hug also looks at ways to target and prevent cyber-attack on these energy grid system. She uses algorithms to model an attacker's most likely points of attack and this provides guidance on where the most security and protection is needed in the grid. == Awards and honors == * 2019 ALEA Award - Art of Leadership Award ETH Zürich * 2015 Eta Kappa Nu Excellence in Teaching Award * 2014 Raymond John Wean Foundation Career Development Professorship at Carnegie Mellon University * 2013 George Tallman Ladd Award * 2013 IEEE Power and Energy Society Outstanding Young Engineer Award * 2013 US National Science Foundation Career Award * 2008 ABB Research Award in Honor of Hubertus von Gruenberg for her PhD Thesis * 2005 EtherCAT Technology Group Innovation Award For her Master’s Thesis * 2004 ETH Zürich Medal == Select publications == * Active Distribution Grids Offering Ancillary Services in Islanded and Grid-Connected Mode.

This track is under the jurisdiction of Northeast Frontier Railway. ==History== === Cooch Behar State Railway === The Cooch Behar State Railway (CBSR) was a narrow gauge railway line that was built between Jayanti in the current Alipurduar district of West Bengal, India to Lalmonirhat in the current Lalmonirhat district in Bangladesh before partition between 1893-1898. The line originated from Jayanti near the foothills of Eastern Himalayas and went via Alipurduar, Cooch Behar, Dinhata and Gitaldaha to finally join the narrow gauge track of Kaunia–Dharlla State Railway at Mogalhat. This line was later brought by Eastern Bengal Railway in 1899. === Eastern Bengal Railway === The Kaunia-Dharlla state railway was constructed as a narrow gauge line from Teesta Railway junction to Mogalhat on 1882 by EBR. As a part of linking with the Katihar-Raiganj-Dinajpur-Parbatipur-Rangpur-Kaunia main metre gauge line the Kaunia-Mogalhat-Gitaldaha NG section was converted to metre gauge from 1901-02. The 25 km long Gitaldaha-Golakganj section was built as a part of the main metre gauge line on 1902 via Bamanhat & Sonahat. This metre gauge line was further extended to Amingaon via Fakiragram & Kokrajhar on 1906. The Jayanti-Gitaldaha junction section was converted to metre gauge on 1910. === Post Partition === With the partition of India on 1947, the Assam links to Bengal were snapped. Further the Gitaldaha-Mogalhat rail transit point became defunct as the railway bridge over Dharla river was washed away in floods. The Alipurduar-Bamanhat section and Fakiragram-Golakganj sections were cutoff as well and became isolated metre gauge sections. As a part of the Assam Link project a 229 km line was constructed between Kishanganj and Fakiragram in 1948. Thus these 2 sections became branch lines. ==Gauge Conversion== The Alipurduar-Bamanhat branch line was converted from metre gauge to broad gauge and was reopened to public on 2007. A new station called the New Gitaldaha station was built to be used instead of the old Gitaldaha junction. The Fakiragram-Golakganj-Dhubri section was converted from metre gauge to broad gauge during 2010. Golakgunj was linked with New Cooch Behar with a new line on 2012 as a part of the New Maynaguri-Jogighopa project. ==References== Category:5 ft 6 in gauge railways in India Category:Rail transport in West Bengal ","title":"Alipurduar–Bamanhat branch line"},{"id":"63911397","text":"In medicine, clinophilia is a sleep disorder described as the tendency of a patient to remain in bed in a reclined position without sleeping for prolonged periods of time. == References == Category:Medical terminology Category:Sleep disorders ","title":"Clinophilia"},{"id":"63911402","text":"Khandaker Abdul Mannan is a Bangladesh Freedom Party politician and the former Member of Parliament of Comilla-6. ==Career== Mannan was elected to parliament from Comilla-6 in 1986.

His nickname came from a childhood fondness for rice pudding.Wisden 2009, p. 1618. His older brother John played for Border in the 1930s before Ricey's career began. Ricey Phillips was an opening batsman and occasional leg-spin bowler. He began his first-class career aged 19 in 1939–40, the last South African season before the Second World War intervened. In his fifth match, the last of the season, he was asked to bowl for the first time. He promptly took a hat-trick with the third, fourth and fifth balls of his first over, and finished the innings with 5 for 38 from 40 deliveries. During the war he served with the South African forces in North Africa and was captured at Tobruk.

He has served as deputy minister of industry and commerce and as a member of the National Assembly of Zimbabwe for Bulawayo South since September 2018. He is a member of ZANU–PF. Originally from Gujarat, India, he graduated from South Gujarat University and briefly worked for an electricity board. In 1981, he married Parul Kothari, who was originally from Zimbabwe. A few months later, the newlywed couple went to Zimbabwe for what was supposed to be a temporary visit, but ended up staying after Parul's father died. Modi found work at a department store and eventually opened a tuck shop. In 1999, he opened his first supermarket, eventually owning as many as twelve before selling them in 2013. He currently runs a liquor wholesale business, several manufacturing facilities, and other businesses. Modi joined ZANU–PF in the early 2000s, and went on to hold leadership roles at the district, ward, and provincial level. He was seen as an ally of Emmerson Mnangagwa amid the factional infighting within the party leading up to the 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'état. His election to parliament in 2018 made him the only successful ZANU–PF candidate in Bulawayo, traditionally an opposition Movement for Democratic Change stronghold. After the election, he was named to President Mnangagwa's cabinet as deputy industry and commerce minister. He is the first Indian MP in Zimbabwe and the only Indian government minister in Africa outside South Africa. == Early life and education == Rajeshkumar Indukant Modi was born on 4 February 1959 in Rajpipla, Gujarat, in western India. He came from a middle-class family that sometimes struggled financially. He attended M. R. Vidyalay Primary School, followed by A. V. Patel High School in Ahmedabad. During his school years, he played basketball and field hockey. He went on to study at South Gujarat University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1981. In 1979, while still a university student, he started working as a cashier for the Gujarat Electricity Board, a job he held for two years. == Business career == In March 1981, shortly after graduating, Modi married Parul Kothari, who was born and raised in Zimbabwe. They went to Zimbabwe in September of the same year to visit his wife's country. It was supposed to be a short visit—he arrived with only $50, two pairs of clothes, and a return ticket—but when his father-in-law died unexpectedly, the couple ended up staying to support Parul's mother. The loan for his plane tickets, which cost $300 and were funded by an Indian religious organization in Bulawayo, needed to be refunded, so he found work and made payments of $20 each month. His first job in Zimbabwe was at a department store in Bulawayo, where he was tasked with sweeping, mopping, cleaning windows and toilets, and delivering goods to customers' homes. Modi described his first six months in Zimbabwe as difficult. There were many cultural differences, and all his friends and family—except his wife and mother-in-law—were in India. However, he soon adjusted and became comfortable living in Zimbabwe, and eventually acquired citizenship in 1987. After eight months at the department store, Modi began working at a supermarket, where he would remain for eight years. He would walk to and from work to save up money. After six years, he pooled funds with his wife and mother-in-law and opened his own shop, Bellevue Superette. Modi continued working at the supermarket to support the household, while his wife ran the shop and worked a second job to meet the costs of growing the business. Two years later, he quit his job at the supermarket to run the shop so Parul could stay home and care for her mother, who had cancer. The Superette, which began as a tuck shop with a staff of two, grew under his direction, and in 1999, he established his first supermarket, the Bellevue Spar. He eventually opened twelve supermarkets in total, before selling his company, Sai Enterprises, to Choppies, a Botswana-based multinational grocery retailer, in 2013. He has since opened a number of new supermarkets in Zimbabwe, and owns three others in Australia. After selling his supermarkets, Modi opened a liquor wholesale business, Liquor Hub, which he continues to run. His company Pintail Trading, manufactures its own alcoholic beverages, including whisky, and is also a PepsiCo product distributor. His recent projects in 2018 included manufacturing facilities that produce alcoholic beverages, bottled water, and exercise books. In 2020, his business ventures in development included a solar energy equipment factory, a smartphone and laptop assembly plant, and a shopping complex in Bulawayo's Cowdray Park suburb, which together would employ around 1,000 people. In addition to his businesses, Modi runs the Modi Family Trust, which provides capital to small startup businesses. In 2018, he donated $40,000 to renovate the squalid Sidojiwe hostel complex in Bulawayo. He has served as chief executive officer of the Bulawayo and Matabeleland sports and recreation commissions, as a member of the Bulawayo Publicity Association finance committee, and as general manager for Bulawayo of the Zimbabwe Youth Games. He funds most of the Bulawayo teams that participate in the youth games and the Paralympic Games. Modi has won dozens of awards for his business and philanthropic activities. == Political career == Modi was the only successful ZANU–PF parliamentary candidate in Bulawayo (bottom left, in green) in the 2018 Zimbabwean general election. Modi joined the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF) party in 2002 or 2003. In 2014, he was elected secretary for indigenisation for the party's Bulawayo city district executive. He was elected ward secretary for production and labour in 2018, and later rose to become ZANU–PF provincial secretary of finance for Bulawayo. Amid the factionalism within ZANU–PF that led to the 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'état, Modi was seen as an ally of Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa. In May 2018, Modi won the primary to represent ZANU–PF in the 2018 parliamentary election in the Bulawayo South constituency, defeating six other candidates. In the general election, held on 30 July 2018, Modi won with 40 percent of the vote in a field of sixteen candidates. He was the only successful ZANU–PF candidate in Bulawayo, whose other eleven constituencies were won by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance. He was the party's first winning candidate since 2000 in a Bulawayo parliamentary election not boycotted by the MDC. His victory was helped by the fact that two candidates, Muvirimi Francis Mangwendeza and Kunashe Muchemwa, ran on the MDC Alliance ticket, splitting the opposition vote. Mangwendeza and Muchemwa polled 4,155 and 2,249 votes, respectively, while Modi received 5,752. Modi attributed his victory to his local reputation for philanthropy. After the election, the second place candidate, Mangwendeza, challenged the results, alleging that his name was absent from some of the ballots, and that the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission had published a statement incorrectly listing his name among candidates who had withdrawn from the race. Mangwendeza sought a court order nullifying the results and declaring the seat vacant, but a Bulawayo High Court judge upheld Modi's victory in a May 2019 ruling. Modi was sworn in to Parliament on 5 September 2018, becoming the first Indian MP in Zimbabwe's history. On 7 September 2018, President Emmerson Mnangagwa appointed Modi deputy minister of industry and commerce in his new cabinet. Besides South Africa's Pravin Gordhan, this made him the only government minister of Indian origin in any African country. Modi announced that he would donate his government salary—for a deputy minister, around $3,000 a month—to Bulawayo charities. After being named deputy minister, Modi requested that he be allowed to work from Bulawayo instead of the capital, Harare. Mangaliso Ndlovu, under whom Modi initially served, was succeeded as industry and commerce minister by Sekai Nzenza in November 2019. In October 2018, Modi was criticized for continuing to sell goods in US dollars rather than Zimbabwean bond notes at his businesses, which was against government policy. He defended this decision as being necessary for the business to remain open, adding, \\"I am not the only one who is charging in US dollars; everybody is doing that.\\" He was also accused of illegally trading in foreign currency on the parallel market, a charge he strongly denied. In reference to Modi's position as deputy minister, the United Kingdom-based academic Alex Magaisa tweeted, \\"How do you enforce a government policy when you are breaching it?\\" From December 2019 to January 2020, Modi visited India on a month-long trip to attract Gujarati investors to Zimbabwe. In particular, he pitched opportunities in the sectors of mining, energy, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and tourism, among others. He returned with proposals from several potential investors, and a business delegation planning to visit the following month. While there, he also met with Vijay Rupani, the Chief Minister of Gujarat, and invited him to visit Zimbabwe with a business delegation. Rupani expressed interest in projects related to energy production, and arranged for a group from the Indian Ministry of Education to visit Zimbabwe in February 2020. == Personal life == Modi lives in a townhouse in the Hume Park suburb of Bulawayo. With his wife Parul, he has three children and three grandchildren. His father died in 1985 and his mother in 1988, but he still has brothers and sisters in India. He visits them regularly and they also visit him in Zimbabwe. He speaks English, Gujarati, Hindi, and a basic level of Ndebele. Modi prefers wearing casual clothing over suits, and eats in his company's cafeteria. He typically works seven days a week, waking at 7 in the morning and going to sleep at ten at night. When he is not working, he spends time with his wife, children, and grandchildren, and occasionally plays golf and cricket. He is a fan of the Highlanders, a Bulawayo football club. He likes Indian food and enjoys whisky, especially Jameson. == See also == * Indians in Zimbabwe * List of members of the 9th Parliament of Zimbabwe == References == Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century businesspeople Category:21st-century businesspeople Category:21st-century Zimbabwean politicians Category:Businesspeople in the drink industry Category:Government ministers of Zimbabwe Category:Gujarati people Category:Food and drink company founders Category:Indian emigrants to Zimbabwe Category:Manufacturing businesspeople Category:Members of the National Assembly of Zimbabwe Category:People from Bulawayo Category:People from Narmada district Category:People with acquired Zimbabwean citizenship Category:Retail company founders Category:ZANU–PF politicians Category:Zimbabwean businesspeople Category:Zimbabwean people of Indian descent ","title":"Raj Modi"},{"id":"63911463","text":"Shah-e-Jahan Chowdhury is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the former Member of Parliament of Chittagong-15. ==Career== Chowdhury was elected to parliament from Chittagong-15 as a Bangladesh Awami League candidate in 1973. ==References== Category:Awami League politicians Category:Living people Category:1st Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Shah-e-Jahan Chowdhury"},{"id":"63911493","text":"With the success with Fox Broadcasting Company, several other companies started to enter the fray in the 1990s to become the fifth commercial broadcast network that would allow a station to brand itself better and to stand out amongst the increasing number of channels particularly cable. Chris- Craft Industries and Warner Bros. Television Distribution (syndication arm) jointly launched the Prime Time Entertainment Network in September 1993, a consortium created in attempt at creating a new \\"fifth network.\\" PTEN, Spelling Premiere Network, Family Network and the proposed WB Network & Paramount Network were being shopped in January 1994 against syndicated blocks Disney Afternoon and Universal's \\"Action Pack.\\" Spelling Premiere Network had launched in August 1994. All American Television considered launching a first- run movie network with 22 movies as of November 1994. Chris-Craft subsidiary United Television then partnered with Paramount (by then recently merged with Viacom) to create the United Paramount Network (UPN), which launched in January 1995. Warner Bros. parent Time Warner then formed a partnership with the Tribune Company to create The WB, which also launched less than a week after UPN made its debut. Concurrently, United left PTEN's parent, the Prime Time Consortium, to focus on UPN, leaving PTEN as primarily a syndicator of its remaining programs; the service shared affiliations with its respective parents' own network ventures (in some cases, resulting in PTEN's programming airing in off-peak time slots) until it finally folded in September 1997. ==1990s== Controversial from the very beginning, the fin-syn rule was relaxed slightly during the 1980s. Following the severe changes in the television landscape, such as the rise of the Fox network and cable television, the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules were abolished completely in 1993. It was the repeal of fin-syn that ultimately made newer broadcast networks such as UPN and The WB financially interesting for their highly vertically integrated parent media conglomerates Paramount Pictures (Viacom) and Time Warner, respectively. On November 2, 1993, Time Warner announced the formation of The WB Television Network, a venture developed in partnership with the Tribune Company (which, prior to acquiring an 11% interest in August 1995, was a non-equity partner in the new network) and former Fox network executive Jamie Kellner (who would serve as the original president of and would hold a minority ownership stake in The WB). Tribune committed six of the seven independent stations it owned at the time to serve as charter affiliates of the network, though it initially exempted the WGN-TV Chicago signal from the agreement, as station management had expressed concerns about how the network's plans to expand its prime time and daytime program offerings would affect WGN's sports broadcast rights and the impact that the potential of having to phase them out to fulfill network commitments would have on the superstation feed's appeal to cable and satellite providers elsewhere around the United States. Tribune would reverse course on December 3, 1993, reaching a separate agreement with Time Warner to allow WGN-TV to become The WB's charter affiliate for the Chicago market and allow the WGN superstation feed to serve as a de facto national network feed intended for American media markets that did not initially have a local affiliate; this would bide The WB enough time to fill remaining gaps in affiliate coverage in \\"white area\\" regions that lacked a standalone independent station following its launch. In exchange, Time Warner agreed to reduce the network's initial program offerings to one night per week (from two) in order to limit conflicts with WGN's sports programming. The superstation feed, which reached 37% of the country by that time, would extend the network's initial coverage to 73% of all U.S. households that had at least one television set. ===1995=== In January 1995, Tribune Broadcasting became a partner in The WB Television Network, in a joint venture with the Warner Bros. Television division of Time Warner.Tribune Broadcasting Joins with Warner Bros. to Launch Fifth Television Network, TheFreeLibrary.com. Retrieved 12-10-2010. Tribune initially had a 12.5% ownership interest in the network at its launch and later increased its stake to 22%. In addition, partly as a result of a November 1993 affiliation deal with the network, most of Tribune's television properties were WB affiliates. On July 2, 1996, Tribune acquired Renaissance Broadcasting, which owned Fox- and WB-affiliated stations in several large and mid-sized markets.Tribune Co. Looks to Boost Role in TV with Offer for Six Stations, Los Angeles Daily News, July 2, 1996. Retrieved July 20, 2013 from HighBeam Research. The WGN-TV local and superstation feeds became charter affiliates of The WB when the network launched on January 11, 1995. (In the case of the Chicago signal, this marked the first time that WGN-TV was affiliated with a major broadcast network since DuMont ceased operations in August 1956.) The WGN cable agreement resulted in The WB becoming the second American broadcast television network to distribute its programming directly to a cable-originated service to provide extended coverage in designated \\"white areas\\" without broadcast affiliate clearances and one of three network-to-cable undertakings stewarded by Jamie Kellner. As The WB was under development, Kellner was in process of developing The WeB, a proposed national WB cable feed for smaller markets based upon a service that he launched as President of the Fox Broadcasting Company, Foxnet, which operated from June 1991 until September 2006. The use of WGN as a national relay feed gave The WB an early advantage over the United Paramount Network (UPN) – another fledgling network that made its national debut on January 16, 1995, as a joint venture between Chris-Craft/United Television and Paramount Television – which declined to allow the WWOR EMI Service to act as its national conduit in spite of similar initial gaps in UPN's broadcast affiliate coverage. The WGN superstation feed accounted for roughly 18% of the national coverage that The WB had at launch, with the rest of the network's initial 62% total reach coming from the 60 broadcast affiliates (including WGN-TV) that were willing to adhere to its reverse compensation plan for prospective affiliates. In some areas where cable systems did not carry the superstation feed and maintenance of a local WB affiliate was not yet possible, satellite distribution was the only method in which viewers could see the network's programming over WGN. (The WGN national feed served as the default WB affiliate for residents in 152 markets and the entirety of 21 U.S. states—Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming—at varying periods of time up through the launch of The WeB.) United Video intended to provide an alternate feed of WGN with substitute programming for markets that had a WB-affiliated station; however, no such measure was taken, creating network duplication in markets where over-the-air WB affiliates were forced to compete with the WGN cable feed. The WGN superstation feed carried The WB's prime time lineup from the start of the network's operations, and added the Kids' WB children's programming block when it was launched by the network on September 11, 1995. Conversely, in the Chicago market, WGN-TV chose to only air the network's prime time lineup, and exercised a right of first refusal to decline Kids' WB in order to offer a local morning newscast and an afternoon block of syndicated sitcoms aimed at a family audience on weekdays and a mix of locally produced news, public affairs and children's programs as well as paid programs on weekend mornings; this cleared the way for Weigel Broadcasting to cut a separate deal to air Kids' WB programs locally over group flagship WCIU-TV (channel 26, now a CW affiliate), an independent station that ran the block Monday through Saturdays from September 1995 until WGN-TV began clearing the block on its schedule in September 2004. As The WB's initial program offerings ran on Wednesdays for its first nine months of operation and would not expand its prime time schedule to six nights a week until September 1999, the superstation feed filled the 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time slot on nights without WB network programming with either sports telecasts from WGN-TV that were cleared for national broadcast – which, as The WB expanded its programming to other nights over a four-year period beginning with the September 1995 launch of its Sunday lineup, would result in pre-emptions of the network's programs until later in the week – or, as with most over-the-air WB affiliates during the network's early years, theatrical feature films acquired via the syndication market. *The Wayans Bros. aired from January 11, 1995, to May 20, 1999. It was the first of the four sitcoms that aired as part of the original Wednesday night two hour lineup that helped launch the network (along with Unhappily Ever After, The Parent 'Hood and the short-lived Muscle). While in development, the series' working title was initially supposed to have been Brother to Brother, before the name of the series changed to The Wayans Bros.It's comedy for WB Network, Broadcasting & Cable (via HighBeam Research), August 15, 1994. The series was cancelled in 1999 due to declining ratings and was not given a proper finale. *The Parent 'Hood aired from January 18, 1995, to July 25, 1999. The series starred Robert Townsend and Suzzanne Douglas. Originally to be titled Father Knows Nothing (a parody of the title of the 1950s sitcom Father Knows Best), the series was one of the four sitcoms that aired as part of the original Wednesday-night two-hour lineup that helped launch The WB network (along with The Wayans Bros., Unhappily Ever After, and the short- lived Muscle).Robert Townsend Gives Positive View Of Black Family On The Parent 'Hood - JET Magazine - January 29, 1996 *Unhappily Ever After aired for 100 episodes from January 11, 1995, to May 23, 1999, for a total of five seasons. Unhappily Ever After was one of the four sitcoms that aired as part of the original Wednesday night two-hour lineup that helped launch The WB network (along with The Wayans Bros., The Parent 'Hood and the short-lived Muscle). *Muscle aired from January 11 to May 24, 1995. Muscle was one of the four sitcoms that aired as part of the original Wednesday night two-hour WB lineup, at 9:30/8:30c (with The Wayans Bros., The Parent 'Hood, and Unhappily Ever After being scheduled before it). It was the only one of the four that did not make it past the first season, and was also the first series to get canceled on the brand new WB. Like its inspiration, ABC's Soap from the 1970s, it ended on an unresolved cliffhanger after being canceled due to low ratings. *Sister, Sister was picked up by ABC as a midseason replacement and debuted on April 1, 1994, as part of the network's TGIF comedy lineup. The show later moved to a new timeslot for the 1994–95 season, but ABC announced that it was cancelling the program due to low ratings and its final episode aired April 28, 1995. The WB, which was still in its infancy in 1995, picked up Sister, Sister to replace the cancelled Muscle on its Wednesday night lineup of shows and the third season debuted on September 6, 1995. The program found its niche as part of The WB's lineup and aired for four additional seasons on the network, with the final episode airing on May 23, 1999. After being picked up by The WB in 1995, reruns of the first two seasons of Sister, Sister were broadcast in early primetime as part of the network's then-newly launched Sunday night lineup during the 1995–1996 season, in addition to the first-run episodes of the series that aired on the WB's Wednesday night schedule. ===1996=== This is the first fall season for The WB and UPN. The schedules of either network would not be constant until fall 1999, when the WB decided to air shows from Sunday through Friday and UPN would air Monday through Friday. *Kirk aired from August 23, 1995, to January 12, 1997. Kirk was one of only two series produced by Bickley-Warren Productions and Jeff Franklin Productions that was not produced by Miller-Boyett Productions (the other being Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, which William Bickley and Michael Warren served as showrunners/executive producers during that series' final three seasons). During the development stage, the series originally went under the working title Life Happens,Kids will be kids (new television networks United Paramount Network and Warner Bros. Network), Newsweek (via Questia Online Library), July 3, 1995. and was originally conceived as a series for ABC (who had broadcast other series produced by Bickley and Warren, and their production partners Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett) before the network's decision to move away from family sitcoms, just prior to the network's 1995 purchase by The Walt Disney Company.Kirk Cameron's New Series is Family Fare, The Columbian, (via HighBeam Research), August 20, 1995. *On September 9, 1995, Pinky and the Brain were spun off onto their own half-hour series on Kids' WB!, with each episode consisting of one or more segments, including some of the segments from Animaniacs. The first season was scheduled in a prime time slot from September 10, 1995, through July 21, 1996, as part of the new WB network lineup, with episodes also being repeated within the Saturday morning cartoon block. It had been envisioned for the cartoon to be WB network's answer to The Simpsons, at that point in its 7th season, which was running on the FOX network. The series tended to have more jokes and humor aimed at adults rather than children. Due to poor ratings following the first season, primarily due to running against 60 Minutes, subsequent seasons were moved to Saturday mornings as part of the Kids' WB! programming block. *Simon aired from September 10, 1995, to February 25, 1996. *Cleghorne! aired from September 10 to December 17, 1995. The series was put on hiatus by The WB after December 1995, having aired just 12 episodes; the show was later cancelled with three episodes left unaired. *First Time Out premiered on September 10, 1995, and last aired an original episode on December 17, 1995, after which it was put on hiatus by The WB, leaving four episodes unaired. *Savannahs first season was broadcast between January 21, 1996 and April 7, 1996. The first two episodes were shown together as a two-hour Saturday \\"sneak preview\\" of the upcoming series, with the remaining season one episodes shown on Sunday nights (The WB dubbing the evening \\"Savannah Sunday\\".). The show was the most successful program on The WB at the time. During its second season, Savannah was moved to Monday nights, the 22 second-season episodes broadcast between August 26, 1996 and February 24, 1997 at 9:00 pm following 7th Heaven. It was cancelled at the end of the season. Garth Ancier, president of the WB's entertainment division, attributed its cancellation to the fact that \\"serial dramas don't repeat well, making the investment too expensive\\". Its mid season replacement would be the eventual cult classic Buffy the Vampire Slayer, created by a then unknown Joss Whedon, which would run for seven seasons, becoming a global phenomenon and spawning a multimedia franchise known as the Buffyverse *Brotherly Love ran from September 16, 1995, to April 1, 1996, on NBC, and then moved to The WB, where it aired from September 15, 1996, until May 18, 1997. ===1997=== *Nick Freno: Licensed Teacher aired from August 28, 1996 until May 3, 1998. The series was created and executive produced by Dennis Rinsler and Marc Warren who drew on their own experiences as former teachers in New York City. They based the title character on their elementary school music teacher and friend, John Freno. *The Steve Harvey Show aired from August 25, 1996 to February 17, 2002. In 2001, Harvey decided to pursue other projects. He wished to end the show after the fifth season, but at the insistence of the WB network, reluctantly filmed a 13-episode sixth season. *Life with Roger aired from September 8, 1996 to March 30, 1997, airing twenty episodes, before being canceled in March 1997 due to low ratings. *7th Heaven debuted on August 26, 1996, on The WB, where it aired for ten seasons. Following the shutdown of The WB and its merger with UPN to form The CW, the series aired on the new network on September 25, 2006, for its eleventh and final season, airing its final episode on May 13, 2007. 7th Heaven was the last series to be produced by Spelling Television (later produced by CBS Paramount Network Television for the eleventh and final season) before it was shut down and became an in-name- only unit of CBS Television Studios. Although originally produced for Fox in 1996, the show aired on the WB. It was produced by Spelling Television and distributed for syndication by CBS Television Distribution. Its producers, including Aaron Spelling, considered it wholesome family viewing, incorporating public service announcements into the show. The final season of 7th Heaven was shown on the inaugural season of The CW. The show wrapped production on the final episode March 8, 2007, about one month before most shows film their last episodes of the season. This was due largely to the fact that after ten years of working together, the actors, producers and crew had gotten production down to a steady pace, slashing costs repeatedly and routinely coming in well under budget. This resulted in 7th Heaven filming episodes in shorter time during the final seasons. After much deliberation within the now-defunct WB network, it was made public in November 2005 that the tenth season would be the program's final season because of high costs, which were revealed to be due to a poorly negotiated licensing agreement by the WB network a few years earlier. The program's future was hanging in the balance and it was entirely in the hands of the newly established CW network whether to renew it for an eleventh seasonal run. In March 2006, the main cast of characters were approached about the possibility of returning for an eleventh season. After further consideration by the CW network, it was decided three days after the airing of its \\"series finale\\", that 7th Heaven would be picked up for an eleventh season, which would air on their network in the Monday-night slot that had helped make it famous. Originally the show was renewed for thirteen episodes, but on September 18, 2006, the renewal was extended to a full twenty-two episodes. Along with the show's unexpected and last-minute renewal came some changes. The show's already-low budget was moderately trimmed, forcing cuts in the salaries of some cast members and shortened taping schedules (seven days per episode instead of the typical eight). David Gallagher, who played Simon, chose not to return as a regular. Furthermore, Mackenzie Rosman, who played youngest daughter Ruthie, did not appear in the first six episodes. Catherine Hicks missed three episodes in Season 11, as another cost-cutting move. Additionally, George Stults was absent for a few episodes at the beginning of season 11. Also, after airing Monday nights at 8/7c for ten seasons, plus the first two episodes of season 11, the CW unexpectedly moved 7th Heaven to Sunday nights as of October 15, 2006. The Sunday/Monday lineup swap was attributed to mediocre ratings of shows on both nights. While 7th Heaven did improve in numbers over the CW's previous Sunday night programming, it never quite hit its Monday-night momentum again. 7th Heaven was the most watched TV series ever on the WB. It holds the record for the WB's most watched hour at 12.5 million viewers, on February 8, 1999; 19 of the WB's 20 most watched hours were from 7th Heaven. On May 8, 2006, it was watched by 7.56 million viewers, the highest rating for the WB since January 2005. When the show moved to the CW, ratings dropped. Possible reasons for the decline include an aired \\"Countdown to Goodbye\\" ad campaign for the last six months of the 2005–06 season, which promoted it as the final season ever; though the CW announced the series' unexpected renewal, it didn't promote the new season strongly via billboards, bus stops, magazine or on-air promos. Lastly, the network moved 7th Heaven from its long- established Monday night slot to Sunday nights, causing ratings to drop further. The series had a season average of just 3.3 million on the new network, losing 36% of the previous year's audience. It was the third most watched scripted show on the CW. Overall, it was the seventh most watched show. *Smart Guy ran for three seasons from April 2, 1997 to May 16, 1999. The series was produced by de Passe Entertainment and Danny Kallis Productions, in association with Walt Disney Television. *The Jamie Foxx Show aired from August 28, 1996, to January 14, 2001. The series stars Jamie Foxx, Garcelle Beauvais, Christopher B. Duncan, Ellia English, and Garrett Morris. Although the show was not a major success with the ratings due to The WB being a relatively new network, the show did help launch Foxx's acting career while also relaunching Morris' career after his 1994 shooting. It also served as a launch pad for Beauvais who would go on to star in ABC's NYPD Blue. ===1998=== *The Tom Show aired on Sunday nights from September 7, 1997 to February 22, 1998. *Kelly Kelly aired from April 20 to June 7, 1998. Columbia TriStar Television had originally developed the series, and produced a pilot, before handing over production of the show to Warner Bros. Television. During filming of the first episode, Shelley Long broke a finger while catching a football. After airing two episodes to low ratings, The WB moved the series from Mondays to Sundays. Seven episodes are registered with the United States Copyright Office. *Alright Already aired from September 7, 1997, to May 4, 1998. *You're the One aired from April 19 until May 3, 1998. *Three aired from February 2 to March 23, 1998. *Dawson's Creek was created by Kevin Williamson and debuted on The WB on January 20, 1998. It was produced by Columbia TriStar Television (renamed Sony Pictures Television before the sixth and final season) and was filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina. The series ended on May 14, 2003. Following the selling of his spec script for Wes Craven-directed Scream (1996), film assistant Kevin Williamson was taking several meetings with film and television producers before the slasher film began production. In what would be his first television meeting, Williamson met executive Paul Stupin and, when asked if he had ideas for a television production, Williamson came up with the idea of a teen series based on his youth growing up near a North Carolina creek as an aspiring filmmaker who worshipped director Steven Spielberg. Stupin liked his idea and asked him to come back the next day and pitch it to Columbia TriStar Television studios, prompting Williamson to write a 20-page outline for Dawson's Creek that night. Williamson pitched the show \\"as Some Kind of Wonderful, meets Pump Up the Volume, meets James at 15, meets My So-Called Life, meets Little House on the Prairie\\", also taking inspiration from teen drama Beverly Hills, 90210 as he \\"wanted it to speak to the teenage audience of the day.\\" When Columbia requested him to relocate the show to Boston, Massachusetts, he settled with fictional Capeside, and pitched it to Fox. However, commissioned amid the struggling of Party of Five, Fox wondered if they needed another teen drama, and while they were supportive of Williamson's scripts, they eventually passed on it. Left unused, Columbia TriStar sent his scripts to newly founded The WB network who was looking for fresh ideas for their programme after launching supernatural drama series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Williamson went for a meeting with then-chief programmer Garth Ancier and entertainment president Susanne Daniels who loved his script and picked it up for the network's new Tuesday night lineup. Procter & Gamble Productions joined in as an original co-producer of the series, however, sold its interest in the show three months before the premiere when printed stories surfaced about the racy dialogue and risqué plot lines. While never a huge ratings success among the general television population, Dawson's Creek did very well with the younger demographic it targeted and became a defining show for the WB Network. The pilot episode was watched by 6.8 million viewers and had a 4.8 rating which was the network's highest rating at the time. The first season's highest ranked episode was the finale, which was fifty-ninth, while the second highest rated was the second episode (probably scoring so well partially because the other major networks carried President Clinton's State of the Union address in the midst of the Lewinsky scandal rather than their regular programming). The finale itself was watched by 7.8 million U.S. viewers, which was its largest audience ever. *Invasion America is a 1998 American animated science fiction miniseries that aired in the prime time lineup on The WB. Produced by DreamWorks Animation (then part of DreamWorks proper, now owned by Universal Studios), the series was created by Steven Spielberg and Harve Bennett, who also served as executive producers. The show received a mixed reception from critics. Howard Rosenberg of The Los Angeles Times gave the show a largely negative review, criticizing the writing and \\"thin plot\\". Anita Gates of The New York Times noted that the animation was \\"impressive\\", but at the same time that \\"there's no heart in it\\". The Sun Sentinel wrote that the cartoon leaves viewers bored, while in a mostly positive review Entertainment Weekly stated \\"Invasion is at least as involving as any of the current variations on Star Trek, and handsomer to look at than all of them. B+\\" ===1999=== Into the late 1990s, The WB began to expand its local broadcast coverage in American media markets that had to rely on the WGN national feed to receive the network's programming through affiliation agreements signed with local broadcast stations (including UPN charter affiliates, leftover independents, former noncommercial stations adopting an entertainment format, and dual affiliations with stations already affiliated with other networks [such as UPN]) within the top-100 media markets after its launch; coverage in the 110 smallest markets was achieved through the September 1998 launch of The WeB (subsequently renamed The WB 100+ Station Group), a packaged feed of WB network and syndicated programs provided to participating cable-based affiliates. With local availability becoming less of an issue and with exclusivity protections being granted by the network to its affiliates in certain markets by this time, on January 27, 1999, Time Warner and Tribune mutually agreed to cease the stopgap WB programming relay over the WGN superstation feed effective that fall. On October 6, when the WGN superstation feed formally stopped carrying WB network programming, Kids' WB programming on weekday mornings and afternoons and on Sunday mornings was replaced with syndicated series, while feature films replaced The WB's prime time programs, resulting in the superstation's schedule more so resembling an independent station than a general entertainment cable network due to the presence of local programming from WGN-TV. The removal of WB programming from the superstation feed reduced The WB's potential audience by 10 million households, and was cited as the reason behind the network's season-to-season ratings decline during the 1999–2000 season, which saw The WB lose an estimated 19% of its household audience as a consequence of the decision and fall to sixth place (behind UPN) in the Nielsen ratings. For similar reasons to those that necessitated the decision to remove WB programming from the channel, WGN America also did not carry any programming from The CW when WGN- TV became its Chicago charter affiliate when that network launched in September 2006, due to the fact that The CW is widely available throughout the United States via over-the-air broadcast stations and affiliations with digital subchannels and local cable outlets (including through The CW Plus in smaller markets) when that network launched in September 2006. *Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane premiered from January 17, 1999 and ended on June 11, 2000. During development, the show was initially known as Zoe Bean and was later retitled Zoe... during its second season. The series aired a total of 26 episodes over its two seasons. The series centered on four eccentric high school friends in New York City. The foursome attended (fictional) Fielding- Mellish Prep, which gets its name from Woody Allen's character in the movie Bananas. The show also starred Mary Page Keller as Zoe's single mother Iris during the first season. Scott Foley, fresh from Dawson's Creek, appeared in the pilot with the intention of having him star in the series as Zoe's love interest. But once the pilot finally got picked up, Foley had already moved on to Felicity. When the show returned for a second season, it had been heavily retooled. The friendship between the four friends remained intact, but now they were adult college students. Gone was Keller as Zoe's mom, while Omar Gooding joined the cast as the foursome's friend Doug Anderson. The title had also been shortened to simply Zoe... (pronounced on-air as Zoe Dot Dot Dot) out of fear that the former title was turning off potential viewers. After the series was cancelled, Michael Rosenbaum expressed disappointment with the fact that the network had cut his character's name out of the title for the second season. *Movie Stars aired from 1999 to 2000. It stars Harry Hamlin and Jennifer Grant as famous Hollywood actors trying to raise their children. *The Army Show was first shown on September 13 and ended its run on December 13, 1998. The plot follows an army sergeant, played by David Anthony Higgins, who must take charge of a group of soldiers at Fort Bendix, Florida, while hiding his profitable schemes from his higher class officers. *Hyperion Bay ran for one season from September 21, 1998 to March 8, 1999. According to series writer and co-producer Jeffrey Stepakoff, early into Hyperion Bay's run the network told producers to make the show more hip and with a quicker pace. When series producer and creator Joseph Dougherty refused, he was fired by Warner Bros, and former Melrose Place producer Frank South was brought in to retool the series. Carmen Electra was added to the cast as Sarah Hicks, a character modeled after Heather Locklear's character, Amanda Woodward, on Melrose Place. The changes did not improve ratings and The WB canceled Hyperion Bay in February 1999, with the last episodes airing in March 1999. *Rescue 77 was created by Gregory Widen and aired from March 15 to May 3, 1999, during Monday nights on The WB network. The creator and executive producer was Gregory Widen, a former Southern California firefighter and paramedic, and the writer of the 1991 firefighting drama Backdraft. His goal for the show was to provide a more realistic depiction of the lives of firefighters and paramedics than previous emergency medical television series such as Emergency! *For Your Love premiered on March 17, 1998, on NBC. The series starred Holly Robinson Peete and James Lesure. It was canceled by NBC after six episodes but was picked up by The WB. It ran for a total of four-and-a-half seasons, with its last episode airing on August 11, 2002. *Felicity ran for four seasons from September 29, 1998, to May 22, 2002, with each season corresponding to the traditional American university divisions of freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years. In 1999, a publicly hyped young writer for the show, Riley Weston, was disclosed as a fraud for claiming to be much younger than she truly was. At the age of 32, she began marketing herself to television studios as a recent high school graduate, passing off her husband as her older brother. She was soon hired by the WB Network as a writer for Felicity. Hailed as a child prodigy and \\"wunderkind\\", she was featured on Entertainment Weeklys October 1998 list of the \\"100 Most Creative People in Entertainment\\", which described her as an up-and-coming 19-year-old. Shortly thereafter, she was offered a six-figure screenwriting deal with Disney. Her real identity and age were exposed after a Felicity producer checked her social security number. Soon afterward, her contract with WB expired and was not renewed, and her deal with Disney fell through. In the summer of 1999, after filming the first season, Felicity star Keri Russell—known for what The New York Times described as \\"[t]hat glorious head of voluminous golden backlit hair\\"—sent the show's producers a photo wearing a short-haired wig. They panicked before learning that it was a joke but then suggested to the actress that a new hairstyle would be appropriate. After being shifted from Tuesday nights at 9:00 PM Eastern to Sunday nights at 8:00 PM Eastern (WB's weakest night) for the 1999–2000 season, the ratings for Felicity declined immediately. This decline occurred before the hair-style change, but the later hair-style change became conflated by some of the public and by some of the popular press and network executives with this earlier event and thus incorrectly blamed the earlier ratings drop partly on the later new hairstyle. After the negative reaction Russell rejected wearing extensions or a wig while her hair grew back. Although storytelling and time-slot changes had already created a ratings decline, a network executive said WB actors' future hair changes would \\"be given more thought at the network than it previously would have\\". In 2010, TV Guide Network listed the hairstyle change at No. 19 on their list of \\"25 Biggest TV Blunders,\\" with several commentators arguing that it was the reason that the ratings of the show dropped. The haircut incident went on to become a popular culture reference within other television shows, both comedic and dramatic. Despite the controversy, Felicity survived for two more seasons. *Charmed was originally broadcast for eight seasons from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006. Charmed achieved a cult following and popularity on The WB with its first episode \\"Something Wicca This Way Comes\\" garnering 7.7 million viewers, breaking the record for the network's highest-rated debut episode. The show's ratings, although smaller than rival shows on the \\"big four\\" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB network. Charmed went through several timeslot changes during its eight-season run. For its first three seasons in the Wednesday/Thursday 9:00 pm timeslot, Charmed was the second-highest rated series on The WB, behind 7th Heaven. During its fifth season, the show moved to the Sunday 8:00 pm timeslot, where it became the highest-rated Sunday night program in The WB's history. At 178 episodes, Charmed was the second-longest drama broadcast by The WB, behind 7th Heaven. In 2006, it became the longest running hour-long television series featuring all female leads, before being surpassed by Desperate Housewives in 2012. In 1998, when The WB began looking for a new drama series for the 1998–99 season, they approached Spelling Television (which had produced the network's then-most successful series, 7th Heaven) to create it. Expanding on the popularity of supernatural-themed dramas such as The Craft (1996) and Practical Magic (1998), the production company explored different forms of mythology to find characters they could realize with contemporary storytelling.\\"Genesis\\" Documentary, Charmed: The Complete Final Season Region 1 DVD Constance M. Burge was hired to create the series as she was under contract with 20th Century Fox and Spelling Television after conceiving the drama series Savannah (1996–97). When the theme of witchcraft was first pitched to her, she was aware of stereotypes of witches (flying brooms, black cats, and warts). After researching Wicca, she changed her perspective and aimed at telling a story of good witches who looked and acted like ordinary people. With this, her initial concept was a series set in Boston, Massachusetts about three friends and roommates who were all witches. However, executive producer E. Duke Vincent lacked confidence, asking \\"Why would anybody want to watch a show about three witches?\\" He proposed that the series should focus on family values and developed the series-long mantra of it being about \\"three sisters who happen to be witches, not three witches who happen to be sisters.\\" Spelling warmed to Burge's ideas and, after the concept was re-crafted to be a series about three sisters (now living in San Francisco) descended from a line of witches, it was pitched to The WB's President of Entertainment, Susanne Daniels, who liked it, allowing the series to begin development. The series was retitled Charmed after Spelling's suggestion of House of Sisters was dropped. Burge wrote the pilot script and a 28-minute version of the pilot was filmed (the \\"unaired pilot,\\" never aired on network television). After original cast member Lori Rom quit the series before its premiere, Alyssa Milano took over her role and a new pilot had to be filmed. Upon its debut, Charmed received the largest audience for a series premiere in The WB's history. The first season of 22 episodes was picked up by The WB after only two episodes had aired. During the seventh season and for the first time in its history, the show had been in limbo as there was no guaranteed renewal for an eighth season. Charmed was ultimately renewed for a final season, but the budget was cut considerably compared to previous seasons due to expensive special effects and props and highly-paid actresses. Executive producer Brad Kern revealed that they had to cut back on special effects and guest stars, and that the entire season was shot only on the Paramount Studios lot as they could not go out on location anymore. These budget cuts also led to cast member Dorian Gregory being written out of the final season and Brian Krause being written out of several episodes as a cost- saving measure. Kern revealed that the show could not afford to have Krause in all 22 episodes of the final season, but he was brought back for the final two episodes to help bring closure to the storylines.< In the United States, Charmed premiered on The WB on October 7, 1998 a month after Big Ticket Television's 2nd court show Judge Joe Brown premiered on September 14th of that year and ended on May 21, 2006. The first season aired on Wednesday nights at 9:00 pm. For its second, third and fourth seasons, Charmed moved to Thursday nights. For the fifth season, the series moved to Sunday nights at 8:00 pm and remained there until its eighth and final season. By the end of season eight, Charmed had aired a total of 178 episodes and became the longest running hour-long television series in American history, featuring all female leads. Most seasons consisted of 22 episodes, except for the fifth and sixth seasons, which contained 23 episodes, including their double-episode premieres and double-episode finales. ==2000s== ===2000=== *Safe Harbor aired from September 20 to November 28, 1999. The series was created and executive produced by Brenda Hampton, who at the time was best known for work on the fellow WB series 7th Heaven, the series was paired with 7th Heaven on the network's Monday night lineup. Despite 7th Heaven being the No. 1 show on The WB during the 1999-2000 season, Safe Harbor was unable to hold a solid audience after 7th Heaven and was canceled after ten episodes and one season with the show moving to Sunday nights where the last two episodes aired. *D.C. briefly ran in April 2–23, 2000 on The WB. *Jack & Jill ran from September 26, 1999 to April 15, 2001. Due to the average ratings of the first season, the second season was only 13 episodes long and was aired as a midseason show. The final episode detailed the problems during preparations for the couple's wedding. Jacqueline discovered she was pregnant, but before she could tell David, he decided that their relationship was moving too fast and he wanted to call the wedding off and move things slower. Despite the rallying of fans, the series was not renewed for a third season, so the series ended in a cliffhanger. *Mission Hill ran on The WB from September 24, 1999, to July 16, 2000, and on Adult Swim from July 14 to August 11, 2002. Although 18 episodes were planned, only 13 were produced. The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a cult following, thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on Teletoon's Teletoon Unleashed block; Cartoon Network's popular late-night programming block Adult Swim; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late-night programming block on TBS. Mission Hill was formerly known as The Downtowners, although MTV's production of the similarly titled Downtown forced a name change. *Brutally Normal premiered on January 24, 2000 with two back-to-back episodes later airing along with Zoe... A total of eight episodes were produced with only five of those episodes airing with the show being canceled on February 14, 2000. *Angel is a spin-off from the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The series was created by Buffys creator, Joss Whedon, in collaboration with David Greenwalt. It aired on The WB from October 5, 1999, to May 19, 2004, consisting of five seasons and 110 episodes. Like Buffy, it was produced by Whedon's production company, Mutant Enemy. On February 14, 2004, the WB Network announced that Angel would not be brought back for a sixth season. The one-paragraph statement indicated that the news, which had been reported by an Internet site the previous day, had been leaked well before the network intended to make its announcement.KJB, \\"Breaking News: Angel to End After 5 Seasons. Whedon talks about cancellation\\", IGN.com (February 13, 2004). Joss Whedon posted a message on a popular fan site, The Bronze: Beta, in which he expressed his dismay and surprise, saying he was \\"heartbroken\\"Whedon, Joss, Online post, Bronzebeta.com (February 14, 2004). Archived version. and described the situation as \\"Healthy Guy Falls Dead From a Heart Attack.\\"Jensen, Jeff The X Factor (May 21, 2004). Fan reaction was to organize letter-writing campaigns, online petitions, blood and food drives, advertisements in trade magazines and via mobile billboards, and attempts to lobby other networks (UPN was a favorite target, as it had already picked up Buffy). Outrage for the cancellation focused on Jordan Levin, WB's Head of Entertainment. It was the second highest-rated program to be canceled on the WB. Head writer David Fury \\"guaranteed\\" that if Joss Whedon had not requested an early renewal, Angel would have been back for a Season 6, saying Whedon's request for an early pick-up decision put Levin in a corner, forcing him to cancel the show, adding simply waiting would have gotten the show renewed. James Marsters made a similar statement, saying cancellation took the cast and production staff \\"completely by surprise\\". Angel's final episode, \\"Not Fade Away\\", aired on the WB on May 19, 2004. The ambiguous final moments left some fans hoping for the continuation of Angel and the Buffyverse in the future - hopes that came to fruition in November 2007 with the publication of the first issue of the comic book series Angel: After the Fall. The series is Joss Whedon's official continuation of the Angel television series and follows in the footsteps of the comic book Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight, whose first issue was published in March 2007. *Young Americans debuted on July 12, 2000 on The WB network as a summer replacement for, and spin-off from another Columbia TriStar Television production, Dawson's Creek. The series was originally ordered for the 1999–2000 television season with a planned fall debut, but was delayed due to unresolved matters between Columbia TriStar and The WB. The main character, Will Krudski, was introduced late in season three of Dawson's Creek as a childhood friend of the group who has kept in contact with Pacey Witter. Young Americans was originally supposed to be a mid-season show in 2000 but was put on hold until Coca-Cola offered to sponsor the show. The character of Will Krudski was then written into Dawson's Creek to associate Young Americans with one of The WB's established shows. When Dawson's Creek went on hiatus in the summer of 2000, Young Americans occupied its timeslot of Wednesdays at 9 P.M. Repeats were shown at 9 P.M. on Fridays. The Coca-Cola Company paid $6 million to be the primary sponsor, the show being billed as \\"Coca-Cola Presents Young Americans\\". Young Americans was profiled by Steve Carell on the August 22, 2000 episode of The Daily Show in the Ad Nauseam segment due to the Coca-Cola tie ins. Carell constantly referred to \\"The Beginning\\" as an \\"hour-long commercial\\". Some of the scenes also took place in a Friendly's restaurant, which was built from an old pizzeria for the show. Coca-Cola products are seen or mentioned in most episodes. The unaired pilot episode does not contain the product placement. Among the changes to the pilot is a scene that was reshot in order to show the characters drinking Coca-Cola. A scene from the pilot, which was heavily promoted prior to the show's premiere, where the characters and other students at Rawley run in slow motion to the school's lake while stripping off their clothes was parodied in another WB show, Grosse Pointe. *Popular was produced by Touchstone Television and ran for two seasons on The WB from September 29, 1999 to May 18, 2001. *The first eight episodes of Baby Blues originally aired in the United States on The WB between July 28 and August 24, 2000, before being cancelled. The five remaining episodes that had been unaired finally did air on Adult Swim in 2002. A second season consisting of thirteen episodes was produced but never aired. Warner Bros. Animation produced eight of the 13 aired episodes, with overseas animation done by Varga Studio in Hungary for five of them (including the pilot), and Sunwoo Entertainment in Korea for the three others. Rough Draft Studios in Los Angeles did five episodes, which include \\"Bizzy Moves In\\", \\"Rodney Has Two Daddies\\", \\"Hurtin' Inside\\", \\"Ugly Zoe\\", and \\"Wanda Moves Up\\". In another attempt to compete with Fox's popular animated sitcoms, The WB made the series to be more adult-oriented than the comic strip (by having some sexuality, mild swearing, etc.). Because Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott had limited creative control over the animated version, they were not completely pleased about this kind of difference, though Scott said he liked \\"part of it\\". The Baby Blues animated series took nearly five years to develop and produce, and what was initially the pilot, \\"A Baby Blues Christmas Special\\" was supposed to air in December 1998, but it was postponed more than once, while other episodes were being ordered and completed. The Christmas episode finally aired on Adult Swim on February 24, 2002. In 1999, the series was almost to be retitled Bluesville, without Scott's knowledge but Baby Blues was kept as the title, given how popular the comic strip is with more than 60 million readers. In September 2000, Warner Bros. announced that a second season would be produced. Although a second season was produced, consisting of 13 additional episodes, it never aired. The WB typically aired two episodes each week, thus enabling eight different episodes to be shown in the five-week run, but abandoned plans to air additional episodes which had been completed. Previously unaired episodes were later aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim, and on Teletoon in Canada. ===2001=== *The original run of The PJs debuted on Fox on Sunday, January 10, 1999, following the network's coverage of the NFC Divisional Playoffs. Two days later, the second episode aired in its regular Tuesday night time slot, following King of the Hill. 44 episodes aired during the show's run of 2 years and 4 months. Each took over 2 months to produce, owing to the laborious stop-motion process. After two seasons on Fox, the show moved to The WB in 2000. Its high budget and declining ratings led to its cancellation in 2001; the final 2 episodes weren't aired until 2003. *The Oblongs premiered on April 1, 2001 but failed to find an audience. On May 20, 2001, The WB aired \\"Disfigured Debbie,\\" the second episode produced, as the season finale, leaving five episodes unaired. Reruns of the first eight episodes, and the five remaining episodes, aired on Cartoon Network's late- night programming block, Adult Swim, in 2002. Reruns of the series continue to air intermittently on Adult Swim. In Canada, the series airs on Teletoon as part of \\"Teletoon Unleashed\\". A total of 13 episodes were produced. *Hype ran for 17 episodes from October 8, 2000 to February 18, 2001. The series was ordered by the WB after the trio wrote a sketch for MADtv which parodied Felicity, the network's major hit series at the time. On February 8, 2001 the series was canceled after one season,\\"Lack of Hype Kills Hype\\". TV Guide, February 8, 2001. although two of its cast members, Frank Caliendo and Daniele Gaither, subsequently joined MADtv, while Gavin Crawford has had success as a television comedian in Canada, including on The Gavin Crawford Show and This Hour Has 22 Minutes.\\"That's so Gavin and Mary\\". Jam!, February 20, 2002. *Nikki aired from October 9, 2000, to January 27, 2002. Nikki was a starring vehicle for Nikki Cox, who had previously starred in another WB sitcom, Unhappily Ever After, which ran for five seasons. Looking to capitalize on Cox's popularity, Bruce Helford created a sitcom that featured her as the title character. In July 1999, The WB placed a straight-to-order series from The Drew Carey Show co-creator Bruce Helford as a vehicle for Unhappily Ever After and Norm co-star Nikki Cox. Nikki was formally ordered to series in May 2000, and was placed on The WB's fall lineup for a Sunday Night comedy block. On October 31, 2000, The WB ordered a full 22-episode season of Nikki. The network renewed the show for a 22-episode second season at its upfronts in May 2001. However, in January 2002, the network pulled the series, and shut down production after only 19 episodes. Six episodes were left unaired in the United States. *Grosse Pointe aired from September 22, 2000 to February 18, 2001, during the 2000–2001 television season. Created by Darren Star, it was a satire depicting the behind-the-scenes drama on the set of a television show, and was inspired in large part by Star's experiences as the creator and producer of the nighttime soap Beverly Hills, 90210. Reportedly, Beverly Hills 90210 producer Aaron Spelling called WB executive Jamie Kellner to complain about Lindsay Sloane's character Marcy Sternfeld, who in the original pilot was a thinly veiled parody of Spelling's daughter, actress Tori Spelling. Grosse Pointe was on the WB's Friday line-up in between Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Popular. The show lost much of the lead-in audience, and was moved to Sundays (a joke in the episode \\"The Opposite of Sex\\" references this, as the fictional show garners its highest ratings ever but fails to \\"beat Sabrina\\"). Grosse Pointe was canceled in February 2001 after 17 episodes. *Gilmore Girls debuted on October 5, 2000, on The WB and became a flagship series for the network. Gilmore Girls originally ran for seven seasons, the final season moving to The CW and ending its run on May 15, 2007. Television critics praised Gilmore Girls for its witty dialogue, cross-generational appeal, and effective mix of humor and drama. It never drew large ratings but was a relative success for The WB, peaking during season five as the network's second most-popular show. The series has been in daily syndication since 2004, while a growing and dedicated fandom has led to its status as a cult classic. Since coming off the air, Gilmore Girls has been cited in TV (The Book) and Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time. Gilmore Girls first season commenced on The WB in the Thursday 8pm/7pm Central time slot, as a lead-in for Charmed. Renewed for a second season, the show was relocated to Tuesdays at 8pm/7pm, the time slot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which transferred to UPN, and served as a lead-in for Smallville, which became an instant hit and would always beat Gilmore Girls, its lead-in in the ratings. During seasons 4 and 5, it led into One Tree Hill, which slowly became a hit. In season 6, it led into Supernatural, which became another hit for The WB. First-season reruns aired on Monday nights from March 5 until April 9, 2001, during a mid-season hiatus of Roswell lead out of 7th Heaven to spread audience awareness. An additional run of the first season aired in 2002 on Sunday nights under the title Gilmore Girls Beginnings (which featured a modified opening sequence voiced with a monologue detailing the premise from Graham), and was one of two shows on The WB to give the Beginnings in its title for reruns, along with 7th Heaven. *Dead Last aired from August 14 to September 25, 2001. It starred Sara Downing as Jane Cahill, Tyler LabineThe New York Times The A.V. Club as Scotty Sallback, and Kett Turton as Vaughn Parrish. The series ran for one season with 13 episodes produced, but only six episodes were aired by The WB before the series was cancelled. *Sabrina the Teenage Witchs first four seasons aired on ABC from September 27, 1996, to May 5, 2000; the final three seasons ran on The WB from September 22, 2000, to April 24, 2003. During its four-year run on ABC, Sabrina was the highest-rated series among the network's TGIF line-up. In the 2000–2001 season, the show moved to The WB after a negotiation dispute with ABC. While ABC was willing to renew the show for a fifth season, the network was not willing to pay the reported $1.5 million per episode that Viacom Productions, which produced the show, wanted. The WB then picked up the show for a mere $675,000 per episode, but agreed to commit to 66 episodes. When viewership began to wane, the show was canceled after seven seasons. ===2002=== *Reruns of Ripley's Believe It or Not! began airing on The WB in September 2001, and were expected to continue until December 2001. *The Jamie Kennedy Experiment is a half-hour-long hidden camera/practical joke reality television series that debuted in 2002. The host and star of the show is Jamie Kennedy, a comedian who presented a reality TV format which combined hidden camera with sketch comedy. The show was a production of Bahr-Small Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television and Big Ticket Television and ran from January 13, 2002 until April 29, 2004. *Men, Women & Dogs premiered October 14, 2001 on The WB Television Network. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the series as the \\"most insultingly moronic, sniggering sitcom of the year\\". *Off Centre aired from October 14, 2001, to October 31, 2002. Created by Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz, and Danny Zuker, the series was heavily promoted as \\"from the guys who brought you American Pie\\". The show aired on The WB network on Sunday nights in its first season, and was renewed for a second season to be part of a new Thursday night comedy block. However, the move to Thursday did not help the lowly-rated show, and it was cancelled seven episodes into the second season, leaving two episodes (\\"Scary Sitcom\\" and \\"Chau's Hard Iced Tea\\") unfilmed. While it aired, the show was controversial for its raunchy content, as topics addressed included threesomes, circumcision, pornography and masturbation. On March 4, 2002, as the show faced pressure from watchdog groups such as the Parents Television Council (which voted Off Centre the second worst show for family viewing in 2002), The New York Post printed a memo from the WB's Standards and Practices Department to the creators of the show that stated: \\"It is essential to reduce and/or modify the significant number of uses of 'penis,' 'testicles,' 'foreskin' as well as euphemisms for the same, such as 'your thingie,'\\" the memo says in part. It also orders the exclusion of such references as \\"covered wagon\\", \\"unit\\", \\"turtleneck\\", \\"little fella\\", \\"anteater\\", \\"diddy\\", \\"cloaking device\\" and \\"my pig is still snuggly, wrapped in his doughy blanket.\\" The episode which dealt with circumcision, \\"The Unkindest Cut\\", came under fire because of its treatment of the character Euan, who is British and has not been circumcised (the procedure is not routine and is uncommon in Europe and other parts of the world including Asia and South America), as well as the treatment of uncircumcised men in general. *Smallville initially broadcast by The WB, premiered on October 16, 2001. After Smallvilles fifth season, The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, the series' later United States broadcaster. Smallville, which ended its tenth and final season on May 13, 2011, follows Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, before he becomes The Man of Steel/Superman. Smallville premiered at 9:00 pm on Tuesday, October 16, 2001 on The WB. For the next five seasons the series aired on The WB, moving from Tuesday at 9:00 pm to Wednesday at 8:00 pm and eventually to Thursday at 8:00 pm. In 2006, before the start of Smallvilles sixth season, it was announced The WB and UPN would merge into The CW and the network reported that the series would continue in its lineup. During its seventh season, the series aired in Canada a day earlier than it did in the United States. On May 21, 2009 it was announced that Smallvilles ninth season would move to Friday at 8:00 pm, considered the \\"death slot\\" for television programs. By the end of its tenth season it was the longest-running science-fiction TV show in the United States, breaking the record held by Stargate SG-1. Smallville set a WB record as its highest-rated series debut, with 8.4 million viewers tuned in for the pilot. Its premiere set a WB record for adults aged 18–34 and finished first among viewers aged 12–34, with Warner Bros. president Jordan Levin crediting the series with invigorating the network's Tuesday-night lineup. Smallville appeared on the cover of Entertainment Weekly as one of five new shows to watch. After its first season, the series was sixth on the Parents Television Council's 10-best list of broadcast programs. Levin, acknowledging early concerns that Smallville had become a villain of the week series, said that season two would introduce \\"smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes\\" and become less of a \\"serialized show\\". *Glory Days was broadcast from January 16 to March 25, 2002. Kevin Williamson originally conceived Glory Days as a drama in the same vein as his first series, Dawson's Creek, and a pilot was produced using this format. After picking up the series, The WB asked Williamson to retool the show and turn it into a mystery series instead. The characters and relationships remained the same but a whodunit spin was added.Rice, Lynette Rice (January 16, 2002). \\"Hope and Glory\\". Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved April 1, 2013. *My Guide to Becoming a Rock Star premiered March 14, 2002 on The WB Television Network. It is based on the UK series The Young Person's Guide to Becoming a Rock Star. *A network version of ElimiDate aired concurrently with the syndicated run called ElimiDate Deluxe on the WB for the 2001–2002 season, but was dropped after just a few airings. *Maybe It's Me first aired on October 5, 2001,'Maybe It's Me' tops decent night on The WB - Seattleepi.com and ended on May 3, 2002. During the network's upfront presentation that season, the show was originally titled Maybe I'm Adopted,15 May 2001: The Schedule - The WB News but following negative feedback, the show was re-titled. The show was unique in that it featured pop-up graphics on the screen, a concept originally proposed by Stan Rogow for another Disney- produced comedy series, Lizzie McGuire. *Raising Dad aired from October 5, 2001, to May 10, 2002. The series stars Bob Saget, Kat Dennings, Brie Larson, Riley Smith, Beau Wirick and Jerry Adler. and was produced by Albion Productions in association with Paramount Television. Carole Horst of Variety reviewed the first episode of Raising Dad and wrote: \\"a family trying to cope with the death of the mother... isn’t funny, but it is touching at times\\", and added that the cast \\"is fine, and \\"Dad\\" shows some promise. It probably will keep \\"Reba's\\" audience tuned in to end a nice family night of TV.\\" *Reba is an American sitcom television series starring Reba McEntire that aired on The WB from October 5, 2001, to May 5, 2006, and on The CW from November 19, 2006, to February 18, 2007. The show was cancelled when The WB and UPN merged into The CW. However, in an 11th hour move on May 17, 2006, The CW renewed Reba with a 13-episode order, reportedly to fulfill a syndication contract worth $20 million. In November 2006, The CW announced that the show would be paired with 7th Heaven, Sundays at 7:00 p.m., beginning later that month. Reba encores were scheduled for Sundays at 7:00 p.m. ET/PT, with a new episode at 7:30 p.m. Reba became the top-rated sitcom on the CW, also surpassing the dramas Supernatural, One Tree Hill, and Veronica Mars. The final episode aired on February 18, 2007. Reba set a new all-time viewership record for any program on the WB's Friday night (best-ever Friday in women 18–49). During its five seasons on the Friday night lineup, it often ranked 4th in its timeslot (ahead of both UPN and Fox), with a few episodes bringing in over 5 million viewers. Reba's premiere on The CW Sunday averaged 4.02 million viewers, including 1.64 million viewers and 40 percent among adults 18–49 more than when Everybody Hates Chris and All of Us premiered in the same time slot, thus making Reba the highest rated sitcom on the network. With Reba as a lead-in, 7th Heaven saw a season high of 4.51 million viewers. Reba was averaging 3,630,000 viewers since the beginning of its sixth season, making it the seventh most- watched show and the most-watched sitcom on The CW throughout the 2006–07 television season. The new Reba episodes vary as being either sixth or seventh most-watched program on the network, sometimes ranking as high as #3 for the week. Throughout The CW's inaugural season (2006–07), no other program had higher viewer turnout for repeat airings than Reba. As a result of the lackluster ratings for encores of the summer drama Hidden Palms, repeats of Reba returned to the CW's schedule in June 2007 after being absent for three months, and they immediately became the most-watched program of the night. Later in the summer, repeats of Reba were the most-viewed program on the CW network. ===2003=== *High School Reunion is a reality television series chronicling real-life high school reunions. The program originally aired on The WB for two seasons between 2003 and 2005, and featured reunions of classes after ten years. *Black Sash ran from March 30 to June 1, 2003. Including pilots, a total of eight episodes were made, however only six episodes were aired on The WB. About the show's failure, one of the show's producer, Carlton Cuse said: \\"I think everyone involved made a noble effort, but at the end of the day it just wasn’t a TV show that worked. Most don’t!\\" *Everwood aired from September 16, 2002 to June 5, 2006 with a total of 89 episodes spanning four seasons. It was canceled by The WB on May 17, 2006 following the merger with UPN to form The CW. Everwood's series finale, which aired on Monday, June 5, 2006, was seen by 4.07 million viewers. The final episode, \\"Foreverwood\\", was written as both a season and a series finale. Because of the impending WB/UPN merger into the CW Television Network, the future of the series was uncertain, and the producers wrote two endings: the aired version, as well as additional scenes where Madison showed up to cause some cliffhanger trouble. Originally, the producers had scripted a montage for the \\"series-finale cut\\" that went forty years into the future to show a majority of the gang at Andy's funeral—showing the series coming full circle; this was never filmed due to budgetary reasons as well as the producers' hopes that they would receive a fifth season. Everwood was canceled in favor of a new show, Runaway, which Dawn Ostroff then canceled after only three episodes had been shown, and for a new season of 7th Heaven, which had just had its series finale. The finale of 7th Heaven had 7 million viewers. Everwood had an average of 4 million viewers (which, if it was sustained, would have put it in the top 5 CW ratings for the following year). Robert Bianco for USA Today was not enthusiastic about the show's premiere and gave it a two-star rating out of four. He found that Everwoods main problem was that it \\"never knows when the corn syrup is thick enough\\" due to its clichés. On the more positive side, he wrote, \\"Clearly, WB's goal here is to find an acceptable time-period companion for 7th Heaven, and it's entirely possible the network has. The scenery is pretty, Smith has the earmarks of a star in the making, and Williams actually is quite appealing—when the script isn't forcing him to behave as if he were insane.\\" Advocacy group the Parents Television Council ranked Everwood as the group's No. 1 \\"worst network TV show for family viewing\\" on their list of the 2003–04 season. The PTC criticized \\"the careless and irresponsible treatment of sexual issues—especially when the teenaged characters are involved\\" and stated \\"Everwoods reckless messages about sex without consequences are expressly targeted to impressionable teens.\\" Entertainment Weekly reviewed positively the show's third season in 2005 giving it an \\"A−\\" and commented, \\"Everwoods soap tropes—unexpected pregnancy, adultery—handles these stories artfully.\\" *Despite the series debut of Birds of Prey garnering ratings of 7.6 million viewers (at the time, the network's largest premiere in the 18–34 demographic), the series was canceled after ratings fell sharply in subsequent weeks. Thirteen episodes were produced and aired in total. *Family Affair is a television comedy that aired from September 12, 2002 to March 13, 2003. The WB canceled the series after only airing thirteen of the fifteen episodes produced. The series was created as a remake of the original 1966–1971 Family Affair television series. It was produced by Pariah Films and Turner Television, with Bob Young, Gavin Polone, Sid and Marty Krofft, and Randy Pope acting as the series' executive producers. It was filmed in the same CBS Studio City lot as the original series. It was picked up to series by The WB in May 2002, when it was announced that the series would anchor a new Thursday night comedy block for the network. Luke Benward originally played the role of Jody in the series pilot, but was replaced by Jimmy \\"Jax\\" Pinchak as Jody in subsequent episodes. Family Affair earned a full season, when The WB gave the series a back-nine episode order in October 2002, but suffered low viewership soon after. In November 2002, The WB reversed course and cut the episode order for Family Affair by three episodes, and then soon after changed the episode order to just two additional episodes, for a total production order of 15 episodes rather than 22 or 19. The series was then pulled from the air in December 2002 due to low ratings. The series returned with new episodes in late February 2003, airing after Sabrina the Teenage Witch. By late March 2003, Family Affair was again pulled from the air and was generally considered to be \\"done\\". The WB officially passed on a second season of the series in May 2003. *Do Over was originally broadcast from September 19 to December 5, 2002, and it stars Penn Badgley. The show originally aired on the WB Network in 2002. It was scheduled on Thursdays at 8:30 EST. Unfortunately, the show was pitted against CBS's Survivor and NBC's Scrubs. Although the show had a devoted fan base, it suffered from low ratings and was cancelled after showing eleven of fifteen episodes. The entire series, including the final four episodes, aired on Channel 4 in Great Britain in September 2008. *The Surreal Life is a reality television series that records a group of celebrities as they live together in Glen Campbell's former mansion in the Hollywood Hills for two weeks. The format of the show resembles that of The Real World and Road Rules, in that the cameras not only record the castmates' participation in group activities assigned to them, but also their interpersonal relationships and conflicts. The series is also likened to The Challenge in that previously known individuals from separate origins of entertainment are brought together into one cast. The show's first two seasons aired on The WB, and subsequent seasons were shown on VH1. *On the Spot is a short-lived sketch comedy series which aired during early 2003. The show consisted of a mixture of scripted sketches and improvisational comedy. *The O'Keefes premiered on May 22, 2003 and ended on June 12, 2003. The series was about the O'Keefe family: Harry and Ellie, together with their children, Lauren, Danny and Mark. The plot centered on the fact that the O'Keefe parents had homeschooled their children for most of their lives and with the dramatic and comic interest arising in situations where the children were beginning to experience the outside world. There was a lot of controversy about this show among parents who homeschool their children, as they felt it portrayed homeschooling in a negative light. *What I Like About You ran on The WB from September 20, 2002, to March 24, 2006, with a total of 86 episodes produced. With the exception of a brief period early in the second season, What I Like About You was a headline on The WB's Friday Night Comedy Lineup. From April to September 2006, The WB aired a daily hour of reruns of the series during its Daytime WB afternoon programming block alongside 8 Simple Rules. When The CW launched in September 2006, reruns of the series moved to the new network's CW Daytime block, remaining until September 2008. *Greetings from Tucson aired from September 20, 2002 to May 9, 2003, during the 2002-2003 season. Though reviews were mixed, critics applauded the abilities of the mostly-Latino cast, calling the show \\"a welcome addition to TV's largely white landscape,\\" Greetings from Tucson  PopMatters Television Review and compared its premise to I Love Lucy, The Jeffersons and the thought-provoking 1970s comedies of Norman Lear. *Grounded for Life debuted on January 10, 2001, as a mid-season replacement on the Fox Network. It was created by Mike Schiff and Bill Martin. It ran for two seasons on the network until being cancelled only two episodes into its third season. It was immediately picked up for the rest of the third season by The WB, where it aired for two additional seasons until the series ended on January 28, 2005. Ninety-one complete episodes were produced and aired between 2000 and 2005. However, not all episodes were broadcast in the exact order they were produced. The first season originally produced 22 episodes, five of which, prior to the season finale were held back by Fox and were included as part of the second season. 17 episodes were produced for season two, with the addition of the five season one episodes, making it a 22-episode season. Many problems occurred during the production of season three. 19 episodes had been produced for season three, and with Fox cancelling the series later being picked up by The WB, only 11 episodes aired through the two networks, 12 & 13 never aired, and episodes 14 through 19, were included as part of season four. The fourth season originally produced 22 episodes, with the new addition of six from season three, making it the longest season with 28 episodes. Season five produced 13 episodes and was the only season to have all its episodes intact. ===2004=== *Tarzan premiered on October 5, 2003, and ended on November 23, 2003. Based on the Tarzan series by Edgar Rice Burroughs and developed by Eric Kripke, Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, the show was set in New York City and depicted modern-day adaptations of Burroughs' characters. In December 2003, the series was canceled after eight episodes. Kripke was critical of the show, calling it \\"a piece of crap\\" and saying: \\"I'll stand behind the pilot. It has a beginning, middle, and -- the problem -- it ends. I was hungry to have anything in production, so I wrote a 50-page story that ended. Then it got made and I had something in production, and it was all my dreams come true. They said to me, 'Let's do 12 more.' I said, 'Uh, wait! What's the story?' So, Tarzan was a hell ride in every way, and we only did eight before they wisely put us out of our misery.\\" On Metacritic the show has a score of 45% based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". *Steve Harvey's Big Time Challenge aired from 2003 to 2005, hosted by Steve Harvey. In each episode, performers compete for a $10,000 prize. *The WB's Superstar USA is a television show that spoofed the popular show American Idol. Essentially its polar opposite, Superstar USA told contestants they were looking for the best singer when they were actually looking for the worst. One producer, worried that the live audience members would be unable to respectfully compose themselves during the final performances, falsely informed them that the singers were all terminally ill young people who were having a wish fulfilled by a charitable organization. The Los Angeles Times reported the said organization as the Make a Wish Foundation, which later received an apology from the WB. In an interview with USA Today, executive producer Mike Fleiss straightened out the details: \\"First of all, it was me. But I did not say 'Make-A-Wish.' I said, 'Who's heard of the One Wish Foundation?' and people raised their hands. There is no One Wish Foundation. It was a prank on top of a prank. It was the only way to get it to work.\\" *Summerland premiered on June 1, 2004 on the now defunct television network The WB. The series ran for a total of 26 episodes over two seasons. Its cancellation was announced on May 15, 2005 and the last episode aired on July 18, 2005. On May 15, 2005, The WB released early information on their 2005–2006 season. Summerland, along with eight other shows, were canceled. Jesse McCartney responded to the cancellation in an interview, saying the show was \\"in a crazy time slot and...the writers were having trouble, and it was just a bad call.\\" *Columbia TriStar Television optioned the television rights for Fearless in 1999 and a pilot episode was filmed for The WB for the Fall 2003 television season. The series would have starred Rachael Leigh Cook as Gaia, who would now be a 23-year-old field agent for the FBI. The show was never aired, as producer Jerry Bruckheimer pulled the show due to various concerns and the time slot was later filled with One Tree Hill. Warren Ellis later reviewed the pilot episode and criticized it as \\"too unfocussed [sic] to make consistently engaging television, and I think it's the wrong composition of concepts to hook the young audience I assume they're playing for.\\" *One Tree Hill premiered on September 23, 2003, on The WB. After the series' third season, The WB merged with UPN to form The CW, and from September 27, 2006, the series was broadcast by The CW in the United States until the end of its run in 2012. The series premiered to 2.5million viewers and rose to 3.3million in its second week, becoming one of only three shows to rise in their second episode during the 2003–2004 television season. Season one went on to average 3.5million viewers, and the second season was the highest rated in the series, averaging 4.3million viewers weekly and a 1.9 Adults 18–49 rating. The CW only attracts a fraction of the audience its competitors do. \\"So the strategy is super-serving a young coveted demographics. The network's sweet spot is women 18–34 and with a viewer median age of 33, it boasts the youngest audience among its broadcast competitors by almost a dozen years.\\" Averaging 4.3million viewers weekly, season two was One Tree Hill's highest-rated season. During this season, the show emerged as one of The WB's hits. \\"Of all the shows that they've launched in the last two years, this one has the most traction\\", said Stacey Lynn Koerner, at the time an executive vice president at Initiative, a media planning agency. \\"It does have an audience it's connecting with – a loyal audience that comes back week in and week out.\\" The show was particularly popular among the young viewership. It became the first choice of prime-time television for teenage girls and was reported in January 2005 to be the program in Tuesday's 9 pm time slot most viewed by women aged 12 to 34. *All About the Andersons originally aired on The WB from September 12, 2003 to February 12, 2004. It lasted one season before being canceled. *Run of the House aired between September 11, 2003 and May 7, 2004. Nineteen episodes were produced but only sixteen were aired before the show was cancelled. The final three episodes that were unaired in the United States were aired in the UK on the Trouble Network at the end of 2004 and were repeated during the end of 2007 and early 2008. *Like Family aired from September 19, 2003 to April 22, 2004. The series stars Holly Robinson Peete and Kevin Michael Richardson and lasted one season. Like Family was created and produced by Dan Fogelman, and executive produced by Warren Littlefield, Kenny Schwartz, and Rick Weiner. *Blue Collar TV aired from July 29, 2004 to July 26, 2006. The lead actors Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, and Larry the Cable Guy. The show's humor dealt principally with contemporary American society, and especially hillbilly, redneck, and Southern stereotypes. The show was greenlighted on the heels of the success of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, which the series' three lead actors toured with in the early to mid-2000s. Blue Collar TV returned on May 31, 2006, to finish airing its second season throughout the summer as filler for the final weeks of the WB, which would shut down later that year. The show did not move to The CW. In summer 2006, Foxworthy started his own show, Foxworthy's Big Night Out, which aired on Country Music Television and retained some aspects of the Blue Collar TV format. It was canceled after one season. *Studio 7 airedduring the summer of 2004. The WB originally ordered two seasons of Studio 7, with the second season to air immediately after the first. However, the network cancelled plans for a second season during the initial run, due to low ratings. *The Help premiered on March 5, 2004. The WB only aired seven episodes, the show ending on April 16, 2004, and canceled it in May 2004. The premiere of The Help was the most watched program in the Friday 9:30–10:00 time slot on The WB in the 2003–04 season. The premiere was more popular among women than men aged 12–34 (2.0/8 versus 1.3/5). Despite the premiere being the best performance in the time slot of the season on The WB the critics have nothing positive to say. Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times said the show \\"comes off like a school play, clumsily blocked, loudly acted and nearly shouted down by obligatory laughter and applause\\". Robert Bianco of USA Today pointed out that \\"this is the kind of show that opens with a doggie-doo joke and still finds a way to go downhill\\". Perhaps the harshest was Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe: \\"The WB's claim that 'The Help' is a 'biting satire' is only half true. No, it's not a satire, but yes, it does indeed bite. And it will be biting the dust before long, unless it can find a new cast, new writers, new producers, a new set, and an entirely new premise.\\" In her review of the 2003–04 season Kay McFadden, television critic for The Seattle Times, classified The Help as \\"Never should have aired\\". ===2005=== *Jack & Bobby aired from September 12, 2004 to May 11, 2005. On May 17, 2005, The WB announced it would not renew Jack & Bobby for a second season.Frog looks for big leap with shakeup The series finale was re-aired as part of a Warner Bros. 50th anniversary celebration on the TV Land cable network on June 11, 2005. Following this airing, the series has never been rebroadcast on American television. *The Mountain was broadcast for one season from September 22, 2004 to January 2, 2005. The show received very low ratings and was canceled after only thirteen episodes. *The Starlet premiered on March 26, 2005. Ten young actresses lived together in a home formerly owned by Marilyn Monroe, while competing in a series of acting challenges for the chance to win a role on the WB drama One Tree Hill and a management contract with 3 Arts Entertainment. The eventual winner was 18-year-old Michelynne McGuire, with Mercedes Connor as the runner up. The Starlet was cancelled on April 5, 2005 after only 1 season of 6 episodes. *Following the second season, the American version of Beauty and the Geek moved to The CW, the new network formed when both The WB and UPN ceased operations in September 2006. The two-hour season premiere for the third season aired Wednesday, January 3, 2007 at 8:00 p.m. EST on The CW. The fourth season premiered on September 18, making BATG the first series to premiere for the CW for the 2007-08 television season. Beauty and the Geek was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on March 12, 2008. After the fifth season, the show was put on indefinite hiatus in order to stoke renewed interest in the show, and perhaps the addition of innovative twists to the format.Adalian, Josef. \\"'Geek' not very popular with CW\\" , Variety, April 28, 2008 In October 2008, casting began for a sixth season,TVSeriesFinale.com: \\"Beauty and the Geek: Plans Underway for New Season of Reality Show\\" October 31, 2008 scheduled to air on MTV, with minor celebrities as the beauties.The Hollywood Reporter, \\"'Beauty and the Geek' could go to MTV: Network in negotiations for celebrity version of the series\\" by James Hibberd, November 19, 2008 However, a sixth season never materialized. *Drew Carey's Green Screen Show premiered on The WB Network on October 7, 2004. Coinciding with the show's debut, Carey participated in a number of promotional appearances, such as guest hosting The Late Late Show, and starring in a special episode of Blue Collar TV, Green Screen's lead-in program. On November 8, after having run five episodes, The WB announced that it was temporarily pulling \\"Drew Carey's Green Screen Show\\" from its schedule for November sweeps after it averaged 2.7 million viewers per week. It was confirmed as cancelled in May 2005 at their 2005-06 fall presentation. As a result, Drew Carey and executive producer Ron Diamond, took the show to Comedy Central, returning it to the air on September 26, 2005.http://www.answers.com/topic/drew-carey *Living with Fran debuted on April 8, 2005, and ran two seasons before ending on March 24, 2006. The series was originally titled Shacking Up, and was ordered to series by The WB for the 2004–05 television season, though it ultimately did not premiere in fall 2004 and was held for midseason. The early tapings of the show frustrated star Fran Drescher, and the series' original showrunners were replaced before the show ever aired. It was not renamed until very close to its premiere; episodes of television entertainment shows like Extra can be found on the internet discussing the show with the cast and previewing clips while still calling it Shacking Up. The premiere episode of Living with Fran airing at 8:30p.m. on April 8, 2005, drew 3.1 million viewers and a 1.3 rating/5 share in adults 18–49 in preliminary ratings, improving on the ratings of its lead-in What I Like About You, while the followup episode of the show that the same evening at 9:30p.m. retained approximately 90% of the audience from its lead-in Reba. The series was considered a \\"solid\\" performer in its first season according to Varietys Rick Kissell. On October 18, 2005, The WB removed Living with Fran from its Friday night schedule, replacing with the new series Twins, indicating that the series was just being put on hiatus and that the remaining nine episodes of the second season would air at a later date. The show returned Friday, January 13, 2006, at 8:30p.m. The second-season finale aired on Friday, March 24, 2006. In the episode, Riley proposed to Fran; the episode was a cliffhanger, and Fran's answer was not revealed. On May 17, 2006, one day before the upfronts, it was announced that Living with Fran would not be returning for a third season in fall 2006 on the new CW network, which was the result of the merger of the former WB and UPN networks. Michigan J. Frog was the official mascot of The WB Television Network from its inception in 1995 until 2005. The network's first night of programming on January 11, 1995 began with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck wondering which one of them would pull the switch to launch The WB. The camera then panned over to Chuck Jones drawing Michigan on an easel; when Jones finished, Michigan leapt from the drawing to formally launch The WB. Michigan also would usually appear before the opening of shows, informing the viewer of the TV rating. Before the beginning of Savannah, for example, the frog would sing a short monologue suggesting that \\"[t]here's more comedy for the family Wednesday nights\\" and that kids should go to bed, meaning that the show coming on would be for mature audiences only. In later shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, the announcer would present a TV-PG disclaimer, though the frog still appeared as a neon sign. On July 22, 2005, Michigan's \\"death\\" was announced by WB Chairman Garth Ancier at a fall season preview with the terse statement \\"The frog is dead and buried.\\" The head of programming for The WB, David Janollari, stated that \\"[Michigan] was a symbol that perpetuated the young teen feel of the network. That's not the image we [now] want to put out to our audience.\\"\\"Michigan J. Frog has no leg to stand on\\". , TV.com, July 26, 2005. Retrieved May 4, 2013. ===2006=== This would be the final season of broadcasting for both UPN and The WB. They would merge to form The CW next season. The book Season Finale suggests many reasons for the demise of The WB, including founder Jamie Kellner's departure, the lack of owned and operated stations, a failure to develop many new hits after 2002, Time Warner's decision to merge with America Online and allowing Buffy the Vampire Slayer to move from The WB to UPN for its last two seasons.Tuned In: 'Season Finale' book details rise and fall of WB and UPN Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.com *Supernatural; was first broadcast on September 13, 2005, on The WB, and subsequently became part of successor The CW's lineup. The pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, and the ratings of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the series for a full season. Rather than having the series debut on television, The WB instead made the pilot episode available for online streaming through Yahoo! a week before it was set to premiere on the network as part of a promotional scheme. Following the transition to The CW, Supernatural episodes were added to Apple's iTunes Store starting in December 2006, being one of the first CW series to be made available for sale online. The following month, the network began streaming episodes of the series on its website with limited commercial interruption, available for up to four weeks after the initial airings. After the first four episodes of Supernatural aired in 2005, the WB decided to pick up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. During those first episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 18–34 and 12–34. It also posted an increase of 73% in males aged 18–49 from the year before, although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its lead-in, Gilmore Girls. Supernatural had low ratings during its second season, with viewers consisting mainly of teen girls, and the CW trying to attract more male viewers. The show's future was in doubt at the end of the second season. Despite mediocre ratings in the previous year, it was back for a third season. Although its third season's rating were low, it did well with viewers aged 18–49. In this category, it ranked eighth of all returning series broadcast by a major network. The show received an early pickup for its fourth season. The show's ratings increased in its fourth season. The fourth-season premiere aired on September 18, 2008, averaging its highest rating ever since its debut on The CW with 3.96 million viewers, a 33% surge over the season three premiere and a 1.7/5 in adults 18–49, up 42% from one year earlier. On October 16, 2008, the show was watched by 3.06 million viewers, making the lowest rating for the season. On October 30, 2008, the show climbed to its best performance in adults 18–34 (1.4/4), adults 18–49 (1.5/4) and total viewers (3.6mil) since its season premiere on September 18, 2008. For the fifth-season premiere, viewership increased by 6% in women 18–34 (1.7/5) over the fourth- season premiere. However, taking DVR viewings into account with new Live-Plus 7 Day data, total viewership for the premiere increased 38%, with women 18–34 increasing by 35% and adults 18–34 by 47%. The advertisements The WB chose for the show went beyond just commercials and billboards. Before the series debuted, the network placed signs for the show at gas station pumps, and gave out rubber glow-in-the-dark bracelets at New York and Los Angeles movie theaters. Also, coffee cup sleeves revealed the image of a \\"terrified woman seemingly pinned to a ceiling\\" when heated were distributed to 500 cafes throughout New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The same image was used in special mirrors the network installed in almost 200 nightclubs throughout three cities in order to reach \\"young, hip horror fans\\". Additional advertisements were also placed in bars, movie theaters, and video game stores, with hundreds of the bars also receiving Supernatural napkins and coasters. *Pepper Dennis aired from April 4 to July 4, 2006. It was quickly announced on May 17, 2006 that Pepper Dennis would not be one of the WB shows transferred to The CW. Pepper Dennis was the final show to premiere on The WB before its transition to The CW network. The song used in commercials for the show was \\"Black Horse and the Cherry Tree\\" by KT Tunstall, and the opening theme song is \\"Better Half\\" by Chris Trapper, the former frontman for the Boston pop group The Push Stars. Another song that the WB used for advertising \\"Pepper Dennis\\" was Morningwood's \\"Nth Degree\\" which also appeared in another WB drama, One Tree Hill. *Just Legal premiered on September 19, 2005, and was canceled on October 3, 2005, after three episodes had been aired. Almost a year later, The WB burned off five additional episodes on Sundays following a repeat of the pilot on August 6, 2006 at 7:00 pm Eastern Standard Time/6:00 pm CST. The series concluded on September 10, 2006. *Related aired from October 5, 2005, to March 20, 2006, during the 2005–2006 television season. Despite heavy promotion, initial ratings did not warrant the show being picked up for a second season when The WB network was folded into The CW. *The Bedford Diaries premiered on March 29, 2006 on The WB and concluded its first season on May 10, 2006. A week prior to its premiere, The WB attempted to build buzz with scenes from the series' pilot posted on their website with more adult material not meant for broadcast, with those scenes edited out for the actual broadcast episode. *Twins first aired on The WB in the United States and on CTV in Canada on September 16, 2005 and ended on March 3, 2006. The show was cancelled on May 18, 2006, due to the merger of the WB and UPN that created the new network The CW. *Modern Men premiered on March 17, 2006. The show was canceled due to a lack of time slots from the merger of The WB and UPN that created the new network The CW and due to poor ratings. *Survival of the Richest first aired on March 31, 2006, in which seven \\"rich kids\\" who had a combined net worth of over $3 billion were forced to work together with 7 \\"poor kids\\" who had a combined debt of $150,000, through a series of challenges to win the grand prize of USD $200,000. It was hosted by Hal Sparks. The WB closed on Sunday, September 17 with a five-hour block of pilot episodes of the network's past signature series, including Felicity, Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which was a two-hour episode) and Dawson's Creek. Commercial breaks shown on the network that evening featured re-airings of past image campaigns and network promotions, promo spots given to cable networks that carried these shows in off-network syndication, as well as ads for each series' TV-on-DVD box set. After its final commercial break, a montage featuring stars of several of The WB's shows over the years was broadcast just prior to the network's shutdown, ending with a silhouette of former mascot Michigan J. Frog taking a final bow. This was followed by the studio credits for the pilot of Dawson's Creek;. September 17, 2006. the credits for the other three pilots that aired were shown in the network's standardized credits format. The final night of WB programming netted relatively low ratings, mustering only a share of 2, meaning just 2% of viewers were tuned into The WB on its final night. The reasoning for the low ratings was due to the fact that WB affiliates in certain areas had already affiliated with MyNetworkTV at that network's launch, which rendered The WB's programming unavailable in these markets during its final two weeks of broadcasting. It also aired against the second ever game (a Cowboys–Redskins rivalry game at Texas Stadium) of NBC Sunday Night Football, assuring fewer viewers due to the curiosity of the NFL's prime game now being on Sunday evenings. That evening, after The WB shut down, some Tribune-owned affiliates that would join The CW when it launched the following night acknowledged the pending switchover within their newscasts, with most adopting their new CW station brands immediately. WPIX in New York City aired a montage of all of the logos used throughout the station's history leading up to the introduction of its new \\"CW11\\" logo before the start of its 10:00 p.m. newscast,. May 8, 2009. Retrieved September 2, 2015. while KHCW (channel 39) in Houston aired a retrospective of the station's history during its 9:00 p.m. news. In Dallas- Fort Worth, KDAF (channel 33) had retitled its primetime newscast to CW33 News at Nine immediately following the end of WB programming, and featured a video clip of the signage being changed outside the station's studios (however, the old WB33 News at Nine bumper aired upon returning from the first commercial break that night). *The Night of Favorites and Farewells was a one-time special lineup that aired on September 17, 2006. It consisted of pilot episodes for some of the network's most popular and longest running shows. The five-hour block was aired on all affiliates of The WB with the exception of those which had taken affiliation with MyNetworkTV, unless they kept the WB as a secondary affiliation. It served as The WB's last nationally broadcast schedule, as the network officially closed down after the program Dawson's Creek ended to make way for The CW. The night began with the announcer, Hal Douglas (who had become the \\"voice\\" of the WB for the majority of its history, and would not continue as announcer for the CW, but instead moved to ABC), introducing the viewers to the night's schedule, and began with the premiere episode of Felicity. The final image on The WB was of their former mascot Michigan J. Frog (who was shown as a white silhouette due to the animated character being retired as the network's mascot the year before), taking his hat off and bowing while the words \\"thank you\\" are on the screen, thanking the audience for watching the network for the last 11 years. As the image faded out, The WB officially left the airwaves. The clip montage officially ended the network's operations, as the studio credits for Dawson's Creek were shown afterwards instead of The WB's standard credits scheme, which had been used on the other pilots that aired during the night. That evening, after The WB shut down, some affiliates that would join The CW when it launched the following night acknowledged the pending switchover within their newscasts, with most adopting their new CW station brands immediately. New York City affiliate WPIX (channel 11) aired a montage of all of the logos used throughout the station's history leading up to the introduction of its new \\"CW11\\" logo before the start of its 10:00 p.m. newscast, while KHCW (channel 39) in Houston aired a retrospective of the station's history during its 9:00 p.m. news. In Dallas- Fort Worth, KDAF (channel 33) had retitled its primetime newscast to CW33 News at Nine immediately following the end of WB programming, and featured a video clip of the signage being changed outside the station's studios (however, the old WB33 News at Nine bumper aired upon returning from the first commercial break that night). Over the next few days, there were many discussions about the night on The CW's forums, most of which expressed sadness. Additionally, many recalled memories of watching the WB. However, The Night of Favorites and Farewells was a disappointment in ratings; The WB that night scored a 0.9 household rating and a share of just 2. The main reason for this mostly lies in certain areas where former WB affiliates became MyNetworkTV affiliates, thus leaving The WB's final two weeks of programming unavailable in such markets as Philadelphia, Seattle and Atlanta, whose WB affiliates switched to MyNetworkTV. ==See also== *List of programs broadcast by The WB *List of former WB affiliates *Kids' WB **List of programs broadcast by Kids' WB *History of UPN ==References== ==External links== *The WB Launched 25 Years Ago, and Millennials Will Never Forget *Every The WB Show, Ranked - TV Guide *The Top Shows in WB and UPN History: 15-8 *The 25 Best UPN, WB and CW TV Shows of All Time *Why the WB and UPN Were Two Television Networks Ahead of Their Time *How The WB Became A Hub For Black Entertainment In The '90s *How Well Do You Remember The WB? *The WB 20th anniversary: Ranking all 32 of the network's dramas from worst to best *20th Anniversary of The WB *20 Years Later, A Ranking of the 20 Best Shows in CW History WB, The WB, The Category:The WB ","title":"History of The WB"},{"id":"63911513","text":"Prince Charles of Luxembourg (Charles Jean Philippe Joseph Marie Guillaume; born 10 May 2020) is the only child of Hereditary Grand Duke Guillaume and Hereditary Grand Duchess Stéphanie.

The school gained recognition from many European artists and had the personal support of Sultan Abdulaziz, who allowed Guillemet to paint the women of his harem. In 1877, he inaugurated the \\"Imperial Art School\\" (Mekteb-i Sanayi-i Chabane); serving as its Director. This served as the inspiration for the \\"School of Fine Arts\\" (', now known as the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University), which was founded by Osman Hamdi Bey in 1883.

The temple belongs to the Shingon sect and its main image is a statue of Amida Nyōrai. ==History== Gokuraku-ji was founded on the eastern bank of the Kitakami River in the year 857 AD, during the reign of Emperor Montoku. This coincides with the invasion of the region by the armies of the Yamato court and the suppression of the local Emishi tribes, and the construction of nearby Isawa Castle. The Yamato general Sakanoue no Tamuramaro is recorded to have donated a statue of Bishamon to the temple. At one point the temple is said to have had over 700 structures, including 36 dormitories for monks and to have covered the entire stopes of Mount Kunimi.

The location and layout correspond to the original location of Gokuraku-ji given in the historical record. Excavations continued after the year 1987, uncovering a large portion of the site, with foundation stones for structures from the 10-11th centuries, and numerous fragments of Buddhist statues, roof tiles and other ceramics, and the metal filials of staffs used by Buddhist monks.

Perth Glory Football Club is an Australian association football club based in Perth, Western Australia. The club was formed in 1995, and played their first competitive match in October 1996, when they joined the National Soccer League. The club won its first significant trophy in 2000 – the National Soccer League Premiership. Since then, the club has won a further 3 league Premierships, along with 2 league Championships. The club was one of 8 teams in the A-League when it was formed in 2004. They experienced the most successful period in their history under the management of Mich d'Avray, who guided the team to consecutive league Championships in 2002–03 and 2003–04. Since Perth Glory's first competitive match, over 200 players have made a competitive first-team appearance for the club. Many of these players have spent only a short period of their career at Perth Glory before seeking opportunities in other teams; some players had their careers cut short by injury, while others left for other reasons. Storm Roux only played one match for Perth Glory but has gone on to have a successful career at Central Coast Mariners and Melbourne Victory; he has also won 10 caps for the New Zealand national team. As of 8 May 2020, over 100 players have played fewer than 25 competitive matches for the club; of these, 12 players are currently under contract with Perth Glory. Three former players – Adrian Webster, Eugène Dadi and Xavi Torres – each made 24 appearances during their spell at Perth. The most recent player to make his debut for the club is Australian Tarek Elrich, who played as a substitute on 7 February 2020 in the 2019–20 A-League match against Wellington Phoenix. The Perth Glory player closest to making his 25th appearance for the club is Uruguayan forward Bruno Fornaroli; he has made 22 appearances for the Glory. __TOC__ ==List of players== Frenchman William Gallas finished his professional career in Perth.

However, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. experienced an unprecedented lockdown and national unemployment reached a record high. This presents an issue because it is recorded that during times of economic stress, child abuse skyrockets. A prime example of this occurred in the Dallas–Fort Worth area, which already witnessed a major uptick in abuse rates. Six children, all under the age of 4, were physically abused, as reported by Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth. Doctors believe all of these cases were driven by coronavirus- related stress. In the age of COVID-19, where families were locked inside their homes, human contact was limited, and courts closed, the United States witnessed an aggressive upsurge in child abuse rates as a result of several systemic flaws. == Identification == Identifying and reporting child maltreatment is the first step in all child welfare system work. It is how the child's mistreatment comes to the attention of authorities and, from there, action is taken. One of the biggest mechanisms the system has traditionally relied on has been mandatory reporters, such as teachers, law enforcement, and health care professionals. A child's regular contact with their community has been relied on for individuals to be able to identify and report abuse. Upon the national quarantine, fewer cases began to be reported. An illustration of this may be seen in the U.S. Midwest. Illinois abuse hotline receives about 950 calls a day, approximately 6,650 a week. After Governor Pritzker closed schools, that number dropped by 45% within the week. The problems stemming from closures is not limited to America. In England, Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, estimated that over 2.3 million minors in England are currently at high-risk for abuse and unable to access social services as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. == Lack of youth resources == Outside of the child welfare system, another crucial element that contributes to offsetting child neglect is that schools continue to be some of the only places many youth receive mental-health help, physical activity, nourishment and clean water. More than six million students across 11,000 American schools are the primary provider of critical services and, until now, relied on schools for those resources. == Impact on the investigation process == The next step in child welfare work is investigating and intervening. The current foster care system in the U.S. operates on worker mobility, human contact and the frequent movement of children. However, with that movement grinding to a halt after the lockdown, caseworkers are limited in their ability to monitor and investigate potential cases of abuse. The U.S. Children's Bureau evaluated alternatives to caseworker inspections, while many state and local governments began limiting or canceling abuse allegation investigations. One of the most extreme measures was Maine's Office of Child and Family Services suspending all caseworker home visits; many agencies and social workers were worried about contracting or transmitting the virus and as a result they conducted investigations from the front doors of homes or over video chats. == Effects on housing and visitation == Another element of this is the housing of children already in foster care. Major cities around the world witnessed a serious contraction in available foster housing because many foster parents and facilities are typically run by older individuals,. In- person visitations between family members during a separation is recognized as important for both the parent(s) and the child; however, similar to home inspections, separated families transitioned to virtual visitations. == Family courts == One of the final steps in a child welfare case is that of courts establishing a long-term solvency plan. This could include a variety of solutions from reunification to the revocation of custody, all dependent on the individualized case. However, because of the long-term impacts of this final step, during COVID-19, experts have worried about the legal backlog and pileup. Children currently in foster care (and any children taken under lockdown) because of alleged abuse or neglect now await trial. Many legal institutions across the world are closing their doors because of COVID-19 and many are pushing trial and meeting dates back indefinitely. A prime example of this is in Los Angeles County, one of the largest counties in the United States, where all non-essential work was suspended, including family courts. == References == Category:Foster care in the United States Category:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States ","title":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on foster care in the United States"},{"id":"63911998","text":"Dendrolobium baccatum is a species of flowering plants in the Fabaceae family.

Duke professor of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. Cullen was the Founding Director of the Duke University Center for Virology. == Early life and education == Cullen was born in December 1951 in Bradford, England, where he graduated head of his class from Thornton Grammar School in 1970. In 1973, he received a B.Sc. in biochemistry from Warwick University, England and in 1974, he received an M.Sc. in virology from Birmingham University, England. Dr. Cullen emigrated to the US in 1974, where he received a Ph.D. in microbiology from Rutgers University, New Jersey, in 1984. He became a US citizen in 1992. == Research == Cullen and his laboratory are currently studying the regulation of viral mRNA expression by epitranscriptomic modifications and the use of CRISPR/Cas as a potential approach to the treatment of chronic diseases caused by DNA viruses. Cullen discovered the phenomenon of “transcriptional interference” in retroviruses and showed that this explained why proviral 5’LTRs are active while 3’ LTRs are silenced. After starting his own research group in 1984, he demonstrated that the HIV-1 Tat protein activates viral transcription and that the HIV-1 Rev protein induces viral RNA nuclear export. He demonstrated that HIV-1 readily infects non-dividing cells, an unexpected result that overturned then prevalent dogma, and showed that a single variable loop in the Envelope protein, the V3 loop, controls HIV-1 tissue tropism. His laboratory was the first to express and functionally characterize microRNAs in mammalian cells and the first to identify and functionally characterize the microRNAs encoded by the herpesviruses KHSV, EBV and HSV-1. Recently, his laboratory was the first to report that several distinct epitranscriptomic modifications added to viral mRNAs promote viral gene expression and replication. == Awards and honors == Cullen was the recipient of the 1989 Ely Lilly Molecular Biology Award. He was awarded a distinguished fellowship by Durham University, UK in 2007. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology since 2009 and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science since 2011. He was named one of the top peer reviewers by the Journal of Virology in 2009 and 2011 and has been identified as a highly cited scientist by both Clarivate Analytics at Web of Science and by Thomson Reuters annually since 2001. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of science (D.Sc.) degree by Warwick University in 2016. ==Key publications== * Cullen, Bryan R., Lomedico, Peter T. and Ju, Grace.

The home sits on the prominent Cleveland thoroughfare of Euclid Avenue near the I-90 Bridge located by East 30th Street. The home has been owned by Cleveland State University since 1967. It was renovated by the school in 2006–2007. It is one of the last surviving mansions on Euclid. One by one these grand houses of the well-to-do were demolished to make way for new construction, but the Mather remained. The ceilings are 16 feet high inside the massive dwelling's ballroom . The property included sunken gardens. It is part of the much larger Euclid Avenue Historic District which encompasses over twenty properties, that was one of the first bulk entries of numerous historical properties in the city in the 1970s. In 2014, the house served as the University's English as a second language department. The mansion is said to be haunted. ==History== In the late 1870s to the early 1910s, Cleveland's Euclid Avenue began to be dotted with several mansions that sprang up as Cleveland started to attract wealthy industrialist with its major businesses of coal, steel, iron, shipping, and oil. John D. Rockefeller, the undisputed king of Standard Oil and richest man in history it is alleged, Amasa Stone the Cleveland railroad baron father of Mather's wife, Charles F. Brush the inventor, George Worthington, Marcus A. Hanna, John Hay, Jeptha Wade, Charles E. J. Lang, and Mather all had homes built here by 1911. Euclid Avenue was once known as the \\"Most beautiful street in the world\\" . The concentration of wealth within this narrow strip of land has never been replicated again. Schweinfurth was on something of a building spurt and designed more than fifteen homes for the Cleveland aristocracy, most of these homes are gone. A few still survive including Mather's, Case's near Case Western Reserve University in the University neighborhood, the Stager Beckwith near the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus, and the Parker-Hannifin House on the Cleveland State Campus which serves as the School of Graduate Studies at CSU. The 15, 121 sq. ft. house was turned over to Cleveland State in 1967 after having passed through multiple hands following Mather's death in 1931 including the Cleveland Institute of Music and the Cleveland Automobile Club . For decades the historic relic was furnished to serve as offices and official functions of the university until it was all but abandoned in the early 2010s. It was reopened to the general public in late 2015 after a $2.7 million rehab. ==Mather family== The house was the last grand house built on Euclid and was to be the family home of the large Mather clan which included four children, Samuel Livingston (b. 1882) named after his father, Amasa Stone (b. 1884) named for his grandfather on his mother's side, Constance (b. 1889) and Philip Richard (b. 1894). It is noteworthy to realize that his wife, Flora Stone Mather, never saw the completed manor as she died of breast cancer before the family could move in and so her daughter Constance became the lady of the house, as was the custom at the time, she even invited the Cleveland Orchestra to perform at parties several times while living there. This happenstance may be a factor in why many say the house is haunted until this day . The Mathers also owned a summer residence named Shoreby in the Cleveland municipality Bratenahl, which still has the 6th highest per capita income at over $80,000 in the state of Ohio . That reality has not changed much as the area was the playground for the very wealthy in the Mathers hey day as well. ==Location== The survival of this homestead is a boon to Cleveland architectural historians and provides them a glimpse into early 20th century residential dwelling construction /technologyhttps://www.csualumni.com/about/our-home/. The house, as was the fashion of many historic homes at the time, sits well back (more than ten yards) from the street grid and resembles a southern plantation or an English Manor House or Great House more than a city house Girouard (1978). Many of these homes therefore sported huge front lawns that needed to be meticulously manicured by staff or groundskeepers, their duties would include tending the many lavish gardens around the propertygroundskeeper in Oxford Dictionaries Online: \\"North American term for groundsman.\\"park-keeper in Oxford Dictionaries Online: \\"The caretaker of a park.\\". The house seems out of place in today's modern world but this is probably because almost all of its peers are gone. When looked at from a historical standpoint, the house would not look so out of character with its many neighbors had they survived destruction and razing. It is too easy to say that it is a relic when placed alongside the sleek, modern Cleveland State buildings. http://images.ulib.csuohio.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/press&CISOPTR;=2762&CISOBOX;=1&REC;=2 File:Mather Mansion photoright300px http://images.ulib.csuohio.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/press/id/2770 Further adding to this sense of awe and nostalgia is the angle the house sits on. It points the eye back toward an invisible vanishing point that echoes its fine curves. Far from ostentatious in decoration, it is more akin to a library or hotel. The house cannot simply be approached from the street, it must be accessed by a plot of land that is controlled by the university and once had a long inclined driveway leading up from lower-leveled Euclid (please see photo). If the house were still standing within its original landscape environs it would be far more impressive, as modernity has crept up all around the house, it has shrunk in stature and looks anachronistic . ==Hauntings== The mansion was most likely not a terribly happy place for Mather and his young family as his wife's death left a hole, and this may be why some have said the house seems spiritually unsettled. A group of paranormal investigators based in central Ohio started in 1984 called the Ohio Ghost Hunters (OGH) examined the home in 2016, following the renovation of the historic property presumably because someone \\"saw something\\" . The current director of the OGH group, Peggy, led several people on guided tours of the 45-room manor to hunt for spirits and casually asked if any ghosts of the Mather family were present in various rooms, later claiming that she heard a child laughing which is interesting considering that youngest Mather (Philip) would have been over 15 by the time the family settled into the brand new abode . It cannot be independently verified as to the veracity, let alone scientific validity, that she claims to have heard voices in some of the rooms, but this has led to the continuing local Urban Legend that the house has more to tell us about the past than meets the eye. It could even be speculated that this was a publicity stunt designed to increase traffic into the recently reconverted mansion. In any case, the majestic Mather family house can be rented out if anyone cares to test the OGH's theory, should want to conduct private tours, throw a wedding or party there, hold an academic conference, or stay in it and act like royalty . The university has a complete pricing list on their facilities rental site. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Cleveland ==Ref== ==Scholarly Works== * Details the impact of social change on design.. ==External links== *Cleveland Landmarks, as designated by the Cleveland Landmarks Commission Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cleveland, Ohio Category:History of Cleveland ","title":"Mather Mansion"},{"id":"63912083","text":"is a 2020 Japanese anime television series produced by P.A.Works and Aniplex and directed by Yoshiyuki Asai.

She attracted significant attention due to her controversial interracial marriages to two Peranakan Chinese magnates, Lauw Tek Lok, Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi and Sim Keng Koen, Kapitein der Chinezen of Sukabumi. The posts of Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen were high-ranking civil administration positions in the Dutch colonial bureaucracy. Zecha's community leadership, philanthropy, personal bravery and longevity earned her widespread respect and admiration in colonial society by the time she died in 1939. ==Biography== Born in 1848 in Batavia, Java, Francisca Louisa Zecha was the daughter of a Bohemian engraver and adventurer, Josef Zecha. Her first husband, Lauw Tek Lok, was a prominent and wealthy landlord who served as the Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi for 28 years from 1854 until his death in 1882. The couple had five children: Christian Tjeng Soey Lauw-Zecha, Maximiliaan Theodoor Tjeng Kiet Lauw-Zecha, Louis Tjeng Bie Lauw-Zecha, Emilia Joe Nio Lauw-Zecha and Cornelia Sebastiana Gobang Nio Lauw-Zecha. After her first husband's death, Zecha married his former private secretary, Sim Keng Koen, who – after his secretarial employment – had carved out a successful bureaucratic career, having been appointed Luitenant der Chinezen of the Kong Koan (Chinese Council) of Batavia in 1880. They had four children: Sim Tjeng Bouw, Betsy Lembor Nio Sim-Zecha, Piet Tjeng Ho Sim-Zecha and Chester Tjeng Soan Lauw-Sim-Zecha. Zecha's second husband was promoted to the rank of Kapitein in 1887, and kept his post until 1889. In 1892, with the couple having settled in Sukabumi, West Java, the former Kapitein Sim Keng Koen was appointed the first Hoofd der Chinezen of Sukabumi with the rank of Kapitein-titulair der Chinezen. According to the sociologist Mely G. Tan, the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family lived as Sukabumi's premier Chinese family; Tan attributes a great part of the Kapitein's high profile and influence to Zecha's personality. At the end of the nineteenth century, in the face of a violent uprising in Tamboen and in the absence of any Dutch military response, Zecha showed great personal courage. Accompanied by her husband, she rode on horseback to meet directly with the insurgents, whom she addressed in person and talked into surrendering. Zecha subsequently rode on her own to Meester Cornelis to notify the authorities of the surrender, and that no military action was needed. She was well known for her her philanthropy. In 1916, she initiated the installation of a statue of the god Kongco Han Tan Kong at Sukabumi's main Chinese temple, Wihara Widhi Sakti, in order to provide a moral inspiration to the town's Chinese community during an ongoing and persistent cholera epidemic. She also spearheaded more practical measures to address the epidemic at her own expense: she personally led a team of hundreds to prepare ammonia drinks, and had the Great Post Road and the road to Pelabuhan Ratu disinfected with oil. Zecha also raised funds and supplies for outbreaks of famines in China in the early twentieth century, for which she was honoured by the Qing Dynasty authorities. Zecha died in 1939. The historian Theodore Friend relates: 'When the grand dame was dying, she had a gramophone put on the table next to her bed and ordered \\"You don't cry, you play me my favorite Viennese waltzes.\\" Her family kept her body in state over ice for weeks, until friends from all over the world could come to final services.' Zecha's descendants from both of her marriages have maintained their prominence, despite the Revolution of 1945-1950, in Indonesia and the region to this day. Her great-grandson, the hotelier Adrian Lauw-Zecha, is the founder of Aman Resorts, while her granddaughter, the ballerina Che Engku Chesterina, is a princess by marriage of Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia. ==References== Category:1848 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Lauw-Sim- Zecha family Category:Cabang Atas Category:Indonesian people of Czech descent Category:Indo people ","title":"Louisa Zecha"},{"id":"63912734","text":"Lucy Millowitsch (8 November 1905 – 21 June 1990) was a German stage-actress, screen star, stage director/producer, theatre co-owner/manager and dramatist. Later she teamed up with her brother to run the Cologne Millowitsch Theatre, which became known at the time as a venue for \\"popular, low-brow comedies\\". == Life == Lucy Millowitsch was born in Chemnitz. She was born into a long- established theatrical dynasty. Michael Millowitsch, her great-great-great grandfather, had created a successful puppet theatre in Cologne as far back as the late eighteenth century. Her father was the stage actor and theatre impresario Peter Wilhelm Millowitsch (1880–1945). Her mother, born Käthe Planck, came originally from Vienna. Her father's younger sister was the stage and screen performer Cordy Millowitsch. Lucy and her younger brother Willy Millowitsch were appearing on the stage with their father from an early age. In 1936, as the German economy recovered, and after several years without a permanent home for the family theatre company, their father opened a new theatre at the \\"Colonia House\\" building, a one-time dance hall, in Cologne's Aachener Straße, where the family theater company enjoyed great public success over the next few years. Brother and sister formed an effective on-stage partnership. During the later 1930s Lucy Millowitsch started to accept film roles. In 1939 she appeared alongside her aunt Cordy Millowitsch in Kornblumenblau (\\"Corn-flower Blue\\"). Other films in which she appeared included Trenck, der Pandur (Tremck, the Squaddie, 1940), Komödianten (\\"Comedians\\"), 1941), Mein Leben für Irland (\\"My Life for Ireland\\", 1941) and Das große Spiel (\\"The Big Game\\", 1942). However, as the war dragged on she withdrew from her film work to concentrate on the family theatre. Her father died on 14 January 1945. The Millowitsch Theatre was less badly damaged by Anglo-American bombing during World War II than other city venues, and on 16 September 1945 it was re-opened, at the express request of Mayor Konrad Adenauer : \\"Die Leute sollen wieder wat zu lachen haben!\\". The Millowitsch siblings who had formally taken over responsibility for running the theatre, relaunched the venue by staging Das Glücksmädel (loosely, \\"The Lucky Lass\\"). Public success quickly returned, and more well received productions followed. On 27 October 1953 the NWDR (broadcasting company) transmitted a stage production of Etappenhase by Karl Bunje from the Millowitsch Theatre. It was the first time a stage production had been broadcast on German television, and across West Germany it brought nationwide recognition to the theatre and to the company. Willy and Lucy Millowitsch acquired star status as did other lead actors in the production, most notably Elsa Scholten. The 1954 production of \\"Das goldene Kalb\\" (\\"The Golden Calf\\") showcased a play written by Lucy Millowitsch herself. Despite a focus on regional diversification, between 1949 and 1990 Cologne was, by many criteria, the most important and largest home to the West German television network: since 1953 more than 100 plays have been transmitted from the city's Millowitsch Theatre, many of them received with critical and public acclaim. From 1948 Lucy Millowitsch also featured regularly in radio dramas produced down the road at the NWDR studios and (after the NWDR was disaggregated in 1955) with WDR. One example of her radio work was the lead female role which she took, playing alongside Erich Ponto in the 1948 NWDR and the 1962 WDR radio versions of Hans Müller-Schlösser's popular drama piece \\"Schneider Wibbel\\" (\\"Wibbel the Tailor \\"). The success of the theatre during the 1950s enabled Lucy Millowitsch to indulge her taste for international travel. In particular, she became a frequent, visitor to Venezuela, engaging in efforts to improve conditions for ethnic groups who would have been identified in Germany at that time as \\"indigenous Indians\\". Another attraction of the country was that by this time her son Karl Peter (today better known as Pedro Trebbau), by this time in his 20s, was building a career there as a zoologist. In 1960 Lucy Millowitsch married the art collector (and lawyer) Josef Haubrich on 27 April 1960. Although the two of them were both Cologners, it was in Venezuela that they met one another and in Caracas that the marriage ceremony took place. It was Haubrich's fifth (and final) marriage: he suffered a stroke and died unexpectedly in 1961. After the death of her husband Lucy Haubrich-Millowitsch increasingly redirected her attention away from the theatre, despite still being one of West Germany's most popular television actresses. Instead her focus became her late husband's vast artistic estate. Josef Haubrich had been a shrewd and prolific collector of mostly twentieth century paintings. He told an interviewer, \\"I have almost never regretted buying a piece of artwork, but I have sometimes gone on regretting for years one that I did not acquire.\\" The variety and extent of his collection powerfully corroborated that approach: The paintings acquired by Josef Haubrich while he was alive were of lasting interest to art lover after he died: today much of his collection remains on permanent display, notably as the core of the collection in the Museum Ludwig (between the cathedral and the river). In 1979 the Cologne city council even named a new city centre gallery \\"Josef-Haubrich-Kunsthalle\\". (It has subsequently been destroyed as part of a redevelopment project.) Lucy Millowitsch died on 21 June 1990 aged 94 in Cologne. Her physical remains were placed close to the main Millowitsch family grave in the Melaten Cemetery. The physical residua of her late husband and of his third wife, the pediatrician Alice Haubrich- Gottschalk (1892–1944) (a Jewess who died by suicide ahead of a scheduled Gestapo \\"questioning\\") had already, in 1987, been removed from their former resting place in Cologne's massive West Cemetery and placed alongside the space assigned to be occupied by those of Lucy Haubrich-Millowitsch, following her death (\\"Flur 72a\\"). == Filmography (selection) == == Televised stage productions in Millowitsch Theatre (selection) == ==Notes== ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1990 deaths Category:20th-century German dramatists and playwrights Category:Audiobook narrators Category:Businesspeople from Cologne Category:German film actresses Category:German stage actresses Category:People from Chemnitz Category:Actors from Cologne ","title":"Lucy Millowitsch"},{"id":"63912782","text":"Ibudhou Marjing is the God of northeast direction in Manipuri mythology.

In addition to the opium poppy, there are other poppy plants, such as the celandine, in which isoquinoline alkaloids are found. Their latex contains berberine, which also occurs in other plant families, such as the Berberidaceae.A. Husemann, T.

It was adopted on the 03/04/1996 and came into force in 16/09/1996. This act was made so that the UK could be compliant with the 1993 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and their Destruction. Not only that, but it also creates the criminal offence of producing, developing, handling or transferring chemical weapons. This act gives Britain extra territorial jurisdiction in regard to British nationals who are handling such material. This act also applies to Isle of Man, Guernsy and to Jersey. The department of trade and industry acts as a liaison between the UK and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The general interpretation of chemical weapons according to this act is as follows: # \\"Toxic chemicals and their precursors\\" # \\"Munitions and other devices designed to cause death or harm through the toxic properties of toxic chemicals released by them\\" # And finally- \\"equipment designed for use in connection with munitions and devices falling within paragraph (b)\\" Yet there are some exceptions to these rules. For example: the chemical weapons can be used for \\"peaceful purposes\\", \\"purposes related to protection against toxic chemicals\\", \\"legitimate military purposes\\" and \\"purposes of enforcing the law\\". \\"Legitimate military purposes\\" are described as being military purposes, which do not cause harm to people, animals or otherwise harm them.

It is located at a distance of circa 180 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 3393 is about 140,000 light years across. It was discovered by John Herschel on March 24, 1835.NGC 3393 cseligman.com It is a Type II Seyfert galaxy. The galaxy is known to host two supermassive black holes, which are the nearest known pair of supermassive black holes to Earth. == Characteristics == The galaxy is characterised as a barred spiral galaxy. At both ends of the bar HII regions are present. There is also evidence of a fainter inner bar. The fainter outer arms of the galaxy form a nearly complete ring. === Active galactic nucleus === NGC 3393 has been characterised as a Seyfert galaxy, a galaxy category which features bright point-like nuclei. NGC 3393 is a type II Seyfert galaxy. Its X ray spectrum is more consistent with a Compton-thick cold reflection source, which means that the source is hidden behind dense material, mainly gas and dust, and the X-rays observed have been reflected. === Supermassive black holes === The source of activity in the active galactic nuclei is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) lying at the centre of the galaxy. Observations by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory revealed evidence for a pair of supermassive black holes in the centre of NGC 3393. The observation in hard X-rays, including emission from iron, showed two separate peaks, which were identified as black holes that are actively growing, generating X-ray emission as gas falls towards the black holes and becomes hotter. The obscured regions around both black holes block the copious amounts of optical and ultraviolet light produced by infalling material. They are the first pair of black holes found in a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way. The two black holes are separated by only 490 light years. The two black holes in NGC 3393 are likely the remnant of a merger of two galaxies of unequal mass a billion or more years ago. Other evidence that supports the hypothesis of the galaxy merger include high pre-shock densities in the narrow-line region and low O/H and Mg/H abundances. However the N/H is more than predicted, probably due to the creation of Wolf–Rayet stars in the central region of the galaxy during the merger. The total mass of the pair is estimated to be between 21 and 35 million . == Supernova == One supernova has been observed in NGC 3393, SN 2018aqi. The supernova was discovered by ASAS-SN on April 6, 2018, and had an apparent magnitude of 16.4 at discovery. By its spectrum, it was identified as a type Ia supernova 6 days before maximum brightness. == Nearby galaxies == NGC 3393 is the brightest galaxy in the NGC 3393 group, which also includes NGC 3369, NGC 3383, and ESO 501-086. NGC 3463 has also been proposed to be a member of the group.

He was married to Louisa Zecha, the Indo-Bohemian widow of Sim's former employer, Lauw Tek Lok, Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi. Sim began his career as the private secretary of Luitenant Lauw Tek Lok, one of the preeminent Chinese-Indonesian magnates of the second half of the nineteenth century. After leaving Lauw's employ, Sim was appointed Luitenant der Chinezen of the Kong Koan (Chinese Council) of Batavia in 1880. This was a senior civil government post in the Dutch colonial bureaucracy. He was further elevated to the rank of Kapitein in 1887, and was discharged with honour in 1889. Together with his wife, Louisa Zecha, Sim settled down in Sukabumi, a hill station in the Preanger highlands of West Java. In 1892, he was appointed as the first Hoofd der Chinezen of Sukabumi with the rank of Kapitein-titulair der Chinezen. He requested an honourable discharge from the colonial authorities due to old age, which was granted, in 1899. He was eventually succeeded in 1906 as Chinese headman by his step-nephew, Lauw Tjeng Kie, but as Luitenant der Chinezen of Sukabumi (the office was downgraded in rank from Kapitein to Luitenant upon Sim's retirement). The sociologist Mely G. Tan calls Sim the most prominent of Sukabumi's Chinese headmen, in large part thanks to the high profile of his Eurasian wife. In the course of a violent uprising in Tamboen in the late nineteenth century, and in the absence of any Dutch military response, Sim accompanied Zecha to meet with the insurgents in order to negotiate a surrender. They succeeded in this aim without military intervention. The Kapitein's influence in Sukabumi was such that the local Chinese community celebrated Cap Go Meh a few days later so as to coincide with Sim's birthday festivities. Kapitein Sim Keng Koen is the step-great-grandfather of the hotelier Adrian Lauw-Zecha, the founder of Aman Resorts, and the grandfather of the ballerina Che Engku Chesterina, a princess by marriage of Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia. ==References== Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:Lauw-Sim-Zecha family Category:Kapitan Cina Category:Cabang Atas Category:People from Jakarta Category:People from Sukabumi Category:Indonesian landlords ","title":"Sim Keng Koen"},{"id":"63913366","text":"The Morcott Brook, also known locally as \\"The Foss\\", is a small watercourse in Rutland in the East Midlands of England.

The town hall, which is the headquarters of Redbridge London Borough Council, is a Grade II listed building. ==History== In the late 19th century, the local board was based in rooms above a shop in Cranbrook Road, and after it became an urban district in 1895, it moved into a rented schoolroom in Ilford Hall in High Road in 1898. Civic leaders decided this arrangement was inadequate for their needs and that they would procure a new town hall: the site chosen, which was already on the council's ownership, had been occupied by the local fire station. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Councillor Gilson on 17 March 1900. It was designed by Ben Woollard in the Renaissance style and was opened as Ilford Town Hall in December 1901. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto High Road; the central section featured a triple-round-arched entrance on the ground floor; on the first floor there was alcove and a balcony flanked by Ionic order columns; there was a cupola with Ionic order pavilions at each corner at roof level. There were also separate porches on either side at the front of the building giving access to the public hall to the east and the council offices to the west. Internally, the principal rooms were the public hall, the council chamber and the mayor's parlour. The building went on to become the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Ilford when the Duke and Duchess of York arrived to present the Royal charter on 21 October 1926. Also present at the charter ceremony was the Lord Lieutenant of Essex, Lord Lambourne, who was subsequently commemorated when the mayor's refreshment room was re-named in his memory. A library was built to the south to the designs of the borough engineer, H. Shaw, in 1927 and further alterations were carried out, infilling the area between the town hall and the library, to the designs of the then borough engineer, L. E .J. Reynolds, in 1933. The town hall was covered with flags and bunting in May 1945 to celebrate Victory in Europe Day towards the end of the Second World War. The building continued to serve as the headquarters of the municipal borough for much of the 20th century and continued to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Redbridge was formed in 1965. It also continued to be used as a venue for large events and also as the local registrars' office. The former library was converted into an art gallery, known as Space Ilford, which opened in December 2019. The London Borough of Redbridge continues to hold its council meetings in the town hall. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Redbridge Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1901 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Redbridge Town Hall"},{"id":"63913402","text":"John Garnier (26 April 1813 – 26 March 1838) was an English first-class cricketer and clergyman.

It was founded as an oratory in the 10th century, and it eventually became a parish church and was rebuilt in the Romanesque style. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the church intermittently belonged to the Jesuits. They renovated the building in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, but the façade was only completed in 1830. The church was deconsecrated following Italian unification in the 1860s, and it was subsequently used as a cinema and a library. The building was destroyed by aerial bombardment in World War II, and its remains were subsequently demolished. The bell tower and façade had survived the bombing, and the former was retained in situ while the latter was relocated to the church of San Nicolò all'Arena. ==History== An oratory dedicated to Saint Sebastian was established on the site of the church in 932 at the bequest of the deacon Dagiberto. A hospital was located adjacent to the oratory, and it was used to care for priests, pilgrims and the poor. The oratory eventually became a parish church it was rebuilt and enlarged in the Romanesque style. On 8 February 1578, bishop Agostino Valier granted the church and its assets to the Jesuits, and it ceased to be a parish church. The building began to be renovated in 1580 with the reconstruction of its façade. The architect who designed it is unknown. In 1591, the building was still incomplete and the Jesuits asked the Venetian rectors of the city to be able to enlarge the church, and this request was accepted. The Jesuits had to abandon the church in 1606 after Pope Paul V's interdict against the Republic of Venice, and construction of the façade was abandoned at this point. They returned in 1656, and by this time the building was still not completed. The Jesuits were suppressed in 1773 and their assets including the church of San Sebastiano became public property. In September 1774, the city of Verona purchased the church and the college from the Venetian Senate for 30,000 ducats, with the obligation of celebrating mass daily in the building. In 1792, the city established a library known as the within the oratory of the former Jesuit college at San Sebastiano. It included books which had belonged to the Jesuits or to the (which had been suppressed in 1770), along with books donated to the city by Aventino Fracastoro and Antonio Maria Lorgna. The library was opened to the public in 1802. The church's façade after it was relocated to San Nicolò all'Arena in the 1950s The church was deconsecrated during Napoleonic rule and it was used for cultural events, while the convent continued to house the library and a school. The church was reconsecrated during the period of Austrian rule, and in 1830 its façade was completed by the architect using marble which had been set aside for the church but which had not been used due to the interdict of 1606. The Jesuits returned in 1842 and they officially retained the church until 1848, but clandestinely remained there until 1866 when Verona was acquired by the Kingdom of Italy during the Third Italian War of Independence. At this point, the church was deconsecrated once again for the final time. In the early 20th century, the deconsecrated church became a cinema which was known as the Cinema Pathè. By 1939, part of the library moved into the former church. The church was almost completely destroyed by Allied aerial bombardment on 4 January 1945, near the end of World War II. In the 1950s, the façade was relocated to the church of San Nicolò all'Arena and the remains of the church were eventually demolished and replaced by an extension to the library which was designed by the architect Pier Luigi Nervi. This project was approved in 1973 and it was completed in 1980. The bell tower which had survived the war was retained and it still exists today. ==Architecture== The church's bell tower, which is still intact The church had a neoclassical façade with four fluted Ionic columns of a giant order which supported a triangular tympanum. The main doorway was located in the centre, and there were two smaller portals which surmounted by pediments. Above them there were niches and decorations of festoons. The church's bell tower, which is built in the Baroque style, is the only part of the building which still exists in situ. The tower retains the JHS symbol of the Jesuit order and it includes a statue of Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the order. The church's bells no longer exist since they were remelted and used in other churches. ==References== ==Further reading== * Sebastiano Category:Romanesque architecture in Verona Category:Baroque architecture in Verona Category:Neoclassical architecture in Verona Category:17th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1830 Category:Jesuit churches in Italy Category:Cinemas in Italy Category:Former cinemas Category:Destroyed churches in Italy Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1945 Category:Buildings and structures in Italy destroyed during World War II Category:Ruins of churches destroyed during World War II Category:Relocated buildings and structures ","title":"San Sebastiano, Verona"},{"id":"63913700","text":"Helen Andrews (born 1927/28) is a former cryptanalyst and a Chelsea Pensioner at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.

The main roles are played by Félix Maritaud, Nicolas Bauwens, Tommy-Lee Baik, and Ilian Bergala. The film is also known as Jonas and Boys. ==Plot== The plot is written in chronological order while the movie switches continuously between present and past. It's 1997. Fifteen-year- old Jonas doesn't really have friends at school. When the school year starts there is a new pupil in his class: Nathan, who immediately takes Jonas under his wing and they become friends. Nathan has a Nintendo Game Boy and teaches Jonas how to play Tetris and eventually gives him the computer as a gift. The two fall in love and start a relationship. Jonas is allowed by his parents to spend the weekend at Nathan's house. Nathan's mother is heavily pregnant and has already chosen a name for the child: Léonard. She drives the boys to a movie theatre, and on the ride they pass an amusement park called Magic World. Mother reveals to Jonas that Nathan got the scar on his face after an incident at the bumper cars, although Nathan had earlier told Jonas that it was caused by an attack of a pedophile priest. At the end of the movie they just watched Nathan turns on his mobile phone and hears a message left by his mother: she went into hospital to give birth. Instead of going to the hospital, they go to \\"Boys,\\" a local gay bar. As the minimum age is eighteen years they are not allowed in. This is noticed by a man who has an idea: he will bring the boys to another gay bar where there is no age limit. They get in his car but soon Nathan gets suspicious as the ride takes too long and the boys plead with the driver to let them out. The driver punches Nathan and knocks him out. Jonas pulls up the handbrake and is able to escape. The car drives away with a closeup of Nathan – still in the car – and Jonas not knowing whether he is alive or dead. Eighteen years later Jonas is picked up by the police at \\"Boys\\" after a fight. It is clear he is troubled by trauma and is addicted to cigarettes and the game Tetris, which he plays on an outdated Nintendo Game Boy. He goes home where he meets his lover Sam, but Sam breaks their relationship as Jonas keeps cheating on him with other men. Jonas – who does not have another place to stay – heads to a hotel. After a chat with hotel clerk Léonard, Jonas agrees to join him and his friends for some drinks. The next day, Jonas wakes up not remembering where he has been and where he is now. He is surprised to be at Nathan's house. Léonard's mother recognizes Jonas as the friend of her still-missing son Nathan, meaning Léonard is the brother of Nathan. Jonas confesses that he lied on the evening Nathan got kidnapped, telling the police that the kidnapper forced him to leave the vehicle, and not that he had actually escaped on his own and left Nathan behind. Since then he's struggled with the guilt that he should have stayed in the car, or should have tried to rescue Nathan, but he is forgiven by both Nathan's mother, who reminds him that he was only 15, and by Nathan's brother, who points out that if he had stayed in the car, he'd be dead, too. Léonard comes up with a idea about where Jonas can stay, and during the drive there, they pass the Magic World amusement park. Jonas convinces Léonard to stop, and together they go inside. ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.

He employed several pseudonyms including \\"Auguste Pilati Juliano\\", \\"A. P. Juliano\\", \\"Ate. P. Juliano\\", \\"A. Ruytler\\", \\"P. Ruytler\\", and \\"Wolfart\\". He wrote about 40 works for the stage,Riemann Musik-Lexikon (Mainz: B. Schott’s Söhne, 1882), p. 851. including operas, operettas, and ballets besides a very large number of popular songs and piano works.Fétis/Pougin list 26 works with titles as well as places of first performances, see below in \\"Selected works/Stage\\"; François-Joseph Fétis: Biographie universelle des musiciens et bibliographie générale de la musique. Supplement et complement, ed. by Arthur Pougin (Paris: Firmin-Didot et Cie., vol. 2, 1880). ==Career== Born in Bouchain, a small town between Cambrai and Valenciennes in the French département Nord, Pilati studied at the Paris Conservatory where he won a first prize in solfège as early as 1823,Pierre Constant: Le Conservatoire National de musique et de declamation. Documents historiques et administratifs (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1900), p. 830. but from which he was dismissed.Riemann (1882). Arthur Pougin (1880) described him as an \\"extremely fertile composer, whose name is virtually unknown to the public, although he was not without talent\\" (\\"extrêmement fécond, dont le nom est pourtant à peu près inconnu du public, quoiqu'il ne fût point sans talent\\").Fétis/Pougin (1880). He seems to have been able to live mainly from the sale of his own compositions and conducting his stage works, although he also had short-term employments as musical director of small theatres in Paris such as the Théâtre Beaumarchais and the Théâtre des Folies-Marigny, and he often conducted the orchestra of the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin.Fétis/Pougin (1880). He also frequently appeared as a singer or duo partner in the Parisian café-concerts of his day. Pougin considered his music \\"graceful and distinguished\\", but also thought that he \\"overdid himself under poor conditions and ended up sacrificing art to craft\\" (\\"gracieuse et distingué, mais qui s'est trop prodigué, et dans de mauvaises conditions, et qui a fini par sacrifier l'art au metier\\").Fétis/Pougin (1880). In the last fifteen years of his life, Pilati signed his vocal and piano works as either \\"A. P. Juliano\\" or \\"Ate. P. Juliano\\". Among these are a large number of technically easy works intended for children, but also numerous salon works, waltzes, quadrilles etc. intended for showy performance as well as home use.

It is a secondary school sponsored by the Caritas Hong Kong established in 2003, with the current principal Mr. Wong Wai. The school offers the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education course (HKDSE) as a ladder for students to continue their studies. The courses are divided into three major categories, including art and design, Tourism and hospitality, and business, which let students choose more heuristic and multiple disciplinary subjects in addition to regular curriculum. ==History== Mr. Charles Vath was the director of the Hong Kong Catholic Center, and the founder and president of Caritas Hong Kong since 1953. Caritas Hong Kong believes in caring for love and creating hope. Until the 2000s, a group of Form 3 students were taken from every school without promoting to Form 4. Then there were a large number of Form 5 students leaving the school after Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE). Under the past elitism system, students with poor academic performance would be eliminated. These students also had the right to receive education. Hong Kong's support for high school students is quite inadequate. This was also the reason for the appearance of senior high school in those years, which only admit students of Form 4 or above. Caritas Charles Vath College is a DSS high school that was funded by the government in 2003. The school is a senior high school in Hong Kong, which mainly runs Form 4 and above. Before the implementation of the new high school curriculum, the students needed to go through the HKCEE and Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE). During the two public examinations, many students became victims of the system and lost the opportunity to go directly to senior forms in the original school. For the students who intend to continue their studies, Caritas Charles Vath College's senior secondary courses opened up another path. In the past, the school provided a series of one-year professional certificate courses including the HKCEE, the HKALE. After 2012, it changed to provide the HKDSE courses, as well as other courses covering tourism, cosmetology, design, electronics certificate courses. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, classes were suspended and students were confined to distance education. Online learning was performed throughout the school period for all subjects. The emergence of the HKDSE has brought shocks to the school. The school transformed. Starting from the 2020/2021 school year, the school set up junior high form classes. However, the school pays special attention to the purpose of helping the most lost and unsaved students did not change. ==Campus environment== View of the school as seen from country park. The rear side of the school, and a football pitch of YMCA of Hong Kong Christian College. The school is located at North Lantau New Town in Tung Chung, Lantau Island. It is adjacent to Mun Tung Estate and YMCA of Hong Kong Christian College. The school covers an area of about 7,600 square meters. There is an isolated greenhouse in the school campus. In additional to the regular classrooms in the teaching building, the school is equipped with different recreation rooms such as a dancing room, an English corner, a studio and a chapel. Other special rooms include a Cosmetology room, an MMLC, an Art room, an Animation room and an interactive computer room etc. ==School characteristics== ===Practical school=== The school aims to provide comprehensive education and multiple intelligence training. The school curriculum is divided into three categories: art and design, tourism, and business. The school retains some DSE subjects of grammar schools, and also provide some more interesting elective subjects. The curriculum structure is based on students' ability, inspiring their various abilities from different angles, and then affirming their self-worth. And the ultimate goal of creating continuous learning and employment expertise is to achieve lifelong learning. The school offers Experience Based Learning certificate courses, i.e. experiential learning and work-based learning courses such as tourism, design, cosmetology, SOHO digital entertainment, performing arts, consumer electronics, tour guide, leadership, property management, fitness training, social services, web design, hotels and hospitality, women's quality management, manicure, hand-made ornaments, emerging sports, hand-made model skills, fluid dynamics and volunteering, etc. ===Student support=== The positioning of the school is to help the most needy students. The teachers pay special attention to the most helpless and humble students in society. The needs and demands of a group of those people, so- called 3L students, the Last, the Least and the Lost. This group of students has failed to adapt to traditional education and examinations. Compared with students with strong family support, disadvantaged students need more educational power. Every student are equal in morality and academics. Through the core values of Catholic Church, love, righteousness, truth, family and life, the school become a navigator in the lives of others, trigger their potential, and contribute for themselves, family and society. The school has an unwavering determination to fulfill the beliefs of the school sponsoring group, Caritas Hong Kong, and fully experience the mission of serving with love and creating hope. The school has received support from the sponsoring group for years and cared for the community that has not been cared for by the society. The school is convinced that career planning can effectively enhance the competitiveness of students for further studies or employment. Since the beginning of the new education system, the school has been committed to promoting vocational education. Through the experience of vocational education through school sponsoring groups, Caritas Hong Kong, students are provided a new way of further study. The school help them to improve their continuing education and professional development skills, reset their career planning, and continue their studies through regular or Caritas's direct connection ladders and achieve higher personal achievements. ==Transportation== The school can be reached by public by taking a New Lantao Bus of one of the following lines including 3M, 11, 23 and 34 from all districts over Lantau Island, 37, The name of the bus stop is labelled as Hong Kong Christian College though. 38X, 39M from Tung Chung MTR station and B6 from Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge, E21A from Kowloon or E31 from Tsuen Wan.

She is known for her short stories, often dealing with the harsh living conditions of people from southern Sudan, who have endured discrimination and military dictatorship, or war and displacement in the northern part of Sudan. Moreover, she writes about life in her new nation since the independence of South Sudan in 2011. == Personal life and literary work == Having grown up in a neighbourhood of Khartoum before the separation of the southern from the northern part of Sudan, she learned several languages. With her parents from the South, she spoke Latuka, a South Sudanese language, and with other people, Sudanese Arabic. At the University of Khartoum, she studied in English and standard Arabic. - For her stories, she prefers to write in Arabic, which is her language of choice for writing, but not an official language of South Sudan. In an article for the New York Times with Sudanese journalist Isma’il Kushkush, she explained: “I love the Arabic language, and I adore writing in it. It is the linguistic mold that I want to fill my personal stories and culture in, distinguished from that of Arabs.” Futhermore, she explained her reasons of using Arabic like this:“It was important for me that northern Sudanese realize that there was life, values and a people who held a different culture, who needed space to be recognized and respected.” In 2016, her Testimony of a Sudanese Writer was featured in the English literary magazine Banipal's spring edition, entitled Sudanese Literature Today. On the occasion of an exhibition of Sudanese painter Ibrahim el-Salahi at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2019, Gaitano was invited to use el-Salahi’s Prison Notebook as a source of inspiration for creating an original, fictional narrative, and she focussed her story on the Sudanese Revolution of 2018/19. In 2020, her novel Eddo’s Souls was the first South Sudanese story to win the English PEN writers' Translates Award. According to a review on the literary website ArabLit Quarterly, \\"The novel begins across a rural context, in a small impoverished village full of mystery, rituals, and superstition, and it ends in a jam-packed city with all its complications.\\" Since 2012, Gaitano has been living in Juba, the capital of South Sudan.

Axsmith studied the evolutionary history of conifers and vascular plants. He specialized in the Neogene paleobotany of the Gulf Coastal Plain in the present-day United States, especially Alabama and Mississippi, as well as the Mesozoic paleobotany of eastern North America and China. Axsmith was raised in suburban Philadelphia. He received a Bachelor of Science from Millersville University of Pennsylvania. Axmsith obtained his doctorate in biology from the University of Kansas in 1998. Some of Axsmith's most significant discoveries included the fossilized pollen and needles of the eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) in the Gulf Coastal Plain, which is no longer part of the tree's native range. Additionally, Axsmith uncovered the earliest known, post-Eocene fossil record of Carpinus, better known as the hornbeam or ironwood trees, in North America. Axsmith also discovered fossilized Pterocarya wingnuts in the Citronelle Formation in Mobile County, Alabama. Present-day pterocaryas are only found in Asia, but Axsmith's discovery indicated that the species was once found in southeastern North America as well.

It is a collaboration between King's College London, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals and ZOE Global Limited. The purpose of the app is to track symptoms and other salient data in a large number of people to enable epidemiological results to be calculated. ==Background== The idea for an app to track the spread of COVID-19 came from professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King's College London. He used his startup company ZOE Global Limited to build the Covid Symptom Tracker app in collaboration with King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals. Initially the project was UK-based, where there is open membership. In the United States at a later date various cohorts from existing studies were added, including from the Nurses' Health Study; this research was in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital. The project website states that \\"The app is and always will be free, and any data you provide will not be used for commercial purposes.\\" The tracker was released as a trial for 5,000 twins, using patients involved in other Zoe research projects. It was later expanded for use by non-twins. The app entered the UK App Store and Play Store on 24 March, and the US App and Play stores on 29 March. Within 24 hours of being available in the UK, the app had been downloaded over 1 million times. As of May 2020, the app has been downloaded by over 3 million people, including 2 million Britons. By 17 July the number exceeded 4 million. ==Research== The COVID Symptom Study requires users to give their location. Users answer personal information including age, gender and location, and report if they have any underlying chronic conditions. They also answer questions related to common COVID-19 symptoms, and input any illness or symptoms that they have, as well as stating whether they have been tested for COVID-19. The app then uses statistical analysis to predict whether the symptoms are consistent with COVID-19, and is designed to be able to distinguish between COVID-19 symptoms and symptoms of other seasonal flus. The app does not have any contact tracing functionality. Based on the data inputted into the app, the tracker suggests that 2 million people in the UK aged between 20 and 69 may have had COVID-19, and that as of May 2020, 280,000 people in that age range currently have symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The study also estimates the risk level to health workers, compared with the general public. Research based on the app was described in papers in Science on 5 May 2020 and in Nature on 11 May 2020. Using data from the app, researchers were able to identify six distinct types of COVID-19 and forecast which initial symptoms were more likely to lead to severe illnesses. ==See also== * NHS COVID-19 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Software associated with the COVID-19 pandemic apps Category:2020 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom Category:2020 software Category:Android (operating system) software Category:IOS software Category:King's College London ","title":"COVID Symptom Study"},{"id":"63913843","text":"The 2019 Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council election took place on 2 May 2019 to elect members of the Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council in England.https://www.stockton.gov.uk/stockton-council/elections-and- voting/local-election-results-2019/#BC It was held on the same day as other local elections. ==Results summary== ==Ward results== ===Billingham Central=== ===Billingham East=== No UKIP candidate as previous (-22.0). ===Billingham North=== ===Billingham South=== No BIA candidate as previous (-9.5). ===Billingham West=== ===Bishopsgarth & Elm Tree=== ===Eaglescliffe=== No UKIP candidate as previous (-13.3). ===Fairfield=== ===Grangefield=== ===Hardwick & Salters Lane=== ===Hartburn=== ===Ingleby Barwick East=== ===Ingleby Barwick West=== ===Mandale & Victoria=== ===Newtown=== ===Northern Parishes=== ===Norton North=== ===Norton South=== ===Norton West=== ===Parkfield & Oxbridge=== ===Roseworth=== ===Stainsby Hill=== ===Stockton Town Centre=== ===Village=== ===Western Parishes=== ===Yarm=== ==References== Category:2019 English local elections Category:May 2019 events in the United Kingdom 2019 Category:2010s in North Yorkshire ","title":"2019 Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council election"},{"id":"63913855","text":"Sir Abdur Rahman: Judge on the Supreme Court of Pakistan Sir Mohammad Abdur Rahman (1888–1962) was a lawyer and judge from Pakistan born in Delhi, India.

Hedbergia longiflora groups with Hedbergia decurva and Hedbergia abyssinica into a Hedbergia clade nested within the core Rhinantheae. These three taxa share evolutionary affinities with genera Tozzia, Bellardia, Neobartsia, Parentucellia, and Odontites. == References == Category:Hedbergia ","title":"Hedbergia longiflora"},{"id":"63913895","text":"The article lists Vietnam's province-level divisions by Gross regional domestic product (GRDP).

The battery was constructed between March 1890 and August 1894 at a cost of £4,963. It was located between Hawkins Battery and due-east of Maker Farm, on sloping land facing the sea. The battery was positioned to prevent ships lying at anchor off Cawsand Bay and to support Picklecombe Fort guarding the approaches to Plymouth Sound. It mounted two 10-inch Breech Loading (BL) guns, one on an Elswick Ordnance Company barbette mounting, the other on a Royal Carriage Department barbette mounting. The gun positions were served by underground magazines which were linked by a tunnel that slopes down underneath a central earth traverse. There was one magazine to the north of the tunnel and two cartridge stores (each with its own serving hatch) to the south. Each gun emplacement had a store, cartridge recess, a shell recess and a shelter for the gun crew, all built into the concrete gun apron. To the right of the right-hand gun emplacement was a water catchment area and tank. The caretaker’s office was on the opposite side which consisted of two bedrooms, a living room and a scullery. In between both of these were two Depression range finders enabling the guns to accurately fire at their targets. Behind the left hand emplacement was an oil store. The battery was surrounded by an iron pallisade fence. There was no barrack accommodation at the battery.The National Archives WO78/4248, War Office: Maps and Plans - Plymouth, Raleigh Battery: plans, sections, etc. 20.6.1901 The battery was one of very few to mount 10-inch guns, as by the 1890s British Coast Artillery armament was standardised on the 9.2-inch Breech Loading (BL) gun.

He was also mentioned in Byzantine Greek historian John Kinnamos' history book covering years 1118–1176. The first certain mention was 1154 regarding the Byzantine- Hungarian war, with engagements in the Danube area, where he was described as taking part in the conflict on the side of Hungarian force, as Hungarian vassal and the ban of Bosnia. Kinnamos described Borić as \\"exarch (governor) of the land/country of Bosnia\\". It is uncertain how and when Borić came to rule Bosnia. According to Vladimir Ćorović, he was not a native Bosnian; his homeland is taken to have been central Slavonia. As Hungary became the overlord of Bosnia in the 1130s, it is most likely that Borić was appointed governor in Bosnia as a Hungarian vassal, and was obliged to participate in the march on Braničevo. Ban Borić had two sons named Borić and Pavao. Borić Borićević and Pavao Borićević had sons named Odola, Čelk and Borić. The extended family also included Detmar and Benedikt (also called Borić).

He was the first Coast Guardsman to become a prisoner of war since the War of 1812 and the only Coast Guardsman to be captured during World War II and since. == Early life and career == Thomas Crotty was born on March 18, 1912, in Buffalo, New York. Crotty attended the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, where he excelled amongst his peers. Prior to graduation in 1934, he served as the captain of the football team and the class president during his senior year. For the next six years, Crotty served aboard various Coast Guard cutters based out of various locations all over the United States. He was first assigned to the USCGC Tampa based out of Staten Island, New York. On September 8, 1934, a fire broke out aboard the ocean liner SS Morro Castle off of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. Crotty and the rest of the crew of the USCGC Tampa participated in the rescue efforts during the disaster. Crotty was also assigned cutters based out of Seattle, Washington; Alaska, where he had a Justice Department appointment as a special deputy on the Bering Sea Patrol; and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. In April 1941, Crotty reported to the United States Navy's Mine Warfare School in Yorktown, Virginia. He subsequently attended additional training at the Mine Recovery Unit in Washington, D.C., which made him the top Coast Guard expert in mine operations, explosives and demolition. == World War II == === Philippines campaign === On October 28, 1941, Crotty arrived at Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines, where he was assigned to the In-Shore-Patrol Headquarters to assist the Navy in building the Manila Bay minefield. On December 7, 1941, Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered World War II. Several hours later, across the International Date Line on December 8, Japanese troops invaded the Philippines. On December 10, Japanese aircraft bombed Cavite Navy Yard, damaging many of the facilities. Crotty was the only Coast Guardsman stationed in the Philippines and consequently the only Coast Guardsman to participate in the Philippines campaign. As American troops began retreating to the Bataan Peninsula and the island of Corregidor, Lieutenant Crotty supervised the demolition of strategic facilities and equipment to prevent them from being captured by the Japanese. He also supervised the scuttling of the USS Sealion on December 25, before falling back to Fort Mills on Corregidor. Crotty continued returning to Cavite on night raids to destroy additional equipment before the area was occupied by the enemy. From February to March 1942, Crotty served as the executive officer of the USS Quail. The USS Quail provided Naval gunfire support to American and Filipino troops at Bataan, shot down Japanese aircraft, and swept mines to allow the evacuation of critical personnel by American submarines. On April 9, the Japanese captured Bataan. The guns aboard the USS Quail were cannibalized and moved to Corregidor, while the ship was scuttled on May 5. Lieutenant Crotty was in command of a 75mm shore battery manned by a mixed group of Marine and Army artillerymen. By May 6, the 75mm guns were overrun by the enemy and all of the defenders on Corregidor were captured by Japanese forces. Crotty became the first member of the Coast Guard to be held as a prisoner of war since the War of 1812. === Prisoner of war === Crotty and his fellow prisoners were held on Corregidor for several weeks, where they were placed on starvation diets. They also were required to bow to any Japanese soldier they crossed paths with, and would be beaten for various reasons, sometimes for no apparent reason at all. On May 24, the POWs were loaded onto landing barges and transported to Manila, where they were forced to march in a Japanese \\"Victory Parade\\" through the city. The POWs were then packed into cattle cars and transported to the Cabanatuan prisoner of war camp. Many of the POWs did not survive the journey, and the conditions at the camp were abhorrent, as it was lacking medical supplies and other essential items. Crotty was remembered as being optimistic given the circumstances, however, he contracted diphtheria when an epidemic swept through the camp in the summer of 1942. Due to the lack of medical care, 40 prisoners died every day, including Thomas Crotty who died on July 19, 1942. He was buried in Common Grave 312. Nearly 3,000 POWs died at Cabanatuan. == Post-war identification attempts == After the war, the 111th Quartermaster Graves Registration Platoon dug up the mass grave Crotty was buried in, identifying a dozen men using military IDs, dental records, and other evidence. The platoon was unable to identify many of the dead, including Crotty, whose remains were labeled \\"Unknown X-2858 Manila #2 Cemetery.\\" In 1948, Crotty's remains passed through the Manila Mausoleum and Central Identification Point, but were still unable to be identified. On August 8, 1949, Crotty was declared non- recoverable, and in 1952 his remains were buried in the Manila American Cemetery. His name was also put on the Walls of the Missing. == Identification of remains == In 2009, Thomas Crotty's grand nephew, Michael Kelly, in an attempt to identify Crotty's remains, reached out to the DOD agency responsible for recovering missing military personnel, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA). In 2017, the DPAA had Crotty's and other unknown remains disinterred and flown to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii. The DPAA declared that \\"Unknown X-2858 Manila #2 Cemetery\\" was Thomas Crotty on September 10, 2019. The Armed Forces Medical Examiner System helped identify Crotty using DNA samples from his great-nephews and great-nieces. Crotty's remains were subsequently flown back to his hometown of Buffalo, arriving at Niagara Falls Air Force Base on November 1. Andrew Cuomo, the Governor of New York, ordered all state government buildings to fly their flags at half mast in honor of Crotty. A funeral service was held at St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic Church in Buffalo on November 2, 2019. Among those attending his funeral was Admiral Karl M. Schultz, the Commandant of the Coast Guard. Thomas Crotty was permanently buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Lackawanna, New York. == References == Category:1912 births Category:1942 deaths Category:American Coast Guard personnel killed in World War II Category:American prisoners of war in World War II Category:Military personnel from Buffalo, New York Category:United States Coast Guard Academy alumni Category:United States Coast Guard officers Category:United States Coast Guard personnel of World War II Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Japan ","title":"Thomas Crotty"},{"id":"63914312","text":"ʻAta island. The Tongan castaways were a group of six boys between 13 and 16, who, in 1965, ran away from a school on the island of Tonga, stole a boat, and became shipwrecked on the deserted remote island of Ata. The Tongan castaway boys formed a strong bond and, despite deprivations and injuries, kept themselves fit and healthy for 15 months. The boys survived primarily through consumption of local birds, fish, wild taro, and chickens and bananas that had been raised and cultivated on the island 100 years prior. They captured rainwater using hollowed out logs, though it was sparse during the initial months of their survival. They drank blood from seabirds when they didn't have enough water. They were discovered in 1966 by Australian fisherman Peter Warner and returned with him to Tonga, where they were immediately imprisoned for the theft of the boat. The boys were released from prison after Warner compensated the owner of the stolen boat the boys had sailed on, and arranged for them to participate in a film for Australian media. In 2015 Spanish explorer Alvaro Cerezo spent 10 days on Ata island with Kolo Fekitoa, one of the six teenage castaways. They both lived there all alone and survived from coconuts, fish and seabirds, exactly as the boys did back in 1965. In summer 2020, Cerezo is launching a documentary of his experience with Kolo and a book describing in detail the 15 month ordeal of the Tongan castaways. A teaser of the documentary has been already published on Youtube In 2020, historian Rutger Bregman published a book about their experiences titled Humankind. == References == ==External links== * .

The family was loyal to the Karađorđević dynasty which is why Vladimir's father Dimitrije \\"Mita\\" had to emigrate from Serbia following the return to the throne of the Obrenović dynasty in 1858. While abroad, Dimitirje's father was the secretary of Prince Alexander Karađorđević. During this time, young Vladimir remained in Serbia and began studying law but after the assassination of Prince Mihailo Obrenović in 1868, he had to leave the country because of the unfavourable situation for the families loyal to the Karađorđević dynasty. He continued studying law in Vienna. He took part in the founding of the United Serbian Youth in 1870. While abroad, he was in the socialist circles around Svetozar Marković. His socialist feelings in his youth are evident as he was the first to translate The Communist Manifesto into Serbian, published in 1871 in the newspaper Pančevac. He returned to Serbia after the abdication of King Milan I on 22 February 1889. When Sava Grujić formed a government led by the People's Radical Party in 1890, Ljotić became the Serbian consul in Thessaloniki. After his diplomatic service, he continued working in politics as the president of the Municipality of Smederevo and as a member of parliament. He was one of the deputies who in Geneva in 1903 publicly called on King Peter I to inherit the Serbian throne. From 1904 to 1909, he was again the consul in Thessaloniki. He died on 27 July 1912 and is interred near the Serbian Orthodox church at the Smederevo Old Cemetery.D. Subotić, Delatnost Vladimira Ljotića u oslobađanju srpskog naroda u Turskoj do 1909. godine.

(1984–2000) and deputy mayor of Naxxar (1992–2000). ==Early life== Described by Armstrong and Mitchell as \\"a wealthy individual from a patrician background with a love of football\\", \\"fast-talking, ebullient and indiscreet\\", \\"diminutive yet confident\\", Michael Zammit Tabona is the son of an entrepreneur who established Malta's second hotel in British colonial times, with a distant family connection to Lord Mountbatten. Michael attended St. Edward's College, where he was a difficult boarding pupil, then studied languages and hotel management in Switzerland. In 1973, at 21, he was back in Malta, managing a hotel from the family properties. He also started purchasing second-hand vessels and renting them for advertising to the Captain Morgan rum company; he later retained the brand for a new cruising company, today among the leading ones in Malta. Zammit Tabona led the development of package holidays for British tourists to Malta in the 1970s and 1980s, catering to up to 30,000 holidaymakers annually. In the 1990s he opened a sea-front hotel in Sliema, offering spa treatment and sport therapies. Global and Local Football: Politics and Europeanization on the Fringes of the EU , by Gary Armstrong, Jon P. Mitchell, Routledge 2008 He also held shared of Manchester United and had good connections in the board of directors of the British football club. == Presidency of Naxxar F.C. == In 1984 Zammit Tabona bought a palace in Naxxar; he went on to become President of the local FC Naxxar football club, bringing it from third division to the Maltese premiere league, thanks to an influx of former British players, including Paul Mariner, David Johnson, Paul O'Berg, as well as coach Simon Lane. Naxxar F.C. also became a cradle for Maltese- Nigerian football players. In 1987 he invited Manchester United F.C. to play a friendly match with Naxxar F.C., which became a local feat, right the day before the 1987 Maltese general election; the sources of financing for the 3-days event have remained disputed since. Zammit Tabona's Naxxar F.C. got embroiled in a dispute with the Malta Football Association around match- fixture, with Zammit Tabona claiming to denounce such fixture to the media. Naxxar F.C. was relegated two divisions and Zammit Tabona was suspended from the club presidency (which was offered to his wife), until he was reinstated two years later. Naxxar F.C. earned its budget of 35,000 Maltese lira per year from the income of the club bar in the village square, as well as control of parking lots at the annual trade fair, and supporters' club barbeques. Zammit Tabona is reported to have personally invested in the club 40 to 50,000 Lm per season, including for the wages and accommodation of foreign players. After having got at best second behind Valletta F.C., Zammit Tabona resigned in April 2000. His football exploits landed Zammit Tabona a post as deputy mayor of Naxxar, as an independent, for eight year, from 1992 to 2000, during which he bult a park and a five-a-side football pitch. He then left the post in the local council to his 18-year-old daughter. He is considered close to the Malta Labour Party since the time of the premiership of Alfred Sant. == Business entreprises in the 2010s == In the 2010s, Zammit Tabona owned via his Fortel group the Fortina Hotel, The Terrace restaurant, the Captain Morgan Cruises, the sightseeing city buses, Malta’s biggest hotel cleaning service and a company that imports wines and spirits. His name is connected to 42 legal entities in Malta. Fortel is considered to have strong connections to the ruling Labour Party - prime minister Joseph Muscat's also held birthday parties at Zammit Tabona's The Village Kitchen restaurant. Lands Authority CEO James Piscopo also held shares in businesses with the Zammit Tabona family. A donor to the Labour Party, after the 2013 elections Zammit Taboona was rewarded with a diplomatic post as non-resident ambassador to Finland. He kept posting racist and xenophobic memes, as well as links to fear-mongering articles, on his Facebook profile. He resigned on 10 May 2020 after a public post comparing Angela Merkel to Adolf Hitler.Times of Malta, 10 May 2020 The Fortina Hotel also had its lease on a big tract of land on the Tigné Seafront controversially changed from solely tourism to a mixed-use development, with the approval of the government, and further plans to extend some 180 square meters into Malta’s waters for their shoreside Fortina Lido. Zammit Tabona’s cooperative was also awarded by Transport Malta the exclusive rights to the jetties in Ċirkewwa, Blue Lagoon, and Santa Marija Bay. His company also won the tender for the proposed Gozo fast ferry, which was later shot down by the Public Contracts Review Board because of irregularities. In late 2019, Zammit Tabona also unsuccessfully bid for the presidency of St Julian's water polo club, which stands next to the location where his Fortel group would like to build a jetty for hop-on-hop-off cruises. In May 2020, Zammit Tabona's Captain Morgan boats were chartered by the Maltese government to lodge migrants on board outside Malta’s territorial waters for a cost of some €10,000 a day. The Maltese government insisted such costs be covered by the European Union. Zammit Tabona resigned in May 2020 after comparing German chancellor Angela Merkel to Adolf Hitler. ==References== Category:Maltese diplomats Category:Maltese businesspeople Category:Ambassadors of Malta to Finland Category:Living people Category:1950 births ","title":"Michael Zammit Tabona"},{"id":"63914597","text":"ELAC MM-cartridge ELAC 310 with JET-tweeter ELAC is a German loudspeaker manufacturer.

She was an early director of what is now the charity Mind, but was then the National Association for Mental Health (NAMH). She was involved when Christian Aid was formed, she saw off the Church of Scientology in court and was involved with the changes required to move to care in the community. ==Life== Applebey was born in Mortlake in 1916. She was educated in Oxford, graduating in languages at St. Annes College. By then she had met her lifelong partner Edith Agnes (Ad) Leathart. She was fluent in French and German so with her second class degree she joined the war department in 1938. After the war the destruction in Germany included the many people who were displaced and hungry amongst the chaos there. Applebey was there for a year employed by the Allied Control Commission in Berlin. She became involved with various Irish and British church organisations who were uniting to alleviate the problem. This became the charity Christian Aid and Appleby became one of its directors. Appleby took over as director of the National Association for Mental Health (NAMH) in 1951. The first director was Ms M C Owen and from 1947 the medical director was Dr Alfred Torrie. These roles were combined for her. The National Association for Mental Health (NAMH) was created in 1946Jones (2003), p. 201 from three voluntary organisations that provided services for the \\"maladjusted, emotionally disturbed or mentally handicapped to any degree.\\"Malin, Race & Jones (1980), pp. 151–152 The organisations were the Central Association for Mental Welfare (CAMW), the National Council for Mental Hygiene (NCMH) and the Child Guidance Council (CGC). In 1969, numerous Scientologists joined the NCMH and attempted to ratify as official policy a number of points concerning the treatment of psychiatric patients. When their identity was realised they were expelled from the organisation en masse. The Church of Scientology in 1971 unsuccessfully sued the NAMH over the matter in the High Court. The case was resisted by Appleby and the NCMH and the case became notable in British charity law.Rolph (1973) During the 1970s the NCMH became involved with the debate raised by Ann Shearer that mental hospitals should be shut. Shearer, a Guardian journalist, was joined by Anita Hunt of the Spastics Society and an architect named Sandra Franklin to create the Campaign for the Mentally Handicapped (CMH). They estimated that there were 8,000 mentally handicapped children and they and parent groups wanted this to end. They lobbied the NCMH but Applebey resisted their central objective although they offered support in other areas. Applebey wanted to avoid the hospital v. community debate, but she saw the hospital as a focus for the support. She thought that mental handicap should attract separate government funding. Her lifelong partner Edith died in 2004. Applebey died in 2012 after a fall at her home in Chelsea. ==References== ===Sources=== * * * Category:1916 births Category:2012 deaths Category:People from the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:Civil servants from London ","title":"Mary Applebey"},{"id":"63914663","text":"376x376px The Princely Grave of Rodenbach () is a Celtic burial mound, dating to the 5th century BC, located near Rodenbach, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

Visitors to the site today can view a restoration of both the mound and the burial chamber, equipped with replicas of the original artifacts. == History of the site == === Discovery === In the summer of 1874, objects made of clay and metal that had clearly belonged to a princely Celtic burial site began to turn up near one of two the so-called \\"giant graves\\" near the village of Rodenbach. Measuring over 4 meters high and 30 meters long, this grave suffered heavy damage by local residents who were trying using the site as a source of \\"fertilizer\\" and sand, while another grave near Weilerbach remained largely intact.G. Scheuermann, Rodenbach - Die Geschichte eines Dorfes (Bonn 1976) === Excavation === The grave in Rodenbach had previously been recorded as being covered with smooth stones with a column-like stone on top. Both these limited descriptions pre-dating the exploitation by locals as well as the richness of the finds date the mound to slightly before 400 BC.H.-J. Engels, Der Fürstengrabhügel von Rodenbach, Bonner Hefte der Vorgeschichte Nr. 3 (Bonn 1972) The excavation of the gravesite in 1874 yielded many fine artifacts including: a bandle and a ring made of gold, four complete bronze vessels and the handle of a fifth, a clay vessel, a bronze belt buckle, four small bronze rings as well as a sword, three lance tips, and a hewing knife made of iron. These artifacts were found lying \\"together - seemingly right in the middle of the mound\\" under a large sandstone which in turn was covered with the mound's fill. All artifacts from the site are located today in the Historical Museum of the Palatinate in Speyer. This princely grave and the gravesites of other Celtic nobles are distinguished by the construction of a large burial mound on removed, elevated ground with a burial chamber of both wood and stone where the honored dead were placed surrounded by objects to be taken with them into the afterlife.A. Haffner, Die westliche Hunsrück-Eifel- Kultur (Bonn 1976) === Restoration === In honor of Rodenbach's 700th anniversary, the grave and the burial chamber underwent reconstruction and restoration in 2000.

Between 1845 and 1861, Lauw held various pachten or revenue farms, including for pawn houses, slaughterhouses, fish and – in particular – for gambling, over which he intermittently acted as Hoofdpachter or head revenue farmer. The pacht or revenue farm was a system of tax collection, in which the Dutch colonial authorities outsourced tax collection to the highest bidding revenue farmers. Together with Gouw Kang Soei, Tan Ling, Khouw Siong Bo and Tan Kong Boen, Lauw was also part of the Ngo Ho Tjiang partnership or kongsi, which dominated the opium pacht – the most lucrative of all the revenue farms. The proceeds from revenue farming made Lauw one of the wealthiest tycoons in the Dutch East Indies. Despite his vast wealth, Lauw's application for an honorary appointment as Luitenant-titulair der Chinezen did not succeed, probably because he did not come from an established family of Chinese officers. The Chinese officership was a very prestigious and senior civil government post in the Dutch colonial bureaucracy. Lauw did, however, serve in the bureaucracy in a lesser capacity as Wijkmeester, or ward master, of Meester Cornelis. Before Lauw died in 1863, however, he had the satisfaction of seeing his two sons, Lauw Tek Kang and Lauw Tek Lok, raised to the Chinese officership on December 23, 1854 as Luitenants der Chinezen, of their father's old district of Meester Cornelis and neighbouring Bekasi respectively. These appointments signalled the elevation of Lauw's family to the ranks of the Cabang Atas. Through Luitenant Lauw Tek Lok, Lauw Ho is the great-great-grandfather of the hotelier Adrian Lauw-Zecha, founder of Aman Resorts. ==References== Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:Lauw-Sim-Zecha family Category:Cabang Atas Category:Pachter Category:People from Jakarta ","title":"Lauw Ho"},{"id":"63914850","text":"Nasr-e Basir(, \\"Clear Victory\\") is an Iranian Indigenous Smart Low-observable anti-ship cruise missile unveiled on 24 August 2014 in a defense exhibition in Tehran along with Ghadir missile, Karrar-4 MALE UAV and Mohajer-4 UAV. == References == ==See also== * Noor * Khalij Fars * Hormoz-2 Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 2014 Category:Anti-ship cruise missiles Category:Anti-ship missiles of Iran Category:Cruise missiles of Iran Category:Anti-ship missiles Category:Cruise missiles Category:Guided missiles of Iran Category:Anti-ship cruise missiles of Iran ","title":"Nasr-e Basir"},{"id":"63914860","text":"Brian Cunningham may refer to: * Brian Cunningham (footballer) (born 1952), Australian rules footballer * Brian Cunningham (hurler) (born 1970), Irish hurler * Brian T.

Abalgamash ( a-ba-al- ga-masz) was a king of Marhashi (\\"Parahshum\\" in Akkadian) circa 2370 BCE, somewhere on the Iranian plateau. He seems to have led the forces of Elam, Marhashi, Kupin, Zahara and Meluhha into a coalition against the Akkadian Empire, invading Khuzestan, which had been occupied by Sargon of Akkad. This led to a direct conflict with Rimush, Sargon's son and successor, who in turn invaded Elam, and victoriously confronted their armies somewhere between Awan and Susa. Abalgamash appears in the records of the Rimush, the ruler of the Akkadian Empire at the time, who led victorious campaigns against Elam and Marhashi (Sumerian name for the Akkadian \\"Parahshum\\"). According to the account, troops from the Indus Valley Civilization (Meluhha) also participated in the conflict: The campaign resulted in 16,212 killed on the side of the enemies, and 4,216 prisoners. Rimush also came back with an important booty taken from Elam, consisting in 300 minas of gold (about 180 kilograms), 3600 minas of silver, 300 slaves, and vases of diorite and chlorite. These events apparently put an end to the influence of Marhashi in Elam. Abalgamash had a general named Sidgau, who is also known to have been in conflict against Sargon of Akkad, the father of Rimush, when Sargon led his campaign against Elam and Marhashi.

His older brother was Hermann Scheper, who was born on 3 April 1842.Landesarchiv Thüringen - Hauptstaatsarchiv Weimar, Staatliches Bauhaus Weimar, No. 146 1920 self- written curriculum vitae of Hermann Scheper p. 205 At the age of 7 Hinnerk was enrolled in the Protestant Volksschule in Wulften in 1904. After finishing school in 1912, he began an apprenticeship as a painter with Gustav Nehmelmann. With the simultaneous attendance of a further education school in nearby Osnabrück, Hinnerk expanded his knowledge in the subjects drawing and mathematics. In 1915, after successful completion of his journeyman's examination, he found his first job in Quakenbrück with painter Rudolf Engel and in 1916 he worked in the post office in Badbergen, as his master received a military service obligation to a shipyard in Bremen. In the preceding period Hinnerk managed to sell two of his paintings he had painted himself and used the money to buy his first camera. He developed the photos in his self built darkroom. == The time at the Bauhaus == From 1918 to 1919 he attended the School of Arts and Crafts (majoring in photography) in Düsseldorf and Bremen. From 1919 to 1922 he studied at the Bauhaus in Weimar in the preliminary course of Johannes Itten and Paul Klee as well as mural painting with Itten and Oskar Schlemmer. Hinnerk Scheper passed his master examination as a painter. In the same year he married his fellow student Lou Berkenkamp. From 1922 to 1925 Scheper worked as a mural painter and colour designer, also for buildings in Weimar and Münster. From 1925, Scheper headed the workshop for mural painting at the Bauhaus in Dessau, succeeding Wassily Kandinsky, until the final closure of the Bauhaus by the National Socialists in 1933.Bersenbrücker Kreisblatt Also a Badberger influenced the Bauhaus Memories of Hinnerk Scheper and his work at the art school in Weimar Article 22 October 2019 by Alexandra Lüders Hinnerk Scheper his wife Lou === The “Bauhaus Wallpaper” === Three patterns of the Bauhaus Wallpaper, Bauhaus exhibition Niedersächsischer Landtag Under the leadership of director Hannes Meyer, who succeeded Walter Gropius on 1 April 1928, a group was appointed to develop designs for the Bauhaus Wallpaper Collection; they were Hinnerk Scheper, Ludwig Hilberseimer, Josef Albers and Joost Schmidt. Hinnerk organized a design competition for the wallpaper patterns among his students in the mural painting workshop.With subversive glamour: Max Bill and his time. 1908-1939 Angela Thomas Verlag Scheidegger & Spiess, 2008 - 575 pages S. 184 (restricted view) Through Maria Rasch, sister of Emil Rasch, co-owner of the Wallpaper Factory Gebrüder Rasch in Bramsche, the production of the Bauhaus patterns was stimulated. The collection comprised 14 patterns, each with 5 to 15 colour variations, each with a structured, small-scale design that could be processed free of waste. After initial difficulties, the wallpaper became a complete economic success and through constant modernisation, the patterns also outlasted the Bauhaus closure up to today's Rasch range.Hanna Elisabeth Koch: \\"Beauty has a new meaning today\\" - On West German design of the 1950s using the example of the wallpaper industry, 2014, dissertation, p. 22 and p. 25 (PDF) == The Time in Moscow == Basil-cathedral-morning From 1929 to 1931, Scheper was on leave from the Bauhaus to work in Moscow, the Soviet Union capital to set up and manage a state consulting centre for colour design with associated teaching activities for the entire Soviet Union. Mrs Lou accompanied him to Moscow and supported him during this time. In addition, Scheper taught at the School of Design WChUTEIN’. At the same time he created photo series about people and architecture in the Soviet Union.

After 1934 he was engaged in freelance artistic work, colour design and restoration work. In 1934 the National Socialists refused Hinnerk the membership in the \\"Reichsverband der Deutschen Presse\\" (Association of the German Press). From 1942 to 1945 Scheper did military service in Germany. === After World War II === Forest Cemetery Zehlendorfer Hinnerk und Lou Scheper In 1945, the Berlin magistrate appointed him head of the Office for the Preservation of Monuments and Urban Planning and as State Conservator of Berlin. In the same year, he was one of the rescuers of the Neue Wache in Berlin, as was the architect and curator of monuments Selman Selmanagić in 1949.Memories of Kurt Reutti (1900-1967), a German sculptor and art collector LII. Die Neue Wache DFG-Viewer p. 355-361 Die Bauwerke und Kunstdenkmäler von Berlin Supplement 40 (PDF) p. 9 Preface During the division of Berlin, Scheper protested unsuccessfully against the eviction of the Berlin City Palacees by the German People's Police in October 1948.Although an official commission had declared it not to be in danger of collapsing the day before. One of Scheper's departments in the castle was also affected. For this and the following see Renate Petras: The Palace in Berlin. From the revolution of 1918 to the destruction in 1950 Verlag für Bauwesen, Berlin/ München 1992, p. 108f. The hopeless struggle against the demolition of the palace, which was being pursued by the East Berlin magistrate, caused him and the director of the Berlin Palace Department, Margarete Kühn to move their offices to West Berlin. In 1951, Hinnerk attracted attention as an expert witness in an expert commission consisting of Professor Richard Sedlmaier from Kiel, Professor Günther Grundmann and Dr. jur. Günter Scheefe from Hamburg. The commission unmasked the forgeries in the Marienkirche of Lübeck.Kunstchronik, Volume 5H.

Hinnerk, like in the period up to the beginning of the war, remained responsible for its colour scheme. From 1952/53 the Rasch company modernised the collection and oriented itself towards Scandinavian designs. From 1952 Scheper held a teaching position for the preservation of historical monuments at the Technical University Berlin and from 1953 he held the title of Government Director. Hinnerk Scheper died on May 5, 1957 in Berlin. The couple's grave is in the forest cemetery Zehlendorf. == Family == On December 22, 1922 he married his wife Lou, née Hermine Luise Berkenkamp in the city church St. Peter and Paul in Weimar.

The German inventor Joseph Gaertner, a doctor and botanist who lived in the 18th century and dedicated his life to the study of natural history, is considered its inventor. When the discipline is applied to archaeological remains, it is known as paleocarpology, which in turn is located within paleobotanical science. Carpology would have, finally, from the results obtained from the study of the fruits and seeds obtained in one place, two objectives: the first, to reconstruct the evolution of a certain plant species; and, the second, to recreate what the landscape was like and, therefore, its flora and fauna. For the data that this discipline is capable of obtaining, it is considered \\"auxiliary\\" for others such as archeology . Among other things, carpology can distinguish between indigenous seeds of an area and those that have been domesticated for human cultivation. From here, a reconstruction of the landscape flora can be extrapolated, always bearing in mind how destructive anthropic action is. Currently there are numerous research centers with carpology departments. France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium or Germany are the European states with the longest history of this discipline. Despite this, there are also teams and personnel dedicated to carpology in Spain or Italy. It is an expanding science. Currently, many of these teams are carrying out research work in different places such as Syria, Lebanon, Algeria or Tunisia. These works linked to archeology with very satisfactory results in terms of the recovered carpological materials, ruin the ancient theories that affirmed that it was a science limited to wetlands due to conservation. == References == * ALONSO, N., \\"De la llavor a la farina: els processos agrícoles protohistòrics a la Catalunya Occidental, MAM 4, Lattes, Association pour la recherche archeologique en Languedoc oriental, 1999 * BUXÓ, R. y PIQUÉ, R., \\"La recogida de muestras en arqueobotánica: objetivos y propuestas metodológicas\\", Barcelona, 2003. * BUXÓ, R., \\"Arqueología de las plantas.

The paths drawn represent the series of equilibrium states occupied by the system, except during the detonation process, (step 0 to 1), the system is temporarily non-uniform. Nevertheless, the beginning and at the end of the detonation process is uniform. The Fickett–Jacobs cycle is a conceptual thermodynamic cycle that allows to compute an upper limit to the amount of mechanical work obtained from a cycle using an unsteady detonation process (explosive). The Fickett–Jacobs (FJ) cycle is based on Chapman–Jouguet (CJ) theory, an approximation for the detonation wave’s velocity during a detonation.Wintenberger, E., Shepherd, J. E. Thermodynamic cycle analysis for propagating detonations. Journal of Propulsion and Power, 2006, 22(3), 694–98.Vutthivithayarak, E.M. Braun, and F.K. Lu. On thermodynamic cycles for detonation engines. 28th International Symposium on Shock Waves, Volume 2. This cycle is researched for pulse detonation engines (PDE), considered to be more efficient than the classical combustion engines that are based on the Brayton or Humphrey cycles.Borys Łukasik, Artur Rowiński, Andrzej Irzycki, Krzysztof Snopkiewicz. Study of combustion chamber with a rotating detonation. Institute of Aviation – Warszawa. 2015. The FJ cycle for detonation is an elaboration of the original ideas of Jacobs (1956).Jacobs, S. J. The energy of detonation. Navord Report 4366, U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory. 1956. The first to propose applying thermodynamic cycles to detonation was Yakov Zeldovich in 1940. In his work, he concluded that the efficiency of the detonation cycle is slightly larger than that of previous constant-volume combustion cycles. Zeldovich’s ideas were not known to Jacbos or Fickett.Parvel V. Bulat and Konstantine N.Volkov. Detonation Jet Engine. Part 1 – Thermodynamic Cycle, 2016. VOL. 11, NO. 12, 5009-5019Eric Wintenberger. Application of Steady and Unsteady Detonation Waves to Propulasion. California Institute of Technology. 2004. Since 1940, serious attempts have been discussed for detonating propulsion systems, nevertheless, until today, no practical approach has been found. Detonation is the process by which material is very rapidly burned and converted into energy (extremely high combustion rate). The major difficulty involved in the process is the necessity to rapidly mix the fuel and air at high speeds and sustaining the detonation in a controllable manner.Kailasanath K. Review of Propulsion Applications of Detonation Waves. U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. 2000. ==Thermodynamic Cycle Model== The FJ cycle is based on a closed piston-cylinder where the reactants and explosion products are constantly contained inside. The explosives, pistons, and cylinder define the closed thermodynamic system. In addition, the cylinder and the pistons are assumed to be rigid, massless, and adiabatic.Fickett, W. and Davis, W. C., Detonation Theory and Experiment, Dover Publications Inc., 2001, Chap. 2, pp. 35–38. The ideal FJ cycle consists of five processes: #Reactants are isentropically compressed: Applying external work to move one piston at velocity up instantaneously initiating a detonation front at the piston’s surface. The detonation wave propagates, and the decomposition products follows it in a uniform state at velocity up. Once it reaches the second piston, the entire piston-cylinder arrangement moves at a constant velocity up. #The kinetic energy produced during the first process is converted into external work. #Adiabatical expansion: The gaseous detonation products return to a final pressure equal to the initial pressure, Ρ0. #Heat extraction: The gaseous products are reversibly cooled at a constant pressure to reach the initial temperature Τ0. #The cycle is completed by converting the products into reactants, as in the initial conditions. The entire cycle is shown in Figure 1. The net work done by the system is equal to the sum of the work done during each step of the cycle. Since all processes in the cycles shown in Figure 2 are reversible, except for the detonation process, the work computed is an upper limit to the work that can be obtained during any cyclic process with a propagating detonation as the combustion step. ==Mathematical interpretation of the cycle’s total work == In the following equations, all subscripts correspond to the different steps in the Fickett–Jacobs cycle as shown in Figure 2. In addition, a representation of the work done by the system and the external work applied on the system is shown is Figure 1. Initially, the work done to the system to begin a cycling detonation is W_i = -P_i A u_p(t-t_0) Figure 2: An schematic representation of the different steps in the Fickett–Jacobs cycle. a) Applying external force to move the piston at velocity up, and simultaneous detonation of the explosives (UCJ is the speed of the wave front of the detonation) . b) Acceleration of piston Α to the right. c) Conversion of mechanical work to external work by decelerating the detonation products. d) Expansion of the products to atmospheric pressure. e) Heat extraction and constant pressure. f) Conversion of products to reactants at constant temperature and pressure. Where Ρi is the initial pressure applied to unit area Α and velocity up from time t-t_0 . The time to reach the end of the cylinder is calculated using length L of the cylinder and the propagation wave’s velocity (approximated by Chapman–Jouguet ), UCJ: t-t_0 = \\\\frac{L}{U_{CJ}}. The fact that the mass of the explosive is M = \\\\rho L A, where ρ is the explosive’s density, the equation above becomes W_i = - \\\\frac{P_i u_p}{\\\\rho U_{CJ}} The work done by the system (detonation) per unit mass of explosive is W_{01} = \\\\frac{1}{2}u_{p}^2 The work done by the adiabatic expansion of the reaction products is W_{12} = \\\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} PdV Where Ρ is the pressure on the isentrope through state 1, and V2 is the specific volume on that isentrope at the initial pressure Ρ0. The work done through steps 2 to 0 (including 3) was considered by Fickett to be negligible, nevertheless, it is added in order to have a complete thermodynamic cycle and be consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics. The additional work is W_{20} = -P_0(V_0 - V_2) The total work done by the system is then W_{tot} = W_i + W_{01} + W_{12} + W_{20} = W_i + H_0 - H_2 Where H_0 - H_2 is the enthalpy difference between steps 0 to 2 (passing through step 3). ===Thermal Efficiency=== The thermal efficiency of the FJ cycle is the ratio between the net work done to the specific heat of combustion. \\\\eta = \\\\frac{W_{tot}}{q_c} = \\\\frac{H_0 - H_2}{q_c} Where qc is the specific heat of combustion, defined as the enthalpy difference between the reactants and the products at initial pressure and temperature: q_c = H_0 - H_3 . The FJ cycle overall shows the amount of work available from a detonating system.Ernest. L. Baker and Leonard I.Stiel. Optimu, Performance of explosives in a quasistatic detonation cycle. NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. 2017. The thermal efficiency for the FJ cycle is shown to be dependent on its initial pressure. The thermal eﬃciency decreases when the initial pressure decreases due to the increasing in dissociation at low pressures. Dissociation is an endothermic process, hence reducing the amount of energy released in a detonation or the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from the FJ cycle. Exothermic reactions are encouraged when increasing the initial pressure of the system, hence, increasing the amount of work generated during the FJ cycle. ==See also== * Thermodynamic Cycle * Humphrey Cycles * Brayton Cycles ==References== Category:Thermodynamic cycles ","title":"Fickett–Jacobs cycle"},{"id":"63915542","text":"Andrey Aktauov is a Kazakhstani karateka.

His studies have crossed a broad range of topics including basic physical and quantum chemistry, solar system origin, tracking the origin and evolution of life on early earth; stratospheric chemistry, climate change and greenhouse gas identification, Mars atmospheric chemistry, past and future and isotope geochemistry. His work combines photochemical isotope studies, both laboratory and synchrotron based, field work in the South Pole, Greenland Summit and the Tibetan Himalayas for climate and geological sampling across China for early earth rock records. His non-isotope work has included discovery of an unknown source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide that lead the global industrial elimination of all emissions, a major contribution to changing global climate change. Thiemens has worked on developing new imaging techniques for space mission return sampleshttps://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news/newsid=38418.php and detection of superconductivity in nature. ==Education== Thiemens earned his bachelor of Science degree from the University of Miami. His studies with isotope geochemist Cesare Emiliani, PhD student of Harold Urey and a co- discoverer of paleoclimate temperature determination stimulated his interests in isotopes. Thiemens received a MS from Old Dominion University and PhD from Florida State University for his research using stable isotopes and particle identification using the FSU Van de Graff accelerator. He moved to the University of Chicago at the Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies (1977-1980) where he worked with Robert N. Clayton using lunar samples to track solar wind origin and evolution, meteorite cosmochemistry, and early atmospheric chemistry. ==Career== Thiemens moved to the Department of Chemistry at the University of California San Diego in 1980, where he was hired as an assistant professor as a replacement for Hans Seuss and took over the laboratory of Nobel Laureate Harold Urey. He was promoted to Full Professor in 1989, and served as the Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry from 1996-1999. He was the founding Dean of the Division of Physical Sciences and served from 1999-2016. ==Research== Thiemens research at UCSD initiated after a re build of the Urey isotope ratio mass spectrometer to allow measurement of both oxygen isotope ratios (18O/16O, 17O/16O). His first publication as an Assistant Professor reported in Science the first mass independent isotope effect which occurred during ozone formation. This was the first demonstration of a chemical process that could alter isotope ratios in a manner independently of mass difference. Most strikingly was that the pattern of mass independent and the 17O/16O,18O/16O variation varied equally and reproduced the same pattern observed in primitive inclusions of the Allende carbonaceous chondritic meteorite. The underlying assumption for the inclusions anomaly deriving from a nucleosynthetic component was incorrect and new models for early solar system formation were needed and have evolved since. Much of Thiemens research has been dedicated to experimentally exploring the relevant fractionation processes that may account for the observations; including synchrotron photodissociation effects in CO.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080915134903.htm The gas to particle formation process of the first solids in the nebula have also experimentally been shown to produce the mass independent anomaly.https://phys.org/news/2013-10-scientists-mystery-odd-patterns- oxygen.html Meteoritic material studies of Thiemens in sulfur isotopes have shown that sulfonic acids from chondritic meteorites have shown that photochemical processes have been important contributor to their molecular synthesis as well other sulfur species. To interpret mass independent isotope effects during photodissociation, Thiemens has worked in collaboration with Raphy Levine of Hebrew University to interpret mass independent isotope effects during photodissociation and better explore the fundamental chemical physics of the processes. The understanding of the basis of the ozone effect has been extensively studied by Nobel Laureate Rudy Marcus and catalyzed deeper insight into the chemical physics. Thiemens has worked broadly on understanding the earth system. Thiemens and Trogler identified a source of 10% of the increasing emissions of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas with a radiative forcing 200 times CO2 on a per molecules basis and a 100 year plus lifetime with unidentified sources. It was shown that the manufacture of adipic acid, used in nylon production is a globally important source. In the year post publication, a global inter industry consortium banded together to eliminate all N2O emissions, with far reaching climate impact. Thiemens at South Pole marker on expedition to dig snow pit for isotope record Thiemens work in atmospheric chemistry has had extensive impact. The atmospheric chemistry of oxygen isotopes has been used to define atmospheric ozone surface reactions on Mars across billion-year time scales and the oxygen isotopic carbonate record on Mars has been measured to deepen insight into reservoir mixing.https://phys.org/news/2014-12-chemical-analysis-ancient-martian- meteorite.html Terrestrial atmospheric carbonate aerosol oxygen isotopic measurements allow heterogenous reaction chemistry in both atmospheres to be resolved. Mass independent sulfur isotopes in Mars meteorites were used to show ultra violet SO2 photochemical reactions in the past Martian atmosphere. The Mars sulfur observations lead to one of the most important applications of the isotope effects. In the present earth's atmosphere, the need for UV light to carry out SO2 photodissociation does not allow occurrence in today's lower atmosphere because of stratospheric ozone screening of UV light, but in a reduced oxygen atmosphere UV should pass through. Measurement of sulfur isotopes in the earths earliest rock record revealed that large and variable mass independent sulfur isotope effects occur in 33S/32S, 36S/32S ratios, as observed in Mars meteorites and laboratory experiments. The short atmospheric lifetime of SO2 photochemistry is produced only with lowered O2-O3 level. For first time, oxygen levels in the earliest earth could be determined.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event The sulfur work is widely used to track the origin and evolution of life. Present day sulfur isotopic anomalies in sulfate from Antarctic and Greenland ice have been used to determine the influence of massive volcanoes on the stratosphere. Samples from a snow pit dug by Thiemens and colleagues have shown that there exist sources of sulfur chemistry that need to be included in studies of the atmosphere today and in the early earth. The inclusion of radiogenic 35S with the 4 stable sulfur isotopes have further enhanced mechanistic details of the contributors to the fractionation processes in the pre Cambrium era and today. An atmospheric sulfur anomaly is observed in diamonds and uniquely tracks atmosphere-mantle mixing dynamics on billion-year time scales. Thiemens has used oxygen isotopes to study oxygen chemistry of the stratosphere and mesosphere using a rocket borne cryogenic whole air sampler.https://apnews.com/aa09fc127d4630a0af10533c02df53de The intersection of O(1D) from ozone photolysis exchange with CO2 and passes the isotopic anomaly to be used as a tracer. The small effect in the O2 is removed by the process of photosynthesis and respiration and allows a new, highly sensitive way to quantify global primary productivity (GPP) in the world's oceans and, from oxygen trapped in ice cores across long time periods. Using mass independent oxygen isotopes Thiemens and colleagues have applied them to further identify N2O sources. Thiemens developed the ability to measure naturally produced 35S (87-day half-life) to provide the first trans Pacific atmospheric Fukushima emissions and calculate the reactor neutronicity.https://earthsky.org/earth/first-quantitative-measure-of- radiation-leaked-from-fukushima-reactor Recently the method determined melting rates of the Tibetan Himalayan glaciers, the source of drinking water of 40% of the Earth's population. Thiemens has recently shown with his colleagues the first detection of superconductivity in nature, in this case in meteorites. == Service == Besides his service as Chair and Dean, Thiemens has been active in external service: * Board of Directors, San Diego State University Research Foundation, 2006-2009 * City of San Diego Science Advisory Board (2002-2005) * San Diego Natural History Museum Board of Trustees (2001-2006) * San Diego Chamber of Commerce Environmental Advisory Board 1998-1999. * ECO AID Board of Advisors (1999-2002) * Science Advisory Board.

In 2007, Segal returned to Israel and joined the Department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology to begin her own research lab. She was promoted to the rank of full professor in 2020. Her research lab focuses on coupling materials science with chemistry and biotechnology to address problems in food technology and medicine. Specific areas of in which Segal's research has contributed include optical biosensing, silicon-based therapeutics, silicon-polymer hybrids, and food packaging technologies. === Optical biosensors === Fabry-Perot interferometers Using electrochemical etched mesoporous silicon, Segal's research group has developed label-free, optical sensors by means of Fabry-Perot interferometry. These sensors, containing pores between 10 and 100 nm have been engineered to detect analytes such as proteins, DNA, whole bacteria cells, amphipathic molecules on lipid bilayers, organophosphorus compounds, heavy metal ions, and proteolytic products from enzymatic activity. Some of Segal's sensors have been integrated with isotachophoresis and/or engineered with specific surface functionalizations (e.g. attached proteins, enzymes, aptamers, and antimicrobial peptides) to enhance the limits of detection for certain analytes. Segal has helped engineer hybrid porous silicon materials for sensing purposes, including carbon dot-infused silicon transducers, hydrogel- confined silicon substrates, and polymer-silicon hybrids. Diffraction gratings Segal's research group engineered microstructured silicon optical sensors for the detection and monitoring of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, in both clinical samples and food. The microstructured substrates serve as reflective diffraction gratings for label-free measurements of refractive index. By tracking bacterial growth in response to antibiotics, Segal's group (in collaboration with the Department of Urology at the Bnai Zion hospital and Ha'Emek Medical Center) developed a means of rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing for clinical samples. === Porous silicon therapeutics === Segal and her research team engineered porous silicon carriers containing nerve growth factor for delivery to the brain in Alzheimer's models, in addition to carriers of anti-cancer drugs to diseased tissue and bone morphogenetic protein 2. She also demonstrated the delivery of anti-cancer drugs captured in silicon microparticles with a pneumatic capillary gene gun. She has studied the kinetics and degradation of porous silicon therapeutics in disease models, finding that porous silicon materials tend to degrade at faster rates in diseased tissue environments compared to healthy tissue. === Food packaging technologies === In contrast to the research on silicon nanomaterials, a large part of Segal's research focuses on the development of new technologies for active packaging of food usually through the incorporation of polymers, nanomaterials, and essential oils. These materials have antimicrobial properties, allowing them to preserve food for longer times, and in turn, reducing food waste. == Awards == * 2019 ACS Advances in Measurement Science Lectureship Award for her work on photonic crystal sensing. *2019 Lady Globes named her one of Israel's top 50 most influential women *2017 Discovery Award for Team Prismatix (part of UK Longitude Prize Contest) antimicrobial resistance testing technology *2016 Hershel Rich Innovation Award *2016 Daniel Shiran Memorial Research Prize for outstanding research in biomedicine *2015 Yanai Prize for Excellence in Academic Education *2014 Henry Taub Award for Academic Excellence *2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 Technion Excellence in Teaching Award == Entrepreneurship == Segal serves as the CTO to BactuSense Technologies Ltd and was the project coordinator of Nanopak, an EU-funded project that developed food packaging products in order to extend the shelf life of food. == Personal life == Segal is a cancer survivor, married, and has two children. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Technion – Israel Institute of Technology alumni Category:Technion – Israel Institute of Technology faculty Category:Nanotechnologists Category:Israeli women engineers Category:Israeli chemical engineers Category:Polymer scientists and engineers Category:Women engineers Category:Israeli women scientists ","title":"Ester H.

Levit was born in Jewish family in Vilkomir (now Ukmerge) and was the only son to be educated. He went to the local gymnasium and then moved to Petrograd, initially studying law and then studied medicine. He served in the medical corps during the 1918 civil war. After receiving a medical degree in 1921 he went to work in the Moscow University Clinic. He took an interest in blood related diseases and published a monograph on hemorrhagic diathesis in 1929. Levit also rose to hold high positions in the communist party. He trained in 1927 under Alexander S. Serebrovsky and was strongly opposed to Lamarckism that was still in fashion. He left work in the clinic to move to the Narkomzdrav Biomedical Institute in 1928. In 1930 he became the head of the Genetics Division of the Institute and in the same year, he was nominated by the Government along with Izrail Agol to train in the United States of America under H.J. Muller. By the time he returned to the Soviet Union in 1932 his post had been abolished but he was made a director of a newly created Maxim Gorky Biomedical Research Institute. Levit was publicly opposed to Nazi ideas on eugenics and racism. In 1935 the institute was renamed to the Maxim Gorky Research Institute of Medical Genetics and they had begun work among others on 234 twins. There had also been a proposal for positive eugenics with human artificial insemination under Alexander Serebrovsky. Muller along with Agol and Levit took an interest in positive eugenics and included a chapter on the idea in his book Out of the Night (1935) and he sent a copy of it to Stalin. The communist party met in November 1936 and denounced Levit and Agol as promoters of fascist ideas. At the international meeting of geneticist in Moscow, Muller was an invited speaker and there was considerable debate on eugenics. This was utilized by Trofim Lysenko to demonstrate that his opponents who had been trained in genetics were fascists. Muller who stayed on early in 1937 later faced threat of being arrested but escaped and shortly after his exit, Izrail Ago was arrested and executed while Levit was removed from his position as a director and arrested on 11 January 1938. He was declared an American spy and executed in Lubyanka prison in May that year. == References == Category:1894 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Soviet geneticists Category:Great Purge victims from Lithuania Category:Eugenicists Category:Soviet Jews Category:Soviet physicians Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Jews executed by the Soviet Union ","title":"Solomon Levit"},{"id":"63915835","text":"Mirne basilica Pottery from Fulfinum. 1st century.

She was a professor of library science at Florida State University for 23 years and did extensive scholarly work on the library classification of black studies and the second edition of the Anglo- American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2). == Family and early life == Doris Hargrett Clack was born Doris Alease Hargrett on in Hyde Park in Wakulla County, Florida, a rural part of the Florida panhandle. She was the eighth of nine children of Andrew Joshua Hargrett and Delia Leana Green. Her paternal grandfather, Amos Hargrett (1833-1905), was born into slavery but went on to hold a number of political offices and was one of the few African-American delegates to the Florida Constitutional Convention of 1885. Amos Hargrett had eleven children and four of them became teachers, including Andrew Hargrett, who attended the State Normal College that later became Florida A&M; University. Andrew Hargrett, whose son dubbed him a \\"Frontier Professor\\", became an itinerant teacher and later school principal who supplemented his income through farming, fishing, and carpentry. Andrew Hargrett led the effort to improve African-American education in Wakulla County, leading to the founding of the first elementary school and the first high school, Shadeville High School, for African-Americans in the county. Her maternal grandfather was Dennis Green, a farmer in Liberty County, Florida. Since there was no secondary school for African-Americans in the county, a family roundtable was held to determine which of Green's four children would attend school in Apalachicola, Florida. Delia Green was chosen and in Apalachicola she met Andrew Hargrett. Delia Green would become a schoolteacher herself. == Education == Doris Hargrett Clack began her schooling in Wakulla County schools founded by her father and graduated from Lincoln High School in Tallahassee, Florida. She graduated with an A.B. from Florida A&M; University in 1949, a master's in library science from the University of Michigan in 1956, and a PhD in library science from the University of Pittsburgh in 1973. Her dissertation was titled An investigation into the adequacy of Library of Congress subject headings for resources for black studies. == Career == Clack taught for seven years in public high schools in Gadsden, Leon, and Wakulla counties in the Florida Panhandle. After earning her master's degree, she started working for the Florida A&M; University library, eventually heading the cataloging and technical services divisions. In 1973, was hired as an associate professor at the Florida State University School of Library Science in Tallahassee, Florida, where she taught cataloging until her death in 1995. One of her students wrote of Clack: > She had always been so elegant, tall and fashionably dressed, with a milk > chocolate complexion, a beautiful smile, and regal posture [...] she was > serious about cataloging and firm, even strict, in teaching us the > discipline. But she also seemed very caring, and she followed the fashion > trends [...] Clack authored numerous books and articles on library cataloging, including Black Literature Resources: Analysis and Organization (1975) and Authority Control: Principles, Applications, and Instructions (1990), which has been described as \\"a classic reference on the topic\\" of authority control. Clack conducted numerous workshops on the introduction of the new rules in second edition of Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2), published in 1979. In what was described as \\"perhaps the height of her career\\", she organized the International Conference on AACR2 in March 1979, which featured Seymour Lubetzky, Michael Gorman, and numerous other figures pivotal in the development of AACR2. She also edited and wrote the preface for the conference proceedings, which were published as The Making of a Code: The Issues Underlying AACR2 (1980). Clack also worked extensively with libraries in West Africa. She taught at the library school of the University of Maiduguri from 1987 to 1988, studied libraries in Ibadan and Lagos, and lectured throughout Nigeria. In the 1990s she traveled twice to Ghana to lecture at the University of Ghana and elsewhere.

In the early 1960s, he spent time in California, where he met and played with Byron Allen, Noah Howard, Sonny Simmons, and other musicians interested in free improvisation. ==New York== In 1963, Johnson moved to New York, where he played with Sun Ra and started a band with saxophonist Giuseppi Logan, bassist Reggie Johnson and drummer Rashied Ali. In 1964, Johnson participated in the historic \\"October Revolution in Jazz\\", a four-day music festival organized by trumpeter Bill Dixon, and also joined pianist Paul Bley’s group. The following year, he appeared on Bley's album Barrage. Johnson also played with saxophonists Pharoah Sanders and Marion Brown and repeatedly sat in with John Coltrane's band. Eventually Coltrane invited him to participate in the recording of Ascension, on which he takes the second solo, following Coltrane and preceding Sanders. In the spring of 1967, Johnson played in the Rashied Ali Quintet, recordings of which were released more than fifty years later. Following Coltrane's death in July of that year, Johnson suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized. After dropping out of the music scene for a few years and living as a homeless person, Johnson joined a collective improvisation group known as The Music Ensemble, which also featured drummer Roger Baird, violinist Billy Bang, trumpeter Malik Baraka, saxophonist Daniel Carter, and bassists Earl Freeman and William Parker, and began to support himself with various odd jobs. ==Later life== In the early 1980s, while working at Ali’s Alley, a club run by Rashied Ali, Johnson met and formed a trio with drummer Paul Murphy and pianist Mary Anne Driscoll. The group frequently performed in lofts and, supplemented by saxophonist Jimmy Lyons and bassoonist Karen Borca, recorded two albums. In 1984, Johnson again fell on hard times and became homeless. He later lived at the Coler Specialty Hospital on Roosevelt Island in New York City.

It is the first Fortschritt combine harvester, that has been solely developed in the GDR. The E 512 succeeded the Fortschritt E 170 series. At the time of its introduction in the late 1960s, the E 512 was a modern, sought-after combine harvester, that could compete well with high-performance combines made in Western countries, such as the Clayson 140 and the Claas Senator. In total, 51,412 units were made from 1968 until 1988, which makes the E 512 the East German combine harvester with the highest production figure. == Development == 5 Mark notes from 1968 A Fortschritt E 512 in 1978 A late 1980s E 512 – its paint was olive-green, because it was cheaper to produce than blue paint In the early 1950s, the GDR combine harvester production had shifted from stationary threshing mashines and pulled harvesters to the self-propelled combine harvesters of the E 170 series, a modified version of the S-4 Stalinets combine harvester. By the early 1960s, it had become clear that the E 170 series harvesters would soon be too small to be operated efficiently in the growing East German Agricultural Production Cooperatives. Thus, the E 170 series was developed into the Fortschritt E 510. The E 510, basically being an update of the already aging E 170 series, was tested during the 1963 harvesting season, but proved to be no significant improvement over the E 170 series. In February 1964, it was decided not to put the E 510 into series production, and instead develop a new combine harvester from scratch, the E 512. In the 1964 harvesting season, several different combine harvesters, such as the Soviet SK-4, the Swedish Munktell, the West-German Claas Matador Gigant, the Belgian Clayson 140, and the E 510 prototype, were tested. Based upon the results of these tests, the E 512 was developed in the following two years. In the 1966 harvesting season, the first prototypes were tested by the factory, and they proved to be successful in the 1967 official state testing. A new testing method had been established in 1966, and the E 512 was the first agricultural harvesting machine alongside the forage harvester E 280, that was tested according to this new method. After completing the tests in 1967, approval for series production was given, and the first ten pre-production units were built the same year. In order to be able to begin series production, the combine harvester plant in Singwitz was modernised in 1968. Manufacturing machines from England, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and West Germany were purchased, and installed in the plant. These machines included a machine for steel sheet surface protection, a straw walker welding robot, and an automatic straw walker crankshaft forging machine. In early 1969, the E 512 was presented on the Leipzig Trade Fair. Several improvements and updates to the Fortschritt E 512 were introduced throughout its series production. From 1969 onwards, the E 512 was available with a driver's cabin. An electronic, automatic cutting height leveling system was introduced in 1973, an electronic steering assisting system, that helped keep the E 512 in a straight line, was offered from 1974. During the 1980s, the Fortschritt E 512's colour scheme was switched from blue and white to olive-green and white, because green paint was cheaper to produce in the GDR. From 1987, Fortschritt offered an on-board computer for the E 512, that could precisely calculate the corn loss. == Technical description == The Fortschritt E 512 is a conventional straw-walker combine harvester, and has front-wheel drive with a continuously variable transmission. The corn passes through the E 512 in longitudinal fashion. This means that it enters the combine in front, and gets pulled into the mid- mounted threshing drum; the straw exits the machine in back, after getting cleaned in the straw walkers, which are installed in the E 512's rear compartment. The Fortschritt E 512 can be used for several different types of corn; it can be used on slopes with an angle of up to 8.1°. From the factory, headers with cutting widths of 3.6 m (12 ft), 4.2 m (14 ft), 4.8 m (16 ft), and 5.7 m (19 ft) were available. The E 512 can process up to 5 kg of material per second; its specific fuel consumption is 1062 dm3·km−2 (litres per harvested square-kilometre of field). The E 512 can harvest approximately 7000…10,000 m2 of field per hour. The threshing drum has a width of 1278 mm and a diameter of 600 mm. It is equipped with 8 rasp bars. It is driven by a belt, that is hydraulically adjustable in length (continuously variable transmission), in order to adjust the threshing drum speed. The speed is adjustable between 603 and 1300 min−1. The concave has 14 rasp bars, and its distance from the threshing drum can be quickly adjusted in three steps using a lever in the driver's cabin; fine adjusting is possible by turning the concave adjusting nut with a jaw spanner. The E 512 has four straw walkers with four steps each; the total straw walker aera is 5.2 m2. The E 512 is powered by an IFA 4 VD 14,5/12-1 SRW four-stroke diesel engine. This engine is a naturally aspirated, water-cooled pushrod straight-four engine with two crossflow cylinder heads. It has a helix-controlled inline injection pump, and M-System direct injection with central-sphere combustion chambers. With a cylinder bore of 120 mm and a stroke of 145 mm, it displaces 6.56 dm3. It is rated 77 kW at 2000 min−1, and produces a maximum torque of 392 N·m at 1350 min−1. The torque is sent from the engine to a manual three-speed gearbox, and to the main drive wheel, from which the threshing drum, the straw walkers, sieves, fan, corn conveyor, corn elevator, and header are driven. The three- speed gearbox is used solely for converting the torque that is sent to the front wheels. An additional continuously variable transmission allows finely adjusting the drive speed independently from the gearbox output shaft speed, so that the engine can always run at full power. The header is driven by a chain, and is hydraulically adjustable in height. The reel speed is hydraulically adjustable between 17 and 53 min−1. The corn tank has a volume of 2.3 m2; instead of a tank, the E 512 was also available with a sacking system that fills the corn directly into large jute sacks. == References == Landwirtschaftsmuseum Hohenheim (ed.): VEB Fortschritt Erntebergungsmaschinen E512, 2016 Landwirtschaftsmuseum Hohenheim (ed.): VEB Fortschritt Erntebergungsmaschinen E510, 2016 Landwirtschaftsmuseum Hohenheim (ed.): VEB Fortschritt Erntebergungsmaschinen E512, 2019 Günter Klengel: 155 Jahre Landmaschinenbau im Territorium der Gemeinde Obergurig, HELO Magazin, volume 1, number 5, November 2011, p. 5 Reiner Brandt: Geschichte der Landmaschinenprüfung in der DDR 1951–1991 und ihre Vorgeschichte, Bornimer Agrartechnische Berichte, volume 34, 2004, ISSN 0947-7314, p. 34 G.

She worked after school at the central library to gain library experience. She finished high school and in 1917 went on to study for a year at the library education program started by Thomas Fountain Blue at Louisville Public Library. ==Library career== Herd was interviewed in July 1918 to confirm her readiness to serve as a librarian. She was hired at a salary of $35 a month, one-third that of white librarians in similar roles. The branch opened in October 1918, though a planned opening ceremony was canceled due to the 1918 influenza pandemic. The Birmingham Library Board did not permit books to circulate between the white and black branches of the library; instead, books from the central library would be given to the black branch, and a replacement book for the central library would be purchased from funds for the black branch. The board gave Herd the title of \\"library assistant\\" despite the fact that she was the head of the branch responsible for providing library services to the 80,000 African- American residents of Birmingham. Herd headed the library branch for four months before the board decided that a man would be a better choice to encourage use of the library; the man they eventually found to replace Herd was also poorly supported by the board's actions, and lasted only six months in the position. Despite the fact that she was in the position for only a short time, Herd has been described as \\"a pioneer in black librarianship\\". Librarian Annie Greene King described the opening of the Booker T. Washington branch as an important moment in the black public library movement. ==References== Category:American librarians Category:Women librarians Category:African-American librarians ","title":"Mattie Herd Roland"},{"id":"63916264","text":"The Confession Killer is a 2019 American true crime documentary miniseries directed by Robert Kenner and Taki Oldham.

She is a full professor in the Materials Science Department at the NOVA University of Lisbon (FCT-UNL). Fortunato is a scientist and innovator in the field of paper electronics, including transistors, memories, sensors, batteries, displays, antennas and solar cells. == Education == Fortunato received her Engineering Diploma in Materials Science and Physics in 1987 from the FCT-UNL and continued her graduate studies in the same university. In 1991 Fortunato received her Master's degree in Semiconductor Materials and in 1995 her Ph.D. in Microelectronics and Optoelectronics. In 2005 Fortunato obtained her habilitation in the same field. == Career == After her Ph.D., Fortunato was offered the position of assistant professor in 1995 at the NOVA University of Lisbon. In 1998 Fortunato was promoted to associate professor and since then has been the director of the Materials Research Center (CENIMAT) of the Associate Laboratoryi3N, the Institute of Nanostructures, Nanomodeling, and Nanofabrication. At the CENIMAT Fortunato lead the research team which has been distinguished for the discovery of the paper transistor. In 2012, she was made a full professor at the FCT-UNL and since 2017, Fortunato is the vice- rector at NOVA University. Fortunato is an elected member of Academy of Engineering (2008), European Academy of Sciences (2016), Lisbon Academy of Sciences (2018) and Academia Europaea (2018). She belongs to the Board of Trustees of the Luso-American Development Foundation (2014). Fortunato is Associate Editor of Rapid Research Letters Physica Status Solidi since 2006 (Wiley), Co-Editor of Europhysics Letters since 2011 and is an Editorial Advisory Board Member of ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (since 2020). == Research == Fortunato's research focuses on exploring new electronic active materials that are environmentally friendly and compatible with flexible electronics. This led to the invention of the first paper transistor in 2008, which used paper, a low-cost and flexible biopolymer, as the insulator layer (gate dielectric) of a thin-film transistor, replacing the commonly used Silicon. Fortunato's research includes transparent and paper electronics; electrochemical devices and biosensors and microfluidics. Her research includes the development of new materials and processes for conventional thin film technology, with a focus on exploiting the materials’ performances at a nanoscale. Applications for these devices include the electronics and optoelectronics industry. She pioneered European research on transparent electronics, namely thin-film transistors based on oxide semiconductors, demonstrating that oxide materials can be used as true semiconductors. === Paper Electronics === Paper electronics consists of substituting the components of a transistor, e.g. silicon or other inorganic materials, commonly used as the insulating component, by cellulose, i.e. paper. This makes the chips inexpensive, recyclable and environmentally friendly. The idea is to print the components on a flexible paper surface and additionally use the cellulose as the dielectric layer of the transistor, i.e. its insulating component. This way, the paper does not only serve as the substrate but also integrated as a functional part of the device. Although paper electronics might not replace all the silicon technology from today, this technology can be added to existing technologies and is suitable for low-cost and large scale applications. Further scientific applications include biosensors, radiofrequency identification (RFID) tags in shipping and product inventory management == Honors and Awards == Fortunato has received national and international awards for her work. In 2005 Fortunato received the prize for Scientific Excellence from the Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT-MCTES). In 2009, she was cited by the Portuguese Parliament for her research. In 2010, she was awarded membership in the Order of Prince Henry by then-Portuguese President Aníbal Cavaco Silva. In 2015, she was President of Portugal Day. In 2016 she was awarded the Blaise Pascal Medal in materials science by the European Academy of Sciences and in 2017, the Czochralski award in recognition of her research work in the area of Advanced Materials Science. In 2018, she received a European Research Council grant worth € 3.5 million, the largest grant ever awarded to a Portuguese researcher at the time of the award.. == References == == External links == * Elvira Fortunato profile at FCT-UNL * Elvira's Fortunato group * Advanced Science News: Elvira Fortunato and Rodrigo Martins named European Inventor Award 2016 finalists * Paper electronics: a sustainable multifunctional platform Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Members of Academia Europaea Category:People from Almada Category:Portuguese physicists Category:Portuguese scientists Category:Portuguese women scientists Category:NOVA University Lisbon alumni Category:NOVA University Lisbon faculty Category:Materials scientists and engineers Category:Portuguese inventors ","title":"Elvira Fortunato"},{"id":"63916326","text":"Jens Fredricson (born 14 December 1967) is a Swedish equestrian.

Each slab has coloured swirls, the middle one stands out because the entire slab is moss green in colour. Connemara marble ornament, Museum Building, Trinity College Dublin Connemara marble or \\"Irish green\\" is a rare variety of marble found in Connemara, Ireland with a distinct green colour. It is commonly used as a gemstone and for decorations. Due to its colouration, it is commonly associated with the Irish identity. It strongly resembles the verd antique found in the Mediterranean. It is named after the region in the western part of the country in which it is quarried (including Lissoughter in Recess, County Galway, and in Clifden). == Geology == Connemara marble occurs as layers within the Connemara Marble Formation from the lower Dalradian Appin Group, part of the Connemara Metamorphic Complex. The parent rock was an impure siliceous dolomitic limestone deposited in a shelf environment on the continental margin of Laurentia. In the Grampian Orogeny it underwent silimanite grade metamorphism. Minerals formed at this stage were a variety of calc-silicates, including diopside, forsterite, tremolite, together with talc and chlorite. Subsequent metasomatism, probably associated with hydrothermal fluids from the late Caledonian Galway granites, altered the calc-silicates to minerals of the serpentine subgroup. The layers of marble are interbedded with schists and quartzites. As a marble, the most important mineral components are dolomite and calcite, supplemented with variable amounts of diopside, serpentine, tremolite, forsterite, clinochlore, phlogopite, omphacite and talc. The colour is determined by the coloured mineral content, with serpentine responsible for the characteristic green colouration. Connemara marble differs from the verd antiques in that it is an actual marble, rather than a serpentinite breccia, despite also having a very high serpentine content. alt=an older image of a small quarry with mining equipment and slabs of rocks on the floor, a small figure of a man stands in one corner next to one of the walls == Uses == Connemara marble is used in souvenirs, jewellery and home decoration. It is not suitable for usage in outside construction as it rapidly loses its colouration due to weathering. It has been quarried since the 1700s, and has been exported throughout Europe and America to make columns, floors and other decorations. == See also == * Verd antique, a similar green rock from the Mediterranean. == Sources == Category:Connemara Category:Marble ","title":"Connemara marble"},{"id":"63916346","text":"Ibrahim Bin Khalil () is a Bangladeshi Jatiya Party politician and the former Member of Parliament of Chittagong-14. ==Career== Khalil was elected to parliament from Chittagong-14 as a Bangladesh Awami League candidate in 1986 and 1988.

The geographical coordinates of the refinery are:13°02'21.0\\"S, 28°40'48.0\\"E (Latitude:-13.039167; Longitude:28.680000). ==Overview== The petroleum refinery is described in some publications as a \\"very small and simple refinery\\". It was constructed in 1973, with capacity to refine 24,000 bbl/d of crude oil, and process of feedstock annually. Crude oil is imported via the Kurasini Oil Jetty in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and is delivered to the refinery through the Tazama Pipeline. The annual delivery capacity of the pipeline is also the annual processing capacity of the refinery. == Operations == The Indeni Refinery is configured as a Hydro- skimming refinery. Designed in 1973, the refinery is not able to refine pure crude at commercial levels and processes spiked crude. The refinery is able to produce the following products: (a) unleaded petrol (b) automotive gas oil (c) industrial kerosene (d) domestic kerosene (e) Jet fuel (f) Liquefied Petroleum Gas (g) reformate (h) fuel oil and (i) asphalt. ==Ownership== When the refinery was established in 1973, it was owned and managed by Indeni Petroleum Refinery Company Limited, a 50/50 joint venture between the government of Zambia and Eni, the Italian energy conglomerate, through their subsidiary Agip Zambia. Under the terms of the joint venture, Eni was responsible for the management of the refinery. In 2001, Eni sold their shareholding to Total S.A., through their subsidiary TotalFinaElf. Total took over management of the refinery. In 2009, Total S.A. sold their shareholding to the Zambian government for consideration of US$5.5 million. Since then, there have been attempts to bring on-board a strategic partner with funding and expertise to upgrade, modernize and expand the refinery. ==Modernization== In 2017, the World Bank stated that the Indeni Petroleum Refinery was \\"inefficient and technologically unsuited for current fuel needs\\". Its capacity is too small. It does not produce refinement products that larger, more efficient refineries can. For the amount of resources expended to keep it running, the government can do better towards meeting their national petroleum objectives. In order to meet increasing petroleum products demand both nationally and regionally, there are two choices (a) build a new modern refinery that meets current and future national and regional needs or (b) expand and modernize the present refinery to improve its efficiency and output. Building a new refinery is ruled out by its cost. Rehabilitation, expansion and modernization has been estimated at about US$500 million. As the government considers its options, the capacity at the refinery has dropped to 21,000 bbl/day. The last hope is to find a deep-pocket investor who can buy a stake in the present refinery and modernize it. == See also == * Tazama Pipeline * TAZARA Railway ==References== ==External link== * Official website Category:Oil refineries in Zambia Category:1973 establishments in Zambia Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1973 Category:Ndola Category:Buildings and structures in Zambia ","title":"Indeni Petroleum Refinery"},{"id":"63916361","text":"The PDR Yemen Football Federation was the governing body of football in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, commonly known as South Yemen, and was responsible for organising the South Yemen national football team.

Seaman wrote for various publications (including Jezebel, TheStreet.com, and The Huffington Post) while styling himself as a 'publicity expert.' By 2012, Seaman had shifted to a political orientation, launching a Libertarian senate campaign and expressing his views on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. In 2016, Seaman was fired from his Huffpost columnist role for promoting conspiracist content, after which he became a major voice in the Pizzagate conspiracy community. == Writing career == David worked as an intern for the women's magazine Jezebel. After this, Seaman pivoted to presenting himself as a self-promotion guru. After graduating from New York University in 2008, Seaman published Dirty Little Secrets of Buzz: How to Attract Massive Attention to Your Business, Your Product, or Yourself, using those he describes as \\"publicity whores\\" to describe how to court virality, including anecdotes about Howard Stern, Tila Tequila, Ann Coulter, Bill Maher, and Donald Trump. While preparing the book in 2007, Seaman staged a \\"Free Paris Hilton\\" protest in which he attracted only three fellow protestors, but succeeded in entering the local tabloids, interviewing with Nancy Grace on CNN, and getting played off of on Jummy Kimmel and Conan O'Brien's late-night shows. The incident led to Seaman's firing from his internship at Jezebel. Reflecting on Seaman's emergence on the conspiracy scene a decade later, Seaman's editor at the time, Moe Tkacik, expressed surprise at the path Seaman had taken, though noted that \\"his ideas were already bad and self-promotional\\" as of 2007. Seaman later wrote for TheStreet.com, a financial news site. Following this, Seaman became involved in finance, credit, and cryptocurrencies, leading the development of a (now-defunct) Yelp for credit cards called CreditCardOutlaw.com and joining Cara Santa Maria on her podcast Talk Nerdy. Inspired by his interest in traceless currencies, Seaman began opposing internet bills like the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA) on the basis of privacy and internet freedom. Through these arguments, Seaman started a campaign against U.S Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a key supporter of these bills. Seaman's congressional campaign led to his first invitation to guest on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Seaman guested a total of seven times on Rogan's podcast, where he largely discussed topics such as surveillance and bitcoin. == Conspiracy career == In late 2013, Seaman published an ebook titled All Your Favorite Conspiracy Theories Are Wrong. Seaman wrote for both Business Insider and then The Huffington Post. However, Seaman was fired from The Huffington Post after posting an article questioning Hillary Clinton's health, using a video by conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars. Seaman said in 2017 that this termination led him to become involved with the Pizzagate conspiracy. At the time in 2016, Seaman's firing caused him to become something of a hero among the Reddit community /r/The_Donald, and he began producing videos critical of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. As of March 2017, Seaman's Youtube channel had over 150,000 subscribers, with content concentrating on a purported \\"satanic cabal of elites\\" in an alleged conspiracy with the government to traffic and rape small children. Between October 2016, the start of his Pizzagate content, and March 2017, Seaman's account accrued over 6 million views. At this time, Seaman deleted many older videos, saying he feared litigation. As of 2017, his videos tended to receive between fifty- and a hundred-thousand views, and he released more than a video a day. Alongside his Youtube presence, Seaman had nearly 70,000 Twitter followers as of 2017. Seaman was denied use of the YouTube platform in February 2018, after which he moved his videos to BitChute, a video streaming alternative. Between March 2017 and June 2018, Seaman launched his own conservative news website, Fulcrum News, on which he was posting pro-Trump conspiracy theories as of June 2018. == Relationship with outside groups == Seaman opposed QAnon believers and taunted QAnon fans following the anti- climatic release of the Office of the Inspector General report. After Alex Jones apologized in March 2017 for his participation in the Pizzagate conspiracy, Seaman described Jones's withdrawal as a \\"disgrace.\\" That same weekend, Seaman joined a national Pizzagate demonstration in Lafayette Square in front of the White House (attendance was a few dozen individuals), where he gave a speech about how he continues to believe in the theory. On July 4, 2018, Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle was photographed with Seaman while he made a white nationalist-associated hand gesture. Seaman said that he is a fan of Guilfoyle, but that this was only a fan photograph, with no discussion of Pizzagate. Guilfoyle's spokesman said that this was one out of hundreds of photographs. == References == Category:Living people Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:Alt-right Category:New York University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"David Seaman (writer)"},{"id":"63916390","text":"Prince's Theatre, Bristol in 1905 The Prince's Theatre was a theatre on Park Row in Bristol in England which was built in 1867 and was destroyed by bombing in 1940 in the Bristol Blitz during World War II.

Another marked feature of the > plans is the great anxiety evinced to reduce the risks of fire to a minimum, > and to provide ready egress from the interior in case of (whether needful or > needless) alarm amongst the audience.''The Opening of the New Theatre Royal, > Bristol' - The Era, 23 February 1867 Sadly, these safety measures were to prove ineffective. ==Tragedy at the theatre== Frank Benson's production of Richard III (1904) The theatre was built on a very steep slope and a queuing system had not yet been introduced to British theatres.Carleton, p. 4 Because of these factors disaster struck the theatre on 27 December 1869 when 18 people, mostly children, were killed in a crush as they tried to get into the theatre for a pantomime performance of Robinson Crusoe which had opened on the previous evening on Boxing Night. The Era in its edition of 2 January 1870 recorded: > 'One of the most tragic and terrible catastrophes it has ever fallen to our > lot to chronicle, and by which eighteen poor creatures were, at a few > moments' warning, hurried into eternity, took place on Monday night at the > New Theatre in Park-row. Mr Chute having issued an attractive programme, > thousands flocked, as usual, to witness the performance... nearly 2,000 > persons were endeavouring to gain admission either to the pit or gallery, > the crowd extending some distance into the roadway. Directly the doors were > opened those behind pushed forward, heedless of the cries of those in front > of them. Women and children were screaming for help, and even strong men > seemed powerless to act. The tide behind was too strong to be resisted. > Those behind called. \\"Forward!\\" but in vain those in front called \\"Back!\\" > They might as well have appealed to the waves to stay their progress. The > momentarily gathering crowd outside - ignorant, of course, of the imminent > danger of those packed in the passage - pressed on with all their energy. > Things at this juncture looked ugly enough, when a new alarm arose. Some > one, desirous of restraining the impetuous advance of those behind, called > out \\"Fire !\\" A panic was the result. Men, women, and children immediately > made a frantic effort to drive back those coming in. In consequence of this > movement a woman about fifty years of age fell down, and others fall upon > her. The crowd began to sway backwards and forwards, and those who were down > were trampled upon. The scene was now a most terrible one. Screams and moans > rent the air. Cries for assistance were made in vain. People were pushed > down and trampled under foot, and when once down it was almost impossible to > recover their footing. As soon as the crowd had to some extent cleared away > a sad spectacle met the view. Bodies were lying about the passage in various > spots. A boy named Charles Talbot, living at South Green street, Hotwell- > road, was the first rescued, and he was found to be very seriously injured. > Police-constable 95 took him to the shop of Mr Saunders, chemist, at the top > of Park-street, who considered him in a dangerous condition, and at once > advised his immediate removal to the infirmary. He was taken to that > institution, but died soon after his admission. In the meantime other bodies > were picked up, and sixty or seventy policemen were soon in attendance, and > they at once drew a cordon round the entrance to the passage, thus > preventing any one from getting admission. Meanwhile a number of bodies had > been removed, and it was found that fourteen were quite dead. The bodies of > all these were laid out in the lower refreshment-room of the Theatre, and no > one except the representatives of the Press were permitted to see them. > Eight persons whose condition appeared to be very precarious were taken > instantly to the infirmary, where every attention was paid them. Three, > however, did not yield to the treatment, and died after they had been only a > short time in the institution.' As those at the front fell those pushing forward from behind walked over them without realising it. Chute and his wife helped to lay out the bodies of those killed in the lower refreshment rooms. With great presence of mind Chute ordered the performance to continue to avoid a panic, and none of the audience knew of the evening's tragic events until they left after the performance. The tragedy was to take its toll on Chute emotionally and financially. ==Renaming== After the death of J. H. Chute in 1878 the theatre passed to his sons James Macready Chute and his brother George Macready Chute who on 4 August 1884 renamed the New Theatre Royal as the Prince's Theatre; this would be the theatre's name for the rest of its existence. The theatre closed for five weeks in June 1889 for redecoration while at the same time alterations to the upper circle were made to a design by the theatre architect Frank Matcham. The theatre reopened on 1 August 1889 with a production of As You Like It with Ellen Wallis as Rosalind and Frank Kemble-Cooper as Orlando. Electric lighting was added in 1895. Matcham made additional alterations to the theatre in 1902 which included reducing the seating capacity to 1,769 (stalls 57, dress circle 103, balcony 122, fauteils 137, upper circle and amphitheatre 300, pit 518, gallery 500, private boxes 32) and placed four classical statues representing Tragedy, Comedy, Music and Dance on top of the building. The theatre re-opened with Merrie England on Coronation Day, 1902. In 1907 a new ventilation system was fitted which made the Prince's one of the grandest and most comfortable of all the provincial venues. ==Pantomimes== Sam Poluski of the Poluski Brothers as 'Teddy Bear' in the pantomime Jack Horner (1910) Lily Morris as Jack in Jack and Jill (1907) A. W. Clark in Aladdin (1908) Ouida MacDermott in the title role in Aladdin (1908) Daisy Wood in Aladdin (1908) Deborah Volar in Aladdin (1908) Horace Mills as the Dame in Jack and the Beanstalk (1911) During the later Victorian era the Prince's Theatre produced a highly regarded annual pantomime starting with Aladdin in 1867 and continuing almost every Christmas season until 1940 with some of the leading performers of the period. John Henry Chute kept overall control of the pantomimes held at the Prince's, beginning the planning in August of each year, with work commencing on the sets and costumes shortly after. Casting was ongoing with Chute travelling the country to watch about 30 other pantomimes in search of artistes and ideas. He employed leading writers in the genre and had a gift for spotting talented musical comedy artistes early in their careers including principal boys Ada Reeve, Florence Lloyd and Daisy Wood, the latter two being sisters of the famous Marie Lloyd. Among the dames the comedians Wilkie Bard and Horace Mills were popular with audiences, many of whom travelled from further afield on special trains arranged by Chute. The panto's ballet was rehearsed for three weeks before the opening night and the rest of the cast for two weeks. If the pantomime ran for too long when it opened at Christmas it was cut.Carleton, p. 17 Pantomimes at the Prince's Theatre, Bristol - 1867 to 1939:Pantomime at the Prince's Theatre, Bristol - PantoArchive.com - the Online Home of Panto ===New Theatre Royal (1867-1884)=== *1867-68 - Aladdin *1868-69 - Field of the Cloth Of Gold *1869-70 - Robinson Crusoe - scene of the disaster that saw 18 killed *1870-71 - The Forty Thieves *1871-72 - Dick Whittington *1872-73 - Tom Thumb *1873-74 - Valentine and Orson *1874-75 - Red Riding Hood *1875-76 - Little Cinderella *1876-77 - Babes in the Wood *1877-78 - Beauty and the Beast *1878-79 - The House that Jack Built *1879-80 - Sinbad the Sailor *1880-81 - Jack and the Beanstalk *1881-82 - Aladdin *1882-83 - Dick Whittington *1883-84 - Cinderella ===Prince's Theatre (1884-1939)=== *1884-85 - The Forty Thieves *1885-86 - Red Riding Hood *1886-87 - Sinbad the Sailor *1887-88 - Babes in the Wood *1888-89 - Robinson Crusoe *1889-90 - Sweet Cinderella *1890-91 - Aladdin *1891-92 - Dick Whittington *1892-93 - Babes in the Wood *1893-94 - The Naughty Forty Thieves - Marie Montrose *1894-95 - Little Bo-Peep *1895-96 - Cinderella - Frances Earle and Katie Barry *1896-97 - Robinson Crusoe *1897-98 - Red Riding Hood *1898-99 - Sinbad the Sailor *1899-00 - Aladdin - Ada Reeve *1900-01 - Dick Whittington *1901-02 - Babes in the Wood *1902-03 - Cinderella *1903-04 - Puss in Boots *1904-05 - The Sleeping Beauty *1905-06 - Mother Goose - Lily Morris and Wilkie Bard *1906-07 - Humpty Dumpty - Horace Mills as the Dame *1907-08 - Jack and Jill - Lily MorrisLily Morris as Jack in the pantomime Jack and Jill at the Prince’s Theatre, Bristol, Christmas 1907 - Footlight Notes website and 'Nipper' Lane *1908-09 - Aladdin - Bransby Williams, Daisy Wood and Ouida MacDermott *1909-10 - Mother Hubbard - G.

In 1896 the pantomime was followed by a short Harlequinade and then by a showing of early films. In 1912 'Jimmy' Chute died and the Prince's became a limited company with the theatre being managed by Abigail Philomena Chute (née Henessy, 1855-1931), his widow, together with her co-director, John Hart. The finances needed to mount 'in house' productions became increasingly difficult to raise and the Prince's became reliant on touring productions and its annual pantomimes in order to survive. In addition, the growth of cinema as a popular leisure activity caused serious competition to the Prince's. In February 1913 the Prince's Theatre was converted into a full-time cinema but by 1915 it had reverted to live theatre.Prince's Theatre, Park Row, Bristol, BS1 - Cinema Treasures After Abigail Chute died in 1931 John Hart continued to run the theatre until 1936. Abigail's son, Desmond Macready Chute, had become a Roman Catholic priest by this time and was living in Rapallo in Italy and so had no interest in taking over the management of the theatre, which passed to Tommy Hicksons. For a period from 1935 he was forced to rebrand the Prince's as a variety house and music hall, but the subsequent loss of income resulted in the theatre not getting its badly needed refurbishment and redecoration. Eventually the Prince's reverted to a venue for touring theatrical companies for the last few years of its existence. The Prince's Theatre, which had been a popular touring venue for many years for companies from the West End of London was destroyed in the Bristol Blitz during World War II together with the Coliseum Theatre opposite it when they were both hit by bombs on 24 November 1940. Initially, there were plans to rebuild the theatre but the site was sold in 1954 and flats, named Irving House and Terry House after actors Sir Henry Irving and Dame Ellen Terry, who had played at the Prince's Theatre, were built on the site instead. ==References== Category:Bristol Category:Buildings and structures in Bristol Category:Theatres in Bristol Category:Former theatres in England Category:1867 establishments in England Category:Theatres completed in 1867 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1940 ","title":"Prince's Theatre, Bristol"},{"id":"63916409","text":"Edmundo Eluchans Urenda (born 21 January 1950) is a Chilean politician who served as President of the Chamber of Deputies and as a member of the Chamber of Deputies, representing Districts 14 and 15 of the Valparaíso Region. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile Category:Independent Democratic Union politicians Category:Pontifical Catholic University of Chile alumni ","title":"Edmundo Eluchans"},{"id":"63916413","text":"Tamim Al-Dawsari (, born 4 June 1989) is a Saudi Arabian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Al-Nahda. ==Career== Al-Dawsari began his career at the youth team of Al-Nassr.

After he had preached in Messina in 1552, the archbishop, Cardinal Giovanni Andrea Mercurio, sought papal intervention to have him return in 1554.

It was created to increase communication among Lincoln's women's and lesbian groups, and to publish and promote artwork and writing by women. Woman's Journal-Advocate was named for two nineteenth- century feminist newspapers, Woman's Journal and The Woman's Advocate. According to journalist C. J. Janovy, \\"Lincoln was a hotbed of lesbian political activity\\" in the time leading up to the newspaper's founding. Some of the newspaper's content advocated political lesbianism and feminist separatism. The newspaper contained reviews of and publicity for lesbian and feminist artists and performers, such as Judy Chicago, and hoped to foster a \\"Feminist Aesthetic\\" of distinctively feminist styles in artwork. The newspaper frequently dealt forcefully with the subjects of rape and domestic violence. It reported on local cases and statistics measuring these crimes, and on volunteer and official responses to them. It aimed for political and social reform, including a greater acceptance of women who respond with violence toward their attackers. Co-founders of the newspaper include linguist Julia Penelope, journalist Martha Stoddard, and poets Linnea Johnson and Judith Sornberger. The paper printed writing by Helen Longino, Sonia Johnson, Moira Ferguson, Carol Lee Sanchez, Barbara A. Baier, Lin Quenzer, and many other feminist writers, particularly of Nebraska and the Midwest region. It printed dispatches from the Lincoln Legion of Lesbians, Queer Nation Nebraska, the YWCA and other organizations. ==See also== * Second-wave feminism * Feminist sex wars * LGBT rights in Nebraska * Lincoln Legion of Lesbians * OutNebraska ==References== Category:Mass media in Lincoln, Nebraska Category:Newspapers published in Nebraska Category:Publications established in 1982 Category:1982 establishments in Nebraska Category:Defunct women's magazines published in the United States Category:History of women's rights in the United States Category:Feminist newspapers ","title":"Woman's Journal-Advocate"},{"id":"63916596","text":"Korneliya Nikolaeva Naydenova (; born 1 February 1982) is a Bulgarian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper.

One difference is that its aft-mounted aerodynamic fins are fixed rather than foldable like those on the ATACMS, requiring deployment from rectangular launch canisters. It flies in a \\"variable ballistic trajectory,\\" flattening out at a lower altitude (below around ) than traditional SRBMs like the Scud where the atmosphere is dense enough so the missile's fins can maintain aerodynamic control over its entire flight and dive toward the target. Use of INS updated with satellite-guidance data could make it accurate to within 100 meters CEP, or 200 meters using INS alone. Although the missile is outwardly similar to the ATACMS, it has demonstrated greater range, suggesting its physical dimensions are larger; it appears to share a common booster with the KN-23 and is estimated to carry a 400-500 kg payload with a unitary or submunition warhead. The KN-24 is likely to replace older liquid-fueled North Korean SRBMs like the Hwasong-5 and Hwasong-6, as its non-parabolic trajectory makes it more survivable against missile defense systems and its increased accuracy reduces the number of missiles that would be needed to destroy a single target.KN-24.

An international co-production of Austria and Germany, the film stars Lena Watson as an android who was built by a father (Dominik Warta) as a replicate of his young daughter who disappeared years prior. The Trouble with Being Born premiered at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, and garnered controversy for its depiction of a relationship between a man and an android that resembles his child. ==Cast== * Lena Watson as Elli/Emil, an android built by Georg * Dominik Warta as Georg * Ingrid Burkhard as Ms. Schikowa * Jana McKinnon as Elli, Georg's human daughter * Simon Hatzl as Toni ==Production== Director and co-writer Sandra Wollner has referred to the film as an \\"antithesis to Pinocchio\\". Wollner initially intended to cast a 20-year-old actress in the role of the android Elli, but after removing some of the more explicit elements from the film's script, she instead chose 10-year-old actress Lena Watson (a stage name inspired by Emma Watson) for the part. The scenes in which the android Elli is depicted nude were accomplished using computer-generated imagery. Watson also wore a silicone mask and wig, which served to both conceal her identity and help her resemble another actress who appears later in the film. ==Release and reception== The Trouble with Being Born had its world premiere at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival on 25 February 2020, as part of the festival's Encounters section. It was reported that several audience members walked out during the premiere. The film received the Special Jury Award in the Encounters section. Jonathan Romney of Screen Daily called the film \\"a powerful and revelatory achievement [...] complex, artfully crafted, sometimes wilfully perplexing\\". Jessica Kiang of Variety called it a \\"desperately creepy, queasy, thought-provoking film\\", and concluded: \\"Wollner's lacerating intelligence and riveting craft make this extraordinarily effed-up riff on the 'Pinocchio' legend [...] much more than empty provocation\\". Chris Barsanti of Slant Magazine gave the film a rating of two out of four stars, and wrote that the film \\"suffers from the same issue as its moody androids: enervation borne out of repetition.\\" The Melbourne International Film Festival decided to not screen the film at its 2020 festival, citing concerns raised by two forensic psychologists that it might \\"[normalise] sexual interest in children\\" and be \\"used as a source of arousal for men interested in child abuse material\\". The decision to remove the film from the festival line-up was denounced by film critics Peter Krausz, Tom Ryan and David Stratton. ==ReferencesCategory:2020 films Category:2020 drama films Category:2020 science fiction films Category:Austrian films Category:Austrian drama films Category:Austrian science fiction films Category:German films Category:German drama films Category:German science fiction films Category:Android (robot) films ","title":"The Trouble with Being Born (film)"},{"id":"63916827","text":"Deer Creek is a small stream, a right tributary of Matadero Creek, originating in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains in Santa Clara County, California, United States.

A plaque over the central window on the first floor commemorates that the playwright and theatre historian Thomas Overskou lived in the building as a child. ==History== Two smaller houses at the site were destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The two lots were acquired by Carl Christian Madsen for 1,115 rigsdaler and merged. He initiated the construction of a tenement house at the site but had prior to its completion in 1798 already sold it to wigmaker Carl Christian Wegner for 8,500 rigsdaler. The small apartments were rented out to low-income families for a biannual rent of six Danish rigsdaler for a one and a half room apartment (1801). Wegner lived in the apartment on the ground floor towards the street. In 1802, he sold the building for 9,700 rigsdaler. The new owner, Peter Hansen, a former coachman, opened a grocer's shop in the ground floor. The rear wing alone contained 16 apartments. The later playwright and theatre historian Thomas Overskou lived with his parents in one of the small apartments as a child from April 1806. His father was a worker in the sugar refinery at Store Larsbjørnsstræde 9. Hansen and a maid named Margrethe saved the property from the flames during the British bombardment on the night between 3 and 4 September 1807 by putting out 17 bombs and five fire arrows. According to Thomas Overskou, who has described the events in his memoirs, the two people never fully recovered from the physical and psychological stress of the situation. Hansen owned the property until his death 12 years later. His widow sold it to grocer Jeppe Petersen in 1830. The building was from 1862 to circa 1891 owned by master painter C. Jensen. The next owner was master mason J. Larsen. The building was in 1919 together with other old houses in the neighbourhood acquired by the University of Copenhagen to allow for a later extension of its premises. ==Architecture== The commemorative plaque The building consists of four storeys over a raised cellar and is seven bays wide. A plaque over the central window on the first floor commemorates that Thomas Overskou lived in the building as a child.

Its territory had only been conjoined to Italy at the end of the First World War. He tried, with limited success, to meet the government's demands for imposing the Italian language against the resistance of his Slovene clergy. He was hampered in this situation by his personal preference for the Italian nationalist point of view. He was arrested at gunpoint and expelled from Gorizia by Yugoslav troops in May 1945 during their brief occupation of the city. He returned after the end of World War Two to an archdiocese that had lost almost two-thirds of its area with the redrawing of national boundaries.

He ruled the Akure Kingdom from 1882 until 1890. His lineal descendants are today known as the House of Osupa/Odundun. They serve as one of Akure's two legally recognized royal families. ==Early life== Oba Odundun I was born as Prince Adegboro Adeagbo in Benin City around the year 1820. He was the son of Oba Osupa I, who ruled Akure from 1834 until 1846, and through him claimed hereditary kinship with all of the preceding rulers of both Akure and the neighbouring kingdoms of Ijeshaland and Ikereland. Two years before his birth, in 1818, the Kingdom of Benin had invaded his father's homeland and executed Oba Arakale, his paternal grandfather. The invaders spared his father however, who lived in Benin City for a long period of time and ultimately had Odundun. Through his paternal grandmother, who was a daughter of Oba Akengbuda of Benin, he also claimed direct descent from the imperial dynasty that had provided the Oba of Benin since the medieval period, and through it could therefore trace his lineage all the way back to antiquity. It was due to the fact that his grandmother was a Bini princess that his father Osupa – Akengbuda's grandson through her – had been spared during the invasion. ==Reign== Odundun returned to his homeland, Akure, when his father became king in 1834. His father died in 1846, and at some point, he married and had several children, including Prince Adegbite,http://heritageechonews.blogspot.com/2015/01/prince-abewaajoye- gbadeyanka-oluwole.html and a daughter, who was later expelled from the kingdom in the early 1890s. In 1882, the Deji of Akure, Oba Ojijigogun – who was his great uncle (as the younger brother of his father) – died. This created a vacancy in the office, and several eligible princes sought the throne, including Odundun and his cousins, the three sons of the deceased king: Arosoye, Ifaturoti, and Olofinlade.http://saharareporters.com/2014/01/07/daunting-task-akure-king- makers-dr-wumi-akintide Oba Odundun was selected and crowned shortly afterwards. One of the main things Oba Odundun I did was to sever the ties between Akure and Benin. When his father had become king in 1834, Akure began to pay a yearly tribute to the Benin Kingdom, and had continued doing so until Oba Odundun refused to pay it any longer. It is said that the officers that were sent to enforce control of Akure were oppressive and often raped and killed the people that they met there, so when Oba Odundun heard of this, he refused to pay the tribute anymore.http://saharareporters.com/2015/06/12/reasons-celebrate-his-royal- highness-new-deji-akure-odundun-ii-part-i-dr-wumi- akintidehttps://www.operanewsapp.com/ng/en/share/detail?news_id=3669e075f9ba1e20397b1a68f1dbed2b&news;_entry_id=s30b45b34200227en_ng&open;_type=transcoded&request;_id=DETAIL_EXPLORE_4641b340-7700-4ad5-a9a5-13d50f25d1e9&from;=news Benin was unable to react at the time, as they were fighting against the British occupation that would eventually culminate in the Benin Expedition of 1897.https://www.operanewsapp.com/ng/en/share/detail?news_id=3669e075f9ba1e20397b1a68f1dbed2b&news;_entry_id=s30b45b34200227en_ng&open;_type=transcoded&request;_id=DETAIL_EXPLORE_4641b340-7700-4ad5-a9a5-13d50f25d1e9&from;=news This act gave the Oba his oriki \\"Asodedero,\\" which means One who makes the town peaceful.

After this, his father's direct lineage wouldn't produce another monarch for the duration of the succeeding century. His cousin Oba Arosoye became king, and when he died Prince Olofinlade, who had competed for the throne with him in 1882, succeeded. He ruled for the following 60 years as Oba Adesida I, thus establishing the Adesida dynasty that ruled Akure for 100 consecutive years. In the early 1990s, the Osupa family was recognized as one of the official ruling houses of the Akure Kingdom by the military administration of Ondo State. It has since provided two further monarchs, including current incumbent Oba Odundun II. A prominent member of the Osupa/Odundun royal family is Oloye Olu Falae, a descendant of Oba Odundun I's father Oba Osupa and Oba Odundun's great-great nephew. Falae was a civil servant and politician who served as secretary to the Government of the Federation during the administration of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. He also ran for the office of the president of Nigeria following the resumption of democracy in 1999.

She is Director of Research and Education at the Stanford Health Communication Initiative. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Yasmin helped to debunk myths about the coronavirus. == Education and early career == Yasmin was born in the United Kingdom. Her mother, Yasmin Halima, is a Distinguished Careers Institute fellow who works on women's health. She grew up in Nuneaton and moved to London to attend high school. At the age of seventeen, Yasmin decided that she wanted to take her mother's first name as her surname, and had her name changed with a lawyer. Yasmin trained in biochemistry at Queen Mary University of London and graduated in 2005. She moved to the University of Cambridge to complete a graduate programme in medicine. She started her medical career in the National Health Service, working at Homerton University Hospital for one year. In 2010 Yasmin was awarded a University of California, Los Angeles fellowship to train in clinical research in Botswana. She moved to the United States with her mother. In 2011, Yasmin joined the Epidemic Intelligence Service as an officer at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where she studied outbreaks of disease in prisons, border towns and American Indian reservations. Whilst studying an outbreak of flesh eating bacteria in the Navajo Nation, Yasmin realised the power of effective science communication, and realised that she wanted to use journalism to shift public policy. == Career == In 2013 Yasmin was made a Dalla Lana Global Journalism Fellow at the University of Toronto. Here she focussed on telling the stories of epidemics in an effort to encourage others to learn from tragedy. Soon after completing her fellowship, Yasmin joined The Dallas Morning News as a reporter. Her work there included coverage of the Ebola crisis in Dallas and the epidemic of gun violence in the US. She was a medical analyst for CNN, and had a weekly medical segment on television news partner NBC 5 DFW. She held a simultaneous position as Professor of Public Health at the University of Texas at Dallas. Yasmin delivered the 2016 University of Texas at Austin McGovern Lecture, where she discussed the lessons she had learned reporting from public health emergencies. Yasmin joined Stanford University as a John S. Knight Fellow in 2017. There she investigated the spread of misinformation and pseudoscience during epidemics. As part of this fellowship, Yasmin started working with Wired to debunk pseudoscience and misinformation on YouTube. She delivered a talk at the TEDx OakLawn event in 2018. In 2019 Yasmin was appointed as Director of the Stanford University Health Communication Initiative. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Yasmin used social media, podcasts, and popular science articles to better inform the public about the coronavirus disease. Unfortunately, SARS- CoV-2 resulted not only in the spread of both coronavirus, but an overwhelming amount of misinformation. Yasmin became one of the most trusted public health experts on social media. She used webinars to teach students about how to report responsibly on medical emergencies. In an interview with Bumble, Yasmin explained how to date during the pandemic. == Selected publications == === Peer-reviewed scientific papers === * * === Selected works === * The Impatient Dr. Lange: One Man's Fight to End the Global HIV Epidemic * * Her second book, Muslim Women Are Everything, started as a conversation on Twitter and ended as a six-figure book deal. == Awards and honours == * 2016 University of North Texas Mayborn Award for Literary Non-Fiction * 2016 nominated for an Emmy Award for her documentary Hidden Threat: The Kissing Bug and Chagas Disease * 2017 John S.

In these cases, the basic reproduction number of the virus, which is the average number of additional people that a single case will infect without any preventative measures, can be as high as 3.9. Interhuman transmission is a synonym for HHT. The World Health Organization designation of a pandemic hinges on the demonstrable fact that there is sustained HHT in two regions of the world. ==Synopsis== Relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, spraying of liquids, toilet flushing or any activities which generate aerosol particles or droplets or generate fomites, such as raising of dust. A 2007 study showed that influenza virus was still active on stainless steel 24 hours after contamination. Though on hands it survives only for five minutes, the constant contact with steel almost certainly transmits infection. Transfer efficiency depends not only on surface, but also on pathogen type. For example, avian influenza survives on both porous and non- porous materials for 144 hours. The pathogens may also be transmitted by poor use of cutlery or improper sanitation of dishes or bedlinen. Particularly problematic are toilet practices, which lead to the fecal-oral route. STDs are by definition spread through this vector. ==List of HHT diseases== Examples of some HHT diseases are listed below. ===Controlled=== * measles: vaccine available * mumps: vaccine available * chicken pox: vaccine available * small pox * bubonic plague: slim non-nil risk * pneumonic plague: 1910-11 Manchurian plague * tuberculosis * Norovirus * monkeypox * SARS-CoV-1 * MERS * Avian flu * Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs): ** Syphilis, aka French pox ===Uncontrolled=== * SARS-CoV-2 ==References== ===Sources=== * * Category:Epidemiology Category:Parasitology Category:Infectious diseases Category:Sanitation Category:Hygiene Category:Global health Category:Epidemics ","title":"Human-to-human transmission"},{"id":"63917273","text":"Neil E.

He was a professor of archaeology and director of the Biological-Archaeological Institute at the University of Groningen between 1954 and 1987. Waterbolk was known for his interdisciplinary approach and combined his work in archaeology with insights in nature and landscapes. He worked in a wide variety of countries, but had special interest in the Northern part of the Netherlands and especially his home province of Drenthe. ==Early life== Waterbolk was born on 18 May 1924 in Havelte. His father Albert was the municipal clerk (Dutch: gemeentesecretaris) of Havelte. From an early age Waterbolk had an interest in nature, with this interest being supported by his parents, teachers and townspeople of Havelte. In 1942 he became a member of the during his youth, which further strengthened his interest in nature. Waterbolk attended the University of Groningen to study biology and later botany. During this period he familiarized himself with phytosociology through mentor Victor Westhoff. Only in 1945 he became familiarized with archaeology when he met Albert Egges van Giffen, who was looking for someone with knowledge of palynology. Waterbolk would work as an assistant for Van Giffen between 1945 and 1951. In 1946 he performed his first excavation, in his home town of Havelte. Since Waterbolk had signed the during World War II, he was prevented from taking exams until 1948. In 1949 he spent half a year with Danish palaeoecologist Johannes Iversen. Waterbolk worked for the Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij between 1951 and 1954. He obtained his doctorate at the University of Groningen in 1954 with a thesis titled: De praehistorische mens en zijn milieu : een palynologisch onderzoek naar de menselijke invloed op de plantengroei van de diluviale gronden in Nederland. ==Career and research== After obtaining his PhD Waterbolk was appointed professor of archaeology at the University of Groningen the same year and he succeeded Albert Egges van Giffen in this position. He had a teaching assignment in Prehistoric and Germanic archaeology. Apart from being professor Waterbolk also served as director of the Biological-Archaeological Institute of the University. He retired in 1987. After retiring Waterbolk made a further 120 academic publications. Waterbolk's archaeological work spanned a period between the prehistory and the Middle Ages. He had influence in the development and usage of radiocarbon dating and palynology in the Netherlands. During his career he performed excavations in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Syria (Bouqras), Serbia (Vojvodina) and Turkey. He had a special interest in the Northern Netherlands and the province of Drenthe where he led excavations in Odoorn, Elp and Gasselte. He looked intensively into the spread of agriculture in societies. Waterbolk also had an academic interest in house plans and cultural landscapes. In his works he combined geology, soil science, biology, physical and historical geography. Waterbolk was considered as one of the most eminent post-World War II archaeologists of the Netherlands, having shaped archaeology in the Netherlands together with and Pieter J.R. Modderman. Waterbolk was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970. ===Tjerk Vermaning case=== Waterbolk was known for his involvement in surfacing the archaeological forgery case of Tjerk Vermaning of the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s Vermaning stated that he had found stone tools, which were dated back to thousands of years by Waterbolk. In 1973 Waterbolk still applauded Vermaning for his discoveries while his assistant, Dick Stapert, was performing his doctoral studies on the findings of Vermaning. However, in 1975 Stapert concluded that they were forgeries. Vermaning was subsequently prosecuted for forgery and fraud. He was first convicted and on appeal acquitted. The case caused a deterioration in the relations between academic and amateur archaeologists in the Northern Netherlands and led to death threats against Waterbolk and Stapert. It also did not leave Waterbolk without criticism, especially whether he could have surfaced the forgeries at an earlier stage. Even after retiring Waterbolk tried to clear-up the details of the case and in 2003 wrote the book Scherpe stenen op mijn pad about his views on the case. ==Personal life== In 2015 the book Werk van Eeuwen by Jos Bazelmans en Jan Kolen, describing conversations with Waterbolk was published. In 2019, at age 95, he published his autobiography, Veranderend leven. Waterbolk was married to a botanical analyst, he met his wife at the Nederlandse Jeugdbond voor Natuur. He once stated that the most beautiful thing he ever dug up was his wife. Waterbolk was an honorary member of . Waterbolk died on 27 September 2020 in Haren, Groningen, aged 96. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Dutch archaeologists Category:Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:People from Westerveld Category:University of Groningen alumni Category:University of Groningen faculty ","title":"Tjalling Waterbolk"},{"id":"63917679","text":"Dræet is a small Danish island off the northern coast of Funen and south of Æbelø, located in Nordfyn municipality.

Today, there is a plaque to note where the cemetery once stood. It is considered one of the Historic Cemeteries of New Orleans The adjacent Chalmette National Cemetery, then Monument Cemetery, was established in 1864 to bury Union soldiers. The cemetery was also burying those who died in the refugee camps and hospitals within Union lines. Within two years, they realized they would quickly run out of space as the civilian burials were outpacing the soldier burials and they were expecting more reinterments from nearby forts and battlegrounds. The Freedmen's Bureau, formally the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, was established in 1865 as a US government agency to help people with the transition from enslaved to free. The agency faced many obstacles, notably the Black Codes, but they did what they could. In 1867, they started reinterring over 4,000 people to the new area. New burials were mainly from the Freedmen's Hospital. The cemetery was well maintained and new burials were marked with wooden headboards. There are approximately 716 burials from 1867 to 1869 and most of the names and causes of death were recorded. The original records exist at the National Archive. The digital copies are available at Family Search's website. In 1869, Freedmen's Hospital was shuttered and by 1872 the entire agency was disabled. By 1873, a memo from the Quartermaster's Office noted the cemetery was abandoned. The national cemetery had no desire to acquire or maintain the property and erected a brick wall to separate the cemeteries. The land was then owned by the city of New Orleans and was sold in 1875 for the Archicultural & Mechanical College. The Chairman of the Board of the college made attempts to have the national cemetery take over the cemetery as he saw evidence of U.S. Colored Troops buried there and could still see some markers, but no movement was made by the federal government. Today, the cemetery is within the Chalmette Battlefield, which is part of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve. There has been ground penetrating radar studies done, but the results are inconclusive due to the depth of the bodies. The river levee was only knee-high, so the river would flood often making more dirt on top of the existing soil. == References == Category:African-American cemeteries Category:Cemeteries in Louisiana ","title":"Freedmen's Cemetery"},{"id":"63917734","text":"Natanael is a given name.

The idea garnered traction starting in the 1960s via rags-to-riches stories in the national news media, and became widely promoted within the Cuban American community. The idea has been criticized as an inaccurate depiction of Cuban Americans that ignores historical fact. ==Myth== ===Background=== In the years 1959 to 1962 various Cuban exiles would leave the island and become referred to as \\"golden exiles\\". Most of the exiles in this period were anti-communist and upper-class who were successful under the regime of Fulgencio Batista and were fleeing the dangers of the successful Cuban Revolution. The US government and national media began promoting an image of the exiles as exceptional people worth of Americans' sympathy, and birth the idea of the Cuban success story. Later emigration waves would not consist of the same homogeneous upper-class population and not garner the same public sympathy, especially the emigrants of the Mariel boatlift. The Cuban success story also became popular in Cuban exile circles. The idea that Cubans in the United States were economic successful was embraced as a tool to convince Cubans in Cuba of the advantages of emigrating. The Cuban success story's popularity allowed it to become accepted in various academic circles, policy making groups, and journalist organizations. By the time of the 1980 Mariel boatlift the image of Cuban immigrants as \\"golden exiles\\" began to fade as popular media began to characterize Marielitos as lone males, criminals, and homosexuals. ===Narrative=== The narrative of the Cuban success story goes that Cuban exiles left the country after the 1959 revolution for solely political reasons. Cuban exiles firmly disagreed with the communist government of Cuba and had no intentions of emigrating for better economic opportunities outside of Cuba. The exiles were mainly middle class and highly skilled, with occupational skill, high education, and language abilities that they brought with them to the United States. Most of the emigrants were light skinned and encountered little if any racial prejudice in the United States. In general Cuban exiles were economically successful and conservative becoming a perfect model minority in the United States, and a prime example of the accessibility of the American dream. ==Criticism== ===Political motives=== Sheila L. Croucher has argued that the propagation of the Cuban success story was a propaganda tool that supported the interest of North American capitalists, the U.S. government and even some Cuban exiles. Sociologists Francisco Hernández Vázquez and Rodolfo D. Torres have asserted that the story also helped ease the worries of Americans that may have doubted why the government gave Cubans immigration privileges and federal aid. Scholar Gregory Helmick has noted that some early Cuban exiles adopted the term \\"Golden exile\\" to differentiate themselves from later Cuban exiles such as those of the Mariel boatlift. This identity emphasized their ideological purity, machismo, and racial whiteness. ===Ignoring realities=== Scholar Maria Vidal de Haymes argued in 1997 that the relevance of the Cuban success story ignores recorded economic realities. The story ignores that general Cuban American household incomes have been recorded as substantially lower than general non-Latino household incomes in the United States. It also ignores the high rates of poverty among recent Cuban immigrants, Afro-Cubans, and Cuban-American children. Scholar Lisandro Perez has noted in 1986 that the Cuban success story popularizes the idea of a skyrocketing economic mobility for Cubans that is not based in fact, but Cubans have been recorded as having a much higher average income that other Hispanic groups in the United States. This disparity is so much so, that it is far greater than the disparity between the incomes of Cubans and non-Latinos. Scholar Jorge Duany has argued that Cubans are not as economically successful as propagated in the Cuban success story, and Cubans must suffer through cultural assimilation difficulties that every immigrant group goes through. He also argues that the story only resembles the reality of the early Golden exile and not of other working class Cubans that came in later emigration waves. ==References== Category:Cuban-American history Category:Cuban diaspora Category:History of Miami Category:Historical revisionism Category:Cold War history of the United States Category:Cold War history of Cuba Category:Propaganda legends Category:Anti-communism in the United States ","title":"Cuban success story"},{"id":"63917773","text":"Passe may refer to: * Passe, Angola, a commune in Angola * Passe, Ouest, a village in Haiti * Passe language, an extinct language of South America * Passé, an English adjective meaning \\"outdated\\" * Loel Passe (1917–1997), American sports announcer == See also == * * La Passe FC, a football club of the Seychelles * Passe-passe, a 2008 French film * Zec des Passes, a protected area in Canada * Passee, a municipality in Germany * Pase (disambiguation) ","title":"Passe"},{"id":"63917781","text":"Maria, Lady Eardley is an oil on canvas painting by the English artist Thomas Gainsborough from c. 1770.

He was a contemporary of Joshua Reynolds and they both specialised in portraits of the British aristocracy.

Known as the Clontarf Cowboy he gained international recognition touring and recording with artists such as the Everly Brothers, Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith, Townes Van Zandt, John Prine and Donovan. ==Career== Donnelly began his music career in the late 1960s with the Dublin-based band Portrait which morphed into the rock band Elmer Fudd, the band supported Thin Lizzy in 1971. Later that year Philip Donnelly left the band to tour with Donovan. After touring with Donovan in 1974, Donnelly decided to settle in Los Angeles, where he first began to work with Lee Clayton. Donnelly would eventually work on four Lee Clayton albums as a guitarist, composer and supplying backing vocals. Donnelly had unique style as a guitarist, blending rock, folk, Irish traditional music and country which saw him become a much in demand session musician. He moved to Nashville where he came to the attention of producer Jim Rooney. Over the next eleven years he worked with a number of country and folks artists including: Guy Clark, Don Williams, Jim Rooney, Emmylou Harris, The Everly Brothers and Johnny Cash. In particular he was associated with Nanci Griffith playing guitar on eight of her albums, including her grammy winning album Other Voices, Other Rooms. He also co-wrote the Crystal Gayle hit \\"Livin' in These Troubled Times\\". ==Ireland== In his native Ireland he is perhaps best known for his work with John Prine. Donnelly played guitar on John Prine's albums Aimless Love and German Afternoons. He first met Prine in 1980 and played and toured with Prine throughout the 1980s and early '90s. In 1986 Donnelly was also responsible for bringing Prine to Ireland for the first time, where he played a number of small venues before Donnelly invited Prine to take part in his televised concert series for RTÉ called The Sessions, recorded at the newly opened Point Depot in 1988. Donnelly returned to Ireland in the late 1980s to help care for his mother, settling in Clonmell, Co. Tipperary. He continued to write music and worked with a number of Irish artists including Clannad, the Fleadh Cowboys, The Hothouse Flowers and De Dannan. In 1994 he produced Townes Van Zandt's last studio album No Deeper Blue. In 1978 Donnelly had played guitar on Van Zandt's album Flyin' Shoes and Van Zandt claimed that it came to him in a dream that he should make another record with Philip Donnelly. Van Zandt flew to Ireland where Donnelly had booked ten days at the Xeric studios in Limerick. For the recording Donnelly brought together some of the leading folk and traditional musicians in Ireland, including Robbie Brennan on drums, Declan Masterson on the Uilleann pipes and Paul Kelly on fiddle. The singer- songwriter Donovan also appears on the album playing harmonica. From the mid-90s onward Donnelly toured Ireland and recorded as a solo artist and with his band The Regulators. In 2015 he released his final album \\"Beyond The Pale\\" his first studio album for nearly 15 years, which included duets with John Prine and Crystal Gale. ==Discography== ;Philip Donnelly * Town and Country (1988) * Silver Station (1991) * Live At The Midleton Folk Club Philip Donnelly And The Free Range Picker's Almost Unplugged (2003) * Beyond the Pale (2015) ;The Regulators * Inner Feelings (1995) * The Spirit of Communication (1997) ==Death== Philip Donnelly died in University Hospital Waterford, at the age of 70. == References == Category:Irish musicians Category:Irish songwriters Category:1948 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Clontarf, Dublin ","title":"Philip Donnelly (musician)"},{"id":"63917795","text":"Foxlease and Ancells Meadows is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest on the western outskirts of Farnborough in Hampshire.The site is in seven areas, two of which are nature reserves managed by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, Ancells Farm and Whitehouse Meadow.

Semiconductor saturable absorbers were used for laser mode-locking as early as 1974 when p-type germanium is used to mode lock a CO2 laser which generated pulses of around 500 picoseconds. Modern SESAMs are III-V semiconductor single quantum well (SQW) or multiple quantum wells grown on semiconductor distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). They were initially used in a Resonant Pulse Modelocking (RPM) scheme as starting mechanisms for Ti:Sapphire lasers which employed KLM as a fast saturable absorber . RPM is another coupled-cavity mode-locking technique. Different from APM lasers which employ non-resonant Kerr-type phase nonlinearity for pulse shortening, RPM employs the amplitude nonlinearity provided by the resonant band filling effects of semiconductors. SESAMs were soon developed into intracavity saturable absorber devices because of more inherent simplicity with this structure. Since then, the use of SESAMs has enabled the pulse durations, average powers, pulse energies and repetition rates of ultra- fast solid-state lasers to be improved by several orders of magnitude. Average power of 60W and repetition rate up to 160GHz were obtained. By using SESAM- assisted KLM, sub-six-femtosecond pulses directly from a Ti: Sapphire oscillator were achieved. Ursula Keller invented and demonstrated the semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM) which demonstrated the first passively mode-locked diode-pumped solid-state laser in 1992. \\"For almost two decades since then, her group at ETH Zurich has continued to define and push the frontier in ultrafast solid-state lasers both with detailed theoretical models and with world-leading experimental results, demonstrating orders of magnitude improvement in key features such as pulse duration, energy, and repetition rate. She also helped to spearhead industrial transfer of this technology. Today most ultrashort lasers are based on SESAM modelocking, with important industrial applications ranging from optical communication, precision measurements, microscopy, ophthalmology, and micromachining.\\" A major advantage SESAMs have over other saturable absorber techniques is that absorber parameters can be easily controlled over a wide range of values. For example, saturation fluence can be controlled by varying the reflectivity of the top reflector while modulation depth and recovery time can be tailored by changing the low temperature growing conditions for the absorber layers. This freedom of design has further extended the application of SESAMs into modelocking of fiber lasers where a relatively high modulation depth is needed to ensure self-starting and operation stability. Fiber lasers working at 1 µm and 1.5 µm were successfully demonstrated.H. Zhang et al., \\"Induced solitons formed by cross polarization coupling in a birefringent cavity fiber laser\\" , Opt.

Accessed 1 Apr. 2020. == Description == Hellbenders are known for their primitive body design and their large size. They have small eyes, a keeled tail, and a flat body to assist the Ozark hellbender in movement in rivers and streams. They have folds along their sides that assist them in respiration, as oxygen is able to diffuse across the skin. It is a strictly aquatic species, even though it technically lacks gills.Guimond, Robert W., and Victor H. Hutchison. “Aquatic Respiration: An Unusual Strategy in the Hellbender Cryptobranchus Alleganiensis Alleganiensis (Daudin).” Science, American Association for the Advancement of Science, 21 Dec. 1973. On average, they are about 29-57 centimeters in length. == Distribution and habitat == Ozark hellbenders are endemic to the White River drainage in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri. Historically they have been found in portions of Spring, White, Black, Eleven Point, and Current Rivers and their tributaries. Hellbenders are now considered extirpated in the mainstem White, Black, and Spring Rivers and Jacks Fork, and with their range being considerably reduced in the remaining rivers and tributaries.Johnson, T. R. (2000): The amphibians and reptiles of Missouri. Jefferson, MO: Missouri Department of Conservation. The Ozark hellbender is declining throughout its range with no population appearing to be stable throughout its range.Wheeler, B. A., E. Prosen, A. Mathis, and R. F. Wilkinson. 2003. Population declines of a long-lived salamander: a 20+-year study of hellbenders, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis. Biological Conservation 109:151-156. It is unknown whether a viable population exists in the mainstem of the White River, where few individuals have been found. Much of the potential habitat along this river has been destroyed by a series of dams constructed on the upper portion of the river in the 1940s and 1950s.Irwin, K. 2008. Ozark hellbender long-term monitoring SWG project. Final Report. Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, Benton, Arkansas. The North Fork White River has historically contained a high population of Ozark hellbenders and was considered the strong point for the species with a mark and recapture study in 1973 marking 1,150 individuals within a 1.7-mile reach of the river.Peterson, C. L., R. F. Wilkinson, Jr., M. S. Topping, and D. E. Metter. 1983. Age and growth of the Ozark hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi). Copeia 1983(1):225-231. In recent years, this population is now beginning to experience a decline similar to those in populations in other rivers. Though the overall population of the Ozark hellbender is known to be in decline, there is no data available on current population sizes, likely due to their small numbers and reclusive life history. There is currently no critical habitat designated for the Ozark hellbender. Ozark hellbenders are frequently found underneath large flat rocks in rocky, fast flowing streams in the Ozark Plateau at depths from less than 1 meter to 3 meters. They are primarily nocturnal, remaining undercover until nightfall. Hellbenders are habitat specialists that are dependent on consistent levels of dissolved oxygen, temperature, and water flow.Williams, R. D., J. E. Gates, and C. H. Hocutt. 1981. An evaluation of known potential sampling techniques for hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis. Journal of Herpetology 15(1):23-27. Warmer stagnant waters with a low dissolved oxygen content do not meet the Ozark hellbenders respiratory needs. It has been observed that Ozark hellbenders in warm stagnant waters sway or rock in order to increase oxygen exposure. == Ecology and behavior == Ozark hellbenders are nocturnal predators, remaining beneath rock cover during the day and emerging to forage at night, primarily on crayfish.Dierenfeld, E. S., K. J. McGraw, K. Fritsche, J. T. Briggler, and J. Ettling. 2009. Nutrient composition of whole crayfish (Orconectes and Procambarus species) consumed by hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis). Herpetological Review 40(3):324-330. They become diurnal during the breeding season, searching for mates. They are highly sedentary, moving very little throughout their entire lifespan. Ozark hellbenders are territorial and will defend their cover from other hellbenders. They have been recorded living 25 to 30 years in the wild and grow slowly over time.Peterson, C.L., Ingersol, C.A., and R.F. Wilkinson. 1989. Winter breeding of Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi in Arkansas. Copeia 1989:1031-1035. Wild Ozark hellbender populations are dominated by these older and larger individuals. Female Ozark hellbenders have been found to mature at 6 to 8 years old, while males tend to mature at around 5 years of age.Taber, C.A., R.F. Wilkinson, Jr., and M.S. Topping. 1975. Age and growth of hellbenders in the Niangua River, Missouri. Copeia 1975:633−639. Some of the issues that Ozark hellbenders have in reproduction come from their late sexual maturity. Typically, Ozark hellbenders breed in mid-October, although certain populations that live in the Spring River area tend to procreate in the winter. Paternal care is present in this subspecies, even though it is rare to see this in tetrapods.Bishop, et al. “A Quantitative Field Study of Paternal Care in Ozark Hellbenders, North America's Giant Salamanders.” Journal of Ethology, Springer Japan, 1 Jan. 1970, link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-018-0553-0. The males are responsible for preparing the nests and ultimately guarding the eggs. They build nests under submerged logs, flat rocks, or within bedrocks. Hellbenders mate via external fertilization. Usually, around 138 to 450 eggs are present per nest, and they hatch after approximately 80 days.Bishop, S.C. 1941. Salamanders of New York. New York State Museum Bulletin 324:1−365. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae and juveniles hide under small and large rocks in gravel beds.LaClaire, L. V. 1993. Status review of Ozark hellbender (Cryptobranchus bishopi). U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service status review. Jackson, Mississippi. Ozark hellbenders are highly sedentary creatures, meaning that neither males nor females have long distance dispersal rates. == Conservation status == === The Endangered Species Act of 1973 === The Ozark hellbender became a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act in 2001. It was assigned a priority level of 6 for threats due to habitat loss and fragmentation because of human activity and pollution.Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Review of Plant and Animal Species That Are Candidates or Proposed for Listing as Endangered or Threatened, Annual Notice of Findings on Recycled Petitions, and Annual Description of Progress on Listing Actions, 66 Fed. Reg. 54811 (Oct. 30, 2001). In 2005 the Fish and Wildlife Service increased its listing priority number to a 3 because of increased pressures on the species from recreation activity in their habitat including gigging and boat traffic, and increases in the contamination of their waters.Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Review of Native Species That Are Candidates or Proposed for Listing as Endangered or Threatened; Annual Notice of Findings on Resubmitted Petitions; Annual Description of Progress on Listing Actions, 70 Fed. Reg. 24877 (May 11, 2005). The USFWS put forth the proposed rule to list the Ozark hellbender as endangered under the ESA in September 2010, and the listing of the species as endangered became effective November 7, 2011.Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Rule To List the Ozark Hellbender Salamander as Endangered, 75 Fed. Reg. 54561 (Sep. 8, 2010). In April 2017, a five-year review of the subspecies’ status was initiated.Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Initiation of 5-Year Status Reviews of Eight Endangered Animal Species, 82 Fed. Reg. 18156 (Apr. 17, 2017). === IUCN === The subspecies of C. a. bishopi does not currently have its own IUCN listing, but the species C. alleganiensis was listed as near threatened in April 2004. == Threats == === Human impact === The construction of reservoirs in the White River has destroyed Ozark hellbender habitat and separated their populations. These reservoirs also increase predation and the deposition of silt upstream from the reservoir, both of which threaten hellbenders. Siltation endangers the larval salamanders because it fills in the gravel stream beds where they live, reducing their ability to find food and hide from predators. Silt can also destroy their eggs. Agricultural and construction runoff, waste disposal, and mining activity within the hellbender’s range pollute and degrade their habitat and threaten hellbender survival. Mining is especially detrimental as it increases zinc and lead levels in hellbender habitat to dangerously high levels for aquatic life. Human and livestock waste from the areas surrounding hellbender habitat have further decreased water quality. Pollution is readily taken up by hellbenders due to the absorptive properties of their skin and decreases in water quality can make rivers and streams unlivable for this subspecies. Recreation in Ozark hellbender habitat also harms populations. Boat traffic, including canoes, kayaks, and motor boats may injure or kill hellbenders and further degrade their habitat. Additionally, direct removal from the environment has contributed to the decline of the Ozark hellbender. While Missouri and Arkansas have decreased or stopped issuing permits for scientific collection since the 1990s, illegal harvesting for the pet trade has continued. The Ozark hellbender also experiences predation from non-native rainbow and brown trout stocked in river for sport fishing. === Other threats === Like most amphibians globally, the Ozark hellbender is at risk of chytridiomycosis, a very infectious amphibian fungal disease. It has been detected in all but two rivers C. a. bishopi is currently found in. Additionally, unusual physical abnormalities have been observed in Ozark hellbenders in recent years, such as missing limbs or eyes and epidermal lesions, with increasing frequency, although the cause of these deformities is currently unknown. The small size of Ozark hellbender populations combined with their isolation from each other puts them at greater risk of extinction, as does the documented loss of genetic diversity within those populations. They also suffer from very low reproductive rates as a result of their late sexual maturity and long lifespans. Their late sexual maturity makes them more likely to die before reproducing and the time between generations is extended when reproduction does occur. Very low numbers of juvenile Ozark hellbenders in most populations confirm these problems. These threats are further worsened when combined with the other threats to this subspecies. == Conservation efforts == The decline of the Ozark hellbender was first recognized in the 1990s. Since then, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC) and Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) have begun to track the health and wellbeing of the creatures. They also study trends in their size and overall presence in their natural habitat. From this information, they are able to predict population trends. Since this species is now considered endangered, there is more effort to protect the habitat and populations of the Ozark hellbender. Both USFWS and State agencies have enacted laws and policies to aid in hellbender protection. The most popular conservation strategy for the Ozark hellbender is captive breeding and reintroduction back into their natural habitats. There is currently only one successful example of successful captive breeding, which is taking place in the Saint Louis Zoo. In regards to hellbender release after captive breeding, planning should include data on genetic information and the presence of chytrid fungus and other pathogens. Since there is little gene flow or genetic variation in the subspecies, it is hard to continue to build their numbers due to negative consequences from inbreeding. Some scientists suggest research into their genetic delineations for answers. Not much is known about their genetic history. Many scientists also suggest that translocation should not be a part of Ozark hellbender conservation plans, since they are habitat specialists and haven’t had translocation success in the past.Arntzen, et al. “Genetic Relationships of Hellbenders in the Ozark Highlands of Missouri and Conservation Implications for the Ozark Subspecies (Cryptobranchus Alleganiensis Bishopi).” Conservation Genetics, Springer Netherlands, 1 Jan. 1999. Other current conservation plans include population monitoring, protecting populations and habitat, and disease assessment and treatment Due to the impact of disease on the Ozark hellbender populations, there is more effort to study the physical deformities of the hellbenders affected by disease, as well as understanding how diseases cause the deformities. Research is also exploring the effects of the amphibian chytrid fungus. Heat treatment has seen some success as a method of treating chytrid cases. Other than captive release programs, the recommended way to meet the recovery needs of Ozark hellbenders is to protect and clean their habitat. It is necessary to decrease sedimentation and to protect areas where Ozark hellbenders reproduce. == References == == External links == * Ozark Hellbender Fact Sheet * St. Louis Zoo Ozark Hellbender Breeding Program Category:Cryptobranchidae ","title":"Ozark hellbender"},{"id":"63918203","text":"José Gabriel dos Santos Silva (born 21 January 1999), known as Zé Gabriel, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Internacional. ==Professional career== Zé Gabriel is a youth international of Corinthians, and moved to Internacional in 2019.

Belton specializes in the cuisine of New Orleans. He is the chef-host for Kevin Belton's New Orleans Celebrations and Kevin Belton’s New Orleans Kitchen on PBS and serves as the resident morning chef for WWL-TV. He also teaches cooking classes in New Orleans. Belton is also a former professional American football player. ==Early life, education and work== Belton was born in New Orleans, Louisiana around 1960. He is of African, Native American, French and English heritage. His mother was a school teacher whose family lived in Martinique. His father's family is from Bordeaux, France. Belton grew up in the Uptown neighborhood. He attended Our Lady of Lourdes Elementary, Brother Martin High School, and Louisiana State University. He played college football at Louisiana State University and Xavier before injuries ended his career at San Diego Chargers training camp. Belton's first experiences cooking was when he was a child, around age six, helping his mother and grandmother in the kitchen. The first thing he learned to cook was scrambled eggs. It is from his mother and grandmother that he learned how to cook cajun and Creole. Using his background he became a self- taught chef. ==Career== Belton started managing the store at the New Orleans School of Cooking. Eventually, he started teaching classes. He has taught at the school for over 20 years. Prior to becoming a television chef, Belton regularly watched cooking television shows, including shows by Julia Child, Paul Prudhomme and Justin Wilson. In 1992, he participated in the local PBS affiliates pledge drive, reading listings from an auction board live on air. He started hosting pledge breaks, eventually hosting a Saturday morning cooking show. In 2016, Belton's show New Orleans Cooking with Kevin Belton launched on WYES-TV. Belton's second national television program, Kevin Belton’s New Orleans Kitchen, launched in 2018. The PBS series showcases recipes including those created by his mother and grandmother, local traditional dishes, and dishes that represent the melting pot culture of the New Orleans area, including those that meld Greek, South American and Vietnamese. In 2019, Belton was awarded the \\"Best Social Media\\" award by the Louisiana Association of Broadcasters. The Association also awarded his PBS show Kevin Belton’s New Orleans Kitchen the \\"Uniquely Louisiana Award\\". In April of 2019, his show Kevin Belton's New Orleans Celebrations debuted on PBS and an accompanying cookbook was published. Belton currently serves as the Morning News Chef for WWL-TV, also presenting television features for the station about local food culture. ===Style=== Belton specializes in the cuisine of New Orleans. His recipes are intentionally simple, with the goal of making cooking non-intimidating for people interested in learning how to prepare New Orleans-style dishes. He does not use a food stylist for his cookbooks or television show, presenting each dish as it would be if the average home cook would prepare it. ==Personal life== Belton lives in New Orleans and is married to Monica Belton. He rarely cooks at home. Some of his favorite places for take out in New Orleans are Royal China, Venezia and Central Grocery. He is an avid reader, especially mystery novels. ==Works by Kevin Belton== *with Rhonda Findley. Kevin Belton’s Big Flavors of New Orleans. Layton: Gibbs Smith (2016). *with Rhonda Findley.

It is an indicator of the effectiveness of brand use in terms of generating net income. In fact, it is a special case of return on assets (ROA). ROB is calculated as the ratio of net income to brand value: : \\\\mathrm{ROB} = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{Net Income}}{\\\\mbox{Brand Value}} == Usage == Return on brand can be used in multi-criteria models for assessing the effectiveness of branding, as well as intellectual capital (since the brand is a component of relational capital). It is believed that if the brand value of the company increases, its net profit should also increase, otherwise the value of ROB will decrease, which indicates a decrease in the effectiveness of brand management in terms of creating net profit. At the same time, if the brand value falls, and this does not lead to a decrease in the net profit of the enterprise, the ROB value increases, which indicates a relative increase in the brand management efficiency. The change in brand value itself, although it makes it possible to judge the effectiveness of brand management, is only indirectly, since the company does not sell the brand directly, because it is an intangible asset associated directly with company and its products. If a company sells its brand as an intangible asset to another organization, it terminates branding events with respect to it, since this function transfers to the new owner of the brand. Thus, ROB allows to clarify how effective it is for a company to change the value of the brand associated with it. For this reason, the diagnosis of the impact of brand value on a business is relevant only with a joint analysis of ROB. == Application examples == Return on brand can be applied in several branding assessment models: The approach of T. Munoz and S. Kumar, who propose to build a branding assessment system based on three classes of metrics (perception metrics, behavioral metrics, financial metrics), which make it possible to evaluate branding effectiveness. A model for assessing the effectiveness of branding based on the concept of contact branding, which is based on the fact that by isolating and controlling points of contact between the brand and the consumer, it is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of brand management.Davis, Scott M., Dunn Michael, Building the brand-driven business: Operationalize your brand to drive profitable growth, San Francisco, Jossey-Bass, 2002 == See also == * Return on capital (ROC) * Return on equity (ROE) * Return on investment (ROI) * Rate of return on a portfolio * List of business and finance abbreviations == References == Category:Financial ratios ","title":"Return on brand"},{"id":"63918528","text":"The Mitre is a mountain summit located in the western Chugach Mountains, in Anchorage Municipality in the U.S. state of Alaska. The mountain is situated in Chugach State Park, east of Anchorage, northeast of Peril Peak, and south- southeast of Eklutna Lake. The nearest higher peak is Benign Peak, to the west-northwest, on the opposite side of the Eklutna Glacier. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant since the western aspect of the mountain rises 4,000 feet above this glacier in approximately half a mile. In Europe, \\"mitre\\" is the term used for a sharp, symmetrical rocky peak such as this one. The Mitre's descriptive name was submitted for consideration by the Mountaineering Club of Alaska as suggested by Dr. Rodman Wilson (1921–2003) of Anchorage after he returned from a European vacation.Donald J. Orth, Dictionary of Alaska Place Names, 1967, page 649. The Mitre name was officially adopted in 1966 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.

She is a Professor of Philosophy at Scripps College. She specializes in bioethics, the ethics of procreation, and the metaphysics of birth, death, and existence. ==Career== Weinberg attended Brooklyn College, where she earned a BA degree. She then graduated with a PhD from the University of Michigan. In 2016, Weinberg published the book The risk of a lifetime: how, when, and why procreation may be permissible. In The risk of a lifetime, Weinberg studies the ethics of human procreation, focusing not on common ethical topics in procreation such as abortion rights but rather on the problem of when it can be justified to create a human being. The book is therefore motivated by the question of how to judge the value of being a person against the value of never existing at all. Weinberg takes as a starting point a perspective that has been called pessimistic: the notion that life is inherently bad, with many attendant risks, and that the decision to procreate must be weighed against these risks. Building on a Rawlsian theory of justice and responding to the nonidentity problem of philosophers like Derek Parfit, Weinberg argues that procreation can only be justified under two conditions: a person who chooses to procreate must have the intention to nurture and care for their child once it is born, and they must believe that the risk they impose on their future child by creating it would be rational for them to accept as a pre-condition of their own birth in exchange for the opportunity to then procreate. This latter constraint is drawn from the contractualism of John Rawls and the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Weinberg makes an analogy between these requirements and the risk-management requirements that are placed on people who handle hazardous materials like uranium; in the case of procreation ethics, the hazardous materials that can plausibly bring harm to others are human gametes. Several implications of the theory of procreation ethics that Weinberg developed in The risk of a lifetime have been explored in journal articles or the popular media. For example, since Weinberg's theory of procreation ethics explicitly weighs the risks that are imposed on children by creating them, it implies that people who are in a situation that would likely expose their offspring to greater risks therefore are less likely to have a rational case for procreation; this includes people with heritable diseases and those living in severe poverty. It also suggests that the risks imposed by global warming should have some bearing on peoples' procreation decisions. Another implication of Weinberg's theory that she notes in The risk of a lifetime is that sperm donors and egg donors have responsibility as parents for the children that their gametes are used to create; she has further explored this implication in academic journals. Weinberg has also written news media articles about the culpability that individuals have in morally compromising situations, including individual complicity in evil deeds that are encouraged by powerful people; her writing on this topic was subsequently discussed in The Washington Post, Fast Company, and Business Insider. ==References== Category:Living people Category:American philosophers Category:American ethicists Category:American women philosophers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:Brooklyn College alumni Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Rivka Weinberg"},{"id":"63918624","text":"The 1968 South Dakota gubernatorial election was held on November 5, 1968.

While finding the symbolism lacking in subtlety, the critic argued that the \\"vision is unsparing, but it is filled with psychological insights and theatrical poetry [...] Mr. Fugard has brought the characters to vivid dramatic life\\". Sid Smith of Chicago Tribune wrote a negative review after a 1986 performance, writing that the play is \\"fraught with structural problems and belabored symbols and imagery\\". Smith described Fugard's script as \\"so translucent it\`s almost invisible, more a road map than a drama of flesh and blood.\\" Alvin Klein of The New York Times praised the play in 1994, writing that the work \\"holds the stage stirringly\\". Klein argued, \\"Just when Hello and Goodbye threatens to plunge an audience into terminal despair, Mr. Fugard's words pull it into reverse, casting forth images in lyric flight.\\" Brian Coates wrote in The Irish Times that the playwright \\"skilfully raises the dramatic tension by paralleling the machinery of the plot with Hester's sad, self-conscious frustration.

In November 2019, a reviewer for The Stage argued, \\"There is something undeniably timely about Hester’s story of hopes dashed by exploitative men “in a hundred Johannesburg rooms”. But at times the characters’ concerns with retribution and resurrection feel grounded in the religious sensibilities of a bygone era.\\" Catherine Love gave the 2019 York Theatre Royal performance four out of five stars in The Guardian, writing, \\"What looks like a slight domestic drama digs, gradually, into dark and profound territory.\\" Comparing it to the works of Samuel Beckett in its existential despair, the critic stated that the struggle of Hester and Johnnie \\"is played out with intense, devastating brilliance.

This line provides service within the neighborhoods of Vienna, Merrifield and Ballston in Fairfax and Arlington counties. Alongside the neighborhoods, it also brings service through the marketplace, business, and offices within the counties. ==Route Description and Service== The 1A and 1B operate from two divisions; West Ox division on the weekdays, and Four Mile Run on the weekends. Route 1A operates daily between Vienna and Ballston stations via Arlington Boulevard and Wilson Boulevard. The 1A runs through the neighborhoods in Fairfax County, such as Oakton, Woodburn, West Falls Church, and Seven Corners within Arlington Boulevard. The 1A also runs through the neighborhoods in Arlington County, such as Boulevard Manor and Bluemont. Route 1B operates during weekday peak hours between Dunn Loring and Ballston stations. The 1B joins the route on Arlington Boulevard through the intersection of Fairview Park Drive. Unlike route 1A, the 1B skips Seven Corners Transit Station on all trips. ==History== The Wilson Boulevard–Vienna Line was introduced in 1920, as the route was part of the Washington Virginia & Maryland Coach Company. It is one of the three oldest routes in Virginia, alongside the Columbia Pike Line from the Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company (AB&W;), which opened a year later in 1921. It was later operated by WMATA in 1973, when it acquired all routes from the AB&W; and the WV&M.; Since 1973, the Wilson Boulevard–Vienna Line consists of all 1 line. The 1 line provides reliable service within Fairfax and Arlington counties to connect from neighborhoods, to marketplaces, to landmarks, and to business. Although, the Wilson Boulevard–Vienna Line has various names prior to the current name throughout the years. ===Wilson Boulevard Line=== The initial name of the Wilson Boulevard–Vienna Line was the Wilson Boulevard Line, which was the original name since the beginning of service. The Wilson Boulevard Line consists of routes 1A, 1B, 1E, 1F, 1M, 1V, 1W, and 1X. All 8 routes of the 1 line operated on various schedules, and on different roads. ===1983 split=== In 1983, the Wilson Boulevard Line splits into two route segments, the Wilson Boulevard–Annandale Line and the Wilson Boulevard–Fairfax Line. Routes 1A, 1B, 1E, 1M, 1V, and 1W operated under the Wilson Boulevard–Annandale Line, with the addition of Route 1D. Routes 1F and 1X operated under the Wilson Boulevard–Fairfax Line, with the addition of Routes 1C and 1Z. At some point in the 1980s and the 1990s, the Wilson Boulevard–Annandale Line, was discontinued, eliminating routes 1A, 1M, 1V, and 1W. This results the remaining routes of the lines, the 1A, 1B, and 1E to be merged to the Wilson Boulevard–Fairfax Line. On the other hand, the 1X was also discontinued alongside with routes 1A, 1M, 1V, and 1W. ===Wilson Boulevard–Fairfax Line=== Since the early 1990s, the Wilson Boulevard–Fairfax Line follows the same routes as the previous lines, with no changes on its route segments. Routes 1D, 1E and 1Z operates during weekday peak hours, while route 1B operates from Monday to Saturday, and routes 1C operates daily. Route 1F operates during weeknights, early morning and on Sundays. The 1B and 1D runs between Dunn Loring and Ballston stations. Although the 1D runs via the neighborhood of Dominion Hills. Route 1E runs during peak hours between Seven Corners Transit station and Ballston station, following the same path as the 1D. The 1F runs the same intervals as the 1E, although the 1F does not serve the neighborhood of Dominion Hills. Select 1F trips operates through Fairfax Circle. The 1C and 1Z runs between Inova Fair Oaks Hospital and Ballston station. The 1Z runs during weekday peak hours, with nonstop service between Bluemont Park and Ballston station with passenger boarding and alighting restrictions. All routes remains unchanged until June 24, 2007, when the line discontinues one route, the 1D. Alongside with these changes, the Wilson Boulevard–Fairfax Line once again splits into two lines, with route 1C, to form the new Dunn Loring–Fair Oaks Line, and routes 1B, 1C, 1E, 1F, and 1Z transferred to the Wilson Boulevard Line. The eastern half of route 1C was taken over by the 1A following these changes. ===Reincarnation of the Wilson Boulevard Line=== The Wilson Boulevard Line returned in service on June 24, 2007, as major changes was made to the line. Route 1A was brought back in service, taking over the eastern portion of the 1C. The new Wilson Boulevard Line modified its schedules for the 1B, which formerly operated from Monday to Saturday, now operates during weekday peak hours only. Route 1F remains unchanged from its route, although it will no longer operate to Fairfax Circle. Route 1F continues to operate during weeknights and on Sundays, until the route was eliminated on December 29, 2013. On the same day, the line was renamed to Wilson Boulevard–Vienna Line. Routes 1E and 1Z remains in service until 2016, when both routes was discontinued, leaving with the 1A and 1B left on the line. ===June 2007 Changes=== On June 24, 2007, route 1D was discontinued to clear up bus bunching in the Wilson Boulevard Line. Route 1E continues to provide service to Dominion Hills, and route 1B to Dunn Loring station. Route 1C was transferred to the Dunn Loring–Fair Oaks Line. Route 1A replaced the eastern portion of the 1C following these changes. Route 1Z was truncated to Vienna station, but continues to run non-stop between Bluemont and Ballston station. Route 1F no longer operate late night trips to Fairfax Circle. ===2010 Proposed Changes=== In 2010 during WMATA's FY2011 budget, WMATA proposed to discontinue the 1E service on Dominion Hills and convert all 1E trips to 1F trips. The merger of the 1E and 1F was to clear bus bunching in Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, as there are low ridership in Dominion Hills. Route 1F would be retained and operate on full weekday peak hours and late night service following the elimination of the 1E. However, the 1F will continue to provide local service on Wilson Boulevard during peak hours. ===January 2012 Changes=== The new Seven Corners Transit Center opened on January 22, 2012 next to Seven Corners Shopping Center. The 1A, 1B, 1E, and 1F was rerouted to serve the new transit center to connect with other routes. The schedules of these trips remains unchanged, however, the 1A and the 1F will no longer alternate terminals at Leesburg Pike. ===2013 Proposed Changes=== In 2013 during WMATA's FY2014 budget, WMATA proposed to extend late night trips (1F) from Seven Corners Transit Center to Vienna station. However, the budget also proposed to convert all 1F trips to 1A trips. The merger of the 1A and 1F was to clear up bus bunching, as the 1F late night trip was a redundancy to the 1A trip between Seven Corners Transit Center and Ballston–MU station. The reason why WMATA planned these changes, was to improve late evening and Sunday service to the residential areas along the Arlington Boulevard corridor west of Seven Corners, as the 1F did not operate between Seven Corners and Vienna station. It was also to bring in transportation service to Inova Fairfax Hospital during late night hours and on Sundays. ===December 2013 changes=== On December 29, 2013, Route 1F was discontinued to clear up bus bunching and low ridership. Alternate service is provided by route 1A. ===2016 changes=== Major changes occurred in the Wilson Boulevard–Vienna Line in 2016. On June 26, 2016, Route 1Z was discontinued to clear up bus bunching, as the 1A follows the same path as the 1Z. This was to improve ridership on the Wilson Boulevard–Vienna Line, instead of having the 1Z dedicated for rush hours, while the 1A also operate during rush hours. The 1B will no longer serve Seven Corners Transit Center following these changes. On August 21, 2016, Route 1E was discontinued and is replaced by Arlington Transit route 54. ART 54 provides service via Washington Boulevard, where it connects to route 2A of the Washington Blvd.–Dunn Loring Line. === September 2020 proposed changes === On September 10, 2020 as part of its FY2022 proposed budget, WMATA proposed to eliminate route 1B service in order to reduce costs and low federal funds. Route 1B has not operated since March 17, 2020 due to Metro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==References== 1A ","title":"Wilson Boulevard–Vienna Line"},{"id":"63918880","text":"The Washington Blvd.–Dunn Loring Line, designated as Route 2A, is a daily bus route operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority between Dunn Loring station of the Orange Line of the Washington Metro and Ballston–MU station of the Orange and Silver lines of the Washington Metro.

The western segment of the line was introduced in 1937 by the Arlington & Fairfax Motor Transportation Company, known as the Lee Highway Line. The western segment of the line was later acquired by the Washington Virginia & Maryland Coach Company in 1947, merging the two segments into a single line to be part of the Washington Boulevard Line. It was later operated by WMATA in 1973, when it acquired all routes from the WV&M.; Since 1973, the Washington Blvd.–Dunn Loring Line consists of all 2 line. The 2 line provides reliable service within Fairfax county, the City of Falls Church, and Arlington county to connect from neighborhoods, to marketplaces, to landmarks, and to business.

The Washington Boulevard Line consists of routes 2A, 2C, 2M, and 2W. All 4 routes of the 2 line operated on various schedules, and on different roads. At some point in the 1980s, 2A used to operate between Ballston station and Tysons Corner Shopping Center, until it was replaced by route 2C north of Dunn Loring station. Alongside with these changes, route 2G was introduced, the 2M was discontinued, and the 2W was transferred to the Vienna–Oakton Line. The entire 2 line serves in Ballston station, as it splits into different segments at the neighborhood of Merrifield. Route 2A operates between Ballston and Dunn Loring stations during early morning and late night. Routes 2B and 2G operates the same interval as the 2A, with the extension towards Fair Oaks in Fairfax County. The 2B operates from Monday to Saturday through Fair Oaks Mall, and the 2G operates on weekday peak hour schedules via Flint Hill Office Park and the Gateway Center in Fair Oaks. Route 2C operates in a similar interval as the 2A, by extending the line to Tysons Corner Center. The 2C operates everyday, unlike the other routes in the line. These routes remains the same until December 29, 2013, when the entire 2 line was split to form three new lines. Route 2A became the sole route that operates the original interval, and was renamed the Washington Blvd.–Dunn Loring Line, while the 2B was truncated and transferred to the Fair Oaks–Jermantown Road Line, and the 2C was replaced by the 2T under the Tysons Corner–Dunn Loring Line. ===June 2008 changes=== On June 29, 2008, route 2G no longer operates via the Gateway Center. The 2G continues to operate via Flint Hill Office Park to Fair Oaks Mall. ===2013 Proposed Changes=== In 2013, WMATA proposed to modify the Washington Boulevard Line. It was proposed that the 2G to be converted into 2B trips, and the 2B to form a new line as the Fair Oaks–Jermantown Road Line.

Sturdivant died in Pasadena on April 21, 1972, at the age of 66, survived by his wife Arletta. ==Work== He was instructor in Mathematics at the University of Texas from 1926 to 1927. At Caltech, he held position of Teaching Fellow (1927-1930), Research Fellow (1930-1935), Senior Fellow in Research (1935-1938), and Assistant Professor (since 1938). As a professor, he taught X-ray crystallography. One of the first results of the collaboration with Pauling, soon after is hiring in 1927, was the elucidation of the structure of the titanium mineral brookite, that led Pauling to develop his theory of coordination bonding. Another important result of their collaboration was the partial elucidation of the molecular structure of certain compounds discovered by Liebig in the 1830s, including melon, melem, cyameluric acid, and hydromelonic acid. They realized that those compounds had a common core with formula , consisting of three fused triazine rings, now known as the heptazine core. Among many other projects, Sturdivant helped Pauling to develop a device to measure the concentration of oxygen in gases. The patent for the device was assigned to the two and to Reuben Wood, and was donated to the on condition that the authors receive a fraction of any revenue coming from it.

It analyzes the mathematics behind geometric designs and patterns from multiple African cultures, and suggests ways of connecting this analysis with the mathematics curriculum. It was published in 1999 by the Mathematical Association of America, in their Classroom Resource Materials book series. ==Background== The book's author, , (1952–2014) was a mathematician from the Netherlands who became a professor of mathematics at the Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique, rector of Maputo University, and chair of the African Mathematical Union Commission on the History of Mathematics in Africa. He was a prolific author, especially of works on the ethnomathematics of Africa. However, as many of his publications were written in Portuguese, German, and French, or published only in Mozambique, this book makes his work in ethnomathematics more accessible to English-speaking mathematicians. ==Topics== The book is heavily illustrated, and describes geometric patterns in the carvings, textiles, drawings and paintings of multiple African cultures. Although these are primarily decorative rather than mathematical, Gerdes adds his own mathematical analysis of the patterns, and suggests ways of incorporating this analysis into the mathematical curriculum. It is divided into four chapters. The first of these provides an overview of geometric patterns in many African cultures, including examples of textiles, knotwork, architecture, basketry, metalwork, ceramics, petroglyphs, facial tattoos, body painting, and hair styles. The second chapter presents examples of designs in which squares and right triangles can be formed from elements of the patterns, and suggests educational activities connecting these materials to the Pythagorean theorem and to the theory of Latin squares. For instance, basket-weavers in Mozambique form square knotted buttons out of folded ribbons, and the resulting pattern of oblique lines crossing the square suggests a standard dissection-based proof of the theorem. The third chapter uses African designs, particularly in basket-weaving, to illustrate themes of symmetry, polygons and polyhedra, area, volume, and the theory of fullerenes. In the final chapter, the only one to concentrate on a single African culture, the book discusses the sona sand-drawings of the Chokwe people, in which a single self-crossing curve surrounds and separates a grid of points. These drawings connect to the theory of Euler tours, fractals, arithmetic series, and polyominos. ==Audience and reception== The book is aimed at primary and secondary school mathematics teachers. Reviewer Karen Dee Michalowicz, a school teacher, writes that although the connections between culture and mathematics are sometimes contrived, \\"every mathematics educator would benefit\\" from the book. Ethnomathematician Marcia Ascher suggests that the book would have benefited from an index and a map of the cultures from which the material of the book was drawn. Nevertheless, reviewer Richard Kitchen evaluates this book as \\"the most complete volume available on the ethnomathematics of Africa\\". Reviewer Steve Abbott writes that the book \\"provides many opportunities for developing cross-curricular and multi- cultural approaches\\" to mathematics education, and that it is \\"an important book that deserves to be widely read\\". ==References== ==External links== *Geometry From Africa on the Internet Archive Category:Mathematics and culture Category:Mathematics books Category:1999 non-fiction books ","title":"Geometry From Africa"},{"id":"63919102","text":"BV Den Helder, for sponsorships reasons Dozy BV, is a Dutch women's basketball club based in Den Helder.

In August 1919, Uruguay recognized Finland's independence and in March 1935 both nations established diplomatic relations.Relaciones Bilaterales Finlandia-Uruguay (in Spanish) Unlike Argentina or Brazil, very few Finns immigrated to Uruguay. During World War II, Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union which triggered the Winter War. Uruguay supported Finland diplomatically during the war and as gesture, Uruguay donated 100,000 pesos and 10,563 cans of 350 grams of corned beef to the Finnish people.Una historia olvidada: cuando Uruguay ayudó a Finlandia (in Spanish) Since the end of the war, relations between Finland and Uruguay have remained close. In 2007, UPM, a Finnish pulp company, opened a mill in Fray Bentos, Uruguay just across the river from Argentina. During the construction of the mill, Argentina filed a complaint against the company and the Uruguayan government stating possible pollution of the river by the mill. The Uruguay River is shared by the two countries and is protected by a treaty, which requires both parties to inform the other of any project that might affect the river. Besides the issue of pollution, Argentina claimed that the Uruguayan government had not asked for permission to build the mill. This diplomatic incident became known as the Uruguay River pulp mill dispute. The dispute was brought before the International Court of Justice which said that Uruguay had breached its procedural obligations to inform Argentina of its plans but had not violated its environmental obligations under the treaty and therefore the Finnish mill could continue operations.Argentina and Uruguay settle seven-year pulp mill row In 2013, Uruguay opened an embassy in Helsinki.

He served as president of the Western Union Telegraph Company from 1878 until his death in 1893. He was a founding member and the first president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), which later became part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). == Early life == Green was born in New Albany, Indiana on April 17, 1818, the son of Virginians Joseph Strother Green and Susan Ball. The family moved to Breckenridge County, Kentucky when he was a child. As a young man he operated a flatboat grocery on the Ohio River, then ran a business that cut and sold cord wood to steamboat operators. He was able to earn enough money from these ventures to finance his medical education at the University of Louisville, where he earned his degree in 1840. That same year he married Martha English of Carrollton, Kentucky. They had five children together. == Career in Kentucky == Following his graduation, Dr. Green practiced medicine in Louisville and Carrollton, Kentucky. He served as a doctor at the Western Military Institute, where he became friends with future presidential candidate James Blaine, who was an instructor there. In 1850 Green was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, where he served until 1853 (and again in 1867). He was appointed to supervise the construction of a federal customs house and post office in Louisville in 1853. At that time he became interested in telegraphy, and invested in telegraph lines that connected Louisville and New Orleans. He formed, and became president of, the Southwestern Telegraph Company. == Career in New York == Green moved to New York City in 1857. There he worked on the consolidation of many telegraph companies, culminating with the formation of Western Union in 1866, where he was named vice president. He stayed at Western Union for the rest of his life, except for three years when he returned to politics in Kentucky, being nominated to run for U.S. Senator. Upon the death of Western Union president William Orton in 1878, Green was named president of that company. He, along with others including Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell, formed the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884; he was its first president. == Death == Norvin Green died on February 13, 1893 at his home in Louisville, Kentucky. He had been in ill health, and died from complications of intestinal disease. He was buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville. His grandson, Norvin Hewitt Green, donated the land that became Norvin Green State Forest in New Jersey. == References == == External links == * Category:1818 births Category:1893 deaths Category:19th-century businesspeople Category:Burials at Cave Hill Cemetery Category:Members of the Kentucky House of Representatives Category:People from New Albany, Indiana Category:University of Louisville School of Medicine alumni Category:Western Union people ","title":"Norvin Green"},{"id":"63919419","text":"Margaret M.

As an insurgent, he is known mainly to historians, while with the interesting data he provided to historiography, he became known to a wider readership.Милан Ђ. Милићевић (1876): Кнежевина Србија. Државна штампарија, Београд It was historian Milan Milićević who recorded Petar Jokić's experiences during the First Serbian Uprising on behalf of the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences before he died. According to the decision of the censor, his testimony could not appear in print during the reign of Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević, but much later, only in 1891. There were two other revolutionaries, Janićije Đurić and Anta Protić, who also wrote their eyewitness accounts about the war of independence. ==Biography== Petar Jokić was born in Topola around 1779, and at the time of the uprising, in 1804, he was a young man in full strength. Until then, well known to Karađorđe, Jokić was his right hand in the first days of the preparation for the uprising. Jokić is one of those who threw the first spark in the Turkish hans (inns) and started the battle. From that time until the whole series of events, Jokić was always in the physical and immediate vicinity of Karađorđe, becoming an officer, a Boluk-bashi, the personal leader of Karađorđe's personal Guard. Thus, Jokić had the opportunity to see, hear, learn and do a lot. He survived many difficult situations on the battlefields and overcame many wounds. Heroic, reliable, wise and prudent, Jokić had a serious word in the greatest company of the first dukes (voivodes). The circumstances were often such that the Vožd (Grand Leader Karađorđe) had to be left without his escort detachment at critical moments because it was dispatched where it was most needed at the time. Jokić often only received orders to move, without notice nor explanation. In 1813, he was on the Drina and in Šabac, from where he was preparing for the capture of Belgrade with Miloš Obrenović, but he received news that Belgrade had already been taken by the Ottoman Turks and that Vožd Karađorđe had already crossed the Sava. After the collapse of the uprising, in 1813, he lived with his family until 1838 in Zemun, then under the rule of the Austrian Empire, where he opened his trading company. After the liberation of Serbia, Jokić returned to his homeland and became a member of the Valjevo District Court, where he also retired when he went to Topola, the place of his birth. He lived there until his death in 1852.Андра Гавриловић (2008): Знаменити Срби XIX века. Друго допуњено издање.

The Plan superseded the 1955 Plan for the Metropolitan Region and established the principles on which the Metropolitan Regional Planning Authority would consider amendments to the Metropolitan Region Scheme. A review of the plan was completed in 1987, followed by the preparation and adoption of the 1990 Metroplan. == Background == In 1966 the MRPA commenced a review of the Region Scheme with the intent of determining whether the future expansion of Perth should occur via \\"clusters\\" or \\"corridors\\". Theoretical debate over the merits of these two theories occurred throughout the late 1960s, and similar plans had been prepared for Sydney and The MRPA eventually settled on the application of corridor planning principles as the right approach for Perth in February 1969, and commenced detailed planning of the Armadale corridor before moving on to complete a plan for the whole of the metropolitan area by November 1970. The intent of the Plan was to accommodate future development of the metropolitan region whilst maximising economic efficiency. In this, it complimented the Perth Regional Transportsation Study published in January 1970 which concluded that \\"corridor planning provides the most economic transport system for the Region\\". == Structure == # Introduction to the Corridor Plan # The Structure of the Corridor Plan # The Corridor Plan: Development Strategy # The Corridor Plan: Development Proposals # Implementation of the Corridor Plan # Conclusion : Appendix: Capital Cities: A Comparison of Corridor Plans == Recommendations == The Plan included a number of key predictions and recommendations as follows: * Large areas of open space to be located between the corridors. * The development of the sub-regional centres of Armadale, Joondalup, Whitfords, Rockingham and Midland. * A comprehensive, high-speed bus service to provide public transport to the region. This was to include bus lanes in existing railway reserves converging on the CBD. * Suburban train facilities to be progressively suspended between Perth and MIdland, Armadale and Fremantle. *That water resources and their management be recognised as major determinant in the sustainable development of the metropolitan region. == Reception and criticism == Academic Dave Hedgecock describes the 1960s as a time when academic and professional consensus around metropolitan planning began to collapse. The Corridor Plan represented a paradigm shift away from “planning by design” to “planning by science”Diane MacCallum, Diane Hopkins, The changing discourse of city plans: rationalities of planning in Perth, 1955 - 2010 (2010) Curtin University of Technology. and never achieved the level of support enjoyed by the earlier Stephenson-Hepburn plan. It remained controversial through its preparation and period of operation. Almost immediately following the release of the plan, the state government appointed Paul Ritter to provide comment on the plan. He was critical, and proposed an alternative directional grid pattern of development that focussed growth around the existing city centre. Simultaneously, an Honorary Royal Commission into the plan was initiated by the Legislative Council in 1971. The purpose of the commission was to enquire into and report on the preparation of the Corridor Plan. The Commission completed its investigation in 1972. The commission concluded that the corridor planning concept was sound in principle, but identified a number of deficiencies in the report presentation and proposed implementation. The findings of the commission did not lead to a formal review of the plan, and the MRPA published its own report defending the Plan against criticism. Passenger services on the Fremantle line were suspended on 1 September 1979, in line with the recommendations of the Plan. The closure led to a public backlash and the service was reinstated on 29 July 1983 following a change of government. A review of the Plan commenced in 1985 due to deficiencies in the population projections which had anticipated a metropolitan population of 1.4 million by 1989--approximately 250,000 short of the actual numbers. The Plan also incorrectly identified sub-regional centres as the primary source of non-CBD based employment growth, when in reality most employment growth occurred in the inner City suburbs around the central area. == References == Category:Perth, Western Australia Category:Urban planning in Australia ","title":"Corridor Plan for Perth"},{"id":"63919572","text":"Kirsty Feasey (born 7 February 1993) is an English-born Maltese former footballer who played as a defender.

Domingos António de Sousa Coutinho, 1st Marquis of Funchal (20 February 1762 – 1 December 1833) was a Portuguese diplomat and author of several works on politics and diplomacy. He read Law in the University of Coimbra shortly after the Pombaline Reform, where he earned his degree in 1781. At first his family considered an ecclesiastical career for him, but he instead joined the diplomatic service, filling the posts of envoy in Denmark (1790-1795), Portuguese representative in Turin (1796-1803), ambassador in London (1803-1814) and in Rome (1814-1828). His period as ambassador to the Court of St James's coincided with the height of international conflict during the Napoleonic Wars. He was intensely involved in secret diplomatic negotiations at this time as Portugal openly sided with Britain and refused to join the Continental System; Sousa Coutinho was instrumental in arranging the details of the transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil with British Foreign Secretary George Canning, thus guaranteeing British military protection to the Royal Family. D. Domingos de Sousa Coutinho was born in 1762 to diplomat and colonial administrator D.

He was baptised on 27 February 1762; his godparents were the Count of Oeiras (who would later become more commonly known by the title of Marquis of Pombal) and Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, both represented by proxy.

It flows in the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, in the regional county municipality (MRC) Le Haut-Richelieu Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Montérégie, in the south of province of Quebec, in Canada. The river surface is generally frozen from mid-December to the end of March. Safe traffic on the ice is generally from late December to early March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation. == Geography == The main hydrographic slopes neighboring the \\"Bernier river\\" are: * north side: Rivière des Iroquois (Richelieu River); * east side: Richelieu River; * south side: Milieu and Trait Carré stream, Rouillé stream * west side: Acadia River. The Bernier River takes its source at the Grande Ligne road, northwest of Saint- Blaise-sur-Richelieu and southwest of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. The Bernier River flows over 12.9 km first northwards over 4.3 km in agricultural area; 1.4 km east; 3.1 km north-east; and 4.1 km east, crossing the golf course, then the town of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu meandering, to its mouth.Atlas of Canada from the Department of Natural Resources Canada - Characteristics extracted from the geographic map, the database and site instrumentation - accessed on = May 10, 2020. The mouth of the Bernier River is located on the east bank of the Richelieu River, three km upstream from the Gouin bridge, 5.5 km upstream from the Félix-Gabriel-Marchand bridge, at 8.9 km upstream of the Iroquois River, 1.1 km downstream from Barbotte stream (coming from the east) and 4.8 km downstream from the stream Samoisette (coming from the west). == Toponymy == Under the French Regime (completed in 1760), this river was designated \\"Rivière du Nord\\" because of its situation opposite to the \\"Rivière du Sud\\", the mouth of which flows 15.5 km upstream on the east bank. of the Richelieu River. During the American Revolutionary War, the river was renamed \\"Montgomery's Creek\\" or \\"Ruisseau Montgomery\\". This term evokes a landing of the troops of the American general Richard Montgomery (1738-1775) carried out in the autumn of 1775 in order to attack Fort Saint-Jean. After a long 45-day siege in front of the fort, Montgomery and his men took Montreal. The general died during the assault on Quebec City on December 31, 1775. Subsequently, the river is designated \\"Golf Creek\\" because it crosses in its lower part, a golf course. At the beginning of the 1960s, its toponym became \\"Bernier river\\", after Grand-Bernier and Petit-Bernier, the traditional names for the cadastral rows where the watercourse takes its source. These ranks would themselves be named in honor of Joseph-Pierre Bernier who helped the exiled Acadians so that they could settle in these ranks.Source: \\"Itinerary of the Vallée-du-Richelieu \\", 1984; Giroux, Émile.

Neufeld has been criticized for making bigoted and discriminatory remarks towards the LGBTQ+ community, and in May 2020, he was accused of disparaging the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada Dr. Theresa Tam, a story that made international headlines. Neufeld first made headlines in 2017 for comparing gender transitioning to child abuse. His comments attracted widespread media attention, a court filing by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, and a vocal exchange with political and human rights defender Morgane Oger. The superintendent of School District 33 Chilliwack, Evelyn Novak, responded saying Neufeld did not speak for the Board on that issue. The Chilliwack School Teachers Association passed a vote of non- confidence in 2017. The Chilliwack Board of Education passed a motion asking Neufeld to resign and the Ministry of Education issued a statement. In 2019, Neufeld's defamation lawsuit against British Columbia Teachers' Federation (BCTF) president Glen Hansman was dismissed in British Columbia’s first use of 'anti-SLAPP' (Strategic lawsuit against public participation) legislation.

It was released in October 1985 on Dot and MCA Records in October 1985. The project was produced by Billy Strange. The studio album marked Pruett's first full-length studio release in six years. It contained ten tracks, most of which were songs she had not yet recorded. ==Background, content and release== In 1985, MCA Records relaunched the dormant Dot label. As part of the company's promotion, several veteran country artists recorded new studio albums to market towards the genre's older demographic. Among the other artists chosen for the project were Asleep at the Wheel, Jan Howard, Justin Tubb, Carl Perkins and Billie Jo Spears. In the album's liner notes, Pruett commented that she was excited to be given the opportunity. She was also excited about the new musical sound crafted by her producer, Billy Strange. Pruett and Strange recorded the project at the Chelsea Studio in Nashville, Tennessee in 1985. The album was a collection of ten tracks. It included re-recordings of Pruett's two major hits in the 1970s: \\"Satin Sheets\\" (1973) and \\"Back to Back\\" (1979). Among the album's new tracks was a cover of Randy Travis's major hit \\"I Told You So\\". The final track on the record, \\"Rented Room\\", was written entirely by Pruett. Jeanne Pruett was released in October 1985 in conjunction with Dot and MCA records. In its original release, the album was issued as a vinyl record, containing five songs on each side of the LP. In 1995, it was reissued as an audio cassette. No singles were originally released from the album. Instead, artists were expected to sell their new releases at their concerts and tours. However, in 1987, \\"Rented Room\\" would be released as a single and would peak at number 81 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. It was Pruett's final chart appearance as a recording artist. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== All credits are adapted from the liner notes of Jeanne Pruett.

As a selector and manager, he worked with the Clare county team. As a provincial administrator he was pivotal in establishing an open draw in the Munster Senior Football Championship. As a national administrator he was pivotal in the overturning of the Gaelic Athletic Association's Rule 42, the introduction of the All-Ireland Qualifiers and the spread of floodlights to club and county grounds. At his death he was remembered locally and nationally as one of the sport's most progressive administrators. He was often referred to as \\"Mr Clare Football\\". ==Early life== Patrick Hillery, later the sixth President of Ireland, delivered Walsh upstairs in the family-owned pub. Hillery was 12 years of age at the time. Walsh played golf as a young man, had membership of Spanish Point and Lahinch Golf Clubs and qualified for the South of Ireland championship several times, while during the 1960s, he won a President's Prize at Lahinch Golf Club. Though he moved to Limerick, he still held his allegiance to Clare. ==Career== He was part of the Defence Forces, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. ===Player=== Walsh played for the Milltown Malbay club. With them he twice won the Clare Senior Football Championship, in 1953 and 1959. He played for the Clare county team at minor and junior grades. ===Selector=== Walsh spent twenty years as a selector for the Clare football team at senior level. One of these years was 1992, when Clare won the Munster Senior Football Championship. It was the first time since 1935 (and still the last time when Walsh died) that the duopoly of Cork–Kerry had been broken. Walsh had been responsible for bringing the winning manager John Maughan to Clare. He was a Clare selector at all football grades. Walsh was also a selector for the Munster football team. ===Manager=== Walsh also managed the Clare football team at senior level for three terms. ===Administrator=== Walsh was secretary and chairman of his club Milltown Malbay. He was also chairman of Clare Bórd na bPáirc. Walsh spent eight years as Clare's County Board delegate to the Munster Council. He served as vice-chairman of the Munster Council from 1992 and became chairman of the Munster Council in 1995, after Tom Boland. Walsh was chairman of the Munster Council until March 1998. He presented the Munster Cup to Anthony Daly when Clare won the Munster Senior Hurling Championship for the first time in 63 years in 1995. Walsh advocated an open draw for the Munster Senior Football Championship (Cork and Kerry tended to be seeded). He persevered with this, even when set back by opposition to the idea. He was eventually successful. This was in 1990, two years before Clare broke the duopoly, Limerick having had the first attempt in a narrow loss to Kerry in the 1991 Munster Senior Football Championship Final. Walsh was chairman of several committees, including the Coaching and Games Development Committee, the Provincial Football Development Committee and the Amateur Status Committee. He was a member of various workgroups, including the Disciplinary Rules Workgroup, the Féile Peil na nÓg Workgroup and the Railway Cup Workgroup. He spent three years as a member of the Management Committee and Central Council. His chairing of the Football Development Committee led to the introduction of the All-Ireland Qualifiers. Other work included the introduction of floodlights to GAA stadiums and advocacy on the part of the Railway Cup. When chairman of the Munster Council, Walsh had a pilot project for floodlights at Tralee's Austin Stack Park which \\"became a template for every county and club ground in the country\\". Joe McDonagh, when GAA president, appointed Walsh as chairman of the National Football Development Committee. Walsh himself twice ran for the presidency and was elected a GAA trustee in 2000. Seán McCague beat him into third place in the presidential election of 1999. Walsh then lost to Seán Kelly in the presidential election of 2002. Walsh wanted Croke Park opened up to other sports. Walsh credited the original motion to Tom Kenoy of Roscommon but took up the task himself when the motion lost by two-thirds of one vote — 176 to 89. Rule 42 was eventually amended at the 2005 GAA Congress to permit the opening of Croke Park. Walsh via his club brought a motion to the 2015 GAA Congress asking for all county grounds to be opened to other sports. This time he did not succeed. However, Walsh's motion later helped justify holding a tribute association football match to Liam Miller at Páirc Uí Chaoimh. ==Death== He died at Ennis General Hospital on 29 April 2020. He was 84 years of age. The cause was pneumonia resulting from COVID-19. He was survived by his wife Ursula, two daughters, a son and three grandchildren. ==References== Category:1935 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland Category:GAA people from County Clare Category:Gaelic football managers Category:Gaelic football selectors Category:Gaelic games administrators Category:Irish Army officers Category:Milltown Malbay ","title":"Noel Walsh"},{"id":"63920191","text":"Peter Nichols is an American author.

It is one of two mourning days in Turkmenistan (the other being Memorial Day). ==Background== It caused extreme damage and a high number of casualties in the city. Saparmurat Niyazov, who would later become the first President of Turkmenistan, was the only member of his family to survive the earthquake, which killed two of his brothers and as well as his mother. His mother Gurbansoltan Eje later became part of the cult of personality in Niyazov's presidency. The earthquake so claimed the life of Berdymukhamed Annaev, grandfather of Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, the current President. Due to censorship of the tragedy by the Communist Party of Turkmenistan and the government of the Turkmen SSR, the event was not widely reported in the national media in the Soviet Union. Aid to victims, as well as restoration of infrastructure was provided by the Soviet Army, with many victims being sent to the neighboring republics of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. ==Commemorations== The country officially began to observe this holiday in 1995. The national memorial ceremony is held at the Halk Hakydasy Memorial Complex, attended by President of Turkmenistan. The leaders of the Assembly of Turkmenistan and members of the Cabinet of Ministers lay flowers at the monument. Ceremony participants observe a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the earthquake. The only ceremony in which the president did not attend was the 55th anniversary in 2003, during which President Niyazov had the common cold. Ceremonies are also held in different regions of the country. For example, the 2010 ceremony was held in Gypjak. Other memorial actions, particularly prayers and Sadaqah are done in memory of those who died. National flags are traditionally lowered to halfmast in the capital of Ashgabat as well as in the Provinces of Turkmenistan.

In 2010, Laurens van den Acker presented a daisy with six petals corresponding to so many concept cars symbolizing a moment \\"in the cycle of life\\" (Love (love), Explore (exploration), Family (family), Work (work), Play (leisure) and Wisdom). The DeZir is the first petal of this daisy and the Initial Paris the last. In 2016, the Renault TreZor is the first petal of the second daisy of Renault concept cars. It inaugurates a new series of six concept cars and corresponds to the “Love” life cycle like DeZir six years earlier. Symbioz is the last petal of this life cycle corresponding to wisdom (Wisdom). Thus for seven years, all these concept cars were extended to a life cycle and created the new visual identity of Renault, seen by Laurens van den Acker. On 4 September 2017, before its presentation, Renault unveiled a video announcing the arrival of the Symbioz concept car at the IAA. As with the models in Renault's electric range (Zoe, Twizy) or its concept cars (DeZir, Trezor), the Symbioz “Z” symbolizes “zero emissions”, and therefore electric motorization. In November 2017, Renault presented a second version of its show car, called Symbioz “Demo-car”, capable of driving on open roads and which differs from the static concept car with headlights, doors and real conventional seats. This Symbioz is equipped with autonomous driving. ==Technical characteristics== The Symbioz is equipped with two electric motors, one for each rear wheel, developing 680 hp in total for 660 N m of torque, it accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6 seconds for a range of around 500 km. == References == == External links == * Symbioz Category:Coupés Category:Electric concept cars Category:Cars introduced in 2017 ","title":"Renault Symbioz"},{"id":"63920669","text":"Peter Nichols may refer to: * Peter Nichols (playwright) (1927–2019), English playwright * Peter Nichols (journalist) (1928–1989), English newspaper journalist and author * Peter Nichols (author), American author * Peter Nichols, pseudonym of science fiction writer John Christopher ==See also== *Peter Nicholls (disambiguation) ","title":"Peter Nichols"},{"id":"63920683","text":"On 9 May 2020, gunmen attacked several villages in the Tillabéri Region of Niger.

The firearm's locking mechanism uses a linkless, vertically tilting barrel with a rectangular breech that locks into the ejection port cut-out in the slide.

The trigger pull weight is 4 kg, and the full length of the trigger pull is 7 mm. It has a manual safety that, when engaged, disconnects the trigger from the hammer. All controls (manual safeties, slide release levers and magazine release buttons) are fully ambidextrous. A loaded chamber indicator is provided in the form of a pin that protrudes from the back of the slide when a round is present in the chamber. The PL-15-01 and PL-15K-01 variants of the pistol are striker-fired and have a single-action trigger with a significantly reduced trigger pull weight and length.

Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Chugach Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Cook Inlet via the Eklutna River and Peters Creek. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of Alaska *Geology of Alaska ==References== ==External links== * Benign Peak: Weather Forecast Category:Mountains of Alaska Category:Mountains of Anchorage, Alaska ","title":"Benign Peak"},{"id":"63920935","text":"The 1895 Ohio Green and White football team was an American football team that represented Ohio University as an independent during the 1895 college football season.

The cottage is part of the East Rockingham Heritage Precinct, which also includes other State Register of Heritage Places, like the Chesterfield Inn, Hymus House and the Bell Cottage ruin. ==History== Prior to the construction of Day Cottage, a small cottage stood at the site, with the land owned by prominent landholder Jabez White. White leased 40 acres of his land to a relative, William Day (1835–1917), in 1858 and Day, his wife Susan (1836–1929), and their oldest two children, Sarah Ann and James, settled on their new property. Susan Hymus, the sister of William Hymus and had come to the area with him, her mother, brothers and sisters in 1855 and had married William Day on 21 April 1857. The Day property was expanded with the construction of a stone shed, and the family did, too, with fifteen children born to the Days between 1857 and 1882. The expanded family made the construction of a larger homestead necessary and Day Cottage was built between 1882 and 1885 by Day, his sons and a stonemason, close to the existing buildings. Day named the place Ellendale. The building was constructed in the Victorian vernacular style, with limestone walls and an iron roof. For a short time, between 1895 and 1896, the cottage was converted into a hotel, the Rockingham Inn. In 1897, Day joined the Rockingham Roads Board, a forerunner of what is now the City of Rockingham. William and Susan Day left the property in 1901 to move to Fremantle, transferring it to their youngest three sons. Occupation of the property by the Days ceased in 1919, when it reverted back to members of the White family, and ownership and occupation changed frequently until 1962. Len and Mavis Pike purchased the land where the cottage stood in 1962, as well as additional land holding nearby, and built stables and a new dwelling north of the existing buildings. The Pikes also constructed a thoroughbred training track and horse stables at the location. Day Cottage, however, remained unoccupied and has deteriorated over the years. It was feared by the director of the Rockingham Museum that a proposed 2016 railway expansion in close proximity to the cottage could have a damaging effect on the building. ==Heritage listing== The cottage is part of the East Rockingham Heritage Precinct, which also includes other State Register of Heritage Places, like the Chesterfield Inn, Hymus House, Bell Cottage ruin and the Mead Homestead as well as heritage listed places on the municipal inventory like the East Rockingham Cemetery. Day Cottage was added to the State Register of Heritage Places on 4 May 2001. The cottage's listing is based on the fact that it is a rare intact and authentic example of a dwelling from the Western Australian colonial era. It stands on one of the earliest land grants in the Rockingham region. ==References== ==External links== * Ellendale (Day Cottage) Conservation Plan (1999) Category:State Register of Heritage Places in the City of Rockingham Category:East Rockingham, Western Australia Category:Victorian architecture in Western Australia Category:1882 establishments in Australia ","title":"Day Cottage"},{"id":"63921128","text":"Breads on Oak is a bakery and café in New Orleans, Louisiana in the United States that specializes in organic ingredients, breads, vegan cuisine, and a café style menu of breakfast and lunch food offerings.

After making his NHL debut on March 11, 2020, the NHL season was postponed due to COVID-19. During his four season tenure with the Red Deer Rebels in the Western Hockey League (WHL), he set a new franchise record for most assists. ==Early life== Hagel was born on August 27, 1998, in Morinville, Alberta, Canada. ==Playing career== Hagel began his Bantam and Midget AAA ice hockey career with the Fort Saskatchewan Rangers in the Alberta Midget Hockey League (AMJHL). In spite of recording 41 points in 33 games during the 2012–13 AMJHL season, he was overlooked in the 2013 Western Hockey League (WHL) Bantam draft being too slight. Following this, he finished third around the AMJHL in scoring and was named to the Second All-Star Team. He finished his Bantam and Midget career playing with the Whitecourt Wolverines and recording one goal and two assists in two games. ===Major junior=== On September 17, 2015, Hagel was signed as a free agent by the Red Deer Rebels in the Western Hockey League (WHL). In his rookie season with the team, he helped lead them to the 2016 Memorial Cup against the London Knights and earned a final ranking of 104th overall by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. He attributed much of his success to head coach and GM Brent Sutter, saying \\"[h]aving Brent as a coach, he pushes you every night. You have to get into the hard areas and the dirty areas for success to come....That’s what has sunk in is that for success to come, those things have to happen first. When those happen, success is going to come.\\" Hagel was eventually selected 159th overall by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to the 2017–18 season, Hagel participated in both the Rebels and Sabres' training camps. During a scrimmage with the Rebels, Hagel suffered a knee-on-knee injury and was expected to be returned to the WHL to complete the season. In spite of this, he was named an alternate captain and recorded three goals and two assists in back-to-back games against the Edmonton Oil Kings. Although he was healthy to begin the season, Hagel experienced an upper body injury and missed six weeks to recover. By June 1, 2018, the Sabres were unable to sign Hagel to a contract and relinquished their rights to him, allowing him to become eligible for the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. He was subsequently invited to the Montreal Canadiens training camp on a tryout basis but began to 2018–19 season with the Rebels. After recording 30 points in 19 games, he signed a three entry level contract with the Chicago Blackhawks worth $925,000. He continued his success through his final season in the WHL, where he set a new franchise record for most assists and was selected for the WHL Eastern Conference Second All-Star Team. Hagel surpassed Arron Asham's 161 former franchise assist record on February 9, 2019, in a game against the Moose Jaw Warriors. On March 1, 2019, Hagel scored his 100th WHL point and 38th goal of the season in a 7–4 loss to the Medicine Hat Tigers. ===Professional=== After the Rebels were knocked out of the 2019 WHL playoffs, Hagel joined the Blackhawks American Hockey League affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs, for eight games and recorded one point. He attended the Blackhawks training camp prior to the 2018–19 season but was assigned to the Rockford IceHogs to begin the 2018–19 season. Hagel made his NHL debut on March 11, 2020, the day before the NHL season was postponed due to COVID-19. As a black ace in the Blackhawks return to play first-round playoff exit, Hagel was unable to feature in a game. With the following 2020–21 NHL season to be delayed, Hagel was loaned to second tier Swiss League club, HC Thurgau, on September 30, 2020. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Contemporary records and documents preserved the name of family in various formats: Barlabasi (1381), Barrabasi (1384), Barlabasy (1386), Barabassy, Barabasy, Barabassy, Barrabasy (15th century). They were also referred to as \\"Barlabaschy\\" in Transylvanian Saxon dialect (1487) and \\"Barlabassel\\" in the register of the University of Vienna (1505), in addition to a Latin Humanist variant \\"Barlabassius\\" (1519). The first Hungarian-language charter which preserved their name was issued in 1517 by Michael II, who called himself \\"Barabási\\", in accordance with its pronunciation (but the document itself was preserved only through a 18th- century transcription). By the time of the Principality of Transylvania in the 17th century, their last name was uniformly formed as \\"Barabássy\\". Throughout the centuries, they also used various noble titles, which implied their residence, ownership of lands or location. Their first nobility prefix appeared in contemporary documents in the 1450s (according to today's spelling): \\"de Petlend\\", \\"de Mócs\\" and \\"de Szentpál\\". Later the variants \\"de Csesztve\\" (1470s) and \\"de Héderfája\\" (1490s) became more frequent. After the division of the landholdings, other prefixes were appeared in the 16th century: \\"de Alparét\\", \\"de Csíkfalva\\", \\"de Nyárádtő et Lőrincfalva\\" and \\"de Makfalva\\" (after locations, present-day all in Romania). ==Origins== According to family traditions, the Barlabássys descended from the influential and wealthy gens (clan) Borsa, but there is no contemporary record of that. The family originated from the region Beregi-Tiszahát (today roughly Szabolcs- Szatmár-Bereg County in Hungary), where Barabás (or Barlabás) also located. The assumption that the family came from Barlabás, Maros Seat (present-day Bârlibaș in Romania) is unfounded. The earliest known member of the family was one Nicholas Barlabási (), whose sons – Ladislaus, Csépán, Ivan and Nicholas – were mentioned together in February 1323. They owned a portion of land and a stone church in Pátroha. They were involved in a lawsuit with castellan Paul Magyar, who was granted the village as a royal donation by Charles I of Hungary. The brothers and Magyar reconciled with each other and the Barlabássys handed over their estates for 20 marks. The four brothers also owned Petlend (near present-day Szatmárcseke) in 1327, when they entered into a defense contract with each other. Csépán was again mentioned in 1329, when appeared as a witness in a lawsuit. While Ladislaus and Nicholas (II) had no known descendants, Csépán had two sons; Barabbas acted as royal commissioner (bailiff) in two occasions in 1374 and 1378, during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary. The younger one, George entered ecclesiastical career and was styled with the title of \\"magister\\". He served in the chancellery of the queen mother Elizabeth of Poland. After the death of Louis I, he entered the service of his widow Elizabeth of Bosnia, who acted as regent on behalf of her daughter Queen Mary. George was referred to as \\"special notary and familiaris\\" of the dowager queen in 1384. Elizabeth confirmed the previous land donation of Kissurány to the brothers in 1382. George and Barabbas presumably became disgraced by 1386; Queen Elizabeth confiscated Kissurány from them and returned it to their original owner Nicholas Kissurányi. This resulted a conflict between the two families in the upcoming decade. Ladislaus Kissurányi complained before the convent of Lelesz (present-day Leles, Slovakia) in 1394 that Barabbas' sons, John, Ladislaus and Francis constantly looted and pillaged his land. They also joined the nationwide rebellion against King Sigismund in 1403, as a result much of their possessions were confiscated, including Jánd and their ancient seat Barabás, which was shared by several families in the 15th century. The brother regained some reliance in the royal court, John and Ladislaus were referred to royal vassals (\\"homo noster\\") in 1418. They had no known descendants, which resulted the extinction of Csépán's branch. Nicholas' another son Ivan had a daughter Anne, who married a certain Peter, who possessed lands in Szabolcs County. His son Michael (I) died by 1398; his widow, a certain Veronica complained that Lawrence Mikai harassed her estates. As a result, Sigismund forced Mikai to pledge his land of Papos to the Barlabássys in that year, which resulted a long-lasting lawsuit between the two families in the 15th century. The marriage of Michael and Veronica produced two sons, Ernye, who served as vice-ispán of Bereg County in 1389, and Vincent, who was referred to as \\"homo noster\\" in 1416. At the end of his life, he was also vice-ispán of Bereg County from 1434 to 1439, as a familiaris of Ladislaus Pálóci. The later members of the Barlabássy family descended from Ernye. The last person, who had relative influence in the place of their origin was John (the grandson of Vincent), who functioned as vice- ispán of Szabolcs County from 1454 to 1456. ==Advance in Transylvania== In the first half of the 15th century, the Barlabássy family had several lawsuits with their neighbors, for instance the Mikai and Perényi families in Bereg and Szabolcs counties which contributed to the family gradually moving southeast in a direction to Transylvania. After the ancient lands in the Bereg region were permanently lost to their rivals, the Barlabássys acquired possessions along the river Maros (Mureș) in Central Transylvania, first of all at Inner and Outer Szolnok, Doboka, Kolozs and Torda counties, and later Fehér and Küküllő counties, and the Székely seat of Marosszék (\\"Maros Seat\\"). By the reign of Matthias Corvinus, they became familiares of the powerful Báthory family, one of the most influential and richest noble houses in Transylvania. Ernye's grandson John married his second wife, Veronica Haranglábi, an offspring of a rich Transylvanian family, sometime after 1440. As a dowry, John acquired portions in Kolozs and Küküllő counties – including Mócs (Mociu) –, and the Barlabássy family gradually became part of the Transylvanian elite in the second half of the 15th century. John had two sons, Michael and John. They together acquired Csesztve (today part of Ocna Mureș town in Romania) and the surrounding lands by the 1450s. They built a country-house there, which became the permanent residence of the Barlabássys. The Csesztve lordship laid along an important trade route near the river Maros and the salt mines of Marosújvár (Ocna Mureș). In the subsequent years, they also bought Csombord (Ciumbrud), Váradja (Oarda), Lomfalva and Marosszentkirály (Sâncraiu de Mureș). In Kolozs County, the Petlend branch also possessed lands, its members were Anthony and George, but their family relationship to the other branches is uncertain. Both of them only had daughters (Magdalene and Agatha, respectively), and the country-house of Petlend along the river Tur was alienated to the Borz family (the kinship of Anthony's widow). Around the same time, another member of the family (parentage is unknown), Nicholas Barlabássy de Szentpál became a prominent landowner in Székely Land, which resulted a basis for the future expansion in Marosszék. He also integrated into the Székely aristocracy (\\"chief horsemen\\"). Nicholas had three children: Michael, Dorothea and Julianna. Michael died by 1463, left behind a widow and two orphans, Nicholas and Anne. The unidentified widow was involved in a lawsuit against her sisters-in-law, refusing to the transfer of the property to which they are entitled in their late brother's last will. Dorothea married Ladislaus Demjénfy, while Julia was the wife of Blaise Meggyes de Szentgyörgy, who was involved in a nationwide conspiracy against Matthias in 1467. Julianna continued her lawsuit against her nephew Nicholas and niece Anna (wife of Pancras Bolyai). Julianna had a daughter, also Anne, who married Nicholas Tót de Szentanna. The Barlabássy de Szentpál branch died out with Nicholas around 1493, but the lawsuit between the two branches were inherited by the two Anne's husbands and their families (the Bolyai and Tót kinships), lasted until 1502. ==Heyday== John was made castellan of Gyulafehérvár by King Matthias Corvinus sometime after 1467. In the 1470s, Barlabássy entered the service of Stephen Báthory, a respected military general and Voivode of Transylvania. He participated in various campaigns and counter-attacks in response to the Ottoman incursions. As castellan of Gyulafehérvár, Barlabássy was a dedicated patron of arts and sciences. He helped to spread Renaissance arts, science and architecture throughout Transylvania. The Csesztve and Héderfája branch descended from castellan John, as his brother Michael (died before 1482) had no known children from his spouse Sophia Szentpáli. It is plausible that John married an unidentified noblewoman from the wealthy Erdélyi de Somkerék family. Their marriage produced three sons, John, Leonard and Michael. He also adopted John Lászai, a noted Humanist poet and clergyman. Among his three natural sons, Michael had no known descendants. He was referred to as vice- chamberlain of the salt chamber of Szék (Sic) in 1512. He was among the councillors of Voivode John Zápolya in January 1514. He was styled a \\"homo noster\\" in March 1517, during a lawsuit against Stephen Károlyi in March 1517. He issued a Hungarian-language contract in 1517, the first such regarding the Barlabássy family and also a somewhat noted text of the history of the Hungarian language before the Battle of Mohács (1526). ===Csesztve branch=== The eldest son, John inherited the country-house at Csesztve. Until the end of the 15th century, John and Leonard acquired possessions together, for instance Miklóslaka (Micoșlaca), Héderfája (Idrifaia) and Mikefalva (Mica), laid in Küküllő County. They remained familiares of the powerful Báthory family, which was exploited to their advantage in the rapid growth of their wealth. John married twice; his second wife was Magdalene Erdélyi from 1505 (the widow of Francis Vízaknai). It is possible that he was castellan of Görgény (today Gurghiu, Romania) in 1504. John died not long before December 1512, when his lord John Zápolya provided for the division of his landholdings in accordance with his last will and testament. The document says, John owned possessions in Alparét (Bobâlna), where a county-house laid, Zápróc (Băbdiu), Szóváros (Suarăș), Tálosfalva (Blidărești), Antos (Antăș), Erdővásárhely (Oșorhel), Radákszinye (Răzbuneni) and Bujdos (Vâlcelele) in Inner Szolnok County, present-day all settlements belong to the town of Bobâlna. Beside that, John also possessed portions in Mócs, Gyéres (Câmpia Turzii), Csehtelke (Vișinelu), Báld (Balda), Nagynyulas (Milaș), Kisszék (Săcălaia), Aranykút (Aruncuta) and Szentmárton (Gligorești) in Kolozs County, portions in Gerebenes, Kapus (Căpușu Mare), Póka (Păingeni), Ikland (Icland), Lekence (Lechința), Keménytelke (Cipăieni), Bodon (Papiu Ilarian), Szakál (Săcalu de Pădure), Pagocsa (Pogăceaua), Záh (Zau de Câmpie), Fűzkút (Sălcuța) in Torda County, in addition to whole Miklóslaka and portions in Csesztve, Benkeszeg, Ózd (Ozd), Táté (Totoi), Bagó (Băgău), Csongva (Uioara de Jos), Marosszentkirály, Oláhtordos (Turdaș) and Ispánlaka (Șpălnaca) in Fehér County. John and his unidentified first wife had five children. The eldest one Michael inherited the estate of Alparét with its country-house and accessories in 1512, in addition to Csesztve, which was shared with his brother, Bishop John, the most illustrious member of the branch. Michael married Catherine Bánffy de Losoncz, they lived in Alparét, establishing a namesake sub-branch. The second son, Bishop John was able to attend foreign universities due to his uncle Leonard's wealth and influence. John belonged to the Humanist circle centered around Gyulafehérvár. As a loyal partisan of King John Zápolya, he served as de facto the last Bishop of Csanád between 1537 and 1552, before the Ottoman Empire conquered the southern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, including the whole territory of the diocese. John's third son Gregory died young, sometime before 1512. The daughters Catherine and Sophia (also Margaret) became the spouses of Transylvanian nobles, Sigismund Szarvasdi and Oswald Bogáti de Radnót, respectively. Sometime after his first wife' death, the elderly John married Magdalene Erdélyi in 1505; they had two sons Francis and John. There were still minors during their father's death in 1512. Through a marriage, Francis acquired lands in Csíkfalva (Vărgata), becoming a member of the local Székely elite. He was involved in various lawsuits against his much older step-brother Bishop John. Among John's children, only Michael had descendants; the marriage of Michael and Catherine Bánffy produced a son, Michael. As he died early in 1516, the child was raised by his uncle Bishop John and his mother's second husband Ladislaus Kozárvári (from 1517). Michael married Catherine Tomori, daughter of Stephen Tomori, the Vice-voivode of Transylvania from 1523 to 1526 and from 1528 to 1531, and niece of Paul Tomori, commander-in-chief of the Hungarian army in the Battle of Mohács in 1526, where he was killed. Michael and his wife also lived in Alparét. Their only son, Francis was also born there around 1540. After his father died in 1555, Francis became the last offspring of the Barlabássy's Csesztve branch, inheriting large-scale landholdings throughout Transylvania and Székely Land (including Csíkfalva, owned by his namesake great-uncle). Francis supported the policy of John Sigismund Zápolya, King-elect of Hungary and later the first Prince of Transylvania. Under his influence, Barlabássy was one of those Transylvanian lords, who converted to Unitarianism from Roman Catholicism in the 1560s. After the death of John Sigismund, he was a partisan of Caspar Bekes, a claimant to the Transylvanian throne against Stephen Báthory. After Báthory's victory, Francis lost all political influence. He had an unidentified wife and children. He was slaughtered together with his family in 1599 during the Long Turkish War, thus the Csesztve branch became extinct. ===Héderfája branch=== Leonard was the most illustrious member of the Barlabássy family, who served as Vice-voivode of Transylvania from 1501 to 1525, as a familiaris of the Báthory family then John Zápolya. He and his elder brother John acquired several lands across Transylvania (see above). He built a Renaissance-style country-house in Héderfája in 1508, which was elevated into the status of his official residence. Based on the sources, it is plausible that he bought the portions of his brothers and exclusively owned the settlement alone by that time. After John Zápolya was appointed voivode in 1510, Leonard became a member of his inner advisory council. He participated in the suppression of the 1514 peasant revolt, led by George Dózsa. He was also known to have been a patron of arts, who contributed significantly to the spread of the Renaissance in Transylvania. He bequeathed different sums to several ecclesiastical institutions and monasteries. Art historian Jolán Balogh emphasized the country-house of Héderfája is the earliest surviving Renaissance-style building in the province of Transylvania, excluding the reconstructions of some royal castles. Leonard married Margaret Bogáti de Radnót. Their marriage produces five children: John, Leonard, Catherine, Magdalene and Sophia. After the death of his first wife at an unknown time, he married Magdalene Geréb de Vingárt. They had four children: Anne, Farkas, Barbara and Euphrosyne. Barlabásy's daughters were engaged to local nobles from prominent families. For instance, Magdalene became the wife of Gregory Erdélyi de Somkerék, while Sophia married to Nicholas III Vízaknai. Leonard provided for the proper education of his sons; in his last will he forbade his adult sons – John and Leonard – not to interrupt their university studies in any way. John attended the University of Kraków in 1527, and was a schoolmate of János Sylvester. John and Leonard were still alive in 1554. John had two sons, Caspar and Francis, members of the so-called Kápolna sub-branch. They were involved in a lawsuit with their cousin Leonard, son of Leonard in 1560. Caspar was a supporter of John Sigismund Zápolya. He was present at Fogaras (Făgăraș) in 1566, as a member of the retinue of Székely captain Paul Bánffy de Losoncz, who took over the castle from Gregory Apafi. Caspar lived in Kápolna (Căpâlna de Sus, 2km near Héderfája), while Francis owned Somostelke (Șomoștelnic) by 1580. Vice-voivode Leonard's youngest son Farkas was born from his second marriage. In 1544, he owned portions in Ikland, Szakál, Keménytelke and Csüdőtelke (Cuștelnic), which he donated to his sister Anne and her husband. The Makfalva sub-branch descended from Leonard, the grandson of vice-voivode Leonard. He possessed portions in Szélkút (Sălcud) and Páncélcseh (Panticeu). He married twice; his first wife was unidentified, while his second wife was the wealthy Helena Csoronk de Nagylak, the widow of Ambrose Mosdossy. They had two daughters (Margaret and Drusiana) and a son (Stephen). Leonard and Helena bought the whole part of Papfalva (Popești). Leonard and his family lived in his wife's inherited country-house at Nagylak (Nădlac). Leonard was pledged a portion in Csekelaka (Cecălaca) by John Horváth de Káptalan in 1590. Leonard was a confidant of Prince Sigismund Báthory. He was sent as an envoy to the court of Ieremia Movilă, Prince of Moldavia in 1598. His task was to free Michael Jere de Csicsó and John Simó from the captivity at Suceava. ==In the Principality of Transylvania== By the early 17th century, only two sub- branches remained from vice-voivode Leonard's offspring. The youngest son Farkas had a namesake son. Farkas (II) was a courtly familiaris of John Sigismund Zápolya. For his military service, he was granted land donations in Marosszék and Lőrincfalva (Leordeni) in 1566. The latter place became his main residence. John Sigismund also donated Nyárádtő (Ungheni) and another portions in Lőrincfalva in 1570. Following the death of John Sigismund, he supported the aspirations of Stephen Báthory. He fought in the Battle of Kerelőszentpál in 1575, where Báthory defeated his rival Caspar Bekes (Farkas' distant relative Francis supported the pretender, but missed the battle itself). During the voivodeship of Christopher Báthory, Farkas served as royal judge of Marosszék around 1580. Farkas had four children from his unidentified wife: Michael, Elizabeth, Catherine and Peter. The latter served as lieutenant of Marosszék banderium. In 1595, he acquired noble estate at Székelyvásárhely. As a partisan of Sigismund Báthory, he participated in the Battle of Temesvár in 1597, when the prince laid siege the town, held by Emperor Rudolph, but he lifted the siege when an Ottoman army of 20,000 strong approached the fortress. During the siege, Peter was wounded his chest by a bullet, leading his regiment. Farkas' daughter Catherine married Ladislaus Daczó de Sepsiszentgyörgy in 1599. Her second husband was the former Transylvanian chancellor Simon Péchi (from 1624), who was imprisoned for his Sabbatarianism. His lands were also confiscated and he was forced to return Protestantism in 1639 by Prince George I Rákóczi. Simon Péchi and Catherine lived modestly near the village of Kebele (Sânișor). Péchi died in 1643. Thereafter, Catherine was involved in a lawsuit with the daughters of Péchi from his first marriage over property matters. Prince Michael I Apafi issued an interrogation order against Catherine in 1665, but she died in the next year. Later members of the Barlabássy family descended from the Makfalva branch. Stephen, the son of Leonard (III) acquired Székely noble title, when obtained the estate of Makfalva (Ghindari) through his unidentified wife. After General Giorgio Basta invaded Transylvania, Stephen was among those nobles of Marosszék, who swore loyalty to Emperor-King Rudolph in 1602. His grandsons, George and Francis were still styled as prominent nobles from the region in 1636, during the reign of Prince George I Rákóczi. George's son Stephen participated in George II Rákóczi's disastrous campaign against Poland in 1657. As a flag-bearer of the Székely nation, he was killed during the campaign along with his servants. Stephen's brother Peter was also a confidant of George II Rákóczi. He participated in the Battle of Szászfenes (Florești) in 1660, where Rákóczi was defeated and killed. Peter was captured and later executed upon the order of Prince Ákos Barcsay. ==Family tree== Based on Sándor Barabássy's work. ===Senior branch=== *Nicholas (fl. 1323) **Ladislaus (fl. 1323–27) **Csépán (fl. 1323–29) ***Barabbas (fl. 1374–78) ****Ladislaus (fl. 1394–1418), homo noster ****Francis (fl. 1394) ****John (fl. 1394–1418), homo noster ***George (fl. 1381–86), magister, chancellery notary **Ivan (fl. 1323–27) ***Anne (fl. 1356) ∞ Peter N ***Michael (d. before 1398) ∞ Veronica N ****Ernye (fl. 1389–1416), vice-ispán of Bereg County *****Michael (fl. 1417–18), homo noster ******John (fl. 1440–62) ∞ Veronica Haranglábi --> Mócs branch *******Michael (fl. 1468–74, d. before 1482) ∞ Sophia Szentpáli *******John (fl. 1461–1509†), castellan of Gyulafehérvár --> Csesztve and Héderfája branch *****Paul (fl. 1417) *****Francis (fl. 1417) *****Gregory (fl. 1417) *****John (fl. 1417–38) *****Ladislaus ******Michael (fl. 1439) ****Vincent (fl. 1416–39), vice-ispán of Bereg County *****Helena *****Michael (fl. 1449, d. before 1464) ******John (fl. 1451–66), vice-ispán of Szabolcs County ******Helena (fl. 1466) **Nicholas (fl. 1323–27) Petlend branch *Anthony ∞ Helena Borz de Macskás **Magdalene (fl. 1457) *George **Agatha (fl. 1457) Szentpál branch *Nicholas **Michael (d. before 1463) ***Nicholas (fl. 1476, d. before 1493) ***Anne (fl. 1493) ∞ Pancras Bolyai **Dorothea (fl. 1463) ∞ Ladislaus Demjénfy **Julianna (fl. 1463–76) ∞ Blaise Meggyes de Szentgyörgy ===Csesztve and Héderfája branches=== *John (fl. 1461–1509†), see above ∞ N Erdélyi de Somkerék (?) **John (fl. 1492–1512†), homo noster ∞ 1, unidentified, 2, Magdalene Erdélyi (m. 1505) --> Csesztve branch ***(1) Michael (1516†) ∞ Catherine Bánffy --> Alparét branch ****Michael (1514–1555†) ∞ Catherine Tomori *****Francis (fl. 1545–1599†) ***(1) John (1482–1560†), Bishop of Csanád ***(1) Gregory (d. before 1512) ***(1) Catherine ∞ Sigismund Szarvasdi ***(1) Sophia (or Margaret) ∞ Oswald Bogáti de Radnót ***(2) Francis (fl. 1506) --> Csíkfalva branch ***(2) John (fl. 1507) **Leonard (fl. 1492–1525†), Vice-voivode of Transylvania ∞ 1, Margaret Bogáthy, 2, Magdalene Geréb ***(1) John (fl. 1525–54) --> Kápolna branch ****Caspar (fl. 1560–80) ****Francis (fl. 1560–80) ***(1) Leonard (fl. 1525–54) ****Leonard (fl. 1560–98) ∞ 1, unidentified, 2, Helena Csoronk de Nagylak *****(2) Margaret *****(2) Drusiana *****(2) Stephen (fl. 1602–03) --> Makfalva branch ***(1) Catherine (d. before 1524) ∞ Demetrius Nyújtódi de Keresztúr ***(1) Magdalene ∞ Gregory Erdélyi de Somkerék ***(1) Sophia (d. before 1555) ∞ 1, Nicholas Vízaknai, 2, John Glesan de Tótfalu ***(2) Anne (fl. 1525–44) ∞ Nicholas Nemes Nagy ***(2) Farkas (fl. 1525–44), d. before 1550) ****Farkas (fl. 1566–80), royal judge of Marosszék --> Nyárádtő and Lőrincfalva branch *****Michael (fl. 1591) *****Elizabeth (d. before 1627) ∞ Martin Torday de Somogyom *****Catherine (fl. 1599–1665) ∞ 1, Ladislaus Daczó de Sepsiszentgyörgy (m. 1599), 2, Simon Péchi (m. 1624) *****Peter (fl. 1595–97), lieutenant of Marosszék banderium ***(2) Barbara ***(2) Euphrosyne **Michael (fl. 1512–17), vice-chamberlain of the salt chamber of Szék (Sic) **John Lászai (1448–1523†), adopted ===Makfalva branch=== *Stephen (fl. 1602–03), see above **John (fl. 1600) ***George (fl. 1636) ∞ Anne Sinka ****Peter (fl. 1636–60†) ****Stephen (1618–57†) *****Stephen (fl. 1655–1729†) ∞ Judith Nagy de Iszla ******Stephen (fl. 1684–1778†), Kuruc captain ∞ Elizabeth Csehétfalvi *******descendants ******George (fl. 1685–1776†), envoy of Marosszék ∞ Rebecca Balogh ******Martin (fl. 1703–83†) ******Michael (fl. 1705–81†) *****Martin ∞ Judith Soó de Bere *****Nicholas ***Francis (fl. 1636–55) == References == == Secondary sources == * * * ","title":"Barlabássy family"},{"id":"63921504","text":"Hiwaga sa Balete Drive () is a 1988 Philippine horror film directed by Peque Gallaga and Lore Reyes.

Allerton was the Republican Party's nominee for Chicago mayor in 1893, losing to Democratic nominee Carter Harrison Sr. ==Early life== Allerton was born May 26, 1828 in Amenia, New York. Allerton was the son of Samuel Waters Allerton, Sr., a tailor and wool mill operator, and his wife Hannah Allerton . He was the youngest of nine children. Allerton was a descendent of Mayflower pilgrim Isaac Allerton. When Allerton was seven, amid his father had financially failed his family, and the family property was being auctioned off. This was reported to be a formative experience in Allerton's life. At the age of twelve, Allerton entered the workforce. The family experienced further financial difficulty as a result of the Panic of 1837. The family moved several times, including as far west as Dubuque, Iowa, but ultimately settled on an upstate New York farm in 1942. ==Adult life and career== Allerton rented and purchased farms, netting profits from them, and became a small-time livestock trader. He built up his involvement in livestock. He additionally made money in a venture transporting livestock over land when a break occurred in the rail line between Erie, Pennsylvania and Dunkirk, New York. Allerton then moved west, ending up in Illinois where he again raised cattle. He moved his cattle operations to Chicago in 1860, opening up Allerton Swine Yards at the terminus of the Hudson River Railroad. On July 1, 1860, Allerton wed Pamilla W. Thompson of Peoria, Illinois. She was the daughter of a wealthy cattle farmer. In 1863, Allerton and his wife Pamela had a daughter named Kate Renett Allerton. In 1864, Allerton was a key partner in the founding of the Pittsburgh Joint Stock Yards. Allerton was a leader in the push to consolidate Chicago's railroad stockyards into the Union Stock Yards. Allerton was a co-founder of the First National Bank of Chicago. Allerton led a group that invested $1 million to construct the St. Louis National Stockyards. Allerton also invested in stockyards located in Baltimore, Jersey City, St. Joseph, Missouri, and Omaha. In 1873, Allerton and his wife Pamela had their second child, a son named Robert Allerton. Allerton was widowed in 1880 after Pamilla died of scarlet fever. After this, he married Agnes C. Thompson, his first wife Pamilla's sister, on March 15, 1882. Agnes was 24 at the time of their wedding, whilst Allerton was 53. While he and Agnes never had any children of their own, Agnes was particularly motherly to Allerton's young son Robert, who was both her stepson and nephew. In 1893 he was the Republican nominee for mayor of Chicago. Allerton died on February 22, 1914. ==Wealth and property== By the turn of the twentieth century, Allerton was among Chicago's wealthiest men. At one point, Allerton was ranked by the Chicago Tribune as the third-wealthiest man in Chicago, behind only Marshall Field and J. Ogden Armour. Allerton was a regular presence on Chicago's society pages. Allerton owned a private Pullman railcar. Allerton had a residence on Chicago's prestigious Prairie Avenue. He also maintained homes in Lake Geneva and Pasadena. Allerton owned stockyards and farms throughout the Midwestern United States. ==References== Category:1828 births Category:1914 deaths Category:People from Amenia, New York Category:Businesspeople from Chicago Category:Illinois Republicans Category:Politicians from Chicago ","title":"Samuel W.

In 1924 he represented New Zealand in 3 tests against England and in so doing became Kiwi number 165. ==Playing career== ===Waikato Beginnings=== Hec McDonald appears to have begun playing rugby league around the age of 21 for the Frankton Albions in 1921 where he is mentioned as being “a new man” after an appearance against Pirates on May 21. In 1922 he had a busy season playing for a large number of teams including the newly formed Matangi club side, the Cambridge sub union team, the Rotorua sub union team and the Bay of Plenty side against the touring New South Wales team. He played for Matangi from May through to July in the fledgling Cambridge league competition. In a match against Athletics he was involved in 3 tries in a 23-0 win The following weekend he played in a 5-3 loss to Suburbs where McDonald was described as “a hard man to beat, playing on the ball well”. The game was notable because it was the opening of the short lived League Park on Clare Street in Cambridge with Mayor Sam Lewis present for the ceremony. In a May 27 match against City McDonald scored 3 tries in a 36-11 win. During his time playing for Matangi he was picked for the Cambridge B team to play against the Hamilton B team on June 24. He was then picked for the Cambridge side to play against Hamilton. They lost 21 points to 12 before playing Auckland at Carlaw Park (a ground he was to become familiar with) and were thrashed 73-29 by a side which featured 11 New Zealand international players. McDonald was then picked to play for Rotorua against Tauranga in the first ever rugby league match played in Tauranga on September 16. The game had been organised to a large degree by former New Zealand international George Iles who had moved to Tauranga and attempted to establish the game there. McDonald scored a try after “a loose scramble” in a 29 to 28 win to Rotorua. McDonald was then selected for another historic match. He was chosen to play for the Bay of Plenty representative team against the touring “Kangaroos” which in actual fact was the touring New South Wales side. The match was played at Arawa Park, Rotorua on September 26 with the Bay of Plenty side featuring George Iles, and future Kiwi George Gardiner. The visiting New South Wales team featured the likes of Frank Burge and Reg Latta. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5. In 1923 McDonald was again playing for the Matangi side, and also made appearances for Cambridge against Hamilton on June 16 which they lost 32 points to 11 at Victoria Square in Cambridge with McDonald playing five eighths. They played a return match at Hinemoa Park in Hamilton a week later on June 23. Hinemoa was a new rugby league ground in Hamilton and McDonald was said to have played a “fine game” despite much of the field being heavy and partially underwater due to recent rains. ===City Rovers, Auckland, and New Zealand debut's=== Hec McDonald first played for the City Rovers on August 18, 1923 with his name first appearing in their team list the day before. He was described as “a recent City recruit, [who] showed fine form in the open and should be of great assistance to his side”. City had needed to win the match against Athletic to force a playoff for the title and McDonald joined the side that week. City won the game 11-8 in front of 8000 spectators at Carlaw Park, and then in the championship final the following week McDonald played again in an 8-7 victory to claim the 1923 Auckland Rugby League championship. McDonald was said to be “playing a fine game” during the final win. It was said in the New Zealand Herald that “on the form displayed in his first two games for City, McDonald is worthy of consideration by the League selectors”. McDonald’s first try for City came in a 49-12 win over Devonport United in a Roope Rooster semi-final win where he was said to be “the outstanding man in all-round work”. McDonald then played in the final against Ponsonby United which City lost 14 points to 3. A writer for the Auckland Star said of McDonald that he gave “a fine display” and “is one of the best forwards playing in the league this season”. Hec McDonald made his debut for Auckland against an Auckland Province side made up of players from Auckland and also the Waikato region. McDonald scored 2 tries in a high scoring 44-15 win to the Auckland city team. It was said of his forward display that he “was easily the best”. His final game of the season came in a match for Auckland against South Auckland for the Northern Union Challenge Cup. He scored a try after following up a kick as Auckland won the match 35-11. In 1924 he began the season still in a City Rovers jersey. He was joined in the team by his brother “M McDonald” before his brother transferred to Newton Rangers early in the 1925 season. He played 4 matches for them before being selected in the Auckland team to play against the touring Australian Universities side. They played 3 matches against them with McDonald playing in all of them. They were played within an 11 day period at Carlaw Park from June 4 to June 14 and saw the Auckland team win all three matches 15-7, 17-2 and 14-4. In the first match he played in the second row alongside New Zealand “Legend of League” Bert Avery where McDonald was said to be “the best of a fine bunch…, he was brilliant”. In the 17-2 victory McDonald was also prominent despite the match being played on a surface covered in water with some suggestion beforehand that it should be postponed. For the third match McDonald was joined in the second row by Nelson Bass after Avery had injured his knee in the match prior. Auckland won 14-4 with McDonald said to be “again the best forward on the ground”. After 4 further games for City McDonald was named in the reserves for the Auckland team to play against the touring England team but did not take the field as reserves were only used at this time to replace injured players during the first half of matches. He was then named in the reserves for the Auckland Provincial team to play England but after Tut Wilson was unable to play he replaced him in the starting line up. McDonald played well, being “noticeable in fine hustling work” in a 28-13 loss in front of 7000 at Carlaw Park He was then selected in the reserves for the first test match between New Zealand and England after being initially named to start but being replaced by Neil Mouat from the West Coast side.. He was then named in the squad to travel south for the second and third tests which were to be played in Wellington and Dunedin respectively. New Zealand won the first test 16 to 8 at Carlaw Park, and followed it up with a win in the second test by 13 to 11 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. McDonald was to make his debut for New Zealand in the third test played at Tahuna Park, Dunedin. An enormous crowd of 12,000 turned out to see England victorious by 31 points to 11 with McDonald playing lock in a forward pack featuring Jim O'Brien, Sam Lowrie, Ernie Herring, Neil Mouat, and Lou Peterson. McDonald was said to have played well and he along with O'Brien “showing up at all times”. In 1925 McDonald played again for City Rovers, and after playing in 7 games for them he was selected for the Auckland A team to play against the Auckland B team. The match was part of a series of three trial matches played on the same afternoon to try and choose the New Zealand team to tour Australia. The other matches were North Island against South Island and Auckland C against South Auckland. McDonald’s Auckland A team (a B team for all intents and purposes due to the large number of first choice players representing the North Island team) was defeated by Auckland B by 5 points to 0. McDonald missed selection for the New Zealand team but was to play against them less than a week later for Auckland, with New Zealand winning 16 to 9. Following City’s Roope Rooster semi-final win over Devonport United, Auckland played a midweek match against South Auckland for the Northern Union Challenge Cup. McDonald played in the second row in a 24-16 win by the Auckland side at Carlaw Park in front of 3,000 specators. McDonald was then involved in the Roope Rooster final where City lost to rivals Ponsonby United 10-5 before a 7,500 strong crowd. Following the New Zealand teams return from Australia they played Auckland at Carlaw Park and McDonald was chosen for the Auckland team. The national side trounced McDonald’s Auckland by 41 points to 17 in front of a massive crowd of 15,000. He missed selection for the New Zealand team again for the matches against the touring Queensland team but was selected for the Auckland B team for their southern tour where they would play matches against the West Coast, Canterbury, and Wellington. McDonald appeared in all 3 matches and scored a try and kicked a goal in their 68 to 9 win over Wellington at Newton Park, Wellington. The matches against West Coast and Canterbury were won 22-15 and lost 6-5 respectively. McDonald then stayed in Wellington to play for a combined team against Queensland made up of players from Auckland, Waikato, Wellington, and Canterbury. They were defeated by the tourists by 44 points to 20. McDonald was said to have had a “fine game, his fast following up delighting the spectators. McDonald then departed City Rovers and left the club before their Stormont Shield final match with Ponsonby United. In the 1925 season he had played for them 14 times and scored 9 tries which was the equal 4th most in the 1925 Auckland Rugby League season. In total he made 29 appearances for them, along with 8 for Auckland, 1 for Auckland Province, and 4 for Auckland B. ===Return to the Waikato=== It was thought that McDonald would return to play for City in 1926 and he was even listed in their teams for the early games in the season but he did not play as he had not arrived back in Auckland. It was then announced in late May that he \\"was expected in Auckland last week, as he intended to play for City again, but he has evidently altered his plans\\" and is now \\"one of the leading players under the control of the newly-established League centre at Rotorua. He was to represent Rotorua who were a sub-union of the South Auckland league and the South Auckland representative team several times. South Auckland these days would be better known as the Waikato rugby league team. He played for Rotorua against a Hamilton/Lower Waikato combined team in June with his side losing 23 to 15. McDonald then played in matches for South Auckland against Wellington and Auckland on June 23 and June 27 respectively. He scored a try in the Wellington match which South Auckland won 16 to 12, while his side was soundly beaten by his former Auckland team 49 to 15.. McDonald then captained Rotorua to a 17-2 loss at the hand of a Lower Waikato side on August 7. Just 4 days later he played for South Auckland against the touring Otago side and scored a try in a 30-12 loss. On October 9 McDonald returned to Carlaw Park to play against Auckland for the Northern Union Challenge Cup with Auckland running out the winners by 25 points to 8. It was said of McDonald that “playing as the loose forward McDonald showed untiring dash, and was prominent in every attacking movement that the visitors launched”. In 1927 McDonald once again returned to Carlaw Park playing for South Auckland in an October 15 game. This time he was playing five eighth and captaining the side. He helped guide his side to a 29-12 win over Auckland and in so doing they won the Northern Union Challenge Cup It is unknown if McDonald continued to play rugby league after this match. ==References== Category:New Zealand rugby league players Category:New Zealand national rugby league team players Category:Bay of Plenty rugby league team players Category:Auckland rugby league team players Category:City Rovers players Category:Waikato rugby league team players ","title":"Hec McDonald"},{"id":"63921650","text":"Calafate is a Belo Horizonte Metro station on Line 1.

It was built in the Netherlands and has been in service since 1988. Originally intended as a support and logistics ship, Konarak was overhauled in 2018, and was armed with anti-ship missiles. The vessel was struck by a missile fired from the in a friendly fire incident during training on 10 May 2020, killing 19 sailors. ==Description== Konarak was built in 1988, at the K. Damen Shipyards, in Boven-Hardinxveld, the Netherlands, as hull number 1403. It was ordered and purchased before the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The twelve s were constructed in the 1980s and 1990s, six of them at the K. Damen Shipyards, and the remainder under contract in Iran. Questions were raised in the Dutch parliament over the delivery of the ships during the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War but as the ships were unarmed and not combatant vessels, an export license was not necessary. The Netherlands also delivered a tug and a water tanker to the Iranian Navy during this period. Konarak has been in service since 1988. Konarak has a displacement of at full load, is in overall length, wide, and has a draft of . It is capable of carrying of cargo on deck, in its holds/tanks, and 90 troops. ==Service== Ships of the Hendijan class have been used as support vessels and in logistics roles. In recent years they have been repurposed as combatant vessels with anti-shipping weapons installed. Konarak was overhauled in 2018 and was given missile-launch capability and could be used to lay mines. Konarak had no anti-missile weaponry, though it may have had a Oerlikon cannon and four Nasr-1 anti-ship missiles. It joined the Iranian naval force based at the city of Konarak on 7 October 2018. ===2020 friendly fire incident === On 10 May 2020, the ship was struck by a Noor missile fired from the when in the Strait of Hormuz. Official Iranian TV initially reported one fatality in the incident, but this was later revised to 19 killed and 15 injured. Konarak was involved as a tender, setting out targets for target practice for missiles from Jamaran. Konarak reportedly failed to distance itself sufficiently from the target prior to the launch and was struck by a missile. The missile may have automatically locked onto Konarak as the largest target or else been set as the target by human error. After the incident, Konarak was towed to port in order to undergo a technical inspection. Footage published by the Iranian state broadcaster IRIB showed the ship down heavily by the bow with its superstructure devastated and smoke visible from fires. ==See also== * List of current ships of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy * * Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 * ==References== Category:1988 ships Category:Friendly fire incidents Category:Maritime incidents in 2020 Category:Minelayers of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy Category:Ships built in the Netherlands Category:Supply ships of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy ","title":"IRIS Konarak"},{"id":"63921779","text":"Tanya Smith (born 12 December 1984) is an Australian basketball player who played NCAA Division I at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in the Women's National Basketball League for Townsville Fire, Sydney University Flames and a short stint for Canberra Capitals.

Brock worked for many years on the commission for the development of study programmes for music education in the GDR and was temporarily head of this commission. She retired at the end of the spring semester 1980. From 1967 to 1971 she was a member of the Volkskammer (5th) in the parliamentary group of the Cultural Association of the GDR. Brock has a daughter (b. 1953) and a son (b. 1955). Her brother Walther Siegmund-Schultze was also a musicologist. == Grieg research == Grieg-Begegnungsstätte in Leipzig Brock first dealt with Edvard Grieg in Greifswald, when she invited the Norwegian musicologist Olav Gurvin to a lecture on Grieg during the .Grieg-Forscherin Hella Brock wird 95 Jahre alt. In Leipziger Volkszeitung, 2 October 2014, . In 1985 she received permission to travel to Oslo for research purposes. In the following years she completed her knowledge of the Norwegian language and collaborated with Grieg researchers from the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. Brock published basic works in the German language. Brock was significantly involved in the preservation of the former place of work of Edvard Grieg in Leipzig. In October 1998 the association Grieg Meeting Place Leipzig was founded with the aim of establishing a memorial and meeting place for the composer in the house built in 1874 by Otto Brückwald for the Edition Peters at Talstraße 10. Brock was elected the first president of the association. Thanks to the initiative of the association, the dilapidated private rooms of the publisher families Max Abraham and Henri Hinrichsen, in which Edvard Grieg was often a guest, were renovated and opened in 2005 as Grieg meeting place.Website of the Grieg- Begegnungsstätte Leipzig e. V. Under Brock's leadership, the association held two Grieg conferences with international participation in 2004 and 2008. For reasons of age, she resigned in 2008 as president of the Grieg meeting place LeipzigVorstandswechsel im Grieg-Verein.

Two engines promote in every league, with the top two engines of the Premier Division contesting a 100-game superfinal. Updates are allowed only between League Three and League Two, between League One and Premier Division, and between Premier Division and the superfinal. In a small change to previous seasons' rules, draw adjudication now occurs if the evaluations of both engines are within +/− 0.15 for five consecutive moves, after move 35. This increases the threshold of evaluation compared to +/− 0.08 for the previous season. In contrast to previous seasons, only active engines that are stronger than the best humans are invited to participate. The addition of the \\"active\\" criterion means that several veteran competitors, such as former champions Jonny and Houdini, are not participating.https://imgur.com/5LX0JoY Further, a more stringent uniqueness criterion meant that PeSTO (which shares a search algorithm with rofChade) and Komodo MCTS (which shares an evaluation algorithm with Komodo) are not participating. ===Tiebreak rules=== The tiebreak rules for TCEC Season 18 are: #For any event except the superfinal: the number of crashes. #Head-to-head score. #Number of wins. #Sonneborn–Berger score. #A decision by the tournament organizers. ===Hardware changes=== For this season, TCEC upgraded its GPU servers to four V100s, while the CPU servers largely stayed the same. ==Results== ===Qualification League=== Ten engines participated in the Qualification League. Seven engines returned from the previous year, Monolith returned after a two-season hiatus, and two new engines (Combusken and Weiss) made their first appearances. The league turned out to be very closely contested: every engine lost at least two games, and in the final standings, only 2 points separated winner Counter from 7th-placed Combusken. This meant that seven engines were in with a chance up until the final games. Eventual 2nd-place finisher Asymptote staged a mini-comeback after a poor first round to finish second, ahead of 3rd-placed Monolith on the back of a head-to-head win. chess22k, the only engine that had promoted out of QL previously, started well but stalled in the second half and ended in 4th place. Tail-enders Bagatur and Weiss were heavily handicapped by only being able to make use of one thread while their competitors usually ran on 176, and finished with only 5/18 and 1.5/18 respectively. ===League Three=== Ten engines participated in League 3. Every engine here played in Qualification League last year, and while the top and bottom engines were unchanged, the order of the middle engines saw some shifting. Demolito took advantage of S17 QL winner Defenchess leaving for greener pastures to win League 3 with 12/18. Second place was closely contested, with Igel taking a 1-point lead after 60 games, only to see Gogobello storm from behind with a string of victories, including an impressive win as black over Demolito, and place second by 0.5 points. Meanwhile Pirarucu, which finished ahead of both Igel and Gogobello last year, placed a disappointing 6th, though it did hand Gogobello its only loss. On the other end, QL promoters Counter and Asymptote found League 3 far more unwelcoming and relegated back to QL with 7/18 and 6/18 respectively. Counter initially looked like it could hold on, starting out with 10 straight draws, but finished with 4 losses and 4 draws in its remaining games, becoming the only engine not to win a game. ===League Two=== Booot, Chiron, and ChessBrainVB, which did not play in the previous season because they did not run on Wine, all returned to play this season in League Two. Among the competitors three engines quickly distanced themselves from their rivals: Booot, Pedone and Winter. Booot was comfortably in the lead for most of the division and was the first to promote, while Winter trailed after losing a game against Pedone. In one of the final games of the league, Winter scored a win against Booot, which put it half a point ahead of Pedone; however, it was all for naught as Pedone drew its game in hand against Chiron, which tied the scores between the two and let Pedone qualify on tiebreak. At the bottom of the table, in a repeat of League Three, the two promoted engines Demolito and Gogobello found the competition much stiffer and were both relegated back to League Three. ===League One=== Fire, which had performed respectably in last season's Premier Division in spite of not having been updated for over a year, won League One. Along with last season's promotion rival rofChade, it did not lose a game the entire league, with both finishing comfortably above third- placed Booot. In contrast, the middle of the table was fiercely contested. Booot was the only engine to score two wins against its mid-table rivals, defeating Fritz and ScorpioNN, but it lost a game to last-place Pedone. Defenchess lost a game to Xiphos, but it along with Fritz was able to 2–0 Pedone, thereby taking 4th and 5th respectively. Last season's Premier Division engine ScorpioNN, as well as League One contender Xiphos, both performed solidly and lost only one game; however, they also only scored one win which was insufficient to fight for the top spots. At the other end of the table, promoted engine Pedone was quickly outclassed, losing eight games. For the other relegation spot, both Arasan and RubiChess failed to score any wins, but Arasan lost only one game, leaving RubiChess to relegate. ===Premier Division=== In the Premier Division, Stoofvlees (which had not been updated since Season 17) took a surprising lead after the first round robin. It recorded the only double-kill (winning with both sides of the same opening) against rofChade, and by the end of the first round robin, was on +4 while pre-tournament favorites Stockfish, Leela and AllieStein were only +2. The lead did not last, however. Stockfish played a sterling second round robin, including a win against both Stoofvlees and AllieStein, to take first place. Leela also closed the gap by not losing any games while defeating Ethereal, rofChade and Fire. By the third round robin, Stockfish was effectively qualified for the superfinal, while the last remaining slot was still up for grabs. Leela effectively eliminated Stoofvlees after the latter blundered a simple tactic (see diagram). AllieStein was only a win behind, however, and had superior tiebreakers to boot. Leela defeated Ethereal, only for AllieStein to keep pace by beating Komodo. It looked as though Stoofvlees' blunder might've been decisive to Leela qualifying for the superfinal. The question was finally settled in game 164 when AllieStein lost the reverse game to Komodo, which qualified Leela for the superfinal. Both Leela and first-placed finisher Stockfish did not lose a game in the division. ===Superfinal=== The superfinal was contested between reigning champion Leela Chess Zero and last season's runner-up Stockfish.See the Season 18 archives at https://tcec- chess.com/#div=sf&game;=1&season;=18 The 100-game match began with both engines winning in a King's Indian Defense, before Stockfish took the lead by winning three consecutive openings. After a balanced interlude, Stockfish won game 24 to open up a commanding 4-point lead, the largest deficit Leela had ever faced in a superfinal. Leela finally got back to winning ways with a strong performance in game 29, and narrowed the gap further by winning game 33. However, with wins in games 52, 56 and 58, Stockfish established its dominance once again. However, Leela fought back with a win in game 63, and then followed up with an astonishing queen sacrifice in game 65 (see game analysis below) in what was perhaps the single best performance from either engine in the entire superfinal – GM Matthew Sadler would later call this game Leela's queen sac Immortal – but Stockfish countered with wins in games 68, 77, 88 and 92 to secure what would prove to be a decisive lead. With eight games left, Leela needed to win seven of them in order to win. It managed to win game 93, but promptly lost game 94, which gave Stockfish an unassailable lead. Leela scored a consolation win in game 97. The final score was +23−16=61 in favor of Stockfish. One game pair in the superfinal stood out as unique: games 17-18 featured an opening which, to GM Sadler's knowledge, was playable. However, both finalists evaluated the book exit position (diagram) as providing a decisive advantage for White. GM Sadler opined that these two games might eventually be the final refutation of the entire variation. Most of the notes below are by GM Sadler. ===Game 8=== This opening featured a dubious line of the Triangle setup against the Queen's Gambit. After successfully defending the Black position in Game 7, Stockfish unleashed this demolition job with the white pieces. White: Stockfish (chess) Black: Leela Chess Zero Opening: Queen's Gambit Declined (ECO D31) 1\\\\. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. Bg5 f6 6. Bd2 b5 (see diagram) :Black's fifth move is known to be dubious, with Triangle system experts Ruslan Shcherbakov and Mikhail Krasenkow both critical of it. Nonetheless, these first six moves were included in the TCEC opening book, forcing both engines to defend Black's position. 7\\\\. a4 :In game 7 when Leela had the white pieces, she had played 7.e4. After 7...a5 8.a4 Bb4 9.axb5 Bxc3 10.Bxc3 cxb5 11.Nh4 g6 12.b3 f5 (amazingly, Stockfish is defending with only pawn moves) 13.d5 Qxh4 14.Bxh8 Qxe4+ 15.Be2 Qxd5 16.bxc4 Qxd1+ 17.Bxd1 b4 we have an unusual position where after 17 moves, all remaining pieces are on the first and eighth ranks. Black has given up a rook and bishop for two knights and connected passed pawns on the a- and b-files. The bishop pair in an open position gave Leela some initiative, but Stockfish was able to hold without much drama. 7... b4 8. Ne4 f5 :In keeping with its style, Leela seeks active counterplay instead of trying to defend its position (which is full of weaknesses) passively. 9\\\\. Ng3 Nf6 10. e3 :Attacking the c4-pawn. 10... Ba6 11. Be2 (see diagram) :Stockfish could play 11.Rc1 attacking the c4-pawn immediately, but chooses to delay instead. GM Sadler called this move 'clever', since it challenges Leela to find a way to develop her pieces while still fending off the attack on the c4-pawn when it does come. 11... c5 :Leela could react with simple development such as 11...Qd5 or 11...Bd6, but takes the aggressive approach instead. This is a risky move, opening the position before castling. 12\\\\. dxc5 Nbd7 :An ambitious move, Leela eschews 12...Bxc5 in favor of recapturing with the knight. The point is that if Black gets in 12...Nxc5, suddenly its pawn on c4 is supporting potential outposts on b3 and d3. The downside is capturing the pawn after 13.c6 is inconvenient, since it can be defended with Nd4. 13\\\\. c6 Nc5 14. Nd4 f4 (see diagram) :In a very unclear position, Leela could have played 14...g6 (preparing preparing 15...e5 to kick the d4-knight), 14...Qd5, or 14...h5. Instead, she chooses another aggressive move. 15\\\\. Nh5 Nfe4 :Black could have considered 15...f3, jettisoning the pawn and leading to massive complications. After 16.Nxf6 Qxf6, White is forced to capture, after which Black gets to develop counterplay: Black has ...Nd3+ after Bxf3, ...Nb3, ...Qxb2 or ...Rd8 after Nxf3, while gxf3 weakens White's pawn structure. 16\\\\. 0-0 :Stockfish's evaluation jumped after this move, indicating it did not approve of 15...Nfe4. 16... e5 :Black threatens ...exd4, ...g6 to trap the knight on h5, and ...Nxd2. 17\\\\. Bxb4 exd4 18. Nxf4 Rb8 (see diagram) :By now Stockfish was declaring a near-decisive +2.00 eval, while Leela still showed only +0.28. Black is up a piece for two pawns, but the king is still in the center. Black has many options, but according to GM Sadler, as long as Stockfish handled the white pieces, White always seemed to be winning: :*18...d3 creates a protected passed pawn on the 3rd rank, but White counterattacks quickly with 19.Bh5+ g6 20.Nxg6 hxg6 21.Bxg6+ Ke7 22.Qf3 (see analysis diagram 1). With the knight on c5 pinned, White threatens Qxe4. Black's king is in the center and has no pawn shield as well. Stockfish crushed Stoofvlees in one of GM Sadler's analysis games after 22...Kd6 23.Qxe4 Qh4 24.f4 Rd8 25.Bxc5+ Kxc5 26.b4+ Kb6 27.Qe5 Bxb4 28.Rab1 Qxh2+ 29.Kf2 Qh4+ 30.Kf3. :*18...Qf6 is GM Sadler's initial reaction, but it does not seem to suffice. 19.Nd5 Qxc6 20.Bh5+ g6 21.Qxd4 Rg8 22.Bxc5 Nxc5 23.Bf3 0-0-0 24.Rfd1 (see analysis diagram 2) 24...Bd6 25.Nb4 Bxh2+ (25...Qc7 26.Qg4+ Rd7 [26...Kb8 loses to Nc6+, while 26...Qd7 loses to 27.Rxd6] 27.Nxa6 Nxa6 28.Rxd6 Qxd6 29.Qxc4+ forks the c8-king the g8-rook; 25...Qb6 still allows 26.Qg4+ Kb8 27.Nc6 picking up material amidst an ongoing attack) 26.Kxh2 Qc7+ 27.Qf4 Qxf4+ 28.exf4 leaves White up a pawn in the endgame. :*18...Nb3 is also very complicated, but White still seems to have a decisive attack after 19.Bh5+ g6 20.Qg4. The c6-pawn Black did not capture earlier proves to matter in some variations now, since Black can no longer play Kd7. 21...Bxb4 21.Bxg6+ hxg6 22.Qxg6+ Ke7 23.Qxe4+ (see analysis diagram 3) gives White an ongoing attack against Black's naked king. ::: ::: ::: 19\\\\. exd4 Rxb4 20. Re1 :Down two pieces, Stockfish does not bother recapturing on c5 and instead plays a quiet move. White now threatens some deadly tactics on the e-file after Bh5+. 20... Be7 21. Bh5+ g6 22. dxc5 Qxd1 23. Raxd1 Nf6 (see diagram) :Leela's last move pulls the e4-knight to safety while preventing White from playing Nd5. Leela thought the position was roughly equal, but Stockfish declared a winning +8.18 advantage after this move. 24\\\\. Bxg6+ hxg6 25. Nxg6 Rh7 26. Rd6 (see diagram) :This superhuman move leads to an astonishing position. White has a multitude of threats, such as Rxf6–f8 and c7–Rxa6 or Rd8+. In spite of being two pieces up in a queenless middlegame, plus possessing some active pieces of its own, Black is completely helpless. GM Sadler called Stockfish's play \\"witchcraft\\". 26... Ne4 27. Rxe4 Rxb2 :Leela only realized she was in trouble at this point. 28\\\\. h3 c3 29. Rf6 (see diagram) :A seemingly quiet move given Black's advancing c-pawn, this move threatens Rf8#.

Rxc1 Rxc1 40. Rd7 a5 41. Rf7 Rxc5 42. g4 Kd5 ===Game 65=== This game was what GM Sadler called the other gem of the superfinal. It featured a sharp and topical line of the Bogo-Indian in which Leela played a positional queen sacrifice that led to a long-term bind and an eventual victory. Most of the notes to this game are also by GM Sadler. 1\\\\. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+ 4. Nbd2 0-0 5. a3 Be7 6. e4 d5 7. e5 Nfd7 8. Bd3 c5 9. h4 (see diagram) :The TCEC book. White's last move is transparent in its intentions, and Black must stop the incoming Greek Gift. There are two ways about this: 9...h6 and 9...g6. Leela had played 9...h6 in the reverse, while in this game, Stockfish chose 9...g6. 9... g6 10. 0-0 :This surprising move jettisons the h4-pawn for long- term compensation. If Black takes on h4, White can play g3, Kg2, and Rh1 mounting an attack down the h-file. Black also needs time to take the pawn, which hinders his queenside development. 10... Nc6 :Taking the pawn at once is dangerous: 10...Bxh4 11.cxd5 exd5 gives White a mobile pawn on e5. 12.Nxh4 Qxh4 13.Nf3 leaves Black with weak dark squares on the kingside, and 13...Qg4 14.Be2 cxd4?! 15.Nxd4 Qh4 16.e6 gives White an initiative. 11\\\\. Nb3 Bxh4 :Stockfish takes up the challenge by taking on h4. 12\\\\. Bh6 Re8 13. Re1 :With the past two moves, Leela exploits the weakened dark squares around Black's king for rapid development, followed by cementing the pawn on e5, the backbone of her space advantage. 13... cxd4 14. Qc2 (see diagram) :14.Nbxd4? would be a tactical blunder, since after 14...Nxd4 15.Nxd4 Bxf2+ 16.Kxf2 Qh4+ Black forks the d4-knight and h7-bishop. 17.Kg1 (17.Ke3? Qxh6+) Qxd4+ 18.Be3 Qxe5 gives Black a big advantage. 14... dxc4 :Black cannot play 14...Be7 safeguarding the bishop because 15.cxd5 exd5 16.e6 gives White a strong attack. 16...fxe6 17.Bxg6 hxg6 is even checkmate after 18.Qxg6+ Kh8 19.Qg7#. 15\\\\. Bxc4 Nb6 16. Rad1 :With this move, Leela agrees to trade her light-square bishop for a knight. This turns out to be the right decision, because the dark squares are the key to Black's king position and the b6-knight could have helped defend the f6-square. 16... Bd7 17. Nc5 :Eschewing material, Leela instead goes for activity. This move intends Ne4 followed by Nd6 or Nf6. 17... Rc8 18. b4 Nxc4 19. Qxc4 (see diagram) Be7 20. Ne4 Nxb4 :By now Leela was predicting ~50% chance to win, while Stockfish was only at +0.50, although most humans would find Black's position unpleasant. Black had several alternatives instead of taking on b4, but GM Sadler could not find an appealing alternative: :*20...Nxe5? is the easiest to refute, since 21.Qxd4 threatens Qg7# while pinning the bishop on d7, winning a piece. :*20...Qb6. Black could play this to prepare 21...Nxe5; however, 21.Qd3 a6 (preventing 22.b5) 22.Nfg5 Nxe5 23.Qh3 f5 24.Nc5 is awkward for Black as White's pieces swarm the position (see analysis diagram 1). :*Black could try 20...Nb8 repositioning the knight and opening a line for the d7-bishop. 21.Qb3 Bc6 22.Rxd4 Bd5 23.Qb2 Rc4 24.Rxc4 Bxc4 25.Nd6 Bxd6 26.exd6 f6 (Black has to stop Qg7#) 27.b5 (see analysis diagram 2) is nonetheless unpleasant for Black, with no obvious way to get rid of the d6-pawn. :*Leela expected 20...a5, and intended to continue 21.b5 Nb4 22.Qxd4 Nc2 23.Qxd7 Nxe1 24.Nxe1 Rc7 25.Qd4 Qxd4 26.Rxd4 Rd8 27.Ra4 b6 28.Be3 Rd5 29.Bxb6 Rc1 30.Bxa5 Rxb5 31.Bd2 (see analysis diagram 3). Black has avoided the positional squeeze of the game, but White still has a pleasant advantage in the endgame. :: :: :: 21\\\\. Qxb4 :This queen sacrifice cements Leela's positional dominance. 21.Qxd4? would have lost an exchange after 21...Nc2. 21... Bxb4 22. axb4 (see diagram) f5 :Stockfish only realized it was in trouble at this point. 22...Rc4 was the other defensive attempt, but it does not work either: White implements the mating plan with 23.Nf6+ Kh8 24.Ng5 Qe7 25.Rd3 Ba4 26.Rh3 (see analysis diagram) after which Black must give serious material to avoid mate. :: 23\\\\. Nf6+ Kh8 :The alternative was 23...Kf7 24.Rxd4 with a crushing pin on the d-file. Black cannot simply defend the bishop with 24...Rc7 25.Red1 Re7?? because of 26.Ng5#, while 24...g5 25.Nxg5+ also gives White a crushing attack. Black's best alternative in this line might be 24...Bc6, giving the queen and going into an endgame down material but with no forced mate in sight. GM Sadler opined that this kind of desperate defense might have been more in line with Stockfish's style, although it did not play this line. 24\\\\. Rxd4 Rc7 25.

The recessed entrance was a new and common design feature on religious architecture of the time. The church was first called the \\"First Presbyterian Church of Color of Princeton\\", but reported to the General Assembly in 1845 as the \\"Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church\\". Betsey Stockton, who may have been the first black Presbyterian missionary in the U.S. helped found the church after she returned to Princeton in 1835 from her work as a missionary in Hawaii. Reverend William Drew Robeson led the church as pastor from 1879. Robeson moved into the church parsonage with his wife Maria Louisa Bustill of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and their they raised their children, including Paul Robeson. Reverend Robeson was a former slave, and as such he preached racial equality, which eventually led to his forced resignation in 1901 for being \\"too radical.\\" In 2018 the church installed a new pastor, Reverend Lukata Mjumbe, a graduate of the Princeton Theological Seminary. == References == Category:1839 establishments in the United States Category:Churches in Princeton, New Jersey Category:Presbyterian Church in America churches Category:Paul Robeson family Category:Presbyterian churches in New Jersey Category:Historically African-American Christian denominations Category:African-American Christianity Category:Presbyterian Church (USA) churches Category:Greek Revival architecture Category:New Jersey church stubs ","title":"Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church"},{"id":"63921992","text":"Estonian Youth Song and Dance Festival in 2017 Estonian Youth Song and Dance Festival () is an Estonian youth festival which encompasses both: song and dance events.

Initially attaining notoriety for his alleged involvement in a murder in October 1969, Tan fled to the Netherlands where he began his reign as a drug baron. He died of a heart attack in Copenhagen, after being at large for over 50 years. ==Career== Born Tan Tong Meng () and raised in a kampung in Serangoon, Singapore, Tan began his career as a gangster known as \\"Hylam Kia\\" (dialect for \\"Hainanese Boy\\") patrolling Bras Basah Road, Purvis Street, and Middle Road. He was arrested at least once during the 1960s. On 24 October 1969, at approximately 12:30 am local time (UTC+08:00), Tan and his fellow gang members fatally assaulted rival gang member Lam Cheng Siew, aged 31. Tan fled to Amsterdam, Netherlands, via Malaysia, with the assistance of the Singaporean See Tong gang. He became number one on Singapore's list of most wanted fugitives, with local authorities offering a $2,000 bounty in their search for him. An extradition attempt in 1973 was unsuccessful due to insufficient evidence. In Amsterdam, Tan oversaw operations by which recreational drugs were illegally produced and distributed, expanding his business through violent means. He became one of the founding members of the drug syndicate Ah Kong which dethroned the Hong Kong triad 14K as the leading drug trader in Amsterdam. At its peak, Ah Kong had over a hundred members with operations in countries like Australia, Cambodia, and Spain. Tan eventually relinquished control of Ah Kong, moving to Copenhagen in the 1980s where he established the restaurant Bali and married a local. He also successfully applied for Danish citizenship. ==Later years and death== On 5 January 2009, ahead of his birthday party at his restaurant in Copenhagen, Tan was shot in the shoulder by an assailant later identified by Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet as Vietnamese heroin smuggler Nguyen Phi Hung (born 1962) who had allegedly gotten into a dispute with Tan over financial matters. The gunman also shot a Singaporean friend of Tan's in the abdomen, who remained in a coma after being evacuated to the Singapore General Hospital in Singapore. Tan relocated to Cambodia after closing his restaurant but returned to Denmark in 2019. He died on 4 April 2020, aged 72, during a dinner party at his residence in Havneholmen, Copenhagen. The cause of death was reportedly myocardial infarction. At the time of his death, he had been at large for some 51 years. The first reports of Tan's death came from Ekstra Bladet. Tan's funeral in Frederiksberg, Denmark had around a hundred attendees, including police officers and members of the Bandidos and Hells Angels motorcycle clubs. ==Personal life== Nicknamed by the Danish media as \\"Mr. Big\\", Tan had an appetite for Singaporean cuisine and would have dishes like laksa, char kway teow, and yong tau foo delivered to him by Singaporean flight attendants travelling to Denmark. He was an avid gambler who preferred Chinese poker and dai di. Although he spent the bulk of his life living in Europe, Tan was more comfortable conversing in Hokkien. ==References== Category:1940s births Category:2020 deaths Category:Singaporean mobsters Category:Businesspeople from Amsterdam Category:Businesspeople from Copenhagen Category:Naturalised citizens of Denmark ","title":"Roland Tan"},{"id":"63922155","text":"Coat of arms of Tel Aviv The Coat of arms of Tel Aviv is an official emblem of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. ==History== In 1934, on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the city, the authorities decided to create their own coat of arms for the city.

As artist he painted royal ceremonies for Queen Victoria, and he illustrated Darwin's The Voyage of the Beagle. ==Early life and career== He was the son of Richard Ellis Pritchet and his wife Ann Dumbleton; his father was head of the firm of gunmakers at Enfield which supplied arms to the East India Company and to the Board of Ordnance. After leaving King's College School, Robert entered his father's firm. By 1852 he knew the rifle designer William Ellis Metford; the \\"Pritchett bullet\\", with a hollow, unplugged base, which he and Metford invented in 1853, brought him fame and an award of £1000 from the government on its adoption by the small- arms committee. As early as 1854 Pritchett was using his three-grooved rifle of his own invention. The abolition of the East India Company in 1858 deprived Pritchett's firm of its principal customer, and he sought other interests; but for some years he kept in touch with military rifle matters (partly through the Victoria Rifles, which corps he joined at its foundation in 1853), and he lectured on gunlocks and rifles at the Working Men's College and elsewhere. He interested himself in 1854 in the foundation of that college, of which Frederick Denison Maurice and Charles Kingsley were among the pioneers. He remained a liveryman of the Gunmakers' Company until his death. ==Art== Art was an important occupation. He exhibited views of Belgium and Brittany at the Royal Academy of Art in 1851 and 1852. He formed friendships with John Leech, Charles Keene, and Birket Foster. Through John Tenniel he joined the staff of Punch, for which he executed some 26 drawings between 1863 and 1869. In 1865 he sketched in Skye and the Hebrides, and next year he executed 100 illustrations for Cassell, Petter and Galpin. \\"Baptism of Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg at the drawing room of Balmoral Castle\\" (1887) In 1868, after a visit to the Netherlands, he received a commission for work from Thomas Agnew & Sons, who showed a collection of his pictures in their galleries in 1869. One picture was purchased by Queen Victoria, and he was soon employed on many water-colour drawings of royal functions, from \\"Thanksgiving Day\\" in 1872 to Queen Victoria's funeral in 1901. He returned to the Netherlands, where he dined at Het Loo Palace with King Leopold II of Belgium and met the painter Jozef Israëls. In 1869 and 1871 he exhibited scenes of Scheveningen at the Royal Academy, and in the latter year he published Brush Notes in Holland and made numerous sketches in Paris after the Commune. After a visit to Norway in 1874–75 he published Gamle Norge (1878). ==Cruises== In 1880 he cruised round the world with Mr and Mrs Joseph Lambert in their yacht The Wanderer, and illustrated their book The Voyage of the Wanderer (1883). In 1883 and 1885 he joined as artist the tours of Thomas (afterwards Earl) and Lady Brassey in the yacht Sunbeam, and many of his drawings appeared in Lady Brassey's In the Trades, the Tropics and the Roaring Forties (1885) and The Last Voyage of the Sunbeam (1889). ==Illustrations== \\"Homeward Bound\\", from The Voyage of the Beagle (1890) Pritchett drew illustrations for Good Words in 1881 and 1882, and made drawings for H. R. Mills's General Geography (1888) and the 1890 edition of Charles Darwin's The Voyage of the Beagle. Exhibitions of his work were repeated in London between 1884 and 1890, and he lectured on his travels. He was an enthusiastic yachtsman, and an expert on yachts and craft of all kinds. He illustrated the Badminton Library volumes on Yachting (1894) and Sea Fishing (1895), and wrote much of the text of the former. His Pen and Pencil Sketches of Shipping and Craft all round the World first appeared in 1899. A collector of curios, he was an authority on ancient armour, and issued in 1890 an illustrated account of his collection of pipes in Smokiana (Pipes of All Nations). He was more successful in black-and-white than in water-colour; his drawings of shipping are noteworthy for technical accuracy. ==Last years== Pritchett resided for many years at The Sands, Swindon, and subsequently at Burghfield, Berkshire, where he died on 16 June 1907; he was buried in the parish churchyard. His wife, Louisa Kezia McRae (died 1899), whom he married in 1857, his son Ellis (died 1905), and his daughter Marian predeceased him. With the exception of some netsuke, which he bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and some silver badges of the Ligue des Gueux, which he left to the British Museum, most of his curios, together with some of his drawings, were sold by auction by Haslam & Son at Reading in October 1907; some of his pipes were subsequently dispersed by sale in London. ==References== Attribution * Category:1828 births Category:1907 deaths Category:People educated at King's College School, London Category:English inventors Category:19th-century English painters Category:English watercolourists Category:English illustrators Category:Punch (magazine) people ","title":"Robert Taylor Pritchett"},{"id":"63922284","text":"Titilope Gbemisola Akosa, popularly known as Titilope Akosa, (born in Lagos, Nigeria) is a Nigerian environmentalist, climate justice advocate, lawyer, gender and social inclusive expert and human rights activist.

It was one of two new express trains introduced in the budget of Panampilly Govindha Menon (though he did not present the budget) for southern railway. The other express train being the West Coast Express. It was the first dieseled express train to run south of Madras (with an Erode WDM-2). The scheduled departure from Cochin harbor terminus was at 08:00 pm and arrived in Madras Central at 10.00 am. The reverse train departed Madras central at 16:00 am and arrived at Cochin harbor terminus at 06:00 am (similar to timings of present day Thiruvananthapuram -Chennai Express). It took much less time to reach Madras than the 19/20 mail (14 Hours vs 15 hours). Initially, the 41/42 express was to be extended to Thiruvananthapuram in 1978 but instead during 1979, the 19/20 mail was extended. The 19/20 mail is the predecessor of the now Thiruvananthapuram - Chennai Central Mail. The 41/42 Express became the Cochin Express after its name \\"The name Kerala Express\\" was taken over by 125/126 Trivandrum-New Delhi Express. The rake maintenance was done at Chennai central. The train formerly used to have passenger quotes like Ongole quota, Navjivan quota, Coromandel quota etc for long distance travel from madras central. In the 1980s the train got its stoppage removed from Coimbatore due to infrastructural constrains on the Irugur - CBE Line. By 1982, the timings of the train had been reversed. Departure from Cochin was moved to 04:05 pm and reached Madras at 06:50 in the morning. The reverse Train left Madras at 7:00 pm and arrived in Cochin at 10:00 am. === Extension to Alappuzha (1991 - present) === During 1991, the historic train bid goodbye to Cochin Terminus as it was extended to the newly inaugurated line to Alleppey. It was renumbered 6041/6042 in 1990. In 2004 the train was to be converted to Superfast express category numbered 2681/2682, but due to strong protests, the move was not implemented. It was again renumbered 16041/16042 in 2005.The Government of Kerala, in 2012, has officially asked an extension of this train to Vikram Sarabhai Terminal in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram but the demand was never Materialized and from 23rd Sep 2012, the train reentered Coimbatore junction, after nearly a gap of 30 long years after the double line via Irugur was commissioned.

It is a controversial law that has been described as draconian. It was feared that the law could be used to suppress dissenters against the government. The law has been used to sue and arrest journalists. ==History== Digital Security Act was adopted in October 2018. The provision passed the Parliament of Bangladesh in September 2018. The act was controversial as it would allow police officers to detain people without a warrant. The act was opposed by members of the media, the opposition Jatiya Party, and human rights organizations. The act was created using Section 57 of Information and Communication Technology Act, which was passed in 2006, as the model. The act was protested by the Editors' Council. The Daily Star has been critical of the application of the act, describing it as a gag on the free press. ==Cases== *On 14 April 2020, Journalist Golam Sarwar Pintu, of Dainik Bangladesher Alo, was arrested under Digital Security Act. *On 17 April 2020, Toufique Imrose Khalidi, editor of Bdnews24.com, and Mohiuddin Sarker, editor of Jagonews24.com, for publishing a report on the looting of relief materials in Thakurgaon District.

The case was filled by officer-in-charge of Ghorashal Police Station, Johirul Alam. *On 6 May 2020, 11 people were sued by the government of Bangladesh by Assistant Director, Abu Bakar Siddique, of unit 3 of Rapid Action Battalion. They included two journalist, one cartoonist, and one writer.

According to Amnesty International the act places \\"dangerous restrictions on freedom of expression\\". It believed the act will be used against dissidents, similar to the way Information and Communication Technology Act was used to detains hundreds of people. The act has been criticized by the United States as something that could be used to suppress free speech.

He was a first lieutenant in the civil guard and also a member of Copenhagen Fire Department. In 1809, his tenants were a master painter, a jeweler and a oldsmith who each lived there with their families and a maid. The property was in 1835 owned by L.

Founded in 1873, it is the oldest surviving polo club in Europe and the second oldest in the world. Its annual Varsity Match against Oxford, established in 1878, is the oldest continuing polo fixture in the world. ==History== The Varsity Polo Match, by Frank Dadd The club was founded in 1873 by the Hon John Fitzwilliam. Originally, the colours of the club were maroon and yellow and, after some discussions and the sanction of the Cambridge University Boat Club, the following rule was passed : \\"That the Polo Five be allowed to wear a light blue polo shirt, white forage cap, and belt\\". The first Inter-university match was held on the Bullingdon Cricket Ground in Cowley, on 27 November 1878. In 1879 the University players felt strong enough to enter a team in the Hurlingham Club's Champion Open Cup, the premier competition of the time. Although they were quickly defeated, the experience served them well and they returned later that year to defeat Oxford in the first Varsity Match. ==Varsity Match== leftThe match format is extremely uncommon as it is traditionally not handicapped. Teams are also mixed which is a rare opportunity amongst the Cambridge University Blues sports. The original conditions are as follows: \\"No player eligible who has been a member of his University for more than four years, or who has not been in residence during the term in which the match takes place. Instituted in 1878. Played generally at Hurlingham, in June.\\"Modern Polo, by E.D. Miller, London: Thacker and Co. 1896 p. 399. Currently, polo is a Discretionary Full Blue sport at Cambridge.

Boyce has worked with photographers Peter Lindbergh and Bettina Rheims in advertising campaigns for high fashion designers such as Giorgio Armani, Gianfranco Ferre and brands such as Levi's. He appeared on the covers of Arena Homme + and L'Uomo Vogue alongside a new generation of top male models of the 1990s, including Marcus Schenkenberg and Tyson Beckford, who attained celebrity status in the global fashion, movie, music, and media markets. In 1995, Out Magazine featured Boyce on its cover, photographed by Guy Aroch. The Out Magazine cover story lead the Los Angeles Times to single out Boyce and other notable figures such as Gore Vidal and Candace Gingrich as out leaders contributing to the increasingly vibrant market of the gay press that was notable for changing the landscape of mainstream media in the 1990s. ==Early life== Boyce was born in San Francisco, California of Italian and Irish ancestry. He moved to New York City, excelling in high school track and field, baseball and other sports before graduating from NYU with a degree in Communication Sciences in 1991. == Career == In 1993, Boyce was photographed by Steven Meisel on the October issue of L’Uomo Vogue with a style team that included Garren and Lori Goldstein. Boyce continued working in the fashion editorial pages of such magazines as British GQ, Interview, New York Times Magazine, Arena, Vogue Hommes, Details, and Italian Vogue as well as on the runway in fashion shows for Calvin Klein, Giorgio Armani, Issey Miyake, Gianfranco Ferre, and Donna Karan. In 1994, for the Autumn/Winter issue of Arena Homme +, a spin-off of the bi-monthly Arena, Boyce was photographed by master fashion photographer Albert Watson for the cover with four other top male models of the era, including Tyson Beckford and Marcus Schenkenberg. The two-page fold-out cover included the headline “High Five the New Supermodel Army - Tyson, Tim, Marcus, Gregg and Larry photographed by Albert Watson” and a quote by Boyce: “If I was a female supermodel I'd be Kate Moss – so I could be cute and tiny instead of big and ugly.” The magazine celebrated the five men, foretold their pop-cultural notoriety, and with Boyce's words quoted as a headline on the cover, signaled a skill that he would demonstrate later in life as a writer. The accompanying profile on Boyce stated that he had been modeling for just 18 months, was represented by Ford Models and Select Model Management, and included details on how he was discovered by fashion consultant Wayne Scot Lukas in New York where he attended NYU. Lukas asked Boyce to test for a Levi's commercial which launched his career. On the following pages, he is featured in ads for Gianfranco Ferre photographed by Bettina Rheims, Giorgio Armani Occhiali photographed by Peter Lindbergh, and in a fashion editorial photographed by Stephane Sednaoui with grooming by Michael Boadi. == Out Magazine Cover (1995) == In the midst of his career, Boyce was featured on the October 1995 cover of Out (magazine) with the headline: “Gay Model - Hanging Out with Supermodel Tim Boyce.” The cover was accompanied by an article titled, “‘This Model's Life...24 hours on the trail of male supermodel Tim Boyce” which covered aspects of Boyce's career, romantic life, and fitness regimen set against the streets of New York City. The article, which also charted the course of the male modeling industry from the 1970s, noted that another gay male model pulled out of being included in the article despite recent advancements made by female gay and bisexual models such as Jenny Shimizu, Rachel Williams and Patricia Velasquez who made it safer to come out with less risk to their careers. Three years after Boyce's public disclosure in Out Magazine, the nation's leading gay and lesbian media platform, he was mentioned in a 1998 article of another leading gay publication, The Advocate (LGBT magazine), that called out the fashion world for still not being a safe place for a gay model to come out and that being publicly gay was not perceived as an option. In 2018, the reluctance of male models to come out remained an issue among fashion industry leaders, when the editor of British Vogue, Edward Enninful, explained that the Hollywood ideal of the “perfect man” prevented many gay male models from discussing their sexual preferences, that doing so may hinder their careers. “It's like...this old notion of what it meant to be a man and that this perfect man couldn't be gay. We know that's wrong,” Enninful said, adding that more models are beginning to feel comfortable coming out, a sign that the fashion industry is progressing in a positive way. == Interview (1996) == For the September 1996 issue of Interview (magazine) which was founded by Andy Warhol, Boyce conducted a one-on-one interview with pioneering rock singer Pat Benatar, discussing the origins and legacy of her MTV era rock and roll image. Boyce joined Molly Haskell who interviewed Jeanne Moreau, Danny Glover who interviewed Harry Belafonte, and Mark Marvel who interviewed Joan Didion as a contributing writer of the magazine. == References == Category:People from San Francisco Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Gay models Category:Male models from California Category:New York University alumni Category:LGBT models ","title":"Tim Boyce"},{"id":"63922456","text":"Riisvangen Stadion (, \\"Riis Meadow\\") is an association football stadium in Aarhus N.

It then passes through the centre of the village of Langham where its course was re- routed in the 1920s to make more space available for burials in the parish churchyard. Upon leaving the village, it continues in an easterly direction before encircling the village of Ashwell where it then begins to flow towards the north-west. The construction of the Oakham Canal and the Syston and Peterborough Railway resulted in many modifications to the Langham Brook's course in the 19th century that can still be seen through this reach. It then flows underneath the Birmingham to Peterborough railway line halfway between Wymondham and Whissendine where for a short time it forms the county boundary between Rutland and Leicestershire. Soon thereafter, it picks up a small amount of flow from the Whissendine Brook and Somerby Brook before flowing through the grounds of Stapleford Park where it meets the River Eye. ==Status== For the purposes of monitoring under the Water Framework Directive, the Langham Brook is separated into two sections. The upper section, running from the source at Cold Overton to the confluence with the Whissendine Brook, had an overall classification of 'Moderate' when assessed in 2016.

The hill's summit (marked by a trig pillar) is above sea level. Not to be confused with the Burbage Rocks extension of Stanage Edge near Hathersage. Burbage Edge view from the east The boundary of the Peak District National Park runs along the ridge and across the summit. The ridge of Burbage Edge marks the western gritstone edge of the Derbyshire Dome, extending south as Axe Edge and to the north as Combs Moss. The ridge is the watershed between the River Goyt (Mersey river basin) and the River Wye (Trent river basin). To the west is Goyt's Moss moorland, the Cat and Fiddle Inn and the Upper Goyt Valley. Following the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, the area of the upper ridge and moorland were designated as \\"Open Access\\" land for the public. Coal was mined at Goyt's Moss colliery from the early 17th-century until 1893 when the coal deposits had been exhausted. The coal was initially extracted by surface mining, then in the 1700s using shallow shafts (with coal raised using hand winches) and later in the 1800s from deeper shafts using horse-drawn winding gins. Most of the coal produced was supplied to the Duke of Devonshire's limekilns at nearby Grin Low. The site of the colliery's remains is a protected Scheduled Monument. Burbage Edge is part of the Goyt Valley Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Heather is the main plant but the heathland is habitat for a variety of native grasses, rushes, sedges and shrubs including bilberry, crowberry, cowberry and cross-leaved heath. Hare’s-tail cottongrass and sphagnum moss are common. The area is important for upland breeding birds including a large population of golden plover, as well as red grouse, curlew, lapwing, whinchat, snipe, twite, ring ouzel and merlin. Disused railway tunnel through Burbage Edge The disused Cromford and High Peak Railway line (which connected the High Peak canal at Whaley Bridge with the River Derwent in Cromford since 1831) ran through a tunnel beneath Burbage Edge. This stretch of the railway line was closed in 1896. The Peak District Boundary Walk long distance footpath follows the disused railway line from Burbage Edge down to Errwood Reservoir. In October 1934 a De Havilland Moth plane crashed on Burbage Edge in heavy mist, while struggling with strong winds. The plane was en route from Broxbourne in Essex to Stanley Park at Blackpool. The ex-RAF pilot and passenger took half an hour to escape from the overturned wreck and walked to the Cat and Fiddle for help. In May 1943 an Airspeed Oxford RAF plane also crashed on Burbage Edge while on a solo circular night flight from Wheaton Aston. At dawn in low cloud, the plane hit the dry stone wall along the ridge of Burbage Edge. The pilot Sergeant John Wilson was killed by the impact. == References == Category:Mountains and hills of the Peak District Category:Mountains and hills of Derbyshire Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Derbyshire Category:Buxton ","title":"Burbage Edge"},{"id":"63922675","text":"Aristide William Lauw-Zecha (1899-1983), usually known as William Lauw-Zecha, was a Chinese-Indonesian plantation owner, businessman; and – as an alumnus of the class of 1923 of Iowa University – he was the first Indonesian to graduate from an American university. He belonged to the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family, part of the 'Cabang Atas' gentry of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and is the father of the hotelier Adrian Lauw-Zecha, founder of Aman Resorts.Hilditch, Tom. \\"Paradise Regained.\\" Asiaweek.com, 15 June 2001. ==Biography== Born in 1899 in Sukabumi, a hill station in the Preanger highlands of West Java, Lauw- Zecha was the son of Louis Tjeng Bie Lauw-Zecha, and a grandson of the landlord and bureaucrat Lauw Tek Lok, Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi by his Indo-Bohemian wife, Louisa Zecha. Lauw-Zecha's step-grandfather was Sim Keng Koen, the first Kapitein der Chinezen of Sukabumi. The posts of Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen were high-ranking civil government positions in the Dutch colonial bureaucracy. The Lauw-Sim-Zecha family held landed estates (particuliere landen) and plantations around Batavia and Sukabumi, and lived in a grand manner as Sukabumi's premier Chinese gentry family. Lauw-Zecha's own father, Louis, was the sole owner of the Soekaboemische Snelpersdrukkery, an office equipment and printing establishment, and had interests in tea and rice plantations, as well as export and import, including automobiles. From 1911 onwards, Louis Lauw-Zecha also became the official distributor of Parker Pens, an American pen manufacturer, in the Dutch East Indies. In 1920, Lauw- Zecha's father appointed an American professional, Edwin F. Lee, to act as associate manager of all his commercial interests in the Indies. This American connection continued when, in the late 1910s, William Lauw-Zecha attended Iowa University and, graduating in 1923, became the first Indonesian to acquire an American university degree. During his time there, he was active in the Chinese Students' Alliance of Eastern States, U. S. A., and was elected as its executive councillor. Upon returning to the Indies, Lauw-Zecha helped manage the family's landholdings, businesses and continued to act as the distributor of Parker Pens. Lauw-Zecha was married to Lim Kim See, a Malayan Chinese; together, the couple had five sons: Andrew, Allen, Adrian, Alwin and Austen Lauw-Zecha. As parents, the couple prioritised their sons' education, all of whom ended up pursuing their education, like their father, in the United States. Their fourth son Alwin, a Tufts alumnus of 1956, recalled his parents' comments: 'the only promise we are going to give you is that we will do our best to support you through the best formal education program that you each individually wish to pursue. Once you said you've had enough of studies, you are on your own.' The family's large landholdings and businesses survived the Japanese occupation during World War II and the Indonesian revolution of 1945–1950. In 1956, however, Sukarno, the first President of newly independent Indonesia, nationalised many of the country's private assets, forcing William Lauw-Zecha and many of his relatives to move overseas. Lauw-Zecha settled down in Malaysia, where his wife originated, and died on July 6, 1983 in Kuala Lumpur. ==References== Category:1899 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Lauw-Sim-Zecha family Category:Cabang Atas Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:Indonesian businesspeople Category:20th-century Indonesian businesspeople Category:Indonesian people of Czech descent Category:Indo people ","title":"William Lauw-Zecha"},{"id":"63922685","text":"Gerhard Ebert (born 20 September 1930 in Glauchau) is a German journalist, theatre scolar, theatre critic, and dramaturge. ==Life== After getting his Abitur (school qualification) and completing an apprenticeship as a typesetter, Ebert began theatre studies at the German Theatre Institute in Weimar in 1951.

It is a locally listed building. ==History== In the early 20th century Chingford Urban District Council was based at some aging council offices in Station Road. After civic leaders found that the council offices were inadequate for their needs, they elected to construct a purpose-built facility: the site selected on the Ridgeway had previously been open land. The building, which was designed by Frank Nash and H.T. Bonner in the Baroque style and built by William Griffiths, Sons & Cromwell, was completed in December 1929. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto the Ridgeway; the central section of three bays featured a portico flanked by Doric order columns on the ground floor; there was a balcony and a round headed window with stone surround on the first floor and the borough coat of arms and a pediment above; a clock and flagpole were erected at roof level. Internally, the principal rooms were the entrance hall with fine terrazzo flooring on the ground floor and the double-height council chamber with public gallery on the first floor. The building became the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Chingford after it was awarded municipal borough status in 1938. The town hall was extended by the addition a two-storey office block, designed by Tooley and Foster and built by Gray Conoley & Co. to the south west of the town hall. The new block, which became known as the \\"Chingford Municipal Offices\\", was officially opened by the mayor, Councillor J. A. Cooper, on 12 November 1960. The town hall ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Waltham Forest was formed in 1965.

New participants on the walk are traditionally 'bumped' on marker stones that record the route of the pipe. The tradition of the walk may date back to 1190 when Robert de Berkeley donated the water to the people of the parish. It has been called \\"the oldest observed custom of its kind\\". ==History== The church of St Mary Redcliffe is a grade 1 listed building, and although the earliest surviving fabric of the building dates back to the late 12th century, it is likely that these has been a church on the site since Saxon times. The area of Redcliffe is now part of the city of Bristol, however historically it was outside the city boundaries and a strong local rivalry developed between inhabitants of the two areas. Despite their close geographical locations the relatively deep River Avon, Bristol historically separated the two. St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol - brass drinking fountain with inscription Redcliffe was historically part of the manor of Bedminster, Bristol which was held by the Earls of Gloucester. However, Robert Fitzharding, the first feudal baron of Berkeley, Gloucestershire was able to purchase the land from Robert, 1st earl of Gloucester some time before his death in 1170.Sivier, David (2002). Anglo-Saxon and Norman Bristol. Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus. pp. 75–76. .Jones, Donald (2000). Bristol Past. Chichester: Phillimore. p. 5. . His descendent is named on a brass drinking fountain (installed in 1932) set into the south end of a wall that runs along Redcliffe Hill as the person who gave the water and conduit to the parish. The translated inscription reads - “For the health of the soul of Robert de Berkeley, who gave to God and the church of St. Mary Redcliffe and its ministers the Rugewell and conduit. AD 1190 Erected 1932. ELA Hertslet Vicar.” It is unclear when the tradition started but the present day walk follows the original route of the pipe in order to check for damage. The pipe may originally have been wooden, before being made of lead,Redcliffe Pipe Walk, Weston Daily Press – Wednesday 5 December 1928, pp 7 and finally being replaced by a metal pipe at an unknown time When the New Cut, Bristol was constructed between 1804 and 1809 the pipe was diverted to cross the cut via Bedminster Bridge. The present pipe runs under a railway line, and it is believed that in the early 20th century any group surveying the pipe had the power to stop trains to allow them to cross. A newspaper article from December 1928 records that at that time the water from the pipe was not suitable for drinking - \\"It regrettable to know that the old water supply has fallen on evil times. The fountain on the hill has ceased to provide thirsty travellers with a cool drink. Exactly what happens to the water no one seems to know. It still flows from the spring, we believe; its course through the old leaden pipes is still unimpeded, but somewhere, somehow its purity has become contaminated. The blame has been laid on the allotment holders; it has quite naturally been stoutly denied by these residents of Knowle, and business people under the shadow of the old church have been given the responsibility for closing down a supply which had been used for drinking purposes for 7OO years.\\" The pipe was damaged by a bomb in World War 2. The present day pipe is believed to end in Spring Street. ==Revival== It is not known for certain when the old tradition stopped, however it has been speculated that it was World War 1 that lead to this break. On Wednesday 5 December 1928 an article appeared in the 'Local Notes and News' section of the Western Daily Press, which quoted the following from on an article in the 'Redcliffe Parish Magazine' for December - \\"The editor, being something of upstart, and not before encountered this important piece of parochial observance, nor having heard it named, has somewhat irreverently given it a title reminiscent of the Cake Walk. By that he means no dishonour, for he is deeply conscious of the propriety and necessity of keeping up these old traditions. He begs to announce, therefor, that the Parish will walk the pipe— or rather, since that suggests walking the plank—will trace the pipe on December 8th. The origin of this custom is known all. By charter of the reign of John. Redcliff was given the water which flows from a certain spring at Knowle in order to maintain our just rights over the land through which runs the pipe which conveys this water, it necessary that from time to time we ' trace ' the pipe.\\" This quote suggests that the custom was not that well known, as the editor of the parish magazine had not previously heard of it, and may point to the fact that the title dates to this time. The unknown author of the article also then goes onto report on previous walks, which they remembered from their childhood - \\"One's memory goes back to a time when this was an annual Redcliff custom. It involved a good walk, a good lunch, and a game of rounders, which was a sore tax on the staying powers of stout members of the vestry.\\" An article from the Weston Daily Press on Monday 10 December reports on the walk that occurred on Saturday 8 DecemberRedcliffe Pipe - Bumping the New Vicar During the Walk, Weston Daily Press – Monday 10 December 1928, pp 9 -\\"Ancient tradition was upheld Saturday afternoon when the clergy, vestrymen, and parish official of St. Mary Redcliff, together with a number and parishioners others 'walked the pipe' accordance with old time custom\\". The article goes onto to report that the walk began at the Parish Hall on Guinea Street and followed the route of the pipe to its source. The walk crossed Bedminster Bridge and then moved into Victoria Park, Bristol \\"where the first marking stone was reached, and on which appropriately enough, the new vicar was the first to be 'bumped'...and at the various stones en route, which were pointed out by the guides, one or other of the party made similar acquaintance with these parish land marks.\\" The article records that the marker stones were engraved with \\"R.P\\", and that the route was preserved even \\"underneath the boundary wall and railings [of Victoria Park], and provision has been made for the iron bars to be unscrewed. This was not done on Saturday, but the Vicar announced that the formality would be complied with future occasions\\". Rights of way along the route closer to the source \\"has been protected by the erection of hedges\\". The article ends be recording \\"In olden days, according to the records, the end of the walk marked the commencement of much jollification, including feasting, while the athletic prowess of the \\"walkers\\" was tested with a game of rounders. In lieu of this out-of-date dissipation, om Saturday the company enjoyed a very acceptable cup of tea in the Athletic Association's pavilion, and watched the younger parishioners indulging in a game Rugby football.\\" right ==Present day== Today the walk occurs on a Saturday in late October each year. Walkers meet at St Barnabas’ Church in Knowle, before following the route of the pipe to St Mary Redcliffe, in an apparent reversal of the custom from previous years. The route takes participants through several private gardens, and the pipe can be inspected at a number of points, via manhole covers. There are several stone markers along the route, inscribed with 'SMP', which is apparently different from that which was recorded in 1928, which could suggest the stones have been replaced or re engraved since then. New participants continue to be 'bumped' on one of these stones in the park. The is a water maze in the park, installed by Wessex Water in 1984, whose design is based upon a carved boss in St Mary Redcliffe Church. Inscriptions around the maze record the history of the donation of the pipe. ==References== Category:Bristol ","title":"St Mary Redcliffe Pipe Walk"},{"id":"63923238","text":"Rhinolophus morio is a bat species of the family Rhinolophidae.

The Nujais Shrine is the mausoleum of a Roman family, and is one of the ruins that remains in the city of Amman, Jordan, and is located near Tabarbour, north of Amman, close to the old Roman road in the city of Jerash. It can be reached from the road via Sport City leading to the 'Ain Ghazal region. Johann Ludwig Burckhardt was one of the most prominent explorers that visited and described the site in 1812. It was also visited by Claude Reignier Conder and Dorothy, who pinpointed that the word \\"Nujais\\" comes from the word \\"najas\\" which was often used in the Ethiopian and Himyaritic Semitic language families to mean \\"governor's palace.\\" Conder mentions that this particular type of Roman mausoleum and shrine was designated for deceased Roman rulers and military commanders. The structure was planned to be built of square-shaped white limestone above a mound whose front facade rises about 1.2 meters. The building consists of a central, square room measuring 9.7 meters surrounded on all corners by a small room measuring 2.2 X 1.7 square meters. It is believed that this room was designated for burial and that it contained stone coffins that have not actually been found except for five remains. Part of their covers were scattered around the structure outside the building perhaps in order to benefit from those rooms. The building is covered with a dome, installed on spherical triangles in order to change the square into a circle. Oriental features were found atop the dome such as the \\"smooth jar,\\" which started to appear more frequently in the facades of Nabatean buildings in the city of Petra.

The river's water level varies with the seasons and the precipitation. == Geography == The main hydrographic slopes neighboring the \\"Amyot river\\" are: * north side: St. Lawrence River; * east side: Salvail River, Yamaska River; * south side: church stream, rivière des Hurons (Richelieu River); * west side: Richelieu River. The Amyot River takes its head water from agricultural streams draining the area east of the municipality of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu, south of Saint-Bernard-de-Michaudville and west of Saint-Jude, in 5th rang. The Saint- Denis-Saint-Bernard stream is the main head stream. The Amyot River first flows 2.7 km northwest in the forest, collecting the water from the Albert- Tourigny stream. The river then flows 4.2 km southwest in agricultural areas passing east of the village of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu to route 137; and 4.8 km south-west in agricultural zones almost parallel (on the east side) to the Richelieu River, up to its mouth. Atlas of Canada from the Department of Natural Resources Canada - Characteristics extracted from the geographic map, the database and site instrumentation - accessed on = May 11, 2020. The Amyot River flows on the east bank of the Richelieu River 1.1 km downstream from the village of Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu and 2.3 km upstream from the village of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu. == Toponymy == The toponym “Aymot river” evokes the memory of Pierre Amiot (also spelled Amyot), (Verchères, 1781 - Verchères, 1839), resulting from the marriage of Joseph Amyot and Archange Brousseau. Amyot was a member of the Surrey County from 1813 to 1830; and, after the reorganization of the county, he was a deputy for the Verchères county until 1838. In 1813, Pierre Amyot was captain in the militia division of Verchères. In 1827 he took part in an assembly which demanded the recall of Lord Dalhousie. The governor did not appreciate this gesture, dismissed him. He also served as commissioner for the censuses of 1825 and 1831. In 1837, he participated in the battle of Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu. His office as Small Claims Commissioner was then revoked and the government offered a reward for his arrest. Arrested and taken to Montreal, Pierre Amyot was released in July 1838. In his “Topographic description of the province of Lower Canada” (1815), Joseph Bouchette, the surveyor general of Lower Canada, noted this watercourse: “brook called Le Miot\\". The toponym \\"Rivière Amyot\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.Commission de toponymie du Québec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym \\"Amyot River\\". == See also == * Richelieu River, a stream * Saint- Charles-sur-Richelieu, a municipality * Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu, a municipality * La Vallée-du-Richelieu Regional County Municipality * List of rivers of Quebec == Notes and references == Category:Rivers of Montérégie Category:La Vallée-du-Richelieu Regional County Municipality ","title":"Amyot River"},{"id":"63923507","text":"Sigfrid Larsson (1 January 1882 - 9 October 1968) was a Swedish diver.

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The building was commissioned to replace an earlier town hall designed by John Knight in the Italianate style which was located at the corner of High Road and Ruckholt Road and which had been completed in 1882. After the area became an urban district in 1894, civic leaders decided that the old town hall was inadequate for their needs and decided to procure a larger building: they acquired some open land immediately to the north of the old building and converted the old building into a library. A design competition was held for the new building for which there were 30 entries. The new building, which was designed by John Johnson in an enriched Italianate style, was built by F J Coxhead and completed in 1895. It was officially opened by the Duke and Duchess of York on 18 March 1896. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with twelve bays facing onto High Road; the right-hand section of three bays featured a portico with Ionic order columns and finial above on the ground floor; there were three stone- lined niches flanked by pilasters extending from the first floor up to the second floor with a single decorative gable above; a timber and lead spire was erected at roof level. The design for the side elevation of the building, which consisted of six bays along Adelaide Street, was similar but with windows where the niches had been. Further along Adelaide Street, a two-storey technical institute block was erected as part of the complex. Internally, the principal rooms in the town hall were the great hall and the mayor's parlour on the first floor. The building was later described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"fussy but enjoyable, in an eclectic and enriched Italianate style\\". A series of sculptures of gods and goddesses designed by John Lawlor were placed at the top of the pilasters on the side elevation of the building. The building was extended to the south west by a side wing, from the back of the technical institute down to Ruckholt Road, in 1910; this extension, designed in a Baroque style, created additional offices on the ground floor and a council chamber on the first floor. The great hall was used for the showing of silent films in the pre-war years. The complex became the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Leyton when the area secured municipal borough status in 1927. An opportunity for further expansion came in September 1938 when Leyton Technical Institute amalgamated with Walthamstow Technical Institute to form the new South West Essex Technical College at Forest Road in Walthamstow: the council converted the area vacated by the technical institute to municipal use at that time. The complex ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Waltham Forest was formed in 1965. It was subsequently used as additional workspace by the council but, after being found surplus to requirements, it was sold to a developer, Lee Valley Estates, in 2006. The building benefited from an extensive programme of restoration works before re-opening as a business centre in 2010. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1895 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Leyton Town Hall"},{"id":"63923582","text":"Luis Nunes Vicente is an applied mathematician and optimizer who is known for his research work in Continuous Optimization and particularly in Derivative- Free Optimization.

It was started on May 3, 2020, when a member leaked chats from the group, including obscene images of around 15 girls. The controversy flared after several social media users led by Instagram user Niska Nagpal posted screenshots of the leaked chats and morphed photos of young girls on Instagram and Twitter. On Sunday, May 6, 2020 the hashtag #boyslockerroom was retweeted over 30,000 times. The Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights took notice of the issue and issued various notices to Instagram as well as Delhi Police for further information on the scandal. == Rape \\"Culture\\" in Schools == Members of the group, said to be Class 11 and 12 students from some of Delhi's top schools, posted photos of teenage girls without their consent along with offensive comments. A number of conversations purportedly showed members talking about sexually assaulting their classmates, and one specific instance where a member, \\"Sidharth\\" proposed the idea of gang-raping a particular underage girl. It was later revealed that this \\"Sidharth\\" was the girl herself. This sparked fury about existence of rape-culture & normalization of rape, misogyny and objectification in schools. According to social media accounts that posted the screenshots, members of \\"Bois Locker Room\\" threatened to leak nude photographs of the women who reported them. On May 4, 2020, another group was created by the name of ‘Bois Locker Room 2.0’, however it was shortly deleted. Nagpal had earlier also leaked chats from another Instagram group, called ‘Jai ka shirt skrt gang’, whose members were found to have talked about ‘raping girls’. == Manav Singh's Suicide == Manav Singh was a 17-year-old boy from Gurugram, who was studying in Class 12. He was accused by a girl (minor) of sexual assault on social media. This accusation surfaced as #BoisLockerRoom began trending all over Twitter and Instagram. According to the police, on May 4, 2020, the teenager jumped from the balcony of his flat located on the 11th floor of Carlton estate residential complex. Manav allegedly committed suicide after his friends began harassing him on social media platforms for being named in the girl's “MeToo” Instagram post. The girl alleged that she was molested by the teenager in the basement of her apartment complex two years ago. She wrote that she had revealed it now because she was tired of keeping it secret for the last two years. The police initiated an investigation under Section 174 to enquire and report on suicide as per the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). It was later discovered that the accuser had deleted her messages. The allegations were never substantiated as the victim never came forward. Manav Singh's parents moved application before Gurugram police seeking thorough investigation in the matter filed a complaint against the accuser. On June 7, 2020, Manav's father filed an application under section 156(3) in Gurgaon District and session court for monitoring of investigation. MM Gurgaon Court issue a notice to police for filing a Status Report. Police filed his status report, and on July 15, 2020, police issued a notice to Instagram and Snapchat for production of documents. MM Gurgaon Court ordered that a status report be filed regarding the case every 15 days until the filing of a final report. === Reaction to Manav's death === Manav Singh's death elicited mixed reactions. Rishi Singh, Manav Singh's brother, took to Instagram to claim that his brother was innocent. While defending his brother Manav, Rishi narrated the circumstances that compelled his brother to take such \\"drastic\\" steps. He urged that his brother should not be held guilty for a crime he did not commit. He also mentioned that the accusations made were of a different incident which was not related to the conversations in the 'Bois Locker Room' group chat. This incident was followed by opinions from several sources on how character assassinations on social media were not justified when a mob acts as a judge, jury and executioner.

After investigation, none of the 27 boys identified were found to be part of any conversation on Snapchat. As of May 11, 2020, the police had arrested the group administrator of the #BoisLockerRoom from Noida and apprehended a juvenile who was in the group and they had confiscated the mobile phones of all the suspects. Of the 27 boys, 24 had been examined, two were out of reach and the details of one more are awaited. == References == Category:Scandals in India Category:2020 crimes in India ","title":"Bois Locker Room"},{"id":"63924042","text":"Harish Shankar Harish Shankar (born 1984 in Malaysia) is a Malaysian-German conductor. == Life == Shankar was born in Malaysia.

He was a radical of the 1790s, and an abolitionist. Well- connected, he was a militia officer and magistrate, on close terms with the Whig aristocratic leaders and politicians of the north-east of England. ==Early life== He was born on 14 November 1761, the younger son of the physician John Fenwick of Morpeth. The family was Catholic, and Fenwick went to the College of St Omer for education. He then studied medicine at the University of Leyden. His Catholic faith did not last into adulthood. His background was brought up much later, in a by-election campaign of 1826 when the matter was topical, by George Silvertop speaking for Lord Howick. Fenwick received the M.D. degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1782 for his dissertation De Plethora. He was physician to the Newcastle Infirmary from 1786 to 1791. He then went into private practice in Durham city, from 1790. ==Local affairs, to 1815== Fenwick was one of a group of significant correspondents on political reform, centred on the moderate reformed Christopher Wyvill. In early 1794 he wrote to Wyvill, expressing confidence that universal suffrage had wide popular appeal, and optimistic about the troubles the administration had with disaffection. By 1797 he was much more downbeat about democratic reforms gaining traction, given the need to avoid fomenting revolution. An invasion scare in 1798 similarly damped down hopes of reformers. In 1798 Fenwick organised the Durham Volunteer Association. It raised an infantry body. The Peace of Amiens saw it broken up, but 1804, with the Napoleonic Wars resumed, saw the Durham Volunteers take its place. He was lieutenant-colonel of the Volunteers, resigning in 1806, in poor health. He became a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for County Durham. In 1807 at a Durham County Meeting, Fenwick opposed an address to the King, after the fall of the Ministry of All the Talents. The address was proposed by the Earl of Strathmore, and seconded by Matthew Russell. In return, Fenwick defended the bill (on Catholic emancipation) that by failing had ended the ministry. Supported by Ralph John Lambton and Sir Ralph Milbanke, two Members of Parliament, he waved a rival address that said as much, and Milbanke seconded him. He had also the support of Sir Thomas Liddell, 6th Baronet. The original address, however, was carried. Fenwick was a long-standing friend and political correspondent of Charles Grey, who as Prime Minister pushed through the Reform Bill 1832. The wait was a long one, and the Newcastle group of Fenwick, Charles William Bigge, Thomas Headlam and James Losh tired of Grey's tentative approach, by the 1810s.Peter Brett, Political Dinners in Early Nineteenth-Century Britain: Platform, Meeting Place and Battleground, History Vol. 81, No. 264 (October 1996), pp. 527–552, at p. 537. Published by: Wiley ==Local affairs, 1815–1830== After the Peterloo Massacre, Fenwick was one of a County Durham group calling for investigation, by asking the High Sheriff of Durham, William Keppel Barrington, to convene a meeting. John Davison, rector of Washington, addressed an open letter to Fenwick on the matter, the same year. It argued that public opinion was already revising its view of the event.Stephen C. Behrendt, Chapter 1 Peterloo, Ambivalence and Commemorative Culture, pp. 31–56, at p. 45. Edinburgh University Press On the other hand the Peterloo issue and polarisation around it played an important part in the 1820 general election in , particularly in the hands of John George Lambton—\\"Radical Jack\\"—who became the Earl of Durham; Fenwick was his good friend. In 1822 the campaign of Thomas Joplin, from Newcastle, against the monopoly of the Bank of England, gained support in County Durham. Fenwick was one of the local group calling for Joplin's banking theories to be given attention. It included also George Barrington who was rector of Sedgefield, and the landowner Edward Shipperdson.\\"Economist\\", An illustration of Mr. Joplin's views on currency, and plan for its improvement: together with observations applicable to the present state of the money-market ; in a series of letters (1825) Fenwick was a Vice-President of the Newcastle Society for Promoting the gradual Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Dominions. The national Anti-Slavery Society ran campaigns to end British slavery in 1823 and 1826, in which James Losh and Fenwick spoke at local meetings. Fenwick spoke at an emancipation meeting in 1826, in the Durham Town Hall, with others, including Shipperdson. ==Later life== In 1834, Fenwick chaired the meeting at which the Surtees Society was formed. Shipperdson, Fenwick and William Nicholas Darnell, rector of Stanhope, made up the Society's initial committee. Fenwick died at home, on 11 January 1855, in the North Bailey, Durham, aged 93. He was buried in Durham Cathedral, on 17 January. ==Works== * Dissertatio Medica Inauguralis, De Plethora (1782) * Calcareous Manures: Electric Fluids in Vegetation (1798), two essays.

He selected Jack Miller to serve as head of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, and Willens became Second Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division.The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza They hired more lawyers to handle several investigations of Hoffa that were already underway in the Justice Department based on information collected by the McClellan Committee and the FBI. These investigations resulted in several indictments against Hoffa and his affiliates.Some of It Was Fun: Working with RFK and LBJ’’ Nicholas Katzenbach, 2008, p. 98In Hoffa's Shadow: A Stepfather, a Disappearance in Detroit, and My Search for the Truth’’ Jack Goldsmith, Farrar, Strauss and Giroux (2019). When Justice Department lawyers learned that Hoffa attempted to tamper with the jury in one of those cases, Robert Kennedy sent Willens to Tennessee to handle the Government's response. Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering in 1964 and sentenced to eight years in prison. When Hoffa appealed his conviction to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, Willens represented the Government and obtained an order affirming the conviction in 1965.U.S. v. Hoffa 349 F.2d 20 (6th Cir. 1965) ==Warren Commission== On November 29, 1963, one week after President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed a seven-member commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren to conduct the federal government's investigation. Willens participated in early meetings inside the Justice Department concerning the law-enforcement response to the assassination. On December 5, he obtained one of the few copies of the FBI's preliminary report identifying Lee Harvey Oswald as the likely assassin, and prepared a summary noting critical errors in the FBI's work.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 27-28 On December 17, Willens was assigned by Nicholas Katzenbach to join the staff of the Warren Commission, reporting to the chief counsel, Lee Rankin. Willens worked full-time on the commission's investigation until its report was issued on September 24, 1964. In the early days, his work focused on hiring lawyers and investigators; gathering and reviewing the records collected by the FBI and local police concerning the assassination; and preparing a rough outline of topics to be investigated and reported to the commission. Willens personally recruited several lawyers to join the staff, including Arlen Specter.Some of It Was Fun: Working with RFK and LBJ’’ Nicholas Katzenbach, 2008, p. 135Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 37-39 Rankin assigned a team of two lawyers to each of the major areas for investigation. Willens observed the first meeting of the newly hired staff January 13, 1964, and reported: “The lawyers were enthusiastic about their assignments, eager to get to work, and determined to ferret out whatever conspiracy might have led to the assassination and the murder of Oswald.”Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 43-45 Rankin assigned Willens to coordinate the work of the investigative teams and to assist their communication with other agencies. Willens worked closely with Norman Redlich to monitor the progress of the teams and edit their interim reports. He also acted as a liaison between the Commission and the Justice Department, providing frequent informal updates to Miller and Katzenbach.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 46, 84 Willens reports in his book that the commission's attorneys knew from the beginning of the investigation that the FBI had made serious errors in its initial report of the assassination.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, p. 28 As the investigation continued, it became clear that the FBI was withholding important information about Oswald. Among other things, the FBI misled the Commission concerning its surveillance of Oswald in Dallas and New Orleans before the assassination, and failed to disclose Oswald's encounter with FBI Agent James Hosty. Further, in an act of “inexcusable dishonesty,” Hoover concealed from the commission his own decision to discipline Hosty and 16 other FBI agents for their failure to identify Oswald as a security risk and to inform the Secret Service before the president's arrival in Dallas.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 79, 119, 155 Willens notes that later investigations examined the hidden FBI evidence “and no facts have come to light that challenge our fundamental conclusions regarding the identity of the assassin and the absence of any conspiracy.”Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, p. 294 From the outset of the investigation, the commission's lawyers believed that evidence of a conspiracy was most likely to be found in Mexico, where Oswald traveled in September 1963. In April 1964, Willens went to Mexico to meet with FBI and CIA agents and to speak to witnesses concerning Oswald's interactions with Soviet and Cuban personnel in Mexico City. The agents indicated that Oswald's activities in Mexico were limited to efforts to obtain visas for travel through Cuba to the Soviet Union, and no evidence suggested that his visit was related to President Kennedy.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 121-27, 134 In his book, Willens describes the genesis of the single-bullet theory in informal meetings of the commission attorneys as they tried to determine the number of bullets fired at the presidential car and who was hit by each bullet. One attorney, David Belin, focused his efforts on trying to prove that a second shooter had participated in the assassination, but detailed work by the FBI and analysis of the Zapruder film suggested that all of the shots that hit President Kennedy and Governor Connally originated from Oswald's position in the book depository. Based on that work, the staff lawyers decided to test the hypotheses that the first bullet to hit the president also caused Connally's wounds.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 85-87 Over the objection of the FBI and Secret Service, they organized a reenactment of the shooting in Dallas on May 24, 1964. The reenactment “produced convincing evidence” supporting the single-bullet theory, and that evidence was confirmed by expert review of the medical and ballistics evidence.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 166-68 However, because Gov. Connally testified that he was hit by the second bullet – not the first bullet that hit the president – the Commission decided not to take a position on the single-bullet theory. Instead, the Commission concluded that “there is no question” that all of the shots were fired from the sixth floor of the book depository.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 270 At Warren's request, Willens prepared a draft outline of the commission's report on March 31, 1964. Thereafter, Willens, Redlich and Rankin shared the work of reviewing and editing each section of the report. Willens writes that their goal was to present the facts “in a way that would persuade readers that our investigation was sufficiently thorough that the conclusion finding no credible evidence of a conspiracy was a fair and reasonable one.”Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 108, 210, 249 The Commission delivered the report to the president on September 24, 1964, and released it to the public on September 27.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 288 ==President Johnson’s Crime Commission== In August 1965, Willens left the Department of Justice to serve as executive director of the President's Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 298 On December 31, 1966, the Commission released a 1,041-page report that recommended a series of reforms to address rapidly rising crime rates in the District, including gun control legislation, reorganization of the police department, speedier handling of criminal cases and changes to bail laws. The commission noted that the District's low-income community faced unemployment, racial segregation, poor education and vocational training, all of which contributed to crime. Report of the President’s Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia, U.S. Government Printing Office (1966) ==1968 Democratic National Convention== Willens was a member of the delegation representing the District of Columbia at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 1968.District of Columbia Board of Elections, Election Law in the District of Columbia and a History of District of Columbia Elections, pp. 41-44 (1971) Members of the delegation were originally pledged to Robert F. Kennedy, but Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968. Following his death, the delegation voted to nominate Rev. Channing E. Phillips, a Baptist minister and activist who was the leader of the delegation. Rev. Phillips became the first African-American to be nominated for president by a major party. ==Private Practice== In 1967, Willens joined the law firm then known as Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Washington, D.C. His major clients included the Ford Motor Company, Educational Testing Service and the Northern Mariana Islands. He retired from the law firm in 1995.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 303Records and Briefs of the United States Supreme Court ==Northern Mariana Islands== Beginning in December 1972, Willens represented the Marianas Political Status Commission in negotiations with the United States. The negotiations resulted in an agreement in 1976 entitled the “Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America.”An Honorable Accord, The Covenant between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, Willens & Siemer, Center for Pacific Islands Studies, School of Hawaiian, Asian, and Pacific Studies, University of Hawaii (2002), p. xiii As Willens stated, when President Ford signed legislation adopting the Covenant on March 24, 1976, “[t]he fourteen thousand citizens of the Marianas had successfully exercised their right of self-determination. Against all odds, they accomplished what no people preceding them had ever done – they joined the United States voluntarily on terms they had negotiated and approved.”Willens & Siemer, An Honorable Accord, p. 343 Working with his colleague and co-author, Deanne C. Siemer, Willens served as counsel for the First Constitutional Convention from 1976 to 1977. The resulting constitution has been in effect in the Northern Mariana Islands since January 1978.Willens & Siemer, An Honorable Accord, p. xiii Thereafter, Willens and Siemer represented the Commonwealth in a series of legal challenges to key provisions of the Covenant. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands v. U.S., 670 F. Supp.2d 65 (D.D.C., 2009)U.S. ex Rel. Richards v. De Leon Guerrero, 4 F.3d 749 (9th Cir. 1993) ==Later career== After leaving Wilmer Cutler in 1995, Willens published three books concerning American foreign policy in the Pacific and the efforts of the people of the Northern Marianas to join the United States. Willens and Siemer engaged in a five-year legal battle with the U.S. Department of Justice to obtain documents under the Freedom of Information Act, resulting in the disclosure of approximately 70,000 pages of internal agency records.Willens v. National Sec. Council, 726 F. Supp. 325 (D.D.C., 1989) Based on these records and other sources, Willens and Siemer wrote National Security and Self-Determination: United States Policy in Micronesia, 1961-72 (2000) and An Honorable Accord, The Covenant between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States (2002). With Dirk Ballendorf, Willens wrote The Secret Guam Study: How President Ford’s Approval of Commonwealth Was Blocked by Federal Officials in 2005. For the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination, Willens wrote History Will Prove Us Right in 2013. The book is based in part on contemporaneous journals and correspondence that had not been previously disclosed. In later years, Willens participated in lectures and panel discussions concerning the assassination, subsequent investigations and conspiracy theories.“Decades Later, Yale Law School Graduates Remember Investigation into JFK’s Assassination,” Yale Law Report, Dec. 2019, pp. 46-49“Conflicting Conclusions: The Government Assassination Investigations,’ The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, Oct. 29, 2018. ==Publications== *Willens & Siemer, National Security and Self-Determination: United States Policy in Micronesia, 1961–72, ABC-CLIO, 2000.National Security and Self- Determination *Willens & Siemer, An Honorable Accord, The Covenant between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, University of Hawaii Press, 2002.An Honorable Accord *Willens & Ballendorf, The Secret Guam Study: How President Ford's 1975 Approval of Commonwealth was Blocked by Federal Officials, University of Guam Press, 2005.The Secret Guam Study *Willens, History Will Prove Us Right: Inside the Warren Commission Report on the Assassination of John F.

He played college football at Auburn. == Early life and Auburn == Hastings was born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas where he graduated from Pulaski Academy. He played high school football, and during his time the school won two state titles and in his senior year in 2015 he racked up 2,040 receiving yards. Hastings was only the 2nd receiver in Arkansas football history to gain over 2000 yards in a single season. At Pulaski Academy Hastings also played soccer and was an all state selection 2 years in a row. In his early teens he played elite soccer traveling over a 3 state area and was the only U-14 player chosen out of the state of Arkansas for the Region 3 Olympic Development Team. He participated in the National Olympic Development Team Tryouts in Orlando Florida. Hastings walked on at Auburn as a kicker, specializing in onside kicks, but in 2017 he was moved to wide receiver. At Auburn Hastings was teammates with quarterback Jarrett Stidham. Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn said of Hastings: \\"He's one of the quickest guys I've ever coached. I think he can get open versus any man. I think he's in a good spot. I think he'll have a chance to play at the next level. I couldn't be more proud.\\" In the 2017 season, Hastings had 26 receptions, 525 yards and four touchdowns, but he missed the 2018 season due to a torn ACL, and in 2019 he had 19 catches for 222 yards and one touchdown. == Professional career == Hastings was one of four undrafted free agent receivers signed by the New England Patriots after they did not draft any receivers in the 2020 NFL Draft.

The book was the first in his Chandos thriller series and is narrated in the first person by Richard Chandos. In addition to Chandos and his servant Bell, the novel features a cast of characters who recur in many of the later books: George Hanbury and Jonathan Mansel; their respective servants Rowley and Carson; and Tester the Sealyham terrier. Mansel's character also appears as Jonah Mansel in the author's 'Berry' series of comic books and short stories, though he is not written for comic effect in this nor the later 'Chandos' books. == Plot == Richard Chandos, the story's narrator, witnesses a murder and takes over the victim's Alsatian dog. On the dog's collar his friend Jonathan Mansel finds an inscription telling of treasure hidden within a well in the Austrian castle of Wagensburg. Chandos, Mansel, and their friend George Hanbury set out to recover it, accompanied by their servants, Bell, Rowley and Carson. They become trapped underground and attacked by enemies, led by 'Rose' Noble, but ultimately escape with the treasure. == Background == Blind Corner was Mercer's first foray into the thriller genre, having found himself bored with writing romantic fiction. He wanted to write something \\"worthier of a real author\\" along the lines of Bulldog Drummond or The Thirty- Nine Steps. He took as his pattern Treasure Island, and the book owes much to Robert Louis Stevenson. A non-comic thriller was a departure for the author, and neither The Windsor Magazine nor Ward Lock, the publisher of his other books, were interested. The novel was ultimately published by Hodder and Stoughton in the UK in January 1927. An abridged version of the story, under the title The Treasure of the Well, was published in Short Stories magazine in its USA edition of 25 July 1927, and in its UK edition of mid-December 1927. Along with the other seven Yates books originally published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton, Blind Corner was re-issued by Ward Lock during World War Two. == Critical reception == Blind Corner was well-reviewed, did well, and made the author's reputation with a new reading public. The original dustjacket included the following quotes - *Daily News: \\"'Blind Corner' is by far the best story of Dornford Yates that I have read. It is an excellent story.\\" *Times: \\"There is not a dull page in the book.\\" *Morning Post: \\"A racy, swift-moving story of adventure. In every way a thoroughly enjoyable yarn.\\" *Spectator: \\"To all lovers of a hunt for buried treasure, 'Blind Corner' by Dornford Yates, will be very welcome, for it is a first-rate yarn spun with style and gusto.\\" In his 1982 biography of Dornford Yates, AJ Smithers suggested that Blind Corner was the best adventure story of the inter-war years. He found the writing to be fine indeed, the description of the fight in the dark exciting, and the tension built up during the tunnelling operations even more so. Richard Usborne in Clubland Heroes (1974) noted that in this and the other Chandos books the author makes use of prose that, while still stylish, tends more to pomp and pageantry than that of the Berry books, a style perhaps suited to Chandos, the solemn and humourless man who is supposed to be writing them. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:1927 British novels Category:Hodder & Stoughton books Category:Novels by Dornford Yates Category:Thriller novels ","title":"Blind Corner (novel)"},{"id":"63924356","text":"The Hunting Towers–Potomac Yard–Crystal City Line, designated as Route 11P, or Route 9B, was a bus route that was operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority between Hunting Towers in Huntington, Virginia, and Crystal City station of the Yellow and Blue lines of the Washington Metro. This line provides service from Hunting Towers in the City of City of Alexandria to Crystal City in Arlington County. Trips are roughly 25 minutes between intervals. ==History== The Hunting Towers–Potomac Yard–Crystal City Line was used two times throughout the years, although both the 11P and 9B have its original lines. ===Route 11P=== Route 11P was part of the Mount Vernon Line, along with Routes 11H and 11X since 1987.Washington Post, Changes Announced in Virginia Metrobus Routes, Schedules, January 15, 1987, page 11 The 11P operates through the neighborhood of Mount Vernon in Fairfax County. In the mid-1990s, route 11P was later part of the Alexandria-National Airport Line The 11P operates between Hunting Towers and Crystal City, via National Airport during weekday rush hours. Route 11P was later transferred to Hunting Towers-Potomac Yard-Crystal City Line on March 12, 2001. The 11P was rerouted to serve Potomac Yard Center via Jefferson Davis Highway (now Richmond Highway), but no longer operates through Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 11P began operating on full weekday service following these changes. The route remains unchanged until September 26, 2004, when route 11P and route 9B merged into a single route, and being transferred to the Richmond Highway Line. ===Route 9B=== Route 9B was once part of the Fort Belvoir Line, which operated alongside with Route 9A, 9C, and 9D. In the early 2000s, the line was renamed as the Richmond Highway Line, alongside with the introduction of route 9E. At some point in mid-2005, the line was renamed as Huntington- Potomac Yard-Pentagon Line. The 9B follows the same schedule as the former 11P, operating during weekdays. On June 26, 2005, route 9B splits from the Huntington-Potomac Yard-Pentagon Line to be renamed as the Hunting Towers- Potomac Yard-Crystal City Line. Following these changes, the name of the line was brought back in service, as the 9B being the sole route of the Line. ===March 2001 changes=== On March 12, 2001, the 11P was rerouted to operate via Potomac Yard Center. Service to National Airport was discontinued. The 11P also started to operate during weekday off-peak hours. ===September 2004 changes=== On September 26, 2004, the 11P was renamed to route 9B, and is transferred to the Richmond Highway Line. The line is discontinued following the merger of the 11P and the 9B. The schedules of the bus remains the same. ===June 2005 changes=== On June 26, 2005, the 9B splits from the Huntington- Potomac Yard-Pentagon Line, bringing back the Hunting Towers-Potomac Yard- Crystal City Line in service. No schedule changes occurred in the 9B. ===Discontinuation of service=== On June 25, 2006, route 9B was discontinued, to clear up bus bunching in the Huntington-Pentagon Line (routes 9A and 9E). A new route from Alexandria's DASH, introduced route AT10 on the same day. The DASH AT10 route serves as an alternate travel of the 9B in the city of Alexandria, while routes 9A snd 9E continues to serve on Jefferson Davis Highway, and routes 23A and 23C of the McLean–Crystal City Line serves through Crystal City.

The IBTS Greenhouse, together with the programme for the afforestation of desert lands in Egypt, became part of relocation strategies. These play a crucial role in Egypt as urbanization of the Nile Delta is a problem for the agricultural sector and because of infrastructural problems like traffic congestion in Cairo. The IBTS relies on a new quality of systems integration including architectural, technological and natural elements. It combines food production and residence, as well as desalination of sea water, or brackish groundwater. A CAE demonstration project using real weather-, soil and economic conditions proved feasibility under hyperarid conditions. The relevance of the IBTS is its water desalination methodology with an efficiency of 0.45kwh per cubic metre of distillate. Desalination, as one of the most important key-technologies of the 21st century, has thus become financially and ecologically viable for large scale agriculture, forestry and aquaculture. The building has its roots in construction engineering and construction physics in contrast to food production as it is for most greenhouses. It is fundamentally different from the seawater greenhouses. Much more so it differs for its performance (see below) in desalination. Without exception, alternative desalination- technologies, air-to-water utilities and desalination-greenhouses in testing, require a multiple (up to 200x) of the energy for fresh-water production, as is the current efficiency record in the industry. The significance of the term Integration lies within the efficiency that only systems integration can achieve. Particular importance lies on the imitation of natural systems, especially closed cycles. The establishment of closed watercycles being the most crucial of all, because of the increasing severeness of the Global Water crisis particularly in hot desert climates. The desalination feature in the current version is bound to hot climates because it requires high amounts of solar thermal power. It has turned out to be very suitable in mitigation of the sinking of water tables in agricultural areas of the MENA region and beyond. In future versions the IBTS can be deployed in cold climates using extra heat energy sources like from compact fusion, or small modular reactors. == Performance == The energy of operation is 0.45 kWh per cubic metre of distilled water in the full scale version. This performance is more than 10 times lower than the records set by desalination plants in Dubai and Perth according to official numbers given by the respective authorities. The IBTS is based on a modular concept, with a core size of 1 hectare. This is the minimum size for the construction and for self-sufficiency, but the circular, architectural modules can be built 10 hectare large, or more. Each module is based on sub-modules allowing for immediate commencement of operation and generation of profit (like a reafforestation site generating profit in its early stages). Best efficiency and full capacity can be provided with a superstructure approximately 100 modules large. 10 km² have the capacity of an industrial desalination plant, which is 0,5 million cubic meters of water per day. Since the first version of the IBTS the atmospheric water generation has evolved through a series of wikt:hygrothermal models and can now be operated at 0.45 kwh/m³ according to the developer. The IBTS works with natural processes in closed cycles, hosted in a building. Therefore it never hits natural, or physical limitations for growth like the desalination technology in the Persian Gulf already has because of brine discharge and temperature rise.“Status of Coral Reefs of the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea region”Dr. Christophe-Tourenq, “Conservation of Coral Reefs in the Persian Gulf” == Primary energy == Important for understanding the performance of the IBTS is the fact that it is operated with electrical and thermal energy produced from windpower and concentrated solar power, on-site (in a proprietary process). This means that the energy requirement and the use of primary energy can be considered the same, which is not the case for common desalination plants. Common desalination plants are dependent on power-plants using fossil fuels. Accounting for energy-loss during the energy transformation in the power- plant, common desalination plants use 2-3 times more energy than stated in the usual performance data. These are common factors for energy-conversion losses for the combustion engines used in the desalination industry. Taking this into account the IBTS uses less than 5% of the current efficiency world-record, which about 3.5kWh/m³ plus ca. 1.0kWh/m³ for seawater pumping and other factors not accounted for. This is multiplied with the efficiency of primary energy use. Together 9-14 kWh/m³. See primary energy The economic reality behind these numbers looks even worse for common desalination plants (in Life- cycle assessments) because energy-loss occurs during many stages Upstream (petroleum industry), like drilling, transportation or the manufacturing of required machines. Some of this does not have to be considered for solar- power, because it is free and infinite. Relevant for solar-power is only \\"power installation per investment unit\\" not the efficiency of primary energy use. The term of primary energy should be combined with energy quality for realistic understanding. Energy quality in context of desalination shows a new picture for the overall efficiency not only of the physical process of desalination, but the overall economic efficiency of the IBTS using proprietary renewable energy. == Economic implications == Weighted GDP Because of the independence of primary energy- and material resources, the efficiency of water production and the scalable, modular design the IBTS Greenhouse is a blueprint for a new economy which is sustainable. A strategic, national infrastructure project like the IBTS allows for the successful energy- transition into a sustainable economy. This can be understood by a comparison of GDP growth, the generation of real values and a weihted GDP. An example for the infrastructure services of the IBTS Greenhouse is water purification. Wastewater is percolated into the ground and provides water and nutrients for the growth of trees. This is not so easy with food crops for hygenic reasons. Thus the IBTS provides sewage treatment in countries, or areas that lack treatment plants Another economic impact is that the IBTS Greenhouse is not steering down a dead end road like technologies based on fossil fuels and centralized production which created \\"stranded assets\\" according to leading economic analyst Jeremy Rifkin. The IBTS Greenhouse is an open concept compatible with most other technologies and practices for water- energy- and food production. It is also \\"future-ready\\" for upcoming technologies like nuclear power from compact fusion, the traveling wave reactor, or breeder reactors. When these energy sources become available they can be plugged into existing IBTS infrastructure and generate even more fresh water without brine discharge into natural water bodies and the appending environmental problems. The manufacturing process of the IBTS is designed for automation, which requires more electricity than common construction sites, or manufacturing processes. This platform design is also future ready for more available energy. An example is the large roof of the IBTS, which needs to be observed and cleaned continuously and refurbished several times over the lifecycle of the IBTS. This can only be done by special bots, or drones on the scale that the IBTS was developed for as national desert greening strategy for reclaiming and regreening entire regions. ==Examples of other Biotecture== The most famous example is the Biosphere 2, a research project and demonstration site integrating residential areas into a new type of greenhouse. It was designed to be self-sufficient including food production in an ecosystemic context. Another example for Biotecture, which is foremost a residential home, is an Earthship. Earthships incorporate water-purification and reuse on multiple levels. Since 2010 urban developments labeled Forest Cities, drawing from the IBTS and other pioneer projects have been created. The Gardens by the Bay using all of the core design elements of the TSPC Forest City from 2008 like artificial trees with spherical buildings on top is an outstanding example. The Liuzhou Forest City is one of many examples for green architecture, respectively green urban developments of new cities with a lot of green areas, including the facades of buildings. The international efforts to create Forest Cities are another level of implication. China is going forward with the introduction of several hundred designated Forest Cities.. One of the latest examples is Shenzhen ==See also== *Systems engineering *Earth systems engineering and management *Life support system - Natural systems *Closed ecological system *Environmental management *Industrial ecology *Multidisciplinary approach ==References== ==External links== * Systems with Integrated Water Desalination for Arid areas based on Solar Energy by M.Thameur.

She raised the status of nurses as part of the British nursing history. She had them established as students during training and established State Enrolled Nurses as not just \\"assistant nurses\\". ==Life== Bentley was born in 63 Portland Court on Great Portland Street, London in 1915. Her parents were John and Charlotte and her father worked as a hosier. She began to work at the Royal Free Hospital in London. She was training to be a nurse, but the training was frequently work. She rose to lead the British Student Nurses' Association and she successfully campaigned to have trainee nurses to be called students until they passed their state registration exams and became SRNs State Registered Nurses. She moved from the teaching hospital to join Lambeth General Hospital as a sister in charge in 1948. By this time the 1943 Nurses' Act had been passed and a new type of nurse a \\"State Enrolled Nurse (SEN)\\" was now recognised. These nurses were seen as second class nurses whereas Bentley saw them as more practical versions and not so theoretical as a State Registered Nurse. Bentley was elected to lead the \\"National Association of State Enrolled Assistant Nurses\\" as General Secretary despite being a SRN rather than a SEN nurse. Her first years wage had to be met bu an appeal to members as she resolved conflicts between hospital managers and the undervalued SEN nurses. Her organisation organised holidays for nurses irrespective of their qualification. Bentley worked with Irene Ward who was a member of parliament for Tynemouth and a private member's bill, the \\"Nurses (Amendment) Act, 1961\\", passed through parliament to remove the demeaning \\"assistant\\" from the SEN's job title. In 1973 the Royal College of Nursing set up a joint committee with the Royal College of General Practitioners to try and improve understanding in their professions. The committee consisted of a secretary, four doctors (all men) and five women who were all nurses.

In 1921 it was incorporated, along with other businesses, as José Arechabala S.A., which subsequently launched Havana Club rum. ==Biography== José Arechabala was born on 9 November 1847 in Gordexola in the Spanish province of Biscay. He was the sixth son of a baker, whose family had been established in the village for centuries. He left his home town and traveled to Cuba when he was 15, seeking better opportunities. He traveled aboard the Hermosa de Trasmiera, a three-masted topsail frigate licensed in Santander, Spain, and took over the role of chief cook on the voyage after the original cook was injured during a storm at sea. Upon landing in Cuba in 1862, he was introduced to Antonio Galíndez, a distant relative who was a businessman involved in sugar production and trade businessman in the Matanzas Province. Arechabala later went to work for Galíndez. In 1869 he started working for Casa Bea, a hardware, banking and ship consignment company owned by the politician and industrialist Julián de Zulueta, who later became the Mayor (Alcalde) of Havana. In 1873, he was appointed the sole agent of Zulueta's business ventures in Cárdenas. In 1874, Arechabala married Carmen Hurtado de Mendoza y García, with whom he would have five children. In 1878, he founded a distillery, La Vizcaya, where he started producing rum and other spirits, using the leftover molasses from the flourishing Cuban sugar industry. The business prospered, and was able to survive the hurricane that struck Cárdenas in 1888; the damages at the time exceeded $50,000. At the beginning of the 20th century, the factory in Cárdenas already had access to the railway and had been expanded to include several boilers and distillation columns, while the company's businesses expanded to include sugar refineries, jam factories, shipyards and fuel production plants. At the same time, the company dedicated significant efforts to social improvements in Cárdenas, which included contributing to the paving of streets, providing scholarships for local young people and employees' children, and building a theater. In 1919 he was named Hijo Adoptivo (adopted son) of Cárdenas. In 1921, La Vizcaya and various other companies owned by Arechabala were incorporated under the name of José Arechabala S.A. and the founder was named its chairman. Arechabala died the morning of 15 March 1923, just a few minutes after starting the shift at work and having sent his offspring to the plant saying \\"¡A trabajar muchachos, ha sonado el pito!\\" ('To work lads, the whistle has sounded!'). His son-in-law (and nephew) José Arechabala Sainz took over the company after his death, but was killed in September 1924. José Arechabala S.A. launched Havana Club rum in 1934, months after Prohibition ended in the United States in December 1933, and continued its production until the company was nationalized by the Cuban revolution on 31 December 1959. ==References== Category:Spanish emigrants to Cuba Category:Cuban businesspeople Category:Drink distillers Category:People from Biscay Category:1847 births Category:1923 deaths Category:20th-century Spanish businesspeople Category:19th-century Spanish businesspeople ","title":"José Arechabala"},{"id":"63924843","text":"Rabia Küsmüş is a Turkish karateka.

In 2009, Don Aucoin of The Boston Globe listed it alongside Boesman and Lena (1969) and \\"Master Harold\\"...and the Boys (1982) as one of the plays in which Fugard \\"unforgettably dramatized the soul-warping costs, for oppressor as well as victim, of [apartheid].\\" Nancy Sasso dubbed it a \\"heavy but important\\" work in Patch. Tim Leininger of Journal Inquirer argued, \\"Though the root plot of 'Aloes' is profound, there is a lot of cumbersome subplot dragging what could have been a taught [sic] 90-minute play into 2 hours of sometimes lagging melodrama. [...] Fugard’s allegorical intent is understood with the aloe, but it runs on way too long and Gladys’ trauma does not have a fulfilling conclusion and feels rather superfluous.\\" The reviewer still described the play as \\"thought-provoking\\". In 2014, Misha Berson of The Seattle Times said that \\"Fugard here masterfully observes political realities through the magnified lens of deep personal relationships.\\" The critic described the play as \\"[w]ordy, occasionally didactic, but rippling with charged emotion and insight\\". In 2018, Marcus Crowder of the San Francisco Chronicle billed A Lesson from Aloes as \\"subtle yet shattering\\", stating that the play \\"slowly simmers for most of its absorbing two hours before brilliantly boiling over and sadly coming to rest.\\" Crowder argued, \\"The two men’s joyous initial expressions of kinship and brotherhood deftly set up all that follows. Fugard places issues of trust and loyalty in the foreground in front of the looming specter of the harsh governing white minority forcing the characters into grim consolations.\\" Conversely, Arifa Akbar of The Guardian gave a 2019 Finborough Theatre performance three out of five stars, writing, \\"It is a powerful piece that reflects on how political fear and mistrust can taint individual lives, marriages and friendships, though the emotional pitch is raised early on by the actors and flattens any greater nuance or psychological subtext between them. The play is also heavy on exposition in the first part while its political messages become too pronounced in the second.\\" Henry Hitchings gave the same rating in Evening Standard, as did Tom Wicker of Time Out. The latter critic praised the second half as gripping, but stated that \\"the first half of ‘A Lesson of Aloes’ is too long, with quote-heavy speeches stretching out a story that only kicks into gear later.

They began when excessive rains began falling in March, leading to massive flooding and landslides. They caused more than 430 deaths, notably in Kenya and Rwanda. In the fall another round of floods hit the African Sahel. ==Impact by country== ===Rwanda=== Heavy rain, lighting and thunderstorms affected the country between 2 and 4 March, causing 5 fatalities, with floods reported in Kigali and Southern provinces. Two people died in flooding in Ruhango district, Southern Province and one person in Gasabo District, Kigali Province. One person also died as a result of lightning strikes in Rulindo district, Northern Province and another one in Nyanza District, Southern Province. A total of 13 people were injured and 42 houses destroyed. Roads and bridges were also damaged or destroyed. On 7 March 5 people died after heavy rain caused a river to overflow and flood a cave in Nyamagabe district in Southern Province. In April, 6 people died after heavy rain triggered landslides in Gicumbi district in Northern Province. The worst affected areas are Nyankenke and Kageyo Sectors. Property, infrastructure and livestock have all been damaged or destroyed. Authorities urged residents in high-risk zones to relocate to safer areas. Heavy rain also affected parts of Eastern province 19 and 20 April where media said at least 3 people had died in separate flood incidents in Gatsibo district. Flooding has also caused damage to crops in the district. Heavy rain across the country from 1 to 3 May caused severe damages and 8 fatalities. 70 people have died in floods and landslides after torrential rain. The Byimana weather station in Ruhango District recorded 140 mm of rainfall in 24 hours on 7 May. The rain and floods also destroyed 91 houses, 5 bridges, and washed away crops. ===Kenya=== 237 people have died in flooding in Kenya in April and May while over 100,000 have been displaced. Flooding has affected 29 of the country's 47 counties. Wide areas of land are under water in Busia and Siaya counties, western Kenya, after the Nzoia river overflowed. More than 800,000 Kenyans in 161,000 households have been adversely affected by the effects of the ongoing heavy rains. ===Somalia=== Heavy rain has affected wide areas of Somalia from 20 April, causing rivers to rise and flash flooding.

Tak was the son of a steward in Middelburg, where, after failing law school in 1878, he started writing foreign reviews for the Middelburgsche Courant. He was friends with Floor Wibaut, who like him was a member of the Sociëteit Sint-Joris. Both Middelburgers moved to the capital, Branch in 1882. There he wrote for De Amsterdammer and De Nieuwe Gids. From the latter he took over the financial management of Frank van der Goes. After an argument he started his own literary magazine, De Kroniek (The Chronicle). Pieter Lodewijk Tak, by Jan Veth Branch was initially left-liberal, supporter of Treub. In 1899 he became a member of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (\\"Sociaal-Democratische Arbeiderspartij\\" / SDAP), and started working for Het Volk. He became editor- in-chief of the socialist party newspaper in 1903, after the party board had removed Pieter Jelles Troelstra from this position. In 1905 Tak fired the journalist Jacob Israël de Haan after the publication of his novel Pijpelijntjes. The homosexual tendency in the book was not acceptable to Tak. He did, however, advocate women's rights. From 1905 until his early death he was also party leader, member of parliament for the constituency of Franeker, member of the Provincial Council and member of the city council of Amsterdam. P.L. Tak founded the housing association De Dageraad (The Dawn Council) in 1901. This corporation named a complex of houses in Amsterdam-Zuid in the 1920s after its founder. This housing complex is famous for its beautiful architecture in the style of the Amsterdam School. He died in 1907 during a holiday on the Duinvliet estate near Domburg of a heart failure. == Literature == * Gilles W. Borrie: Pieter Lodewijk Tak (1848-1907), Journalist en politicus.

The quinolizidine alkaloids serve for plants as chemical defences. They have various effects on warm-blooded animals and lead to poisoning of grazing livestock (sheep and cattle). Cytisin and anagyrin are particularly responsible for this. The effects of poisoning are stimulation, coordination disorders , shortness of breath, cramps and finally death from respiratory paralysis. Anagyrin acts teratogenic.

One prototype was built and by 1929 a new factory was ready for its production but this did not follow. ==Design and development== Rear cockpit The two seat Air Boss was one of many 1920s small U.S. biplanes powered by the aged but cheap and readily available war-surplus Curtiss OX-5. It was first flown near the start of the Great Depression and only the prototype was completed. It was a single bay biplane with pairs of parallel interplane struts between the spars. The lower wings were mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and the upper centre section was held by a cabane formed by pairs of inverted, longitudianal, V-struts to the forward spars and single struts to the rear spars. The wings were both of blunted rectangular plan and had the same chord (), though the upper span was about 5% greater. All leading edges were plywood-covered. Only the lower wings were fitted with ailerons, which were full span and of the Frise type. One advantage of this arrangement was that the control column to aileron connection was very short. The V-8 OX-5 was nose-mounted with its radiator, equipped with shutters, underneath it. The fuselage was a chrome-molybdenum steel tube structure with the pupil's open cockpit over the wing and the instructor's close behind but with a much better all-round view. Both cockpits had windscreens and streamlined headrests and dual controls were fitted. The tail was conventional, with a tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and braced to the fin, which carried an angular rudder. Both fin and tailplane were in-flight adjustable. The mainwheels of the Air Boss were on a split axle providing a track of . There was a long, spring steel tailskid. The Air Boss prototype was designed by Glenn E. Messer in about 1927 and built by Messer Aeronautical Industries Inc. The date of its first flight is not known but in 1928 Messer founded the Southern Aircraft Co. of Birmingham, Alabama. By mid-1929 they occupied a newly built factory there, complete with construction jigs ready for production, but there is no record of any production aircraft. ==Specifications== ==References== Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Biplanes Category:1920s United States civil trainer aircraft ","title":"Southern Air Boss"},{"id":"63925376","text":"Ludmila Armata (born 1954) is a Polish-born painter who lives and works in Quebec.

The company has the distinction of being the oldest surviving Tramway Company in the UK, as the original corporation still operates the funicular today. Built in just 6 months between January and August 1881, the Tramway opened on Monday 1 August becoming the 3rd such cliff railway to operate in the borough. The distinctive burgundy and cream carriages travel up and down the track between the bottom station on Foreshore Road, next to the beach and tourist arcades, and the top station on Marine Parade, close to the town centre. Central Tramway Company, Scarborough. June 2019. View of the top station, Grand carriage and tracks. ==History== ===Origin=== Scarborough developed from a fishing town into a busy Spa Town and tourist resort through the 18th and 19th centuries, thanks in part to the discovery of the acidic water running into the South Bay by Thomasin Farrer in the 17th century. Visitors were drawn to the town for the health benefits of both the spa water and the therapeutic benefits of the sea air and fresh water swimming. Entertainment soon followed, and The Spa, Scarborough developed into a popular centre for music and performance. The development of the railway line and central station in 1845 bought a modest increase in the number of wealthy visitors to the area. The Grand Hotel (Scarborough) was a lavish addition to the Scarborough landscape. Completed in 1867 to much fanfare it was heralded as one of the biggest hotels in the world and one of the first giant purpose built hotels in Europe. (It was famously saved from the German bombs in the Second World War because Hitler selected it as a future home and base after the war). Scarborough's topography was such that many of the newly developed hotels were located atop the steep cliff that made up the area's natural coastline. The Spa, beach and entertainment were to be found at the bottom of the hill, a long and arduous walk made more challenging by the clothing of the period. The first cliff railway to be built in Great Britain was the South Cliff Tramway (now called the Spa Cliff Lift), Scarborough in 1875, and the first of five Scarborough funiculars to be built between 1875 and 1930. The Scarborough South Cliff Tramway Company Limited was created in 1873 to link the hotels of the South Cliff Esplanade with the panoramic South Bay beach and entertainment venue of the Spa. A group of local business owners, led by Mr Hunt of the nearby Prince of Wales Hotel, joined together to form the company with a starting capital of £4,500 from shares sold in the company. It opened on 6 July 1875, eventually costing £8000 and was an instant success with 1,400 passengers travelling on the day of opening. The project was perhaps inspired by the development of a counterbalance railway on a steep stretch of the Pickering to Whitby railway line (now part of the North Yorkshire Moors Railway ) between nearby Goatland and Grosmont. Too steep to be pulled by the horses, a system was designed using a descending wheeled water tank similar to those used in the slate quarries of North Wales from the late 18th century onwards. The success of the South Cliff Tramway Company inspired another funicular to be developed in 1878 on the North Bay. The Queens Parade Cliff Lift unfortunately did not enjoy the same good fortune with a series of accidents and issues with erosion on this particular stretch of coastline. Eventually being closed for good in 1887. Two further cliff railways were subsequently constructed in Scarborough; the St Nicholas Cliff Lift in 1929 and the North Cliff Lift in 1930. Central Tramway and the Spa Cliff Lift are the only lifts still operating in Scarborough today. John Woodall Woodall was a successful businessman in Scarborough during this time. A Fellow of the Royal Society, a banker, marine biologist, benefactor and 4 times mayor of Scarborough, Woodall had a distinguished background as well as owning large areas of Scarborough. His family home was St Nicholas House (now the Town Hall) prominently located over-looking the South Bay and the newly built Grand Hotel. John Woodall Woodall was to be the first Chairman of the Central Tramway Company registering the corporation in January 1881. The company followed the financial model of the South Cliff Tramway Company with £10,000 worth of shares (2,000 of £5 shares) being sold to individuals, including Robert Laughton of the Victoria Hotel, father of the actor Charles Laughton. ===Construction=== John Woodall Woodall owned the land that the Central Tramway was to be built on and arrangements had to be made for a small photographic studio to be relocated into the new station building. George Wood of Hull was the contractor, Charles Augustus Bury the architect and Thomas Feaster Morgan the chief engineer. The track gauge is with a length of . The iron track was constructed on a lattice girder framework carried on iron columns. The original top station designed by Charles Augustus Bury, who also designed the Unitarian Church on Westborough, originally contained a spacious waiting room reached by a passage between two shops, with the photographic studio located above. The railway was originally Steam powered so construction also included an engine house located from the top station beneath the tracks. The original plans reveal the smoke flue that was constructed from the engine house for the purpose of allowing the smoke from the burning coal to be expelled away from the top station. The flue ran underground to the nearby Granby House, the home of 18th century historian Thomas Hinderwell. Although the top station today has the same footprint as the original building, the bottom station was originally a larger building approximately in length. This was later reduced when the Foreshore Road was widened after 1949. Central Tramway Company, Scarborough with the Grand Hotel visible in the background. May 2019. The mechanism in the engine house was unique and used a colliery type indicator and chalk marks on the winch to inform the winding engineer when the cars had arrived at the station. This meant that the winding engineer did not have a view of the track. This type of steam operation was unique at the time. The South Cliff Tramway of 1875 was originally operated by a hydraulic water balance system with sea water being pumped initially by two Crossley gas engines, later replaced by coal powered steam pumps in 1879. The short-lived Queen's Parade Lift of 1878 used a similar water balance system with steam powering the water pumps. ===Operations=== At 12.30 pm on 1 August 1881 the Central Tramway Company Ltd opened to the public for the first time with the first passenger-carrying ascent and descent of the carriages. The Scarborough Mercury at the time reported that the opening was 1 month later than anticipated. According to the company log book 2,834 passengers travelled on the first day. A letter from the station manager to the Directors dated 5 August tells that it was a fortunate coincidence that the opening day fell on the Bank Holiday and in consequence was a very busy day. He wrote ‘I'm happy to be able to report that the working was satisfactory and the staff appointed proved sufficient’. The first journey was taken by Chairman John Woodall Woodall along with several investors and directors of the company including GM Porter, A Lupton and ZT Wellburn; the architect Charles Augustus Bury; G Dippie the town clerk and Rev. J Benn. According to the Scarborough Mercury the group travelled from the top station down to the bottom station, alighted briefly before returning to the top station where Woodall Woodall addressed the gathered crowd. The steam operation continued into the early 20th century with one notable incident. On 24 October 1908, Percy Henry Askham was delivering coal for the steam engine. The coal shoot was accessible from the tracks and according to the coroner's report the driver did not see Mr Askham working on the track, setting the carriages in motion. As the Tram moved down the tracks Mr Askham was knocked backwards into the coal shed. He died later in hospital. In 1920 the Tramway was converted to electric power making use of the road tram system that had been constructed in 1904 around Scarborough. The Scarborough Tramways Company was formed in 1902 by Scarborough Corporation. Over the proceeding 2 years the company built a 5-mile system of tracks around the streets of Scarborough. The Central Tramway Company made use of the electricity power system constructed by the main contractor, Edmundson Electrical Corporation, which operated from the main power station on Seamer Road. The new electric winding gear ran off the 500v Direct current power of the road tram system from 1920 until the road trams eventually closed in 1931. Between 1931 and 1932 Hudswell Clarke and Company of Leeds converted the system to AC power with the installation of a new 60 horse power motor underneath the top station, during this time they also relaid the track, and rebuilt the carriage frames with new wooden carriages being supplied by Plaxtons. Further changes occurred during the second half of the 20th century. In 1967 a solid reinforced concrete foundation was laid under the track (still visible today), with the exception of the top . In 1975 a significant fire at the Olympia Amusement site damaged one of the carriages and tracks. Two new aluminium carriages were supplied by George Neville Truck Equipment of Kirkby in Ashfield. The future of the Tramway was further put in jeopardy in 1976 when pile driving at the new Olympia Amusement site caused cracking and damage to the concrete foundation supporting the track. The Tramway did not operate for a full year, while repairs were made. The company took the contractors to court and won full compensation for the remedial work and all consequential losses. In 2009 the company installed a fully automated drive system, with a new 60 horse power electric motor with the objective of enabling a smooth acceleration and deceleration into and out of the stations. This automation took away dependency on manual driving, and consequently improved the safe operation of the facility. In 2016, the Company installed a new hydraulic disc brake, manufactured by Twiflex Ltd. Between 2012 and 2020 the Central Tramway underwent a significant refurbishment of the interior and exterior of the Station buildings. These works were based on a report commissioned by the company from local architects, Denton and Denton in 2011. The report recommended the company make more of the many Victorian period features still in operation. Scarborough Civic Society Heritage Blue Plaque marking Central Tramway as the oldest surviving Tramway Company in the UK The result was a return to the burgundy and cream livery and the installation of several distinctive features, these included large murals on the upper and bottom station walls, the clock tower and stained glass panels above the driver's booth. In July 2012, The Mayor of the Borough of Scarborough, Councillor Helen Mallory unveiled a Scarborough Civic Society Heritage Blue plaque to acknowledge the contribution of the Central Tramway to Scarborough's social and industrial heritage. This can now be seen above the entrance to the café at the top station ==Engineering== The Central Tramway is a funicular railway, the principle of which is that two carriages are permanently attached to each other by means of steel hauling ropes, or cables. As one carriage ascends, the other carriage will descend. The two tracks run between the top station on Marine Parade, and the bottom station on Foreshore Road. Each track is 248 feet or 75m long. The 2 carriages are named Grand and Olympia for operational and engineering purposes. Each carriage is constructed from an aluminium outer shell on a steel frame. The triangular base frame is similar to those of the water balance railways but does not contain the water tank beneath the carriage. Access to both carriages is via sliding doors on the ends. At Central Tramway 4 hauling cables are attached to the two carriages, these are special high strength, compacted cables, each one 19 mm in diameter, with a breaking strength of 32 tonnes, therefore the four cables are capable of carrying 128 tonnes. The two carriages, can carry up to 20 passengers seated and 10 standing, and when fully loaded each can weigh up to 8 tonnes, or 16 tonnes in total, well within the capacity of the 128 tonne breaking strength. The sheave wheel, gear box and motor located in the machine room below the top station. May 2019. The driver sits in the booth at the top station with full sight of both carriages (CCTV screens also allow full view of the bottom and top stations where passengers alight and disembark). The system is powered by a 60 horse power electric motor, the motor drives a David Brown 17 inch gear- box, which then rotates the 7 ft diameter main pulley or sheave wheel. Gravity aids in the movement of the carriages making the Tramway very energy efficient. In 2019 a new Programmable logic controller drive system was installed by Wheelsets UK in preparation for the 2020 season. The new system uses the latest in computer technology to monitor and control the movement of the carriages with comprehensive integrated safety systems to improve the smooth and safe running of the railway. New digital control panels allow clear and concise information to be relayed to the driver. A new hydraulic disc brake mounted on the main sheave wheel was installed in January 2020. ==Health and safety== The regulatory body responsible for the oversight of funicular railways in the UK is HM Inspectorate of Mines (HMIM), a division of the Health and Safety Executive. The HMIM hold meetings twice per annum with all funicular operators as part of their supervisory activities, and pay periodic visits to all the funiculars. Central Tramway complies with the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (LOLER), and is inspected every six months to guarantee compliance. == References == == External links == * Central Tramway Official Website * Heritage Railway Association * Funimag: Funicular Web Magazine Category:Buildings and structures in Scarborough, North Yorkshire Category:Transport in North Yorkshire Category:Funicular railways in the United Kingdom Category:Railway lines opened in 1881 Category:Scarborough, North Yorkshire ","title":"Central Tramway Company, Scarborough"},{"id":"63925660","text":"McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case which ruled that, as pertaining to the Major Crimes Act, much of the eastern portion of the state of Oklahoma remains as Native American lands of the prior Indian reservations of the Five Civilized Tribes, never disestablished by Congress as part of the Oklahoma Enabling Act of 1906. McGirt was related to Sharp v. Murphy, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), heard in the 2018–19 term on the same question but which was believed to be deadlocked due to Justice Neil Gorsuch's recusal; Gorsuch recused because he had prior judicial oversight of the case. Sharp was decided per curiam alongside McGirt. ==Background== The former reservations of the Five Civilized Tribes in dispute in this case Prior to its statehood in 1907, about half of the land in Oklahoma in the east, including the Tulsa metro area today, had belonged to the Five Civilized Tribes. There had been several decades of warfare and conflict during the 19th century over these lands between the Native Americans and the United States, including the Trail of Tears. By 1906, the United States Congress passed the Oklahoma Enabling Act, which had been taken to disestablish the reservations, and enabling Oklahoma's statehood. The former reservation lands, those of the Five Civilized Tribes as well as the other tribes in the state, were allocated into areas by tribe that were given suzerainty governing rights to the tribe to handle internal matters for Native Americans within the boundaries, but otherwise the state retained jurisdiction for non-Native Americans and for all other purposes such as law enforcement and prosecution. In Sharp v. Murphy, Patrick Murphy, a descendant of the Native Americans, admitted to committing murder in the state of Oklahoma, and was subsequently tried by the state courts around 2015. During these trials, Murphy argued that the language of the Oklahoma Enabling Act did not specify that the Native American reservations were disestablished, and because he had committed the murder within the Muscogee reservation territory, that his crime was subject to federal jurisdiction and not state under the Major Crimes Act. This argument was rejected by the state and on its first appeal within the federal courts, but at the Tenth Circuit in 2017, the court found in favor of Murphy's argument that the Enabling Act did fail to disestablish the territories, and thus Murphy should have been prosecuted by the federal courts. The state petitioned to the Supreme Court in 2018, which accepted to hear the case. However, as Justice Neil Gorsuch was part of the Tenth Circuit panel that heard the case on appeal, he recused himself from all hearings on the case. Because only eight Justices heard the case, it remained unresolved at the end the of 2018–2019 term; the Court had stated plans to hold another hearing on the case in the 2019–20 term but had not set a date. Many court analysts believed the case to be deadlocked due to Gorsuch's recusal. ==Statements of the case== Jimcy McGirt had been tried and convicted of performing sex crimes against an underage child in 1996 in Oklahoma, and was serving a life sentence for the crime. When the Tenth Circuit delivered its verdict on Murphy's case in 2017, McGirt was one of several convicts who had similar cases to Murphy's, Native American descendants that had been tried and convicted in state courts for crimes committed on lands that were part of the former reservations, who sought appeals based on the new ruling from the Tenth Circuit after the state denied him relief. The Supreme Court granted McGirt's petition in December 2019. ==Supreme Court== McGirt was one of a dozen cases in which the Supreme Court opted to use teleconferencing for oral arguments for the first time in the court's history due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The arguments for McGirt were heard on May 11, 2020. Observers to the court stated that some justices raised concerns of how ruling in favor of McGirt, in recognizing that the reservations were never disestablished, would impact not only existing convicted prisoners within the state but how the federal courts would subsequently need to handle approximately 8,000 felonies that occur annually on those lands, as well as the impact on legal matters related to businesses and other civil actions that would fall under tribal regulations rather than the state's. Attention was given to the stance of Justice Gorsuch, who appeared to doubt Oklahoma's argument that the lands were effectively disestablished. Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that should the Court find in favor of McGirt, ruling that the reservations were never formally disestablished, Congress would be able to easily remedy the situation with legislation to affirm the disestablishment. The Court issued its decision on McGirt as well as a per curiam decision on Sharp following the basis of McGirt on July 9, 2020. The 5–4 majority opinion was written by Justice Neil Gorsuch and joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, and determined that for purposes of the Major Crimes Act, Congress had failed to disestablish the Indian reservations and thus those lands should be treated as \\"Indian country\\". Gorsuch wrote, \\"Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word.\\" Gorsuch further assessed that disestablishment was a power only Congress could exercise, affirmed by Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock. He wrote \\"Under our Constitution, States have no authority to reduce federal reservations lying within their borders. Just imagine if they did. A State could encroach on the tribal boundaries or legal rights Congress provided, and, with enough time and patience, nullify the promises made in the name of the United States. That would be at odds with the Constitution, which entrusts Congress with the authority to regulate commerce with Native Americans, and directs that federal treaties and statutes are the 'supreme Law of the Land'.\\" Gorsuch wrote further on the impact of this decision, \\"In reaching our conclusion about what the law demands of us today, we do not pretend to foretell the future and we proceed well aware of the potential for cost and conflict around jurisdictional boundaries, especially ones that have gone unappreciated for so long. But it is unclear why pessimism should rule the day. With the passage of time, Oklahoma and its Tribes have proven they can work successfully together as partners.\\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a dissent which was joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, as well as in part by Clarence Thomas. Roberts wrote that the majority decision \\"creates significant uncertainty for the State's continuing authority over any area that touches Indian affairs, ranging from zoning and taxation to family and environmental law.\\" The Court's judgment reversed McGirt's denial for relief by the Oklahoma criminal court, which potentially would withdraw the state convictions and prosecute him anew in federal courts. ==Impact== The decision by the Supreme Court was seen as a significant win for Native American rights, which have generally been denied by courts in recent years. Gorsuch's opinion was seen to acknowledge that many of the promises that Congress had made to the Native Americans in turning over reservations have gone unfulfilled, and rejected the argument presented by the state and federal government that he summarized as: \\"Yes, promises were made, but the price of keeping them has become too great, so now we should just cast a blind eye.\\" The Supreme Court's decision directly impacts Native American tribal citizens that are currently convicted under state law for crimes committed on the former reservation lands, as well as for any future descendants that may be arrested for similar crimes covered by the Major Crimes Acts, as their prosecution would become a matter of the federal courts and not the state. At the time, about 1,900 of the prisoners in the Oklahoma system met these conditions, but only around 10% qualified for rehearings to transfer to the federal system as they were still within the statute of limitations. The majority decision left open other potential impacts between territorial rights that may arise, which the Court put to the state and the tribes to resolve amicably should conflicts occur. Roberts had cautioned in his dissent that this could stretch to include taxation, adoption, and environment regulation rights. Lawyers for the tribal groups asserted that the decision was narrow in affecting only Native American descendants within the lands as no land ownership changed hands. The state and the five tribes issued a joint statement after the decision, stating \\"The nations and the state are committed to implementing a framework of shared jurisdiction that will preserve sovereign interests and rights to self-government while affirming jurisdictional understandings, procedures, laws, and regulations that support public safety, our economy, and private property rights. We will continue our work, confident that we can accomplish more together than any of us could alone.\\" Gorsuch siding with the four more liberal Justices in McGirt was seen to be a continuation of his textualist interpretation of the law, first presented in his majority decision related to LGBTQ and employment discrimination in Bostock v. Clayton County.Bostock v. Clayton County, . Whereas Chief Justice Roberts had sided with Gorsuch and the majority in Bostock as a textualist statutory interpretation of the law supported the legal precedent that Roberts had tended to support, the textualist position in Bostock put Gorsuch at odds with Roberts' precedent in McGirt, and reflects potential conflicts that may arise between the two Justices in future cases. ==See also== *Aboriginal title in the United States *Former Indian reservations in Oklahoma *Indian country jurisdiction *Native American reservation politics *Off-reservation trust land *Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Area *Tribal sovereignty in the United States ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 in United States case law Category:United States federal Indian policy Category:United States Native American criminal jurisdiction case law Category:United States Native American treaty case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court ","title":"McGirt v.

As a result, most scholars believe that Philodoppides was active during the 7th century B.C. although some have argued for a date as late as the late 6th century B.C. It is difficult to characterise Philodoppides' genre: although he seems to have primarily produced short Greek lyric poetry, his Heleneis (which seems to have been his most significant work) was a relatively short work in the epic genre, taking its themes from Homeric epic poetry. ==Poetry== Philodoppides is believed to have written a Heleneis (an account of the fall and subsequent pillage of Troy, written from Helen's perspective); otherwise, he seems to have written primarily on lyric themes such as love poetry. The Heleneis was known to Callimachus, and recorded in an entry of the Pinakes (Callimachus frr. 439-40 Pfeiffer); however, none of the poem itself survives from antiquity. An example of Philodoppides' works in fragmentary form is the following: By the Hellenistic Period, Philodoppides was considered an inferior lyric poet by the Alexandrian scholars Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace, who excluded him from their canonical nine. Philodoppides' works are sometimes referenced in the Scholia to Homeric epic: Furthermore, it seems that the project of writing epic poetry from Helen's perspective was considered immoral by the Roman Imperial period: the Suda preserves a reference to τὰ πονηρὰ μέλη τοῦ Φιλοδοππίδου περὶ τῆς Ἑλένης ('the immoral verses of Philodoppides concerning Helen'), which it attributes to Philostratus. However, it has been argued that Quintus Smyrnaeus drew inspiration from Philodoppides in his Posthomerica, book 13 of which describes the sack of Troy and the recapture of Helen. This implies that Philodoppides was not exclusively seen as an immoral and inferior poet in the Imperial period. Philodoppides' work was barely known by the early Renaissance: Martin of Arles suggests that the Heleneis depicted an example of innominabile malum maleficae nominatae quae in antiquis aevis non solum vivebant sed etiam florescebant ('the unnameable evil of those witches by name, who not only lived but actually thrived in the ancient world'). However, given that Philodoppides' poetry had already fallen into disfavour by the Hellenistic period, it is widely considered unlikely that any of his poetry survived as late as the Renaissance: only the title of the Heleneis would have been known by this point. ==References== ==Sources== * . * . * . * . * . * .

She has two younger brothers. Stroud grew up in public housing in Baltimore, Maryland, in a woman-headed household. At Eastern High School in the late 1960s, Stroud and a few girls founded an underground student activist group called the Black Voice to protest institutionalized racism in her majority white school. This time period marked the beginning of Stroud's activist life, as well as her first experiences with police brutality at the age of seventeen. The members of the Black Voice were forcibly arrested for their role in organizing what became a large-scale student strike of local schools. Stroud was given the option to receive her high school diploma only if she apologized for her activism. She refused, and later earned a GED. In her latter high school years, Stroud became involved with Baltimore's Soul School and the Black Panther Party, which she went on to join. She was a member of the Party from 1970-1973, working in several chapters, including Washington, D.C. She married John Wesley Stevens, also a Party member, and they took the names Nkenge and Patrice Touré. They had two daughters, Trina Stevens and Kianga Stroud. ==Career== When many of the members of the D.C. Black Panthers chapter went to California to work on the mayoral and City Council campaigns of Bobby Seale and Elaine Brown in 1973, Touré and her husband stayed behind in D.C. They founded Save the People (STP) and ran the Education for Liberation Bookstore on 9th and H. Save The People was asked to sell The Black Panther, the Party's newspaper in the party's absence as well as continue providing free meals, health care, and education to the community. In 1974 she became the second Black woman to join the staff of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. Touré worked at the Center for thirteen years, serving as General Administrator and Director of Community Education. She wrote anti- sexual assault curricula for students, spoke widely, worked on their rape crisis hotline, and appeared regularly in the media. She pioneered DC's Anti- Rape Week and Coalition for a Hassle Free Zone, an anti-street harassment campaign. Nkenge and Patrice Touré were divorced in 1979. Touré was one of the co-founders of the Women's Section of the National Black United Front, defending women's rights within Black Nationalist politics and ensuring their issues were represented. In 1982, Touré co-founded the International Council of African Women (ICAW) with Loretta Ross to prepare a delegation of American women to attend the 1985 United Nations Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya. ICAW was the primary source providing information, support, and encouragement to African American women to organize delegations and attend the \\"Herstoric\\" conference. She was President of the D.C. Chapter of the National Black Women's Health Project (now Black Women's Health Imperative) from 1987-1994. Since 1990 she has been working with women substance abusers, women living with HIV/AIDS, women and children residing in transitional housing, and babies born with HIV. Touré has been a weekend volunteer and served on the board of My Sister's Place, a shelter for battered women and their children, and on the board of the National Center for Human Rights Education. She has been active with SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective. ==Media presence== Since leaving the D.C. Rape Crisis Center in 1988 until 2018, Touré had hosted her own weekly radio show, \\"In Our Voices,\\" which served as a platform for the voices and issues of women on D.C. radio station WPFW. She and guests discussed issues from the perspective that any issue is a women's issue. Also at WPFW, Touré served as the Executive Producer of Sophie's Parlor, the oldest women's music and politics collective in the United States. ==Writing and awards== Touré has received numerous awards for her ongoing hard work and commitment to human rights and justice for women of color in the D.C. area and worldwide. Her writings on these subjects can be read in a number of publications including Aegis and Vital Signs. She has also spoken widely at rallies, speak outs, and conferences. ==External links== * Nkenge Touré papers at the Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College Special Collections * Nkenge Touré oral history, interviewed by Loretta Ross as part of the Voices of Feminism Oral History Project, Smith College ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:African- American feminists Category:Reproductive rights activists ","title":"Nkenge Touré"},{"id":"63926021","text":"Xiulang Bridge station is a station on the Taipei Metro's Circular line.

Whilst attending, Harvey worked at the school’s newspaper, The Daily Collegian, as a photojournalist. He also had an interest in digital media and photography during his time. After working for four years, Harvey attended New York University for his Master's Degree in the school's Interactive Telecommunications Program where he studied computational photography and technology. == Career == Harvey's projects and works focus mainly on the connection of photography and technology, and span multiple concepts such as facial recognition, surveillance, and art design. Currently, he is a designer and independent researcher based in Berlin. Harvey is a self-proclaimed creative technologist and focuses on incorporating art with the technological world with concepts such as anti-surveillance. He became interested in the impacts of technology through working as a photographer, with his first job being working as freelance photographer in New York City. Harvey is against the use of surveillance and believes that people need to be exposed to and understand the technology behind it. In an interview with ArtBlog, Harvey stated that he has staged activist events against surveillance and was always interested in protesting the state of surveillance. He is the creator of the notable project/concept, CV Dazzle, aimed at camouflaging against facial detection systems, which turn images of faces into mathematical formulas that can be analyzed by algorithms. CV Dazzle – CV meaning computer vision – uses cubist-inspired designs to thwart the computer and fool the facial recognition software to minimize surveillance. This process uses multiple factors such as makeup, obscuring the eyes, and using objects to mask the facial structure of a person. This has garnered interest from multiple news sources such as Vice, The New Yorker, and the New York Post. Harvey's current work continues to explore variants of low-cost methods for averting high-tech surveillance. Harvey is also an avid speaker and presenter, and has spoken at multiple conferences and meetings such as TED, notably at TEDxVilnius in Vilnius, Lithuania. Harvey's work has been featured widely in media publication including the BBC, Spiegel, Washington Post, New York Times, Wired, The Atlantic, and the Financial Times; and shown at internationally acclaimed institutions, museums, and events. Adam Harvey has also had multiple other endeavors such as teaching at New York University (his alma mater), working for NEW INC., an arts organization that produced the New Art Museum in New York, and other technological works.

Paleobiology Database Navigator. Retrieved March 5, 2020. The first discovered fossil, P. elegans, was one of 15 Peradectes specimens described in 1921 from the Mason pocket fossil beds in Colorado.Matthew, W., & Granger, W. (1921). New genera of Paleocene mammals (American Museum novitates ; no. 13). New York City: By order of the Trustees of The American Museum of Natural History. ==Etymology== The genus name is derived from the Greek for “pouch” (pera-) and “biter” (-dectes), indicating a marsupial thought to engage primarily in carnivory. ==Taxonomy and relationships== Peradectidae or a similar ancestor likely gave rise to modern didelphids like Didelphis virginiana, the common Virginia opossum. The exact placement of Peradectes and its relationships have been uncertain. Some definitions of the group may be polyphyletic, and the extinct genus Thylacodon was thought by some to be synonymous with Peradectes; however, the two are now considered separate genera.Williamson, T.E., Brusatte, S.L., Carr, T.D., Weil, A. & Standhardt, B.R.

Middle Tertiary Marsupials (Mammalia) from North America. Journal of Paleontology, 68(2), 376-397. Though no longer believed to be didelphids, the opossum-like Peradectes and its relatives in Peradectidae may represent a primitive step in the evolution of opossums. A “peradectid or peradectid-like ancestor” may have given rise to didelphids in the Cretaceous.Marshall, L.G. & de Muizon, C. (1988). The dawn of the Age of Mammals in South America. National Geographic Research, 4(1):23-55. ==Description== Molars of Peradectes in buccal view (horizontal bar represents 1 mm) As with other mammals, due to the hardness of the enamel, teeth and jaws make up much of the fossil record of Peradectes. The jaw of the type specimen P. elegans is slender with a medially inflected angle as in other marsupials like opossums, and it possesses simple premolars and comparatively large canine teeth. Peradectes upper molars are distinctive, noted to have a larger metacone than protocone, a buccally oriented stylar shelf with cusp B as the largest cusp, and a short postmetaconule crista.Williamson, T.E. & Lofgren, D.L. (2014). \\"Late Paleocene (Tiffanian) Metatherians from the Goler Formation, California,\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 34(2), 477-482. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1080/02724634.2013.804413. Some specimens are also described as having a robust skull with a short snout and vertical directed lower incisors. Peradectes fossils tend to be small, with individual teeth for example measuring no larger than 1.5 mm. One particular specimen assigned to Peradectes has postcranial anatomy common to modern arboreal marsupials, including reduced transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, a posterior anticlinal vertebra, somewhat short metatarsals, and a comparatively long tail (1.5-2 times the length of the head and body) thought to have been prehensile. ==Distribution== Fossils of the group Peradectidae, of which Peradectes is a part, have been found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. It may be the only marsupial genus known from the Tiffanian North American land mammal age in the Paleocene, retaining its wide-ranging distribution from the preceding Torrejonian age. Specimens have been found at the Messel site of Germany and other parts of that country and southern England. Though peradectids were most common in the northern continents, specimens assigned to Peradectes are also known from South America. The existence of Peradectes in South America is significant in terms of broader marsupial evolution, as there is evidence that ancestors of modern Australian marsupials diverged from the lineage leading to modern New World marsupials on that continent.Nilsson, M. A., Churakov, G., Sommer, M., Tran, N. V., Zemann, A., Brosius, J., & Schmitz, J. (2010). Tracking marsupial evolution using archaic genomic retroposon insertions. PLoS biology, 8(7), e1000436. ==Palaeoecology== The skeletal anatomy of Peradectes is consistent with at least a partially arboreal lifestyle.Rose, K.D (2012). The importance of Messel for interpreting Eocene Holarctic mammalian faunas. Palaeobiodiversity and Palaeoenvironments 92, 631–647. Analyses have also suggested a partially scansorial life mode (climbing but not necessarily living in trees) for at least some Peradectes species, along with frugivorous or insectivorous feeding.Kurz, C.

It derives from the Roman law concept of the same name. Occupatio allows a occupier of an object (rem: 'a thing') with the intention to own the property to become the owner. As most property in Scotland is owned, and with the caduciary, or escheat, right that all ownerless property falls to the Crown, its application is uncommon. Nevertheless, it remains a valid method of requiring ownership in Scots law. == Roman law == In Roman law, Occupatio was an original method of acquiring ownership of un-owned property (res nullius) by occupying with intent to own. Nicholas argues this is the \\"archetype\\" of all other Roman law methods of original acquisition. According to the Roman jurist Gaius, any previously unowned thing becomes the just property of the first occupant able to \\"capture\\" it: Abandoned goods (res derelictae) was also res nullius and subject to acquirement through occupatio. == Application in Scots law == === Original acquisition === In original acquisition, the new Owner is first person to take ownership (ie: acquire) of the ownerless thing (res nullius). The law of original acquisition is strictly applied, and an original acquisition will only occur in a few specific situations, including acquisition by occupatio. The Crown's role as ultimus haeres and recipient of any bona vacantia (ie: abandoned) property in Scotland means that acquisition of previously unowned property is uncommon but occupatio remains a valid method to acquire ownership.  Ownerless things capable of occupatio acquisition  The following things (res nullius) were considered capable of acquisition by occupatio:  Occupatio of Shells, pearls, gems, pebbles or precious stones on the sea-shore  The above items were considered by the institutional writer Erskine to be res nullius capable of acquisition by occupatio.Erskine Institute II,1,10, In Scotland, the foreshore is owned by the Crown as part of the inter-regalia.  Occupatio of wild animals  Acquisition of the wild animal with the intent to own it vests the occupier or holder a real right of ownership. This is said to apply irrespective of whether the property has been taken from another person's land.Stair II,1,33; Erskine Institute II,1,10; Bell s 1286. Stair, Erskine, Bell are institutional writers so are a source of law in Scots law. This is because the owner of the land have no real right of ownership in the unowned thing itself, only a right to take. Therefore, wild animals (ferae naturae) which are not tame or domesticated animals, or salmon fish, are capable of being acquired by occupatio to give the taker a real right of ownership. If the wild animal frees itself from the occupier, the animal is considered wild or ferae naturae again.Erskine Institute II,1,10, Animals which return to their owner, such as bees or pigeons, are not considered ferae naturae.Stair II,1,33; Erskine II,1,10; Bell s 1290. However in practice, the poacher will lose ownership of the wild animal as a matter of forfeiture for committing a criminal offence. This is because poaching and other forms of theft are a criminal offence for the taking of wild animals without an owner's consent, such as Part III of the Deer Scotland Act 1996. Specific criminal offences in relation to types of Scottish wild animals are found in the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Additionally, the criminal courts of Scotland also have a general power under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to order the forfeiture and sale of the captured wild animal. Wild Salmon fish belong to the Crown and therefore form part of the inter regalia, so are excluded from acquisition by occupatio. Similarly, escaped farmed fish are not considered ferae naturae so are not capable of occupatio acquisition.Valentine v Kennedy 1985 SCCR 89C G van der Merwe and D Bain The Fish that Got Away: Some Reﬂections on Valentine v Kennedy (2008) 12 Edin LR 418. == References == Category:Scots property law ","title":"Occupatio (Scots law)"},{"id":"63926563","text":"Hari River near the Minaret of Jam, Ghor Province On May 1, 2020, a group of Afghan migrants seeking work tried to enter Iran and drowned in the Hari River on the border between Iran and Afghanistan. Reuters and other new agencies reported, quoting Afghan lawmakers, that Iran's border guards killed the migrants by forcing them into the river at gunpoint. == Incident == 50 to 70 Afghan immigrants tried to enter Iran by crossing the Hari River, which borders Herat Province with Iran, on May 1, 2020. These immigrants, according to some Afghan officials and the survivors, were arrested by Iranian border guards and after being beaten and tortured they were thrown into the Hari River.Ayaz Gul The Afghan Foreign Ministry said in a statement that an investigation had been launched into the incident and that initial assessments indicated that at least 70 Afghans trying to enter Iran from the border province of Herat had been beaten and thrown into the Hari River. == Victims == By May 7, 2020, the bodies of 17 drowned immigrants had been found. According to Abdul Ghani Nouri, the governor of Gulan in Herat Province, there are signs of torture on the bodies. == Survivors == Reuters has quoted Noor Mohammad, one of the survivors of the incident, that “After being tortured, the Iranian soldiers threw all of us in the Hari River,” One survivor told reporters the guards hit him with a pipe and pushed him into the river. Another said they had beaten him before throwing him into the river. ==Statements by Iranian officials denying the charges== Due to the slope of the Harirod River, Iranian officials have denied the allegations, as the bodies must have been found in Iranian soil, but according to the Afghan workers comments , the bodies were found on Afghan soil, so it would not be acceptable for Iranian border guards to throw the Afghans into Hari. Afghan officials blamed that the Iranian guards had entered well into the Afghan territory. The forensic doctor of Herat city declared that there is no evidence of torture on the bodies. Also, due to the muddy nature of the Helmand River, no traces of mud have been seen on the bodies.https://www.mashreghnews.ir/news/1071678/%D9%88%D8%A7%DA%A9%D9%86%D8%B4-%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%81%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B2%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%86 == Reactions == President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan has ordered an investigation into the incident.

She was responsible for the design and the layout of more than 75 public gardens across London in the late 19th century. == Early life and education == Fanny Wilkinson was born in 1855 in Manchester, the daughter of Matthew Eason Wilkinson, a prominent doctor in the city and a president of the British Medical Association, and his wife, Louisa. She was educated ‘privately and abroad’, but by the end of 1883 she had completed an 18-month course at the Crystal Palace School of Landscape Gardening and Practical Horticulture in London, at a time when such classes were intended only for men. She later said that 'I was always fond of gardening as a child, and I took it up because I felt it suited me, and I wanted to do something …’. She may have been inspired by the grounds of Middlethorpe Hall, the family residence in Yorkshire. == Career == In 1884 she was elected as honorary gardener to the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association but two years later this was changed to a professional position for which she was paid a fee. In an interview in 1890 she commented that ‘I certainly do not let myself be underpaid as many women do. … I know my profession and charge accordingly, as all women should do.’ Among the many public gardens across London that she planned and that were laid out under her supervision were Goldsmith’s Square, Hackney; Myatt’s Fields Park, Camberwell; Paddington Street Gardens, Marylebone; Meath Gardens, Bethnal Green; and the churchyard of St John, Smith Square, Westminster. In 1887 Fanny Wilkinson was also working as a landscape designer to the Kyrle Society, which aimed to ‘bring beauty to the lives of the poor’. Through the society she was commissioned to design Vauxhall Park, opened in 1890. This was created on land saved from development and purchased by Henry Fawcett and Millicent Garrett Fawcett; the latter, along with her sisters, became good friend of Fanny. Fanny's sister Louisa married Millicent’s brother. In 1902 she also became the first female Principal of Swanley Agricultural College and in that post she encouraged other women to enter the profession. She was also a founder member of the Women’s Agricultural and Horticultural International Union (1899), through which women were recruited to sustain agriculture and food production during the First World War. == References == Category:1855 births Category:1951 deaths Category:People from Manchester Category:British landscape and garden designers ","title":"Fanny Wilkinson"},{"id":"63926626","text":"Perishable Goods is a 1928 novel by the English author Dornford Yates (Cecil William Mercer), the second in his Chandos thriller series and a sequel to Blind Corner. The story features the recurrent characters Richard Chandos (narrator), Jonathan Mansel and George Hanbury, with their respective servants Bell, Carson and Rowley. == Plot == While on holiday at Poganec in Carinthia with Berry, Daphne and Boy (from the Berry books), Adèle is kidnapped by the villain 'Rose' Noble (in revenge for his defeat in Blind Corner) and is held captive at the Castle of Gath near Lass. A ransom is demanded.

It was developed by Ken Spitze in 1993. Its name reflects the fact that it was intended to be analogous to the fixation index for a single genetic locus, which is denoted FST. QST is often compared with FST to test the hypothesis that a given quantitative trait has been the subject of divergent selection between the populations being studied. Generally, if QST is found to exceed FST, this is interpreted as evidence of such divergent selection, because it indicates that there is more differentiation in the trait than could be produced solely by genetic drift. By contrast, if the values of QST and FST in the same study are approximately equal, it is considered to reflect that the observed trait differentiation could be entirely due to genetic drift.

He referred to ibn Taymiyyah as \\"our sheikh.\\" Most of his scholarship deals with Islamic legal theory and theology. His writings did not attract a large following of Hanbalis, though his Mukhtasar al-Rawdah has been commented upon up to the 16th century. He is known for his writings on maṣlaḥa, in that averting harm is a general obligation which can only be set aside by a specific legal ruling, such as the hudud punishments. His theory on maṣlaḥa later influenced Islamic Modernism. == Life == At-Tūfī received his first upbringing in his birthplace and traveled to Baghdad in 1282, where he studied Arabic grammar, fiqh, hadith, and logic. After a one-year stay in Damascus in 704 AH, where he used to attend the classes of Ibn Taymiyya and al-Mizzī, he moved to Cairo in 1305, where he continued his training with various scholars and as a tutor (muʿīd) at Mansūrīya and Nāsirīya. In 1311 CE he was imprisoned in Cairo for a few days for accusations of Shia leanings and then banished from the city. After a stopover in Damietta went to the city of Qus in Upper Egypt, where he worked through the libraries and wrote his own books. In 1315 he undertook the Hajj, after which he stayed in Mecca for another year. In 1316 he traveled to Palestine, where he died in the city of Hebron. === Accusations of Shi'a Leanings === There is some scholarly debate on at-Tūfī's biography about his possible inclination for the Shi'a. During his stay in Mecca he was in active contact with the Imamite scholar as-Sakākīnī. In Cairo, he was accused of representing Shi'a positions and insulting the Prophet's companions. Al-Safadi (d.764/1362) reports that he renounced his associations with Shi'ism,Al- Şafadī, Şalaĥ al-Dīn (2000) ‘al-Wāfī bi al-Wafayāt’, Beirut: Dār Iĥyā’ al- Turāth, Ed. Aĥmad al-Arna’ūţ and Turkī Muşţaphā, (29 vol) 19/43 however Ibn Rajab (d.795/1393) believed this renunciation was a form of taqiyya, accusing him of lying.Ibn Rajab, Zayn al-Dīn (2005) ‘Dhayl Țabaqāt al-Ĥanābilah’, Riyadh: Maktabat al-‘Ubaykān, Ed. ‘Abd al-Raĥmān al-‘Uthaymīn, (5 vol) 4/404-421 Mustafa Zayd refutes this and quotes al-Tufi criticizing Shi'a doctrines and states that al-Tufi is not cited in any Shi'a biographies of scholars.Zayd, Mustafā (1954) al-Maşlaĥah fī al-Tashrī’ al-Islāmī, Egypt: Dār al-Yusr, p.59-70 Muhammad Said Ramadan al-Bouti argues otherwise and adds that al-Tufi's criticism of Shi'ism shows his volatile character.Al-Butī, Ramađān Sa’īd (2007) ‘Đawābiţ al-Maşlaĥah fī al-Sharī’at al-Islāmiyyah’, Damascus: Dār al-Fikr, p.217-219 == Maṣlaḥa == His most complete writings on maslaha are in his commentary on imam Nawawi's (d. 1277 CE) collection of 40 hadith, where he comments on the 32nd hadith, la darar wa la diraar. He states that this means to inflict harm (mafsada) upon someone else and to inflict harm in requital, therefore neither harm nor requital should be inflicted upon someone. He supports this hadith with verses from the Qur'an and other hadith that Allah does not intend to burden the believers, but gave us Islam for benefit and maslaha. In his opinion, this hadith has priority over all of the Shari'a except where punishment is stipulated, such as in the hudud, because they are stated to be obligatory in the revelation and are of stronger basis than the general statement of \\"there is no harm or requital of harm.\\" He states that, by ijma, the harm caused by these punishments is permissible. Therefore averting harm is a general obligation which can only be superseded by a specific legal injunction. al-Tufi states in his theory of maṣlaḥa that it can only apply to muamalat (social dealings) and ādāt (customs and habits) and not ibadat (worship) and muqaddarāt (fixed stipulations), because acts of worship can only be known via revelation whereas our minds can be applied to social dealings. He stated that if the Qur'an, hadith, and ijma contradict the maslaha, then the maslaha would take precedence. A major issue with his theory is that he was unable to provide any practical examples of applying his theory in his era, whereas imam al-Ghazali was able to provide clear examples of when it can override a text and where it cannot. This is one major reason that scholars like al-Ghazālī, al-Qarāfī and al-Shāṭibī had far more influential theories of maṣlaḥa than al-Tufi. It also appears that al-Tufi was influenced by the writings of imam al-Qarāfī, as he seems to exactly quote from him in citing the nineteen evidences of Islamic law.Al-Qarāfī, Shihāb al-Dīn (1973) ‘Sharĥ Tanqīĥ al-Fuşūl’, Egypt: Shirkat al-Țabā’at al-Funniyyat al-Muttaĥidah, Ed. ‘Abd al-Ra’ūf S’ad, p.445 === Islamic Modernism === His interpretation of maslaha did not take hold until the early 20th century when Jamal ad-Din al- Qasimi (1866-1914 CE) and Rashid Rida (1865-1935 CE) revived his concept of maslaha in the Islamic magazine al-Manar to counter secular reformers. Al- Tufi's theory of maslaha was appealing to reformers as it opened the door for them to \\"update\\" the Shari'a in a dynamic world. At that time, Islamic law was being displaced by Western models of jurisprudence after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire and creation of modern nation states in the Middle East and North Africa. Most of these new nation states created legal codes based on European law, such as French and British law. In the 1950s, for example, Egypt and Tunisia abolished their Shari'a courts and turned to secular law. These modernists wanted to \\"modernize\\" Islam partly as a response to European influence and to \\"catch up\\" with the West, where Islamic scholars were seen as an obstacle to modernization and advancement. This theory of maslaha provided the avenue for keeping the Shari'a and Islamic scholars relevant in their changing world, by using an \\"interal\\" theory rather than something perceived as foreign. Tufi's theory helped Rashid Rida prove that the Shari'a is not antithetical to reason and served Rida's desire to use maslaha to derive rulings, as it was easier to just use maslaha instead of going through the traditional processes of usul al-fiqh. Additionally, it helped Rida and al- Qasimi to depart from the traditional Sunni schools of thought and usul al- fiqh, as it freed them from following the fatwas and methodologies of the early scholars (taqlid) and from following a madhhab. Through this they ironically sought to keep Islamic scholars relevant and provide an alternative to the growing European-influenced secular jurisprudence and reforms of the Muslim states at the time. Rida also blamed the weakness of the Muslim world in comparison to Western hegemony and colonialism on ikhtilaf between the schools of thought. By proposing maslaha as a universally accepted legal standard, Rida desired to unite the Muslim world on one school of thought and strengthen them against Western domination. Shortly after, Rida's revival of maslaha was criticized by Al-Kawtharī, al-Būṭī, and other Islamic scholars. Some scholars likened it to a type of utilitarianism similar to the ideas of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, as he used the fallible human mind to restrict Allah's rulings (ahkam). Wael Hallaq states that al-Tufi's theory was too vague, since he never defined its scope or concept in sufficient detail, and therefore his theory was \\"inferior to the average theoretical discourse.\\" == Works == Of the more than 50 works that at-Tūfī wrote, 19 have been preserved. * Mukhtasar al-Rawdah, an abridgement of Rawdat al-Nazir by Ibn Qudamah * al-Ta'līq 'alā al-Anājīl al-arba'a wa-al-ta'līq 'alā al-Tawrāh wa-'alā ghayrihā min kutub al-anbiyā' (Critical Commentary on the Four Gospels, the Torah and other Books of the Prophets) * Kitāb at-Taʿyīn fī šarḥ al-Arbaʿīn (\\"Book of Specification for Commenting on the Forty\\"), commentary on an-Nawawī's collection of the forty hadiths, which was particularly popular in the 20th century. In this work, at-Tūfī, in connection with the commentary on the 32nd hadith “No harm and no harmful retribution” (lā ḍarar wa-lā ḍirār), developed his theory of the “common good” (maṣlaḥa), which generally weights more would have to be as text documents from Koran and Sunna. The modern Syrian scholar Jamāl ad-Dīn al-Qāsimī (1866–1914) published this text separately and provided it with his own explanations.Zaid: al-Maṣlaḥa fī t-tašrīʿ al-islāmī . 2004, p. 133. Raschīd Ridā reprinted the text with the explanations of al-Qāsimīs in his magazine al-Manār in 1906, thereby making it known to a larger Islamic public.

ISAR also provides scientific information through peer-reviewed scientific journals and administers several international awards. , the president of the society was Johan Neyts and the president-elect was Kara Carter. Johan Neyts was succeeded as president by Kara Carter, and the president-elect for 2020-2022 became Katherine Seley-Radtke. ==Founding== The foundation for the International Society for Antiviral Research (ISAR) was laid at meetings held in Rotterdam, Netherlands (April 30 – May 3, 1985) and in Il Ciocco, Italy (May 10-23, 1987) by NATO. The society, in the persons of William M. Shannon, Earl R. Kern, and Richard J. Whitley registered articles of incorporation in the United States in the state of Alabama, on May 14, 1987. The society's stated purpose was \\"the promotion and advancement of scientific knowledge in the area of antiviral scientific research\\". The original Board of Directors of ISAR included Alfons Billiau (KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium), Erik De Clercq (Rega Institute, KU Leuven), A. Kirk Field (Squibb Institute for Medical Research, Princeton, New Jersey), George J. Galasso (National Institutes of Health (U.S.)), Earl R. Kern (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah), William M. Shannon (Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, Alabama), and Richard J. Whitley (University of Alabama at Birmingham).

Its location circulates between the east coast of the United States, the west coast of the US, and the rest of the world, reflecting the distribution of its members. Locations have included Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia as well as the USA. It is generally agreed that the second ICAR was a meeting held in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1988, which was advertised as such. Neither the Rotterdam meeting (1985) nor the Italy meeting (1987) was identified at the time as \\"the first\\" International Conference for Antiviral Research (ICAR). Since then, each meeting has been described as the first ICAR meeting by different proponents. George Galasso and others consider Rotterdam the first meeting because at that meeting Galasso, Erik De Clercq and Alfons Billiau discussed formation of a Society and decided to approach Earl Kern and Richard Whitley. Erik De Clercq has emphasized the 1987 NATO meeting at Il Ciocco because ideas for both ISAR and ICAR were developed there. ==Publications== * Antiviral Research, established 1981. * Antiviral Chemistry and Chemotherapy, established January 1990. * Antiviral Therapy, established 1996. * ISAR NEWS (Newsletter of the International Society for Antiviral Research) ==Awards given== * ISAR Award of Excellence, awarded intermittently: William Prusoff, 1988; Gertrude Elion, 1991; Erik De Clercq, 1998; Richard J.

His father Emanuel Aber ran a menswear business. His special musical talent was recognized early on. In 1911 he passed his school- leaving examination as a primary school pupil at the Realgymnasium Weimar, which he would only have been able to do in Apolda when he reached full maturity in 1914. In the same year he went to the Berlin University and studied musicology there. Hermann Kretzschmar (1848-1924) became his teacher. His doctoral thesis entitled Die Pflege der Musik unter den Wettinern und wettinischen Ernestinern von den Anfängen bis zur Auflösung der Weimarer Hofkapelle 1662Die Pflege der Musik unter den Wettinern und wettinischen Ernestinern : von den Anfängen bis zur Auflösung der Weimarer Hofkapelle 1662 (The cultivation of music among the Wettin and Wettin Ernestinians from the beginnings to the dissolution of the Weimar court orchestra in 1662) on WorldCat was considered so important that it was published in book form in 1921. In 1919 Aber moved to Leipzig, where he worked for the ', at that time one of the most important daily newspapers in Germany, as critic and from 1913 to 1933 as music consultant, and some of his most important book publications appeared, as for example in 1922 the Handbuch der Musikliteratur in systematisch-chronologische Anordnung (Handbook of Music Literature in Systematic Chronological Order), which appeared in 1967 as reprint. The concerts of the Gewandhaus Orchestra, the performances of the Leipzig Opera and the St. Thomas Boys Choir in St. Thomas Church provided rich material for his reports. He concluded friendship with many composers, such as for example Richard Strauss. When the National Socialists came to power Aber emigrated to London with his wife Mignon, née Platky. He became an employee, later publishing director, of the music publishing house Novello & Co. which still exists today, printed the compositions of early Leipzig Thomaskantors, such as Johann Hermann Schein and Johann Kuhnau, and made a name for himself in particular by promoting German music abroad, which was not easy due to the aversion of the English to all things German. Through Aber's dedicated work, the dissemination of folk songs by Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms succeeded. He made contemporary composers like Fritz Jöde and Cesar Bresgen famous in England. In 1958, on his 65th birthday, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his achievements by President of Germany Theodor Heuss. Afterwards he and his wife were received by Queen Elizabeth II. On 21 May 1960 Aber died in London at age 67 after a short illness. In an obituary of the publishing house Novello & Co. it says about him: \\"Adolf Aber - a man of comprehensive culture and stimulating temperament. He will be greatly missed, both in publishing circles and in the large circle of his friends, many of whom are among the most important musicians of our time\\". == Work == * 1921 Doktorarbeit Die Pflege der Musik unter den Wettinern und wettinischen Ernestinern von den Anfängen bis zur Auflösung der Weimarer Hofkapelle 1662 * 1922 Handbuch der Musikliteratur in systematisch-chronologischer Anordnung (issued in 1967 in Hildesheim as reprint) == Literature == * Ullmann, Dieter: Adolf Aber – ein bedeutender Musikwissenschaftler aus Apolda.

The watershed drains the foothills of the Diablo Range south of Niles Canyon. To the southeast, the area of Mission Peak Regional Preserve around Mission Peak is included. Agua Caliente, Canada del Aliso, Mission, Morrison, Sabercat, Vargas, and Washington creeks drain the area of the watershed. They drain into Laguna Creek and eventually Mud Slough. Water from winter and spring storms feed the creeks and the watershed. Natural springs along Mission Peak are also a source of water. Many of the creeks are dry when there is no rain. ==Background== Valley Oak Morrison Creek and Mission Creek meet just before Mission Creek flows into Lake Elizabeth on the lake's southern shore. Much of what is now the Fremont Central Park was once the Stivers Lagoon. After the creeks leave the park, Laguna Creek and Irvington creek divide. At the time of the Spanish settlement and the construction of Mission San José, groundwater was still readily available through the porous sandstone in the area. Development of water systems, and later residential and industrial development drained the water table, depleting the underground springs and leaving ground water sources only in areas close to the creeks. Prior to settlement, the area was filled with wildlife. In fact Sabercat Creek derives its name from pre-historic fossils found in that area. The watershed still has many of the plants and trees native to the area, including valley oak, Frémont's cottonwood, and California sycamore. Mud Slough debouches into the San Francisco Bay near the site of the ghost town of Drawbridge. Its proximity to the bay means its marshy end is affected by tidal action. It goes from freshwater, to brackish to saline. The slough passes the salt evaporation ponds made by the Leslie Salt Company, where it joins the larger Coyote Creek and the bay. Laguna Creek is also the site of flood control projects. ==See also== *List of watercourses in the San Francisco Bay Area *Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge ==References== ==External links== * Category:Landforms of Alameda County, California Category:Landforms of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:San Francisco Bay watershed ","title":"Laguna Creek watershed"},{"id":"63926957","text":"Sophie de Renneville or Madame de Renneville, was the pen name of Sophie de Senneterre, who was born in Senneterre, Caen, France in 1772 and died in Paris in 1822 at 50.

The book referred to [by Henriette] by the much published > Mme de Renneville (née Sophie de Senneterre) is doubtless her Biographie des > femmes Ulustres de Rome, de la Grèce et du Bas-Empire (Paris: Parmantier, > 1825).\\" In that book by Renneville, her female protagonist named Agnodice from Athens, decided to dressed as a man so she could attend \\"the famous school of Herophilus to study medicine and especially the art of midwifery.\\" After opening her own practice, she proved to be a popular physician but, when she was unmasked, was condemned by her male colleagues by \\"invoking the law that denied her the right to practice medicine.\\" But the outcry from Agnodice's patients, and the greater female community, caused the law to be overturned. In 19th century France, readers popularized the book and bemoaned the fact that Renneville's heroine was only fiction. == Selected publications == According to WorldCat, Renneville has 288 works in 700 publications in 5 languages and 1,296 library holdings worldwide, as of 2020. *Vie de Ste Clotilde, reine de France, femme du grand Clovis, suivie d’un Précis mêlé d’anecdotes, concernant les mœurs et coutumes des premiers siècles de la monarchie française, Paris, Villet, 1809 *Biographie des femmes illustres : de Rome, de la Grèce et du Bas-Empire, Paris, Parmantier, 1825 *À bas la Cabale.

As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown. Supply shortages are expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying, increased usage of goods to fight the pandemic, and disruption to factories and logistics in mainland China. There have been instances of price gouging. There have been widespread reports of shortages of pharmaceuticals, with many areas seeing panic buying and consequent shortages of food and other essential grocery items. The technology industry, in particular, has been warning about delays to shipments of electronic goods. Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis. Global stock markets crashed in March 2020, with falls of several percent in the world's major indices. Possible instability generated by an outbreak and associated behavioural changes could result in temporary food shortages, price spikes, and disruption to markets. Such price rises would be felt most by vulnerable populations who depend on markets for their food as well as those already depending on humanitarian assistance to maintain their livelihoods and food access. As observed in the 2007–2008 food prices crisis, the additional inflationary effect of protectionist policies through import tariffs and export bans could cause a significant increase in the number of people facing severe food insecurity worldwide. As the pandemic spreads, global conferences and events across technology, fashion, and sports are being cancelled or postponed. While the monetary impact on the travel and trade industry is yet to be estimated, it is likely to be in the billions and increasing. ==Background== WTI price from 2019. The crash started in mid-February 2020. On 20 April 2020, prices dropped below zero for the first time in recorded history. The initial outbreak of the pandemic in China coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday. A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland. Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs. In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to re-open until that date. These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports. Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The demand for personal protection equipment has risen 100-fold, according to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom. This demand has led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays on the supply of medical items for four to six months. ==Overall economic contraction== The coronavirus recession is an economic recession happening across the world economy in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global stock markets experienced their worst crash since 1987, and in the first three months of 2020 the G20 economies fell 3.4% year-on-year. Between April and June 2020, the International Labour Organization estimated that an equivalent of 400 million full-time jobs were lost across the world, and income earned by workers globally fell 10 percent in the first nine months of 2020, equivalent to a loss of over US$3.5 trillion. ==Economic recovery programmes== Nations, cities and other collectives with governance mechanisms worldwide have announced the development and implementation of programmes for guided economic recovery. Some economic recovery programmes include Next Generation EU and Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. A study published in August 2020 concluded that the direct effect of the response to the pandemic on global warming will likely be negligible and that a well-designed economic recovery could avoid future warming of 0.3 °C by 2050. The study indicates that systemic change for \\"decarbonization\\" of humanity's economic structures is required for a substantial impact on global warming, which also has economic aspects. Beyond targeted financing of green projects or sectors, contemporary decision-making mechanisms also allow for excluding projects with substantial environmental, social, or climate risks from financial relief. Over 260 civil society organizations called on Chinese actors to ensure that COVID-19 related Belt and Road Initiative funding excludes such projects. == Agriculture == === Food crisis contexts === In food crisis countries, up to 80 percent of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihoods. Therefore, any further disruptions to food production and related value chains, for example in the form of reduced availability of critical inputs or restricted access to lands or markets, could be catastrophic for vulnerable populations. The agriculture sector plays an important role in influencing migratory patterns. Transhumant pastoral populations are likely to be hard hit by any border closures, as they rely on seasonal movements of livestock for their food and income. The disruption of traditional and western patterns and the creation of new ones may lead to tensions and even violent conflicts between resident and pastoralist communities, resulting in local displacement and increased levels of poverty and food insecurity. According to FAO, it is crucial to maintain and support the continuous functioning of local food markets, value chains and agri-food systems in food crisis contexts, including through ongoing and scaled up support to food processing, transport, marketing, and so forth; strengthening of local producers’ groups to maintain negotiation power and access to markets; and, advocating for trade corridors to remain open as much as possible during COVID-19 related movement restrictions. ==Financial markets== Economic turmoil associated with the coronavirus pandemic has wide- ranging and severe impacts upon financial markets, including stock, bond and commodity (including crude oil and gold) markets. Major events included the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war that resulted in a collapse of crude oil prices and a stock market crash in March 2020. The United Nations Development Programme expects a US$220 billion reduction in revenue in developing countries, and expects COVID-19's economic impact to last for months or even years. Some expect natural gas prices to fall. == Manufacturing == New vehicle sales in the United States have declined by 40%. The American Big Three have all shut down their US factories. The German automotive industry came into the crisis after having already suffered from the Dieselgate-scandal, as well as competition from electric cars. Boeing and Airbus suspended production at some factories. A survey conducted by the British Plastics Federation (BPF) explored how COVID-19 is impacting manufacturing businesses in the United Kingdom (UK). Over 80% of respondents anticipated a decline in turnover over the next 2 quarters, with 98% admitting concern about the negative impact of the pandemic on business operations. == The arts, entertainment and sport == The epidemic had a sudden and substantial impact on the arts and cultural heritage (GLAM) sectors worldwide. The global health crisis and the uncertainty resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals – both employed and independent – across the sector. By March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. Many individuals temporarily or permanently lost contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, financial stimulus from governments and charities for artists, have provided greatly differing levels of support, depending on the sector and the country. In countries such as Australia, where the arts contributed to about 6.4% of GDP, effects on individuals and the economy have been significant. === Cinema === The pandemic has impacted the film industry. Across the world and to varying degrees, cinemas have been closed, festivals have been cancelled or postponed, and film releases have been moved to future dates. As cinemas closed, the global box office dropped by billions of dollars, while streaming became more popular and the stock of Netflix rose; the stock of film exhibitors dropped dramatically. Almost all blockbusters to be released after the March opening weekend were postponed or cancelled around the world, with film productions also halted. Massive losses in the industry have been predicted. === Sport === Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which were postponed on 24 March 2020 until 2021. === Television === The COVID-19 pandemic has shut down or delayed production of television programs in several countries. However, a joint report from Apptopia and Braze showed a 30.7% increase in streaming sessions worldwide on platforms such as Disney+, Netflix, and Hulu during the month of March. === Video games === The pandemic also affected the video game sector to a smaller degree. As the outbreak appeared in China first, supply chains affected the manufacturing and production of some video game consoles, delaying their releases and making current supplies scarcer. As the outbreak and pandemic spread, several keystone trade events, including E3 2020, were cancelled over concerns of further spread. The economic impact on the video game sector is not expected to be as large as in film or other entertainment sectors as much of the work in video game production can be decentralised and performed remotely, and products distributed digitally to consumers regardless of various national and regional lockdowns on businesses and services. == Publishing == The pandemic is predicted to have a dire effect on local newspapers in the United States, where many were already severely struggling beforehand. In light of the public health situation in which includes afflicted regions where retail sectors deemed non-essential have been ordered closed for the interim, Diamond Comic Distributors announced on 24 March 2020 a full suspension of distributing published material and related merchandise as 1 April 2020 until further notice. As Diamond has a near-monopoly on printed comic book distribution, this is described as an \\"extinction-level event\\" that threatens to drive the entire specialized comic book retail sector out of business with that one move. As a result, publishers like IDW Publishing and Dark Horse Comics have suspended publication of their periodicals while DC Comics is exploring distribution alternatives including an increased focus on online retail of digital material. == Retail == Best Buy was only letting a limited number of people into their Union Square store in New York City, 18 March 2020 The pandemic has impacted the retail sector. Shopping centres around the world responded by reducing hours or closing down temporarily. As of 18 March 2020, the footfall to shopping centres fell by up to 30%, with significant impact in every continent. Additionally, product demand exceeded supply for many consumables, resulting in empty retail shelves. In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou shoppers to re-sell into the China market. \\"The virus crisis, while frightening, has a silver lining\\". Some retailers have employed contactless home delivery or curbside pickup for items purchased through e-commerce sites. By April, retailers had started implementing \\"retail to go\\" models where consumers could pick up their orders. An estimated 40% of shoppers were shopping online and choosing to pick up in-store, a behavior that had suddenly doubled as compared to the previous year. Small-scale farmers have been embracing digital technologies as a way to directly sell produce, and community-supported agriculture and direct-sell delivery systems are on the rise. Retail suffered 40-60% drop in footfall in Mar 2020 In mid-April, Amazon confirmed that workers at over half of its 110 U.S. warehouses had been diagnosed with coronavirus. On 16 June, the United States Department of Commerce announced that retail sales for the month of May had seen an increase of 17.7% from April as states began to reopen and lift restrictions. According to CNBC, This marks the biggest one month jump in the history of retailing in the United States. Numbers for June reflected a 7.5 percent rise in sales. === Business closures === By April, department store retailers JCPenney, Nordstrom, Macy's and Kohl's had lost $12.3 billion combined in market caps. Neiman Marcus and JCPenney defaulted on bond payments in April, preparing internally for bankruptcy court and bankruptcy protection. J.Crew and Neiman Marcus filed for bankruptcy during the first week of May; they were reportedly the first two major retailers to do so during the pandemic. JCPenney filed for bankruptcy on 15 May. In May, Pier 1 announced it would close as soon as possible. It had sought court protection in February and had hoped that someone would buy the business, but the subsequent recession made this seem unlikely. == Restaurant sector == Signs on a Thai Restaurant in Crofton MD The pandemic has impacted the restaurant business. In the beginning of March 2020, some major cities in the US announced that bars and restaurants would be closed to sit-down dinners and limited to takeout orders and delivery. Later in the month, many states put in place restrictions that required restaurants to be takeout or delivery only. Some employees were fired, and more employees lacked sick leave in the sector compared to similar sectors. With only carry- out and delivery services, most servers and bartenders were laid off, prompting these employees creating \\"virtual tip jars\\" across 23 U.S. cities. In the United States, an initiative known as the \\"Great American Takeout\\" called on people under quarantine to support local restaurants each Tuesday by ordering takeout for curbside pickup or using food delivery services. It began in late March 2020. == Science and technology == The pandemic has impacted productivity of science, space and technology projects, and to the world's leading space agencies – including NASA and the European Space Agency having to halt production of the Space Launch System, James Webb Space Telescope, and put space science probes into hibernation or low power mode. Most of both agencies' field centers have directed most personnel to telework. Various IT companies had launched several programs to sustain in this pandemic and in this new normal life . The pandemic may have improved scientific communication or established new forms of it. For instance a lot of data is being released on preprint servers and is getting dissected on social Internet platforms and sometimes in the media before entering formal peer review. Scientists are reviewing, editing, analyzing and publishing manuscripts and data at record speeds and in large numbers. This intense communication may have allowed an unusual level of collaboration and efficiency among scientists. == Tourism == branch of SESC Hotels in São João da Barra, Brazil, had to close down due to the financial crisis caused by the pandemic. Philia Tounta summarised likely effects of COVID-19 on global tourism early in March 2020: * severe effects because tourism depends on travel * quarantine restrictions * fear of airports and other places of mass gathering * fears of illness abroad * issues with cross-border medical insurance * tourism enterprise bankruptcies * tourism industry unemployment * airfare cost increases * damage to the image of the cruise industry == Events and institutions == The pandemic has caused the cancellation or postponement of major events around the world. Some public venues and institutions have closed. == Transportation == A nearly empty flight from Beijing to Los Angeles during the pandemic The cruise ship industry has also been heavily affected by a downturn, with the share prices of the major cruise lines down 70–80%. In many of the world's cities, planned travel went down by 80–90%. === Aviation === alt=Many in line airplanes with the Delta Air Lines logo on the tail, parked on pavement behind a fence. The pandemic has had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as a slump in demand among travellers. Significant reductions in passenger numbers have resulted in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights. United States passenger airlines can expect about $50 billion in subsidies from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. ===Cruise lines=== Cruise lines had to cancel sailings after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bookings and cancellations grew as extensive media coverage of ill passengers on quarantined ships hurt the industry's image. Cruise line stock fell sharply on 27 March 2020 when the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act excluded companies that are not \\"organized\\" under United States law. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) tweeted: \\"The giant cruise companies incorporate overseas to dodge US taxes, flag vessels overseas to avoid US taxes and laws, and pollute without offset. Why should we bail them out?\\" Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) tweeted that cruise lines should register and pay taxes in the United States if they expect a financial bailout. U.S-based employees and small, American-owned companies are eligible for financial assistance. == Gambling and betting == According to the American Gaming Association, the industry will be hit by losses up to $43.5 billion in economic activity in the following months. Some projection was that the sports gambling industry may lose $140 million alone in the fourth weekend of March (21–22 March 2020) on lost NCAA basketball tournament bets. Gambling companies are eager to shift customers from retail into online casino and poker games in order to fight the loss of revenue due to the cancellation of sports fixtures and the shutdown of betting shops. Gambling groups increased the advertising of online casino games and play on social media. Some argue that virtual racing, as well as draw based games, are also proving popular. Some software betting providers have specially designed campaigns promoting online betting solutions in order to attract betting companies. Long term consequences to the betting and gambling industry might be: Death of small retail operators and providers, increase in M&A;, more focus on online, innovation in online meaning that even the existing products like the sportsbook will pay closer attention to obscure sports like soap soccer or quidditch and more prominent spot for virtual games online. In Macau, the world's top gambling destination by revenue, all casinos were closed for 15 days in February 2020 and suffered a year-on-year revenue drop of 88%, the worst ever recorded in the territory. ==Unemployment== The International Labour Organization stated on 7 April that it predicted a 6.7% loss of job hours globally in the second quarter of 2020, equivalent to 195 million full-time jobs. They also estimated that 30 million jobs were lost in the first quarter alone, compared to 25 million during the 2008 financial crisis. In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs. Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid. The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate may hit 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of migrant workers unemployed. The survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some type of job loss. Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since it went into lockdown in mid-March 2020. During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on a government-subsidized short-time working schemes known as Kurzarbeit. The German short-time work compensation scheme has been copied by France and Britain. The pandemic's economic impacts are likely to increase sexual exploitation and child marriage, leaving women and girls in fragile economies and refugee contexts particularly vulnerable. The potential combined impact of COVID-19 on unemployment, households’ purchasing power, food prices, and food availability in local markets could severely jeopardize access to food in the most vulnerable countries. == Impact by gender == When crises strike, women and girls are harder hit by economic impacts than men. Around the world, women generally earn less and save less, are the majority of single-parent households and disproportionately hold more insecure jobs in the informal economy or service sector with less access to social protections. This leaves them less able to absorb the economic shocks than men. For many families, school closures and social distancing measures have increased the unpaid care and domestic load of women at home, making them less able to take on or balance paid work. The situation is worse in developing economies, where a larger share of people are employed in the informal economy in which there are far fewer social protections for health insurance, paid sick leave and more. Although globally informal employment is a greater source of employment for men (63 per cent) than for women (58 per cent), in low and lower-middle income countries a higher proportion of women are in informal employment than men. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, around 92 per cent of employed women are in informal employment compared to 86 per cent of men. It is likely that the pandemic could result in a prolonged dip in women's incomes and labour force participation. The ILO estimates global unemployment to rise between 5.3 million (“low” scenario) and 24.7 million (“high” scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019 as a result of COVID-19's impact on global GDP growth. By comparison, global unemployment went up by 22 million during the 2008-9 global financial crisis. Women informal workers, migrants, youth and the world's poorest, among other vulnerable groups, are more susceptible to lay- offs and job cuts. For example, UN Women survey results from Asia and the Pacific are showing that women are losing their livelihoods faster than men and have fewer alternatives to generate income. And, in the U.S., men's unemployment went up from 3.55 million in February to 11 million in April in 2020 while women's unemployment – which was lower than men's before the crisis – went up from 2.7 million to 11.5 million over the same period, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The picture is even bleaker for young women and men aged 16–19, whose unemployment rate jumped from 11.5 per cent in February to 32.2 per cent in April. ==Economic impact by region and country== === East Asia ===  Mainland China  The economy of China was anticipated to generate billions in economic output. Morgan Stanley expected the economy of China to grow by between 5.6% (worst-case scenario) to 5.9% for 2020. For reference, China generated US$143 billion in February 2019, the month of Chinese New Year. The Chinese Ministry of Transport reported that trips on trains dropped 73% to 190 million trips from the previous year. Factories, retailers, and restaurant chains closed. All 70,000 theatre screens in the country were shuttered, wiping out the entire box office. This is drastically in stark difference from the week of Chinese New Year in 2019 that generated $836 million. Though cautioning that the economic impact would be short-term, PRC National Development and Reform Commission party secretary Cong Liang views small and medium businesses encountering more difficulties in their operations. Human Resources and Social Security Assistant Minister You Jun specified that agricultural workers and college graduates would have difficulties. Animated map showing confirmed COVID-19 cases spreading from 22 January (high resolution) Tourism in China has been hit hard by travel restrictions and fears of contagion, including a ban on both domestic and international tour groups. Many airlines have either cancelled or greatly reduced flights to China and several travel advisories now warn against travel to China. Many countries, including France, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, have evacuated their nationals from the Wuhan and Hubei provinces. The majority of schools and universities have extended their annual holidays to mid-February. Overseas students enrolled at Chinese universities have been returning home over fears of being infected—the first cases to be reported by Nepal and Kerala, a southern state of India, were both of students who had returned home. Nearly 200 million students have been affected by the in-school closures, with the second semester after the Chunyun resuming on 17 February through online classes for students to follow from their homes instead. The Ministry of Education has introduced a 7,000-server supported \\"national Internet cloud classroom\\" to cater to the 50 million elementary and middle school student populations. The Finance Ministry of China announced it would fully subsidise personal medical costs incurred by patients. CNN reported that some people from Wuhan \\"have become outcasts in their own country, shunned by hotels, neighbors and – in some areas – placed under controversial quarantine measures.\\" The sale of new cars in China has been affected due to the outbreak. There was a 92% reduction on the volume of cars sold during the first two weeks of February 2020. On 24 February, China's Standing Committee declared an immediate and \\"comprehensive\\" ban on its US$74 billion wildlife trade industry, citing the \\"prominent problem of excessive consumption of wild animals, and the huge hidden dangers to public health and safety\\" that has been revealed by the outbreak. This permanently extends the temporary ban already in place since the end of January. According to Carbon Brief, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in China's greenhouse gas emissions being reduced by 25%. In March 2020, satellite images from space provided by NASA revealed that pollution has dropped significantly, which has been attributed in part to the slowdown of economic activity as a result of the outbreak.  Shortages of medical supplies  People in Wuhan lining up in front of a drug store to buy surgical masks A notice at a supermarket in Beijing, which says each person can only buy one pack of surgical masks and one bottle of 84 disinfectant liquid a day As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public. It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour. Some stores hoarded supplies, driving up prices, so the market regulator cracked down on such acts. The shortage will not be relieved until late February, when most workers return from the New Year vacation, according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry. On 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group, said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. Special subsidies would be provided to the retailers. Also, Alibaba Health's \\"urgent drug delivery\\" service would not be closed during the Spring Festival. JD, another leading Chinese e-commerce platform, said, \\"We are actively working to ensure supply and price stability from sources, storage and distribution, platform control and so on\\" and \\"while fully ensuring price stability for JD's own commodities, JD.com has also exercised strict control over the commodities on JD's platform. Third-party vendors selling face masks are prohibited from raising prices. Once it is confirmed that the prices of third-party vendors have increased abnormally, JD will immediately remove the offending commodities from shelves and deal with the offending vendors accordingly.\\" Other major e-commerce platforms including Sunning.com and Pinduoduo also promised to keep the prices of health products stable.

But on 1 February 2020, the People's Bank of China said that the impact of the epidemic on China's economy was temporary and that the fundamentals of China's long- term positive and high-quality growth remained unchanged. In late January, economists predicted a V-shaped recovery. By March, it was much more uncertain.The Economist, March 28th 2020, page 37. Due to the outbreak, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced that with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the closing time for the Spring Festival will be extended to 2 February and trading will resume on 3 February.

However, the government also stated an intention to create 9 million new urban jobs until the end of 2020. On October 2020, it was announced that China's third-quarter GDP has grown with 4.9%, hereby missing analysts expectations (which was set at 5,2%). However, it does show that China's economy has indeed been steadily recovering from the coronavirus shock that caused decades-low growth.China's third-quarter GDP grows 4.9% year-on-year, misses expectations To fuel economic growth, the country set aside hundreds of billions of dollars for major infrastructure projects and utilized population tracking policies and enforced the stringent lockdown to contain the virus.China's economic recovery gains even more momentumIt is the only major economy that is expected to grow in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.China’s Economy Continues Rebound With 4.9% Growth In Third Quarter  Hong Kong  Hong Kong has seen high-profile protests that saw tourist arrivals from mainland China plummet over an eight-month period. The viral epidemic put additional pressure on the travel sector to withstand a prolonged period of downturn. A drop in arrivals from third countries more resilient during the previous months has also been cited as a concern. The city is already in recession and Moody has lowered the city's credit rating. There has also been a renewed increase in protest activity as hostile sentiment against mainland Chinese strengthened over fears of viral transmission from mainland China, with many calling for the border ports to be closed and for all mainland Chinese travellers to be refused entry. Incidents have included a number of petrol bombs being thrown at police stations, a homemade bomb exploding in a toilet, and foreign objects being thrown onto transit rail tracks between Hong Kong and the mainland Chinese border. Political issues raised have included concerns that mainland Chinese may prefer to travel to Hong Kong to seek free medical help (which has since been addressed by the Hong Kong government). Since the outbreak of the virus, a significant number of products have been sold out across the city, including face masks and disinfectant products (such as alcohol and bleach). An ongoing period of panic buying has also caused many stores to be cleared of non-medical products such as bottled water, vegetables and rice. The Government of Hong Kong had its imports of face masks cancelled as global face mask stockpiles decline. In view of the coronavirus pandemic, the Education Bureau closed all kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, and special schools until 17 February.

The health minister has pointed out that the situation has not reached a point where mass gatherings must be called off 1 February 2020. Aviation, retail and tourism sectors have reported decreased sales and some manufactures have complained about disruption to Chinese factories, logistics and supply chains. Prime Minister Abe has considered using emergency funds to mitigate the outbreak's impact on tourism, of which Chinese nationals account for 40%. S&P; Global noted that the worst hit shares were from companies spanning travel, cosmetics and retail sectors which are most exposed to Chinese tourism. Nintendo announced that they would delay shipment of the Nintendo Switch, which is manufactured in China, to Japan.

The national government has thus been taking extra precautions to help minimise the outbreak's impact. The Tokyo organising committee and the International Olympic Committee have been monitoring the outbreak's impact in Japan. On 27 February 2020, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe requested that all Japanese elementary, junior high, and high schools close until late March, the end of the school year, to help contain the virus.

The iron ore shipping gauge dropped 99.9% as a result of the outbreak, and the virus has made shipping and logistic operations of mining companies more complicated. Agriculture is also experiencing negative effects from the outbreak, including the Australian dairy industry, fishing industry, wine producers, and meat producers. On 13 February 2020, Rabobank, which specialises in agricultural banking, warned that the agricultural sector had eight weeks for the coronavirus to be contained before facing major losses. Exports were also affected by the outbreak. In May, China—which is Australia's largest trading partner—stopped accepting Australian meat and placed tariffs on Australian barley, likely a punitive response to Australia's call for an investigation into the origin of the global pandemic. The education sector is expected to suffer a US$5 billion loss according to an early government estimate, including costs due to \\"tuition fee refunds, free deferral of study, realignment of teaching calendars and student accommodation costs.\\" The taxpayer is likely to be required to cover the shortfall in education budgets. An estimated 100,000 students were not able to enroll at the start of the semester. Nearly two- thirds of Chinese students were forced to remain overseas due to visa restrictions on travellers from mainland China. Salvatore Babones, associate professor at the University of Sydney, stated that \\"Australia will remain an attractive study destination for Chinese students, but it may take several years for Chinese student numbers to recover\\". ==See also== *Financial market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic *Contactless payment *COVID-19 pandemic- related shortages *Distance learning *Mobile banking *Online banking *Coronavirus Recession == Sources == == References == Economic Category:2020 in economics Category:2020 in international relations Category:Economic history ","title":"Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"id":"63926996","text":"Nicolaas Marinus Hugenholtz (born 1924) is a Dutch physicist.

He died in Los Gatos, CA in 1944. In 1869 he moved with his family to the United States. After attending Andover Newton Theological School he went on to hold several pastorates in the western United States including Oakland, CA, Los Gatos, CA., and Seattle, WA. Whitaker was heavily involved involved in Socialist and Labor organizations in California. He was acquainted with other activists such as Eugene Debs, Upton Sinclair, Jack London, and Fanny Bixby Spencer and spent considerable energy agitating for Socialist causes. To this end, he lectured frequently around California and founded several presses such as The Progressive Publishing Company, U.F.I. Press, and Whitaker and Ray, Co. He was also a progressive reformer of the church. By 1912, he along with members of the Los Gatos Baptist Church, decided to cancel all \\"ritualistic ceremonies\\" and make baptism optional. == Ministry == Whitaker served as a missionary in Mexico from 1887-1888. In 1898, he was appointed Superintendent of State Missions for Northern and Central California and gave sermons in various churches on the west coast. From 1903 through 1908 he was pastor of the 23rd Ave Baptist Church in Oakland, CA. He was also editor of the journal Pacific Baptist. He served as pastor at the Los Gatos Baptist Church in the 1910s. In 1920 he and his family sailed to China to do missionary work. == Activism and socialism == In 1906 Whitaker was accused of Slander for speaking out against Oakland city officials. Whitaker supported various causes, like suffrage and labor. In 1912 Whitaker ran as a Socialist candidate for California's 8th District. In 1917, Whitaker was charged with treason for agitating against the draft and conscription laws. He was jailed along with Reverend Floyd Hardin and Harold Storey, and spent three months in jail. == Works == === Nonfiction === * Cupid and the Cloth [n.d.]. * Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever, 1885. * Johnston of Stanford, .1919. * One woman's worth: The story of Lucretia Watson Taylor, [1913]. * Sharing our Thanksgiving, 1918. * Victory or Peace, 1918. * Why callest thou me good? 1913. * The wickedness of doing nothing: an appeal for positive living, 1913. * The yesterday and today of Socialism [n.d.]. === Fiction === * A California girl: an idyl of married life [n.d.]. * The chamber of silence, 1903. * Made to order, 1902. * A mix-up of souls, 1907. * Smith's Valley; Wanted an original deed; Two of a kind, 1900. * A strong-minded woman, 1907. === Lectures and sermon outlines === * Lectures on Biblical Christology, 1901. * Sermon outline - The city that would not [1909-1910]. * Sermon outline - How big is your God?

It outlived most other Greek dialects that were replaced by the Attic Koine, surviving until the first or second century CE, in part due to the existence of a separate Northwest Doric koine. ==Classification== Ancient Greek dialects per Woodard (2008), with Epirotic included in the dark brown area. The Greek population of Epirus proper (not including colonies founded on or near the coast by southern Greeks) spoke a dialectal variety of Northwest Doric, joining Epirotic with Locrian, Phocian, Delphic, Aenanian, Aetolian, and Acarnian. Doric, including Northwest Doric and its sister branches, may also be called \\"West Greek\\" or \\"North Greek\\". Nevertheless, Epirote lacked some of the features that are described as salient diagnostics of Northwest Doric, including the athematic dative plural -ois, the third person imperative -nton, and the mediopassive participle forms in -ei-. Likewise, the uncontracted Doric -eo- sequence is barely attested in Epirus, because it was usually sidelined by the contraction of -ou--, though it does appear in anthroponyms in Epirus. Méndez Dosuna argued for a distinction of four subgroups within Northwest Doric, in which Epirote, Eastern Locrian, Epizephyrian Locrian and Acarnian were \\"Medial Northwest\\" (on the other hand, the \\"most Northwest\\" were Delphic, Aetolian, Elean, and West Locrian). Dosuna argues that North-West Greece was an area of dialectal convergence that became increasingly homogenous from the fifth century BCE onwards, coinciding with the rise of different and political integration. ==History of study== Epirote is considered to be under-investigated. Speaking in a broad sense of the history of Epirus, as of 2018, a number of advances have been made in the last few decades, largely powered by ongoing progress in archaeological research in both Greece and Southern Albania. However, there is no up-to-date comprehensive work incorporating all the recent archaeological advances, meaning the least outdated summary is Hammond 1967. Likewise, despite newly available epigraphic corpora from Dodona and Bouthroton (modern Butrint), Greek linguist Filos notes that there remains no holistic linguistic account of Epirus at all that extends beyond a \\"non-piecemeal description of the epichoric variety\\", though Filos himself offers a summarized account. In 2013, a collection of over 4000 texts from the Dodona lamellae was published. ==History== left ===Attestation=== Evidence from epigraphy starting in the late Archaic period (sixth to fifth centuries BCE) indicates that people of Epirus proper spoke a dialectal variety of Northwest Doric. On the other hand, southern Greek dialects were spoken by some of the coastal colonies established by southern Greeks, while in the north, there was a language border with Illyrian. There is earlier attestation of texts from the southern Greek colonies on the coast, but these spoke different varieties of Greek (Corinthian in Ambracia, Elean in Pandosia, etc.). The variety manifested in the early texts of Dodona is also not representative of Epirotic Greek. Except for the unrepresentative oracular tablets at Dodona, Epirus was among a set of Greek regions that practically lacked documentation until the Classical period, this set also including Macedonia, Pamphylia, and Aetolia. In terms of early written records, Epirus and the rest of north-west Greece also lagged behind other Northwest-Doric speaking areas, with areas such as Delphi and West Locris providing earlier sources. The (numerous) Northwest Doric oracular tablets from Dodona (the latter of which are indeed Epirotic) are typically short texts written on small lead plates, whose small size caused the text to be written in an elliptic style. ===Origins=== A number of scholars have asserted a possible partial Hellenization of pre-classical Epirus, wherein Greek elites would have engendered a language shift by elite dominance over an originally non-Greek-speaking population, including Nilsson (1909). Cited in Filos (2018)., Crossland (1982), and Kokoszko & Witczak (2009). Cited in Filos (2018). On the other side, Hammond (1982) argued the converse, wherein it was southward and eastward Illyrian expansions that intruded upon an originally Greek Epirus. Filos (2018) notes that due to the limitations of our linguistic knowledge of Epirus during the relevant period, which is entirely lacking except for the onomastic evidence of anthronyms, tribe names, and toponyms, any assumptions either way about which element (Illyrian, Greek) was intrusive is \\"tantamount to plain guesswork\\", but one may reasonably assume a degree of bilingualism did exist without positing which languages were specifically substrate, adstrate or superstrate. The distribution of epigraphic evidence would remain unequally distributed geographically; in later periods, sources still tend to come from Ambracia and Dodona, as well as Bouthrotos. The Corinthian and Elean colonies on the coast were gradually integrated into the emerging pan-Epirote political formations, resulting in increasing linguistic homogenization of the region. ===Hellenistic and Roman periods=== Political situation in the Greek world during the Hellenistic period While the origins of Epirotic Greek are disputed, it is more certain that during the attested period, with its better studied corpora.}}, there was a degree of bilingualism that was likely not symmetrical in nature, and that Epirotic Greek expanded northward beyond the boundaries of Epirus proper, into former Illyrian territory. Though the distribution of texts would remain skewed in favor of Dodona and the coast, the peak of Epirote texts would occur in the late Hellenistic period, when the impact of the supraregional Northwest Doric koina began to be felt. Although the distribution remains skewed, texts from outside Dodona and Ambracia become markedly more common between the third century BCE and the Roman conquest in 167 BCE. The Northwest Doric koina The Northwest Doric koina was a supraregional North-West common variety that that emerged in the third and second centuries BCE, and was used in the official texts of the Aetolian League. It contained a mix of native Northwest Doric dialectal elements and Attic forms. It was apparently based on the most general features of Northwest Doric, eschewing less common local traits. Its rise was driven by both linguistic and non-linguistic factors, with non- linguistic motivating factors including the spread of the rival Attic-Ionic koine after it was recruited by the Macedonian state for administration, and the political unification of a vast territories by the Aetolian League and the state of Epirus. The Northwest Doric koina was thus both a linguistic and a political rival of the Attic-Ionic koina. The Northwest Doric koina was politically linked to the Aetolian league, which had long had a mutually hostile relationship with Epirus. As such, some have argued that Epirotic during the Hellenistic period was marked by a tendency to avoid the use of features that marked an \\"Aetolian\\" identity, such as the use of ἐν + accusative. Coin of the Epirote League, depicting Zeus (left) and a lightning bolt with the word \\"ΑΠΕΙΡΩΤΑΝ\\" – of the Epirotes (right). Replacement by the Attic koine Despite its success in halting the spread of Attic for a time, the Northwest Doric koina would ultimately be a mere intermediary stage before the final Atticization of Epirus. In the third and second centuries BCE we already begin to encounter texts showing increasing influence of the Attic- Ionic koine. Statistical analyses have corroborated that Attic was slowly supplanting the native dialect during the end of this period, while the record also shows texts of Epirote embedded in Attic during this period. The Attic- Ionic koine eventually decisively established itself in Epirus firmly during the first century CE. ==Phonology== Our understanding of Epirote phonology is limited; epigraphic data, glosses, and contemporary sources are often uncorroborated. However the existing evidence from the limited inscriptions is still considered to have certain insights. Epirote shared with Thessalian, Elean and Macedonian an \\"oddity\\" of cases where voiced stops (/b d g/, written <β ð ɣ>) appear to be correspond to Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirates, /bʰ dʰ ɡʰ/. In most Greek, the Proto-Indo-European aspirates were devoiced to voiceless aspirates /pʰ tʰ kʰ/, written <ɸ θ χ> (though these would later become fricatives in Attic Koine around the first century CE). As with Macedonian, this phenomenon is sometimes attributed to non-Greek substrate and adstrate influence, with some linguists attributing such an influence on Epirote to Illyrian. Filos, however, notes, that the attribution of <β>, <ð> and <ɣ> for specifically voiced stops is not secure. Other proposed phonological characteristics based on inscriptions include: * regular apocope in prepositions * no shortening for <ηι> (< -ēϝy-) * early closing of /eː/ > /iː/ * short /i/ > /e/, though Filos notes that the evidence for this is particularly suspect * early dropping of /j/ (<ι>) when it is the second element in diphthongs. * Unlike most other NW Doric varieties, a regular shift of <ɛο> > <ου> Epirote, like Corinthian, belonged to Doris mitior, having an arsenal of seven long vowels and five short vowels. Epirote had a phonemic difference between a long front mid-open vowel /ɛ:/ and a long front mid-close vowel /e:/, and an analogous difference between /ɔ:/ and /o:/. ==Alphabet== Because the earliest scripts from the region of Epirus (not the earliest Epirote scripts) hail from Ambracia, the letters resemble those of Corinth, because Ambracia was founded by Corinthians. Another early example using the Corinthian alphabet is the inquiry of a citizen of Orikos (Orikum), but Filos argues that this is of little use because Orikos is rather far from the center of Epirus. We do not know how many alphabets were in use in Epirus in the sixth to fourth centuries BCE. The diversity of alphabets among the Dodona lamellae merely reflects the diverse origins of the inquirers. Although the earliest oracular sources feature the \\"blue\\" alphabet elsewhere seen in Corinth and Attica, the later instances primarily manifest what would become the local Epirote alphabet, which was a \\"red\\" Euboean system, in which the letter <Ψ> indicated the velar aspirate /kʰ/, which would later become /x/, while /ps/ (for which <Ψ> was used in Attic's \\"blue\\" alphabet) was simply written <ΦΣ>, and represented /ks/. From the end of the fifth century BCE onwards, this local alphabet became increasingly consistent. Because Epirote distinguished between mid-close and mid-open round vowels, was used for /e:/, while the mid-open /ɛ:/ was represented by a vowel letter (despite its resemblance to beta), and was also used for the short front mid vowel /e/. On the other hand, was used for all three mid back vowels, regardless of length or whether they were mid-open or mid-close. For /i/, _was not used, but <ϟ> or variously <Σ> were instead. Many of these characteristics were shared with Corinth, or with Corfu. The Attic alphabet made its appearance in Epirote texts (again) in the fourth century BCE. Over time, it drove all other Greek alphabets, in Epirus and elsewhere, out of usage. ==Morphology, Morphosyntax, Syntax== Epirote features a rather \\"Doric\\" contract future as seen in the third person active plural and the future mediopassive . Whereas the Northwest Doric frequently used ἐν + accusative formations, Epirote preferred εἰς + accusative formations instead. The archaic formation of ἀνά + dative, which is elsewhere found mostly in poetry, has been found to occur a few times in Epirus. Scientific inquiry on the syntax and morphosyntax of Epirote is, to date, too weak in general to make strong statements. ==Language contact== Due to its geographic position and its history, Epirus had an internal linguistic diversity. Epirus' northern regions, such as Chaonia, bordered on southern Illyrian territory, and likely featured bilingualism with many (likely more) Illyrians tending to adopt Greek as well as a second language. Ultimately this would lead to language replacement with Illyrian as substrate in these regions. The extent of Illyrian participation in life in Epirus proper is uncertain; although only about a dozen names in the Dodona corpus are confirmedly Illyrian, onomastics is not necessarily a safe way to ascertain ethnic or linguistic identity in this case. On the Epirote coast, colonies of southern Greek provenance often spoke different dialects of Greek, but their incorporation into Epirote polities brought linguistic homogenization. Epirote also experienced interaction with other NW Doric varieties, as well as Macedonian, as adstrates. The war with Rome, ending in the Roman conquest of Epirus in 167 BCE, featured large-scale destruction and depopulation of Epirus, especially to the south of the Thyamis River. Further destruction was inflicted by king Mithridates VI's Thracian mercenaries in 88-87 BCE as well as during cases (such as 31 BCE) where Epirus served as a theatre for Roman civil wars. Such depopulation was followed by the settlement by Latin speakers. Although the Greek language was not effaced from the region as a result of these changes and continued to demonstrate vitality, language contact effects are demonstrated, including interference, accommodation, code- switching, hybridization, and Greco-Latin interaction in onomastics and funerary inscriptions. Latinized place names became especially common on the coastline; the impact of Latin became especially strong in Southern Illyria's urban centers of Dyrrhachium and Apollonia, and was far heavier than that of Epirus proper. ==Examples== ===Vocabulary=== * ' anchôrixantasEpeiros — Dodona — 4th c.

In the 1980s, and lecturing at the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Sakharov Foundation later in his career. In 1977, he came to Los Angeles to work with Rabbi Marvin Hier who founded the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Together with Rabbi Hier, Rabbi Cooper has met with world leaders, including Pope Benedict XVI, presidents and foreign ministers. In 1990, Cooper gave Public Enemy's Chuck D. a \\"conscious-raising tour of the Holocaust Museum. I think Chuck has an open mind on certain levels, he said. “He may be ignorant of some of our history, but he’s not an anti-Semite.” The tour was in response to Rabbi Cooper's frustration with the American music industry, specifically the fact the record labels were releasing music with lyrics that were bigoted and/or racist. In 1992, and 2003 he helped coordinate international conferences in Paris on antisemitism cosponsored by UNESCO. In 1997, he coordinated the center's international conference, \\"Property and Restitution-The Moral Debt to History\\" in Geneva, Switzerland. He has testified before the United Nations in New York and Geneva, presented testimony at the US Senate, the Japanese Diet, the French Parliament, the OSCE and is a founding member of Israel's Global Forum on Antisemitism. In February 2004, Rabbi Cooper traveled to Khartoum and was the first Jewish leader to meet with the leadership of Sudan including President Al Bashir to discuss human rights and terrorism- related issues. He has met with King Hussein, King Abdullah and Prince Hassan of Jordan, former Indonesian President Wahid and then Grand Mufti of Egypt, Sheik Tantawi. In 2005, Rabbi Cooper participated in an international conference on terrorism convened in Madrid on the first anniversary of the infamous train bombings in Spain's capital. Rabbi Cooper is a regular op-ed contributor to The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Miami Herald, USA Today, the Chicago Tribune, the Globe and Mail, National Post, Le Monde, the Japan Times, The Straits Times and Midstream magazine. He supervises the center's Digital Terrorism and Hate Project. He has written the World Book Encyclopedia's entry on Raoul Wallenberg and edited two major works on this Holocaust hero. Rabbi Cooper has his B.A. and M.S. degrees from Yeshiva University and a Ph.D. from the Jewish University of America. He is a recipient of Yeshiva University’s Bernard Revel Community Service Leadership Memorial Award and of the Orthodox Union’s National Leadership Award. In 2003, Rabbi Cooper served on the transition team for Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 2016, Cooper was honored with the Rabbi Samuel S. and A.

Her parents were Patrick, a general and wholesale draper and Justice of the Peace, and Anne Clancy (née Treanor). She was the 10th child of 12 children, four girls and eight boys. The family moved to Dungannon, and then Belfast, where Boylan attended St Patrick's Girls' Academy. Enjoying studying English, and developing an interest in acting, she doorstepped Arthur Shields during his visit to Belfast pretending to be a journalist. She wrote up the meeting, and it was published in The Irish News. Boylan attended the Municipal Technical College, learning typing and shorthand. She trained as a nurse at Leeds General Infirmary from 1932 to 1936, graduating from the Royal College of Nursing, London. She moved with her parents to Clonliffe Road, Drumcondra, Dublin in 1937 and she successfully auditioned for the Abbey Theatre's School of Acting.There she studied alongside Wilfred Brambell, Valentine Iremonger, Phyllis Ryan, Dan O'Herlihy, and briefly, Maureen O'Hara. == Career == Boylan wrote up a profile of Lennox Robinson, the director of the School, for The Irish Press (30 September 1937). These occasional writing jobs helped to pay her school fees. Robinson chose her as part of a group to create a verse-speaking class, and Boylan appeared as Deirdre in the radio play Deirdre of the sorrows by J. M. Synge on Radio Éireann. She was one of the original members and honorary secretary of the Dublin Verse-Speaking Society, founded in December 1939 by Austin Clarke and Robert Farren. Boylan gave poetry recitals at the Abbey and Peacock theatres, as well as appearing on the Monday night poetry show, Poetry Anthology, on Radio Éireann for 25 years. She met Henry Boylan in Radio Éireann in 1941, and they married on 18 September 1941 in Dublin. They had two daughters, Anna and Catherine, and two sons, Hugo and Peter. She worked as an editorial assistant for Woman's Life, ghost writing an agony aunt column and managing beauty pageants. Boylan was a regular contributor on talk shows and Radio Éireann productions from the 1940s onwards. She wrote as \\"Darina\\" for The Irish Press social column, contributed to The Hibernia Magazine, was the editor of Creation, and wrote for The Irish Times, the Irish Press, the Irish Arts Review and Books Ireland. She published a book on the history of the United Arts Club, All cultivated people: a history of the United Arts Club, in 1988, and a memoir, Gaps of brightness, in 2003.

Perera received his basic officer training at the Officer Training School, Madras and at the Sri Lanka Military Academy. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Rajarata Rifles in 1981. He was transferred to the Gajaba Regiment in 1983, when the Rajarata Rifles was disbanded following a mutiny and the Gajaba Regiment formed from the remaining personal. With the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War, Perera took part in many offensive operations with the Gajaba Regiment including the Vadamarachchi Operation. He was wounded in action in 1984 and was awarded the Desha Putra Sammanaya. His awards include the gallantry medals Weera Wickrama Vibhushanaya, Rana Wickrama Padakkama with two claps, Rana Sura Padakkama with three claps and the Uttama Seva Padakkama.

The story features the recurrent characters Richard Chandos (narrator) and George Hanbury, with their servants Bell and Rowley. Jonathan Mansel does not appear in this book. == Plot == Chandos and Hanbury help Duke Paul to succeed as Prince of the fictional Principality of Reichtenburg in place of the incumbent, in the face of resistance from Duke Johann and Major Grieg. == Background == Commenting in 1958 through his character Boy Pleydell, the author acknowledged resemblances between his work and Anthony Hope's, The Prisoner of Zenda and Rupert of Hentzau, specifically citing this novel and Fire Below. == Critical reception == Blood Royal was as well-received when it appeared in July 1929 as his earlier Chandos books had been, and was re-printed four times within the first six months. Mercer hoped to run the story as a serial in the US publication The Saturday Evening Post, but flatly refused the Post's demand that Chandos should be an American citizen. This was mentioned by Yates in As Berry and I were Saying, along with a discussion with an editor preparing a serialisation of Blood Royal, presumably in a UK publication, where the editor objected to the car being identified as a Rolls-Royce as \\"We don't give advertisements\\". Yates' response was that \\"..there are two kinds of automobiles - one is a Rolls and the other a motor-car. In Blood Royal I'm referring to a Rolls.\\" The editor was reported to have laughed and conceded the point, but no serialisation of Blood Royal is known to have taken place. The original dustjacket included the following quotes - *Star: \\"Thrill, mystery,romance and humour - all are here\\" *Daily Telegraph: \\"The story goes with dash and brilliance.\\" *John o' London's Weekly: \\"For sheer 'go' and excitement Mr. Yates has done nothing better than this story.\\" *Daily Mail - \\"The most striking thing about 'Blood Royal' is the prodigious pace which Mr. Dornford Yates manages to keep up throughout the book.\\" According to Mercer's biographer, AJ Smithers, the author's talent for this type of story was immense.

Three copies survive in the Museo di Capodimonte (n. 201), Rome's Accademia di San Luca and the Galleria nazionale di Parma (n. 313, inscribed with the date \\"MDXX\\", which is probably also the date of the Uffizi work). It has traditionally been identified as a self- portrait, as recorded by an inscription on the reverse. That identification was still current when it appeared in the 1773 Serie degli uomini più illustri nella pittura. It was in Florence at least by the time of Cosimo III and possibly earlier. Later art historians from Ghidiglia Quintavalle and Fagiolo dell'Arco onwards dismissed this identification, particularly since the subject's face does not match more securely-identified self-portraits of the artist such as Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror (Kunsthistorisches Museum). It may instead be a Parmigianino portrait of Bonifacio Gozzadino mentioned by Vasari, or perhaps one of an \\"unknown Bolognese count\\", but there is no definite evidence for either identification. More recently Freedberg (1950) and P. Rossi (1980) have argued in favour of the inscription's authenticity. They compare the painting with drawings which are probable self-portraits, particularly n. 790A in the Devonshire Collection at Chatsworth House (Self- Portrait and Study for the Frescoes at La Steccata), n. 2623 in the Albertina in Vienna (probably the source for the print of Vita di Francesco Mazzuoli by Vasari) and catalogue number 1858-7-24-6 in the British Museum (showing a man with a dog and with an inscription by Popham interpreting it as a self- portrait).

A Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences, Kelly's research interests include mind-brain issues and cognitive neuroscience with a focus on phenomena (e.g. from parapsychology and paranormal) that challenge the current neuroscientific view of mind. Kelly has published peer-works in which he argues for a break from the dominant physicalist view of human mind and nature for a strong dualistic account of mind-brain problem which accepts the post mortem survival of human consciousness, drawing upon empirical evidence from psychical research such as near-death experience, stigmata and mystical experience. His two major works include Irreducible Mind and Beyond Physicalism. == Career == In the 1960s, Kelly helped with social research at Harvard University. He later worked on a computer programming project involving text disambiguation and assigning senses to the words, which resulted in a doctoral dissertation, “A Dictionary-Based Approach to Lexical Disambiguation”. He then became a postdoctoral research fellow in computational linguistics studying models and methods for their relevance to problems in psycholinguistics and cognitive science. In the early 1970s, as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Institute for Parapsychology, Durham, NC, he first formed the conviction about the importance and viability of a psychobiological approach to the study of psi phenomena. His later career involved development of software for studying and analyzing biological data, raising fund for supporting laboratory research in psychophysiology and techniques and tools for electrophysiological research. In the 1990s, as a Research Associate Professor and member of Neuroscience Group at UNC-Chapel Hill, Kelly contributed to EEG imaging techniques and nueroimaging research. Since 2002, Ed. Kelly has been a Research Professor at Department of Psychiatric Medicine, University of Virginia at Charlottesville where he returned to his long-standing interest in mind-brain relations and laboratory studies of altered states of consciousness. == Publications == In 2007, Kelly, along with his wife, Emily Williams Kelly, and Adam Crabtree, Alan Gauld, Michael Grosso, and Bruce Greyson published a major work, titled Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century where they attempt to bridge contemporary cognitive psychology and mainstream neuroscience with \\"rogue phenomena\\", which the authors argue exist in near-death experiences, psychophysiological influence, automatism, memory, genius, and mystical states. They argue for a dualist interpretation of the mind-brain relation in which the brain only acts as a \\"filter\\" or \\"transmitter\\" of consciousness which survives death of the body. In 2015, Kelly, Adam Crabtree, and Paul Marshall published a more theoretical sequel to the Irreducible Mind, titled Beyond Physicalism: Toward Reconciliation of Science and Spirituality in which they seek to understand how the world must be constituted so that the empirical phenomena catalogued in the Irreducible Mind would be possible. == External links == * Edward F.

He was one of the keepers of the King's seal and, for a short time, a Lord Justice of Ireland. ==Birth and origins== Robert was born in Ireland, the eldest son of James Dillon and his wife Eleanor Barnewall. His father was the 1st Earl of Roscommon. His family was Old English and descended from Sir Henry Dillon who came to Ireland with Prince John in 1185. His family held substantial lands in Meath, Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon. Robert's mother, who was also called Helen, was a daughter of Christopher Barnewall of Turvey House, Dublin.

Nothing seems to be known about his daughters. ===First marriage=== In about 1600 Dillon married Margaret Barry. She was a daughter of David FitzDavid de Barry (died 1605), grand-daughter of David de Barry, 5th Viscount Buttevant and sister of David Barry, 1st Earl of Barrymore. His wife's family, the de Barrys, was Old English like his own. With Margaret he had: #James (c. 1605 – 1649), became the 3rd Earl Roscommon; #Lucas, died childless; #David, died an infant. ===Second marriage=== He married secondly Dorothy, fourth daughter of George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon, widow of Sir James Steuart. With Dorothy he had: #Henry (died 1640), died unmarried. ===Third marriage=== He married thirdly Anne, dowager Baroness Folliott, daughter of Sir William Strode (or Stroud). With Anne he had: #Carey (1627–1689), became the 5th Earl Roscommon. ==Career== On 24 January 1620 his father was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Dillon of Kilkenny-West, in the Peerage of Ireland. in a ceremony performed by the Lord Deputy Oliver St. John in the Presence Chamber of Dublin Castle on 25 January. On 5 August 1622 Robert's father was furthered honoured by being made Earl of Roscommon. In consequence of his fathers advancement, Robert, the heir apparent, was styled Lord Kilkenny-West, as a courtesy title from 1622 to 1641. His mother died on 11 October 1628. On 14 July 1634, his father took his seat in the Irish House of Lords. On 26 May 1638 a \\"Robert Lord Dillon\\" was appointed as one of the keepers of the King's seal. It seems that people found that Lord Kilkenny-West was a bit cumbersome as a title and called him Lord Dillon instead. Soon after Lord Deputy Christopher Wandesford's death on 3 December 1640 Charles I appointed Lord Dillon (i.e. Lord Kilkenny-West) together with Sir William Parsons Lords Justices for Ireland, but Dillon was considered to have been too closely associated with Strafford and was soon replaced. John Borlase was chosen as his successor. His father died in March 1641 and he succeeded as the 2nd Earl of Roscommon. ==Death and timeline== Lord Roscommon, as he was finally now, died on 27 August 1642 in Oxmantown, a quarter in Dublin's Northside. { !colspan=3Timeline - !align=\\"left\\"Age!!align=\\"left\\"Date!!align=\\"left\\"Event - 01585, estimateBorn. - 1603, 24 MarAccession of King James I, replacing Queen Elizabeth I. - 1604, NovSister Jane married Christopher Dillon of Ballylaghan, the heir apparent of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon. - 1605, aboutBirth of his eldest son, James. - 1620, 24 JanFather created Baron of Kilkenny-West. - 1622, 5 AugFather elevated to Earl of Roscommon. - 1625, 27 MarAccession of King Charles I, replacing King James I. - 1628, 11 OctHis mother died. - 1634, 14 JulHis father took his seat in the Irish House of Lords. - 1638, 26 MayAppointed one of the Lord Keeper of the seal. - 1640, DecAppointed one of the Lord Justices of Ireland. - 1641, MarSucceeded his father as the 2nd Earl of Roscommon. - 1641, 12 MayStrafford beheaded. - 1642, 27 AugDied in Oxmantown, Dublin. } ==Notes and references== * – 1603 to 1642 * – Abdy to Hutchinson (for Dillon) * – Ibbetson to Zouche (for Roscommon) * (for Strafford) * – N to R (for Roscommon) * - Scotland and Ireland * – Viscounts (for Dillon) * (for his wife, Margaret Barry) * (for Table of reigns) * – From the Rebellion to the Cessation * ==External links== *Genealogy of Robert Dillon 2nd Earl of Roscommon on The Peerage website Category:1642 deaths Category:16th-century Irish people Category:17th-century Irish people Category:Earls of Roscommon Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Robert Dillon, 2nd Earl Roscommon"},{"id":"63927719","text":"Natalie Christensen (born 1966 in Owensboro, Kentucky) is an American photographer based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States. She has exhibited her photographs in the U.S. and internationally, including Santa Fe, New York, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, London, Berlin and Barcelona. ==Education== Christensen received her BA Psychology from Western Kentucky University and her MSW Social Work from the University of Kentucky in 1991. ==Career in Psychotherapy== A licensed clinical social worker, Christensen worked as a psychotherapist for over 25 years. She was particularly influenced by the theories of depth psychologist Carl Jung. ==Photography== The influence of her previous career in psychotherapy is evident in her photographs, as shadows and psychological metaphors are favored subjects. In Santa Fe, Christensen's work is inspired by commonplace architecture and streetscapes. Choosing to shoot in locations that may be viewed as uninspiring or even visually off-putting, she finds her images around shopping centers, apartment complexes and office parks. The challenge for her is to discover something transcendent hidden in plain sight. Scenes are stripped to color fields, geometry and shadow.

Cover Girl Strip Poker is the original Danish title; it was retitled Cover Girl Poker outside of Denmark in the rest of Europe, and the title was subsequently reverted to Cover Girl Strip Poker for the European CDTV and CD-ROM DOS releases. Emotional Pictures was a subsidiary of Danish company InterActive Vision A/S. Cover Girl Strip Poker received negative to mixed reviews from critics; many reviews criticized Strip Pokers 'poor' digitized graphics, 'bad' AI, and several reviews criticized the game's sexual content, calling it 'unappealing' or 'sad'. While other versions of the game received more mixed reviews, reviews of the Commodore 64 version were universally negative. Some reviews criticized Strip Poker as sexist, with one magazine calling it \\"an affront to the female species\\". In addendum to this, Strip Poker has a legal disclaimer stating that the game is \\"Not manufactured, distributed or endorsed by any of the models appearing in the product\\"; a model featured in the game later stated that she was not informed what the video footage/photoshoot was for, and several models did not receive pay for their work. ==Gameplay== Cover Girl Strip Pokers graphics across several ports (as shown here in the Amiga version) were criticized by many reviewers. Reviews of the Commodore 64 version (pictured) of Strip Poker were universally negative. Cover Girl Strip Poker is played as five-card strip poker; the player plays against an AI opponent, and may choose between eight models. Strip Poker has a multiplayer mode wherein up to three people may play against a single AI opponent at once, with each player having their own pool of money to bet with. Each time the AI loses $2,000, a digitized female model removes one item of clothing in video footage presented on the screen of a digitized cinema; different models display varying levels of nudity. Each player is dealt a hand of five cards, and may replace any number of those cards with different cards from the deck in order to obtain a winning hand. Both the player and the AI are given $2,500 to bet with, the maximum bet being $999, and there are two rounds of betting: one before the changing of cards and one after. If the player's hand is better than their opponent's, the player wins the betted money, and the cards are shuffled and both players are given new hands of cards. The game is coded so that after winning several hands, subsequent hands are harder to win. Upon starting the game, the player is prompted to select a language; Cover Girl Strip Poker has releases in Danish, Swedish, English, French, German and Italian. The player may zoom in during the game's nude scenes. In Cover Girl Strip Poker, four of the eight models in-game have video footage alongside the standard still images; the frame rate and graphic quality of these videos differs between versions of the game. ===Version differences=== In the Commodore 64 version, there are six possible opponents as opposed to eight; Signe Andersen and Sofia Bratlund are missing from this version.Cover Girl Poker (1992). Commodore 64. Storm. United Software. Scene: Opponent selection. As opposed to other versions, which require the AI to lose $2,000 multiple times for the game to show sexual content, in the Commodore 64 version of the game, only once is required. In the CDTV and CD-ROM DOS versions, the models' in-game banter with the player is voice acted, and the CDTV version also adds eleven music tracks. The CDTV version of Cover Girl Strip Poker has fifteen minutes of full motion video footage. In the Commodore 64 version of Strip Poker, the game's graphics are predominantly monochrome. ==Development== Tabloid magazine Daily Sport worked with Emotional Pictures in the development of Cover Girl Strip Poker in that models who have appeared in Daily Sport appear in the game: famous UK page 3 model Maria Whittaker, Amanda Godden, Minnie Champ (credited in-game as 'Ginny Champ'), Donna Ewin, , Sofia Bratlund, Signe Andersen, and a woman credited only as 'Jane'.Cover Girl Strip Poker (1991). DOS. Emotional Pictures. Emotional Pictures. Scene: Credits. Cover Girl Strip Poker was exhibited at the Arets Amiga Expo in Copenhagen, Denmark in March 1992, and Trine Michelsen promoted the game at Emotional Pictures' booth while dressed in lingerie, singing karaoke with attendees. Danish gaming magazine Det Nye COMputer interviewed Trine Michelsen, who stated that she was not informed what the video footage and photos were for, and that other models were never paid for their work; she stated that she was paid 1000 Danish krone (equivalent to around US$265 in 1992), and that \\"It was not at all clear what it would be for, and I did it as a favor [for someone I knew]. Apparently some of the other models weren't paid at all.\\" COMputer briefly interviewed Kenneth Bernholm, the CEO of InterActive Vision A/S, the parent company of Emotional Pictures, to ask how much the models were paid, and Bernholm stated that \\"You can ask, but you won't get an answer\\". Cover Girl Strip Poker has a disclaimer explicitly stating that the game is \\"Not manufactured, distributed or endorsed by any of the models appearing in the product\\"; Amiga Power questioned the legality of this disclaimer. Due to standards for sexual content as set by The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment and the Video Standards Council, the CDTV version of Cover Girl Strip Poker was labelled with a BBFC 18 certificate; French gaming magazine Joystick speculated that On-Line Entertainment, the publisher of the European CDTV version, was intentionally seeking a mature rating for the game for the sake of publicitity. The CDTV release of Cover Girl Strip Poker is compatible with the Amiga CD32. According to Computer and Video Games magazine, ports of Cover Girl Poker were planned for the Atari ST and ZX Spectrum, but these were never released. A demo of the Amiga version of Cover Girl Strip Poker was featured on the cover disk of issue one, volume eight of Danish gaming magazine Det Nye COMputer, and a demo of the DOS version was released on the cover disk of issue 31 of Zero. Cover Girl Strip Pokers full motion video was recorded in Malmö, Sweden. The Danish, French, German, and English narration was recorded by Workstation 1, which also translated the game into French. The Swedish narration was recorded by Niklas Persson, who also performed the Swedish translation. Strip Poker was translated into German by Thomas Schmidt.Cover Girl Strip Poker (1991). Amiga. Unreal. Storm. Scene: Credits. To promote the release of Cover Girl Poker, The Sales Curve ran a contest asking the question \\"What is the weekend equivalent of the Daily Sport?\\"; ten randomly selected entrants who mailed in the correct answer of \\"Sunday Sport\\" received an apron with inflatable breasts attached. ===Title inconsistencies=== Cover Girl Strip Poker was originally titled as such in Denmark, and was retitled Cover Girl Poker everywhere else in Europe for the Amiga, Commodore 64 and DOS releases, and is referred to by several different names by different publications; the front cover and the title screen of the Cover Girl Poker version of the game contradict each other as well; the cover art of the Commodore 64 version titles the game Cover Girl Poker, while the in-game title screen in all versions of the game gives the original title of Cover Girl Strip Poker. Other titles given to the game by reviewers include CoverGirl Poker, and Daily Sports Cover Girl Strip Poker or Daily Sport Cover Girl Poker due to the game's affiliation with tabloid magazine Daily Sport, although the title Cover Girl Strip Poker is overall the most commonly used. The European CDTV and CD-ROM DOS releases of Cover Girl Poker were retitled to the original title of Cover Girl Strip Poker. ===Alternative publishers=== Cover Girl Strip Poker was originally developed and published by Emotional Pictures, which was a subsidiary of Danish company InterActive Vision A/S; Strip Poker was the only game developed or published by Emotional Pictures. The game was then re-released by multiple different publishers in different countries. Amiga In Germany, an Amiga version was developed by The Sales Curve and published by United Software, and an alternate release was developed and self-published by Storm; both German releases cost 'around 80' Deutschmark in 1992.

DOS The DOS version of Cover Girl Strip Poker was published by The Sales Curve in Italy, and was released on \\" and \\" floppy disks.

In Spain, the CD-ROM DOS version of Cover Girl Strip Poker was published by Proein S.A in 1994. In Germany, the CD-ROM DOS version of Cover Girl Strip Poker was developed by Leisure Soft and published by Storm. In addendum to the version released by Storm, an alternate version was released by On-Line Entertainment, the original publisher of the CD-ROM DOS version, which, according to PC Joker, was due to the Storm version being 'of poor quality'. The German version released by Storm cost 'around 130' Deutschmark in 1994, while the release by On-Line Entertainment cost 'around 80–89' Deutschmark in 1993. In the German On-Line Entertainment CD-ROM DOS release, the voice acting is re- dubbed in German. Commodore 64 The Commodore 64 version of Cover Girl Poker was published by The Sales Curve in Europe, Italy, and Germany. In addendum to the version released by The Sales Curve in Germany, an alternate version of the Commodore 64 release was developed by Storm and published by United Software.

The Commodore 64 version of Cover Girl Poker was released in May 1992 in Europe, and was published by The Sales Curve; it was released both on cassette tapes and floppy disks; the cassette version cost £10.99 at launch, and the floppy disk version cost £15.99. CDTV The CDTV version of Cover Girl Strip Poker was published in Denmark by InterActive Vision A/S, the parent company of Emotional Pictures; it cost 395 Danish krone in 1991. The European CDTV release was published by On-Line Entertainment, and it cost 'around £29.99-£34.99' in 1993. ==Reception== Cover Girl Strip Poker received largely negative reviews from critics, although some reviewer's scores may not reflect this; the Italian version of Zzap! gave Strip Poker an overall score of 67%, but was thoroughly critical of the game – similarly, PC Zone gave the game 40%, but called the graphics \\"so badly digitized that what you end up looking at is a lurid collection of flesh colored smudges\\", and summarized the game as \\"appallingly bad\\". While some reviewers praised Strip Pokers digitized graphics, the vast majority of reviewers heavily criticized them; the UK version of Zzap! stated that \\"[you're hardly] able to recognise the blobby mess as human, let alone a nude woman!\\", and German magazine PC Player called them \\"so heavily overexposed that you begin to become worried for the health of your monitor.\\" Some critics expressed that Strip Pokers sexual content is 'fundamentally unattractive', PC Zone expressed that the graphics are only appealing \\"if you're a Pollock fan\\", and PC Joker criticized the game's voice acting as \\"very clinical and sterile\\", and stated that it \\"suffocates any eroticism to be had.\\" While other versions of the game received more mixed reviews, the reception of the Commodore 64 version was universally negative; unique to the C64 version, there is a screen flickering glitch that was criticized by some reviewers; the Italian version of Zzap! called it 'absurd and annoying', while Zzap! UK summarised Strip Poker overall as a \\"purile excuse for a game\\". Cover Girl Strip Pokers gameplay was heavily criticized by many critics; many reviewers expressed that Strip Poker was too easy, as the game's AI is 'bad at poker', which also contributed to the game's 'lack of longevity'. Despite the game's sexual content, many reviewers noted Strip Poker as feeling as though it would appeal only to adolescents who 'shouldn't be able to access it to begin with'; Amiga Computing questioned whether \\"anyone outside of puberty [would] really pay this kind of money for this kind of sad product?\\", and PC Zone further criticized Strip Poker as only being exciting \\"if you've never seen a naked woman before\\". Several reviews furthermore called Strip Poker 'sad', with Amiga Power summarising it as \\"A sad game, made even sadder by the fact that you could probably buy a couple of porno mags for the same price!\\" Many reviews criticized Cover Girl Strip Poker as 'overpriced', with those that did stating that one could buy 'several pornographic magazines with stronger sexual content' for the same price as the game. Amiga Computing and Zzap! UK criticized Strip Poker as sexist; Computing called it \\"an affront to the female species\\", and a critic from Zzap! called it a \\"sexist concept\\" and bluntly stated that \\"If some sexually frustrated dickhead wants to waste twelve quid on this tripe that's his problem\\". In an article by Amiga Computing strongly condemning the rise of digital pornography, Cover Girl Strip Poker was given as an example of a game that while \\"perfectly legal\\", is \\"thankfully largely absent from the commercial software [market]\\". Despite many critical reviews, some publications praised Cover Girl Strip Poker; Spanish gaming magazine pcmanía expressed that it \\"makes the most of\\" the capabilities of the CD-ROM medium, and praised Strip Pokers animations as being \\"fluid and quite attractive\\". Italian gaming magazine Videogame & Computer World gave Strip Poker a significant overall score of 97.3%, similarly stating that the game \\"[makes] optimal use of the graphical capabilities of your [graphics] card\\", and commended Strip Poker as \\"a definitive product in its genre\\". Amiga Mania praised Strip Pokers \\"good\\" digitised graphics, as well as its gameplay, calling it \\"one of the best [poker games of this type]\\", and further stating that \\"If this is the sort of game you wish to play then you'll have to go a long way before you find one as good as Cover Girl.\\" Many reviews praised the inclusion of UK page 3 girl Maria Whittaker; Serbian computer magazine Svet Kompjutera called her \\"particularly spellbinding\\". Italian gaming magazine Videogame & Computer World gave the DOS version of Cover Girl Strip Poker a highly positive review – an outlier compared to Strip Pokers many negative to mixed reviews – giving it an overall score of 97.3%, and calling the game's music \\"decidedly superb\\" and \\"atmospheric\\", noting this to be in contrast to other poker video games which have 'poor' sound. Computer World praised Strip Pokers models, expressing that they have \\"sparkling physical qualities\\" and are \\"extremely hot\\", and further praised the game's graphics as \\"[making] optimal use of the graphical capabilities of your [graphics] card\\". Computer World praised Strip Pokers dialogue, expressing that it \\"[gives] an engaging personality to an already intriguing game in of itself\\", furthermore calling Strip Poker \\"a definitive product in its genre\\". German gaming magazine PC Player gave the CD-ROM DOS version of Cover Girl Strip Poker an overall score of 6%, expressing that they wanted to stop playing the game as soon as possible, and strongly criticized the game as being \\"on the border of mental cruelty.\\" PC Player criticized Strip Pokers dubbed German voice acting, stating that \\"the German voice acting has a sluggishness that will leave you at half-mast ... Another thing that torments me: the women mumble everything\\", and further called the game's 'unattractive' dialogue \\"a festival of unintentional hilarity.\\" PC Player heavily criticized Strip Pokers \\"blurry\\" graphics, stating that \\"The graphics are so heavily overexposed that you begin to become worried for the health of your monitor\\", and further criticized the game's full motion video as \\"looking like a silent movie\\". PC Player criticized Strip Pokers gameplay, calling the game's AI and controls \\"extremely sluggish\\", and called it \\"just as lousy as every other strip poker game\\". PC Player summarised the overall design of the CD-ROM version of Cover Girl Strip Poker as \\"so disastrously bad that it's impressive.\\" ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Cover Girl Strip Poker at Hall of Light Amiga database * Category:1991 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Card game video games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Commodore CDTV games Category:DOS games Category:Erotic video games Category:Europe-exclusive video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Poker video games Category:Video games developed in Denmark ","title":"Cover Girl Strip Poker"},{"id":"63927771","text":"Justin Connor Foscue (born March 2, 1999) is an American professional baseball second baseman in the Texas Rangers organization.

He set up People's War Games. He was a draft resister, and activist in the Vietnam anti-war movement. He became interested in wargames when his school friend, David D. Friedman taught him how to play Tactics II. Radey related how Friedman and himself wrote to Charles S. Roberts claiming that they had found a first turn winning strategy foreach of the two sides. Roberts replied that their interpretation of the rules was valid. He later moved to Merced, California where he graduated in 1964. Jack also developed an early interest in politics: his mother's family were refugees from the Nazi regime in Germany. He was influenced by both the Civil Rights Movement and the Cuban Revolution, and went to work for the Communist Party of the United States of America both as a chauffeur/body guard for Gus Hall as well as for their education department. In 1964 he went to the University of California in Berkeley where he was involved with the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, getting arrested during the Sproul Hall sit-in. Radey's political sympathies influenced his decision to publish his first game Korsun Pocket, which dealt with the Soviet Union's Red Army's victory at the Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket. When interviewed by Fire & Movement he denied that his sympathies made his game bias, but rather condemned writers such as Paul Carell and Simulations Publications, Inc. for bias. He argued that the role of a wargame designer was to \\"teach something real about history\\" and said he hoped that the wargaming hobby would \\"promote peace not war and treat history with the respect it deserves\\". Radey also said that he supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan which had started at the end of 1979. ==Games== The following games by Radey were published by People's War Games: * 1979 Korsun Pocket: Little Stalingrad on the Dnepr – January 25th to February 17th, 1944 * 1982 Black Sea Black Death * 1983 Kirovograd * 1983 Aachen * 1985 Duel for Kharkov * 1997 Operation Spark: the Relief of Leningrad 1943 ==Books== * The Defense of Moscow 1941: The Northern Flank (with Charles Sharp) (2012) ==Reference== Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:American communists Category:American game designers Category:Board game designers ","title":"Jack Radey"},{"id":"63927834","text":"Baidyanath Misra was an Indian economist, educationist, and administrator from the state of Odisha.

It was written by Kurt Sutter, the original series creator and directed by Paris Barclay. It originally aired in the United States on September 6, 2011. This episode marks the first appearance of Rockmond Dunbar (Lt. Eli Roosevelt) and Ray McKinnon (Lincoln Potter) ==Plot== Jax Teller and five other members of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original chapter (SAMCRO) are released from prison after serving 14 months for federal weapons charges. They return to their hometown of Charming, California where they are disturbed by the sight of signs for a new real estate development in their quiet town, spearheaded by the town's new mayor Jacob Hale Jr. and Elliott Oswald, whose land was seized for the project under eminent domain. On their way into town, they encounter the town's new sheriff, Eli Roosevelt, who together with Assistant U.S. Attorney Lincoln Potter has convened a secret task force to shut down the club's gunrunning operation. The parolees reunite with their families, including Jax's girlfriend Doctor Tara Knowles, who gave birth to a son, Thomas, while Jax was imprisoned. Jax proposes to Tara, and reveals his desire to leave the Sons of Anarchy, fearing that staying with the club will send him back to prison or to an early grave. SAMCRO's president Clay Morrow resolves to stop the new housing development, and sends his wife and Jax's mother Gemma Teller Morrow to enlist the help of retired Police Chief Wayne Unser, who is severely depressed and dealing with advanced cancer with little outside help. Several SAMCRO members deliberately antagonize the police tailing them to keep the police from following Clay and Jax, who meet with their gun suppliers in the Russian mob to broker a new deal. Opie Winston and fiancée Lyla get married in a ceremony on an Indian reservation. During the wedding, Jax and Clay kill Russian mob boss Victor Putlova, while other members seize the Russian's guns and use them to wipe out the rest of the mob. Meanwhile, in Stockton State Prison, imprisoned SAMCRO member Otto Delaney murders a Russian prisoner who shanked Jax during his incarceration. ==Reception== IGN gave \\"Out\\" an 8.5/10.0 rating, stating: \\"With a hint of things to come, the Hamlet-esque storyline that began in the pilot episode also reared its head when Gemma found the note Maureen Ashby sent home with Jax last season referring to details about his father that he doesn't know yet. Since this was one of the things that hooked me from the beginning of the show, I am looking forward to learning more about the truth of John Teller's death. If Tara's fear after reading Maureen's letters and Gemma's panic that Jax will find out are anything to go by, it is going to be big. \\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/07/sons-of-anarchy-out-review Zach Handler of The AV Club gave \\"Out\\" a B+ rating, stating; \\"All in all, it’s a well-paced hour-plus of television, and it’s great to see everyone back to doing what they do best. (In the case of former sheriff and permanent friend of the Sons Unser, what he does best appears to be “suffering.”) There are some clunky lines of dialogue, and the urgency level is low, but if “Out” has a problem, it's that this is a very safe episode. There isn't really anything here that's all that shocking or intense—there are twists, but even the twists seem the usual routine.\\"https://tv.avclub.com/sons-of-anarchy-out-1798169517 ==References== Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Sons of Anarchy episodes ","title":"Out (Sons of Anarchy)"},{"id":"63927988","text":"Arabella Advisors is a Washington, D.C.-based for-profit company that advises left-leaning donors and nonprofits about where to give money and serves as the hub of a well-funded politically liberal \\"dark money\\" network. It was founded by former Clinton administration appointee Eric Kessler. Organizations incubated by and affiliated with Arabella Advisors include the Sixteen Thirty Fund, the New Venture Fund, the Hopewell Fund, and the Windward Fund. These groups have been active in various efforts to oppose the Trump administration and to organize opposition to numerous Republican politicians and policies. Between 2013 and 2018, these groups reported raising around $2.3 billion and spending $1.8 billion. Arabella related entities have spent over $1 billion to fund liberal activist and interest groups since President Donald Trump took office. Because of the way they are legally structured, Arabella Advisors and its affiliated groups are not required to disclose their donors, and they have not opted to do so. ==Structure and funding== Arabella Advisors and its affiliated entities utilize tax regulations in which groups who use a fiscal sponsorship arrangement do not have to file a Form 990 with the Internal Revenue Service. Using \\"pass-through\\" arrangements, funding is passed from one organization to another, making it difficult to trace where a donor's money ends up. In 2018, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, the New Venture Fund, the Hopewell Fund, and the Windward Fund had combined revenue of $635 million. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2018 the Sixteen Thirty Fund had \\"thirteen multi-million dollar secret donors.\\" One donor gave $51.7 million to the group in 2018, while another donor gave $26.7 million and a third gave $10 million. The group is not required by law to reveal its donors and it has not disclosed who its funders are. Known donors to the group include Nick Hanauer, the American Federation of Teachers, and the Wyss Foundation. Michael Bloomberg gave $250,000 to a super PAC linked to the Sixteen Thirty Fund, and Democratic donor group Democracy Alliance, whose members include billionaire George Soros, has recommended that donors give generously to the Sixteen Thirty Fund. According to Politico, the Sixteen Thirty Fund's activities are \\"a sign that Democrats and allies have embraced the methods of groups they decried as 'dark money' earlier this decade, when they were under attack from the money machines built by conservatives including the Kochs\\". ==The Sixteen Thirty Fund== The Sixteen Thirty Fund is a liberal \\"dark money\\" nonprofit headquartered in Washington D.C. that had revenue of $143.8 million in 2018. That year, the group spent $141 million on more than 100 left-leaning and Democratic causes, making it a large source of money for nonprofits pushing a variety of changes to state and federal law. The Sixteen Thirty Fund supports Democratic lawmakers and candidates and criticizes Republicans. The group spent money opposing the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and other Trump judicial nominees and supporting various ballot measures. The Sixteen Thirty Fund was behind several groups that ran issue advocacy ads to benefit Democrats during the 2018 midterms. The group also funded Demand Justice, which spent millions of dollars on ads attacking Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Sixteen Thirty Fund and New Venture Fund \\"have fiscally sponsored at least 80 of their own groups, bankrolling those entities in a way that leaves almost no paper trail.\\" The Sixteen Thirty Fund was active in the battle for the House of Representatives in 2018, assisting \\"Democrats trying to seize back power after Trump's rise.\\" According to Politico, \\"The election featured dozens of Democratic candidates who decried the influence of money in politics on the campaign trail.\\" The Sixteen Thirty Fund operates under dozens of different trade names with titles like Arizonans United for Health Care, Floridians for a Fair Shake, Michigan Families for Economic Prosperity, North Carolinians for a Fair Economy. These groups have collectively spent millions of dollars to pressure Republican members of Congress on their stances on health care and economic issues through advertising and activism. The Sixteen Thirty Fund spent almost $11 million dollars in the 2018 Colorado elections on ballot measures, lobbying, and Democratic super PACs. In 2020, the fund gave half a million dollars to the group Colorado Families First to support a proposed ballot initiative requiring paid family leave in the state. ==New Venture Fund== The New Venture Fund had revenue of $405 million in 2018, up from $350 million annually in the three preceding years. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the New Venture Fund \\"has fiscally sponsored at least 80 groups and acted as a pass-through agency funneling millions of dollars in grants for wealthy donors to opaque groups with minimal disclosure.\\" ==Projects and funding recipients == ===Demand Justice=== Demand Justice is a courts-focused group headed by former Hillary Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon. The group spent millions of dollars opposing Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. The group \\"projected a video of Christine Blasey Ford accusing Kavanaugh of assault on the side of a truck outside a Washington gala where Kavanaugh was speaking.\\" ===Fix the Court=== The New Venture Fund provides all of the funding for Fix the Court, a judicial advocacy group that seeks reform of the U.S. federal court system. When Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, Fix the Court bought several Internet domain names related to Kavanaugh and redirected them to websites including End Rape On Campus, the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, and the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. Fix the Court's executive director, Gabe Roth, said he purchased and redirected the websites because he believed the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh and by Anita Hill against Clarence Thomas. ===Defend American Democracy=== Defend American Democracy spent six figures on television advertisements pressuring Republican members of Congress to vote to impeach President Donald Trump for what they called \\"abusing his office and risking national security for his own gain.\\" This group \\"primarily targets swing-district Republicans, prominently features military veterans in its ads and presents itself as a veterans group to local media outlets.\\" The Center for Responsive Politics reported that \\"A veterans group urging Republican lawmakers to 'put country over politics' amid the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is the project of a well-funded liberal 'dark money' network.\\" Defend American Democracy's advertisements contained disclaimers that they were \\"paid for by a group called Protect the Investigation. But Protect the Investigation doesn't legally exist — it's one of dozens of fictitious names registered by the Sixteen Thirty Fund.\\" ===The Hub Project=== The Hub Project is an initiative that passes on funding to and coordinates 14 groups out of a single office in Washington D.C., \\"with the goal of battering Republicans for their health care and economic policies during the midterm elections.\\" The Hub Project is run by Obama administration official and public relations specialist Leslie Dach and former Center for American Progress political strategist Arkadi Gerney. The Hub Project \\"set up an array of affiliate groups around the country, many with vaguely sympathetic names like Keep Iowa Healthy, New Jersey for a Better Future and North Carolinians for a Fair Economy. The Hub Project then used them to mobilize volunteers and run advertising on policy issues against Republican members of Congress many months before the election.\\" ===America Votes=== The Sixteen Thirty Fund gave America Votes, which describes itself as \\"the coordination hub of the progressive community\\", $27 million in 2018. The $27 million grant was nearly twice the amount America Votes had previously ever raised in a single year. ===Ballot measures=== The Sixteen Thirty Fund urged passage of a Nevada ballot measure promoting automatic voter registration and a Michigan redistricting ballot measure. The group also supported a Florida constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to felons and minimum wage increases in Arkansas, Missouri, and other states. The way the groups structure their funding creates \\"an incomplete picture of where support for candidates and ballot initiatives are coming from\\" and allows these groups to \\"avoid public scrutiny by registering trade names to carry out their work. The groups pose as grassroots activist organizations... while being connected to much larger organizations.\\" They adopt 'trade names' meaning voters have little way of knowing who is controlling or funding the organizations until after an election is over. In a 2018 ballot measure campaign in Michigan, a Sixteen Thirty Fund donor group didn't report a \\"trade name\\" they had used in a campaign \\"until 12 days after voters went to the ballots.\\" ===League of Conservation Voters=== The Sixteen Thirty Fund gave $8 million to the League of Conservation Voters in 2018. ===ACRONYM and the Courier Newsroom=== In 2018, the New Venture Fund gave $250,000 to ACRONYM, described by the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) as \\"a liberal dark money group with an affiliated super PAC called PACRONYM.\\" As of 2019, ACRONYM was the full owner of Courier Newsroom, a digital for-profit media company which publishes \\"websites that appear to be free-standing local news outlets\\" but that are \\"actually part of a coordinated effort with deep ties to Democratic political operatives.\\" According to the CRP, \\"Courier has faced scrutiny for exploiting the collapse of local journalism to spread 'hyperlocal partisan propaganda.'\\" In 2018, the Sixteen Thirty Fund \\"sponsored social media pages and digital operations for five pseudo local news outlets.\\" These outlets appeared to be independent but ran nearly identical digital ads. Associated Facebook pages \\"gave the impression of multiple free-standing local news outlets with unique names and disclaimers...But the sponsors of those ads are merely fictitious names used by the Sixteen Thirty Fund.\\" The Sixteen Thirty Fund is also tied to Supermajority News, whose associated super PAC, Democracy PAC, was created by George Soros in 2019. Democracy PAC gave $1.75 million to PACRONYM, the super PAC arm of ACRONYM. ACRONYM gained notoriety as the majority owner of Shadow Inc., a political technology company whose software failed during the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. ===Coronavirus pandemic=== In 2020, the Sixteen Thirty Fund was behind a number of groups that spent millions of dollars on advertisements attacking President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Arabella Advisors aimed to raise between $8 million and $10 million for the Trusted Elections Fund in case the coronavirus pandemic leads to foreign hacking of voting systems, violence, or contested election results. ==Editing of Wikipedia page== In June 2020, Arabella came under scrutiny for hiring a paid editor to request edits to their Wikipedia page, with the edit request being reported by multiple news sources. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies based in Washington, D.C.

It is the final resting place of businessman John S. McMillin, his wife and children, and one of the family's employees. The design of the mausoleum incorporates numerous instances of symbolism, some of it Masonic in nature. ==Background and construction== Afterglow Vista serves as the final resting place of John S. McMillin and several members of his family. During his life, McMillin was a lawyer, businessman and political figure. Born in Indiana in 1855, McMillin attended DePauw University, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and served as the fraternity's first Grand Consul, or international president. In 1884, McMillin moved with his wife and son from Indiana to Washington Territory, where he became the owner of Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company. He was also an ardent Freemason. Six years before he died, McMillin ordered for Afterglow Vista to be built. Construction was completed in 1936, the year of McMillin's death, and cost $30,000. ==Design== The mausoleum is located in a wooded area, and can be accessed by following a trail through a set of gates topped with the words \\"Afterglow Vista\\". The mausoleum itself consists of an open-air rotunda with a limestone table in its center. Around the table are several stone chairs for each member of the McMillin family, inside each of which are hollow niches containing the cremated ashes of the family members. Inscribed on the backs of the chairs are the corresponding names of each individual. There are numerous instances of Masonic symbolism incorporated into the mausoleum's design. Surrounding the stone table and chairs are six columns, along with one intentionally broken column. The broken column is meant to symbolize the concept that \\"death breaks the column of any man's life\\", or alternately, to represent the idea of unfinished work in one's life. The steps leading to the stone table and chairs represent \\"stages of life, orders in architecture, the human senses, and the liberal arts and sciences.\\" Afterglow Vista has been called a \\"Masonic landmark\\". The mausoleum's care is monitored by the Sigma Chi fraternity's Monuments and Memorials Commission. ==Interments== Afterglow Vista serves as the final resting place of John S. McMillin, his wife Louella Hiett, their sons John Hiett McMillin (born and died 1878), Fred Hiett McMillin (1880 – 1922), and Paul Hiett McMillin (1886 – 1961), and their daughter Dorothy Hiett McMillin (1894 – 1980). Additionally, the cremated ashes of Adah Beeny (also spelled Ada Beane), who served as a caretaker of the McMillin children or as John S. McMillin's personal secretary, are interred in John Hiett McMillin's crypt. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==Further reading== * Category:Mausoleums in the United States Category:Monuments and memorials in Washington (state) ","title":"Afterglow Vista"},{"id":"63928125","text":"Jessie Lloyd O'Connor was a journalist, social reformer and political activist. She worked as a reporter for Federated Press. O'Connor served and supported numerous progressive organizations, including the American League Against War and Fascism and the ACLU. ==Family and Early Life== Jessie Lloyd, journalist and social activist, was born in Winnetka, Illinois on February 14, 1904, the daughter of William Bross Lloyd, writer and socialist, and Lola Maverick Lloyd, pacifist and founder of the U.S. section of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). O'Connor's grandfather was Henry Demarest Lloyd, muckraking journalist and author of Wealth Against Commonwealth (1894), an exposé of Standard Oil. Her family's strong tradition of democratic socialism provided the foundation of a political education that was augmented by a constant stream of visiting radicals and reformers, including Jane Addams, Rosika Schwimmer, and John Reed. In 1915 Lloyd accompanied her mother to Europe aboard Henry Ford's Peace Ship. ==Education and Career== After earning an A.B. in economics from Smith College in 1925, Lloyd visited London where she witnessed a confrontation between police and strikers during the British General Strike. Inaccurate news reports of the incident confirmed her parents' contention that mainstream press accounts of the poor were untrustworthy. A short stint working in a Paris factory reinforced her desire to provide a corrective to slanted news coverage by reporting events herself. Lloyd contributed stories to newspapers in the United States while working as a correspondent for the London Daily Herald in Geneva (1926) and Moscow (1926–28). From Moscow, she also sent stories to the Federated Press, a labor wire service in the United States. From 1929 to 1935 Lloyd worked as a reporter for the Federated Press in the United States. She was sent to Gastonia, North Carolina in 1929 to cover the National Textile Workers Union's attempt to organize the Loray mill. She wrote a pamphlet on the strike, Gastonia: A Graphic Chapter in Southern Organization (1930). Early in the Depression O'Connor wrote stories about the unemployed in New York City. Her exposure to the plight of the jobless under capitalism and the activities of the Communist Party on their behalf fostered an appreciation for Communists' courage and dedication. Over time she became disenchanted with the Party, finding it doctrinaire and fraught with internecine battles. Though she declined to join, O'Connor never became part of the anticommunist camp within the American left. In 1957 she wrote of her accord with communist aims of \\"world peace, race brotherhood, [and] equality for women\\" but added that she \\"could not favor dictatorship of the proletariat or trust anybody with power, without guarantees of civil liberties for opponents.\\" In 1930, Jessie Lloyd married Harvey O'Connor, an editor for the Federated Press, and a former logger, seaman, and member of the Industrial Workers of the World. The O'Connors decided to open a bureau of the Federated Press in Pittsburgh where the labor movement, in attempting to organize the steel mills and mining companies, was fighting its most bitter struggle. First, they took a six-month trip to the Caribbean and Mexico, filing stories from each region they visited. In 1931, the Federated Press sent Jessie Lloyd O'Connor to replace a correspondent who had been shot while covering the coal miners' strike in Harlan County, Kentucky. Despite regular threats, she turned interviews with miners, their families, and members of the community into evocative stories carried in newspapers throughout the country. Her investigation of the murder of two men conducting a soup kitchen for the strikers left an indelible impression which she described in the O'Connors' 1987 memoir: \\"Class struggle is not something I want to preach, it is something that happens to people who try to resist or improve intolerable conditions.\\" After returning to Pittsburgh, O'Connor continued working for the Federated Press and helped revitalize the local ACLU. She also helped research and edit the first in a series of Harvey's exposes of American capitalism, Mellon's Millions (1933), a role she played for his subsequent books. The O'Connors went to Moscow in 1932 to work for the English language Moscow Daily News. Jessie was troubled by the changes in Russia since 1928 and unhappy translating dull stories of \\"socialist triumphs in new paper mills and state farms.\\" When libel litigation over Mellon's Millions was resolved in 1933, the O'Connors returned to Pittsburgh where workers, guaranteed the right to organize by the National Recovery Act, were forming union locals throughout the steel industry. While reporting for the Federated Press from 1933 to 1935, O'Connor carried messages between organizers. During the Ambridge strike she narrowly escaped arrest, and smuggled the main organizer out of town. During this period she also chaired the Pittsburgh chapter of the League Against War and Fascism. An heir to the Chicago Tribune fortune, O'Connor believed it was her duty to use her money to benefit radical causes. In 1934, she received publicity for demanding at a stockholders' meeting that U.S. Steel recognize a union of its employees. She helped fund many projects, from literacy and voting campaigns in the South to radical bookstores. Although she continued to work periodically as a freelance journalist, in 1936 O'Connor turned her energies to volunteer work and later, caring for two children the O'Connors adopted in the early 1940s. From 1939 to 1944 they lived at Hull House. While in Chicago, Jessie was general secretary of The League of Women Shoppers, working to organize buying power to improve workplace conditions and wages. For the Metropolitan Housing and Planning Council she made a film of housing conditions designed to convince her former Winnetka neighbors to finance improvements. She also worked for the Industrial Board of the YWCA, the ACLU, Spanish Refugee Relief, the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born, WILPF, and the Campaign for World Government. O'Connor claimed she served on so many boards during this period that she did justice to none of them. In 1945 the O'Connors moved to Fort Worth, Texas where Harvey worked as publicity director for the Oil Workers International Union. In 1948 they settled in Little Compton, Rhode Island, where Harvey devoted himself to writing. Jessie was a member of the National Committee of the Progressive Party from 1949 to 1952 and a delegate to the People's World Constitutional Convention in 1950. During the 1950s, Joseph McCarthy accused both O'Connors of being Communists. Harvey was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and Jessie's passport was revoked. They joined with other activists to organize the National Committee to Abolish HUAC (later the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation). From the 1960s on, Jessie demonstrated against the Vietnam War, was active in political campaigns, worked against construction of a local nuclear power plant, and traveled extensively. ==References== ==External links== * Jessie Lloyd O'Connor papers at the Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College Special Collections Category:1904 births Category:1988 deaths Category:People from Winnetka, Illinois Category:Smith College alumni ","title":"Jessie Lloyd O'Connor"},{"id":"63928127","text":"Computer simulation of two Malkus waterwheels with varying initial condition. Although the initial angle \\\\theta_0 differs between the wheels by only 1 degree, the trajectories of the plotted centers of mass diverge enormously in the long run. trajectories of the centers of mass of the above two wheels, left and right respectively, after the same extended period of time. In each plot, the center of mass M\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^2 is the vector (M_x, M_y)^T, where M_x and M_y are the x and y components, respectively. The system indeed appears to exhibit a great dependence on initial conditions, a defining property of chaotic systems; moreover, two attractors of the system are seen in both plots. The Malkus waterwheel, also referred to as the Lorenz waterwheel or chaotic waterwheel, is a mechanical model that exhibits chaotic dynamics. Its motion is governed by the Lorenz equations. While classical waterwheels rotate in one direction at a constant speed, the Malkus waterwheel exhibits chaotic motion where its rotation will speed up, slow down, stop, change directions, and oscillate back and forth between combinations of such behaviours in an unpredictable manner. This variant waterwheel was developed by Willem Malkus in the 1960s. As a pedagogic tool, the Malkus waterwheel became a paradigmatic realization of a chaotic system, and is widely used in the teaching of chaos theory. In addition to its pedagogic use, the Malkus waterwheel has been actively studied by researchers in dynamical systems and chaos. In the Malkus waterwheel, a constant flow of water pours in at the top bucket of a simple circular symmetrical waterwheel and the base of the waterwheel has perforations to allow the outflow of water. At low rates of inflow, the wheel rolls permanently in the same direction. At higher rates of inflow, the waterwheel enters a chaotic regime where it reverses its directionality, accelerates and decelerates in an apparently unpredictable way. A further increase in the incoming flow makes the waterwheel return to a periodic state, where it oscillates back and forth at fixed intervals. Since it was first proposed, many experimental and real-world applications have been related to the waterwheel dynamics. These include instances like the dynamics for electro-rotation, haline oceanic flow, and Rayleigh–Benard convection. ==References== Category:Chaos theory ","title":"Malkus waterwheel"},{"id":"63928131","text":"Guillermo Nielsen, Presidente de YPF Guillermo Nielsen Guillermo Nielsen (born 20 April 1951) is an Argentinian economist, currently president of the State- owned oil company YPF.

He showed an interest in art at an early age and at age seventeen he found work at Richard-Ginori where he could devote himself to the design of porcelain products. The writer , had the opportunity to see some of Berti's works in clay, and advised his father Angiolo to enroll him at the Santa Croce Institute of Art in Florence. From this began Berti's artistic career, and his first participation in the Venice Biennale and the Rome Quadriennale. ===Sculptures=== Santo Stefano church in Pane in Florence with a statue of Giulio Facibeni in front Berti devoted himself mainly to portraiture by sculpting busts. He was commissioned to make statues for the monument to Ugo Foscolo located in the Basilica of Santa Croce. He created busts of various members of the Italian royal family (Victor Emmanuel III, Marie-José of Belgium, etc.). He also sculpted busts of Mussolini, , and the American billionaires Barbara Hutton and Susanna Agnelli. His portraits of the writer and designer and Amadeo of Aosta are also of considerable artistic value. Berti designed the bronze casket used to house the wooden coffin of Pope Pius XI. ===Monuments=== After the Second World War, Berti was commissioned to create monuments to many famous people, including to Alcide De Gasperi in Trento (working with ). He also spent time as the official sculptor of the Holy See. During this time he sculpted Pius XII in Rome and Louise de Marillac in St. Peter's Basilica. He created the bronze statue of on the square in front of the in Florence, the statue of Benedetta Bianchi Porro in Dovadola (in the Province of Forlì-Cesena), and the bronze statue of Guglielmo Marconi made in 1974 in the park of Villa Griffone in Sasso Marconi. Berti created the portal for the Castellammare Cathedral in Castellammare di Stabia and the monument to Elena of Montenegro, erected in Messina, in memory of the relief work of the sovereign during the earthquake that devastated the city. He also sculpted a monument to Padre Pio and one to Aldo Moro in his hometown of Maglie. The Moro bust was made after his death from his sketches. ===Medals and coins=== Berti also made a name for himself as a designer of medals and coins. In the Vatican Museums (Collection of Modern Religious Art) there is a bronze Christ from 1972. In the 1980s Berti made some commemorative medals, commissioned by Rodolfo Siviero, for the inauguration of the exhibition of works found after the war. Berti loved Italian music and was friends with the conductor Arturo Toscanini, for whom he minted \\"Triptych of the Silver Medals to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the death of Arturo Toscanini\\". In May 2014, on the occasion of the bicentenary of the Carabinieri, the 1973 Berti work Carabinieri patrol in the storm was recast and placed in Rome in the garden of Church of Saint Andrew's at the Quirinal. ===Teaching=== Berti taught at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, where he mentored other sculptors.

In 1893, he helped found the Tullar-Meredith Publishing Company in New York City, where he composed and produced church and Sunday school music in hymns and hymnals. Perhaps his most famous is the poem \\"The Weaver,\\" commonly referred to as \\"The Tapestry Poem.\\" This work gained popularity through it being one of the favorites of Corrie ten Boom. In fact, the connection between ten Boom and this poem runs so deep that many people mistakingly attribute the poem to her instead of Tullar. == References == Category:People from Bolton, Connecticut Category:1869 births Category:1950 deaths ","title":"Grant Colfax Tullar"},{"id":"63928580","text":"Race With Ryan is a 2019 racing video game based on the YouTube channel Ryan's World.

She is one of the lead singers of the American band Delta Rae. == Early life and education == Hölljes was born in Nashville and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area with her two brothers, Ian Hölljes and Eric Hölljes. Their parents instilled in them a love of music, reading, and education. At age 15, Brittany dropped out of high school and enrolled at College of Marin for two years before choosing between studying ethnomusicology at UCLA or religion at University of California, Berkeley. She chose UC Berkeley, where she graduated in 2009 at the age of 19. She earned a degree in ancient Mediterranean religion with an emphasis in Greek mythology. Soon after her college graduation in 2009, Hölljes moved to Raleigh, North Carolina to start the band Delta Rae with her brothers, Ian and Eric, and their long-time friend Elizabeth Hopkins. She moved to Nashville, Tennessee in December 2017. == Music == Hölljes is known for the \\"witchy\\" quality she often brings to her singing, such as in Delta Rae's hit song \\"Bottom of the River.\\" She is also known for her rock-style of singing, like in the song, \\"Fire\\", which gained notability from Rolling Stone. Several songs by Delta Rae have been inspired by Hölljes' romantic pursuits, including \\"Fire\\" and \\"Do You Ever Dream?.\\" \\"Fire\\" describes an ex-boyfriend who \\"had a bad habit of telling strangers about our relationship problems,\\" while \\"Do You Ever Dream\\" depicts an ex who didn't share Hölljes' \\"imagination or vision for the future.\\" In February 2020, Delta Rae released \\"From One Woman to Another,\\" which is the first song that Hölljes took the lead on writing for the band. She said she wrote the song \\"not to chastise folx looking for a casual connection, but to say to those holding out for love: Let go of the people not meant for you, make room for a true love to come along and know you're not alone.\\" == Artistry and influences == Hölljes (right) performing with Delta Rae aboard in 2014 Hölljes, like the rest of Delta Rae, believes in the power of music. She often speaks of the significant impact of the Delta Rae's \\"diehard fans\\" on the band and on her. She once said, \\"I hope that when people listen to our music, they feel the love and care that is in it. I hope that people can take the songs that are imbued with magic and folklore and that can awaken some part of their spirit. I hope that people can listen to our songs that have greater messages, political messages and use them as a rallying cry. I just hope that the music we are creating will bring people together. I think we are making an effort to really say something and be an American band. I hope that in some way, we help shift consciousness to a positive place and bring dark things into the light.\\" == Activism == Hölljes is a vocal activist around public interest issues such as Women's rights, #MeToo Movement, Black Lives Matter, environmental activism, and immigration rights, among others. She has also used her platform to urge her fans to vote. Hölljes was sexually assaulted when she was 13, which she publicly announced in 2018 through both the publishing of a personal essay and the release of a Delta Rae song called \\"Hands Dirty.\\" She co-wrote the song with her brother and fellow Delta Rae band member, Ian Hölljes. It was released just days after the Kavanaugh hearings because, as she said, \\"I can't hold it back anymore.\\" She spoke about her reasons for writing this song: \\"We wrote \\"Hands Dirty\\" because we refuse to give up on the inevitable, equitable future. We believe that women will rise and claim our place as leaders in this world because the future is up to us – as women and for anyone who believes in equality. Women are not a monolith, we have diverse beliefs, but we all will benefit when women are in positions of power — representing our diversity of experiences and inspiring the next generation to further the progress.\\" Hölljes is also the lead singer for the song, \\"All Good People\\", which is an activism song Delta Rae wrote in response to the Charleston church shooting and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. == References == Category:Living people Category:American female songwriters Category:American female rock singers Category:American women activists Category:American female musicians Category:Musicians from the San Francisco Bay Area Category:1989 births ","title":"Brittany Hölljes"},{"id":"63928661","text":"Yakima Electric Railway may refer to: * Yakima Electric Railway Museum * Yakima Valley Transportation Company ","title":"Yakima Electric Railway"},{"id":"63928682","text":"The Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces is the professional head of the Kazakh Ground Forces.

Decameron; The plague of Florence The Black Death was present in the Italian states of present-day Italy between 1347 and 1348.Harrison, Dick, Stora döden: den värsta katastrof som drabbat Europa, Ordfront, Stockholm, 2000 Sicily and the Italian Peninsula was the first area in then Catholic Western Europe to be reached by the bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death, which reached the region by an Italian ship from the Crimea which landed in Messina in Sicily in October 1347. Coming to a completely unprepared region, the Black Death was a chock to Italy and to Europe. The Black Death in Italy belongs to the most documented among its outbreaks in Europe, with many literate eyewitnesses, among them being Giovanni Boccaccio, Marchionne di Coppo Stefani, and Agnolo di Tura, whose descriptions of it in their own cities and areas have become famous. The well organized and Urban city republics of Central and Northern Italy had the most well-developed administration in Europe prior to the Black Death; their documentation has provided among the most useful descriptions of the pandemic, and the preventive measures and regulations initiated by the Italian city- states during and following the Black Death pandemic has been referred to as the foundation of modern quarantine law regulation. ==Background== ===Italy in the mid-14th century=== When the Black Death reached modern day Italy, it was roungly divided in the Kingdom of Sicily and Kingdom of Naples in the south, the Papal States in the middle, and the heavily urbanised Northern Italy, which formally belonged to the Holy Roman Empire but in reality divided in to several autonomous city republics or principalities. ===The Black Death=== The traditional story of how the plague first came to Europe was that it was introduced to Europe via Genoese traders from their port city of Kaffa in the Crimea. During a protracted siege of the city, the Mongol Golden Horde army of Jani Beg, whose mainly Tatar troops were suffering from the disease, catapulted infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants. When the plague spread inside the city, the Genoese ships in the harbour fleed from Kaffa toward Italy, bringing the plague with them. ==Plague migration== ===Southern Italy=== The arrival of the Black Death to Sicily (and thus Western Europe), has been described by the chronicler Michele da Piazza. In October 1347, twelve Genoese ships from the East arrived to Messina on Sicily. After the Genuese came ashore, the inhabitants of Messina started to develop abscesses, coff and die. The Genoese were imediately bannised from the city, but the illness spread with such speed that the city experienced a collapse of social order. The sick wished to be cured, to make wills and to take the confession, but both physicians, notaries and priests were infencted and soon refused to go near them; people abandoned their homes, which were pillaged by criminals without being stopped by the guards and officials, who also died. On Sicily, Messina was pointed out as a city being condemned by God for its sins. Refugees from Messina fled toward Catania to ask the statue of Saint Agatha to be brought to Messina to appeal to God, but the citizens of Catania locked the gates to them. They were instead allowed to take the statue of the Virgin Mary from Santa Maria della Scala to Messina. During November, refugees desperately fled from Messina in all directions, dying on the roads and spreading the plague all over the island of Siciliy, including Catania, which became the second plague center of the island. One of the members of the royal family, Duke Giovanni, fled from Catania to the forrest of Mascalia where he was referred to as the last victim of the plague in Sicily in April 1348. ===Northern Italy=== One of the most known contemporary descriptions of the Black Death in Northern Italy is the Historia de Morbo by Gabriele de' Mussi. He describes it with focus on his own home town of Piacenza. According to the chronicle, the plague did not migrate from the South across the Italian Peninsula, but was taken directly to Genova and Venice by Genoese plague ships. The plague came to Piacenza with the Genoese Fulco della Croce, who died shortly after his arrival, followed by his host family and their neighbors. When the plague entered a house through one victim, three days remained before all the inhabitants of that house were dead. The ill called upon physicians to care for them, notaries to make their will and priests or monks to take their confessions and witness their wills, and all of the visitors took the plague with them when they left; convents, especially, were badly infected through the priests taking the confessions from the sick. Soon, the sick and dying were abandoned by physicians, priests and their own families who fled from the illness and the lonely screams of the dying could be heard from the abandoned houses. The corpses of the dead were left in the abandoned houses, which were closed off in fear of the deceased, and only the richest paid the poorest to bury the remains of the dead. The cemeteries were filled so rapidly that mass burials were arranged, and eventually, the sick started to dig their own graves in the middle of the town squares. Between March and September 1348, in Bologna, several famous academics of the University of Bologna died, among them Giovanni di Andrea. The Black Death of Trento (June 1348) has been described in the chronicle of Giovanni of Parma. In July 1348, two of the rules of Padua died in succession. The Black Death of the Republic of Venice has been described in the chronicles of the Doge Andrea Dandolo, the monk Francesco della Grazia and Lorenzo de Monacis. Venice was one of the biggest cities in Europe, and at this point overcrowded with refugees from the famine in the countryside the year prior and the earthquake in January. In April 1348, the plague reached the crowded city and the streets became littered with the bodies of the sick, dying and the dead, and with smells emanating from houses where the dead had been abandoned. Between 25 and 30 people were buried daily in the cemetery near Rialto, and corpses were transported to be buried on islands in the lagoon by people who gradually caught the plague and died themselves. So many Venetians fled the city, including the officials of the state, that the remaining members of the city councils banned the Venetians from leaving the city in July by threatening loss of their position and status if they did, to prevent a collapse of social order. ==See also== * Cronaca fiorentina di Marchionne di Coppo Stefani ==References== Category:14th-century health disasters Category:14th century in Italy Italy Category:Death in Italy Category:Health disasters in Italy Category:1347 in Europe Category:1348 in Europe ","title":"Black Death in Italy"},{"id":"63928907","text":"Marija Goranović (born 22 October 1995) is a Montenegrin footballer who plays as a defender.

The Black Death in France was described by eyewitnesses such as Louis Heyligen, Jean de Venette and Gilles Li Muisis. The Black Death migrated from Southern France to Spain, from Eastern France to the Holy Roman Empire, and to England by ship from Gascony. At the time, Pope Clement VI resided in Avignon in present-day France during the Western Schism, and issued his condemnations of the Jewish persecutions during the Black Death as well as the flagellants. During the Black Death in France, King Philip VI of France ordered the University of Paris to composed the pioneering work Compendium de epidemia due to the pandemic.Joseph Patrick Byrne: The Black Death ==Background== ===France in the mid-14th century=== The Battle of Crécy At this point in time, France and England had entered the Hundred Years' War. In 1346, France had lost the Battle of Crécy. Pope Clement VI lived in Avignon in present-day France during the Western Schism.Gail, Marzieh (1969). The Three Popes: An Account of the Great Schism. New York, 1969. The Kingdom of France had a population of between 16 and 20 million people, the largest population of Europe. Similarly to Italy, it was relatively urbanised. ===The Black Death=== Since the outbreak of the Black Death at the Crimea, it had reached Sicily by an Italian ship from the Crimea. After having spread across the Italian states, the plague reached France by a plague ship in November 1347. ==Plague migration== ===Southern France=== The plague in Southern France are described by Louis Heyligen in Avignon. According to Louis Heyligen the Black Death reached France in December 1347, when a Genovese plague ship from the East was forced to leave its home port of Genova shortly after its return and arrived in Marseilles instead. The ship spread the plague in Marseilles, was forced to leave the city and continued on its way along the coast of Southern France, spreading the plague along its way, as well as from Marseilles West toward Toulouse, and north toward Avignon. In May 1348, a second wave came by land from Genova. In Avignon, the pope arranged religious processions to dampen the wrath of God, as the plague was interpreted by the church as the punishment of God for the sins of humanity. The pope was advised by his physician Gui de Chauliac to hide from the plague in Étoile-sur-Rône, where he survived the outbreak. The Black Death in Southwest France is not as documented as it is in Avignon. It is noted to have been in Carcassonne in January 1348 and in Toulouse in April. It is confirmed in Bordeaux in June 1348, but it is likely to have been present there already in March. It is noted that it was a ship of pilgrims from Bordeaux who brought the plague to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. In April 1348, the Black Death is noted to have reached Lyon. ===Northern France=== Burying Plague Victims of Tournai From Lyon, the plague spread across Burgundy. In the village of Givry in Burgundy, half the population is confirmed to have died in August-November 1348. The Black Death in Paris is described in the famous chronicle of the Carmelite Jean de Venette in the Saint-Denis Abbey in Ille de France outside of Paris. At the time, Paris was the biggest city in Europe, with a population of between 80.000 and 200.000 people.Robert S. Gottfried:Black Death According to Jean de Venette, the plague first arrived to Roissy near Gonesse in June 1348. He claims, that 16.000 people died in Saint-Denis and 800 people daily in Paris between November and December, were 500 died was transported to mass burial each day from the Hôtel-Dieu, Paris, were the nuns who attended the sick died along with them. It did not leave Paris until January 1349. The presence of the plague is noted in Rouen in Normandie in the Normanniae nova Cronica during the feast of John the Baptist on 24 June 1348. In Normandie, the plague made it impossible to bury the corpses even in country villages, and each village which was reached by the plague flagged a black flag to warn anyone approaching. In the very Northern parts of France, the Black Death is described in the chronicle of the abbot Gilles li Muisis of Tournai. According to Li Muisis, the plague reached Tournai in August 1349 and lasted to November. In Tournai, the Black Death caused a religious reformation. Because the plague was seen as punishment of God for the sins of humanity, the authorities issued regulations to ban everything regarded as sinful, such as gambling, and forced couples who lived together without being married to separate or marry immediately. Due to the size of France, certain parts were not immediately reached by the plague, which travelled more slowly by land than by sea. Brittany and Auvergne were not reached until 1349, and some remote parts was not reached until 1351. The last part of France to be reached by the Black Death was Tonnerre, which was not reached by the Black Death until 1352. ==Consequences== When the plague spread across Southern France, king Philip VI of France ordered the University of Paris to composed the pioneering work Compendium de epidemia due to the pandemic.Joseph Patrick Byrne: The Black Death The migration of the plague caused panic across France, and people started looking for scapegoats. Rumours started to spread that the plague was caused by people who poisoned the wells to cause the plague and exterminate Christendom. Initially, these accusations were not directed at people of any particular category, but directed at anyone who appeared suspicious simply because they were different or unidentified, particularly travellers (such as pilgrims and beggars) invalids, or people in possession of any kind of powder. In April 1348, Louis Heyligen reported that people were executed for well poisoning in Avignon; the same month, Andre Benezeit, secretary of mayor Aymar of Narbonne, reported to the mayor of Gerona in Catalonia that many beggars had been arrested, tortured and executed in Narbonne, Carcassonne and Grasse for well poisoning. These accusations were eventually also directed against the Jewish population, and on 5 July (and again on 26 September) Pope Clement VI issued his condemnations of the Jewish persecutions during the Black Death and explained that since the plague was a punishment issued by God himself, it was sinful to accuse the Jews of having caused it, and declared the Jews to be under his protection. While there is not much information about the Jewish persecutions during the Black Death in France, were the Jewish population was small due to the fact that Louis IX of France had banned them from France, the well-poisoning rumours from France erupted into documented persecutions and mass executions in the Duchy of Savoy, and resulted in massacres in the Holy Roman Empire, where the Jewish population was larger. ==Recurrences== The Black Death would return regularly, but with less death victims, until the 18th century. The last epidemic of bubonic plague in France was the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720.Hildesheimer, Françoise (1980), Le Bureau de la santé de Marseille sous l'Ancien Régime.

The White Lotus Conglomerate is closely associated with the Oneness Movement, a type of New Religious Movement. The movement's senior administrator is Lokesh Dasaji. White Lotus has interests in real estate, mining, entertainment, sport, agriculture, education, finance and manufacturing. Senior staff from Vijay Kumar's former Oneness Movement also sit on the boards of these companies. These include Ananda Giri and Jyothirmayee Chundi, also known as Samadarshini. The conglomerate comprises business names including Kosmik/Kosmic, Sacredbanyan, Transend, KPL, Bluewater, Golden Lotus, Goldenage, Chatrachaya, Yogi and Enlite. Many of these businesses exist only as mailing addresses. The CEO of Kosmik Global Media is Uday Sinh Wala. Writing for Open magazine, senior editor V. Shoba says that there is a succession plan in place, by which NKV Krishna will eventually take over the company. However, she says there has been an ongoing power struggle with his father which has lasted nearly two decades. === Overseas operations === In the USA, White Lotus Group is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and its CEO is Arun Agarwal. In the Middle East, White Lotus has set up a Dubai-based operation headed by Poosapati Ramachandra Raju Sita and Mahat Mohamoud Noor. White Lotus Capital Investment Holding is a Singapore-based subsidiary of the family's Indian company Global Arkitekts Private Limited. == Meditation and wellness programs== During the 1990s, Vijay Kumar and his 'Oneness Movement' developed a series of meditation and wellness programs for the Indian market. In around 2014, the Oneness organization launched another series of programs designed to appeal to westerners. In 2017, NKV Krishna and Preetha Krishna merged the Oneness organisation with their own One World Academy to form 'O&O; Academy'. These programs were aimed at westerners, and developed with the help of American wellness coach, Tony Robbins. During 2019, NKV Krishna and Preetha Krishna published a book together, called The Four Sacred Secrets, writing under the names 'Krishnaji' and 'Preethaji'. ==Real estate development== ===Pinnacle Tower Project=== White Lotus has formed a partnership with Abdinasir Ali Hassan and his Hass Petroleum group to develop The Pinnacle Project in Nairobi. Between them, White Lotus and Hass have invested $200 million in the Pinnacle, which will include the tallest tower in Africa. The development will include a luxury Hilton Hotel with 255 rooms. However, the project has suffered difficulties and is now stalled due to legal action over a land dispute. Construction is being undertaken by China State Construction Engineering Corporation. In September 2020, news aggregator AllAfrica reported that all construction work had ceased. ===Hotel Deco XV=== The White Lotus Group owns the 1930s Redick Tower building in Omaha, Nebraska. After a $7 million re-development, it was re-opened in 2010 as the Hotel Deco XV. ===Oneness Temple=== One of its landmark projects is the Oneness Temple, which is located in Varadaiahpalem, Andhra Pradesh, India, on the grounds of Kalki Bhagwan's ashram.India: a visit to the Oneness Temple of Amma-Bhagwan It was inaugurated in April 2008, and built at an estimated cost of $75 million. ===Other projects=== White Lotus is increasing its activities in Wisconsin after the law was changed to enable more tax credits for affordable housing developments. It is one of the developers submitting proposals for the Pershing Center in Lincoln, Nebraska. == Media, communications and sport == One of the businesses associated with White Lotus, production company Kosmik Global Media, owns the Bengaluru Bulls, a Pro Kabaddi League team. Kosmik MusicKosmik Music - YouTube, is a music label with more than 1,200 titles ranging from Classical, Spiritual, Fusion, New Age, Devotional and Film.

T. Rama Rao Jr. == Telecommunications == During 2019, White Lotus joined with UV Asset Reconstruction (UVARCL) in a consortium which is bidding upwards of $200 Million USD to buy the bankrupt Reliance Communications from tycoon Anil Ambani. Along with UVARCL, other members of the consortium include Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group, Bharti Airtel and US-based Varde Partners. Directors of UVARCL include Shilpi Sharma, Hari Hara Mishra, US Paliwal, KK Gupta, PP Naolekar, and Dhanraj. In June 2020, with the approval of the National Company Law Tribunal, UVARCL won bids to buy some of the assets of Reliance Communications. The Tribunal also approved an insolvency resolution plan prepared by UVARCL, with some modifications, to acquire Aircel Ltd, which had been part of a planned merger with Reliance. == Controversies == Over the years, some activities of the White Lotus Conglomerate and its related companies have received significant press coverage. In India, such publications have included The Hindu, The Times of India and The Deccan Herald newspapers; and The Week magazine. Overseas, its controversies have been covered in media based in Africa, China and the Middle East. === Income tax raids === In October 2019, over a 5-day period, more than 300 Income Tax department officials and police personnel raided about 40 premises associated with the White Lotus Conglomerate. They confiscated unaccounted assets including cash and gold worth $12 Million USD and cash receipts worth $55 Million USD. The Enforcement Directorate registered a case against Vijay Kumar and NKV Krishna under the Foreign Exchange Management Act. The Income Tax teams questioned the CEO of one of the ashrams, Lokesh Dasaji, and seized the mobile phones of all people working inside. They also raided the workplace and house of Krishna Dasaji, who founded the Ekam Spiritual Centre in Chennai and Film Nagar in Hyderabad. The investigation is in progress. Among the premises raided were those of the group's charity organisation, One Humanity Care. Vijay Kumar issued a statement denying that he and his wife had fled the country. After the raids, The Madras High Court granted time for the Income Tax Department to file its counter affidavit to a writ petition preferred by Preetha Krishna against a ‘look out circular’ issued by the department preventing her from flying abroad without receiving an Income Tax Department clearance certificate. Preetha Krishna's request to travel to the USA and Ukraine was denied by the Income Tax Department assistant director K Mahadevan, who said that her presence would be necessary for the investigation. In The Week magazine, Lakshmi Subramanian and Rahul Devulapalli suggested that Vijay Kumar's political links to the Telugu Desam Party were a factor in the raids. They also reported that, in 2013, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Chennai had found NKV Krishna guilty of violating tax laws and unlawfully acquiring agricultural land. === Unregulated Hawala transactions === According to a report in The Hindu newspaper by Mohamed Imranullah S., tax investigators say that large sums of money have been transferred to Dubai through informal, unregulated hawala channels. They allege that the cash is for investing in various overseas projects. === Land disputes in Kenya and India === In 2019, in Nairobi, a dispute has arisen about the ownership of land where the Pinnacle tower was being built. The dispute centres around ownership of the land, which is being contested by Ugandan tycoon James Mugoya and a trust set up by former United Arab Emirates leader Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan. An arrest warrant has been issued for two directors of White Lotus in the Middle East, Poosapati Ramachandra Raju Sita and Mohamud Mahat Noor. In December 2019, ETB Sivapriyan, writing for The Deccan Herald, says that Vijay Kumar is facing allegations of 'land grabbing'. In December 2019, 907 acres of land owned by Vijay Kumar and his family was 'attached' by Indian Law Enforcement agencies. During the 1990s, local people organised protests against Vijay Kumar and his organization's ashram for cheaply buying up hundreds of acres of land from local farmers. Subsequently, some of the farmers had their land returned to them. === Stampede and deaths at temple === In 2008, five people died during a stampede at the inauguration of the Oneness Movement's 'Oneness Temple' at Tada in Andhra Pradesh. At the event, many others were injured, and the temple was closed for a period. === Lawsuit against newspaper === In 2019, writing for the Times of India, Arun Ram recounts that, in 2002, he wrote an article about Kalki Bhagwan's Oneness Movement which resulted in a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the publication. However, the Mumbai High Court found in favour of the publication, and the media's 'right to write'. === Abandoned charity project === In 2010, the author Arunda Ardagh wrote that the not-for- profit '100 Village Project' he had referred to in Chapter 10 of his book Awakening into Oneness had been abandoned. === Cult warnings in China === In 2019, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security and China Anti-Cult Association (CACA) issued a warning about the Oneness Movement in the state run Global Times, prompting popular Taiwanese actress and singer Annie Yi to remove her social media post promoting the movement. == References == == External links == * US website of White Lotus Group * Website of O&O; Academy * Website of Kalki and Amma Bhagwan Category:Companies of India ","title":"White Lotus Conglomerate"},{"id":"63929039","text":"\\"Ye Choirs of New Jerusalem\\" or \\"Sing, Choirs of New Jerusalem\\" is an English Easter hymn by Robert Campbell. It is a 19th-century translation of the medieval , attributed to Fulbert of Chartres. The text's primary focus is the Resurrection of Jesus, taking the theme of Jesus as triumphant victor over death and deliverer of the prisoners from Hell. The text was first published by Robert Campbell in 1850, and partially rewritten by the compilers of the first edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern. The hymn remains popular in modern compilations, notably appearing in the Carols for Choirs collection. It is normally paired with the tune \\"St. Fulbert\\" by Henry John Gauntlett. It has also been set to music as an anthem by Charles Villiers Stanford, and this version is equally in common use in Anglican churches. ==History== The hymn first appears in multiple 11th-century manuscripts, so if the attribution to St. Fulbert (who died c. 1029) is correct, \\"it must have become popular very quickly\\". The hymn was widely used on the British Isles. In the Sarum Breviary, it is listed for the Vespers of the Easter Octave and for all Sundays from then until the Feast of the Ascension. It also appears in the York, Hereford and Aberdeen breviaries, and remains present in late medieval manuscripts. The modern text first appeared in Campbell's Hymns and Anthems for Use in the Holy Services of the Church within the United Diocese of St Andrews, Dunkeld, and Dunblane (Edinburgh, 1850). The editors of Hymns Ancient and Modern altered Campbell's text in various places, replaced the final stanza with a doxology, and added \\"Alleluia! Amen\\" to the hymn's end. Other translations of the hymn by J. M. Neale, R. F. Littledale, R. S. Singleton and others were also in common use at the end of the 19th century. Further changes to Campbell's setting include alterations to the fifth stanza, due to its references to \\"soldiers\\" and \\"palace\\", sometimes being omitted entirely. ==Text== The original Latin hymn is written in iambic dimeter, with lines of 8 syllables each in quatrains with an a-a-b-b rhyme scheme. The most common version nowadays is based on the translation of Robert Campbell, which is in the shorter common metre. The version by John Mason Neale is in the original long metre and thus unsingable to the modern tune. His version better reflects the original and shows that Campbell's version, as retouched in Hymns Ancient and Modern and later hymnals, is a \\"Victorian creation\\". The first stanza begins with an invitation to sing. It refers to the \\"New Jerusalem\\" of and uses \\"Paschal victory\\" instead of the more frequent \\"paschal victim\\" (victimae paschali). The second stanza describes Jesus as the Lion of Judah of the Old Testament and the fulfillment of the promise of , although the medieval text more probably had the idea of the harrowing of Hell in mind, an idea also present in stanza three. The fourth and fifth stanza incite the believer to worship the triumphant Christ. The final stanza was added by the editors of Hymns Ancient and Modern and is a doxology, a common metre setting of the Gloria Patri. { !Original Latin text !! Translation by J. M. Neale !! Translation by Robert Campbell -  style=\\"padding-left:2em; style=\\"padding- left:2em;Ye Choirs of New Jerusalem! To sweet new strains attune your theme; The while we keep, from care releas'd, With sober joy our Paschal Feast: When Christ, Who spake the Dragon's doom, Rose, Victor-Lion, from the Tomb: That while with living voice He cries, The dead of other years might rise. Engorg'd in former years, their prey Must Death and Hell restore to-day: And many a captive soul, set free, With Jesus leaves captivity. Right gloriously He triumphs now, Worthy to Whom should all things bow; And, joining heaven and earth again, Links in one commonweal the twain. And we, as these His deeds we sing, His suppliant soldiers, pray our King, That in His Palace, bright and vast, We may keep watch and ward at last.

Triumphant in his glory now his sceptre ruleth all: earth, heav'n and hell before him bow and at his footstool fall. While joyful thus his praise we sing, his mercy we implore, into his palace bright to bring, and keep us evermore. All glory to the Father be, all glory to the Son, all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee, while endless ages run. } ==Musical settings== \\"Ye Choirs of New Jerusalem\\" has been described as the \\"only medieval resurrection hymn still widely sung\\", but it owes more of its enduring popularity to the vigour of Campbell's translation and to the hymn's cheerful tune than the original text. The original chant melody, in the 3rd mode, is not associated with the modern text, although it appears as a setting for Neale's translation in the 1906 English Hymnal, and for one of Neale's other texts in the 1916 Hymnal of the American Episcopal Church. The hymn is most commonly set to and was made famous by the tune \\"St Fulbert\\" by Henry John Gauntlett, which first appeared in The Church Hymn and Tune Book (London, 1852). There it was used for the hymn \\"Now Christ, our Passover, is slain\\" and was known as \\"St Leofred\\". The editors of Hymns Ancient and Modern set Campbell's altered text to it and renamed it according to the original Latin author, adding a concluding \\"Alleluia! Amen\\". A setting appears in the 1987 collection 100 Carols for Choirs, with the harmonisation from the English Hymnal (transcribed below) and a last verse descant by David Willcocks. An alternative tune is \\"Lyngham\\", a fuguing tune by 18th-century Englishman Thomas Jarman, whose \\"astonishing and invigorating\\" choral-style polyphony echoes the first stanza instruction for \\"choirs\\" to employ their \\"sweetest notes\\". << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\partial 4 \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\relative c << { a4  a d, e b'  a g fis a  fis a b d  cis2. \\\\bar\\"\\" \\\\break d4  a b a d,  g g fis fis  e fis g e  d2. \\\\bar\\".\\" } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { e4  d d d cis  d e d e  d d b b  e2. fis4  d d d d  d cis d d  d d d cis  d2. } >> } ew Lyrics \\\\lyricmode { Ye4 choirs of new Je -- ru -- sa -- lem, your sweet -- est notes em -- ploy,2. the4 Pas -- chal vic -- to -- ry to hymn in strains of ho -- ly joy.2. } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\relative c' << { a4  fis a b e  a, a a a  a a a gis  a2. a4  a g a a  b a a b  b a b g  fis2. } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { cis4  d fis g g  fis cis d cis  d fis e e  a,2. d4  fis g fis fis  e a, d b  g fis e a  d2. } >> } >> >> \\\\layout { indent = #0 } \\\\midi { \\\\tempo 4 = 80 } ===Settings as an anthem=== A notable setting of the hymn to music is in the form of an anthem for Eastertide by Charles Villiers Stanford. Completed in December 1910 and published as the composer's Op. 123 by Stainer & Bell the next year, this setting of all six stanzas of the hymn uses completely new musical material, with two main musical ideas, the first in major mode in triple metre ('Ye choirs of New Jerusalem') and the second in minor quadruple metre ('Devouring depths of hell their prey'). The piece begins in G major and modulates through various keys, alternating between the two main themes before concluding in a fanfare-like fashion on \\"Alleluia! Amen\\". Other settings in the form of an anthem include works by Ivor R. Davies, Archie Fairbairn Barnes and Hugh Blair. The hymn has also been set, to a new melody, by contemporary composer Kile Smith. ==See also== * Anglican church music * List of compositions by Charles Villiers Stanford ==Referencesin Stanford's setting, sung by the Choir of New College, Oxford * (arr.

Several witness accounts do exist from the Black Death in the Holy Roman Empire, although they were often either written after the events took place, or are very short. ==Background== ===The Holy Roman Empire in the mid-14th century=== Charles IV was emperor at the time. At this point in time, the Holy Roman Empire was the geographically largest nation in Europe, though the population of France was bigger. It was a personal union under the King of Bohemia, who was also the Holy Roman Emperor. ===The Black Death=== Since the outbreak of the Black Death at the Crimea, it had reached Sicily by an Italian ship from the Crimea. After having spread across the Italian states, and from Italy to France, the plague reached the borders of the Empire from France in the West, and from Italy in the South. ==Progress of the plague== The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached Switzerland and Austria from Northern Italy in the South and Savoy in the East, and the Rhine and Central Germany from Northern France, and Northern Germany from Denmark. It continued from the Empire East to the Baltics and finally to Russia. === Austria=== The Black Death in Austria is mainly described by the chronicle of the Neuberg Monastery in Steiermark. The Neuberg Chronicle dates the outbreak of plague in Austria to the feast of St Martin on 11 November 1348. In parallel with the plague, severe floods affected Austria. The plague interrupted the ongoing feud among the nobility, who were forced to cooperate against it. The Neuberg Chronicle describes an outbreak of festivities among the peasantry and public to distract themselves from the catastrophe, and how law and order collapsed. The plague reached Vienna in May 1349, where it lasted until September and killed about one-third of the population. === Germany=== Southern Germany In the summer of 1349, the plague spread from Basel in Switzerland North toward Strasbourg. The plague reached Strasbourg from Colmar 8 July. During the summer and autumn of 1349, the plague spread West from Strasbourg toward Mainz, Kassel, Limburg, Kreuznach, Sponheim and finally (in December) to Cologne; and East toward Augsburg, Ulm, Essingen and Stuttgart. Northern Germany The Black Death reached Northern Germany in the early summer of 1350 when it arrived in Magdeburg, Halberstadt, Lübeck and Hamburg. The plague appears to have reached the Northern port cities in different time periods, likely because it was spreads by sea rather than land: the inland cities of Northern Germany, significantly, was affected at a later date in 1350 than the port cities along the North coast. It finally reached Prussia and from there to the Baltics in 1351, and from there to Russia. ===The Netherlands=== The Black Death in the present-day Netherlands and Belgium are poorly documented. Due to this, it has often been described as free and unaffected of the plague. It is known that the plague went as far as Hainaut and Flanders in the summer of 1349, but its progress further North cannot be traced, and there is no documentation of it in Central Netherlands. It is however confirmed that the ongoing reclaim of wetlands in Holland discontinued at this point, possibly because the population was suddenly smaller and there was, therefore, enough land for everyone. The very Northern part of the Netherlands, Frisia, is documented to have been reached by the plague, where it came from Germany in 1350, and there is a description of it in Deventer and Zwolle. ===Switzerland=== The Black Death reached Switzerland south from Ticino in Italy, and West to Rhone and Geneva from Avignon i France. According to tradition, Mühldrof am Inn was the first German language city to be affected by the Black Death, on 29 June 1348. Most of Switzerland was affected during the year of 1349, when the plague reached Bern, Zürich, Basel and Saint Gallen. ==Consequences== :See also Jewish persecutions during the Black Death Jewish persecutions during the Black Death in the Holy Roman Empire The Holy Roman Empire was the stage for both the Jewish pogroms as well as the flagellants during the Black Death. As the plague progressed, the Jews were accused to have caused it by well poisoning. Rumours of well poisoning were spread in France, but they were directed more toward Jews within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire, where there was a larger Jewish population than in France. The persecutions started to cause mass trials and mass executions of Jews in the Duchy of Savoy, and turned into massacres when the rumours of the trials in Savoy reached Switzerland and Germany. According to the chronicler Heinrich von Diessenhoven, all Jews from Cologne to Austria were killed in a series of massacres between November 1348 and September 1349. ==See also== * Basel massacre * Erfurt massacre (1349) * Strasbourg massacre ==References== Category:1340s in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1350s in the Holy Roman Empire Category:14th-century health disasters Holy Roman Empire Category:Death in Belgium Category:Health disasters in Belgium ","title":"Black Death in the Holy Roman Empire"},{"id":"63929144","text":"John Stafford McMillin (October 28, 1855 – November 3, 1936) was an American lawyer, businessman and political figure. Born in Sugar Grove, Indiana, McMillin attended DePauw University and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He practiced law in Lafayette before moving to Washington Territory, where he became the president and general manager of the Tacoma Lime Company, a limeworks. In 1886, McMillin and his partners in the Tacoma Lime Company bought Roche Harbor, Washington, and incorporated the Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company, of which McMillin again served as president and general manager. McMillin built the Hotel de Haro in Roche Harbor, and became involved in politics. He ran for the United States Senate in 1895, served as a member of the Washington state railroad commission, and was a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Washington in 1924 and 1932. He was also an ardent Freemason. ==Early life, education and family== John S. McMillin was born in Sugar Grove, Indiana on October 28, 1855. He had a brother, the Reverend William B. McMillin. John S. McMillin attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, serving as the fraternity's first Grand Consul, or international president. He graduated from DePauw University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1876, and received a Master of Arts degree in 1879. He remained active in fraternity affairs throughout his adult life, and installed Sigma Chi chapters at a number of universities, including Washington State University and the University of Oregon. ===Marriage and children=== On June 5, 1877, McMillin married Louella Hiett. Their first son, John Hiett McMillin, died shortly after being born on July 16, 1878. They had two more sons: Fred Hiett McMillin (September 16, 1880 – 1922) and Paul Hiett McMillin (1886 – 1961). They also had one daughter, Dorothy Hiett McMillin (1894 – 1980). ==Career== In 1877, McMillin was admitted to the bar in Lafayette, Indiana, where he worked as a lawyer until 1884. In January 1884, McMillin's family followed William B. McMillin and his family to Washington Territory. There, John S. McMillin invested in the Tacoma Lime Company, a limeworks, and became the company's president and general manager. In 1886, after investigating the limestone deposits present in Roche Harbor, Washington, McMillin and his partners in the Tacoma Lime Company bought Roche Harbor from brothers Richard and Robert Scurr. The Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company was soon incorporated, and McMillin was elected to serve as its president and general manager. McMillin also served as the president and general manager of the Staveless Barrel Company of Roche Harbor. In addition to his managerial roles, McMillin was responsible for the construction of Hotel de Haro, a 20-room hotel in Roche Harbor. McMillan ran for the United States Senate in 1895, but was unsuccessful. From 1905/06 to 1908, he served as a member of the Washington state railroad commission. He was also a member of the committee to notify Theodore Roosevelt of his nomination. McMillan was a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Washington in 1924 and 1932. ==Death and interment== McMillin died on November 3, 1936, and his son Paul succeeded him in leading the Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company. Six years before he died, John S. McMillin ordered the construction of Afterglow Vista (also known as the McMillin Memorial Mausoleum or Afterglow Mausoleum), a structure that serves as the final resting place of himself and members of his immediate family.

Thierry-Arno-Baudoin-Philippe was born into the House of Hénin on 5 August 1853 in The Hague in the Netherlands. A hereditary a prince of the Holy Roman Empire, he was a son of Simon-Gérard d'Alsace de Hénin-Liétard (1832–1891) and Baroness Angélique van Brienen de Grootelindt (1833–1921). His younger brother was Philippe-Charles de Hénin-Liétard (who married Hélène-Marie-Éléonore van Brienen de Groote Lindt). His paternal grandfather was Pierre-Simon de Hénin- Liétard, a son of Jean-François-Joseph de Hénin-Liétard, chamberlain of Joseph II, the Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria from 1765 to 1790 (and brother of Marie Antoinette). His great-grandfather was the uncle of Prince Charles-Alexandre de Hénin-Liétard d'Alsace, who was executed by guillotine during the French Revolution. ==Career== The Comte d'Alsace began his career at 20 years old by enlisting in the cavalry of the Army of Africa, a part of the French Army. He spent ten years in campaigns in southern Algeria and southern Tunisia from 1873 to 1883. He earned his officer's stripes and, later, was noticed by General Gaston, Marquis de Galliffet, and was promoted to orderly officer. He took part in the famous cavalry charge of the Chasseurs d'Afrique at Sedan. After his father's death in 1891, he became the 3rd Prince of Hénin (created 1828), 7th Marquis of Alsace (created ), 4th Count of Alsace (created 1810). He resigned from the military to take care of his estates in Vosges, Lorraine, including the Château de Bourlémont in Frebécourt. The Château had been acquired by his great-grandfather in 1769 from the Bauffremont family. At Bourlémont, d'Hénin hosted many notables, including Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau. ===Political career=== He served as Mayor of Frebécourt from 1894 until his death as well as General Councilor of Vosges in the Canton of Neufchâteau from 1892 until his death. In the 1893 legislative election, he received 5,627 votes but failed to be elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the legislative assembly of the French Parliament during the French Third Republic. After the election of Paul Frogier de Ponlevoy to the Senate, he ran again as a Republican candidate and was elected 20 May 1894 by 7,359 votes against 6,009 votes for M. Boussu. He ran unopposed in 1898 and was reelected by 10,336 votes. In November 1898, he was appointed member of the army commission. He was reelected again on 27 April 1902 by 10,091 votes to 116 votes for the radical Dr. Schneider. He was again elected in 1906, serving until 3 January 1909. On 3 January 1909, he was elected to the Senate of France. The Senate was composed of 300 members, 225 of whom were elected by the departments and colonies and 75 that were elected by the National Assembly. While serving as Senator for Vosges, he served alongside former Prime Minister Jules Méline representing Vosges. He was re-elected 11 January 1920 and on 9 January 1927, serving until his death on 24 February 1934. In the Senate, he devoted his attention to military matters and returned to service, with the rank of Squadron Chief, when World War I started. He was made Officier de la Légion d'honneur and was awarded the Croix de guerre for his efforts in the War. ==Personal life== On 19 April 1884, he was married to Charlotte Gabrielle de Ganay (1864–1942) in Paris.Acte de Mariage: Archives de Paris, Arrondissement 08, Mariages, Commence à 29 mars 1884, Termine à 22 avril 1884, Cote V4E 6096, acte 317, vue 29, consulté le 24 janvier 2020.

Her paternal grandfather was Charles-Alexandre, Marquis de Ganay. Her brother, Jean, Marquis de Ganay, was married to salonnière Berthe, Countess de Béhague and their son, Count Bernard de Ganay, married Magdeleine Goüin. The Prince d'Hénin died, without issue, at his home, 20 Rue Washington, Paris on 24 February 1934.

Diagram showing the basic design of Scintillator-coupled (Indirect) and Direct electron detectors. ==Traditional Detection Techniques== Traditionally, a TEM image or diffraction pattern could be observed using a fluorescent viewing screen, consisting of powdered ZnS or ZnS/CdS, which is excited by the electron beam via cathodoluminescence. Once the microscopist could see a suitable image on their viewing screen, images could then be recorded using photographic film. For electron microscopes, film typically consisted of a gelatin and silver halide emulsion layer on a plastic support base. The silver halide would be converted to silver upon exposure to the electron beam, and the film could then be chemically developed to form an image, which could be digitized for analysis using a film scanner. In modern TEMs, film has largely been replaced by electronic detectors. ==CCD Cameras== Charge coupled device (CCD) cameras were first applied to transmission electron microscopy in the 1980s and later became widespread. For use in a TEM, CCDs are typically coupled with a scintillator such as single crystal Yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) in which electrons from the electron beam are converted to photons, which are then transferred to the sensor of the CCD via a fiber optic plate. The main reason for this is that direct exposure to the high energy electron beam risks damaging the sensor CCD. A typical CCD for a TEM will also incorporate a Peltier cooling device to reduce the temperature of the sensor to approximately -30 °C, which reduces dark current and improves signal to noise. ==CMOS Cameras== More recently, scintillator and fiber optic coupled cameras based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics have become available for TEM. CMOS cameras have some advantages for electron microscopy compared to CCD cameras. One advantage is that CMOS cameras are less prone than CCD cameras to blooming, i.e. the spreading of charge from oversaturated pixels into nearby pixels. Another advantage is that CMOS cameras can have faster readout speeds. ==Direct Electron Detectors== The use of scintillators to convert electrons to photons in CCD and CMOS cameras reduces the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of these devices. Direct electron detectors, which have no scintillator and are directly exposed to the electron beam typically offer higher DQE than scintillator coupled cameras. There are two main types of direct electron detector, both of which were first introduced to electron microscopy in the 2000s. \\\\- A hybrid pixel detector, also known as a pixel array detector (PAD) features a sensor chip bonded to a separate electronics chip with each pixel read out in parallel. The pixels are typically wide and thick e.g. 150 x 150 x 500 um for the electron microscope pixel array detector (EMPAD) described by Tate et al. This large pixel size allows each pixel to fully absorb high energy electrons, enabling high dynamic range. However, the large pixel size limits the number of pixels that can be incorporated into a sensor. \\\\- A monolithic active pixel sensor (MAPS) for TEM is a CMOS based detector that has been radiation hardened to withstand direct exposure to the electron beam. The sensitive layer of the MAPS is typically very thin, with a thickness as low as 8 μm. This reduces the lateral spread of electrons from the electron beam within the detective layer of the sensor, allowing for smaller pixel sizes e.g. 6.5 x 6.5 um for a Direct Electron DE-16. Smaller pixel size allows for a large number of pixels to be incorporated into a sensor, although dynamic range is typically more limited than for a hybrid pixel detector. ==Detectors for Scanning TEM (STEM)== Atomic resolution imaging of SrTiO3, using annular dark field (ADF) and annular bright field (ABF) detectors. Overlay: strontium (green), titanium (grey) and oxygen (red). In scanning TEM (STEM), a focused probe is rastered over an area of interest, and a signal is recorded at each probe position to form an image. This typically requires different types of detector from conventional TEM imaging, in which a broad area of the specimen is illuminated. Traditional STEM imaging involves detectors, such as the annular dark-field (ADF) detector, which integrate the signal resulting from electrons from within a given range of scattering angles at each position of the raster. Such detectors may typically consist of a scintillator connected to photomultiplier tube. Segmented STEM detectors, first introduced in 1994 allow differential phase contrast information to be obtained. 4D STEM involves the use of an imaging camera, such as they hybrid pixel or MAPS direct electron detectors described above, to record an entire convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern at each STEM raster position. The resulting four-dimensional dataset can then be analyzed to reconstruct arbitrary STEM images, or extract other types of information from the specimen, such as strain, or electric and magnetic field maps. == References == Category:Electron microscopy ","title":"Detectors for transmission electron microscopy"},{"id":"63929470","text":"Hatice Nida Sen is an ophthalmologist researching mechanisms involved in different forms of human uveitis.

From special lagrangian to hermitian-Yang-Mills via Fourier-Mukai transform. arXiv preprint math/0005118. using mirror symmetry from the corresponding equations of motion for D-branes in the A-model of string theory. == Definition == In this section we present the dHYM equation as explained in the mathematical literature by Collins-Xie-Yau.Collins, T.C., XIIE, D. and YAU, S.T.G., 2018. The Deformed Hermitian–Yang–Mills Equation in Geometry and Physics. Geometry and Physics: Volume 1: A Festschrift in Honour of Nigel Hitchin, 1, p.69. The deformed Hermitian–Yang–Mills equation is a fully non-linear partial differental equation for a Hermitian metric on a line bundle over a compact Kähler manifold, or more generally for a real (1,1)-form. Namely, suppose (X,\\\\omega) is a Kähler manifold and [\\\\alpha] \\\\in H^{1,1}(X,\\\\mathbb{R}) is a class. The case of a line bundle consists of setting [\\\\alpha]=c_1(L) where c_1(L) is the first Chern class of a holomorphic line bundle L\\\\to X. Suppose that \\\\dim X = n and consider the topological constant :\\\\hat z([\\\\omega], [\\\\alpha]) = \\\\int_X (\\\\omega + i \\\\alpha)^n. Notice that \\\\hat z depends only on the class of \\\\omega and \\\\alpha. Suppose that \\\\hat z e 0. Then this is a complex number :\\\\hat z([\\\\omega], [\\\\alpha]) = r e^{i \\\\theta} for some real r>0 and angle \\\\theta\\\\in [0,2\\\\pi) which is uniquely determined. Fix a smooth representative differential form \\\\alpha in the class [\\\\alpha]. For a smooth function \\\\phi: X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} write \\\\alpha_{\\\\phi} = \\\\alpha + i \\\\partial \\\\bar \\\\partial \\\\phi, and notice that [\\\\alpha_{\\\\phi}] = [\\\\alpha]. The deformed Hermitian Yang–Mills equation for (X,\\\\omega) with respect to [\\\\alpha] is :\\\\begin{cases}\\\\operatorname{Im}(e^{-i\\\\theta} (\\\\omega + i \\\\alpha_{\\\\phi})^n) = 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Re}(e^{-i\\\\theta} (\\\\omega + i \\\\alpha_{\\\\phi})^n) > 0.\\\\end{cases} The second condition should be seen as a positivity condition on solutions to the first equation. That is, one looks for solutions to the equation \\\\operatorname{Im}(e^{-i\\\\theta} (\\\\omega + i \\\\alpha_{\\\\phi})^n) = 0 such that \\\\operatorname{Re}(e^{-i\\\\theta} (\\\\omega + i \\\\alpha_{\\\\phi})^n) > 0. This is in analogy to the related problem of finding Kähler-Einstein metrics by looking for metrics \\\\omega + i \\\\partial \\\\bar \\\\partial \\\\phi solving the Einstein equation, subject to the condition that \\\\phi is a Kähler potential (which is a positivity condition on the form \\\\omega + i \\\\partial \\\\bar \\\\partial \\\\phi). == Discussion == === Relation to Hermitian Yang–Mills equation === The dHYM equations can be transformed in several ways to illuminate several key properties of the equations. First, simple algebraic manipulation shows that the dHYM equation may be equivalently written :\\\\operatorname{Im}((\\\\omega+i\\\\alpha)^n)=\\\\tan \\\\theta \\\\operatorname{Re}((\\\\omega+i\\\\alpha)^n). In this form, it is possible to see the relation between the dHYM equation and the regular Hermitian Yang–Mills equation. In particular, the dHYM equation should look like the regular HYM equation in the so-called large volume limit. Precisely, one replaces the Kähler form \\\\omega by k\\\\omega for a positive integer k, and allows k\\\\to \\\\infty. Notice that the phase \\\\theta_k for (X,k\\\\omega,[\\\\alpha]) depends on k. In fact, \\\\tan \\\\theta_k = O(k^{-1}), and we can expand :(k\\\\omega + i \\\\alpha)^n = k^n \\\\omega^n + i n k^{n-1} \\\\omega^{n-1}\\\\wedge \\\\alpha + O(k^{n-2}). Here we see that :\\\\operatorname{Re}((k\\\\omega + i \\\\alpha)^n) = k^n \\\\omega^n + O(k^{n-2}),\\\\quad \\\\operatorname{Im}((k\\\\omega + i \\\\alpha)^n) = nk^{n-1} \\\\omega^{n-1}\\\\wedge \\\\alpha + O(k^{n-3}), and we see the dHYM equation for k\\\\omega takes the form :C k^{n-1} \\\\omega^n + O(k^{n-3}) = n k^{n-1} \\\\omega^{n-1} \\\\wedge \\\\alpha + O(k^{n-3}) for some topological constant C determined by \\\\tan \\\\theta. Thus we see the leading order term in the dHYM equation is :n\\\\omega^{n-1}\\\\wedge \\\\alpha = C \\\\omega^n which is just the HYM equation (replacing \\\\alpha by F(h) if necessary). === Local form === The dHYM equation may also be written in local coordinates. Fix p\\\\in X and holomorphic coordinates (z^1,\\\\dots,z^n) such that at the point p, we have :\\\\omega = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n i dz^j \\\\wedge d\\\\bar z^j,\\\\quad \\\\alpha = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\lambda_j i dz^j \\\\wedge d\\\\bar z^j. Here \\\\lambda_j \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} for all j as we assumed \\\\alpha was a real form. Define the Lagrangian phase operator to be :\\\\Theta_{\\\\omega}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\arctan(\\\\lambda_j). Then simple computation shows that the dHYM equation in these local coordinates takes the form :\\\\Theta_{\\\\omega}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\phi where \\\\phi = \\\\theta\\\\mod 2\\\\pi. In this form one sees that the dHYM equation is fully non-linear and elliptic. == Solutions == It is possible to use algebraic geometry to study the existence of solutions to the dHYM equation, as demonstrated by the work of Collins- Jacob-Yau and Collins-Yau.Collins, T.C., Jacob, A. and Yau, S.T., 2015. (1, 1) forms with specified Lagrangian phase: a priori estimates and algebraic obstructions. arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.01934.Collins, T.C. and Yau, S.T., 2018. Moment maps, nonlinear PDE, and stability in mirror symmetry. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.04824.Collins, T.C. and Shi, Y., 2020. Stability and the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.04831. Suppose that V\\\\subset X is any analytic subvariety of dimension p. Define the central charge Z_V([\\\\alpha]) by :Z_V([\\\\alpha]) = -\\\\int_V e^{-i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha}. When the dimension of X is 2, Collins-Jacob-Yau show that if \\\\operatorname{Im}(Z_X([\\\\alpha]))>0, then there exists a solution of the dHYM equation in the class [\\\\alpha]\\\\in H^{1,1}(X,\\\\mathbb{R}) if and only if for every curve C\\\\subset X we have :\\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z_C([\\\\alpha])}{Z_X([\\\\alpha])}\\\\right)>0. In the specific example where X=\\\\operatorname{Bl}_p \\\\mathbb{CP}^n, the blow-up of complex projective space, Jacob-Sheu show that [\\\\alpha] admits a solution to the dHYM equation if and only if Z_X([\\\\alpha]) e 0 and for any V\\\\subset X, we similarly have :\\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z_V([\\\\alpha])}{Z_X([\\\\alpha])}\\\\right)>0.A. Jacob, and N. Sheu, The deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation on the blow-up of P n, in preparation It has been shown by Gao Chen that in the so-called supercritical phase, where \\\\frac{(n-2)\\\\pi}{2} < \\\\theta < \\\\frac{n\\\\pi}{2}, algebraic conditions analogous to those above imply the existence of a solution to the dHYM equation.Chen, G., 2020. Supercritical deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.12202. This is achieved through comparisons between the dHYM and the so-called J-equation in Kähler geometry. The J-equation appears as the *small volume limit* of the dHYM equation, where \\\\omega is replaced by \\\\varepsilon \\\\omega for a small real number \\\\varepsilon>0 and one allows \\\\epsilon\\\\to 0. In general it is conjectured that the existence of solutions to the dHYM equation for a class [\\\\alpha] = c_1(L) should be equivalent to the Bridgeland stability of the line bundle L. This is motivated both from comparisons with similar theorems in the non-deformed case, such as the famous Kobayashi–Hitchin correspondence which asserts that solutions exist to the HYM equations if and only if the underlying bundle is slope stable. It is also motivated by physical reasoning coming from string theory, which predicts that physically realistic B-branes (those admitting solutions to the dHYM equation for example) should correspond to Π-stability.Douglas, M.R., Fiol, B. and Römelsberger, C., 2005. Stability and BPS branes. Journal of High Energy Physics, 2005(09), p.006. == Relation to string theory == Superstring theory predicts that spacetime is 10-dimensional, consisting of a Lorentzian manifold of dimension 4 (usually assumed to be Minkowski space or De sitter or anti-De Sitter space) along with a Calabi-Yau manifold X of dimension 6 (which therefore has complex dimension 3). In this string theory open strings must satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on their endpoints. These conditions require that the end points of the string lie on so-called D-branes (D for Dirichlet), and there is much mathematical interest in describing these branes. Open strings with endpoints fixed on D-branes In the B-model of topological string theory, homological mirror symmetry suggests D-branes should be viewed as elements of the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi-Yau 3-fold X.Aspinwall, P.S., 2005. D-Branes on Calabi-Yau Manifolds. In Progress in String Theory: TASI 2003 Lecture Notes. Edited by MALDACENA JUAN M. Published by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd., 2005. , pp. 1-152 (pp. 1-152). This characterisation is abstract, and the case of primary importance, at least for the purpose of phrasing the dHYM equation, is when a B-brane consists of a holomorphic submanifold Y\\\\subset X and a holomorphic vector bundle E\\\\to Y over it (here Y would be viewed as the support of the coherent sheaf E over X), possibly with a compatible Chern connection on the bundle. This Chern connection arises from a choice of Hermitian metric h on E, with corresponding connection abla and curvature form F(h). Ambient on the spacetime there is also a B-field or Kalb–Ramond field B (not to be confused with the B in B-model), which is the string theoretic equivalent of the classical background electromagnetic field (hence the use of B, which commonly denotes the magnetic field strength).Freed, D.S. and Witten, E., 1999. Anomalies in string theory with $ D $-branes. Asian Journal of Mathematics, 3(4), pp.819-852. Mathematically the B-field is a gerbe or bundle gerbe over spacetime, which means B consists of a collection of two-forms B_i \\\\in \\\\Omega^2(U_i) for an open cover U_i of spacetime, but these forms may not agree on overlaps, where they must satisfy cocycle conditions in analogy with the transition functions of line bundles (0-gerbes).Laine, K., 2009. Geometric and topological aspects of Type IIB D-branes. arXiv preprint arXiv:0912.0460. This B-field has the property that when pulled back along the inclusion map \\\\iota: Y \\\\to X the gerbe is trivial, which means the B-field may be identified with a globally defined two-form on Y, written \\\\beta. The differential form \\\\alpha discussed above in this context is given by \\\\alpha = F(h) + \\\\beta, and studying the dHYM equations in the special case where \\\\alpha = F(h) or equivalently [\\\\alpha] = c_1(L) should be seen as turning the B-field off or setting \\\\beta = 0, which in string theory corresponds to a spacetime with no background higher electromagnetic field. The dHYM equation describes the equations of motion for this D-brane (Y,E) in spacetime equipped with a B-field B, and is derived from the corresponding equations of motion for A-branes through mirror symmetry. Mathematically the A-model describes D-branes as elements of the Fukaya category of X, special Lagrangian submanifolds of X equipped with a flat unitary line bundle over them, and the equations of motion for these A-branes is understood. In the above section the dHYM equation has been phrased for the D6-brane Y=X. ==See also== *Hermitian Yang–Mills connection *Yang–Mills connection ==References== Category:Geometry Category:String theory Category:Differential geometry Category:Partial differential equations ","title":"Deformed Hermitian Yang–Mills equation"},{"id":"63929724","text":"George Barry Ford (October 28, 1885 – August 1, 1978) was an American Roman Catholic priest, advocate of civil rights, and the chaplain who, along with Fr.

Lammens in 2019 as chairman of San Lorenzo The club was in a dire situation at the time of Lammens's takeover, highly indebted and with a large operative deficit, and in the midst of a club workers' strike due to the former presidency's inability to pay their wages. The club's football team's position in the Primera División was threatened by a row of bad results, a situation that wouldn't be reversed until 2013. The Lammens-Tinelli leadership proved effective in reducing the club's financial woes, and the 2013 Torneo Inicial victory was hailed as a turnaround for San Lorenzo under its new directive board. Lammens later presented Pope Francis (a fan and follower of the club) with a replica of the coup. Later, in 2014, San Lorenzo won the Copa Libertadores for the first time in the club's history. Lammens is also credited with lobbying the Buenos Aires City Legislature into ceding a space in the Boedo neighbourhood (historic home of San Lorenzo) to build the club's new home stadium. In October 2014 Lammens rejected an offer by the Azerbaijani government to sponsor the club, citing Azerbaijan's poor human rights record and the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh; the move drew praise from Argentina's sizeable Armenian community. ==Political career== Mario Meoni (right, minister of transport) and Lammens as minister of tourism and sports during a conference in January 2020. ===Buenos Aires mayoral run=== In June 2019, Lammens stated his intention of running for Chief of Government (mayor) of Buenos Aires in that year's election as part of a broad front in opposition to the Republican Proposal-led government, composed of progressive and centre- left parties and leaders, saying that \\"Kirchnerism is not enough in the City\\". He confirmed his pre-candidacy (ahead of the simultaneous and mandatory open primaries) on 19 June 2019, as part of the Frente de Todos, the peronist coalition that endorsed the presidential candidacy of Alberto Fernández. His mayoral ticket was completed by journalist and writer Gisela Marziotta, who ran as vice-chief of government. His campaign was focused on Mauricio Macri's perceived economic mismanagements in the national government and the incumbent Horacio Rodríguez Larreta association with the president and his party. At the election on 27 October 2019, Lammens received a 687.026 votes – or 35% –, losing in the first round against Rodríguez Larreta's 55.9%. Despite the wide loss margin, Lammens's share of the votes represents the best electoral result for an opposition party in Buenos Aires City since Mauricio Macri's victory in 2007. ===Ministry of Tourism and Sports=== On 10 December 2019, Lammens was appointed by incoming president Alberto Fernández as minister of the newly restored Ministry of Tourism and Sports, succeeding Gustavo Santos and Diógenes de Urquiza, respectively the secretaries of Tourism and of Sports in Mauricio Macri's cabinet. Sports-wise, Lammens stated his intention of focusing on neighbourhood clubs. ==Personal life== Lammens is married to sociologist Mariana Gené, with whom he lives in the neighbourhood of Palermo, in Buenos Aires. He defines himself as agnostic, and is in favor of the legalization of abortion in Argentina. ==References== ==External links== * MatiasLammens on Twitter * Official website of the Ministry of Tourism and Sports Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine lawyers Category:Businesspeople from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine football chairmen and investors L Category:Government ministers of Argentina Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni ","title":"Matías Lammens"},{"id":"63929783","text":"Lorraine Bénic (born July 27, 1937) is a Canadian painter, sculptor and printmaker.

It is widely distributed through the world, where it grows on natural and artificial rocky substrates in the shade, often in sheltered underhangs. It forms a greenish crust on the surface of its substrate. ==Taxonomy== It was originally described by lichenologist Erik Acharius in 1799. Maurice Choisy placed it in the genus Psilolechia in 1949. There are known to be two chemical races of P. lucida. The first, which is known all over the world, contains rhizocarpic acid as a major secondary substance as well as some unknown substances. The second, reported only from Australia and New Zealand, has both rhizocarpic acid and zeorin. ==Description== Psilolechia lucida forms a sulphur-yellow to yellowish green crust, although the colour is greener when the surface is wet. The crust comprises powdery soredia that can be thin or thick, and sometimes divided into irregular areoles. The apothecia (typically less than 0.3 mm in diameter) are yellow, ranging in shape from hemispherical to irregular and lumpy, and lack margins. The ascospores, which number eight per ascus, measure 4–7 by 1–2.5 μm. ==Habitat and distribution== This is a widespread species that is found throughout the world. It is common and widely distributed in Europe. In Asia, Psilolechia lucida has been reported from Japan; from the Middle East is found in Turkey; from Africa, it is known from the Canary Islands, and Madeira. In South America, it has only been reported from Bolivia and Chile. It has also been found in Oceania, Central America, and the Antarctic Peninsula. It grows on rocks, both calcareous and siliceous, as well as artificial rocky substrates such as bricks and concrete. The lichen grows in the shade, and is often found growing in sheltered underhangs. Rarely, it is found growing on hardwood tree bark, at the base of the tree or on the roots above ground. ==Similar species== Chrysothrix flavovirens, the yellow pine dust lichen, is similar in morphology and could be confused with Psilolechia lucida. They differ in their ecology, however: C. flavovirens grows on tree bark, whereas P. lucida is mostly grows on rocks and only sporadically is found as a facultative epiphyte. ==References== Category:Fungi described in 1799 Category:Fungi of Africa Category:Fungi of Antarctica Category:Fungi of Australia Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of Japan Category:Fungi of New Zealand Category:Fungi of Central America Category:Fungi of North America Category:Fungi of Oceania Category:Lecanorales Category:Taxa named by Erik Acharius ","title":"Psilolechia lucida"},{"id":"63929787","text":"Sylvia Nickerson is a Canadian comic book writer.

It operates to allow property (the accessory) to merge with (or accede to) another object (the principal), either moveable or heritable (land). Accessio derives from the Roman law concept of the same name. Other jurisdictions employ similar rules. The leading case in this area is said to be Brand's Trustees v Brand's Trustees (1876) 3 R (HL) 16. A common example is a tree (the accessory) acceding to the land (the principal), thereby the tree is owned by the owner of the land on which it is planted by the operation of accession. Accession may appear similar to other modes of original acquisition, but each mode has discrete differences. Importantly, accession does not produce a new object (rem) in itself, such as specificatio, accesio merely accessorises one object to another (the principal). == Types of Accession == There are broadly two types of accession: (1) natural accession and (2) human accession.Erskine Institute II,1,15; Bell Principles ss 1297, 1298. === Natural Accession === Natural accession occurs by the operation of nature alone,Erskine Institute II,1,15 eg: A tree sapling owned by C is planted in a garden owned to B, a cow belonging to F impregnates a cow belonging to G, thereby acceeding ownership of the calf foetus to G. === Human Accession === Industrial, or human, accession occurs whereby property are merged artificially, such as by welding, drilling or other permanent affixment. eg: a hood ornament, owned by Z, is welded to a car, owned by a W. == Requirements for Accession == It is now recognised that there are three requirements for accession to occur, irrespective if human or natural accession.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, para 571. These are: === (1) Physical Union === Accession requires a physical bond or attachment between the two objects. e.g.: a tree can be physically attached to land by taking root === (2) Functional Subordination === The accessory must be functionally subordinate to the principal. === (3) Permanency === The accessory must be merged to the principal in a permanent manner. This is to ensure that attachments of short length do not create an accession.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Accession, para 571. E.g.: A tent recently affixed to the land it is erected upon does not accede as there is no permanency. The test for accession is said to be applied \\"mechanically\\",Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 13, Accession, para 572. ie: the circumstances of the accession are not analysed. Viscount Stair was of the opinion that accession can occur irrespective of the consentSee Dixon v Fisher (1843) 5 D 775 at 793, per Lord Cockburn. or bad faith in the merger of the accessory and principal. Stair Institutions II,1,38,39. As consent is irrelevant, neither owner can contract out of accession occurring.Shetland Islands Council v BP Petroleum Development Ltd 1990 SLT 82 == Legal Effects of Accession == There are three legal effects where accession has occurred, whereby the principal and accessory become owned by the principal's owner insevereably.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, para 574. These are: === (1) The accessory becomes part of the principal === The accessory, as a matter of property law, becomes an inherent part of the principal. This means that where the ownership of the principal is transferred, ownership will travel with it, eg: when a house is sold, the tree planted in the garden of the house is transferred with the land. === (2) Conversion === If the accessory is a different class to the principal, the accessory will be reclassified (ie converted) as the class of the principal.Erskine Institute II,2,2,4. Eg: the tree planted in the garden of a house is no longer a corporeal moveable property, but is considered corporeal heritable property. === (3) Extinction of Title === Ownership of the accessory is extinguished by ownership of the principal.Stair Institutions II,1,34; Erskine II,1,14; Bell Principles ss 1297, 1298. In circumstances where ownership (title) of an accessory was held by a separate individual from the owner of the principal, the owner of the principal becomes the owner of the accessory.Brand's Trustees v Brand's Trustees (1876) 3 R (HL) 16 Thus, ownership of the accessory is extinguished. Eg: A tree sapling, owned by C, is planted in the garden of a house owned by D. At the moment it is considered to have acceded, ie: when the tree takes root in the soil of the garden, thereby meeting the above three tests of accession, ownership of the tree now belongs to D.  Compensation  There is no legal authority for compensating owners of accessories who have had their right extinguished by natural accession.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Ch 12, para 577. However, where extinction of a separate individual's ownership occurs by way of industrial, or human, accession (eg: a hood ornament, owned by Z, is welded to a car, owned by a W), compensation from the principal owner is available only where the principal's owner instructed the accessory's owner to merge the object, or the principal merged the accessory himself.Stair Institutions II,1,38 and 39; Bankton Institute I,9,43; II,1,17 Where an accessory owner has the merged the object, compensation is not recoverable unless the owner of the accessory acted in good faith and has a reasonable, but mistaken, belief that he owned the principal.Barbour v Halliday (1840) 2 D 1279; Buchanan v Stewart (1874) 2 R 78; Duke of Hamilton v Johnston (1877) 14 SLR 298. In such circumstances, the law of unjustified enrichment, part of the Scots law of obligations applies.Scotland Act 1998 s.126 Where a third party, and is not an agent of the two owners, has merged the two objects to cause accession; compensation is recoverable from the third party.Good Faith: Stair I,7,2; Erskine III,1,10. Bad Faith: Oliver and Boyd v Marr Typefounding Co Ltd (1901) 9 SLT 170, OH; International Banking Corpn v Ferguson Shaw & Sons 1910 SC 182, 1909 2 SLT 377 As compensation falls as part of a personal right, enforcement of a right of compensation does not apply to subsequent owners of the principal.Beattie v Lord Napier (1831) 9 S 639. == Separation of Accessory == If the accessory is removed from the principal, eg: the tree in the house of the garden owned by D (see above examples) is dug up by a thief, E, the property is reconverted to its original class of property (e.g.: the tree, once uprooted, is considered a moveable again) and is considered an independent piece of property again. However, ownership of the accessory does not fall by occupatio to the removing individual but is widely considered to remain with the owner of the principal before the accession. However, there is authority in Scots law that the original owner of the accessory obtains ownership so this rule may subject to subsequent clarification,Scottish Discount Co Ltd v Blin 1985 SC 216, at 226; Stair II,1,38. eg: the young tree planted by C in the garden belonging to D, uprooted and stolen by E would legally belong to C again under this interpretation of the law of accession. == Moveable Accessory acceding to Heritable Principal (Fixtures) == Moveable accessories that have acceded to a heritable principal are known as fixtures, with similar concepts of the same name found in other legal jurisdictions. Fixtures, ie: that which has acceded by the three rules above, should not be confused with fittings (such as chairs, desks, drawers). Fixtures alone transfer with the heritable principal,Christie v Smith's Executrix 1949 SC 572, 1950 SLT 31 fittings do not. The three requirements for accession must always be met. However it is possible for the weight of a fitting alone to cause it to accede to the heritable property, irrespective of the physical union to the land.Christie v Smith’s Exr 1949 SC 572 Functional subordination must also apply here too, the accessory must be functionally subordinate to the heritable property for it to accede.Assessor for Fife v Hodgson 1966 SC 30. Difficulty can arise where it can be difficult to identify where a fixture is functionally subordinate, as such the issue of functional subordination is dependent of the fact of the case at hand.Cochrane v Stevenson (1891) 18 R 1208. The test for functional subordination of fixtures is expressed by Gretton & Steven as: > \\"does the item appear to be attached for the improvement of the land or for > the better enjoyment of the item?\\" In certain situations, a constructive fixture can accede to heritable property where it traditionally would not be considered to be an accessory. A notable example of this is the keys to a house or moveable parts of a machine that itself is a fixture of heritable property.Fisher v Dixon (1843) 5 D 775 at 801, per Lord Cockburn. As discussed above, due to the narrow test for fixtures, it is common practice for fittings to also be included in the sale and subsequent transfer in any event, either expressly or impliedly as a matter of Scots contract law. It is common practice, for example in the missives of sale of a house, to include certain fittings such as whitegoods or curtains, as is the case with the Scottish Standard Clauses. This means that a voluntary transfer of fittings will also take place when the heritable property (land) is sold to avoid any disputes or litigation as to what it is classified as a fixture or fitting. == Heritable Accessory acceding to Heritable Moveable (Alluvion or Alluvio) == Heritable property is capable of acceding to other heritable property, known as alluvio after the Roman law method of acquisition of the same name. This primarily operates by rivers or other moving-waters such as the tide depositing sediment, or alluvium, deposited by a river. It should not be confused with avulsion, which occurs when there is a deposit of sediment after a heavy storm or other weather event. == Accession of Fruits == Certain fruits, fructus, or products (the accessory) accede to the property (the principal) that created them. The institutional writers considered there were three cases where accession of fruits occurs:Stair Institutions II,1,34; Bankton Institute II,1,10; Erskine Institute II,1,14; Bell Principles s 1297 === Animals in utero === A animal mother's child in the womb belongs to the owner of the mother while the child remains in utero (gestation period or pregnancy).Lamb v Grant (1874) 11 SLR 672. The accession ends upon the birth of the child but as the owner of principal will still retain ownership of the accessory (see above), the child will belong to the owner of the mother. === Natural Products of Plants and Animals === Natural products of plants (e.g.: sap, flowers, fruits etc.) and animals (milk, fur, honey, etc.) accede to the principal until they are physically separated. === Trees, Plants, Crops === Trees, plants and other crops accede to the land (heritable accessory) upon which they take root.Erskine II,1,15. However, an important exception is made for industrial crops. which do not accede to the land they are rooted upon. == References == Category:Scotland Category:Scots law Category:Roman law Category:Civil law (legal system) ","title":"Accession (Scots law)"},{"id":"63929864","text":"The Makury tribe (sometimes spelt Makuri, Makware) is one of the Naga tribes that mostly resides in Naga Self-Administered Zone in Myanmar and some in Nagaland, India.

A devout Catholic, he served as chairman and later director of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe (CCJP) from 1978 until 1999. He also served as a member of Parliament for Harare Central from 2000 to 2003, when he resigned and emigrated to Ireland. Born in Mutare, Southern Rhodesia, and raised in the Mberengwa area, Auret came from a family of farmers. After leaving St. George's College in 1955, he served in the armies of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia for ten years. He took up cattle farming in Mberengwa from 1966 to 1978, after which he joined the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. Soon after, he received a conscription notice from the Rhodesian Security Forces and rather than enlisting, fled with his family to the United Kingdom. He returned to the independent Zimbabwe in 1980 and resumed work with the CCJP. During the 1980s, he led the organizations effort's to document and put and end to the Gukurahundi massacres, perpetrated in Matabeleland by forces directed by Prime Minister Robert Mugabe's government. Auret left the commission in 1999 and became involved in the political opposition to Mugabe and his ruling ZANU–PF party. In 2000, he was elected to Parliament for the newly-formed Movement for Democratic Change. Amid escalating political violence and reportedly due to ill health, he resigned in 2003 and emigrated, first to Cape Town, South Africa, and then to County Offaly, Ireland, where he remained until his death in 2020. == Early life and military service == Michael Theodore Hayes Auret was born on 14 December 1936 in Umtali, Southern Rhodesia. The descendent of Huguenot settlers in South Africa, he came from a family of farmers who had settled in eastern Southern Rhodesia. His father, Smiley Auret, farmed in Belingwe District, where Auret would later also farm. Auret began his education at a Dominican convent school in Umtali, and then studied from 1947 to 1955 at the Jesuit-run St. George's College in the capital, Salisbury, where he father had been one of the first students in 1898. He initially planned to become a Catholic priest until he met and married his wife, Diana Doherty, in 1958. In 1956, he joined the army of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and was stationed in Ndola, Northern Rhodesia. When the Federation dissolved in 1963, he returned home and joined the Southern Rhodesian Army. He resigned as a captain in 1966, shortly after Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence. == Career and activism == === Rhodesia === After leaving the army in 1966, Auret went on to manage a 27,000-acre cattle farm in Belingwe, about from Bulawayo. In the leadup to the 1969 constitutional referendum, Auret campaigned against the adoption of a republican form of government that would end Rhodesia's ties to the British monarchy. The proposed constitution was supported overwhelming by the country's white voters, and Rhodesia became a republic in 1970. In 1974, Auret unsuccessfully ran for Parliament for the Bulawayo District constituency. Representing the moderate Rhodesia Party, he lost with 22.5 percent of the vote to the incumbent MP, Alec Moseley of the Rhodesian Front, who received 77.5 percent of the 1,613 votes cast. In early 1977, during the Rhodesian Bush War, black guerrillas burned down the house of Auret's assistant farm manager, but spared Auret's home and his farm equipment. The guerrillas left two notes, one of which said, \\"We don't hate whites. We left your property because you are a friend of the people.\\" In 1978, Auret abandoned farming and began working for the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Rhodesia (CCJP), a human rights organization putting him at odds with the government. He was motivated by a desire to expose war atrocities by Rhodesian forces, who had tortured some of his farm workers. Not long after, he received a conscription notice from the Rhodesian Security Forces. Auret was in Rome with two Rhodesian bishops on a CCJP trip to meet Pope John Paul II, and was advised not to return to Rhodesia. His wife and children discreetly packed their things and left the country. After reuniting in Rome, the family went to Switzerland and then the United Kingdom, where they were eventually granted refugee status. There, Auret worked Part-time jobs to support his family. In 1979, while still in exile, he was part of a delegation of Rhodesians to the United States seeking assistance in facilitating the start of peace talks. Later that year, negotiations did occur, resulting in the Lancaster House Agreement, which ended the war and set the stage for Rhodesia's reconstitution as the internationally recognized, independent Zimbabwe. === Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace and Gukurahundi === Auret returned to Zimbabwe soon after the 1980 general election that determined the country's first government and Parliament. He started work training small-scale black farmers. He became chairman of the renamed Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe, and began documenting atrocities committed by Zimbabwean forces during the Gukurahundi massacres in the Matabeleland region. Auret arranged a 16 March 1983 meeting at State House in Harare between himself, a delegation of Catholic bishops, and Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, in an effort to stop the killings. The bishops present included the Archbishop of Bulawayo, Heinrich Karlen, Mutare auxiliary bishop Patrick Mutume, and the Bishop of Chinhoyi, Helmut Reckter. As a result of the meeting, Mugabe lifted the curfew that had been in place and named a commission of inquiry to investigate the violence. Karlen provided a large amount of evidence he had collected, but when the commission concluded its work in 1984, Mugabe prevented its findings from being released. The Legal Resources Foundation, a non-governmental organization, sought a court order for their release, but its application was denied. Under Auret's direction, the CCJP to start its own investigations to ensure the violence would be publicly documented. The report, published jointly by the CCJP and Legal Resources Foundation and presented by Auret to Mugabe, was entitled \\"Breaking the Silence: Building True Peace.\\" It estimated that roughly 20,000 people were killed or disappeared over the course of the Gukurahundi, which lasted from 1983 to 1987. The report was ignored by the Archbishop of Harare, Patrick Chakaipa, a Mugabe ally, and was only endorsed by Archbishop Karlen and one other influential Catholic. It did not make much of an impact in Zimbabwe at the time, but was sent to South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper, which reported on it and published a copy online. On 5 June 1986, Auret was detained by police, along with CCJP director Nicholas Ndebele. They were released later that day after Auret's wife, Diana, phoned Prime Minister Mugabe. Mugabe said he had already ordered their release. At a press conference in Harare the next day, Auret thanked the prime minister and said he believed he and Ndebele had been detained because the home affairs minister, Enos Nkala, suspected the CCJP of providing information about human rights in Zimbabwe to Amnesty International, a London-based watchdog organization. Auret added that the CCJP had met with Nkala in December 1985 to deny the allegations, but that he did not think Nkala believed them. Auret served as chairman of the CCJP until 1990, after which he became the organization's director. In February 1999, President Mugabe made a veiled threat against Auret during a televised address. Auret retired from the CCJP in 1999. === Opposition politics and election to Parliament === Auret joined the National Constituent Assembly (NCA) when it was established in 1997, and served as its first vice chairman under Morgan Tsvangirai. He joined the newly-formed Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in 1999, and successfully stood as the party's candidate in the June 2000 parliamentary election for Harare Central. He had been selected in April of that year to stand as the MDC candidate in that constituency over Learnmore Jongwe, the party's secretary for information and publicity, and Paurina Gwanyanya, the secretary for labour. He won overwhelmingly with 14,207 votes, defeating former deputy mayor of Harare, Winston Dzawo of ZANU–PF, who received 3,620 votes, as well as two minor candidates. In February 2001, Auret was warned by a colleague with connections to ZANU–PF that leaders within the ruling party were planning to \\"take out\\" a prominent white MDC member by the end of the month. The MDC had three white parliamentarians at the time, Auret, David Coltart, and Trudy Stevenson. Stevenson excluded herself and said she thought the target would be either Auret or Coltart, who were both frequently singled out for criticism by Mugabe in speeches. Coltart confirmed Stevenson's statements to a US State Department contact, and added that the warning to Auret had been delivered by James Mushore, a top official at the National Merchant Bank. Coltart said he had been received information from three sources, including Clive Puzey, an MDC colleague with a contact in the Central Intelligence Organisation, that he—not Auret—was the target. == Later life and death == Amid escalating political violence and reportedly due to ill health, Auret resigned his seat in Parliament on 27 February 2003. He emigrated to Cape Town, South Africa, and then Ireland, where he settled in County Offaly and worked for the Catholic Church. He wrote a book, From Liberator to Dictator: An Insider’s Account of Robert Mugabe’s Descent into Tyranny, published in 2009, in which he described how he misjudged Mugabe's intentions at independence in 1980. He stated at an event in London in 2007 that he \\"didn't take in that [Mugabe] was a committed Marxist and that he wanted a one-party state.\\" Auret died at his home in Cloghan, County Offaly, Ireland, on 10 April 2020. Due to Health Service Executive directives against public gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, his funeral was held privately. In a statement posted on its official Facebook page, the Movement for Democratic Change called Auret a \\"hero and a patriot,\\" and gave its condolences to his family.

He began his basic military service on October 1, 1910, in Sankt Pölten (Saint Hypolit), Austria; spent a year at a military school in Linz; served briefly as a platoon commander; and then took a job with the state post office. ==Military career== After the mobilization in July 1914, he was called up to service in the Austro-Hungarian army on August 3, 1914. In October his unit was sent to the Russian front; on December 21, 1914, he was captured by the Russians. At the POW camp in Pokrov, he was involved in the prisoners’ self-government, and in July 1916 he voluntarily joined the Serbian army, in which he was named a platoon commander. In December of that year he became a member of the officers’ staff under General J. Cervinka and on June 12, 1917, he was appointed to command the 8th Rifle Regiment. After a brief period of study at the school of trench warfare in Jassách, he was promoted to the rank of captain and appointed battalion commander on August 29, 1918. Returning to Czechoslovakia as a major in the summer of 1920, he became deputy commander of the 8th Infantry Regiment, and on November 17, 1922, was named its commander. Between 1924 and 1928 he took courses for senior commanders, and in early 1929 was appointed commander of the 16th Infantry Brigade in Místek; in the summer of that year he was promoted to the rank of general. In 1930 he became deputy commander of the Provincial Military Command in Košice, and later served, in turn, as commander of the brigade in Znojmo, as deputy commander of the division in Brno, and as commander of the II. group. He was in the last-named post at the time of the mobilization in September 1938.Československá generalita v roce 1938; Personalie Prehledy; ===Anti- German resistance=== After the March 1939 occupation, several generals and senior officers of the Czech army established an illegal military resistance group called Defense of the Nation (ON). Slunečko became the regional military commander of Moravia-West, based in Brno, and headed the Alex intelligence group under the code name of General Slunecek. The command of ON was almost totally destroyed between 1939 and 1941 as the Gestapo gradually arrested and executed many of its members. The group's remaining leaders regrouped in Bohemia and Moravia under Zdeněk Novák; after further arrests, Slunečko became the leader of ON and relocated to Prague, where he appointed General Kutlvašr as commander of the capital.Osvobozeni; Rozhlas; After the start of the Prague Uprising, Alex placed itself under the leadership of the Czech National Council (CNR). ===Prague Uprising=== On May 5, 1945, General Slunečko ordered the Prague military headquarters, \\"Bartos,\\" and all units outside Prague to revolt against the Nazi occupiers. At 11 A.M., under his direction, the Czech police occupied the radio, telephone exchange, railway station, main post office, and other strategic locations in the city. The Prague Uprising fully broke out at about noon. On May 8, Slunečko headed a delegation of the Czech National Council to which the German occupiers surrendered in Český Brod. After Karel Kutlvašr's liberation from the prison in Pankrác, he took command of all units at Alex's headquarters and Slunečko became his deputy.Pražské povstání 1945; Osudové okamžiky Československa, Themis Praha 1997; ===After the war=== After VE Day, Alex was closed down and on May 25 František Slunečko, now a brigadier general, was appointed provisional commander of the first army corps in Prague. On October 28 he was named commander and promoted to the rank of divisional general. He retired on June 1, 1946. Like many former officers and resistance fighters, he later faced various provocations, charges, and investigations. Although he was not convicted of anything, after being released from custody of the State Court, he was demoted to the rank of private in 1950 and was forced to move from Prague to Branžež.JAKL, Tomáš.

From 1984–2000, it hosted a wide range of one night activities, such as artist conversations, panel discussions, exhibitions, screenings and performances. The organization consisted of two consecutive phases from 1984–1988 in Hoboken, New Jersey and from 1991–2000 in the Greenpoint Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Throughout its life Four Walls was situated in growing creative communities where it served to encourage an exchange of ideas and generated alternative ways of experiencing art. Four Walls was an influential art space for creative experimentation that brought together a spectrum of visual artists and non-artists in a process of collective art making, exhibition and discussion. It hosted various types of events that were often theatrical in nature with a humorous and playful approach. Neither a commercial gallery nor a nonprofit, Four Walls had an informal and artist driven structure as opposed to a typical arts administration approach. In this regard, it was a self- sufficient anarchic structure that consciously avoided many relationships of the larger New York art market. == Hoboken 1984-1988 == Four Walls began as a single night exhibition space in Hoboken New Jersey by artist founders Adam Simon and Michele Araujo. It was active between 1984 and 1988. The idea grew from a conversation Simon and Araujo had with Adam Simon's uncle Barney Simon, who had co-founded the Market Theater in Johannesburg South Africa in 1976. In this conversation, Simon and Araujo had expressed their dissatisfaction with the commercial exhibitions in nearby Manhattan. At the time, Adam Simon had an exhibition of his paintings at Touchstone Gallery, a Fifty-Seventh Street gallery in Manhattan but was disappointed at the lack of critical discourse surrounding the exhibition process. Barney Simon encouraged them to take action. In response, the couple, with the help of many fellow artists, would begin to host one night exhibitions that included a forum for conversation. These exhibitions would be two person exhibitions or larger group exhibitions. The exhibitions at Four Walls differed from conventional art exhibitions of the time in significant ways. Typically in a commercial gallery exhibition audience members would visit the exhibition separately over a period of weeks and criticism and discussion would occur at a later date. Four Walls diverged from this structure in that it consisted of a single night exhibition that included a public conversation. The evenings began in the manner of a typical art opening, allowing visitors to view the exhibition, however, later in the evening benches were set out and the audience would sit, listen and participate in a conversation in some way related to the exhibition. This conversation was between the artists or an invited panel and the viewing audience. This structure served to create a unique dynamic, in which the audience experience of the exhibition and conversation all happened at the same time.Carey, Brainard, (March 14, 2019), Adam Simon, Praxis Yale Radio WYBC, Min 4 - 5. Four Walls purposefully avoided exhibitions focused on a single artist's work. Usually, it was the artists themselves that proposed either two person or thematic group exhibitions. The first exhibition was a two-person exhibition of Christopher Wool and Joyce Pensato. In its pursuit of a more critical and inclusive discourse the discussions could vary greatly. Many of the discussions exemplified the themes of the mid-1980's, such as Post-Structuralism, gender politics and censorship, as well more practical concerns of art making.Pentecost,, Claire (1994). \\"Four Walls: Ten Years\\". Documents. 2: p. 4-6, via Getty Research Institute, BHA. However, the format was flexible enough to accommodate a less academic approach that did not require addressing the exhibition directly but instead allowed for discussion of subjects related to the artworks on display.Carey, Brainard. (March 14, 2019), Adam Simon, Praxis Yale Radio WYBC, Min. 8 - 9. In 1988, Four Walls hosted three events at the nonprofit space White Columns. These exhibitions would mark the end of the first phase of Four Walls although Simon always contended that anyone could start doing the events.Four Walls at White Columns, White Columns Archive, November, 1988. From 1989-1990 Four Walls was dormant and there were no events.Pentecost,, Claire (1994). \\"Four Walls: Ten Years\\". Documents. 2: p. 6-7, via Getty Research Institute, BHA. == Brooklyn 1991-2000 == After a two-year hiatus, Four Walls began a second phase in Brooklyn New York. This second phase was founded by artists Michael Ballou and Adam Simon after the two were introduced by fellow artist Amy Sillman. Claire Pentecost would join Ballou, Simon and Sillman to form a core group of artist organizers. Throughout the 1990s Ballou and Simon would remain the organizers of the project, Sillman and Penecost's contribution being significant in the initial years of the project.Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985 : A Cultural Politics Book for the Social Text Collective. Ault, Julie., Social Text Collective., Drawing Center (New York, N.Y.). New York: Drawing Center. 2002. p. 72. . OCLC 50253087. In 1990, artist Amy Sillman introduced Mike Ballou to Adam Simon. At that time, Ballou was interested in hosting events at his space in Brooklyn. Agreeing to reinitiate the project, Four Walls would be located at 138 Bayard Street in Brooklyn, New York in a garage building with the events being hosted on the ground floor level. Given the informal structure, numerous artists participating and various roles, it is difficult to describe the organizational structure. Like Simon and Araujo who lived in the Hoboken location, Ballou lived at the Bayard Street location and was a constant presence. Ballou often organized, hosted and documented the events. In 1997, art critic Roberta Smith referred to Ballou as ‘a guiding spirit at Four Walls’. The first event in the Bayard street location entitled The Transmission of Violence was organized by Helen Molesworth in 1991. This was followed by events such as A Puppet Show For Adults a performance by artists Michael Smith and Doug Skinner and next was an open show entitled The Neurotic Art Show that included a panel of psychoanalysts.Pentecost, Claire (1994). \\"Four Walls: Ten Years\\". Documents. 2: p. 7, via Getty Research Institute, BHA. == Types of Events == In the Brooklyn phase of Four Walls the range of events greatly expanded. In the Hoboken era, events were limited to two person exhibitions or group shows that included public conversations or panel discussions. Some of the group exhibitions were organized as ‘open shows’. In the second Brooklyn phase these expanded to include Blender Nights, The Slide and Film Club and public conversations. As a rule, Four Walls did not do one person exhibitions. Additionally, Four Walls also participated in satellite exhibitions that were hosted by other institutions and galleries outside the Four Walls location. === Two Person Exhibitions === These exhibitions focused on the works of two artists and lasted a single evening. The event included a discussion between the two artists. === Group Exhibitions === Including the works of numerous artists, these exhibitions were one night events that included a public discussion. These exhibitions were generally organized by artists and not professional curators. These exhibitions had themes that were often reflexive of the process of art making. For example, the exhibition entitled ‘The Naked Paint Show’ in 1985 with James Bohary, Geoffrey Dorfman, Tracy Jones, Andy Miller and Pat Passlof.Pentecost, Claire (1994). \\"Four Walls: Ten Years\\". Documents. 2: p. 5, - via Getty Research Institute, BHA. ===Open Shows=== Unlike the group exhibitions where an organizer selected the artists who would participate in the exhibition, the Open Show format allowed any artists who responded by phone to the exhibition announcement at a given time to be included in the exhibition. As long as the proposed artwork's scale could be accommodated by the gallery space and that the number of predetermined artists was not exceeded, any applicant could participate in the exhibition. The first open show, conceived by Steven Kasher, entitled Before & After was in 1984. This evening featured up to fifty artists who presented two works each, ironically addressing their state before and after becoming ‘sophisticated modern artists’. ===Blender Nights=== Blender Nights were the conception of founding member Michael Ballou, where a writer and a visual artist were paired together to produce a night of performance. The duos did not present their individual projects but worked collaboratively to produce a single work. The inaugural Blender Night was a collaboration between Ballou and Kurt Hoffman which consisted of an evening of erotic fiction and chamber music entitled ‘The Honorable Discharge’. ===The Slide and Film Club=== The Slide and Film Club consisted of evenings where audience members presented their own film or slide projections. In this context, most of the audience were also the producers of the works. Although many of the presenters were practicing artists, the presentations tended to not be their official artwork but instead ‘homespun’ time based works intended for the context of The Slide and Film Club. Michael Ballou would continue The Four Walls Slide and Film Club after the closing of the Bayard Street location in 2000. === Public Conversations === The public conversations series grew out of the Hoboken phases of the 1980s and were organized by founder Adam Simon. In the 1990s these usually were pairings of artists, one interviewing the other. Unlike in the Hoboken period, these public conversations did not accompany an exhibition or an art opening and took place both in the Bayard Street location and elsewhere. One example was a conversation between William Pope.L and Brian Conley at Postmasters Gallery. The conversation was delayed because of the apparent lateness of Pope.L, however it turns out he was hidden under a pile of Wonder Bread and emerged from the pile to participate in the conversation wearing only a jockstrap. === Satellite Projects === Periodically Four Walls was invited to participate in exhibitions hosted by other institutions. In 1988, Four Walls mounted three events at the non-profit gallery White Columns in New York City. Real Democracy was an Open Show that allowed the first 100 people to call in to participate in the exhibition which was held on November 8. Attendees to this event also viewed the US election results that were broadcast that evening. On November 10, Four Walls hosted a two-person exhibition of artists Tom McGlynn and Tim Daley. Finally, Four Walls hosted a group exhibition entitled Wedding Pictures on November 12 in which artworks by various artists were paired with enlarged wedding announcements from the New York Times. In 1992–1993, Four Walls participated in the exhibition at MoMA P.S.1 entitled Seven Rooms/Seven Shows. For this project, the collective produced The Replica of Four Walls, a miniaturized scale model of the Four Walls Brooklyn building that included their own series of exhibitions inside the model. These so-called ‘Mini-Shows’ were organized by various artists such as Marilyn Minter, Craig Kalpakjian, Amy Sillman and Jason Simon. Many other artists participated in the production of the model, such as Joe Amrheim, Loretta Lopez, Paul Ramirez Jonas, Barbara During, David Scher and many others. The model would eventually have different Mini-Shows produced for it throughout its life. The Robert J. Shiffler Foundation acquired the Four Walls model and included it in other exhibitions.Pentecost, Claire (1994). Four Walls: Ten Years. Documents. 2: p. 9, via Getty Research Institute, BHA. Four Walls was included in the 1995 exhibition entitled Other Rooms at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts. Four Walls presented The Jobs Show in which artists posted artifacts from their day jobs next to a single film slide of their artwork hung from a push pin. In 1997, Four Walls produced a work entitled, Liberty Exchange Project for a group exhibition of outdoor works curated by the artist collective p.t.t.red. The exhibition, entitled, Niemandsland took place in the region around the Brenner Pass, Italy. The exhibition explored the conditions and unique attributes of the border region. Four Walls presented more than forty artworks representing the Statue of Liberty by artists from Brooklyn which were offered for exchange to the people of Brenner. In 1999, the Four Walls was included in the exhibition entitled Get Together at the Vienna Kunsthalle. == Context == Four Walls in Brooklyn was rooted in the burgeoning art scene of the Greenpoint and Williamsburg neighborhoods of the 1990s. The neighborhood's artist population grew significantly in this decade. Like in the Hoboken era, the collective was founded in a decade when most artists living in these neighborhoods were discounted from the commercially focused Manhattan art world. In this growing artist community, Four Walls events gave many artists opportunities early in their career. It was also a place where well known and commercially successful artists would overlap with lesser known artists on a more equal footing in a setting that lacked pretensions commonly associated with the visual arts culture.Volk, Gregory, Big Brash Borough, Art in America, September, 2004, p. 93. However, by the turn of the century, the gentrification process in Greenpoint and Williamsburg would be in full swing. In the New York art scene of the 1980s and 90's, the mission of numerous non- profit art galleries was to exhibit under recognized artists and to take an oppositional stance to mainstream art galleries and museums. This ‘alternative space’ category was widely embraced in this period and Four Walls was often contextualized in this category. However the term was never fully embraced by the Four Walls core organizers because they saw the alternative space category as reinforcing the roles of artist, curator, collector and funder and how these institutions addressed only an imagined public.Pentecost, Claire (1994). Four Walls: Ten Years. Documents. 2: p. 5, via Getty Research Institute, BHA. Four Walls would prefer to challenge these roles adopting a different approach often describing Four Walls as a “laboratory” or “club house” which more accurately described how the collective addressed the immediate artist community and encouraged experimentation.Corwin, Will, (2010) Michael Ballou, Clock Tower Radio By the 2000s the term alternative space would begin to wane in the institutional world. == References == == External links == *Audio Interview with Michael Ballou, Art on Air, 2010.

Yukio Okamoto (, Okamoto Yukio; November 23, 1945 – April 24, 2020) was a Japanese diplomat, diplomatic analyst, and proponent of strong economic and political Japan–United States relations. Okamoto guided Japanese and American diplomatic relations throughout the 1980s, during an era when both countries simultaneously competed for economic influence on the global stage. He served as a diplomatic advisor and analyst for several Japanese prime ministers, including Ryutaro Hashimoto from 1996 to 1998 and Junichiro Koizumi from 2003 until 2004. ==Biography== Okamoto was a native of Kanagawa Prefecture. He joined the Japanese Foreign Ministry in 1968, where he worked for more than 20 years. He was posted to diplomatic missions in Paris, Cairo and Washington D.C. Okamoto rose to become the director of the foreign ministry's First North America Division, which guided U.S.-Japanese relations. Okamoto left his job in Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the private sector in 1991, a rare move for a senior Japanese diplomat. He established his own political and economic consulting agency, Okamoto Associates Inc. However, he remained a leading figure within Japanese-American diplomatic and political circles. He closely advised Japanese prime ministers on some of their most sensitive bilateral issues, ranging from the controversial U.S. military bases on Okinawa to the commemorations marking the 70th anniversary of World War II in 2015. Okamoto served as an adviser to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto from 1996 to 1998. Hashimoto appointed Okamoto as the head of issues related to the island of Okinawa. Okamoto mediated negotiations between the Japanese government and the Okinawa Prefecture's government over issues affecting the island, including the economy and the proposed relocation of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. Okamoto was also an advisor to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi from 2003 until 2004. Under Koizumi, Okamoto oversaw preparations for Japan's reconstruction efforts following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Okamoto was appointed to an advisory panel which helped draft Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's speech marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in 2015. Abe ultimately did not include a new apology, but did uphold past condolences issued by previous Japanese governments. He taught at Ritsumeikan University and other Japanese universities. He was also appointed as a senior research fellow at the MIT Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Okamoto, who was fluent in English, continued to lobby for close American and Japanese bilateral relations, as well as Japan's foreign policy positions on the world stage. He appeared in interviews and gave public lectures in both countries. He also authored articles, books, and op-eds, including in the New York Times. Okamoto died from pneumonia caused by COVID-19 at a Tokyo hospital on April 24, 2020, at the age of 75. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Japanese diplomats Category:Japanese businesspeople Category:Japan–United States relations Category:Aoyama Gakuin University faculty Category:Ritsumeikan University faculty Category:Hitotsubashi University alumni Category:People from Kanagawa Prefecture Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo ","title":"Yukio Okamoto"},{"id":"63930154","text":"Rachel Crane Rich Mather (February 5, 1823 – February 11, 1903) established the Mather School for daughters of freed slaves in 1867 in South Carolina. The school eventually became the Technical College of the Lowcountry. ==Biography== Rachel Crane Mather was the sixth of nine children born to Christian missionaries living in New Hampshire in 1823. Her father, Ezekiel Rich, was a Congregational minister. Rachel worked as a teacher in Boston, and in 1846 married a Baptist minister named Joseph Higgins Mather, Jr. in Rhode Island. They had two sons, but a just few years after marrying, her husband and their youngest son Samuel both died. Mather believed that God wanted her to help freed slaves, and was assigned by the American Missionary Association to teach at a normal school for freed slaves in Beaufort, South Carolina. She was especially heartbroken over the many orphans she saw, whose parents had often been sold or shipped elsewhere, and who were living in the streets with no access to food or education. After a year of teaching for the AMA, she founded the Mather School of Beaufort, which opened in 1868, during America's Reconstruction Period, with Mather serving as principal. The school provided housing, food, and clothing in addition to education such as reading, grammar, math, housekeeping skills, and \\"moral development\\" with a curriculum centered around the Bible.Beasley, S.F. (2014). Pioneering Women of Southern Education: A Comparative Study of Northern and Southern School Founders. (Doctoral dissertation) The Mather School was supported financially by the Woman's American Baptist Home Mission Society. It began with a focus on elementary- aged girls, but expanded to middle school, high school, and college as time went on. The school was one of the pioneering schools for teaching former slaves and their children, and provided a \\"rigorous and character-building experience\\", according to Dr. Lucy Reuben who attended the school. The school continued until 1968, at which point it was sold to the state of South Carolina. The school eventually became the Technical College of the Lowcountry. In 2017, the Mather Interpretive Center, housed in the school's former library, opened in Beaufort to preserve the history of the school and its founder. Greg Rawls, a Beaufort Arts Council member, said regarding the opening: \\"This is an amazing story that people just don't seem to know about... What we want is for this Beaufort story to be more than just a sign by the road.\\" Thomas Leitzel, president of the Technical College of the Lowcountry, called Mather a \\"hero with a vision and commitment to making life better through education.\\" == References == == External links == * Technical College of the Lowcountry official website Category:1823 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Educators from New Hampshire Category:Founders of schools in the United States ","title":"Rachel Crane Mather"},{"id":"63930210","text":"Thomas Hearns vs. Iran Barkley II, billed as \\"Bombs Away\\" was a professional boxing match contested on March 20, 1992 for the WBA light heavyweight title. ==Background== In June 1991, Thomas Hearns had upset the previously undefeated Virgil Hill to capture the WBA light heavyweight title, giving the 32-year old Hearns, his sixth and final world title.The Last of the Legends, Sports Illustrated article, 1991-06-17, Retrieved on 2020-05-10 For his next fight, Hearns had initially planned to move up to the cruiserweight division to challenge then-WBA cruiserweight champion Bobby Czyz in an effort to become the first fighter to win world titles in six different weight divisions. However, when Hearns reportedly demanded no less than a $10 million purse to fight Czyz, the fight fell through. James Warring, the then-IBF cruiserweight champion was also suggested as an opponent, but Hearns rejected that fight as well, claiming that he didn't want to move up to cruiserweight. Instead, Hearns agreed to defend his light heavyweight title against Iran Barkley in what was a rematch of their 1988 fight in which Barkley defeated Hearns by knockout in the third round.After 7 months on the shelf, Hearns yearns to battle Barkley, Sports Illustrated article, 1992-01-19, Retrieved on 2020-05-10 Barkley, who had struggled after his victory over Hearns, was just coming off a big victory over Darrin Van Horn that saw him knock out Van Horn in the second round to capture the IBF super middleweight title.Barkley, Not Acting His Age, Knocks Out Van Horn, NY Times article, 1992-01-11, Retrieved on 2020-05-10 ==The fight== The fight was closely contested with Barkley picking up his second victory over Hearns via a close split decision. Barkley would score the fight's only knockdown, sending Hearns down after countering a Hearns right with a left hook. Though Hearns would quickly get back up, the point Hearns lost from the knockdown would loom large as the end result would have resulted in a draw and Hearns would've retained his title. Barkley was the aggressor for much of the fight, throwing 904 punches of which he landed 224, only slightly more than Hearns who landed 217 of his 578 punches for a 38% success rate, much higher than Barkley who only landed 25% of his thrown punches. By the end of the fight, both of Barkley's eyes were nearly swollen shut while Hearns was almost unrecognizable as both his nose and left cheek had swollen considerably. Hearns was named the winner on one scorecard 114–113, while Barkley took the other scorecards with scores of 115–113 and 114–113.

Wells is said to have admired the architects of the Italian Renaissance, especially Donato Bramante, and to have been an important influence in the firm's transition in the mid-1880s away from the romantic and picturesque, and toward the classical. == Early life and family == Joseph Morrill Wells was born at Roxbury, Massachusetts on March 1, 1853,New York City Municipal Death Records. the son of Thomas Foster Wells (1822–1903) and his wife, Sarah Morrill Wells (1828–1897). Samuel Adams, the Boston brewer and patriot, was a great-great-grandfather. Joseph Wells's brother, Webster Wells, (1851–1916) was a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the author of numerous textbooks such as the Elementary Treatise on Logarithms (1878). His sister Anna Foster Wells (b. 1857) was a music teacher. By 1849, the year Thomas Wells married Sarah Morrill, he was in partnership with John Emery Gowen, trading in West India goods and importing liquors and wine.Boston City Directory 1848–49, p. 266. The business dated back to the days of Thomas Wells's great-grandfather, Captain Francis Wells, a wine merchant, shipper, and captain of the Hempstead Galley, the ship on which he brought his family in 1723 from England to Boston. In the 1850s, Wells and Gowen conducted marine salvage operations while selling deep-sea diving gear, doing business as \\"Wells & Gowen Submarine Armor.\\"Chuck Veit, Raising Missouri (self-published, 2010). In 1860, Thomas and Sarah Wells lived at Roxbury with their four children,1860 US Census, Ward 4, City of Roxbury. but by 1870, the family was living in New York City at 9 Horatio Street (\\"between West and Hudson Streets\\"),1870 Census, District 2, Ward 9, New York City, pp. 4-5. where they remained until about 1873,New York City Directory, 1872-73. and where Thomas Wells pursued his many business interests. By 1874, the family was living in a house at 137 Highland Street near Roxbury, from which Thomas Wells commuted to his office at 3 Merchants Row in Boston, where he worked in real estate.Boston City Directory, (Boston: Sampson, Davenport & Co., 1873), p. 958. In 1875, 1876, and 1877, they lived at 141 Highland. In 1880, Thomas and Sarah Wells were living with their daughter Annie at Winchester, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb, where the father worked as a \\"trader in stocks,\\" and where for a time he was president of the Granular Metal Co.1880 US Census, Winchester, Massachusetts.Chuck Veit, Raising Missouri (self- published, 2010). == Education and architectural career == Joseph Wells attended the West Newton English and Classical School (aka the Allen School) in West Newton, Massachusetts, where he studied subjects such as art, music, dancing, and ethics, and where he was required to keep a daily journal (which he continued to keep for the rest of his life). He worked in Boston for the architects Peabody & Stearns from 1874 to 1875, and for the architect Clarence S. Luce from 1875 to 1878.In the 1873 Boston Directory, Wells is absent, presumably living in New York; Luce is a draftsman working at 17 Pembroke, presumably for the architect Gridley Bryant who had offices there. In the 1874 Directory, the firm of Peabody & Stearns has offices at 60 Devonshire, which Wells gave as his work address. In the 1875, 1876, and 1877 directories, Luce has an office at 17 Pemberton Square, and Wells is listed as working at that address; in 1878 Luce has an office at 11 Pemberton Square, and Wells is working at the same address (which in the 1875 and 1876 Directories is Luce's home address). In January 1877, the New York architect Richard Morris Hunt published a drawing signed by Wells,Leland M. Roth, McKim, Mead & White, Architects (New York: Harper & Row, 1983), see notes for pp. 86–87. Roth wrote that Wells worked for Luce first, then P&S.; but this may have been a freelance commission. In 1879, Wells joined McKim, Mead & White and remained there until his death in 1890. Notwithstanding his many contributions to the firm's work, he was obscure in life and for a time thereafter (in 1908, the artist Will Low wrote that Wells's \\"practice was absorbed in that of the firm of architects where he was employed,\\" and in 1913, the critic Royal Cortissoz called him \\"a man of genius unknown to the outer world and, indeed, no more familiar to many of the younger generation in his profession...\\"). His current reputation as having been an important member of the firm derives in part from the recollections of the architect Harold Van Buren Magonigle, who for a time worked alongside Wells, and recalled him in an article written in 1934.H. Van Buren Magonigle, \\"A Half Century of Architecture, 4,\\" Pencil Points, Vol. 15 (1934), p. 223. According to Magonigle, the architect Charles McKim once told him that he had \\"learned more from [Wells] than from any other source.\\"In The American Yearbook of 1911, Magonigle recalled that McKim had told him that \\"he had learned more from Joseph Wells than from any other living man.\\" Magonigle claimed that it was Wells who \\"weaned\\" the architect Stanford White away from the \\"romantic and picturesque forms\\" he admired before he entered his classical phase in the mid-1880s. He credited Wells with the design (based on White's preliminary sketches) of the firm's Villard Houses (1884), and the detailing of the facade of the Century Association's New York clubhouse (1891). Earlier, in 1924, Magonigle made even greater claims for Wells, writing that \\"there was a moment of great promise in the history of American design when it looked as though the influence of the genius of Joseph Morrill Wells would direct American thought toward a virile and fruitful eclecticism that would lead in its turn toward an architecture we could fairly call our own...but Wells died in the very early nineties...the [1893 Chicago] World's Fair came on and turned our minds toward Greece and Rome, and another Classic revival ensued...and so began the baneful use of precedent...\\"H. Van Buren Magonigle, \\"Architectural Plagiarism as A Fine Art,\\" Michigan Architect and Engineer, Vol. 6 (September 1924), p. 112. The historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock, writing in 1972, saw Wells's design for the Villard Houses not only as a harbinger of the shift to the classical and symmetrical, but also as part of a broader transition from European to American leadership in architectural design, writing that \\"a change in American architecture came...in the early eighties with the designing and building of the Villard houses in New York.\\" According to Hitchcock, \\"the rejection of the English High Victorian and even of Shavian-manorial irregularity and picturesquenessHitchcock is referring to the British architect Richard Norman Shaw. is here at its extreme even at the very beginning. It was, moreover, almost immediately reflected in the planning of the firm's H.A.C. Taylor house in Newport, a year or two later, in which there was a return to the formal Anglo-Palladian mode of the eighteenth century.\\" Noting that the classical trend came several years later to England, Hitchcock opined that \\"this was the point where the tide turns, when American leadership, although not yet much followed, was beginning to be recognized abroad.\\"Henry-Russell Hitchcock, \\"Foreign Influence in American Painting and Architecture after 1860,\\" in The Shaping of Art and Architecture in Nineteenth-century America, ed. Robert Judson Clark (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1972). Others took a more measured view of Wells's influence. Charles Baldwin, Stanford White's biographer, acknowledged Wells's having introduced the Renaissance to the firm with his facades for the Villard Houses, but attributed White's shift to the classical more to his 1884 European honeymoon, writing, \\"...White's wedding trip through Europe opened his eyes. Returning, supported by Wells, he began to practice — and preach — Italian Renaissance as a style and a tradition better suited to American needs than any or all phases of Gothic, Romanesque, or...strictly classical architecture.\\"Charles C. Baldwin. Stanford White (New York: Dodd, Mead & Co., 1931), p. 215. William Mitchell Kendall, who became a partner in the firm in 1906, recalled Wells's role as having been subsidiary to those of the partners: \\"So far as I know his work was confined to the details of building. In that he was supreme. Nobody before or since has equalled him in the appropriateness and scale of his ornamentation: and this of course gave great character to the buildings he decorated. But the ensemble, and by implication, the kind of decoration, was invariably decided by a member of the firm.\\"Charles C. Baldwin. Stanford White (New York: Dodd, Mead & Co., 1931), pp. 360–361. Nonetheless, there were instances where Wells had greater responsibility for the composition. William R. Mead, a partner more inclined to manage than design, collaborated with Wells on major projects in Kansas City and Omaha for the New York Life Insurance Company, projects that failed to interest McKim or White, and therefore gave Wells a significant say in the overall design.Mosette Broderick, Triumvarite: McKim, Mead & White (New York: Knopf Doubleday, 2010), p. 291. Years later, Mead wrote of Wells's status as first among equals among the firm's employees during its early days: \\"In 1879, shortly before the establishment of the firm, Joseph M. Wells came into our office...I suppose he had merely a good high school education, but he was one of the most learned young men in literature and art whom I have ever met, and a most original thinker...in his quiet, almost unsocial, way he immediately made an impression upon all of us, and became our intimate friend and associate, not only in our work but in our daily lives...I recall the times when we four were working together in the bonds of true fellowship.\\"Charles C. Baldwin. Stanford White (New York: Dodd, Mead & Co., 1931), p. 114. Wells's last assignment at McKim, Mead & White was to design the details for Madison Square Garden (completed in 1890), but illness kept him from the task. He died of pneumonia on February 2, 1890.New York City Municipal Death Records. == Memorial == Joseph Wells was buried in the Oak Grove Cemetery in Medford, Massachusetts, where Stanford White and the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens erected a tombstone in the form of a tall Greek stele. The tombstone was removed in 2019, restored and reinstalled in May 2020. == Further reading == * \\"Joseph Morrill Wells\\" (Obituary), Architecture and Building, Vol XII, No. 7 (February 1890). * Frank E.

It is exposed in a small belt along the east flank of Espinaso Ridge in the Hagen basin of central New Mexico, where it is truncated to the northwest by the San Francisco Fault and disappears to the southeast in the subsurface. The formation is thick at the type section on Arroyo de la Vega de los Tanos east of Espinaso Ridge. The age is constrained by an interbedded basalt flow at the bottom of the formation that has a radiometric age of 25.41 ± 0.32 Ma. The upper age range is poorly controlled but may extend into the Miocene. The formation lies discontinuously on the Espinaso Formation and interfingers with the overlying Blackshare Formation, with the boundary placed at the highest thickly bedded tabular sandstone below the lenticular conglomerate of the Blackshare Formation. The Tanos Formation dips 20 to 32 degrees to the northeast. It is interpreted as sediments deposited in a closed basin during early rifting along the Rio Grande rift, and is the oldest exposed Santa Fe Group formation near the Albuquerque Basin. ==History== The beds were first studied in detail by Searns in 1953, who tentatively assigned them to the Abiquiu Formation.Stearns 1953 However, no clasts of Amalia Tuff, pervasive in the Abiquiu Formation further north, are present.

They began preserving and distributing out-of-print documentary films digitally before expanding to narrative and first-run theatrical films. A unique element of their library is that much of it focuses on films by women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ filmmakers and subjects. The company also houses a small record label that releases movie soundtracks and film scores. ==Background== Hope Runs High acquired the distribution rights for a library of acclaimed documentary films. This collection included films from Academy Award-winning actress/director Lee Grant, including her 1986 Best Documentary Feature winner Down and Out in America, as well as filmmaker Richard Morris' Oscar-shortlisted musical documentary Wallowitch & Ross: This Moment. Many of these films feature LGBTQ+ characters and were not seen in mainstream cinema at the time of their original release, rescuing and showcasing a unique corner of queer cinema. In 2019, Hope Runs High began to refocus on theatrical distribution, beginning with a limited theatrical re-release of documentaries by Grant. Grant's films launched as part of a retrospective at New York's Film Forum and marked the first retrospective of her work to look at her time as both actor and director, and the first time many of the films had been exhibited in decades. Having begun with film preservation, some of the company's work deals with film history. Many of their digital releases include supplementary content designed to provide further cultural and historical context for the viewer. ==COVID-19/Virtual Cinema== An expansion of Grant's documentaries to art house and repertory cinemas was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the re-release of Grant's films was redesigned as one of the earliest examples of a virtual cinema release. The collection of Grant's documentaries was curated for virtual cinemas by Taylor A. Purdee and has become the first virtual retrospective in the United States, as well as the largest series on Grant's directorial work. Subsequently, it was announced that the American Film Institute would honor Grant's lifetime achievements specifically as a documentarian during its 2020 AFI Docs film festival with a digital showing of Grant's Down and Out in America accompanying the celebration. This is the first time the festival has been held virtually, due to the pandemic. Also during the COVID-19 crisis, Hope Runs High brought Jonathan Caouette's 2003 documentary Tarnation to digital streaming for the first time in collaboration with The Criterion Collection. The film premiered June 1, 2020 in celebration of (a much changed) Pride Month. ==References* * Category:Film distributors of the United States Category:American record labels ","title":"Hope Runs High"},{"id":"63930526","text":"Ali Ardalan () was an Iranian politician affiliated with the National Front.

In his early years his father sent him to Salonica to pursue his Talmudic studies where he became the pupil of Joseph Nasi. He later moved to Naples, Italy, were he was employed as the chief financier of viceroy Don Pedro de Toledo. It was during this time that Samuel amassed a great fortune, becoming richer than anyone in his immediate family. Samuel later married his first cousin Benvenida Abrabanel, however the two had to move to Ferrara in 1541, when the Neapolitan government banned Jews from the city. It was in Ferrara that the couple began to support several Jewish institutions. Their house became a favorite resort for Jewish and Christian scholars alike, such as David ben Yahya and Baruch of Benevento. The poet Samuel Usque famously said that Samuel [Abravanel] deserved the surname \\"Tremegisto,\\" meaning, \\"thrice great\\": because Samuel was great in scholarship, great in name (ancestry), and great in wealth. Stating that \\"he generously employs his wealth in promoting the welfare of his coreligionists.

McHugh Peak is situated in Chugach State Park, southeast of downtown Anchorage, and southwest of O'Malley Peak. Reaching the top involves hiking on a ridge trail and scrambling the final summit tor. The hike to McHugh Peak is detailed in several popular guidebooks. This geographic feature's local name was reported in 1942 by the Army Map Service, and was officially adopted in 1969 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.Donald J. Orth, Dictionary of Alaska Place Names, 1967, page 610.. The mountain's name is derived from McHugh Creek which drains the south slope of this peak, and the creek's name was first published in 1912 by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. This mountain is called Q'isqa Dghelaya in the Denaʼina language, meaning Banjo Snowshoe Mountain. \\"Q'isqa\\" are temporary snowshoes made of lashed brush.Kari, James and James Fall.

It contains seven genera and about 70 species. ==Taxonomy== Malmideaceae was created in 2011 to accommodate a group of species, formerly placed in genus Malcolmiella (family Pilocarpaceae), that molecular phylogenetics showed to be a distinct lineage and worthy of recognition at the family level. The genus Savoronala, containing the single African species S. madagascariensis, was added to the family in 2013, while another monotypic genus Kalbionora was added in 2017. ==Description== Malmideaceae is similar to Pilocarpaceae, but can be distinguished from that family by thallus organization and ascus structure. Malmidea species have a thallus made of goniocysts–spherical aggregations of photobiont cells surrounded by short- celled hyphae. This characteristic is quite rare in the Pilocarpaceae, only found in the monotypic genera Calopadiopsis and Pseudocalopadia. Despite the general overall similarity of the ascus structure between the two families, unlike the Pilocarpaceae, Malmideaceae species lack a tubular structure in their asci. Most Malmidea species are restricted to subtropical areas. The genus Zhurbenkoa, consisting of three lichenicolous fungi from South America and Europe, represented the addition of a new nutritional mode for the Malmideaceae, which until then had consisted of only lichen-forming associations between fungi and green algae. ==Genera== *Cheiromycina B.Sutton (1986) – 4 spp. *Crustospathula Aptroot (1998) – 4 spp. *Kalbionora Sodamuk, S.D.Leav. & Lumbsch (2017) – 1 sp. *Malmidea Kalb, Rivas Plata & Lumbsch (2011) – 52 spp. *Savoronala Ertz, Eb.

He was attracted to the style of the Impressionists and began to compose in a manner reflective of trends then current in France. He gained an appointment to teach at the Rotterdam School of Music in 1916; two years later, with Sem Dresden, he founded the Society of Modern Composers in the Netherlands. Later in his career he settled in The Hague, and from 1931 taught at the Rotterdam Conservatory.

He studied there for five years, altogether. During that time, he also travelled throughout Europe. In 1878, while making copies in the Louvre, he met Agnes Fitzgibbon, from England. They were married shortly after.Biography @ Find-a-Grave The newlywed couple moved to London, where he had recently held several exhibits. He frequently took paintings back to the United States, where they were exhibited at galleries in Boston. His local venues included the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and the Royal Academy. While in England, he continued to travel; visiting France, the Low Countries, Italy and Morocco, which inspired his first Orientalist works. His marriage to Agnes ended in the late 1880s, and their four children went with her, but he met another Englishwoman, the well-to-do Maude Chadwick, during a trip to North Africa, and they were married in 1892.

He was born in Mumbai, Maharashtra, with arthrogryposis. In 2012, he started a disability rights advocacy organization based in Delhi called Nipman Foundation. Malhotra is the Founder Chair of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry's (FICCI) Diversity & Inclusion Working Group on Empowering Persons with Disability. ==Education== Malhotra studied economics at St. Stephen's College, Delhi University and Delhi School of Economics. He later attended the Indian School of Business. == Advocacy Work == ===Delhi Odd-Even rule exemption=== Malhotra filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court in December 2015 seeking exemption of private vehicles of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) from the Odd-Even rule. Under this rule, vehicles with registration numbers ending in odd numbers are allowed on the roads on only odd days and even-numbered vehicles are allowed on the roads on only even days. The rule was announced to be introduced in Delhi in 2016 to reduce pollution and smog. However, the private vehicles of PwDs are generally retrofitted to meet their needs and due to lack of accessible infrastructure and accessible public transport, PwDs could only have moved out on alternate days. His petition led to an exception being carved out for PwDs and a status check on disability audit of Government buildings and the infrastructure retrofitting done by the Government to check how accessible Delhi was for Persons with Disabilities. ===Low-floor accessible buses=== As a result of Malhotra's writ petition in the Supreme Court of India, the Government of Delhi was directed to only buy low-floor buses in Delhi. The government had taken a decision on 1 September 2017 to induct 2,000 standard-floor buses. The petition challenged Delhi government and the Delhi Transport Corporation's (DTC) decision to buy 2,000 standard- floor buses instead of low-floor buses for the national capital. On 5 August 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of mandating low-floor buses in Delhi. ===Insurance and congenital anomalies=== The writ petition asked the Government of India to direct Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and insurance companies to remove congenital anomalies from the list of general exclusions in the health or life insurance policies. IRDAI had been denying the rights of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) to seek insurance cover for themselves on the ground that their conditions were categorized under the scope of \\"congenital anomalies\\", which was allowed as an exception to granting insurance. ===GST on disability aids and assistive devices=== The Goods and Services Tax (GST) on Braille typewriters and papers, carriages for the disabled, wheelchairs and other assistive devices was fixed at rates of 5–18%. This was claimed by some to be equivalent to a tax on walking or seeing. The GST rate on all mobility and disability aids across India has now been reduced from 18% to 5% after the 16th GST council meeting. However, the petition aims for a zero-rated GST, with a special refund scheme for input tax credit. This means that the entire value chain of the supply should be exempt from tax. Under this regime, not only is the final output exempt from payment of tax, the input for making/providing the output supply is exempted too. ===Indian Sign Language (ISL) recognition=== In order to recognize Indian Sign Language as the 23rd official language of India, Malhotra filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court. ISL gives an identity to the deaf community and is the only language they use to communicate. The issue was submitted for the consideration of the central government and they took notice of the matter. The quest to formalise Indian Sign Language gained momentum after this petition. The government in power committed to spend more resources on the Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre. For the first time ever, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) released a 12-minute video explaining the highlights of the party’s manifesto in sign language for the 2019 Indian general election and the largest opposition party in India, Indian National Congress, promised to recognize Indian Sign Language in their national election manifesto. ===Zomato's disabled-friendly filter=== There were not too many restaurants in Delhi and other Indian cities that advertised themselves as disabled-friendly. Malhotra was denied entry at Keya, located in DLF Promenade Mall in Vasant Kunj in March 2015 because \\"as a 'policy', the restaurant did not allow entry to disabled persons\\". Protests by disability- rights groups forced the Aam Aadmi Party government to order a magisterial inquiry into the incident. Malhotra contacted executives at the Zomato restaurant review and delivery website in August 2015 and suggested introducing a feature that could filter \\"disabled-friendly\\" restaurants. The idea was welcomed by them. The filter was added to the Zomato app in six metropolitan areas Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai. ===X-ray scanning in airport security=== After being harassed and mocked by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officer on duty at the Bangalore Airport on 30 November 2016, Malhotra, along with some other disability activists, lobbied with CISF to ease security procedures for PwDs at airports. There had been multiple similar reported instances from across the country. On 11 October 2017, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) allowed using X-ray scanning for prosthetics and orthotics only as a measure of last resort. It was decided that checking of PwDs with a hand-held explosives trace detector (ETD) device would suffice and X-ray screening would only be used in cases of \\"sufficient doubt.\\" Instructions were also issued to make wheelchair users get up from their wheelchairs only in exceptional cases for security checks. ==Nipman Foundation Microsoft Equal Opportunity Awards== The Equal Opportunity Awards were instituted in 2014 to recognize organizations and individuals making significant contributions to people with disabilities in their workspace and lifestyles. The reason for starting the Awards was to encourage more companies to hire persons with disabilities. In 2016, Microsoft came on board as the title partner for the Awards. In the sixth edition of the Nipman Foundation Microsoft Equal Opportunity Awards in 2019, awards were given in seven categories: Technological Innovations Empowering PwDs, Non- technological Innovations Empowering PwDs, Companies Hiring PwDs, Inclusive and Integrated Schools, Physical Accessibility Promoting Universal Design, Entrepreneur with a Disability, and Professional with a Disability ==Wheels For Life== Malhotra is the founder of Wheels for Life - a crowdsourcing platform connecting those who need wheelchairs to donors who can financially contribute for them. This initiative was started in October 2016. ==Project Delhi== Malhotra co-founded Project Delhi in April 2020 for supporting Persons with Disabilities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The idea of Project Delhi was to help persons with disabilities procure essential items by offering contactless delivery of groceries and medicines. Those with mobility issues and high support needs were finding it difficult to step out for buying essentials, primarily groceries and medicines. Through Project Delhi, the volunteers signed up online and delivered these essentials to any disabled person at the MRP. == References == == External links == *Equal Opportunity Awards *Wheels For Life Category:Indian disability rights activists Category:Indian businesspeople Category:1987 births Category:Living people ","title":"Nipun Malhotra (social entrepreneur)"},{"id":"63931359","text":"Cagla Eroglu is a Turkish neuroscientist and Associate Professor of Cell Biology and Neurobiology at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Eroglu is also the Director of Graduate Studies in Cell and Molecular Biology at Duke University Medical Center. Eroglu is a leader in the field of glial biology and her lab focuses on exploring the role of glial cells, specifically astrocytes, in synaptic development and connectivity. == Early life and education == Eroglu was born in Turkey and pursued her Bachelors in Chemical Engineering from 1992 to 1996 at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. After completing her B.Sc., Eroglu pursued a Masters in Molecular Biology at the Bilkent Üniversitesi in Ankara, Turkey in 1996. After completing her Masters in 1998, Eroglu moved to Germany to pursue her graduate studies in Molecular Biology at Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg in Germany. Eroglu’s Ph.D. was supported by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Ph.D. program as she studied under the mentorship of Irmgard Sinning, whose lab moved from EMBL to Heidelberg University in 2000. Eroglu’s Ph.D. was broadly focused in the study of membrane proteins biology. Using Drosophila as a model organism, Eroglu looked at how metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluRs) affinity is modulated. She found that when mGluRs are associated with cholesterol rich lipid rafts within the membrane, they exist in a high affinity state for glutamate. When mGluRs are not associated with sterol-rich rafts, they exist in a low affinity state for glutamate binding. After completing her Ph.D. in 2002, Eroglu came to the United States to study under the mentorship of Ben Barres at Stanford University. Eroglu began studying glial cells under Barres’ mentorship. Eroglu, along with her colleagues in the Barres Lab, brought to light the critical and understudied role glial cells play in shaping synapses and neural circuits during development. Eroglu and her team found that an astrocyte derived factor, called Thrombospondin, is important in promoting synaptogenesis in the central nervous system. Eroglu then characterized the receptor to which Thrombospondin binds, called α2δ-1, which happened to also be the receptor to which the drug gabapentin binds. When they over-expressed α2δ-1, they found increases in synaptogenesis and when they blocked the receptor with gabapentin, they found markedly decreased excitatory synapse formation. Her findings showed both the role that astrocyte secreted factors play in specifically excitatory synapse formation, as well as the potential therapeutic mechanism why which gabapentin is able to mediate analgesia and prevent seizures. Another discovery that Eroglu made while in the Barres Lab was the identification and function of hevin and SPARC, two astrocyte-secreted proteins, in the regulation of excitatory synapse development. She found that hevin induces the formation of synapses, while SPARC antagonizes the synaptogenic actions of hevin. Her further further highlighted the critical role astrocytes play in the direct regulation of synapse formation in the central nervous system. Eroglu completed her postdoctoral work in 2008. == Career and research == classifying the geometric_characteristics of dendritic spines in the cortex from a 2014 paper she joint authored In 2008, Eroglu joined the faculty at Duke University as an Associate Professor in the Department of Cell Biology and in the Department of Neuroscience. Eroglu is also a Faculty Network Member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, an Associate of the Duke Initiative for Science and Society, an Affiliate of the Regeneration Next Initiative, as well as a member of the ALICE program within the Duke University School of Medicine. Eroglu’s lab studies the mechanisms underlying synaptic connectivity in the central nervous system. The lab focuses significantly on the cellular and molecular role astrocytes play in shaping synapse development, function, and plasticity. Their focus on the communication between astrocytes and neurons in the healthy brain is paving the way towards eventually understanding how this communication becomes pathological in disease states and how it can be therapeutically targeted. === Synapse development in Huntington's Disease === Eroglu and her team sought to understand how synaptic connectivity was altered in models of Huntington’s Disease. They directly probed the role of Huntingtin protein (htt) in synaptic connectivity and they found that when htt was silenced, excitatory synapses in the cortex and striatum formed at a rapid pace and then started to deteriorate shortly after their rapid development. They then knocked-in the disease causing htt mutation and saw similar findings to when they knocked out htt suggesting that proper htt function is necessary for normal cortical and striatal development. === Astrocytes in cortical development === After discovering hevin, the astrocyte secreted factor implicated in synapse development, in her postdoctoral work, Eroglu continued to explore its role in shaping cortical development in the mouse brain. She found that, when hevin is knocked out, there are reductions in the thalamocortical synapses yet increases in excitatory connections within the cortex. They further found that critical pruning of spines with multiple excitatory contacts fails to take place when hevin is knocked out. These in vivo results emphasize the critical regulatory role played by the astrocytic factor, hevin, in normal cortical development. === Thrombospondin === Eroglu and a team of researchers were interested in exploring the therapeutic potential of human Umbilical Tissue Derived cells (hUTCs) in synaptogenesis. They found that hUTCs could support neural growth specifically through the release of thrombospondin. A further in depth analysis into the role of thrombospondin and their receptors α2δ-1, which Eroglu discovered in her postdoc, highlighted the critical role signalling between thrombospondin and their receptors have in synaptogenesis. Eroglu then found that specifically inhibiting postsynaptic α2δ-1 (thrombospondin receptors) on neurons leads to decreased synaptogenesis and spine formation. They further show that the regulation of synaptogenesis is dependent on Rac1, suggesting its role in development and pathology. == Awards and honors == * 2019 Distinguished Nominees for the Hammes Faculty Teaching Award * 2019 Ruth and A.
