It was published on 31 May 2016. Plot Leon and Daniel Sharma, younger twin brothers of Ryan Sharma, ambush paedophile Nigel Kinney and hand over evidence of his activities to the PHN (Paedophile Hunting Network), a vigilante group. They are caught returning to CHERUB campus and are given two months of hard drill, an excruciating physical activity. Meanwhile, James Adams and sister Lauren arrive at campus for the demolition party celebrating the demolition of the main building. They help to clear archives in the basement first. Chairman Ewart Asker introduces the oldest surviving CHERUB agent and two red shirts who press the button to demolish the building. The main building is demolished and the new Campus Village is opened. Soon, the twins are pulled out of hard drill for a mission in Birmingham with James. Their task is to befriend Oliver Lakshmi, a troubled youth with a reputation for elaborate but untrue stories and see if he has information on radical Islamic terror groups or if he is lying. He is also a potential recruit for CHERUB. Oliver, known as Oli, turns out to be a bully and a thief and James decides he won't be recruited. However, Leon and Daniel learn of a local gangster, Trey, who is supervised by an elderly man known as Uncle. Ryan joins the mission and befriends Uncle. During a tour of one of Uncle's scrapyards, Ryan notices some old equipment with the word \\"OME\\" on it. He finds out OME stands for Offshore Marine Exploration, a defunct oil-pump company. They eventually learn of an also defunct company which repaired OME equipment. One of the three employees was murdered in airport hotel rooms near Uncle's scrapyard. They work out the other two were captured by Islamic State so that they could repair oil-pump equipment when it malfunctioned. Islamic State controls several oil wells with OME equipment and they sell the oil for funds. Rescuing the hostages would not only save them but cripple Islamic State's capability to repair their oil wells. After James presents the evidence to the deputy prime minister, defence minister, a SAS colonel, the heads of MI5 and MI6 and some experts on oil industry and Islamic State, he agrees to form a team to rescue the hostages. Lauren, Kyle and Bruce join him at the summer hostel. Ryan and his friends compete in exercises against James and his team to sharpen him, Lauren, Kyle and Bruce up. Kerry and an Israeli intelligence officer, Tovah, who will come on the mission, join them. James discovers Bruce and Ning having a relationship. He decides not to expose them, as doing so would cause Ning to be expelled and Bruce to be banned from campus and ruin Bruce's relationship with Ning. While training in miniature plane-gliders called microlights, Kerry is seriously injured in a bad crash landing. Ryan jumps at the opportunity to come on the mission. However, because it is not an official CHERUB mission, Ryan couldn‚Äôt join it because he is a CHERUB agent, but he joins it by quitting CHERUB as he is 17 and close to leaving anyway. The team enter Syria through Turkey and make camp in an abandoned shopping precinct. They reach the well and rescue the hostages, then fend off an ambush. A 12-year-old girl named Zahra is among the ambushers but does not take part in the fighting. After her older brother, who is an Islamic State fighter, is killed, the group take her with back home. She is recruited into CHERUB and awaits basic training. Uncle and several of his associates are arrested, Tovah goes back to Israel, Ryan goes to Russia to meet a girl named Natalka he met on a previous mission, Lauren goes back to Texas to her racing driver career with her husband Rat, Bruce returns to Thailand as an instructor of martial arts, but is banned from CHERUB campus for three years and can't apply for a job there.

Origins In the aftermath of the June‚ÄìSeptember 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, President Amin Gemayel, convinced that a strong and unified national defense force was a prerequisite to rebuilding the nation, announced plans to raise a 60,000-man army organized into twelve brigades (created from existing infantry regiments), trained and equipped by France and the United States.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 123. In late 1982, the 5th Infantry Regiment was therefore re- organized and expanded to a brigade group numbering 2,000 men, mostly Maronite Christians from Mount Lebanon, which became on January 1, 1983, the 5th Infantry Brigade. The new Infantry Brigade traced back its roots to a previous unit, the 5th Lebanese special mountain brigade of the colonial Special Troops of the Levant (French: Troupes Sp√©ciales du Levant or TSL), raised earlier on June 1, 1943, during the French mandate over Lebanon and Syria.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 41. In July 1945 a French-Lebanese military agreement was signed, officially signalling the disbandment of the TSL, broken up to form the new Lebanese and Syrian national armies. By the end of the month, a hodgepodge of colonial units comprising the 5th Lebanese special mountain brigade plus other smaller formations transferred from the disbanded 3rd, 6th and 7th TSL coastal brigades, was mustered together at the town of Zahl√© in the Beqaa Valley and consolidated into the new Lebanese Army which was officially founded on August 1, 1945, under the command of then Colonel Fuad Chehab.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), pp. 41-45. Emblem The Brigade's emblem is composed of a Phoenix, a legendary bird that lives through five centuries, set on a sky-blue background, holding the Arabic numeral (5) five and emerging from the flames symbolizing sacrifice and resurrection, surmounted by the motto \\"From my ashes Lebanon arises\\" written in Arabic script. Structure and organization The new unit grew from an understrength battalion comprising three rifle companies to a fully equipped mechanized infantry brigade, capable of aligning a Headquarters' (HQ) battalion, an armoured battalion (54th) equipped with Panhard AML-90 armoured cars,Zaloga, Tank battles of the Mid-East Wars (2) (1998), p. 60. AMX-13 light tanks (replaced in the 1990s by T-55A tanks donated by Syria) and M48A5 main battle tanks (MBTs),Kassis, 30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon (2003), p. 18. three mechanized infantry battalions (51st, 52nd and 53rd) issued with Panhard M3 VTT, AMX-VCI and M113 armored personnel carriers (APC),Zaloga, Tank battles of the Mid-East Wars (2) (1998), pp. 52-53.El-Assad, Landing Zone Lebanon ‚Äì UNIFIL 2006 (2007), p. 80. plus an artillery battalion (55th) fielding US M114 155 mm howitzers. The Brigade also fielded a logistics battalion, equipped with US M151A2 jeeps, Land-Rover long wheelbase series III, Chevrolet C20 and Dodge Ram (1st generation) pickups, and US M35A2 2¬Ω-ton (6x6) military trucks. Initially commanded in 1983 by Colonel Gabriel Arsuni, later replaced by Colonel khalil Kanaan, by 1987 the Brigade was stationed at Brummana in the Matn District east of Beirut, with its administrative headquarters being located at the Raymond el-Hayek Barracks in Sarba, north of Jounieh, which was a Lebanese Forces (LF) stronghold.Collelo, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 223. Combat history The Lebanese Civil War Under the orders of Col. Kanaan, the Fifth Brigade was positioned at the Sin el Fil suburb east of Beirut in the Matn District as a reserve force, and the Brigade's primary mission during the Mountain War was to provide support to the other Lebanese Army Brigades deployed in the Greater Beirut area.Hokayem, L'arm√©e libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du pr√©sident de la R√©publique (1975-1985) (2012), p. 86. On February 6, 1984, the LAF Command of the Greater Beirut area decided to send the 52nd Infantry Battalion in M113 APCs supported by a Tank squadron provided with M48A5 MBTs on a routine patrol mission, whose planned route was to pass through the Dora suburb, the Museum crossing in the Corniche el Mazraa, the Barbir Hospital in the Ouza'i district, the Kola bridge, and the Raouch√© seafront residential and commercial neighbourhood. Alerted by the presence of such a large military force entering west Beirut ‚Äì which they viewed suspiciously as being abnormally reinforced for a simple routine mission ‚Äì Amal militia forces misinterpreted this move as a disguised attempt by Government forces to seize the Shia-controlled southwestern suburbs of the Lebanese capital by force. An alarmed Amal Command promptly issued a general mobilization order in the ranks of its militia, and as soon as the Lebanese Army patrol arrived at the Fouad Chehab bridge near the Barbir Hospital, they fell into an ambush. Several M48 Tanks that were leading the column were hit by dozens of RPG-7 anti-tank rounds, which brought the advance of the entire patrol to a halt. During the February 1986 clashes in West Beirut between the Shia Amal militia and the Lebanese Army, the Fifth Brigade was expelled to East Beirut after the predominately Shia Sixth Brigade refused to participate in the fighting against their coreligionists of Amal. In 1987 Fifth brigade units were deployed to the strategic town of Souk El Gharb to prevent Druze artillerymen of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) militia from shelling the capital. By the late 1980s, the Fifth Brigade was regarded as loyal to the President of Lebanon, but observers believed that if called upon to fight a Christian militia, it might remain neutral. During the final days of the civil war, the Fifth Brigade held Souk El Gharb until October 13, 1990, when the unit was overpowered by an alliance of Druze PSP/PLA, Christian Lebanese Forces ‚Äì Executive Command (LFEC) and Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) militias and Syrian Army troops. The post- civil war years 1990-present Upon the end of the war in October 1990, the Fifth Brigade was re-integrated into the structure of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF).

This occurred 10 years prior to the better known Stonewall riots in New York City and is viewed by some historians as the first modern LGBT uprising in the United States.  Background   Homosexuality in 20th-century United States  Gay Americans in the 1950s and 1960s faced an anti-gay legal system. Very few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay. This environment was driven by several factors. # Political climate. Spurred by the national emphasis on anti-communism following World War II, Senator Joseph McCarthy conducted hearings searching for communists and other security risks in U.S. government offices and institutions, leading to a national paranoia. Anarchists, communists, and other people deemed un-American and subversive were considered security risks. Gay men and lesbians were included in this list by the U.S. State Department on the theory that they were susceptible to blackmail. Between 1947 and 1950, 1,700 federal job applications were denied, 4,380 people were discharged from the military, and 420 were fired from their government jobs for being suspected homosexuals. # Psychiatric practice. In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed homosexuality in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as a mental disorder, a classification which remained until 1974. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and police departments kept lists of known homosexuals, their favored establishments, and friends; the U.S. Post Office kept track of addresses where material pertaining to homosexuality was mailed. State and local governments followed suit: bars catering to gay men and lesbians were shut down, and their customers were arrested and exposed in newspapers. Cities performed \\"sweeps\\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual. It is within this environment that the Cooper Do-nuts Riot took place.  Cooper Do-nuts  Cooper Do-nuts was a cafe on Main Street in downtown Los Angeles between two gay bars, Harold's and the Waldorf, and was a popular hangout for transgender people. At the time, Los Angeles law made it illegal for a person's gender presentation not to match the gender shown on their ID, and this was often used to target and arrest transgender patrons. For this reason, many gay bars were hostile to transgender patrons and banned or discouraged them from entering. Cooper Do- nuts was welcoming to the transgender community and this made it a target for police harassment. Many LGBT customers had been taken into custody before. Novelist John Rechy, who was present at the riots, described the routine arrests in his 1963 novel, City of Night: ‚ÄúThey interrogate you, fingerprint you without booking you: an illegal L.A. cop-tactic to scare you from hanging around.\\"  Riots   Attempted arrests  One evening in May 1959, two police officers entered the cafe and asked for IDs from several patrons, a typical form of harassment. The officers attempted to arrest two drag queens, two male sex workers, and a gay man. One of those arrested was novelist John Rechy, who describes the Los Angeles Police Department's abuse on this night as a culmination of routine targeting of the LGBTQ community.  Response by LGBTQ patrons  One of those arrested protested the lack of room in the police car and onlookers began throwing assorted coffee, donuts, cups, and trash at the police until they fled in their car without making the arrests. People then took to rioting in the streets and police backup arrived blocking off the street for the entire night and arresting several people. The Cooper Do-nuts uprising is often believed to be the first gay uprising in the United States. Some historians contest the significance, claiming that anyone who was openly gay at the time was in rebellion and risking arrest and imprisonment. Mark Thompson, a historian who lived in the same area as Rechy, wrote: \\"I would not describe it as a riot but more like an isolated patch of local social unrest that had lasting repercussions. I think less in its day, more as a lesson for us today.\\"  Legacy  Although these events are little remembered today, they contextualize the fight for LGBT rights and remind us the struggle was not limited to one city and one event. The Cooper Do-nuts riot and many other events helped pave the way for Stonewall and for all the victories the community has seen since.

The IT infrastructure managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as bare-metal servers, as well as virtual machines, and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a version control system. It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches. Overview IaC grew as a response to the difficulty posed by utility computing and second-generation web frameworks. In 2006, the launch of Amazon Web Services‚Äô Elastic Compute Cloud and the 1.0 version of Ruby on Rails just months before created widespread scaling problems in the enterprise that were previously experienced only at large, multi-national companies. With new tools emerging to handle this ever growing field, the idea of IaC was born. The thought of modelling infrastructure with code, and then having the ability to design, implement, and deploy applications infrastructure with known software best practices appealed to both software developers and IT infrastructure administrators. The ability to treat infrastructure like code and use the same tools as any other software project would allow developers to rapidly deploy applications. Added value and advantages The value of IaC can be broken down into three measurable categories: cost (reduction), speed (faster execution) and risk (remove errors and security violations). Cost reduction aims at helping not only the enterprise financially, but also in terms of people and effort, meaning that by removing the manual component, people are able to refocus their efforts towards other enterprise tasks. Infrastructure automation enables speed through faster execution when configuring your infrastructure and aims at providing visibility to help other teams across the enterprise work quickly and more efficiently. Automation removes the risk associated with human error, like manual misconfiguration; removing this can decrease downtime and increase reliability. These outcomes and attributes help the enterprise move towards implementing a culture of DevOps, the combined working of development and operations. Types of approaches  There are generally two approaches to IaC: declarative (functional) vs. imperative (procedural). The difference between the declarative and the imperative approach is essentially 'what' versus 'how' . The declarative approach focuses on what the eventual target configuration should be; the imperative focuses on how the infrastructure is to be changed to meet this. The declarative approach defines the desired state and the system executes what needs to happen to achieve that desired state. Imperative defines specific commands that need to be executed in the appropriate order to end with the desired conclusion. Methods There are two methods of IaC: 'push' and 'pull' . The main difference is the manner in which the servers are told how to be configured. In the pull method the server to be configured will pull its configuration from the controlling server. In the push method the controlling server pushes the configuration to the destination system. Tools There are many tools that fulfill infrastructure automation capabilities and use IaC. Broadly speaking, any framework or tool that performs changes or configures infrastructure declaratively or imperatively based on a programmatic approach can be considered IaC. Traditionally, server (lifecycle) automation and configuration management tools were used to accomplish IaC. Now enterprises are also using continuous configuration automation tools or stand-alone IaC frameworks, such as Microsoft‚Äôs PowerShell DSC or AWS CloudFormation.https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats- new/2011/02/25/introducing-aws-cloudformation/ Continuous configuration automation All continuous configuration automation (CCA) tools can be thought of as an extension of traditional IaC frameworks. They leverage IaC to change, configure, and automate infrastructure, and they also provide visibility, efficiency and flexibility in how infrastructure is managed. These additional attributes provide enterprise-level security and compliance - making companies keen on implementing these types of tools. =Community content= An important aspect when considering CCA tools, if they are open source, is the community content. As Gartner states, the value of CCA tools is ‚Äúas dependent on user-community-contributed content and support as it is on the commercial maturity and performance of the automation tooling.‚Äù Vendors like Puppet and Chef, those that have been around a significant amount of time, have created their own communities. Chef has Chef Community Repository and Puppet has PuppetForge. Other vendors rely on adjacent communities and leverage other IaC frameworks such as PowerShell DSC. New vendors are emerging that are not content driven, but model driven with the intelligence in the product to deliver content. These visual, object-oriented systems work well for developers, but they are especially useful to production oriented DevOps and operations constituents that value models versus scripting for content. As the field continues to develop and change, the community based content will become ever important to how IaC tools are used, unless they are model driven and object oriented. Notable CCA tools include: {  ! Tool !! Released by !! Method !! Approach !! Written in !! Comments - !Chef Chef (2009) Pull Declarative and imperative Ruby  - - !Otter Inedo Push Declarative and imperative  -  Windows oriented - !Puppet Puppet (2005) Pull Declarative and imperative  C++ & Clojure since 4.0, Ruby  - - !SaltStack SaltStack Push and Pull Declarative and imperative Python  - - !CFEngine Northern.tech Pull Declarative C  - - ! Terraform  HashiCorp (2014)  Push  Declarative Go  - - ! Ansible / Ansible Tower  Red Hat (2012)  Push  Declarative and imperative Python  - - } Other tools include AWS CloudFormation, cdist, StackStorm and Juju. Relationship to DevOps IaC can be a key attribute of enabling best practices in DevOps ‚Äì Developers become more involved in defining configuration and Ops teams get involved earlier in the development process. Tools that utilize IaC bring visibility to the state and configuration of servers and ultimately provide the visibility to users within the enterprise, aiming to bring teams together to maximize their efforts. Automation in general aims to take the confusion and error-prone aspect of manual processes and make it more efficient, and productive. Allowing for better software and applications to be created with flexibility, less downtime, and an overall cost effective way for the company. IaC is intended to reduce the complexity that kills efficiency out of manual configuration. Automation and collaboration are considered central points in DevOps; Infrastructure automation tools are often included as components of a DevOps toolchain.  Relationship to Security  The 2020 Cloud Threat Report released by Unit 42 (the threat intelligence unit of cybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks) identified around 200,000 potential vulnerabilities in infrastructure as code templates.

It chronicles Octavian's war against Mark Antony and Cleopatra, seen from the perspective of the minor historical figures who surround them. Plot Years after the murder of Julius Caesar, his adopted son Octavian has succeeded him as a powerful force in Rome, if only as a senator with a large personal army. Octavian is somewhat threatened by the existence of Caesarion, Caesar's son by the Egyptian queen Cleopatra, who is himself Pharaoh alongside his mother. Octavian's nemesis Mark Antony has left Italy for Egypt, where he has fathered three children with Cleopatra, and his declaration of Caesarion as Caesar's legitimate heir incites war with Rome. Meanwhile, Caesar's other adopted son, Juba, has found the fabled Trident of Poseidon, a magical artifact with unearthly destructive power. He intends to use it‚Äîand the other so-called \\"Shards of Heaven\\"‚Äîto avenge himself on Rome for the death of his natural father, the king of Numidia. Characters * Juba, son and heir to the king of Numidia, adopted by Julius Caesar after his conquest of Numidia * Octavian, Caesar's adopted son and heir * Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt * Mark Antony, former Roman general and Triumvir * Caesarion, son of Caesar and Cleopatra * Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Cleopatra and Antony, twin to Helios * Alexander Helios, son of Cleopatra and Antony, twin to Selene * Ptolemy Philadelphus, son of Cleopatra and Antony * Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, Roman centurions formerly loyal to Julius Caesar, now in the service of Antony * Didymus Chalcenterus, chief librarian of the Library of Alexandria and tutor to Cleopatra's children Writing and publication Livingston, a historian and professor of medieval literature, had been writing fiction for years while publishing multiple academic works. He wrote The Shards of Heaven during the decade after the publication of his first short story in 2005. Asked about his choice of setting, Livingston said: Noting that \\"The Shards of Heaven is intended to fall in the gray area between legend and history\\", Livingston said that while researching the novel he read \\"a great many articles and studies that might bring most folk to tears: from scholarly arguments about the construction of Roman triremes to countless ancient descriptions of places like the Great Lighthouse or the Tomb of Alexander the Great.\\" Livingston previewed the cover of The Shards of Heaven on his website in March 2015. He said that the image, created by Larry Ronstant, was inspired by the covers of Bernard Cornwell historical novels such as 1356, and features \\"roughed up\\" Roman centurion armor as would have been worn by Vorenus and Pullo. The Shards of Heaven was published on November 24, 2015. Sequel In a November 2015 interview, Livingston noted that the sequel to The Shards of Heaven would be called The Temples of the Ark. As of January 2016, the author's web site referred to the second installment as The Gates of Hell. Critical reception Publishers Weekly said that \\"this multipronged tale is dense with action and incident; it‚Äôs grounded in history, mythology, and religion, but not weighed down by them.\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"Readers with an interest in this era will be captivated by the weaving of fiction with the reality of the past and the weaving of the reality of the past with the magic of the unseen world, even if the religious inquiries of the text aren‚Äôt especially fresh.\\" In a blurb featured on the novel's cover, historical novelist Bernard Cornwell called The Shards of Heaven \\"a brilliant debut\\", writing that \\"Livingston has spiced real history with a compelling dose of fantasy!

In total nine episodes and a final were shown, in which three contestants of each season took part. In the final the viewers selected the Queen of the Jungle of the 6th season Brigitte Nielsen to return to the show for the upcoming season. The other contestants were announced in early January 2016. Some new rules were added to the original procedure. For the first time in the show's history 12 participants were announced to compete. The group of contestants was split into two camps with six participants living in each of the camps. Bushtucker duels took place instead of the original bushtucker trials.

Theron Rhodes Wasson (1887-1970) was a leading American petroleum geologist and engineer, who pioneered the use of geophysical surveys to find oil and gas.  Biography  Wasson was born on his parents‚Äô farm near Springville, NY on April 23, 1887. His interest in geology began in high school at the Griffith Institute in Springville, from which he graduated in 1905. He earned a Bachelor of Science from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now the Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, PA in 1910, and that institution gave him an Award of Merit in 1951. From 1910-1915 he did engineering work in CA, including designing a dam on the Feather River. From 1916-1917 he worked as a geologist in NJ and OK, and enlisted in the US Army in 1917. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant at the First Army Engineer‚Äôs School at Langres, France in May 1918, and served as the city engineer of Sinzig, Germany during the US occupation in 1919. From 1919-1920 he did graduate work in geology at Columbia University in New York, NY, where he met his future wife, geologist and teacher Isabel Bassett Wasson. They were married in 1920 and had three children; Elizabeth W. Bergstrom, a biologist; Edward B. Wasson, a petroleum geologist; and Anne Harney Gallagher, an art historian. Theron and Isabel divorced in 1953, and he married Ann Hand in 1959. He died in 1970 and was buried in Springville.Marquis Who‚Äôs Who. 1970. Theron Wasson.  Career  After his graduate studies, he was hired in 1920 as a geologist for the American Oil Engineering Corporation, and in 1921 he conducted the first surveys of the potential for oil exploration in eastern Ecuador with Joseph Sinclair, a consulting geologist. He was hired as the chief geologist with the Pure Oil Company in 1922, a position he held until 1952, when he became a senior geologist for that company. He worked for Pure Oil in Tulsa, OK, Columbus, OH, and finally in Chicago, IL. He excelled at finding new oil and gas fields‚Äîhe was called \\"Pure's top oil hunter\\"‚Äîand was one of the first petroleum geologists to use geophysical survey data. He was credited with finding major oil fields in Venezuela in 1922, in Michigan in 1927, in southern Illinois in 1936, and the Cumberland Field in Oklahoma in 1940. In 1927, he and his staff used geophysical data to find the large Van oil field in Texas, and in 1937 it was also used by him and his staff (working with Superior Oil) to find the Creole field in Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico, which was the first offshore oil well in the world in tidal waters; see also Offshore oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico and Oil platform history. He was profiled in National Petroleum News in 1929, was called \\"one of the leading geologists of the world\\" in a 1940 article about oil reserves, and was quoted as an \\"authority on oil reserves\\" in Popular Mechanics in 1944. He spoke regularly at regional and national conferences about oil discoveries. Wasson entered private practice as a consulting geologist in 1954. He was active in numerous professional societies; for example, he chaired the annual convention of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) in Chicago in 1946, and was made an honorary member of that group in 1961. He advised the geology departments at Princeton and Northwestern universities, and served on committees of the American Petroleum Institute, which gave him a Certificate of Appreciation in 1955. He was a fellow of the Geological Society of America and the American Geographical Society. From the 1940s to near the end of his life, Wasson spent his summers at the CM Ranch & Simpson Lake Cabins near Dubois, Wyoming, where he shared his knowledge of natural history with other visitors. He helped survey some of the nearby Wind River Range, and a creek in that area was named after him, Wasson Creek. A memorial plaque was placed on a boulder along a trail near Wasson Creek after his death.  References   Further reading  *Wasson, Theron. 1927. Lost Lake Salt Dome, Texas: GEOLOGICAL NOTES.

The transition to digital manufacturing has become more popular with the rise in the quantity and quality of computer systems in manufacturing plants. As more automated tools have become used in manufacturing plants it has become necessary to model, simulate, and analyze all of the machines, tooling, and input materials in order to optimize the manufacturing process. Overall, digital manufacturing can be seen sharing the same goals as computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM), flexible manufacturing, lean manufacturing, and design for manufacturability (DFM). The main difference is that digital manufacturing was evolved for use in the computerized world. As part of Manufacturing USA, Congress and the U.S. Department of Defense established MxD (Manufacturing times Digital), the nation's digital manufacturing institute, to speed adoption of these digital tools.  Three dimensional modeling  Manufacturing engineers use 3D modeling software to design the tools and machinery necessary for their intended applications. The software allows them to design the factory floor layout and the production flow. This technique lets engineers analyze the current manufacturing processes and allows them to search for ways to increase efficiency in production before production even begins.  Simulation  Simulation can be used to model and test a system's behavior. Simulation also provides engineers with a tool for inexpensive, fast, and secure analysis to test how changes in a system can affect the performance of that system. Robcad is a popular software used in digital manufacturing. Models of automated machinery and production lines can be created and simulated in real time.These models can be classified into the following: * Static - System of equations at a point in time * Dynamic - System of equations that incorporate time as a variable * Continuous - Dynamic model where time passes linearly * Discrete - Dynamic model where time is separated into chunks * Deterministic - Models where a unique solution is generated per a given input * Stochastic - Models where a solution is generated utilizing probabilistic parameters Applications of simulation can be assigned to: * Product design (e.g. virtual reality) * Process design (e.g. assisting in the design of manufacturing processes) * Enterprise resource planning  Analysis  Digital manufacturing systems often incorporate optimization capabilities to reduce time, cost, and improve the efficiency of most processes. These systems improve optimization of floor schedules, production planning, and decision making. The system analyzes feedback from production, such as deviations or problems in the manufacturing system, and generates solutions for handling them. In addition, many technologies analyze data from simulations in order to calculate a design that is optimal before it is even built.https://www.parc.com/services/focus- area/manufacturing/ Debate continues on the impact of such systems on the manufacturing workforce. Econometric models have found that each newly installed robot displaces 1.6 manufacturing workers on average. Those models also have forecasted that by 2030 as many as 20 million additional manufacturing jobs worldwide could be displaced due to robotization.https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2240363/Report%20-%20How%20Robots%20Change%20the%20World.pdf?utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz -- S_yv5LZTWzdC5IER_NtSl3PcknlmRKCRLWkiY7DXoc24tLeHNQmxbfIluLCA4PrkWMen4_J_hWSH49WG3OQvHF61Jlg&_hsmi=74013545&utm;_content=74013545&utm;_source=hs_automation&hsCtaTracking;=07b1855a-24f4-4b99-bcb8-b0d2a13b715e%7C53b7a48e-9591-4179-8eab-694443190b4f However, other research has found evidence, not of job losses, but of a skills gap.https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/manufacturing/future-of- work-manufacturing-jobs-in-digital-era.html Digital manufacturing is creating hundreds of new data-centric manufacturing jobs ‚Äî roles like ‚Äúcollaborative robotics technician‚Äù and ‚Äúpredictive maintenance systems specialist\\" ‚Äî but not enough available workers with the skills and training necessary to fill them.https://www.mxdusa.org/projects/jobs-taxonomy-defining-manufacturing- jobs-of-the-future/  Tooling and processes  There are many different tooling processes that digital manufacturing utilizes. However, every digital manufacturing process involves the use of computerized numerical controlled machines (CNC). This technology is crucial in digital manufacturing as it not only enables mass production and flexibility, but it also provides a link between a CAD model and production. The two primary categories of CNC tooling are additive and subtractive. Major strides in additive manufacturing have come about recently and are at the forefront of digital manufacturing. These processes allow machines to address every element of a part no matter the complexity of its shape.  Examples of additive tooling and processes  Example of Laminated object manufacturing process Laminated object manufacturing: principle drawing. 1 Supply roll. 2 Heated laminated roll. 3 Laser cutting beam. 4 Prism steering device. 5 Laser. 6 Laminated shape. 7 Movable table. 8 Waste roll (with cutout shapes). *Stereolithography - In this process, solid parts are formed by solidifying layers of a photopolymer with ultraviolet light. There is a wide range of acrylics and epoxies that are used in this process. * Ink-Jet Processing - Although the most widely used ink-jet process is used for printing on paper, there are many that are applied in engineering. This process involves a printhead depositing layers of liquid material onto a filler powder in the shape of the desired object. After the powder is saturated, a fresh new layer of powder is added continually until the object is built. Another less known material drop deposition process use a build and support material to produce a 3D model. The build material is Thermoplastic and the support material is wax. The wax is melted away after the layered model is printed. Another similar technique uses (DBM) Droplet based manufacturing to build Thermoplastic models without support with 5 axis drop positioning * Laser sintering and fusion - This process utilizes heat produced by infrared lasers to bond a powdered material together to form a solid shape. * Solid Ground Curing - A layer of liquid photopolymer is spread over a platform. An optical mask is generated and laid over the polymer. A UV lamp cures the resin that is not blocked by the mask. Any remaining liquid is removed and the voids are filled with wax. Liquid resin is spread over the layer that was just produced and the process is repeated. When the part is finished, the wax can be melted out of the voids. * Laminated-Object Manufacturing - A sheet material is laid on a platform and a laser cuts the desired contour. The platform is lowered by one sheet thickness and a new sheet is laid with a layer of thermal adhesive between the two sheets. A heated roller presses the sheets together and activates the adhesive. The laser cuts the contours of this layer and the process is repeated. When the part is finished, the leftover sheet material around the perimeter of the part must be removed. The final part is coated with sealant. * Fused filament fabrication- FFF is the most commonly used form of 3-D printing. Thermoplastic material is heated just beyond solidification and extruded onto a platform in the desired shape. The platform is lowered, and the next layer is extruded onto the previous layer. The process is repeated until the part is complete.  Examples of subtractive tooling and processes  405x405px * Water Jet Cutting - A water jet cutter is a CNC tool that uses a high pressure stream of water, often mixed with an abrasive material, to cut shapes or patterns out of many types of materials. * Milling - A CNC mill uses a rotational cutting tool to remove material from a piece of stock. Milling can be performed on most metals, many plastics, and all types of wood. * Lathe - A CNC lathe removes material by rotating the work-piece while a stationary cutting tool is brought into contact with the material. * Laser cutting - A Laser cutter is a CNC tool that uses a focused laser beam to cut and engrave sheet material. Cutting can be done on plastics, woods and on higher power machines, metal. Recently, affordable CO2 laser cutters have become popular with hobbyists.  Benefits  *Optimization of a parts manufacturing process. This can be done by modifying and/or creating procedures within a virtual and controlled environment. By doing this the use of new robotic or automated systems can be tested in the manufacturing procedure before being physically implemented. *Digital manufacturing allows for the whole manufacturing process to be created virtually before it is implemented physically. This enables designers to see the results of their process before investing time and money into creating the physical plant. *The effects caused by changing the machines or tooling processes can be seen in real-time. This allows for analysis information to be taken for any individual part at any desired point during the manufacturing process.  Types   On demand  * Additive Manufacturing - Additive manufacturing is the \\"process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data, usually layer upon layer.\\" Digital Additive manufacturing is highly automated which means less man hours and machine utilization, and therefore reduced cost. By incorporating model data from digitized open sources, products can be produced quickly, efficiently, and cheaply. * Rapid Manufacturing- Much like Additive manufacturing, Rapid manufacturing uses digital models to rapidly produce a product that can be complicated in shape and heterogeneous in material composition. Rapid manufacturing utilizes not only the digital information process, but also the digital physical process. Digital information governs the physical process of adding material layer by layer until the product is complete. Both the information and physical processes are necessary for rapid manufacturing to be flexible in design, cheap, and efficient.  Cloud-based design and manufacturing  Cloud-Based Design (CBD) refers to a model that incorporates social network sites, cloud computing, and other web technologies to aid in cloud design services. This type of system must be cloud computing-based, be accessible from mobile devices, and must be able to manage complex information. Autodesk Fusion 360 is an example CBD. Cloud-Based Manufacturing (CBM) refers to a model that utilizes the access to open information from various resources to develop reconfigurable production lines to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve response to customer needs. A number of online manufacturing platforms enables users to upload their 3D files for DFM analysis and Manufacture.

Transfer molding is different from compression molding in that the mold is enclosed [Hayward] rather than open to the fill plunger resulting in higher dimensional tolerances and less environmental impact. Compared to injection molding, transfer molding uses higher pressures to uniformly fill the mold cavity. This allows thicker reinforcing fiber matrices to be more completely saturated by resin. Furthermore, unlike injection molding the transfer mold casting material may start the process as a solid. This can reduce equipment costs and time dependency. The transfer process may have a slower fill rate than an equivalent injection molding processes.  Process  Figure 1: Transfer Molding basic process The mold interior surfaces may be gel-coated. If desired, the mold is first pre-loaded with a reinforcing fiber matrix or preform. Fiber content of a transfer molded composite can be as high as 60% by volume. The fill material may be a preheated solid or a liquid. It is loaded into a chamber known as the pot. A ram or plunger forces material from the pot into the heated mold cavity. If feed-stock is initially solid, the forcing pressure and mold temperature melt it. Standard mold features such as sprue channels, a flow gate and ejector pins may be used. The heated mold ensures that the flow remains liquid for complete filling. Once filled the mold can be cooled at a controlled rate for optimal thermoset curing.  Variations  The industry identifies a variety of processes within the transfer molding category. There are areas of overlap and the distinctions between each method may not be clearly defined.  Resin transfer molding  Figure 2: Resin Transfer Molding 1: Cope 2: Drag 3: Clamp 4: Mixing chamber 5: Fiber preform 6: Heated mold 7: Resin 8: Curative Resin transfer molding (RTM) uses a liquid thermoset resin to saturate a fiber preform placed in a closed mold. The process is versatile and can fabricate products with embedded objects such as foam cores or other components in addition to the fiber preform.  Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding  Vacuum assisted transfer molding (VARTM) uses a partial vacuum on one side of a fiber mat to pull the resin in for complete saturation. VARTM uses lower plunger forces which allows molding to be carried out with cheaper equipment. The use of a vacuum may allow the resin to adequately flow and or cure without heating. This temperature independence allows thicker fiber preforms and larger product geometries to be economical. VARTM can produce parts with less porosity than regular transfer molding with a proportional increase in casting strength.  Micro transfer molding  Also called transfer micromolding, micro transfer molding is a process that uses a mold to form then transfer structures as small as 30 nm onto thin films and microcircuitry. Unlike normal scale transfer molding, the micro form can and is used with metals as well as non metals.  Defects  Limiting defects is key when commercially producing any sort of material. Transfer molding is no exception. For example, voids in a transfer molded parts significantly reduce strength and modulus. There can also be defects when fibers are used around sharp corners. The resin flow can create resin rich zones on the outside of these corners. Pressure distribution There are several contributing factors to voids in the final product of transfer molding. One is a non uniform pressure distribution among the material being pressed into the mold. In this case the material folds in on itself and generates voids. Another is voids in the resin being forced into the mold beforehand. This may be obvious, but it is a main contributor. Things to be done to limit these molds include pressing the resin in at a high pressure, keeping the fiber distribution uniform, and using a high quality properly degassed base resin. Sharp corners Figure 3: Sharp corner generates voids in transfer molding Sharp corners are the problems with all mold based manufacturing, including casting. Specifically in transfer molding corners can break fibers that have been placed in the mold and can create voids on the inside of corners. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 3 on the right. The limiting factor in these designs is the inner corner radius. This inner radius limit varies depending on resin and fiber selection, but a rule of thumbs is the radius though be 3 to 5 times the laminate thickness.  Materials  The material most commonly used for transfer molding is a thermoset polymer. This type of polymer is easy to mold and manipulate, but upon curing, hardens into a permanent form. For simple homogeneous transfer molded parts, the part is simply made of this plastic substrate. On the other hand, resin transfer molding allows for a composite material to be made by placing a fiber within the mold and subsequently injecting the thermosetting polymer. Defects known as voids and dry resin (in the case of resin transfer molding) are possible in transfer molding and often are exacerbated by high viscosity materials. This is because a high viscosity plastic flowing through a thin mold may miss entire vacated areas, leaving air pockets. When air pockets are left in the presence of fiber, this creates a ‚Äúdry‚Äù area, which prevents load from being transferred through the fibers in the dry area. Materials used for the plastic are often polyurethanes or epoxy resins. Both of these are soft and malleable before curing, becoming much harder after setting. Materials used for fibers vary extensively, although common choices are carbon or Kevlar fibers, as well as organic fibers, such as hemp.

It was first performed on January 23, 2004 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in Southbank Centre, London, by Nicolas Hodges and the London Sinfonietta under the conductor Oliver Knussen. The piece was a finalist for the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Music. In 2012, Carter composed a followup to the piece Dialogues II for the conductor Daniel Barenboim's 70th birthday. Composition Dialogues has a duration of roughly 14 minutes and is composed in a single movement. Carter briefly described the piece in the score program notes, writing, \\"Dialogues for piano and chamber orchestra is a conversation between the soloist and the orchestra: responding to each other, sometimes interrupting the other, or arguing. The single varied movement is entirely derived from a small group of harmonies and rhythms.\\" Instrumentation The work is scored for a solo piano and a chamber orchestra comprising flute (doubling piccolo), oboe (doubling cor anglais), clarinet, bassoon (doubling contrabassoon), two horns, trumpet, trombone, and strings.

Hot Mash is a particular variety of casserole whose genesis is generally considered to have originated in the Midwest Continental United States. Although the exact date and creator cannot be pinpointed, articles began mentioning hot mash during the late 1930s and Hot Mash's popularity took off in the 1950s and 1960s after Elvis mentioned it was one of his favorite dishes that his \\"momma made [him] when he came home.\\" Hot Mash generally consists of a butter base with a chocolate product melted in, pieces of meat (such as beef, chicken, lamb, venison, or even pieces of lake trout), various types of starchy binders like pasta, potatoes, or hash browns, and often a crunchy cheese topping.  Etymology  Historians and journalists of the era often cite two possible sources for Hot Mash's unique name. A characteristic Hot Mash generally is very thick when prepared correctly using a condensed soup as the base with the butter and chocolate. This thickness often became the go-to signature of a good Hot Mash, so much so, that local eateries and journalists primarily judge a good Hot Mash based upon the viscosity of the finished product. In a particularly famous exchange, one Hot Mash cook in the Des Moines Register once claimed that his Hot Mash was \\"so thick it could fix a pothole better than hot slurry.\\" The other predominate theory regarding the etymology of the name deals with the composition of the dish. In preparing Hot Mash, many of the ingredients, especially the starches, will need to be mashed in order to facilitate the dining experience.  Initial reactions  Given the unusual mix of sweet and salty flavors, those unfamiliar with Hot Mash tend to exhibit close-minded behaviors and are characterized by rejecting offers of the home-cooked staple. Since its creation, at least one individual trying Hot Mash has said \\"Wow - this is not sweet and salty. This is sweet, salty, and great!\\" An unaccredited scientific research group is quoted as saying \\"the combination of saltiness and sweetness create tasteful synergy.\\"  Protein implementation  In the late 20th century, those residing within the Tri-State region of the Midwest began substituting the initial cocoa powder ingredient with whey protein. In time since, athletes have become stronger, faster, and more competitive overall. It is believed by several that this new Hot Mash recipe is the reason for such.

Recorded in a London studio in a couple of nights, it was released on the labels Warp and LuckyMe on July 23, 2012. TNGHT received critical acclaim. It landed on numerous year- end lists of publications including Pitchfork Media. It was also on the American Billboard charts, debuting at number 180 on the Billboard 200. Background Lunice and Hudson Mohawke first met each other in 2008, when the former asked the latter to perform at a show for his Turbo Crunk crew. After a small number of years of the two focusing on their respective solo careers, Lunice decided he should produce much simpler music instead of being \\"all over the place, trying to push how weird I could get, but the more I continued, the more I wanted to compress and refine my style to a point of, like, 'What if I just made a song out of one snare?' It's natural: After you've been experimenting, you calm down\\". After hearing Mohawke's remix of Gucci Mane's \\"Party Animal\\", in which Mohawke had started doing \\"really simple, huge, stabbing productions\\", Lunice met him to show him new material he had been working on, and the two formed TNGHT. The duo recorded their self- titled extended play in a few days at a very small studio outside of Oxford Street, London, with initially no plans for release. Mohawke described the project as \\"a proper click\\", unlike previous collaborations he had done with which he was dissatisfied because it felt \\"like you're compromising something of yourself in it\\". In 2012, the duo stated that the instrumentals on the EP were planned to include rappers: \\"Pretty much all the tracks on the EP are placed with MCs; most of them are gonna have MCs on them at some point, though we can't talk about who those people are at the moment\\". Composition TNGHT was found by some critics to sound more representative of the solo work by Lunice. According to Beats per Minute's Chris Bosman, every song of TNGHT is modeled as, \\"Take a warped hook or two, bash it into the listeners skull with psychotic glee, add the explosive pyrotechnics of Southern rap beats, and then tear at the seams\\". Derek Staples of Consequence of Sound described TNGHT as a combination of \\"regional beats\\", future garage, and electro similar to the works of Chrissy Murderbot, machinedrum, and Orlando-based producer Big Makk. As a critic for NME wrote, \\"Chasm-deep 808 basslines bellow beneath spacious marching-band drum grooves, super-sharp snare rolls and quirky snatches of sound, building the tension to near-unbearable levels before collapsing into frenetic, ground-shaking drops\\". Fact magazine critic Tom Lea analyzed that, for most of the EP, kick and snare sounds \\"dominate\\" the drum parts, and noted \\"Higher Ground\\" to be the only song on the EP to feature the \\"rapid-fire hi- hats\\" typical in trap music. Bosman compared TNGHT to the works of GOOD Music producers Mike Dean and Swizz Beatz, also noting its bass sounds were similar to those present in songs by Hit-Boy and its rhythms resembled those by producer Polow da Don. Popmatters reviewer David Amidon wrote that TNGHT opens \\"fairly safely\\" with \\"Top Floor\\", a song \\"just a few 808 snare trills and pair of ambient dubstep breakdowns away\\" from music produced by Mr. Bangladesh, and after that, the duo are fast to present \\"their adventurous side\\" starting with \\"Gooooo\\". \\"Top Floor\\" starts \\"in a bit of warped new-age territory\\" before quickly turning into a more bass-driven landscape with an almost Arabic-like voice sample in the mix. Tapping into the \\"gamer nostalgia\\" of Wonky music, Amidon described \\"Gooooo\\" as if \\"Samus Aran took a seat in the Total Recall chair and was planted in a Matrix-like goth club overseen by Shao Khan\\". The instrumentation of the song consists of a \\"keening, 8-bit lead, chanted whoops, death-spiral snare rolls and gabber-grade super saws\\". Pitchfork Media reviewer Larry Fitzmaurice opined that the \\"tight tonal coils\\" on the song \\"sound like hot knives slashing through metal by its high-anxiety conclusion\\". Carving the songs of English trio Nero \\"to their meatiest elements\\", as elements including looped handclaps and the signature synth rise of Drumma Boy are present, the bounce and juke-fused \\"Higher Ground\\" has only ‚Äì or \\"obliterates\\", as Bosman puts it ‚Äì two hooks, one with looped second-long female vocal samples and another with a synthesized Southern hip-hop-style \\"HBCU brass\\" popping \\"in and out to steamroll buildings\\" for humorous purposes. An AOL Instant Messenger-esque sound effect of a cooing baby and \\"glowing, trance-like synths\\" are played on \\"Bugg'n\\", which was analogized by Amidon as if \\"Diddy Kong got ahold of a 9MM on the honeycomb levels\\". TNGHT closes with \\"Easy Easy\\", a song led by a \\"discombobulating synth that should soundtrack an animated version of Black Swan\\" over samples of broken and smashed windows, looped car crash noises, and gun-cocking sounds used as percussion. Critical reception TNGHT garnered critical acclaim upon release. The EP holds an aggregated weighted mean of 83 out of 100 from Metacritic based on nine reviews, while on AnyDecentMusic?, it has an aggregate 7.8 out of ten, also a weighted average. Writing for NME, Jon Cook, scoring it a 9 out of 10, said that listeners were right in having high expectations for TNGHT, noting that songs like \\"Bugg'n\\", \\"Goooo\\", and \\"Easy Easy\\" best display the \\"oddball brilliance\\" of the EP. Amidon highlighted that, rather than \\"playing spot the influence with us or pointing at Atlanta groups like 1017 Brick Squad and Duct Tape Entertainment with ironic laughter\\", the two combined what was great about their very different styles \\"into a very synthetic, parasitical whole\\", calling the EP the year's \\"most unexpected ‚Äì and welcome ‚Äì entry into the club's current infatuation with trap rap's 808 abuse\\". Deviant, reviewing for Sputnikmusic, had a similar opinion, saying that while collaboration albums can normally be \\"tiresome affair[s]\\", the collaboration of Lunice and Hudson Mahawke is a \\"rare yet perfect duality, where we can still see what each producer has on display but when entwined together it becomes impossible to discern where one ends and the other begins\\". A review published in Resident Advisor called it \\"way more clever than your average thuggish bombast\\". Some reviewers felt that the group had yet to show more of their potential than what they recorded on TNGHT. These included Larry Fitzmaurice, a critic for Pitchfork Media, who awarded TNGHT the label of \\"Best New Music\\" and called it \\"some of the year's most brazen, positively huge hip-hop sounds\\". He predicted that the two have \\"already yielded results so impressive and of-the-moment that it's likely we haven't heard the last of it\\". Lea shared a similar conclusion, predicting that all of the duo's qualities would be heard on their work with Danny Brown and a remix of a Waka Flocka Flame song. However, while he called TNGHT \\"big, dumb, and a lot of fun\\", he also wrote it felt like it was \\"the start of something great than a great record in itself\\". Deviant, stating that it \\"ends before it's even really begun\\", called it an overall \\"tremendous and kaleidoscopic introduction to a dream production duo that has already turned heads\\", but he wrote that only a small part of the duo's imagination shown at their live debut at South by Southwest is present on the record. In a more mixed review, XLR8R critic Glenn Jackson thought the EP has tracks \\"that are surely bound to prove useful to DJs operating in the more booming regions of 140-plus-bpm fare\\", but criticized it for removing Mohawke's \\"noted penchant for sonic adventure\\" in place of Lunice's \\"proficiency for big-system bangers\\", concluding that \\"the five tracks here result in little more than the requisite head nod for the rest of us\\".

The Enforcement and Control UnitÔºàE&C;Ôºâis in charge of enforcing traffic laws and arresting those who break them while the Accident Investigation Division (AI) investigates traffic related accidents. To Cheuk-fung (Kenny Wong) is the Inspector In-charge of the E&C; Unit. His stern and cold appearance makes him an awkward character to work with and is also unapproachable to his subordinates, but his dedication and demand in his job also makes his family life non-existent. When the former Police Commissioner's daughter Bui Sam-jou (Sisley Choi), who everyone calls Bui Baby, is assigned to his unit and put under his supervision he is not afraid to lecture her when he thinks she has done wrong even though all other senior ranking officers are afraid to offend her due to respect for her father. Bui Baby is dedicated and, wanting to show her full potential, takes To Sir's comments seriously to improve herself. After seeing Bui Baby's passion and commitment to her job, and her being the only one not afraid to approach him when he is down, the two form a mentor and protege relationship. To Sir's other problems are his former subordinate Sze Ma (Benjamin Yuen) has just been promoted to Inspector in the AI division. Sze Ma's odd behavior often is misunderstood and offends other people. Due to his behavior the E&C; team thinks he has forgotten about them now that he is with AI, causing a slight rivalry between the two divisions. However Sze Ma is also very dedicated to his job and often only sleeps a few hours a day while trying to solve cases. It also makes his life non-social which results to him talking to a toy basketball he named Jason as if it was a real person. He notices that his new subordinate Yiu Yiu (Natalie Tong) who has been a dedicated officer with a great reputation for her photographic memory, no longer gives her full potential at work and always leaves on time due to the haunting memory of her parents' deaths. Wanting to help her get past the tragedy and to push her to her former self, Sze Ma uses odd tactics that end up offending her. Yiu Yiu, who can't stand Sze Ma, doesn't know that he has fallen in love with her while working closely with her, with even Sze Ma himself scared of these feelings at first since Yiu Yiu doesn't fit his usual tall and long leg type. Cases ; When a delivery truck carrying illegal fireworks rear ends a bridal car it is assumed that the delivery truck caused the accident but with evidence showing the delivery truck's windshield was struck by an unknown object causing the accident, newly promoted AI Inspector Sze Ma Sir must try to solve who really caused the accident. The Best Man driving the bridal car claims the delivery truck crashed into him but testimony from the truck drivers claimed an object struck their windshield and that the bridal car was swiveling right and left on the road. ; On her first day at E&C;, Bui Sam-jou is assigned to go undercover and ticket bus drivers who do not comply with the law. When she unreasonably tickets a driver with a total of 8 tickets, the driver does the extreme by drinking energy drinks in order to work extra shifts to pay off the tickets. Bui Baby happens to be a regular passenger on the same bus driver vehicle during one of these extreme shifts and witnessed the occurrence of an accident. She sees the driver of the private car acting unusual and also the bus driver falling asleep at the wheel. When the bus driver is charged with vehicular homicide, Bui Baby does her best to remember every detail and keeps recanting her statement. Her eagerness to clear the bus driver causes her to offend the AI team and Sze Ma Sir in front of high-ranking officials. ; To Sir's former subordinate in Narcotics Bureau and protege Wing Tak-him has been taunting traffic officers by dangerously speeding in traffic. To Sir tries to bring down Tak-him who is now a drug trafficker but doing so reopens the past that could hurt his career. Madam So's late husband Au Suen-wai was also a subordinate under To Sir in Narcotics Bureau, however Suen-wai's gambling addiction got him entangled with Tak-him illegal dealings and ultimately caused his death. In order to cover Suen-wai illegal activities, To Sir lied to let him die honorably.

With only a key found on the elderly lady and no one filing a missing person report, the AI team has the daunting task of finding out what the key unlocks and who she is. Short on staff with no one wanting to take on this task, Sze Ma Sir ask if the E&C; team can lend them a person. To Sir agrees but lends the AI team his most unskilled team member which is Bui Baby.

To determine how the accident happened Sze Ma must reconstruct it with the expensive sports car the suspect was driving. Since the suspect is unwilling to lend his sports car to the police Sze Ma resorts to asking the only other person in Hong Kong that has the same exact sports car, which is his on and off girlfriend Pearl's other boyfriend. ; Dangerous criminal Hung Fan's wife Chui Ying, who is also a wanted criminal herself, is planning to break him out of prison on the day of his trial.

Oamaru's first post office was built in 1864 to a design by William Mason and William Clayton. The town was prosperous and soon, the building was too small. The government advanced NZ¬£4,000 and tenders were called in February 1883 for a new building next to the first post office. The North Otago Times described the design plans with the following words: > It is designed in the Italian order of architecture, in a massive and > handsome style; there being no redundancy of intricate ornamental > workmanship about the facings. ... The base of the building will be of blue > stone; the rest, of course, of Oamaru stone. The exterior of the building as > it appears on the plans will be decidedly handsome; having a height to the > top of the parapet of 45 feet, and from the above description it will be > seen that the accommodation provided for the public will be a decided > improvement upon the existing state of things. The building was opened in 1884, but much to the population's disappointment, the clock tower was not erected initially. As it was large and richly ornamented, it soon was a favourite motive for post cards, calendars, and crockery. Ten years later, the tower was added, but the Post and Telegraph Department insisted that the clock and chimes be funded by the Oamaru Borough. John McLean, a rich runholder and businessman who had lived in Oamaru for the last few decades of his life and who died in 1902, left money in his will for the clock. As McLean had never married, it was up to his nephew, John Buckley, a son of George Buckley, to unveil the additions on 17 September 1903. In the mid-1940s, many post offices had their heavy clocks removed, as they posed an earthquake risk. Whilst lobbying against this measure was often unsuccessful, the clock in the Oamaru post office was allowed to remain. The building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now called Heritage New Zealand) on 28 June 1990 with registration number 2294. The building has a category I listing. The post office moved out in 1994, and the Waitaki District Council has used the premises since.

Shot in the spring of 1974 and released before the end of the year, the film examines the human costs of the Vietnam War. The camera follows American actress Jane Fonda and her husband Tom Hayden, already known in their home country for antiwar activism, as they make inquiries regarding the war's effects and legacy among Vietnamese people from all walks of life. Plot and style The film presents the experiences of Fonda, Hayden, and their infant son Troy as they traveled throughout Vietnam in the spring of 1974 ‚Äì after U.S. military involvement had largely ended but before the ultimate end of the war. Their journey goes from the capital city Hanoi in the North through the demilitarized zone down to Quang Tri province in the South. The trip was deemed \\"a tour in support of the Vietnamese people\\",Streible, p. 407. and the film was intended to show the universality of human lives among \\"the enemy\\" in the Vietnam War. The film largely avoids dramatic details of war and politics and instead focuses more on the day-to- day lives of average people. Fonda and Hayden visit farmers, doctors, artists, soldiers, trade unionists, and even fellow actors and filmmakers in a Hanoi movie studio. One of the key points that it attempts to express is that the Vietnamese people did not hold American people in contempt as a result of the decade-long Vietnam War, always distinguishing between people and their governments.McIsaac, 11 mins. Fonda described the message of the film as one of peace and unity. She noted that, while American involvement in Vietnam had officially ended in 1973, the film helped to raise much-needed awareness of American culpability and the ongoing struggle of the Vietnamese.McIsaac, 58 mins. Critics noted its gentle and unhurried style: Nora Sayre described it as a \\"quiet, moving film\\", while Molly Haskell praised it as endearingly modest in its approach, \\"a tiny jewel of a film\\". Fonda herself calls the film \\"slow- moving\\" but intentionally so, mimicking as it does the traditional pace of daily life in Vietnam.McIsaac, 16 mins. Still, at least one scene breaks the languidity with a shock. An undetected landmine exploded during production, killing a nearby man offscreen as cameras rolled. Wexler captured Fonda's horrified reaction, and this was left in the final cut. She later described the moment as possibly the most powerful in the entire film, remarking with irony: \\"How many times as an actress I was paid to cry....\\" Production and distribution Introduction to the Enemy was the first release of Fonda's newly founded production company, the Indochina Peace Campaign (later rebranded as IPC Films).Ross, p. 247. Cinematography was by Wexler with assistance by Pham Viet Tung. Film editing was handled by Christine Burill and Bill Yahraus. The film was released to select theaters in November 1974. Fonda and Hayden went on an accompanying lecture tour, speaking at screenings throughout the U.S. and beyond. As a commercial release, it was a box office failure, but an expected one. Beyond its limited release, it was frequently donated to antiwar groups and shown free of charge. In interviews, Fonda spoke of the imperative to spread the message of the film. Reception and legacy Writing in The New York Times, Nora Sayre called the film \\"pensive and moving\\" but others were less admiring. The Times' own associate editor, Walter Goodman, labeled the film as \\"Communist propaganda\\", and complained acidly that it plays upon sentimentality by constantly veering among shots of \\"beautiful children, bombed-out-towns, beautiful children, workers making bicycles... and beautiful children\\". An editorial in a Louisiana newspaper called it \\"an unabashed publicist's job\\" for the North Vietnamese. The Hollywood trade journal Variety simply dismissed it as an example of the filmmakers' self-dramatization and radical chic (and even scornfully remarked upon Fonda's \\"incongruously dippy smile\\"). Molly Haskell wrote a highly positive review, with particular approval for how \\"Wexler's cinematography beautifully captures the twin landscapes of destruction and rebirth\\". The film is emblematic of Wexler's personal brand of leftist politics as displayed in his other works, from the 1971 documentary Interviews with My Lai Veterans to the 1978 big-budget drama Coming Home (also starring Fonda). Nonetheless, after his death in 2015, Wexler's obituaries generally gave only minimal descriptions of Introduction, and at least one major newspaper described it simply as \\"notorious\\". From her involvement with the film (and with radical politics in general), Fonda suffered some repercussions, but she defiantly described them only as \\"a loss of cynicism, and a loss of irrelevance.\\"McIsaac, 31 mins. Her professional career continued to move briskly forward. She starred in the Hollywood-made comedy Fun with Dick & Jane, a box office success in 1977, and went on to a lengthy body of work. Hayden went on to serve in the California State Assembly and Senate. He and Fonda divorced in 1989. The film was shown at the 2015 Vienna International Film Festival, and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) on March 7, 2016.

Coached by Shane Flanagan and captained by Paul Gallen, they competed in the NRL's 2016 Telstra Premiership, finishing the regular season 3rd (out of 16) to make the finals. In the first week on the finals, they took on the Canberra Raiders, who at that stage were on a 10-game winning streak, at GIO Stadium. A day before the game, Sharks captain, Paul Gallen did not take the trip and was ruled out with a back injury. 7 minutes into the game, stand-in captain Wade Graham was taken off the field and would not return due to a concussion. Despite playing with one less player (16) for more than 70 minutes, the Sharks managed to earn a week off and advance to the preliminary finals with a 16-14 win, one of the Sharks' more memorable wins in their history. In the preliminary final, they took on the North Queensland Cowboys, who managed to narrowing beat the Brisbane Broncos in a 90-minute thriller the week before, at Allianz Stadium. Paul Gallen and Wade Graham returned from their respective injuries to line up in a near fully strengthed Cronulla side. With James Maloney and Chad Townsend leading the way, the Sharks defeated the Cowboys 32-20 to progress into the 2016 NRL Grand Final, their first grand final appearance since the 1997 Super League Season. It was only the fourth time they had appeared in a grand final in their history.

PROINDUSTRIA, which was born under the Competitiveness and Industrial Innovation Law (No. 392-07 of December 4, 2007), has as its main objective the competitive development of the national manufacturing industry, proposing policies and supporting programs to prompt the industrial renovation and innovation, industrial chain, diversification, and linking to international markets. Background The Industrial Development and Competitiveness Center was born under the Law No. 5009 dated May 19, 1962, by the name of Industrial Development Corporation (CFI). This corporation was created in order to manage the assets and capital of companies after the fall of the regimen of Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo in May 1961. Its main objective was to promote the industrial development of the country, stimulating the productive sectors of the national economy, with the exclusion of the agriculture and the sugar industry. These companies then became the Dominican Corporation of State Companies (CORDE). To this end, the CFI promoted the establishment of new industries in order to achieve diversification and systematization of productive activities, raising the standard of living of the population. Meanwhile, the CFI promoted the establishment of new industries with the goal of achieving diversification, by supporting small and medium industrial enterprises through financing programs with their own resources and through a fund called FIDE (Fund-Bank Finance and Development Central). The CFI also built and developed the Herrera and Haina industrial parks. In the early 70s, by Executive order, the CFI started to build, develop and operate industrial parks in the free economic zone, to promote the export of goods and services. The organizational and functional structure of the Industrial Development Corporation was the foundation for the emergence of the Industrial Development and Competitiveness Center in 2007. Governing body Proindustria has a governing body constituted as follows: Public sector * Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MIC) * Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development (MEPD) * Secretary of State and Executive Director of the National Council of Competitiveness (CNC) * Executive Director of the Dominican Republic Export and Investment Center (CEI-RD) * General Director of the General Directorate of Customs (DGA) * General Director of the General Directorate of Internal Taxes (DGII) * Acting Director of the National Institute of Technical and Vocational Training (INFOTEP) * National Council of the Export Free Zones (CNZFE) Private sector * Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.

For such purposes, it has the faculty to require information to industries located in the country, as well as to public and private agencies that collect information related to the sector of the national manufacturing industry. In addition, as declared by Article 15: The Industrial Register is public, compulsory and free for all Dominican manufacturing industries, regardless of the taxation regime to which they are subject. Industrial Rating This is the process by which manufacturing industries benefit from tax incentives and fiscal benefits established by Law 392-07 on Competitiveness and Industrial Innovation, amended by Law 542-14. Technical Assistance to SMEs The Center for Integral Assistance to SMEs handles all kinds of queries made by the industries. These queries can be as basic as requesting information on how to set up an industry, up to require the Center to apply on their behalf for certain incentives before other State agencies. Incubation and business acceleration The Division of Incubation and Acceleration was the first of its kind in operation in the country. This Division welcomes people who come to Proindustria with an idea or a project, but do not know how to implement it, or if it can be profitable. The Center works with the entrepreneur, methodologically evaluating the project and determining if it is viable or not. If so, a series of customized work meetings begin, which will result in a completed business plan, which identifies all market related and financial variables that reveal the steps and framework needed and necessary costs to undertake, as well as the level of production to be achieved for the industry to be profitable. Productive chain and partnership The Productive Chain and Partnerships Division aims to promote the development of small and medium industries and offers a series of training and technical assistance programs to make them become suppliers of large industries and exporting free economic zones in the country. Productivity support Through the Productivity Support Division, business management diagnostics requested by SMEs are prepared. This Division is also in charge of trainings of continuous improvement techniques and the 5S methodology. In addition, awareness talks are conducted on issues such as Kaizen and Improving Productivity and Quality. Industrial competitiveness training During 2015, the first National Training Plan for Manufacturing was launched. This action, made in conjunction with the National Institute of Technical and Vocational Training (INFOTEP), will run until 2020. Its main objective is to increase the productivity of industries. For this, the program is based on two axes: * Provide technical assistance to industries to improve their processes, products and hence, their production. * Raising the professional profile of human resources, training them in new skills and providing tools that allow them to do a more professional job. Simultaneously, it designs and promotes training programs for small and medium industries through finance, business, productivity, logistics, organization, and human resources courses, aimed to support them and provide them with new tools to be more competitive. Innovation promotion The Division of Innovation Promotion is responsible for developing a national program for industries support, and find them a suitable framework for innovation. The goal is to help the industries understand that innovation is the difference, the added value that can make them reach the market to which they don‚Äôt have access. It also is responsible of encouraging and making possible the link between universities and private companies, which is vital to achieve the research and development cycle. Lease of Industrial Parks and Free Zone Industrial Park spaces Through its Department of Business, Proindustria offers the lease of spaces to companies benefitting from free zone laws and also provides shared workspaces within Proindustria's SMEs industrial parks.

It has rough, corky or flaky bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of eleven, creamy-white flowers and hemispherical to cup-shaped fruit.flower budsfruitbark Description Eucalyptus √ó balanites is a mallee or a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, corky or flaky, pale grey to yellowish bark on its trunk and larger branches and thin papery bark on the upper stems. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are elliptical, up to long, wide and always have a petiole. Adult leaves are usually lance-shaped, long and wide with a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in groups of eleven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. The mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded to conical operculum. There is a constriction at the base of the operculum. Flowering occurs from October to February and the flowers are creamy-white. The fruit is a hemispherical to cup-shaped capsule, long and wide with the valves not protruding above the rim. The Australian Plant Census lists this species as a natural hybrid between E. decipiens and E. lane-poolei. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus √ó balanites was first formally described in 1992 as Eucalyptus balanites by Peter Grayling and Ian Brooker who published the description in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (balanites) is derived from the Ancient Greek word balanos meaning \\"acorn\\" or \\"barnacle\\", referring to the shape of the flower buds. Distribution and habitat Cadda Road mallee grows in heath and open mallee woodland disjunctly in the Badgingarra National Park and on the coastal plain in suburban Perth. Conservation This eucalypt is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). An interim recovery plan has been prepared. The main threats to the species include inappropriate fire regimes, disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and weed invasion. The species produces few mature fruit or fertile seeds and the pollen fertility is low. (The EPBC Act has been amended by updating the name from E. balanites to Eucalyptus √ó balanites.) In 2012, Dean Nicolle and Malcolm French proposed that E. balanites is a hybrid of E. decipiens and E. lane-poolei and should be delisted from the list of threatened flora.

Hansen, 269 F. Supp. 401 (D.D.C. 1967), was a federal court case filed by civil rights activist Julius W. Hobson against Superintendent Carl F. Hansen and the District of Columbia's Board of Education on the charge that the current educational system deprived blacks and the poor of their right to equal educational opportunities relative to their white and affluent counterparts, on account of race and socioeconomic status. Having established de jure segregation unconstitutional in Bolling v. Sharpe (1954), the federal court addressed questions of de facto segregation in D.C. schools, seen in the trends that survived legal desegregation, in Hobson v. Hansen. Judge J. Skelly Wright's decision, in favor of the plaintiffs, sought to remedy the re- segregation or de facto segregation enforced by the educational policies, including tracking and optional-transfer zones, adopted by the Board of Education in an attempt to accommodate the consequences of the shift to integrated schools in the aftermath of Bolling, and within the wider context of emerging racially and socioeconomically rigid residential patterns. Historical Context The post-World War II era experienced a surge in white migration to the suburbs, \\"as city dwellers lured by the prospect of spacious new homes and easy financing left urban areas nationwide.\\"Chris Myers Asch and G. Derek Musgrove, \\"Chapter 10 \\"How Long? How Long?\\": Grassroots Activism and Mounting Frustration in a Black-Majority City, 1956-1968,\\" in Chocolate City: Race and Democracy in the Nation's Capital (Chapel Hill: North Carolina University Press, forthcoming). The growth of the suburbs brought about the movement of employers, as well as the federal government, which began to \\"decentralize its operations by moving agencies to the suburbs.\\" The civil rights advances of the late 1940s and early 1950s ‚Äì including the Supreme Court's rulings in Hurd v. Hodge (1948) and Bolling v. Sharpe (1954) calling for desegregation in housing and education, respectively ‚Äì catalyzed the flight to the suburbs. With blacks now having legal access to white neighborhoods, whites fled racially changing neighborhoods for fear of \\"declining real estate values, deteriorating schools, and a loss of status ‚Äì having black neighbors, they felt, inherently made a neighborhood less desirable.\\" White fears were further exacerbated as \\"schools that had been majority white soon became more than 80% black.\\" Therefore, the decade between 1950 and 1960 witnessed a massive white migration to the suburbs; white population in the city declined from 65% to 45% as the population of blacks rose from 35% to 54%.U.S. Bureau of Census, \\"Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States,\\" Table 9, District of Columbia ‚Äì Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Large Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990. In the 1960s, the former continued to drop as the latter rose. White flight made the preservation of integrated neighborhoods increasingly difficult; residential segregation grew more pronounced. Not only were Washington's white families fewer in number, they were also \\"heavily concentrated in one area of the city, the area west of Rock Creek Park‚Ä¶ east of the park is very heavily Negro.\\"Hobson v. Hansen, 269 F. Supp. 401 (D.D.C. 1967). This was reflected to a great degree in the racial composition of schools ‚Äì ten years after the Bolling decision, \\"126 of the 185 public elementary schools in the District were 90-100 percent black, while thirteen elementary schools were 90-100 percent white.\\"Donald L. Horowitz, The Courts and Social Policy (Washington, D.C.:Brookings Institution, 1977), 108. The legal end to de jure segregation was not sufficient to alter or counter the fact of racial segregation. Background Julius Hobson 1965 was a volatile time in the District; African Americans were seeking betterment for their race as they were simultaneously facing pushback. Education stood as a symbol of advancement for many and Julius W. Hobson firmly agreed, having grown up in a home where \\"education was prized.\\" Hobson's anger toward the public school system sprang much earlier when he was taking his son to kindergarten and had to drive \\"past white Woodridge Elementary down the street in order to attend overcrowded black Slowe Elementary a mile away.\\" From this moment forward, he sought justice for his family and black families alike, beginning his attack against the school system in the District. In a 1965 article pre-dating the lawsuit, Hobson was quoted saying, \\"I am against the track system and the whole concept of testing,\\" and thus he launched his campaign against these ideals.George Lardner Jr., \\"Hobson, Hansen Share Inflexibility On Growing School Problems,\\" The Washington Post, Times Herald, November 15, 1965 Hobson began his attacks with non-violent protests. According to the article, he wanted to boycott the school and to have the superintendent removed from his position. He joined every pro-black group accessible to him, including the Parent Teacher Association, the Federation of Civic Associations, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). His work with these organizations drew national attention, resulting in his being hired to the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), \\"a pacifist organization dedicated to using nonviolent direct action to challenge racial inequality,\\" founded in 1942. The civil rights movement in the District during this time was a two-fold operation. African Americans were feeling a burgeoning unrest as they fought for their rights peacefully, while whites were reacting angrily with violence. Efforts such as \\"pickets, negotiations, and boycotts to pressure businesses to hire black employees at all job levels,\\" by individuals like Hobson, prompted angry backlash from the white community. Alongside Sterling Tucker, Hobson worked through CORE, creating a \\"merit hiring\\" program for African Americans. Most of his efforts in these years represented nonviolent projects to secure better jobs, housing, and education for African Americans. In 1964 Hobson was cast out of CORE and his approach became more radical, culminating in his lawsuit against the school system. Case Background The Supreme Court in Bolling v. Sharpe (1954), a companion case to Brown v. Board of Education (1954), \\"held that the District of Columbia's racially segregated public school system violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\\"Emanuel Hurwitz, \\"Hobson v. Hansen Summary,\\" in Criticism, Conflict, and Change: Readings in American Education (New York: Dodd, Mead & Co., 1970). The same year, the District's school officials adopted a neighborhood school policy \\"under which students were assigned to schools near their homes.\\"\\"Hobson v. Hansen: Judicial Supervision of the Color-Blind School Board,\\" Harvard Law Review 81 (1968): 1514, accessed January 23, 2016, doi:10.2307/1339305. With the court's decision in effect, \\"73% of the schools were ‚Äì in varying degree ‚Äì racially mixed,\\" by September 1955. Educational integration meant that the achievement scores of black students were reported on a citywide basis in a manner uncharacteristic of the preceding system. In the aftermath of integration, Dr. Hansen, then Assistant Superintendent of senior high schools, began to receive \\"reports of very serious retardation in achievement in the basic skills [of black students].\\" The previously reigning \\"separate but equal\\" education system produced these consequences, only revealing themselves in the efforts to counter institutionalized educational segregation. In an effort to \\"treat the causalities of de jure segregation,\\" the Board of Education adopted optional- transfer zones and a track system. While the former gave residents \\"the option of transferring from nearby schools that were overcrowded and predominantly Negro to more distant schools that were integrated or predominantly white,\\" the latter placed students at the elementary and secondary levels \\"in tracks or curriculum levels according to the school's assessment of each student's ability to learn.\\"Beatrice A. Moulton, \\"Hobson v. Hansen: The De Facto Limits on Judicial Power,\\" Stanford Law Review 20 (1968): 1252, accessed January 23, 2016, doi:10.2307/1227499 Dr. Hansen presented the track theory in his book Four Track Curriculum for Today's High Schools. He identified the two basic objectives underlying the system as \\"(1) The realization of the doctrine of equality of education and (2) The attainment of quality education.\\" The system categorized students according to their abilities into several tracks in elementary and junior high schools: Honors (intellectually gifted), General (average and above-average), and Basic or Special Academic, with the addition of the Regular Track in senior high schools to accommodate the needs of above- average students ‚Äì placement in either basic or general track in senior high school deprived students of the opportunity to take college preparatory classes. While the track system was flexible and accommodated cross-tracking in theory, its application was met with charges of discrimination against blacks and the poor. Filing the Case Having learnt that his daughter Jean, a middle school student at the time, had been placed in the basic track, Julius Hobson filed a class action suit against Superintendent Carl Hansen in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, heard by Judge J. Skelly Wright. (Wright, a circuit judge, was sitting by designation.) He claimed that the school system, \\"more than a decade after desegregation‚Ä¶ was discriminating against black students by channeling them into lower rungs of rigid academic tracks that received inadequate resources and discouraged achievement.\\"Cynthia Gorney, \\"Julius Hobson Sr. Dies,\\" The Washington Post, March 24, 1977. Therefore, the question at hand was \\"whether the defendants, the Superintendent of Schools and the members of the Board of Education, in the operation of the public school system here, unconstitutionally deprive the District's Negro and poor public school children of their right to equal educational opportunity with the District's white and more affluent public school children.\\" Hobson was represented by William Kunstler and future corporation counsel of the District of Columbia Herbert O. Reid, Sr. Arguments The plaintiffs mainly argued, with the support of testimonial and documentary evidence, that the track system, whether by intent or effect, \\"unconstitutionally discriminates against the Negro and the poor.\\" The data presented revealed patterns of class-based and racial separation of students that clearly established relations between socioeconomic class and academic performance ‚Äì the correlation between socioeconomic class and race was a strong and prominent one in the District. The data further revealed that \\"students attending the lower income predominantly Negro schools ‚Äì a majority of District school children ‚Äì typically are confined to the educational limits of the Special Academic or General Track.\\" The separating effect was traced back to the means through which learning ability is measured; the District relied on the students' \\"performances in class and on standardized aptitude tests, both of which criteria are heavily ‚Äì and, as it turns out, unfairly ‚Äì weighted against the disadvantaged student,\\" particularly since the latter is modeled for the middle-class white student, thus implementing \\"the self- fulfilling prophecy phenomenon.\\" Other arguments targeted the quality and adequacy of facilities, allocation and provision of resources, per pupil expenditure, quality of teachers, faculty segregation, and overcrowding in predominantly black schools (while predominantly white schools ran under capacity). The Harvard Law Review outlines the arguments used by Hobson, referencing related Supreme Court rulings that \\"scrutinized the underlying justification of statutes invading 'critical personal rights'.\\"\\"Hobson v. Hansen: Judicial Supervision of the Color-Blind School Board,\\" Harvard Law Review 81 (1968): 1513, accessed January 23, 2016, doi:10.2307/1339305. Hobson believed that these cases demonstrated \\"judicial willingness to intervene when important personal rights are at stake.\\" He felt that in his case, the personal rights of minorities were being ignored through the track system. He saw the clear correlation between race and track placement, as well as between education and social advantage. He argued that education falls under \\"critical rights,\\" claiming that it is \\"of signal importance to minority groups as a means of social advancement.\\"\\"Hobson v. Hansen: Judicial Supervision of the Color-Blind School Board,\\" Harvard Law Review 81 (1968): 1513-4, accessed January 23, 2016, doi:10.2307/1339305. Therefore, the court had to \\"weigh the benefits of neighborhood schools against the detriment to the educational opportunity of Negroes produced by segregation.\\"\\"Hobson v. Hansen: Judicial Supervision of the Color-Blind School Board,\\" Harvard Law Review 81 (1968): 1514-5, accessed January 23, 2016, doi:10.2307/1339305. The plaintiffs used a balance system in their argument, proving that the negatives outweigh the benefits of the track system, standardized testing, and neighborhood-based schooling. The defendants argued that \\"assignments are governed by merit and need alone.\\" Even so, they acknowledged the relation between enrollment in the tracks and socioeconomic status, while denying that \\"any racial bias is operating.\\" Dr. Hansen argued and maintained that the origins of the four- track curriculum \\"clearly precede the event of desegregation.\\" However, this does not deny that from its inception, it was meant as a response to the problems arising from integration, which highlighted the disparity in the equality of educational opportunity under the \\"separate but equal\\" educational regime that were supposed to be remedied as opposed to exacerbated by desegregation. According to the same review, Dr. Hansen and the Board's policies, \\"although nondiscriminatory in form and purpose, nevertheless fail to respond adequately to the educational needs of the Negroes and other disadvantaged minorities,\\" without, or avoiding, giving rise to questions of intent.\\"Hobson v. Hansen: Judicial Supervision of the Color-Blind School Board,\\" Harvard Law Review 81 (1968): 1511, accessed January 23, 2016, doi:10.2307/1339305. Decision On June 19, 1967 the federal court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, concluding that the current system of education compromises the District's disadvantaged ‚Äì namely black people and the poor ‚Äì of the \\"right to equal educational opportunity,\\" based primarily on 11 findings of fact. The opinion articulates a critical sentiment, stating that \\"[i]n sum, all of the evidence in this case tends to show that the Washington school system is a monument to the cynicism of the power structure which governs the voteless capital of the greatest country on earth.\\" The opinion then proceeds to outline the remedies to rectify the racial and economic discrimination evident in the operation of the District's public school system. The decree issued ordered the following: \\"1. An injunction against racial and economic discrimination in the public school system here. 2. Abolition of the track system. 3. Abolition of the optional zones. 4. Transportation for volunteering children in overcrowded school districts east of Rock Creek Park to underpopulated schools west of the Park. 5. The defendants, by October 2, 1967, to file for approval by the court a plan for pupil assignment eliminating the racial and economic discrimination found to exist in the operation of the Washington public school system. 6. Substantial integration of the faculty of each school beginning with the school year 1967-8. 7. The defendants, by October 2, 1967, to file for approval by the court a teacher assignment plan fully integrating the faculty of each school.\\" Furthermore, the decree ordered the abolition of the track system, which is in principle \\"undemocratic and discriminatory,\\" especially given its function of deciding which students will grow to occupy white-collar jobs, while preparing the rest for blue-collar jobs, as Dr. Hansen admitted. Judge Wright reasserted the democratic triumph the decision represented in emphasizing the extent of the insult of the track system, for \\"the danger of children completing their education wearing the wrong collar is far too great for this democracy to tolerate.\\"Hobson v. Hansen, 269 F. Supp. 401 (D.D.C. 1967). The Court's ruling went beyond reasserting precedent decisions on the unconstitutionality of de jure segregation in declaring de facto segregation unconstitutional, largely through adopting a strict standard of judicial review that requires \\"overriding justification\\" from those adopting and implementing the policies for them to be permissible.Donald L. Horowitz, The Courts and Social Policy (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1977), 111. Ramifications Legal Consequences In the aftermath of the Hobson victory, Superintendent Hansen sought to appeal the Court's decision. However, the Board of Education \\"voted 6 to 2 not to appeal and by a vote of 7 to 2 ordered Hansen not to appeal.\\"Thomas W. Lippman, \\"Wright Edict Upheld on All Major Points,\\" The Washington Post, Times Herald, January 22, 1969. Consequently, Dr. Hansen resigned and appealed, along with Board member Carl C. Smuck and 20 parents. Judge Wright allowed them to appeal before concluding that Hansen did not have standing, and that Hansen, Smuck, and the parents \\"had no legal grounds to intervene.\\"David Jewell, \\"Wright Lets Foes Fight His Ruling,\\" The Washington Post, Times Herald, February 20, 1968. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld Judge Wright's 1967 decision, as the \\"orders abolishing optional zones and requiring faculty integration and voluntary busing to relieve overcrowding were affirmed. [While] [t]he order abolishing tracking was construed narrowly to refer to the track system \\"as it existed at the time of the decree,\\" and implicitly not to prevent the school system from adopting a revised track system.\\"Donald L. Horowitz, The Courts and Social Policy (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1977), 115. Meanwhile, Hobson \\"devoted himself to holding the school system accountable for implementing the decision,\\" as he, with the aid of six supporters, launched the Washington Institute for Quality Education, a non-profit corporation aimed at \\"improving education in the District through further court action and \\"watchdog\\" activities.\\"Ellen Hoffman, \\"Hobson Forms New Institute To Improve D.C. Education,\\" The Washington Post, Times Herald, May 28, 1968. Questions over the extent to which the Hobson v. Hansen decree was accurately implemented and abided by led to further legal action, calling for the \\"equalization of all per-pupil expenditures from the regular school budget within a tolerance of plus or minus 5 percent of the mean for all elementary schools.\\"Donald L. Horowitz, The Courts and Social Policy (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1977), 119. In 1969, Hobson, who was by then an elected member of the Board, \\"returned to court to seek enforcement of the order rendered in Hobson I,\\" launching yet another legal battle, Hobson II. Decided in 1971, the court sought to \\"set a standard for expenditures which will not interfere with the successful operation of the school system but which will ensure that it operates in a substantially nondiscriminatory fashion,\\" in its decreed remedies, bringing an end to the Hobson legal episodes.Donald L. Horowitz, The Courts and Social Policy (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1977), 118-9; Hobson v. Hansen, 327 F. Supp. 844 (D.D.C. 1971). De Facto Legacies Having been issued, the decree took effect. By that time, the school board had already launched a \\"construction program to correct inequalities in building facilities,\\" thus responding to charges against the inequality and inadequacy of facilities.\\"Hobson v. Hansen: Judicial Supervision of the Color-Blind School Board,\\" Harvard Law Review 81 (1968): 1517, accessed January 23, 2016, doi:10.2307/1339305. Most notably, the tracking system, and optional-transfer zones were now abolished, as Hobson set out to achieve. To accommodate the terms of the decree, corresponding \\"changes in school boundaries were made to place school enrollments nearer to capacity.\\"Donald L. Horowitz, The Courts and Social Policy (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1977), 116. Where these proved insufficient, children who volunteered could be bused from east of the Park to the west, where enrollments were usually below capacity. Furthermore, in an effort to integrate faculties, the Board \\"designated schools in which the ratio of black to white teachers deviated by more than 10 percent from the citywide ratio,\\" before voluntary teacher transfers took place, and new teachers were \\"assigned to schools on a color-conscious basis until the faculties in these schools were brought within the 10 percent limit.\\" In the year following the decision, \\"Congress changed the method of choosing School Board members, providing for their election by the people of the District of Columbia,\\" as opposed to their appointment. Hobson became an elected member.\\"School Maze,\\" The Washington Post, Times Herald, January 24, 1969. With segregation, both de jure and de facto, declared unconstitutional, the opportunities for racial integration in schools were available. What remained was the ebbing of the ideology underlying de facto segregation. The resistance to a changing status quo was manifest in the ensuing decline in white enrollment, accelerated by the decision. Between 1967 and 1968, white enrollment in elementary schools dropped by 16% from 6,692 to 5,629, at \\"approximately twice the rate of decline of the preceding year and of the following several years.\\" References Category:United States federal case law Category:United States education case law Category:1967 in United States case law Category:Legal history of the District of Columbia Category:African-American history of Washington, D.C.

He served three terms in the Oregon House of Representatives followed by two terms in the Oregon State Senate. A conservative Democrat from a rural district, Overhulse was known for his ability to work with Republicans as well as fellow Democrats in the state legislature. He was elected President of the Oregon Senate eleven days after taking his seat in the state senate, the first Democrat elected to that position in 79 years.  Early life  Overhulse was born on July 30, 1909, in Warner, South Dakota. His parents, K. C. and Edith Overhulse, were both teachers. The Overhulse family moved to Jefferson County, Oregon, when Boyd was young. The family later moved to Weston in northeast Oregon, where Overhulse graduated from high school.\\"Three Candidate in Contest for Seat in Oregon Senate\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, October 19, 1956, p. 1. Overhulse graduated from University of Oregon School of Law in 1933. He worked briefly as a bookkeeper for the Oregon Journal newspaper before passed his bar examination. Later that year, he married Helen Graham.Matheny, Susan, \\"Overhulse documents donated to museum\\", Madras Pioneer, Madras, Oregon, September 10, 2014. In 1934, Overhulse returned to Jefferson County and was elected district attorney. He was re-elected to that position three times. In 1948, he resigned in order to concentrate on his private law practice. After leaving the district attorney position, he became president of Jefferson County Title and Abstract Company and bought a farm near Madras. He returned to public service in 1949, serving as the Madras city attorney. During this period, Overhulse was active in the Madras Odd Fellows lodge, the local Lions Club, the Prineville Elks chapter, and the Chamber of Commerce. He was also president of the Oregon Bar Association.\\"Mayor Contest Given Spotlight at Madras Polls\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, November 1, 1948, p. 3.\\"Water District Vote to Merge\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, March 15, 1949, p. 4.

The 1957 legislative session was very unusual. The 1956 election produced a state senate that was evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, with 15 senators from each party. As a result, the chamber was unable to elect a president for 11 days. For 288 ballots, the 15 Democratic senators voted for their leader, Walter J. Pearson. The Republicans also voted as a block, alternating their 15 votes between their leader, Warren C. Gill, and three conservative Democrats the Republicans were willing to accept as president. On the 289th ballot, Harry D. Boivin broke ranks with his fellow Democrats and voted for Overhulse instead of Pearson. The entire senate, Republicans and Democrats, followed Boivin's lead. As a result, Overhulse was unanimously elected President of the Senate, becoming the first Democrat to hold that position in 79 years.Harvey, Paula W., Senate deadlock Ends, Overhulse New Leader, Herald and News, Klamath Falls, Oregon, January 25, 1957, p. 1.\\"Madras Man Elected president of Senate\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, January 25, 1957, p. 1.\\"Solons Go to Work After Electing Demo President\\", Albany Democrat- Herald, Albany, Oregon, January 25, 1957, p. 1.Olson, James D., \\"Overhulse Win Chair\\", Daily Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, January 25, 1957, p. 1. As President of the Senate, Overhulse appointed 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans to committee chairmanships and split committee memberships equally between the two parties as well. As a conservative rural legislator, Overhulse sometimes voted with the Republicans, but also stood with fellow Democrats on many issues.Warren, William, \\"Senate Okays Addition of 1 Member to Each Branch of Legisature\\", Daily Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, April 5, 1957, p. 2.Olson, James, \\"Party Lines Waiver in Tied Senate as session Goes On\\", Daily Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, April 8, 1957, p. 3. His bi-partisan leadership approach was very effective and made him popular with all his colleagues in the legislature. When friends in Central Oregon decided to honor Overhulse at a tribute dinner in Madras, over 300 civic and political leaders from around the state attended. The master of ceremonies at the event was Tom McCall, a future Republican governor of Oregon. The Republican leader in the senate, Warren Gill, attended as did Walter Pearson, the senate's Democratic leader. The speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives also attended along with numerous other legislators, who rented a bus for the trip from Salem to Madras and back. In addition, Governor Robert D. Holmes, United States Senator Wayne Morse, Oregon congressman Al Ullman, and Portland mayor Terry Schrunk all sent personal telegrams which McCall read to the guests at the dinner. At the event, Overhulse was presented with a peace pipe by an elder of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, recognizing him for \\"keeping the peace\\" in Oregon's state government.Barber, Bob, \\"Over 200 People gather to Honor Boyd Overhulse\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, March 4, 1957, p. 1.Olson, James D., \\"Madras gathering Honors Overhulse\\", Daily Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, March 4, 1957, p. 11.McCall, Tom Lawson, \\"New President of Senate Honored at Madras Party\\", Albany Democrat-Herald, Albany, Oregon, March 7, 1957, p. 16.

In October of that year, a special legislative session was call to pass a tax relief bill. This was the result of increased tax revenue that produced a tax surplus. The legislature returned the surplus in the form of reduced taxes.

The reserve is situated 55 km northeast of the City of Nizhny Novgorod in the Bor and Semonov districts of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. The site has been a center for scientific study of nature of the region since 1933. It is part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, Ramsar wetland. The reserve was established in its current form in 1993, and covers an area of . Topography The reserve is roughly 25 km across, and 40 km north of the Volga as it flows due east at this point. The north and west half of the reserve are forested, and the south and east are riverine wetlands. 80% of the territory is in the lowlands of the Kerzhenets river basin. The bedrock is Permian clay, marl and limestone overlain by 5 to 30 meters of alluvial sediments. The banks of the tributaries of the Kerzhenets are marked by outcrops of carbonate rocks. Climate and Ecoregion Kerzhinski is located towards the eastern edge of the East European forest steppe ecoregion. This ecoregion is a patchwork of broadleaf forest stands and grasslands (steppe) that stretches 2,100 km across eastern Europe from the middle of Ukraine to the Ural Mountains in Russia. The forest-steppe is an area of Russia in which precipitation and evaporation are approximately equal. The climate of Kerzhinski is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The average January temperature is -12 C, July is 19 C. Annual precipitation averages 550 mm. Winds in the summer are from the northwest, but from the south and west the remainder of the year. Flora and fauna The landscape displays features of Eastern European mixed forest, particularly peat bogs, pine forests (60% of the territory) and alder-birch forests (35% of the reserve) in the lower wetter regions, with associated plants and animals. The remainder of the landscape is swamp and transitional mire. The area was subject to extensive tree loss (to logging and fires, particularly a disastrous fire in 1972 that killed 20% of the trees), so the stands are mostly middle-aged or younger. A recent study of the reserve recorded 103 species of algae, 283 of mushrooms, 205 of lichens, 160 of bryophytes and 593 species of vascular plants. Black Lake, Kerzhinsky Because the reserve is in a transitional zone on the edges of three regions - taiga, broadleaf forest, and steppe - it has animals that are representative of each. Taiga species include caribou, wolverine and squirrel. Broadleaf forests to the west contribute martens, minks, and wood mice. Steppe species include voles, hedgehogs, and field mice. Throughout are the larger mammals of the woods: wolf, fox, badger, stoat, weasel, and bear. Part of the work of the reserve is experimenting with the re-introduction and recovery of species that have been lost to the territory. Current reintroduction efforts are focused on the muskrat, the Willow ptarmigan, and the forest reindeer. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Kerzhenski Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are three main 'ecotourist' routes that have been developed for tourists: a floodplain tour, a swamp tour, and a forest tour. The reserve has also opened a visitor center. The main office is in the town of Rustai.

Despite being the religious majority in Iraq, Shia Muslims have been killed in large numbers by ISIL, which is Sunni. On 12 June 2014, ISIL killed 1,700 unarmed Shia Iraqi Army cadet recruits in the Camp Speicher massacre. ISIL has also targeted Shia prisoners. According to witnesses, after the militant group took the city of Mosul, they divided the Sunni prisoners from the Shia prisoners. Up to 670 Shia prisoners were then taken to another location and executed. Kurdish officials in Erbil reported on the incident of Sunni and Shia prisoners being separated and Shia prisoners being killed after the Mosul prison fell to ISIL. ISIL is also responsible for the genocidal massacre and ethnic cleansing of Christians and Yazidis in northern Iraq on a \\"historic scale\\", putting entire communities \\"at risk of being wiped off the map of Iraq\\". In a special report released on 2 September 2014, Amnesty International described how ISIL had \\"systematically targeted non-Sunni Muslim communities, killing or abducting hundreds, possibly thousands, of individuals and forcing more than tens of thousands of Shias, Sunnis, along with other minorities to flee the areas it has captured since 10 June 2014\\". The most targeted Shia groups in Nineveh Governorate were Shia Turkmens and Shabak people. The fall of Mosul In summer 2014, Shia properties in Mosul and other ISIL-held areas were painted with the letter (resh) for Rafidah, a derogatory term for Shias used by some Sunni Muslims. Houses and shops owned by Shias were confiscated by ISIL and given to local ISIL supporters or ISIL foreign fighters. Thousands of Shia Shabaks and Turkmen fled the cities of Mosul, Tal Afar, and the rest of Nineveh Governorate to safer Shia-majority areas further south. Attacks against Shias in Bashir Thousands of Shias from villages in Salahudin and Kirkuk governorates fled to neighbouring villages in Kirkuk after three Shia villages were attacked by ISIL and at least 40 civilians including children were killed near the town of Bashir. Destruction of Shia shrines and places of worship The Shia Uwais al-Qarni Mosque in Raqqa, Syria, which was blown up by ISIL in 2014 ISIL views Shia Muslims as polytheists and heretics. Therefore, it started a campaign to destroy all Shia shrines, mosques and places of worship in Nineveh and all ISIL-held areas. Reports stated that at least 10 Shia shrines and hussiniyas including historical ones in Mosul and Tal Afar were demolished or blown up by ISIL during this campaign. In July 2016, ISIL attacked a Shia shrine during the Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi Mausoleum attack, killing anywhere from 56 to at least 100 people. Genocide claims On 17 March 2016, United States Secretary of State John Kerry declared that the violence initiated by ISIL against Shia Muslims and others in Iraq and Syria amounted to genocide. He said: > ‚ÄúIn my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas > under its control including Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims\\" - John > Kerry Kerry's statement came the same week the US House voted 383‚Äì0 in favor of classifying the atrocities committed by ISIL as a genocide against certain ethnic and religious minorities in its territories. Elsewhere The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Khorasan Province has committed bombing attacks against Shia civilians in Afghanistan.

It has rough bark on the lower half of its stems, smooth brownish bark above, lance- shaped leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, pale yellow flowers and hemispherical to more or less spherical fruit.flower budsflowersfruit Description Eucalyptus balladoniensis is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and has rough, dark grey, fibrous to flaky bark on the lower half of its stems and smooth dark grey bark above that reveals smooth brownish bark above when in sheds in short ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull greyish green, linear to narrow lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are borne in groups of seven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a pedicel long. Mature buds are more or less spherical, long and wide with a beaked operculum, the beak less obvious as the bud develops. Flowering mainly occurs from August to October and the flowers are pale yellow. The fruit is a woody hemispherical or shortened spherical capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus balladoniensis was first formally described in 1976 by Ian Brooker from a specimen he collected south of Zanthus on the road to Balladonia. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (balladoniensis) is a reference to the distribution of this eucalypt - the ending -ensis a Latin suffix \\"denoting place, locality [or] country\\". In 1992 Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson described two subspecies of E. balladoniensis: * Eucalyptus balladoniensis subsp. balladoniensis that has flower buds with a pedicel long and fruit with a pedicel long; * Eucalyptus balladoniensis subsp. sedens that has its buds and fruits sessile or with a very short pedicel. Distribution and habitat Balladonia mallee grows in dry woodland, often on sandy rises or calcareous sandy loam. Subspecies balladoniensis has a wide distribution south of the Eyre Highway but subspecies sedens only occurs between Balladonia and Zanthus.

But by 1254, they had moved to the convent and church of San Francesco. By 1429, this parish church was in a dilapidated state, and a major restoration, including present facade occurred in 1639.Guida di Brescia rapporto alle arti ed ai monumenti antichi e moderni, by Federico Odorici (1853), page 126-127.

It was designed by W G Smith & Sons and built in 1889 by Sparre & Hansen. It is also known as Assembly of God Hall, Calvary Temple, Townsville Choral & Orchestral Society Building, Townsville Choral Society Inc. Building, and Townsville Choral and Orchestral Society Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This single- storeyed masonry building was erected in 1889 as Townsville's first masonic hall, on a site acquired in 1888 by the Townsville Masonic Hall Company Ltd, all the shareholders of which were freemasons. Freemasonry was established in Townsville in 1866, with the creation of the Hibernia and Albion Star Lodge, no.289 under the Irish constitution. Townsville Lodge, no.1596 under the English constitution, was established in 1875. Both lodges met at a variety of venues until the purpose-built masonic hall was constructed in 1889. Its location in Sturt Street West reflected the 1880s spread of population to the West End, where the need for a building suitable for lodge meetings was growing evident by the late 1880s. The project was a combined effort of both lodges in Townsville, but was initiated by members of the Hibernia and Albion Star Lodge. The hall was designed by North Queensland architects WG Smith & Sons, and erected by contractors Sparre & Hansen, with a contract price of ¬£1,175. Smith (it is not clear whether this was William George Smith senior or junior) and Sparre were freemasons. The foundation stone was laid in May 1889, and an elaborate opening ceremony was conducted the following August. The building was described at the time as simple and severe, but beautifully finished and delightfully cool. The \\"new\\" Townsville Masonic Template in Walker Street However, by 1926, it was decided that a new temple was needed and a two-storey reinforced-concrete hall was constructed at 42 Walker Street in 1934 (which is still in use in 2016). The Sturt Street building was then sold to the Townsville Assembly of God, who occupied the building until 1980. The Assemblies of God (Queensland) (now known as the Australian Christian Churches) was formed in 1929, with the amalgamation of ten pentecostal groups from around the state, including that established in Townsville . In 1970‚Äì71, several old structures at the rear of the building were demolished, the sides and back of the hall were extended, and the building was re-opened by the Assembly of God in 1971 as the Calvary Temple. The building was used principally as a meeting place, but for a brief time in the late 1970s it housed an Assembly of God school for grades 1 to 10. In 1980 the building was transferred to trustees of the Townsville Choral and Orchestral Society; providing office and rehearsal space. The Society formed in 1906 as the Townsville Musical Union. In 2013 the former Masonic Hall continues to be used by the Townsville Choral Society Incorporated.  Description  The former Masonic Hall in Townsville is a single-storeyed structure overlooking Sturt Street to the south-east. The building has a rendered classical front facade consisting of a tetrastyle portico, in the Ionic order which, within Freemasonry, symbolises strength. In 2009 the entablature was painted with the words TOWNSVILLE CHORAL SOCIETY. The facade, with pilasters supporting the entablature with a square parapet above, sits on a raised concrete platform. The hall has a gabled roof clad with metal sheeting with lean-to structures to either side and the rear. These additions are constructed in concrete block and have louvred windows to the north-west and south-west, and a covered driveway along the eastern boundary. Internally, the building has undergone major refurbishment with new wiring, floors, ceilings, kitchen and fittings. A large, tiled baptismal font is located under the current stage and survives from the building's use by the Assembly of God. A two-storeyed chamferboard residence is located at the rear of the allotment, with a concrete block toilet building adjacent. Both are outside the heritage register boundary. The front of the site is concreted with a low masonry wall and metal fence.  Heritage listing  The former Townsville Masonic Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Masonic Hall, erected in 1889 as Townsville's first masonic hall, is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, in particular the development of the West End of Townsville in the 1880s and 1890s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a small masonic hall establishing a strong street presence/identity. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic characteristics valued by the Townsville community, in particular its strong contribution, through its architectural form, scale and materials, to the streetscape of Sturt Street and to the Townsville townscape; and its classical facade, seen as a landmark which reflects masonic identity. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building has had a special association with Freemasonry in Townsville for over 45 years, and with North Queensland architects WG Smith & Sons, as an example of their work.

She was the life partner of acclaimed muralist Violet Oakley and served as the vice-president, president, and curator of the Woodmere Art Museum in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 1940 to 1978. Early life Emerson was born in Oxford, Ohio into a family of accomplished scholars and artists. Her father, Alfred Emerson, was an archaeologist and professor of classical archaeology whose career included positions at Johns Hopkins University, Princeton University, The Art Institute of Chicago, and Cornell University. Her mother, Alice Edwards Emerson, was a pianist and music professor who taught at Wellesley College, the Ithaca Conservatory of Music (and its successor, Ithaca College), the University of Chicago, Cornell University, and Hobart College. She had three siblings: Gertrude, a writer and editor of Asia Magazine; Willard, a banker; and Alfred Jr., an entomologist. She traveled widely with her family to Japan, China, India, and Mexico. Emerson began her art education at a young age, studying with Olaf Branner from the Department of Architecture at Cornell University when she was only twelve years old. By age fifteen, she had enrolled in classes at the Art Institute of Chicago, later studying with John Vanderpoel and Thomas Wood Stevens. While there, she was in charge of the circulating collection of lantern slides of art subjects. Emerson also attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Other students studying at the academy included Cecilia Beaux, Violet Oakley, Hugh Breckenridge, and Daniel Garber. One of the classes Emerson attended was Oakley's mural-painting class, and found Oakley the \\"most stimulating...electrifying teacher, opening up undreamed of possibilities and encouraging every effort. It was exciting, especially to women students as it abolished any sense of inferiority.\\" During her studies at the Academy, Emerson earned two Cresson Scholarships, one in 1914 and again in 1915, allowing her to travel throughout Europe. She was also awarded the Second Toppan Prize in 1916. Career left Partial panel of the marriage of Dionysius and Ariadne, The Little Theatre, Philadelphia Violet Oakley Studio on St. George's Road, Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania In 1916, while still studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Emerson was awarded the commission of designing the mural decorations for the Plays and Players Theatre (then known as The Little Theatre) at 17th and Delancey Streets in Philadelphia. She chose as her subjects a Greek myth, in which King Minos' daughter Ariadne, after being deserted by Theseus, is discovered by the god of wine, Dionysus. In the murals, Emerson combined aspects of Greek and Minoan painting with eastern styles including China and Japan. Tempera studies for the work were shown in the sixteenth annual exhibition of water colors at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1918. Emerson was awarded the Fellowship Prize by the Academy in 1918 for her mural decorations. When they were unveiled at The Little Theatre, Violet Oakley praised both the quality of the murals and the artist. A prolific painter, Emerson exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1918 to 1927 and later from 1932 to 1945. She contributed articles to The American Magazine of Art. She also taught in the Philadelphia area at the Agnes Irwin School, The Museum School of Industrial Arts, and at Chestnut Hill College. Emerson became Oakley's devoted assistant and partner, living and working out of Oakley's famed studio, Cogslea, in the Mount Airy section of Philadelphia, on a number of projects, including Oakley's Harrisburg murals project. They traveled abroad and exhibited together, and their partnership endured for over forty years. Emerson served as curator and director of Woodmere Art Gallery (now Art Museum) from 1940 to 1978. At that time, it was unusual for a woman to hold such a position, but Emerson viewed female artists as equal to their male contemporaries.Woodmere Art Museum, Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Legacy  Emerson has been described as a competent administrator of Woodmere Art Museum partly because of her thorough record keeping. She actively researched items in the permanent collection and organized the paperwork associated with each piece of art; she also solicited information from visiting artists. Emerson donated generously to Woodmere Art Museum, including donating numerous works of art. She also endowed prizes for Woodmere's shows. Following Violet Oakley's death in 1961, Emerson created the Violet Oakley Memorial Foundation to keep her teacher and companion's memory and ideals alive. The foundation also sought to house and preserve the contents of Oakley's studio, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 as the Violet Oakley Studio. Emerson served as the foundation's president, as well as curator and general caretaker of the studio. The studio was opened to the public as a kind of museum, and Emerson organized various activities there, including concerts, exhibitions, poetry readings, and lectures on American art and illustration. Following Emerson's death, the foundation dispersed the contents, sold the house, and disbanded. In 1979, Emerson was instrumental in mounting an Oakley revival as an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

The work was composed in 2012 for the percussion group Third Coast Percussion, to which the piece is dedicated. It was first performed on September 30, 2012 at the University of Notre Dame's DeBartolo Performing Arts Center in Notre Dame, IN. Composition Resounding Earth is scored for four percussionists and requires over three hundred metal instruments to perform. Thomas described the inspiration for the piece in the score program notes, writing, \\"Scored for four percussionists playing bells from a wide variety of cultures and historical periods, the project is conceived as a cultural statement celebrating interdependence and commonality across all cultures; and as a musical statement celebrating the extraordinary beauty and diversity of expression inherent in bell sounds.\\" Structure The piece has a duration of roughly 30 minutes and is composed in four movements: #\\"Invocation ‚Äì Pulse Radiance\\" (homage to Olivier Messiaen and Igor Stravinsky) #\\"Prayer ‚Äì Star Dust Orbits\\" (homage to Luciano Berio and Pierre Boulez) #\\"Mantra ‚Äì Ceremonial Time Shapes\\" (homage to Lou Harrison and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti) #\\"Reverie ‚Äì Crystal Lattice\\" (homage to Edgard Var√®se, Harry Partch, and John Cage) Reception Resounding Earth has been praised by music critics. Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim of The New York Times wrote, \\"...there‚Äôs nothing quite like the hypnotic experience of being immersed live in the shimmering, thrumming, pealing sound cloud created by these instruments, many of which have ceremonial powers in their cultures of origin.\\" She added, \\"Fluidity is a quality in much of Ms. Thomas's work, even as it retains the uncompromising angularity of modernism. Much of that has to do with her unerring ear for tone color and the ever-changing timbres she creates, which pull the listener along as surely as a traditional harmonic progression.\\" John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune similarly lauded, \\"There's a ritualistic quality to Thomas' tintinnabulations, each percussionist assuming by turns a kind of hieratic function. Bell sounds at once ancient and modern ‚Äì bright, dark, shimmering, shattering, rhythmic, lyric ‚Äì combine to create a wondrous, otherworldly carillon. I found the delicate cosmic song of the Japanese rin in the 'Prayer' section absolutely haunting.\\" Michael Cameron of the Chicago Classical Review remarked: References Category:Compositions by Augusta Read Thomas Category:2012 compositions Category:Percussion music ","title":"Resounding Earth"},{"id":"49265396","text":"Guzmania lemeana is a species of plant in the genus Guzmania.

In 1949, he was appointed to the Industrial Court and sat on the 1950 Basic Wage case, which made the decision to award a ¬£1 a week pay rise which broke the barrier of ¬£10 a week. and proceeded to sit on a succession of other courts within the federal and territorial jurisdictions until 1983. Dunphy was the sole remaining judge of the Industrial Court which was disbanded and duties taken over by the industrial edition of the Federal Court. He gained some notoriety towards the end of his judicial career for not bending to political will for him to retire when past seventy years of age, following the passing of the 1977 referendum on judicial retirement age. He remained a judge appointed for life, though it was stated by the government as unable to be appoint him to another court due his being past the designated retirement age, a claim that Dunphy rejected saying that other judges over 70 had already been appointed to other courts.

It is a Gothic Revival church.Gillingham - Our Lady of Gillingham from English Heritage, retrieved 29 January 2016 History Foundation Before a Catholic mission was started in the city, local Catholics had to travel to St Michael the Archangel Church in Chatham. In 1888, a mission was started when Fr Thomas McMahon arrived in the town. The mission was supported by the local Arathoon family. In 1890, construction started on a small building that housed a school and church. It was funded by the Fauld family. It opened in 1893 and later became known as McMahon Hall. Construction On 12 May 1896, the present church was opened by the Archbishop of Southwark, Francis Bourne. In 1903, he became Archbishop of Westminster and cardinal in 1911. The architect is unknown. The high altar and reredos were crafted by a Belgian craftsperson and donated by Louis Brennan. Developments In 1902, the church was extended. In 1934, a new school building was built. It is now called Scott Hall. In 1972, new school buildings were built on Greenfield Road. This meant that only the junior school was left on the old site. In October 1988, more school buildings were built at the new site, and the junior school was moved there. Without a school there, some of the old buildings were demolished and a car park created. In 1990, the church was extended again, this time, with a narthex being added. Between 1999 and 2003, the two halls were refurbished.

It shared credit with other formations for the liberation of Bobruisk during Operation Bagration, and ended the war in the conquest of East Prussia.  Formation  The division was organized at Gorkiy in the Moscow Military District in September, 1939, based on a cadre from the 51st Rifle Regiment of the 17th Rifle Division, as part of the major pre-World War II mobilization of the Red Army. On June 22, 1941, its order of battle was as follows: * 409th Rifle Regiment * 624th Rifle Regiment * 771st Rifle Regiment * 278th Light Artillery Regiment * 497th Howitzer RegimentAt some point later in 1941 these two artillery regiments were removed and the 17th Artillery Regiment took their places. http://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/943RGCC.PDF , p 39. * 169th Sapper BattalionCharles C.

Ivan Tikonovich Grishin in late October, 1940. Grishin remained in command until Mar. 17, 1942, and went on to command the 49th Army. On June 25, the division was subordinated to 20th Army's 20th Rifle Corps, part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. Beginning on June 26, the division was transferred to Orsha. The first trains carrying men of the 771st Rifle Reg't. arrived there on June 29. At the beginning of July, the division was subordinated to the 13th Army. The division was also transferred to the 61st Rifle Corps. It held positions at Ponizova (south of Orsha) and on the Dniepr, a front of 20 kilometers. On July 5, the division's 176th Reconnaissance Company, operating in advance of the division at Borisov, was heavily assaulted by German tanks and withdrew to the Dniepr. On July 8, the division was ordered to move east and hold positions on the Resta River. However, the division at this point had only the 771st Rifle Regiment, elements of the 624th Rifle Regiment and the two artillery regiments actually at the front; the transports of the 409th Rifle Regiment and the remainder of the 624th were still approaching Krichev, and later joined the 7th Airborne Brigade (4th Airborne Corps). The division's antiaircraft artillery battalion was heavily bombed by German aircraft and ceased to exist as an effective combat unit. The medical battalion reached Roslavl and was attached to a different unit.  Battle of Smolensk  On July 10, German troops of the 2nd Panzer Group crossed the Dniepr and seized a bridgehead. The 137th Rifle Division was ordered to counterattack and eliminate the bridgehead, beginning its involvement in the Battle of Smolensk. On July 11, the division began the march westward to the line of Dubrovka, Volkovichi and Usushek. The division was re-subordinated to the 45th Rifle Corps. By July 13, the division was at the starting line for the attack. The immediate objective was to capture Seredyna-Buda, Pustoy Osovets, Chervonny Osovets and Davidovichi. On the right flank, the 132nd Rifle Division was also attacking. The 148th Rifle Division moved forward on the 137th's left. The German troops repulsed the division's attack and soon moved forward themselves. The 771st Rifle Regiment had captured Chervonny Osovets, but was forced to retreat under pressure from German tanks. The division did not retreat beyond its jumping-off line but was bypassed on the flanks by German armor. After six weeks of heavy fighting around Smolensk, the 137th was reduced to the equivalent of only two or three rifle battalions. On or before Aug. 21 the division was again transferred, now to 3rd Army in Bryansk Front; it would remain in that army until February, 1943.Sharp, p 69 A report by Lt. Gen. K.D. Golubev, commander of the 13th Army, on Aug. 21, implies that the 137th, along with three other rifle divisions, had barely escaped encirclement by running the gauntlet eastward through the advancing forces of the German XXIV Motorized Corps and were in no shape to continue active operations. What remained of the division, described as a \\"composite battalion\\" on Aug. 29, was tasked with protecting the approaches to Trubchevsk, in the army's third line of defense. By Sept. 3 its strength was reported as \\"one regiment, with its remaining forces and headquarters\\", still in the same positions. Ordered into an attack against elements of 17th Panzer Division on the 5th, the remnants of the division made no gains and, in fact ended up ceding ground. On Sept. 7, an attack by a German motorized regiment with tanks was beaten off.David M. Glantz, Barbarossa Derailed, Vol. 2, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2012, pp 74, 369, 391, 449, 472, 494 The division continued to hold in these positions until early October as the German forces carried out their encirclement of Kiev. When Operation Typhoon began in early October, 3rd Army mostly escaped being encircled in the Bryansk pocket, but still had to fall back to the east; Trubchevsk was given up on Oct. 9. The army managed to stabilize its positions between Mikhaylov and Yelets by late November,David Stahel, The Battle for Moscow, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2015, map on p 220 before beginning the counteroffensive against the southern flank of Army Group Center on Dec. 6.Michael Jones, The Retreat, John Murray (Publishers), London, 2009, p 142 The counteroffensive ended in late winter with the 137th and its army well to the east of Oryol; it would hold these positions for nearly a year.  Second Winter Counteroffensive and Battle of Kursk  In the winter of 1943 the 137th took part in the Voronezh-Kastornoye operation, helping to partly encircle and destroy both the German and Hungarian 2nd Armies to the west of Voronezh as part of the northern pincer of the operation. After capturing several villages on Feb. 3, the division reached a line between Novofedorovka and Pavlovka. At around this time the division was reassigned to 48th Army; it would remain in this army for the duration, apart from a brief reassignment to Western Front in April, 1944. By Feb. 9, 48th and 13th Armies were splitting German 2nd Army and 2nd Panzer Army apart; the 137th had taken the southwestern outskirts of Smirnye. The offensive slowed in late February due to German forces being evacuated from the Rzhev salient, as well as lax practices on the part of lower-level commands. On Feb. 17, Bryansk Front reported about the 48th Army operations east of Maloarkhangelsk, admonishing lower level HQs against concentrating in the relative warmth and comfort of villages: On Mar. 6 the division was combined with the 143rd Rifle Division to form a shock group, supported by the 28th and 30th Guards Tank Regiments, in a supporting attack along the Pokrovskoe - Oryol road, but after two days of fighting did not manage to dent the German defenses, while suffering considerable losses. The front soon went over to the defense.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd, Solihull, UK, 2009, p 235, 237, 245, 307, 345, 381 Later in March the 48th Army was reassigned to Gen. K.K.

The main blow of the German 9th Army attack fell on the 13th Army to the west. When the German assault ran down by July 12, 48th Army was in good shape to take part in the counteroffensive towards Oryol, which continued into August.Sokolov, p 266  Advance  During September and October the 137th advanced, along with the rest of its army, in the direction of Gomel. Following the crossing of the Dnepr River and the liberation of Kiev in November, Rokossovski's Front (now named Belorussian) continued a remorseless western advance along the southern fringes of the Pripet Marshes. At around this time the division, by order of the front command, formed a separate Submachine Gun Battalion for \\"assault and... counterattack duties\\". This unit was organized as follows: * 2 submachine gun companies (110 men each) * 1 mortar company (9 82mm mortars) * 1 light machinegun platoon (24 men, 8 LMGs) * 1 reconnaissance platoon (armed with SMGs) * 1 antiaircraft platoon (4 AAMGs) * 1 antitank platoon (9 ATRs) This battalion was formed from experienced \\"young men... from 19 to 33 years old\\", and was placed under command of the 771st Rifle Regiment. During the winter of 1943-44 the division also formed its own ski battalion, but this was disbanded at the end of the winter.Sharp, pp 69-70 In January, 1944, the division became part of the 42nd Rifle Corps, where it would remain for the duration. Belorussian Front was renamed 1st Belorussian in February. During the Soviet summer offensive, Operation Bagration, the 42nd Corps was concentrated north of Rogachev to assist its partner 29th Rifle Corps and units of the 3rd Army to break through the positions of the German 134th and 296th Infantry Divisions. By late on June 24 this had been achieved, with the Germans overwhelmed and the 9th Tank Corps exploiting to the rear. The 137th was given part of the credit for the liberation of the city of Bobruisk on June 29 and was awarded its name as an honorific.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, p 182, 185-89, 199 With the defenses of Army Group Center shattered, the division trekked westward towards Poland. 48th Army was transferred to 2nd Belorussian Front in the late autumn of 1944. During the Vistula-Oder Offensive the 137th pushed on through northern Poland before the army was once again transferred to 3rd Belorussian Front. The division fought in the East Prussian Offensive, and ended the war near Elbing.Sharp, p 70 Ten men of the division were named as Heroes of the Soviet Union, five of them posthumously.

The division was part of the 42nd Rifle Corps, 48th Army of the 3rd Belorussian Front in May 1945.Combat composition of the Soviet Army On 12 May, the division was moved to Elbing for garrison duty. In late May, the older personnel of the division were demobilized. The division was ordered to disbanded in August 1945. Remaining personnel were demobilized or transferred to other units. The division was disbanded in the Baltic Military District on 31 August 1945.

The film was inspired by the glories of the Malaysia national football team which successfully entered the 1980 Summer Olympics. The film was released in Malaysian cinemas on 28 January 2016. As of November 2019, Ola Bola is currently ranked the tenth-highest grossing Malaysian film of all-time. Plot A journalist, Marianne is commissioned to research the Malaysia national football team of the 80's. Disillusioned by her working life in Malaysia, she decides to emigrate to England once she completes the project. She goes to Sabah to interview Eric, a former player of the team. In 1980, the team practises for the upcoming pre-Olympics matches, with captain Chow Kwok Keong serving as the interim coach until Harry Mountain takes over. Meanwhile, aspiring sports commentator and Chow's friend, Rahman practises with his mentors. Mountain revises the formation, such as by having Eric being changed from a reserve goalkeeper to a striker. Having not getting used to the new formation, and also due to Chow disobeying the coach's orders, the team is unable to win any friendly matches. Soon, Eric and fellow striker Ali have a falling out over the squad number 10. Chow assumes responsibility for their embarrassing performance and quits the team. The team continues on their losing streak. In the meantime, the three younger brothers of Muthu the goalkeeper are injured in an attempt to help their father deliver coconuts by driving the lorry. Fed up with Muthu's (fruitless) football endeavours and him not being able to help with work, Muthu's father reprimands him. Muthu contemplates also about quitting the team out of perceived incompetence, but does not do so. Chow remembers his pledge to lead the team to glory and decides to rejoin the team. Mountain welcomes him back and advises him to \\"not make the same mistakes I did when I was younger.\\" After extensive practice and military training, the team finally starts winning again. Malaysia competes with South Korea at Stadium Merdeka in the final match, where Rahman is assigned to commentate. In the first half, an opponent informs Ali that Malaysia is boycotting the Olympics. During the half-time break, Ali shares the news to his teammates' disappointment. Mountain and Chow knew about this all along, but could not disclose it lest team morale be affected. Not willing to give up, Muthu encourages them to play on resolutely regardless whether they make it to Moscow. They display excellent skill and teamwork later on as Rahman delivers a thrilling and emphatic commentary. Ali scores the decisive goal; they win 3‚Äì2. In the present day, Marianne gets the now-elderly Chow on television and has changed her mind about leaving.

The song is the winner of the \\"Best Original Theme Song\\" category in the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival in 2016 This song also won the \\"Best Original Theme Song\\" award at the 28th Malaysia Film Festival held on 3 September 2016.  Reception   Box-office  The film opened to 120 theatres across Malaysia and earned approximately RM2.5 million for the first 4 days of its release. The figure had accumulated to around RM8 million thirteen days later. Thomas Schmid, who wrote for Film Journal International, had reported that the film had supposedly failed to reach Malaysia's top 20 box-office, performing \\"relatively slowly\\" compared with other recent foreign blockbusters despite banking on director Keng's success with his previous work The Journey. However, local entertainment portal The Daily Seni refuted this claim, providing their own figures for the film with approximately RM15.3 million as of early March 2016. The portal further explained that the film's supposed flop was due to weekly Malaysian box office reports being never disclosed to the public.

That includes the actual scoreline and the player scoring the winning goal in the qualifier against South Korea. The production team has since clarified that the plot is \\"inspired by a true story\\" as mentioned in the opening scene of the movie, and is not meant to be a historical account.  Disqualification in the 28th Malaysia Film Festival  Ola Bola became a subject of public outrage when it became one of the high-profile films to be disqualified from the Best Film shortlist in the 28th Malaysia Film Festival and lumped in the controversial Non-Bahasa Malaysia categories by the award organisers National Film Development Corporation (FINAS) and Film Producers Association Malaysia (PFM), because it contained less than 70% Bahasa Malaysia dialogue. The action was deemed to be a \\"racist\\" move, as claimed by the president of the Selangor and Kuala Lumpur Screenwriters Association (PENULIS), Alfie Palermo. Filmmaker Afdlin Shauki announced on his Facebook page of his boycott to express his dissatisfaction, which was supported by CIMB Group chairman Nazir Razak and Air Asia CEO Tony Fernandes. One participating cinematographer, Mohd Noor Kassim, also followed suit; withdrawing his nominations in the occasion and returned two FFM trophies he won in previous editions to FINAS director Kamil Othman during a forum held by the agency in Kuala Lumpur. There had also been calls from both within and out of the film industry to boycott the award ceremony. The assistant-general secretary of the Film Directors‚Äô Association of Malaysia (FDAM) Hafiz Ibrahim resigned in protest of the unfair segregation. FINAS has since revamped the category system under instructions from Multimedia and Communications Minister Datuk Seri Salleh Said Keruak on 10 August. All non- Bahasa Malaysia categories were removed and nominees were eligible to compete for Best Film, Director and Screenplay in the original category, where a new category - Best Film in the National Language - is established in their place, where nominees that meet a 70% Bahasa Malaysia requirement can compete in this particular category.

The house was built in approximately 1750 and was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 21 March 2012. The house is situated in the Tilst suburb 8 km west of the city center, adjacent to the Tilst Church.  History  The house was built some time in the mid-1700s as a smallholding under Lyngbyg√•rd. The house had a piece of land by Geding Lake attached during the land redistribution of the late 18th century land reforms. The house is described in an 1834 copyhold document as 9 joists long with a threshing floor and a flail in the 3 northernsmost joists, stable in the two southernmost and home in the middle. The census of 1840 counted 9 residents in the 62 m2 residential area. During this time the building was likely expanded 1 meter in width to the east and was possibly made a freehold. The status is not known for certain but in 1860 Peter Jensen is counted as \\"house father\\" in the census while he was counted as copyholder as in 1840. In 1870 another census Niels Rasmussen is named farm manager but in 1880 he is listed as \\"day laborer in agriculture\\" and in 1890 simply workman. At some point during the late 1800s the barn to the north was demolished and the stable to the south was made a part of the residential unit. Between 1918 and 1953 the house was occupied by Thorald Nielsen from who the house gets its name. In 1980 Tilst parish council bought the house in order to eventually expand the Tilst Church cemetery. Later there were plans to remodel it as a home for the gravedigger but the council thought the price would be too high and instead applied to demolish the building. The building had been noted as architecturally interesting and worthy of preservation on several occasions but the Aarhus Municipality city council nonetheless granted permission. The parish in the end did not have the funds to remove the building and as a result of widespread protests it was instead given to the \\"Tilst-Kasted-Geding Local History Organisation\\" in 1998 which established a foundation to renovate and preserve the building which was initiated in the 2000s and completed in 2010. On 21 March 2012 the building was listed and today it is used as a private residence.  Architecture  The basis for the listing was that the house is a rare example of the typical and formerly ubiquitous smallholder farms of the 1600s‚Äì1800s. The visual relationship to Tilst Kirke and the unchanged appearance of the building was also considered important. The house is a half-timbered wattle and daub structure. It is whitewashed with visible black tarred wooden beams, a thatched roof with pointed wooden gables and one brick chimney.

It has smooth pinkish bark, narrow lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of nine, pale yellow flowers and down-turned, hemispherical fruit.E. beardiana flower budsE. beardiana flowersE. beardiana fruit Description Eucalyptus beardiana is a spreading mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey, cream-cloloured or pinkish bark from the trunk to the thinnest branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull, narrow lance- shaped leaves long and wide and have a petiole. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, mostly long and wide, narrowing at the base to a petiole long. The flowers are usually borne in groups of nine, rarely eleven, in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a finely beaked operculum about long. Flowering mainly occurs from August to September and the flowers are pale yellow to creamy white. The fruit that follows is a woody, hemispherical capsule long and with a slightly flared rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus beardiana was first formally described in 1978 by Ian Brooker and Donald Blaxell who published the description in the journal Nuytsia from a specimen collected near Shark Bay. The specific epithet (beardiana) honours John Stanley Beard. The authors considered it appropriate that \\"his long association with the botany of Western Australia should be perpetuated by a species endemic to the state\\". Distribution and habitat Beard's mallee grows in tree heath, tall open shrubland in association with species including Yuna mallee, mallalie, Eucalyptus gittinsii, sceptre banksia, Ashby's banksia, broom honey-myrtle as well as other species of Acacia, Grevillea and Persoonia.

It is a small, spreading or erect shrub with most parts sticky due to the presence of resin, tapering leaves and pale lilac to mauve flowers. It occurs in New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Queensland. Description Eremophila goodwinii is usually a low spreading shrub but sometimes an erect shrub growing to a height of between and has branches and leaves which are usually sticky due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and are mostly long, wide, linear to narrow lance-shaped, with margins that vary from smooth to serrated. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils on a stalk, long. There are 5 overlapping, green to purplish, egg-shaped to lance-shaped sepals which are long and covered with mostly glandular hairs. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is pale lilac- coloured to mauve on the outside and white with dark lines on the inside. The outside of the tube and petal lobes are hairy, the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is woolly. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs throughout the year and is followed by fruits which oval-shaped to almost spherical, long and have a hairy, papery covering. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in Report on the Plants Collected During Mr. Babbage's Expedition into the North West Interior of South Australia in 1858. The specific epithet (goodwinii) honours Reverend Thomas Hill Goodwin who assisted John Dallachy, who collected the type specimen near Mount Murchison on the Murray River. In 2007, Robert Chinnock described two subspecies in his book Eremophila and allied genera and the names are accepted at the Australian Plant Census: *Eremophila goodwinii subsp. ecapitata Chinnock which has simple hairs on its branches and only occurs in parts of the Northern Territory. *Eremophila goodwinii F.Muell. subsp. goodwinii has dark reddish-brown glandular hairs on its branches and is the more widespread form of this species. Distribution and habitat In New South Wales, this species is common on the central west slopes north of Parkes, the north-west plains and far north-west plains where it grows on red earths, on level sand and on rocky hillsides. It also occurs in nearby areas in Queensland and scattered populations further north in that state. It is also found in southern central Northern Territory and a small adjacent area of the Central Ranges biogeographic region in Western Australia. Ecology Purple fuchsia bush is a common species, sometimes occurring in dense stands but it is not considered a useful forage plant for livestock. Conservation status Eremophila goodwinii is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, and of \\"least concern\\" in the Northern Territory and Queensland. Uses Indigenous use Aboriginal people used a decoction of the leaves of this species as a medicinal wash. The leaves are reported to have purgative properties. Use inorticulture This eremophila is an attractive shrub but is sometimes short-lived in gardens. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock. It grows best in full sun and a well-drained soil (if grown on its own roots) but is drought tolerant. It can be damaged by heavy frost but light pruning to remove damaged wood or to help maintain its shape is beneficial.

Also known as \\"Bandha of Odisha\\", it is a geographically tagged product of Odisha since 2007. It is made through a process of tie-dying the warp and weft threads to create the design on the loom prior to weaving. It is unlike any other ikat woven in the rest of the country because of its design process, which has been called \\"poetry on the loom\\". This design is in vogue only at the western and eastern regions of Odisha; similar designs are produced by community groups called the Bhulia, Kostha Asani, and Patara. The fabric gives a striking curvilinear appearance. Saris made out of this fabric feature bands of brocade in the borders and also at the ends, called anchal or pallu. Its forms are purposefully feathered, giving the edges a \\"hazy and fragile\\" appearance. Ikat's equivalent usage in Malay language is mengikat, which means \\"to tie or to bind\\". This silk has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. In 2007, it was listed as \\"Odisha Ikat\\" under the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India, with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Classes 23, 24 and 25 as Yarn and Threads Tied and Dyed for Textile use, Textile and Textile Goods, and Clothing respectively vide application number 22.  Location  The villages where this art is practiced are Mankedia in Balasore or Mayurbhanj district. In the Western Odisha, it is woven in Barpali, Remunda, Jhiliminda, Mahalakata, Singhapali, Sonepur, Patabhadi, Sagarpali, Tarabha, Biramaharajpur, Subalaya, Kendupali, Jaganathpali, and Kamalapur of Bargarh district and Sonepur district. In the Cuttack district it is made in the villages of Badamba, Nuapatna, Maniabadha, Narashinpur, Tigiria.  History  The history of this silk art is linked to the Lord Jagannath cult practice which is a tradition in Odisha. Every colour used in the fabric reflects a symbolic concept of the Jagannath cult: the four primary colours used in keeping with this tradition are white, black, yellow, and red, with green added at a later date. These colours are said to denote the past, present, and future, to the Vedas and the Gods. It is also inferred that the Ikat silk art came into existence by copying the temple architecture which existed much earlier.  Process  Double Ikat weaving loom in Sambalpur, Orissa The pattern on the silk fabric evolves through a process of dyeing the warp and weft threads (yarns of very fine quality) prior to the weaving process. This differs from other methods in which yarns of various colours are woven, or in which patterns are printed on the fabric. To create the coloured design, other cloth is affixed to the yarns at specific locations on the loom. The dye is absorbed by the cloth which, when it is removed from the loom, leaves the yarn dyed at the places where it touched the yarn. A single dyeing will leave the yarn spotty in colour. More detailed designs are produced through an eight-stage process of tying and dyeing the yarn, which requires a high degree of skill and time. It is also the practice to tie the weft threads and occasionally the warp threads to transfer colour to the untied part. More colours are added by repeating the process of tying and dyeing on previously coloured parts; in this way, many colours are added to give the fabric a very bright and distinctive shade. Another notable feature in this Ikat is that it depicts the same colourful design motif on both its front and back sides. No additional yarn is required to produce this effect. The designs evolve during the tying and dyeing process according to the imagination of the craftsman, who does not follow any predesigned pattern but creates the design as he works. The designs developed on the Ikat are generally of birds, various animals, rudraksh beads, geometric designs, dice, temple towers, and pinnacles. The silk fabric made at Nuapatna in the Cuttack district is woven with Ikat yarn as hymns from the Gitagovinda, and this fabric adorns the idols at the Jagannath Temple daily. The Ikat produced by Bhullas from Western Odisha is considered superior in both the use of the fabric and pattern (which include double Ikat) compared to the product from Eastern Odisha. The process of making a sari of Ikat by hand takes about seven months and involves two craftsmen, as the production goes through 14 stages of creation. In addition to saris, Odisha Ikat is used to produce bolts of fabric, bed linens, tablecloths, and dupatta scarves.

(A) Adapted from Pfeifer (2015), (B, C) from Bollschweiler et al. (2017), with permission from the publisher. Gas vesicles, also known as gas vacuoles, are nanocompartments in certain prokaryotic organisms, which help in buoyancy. Gas vesicles are composed entirely of protein; no lipids or carbohydrates have been detected.  Function  Gas vesicles occur primarily in aquatic organisms as they are used to modulate the cell's buoyancy and modify the cell's position in the water column so it can be optimally located for photosynthesis or move to locations with more or less oxygen. Organisms that could float to the air‚Äìliquid interface out competes other aerobes that cannot rise in a water column, through using up oxygen in the top layer. In addition, gas vesicles can be used to maintain optimum salinity by positioning the organism in specific locations in a stratified body of water to prevent osmotic shock. High concentrations of solute will cause water to be drawn out of the cell by osmosis, causing cell lysis. The ability to synthesize gas vesicles is one of many strategies that allow halophilic organisms to tolerate environments with high salt content. Evolution Gas vesicles are likely one of the most early mechanisms of motility among microscopic organisms due to the fact that it is the most widespread form of motility conserved within the genome of prokaryotes, some of which have evolved about 3 billion years ago. Modes of active motility such as flagella movement require a mechanism that could convert chemical energy into mechanical energy, and thus is much more complex and would have evolved later. Functions of the gas vesicles are also largely conserved among species, although the mode of regulation might differ, suggesting the importance of gas vesicles as a form of motility. In certain organism such as enterobacterium Serratia sp. flagella-based motility and gas vesicle production are regulated oppositely by a single RNA binding protein, RsmA, suggesting alternate modes of environmental adaptation which would have developed into different taxons through regulation of the development between motility and flotation. Although there is evidence suggesting the early evolution of gas vesicles, plasmid transfer serves as an alternate explanation of the widespread and conserved nature of the organelle. Cleavage of a plasmid in Halobacterium halobium resulted in the loss of the ability to biosynthesize gas vesicles, indicating the possibility of horizontal gene transfer, which could result in a transfer of the ability to produce gas vesicles among different strains of bacteria.  Structure  Gas vesicles imaged with transmission electron microscopy. (A) Wild-type cells. (B) Pressurized wild- type cells. (C) Mutant cells deleted for the gas vesicle gene clusters. (D) Gas vesicles with different widths. (A~D) Adapted from Ramsay et al. (2011), with permission from the publisher. Gas vesicles are generally lemon-shaped or cylindrical, hollow tubes of protein with conical caps on both ends. The vesicles vary most in their diameter. Larger vesicles can hold more air and use less protein making them the most economic in terms of resource use, however, the larger a vesicle is the structurally weaker it is under pressure and the less pressure required before the vesicle would collapse. Organisms have evolved to be the most efficient with protein use and use the largest maximum vesicle diameter that will withstand the pressure the organism could be exposed to. In order for natural selection to have affected gas vesicles, the vesicles' diameter must be controlled by genetics. Although genes encoding gas vesicles are found in many species of haloarchaea, only a few species produce them. The first Haloarchaeal gas vesicle gene, GvpA was cloned from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. 14 genes are involved in forming gas vesicles in haloarchaea. The first gas vesicle gene, GvpA was identified in Calothrix. There are at least two proteins that compose a cyanobacterium's gas vesicle: GvpA, and GvpC. GvpA forms ribs and much of the mass (up to 90%) of the main structure. GvpA is strongly hydrophobic and may be one of the most hydrophobic proteins known. GvpC is hydrophilic and helps to stabilize the structure by periodic inclusions into the GvpA ribs. GvpC is capable of being washed out of the vesicle and a consequential decreases in the vesicle's strength. The thickness of the vesicle's wall may range from 1.8 to 2.8 nm. The ribbed structure of the vesicle is evident on both inner and outer surfaces with a spacing of 4‚Äì5 nm between ribs. Vesicles may be 100‚Äì1400 nm long and 45‚Äì120 nm in diameter. Within a species gas vesicle sizes are relatively uniform with a standard deviation of ¬±4%. Growth Gas vesicle formation and morphology.

(C) Morphogenesis of gas vesicles from a bicone to a spindle- or cylinder-shaped gas vesicle. (D) Groups of gas vesicles. They form clusters during the early stage of gas vesicle formation, and fill the cells later. (E) Detailed diagram of a gas vesicle. A gas nanocompartment enclosed with a gas- permeable shell. (A~D) Adapted from Pfeifer (2012) and (E) from Shapiro et al. (2014), with permission from the publisher. It appears that gas vesicles begin their existence as small biconical (two cones with the flat bases joined together) structures which enlarge to the specific diameter than grow and expand their length. It is unknown exactly what controls the diameter but it may be a molecule that interferes with GvpA or the shape of GvpA may change.  Regulation  Formation of gas vesicles are regulated by two Gvp proteins: GvpD, which represses the expression of GvpA and GvpC proteins, and GvpE, which induces expression. Extracellular environmental factors also affect vesicle formation, either by regulating Gvp protein production or by directly disturbing the vesicle structure.  Light intensity  Light intensity has been found to affect gas vesicles production and maintenance differently between different bacteria and archaea. For Anabaena flos-aquae, higher light intensities leads to vesicle collapse from an increase in turgor pressure and greater accumulation of photosynthetic products. In cyanobacteria, vesicle production decreases at high light intensity due to exposure of the bacterial surface to UV radiation, which can damage the bacterial genome.  Carbohydrates  Accumulation of glucose, maltose, or sucrose in Haloferax mediterranei and Haloferax volcanii were found to inhibit the expression of GvpA proteins and, therefore, a decrease of gas vesicle production. However, this only occurred at the cell's early exponential growth phase. Vesicle formation could also be induced in decreasing extracellular glucose concentrations.  Oxygen  A lack of oxygen was found to negatively affect gas vesicle formation in halophilic archaea. Halobacterium salinarum produce little or no vesicles under anaerobic conditions due to reduced synthesis of mRNA transcripts encoding for Gvp proteins. H. mediterranei and H. volcanii do not produce any vesicles under anoxic conditions due to a decrease in synthesized transcripts encoding for GvpA and truncated transcripts expressing GvpD.  pH  Increased extracellular pH levels have been found to increase vesicle formation in Microcytis species. Under increased pH, levels of gvpA and gvpC transcripts increase, allowing more exposure to ribosomes for expression and leading to upregulation of Gvp proteins. It may be attributed to greater transcription of these genes, decreased decay of the synthesized transcripts or the higher stability of the mRNA.  Ultrasonic irradiation  Ultrasonic irradiation, at certain frequencies, was found to collapse gas vesicles in cyanobacteria Spirulina platensis, preventing them from blooming. Quorum sensing In enterobacterium; Serratia sp. strain ATCC39006, gas vesicle is produced only when there is sufficient concentration of a signalling molecule, N-acyl homoserine lactone. In this case, the quorum sensing molecule, N-acyl homoserine lactone acts as a morphogen initiating organelle development. This is advantageous to the organism as resources for gas vesicle production are utilized only when there is oxygen limitation caused by an increase in bacterial population. Role in vaccine development  Gas vesicle gene gvpC from Halobacterium sp. is used as delivery system for vaccine studies. Several characteristics of the protein encoded by the gas vesicle gene gvpC allow it to be used as carrier and adjuvant for antigens: it is stable, resistant to biological degradation, tolerates relatively high temperatures (up to 50 ¬∞C), and non-pathogenic to humans. Several antigens from various human pathogens have been recombined into the gvpC gene to create subunit vaccines with long-lasting immunologic responses. Different genomic segments encoding for several Chlamydia trachomatis pathogen's proteins, including MOMP, OmcB, and PompD, are joined to the gvpC gene of Halobacteria. In vitro assessments of cells show expression of the Chlamydia genes on cell surfaces through imagining techniques and show characteristic immunologic responses such as TLRs activities and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Gas vesicle gene can be exploited as a delivery vehicle to generate a potential vaccine for Chlamydia. Limitations of this method include the need to minimize the damage of the GvpC protein itself while including as much of the vaccine target gene into the gvpC gene segment. A similar experiment uses the same gas vesicle gene and Salmonella enterica pathogen's secreted inosine phosphate effector protein SopB4 and SopB5 to generate a potential vaccine vector. Immunized mice secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-Œ≥, IL-2, and IL-9. Antibody IgG is also detected. After an infection challenge, none or significantly less amount of bacteria were found in the harvested organs such as the spleen and the liver. Potential vaccines using gas vesicle as an antigen display can be given via the mucosal route as an alternative administration pathway, increasing its accessibility to more people and eliciting a wider range of immune responses within the body. The Hammer Experiment  Role as contrast agents and reporter genes  Gas vesicles have several physical properties that make them visible on various medical imaging modalities. The ability of gas vesicle to scatter light has been used for decades for estimating their concentration and measuring their collapse pressure . The optical contrast of gas vesicles also enables them to serve as contrast agents in optical coherence tomography, with applications in ophthalmology. The difference in acoustic impedance between the gas in their cores and the surrounding fluid gives gas vesicles robust acoustic contrast. Moreover, the ability of some gas vesicle shells to buckle generates harmonic ultrasound echoes that improves the contrast to tissue ratio. Finally, gas vesicles can be used as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), relying on the difference between the magnetic susceptibility of air and water. The ability to non-invasively collapse gas vesicles using pressure waves provides a mechanism for erasing their signal and improving their contrast. Subtracting the images before and after acoustic collapse can eliminate background signals enhancing the detection of gas vesicles. Heterologous expression of gas vesicles in bacterial and mammalian cells enabled their use as the first family of acoustic reporter genes. While fluorescent reporter genes like green fluorescent protein (GFP) had widespread use in biology, their in vivo applications are limited by the penetration depth of light in tissue, typically a few mm. Luminescence can be detected deeper within the tissue, but have a low spatial resolution. Acoustic reporter genes provide sub-millimeter spatial resolution and a penetration depth of several centimeters, enabling the in vivo study of biological processes deep within the tissue.

Ecoregion and climate Voronezh is located in the East European forest steppe ecoregion, a transition zone between the broadleaf forests of the north and the grasslands to the south. This ecoregion is characterized by a mosaic of forests, steppe, and riverine wetlands. The climate of Voronezh is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Flora and fauna The Usman Forest is representative of pine forests growing on sandy deposits along the left bank of the rivers Don and Voronezh. The tree species in the reserve are a combination of pine (32.3% of the total), broad-leaved (mostly oak) (29.3%), aspen (19.3%), birch (5.7%), and black alder (5.2%). There is a problem in the reserve with invasive species from the Americas - particularly the Canadian waterweed, the American maple, and the Saskatoon pigweed. The reserve has recorded over 200 species of plants considered medicinal by local cultures. Over 1,000 species of plants have been recorded in total, and 60 species of mammals.

The title of the play sufficiently indicates its character...Mr Harpur has undoubtedly made the best of his subject; but it is much to be regretted that the labour devoted to it was not employed on a higher theme.\\" Of the poetry he then continued: \\"Among the minor poems contained in this volume, there are one or two which evidence considerable power in the author. Chief among these is the \\"Creek of the Four Graves\\".\\"Literature in New South Wales by G. B. Barton (1866) pp97-98 In their review at the time of publication Empire rated the volume at a somewhat higher level than Barton: \\"This little volume contains the most satisfactory proof of the existence of native genius of a high order, that has been yet offered to the public. The production of genuine poetry is nowhere a matter of every-day occurrence. In New South Wales it will be deemed by many to approach the nature of a marvel, and will, at all events, be suggestive of novel reflection to men who, however little given to literary pursuits in the abstract, are alive to every indication of progress, and will be especially interested in the so early emergence of the higher spiritual life in a community like our own. Public interest in the matter will doubtless deepen when it is stated that the writer of this remarkable volume, a native-born Australian, has, we believe, never been beyond the shores of this continent.\\"\\"Review\\", Empire, 22 April 1853, p3 External links * The Bushrangers: A play in five acts at Sydney University References Category:Australian poetry collections Category:1853 books Category:1853 plays ","title":"The Bushrangers, a Play in Five Acts, and Other Poems"},{"id":"49265958","text":"The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act (, also called the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 or SRCA) is a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill introduced into the United States Senate on October 1, 2015 by Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa and the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Provisions The bill would do the following: *Make retroactive the reduced sentences for crack convictions (Fair Sentencing Act). *Reduce mandatory sentences, also known as mandatory minimums, for people convicted more than three times for drug crimes, down from life without parole after the third offense to 25 years. *Reduce mandatory sentences for armed career criminals and violent firearm offenses from a 15 year minimum down to 10 years. *Reduce mandatory sentences for drug crimes from 15 to 10 years. *Limit the use of solitary confinement on juvenile prisoners. *Require the federal government to compile a list of every law that includes a criminal penalty. *Increase mandatory minimums for crimes such as domestic violence. *Require the Federal Bureau of Prisons to spend more money to offer more programs and services attempting to reduce recidivism rates and make prisoners participate in productive activities. The bill would only apply to federal prisoners without changing anything in states' laws or judicial systems. Sponsors In addition to Grassley, other sponsors of the bill when it was first introduced included: *Senate Judiciary Ranking Member Patrick Leahy (D-VT) *Senate Judiciary Member Mike Lee (R-UT) *Senate Judiciary Member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) *Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) *Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin (D-IL) *Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) *Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) The bill added the following additional sponsors when it was re-introduced in October 2017: *Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) *Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) *Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) *Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) *Senator Tim Scott (R-SC)  Revisions  To gain more support for the measure, bill sponsors announced revisions on April 28, 2016. Most notably, the proposed amendments would remove provisions related to armed career criminals, add new sentence enhancements for crimes involving fentanyl, and remove the retroactivity of the additional proposed safety valves. The provision making the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive would remain intact.

Opposition Tom Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas, has led a group of other Republican congresspeople who are opposed to the bill. Cotton has argued that rates of murder and other violent crime have decreased so much since the 1990s because of \\"higher mandatory minimums put in place in the 1980s coupled with vigilant policing strategies pioneered by Rudy Giuliani and other American mayors and law enforcement officials.\\" He has also argued that the bill, if passed, would lead to the release of thousands of violent felons. Support On the day that the bill was introduced, Molly Gill, of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, said that \\"it doesn‚Äôt go as far as we would like.\\" On October 3, 2015, Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project, told NPR that the bill \\"is the most substantial criminal justice reform legislation introduced since the inception of the 'tough on crime' movement that brought crimes rate drastically down over the last decades.\\" On October 17, 2017, National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin penned a letter in support of the legislation, writing that the bill would \\"increase rehabilitation. If enacted, it would be a positive next step in our collective efforts to move our nation forward.\\"  Criticism  Writing in Mother Jones the day after the bill was introduced, Shane Bauer described the bill as \\"remarkably unambitious\\" in addressing mass incarceration and argued that it \\"doesn't live up to its own hype.\\" The bill has been criticized by Nicholas Wooldridge, a defense attorney from Las Vegas, for \\"creat[ing] the appearance of reform without doing much of anything to effect actual reform.\\" In March 2016, Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, asked Congress to delay action on both the House and Senate versions of the bill until the information could be obtained on its possible effects on blacks and Hispanics.

In 1279, as Pope Nicholas III was preparing his bull on the regulation of the Constitution of the Ordo Minorum (Franciscans), he appointed an editorial committee to give the document its final form. Members of the committee were: Petrus Peregrosso, the Vice-Chancellor; Comes Giusiano de Casate, the Auditor of the Apostolic Palace; the Curial Advocate Angelo; and Benedetto Caetani, the protonotary.Luca Wadding, Annales Minorum V, second edition by Joseph Maria Fonseca of Evora (Rome 1733), p. 73, under the year 1279, ¬ß x.

In the last year(s) of his life, apparently, Cardinal Pietro was Chamberlain of the College of Cardinals.Johann Peter Kirsch, Die Finanzverwaltung des Kardinalkollegiums im XIII. und XIV. Jahrhundert (M√ºnster 1895), p. 44. The date on which he commenced the office is unknown. His only known predecessor, Cardinal Guillaume de Bray, died in 1282; there must have been at least one other cardinal between Guillaume and Pietro. On 25 November 1295, nearly four months after his death, the Cardinal's estate received a distribution from the Chamber of the College of Cardinals of 11 gold florins, 12 solidi, and 2 denarii from the contribution which had been made by the Abbot of S. Giorgio in Venice and was finally paid by his bankers.Kirsch, p. 97.

The house was built in 1809 and was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 7 October 1970. The house is situated in the historic and central Latin Quarter neighbourhood on Badstuegade by Pustervig square.  History  The house was built by the merchant Harboe Meulengracht in 1809 as a warehouse to store imported products and it is one of the only remaining warehouses facing a street. In 1816, he built an adjacent villa facing Lille Torv and the two buildings forms a courtyard. The warehouse was listed in 1970 and carefully renovated in 1977 and the courtyard-facade was restored to its original appearance. In 1998, the building was sold by Aarhus Municipality to the company Skumhuset (The Foam- house) operating a workshop specializing in foam and upholstery for furniture. In 2016, the company moved to the northern neighbourhood of Risskov and the warehouse was renovated to make room for new business tenants.  Architecture  Meulengracht's warehouse represents one of the few examples of the Louis Seize style. It is a plastered brick building with rococo and baroque stylistic elements. The warehouse was renovated in 1977 when an old building in the courtyard was demolished making the building visible from all sides. The original wooden construction was replaced with concrete columns and the existing windows were replaced with wood plates with small openings.

He is not actively licensed to practice medicine in Australia or the United States. Chachoua offers treatments in Mexico that he claims to be effective alternative medicine vaccine therapies for cancer and HIV, among other diseases. His claims lack scientific support, and are disputed by medical doctors.\\"Induced Remission Therapy (IRT)\\", Stephen Barrett, M.D., Quackwatch David Gorski, a cancer surgeon and research scientist, evaluated the science sections of Chachoua‚Äôs website, and found the case histories unconvincing and the scientific rationale implausible.

Research scientist and medical doctor Stephen Barrett has questioned Chachoua's so-called \\"Induced Remission Therapy\\" and stated that \\"his theories run counter to current understanding of cancer biology and immunology‚Ä¶ No convincing evidence is available to show that Chachoua‚Äôs treatments could work as claimed.‚Äù For treatment of HIV, Chachoua vaccinates patients with Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, which is known to cross-react immunologically with HIV. He claims to have eradicated HIV from the nation of Comoros in 2006. This claim has been refuted by Savlator Niyonzima, the UNAIDS country director of Madagascar, Comoros, Mauritius, and Seychelles. As of 2012, the adult HIV prevalence in Comoros was 2.1%, higher than the global prevalence of HIV in adults at 0.8%. Lawsuit In 1997, Chachoua filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles US District Court against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Chachoua stated that he had shared his cell cultures with them, but after the results had been published, the medical center claimed both the material and the credit. The only issues that made it to trial were Chachoa's claims of breach of contract and of a conspiracy to defame him. Although Chachoua prevailed on his breach of contract claim, the trial court reduced the verdict to $11,250, the amount Chachoua had paid for the testing of his samples, and gave Chachoua the choice of accepting that amount or a new trial on the breach of contract claim. Chachoua requested a new trial. The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Margaret M. Morrow on November 13, 2001, due to Chachoua's ‚Äúhistory of repeatedly disobeying court orders and resort to other dilatory tactics‚Äù and his ‚Äúpattern of misconduct [that] spanned the tenures of several different attorneys.‚Äù\\"Opinion and order granting plaintiff's motion for default judgment as to complaint and denying as moot plaintiff's motion to dismiss counterclaim\\", US Government Printing Office Chachoua was later successfully sued by one of his lawyers for unpaid legal fees and costs, losing a counterclaim in which he accused her of legal malpractice. Charlie Sheen In an episode of The Dr. Oz Show taped in late 2015 and aired January 12, 2016, Charlie Sheen said he had been receiving alternative treatment for HIV in Mexico from Chachoua, stating \\"I'm [sic] been off my meds for about a week now\\"; according to his manager, however, after the episode was taped he resumed taking his medications.\\"Charlie Sheen Temporarily Went Off HIV Medications to Seek Alternative Treatment in Mexico: 'So What?

He was a key figurehead of Karachi underworld and notorious gang war in his hometown, Lyari, at his peak around 2012. Baloch is accused in various cases involving murder, extortion, drug trafficking, terrorism, and after being arrested many times, became a fugitive wanted by law enforcement agencies. Due to his influential ties, it is alleged that Baloch enjoyed political patronage and was \\"protected\\" by the ruling PPP from facing charges but was eventually nabbed after intervention of federal authorities. Baloch denies all the charges against him and says they are \\"politically motivated\\". He is also the former chief of the Peoples Aman Committee, which was a militant group linked to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). In September 2013, Baloch fled to Chabahar, Iran, after the Sindh Rangers launched a crackdown in Karachi against elements of organised crime. A dual Iranian citizen, he was contacted by Iranian intelligence there to provide information on Pakistan's security apparatus and the political situation in Karachi. He moved onwards to Oman and in December 2015, he was arrested by the Interpol in Dubai while still in hiding. In 2016, he reappeared in Karachi, only to be arrested by the Rangers during a targeted operation. That same year, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took suo moto notice of his involvement in the murder of gangster Arshad Pappu, bringing his activities into attention. Early life Uzair Jan Baloch was born on 11 January 1979 in Lyari, Karachi. His father, Faiz Muhammad (known as Faizu Mama), was a transporter who originated from Iranian Balochistan. Some members of his family live in Iran and hold dual Iranian-Pakistani citizenship. In 2006, Uzair fled to Iran while escaping an operation against Lyari's street gangs. There, he obtained an Iranian passport and national identity card. In around 2010, his Iranian documents expired and he renewed them. Baloch started off his career in politics as an independent candidate in the 2001 municipal elections for Lyari's mayorship, but lost to Habib Hassan of the Pakistan Peoples Party. In 2003, his father was kidnapped for ransom and brutally murdered by Arshad Pappu, son of the Lyari drug lord Haji Lalu. This is said to have marked Uzair's foray into organised crime, as he set out to avenge his father's murder. He initially pursued his father's murder case in courts, but received threats from Lalu's gang. Arshad Pappu happened to be a rival of gangster Rehman Dakait, Uzair's first cousin, with the two involved in a bitter conflict over land and drugs in Lyari. His cousin Rehman invited him to join his gang, and while Uzair initially refused, he later acquiesced as they shared a common enemy. Members of the two gangs started killing each other, with casualties reaching the hundreds. In 2009, Dakait was killed during a shootout with police and Uzair Baloch took over his gang. In 2013, Arshad Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were eventually kidnapped by Uzair's gang, tortured and beheaded. Their corpses were paraded before being burnt, and the ashes dumped in a sewer. Uzair Baloch and his associate Baba Ladla reportedly played football with the severed heads. The Friday Times quoted Baloch as having said: \\"It is karma ‚Äì what goes around comes around\\", referring to the avenging of his father's murder. Activities and arrests In 2003, Uzair was arrested by a Sindh police SP Chaudhry Aslam but was later released on bail due to his links with politicians. After the encounter of Rehman Dakait, Uzair became the new gang leader and was involved in many criminal activities. He also became chief of Peoples Aman Committee. Uzair also had links with Pakistan Peoples Party and was protected by PPP until 2012. In June 2014, Sindh Government issued his red warrants and head money of Rs.2 million. He was wanted for more than 50 cases of extortions, target killings of policemen and gang members. Uzair left Pakistan after his red warrants were issued. On 29 December 2015, he was arrested by Interpol from Dubai International Airport. He was taken into custody by Interpol and was brought back to Pakistan. He was travelling from Muscat to Dubai. On January 30, 2016, Sindh Rangers took Uzair into custody after getting his physical remand from Sindh High Court's administrative judge for the Anti Terrorism Courts. He is currently in Mithadar hostel, Karachi under the custody of Sindh Rangers. In February 2016, Uzair's wife Samina Baloch filed application in the Sindh High Court to seek orders for his medical examination and permission for his family members to meet him.. On April 07 2020, Uzair Baloch sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and sent to the Central Jail Karachi after the completion of military trial against him. Properties and assets According to Pakistani media reports, Uzair Baloch owns a four-story mansion in Lyari with an indoor swimming pool, in addition to a house worth 1.1 million dirhams in Dubai, an office in Dubai International City worth 0.5 million dirhams, a bungalow and plot in Muscat worth 0.9 million and 0.6 million dirhams respectively, and a property in Chabahar worth Rs. 10 million. The properties are registered under the names of his close relatives or friends. He also has four bank accounts in Dubai holding over 1 million dirhams, and acres of land in Chakiwara and Hub worth several millions of rupees.

The pre-launch ceremony of the social network website was done at the Pentecost Convention Centre at the Pentecost Students Association (PENSA) conference on 9 January 2016. At the pre-launch ceremony founders got the feedback from randomly selected users before opening up to the world. After initial target of few hundred test users, the website crashed due to the huge interest. Later the issue was fixed by adding space for 2000 more initial users. On 30 August 2016, the social networking company launched a mobile version of their website for Android users in Google Play Store. Shortly after the mobile app launch, it reached over 20,000 users. Eight months after opening access to the public, the platform recorded its first 50,000 users.  Controversies  On 4 January 2016, BBC published a story explaining that Ghana was to get a sin-free alternative to Facebook. LoveRealm's CEO responded by saying that the network was providing a spiritual social network experience for Christians and not to build a salem of righteous people. The platform ensures faith-based content by censoring and removing ‚Äúun-Christian content‚Äù, such as nudity or violence, with its built-in monitoring algorithm blocks.

Blythe Star  Mick Doleman started his occupational life as a maritime worker within the domestic waters of Australia at the age of 16, following his father into the profession. His first post aboard was as a relieving deckboy on the Shell tanker, the Solen. He first came to prominence when, at the age of eighteen, he was a crew member of the Blythe Star which sank while travelling from Hobart to King Island. The resulting search was the most extensive air search ever conducted in Australia at the time, and the vessel could not be located. Doleman was among the seven crew who were found eleven days later on the Tasman Peninsula having escaped to the liferaft when ship suddenly capsized and sank off South West Cape, Tasmania; three lives were lost. He subsequently gave evidence at the Dunphy enquiry into the sinking of the Blythe Star into the ship's master's failure of duty. In 2015, Doleman participated in an ABC radio documentary about the incident and the subsequent rescue, his first public comment since the enquiry. Doleman explained that enquiry led to significant changes in reporting of maritime schedules and mandatory requirements for the carrying of EPIRBs.  Trade unions  He continued a maritime career in domestic and international waters before coming an officer of the Seamen's Union of Australia. In 1984 he was elected as Assistant Victorian Branch Secretary of the Seamen's Union of Australia, and in 1987 he became the branch secretary. During his time with the union he also served as the president of the Victorian Trades Hall Council. From 1997, he moved from the Victorian branch of the union to the national branch, initially as an organiser, then sequentially as assistant, then deputy national president of the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA). One of the major campaigns in which he was involved was the Patrick's waterfront dispute in 1998. Doleman has been a campaigner to prevent men's violence against women, and he was appointed Australia's White Ribbon Ambassador for 2011 in recognition of the impact his advocacy in extending the White Ribbon Campaign into all aspects of the maritime union's activities. This interest sprung from the enquiry into discrimination and gender-based violence within the Australian Defence Force, and that Doleman had ordered an enquiry that showed similar issues that were seen to exist within the merchant navy. In 2014 Doleman resigned as an official of MUA, for in 2015 taking up a position of International Executive Officer with the newly formed Maritime International Federation (MIF), a federation, which currently consists of the Papua New Guinea Maritime and Transport Workers Union, Maritime Union of New Zealand and the Maritime Union of Australia and with interest with some of the other countries of South East Asia. The federation is affiliated with the International Transport Workers‚Äô Federation.

Aryika, also known as Sadhvi, is a female mendicant (nun) in Jainism. In Samavasarana of the Tirthankara, aryikas sit in the third hall.  History  In the traditional Digambara tradition, a male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in the Digambara sect of Jainism. This view is different from the Svetambara sect that believes that women too can achieve liberation from Sa·πÉsƒÅra by being mendicants and through ascetic practices. According to Svetambara Jain texts, from Kalpasutras onwards, Jainism has had more sadhvis than sadhus (female than male mendicants). In Tapa Gacch of the modern era, the ratio of sadhvis to sadhus (nuns to monks) is about 3.5 to 1. This is much higher, and in contrast to the gender ratio historically observed in Buddhism and Hinduism. Traditionally, in contrast to Svetambara, the Digambara sect has had far less sadhvis. In contemporary times, some Digambara organizations include sandhvis, but the ratio of sadhvis to sadhus (nuns to monks) has been about 1 to 3.  Conduct  A Sadhvi, like a Sadhu, enters the mendicant order by making the Five vows: Ahimsa (Non-violence or Non-injury), Satya (Truthfulness), Asteya (Non-stealing), Brahmacharya (Abstinence from sex and sensual pleasures), and Aparigraha (Non-attachment). Describing the conduct of aryikas, Champat Rai Jain in his book, SannyƒÅsa Dharma writes: Jains supporting the spiritual liberation of womankind note that their conduct is inclusive in such a path: \\"It is by way of the Three Jewels that one attains moksa. Nowhere in the Agamas is it stated that women are unable to realise these Three Jewels\\" (the right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct).

By using a Correction Circle the artillery observer is able to report the necessary fire corrections to the unit firing without knowing exactly where the unit is firing from. This is achieved by having the artillery observer report targets' coordinates and azimuth (from his or her own position) to the firing units, then report corrections (both lateral and distance-) in meters after a salvo. Each firing unit would make their own calculations for correction based on their own position, target's position, artillery observer's azimuth as well as lateral- and distance corrections in meters provided by said observer, in theory allowing for an unlimited number of firing units to fire on a single target using the same target coordinates and corrections reported by a single artillery observer. The system can and is also used to quickly switch between targets within the artillery observer's vision by simply reporting sufficiently big corrections. As an example of this in use, during the Battle of Tali-Ihantala Finnish Army had 21 artillery battalions and one heavy battery, a total of 250 guns and mortars, focusing their fire on targets inside an area of 7 square kilometers, considered to be a world record at the time.

The logo for this durrie was registered under application number 512, dated 8 January 2015. Location Navalgund, where the hand-made Navalgund Durries are made, is located within the geographical coordinates of . History Nuvulgund Durrigullu, also known as \\"jumkhaanaa\\"gullu in Kannada language, were initially made by a group of weavers of Bijapur who used to live in the Jumkhaan Gulli during the reign of Ali Adil Shah. As a result of the war between the Adil Shahs and the Vijayanagar empire, the Jumkhaan weavers sought a safe place to pursue their trade, and so migrated to Nuvulgund, initially to trade in pearls but later settled down in the town, established looms and weaved durrigullu. These durrigullu are made exclusively by the women of the community, operating the looms at home. At one time, there were 75 women working on this handicraft, but due to lack of facilities and poor returns, now only some 35 women are engaged in the weaving of the rugs. Traditional Muslim women of the Sheikh Sayeed community had to be confined to their homes, and hence this craft became their exclusive culture and a means at home to make a living. This type of durrie is not made at any other place. The artisans are quite secretive about their art of weaving these durries, and the skill is taught only to their daughters‚Äìin-law (not even to their daughters as after marriage they would go away to another family). Manufacturing details With the legacy of several generations of manufacturing the Navalgund durries, their specifications and procedure of manufacture are well documented. In the process of manufacture the raw cotton is procured by the weavers from the Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation. Cotton 3/10s, an unbleached yarn, is used for the warp and cotton 10s of 6-ply is used for weft. The yarns could also be purchased from the market in Hubli. After procurement of the required material, pre-weaving process is started. This is a four-stage process. The first step being preparation of warp, which is a set of threads which runs through the length of the durries and which is covered by the weft. The decision on the length of the durrie is dictated by the 3/10s cotton converted into balls. While warp of the small durries are made in the open yard of the house, in the case of larger size durries of say size, the warps are made in large open grounds in the town. Then a detailed work procedure is followed with sticks to warp the required number of threads. This warp is then shifted to the loom inside the house and weaving is done in a set pattern using warp beams of the looms, sticks and threads. The yarn of the weft 10s cotton is then dyed with dyes of black, yellow, red, brown, blue and green colours, mixed with water, and the hanks are kept in the dye solution for 20 minutes before removal and drying. The warp is fixed on the loom (which is of vertical design, quite ancient, unlike the horizontal loom used at the ground level at other places in the country) and adequately stretched to obtain the required tension. The weaving is then started by two weavers facing each other. Patterns are introduced in the warp at the appropriate stage of weaving. Vertical and diagonal lines are marked and weaved suitably. Weft is then covered over the warp, and this covering decides the quality of the durries. Weft is layered over the warp and pressed properly by beating and tamping. The cloth beam is used to wind the cloth as the durrie gets made. The designs are decided by the weavers intuitively. The progress achieved on each loom is about . Following completion of the weaving process, the durries are removed from the loom, and the over-hanging threads are all trimmed. Tassels, in the form of knots, are made at the end of the warps. The decorative threads of white and other colours are threaded to the edges. A particular feature of these durries is that no two durries are alike in colour and size. These durries are marketed under three categories as: Jamkhana in sizes of , , and 9 ft; Navagund-ja-Namaz of , which is a prayer mat which is exclusively used by the Muslim community and *which they carry with them) for offering worship in the mosque or at any other place; and Guddar of used as a floor covering and for storing grains, and this type is not manufactured by the Navalgund weavers but by a different set of weavers. Inspection of the durries is carried out by a body of officials from the Development Commissioner (Handicrafts), Director (Market Research) of the Textile Committee of the Ministry of Textiles, and a leading Master Artisan representing the Producer Associations.

Reception The Flute Concerto has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the North American premiere of the piece, Jeremy Eichler of The Boston Globe wrote: Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times similarly lauded the work as \\"rhapsodic and brilliant\\" and wrote, \\"It opens with startling, crisp orchestral chords that prod the flute into scurrying figures, quickly taken up by other instruments. The flute's skittish riffs and winding lyrical lines sometimes ignite agitated orchestral responses; at other times they are cushioned by subdued, sustained harmonies. Even when the music breaks into a jumpy back-and-forth, the mood is industrious, not aggressive.\\" He continued, \\"Mr. Carter's language has lost none of its piercing, atonal bite.

The enhanced clarity is a welcome turn, making it easier to hear Mr. Carter‚Äôs scintillating sonorities, myriad instrumental colors and complex rhythmic interplay.\\" Lisa Hirsch of the San Francisco Classical Voice wrote, \\"About 15 minutes long and for a smallish orchestra that nonetheless includes a colorful percussion section, a harp, and a piano, it‚Äôs a lovely and challenging showpiece for the flutist.\\" References Category:Concertos by Elliott Carter Category:2008 compositions Carter ","title":"Flute Concerto (Carter)"},{"id":"49266811","text":"John Charles George Kevin (9 October 190913 February 1968) was an Australian public servant and diplomat.

The mill was built in 1785 and was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 13 April 1984. The mill is situated in the Marselisborg Forests just south of the suburb Sk√•de and Moesg√•rd Museum, some 6 km. south of Aarhus city center.  History  The mill is mentioned for the first time in 1570. It is situated in the forests south of Aarhus along the Giber √Ö stream which has, in spite of its short length of 12 km., serviced three mills; Rokballe, Fulden, and Moesg√•rd mills. Today only Moesg√•rd Forest Mill survives as a functional mill. For most of its time, the millers on the property were copyholders under Moesg√•rd Manor. The mill had lands attached making it possible to run a small farm along with the mill. The last copyholder on the mill was Frederik Jensen who received royal permission to establish a grain thresher. However, the mill was profitable and Thorkild Christian Dahl of Moesg√•rd wished to run the mill directly under his estate. Frederik Jensen was eventually driven off the land and the mill was henceforth managed directly under Moesg√•rd. The mill was renovated in 1852 and the main building made one floor higher. The last miller was S√∏ren Petersen in 1883‚Äì1922. His son-in-law inherited the mill and turned it into a sawmill. In the late 1800s, the mill became a popular destination for Aarhusians on day trips which it remains to this day. The ground floor of the main building is today a restaurant. The mill was restored in 1991 and is today operated by Moesg√•rd Museum as a museum.  Architecture  The mill appears as it did after the last major changes in 1852. The mill itself is from 1785 although the first floor was added in 1852. The farmhouse was built in 1824. The mill is built on a base of boulders with half-timbered walls and gables. The roof is thatched with straw and the milling equipment is in almost original condition.

A former leader of the Democratic Progressive Party's now-abolished New Tide faction, he has served on the party's Central Standing Committee, the Taipei City Council and the Legislative Yuan. Education Tuan was born in Taipei, graduated from Ta-Chih Junior High School and Chung Kung Senior High School, before attending National Taiwan University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science. Political career Tuan started his political career by working for legislators Lu Hsiu-yi, Hung Chi-chang and Yeh Chu-lan. He was Kao Chih-peng's campaign manager in Kao's 1993 run for Penghu County Magistrate. In 1994, Tuan was elected to the Taipei City Council, and served until 2002. Tuan took office in the Legislative Yuan later that year, and was defeated in his 2005 reelection campaign. He was the chief convener of the New Tide faction, before it was officially dissolved in 2006.

He contested the 2012 legislative elections as a candidate for Taipei's second district, but later withdrew from the district party primary. He won a seat in the Legislative Yuan through the proportional representation ballot. He was also reelected to the CSC. Alt URL Tuan was placed on the proportional representation list again for the 2016 elections, and won an at-large seat. In June, Tuan stated that he would retire from politics at the end of his term in 2020, as he expected reforms he supported over the course of his legislature tenure to have been implemented by that time. Controversy Lien Chan's daughter Lien Hui-hsin sued Tuan for slander in 2004, for alleging that she had helped her father commit tax evasion. Tuan claimed in January 2015 that President Ma Ying-jeou illegally accepted NT$200 million from various businesspeople during his 2008 presidential campaign. Later that month Ma filed a lawsuit against Tuan for NT$10 million. In February 2016, the Taipei District Court ordered Tuan to pay Ma NT$600,000. The penalty was retained in a December 2016 Taiwan High Court ruling. In December 2015, Tuan accused Wang Ju-hsuan of improperly profiting in the real estate market by acquiring multiple properties intended to house military families. Wang sued Tuan for defamation, but the Taipei District Prosecutors‚Äô Office dropped the case, and also found that none of Wang's real estate deals were illegal. Fellow Democratic Progressive Party member and incumbent Hualien City mayor died in May 2016, and the DPP lost the subsequent by-election in August. After the results of the vote were announced, Tuan made Facebook posts that were critical of Hualien voters, for which he apologized. In September, Tuan accused Radio Taiwan International of \\"assisting\\" unification efforts, by renting low-cost airtime to the China-based Guangdong Television.

He completed his undergraduate and master's degrees at Bengbu Medical College, and his Ph.D from Kyushu University. Then he did his postdoctoral research at University of Hawaii and University of California, San Francisco. From 2000 to 2009 he served as a principal investigator in Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was elected a member of CAS in 2007, and of TWAS in 2008. Duan's research interests mainly focuses on synapses and neuron-glia interactions. His group found that when activated by ATP astrocytes can release glutamate through pores formed from P2X7 receptors; neuronal activities can be heterosynaptically suppressed by glia-released ATP and these ATP are released through exocytosis of lysosomes. They also clarified the mechanisms of LTP induced in neuron-glia synapses. Early life and education In 1957 Duan was born to a worker's family. He finished his primary and secondary education at Mengcheng, Anhui. In 1966 when he was a second grade pupil, the Cultural Revolution was launched, the education system of China was heavily disturbed. During this time he read literary books such as The Gadfly, How the Steel Was Tempered, Lu Xun's essays, and popular science works like Hundred Thousand Whys. After a year's learning in high school, he was sent to the countryside to work alongside peasants for two years. In 1977, the National Higher Education Entrance Examination was resumed, Duan was enrolled by Bengbu Medical College, majoring in clinical medicine. He graduated in 1982, and passed an exam to enter Nantong Medical College, pursuing a master's degree.

About Highlights of La Cumbre Plaza are the influence of Santa Barbara's missionary settlers as well as an Arts & Crafts styling. The main breezeway with its water fountains, benches and flowering landscape strive to fit the area's laid back casual lifestyle. La Cumbre Plaza is the exclusive Santa Barbara home to such popular retailers and restaurants as Macy's, Lure Fish House, Panera Bread, Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, J. Jill, Talbots, and Janie & Jack.  History  La Cumbre Plaza opened in 1967 with anchors Sears and J.W. Robinson's. Robinson's changed nameplates several times in its history. It first became Robinsons-May in 1993, then Macy's in 2006 due to the merger of Federated and May Department Stores. The mall was a solidly middle-class shopping center until the mid-2000s when new owner Macerich embarked on a remodel that added upscale retailers including Williams Sonoma, Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton and Ruth's Chris Steak House, although the last three have since closed their locations. The remodel was at the height of the Great Recession, causing several of these new tenants to close only a few years later. Others have thrived since the remodel, with Pottery Barn thriving but the few other tenants being decidedly less luxury oriented. Among the newer tenants are the Word of Life church, Go! Calendars and Barbie's Pet Salon. On November 8, 2018, it was announced that Sears will be closing this location in early 2019 a part of a plan to close 40 stores.

Description Eremophila graciliflora is a shrub which grows to a height of and which has branches which are lumpy due to raised leaf bases and are densely covered with glandular hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and are long, wide, narrow linear to lance-shaped with a few glandular hairs. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a straight, hairy stalk, long. There are 5 small, narrow triangular sepals which are long and hairy on most of both the inner and outer surfaces. The petals are about long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is red and hairy on both the inner and outer surface except that the inside of the tube is glabrous. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the tube. Flowering occurs in September but the fruits have not been observed. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1859 and the description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The type specimen was collected by Augustus Oldfield near the Murchison River close to \\"Yattoo\\". The location \\"Yattoo\\" has not been found.

History The original construction dates from about 1209. The chapel and vestry are Gothic-style and the whole church is built of bricks. The churchyard has the tallest wooden bell tower in Denmark, which dates back to 1650. The church itself is decorated with murals from various periods. Restoration of the church in 1924-27 revealed frescoes from different periods; Romanesque from the beginning of the 13th century, late-Gothic from about 1500 and Renaissance paintings from 1587. The chapel's murals depict the legend of Saint George and the Dragon, and his martyrdom. These pictures, together with the late medieval carved wooden figure of the dragon slayer from app. 1490 formed the setting for the chapel's Saint George cult. In the late 1990s, restoration was done in collaboration with the architects Hans Lund and Alan Havsteen-Mikkelsen (1938‚Äì2002). The altarpiece was made by Dutch artist Anthon G√ºnther Lundt and dating from 1717. The style is Baroque with acanthus foliage. The pulpit is Renaissance from 1591 made at one of the fine local joiner-workshops in Flensburg. The crucifix from approx. 1250 is a mixture type between Late Romanesque and early Gothic. The baptismal font origins from the first building period of the church together with the communion table. The font is composed of two types of granite; a reddish basin upon a greyish foot. Upon the foot are four carved male heads, two with pageboy haircuts and no beard and two with center parting and beard. The lid of the font is a wooden crown from 1787. The baptismal basin is of brass and dates from the same period.

The sugar is added to get the taste and it is then packed and dispatched to the various dairy and milk product centers for sale.Narsobawadi Basundi Narsinhwadi (Narsobachi Wadi) Basundi is an perishable item so needs to be preserved carefully. This item needs to be consumed with in 2‚Äì3 days from the date of manufacturing. Another similar product is Rabri. It is more thick than basundi. Recipe Heavy cream may be added during the boiling process to hasten the thickening process. Once reduced, a little sugar, cardamom, charoli and/or saffron are added. Basundi is preserved well after sugar is added. Sugar develops some acidity over a period of time. If it is excessive then it can curdle the basundi. Some times after adding sugar one cooks it for some more time; this gives a nice pink color to basundi, as sugar is also cooked in milk turning into a light caramel. Before adding sugar, basundi is thick but after adding it becomes again fluid. Stirring well prevents from malai being formed on top and all guests (even late comers) can enjoy equally thick and plain basundi.

The identity of the Invisible Committee has been associated with the Tarnac Nine, a group of people including Julien Coupat who were arrested \\"on the grounds that they were to have participated in the sabotage of overhead electrical lines on France's national railways.\\" Common topics addressed in works by the Invisible Committee include anarchism, anti-capitalism, anti-statism, communism, French culture, global protest movements, and 21st-century civilization. Publications The Invisible Committee have published three books: The Coming Insurrection, To Our Friends, and Now. The original French versions of all three were published by Editions La Fabrique, and English translations of all three were published by Semiotext(e). The latter two books were translated into English by Robert Hurley. Themes Works written by the Committee consistently describe a general disgust with the dominant politics, economies, and societies of early 21st century civilization, which they present as motivating several recent protest movements throughout the world, such as the 2005 French riots and the Arab Spring. In particular, the Committee are harshly critical of capitalism, states, the police, and the world economy, which they generally define as their enemies, and which they argue are the root causes of much of the suffering in the world. In response, they specifically advocate insurrectionary anarchism, or insurrections, possibly (but not necessarily) involving violence, as the best available means to bring about the sort of world in which they would prefer to live: a world populated by communes, based in immediate social ties, and friendship - simpler, more concrete human interactions, as opposed to the more abstract political concepts of citizenship, or a sovereign state. In the service of this political project, the Committee's books are intended both as theoretical speculation, and also as commentaries on recent events from which the author(s) (and readers who are sympathetic to their cause) might develop strategies in order to better effect the project sketched by the Committee. In the course of this, the Committee promote and report on leftist protest movements throughout the world, while also criticizing their strategic shortcomings. On the other hand, the author(s) theorize fragmentation and destitution as anarchistic strategies for achieving their goals. By refusing to organize as well-defined groups, and by refusing as far as is possible to engage with existing opponents on their own terms (the police, landlords, banks, etc) the author(s) hope both to deny their stated enemies a hard target, and also to deny those stated enemies their own dependence upon them. Books by the Committee are also critical of the philosophical view of the self as a singular, distinct category, and also of the concept of human nature. Synopsis of Works The Coming Insurrection The Coming Insurrection is the Invisible Committee's first book. In its original French edition, the book consisted of twelve chapters and a brief afterword. Because the English edition was published after the Tarnac Nine arrests, the English edition included a small foreword and an introduction which both touch on the subject of the arrests, for a total of fifteen parts. The body of the book is divided into two halves. The first half of the book describes and diagnoses a series of dysfunctions in modern capitalist society, in terms of social alienation. Using the nine circles of hell of Dante's Inferno as a metaphor for the various types of social ills which exist in the world, the author(s) describe seven circles (in as many chapters) of areas of society which this alienation negatively affects, including the self, work life, and the natural environment. The author(s) ascribe these alienations and social ills not to specific individuals, or criminals, etc, but to capitalism and states themselves. In response to this state of affairs, the book's second half sketches a plan for revolution, which is based on the formation of communes which will undermine the world's existing governmental, capitalist and police forces by promoting insurrections. With increasingly militant language, the book's second half suggests possibilities for disrupting infrastructure with a view towards disrupting the economy, and also advises armament and the possible necessity for the use of violence by communes and their members, as a means of last resort. For a more detailed synopsis of The Coming Insurrection, see the book's main article. To Our Friends To Our Friends is the Invisible Committee's second book. It consists of eight chapters (subdivided into thirty sections), together with a chapter-length introduction, and a brief afterword. It is dedicated \\"To Billy, Guccio, Alexis, and Jeremy Hammond then,\\", and is prefaced with a quotation: \\"There is no other world. There's just another way to live.‚ÄîJacques Mesrine\\". Hammond is a computer hacker who was convicted and sentenced for his role in the 2011 Stratfor hacking incident.Poulson, Kevin. Wired, November 15, 2013. \\"Anonymous Hacktivist Jeremy Hammond Sentenced to 10 Years in Prison\\" According to the Committee, LulzSec (with Hammond's involvement) were responsible for replacing the front page of private intelligence firm Stratfor's website with \\"scrolling text of The Coming Insurrection in English.\\" Meanwhile, Mesrine is a famous French criminal who had also been mentioned in passing in The Coming Insurrection. A synopsis of the book is given below. =Introduction: The Insurrections Have Come, Finally= Claiming vindication since the publication of The Coming Insurrection, the author(s) declare that insurrections and political instability have reached all parts of the world in the intervening years, particularly in the case of the Arab Spring. Despite this, the author(s) lament that the many and isolated insurrections have not led to comprehensive, international revolution, which they attribute to faults in leftist strategy, and to the high degree of organization of their declared enemies: \\"What characterizes the 1% is that they are organized. They even organize in order to organize the lives of others.\\" As a remedy, the author(s) propose an international conversation, in which the book will be one part: \\"For a discussion to take place, statements need to be offered, this being one.\\" =Merry Crisis and Happy New Fear= 1\\\\. The opening chapter explores the theme of crises in a general way, particularly financial crises such as the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, and the Greek government-debt crisis. The author(s) present a skepticism about the reality of such \\"actual\\" crises, seeing them instead as being intentionally manufactured by elites, as means of social control: \\"The discourse of crisis intervenes as a political method for managing populations.\\" This treatment of crises is distinct from, but related to, classical economic Marxist crises. 2. In addition to financial crises, there are also environmental ones, such as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and fictional ones, like a zombie apocalypse. Here, the author(s) observe fictional crises as elements of the popular imagination, like the above \\"real\\" crises, again as means of control: \\"Maintaining an endless fear to forestall a frightful end.\\" 3. In response to these fearful images of crisis, the author(s) give an optimistic appraisal of the capacity of human beings for spontaneous self-organization, and so call for the rejection of \\"crisis\\" as a thing to fear: \\"Rethinking an idea of revolution capable of interrupting the disastrous course of things is to purge it of every apocalyptic element it has contained up to now.\\" =They Want to Oblige Us to Govern. We Won't Yield to That Pressure.= 1\\\\. The chapter begins with a general illustration of early 21st century global protest movements, or insurrections, which were partially precipitated by the deaths of young people. Alexandros Grigoropoulos' death led to the 2008 Greek riots, Mark Duggan's death led to the 2011 England riots, and Mohamed Bouazizi's death led to the Tunisian revolution. Although specific, secondary grievances in these cases included police brutality and austerity, what is common to such insurrections is a general disgust with the present state of affairs, as typified in one example given by the author(s): \\"The true content of Occupy Wall Street was not the demand, tacked onto the movement a posteriori like a post-it stuck on a hippopotamus, for better wages, decent housing, or a more generous social security, but disgust with the life we're forced to live. Disgust with a life in which we're all alone, alone facing the necessity for each one to make a living, house oneself, feed oneself, realize one's potential, and attend to one's health, by oneself. 2. Building on the above, the author(s) cite other such contemporary insurrections, and begin referring to them generally as movements of the squares, a phrase which they attribute to other Greek protests in Syntagma Square. The author(s) criticize the tendency in these protests towards \\"general assemblies\\" and \\"democratic actions\\", by specifically opposing their preferred method of insurrection (which implies well-placed minority initiative) to democracy throughout the remainder of the chapter. \\"Above all, if there is one thing that has nothing to do with any arithmetical principle of majority, it is insurrections, the victory of which depends on qualitative criteria‚Äîhaving to do with determination, courage, self-confidence, strategic sense, collective energy. If for two whole centuries elections have been the most widely used instrument after the army for suppressing insurrections, it's clearly because the insurgents are never a majority.\\" This same criticism of paralyzing, democratic \\"procedure\\" in protest movements is revisited in the Committee's later book, Now. 3. Democracy and government are held to be merely specific forms of power, and not the inevitable or only ends which power must serve. \\"A king reigns. A general commands. A judge judges. Governing is something different.\\" The author(s) liken these various forms of power to pastoral power, that of a shepherd over his flock, a metaphor which is repeated in Now. 4. In closing, the author(s) sketch the theory of destitution (again more fully developed in Now), which entails rejection of the various categories of life which are held in contempt by the author(s) (capitalism, the police, states, etc), through refusal of engagement in those categories' terms. =Power Is Logistic. Block Everything!= 1\\\\. Although a popular technique of protest is to occupy government centers, real day-to-day power is no longer situated in such places, but instead throughout the mass of a country's infrastructure. 2. Thus, for a revolutionary who seeks to disrupt the present order of things, a clear target is infrastructure, such as bridges, or high- traffic public squares such as Tahrir Square. 3. As illustrations of infrastructure, modern refineries are held to be places where \\"factories\\" ceased to be singular production facilities, and the management of refineries led to a culture of sites where each site is merely a node in a larger infrastructural process. The suggestion, then, is to block infrastructure in order to effect change. 4. For the author(s), it is essential for revolutionaries, who propose to block or destroy infrastructure, to simultaneously learn that same infrastructure's functions for themselves, so as not to be helplessly dependent on the system which they propose to overthrow. =Fuck Off, Google= 1\\\\. As the chapter's title makes obvious, a criticism of Google runs throughout, and is attended by parallel criticisms of other major internet-based businesses, like Amazon, Facebook and Apple Inc.. However, the author(s)' main purpose is to explain current technology in a general way, as it relates to their proposed program of revolution. As one example, Twitter's roots are described in old cellphone apps which protestors used to coordinate during the 2004 Republican National Convention. It is observed that the internet and its various companies and services are supplanting traditional governments in various ways. 2. Technology companies and the big data that they use to monitor behavior are characterized as upsetting \\"the old dualistic Western paradigm where there is the subject and the world, the individual and society\\", and replacing that model with (human) beings who define themselves in terms of their networks and their data. 3. The author(s) assess the modern implications for computer technology in daily life, as it relates to the revolution which they propose. Having painted a grim picture of the ubiquity of large-scale, internet-based companies like Google and Facebook, the author(s) predict that a long-term resentment against \\"screens\\" of all kinds will ultimately result in a rejection of such companies, and their products. 4. Technology in general is reconsidered in terms of the word \\"technique\\", and tracing the roots of related words: humans at all periods of history have had techniques for manipulating the world in the course of all human endeavors: construction, medicine, war, love, and so forth. The real concern of the author(s) is to use a general understanding of technology, and all of its related aspects, for their proposed ends of revolution. Thus the engineer is identified with capitalism (and scorned by the author(s)), while the hacker, with the attendant subversive hacker ethic, is identified as a possible (though suspect) ally of the author(s)' political program. The book's halfway point (which motivates its dedication as explained above) gives an account of an episode which moved the author(s), and had great personal significance for them: \\"A case that strongly affected us. After so many attacks that so many of us applauded, Anonymous/LulzSec hackers found themselves, like Jeremy Hammond, nearly alone facing repression upon getting arrested. On Christmas day, 2011, LulzSec defaced the site of Strafor (sic), a \\"private intelligence\\" multinational. By way of a homepage, there was now the scrolling text of The Coming Insurrection in English, and $700,000 was transferred from the accounts of Stratfor customers to a set of charitable associations‚Äîa Christmas present. And we weren't able to do anything, either before or after their arrest.\\" =Let's Disappear= 1\\\\. The author(s) use the example of recent Greek protests to observe that counter-insurgent efforts, backed by states, companies and so on, have historically been successful in quelling the insurrections which the author(s) promote. The chapter has a martial theme, juxtaposing the author(s)' insurgents against counter-insurgencies. 2. A sharp criticism of pacifism is presented, transitioning from the above modern Greek protests, by pointing out that in ancient Greece, democratic government (and the civil, non-violent discourse which it entailed) existed side-by-side with the constant readiness of the citizens to make war. 3. War transcends all categories of life, and has a central psychological component. The author(s) minimize traditional categories of warfare (land, holding territory, conventional weapons) in favor of a hearts and minds understanding of warfare: if the enemy can be convinced, then conventional tactics of warfare become unnecessary. The author(s) relate this concept to their own concern, by giving various examples of counter-insurgent theories which are meant to undermine their own political project, and which are being encouraged by states as correctives to the actions with which the author(s) are sympathetic. 4. The author(s) caution against aping their own chosen enemies (states, governments, etc), and so becoming symmetrical with them. As counter-examples against symmetry, the author(s) cite the IRA and various Palestinian organizations, the latter being praised exactly for their fragmentation, a theme expanded in the Committee's next book, Now. =Our Only Homeland: Childhood= 1\\\\. In general, the chapter discusses human migration as it relates to states, capitalism, the rural/urban divide, and gentrification. The first section introduces these concepts, and advances the idea that states and capitalists have given up on the romantic notion of \\"uniting\\" humanity in a grand, totalizing society, and instead have resigned themselves to the idea that society must be bifurcated into productive, value- adding sectors (Silicon Valley, yuppies, the urban archipelago), and \\"the rest\\" (rural backwaters, uncooperative places). 2. The next section illustrates the negative effects of gentrification, especially as driven by the internet and modern technology, and intimates preferential treatment for the value-adding desirables. Seattle's local economy is cited as one example: \\"Now that Seattle has been emptied of its poor people in favor of the futuristic employees of Amazon, Microsoft, and Boeing, the time has come to establish free public transportation there. Surely the city won't go on charging those whose whole life is nothing but value production. That would show a lack of gratitude.\\" 3. With reference to the Susa Valley protests and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation as examples of regional insurrections, the author(s) warn against accepting the frame of a \\"global/local\\" divide, given the above. For the author(s), there are instead simply \\"worlds\\", social ties, friendships, enemies, and so forth, an immediate rhetoric which is expanded in Now. =Omnia Sunt Communia= 1\\\\. Building on the examples of Tahrir Square and the Paris Commune, communes are asserted to be thriving in the world, and a desirable mode of social organization. Supporting the line of argument given in the next section, communes are illustrated as oaths among people: \\"What constitutes the commune is the mutual oath sworn by the inhabitants of a city, a town, or a rural area to stand together as a body.\\" 2. The nature of communes is elaborated a bit further, again with reference to global examples. Communes have first of all a social characteristic, immediately informed by their participants, and secondly a physical characteristic, given by the actual spaces which the communes inhabit. 3. Today, \\"official\\" governments and economies theorize general, abstract \\"commons\\" which must be managed: the air, the sea, mental health, etc. These entities also endeavor to manage consumers' co-operatives, communes, and other \\"alternative\\" forms within their own administrations. The author(s) reject such management efforts, as being counter-revolutionary. 4. The experience of being in a commune is pleasurable, and gives meaning to life. Next to this, contemporary life is \\"intolerable\\". =Today Libya, Tomorrow Wall Street= 1\\\\. Following a brief description of the Susa Valley protests in Italy, the author(s) sketch a history of anti-globalization. Although the latter is presented as \\"the last worldwide offensive organized against capital\\", the author(s) judge it to have been ineffectual thus far. Still, they are confident that like-minded people can be found everywhere in the world, with whom to find common cause. 2. Instead of repairing to \\"naming the enemy\\" as a source of unity, the author(s) propose that such like-minded people should find each other, and thus achieve solidarity through social interaction and the forming of ties. The fragmentation of such informal social ties is framed as a positive strength (because such fragmentation makes it more difficult for a government, the police, etc, to identify and attack a single entity), a theme which is central to the Committee's next book, Now. 3. As a ready response for concerns about the fragmentation just described, the chapter illustrates the capacity of revolutionaries to spontaneously self- organize, as in the case of Tahrir Square. 4. In closing, the chapter adominishes revolutionaries to take care of their own power and pay attention to it, such as it is. =Afterword= In a brief afterword, the author(s) regret that they felt it necessary to make the book as long as they did, and promise to remain active. \\"We wished it would be enough to write 'revolution' on a wall for the street to catch fire. But it was necessary to untangle the skein of the present, and in places to settle accounts with ancient falsehoods. In the coming years, we'll be wherever the fires are lit.\\" Now The Invisible Committee's third book, Now, consists of seven chapters. A synopsis of the book is given below. =Tomorrow Is Cancelled= The opening chapter describes a general disgust with social and political life in the mid-2010s, particularly the 2017 French Presidential Election and the 2016 United States Presidential Election. As one positive alternative to the malaise being sketched, the chapter considers that rioting has a positive possibility for the rioters in that the shared experience can create meaningful bonds: \\"Those who dwell on images of violence miss everything that's involved in the fact of taking the risk together of breaking, of tagging, of confronting the cops. One never comes out of one's first riot unchanged. It's this positivity of the riot that the spectators prefer not to see and that frightens them more deeply than the damage, the charges and counter-charges. In the riot there is a production and affirmation of friendships, a focused configuration of the world, clear possibilities of action, means close at hand.\\" Warning against \\"hope\\" as a coping mechanism for delay, the chapter closes with a presentism which explains the book's title: \\"The current disaster is like a monstrous accumulation of all the deferrals of the past, to which are added those of each day and each moment, in a continuous time slide. But life is always decided now, and now, and now. =50 Shades of Breakage= The general theme of fragmentation is explored. As one example, the loi Travail, or El Khomri law, a French employment law which makes it easier for businesses and employers to lay off workers and reduce overtime payments, was protested not by one bloc, but by \\"two minorities, a governmental minority and a minority of demonstrators\\". The topics of fragmentation, the loi Travail, and the protests in response to the latter law are central to the rest of the book. Mesopotamia, birthplace of civilization, is fragmented as a consequence of the Syrian Civil War and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Greece, birthplace of democracy, is held to be undemocratic (and thus fragmented) in the sense that it is obliged to institute austerity at the behest of the European Union: \\"The Greek state is no longer anything more than a conveyor of instructions it has no say in.\\" Even western liberal states are fragmenting, and not even the threat of global warming can produce unity among the human species. French law is also fragmented in the sense that criminal law is divided into \\"a law for 'citizens' and a 'penal law of the enemy'.\\" Despite these negative aspects of fragmentation, the chapter also considers its positive effects. In moving away from unity (in whatever sphere), each fragmented piece regains a certain autonomy and dignity which is not sacrificed to the need to conform: \\"Here is the paradox, then: being constrained to unity undoes us, the lie of social life makes us psychotic, and embracing fragmentation is what allows us to regain a serene presence to the world. There is a certain mental position where this fact ceases to be perceived in a contradictory way. That is where we place ourselves.\\" Beginning in this chapter (and later, in Everyone Hates the Police), the book bears certain similarities to a work by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. Omnes et Singulatim: Towards a Criticism of Political Reason is the name for a pair of lectures which were given by Foucault at Stanford in October 1979, and which were subsequently transcribed and published in book form. In the lectures, Foucault presented a historical notion of pastoral power in which a leader and his followers (a king and his subjects, a deity and its adherents, etc) are compared with a shepherd and his flock.; the criteria for a good leader, then, are much the same as those for a good shepherd: the good shepherd protects his flock, leads it to better pastures when he deems it appropriate, and so on. Likewise, 50 Nuances of Breakage cites \\"pastoral power\\" while discussing the fragmentation of Iraq and Syria, and the historical importance of the region to civilization itself: \\"Writing, accounting, history, royal justice, parliament, integrated farming, science, measurement, political religion, palace intrigues and pastoral power - this whole way of claiming to govern 'for the good of the subjects,' for the sake of the flock and its well-being - everything that can be lumped into what we still call 'civilization' was already, three thousand years before Jesus Christ, the distinguishing mark of the kingdoms of Akkad and Sumer.\\" The title of the chapter, like the book's other chapters, is taken from anti-capitalist graffiti, in this case reading '50 Nuances de Bris,' a pun on the French title of the best-selling romance novel 'Fifty Shades of Grey' (Cinquante nuances de Grey). =Death to Politics= Following a general criticism of the \\"court culture\\" and proceduralism of French political life, the chapter describes the Nuit debout, a protest movement organized in opposition to the loi Travail. The Nuit debout protests are criticized as having degenerated into empty soapboxing and impotent committees: \\"a bureaucracy of the microphone\\" - very much like the proceduralism just described. The author(s) specify that they had previously anticipated this sort of ineffective protest bureaucracy: \\"This might seem dreadful, but Nuit debout, nearly everywhere in France, illustrated line by line what was said about the \\"movement of the squares\\" in To Our Friends, and was judged to be so scandalous by many militants at the moment of its publication.\\" On the other hand, politics is not a separate category of life, but a process which emerges through exchange and especially conflict - exactly through the fragmentation that was developed in the previous chapter. The chapter closes with an optimistic suggestion that a certain fragmentation of politics - into individual lived experiences and conflicts - would be preferable to the paralyzed politics (which attempt unity by excluding none) sketched in the chapter's first part. =Let's Destitute the World= Institutions in general, and particularly the French cultural trust in institutions, are sharply criticized: \\"Voil√†, we are in France, the country where even the Revolution has become an institution.\\" Institutions are explained as deriving from classical Western traditions (Ancient Rome, Christianity, the Church, Calvin), and the logic of the institution is sketched as giving rise, in large part, to all of the above circumstances which have been lamented by the author(s). As an antidote, the author(s) propose destitution, or destituent action, which is a logical conclusion of the emphasis on fragmentation: \\"The notion of destitution is necessary in order to free the revolutionary imaginary of all the old constituent fantasies that weigh it down, of the whole deceptive legacy of the French Revolution.\\" Destitution implies both a resistance to institutions, and particularly the practice of techniques which render it unnecessary to engage with the institution at all: \\"To destitute is not primarily to attack the institution, but to attack the need we have of it.\\" The May 1968 events in France are cited as one good example of destituent insurrection, and destitution as a strategy is accorded a deeply subversive (and therefore useful) character. =End of Work, Magical Life= Due to increased automation, it is theorized that a large portion of the economy will be replaced with basic income. But even if paid work is reduced, the author(s) suggest it will remain necessary for the population to be controlled in new and other ways, apart from the historical need to work in order to earn a living. In particular, surveillance technology has rapidly improved, and a bleak future in which the individual will be obliged to be a \\"needy opportunist\\" (via vehicles such as Uber and Airbnb), always hustling for a little more money, is sketched. This same \\"needy opportunism\\" is also used to criticize the self-branding which individuals are already conditioned to perform, using social media. For the author(s), the official economy is the enemy which should be destituted (and fragmented) per the above. =Everyone Hates the Police= When society must constantly be ordered, forcibly - as through daily police action - then society has lost its way. According to the author(s), the police, like the military, realize themselves to be a halfway-hated muscle which is the only thing keeping the state (which is completely hated) from being destroyed. Again, the chapter closes by presenting the positive possibilities of fragmentation: in opposition to the police, revolutionaries need not be unified or predictable, and thus are freer to execute whatever plans they wish. Again, this chapter has a similarity to Foucault's Omnes et Singulatim. Later in Foucault's lectures, he examines the history of the police as it relates to politics and states. In the course of this, he cites a number of European thinkers who present various idealized conceptions of the areas of responsibility of the police in a society, including \\"Louis Turquet de Mayerne\\", \\"N. de Lamare\\", and \\"Huhenthal.\\"The Chomsky/Foucault Debate on Human Nature, pp. 198-207. Everyone Hates the Police also has occasion to sketch the history of the police, before the latter had completely transformed into the thing which the author(s) hold in contempt. In so doing, all three of the individuals just mentioned in Foucault's lecture are cited, again: \\"During the 17th and 18th centuries, 'police' still had a very broad meaning: thus la police was 'everything that can give an adornment, a form, and a splendor to the city' (Turquet de Mayerne), 'all the means that are useful to the splendor of the whole State and to the happiness of all the citizens' (Hohenthal). Its role was said to be that of 'leading man to the most perfect felicity he can enjoy in this life.' (Delamare).\\" =For the Ones to Come= The closing chapter describes a deep skepticism for easy solutions to the problems which have been identified by the author(s). Throughout the book, the word communism and its variants have been sparingly used (in the way of foreshadowing), and are now returned to their simpler meanings, apart from the historical baggage of the political program bearing the name: community, interaction with others, and even love. The author(s) indicate a false dichotomy between the self and society, which they assign as having informed classical Marxism and conventional \\"communism\\", alongside modern society in general, to tragic results. This \\"other\\", unofficial communism is what the author(s) suggest as a better organization for society, notwithstanding the earlier skepticism about solutions. Pushing further, the self is not unitary, but a collection of fragments. Ties and connections between fragmented individuals are what are essential to society. For the author(s), their version of communism is what should be pursued: \\"Communism is not a 'superior economic organization of society' but the destitution of economy.\\" Finally, a passage gives a clue as to the number of persons who may be members of the Invisible Committee, and their specific involvement with the production of the texts: \\"There is never community as an entity, but always as an experience of continuity between beings and with the world. In love, in friendship, we have the experience of that continuity. In this print shop dominated by an antique Heidelberg 4 Color which a friend ministers to while I prepare the pages, another friend glues, and a third one trims, to put together this little samizdat that we've all conceived, in this fervor and enthusiasm, I experience that continuity.\\" See also * The Coming Insurrection * Julien Coupat * Insurrectionary anarchism * Situationist International * Tarnac Nine * Tiqqun Bibliography * * * References External links * The Coming Insurrection - English web copy, including post-Tarnac arrest front matter * The Coming Insurrection - another English web copy, not including post-Tarnac arrest front matter * To Our Friends - English web copy * Now - English web copy * The Invisible Committee on Bookogs - Bibliography.

Two thirds of the vessel's cost was paid through a Port security grant from FEMA, a sub-agency of the Department of Homeland Security. She replaced a used vessel acquired from the Los Angeles Fire Department in 2003. Operational history On October 12, 2008, nearby Angel Island, a state park, was struck by serious brush fires. Fireboat Tiburon was one of the nearby fireboats which helped bring those fires under control. Fireboat Tiburon has rescued recreational boaters when their vessels were ablaze, helped fight those fires, and helped prevent the burning vessels from alighting vessels moored nearby. On April 20, 2019, the Tiburon, and several other fireboats, engaged in a search for kayakers whose craft capsized. The kayakers were ultimately rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter, two hours after the boaters phoned 911. Design Fireboat Tiburon, like other fireboats purchased with the help of a port security grant, has first aid facilities, has sensors for search and rescue. The vessel is a catamaran, with a 22 inch draft, and twin diesels engines power waterjets, not propellers, allowing her to be able to risk getting close to shore, without damage. {  + specifications -  length  -  beam  -  displacement  -  speed  -  range  -  power  2 x -  pumping capacity  750 gallons per minute - - }  References  Category:Fireboats of California ","title":"Fireboat Tiburon"},{"id":"49267326","text":"Cherrelle Garrett (born May 7, 1989) is an American bobsledder.

He was born in the state of Kentucky and moved from that state to California in 1849. In Sierra County, Proctor worked as a lawyer and as the assessor of Sierra County. In 1858, he moved with a group of four members from Downieville to Eagle Valley in the area that is now known as Nevada. When they arrived, three members of the group, Curry, Musser, and Proctor, bought the Eagle Ranch for $1,000 and a down payment of $300. The ranch was situated on the current location of Carson City and thus the group founded Carson City with Proctor as a co-founder. In 1864, he claimed to have named the city, but Abraham Curry is generally given credit for that. Proctor owned one-third of the Eagle Ranch, but gave half of it to Benjamin F. Green, who was the fourth member of the group. In 1859, Proctor was vice-president of a constitutional convention, that had as objective to create Nevada Territory. During the convention, Proctor represented Humboldt County. After Nevada became a territory, he filed his candidacy to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the territory, but he lost. Proctor was a member of the 1864 Nevada Constitutional Convention, that started on July 4 and produced an approved constitution. He was elected member with 118 votes. Proctor was one of the two members representing Nye County and he was the only Democrat at the Convention; all others were Unionists. Records from the Convention stated that Proctor was married. He was elected senator of Nye County in the Nevada Senate on November 8, 1864 and his term began the following day. He served in three regular sessions and one special session. In the first and second regular session, he was the only Democratic member of the Nevada Senate. Proctor advocated states' rights and legislation to extend suffrage to women and to make it possible for women to hold public office. His term ended in 1868 and he was succeeded by Robert Mullen. During the 1860s or 1870s, he moved to another state and he died in 1892. East and West Proctor Street in Carson City were named after Proctor and in 1995 he was inducted by a senate resolution into the Senate Hall of Fame of Nevada.

The academic session of IIIT Una started from its temporary campus at National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur from year 2014. IIIT Una is a joint venture of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, the Govt. of Himachal Pradesh, with Industries in Public-Private Partnership model. The industries are H.P. Power Corporation and H.P. Power Transmission Corporation. History On 18 March 2013, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India introduced a bill in the Parliament to establish 20 new Indian Institute of Information Technology's in different parts of the country. As per the bill, MHRD established 20 new IIITs under the Public- Private Partnership (PPP) mode partnering with respective state governments and industry partners. IIITU started to intake students from the academic year 2014‚Äì15, offering Computer Science and Engineering and Electronics and Communication Engineering to the incoming students, functioning in the campus of NIT Hamirpur, with NIT Hamirpur acting as their mentor institute. At the start of the academic year 2017‚Äì18, Information Technology branch was also started in the institute. On 9 August 2017, The Indian Institutes of Information Technology (Public-Private Partnership) Act, 2017 was passed, following which IIITU along with other newly established IIITs, was conferred the status of an Institute of National Importance. The bill, was passed, aiming to generate highly competent manpower of global standards for the Information Technology Industry, expected to act as a major catalyst to develop new knowledge in the field of Information Technology. On 3 October 2017, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of IIITU. On 5 July 2018, Prof. Subramaniam Selvakumar was appointed by the MHRD as the full-time director of the institute, thus making IIITU not requiring any further mentoring from NIT Hamirpur. In March 2019, IIITU and IIT Ropar signed an MoU at Hamirpur, with an aim of developing the fraternity between IIITU and IIT Ropar. The MoU would allow IIITU to have access to various labs and advance research facilities and allow the institutes in joint research collaborative projects. Prof. Vinod Yadava, Director NIT Hamirpur also inaugurated the websites of the 10 student associations which included FORCE (CSE), Aavesh (ECE), Amogh (Magazine), etc. On 29 March 2019, IIITU held its first-ever convocation for the students of batch 2014‚Äì18, on the same day IIITU signed an MoU with IIT Mandi, through which Prof. Timothy A. Gonsalves, Director IIT Mandi, agreed in assisting IIITU in developing courses based practicum components of the IIT Mandi curriculum. Before the academic year 2019‚Äì20, NIT Hamirpur expressed its inability in accommodating IIIT Una students in its campus, thus for want of hostel accommodation for the new incoming students, a need of a second campus was expressed by the administration. By the start of the academic year 2019‚Äì20, IIITU started its second temporary campus (TC-II) in Chandpur, Haroli, Una, where all the new incoming students were accommodated. At the same time the students of II, III and IV year had their classes conducted in the temporary campus in NIT Hamirpur (TC-I). Admissions The admission to IIIT is through Josaa and Central Seat allocation Board (CSAB). The students are allotted admission by Josaa based on their Joint Entrance Examination (JEE-Main) ranks. The Indian Institute of Information Technology, Una is listed in the CSAB website under List of participating institutes.

It is held in conjunction with the Tour Down Under. From 2016, it was rated as UCI 2.2, and from 2018 as UCI 2.1. From 2020 it forms part of the Women's UCI ProSeries.  History  Women's racing at the Tour Down Under began in 2011 as a series of exhibition criterium races and eventually formed part of the women's National Road Series (2015), with these races variously operating under guises deriving from the parent event's name. In 2016, organisers developed a new UCI-classified event that carried the 'Women's Tour' name, and was ranked as a new UCI 2.2. stage race with international teams invited to compete. The event considers the 'Women's Tour Down Under' as having started in 2016. Originally called the 'Santos Women's Tour' the first race was won by former Australian Champion Katrin Garfoot. The three subsequent races have been won by Amanda Spratt, and in 2020 Ruth Winder became the first non-Australian and non Mitchelton‚ÄìScott (women's team) rider to win the event. From 2018, the race leaders and overall winner are awarded an Ochre Jersey as has been the tradition in the men's event since 2006.

Funeral of Stephanie Rader at Arlington National Cemetery (June 2016) She was born to Polish immigrants in Toledo, Ohio, and was raised only knowing the Polish language and culture. As she did not speak English well, she had some difficulties at school at first, but eventually earned a full scholarship to Cornell University where she completed a chemistry degree in 1937. Rader joined the Women‚Äôs Army Corps towards the end of World War II and was soon selected for service in the Office of Strategic Services due to her knowledge of Polish culture. She was one of two OSS agents working out of the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw and traveled the country under the guise of finding family members in the aftermath of World War II. This allowed her to acquire intelligence on Russian troop movements and socio- economic information unobtainable by Embassy officials. She was, by all definitions, a spy. She knew that if she were captured, she would disappear. \\"They gave me a gun, but I never carried a gun ... What the heck was I gonna do with a dumb gun?\\", she said. Rader died in 2016 at the age of 100 in her Alexandria, Virginia, home. Only very late in her life did her friends and neighbors realize that she was one of the most successful intelligence agents of post-war Poland. In the years shortly before her death, her friends and neighbors, together with the Office of Strategic Services Society, championed on her behalf for her to be awarded the Legion of Merit. Her superior officers had recommended her for this award in 1946 but the request was turned down by the War Department for unknown reasons.Profile, thedailybeast.com, December 27, 2015.

Prosper Merimee wrote a number of bizarre, macabre stories, of which Lokis is one. He was also the author of La Venus d'Ille which Italian horror director Mario Bava adapted to film in 1978. The Russian silent film with its lycanthropic theme predates Universal's later werewolf films, such as The Werewolf of London (1935) and The Wolf Man (1941). But with prints of this film almost impossible to view (although it is said to still exist in a couple of archives), it's difficult to determine if the \\"man-into-beast\\" scenes of the film refers to a literal shapeshifter, or if it's just a psychological condition that affects the main character's mind.

Plot When a pregnant Russian countess is frightened by a bear, she later gives birth to a male child who acts in some ways like an animal. As the boys matures, he takes to stalking young women in the forest while wearing the skin of a bear. When he becomes an adult, the boy marries a young girl and appears to be normal. But on their honeymoon, he turns into a bear and murders his wife, drinking her blood. But it's not clear whether the transformation is real, or if the young man just believes he is a bear and is acting like one. Cast * Konstantin Eggert * Vera Malinovskaya as Yulka * B.

She came to native attention when entering the Romanian preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 with her song \\"DacƒÉ tu iube≈üti\\", where she finished in 10th place, scoring 3 points. Moldovan has won the most awards at inter-county and national festivals of light music in Romania, holding a national record of 75 awards in 103 appearances, confirmed by Radio Rom√¢nia ActualitƒÉ»õi in 1998 by Andrei Titus. Early life Moldovan was born as a male on April 25, 1977 in Sighi≈üoara, Romania and grew up in an orphanage located in Ludu»ô until he was 15 years old, where he also graduated from secondary study. Moldovan is a gypsy. 3 days after his birth, he was abandoned in a groove. He showed special interest in music from a very young age. Subsequently, he moved away from Ludu»ô to Targu Mures and participated in a preselection enrollment for the Scoala Populara De Arta school in the singing section, where he passed the practical exam with the grade 10. Following this, he studied at that school for two consecutive years. In 1992, Moldovan moved to Bucharest, where he attended the Scoli Populare de Arta school (light music singing section) and the Palatul National Al Copiilor school. Years later, Moldovan started to occur as a woman, with him also stating that although born man, he felt completely woman from a very young age. He had homosexual relationships starting with the age of 14. Moldovan changed his stage name to simply Naomi, following Loredana Groza's and Mircea Zara's suggest to do so. Career 2008‚Äìpresent: Career beginnings In 2008, Naomi participated at the Mamaia Music Festival with the song \\"Salcia\\", written by Ionel Tudor, and her band, Naomi International, with which she also released a jazz album in the autumn of that year. Later in 2008, she received an award for promoting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender culture. In 2014, Moldovan attended the Romanian preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 with her song, \\"DacƒÉ tu iube≈üti\\", which was written by Rare≈ü Borcea and composed by Jimi Laco. The track placed in 10th place out of 12, scoring 3 points. The next year, she aroused controversy by not passing the national preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015, reportedly because frequent collaborator MƒÉdƒÉlin Voicu was unlike last year not part of the preselection's jury. In late 2015, Moldovan announced through her Facebook account that she would send two tracks she already finished, \\"What's Going On\\" and \\"SƒÉ-»õi spun ce simt pentru noi\\", to the Italian, Swiss, Norwegian and Swedish preselection shows for the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. \\"SƒÉ-»õi spun ce simt pentru noi\\" was written by Moldovan herself, while production was handled by Marius Constantin. Personal life Moldovan currently lives in Olten, Switzerland where she works at a night club and gets paid 2.000 CHF per month. She has a dog named Baby and uses female pronouns to describe herself. She has won the most awards at inter-county and national festivals of light music in Romania, holding a national record of 75 awards in 103 appearances, confirmed by Radio Rom√¢nia ActualitƒÉ»õi in 1998 by Andrei Titus. Moldovan possesses a soprano vocal range. In February 2015, Moldovan attempted suicide by swallowing painkiller pills. Shortly after the incident, she expressed when interviewed by Romanian newspaper Cancan that \\"[she] cried all night and [she] could not sleep at all. [She] was like a small child. Alone, it was hard to manage [her] emotions and grief, so [she] swallowed painkiller pills. [She is] lucky to still be alive. [She knows she] could die last night. [She is] very confused. If power will still remain, [she will] decide these days if [she] would finish with [her] life, so no one can further judge [her], or if [she] would continue [her] life and accept all the critics.\\" Public image In her native Romania, Moldovan rose to prominence through supporting the gay community and having numerous TV and press appearances. She is a character frequently parodied during the Romanian comedy show \\"Mondenii\\". Moldovan aroused controversy for her televised fights with Adriana Bahmu»õeanu and Nikita at the beginning of her career.

At the end of 1902 he moved to Munich where for a couple of weeks he attended the school of Anton A≈æbe. In 1903, he moved to Paris, where he lived in La Ruche from 1905-1907.Warnod, Andr√©. De la Ruche √† Java‚Ä¶ et retour. In: Comoedia, 28.11.1931, p.3 (in French) In Paris, he admired the art of Puvis de Chavannes, and many notable early works of Genin (until 1914) bear his influence. In 1907, Genin returned to Munich and began to work for the magazine Jugend, where 40 of his illustrations were published. In 1912, he became one of the founding members of the artists group Sema, and in 1913 became a member of the M√ºnchener neue Secession. The outbreak of the First World War (1914-1918) was a disastrous turn for this rise in the German art scene, and during the war Genin was interned in Munich as citizen of a hostile state. After the war he moved to Berlin. In 1919, Genin has acquired a small house in the fishering village of Ascona in Switzerland, where he subsequently spent several months each year. Over the period of 1915-1926, the Genin's styles of painting and drawing developed in line with the direction of German expressionism. In 1926, Genin undertook a voyage to the island of Bali, which provided important impulse to his work.Rodionov, Alexej. Robert Genin. Auf der Suche nach dem Paradies: Bali, 1926. St-Petersburg, 2013, 96 S. (in German) Genin wrote and illustrated a book about his impressions, which was published 1928.Genin, Robert. Die ferne Insel. Aufzeichnungen von meiner Fahrt nach Bali in Wort und Bild. Verlag des Volksverbandes der B√ºcherfreunde, 1928, Berlin. (in German) In 1929, Genin moved to Paris. There, his artistic style developed further under the influence of Fauvism and Neo-primitivism. In 1936, Genin finally returned to the USSR, with the intention of taking an active part in building up the new socialist society by painting frescos on the walls of Moscow's new buildings. In March of that year, while Genin was already in Moscow, his first (and the last) American exhibition was held in NYC at Lilienfeld Galleries.NN. \\"An artist who was born in Russia...\\" In: Brooklyn Daily Eagle, NYC, 29 March 1936, p. 34 In Moscow, his first major commission was a fresco for one of the pavilions at the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV). However, in October 1938, the fresco has been covered up, in line with the political processes which had gained strength in the USSR. His second major commission in Moscow was frescoes for the Palace of Soviets, a commission which was terminated by the outbreak of the Second World War. Genin has committed suicide in August 1941, a few days after a devastating air raid by German bombers.  Monograph and catalogue-raisonn√©  During his life, Genin did not take care of his works, their integrity and preservation. Some of them he destroyed by his own hands, and many were lost during the Second World War. During the Nazi era in Germany, some of his works were removed from museums along with other so called degenerate art, and others belonging to Jewish art collectors were confiscated. Those works which survived after Second World War are widely spread. Information about them is being collected by Friends club of Robert Genin with the aim of publishing the monograph and the catalogue-raisonn√©.

The war started when the new landowners tried to remove the local settlers from the land they had just bought. The locals refused to leave, as they had settled much of their livelihood in the grant, which resulted in conflict and violence in 1875. Background The disputed territory began as a land grant from the Mexican provincial governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico to Charles H. Beaubien and Guadalupe Miranda in 1841, which included large portions of what is now Colfax County in northern New Mexico and Las Animas County in southern Colorado. In 1849, after the region was ceded to the United States at the end of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, an American pioneer named Lucien B. Maxwell moved to the area, married Beaubien's daughter, and became a part owner and manager of the vast land grant. Over the following decades, many more pioneer families arrived in the area, which was conveniently situated along branches of the Santa Fe Trail. Maxwell was very lenient to visiting settlers, allowing pioneers to settle and ranch on land within the grant, letting Ute and Jicarilla Indians to hunt game in the area, and even leasing claims on minerals to miners.Maxwell Land Grant by William H. Wroth In 1870, Maxwell sold the grant to a group of English financiers for a reported price of $1.35 million. The new owners formed the Maxwell Land Grant and Railway Company. Their arrival and purchase of the land immediately spurred controversy among the people already living in the area, and animosity quickly developed between the two sides. Property developers working for the company complained that miners and farmers, who they believed were squatters, were disturbing and even harassing their work, presenting various obstacles to the company's production. Many of these settlers were white, Spanish and Native American people who believed that the land was in the public domain or felt that they had been given Maxwell's unwritten permission to live on the grant. War A large meeting between the settlers occurred on March 30, 1873, in which they agreed to arm themselves to protect their homes and property if necessary.Montoya, Maria E. Translating Property: The Maxwell Land Grant and the Conflict over Land in the American West, 1840-1900. University of California Press (March 29, 2002). pp. 107‚Äì113. ASIN B003AU4HFQ. The event that triggered much of the war, was the murder of Reverend Franklin J. Tolby, a staunch ally of the settlers and squatters opposing the Maxwell Land Grant Company. He was found murdered in Cimarron Canyon on September 14, 1875. It was quickly assumed that someone from the company was responsible, and the blame was pinned on a gunman named Cruz Vega. Vega and his family were originally sided with the Hispanic settlers in the area, and his uncle, Francisco Griego, was one of the leaders among the Hispanic people during the conflict. However, they soon shifted sides when Griego and his family were faced with charges of killing three cavalry men in an altercation in a card game, and also implicated in the suspected murder of another soldier on June 1. The Santa Fe Ring was said to have blackmailed Griego and his family in exchange for dropping the charges the family would have faced.THE THIRD FORT UNION: CONSTRUCTION AND MILITARY OPERATIONS, PART TWO (1869-1891Frank Springer and New Mexico With his family's reputation of violence and betrayal, Vega was an easy prime suspect and soon the townspeople, led by notorious gunfighter and advocate of the settlers Robert Clay Allison, formed a mob to hunt him down. After apprehending Cruz Vega, they tortured and hanged him by a pole. The Vega family mourned Cruz's death, and his uncle Francisco swore to avenge him by killing Allison. On November 1, Griego managed to trap and confront Allison in the saloon of the St. James Hotel. As Griego drew his pistol, Allison drew faster and shot Griego twice in the chest, killing him. Days later, Allison was charged with the murder but after an inquiry, the charge was dropped and the shooting was ruled as self-defense. Allison had also killed another gunman by the name of Chunk Colbert in Colfax County the previous year.Chunk Colbert Company gang members retaliated by conducting night-time raids on the settlers, destroying their property as well as murdering those who fought back. Because of the presence of a large lawless element at Cimarron and the inability of local authorities to keep the peace, the attorney general of the New Mexico Territory, under directions from Governor Marsh Giddings, requested federal troops from Fort Union to help Sheriff Isaiah Rinehart restore order at Cimarron. No troops were sent at that time, but troubles continued at Cimarron that eventually required military intervention. The Maxwell Land Grant and Railway Company was also allied with the powerful Santa Fe Ring, a group of influential lawyers and politicians who controlled many Western states. The settlers did not like the incursion of the soldiers on to the land, and this caused a great deal of violence between the factions. Buffalo soldiers of the 9th U.S. Cavalry were among the units sent, and on one occasion, some of them had a shootout with a group of Texas cowboys in the St. James Hotel. Three soldiers died during the shootout and a few months later one of the cowboys Davy Crockett who was involved was killed by the local sheriffs. Clay Allison himself shot and killed a black sergeant in a bar where he was drinking.Durnham, Philip. The Negro Cowboys. University of Nebraska Press (October 1, 1983). p. 102. A man named Cardenas eventually confessed to the murder of Tolby, and he was subsequently hanged by a group of 20 gunmen on November 10. It has been estimated that as many as 200 people were killed in the Colfax County War. Soon the conflict started to dwindle down between the leaders of each party. Clay Allison was arrested in late 1876 by posse consisting of a sheriff, a captain and lieutenant with 45 U.S. cavalrymen. He later left the county in December of that year.Clay Allison: Good-Natured Holy Terror The English owners of the Maxwell Land Grant Company foreclosed on the land by 1879, and the company was purchased by new owners from the Netherlands. Finally, in 1885, the lawn of the Colfax County Courthouse was the site of one of the last gun battles of the Colfax County War. A group led by George Curry was assaulted by a group of sheriff's deputies on the courthouse lawn. Curry's brother and one of his followers were killed in the gun battle. Curry pleaded guilty to unlawfully carrying firearms and was fined five dollars. The Dutch owners also faced financial instability and were sued by the United States government in the early 1880s for making claims on land within the public domain in Colorado. On March 8, 1887, the company finally sent its plea to the United States Supreme Court. In its ruling five weeks later, the court confirmed the company's ownership of the land when it concluded ‚ÄúWe are entirely satisfied that the Grant, as confirmed by the action of Congress, is a valid grant, that the survey and the patent issued upon it are entirely free from any fraud.‚Äù Some of the settlers left the land after but many manage to settle with the company by selling their property, although some were still being evicted as late as 1894. Two years after Reverend Tolby's murder, the conflict calmed down between some of the settlers who remained and the land owners who won over the property. One of the last victims of the war, Richard Russell, was killed in a shootout with company enforcers near his ranch in Stonewall, Colorado, in 1888. Popular culture * The 2005 game Gun had a character named Clay Allison who was also leading a resistance similar to that of the Colfax County War.ACTIVISION PULLS THE TRIGGER ON ITS HIGHLY ANTICIPATED ACTION GAME GUN(TM) References Category:1870s in New Mexico Territory Category:Pre-statehood history of New Mexico Category:Conflicts in 1875 Category:Internal wars of the United States Category:Range wars and feuds of the American Old West ","title":"Colfax County War"},{"id":"49267829","text":"Ralf Pittelkow (born 9 April 1948 in S√∏nderborg, Denmark) is a frequent commentator in both radio and television.

In 2014, an article published by the Danish Union of Journalists said that Den Korte Avis damaged the reputation of journalists and argued that it, despite its name (in English: \\"The Short Newspaper\\"), was not a real newspaper, as it often copied from other sources and misrepresented news stories. In December 2016, numerous advertisers, such as McDonald's, IKEA, Nordea, Alm. Brand, Doctors Without Borders and others, pulled their ads from the site, due to claims that several of the news stories publicized on the site were \\"lies and fabrications\\".

A native to the tropics, it is registered (on Application No. 229) under the Geographical Indications (GI) of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act by Government of India. Kewda scent is produced in Chhatrapur, Brahmapur, Gopalpur and Jagannathpur in district of Ganjam, Odisha. Although kewda plants can be found through most of India, 90% of the commercial production of the kewda flower is estimated to occur in the Odisha state. The flower of the kewda plant grows on a small tree or shrub; it is both cultivated and grows wild in coastal areas. The plant can also be found in some inland districts but the flowers seem to create their most exquisite floral bouquet in certain coastal localities, the most famous being the Ganjam district of Odisha. The tree can reach a height of 18 feet, with dense branches supported by aerial roots that can form a thick, almost impenetrable jungle. The long leaves possess prickly spines along the edges and mid-ribs making the plant tough to handle for those not familiar with the handling and harvesting techniques. The male flower \\"spikes\\" (or inflorescence) are 10-20 inches long. Along the central stalk of each spike one can find many flowers, each encased in a fragrant cream-colored spathe (a spathe is a protective leaf enclosing a flower). A fully mature kewda tree produces about 30 to 40 flower spikes each year weighing 5 to 6 each ounces each. Usage Kewra is used to flavor foods and for Ayurveda healing. The kewra plant grows wild along the east coast of India. The plants many think that create the best floral bouquet are grown in Ganjam district of South Odisha. Rampe plant (Pandanus amaryllifolius Roxb) is different from Kewra plant. The fragrant leaves of Rampe plant (Pandan Patta) are used to flavor rice and curries. Types Kewra plant is dioecious, with male and female flowers produced on different plants. In Sanskrit, the plant is called Ketaki. The male plants are called 'Ketaki Viphala', and the female plants and called 'Swarana Ketaki'. The male plant - flower Only the flowers of the male plant are harvested to extract the floral bouquet to produce kewra. The flower's bouquet is sweet, similar to rose flowers, with also some fruity notes. The plants flower three times a year (Summer, Monsoon, and Winter). A majority of the flowers that provide the best floral bouquet grow during monsoon season (July‚ÄìSeptember). Some 30% of the flowers grow during summer (May‚ÄìJune), and remaining 10% grow during winter (October‚ÄìNovember). The creamy white color flowers are encased in long spikes about one foot long. On average, one mature plant can produce about 35 flower spikes, each weighing about 5 to 6 ounces. The female plant - flower The flower of female plant has no floral bouquet. It is left to develop into fruit. Kewra Flower's extracts The kewda flowers extracts sold in the market are: Kewra Ruh (Oil) This is 100% pure oil extracted from male kewra flowers. It takes about 1,000 flowers (370 pounds) to produce one ounce of Kewra Ruh. In Ayurveda, the oil is used as a stimulant, and to treat rheumatoid arthritis Kewra Attar (Perfume) The Kewra flowers are distillated into sandalwood oil. Kewra Attar has about 3% to 5% Kewra oil, and the remainder is Sandalwood oil. Normally, it is specified in terms of number of flower spikes (10,000 to 15,000) per pound of sandalwood oil, This is the most popular perfume used in India. It is applied behind ears, and used to scent clothes. The perfume is also added to various cosmetics. Kewra Jal (Hydrosol) The fragrant hydrosol (distillate of an essential oil) may be either a primary product from low quality flowers collected during hot summer, or it may be a secondary product from Kewra Ruh or Attar production. Kewra Jal is also called Kewra water. Kewra Jal is about 0.02% of Kewra oil. 24 flowers can produce one pound of primary hydrosol. The hydrosol is used to flavor popular sweets such as Rasgulla, Rasmalai, and Ghulab Jamun. It is used to flavor rice dishes such as biryanis. Kewda Industry in Ganjam The kewda flower and its rhu, produced after processing the flowers, is also unique to the region. The flower grows in at least four coastal blocks of the district - Chhatrapur, Rangeilunda, Ganjam and Chikiti. The Kewda oil is extracted by processing the flowers in distilleries. Around 250 processing units, locally known as bhatis, were engaged in processing the flowers. Apart from its use in the perfume industry, the oil of the thorny flower is used in preparing gutka (a stimulant that causes mouth cancer). After the ban on manufacture and sale of gutka in several states, including Odisha, most of the processing units have stopped operations.

One response to the Praja Mandal agitations was the foundation of the Central Reserve Police Force in 1939. Orissa When the province of Orissa was created by dividing the existing Bihar and Orissa Province in 1936, it became the first administrative region of British India to be defined on a linguistic basis. Although this satisfied some long-standing desires, it made little practical difference to many of the populace because the new province included 26 areas under independent feudal control, called garjats, where the peasantry in particular suffered the effects of misrule and autocratic powers. The remainder of the new province was controlled by the British Raj authorities. Although the people of Orissa had little involvement in the Gandhi-inspired Salt March protests of 1930, that campaign did lead to the First All Orissa States People's Conference being held at Cuttack in the following year, with Bhubanananda Das and Sena Adhaksya Senapati Nakula Samanta Sinhar of HindolPrincelyState acting as president. It had the aim of persuading the ruling garjat chiefs to agree to more representative government but achieved nothing more than to increase their repression. A second Conference held in 1937 had more effect. Its aim was to achieve more equitable government and it led to the establishment of Praja Mandals (People's Associations) in most of the garjat states, demanding changes to the feudal system. Their demands included an end to forced labour and illegal taxes, as well as rights relating to freedom of association, publication of newspapers and property. The first sign of trouble involving a Praja Mandal arose in the princely state of Nilgiri, where peasant demands for fairer laws resulted in the ruler adopting repressive, even brutal, measures in response. Whilst a temporary truce was eventually achieved, problems then arose also in the states of Talcher and Dhenkanal. While the ruler of the latter state took such strong measures that several people were killed, the ruler of Talcher faced an unusual protest that attracted national attention: many of his peasantry moved out of the state to settle in temporary camps in the British-governed area of Orissa. Another unusual protest occurred in Nayagarh State when its ruler attempted to introduce a monopoly on the supply of betel: the population reacted by almost entirely stopping their consumption, which led to the arrest of some of its leaders. Discontent was voiced in other states, such as Athgarh, Baramba, Narsinghpur, Nayagarh, Ranpur and Tigiria, sometimes resulting in violence and death. Following an organised \\"All Orissa Garjat Day\\" on 29 October 1938, when people attempted to voice their concerns in unity, the troubles continued into 1939. In early January 1939, a British Political Agent, Major Bazelgette, was killed while trying to defuse tensions in Ranpur. The news of this dampened protests elsewhere, and notably so in Nayagarh, where Bazelgette had been summoned a few days earlier to assist the beleaguered raja in calming the Praja Mandal. Whilst the rajas might resort to violence, the Indian independence movement, as exemplified by Gandhi's Congress Party, believed in non-violent protest and civil disobedience; Congress leaders such as Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Subash Chandra Bose welcomed the political awakening of the people in Orissa but simultaneously condemned the killing. The British responded to the death by sending in troops, executing the ringleaders, and deposing the raja in favour of direct control. A 1939 report by the Orissa States Enquiry Committee, which had been formed in 1937 to investigate the garjat states, came to nothing because of the outbreak of World War II, during the period of which the British would not countenance any changes or agitation. The Praja Mandal movement came to the fore again when the war ended, spurred by the possibility of wide-ranging change should the British grant India its independence. The first cracks appeared when the ruler of Nilgiri attempted to put a wedge between the tribal and non-tribal communities of his state by fomenting attacks from one on the other. This decision, which he hoped would undermine the Praja Mandal, created a major problem in law and order that made it necessary for the Government of Orissa to intervene on instructions from the central government. The central government were particularly concerned to contain the problem, which had the potential to spread into neighbouring states, and which in part had also been engendered by the unwillingness of the newly-formed Eastern States Union, comprising numerous princely states, to submit to Praja Mandal demands for democratic representation in its governance. Thus, Nilgiri came under the aegis of the provincial government from November 1947 and within weeks all but two of the other garjat states - Saraikela and Kharsawan - had agreed to merge with the main Orissa province. Prominent figures in the Orissa Praja Mandal movement included Sarangadhar Das, Baisnab Charan Patnaik, Pabitramohan Pradhan, Nabakrushna Choudhury and Kailas Chandra Mahonty.

After 1945 the eastern part of Berlin, where Brandt lived and worked, was administered as the Soviet occupation zone of what had been Germany. By 1949, when the occupation zone was relaunched as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), it was in the process of becoming a second German one-party dictatorship. Helmut Brandt opposed manifestations of this development: he was ousted from his job with the ministry of Justice and his position as a member of the CDU party leadership team. On 6 September 1950 he was arrested, although he would have to wait another four years for any sort of trial. He was accused of activities hostile to the state (\\"staatsfeindlicher Arbeit\\") and he spent the years between 1950 and 1964 in prison. Life Early years Brandt was born in Berlin's Spandau quarter. At university he studied jurisprudence and public law, obtaining doctorates in both related disciplines, following which he took a job with Deutsche Bank. In the meantime, in 1929 he joined the German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei / DVP), undertaking secretarial duties for the party in the Reichstag from 1931 until 1933, when a change of regime led to the DVP being outlawed. Following a brief period working at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for public law (Kaiser- Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr V√∂lkerrecht), in 1938 Brandt joined a legal firm that specialised in matters involving international civil law. War broke out in 1939 and Brandt fought as a member of the German army on both the eastern and western fronts. For some of the time he was based in Berlin, however, working at the Ministry for Military Procurement. War ended in May 1945 and almost immediately, in June 1945, he was able to return to Berlin and set himself up as a freelance lawyer, also taking a part-time teaching post at Berlin University. Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic In 1945 there was a widespread assumption that the destruction of Nazi Germany should open the way for a return to multi-party democracy. Helmut Brandt was a founder member of the Christian Democratic Union (Christlich-Demokratische Union / CDU), intended as a slightly more broadly based version of the DVP that had existed before the abolition, in 1933, of parliamentary democracy. He quickly became the party's expert on legal issues. The next year, however, April 1946 saw the creation of a new political party within the Soviet occupation zone, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED), formed through a contentious merger of the old German Communist Party and (many of the elements of) the more moderately left-wing Social Democratic Party. During the next few years the authorities sought to move towards a new one-party dictatorship, not by banning the other political parties but by controlling them. This was achieved by placing them all into an umbrella organisation known as the National Front and itself controlled by the SED (party). In the end it was only in the Soviet occupation zone (reinvented, formally in October 1949, as the German Democratic Republic / East Germany) that a return to single-party dictatorship was achieved, and even here implementation of the strategy was far from smooth, and stretched out over several years. With the CDU in his part of Germany increasingly under state pressure from without and infiltrated within, in 1948 Helmut Brandt joined the pro-Soviet District Federation (\\"Landesverband\\") in the eastern sector of Berlin. In West Berlin this led to accusations that he was leading a split of the CDU which still saw itself as a single political party across all the allied occupation zones in what was left of Germany after 1945. It was also in 1948 that Helmut Brandt was appointed as one of the 45 CDU members of the first Peoples' Assembly of the Soviet Occupation Zone and co-opted as a member of the assembly committee charged with drawing up a new constitution. By this time. however, the CDU leadership in the Soviet occupation zone was undergoing internal fragmentation, dividing those who, for various reasons, were prepared to collaborate, whether willingly or not, with the constitutional developments being implemented by the ruling SED (party) from those, such as Georg Dertinger and Helmut Brandt, who were less so. On account of his \\"bourgeois-conservative\\" propensities Brandt now found himself forced out of positions of influence within the CDU, notably by Arnold Gohr of the East German party's collaborationist wing. It was Gohr who replaced him as chairman of the District Federation (\\"Landesverband\\") in what was becoming known as the Soviet sector of Berlin. In October 1949 Helmut Brandt was appointed as a secretary of state in the new country's Justice Ministry. In May 1950 he protested to his minister Max Fechner (SED) and to his own party leader in East Germany, Otto Nuschke (CDU) over the Waldheimer Trials, a succession of rapid legal hearings of 3,324 of people who had survived and been released from the hitherto unacknowledged Soviet controlled concentration camps. These now had their cases \\"processed\\" and were sentenced in \\"fast- track\\" hearings at which Brandt (and others) felt that justice was poorly served. Arrest and imprisonment In September 1950 he was arrested by people working for the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). Four years of \\"pre-trial detention\\" ensued, most of which he spent in an underground cell at the Stasi Hohensch√∂nhausen detention centre. In 1953 he found himself arbitrarily linked by the Stasi with the \\"group of conspirators\\" connected with Georg Dertinger who was arrested at the start of that year, and in June 1954 the Supreme Court of East Germany sentenced Brandt, during a secret trial, to ten years of imprisonment for working against the state (\\"staatsfeindlicher Arbeit\\"). The ten-year sentence was later reduced, formally, to eight years, though as matters turned out he remained in prison, apart from a few days in 1958 till 1964. By 1958 Brandt had been transferred to the super-jail at Bautzen from where he was released as an act of clemency in September. However, he was issued with a residency permit which required him to remain in the Dresden area. Thirty-six hours later he was re-arrested by the Stasi while trying to escape to West Berlin: his arrest resulted from a concern on the part of the authorities that he was about to speak to western journalists. A further trial took place, this time at Frankfurt (Oder) on 13 March 1959, at which Brandt received another ten-year jail sentence for crimes that included espionage, inducing people to escape from the German Democratic Republic, producing propaganda that endangered the state and treason. Freedom After 5,095 days in prison Helmut Brandt was released in August 1964. He was one of the first of approximately 34,000 East German political prisoners to have their freedom purchased by the West German government between 1964 and 1989 as part of a (at the time secret) scheme to try and compensate for East Germany's desperate shortage of cash. Brandt promptly relocated to the Rhineland region of West Germany, employed by various universities and working, till 1977, as an expert consultant to the government in Bonn.

From 1939 to 1969, she published over forty books and numerous short stories. She is best remembered as the author of the \\"Susan\\" series. Early life Jean Bell Shaw Patrick was born in Glasgow on 3 December 1910, the daughter of John Patrick and Margaret Shaw Patrick. Her father was a medical doctor. She was tutored at home by a governess until, at the age of eight, she began attending Park School on nearby Lynedoch Street. In her last two years at the school, she was editor of the Park Chronicle, the school magazine. She studied at the University of Glasgow, graduating with a Second Class Honours Degree in English Literature and Language in 1932. She then spent a year in London at the Maria Grey Training College, studying to be a teacher.Lindsay, Alison. \\"The Jane Shaw Archive\\" Bettany Press.  Career  Instead of teaching, Shaw's first job was at the Times Book Club in London. She was then offered a job with William Collins, Sons. The editor of children's books at Collins, Jocelyn Oliver, recognized her talent and encouraged her to write a story. The result was her first book, Breton Holiday, which was published in 1939. Her house in Dulwich was bombed in World War II, and she moved in with friends in Bath and Kent. She continued to write through wartime disruption and the births of her two children, with a further three books published during the war. After the war, she saw several of her short stories adapted for broadcast on BBC's Children's Hour. Her family's move to Johannesburg in 1952 was the inspiration behind her book Venture to South Africa, which chronicles the upheaval faced by a British family moving overseas. In Johannesburg, she worked at the Children's Book Shop and continued writing her books and short stories. In her popular \\"Susan\\" series of books, the title character Susan Lyle stays in London and has adventures with her cousins, while her parents are living in Africa. Shaw's books became collectibles after she stopped writing in 1970; some have been re-issued after her death.  Personal life  In 1938, Jean Shaw married Robert Evans, an accountant, whom she had known since childhood. They set up home in Dulwich Village, London. The Evans had two children: Margaret Jane, born 1942, and Ian, born 1944. In 1952 her husband was offered an accountancy position in Johannesburg, and the whole family moved there. In 1978, following Robert Evans's retirement, the family returned to Scotland, setting up home on the isle of Arran, which had been a favourite holiday destination in her childhood. Her husband died 1987. Following a short illness, Jean Evans died in 2000, just two weeks before her ninetieth birthday. She was buried beside her husband, at the Shiskine cemetery on Arran. Her literary and business papers, including manuscripts of unpublished works, are archived in the National Library of Scotland.

The \\"Coronation of William and Mary\\" by the children using net curtains for costumes She became the headmistress of the village school in Sompting in Sussex in 1897. Her sister Emily was employed on the same day on the same salary. Emily was in charge of the infants whilst Harriet was head. She led fifty children and she decided that only a revolutionary approach would put the children as the focus of education - \\"to help them to grow\\". She started by using nature walks.The Dramatic Method of Teaching, The Spectator, 1911, Retrieved 30 January 2016 The approach at the school was not based on control but in empowering the children with educational visits. By 1903 she was one of twelve teachers chosen to serve on an advisory board on elementary education in her county. Finlay-Johnson's major work was described in her book \\"The dramatic Method of Teaching\\". Her book explains how she had encouraged children to create their own plays. Sometimes these would be based on works of fiction but at other times they would create their own original plays based on their own research of facts from history. The teacher was seen as the facilitator and not the lead in the investigation that created the drama. Moreover, she believed that the final creation should not be judged by adult concepts of how good the production was but through the eyes of the participants. Marriage Johnson's achievement's became well known and although she was only the headmistress of a small Sussex school her work had wide interest. Her career however came to a premature end when she decided to marry George Weller in 1909.

For the 2016 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of wrestler Lizmark. This was the 18th March show held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas name, having previously been known as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth from 1996 to 1998. The Dos Leyendas show featured two Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair matches in the main event and the fourth match of the show. In the main event Volador Jr. defeated Negro Casas, which meant Casas had his hair shaved off. In the other Apuesta match Rush defeated former tag team partner M√°ximo Sexy, forcing M√°ximo to be shaved bald afterwards per lucha libre traditions. The show featured three Six-man \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team match and a tag team match. Production Background Since 1996 the Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a show in March each year to commemorate the passing of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth who died in March 1987. For the first three years the show paid homage to Lutteroth himself, from 1999 through 2004 the show paid homage to Lutteroth and El Santo, Mexico's most famous wrestler ever and from 2005 forward the show has paid homage to Lutteroth and a different leyenda (\\"Legend\\") each year, celebrating the career and accomplishments of past CMLL stars. Originally billed as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth, it has been held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") since 1999 and is the only show outside of CMLL's Anniversary shows that CMLL has presented every year since its inception. All Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2016 show will be the 21st overall Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. Storylines Negro Casas, who lost his hair in the main event The Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. On September 11, 2015 Ram√≥n Ibarra Banda, better known as Super Parka returned to CMLL after an almost eight-year absence to team with his son Volador Jr. A couple of months later Super Parka began working a storyline feud against Negro Casas, one of CMLL's resident veteran rudos. The story line eventually led to the two captaining a team of three, facing off during the 2015 Infierno en el Ring. Super Parka teamed with M√°ximo Sexy and Valiente while Casas teamed up with Kamaitachi and B√°rbaro Cavernario. After Super Parka's team won the match both Super Parka and Casas laid out a Lucha de Apuestas challenge, daring each other to put their hair on the line for a special \\"bet match\\" between the two. Moments later CMLL officials came to the ring to sign the contract for the following week's Sin Piedad (\\"No Mercy\\") show. Casas defeated Super Parka, forcing Super Parka to have all his hair shaved off as a result. Casas' nephew Puma helped his uncle win the match, much to the displeasure of Volador Jr. who was in his father's corner. Volador Jr. vowed to get revenge for what he described as the Casas family's cheating ways. The first time Volador Jr. faced off against Negro Casas after Sin Pieda Puma and his brother Tiger interfered in the match, helping their uncle win the match. The story line between Volador Jr. and Negro Casas led to Volador Jr. defending the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship against Negro Casas on February 15, 2016. On February 24 CMLL held a press conference where Volador Jr. and Negro Casas both agreed to put their hair on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas match, officially announcing the main event of the 2016 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. M√°ximo Sexy who lost his hair at the 2016 Dos Leyendas show. In 2011 Rush, Marco Corleone and M√°ximo formed the trio El Bufete del Amor (\\"The Law of Love\\"), defeating Los Hijos del Averno (Averno, Mephisto and Ephesto) to win the CMLL World Trios Championship. In May 2014 Marco Corleone suffered a knee injury, which forced the team to relinquish the trios championship. During the summer of 2015 Rush had begun teaming regularly with La Sombra and La M√°scara to form a team called Los Ingobernables (\\"The Unruly\\"). WIth Corleone's injury and Rush teaming with Sombra and La M√°scara on a regular basis El Bufete was disbanded. In the winter of 2014 Rush broke his leg during a match, which led CMLL to replace him with Marco Corleone for all Ingobernables matches. When Rush returned they decided to let Corleone remain with the team, expanding from a trio to a four-man group. In early 2016 Rush began targeting M√°ximo, now known as M√°ximo Sexy. During a match on the February 19 CMLL Super Viernes show Corleone protected M√°ximo Sexy as Rush and La M√°scara attacked him repeated. Moments later Rush and La La M√°scara attacked Marco Corleone and kicked him out of Los Ingobernables. During the CMLL press conference on February 25 Corleone and M√°ximo Sexy announced that they would be reforming El Bufete del Amor and would be looking for a third man to complete the trio. During the press conference M√°ximo Sexy challenged Rush to a Lucha de Apuestas match, which Rush agreed to, signing a contract during the press conference. Homage to Salvador Lutteroth and Lizmark In September 1933 Salvador Lutteroth Gonz√°lez founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), which would later be renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Over time Lutteroth would become responsible for building both Arena Coliseo in Mexico City and Arena Mexico, which became known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". Over time EMLL became the oldest wrestling promotion in the world, with 2018 marking the 85th year of its existence. Lutteroth has often been credited with being the \\"father of Lucha Libre\\", introducing the concept of masked wrestlers to Mexico as well as the Luchas de Apuestas match. Lutteroth died on September 5, 1987. EMLL, late CMLL, remained under the ownership and control of the Lutteroth family as first Salvador's son Chavo Lutteroth and later his grandson Paco Alonso took over ownership of the company. The life and achievements of Salvador Lutteroth is always honored at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyenda' show and since 1999 CMLL has also honored a second person, a Leyenda of lucha libre, in some ways CMLL's version of their Hall of Fame. For the 2016 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of Juan Ba√±os (December 18, 1950‚ÄìDecember 16, 2015) best known as the masked wrestler Lizmark. Ba√±os made his in-ring debut on March 14, 1976, wearing the blue and silver mask that he would wrestle under for most of his career, and using the name Lizmark, inspired by the German battleship Bismarck. Lizmark quickly became one of the innovators in lucha libre, incorporating flashy, high flying moves into the matches, a style that is common today but in the 1970s was new and exciting. During his 37-year long career Lizmark won the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship, CMLL World Tag Team Championship with Atlantis, the CMLL World Trios Championship Atlantis and Mr. Niebla the Mexican National Middleweight Championship on two occasions, the Mexican National Welterweight Championship, the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship four times,, the NWA World Middleweight Championship, the NWA World Welterweight Championship, and the WWA World Light Heavyweight Championship. His sons followed in his footsteps, wrestling as Lizmark Jr. and El Hijo del Lizmark. He was part of the Class of 2001 inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.

The webbing which helps the keeper to catch the ball can be seen between the thumb and index fingers. A wicket-keeper's gloves or mitt are large leather gloves worn by cricket players of the defending team which assist players in catching and fielding balls hit by a batsman or thrown by a teammate. Construction Wicket-keeper's gloves have an anterior surface designed for catching the ball, while offering protection to fingers and the palms of the hands from painful impact. Typically, the catching surface is made of rubber and has some traction-enhancing features, such as pimples. The catching surface is coloured yellow in the image shown above. Soft padding material is placed underneath the catching surface to reduce the impact of the ball.

The house was built in 1870 and was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 7 October 1970. The house is situated in the central Indre by neighborhood on Vesterport.  History  Hald's House was built by the merchant Jens Poulsen Hald in 1849. At the time Vesterport (Lit. Western Gate) had one of the 7 city gates at one end where Vestergade is now located. In the 1800s octroi was imposed on agricultural products entering the city and it was common for merchants to place their houses by the entrance of the city gates in order to receive farmers and trade with them. Hald was also a city council member why the house is also called Councillor Hald's House. The building consists of 4 wings arranged in a square with a courtyard and smaller building in the middle. The front house facing the street was built by Hald but the back buildings were built earlier by other merchants. The front house replaced a half-timbered building that was constructed in the 1700s by Mogens Michelsen Blach who also built the north wing which was incorporated into the new building complex. The back house was built between 1817 and 1827 by merchant S. J. Schmidt and the low south-wing was built by Th. Fr. Severin in 1842. In the latter part of the 19th century, the building was used as a small barracks which was common in the city at the time. The city built the larger Langelandsgade Barracks and Vester All√© Barracks in the 1880s and the buildings were sold off. In the years after it was used for small industry and shops. In the 1990s the buildings were renovated and turned into condominiums.  Architecture  The house consists of 5 buildings from different time periods and a courtyard enclosed within. The front house has a low ridged roof with a series of prominent dormer windows and a brick cornice below.

They may be used when maxillary bone quality or quantity is inadequate for the placement of regular dental implants. Inadequate maxillary bone volume may be due to bone resorption as well as to pneumatization of the maxillary sinus or to a combination of both. The minimal bone height for a standard implant placement in the posterior region of the upper jaw should be about 10 mm to ensure acceptable implant survival. When there is inadequate bone available, bone grafting procedures and sinus lift procedures may be carried out to increase the volume of bone. Bone grafting procedures in the jaws have the disadvantage of prolonged treatment time, restriction of denture wear, morbidity of the donor surgical site and graft rejection. Zygoma implants were first introduced in late 1990s by Dr. Per Ingvar Branemark widely acknowledged as the \\"Father of Dental Implantology\\". Zygomatic implants have been used for dental rehabilitation in patients with insufficient bone in the posterior upper jaw, due to, for example, aging, tumor resection, trauma, or atrophy. Zygoma implants take the anchorage from the zygoma/zygomatic bone (cheek bone). The Zygomatic bone is denser in quality and more cortical in nature than posterior maxillary bone. Because of the sturdy anchorage achievable in the dense bone of the zygomatic region, and the wide stress distribution achieved on these tilted implants, a prosthesis can often be immediately placed at the time of surgery . The Zygoma implant is available in lengths ranging from 30 to 52.5 mm. The head of the zygoma implant is engineered to allow prosthesis attachment at a 45-degree angle to the long axis of the implant. Zygomatic implants can be used in patients who do not have any teeth in the upper jaw, patients who have heavily broken down teeth or very mobile teeth due to diseases such as generalised aggressive periodontitis. The success rate of zygomatic implants reported in the literature world-wide is 97 - 98%. The complications associated with these implants are sinusitis, paresthesia in the cheek region and oro-antral fistula.

The area of production of this variety of pepper now covers all the geographical regions that were once part of the Malabar region of the erstwhile Madras Presidency. These regions now entail the entire South India area. Malabar pepper was one of the commodities most sought after by the ancient Roman and Arab traders, and later by the early European navigators. Malabar pepper is classified under two grades known as garbled and un-garbled. The garbled variety is black in colour nearly globular with a wrinkled surface. The ungarbled variety has a wrinkled surface and the colour varies from dark brown to black. The plant (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning. The fruit, known as a peppercorn when dried, is a small drupe five millimetres in diameter, dark red when fully mature, containing a single seed. \\"Malabar pepper\\" has been granted registration in Part A under Sub-section (1) of Section 13 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999.

Digby was born in 1900 into the class of British colonial civil servants and engineers which by the time of her death in 1960 was fast disappearing. She came from a family where painting had been a leisure pursuit for many generations. Violet Digby and her two elder brothers were taught to draw and paint by their father William, who was a skilled draftsman, designer and engineer. Violet Digby took her talents back to India as the wife of Kenelm Digby. After Kenelm's death in 1944 she joined the community of artists in St Ives where she would remain until her suicide in 1960. She exhibited her paintings regularly at the St Ives Society of Artists exhibitions, including the Festival of Britain Exhibition in 1951. Her paintings were accepted at the annual exhibitions of The Pastel Society, and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in London. She also put up exhibitions in Delhi and in Cornwall. Her paintings were accepted every year but one from 1950-1960 by the Paris Salon of the French Society of Artists. There is an archive of her work and papers held by the Simon Digby Memorial Charity in Jersey in the Channel Islands.The SDMC grants access to the archive by appointment The charity commissioned a biographical catalogue of her work which was published in 2015. The first major exhibition of her work since her death in 1960 takes place at the cultural wing of the Indian High Commission, the Nehru Centre, London in April 2016. Early life Violet Margaret Kidd was born in Plymouth in 1900 where her Scottish father was working on the expansion of the naval dockyard. In 1905 she moved to Bombay where her father had an engineering company, 'Lowther and Kidd'. In 1907, her family met the Carnell family while on furlough at St Jacut de la Mer in Brittany, France. Norman Carnell was at the time a railway engineer in Burma. Digby's new friend Enid Carnell was later to marry Violet Digby's brother Lewis. Mrs Kidd and Mrs Carnell became firm friends and decided to remain together in Europe with their daughters, Violet and Enid, rather than return to the East to manage their husbands' households. In 1914 Violet's father returned to England where he was involved in the construction of one of the first aircraft factories. Violet's fragmented education continued with spells at Farlington School and helping her father at the aircraft factory. The many surviving letters addressed to Violet after the war suggest that she was the object of a number of suitors in her busy schedule of art school, golf, tennis, skiing, dancing and everything else 'roaring twenties'. She also studied at Hastings College of Art, under Leslie Badham and Philip Cole and at the Slade School of Fine Art. Marriage Kenelm George Digby became friendly with the Kidd family in the south of France while on furlough from India where his family had served for several generations. He proposed many times to Violet who finally accepted him in 1926 while on the rebound from a long and turbulent relationship that ended badly. Violet Digby returned to the lifestyle of a senior Memsahib of the Raj and went back to painting as her leisure pursuit. About a dozen paintings of Central Provinces and the South of France survive from this period, many paintings were lost on her return from India after the World War Two. She gave birth to a daughter Venetia in 1930 who died in her first year. Her son Simon was born in 1932. Her interest in art and painting continued to develop. In 1939 she studied with Andr√© Strauss at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts summer school in Fontainebleau. She spent much of the Second World War in India, concerned with the 'Hospitality League' organising holidays for British soldiers and sailors based in the east.Women in India (quarterly), Vol 1, No.4 pp 38-40. Lahore Kenelm died unexpectedly of apoplexy in 1944. St Ives years Violet Digby returned to the UK after the war. She was attracted to the colony of artists in St Ives, Cornwall, where she was based in a cottage that she had bought. She joined the St Ives Society of Artists (StISA) in 1946 and remained a member until her death in 1960. She took a painting trip to Norway in autumn 1950 with her son Simon but still longed to return to Kashmir. Kashmir had been inaccessible to tourists since the troubles surrounding the independence and partition of India in 1947. Eventually Digby plucked up the courage to write to Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, asking for special permission. The airmail letter received a positive reply within a fortnight. Digby continued to enjoy the favour of the new Indian ruling class, she was a guest of President Rajendra Prasad at his Republic Day 'at home' on her return to India in 1958. Digby based herself on a houseboat on the Dal Lake during two long visits to India in 1952/3 and 1957/8. She often avoided unwanted attention in and around Srinagar by painting from a shikara on the rivers and canals. Exhibitions Digby exhibited paintings in the StISA exhibitions in 1949, 1950 and in the StISA Festival of Britain Exhibition which ran from May to September 1951 and which also went on tour. She had one piece in the 1950 exhibition at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and three pieces in their 1951 show. She held a joint exhibition with her son Simon at the Piazza Studios in St Ives in 1951. Digby had pieces included in The Pastel Society exhibitions, three in 1951La Revue Moderne, Paris, 'Salon des Pastillistes', page 9, 1 April 1951, four in 1952 and one in 1953. The Pastel Society's 1951 exhibition went on tour over the following year through the north of England. She held a joint exhibition of her work with Serbjeet Singh in Delhi in 1953Hindustan Times, Thursday January 29, 1953, p.3Hindusthan Standard, Thursday, Jan 29, 1953, p.3 and a further solo exhibition in Delhi in 1958The Hindustan Times, Friday, January 31, 1958The Times of India, Friday January 31, 1958,The Indian Express, Friday, January 31, 1958, p.3 which was opened by Supreme Court Judge, Justice Vivian Bose. She submitted pieces to the Paris Salon of the French Society of Artists every year between 1950 and 1960 (except 1955) all of which were accepted. Her paintings of Kashmir appeared in colour on the cover of 'Kashmir'Kashmir Volume 3, number 3, pub. in Delhi in March 1953 magazine. In June 1953, another of Digby's paintings appeared in colour on the cover of Kashmir magazine, this time accompanied by a black and white sketch and a full page article by Digby about painting in Kashmir.Kashmir, Volume 3, number 6, pub. in Delhi in June 1953, page 114 In April 2016, forty of Digby's Kashmir paintings were exhibited at the Nehru Centre in London. Death Violet Digby had spent quite a lot of money on her expeditions to Kashmir and was financially stretched. Her brother Lewis and sister-in-law Enid, her childhood friend, advised her to join them in Jersey, where the tax regime was more favourable. By then the atmosphere in St Ives had become quite toxic between the rival schools of painters, and Digby resolved to leave. She put down a deposit on a house in the parish of Trinity, Jersey. She was involved in a seemingly minor traffic incident in London on 13 August 1960. She drove across a zebra crossing and a child ran into the side of her car, fell over and grazed his knee. Digby did not see any reason to report the incident but someone else clearly did. Some days later, a policeman came to her house in St Ives and she was given notice of an intended prosecution. On the afternoon of Friday 2 September, she went to her doctor, who prescribed barbiturates to calm her down. Later that day, she went home, took most of the pills, wrote a note to her son Simon, and switched on the gas which killed her.St Ives Times and Echo, 9 September 1960 The coroner found that she taken her own life while under the influence of barbiturates.

Chormicle who both staked claims on a piece of land in the territory. The feud started when Chormicle purchased 1,600 acres of the same land Jenkins had settled on years ago. When the dispute couldn't be settled in court, violence erupted between the two, lasting for over two decades, with dozens of men from both sides killed. It was one of the largest range wars in American history and one of the bloodiest events in the state. History Background William Willoby Jenkins was a rancher and gambler who staked a claim to land in Castaic, California, in 1875, during the great migration West following the Homestead Acts in the late 19th century. He was 16 when he moved from Ohio to the Los Angeles area with his family in 1851. In Castaic, Jenkins ran a successful ranch, an oil company, and a profitable cat business during a rat infestation in the county. He later developed a reputation as a gambler and gunman. At one time Jenkins was deputized as a Los Angeles County constable. In one incident, he was sent to repossess a guitar from a locally popular Mexican man named Antonio Ruiz. A fight broke out during which Jenkins shot and killed Ruiz. Jenkins was jailed to await trial for murder. A mob of about 200 Mexicans formed to lynch him; the sheriff was wounded during their failed attempt to swarm the jail. Jenkins later enlisted in the Los Angeles Rangers, a local militia. The group pursued the men who had shot the sheriff, arrested their leader, but later released him. By 1872, Jenkins staked a claim near Castaic Creek, building a ranch he called the Lazy Z. Feud In 1890, another rancher and frontiersman by the name of William C. Chormicle settled nearby, claiming to have bought 1,600 acres of the same land as Jenkins from railroads. This claim conflicted with that by Jenkins and the two came into conflict. The men failed to resolve the dispute amicably in court and it escalated to violence. The same year, Jenkins sent three men onto the disputed land. Chormicle and William A. Gardner, a friend of his, fired on the intruders, killing two of them, while the third escaped by horse. Chormicle and Gardner surrendered to the sheriff and a trial was set. They pleaded self-defense, saying that they were protecting the property. The trial lasted for 18 days in June 1890, one of the longest trials in Los Angeles County history at the time. Jenkins was infuriated when the jury found Chormicle and Gardner not guilty. The two men began to dispute mining, grazing, and water rights in addition to road building. A number of barns were burned on both sides, and men were killed in gun battles. In one incident, a young girl was killed in a crossfire. Later, forest ranger Robert Emmett Clark, appointed in 1905 by President Theodore Roosevelt, was sent to end the feud. Clark succeeded in keeping the peace until 1913, when he left Castaic. That year, Jenkins was shot in the chest at his Lazy Z home by a man working for Chormicle, but survived. The feud continued, and a group of men working for Jenkins burned down William Gardner's house, killing him and some members of his family. Chormicle retaliated by having his rival's son, David Jenkins, lynched in Bouquet Canyon.. The long-running conflict began to draw to a close when Chormicle was shot to death in 1916. Jenkins had recovered not long before and was blamed by locals for the murder. Sometime in the next few years, Jenkins was shot while herding cattle on the disputed land by a man named Billy Rose. Rose's, William B. Rose, had testified on Chormicle's behalf in the 1890 trial, and carried on the feud after Chormicle's death. Jenkins again survived, and the feud drew to a close. Jenkins eventually died of an illness in October 1919 while visiting relatives in Los Angeles. He was either 84 or 86, and had reportedly survived a total of seven gunshot wounds. In total, the Castaic Range War claimed the lives of 21 to 40 people. Legacy Today, much of the disputed land, near what is now the intersection of Lake Hughes Road and Castaic Road, is submerged under Castaic Lake behind Castaic Dam. In 1998, workers at a housing development site unearthed the pine boxes containing the remains of an infant and four adult men. The site was believed to have been the site of the Jenkins family cemetery, and the bodies some of the final victims of the range war. Bouquet Canyon, where William Jenkins's son David was killed, has been nicknamed both \\"Hangman's Canyon\\" or \\"Dead Man's Canyon\\", in reference to the lynching.

A native of the Dominican Republic and one of eleven children, Alfredo Edmead joined the Salem Pirates of the Carolina League as a 17-year-old in 1974. Edmead immediately showed promise, batting .314 with 61 stolen bases and seven homers in 119 games with Salem, a farm club of the MLB Pittsburgh Pirates. Edmead spoke little English, but improved quickly. \\"I was afraid I‚Äôd be withdrawn,\\" he told a reporter early in the season. Salem manager John Lipon was impressed, describing Edmead as \\"so very smart\\". Death On August 22, 1974, the Pirates were playing the Rocky Mount Phillies at Salem's Municipal Stadium. Opposing pitcher Murray Gage-Cole hit a fly ball to short right field. Edmead gave chase, while teammate, second baseman Pablo Cruz drifted back for the play. Edmead collided with Cruz‚Äîwho, coincidentally, had signed Edmead to his first pro contract as a part-time scout for the Pirates‚Äîstriking his head on Cruz's knee, knocking Edmead unconscious. Phillies pitcher Jim Meerpohl related the incident in an interview in the Sporting News: \\"Cruz was seated on the ground, rolling up his pant leg, still very much in pain, but then we saw he had a knee brace, the old-fashioned kind with steel braces on each side. That damned steel had been like an axe to Edmead's head, with his left side of his skull from the frontal lobe across the top to the back of his skull sliced open about three-quarters of an inch and the bleeding was horrific.\\" Edmead died an hour later from massive brain trauma and loss of blood at Lewis-Gale Hospital in Salem. At the age of 17, Edmead remains the youngest death of any professional baseball player in history.

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, video or network traffic. This type of malware operates by building a steganographic system to hide malicious data within its resources and then extracts and executes them dynamically. It is considered one of the most sophisticated and stealthy ways of obfuscation. The term of \`stegomalware' was introduced by researchers in the context of mobile malware and presented at Inscrypt conference in 2014. However, the fact that (mobile) malware could potentially utilize steganography was already presented in earlier works: the use of steganography in malware was first applied to botnets communicating over probabilistically unobservable channels, mobile malware based on covert channels was proposed in the same year. Steganography was later applied to other components of malware engineering such as return- oriented programming and compile-time obfuscation, among others. The Europol- supported CUING initiative monitors the use of steganography in malware.

Talking about her work, Marjaana Kella has stated \\"My photographs are kind of studies of perception and experience, or of the interface between people‚Äôs external and internal spaces.\\" The series Reversed (1996‚Äì1997) presents unusual portraits of individuals turning away from the camera, represented only by the back of their heads. The portraits, almost non-gestural, therefore ignore the subject's facial features to create pictorial, and textured compositions renewing the genre's aesthetic.

It premiered on July 30, 1937, at the Bennington School of the Dance in Bennington, Vermont. The piece was created in response to the Spanish Civil War and rising fascism as Francisco Franco gained control of the country.  Theme  In particular, Graham was inspired by tales of La Pasionaria, real name Dolores Ib√°rruri, a fervent communist and champion of the Spanish Republic. At the outbreak of war in 1936, Ib√°rruri roused Republican forces with Emiliano Zapata's words, \\"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.\\" During the Battle of Madrid, she coined her own famous slogan, \\"¬°No Pasar√°n!\\" (\\"They shall not pass!\\"), which became the doomed Republic's rallying cry. Graham created Immediate Tragedy in recognition of all Spanish women fighting side by side with the men. She intended to make a portrait of a brave, impassioned, indomitable heroine. Although largely disengaged from the era's politics, Graham herself had taken an anti-fascist stance when she joined labor-related causes of the Popular Front against Fascism in 1935. The following year, she refused an invitation from the Nazi Culture Ministry to dance at the Berlin Olympic Games.  Choreography and score  Immediate Tragedy did not make its way into the Martha Graham Dance Company repertoire, so the choreography is lost. But, Graham dancer and teacher Dorothy Bird wrote that she was startled by \\"the tempestuous, abandoned movement patterns...\\" She observed \\"Martha falling to the floor, twisting this way and that, beating on the floor, rebounding up, flinging herself through space. Here was a dramatically expressed burning anger, fueled by heartbreak and grief. Martha's portrayal of this gallant, militant, fearless woman hid nothing.\\" Cowell's score was also unconventional. The composer wrote the music while serving time in San Quentin Prison on a morals charge. Graham sent notes outlining the ballet's mood, tempo and meter, but without specifications as to the exact length of any section. To solve this problem, Cowell devised a strategy he called \\"elastic form.\\" Two basic phrases for clarinet and oboe were written in two-measure, three-measure, eight-measure, etc. versions. An eight-measure musical phrase could be fit to a dance passage of the same length. Overlaps were made where necessary. Norman Lloyd, who assisted with the score, recalled, \\"The process, as I remember it, took about an hour. The total effect was complete unity - as though dancer and composer had been in the closest communication.\\"  Critical reception  The piece was well received by critics. John Martin of The New York Times wrote, \\"Not since the eloquent and beautiful Frontier, first presented three seasons ago, has she given us anything half so fine as Immediate Tragedy.\\" The critic further noted that the work was not tied to a single event or time frame, but was universal in its appeal. \\"It is a picture of fortitude, especially of a woman's fortitude; of the acceptance of a challenge with a kind of passionate self-containment. From its emotional quality one recognizes its source rather than through any external means.\\" Another reviewer had similar thoughts, \\"It is not Spain that we see in her clean impassioned movement; it is the realization that Spain's tragedy is ours, is the whole world's tragedy.\\" Years later, Dorothy Bird expressed surprise the work had not become as popular as Graham's solo Lamentation, a 1930 study of profound grief.

Other scholars have identified it as Monte Bubbonia. The name of the town presumably comes from the ancient Greek word \\"√≥mphax\\", which means \\"wild, bitter grape\\".

There is some evidence that in the 4th century BCE that the city benefited from the reconstruction program of Timoleon in Sicily.

Principal photography began at the end of January 2016 and the film released on 23 September 2016. Riteish Deshmukh and Nargis Fakhri star in the film. The film received mixed reviews upon its release and was declared a flop at the box office. Plot Mickey (Luke Kenny) is an American, temporarily based in Mumbai, who is in search of an instrumentalist capable of playing the banjo. While trying to contact his music festival aspirant friend Christina (Nargis Fakhri), he comes across a local concert organised by a band of poor friends: 5 of them, led by Taraat (Riteish Deshmukh), who, unknown to Mickey, is the right match for him and Christina to show up at the festival. Christina, upon arrival in Mumbai, is forced to seek out odd jobs and portray Mumbai as dirty, but when, through a local MLA, she meets Taraat, who falls in love with her at first sight, she begins recognising the city as a good place. Taraat is at loggerheads with the leader of an underpaid rival band, who frames him wrongly for the assassination of the MLA who had introduced Taraat to Christina. By that time, in a twist of fate, Christina, while trying to chase the sounds of a banjo being perfectly played, discovers it is Taraat, and convinces him. Following the assassination, Taraat is disowned by his friends, who accuse him of committing a crime, under what is obviously a false impression. However, when the rival band's lead musician admits his mistake, the friends get back together. Finally, they are given a chance by popular music baron Shamin Nair (Mohan Kapoor). However, shortly after Christina returns to the States, Nair humiliates Taraat, who threatens Nair and dares him to steal the show. When the band makes an entry, Nair is convinced of the band's power as it plays a sway-away song based around Lord Ganesha. Finally, after Mickey sends a recording of the song to Christina, Taraat is contacted by her to come to the US for attending the festival.

His racing career consisted of only five races between August and October 1978, but he was rated one of the best horses of his generation in Europe in that year. After finishing fifth in the Anglesey Stakes on his debut he finished a close, and somewhat unlucky third in the National Stakes before winning the Group Three Larkspur Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse. Following a narrow defeat in the Beresford Stakes he was sent to England and ended his season by winning the Group One William Hill Futurity in a track record time. He never raced again and later stood as a breeding stallion in Europe and Japan. He had little success as a sire of winners. Background Sandy Creek was a chestnut horse with a broad white blaze and white socks on his hind legs bred in Ireland by O Freaney. He was from the last full crop of foals sired by Petingo, the leading English two-year-old of 1967, a year in which he was rated the best horse of any age in Europe by the independent Timeform organisation. Petingo's other progeny included the English Prince, Fair Salinia and Troy. Sandy Creek's dam Keep Right never raced but was a daughter of Narrow Escape who won the Chesham Stakes and was a half-sister of the Timeform Gold Cup winner Pushful. Another of Narrow Escape's daughters, Quality of Life, was the grand-dam of the St Leger winner Bob's Return. As a yearling, the colt was offered for sale and sold for 40,000 guineas and entered the ownership of the bookmaker Alfie McLean. He was sent into training with Con Collins (d. 2007) at The Curragh, County Kildare. Racing career 1978: two-year-old season Sandy Creek never contested a maiden race beginning his racing career by finishing fifth of the nine runners behind Dickens Hill in the Group Three Anglesey Stakes over six and a half furlongs at the Curragh in August. He then started a 33/1 outsider for the Group One National Stakes over the seven furlongs at the same track but belied his odds by finishing third to Tap On Wood and Dickens Hill, beaten a length after being slightly hampered by the winner in the closing stages. In the Group Three Larkspur Stakes at Leopardstown in September he started second favourite behind the British-trained Shack. He raced in second place behind Carelko before taking the lead a furlong from the finish and won by a length from Shack with Carelko in third. In the Beresford Stakes at the Curragh two weeks later he was matched against the Vincent O'Brien-trained Accomplice. He looked likely to win in the final furlong but was overhauled in the final strides and beaten a head by the 50/1 outsider Just A Game. In late October Sandy Creek was sent to England to contest the Group One William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Christy Roche he started at odds of 15/1 in a field of eleven runners. His main rivals appeared to be Lyphard's Wish (winner of the Solario Stakes), Warmington (third in the Dewhurst Stakes) and Bolide (runner-up in the Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte). Bolide took the lead from the start and set a very strong pace, whilst Sandy Creek was settled behind the leaders and turned into the straight in fourth place. Sandy Creek overtook Bolide a furlong and a half from the finish and held off several challengers to win by three quarters of a length from Warmington, with Lyphard's Wish, Laska Floko and Bolide close behind. The winning time of 1:38.32 was a track record for two-year-olds. Sandy Creek stayed in training in 1979 but never ran again and was retired from racing at the end of the season. He was reportedly bought for ¬£600,000 by John Magnier. Assessment In the inaugural International Classification for two-year- olds, Sandy Creek was the highest-rated Irish-trained horse and the equal fourth-best juvenile in Europe behind Tromos, Irish River and Sigy. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 123, eleven pounds inferior to their best two-year-old Tromos. Stud record At the end of his racing career Sandy Creek stood as a breeding stallion in Europe for two seasons before being exported to Japan. In nine seasons at stud in Japan he sired 56 winners from 137 registered foals the last of which were born in 1991. The best of his offspring was probably Lindo Hosho who won the Grade II Keio Hai Spring Cup and finished third in the Sprinters Stakes. Sandy Creek died on 24 March 1991.

Zogaib primarily ran in the Rolex Sports Car Series. Racing career After graduating from the Skip Barber Racing School Zogaib's first appearance in professional auto racing came at California Speedway in the Grand-Am Cup. The Daytona Beach, Florida resident joined Schuitemaker Motorsports in the GS class. With teammate J. C. France the duo finished their Nissan 350Z thirteenth overall, twelfth in class. The Lebanese born driver again joined the team during the 2005 race at Watkins Glen International. This time Zogaib was joined by Murray Marden to score a 43rd-place finish, 34th in class. In 2005 Zogaib also competed in the Rolex Sports Car Series for Blackforest Motorsports. A crash ended his debut in the 24 Hours of Daytona early. At Watkins Glen International Zogaib scored a tenth-place finish in the Spirit of Daytona Racing Crawford DP03. For 2007 Zogaib joined Michael Shank Racing for a partial season in the Rolex Sports Car Series. The driver ran four races in one of their Lexus powered Riley Mk. XI chassis. A seventh place at Miller Motorsports Park was Zogaib's best result. For 2008 Zogaib joined SAMAX Motorsport for a full-time season with seasoned veteran Ryan Dalziel. The team, headed by Peter Baron, was flying high with a second place at Virginia International Raceway and a win at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. Ponzi scheme In 2009 a Ponzi scheme involving Zogaib and business associate Paul Bellanca was uncovered. Zogaib and Bellanca promised prospective investors a return of up to 40% on their investment. The duo set up front companies such as Executive Investment Group LLC and Diversified Equity Investment Group LLC. Many racing drivers were victims of the scam: teammate Ryan Dalziel and his family lost approximately $550.000. Another victim, A. J. Allmendinger, invested a sum of money but he got his money back. SAMAX Motorsport boss Peter Baron lost approximately $400,000 to Zogaib. In total, $5.400.000 was lost by 33 investors. Zogaib was arrested in 2010, and in 2014 was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He is currently detained at Tomoka Correctional Institution.

At one of the scholarly discussions, a renowned denizen of Mumbai, Seth Chattamorarji, was present who got highly impressed by the level of Devarshi Ramanath Shastry's scholarly arguments and oratory skills to conclude a debate on an issue. On Seth Chattamorarji's insistence, Pandit (Pt.) Ramanath Shastry started living in Anantwadi locality where he would give learned discourses on such scriptures as Shrimadbhagwat, Gita, Upanishads, etc. His popularity and fame spread throughout Mumbai, drawing people from all walks of life to listen to his scholarly enunciation of the intricacies in these scriptures and tenets of pushtimarg.Dr. Sushma Sharma, ‚ÄòDevarshi Pt.

The two became friendly after a few meetings and their association brought about a religious revolution of sorts in the Pushtimargiya Vaishnav Sect, infusing renewed vigour and interest in the Pushtimarg and Shuddhadvaita (Pure Non-dualism) philosophy of which Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya was the main exponent. Pt. Ramanath Shastri soon established himself as a learned commentator of Pushtimarg, acted as the Sect's mentor for knowledge base, and wrote several enlightening commentaries on various books, including those written by Shri Vallabhacharya. He would also give discourses on Bhagawata Purana on a regular basis, besides looking after the Balkrishna Library and the Vaishnava School at Mota Mandir. He composed many of his own monumental works relating to Gita, Lord Krishna, Chhandogya Upanishad etc., besides books on philosophy of Pure Non-dualism (Shuddhadvaita) during this period.‚ÄòBrahmasambandh athva Pushtimargiya Diksha‚Äô, Sanatan Bhaktimargiya Sahitya Sewa Sadan, Mathura, 1932.  Interaction with Eminent Citizens and Leaders  While in Mumbai, Pt. Ramanath Shastri was offered the position of Honorary Secretary of the erstwhile prestigious societies like ‚ÄòVidwat Parishad‚Äô, ‚ÄòBrahmavad Parishad‚Äô, and ‚ÄòSanatan Dharma Sabha‚Äô to which he contributed for a long time. He founded an organization called 'Svadharma Vivardhini Sabha', where a series of lectures was organized on the Eleventh day of every month of Indian calendar. His lectures and discourses became so popular that another organization called ‚ÄòArya Svadharmodaya Sabha‚Äô located in Madhav Bagh of Mumbai invited him to deliver his discourses and lectures on Bhagavad Gita also, which were attended by many eminent personalities, including Mathuradas Gokuldas, Krishnadas Natha, Devkaran Nanji, Pt. Hanuman Prasad Poddar, etc. Occasionally at this place, Pt. Ramanath Shastri would interact with National Leaders like Rajagopalachari, Chittaranjan Das and Mahatma Gandhi. His oratory and scholarship brought him to speak at prestigious meetings and conferences of ‚ÄòChatuh Sampradaya Vaishnav Mahasabha‚Äô, ‚ÄòVarnashram Swarajya Sangh‚Äô and ‚ÄòSanatan Dharma Sabha‚Äô also. He was invited to be the convenor of ‚ÄòAkhil Bharatiya Brahman Maha Sammelan‚Äô at Patna around that time.Brajnath Shastri, ‚ÄòDetailed Introduction of Devarshi Pt.

There are two variants to this technique: appliqu√©, where a fabric shape is sewn over a base layer, and reverse appliqu√©, wherein two layers of fabric are laid down, and a shape is subsequently cut out from the upper layer, exposing the lower layer, before both are stitched together. It is one of the products which has been granted Geographical Indication (GI) by the government of India (Application No. 86 and 108). History Pipili appliqu√© work owes its origin to the culture of Lord Jagannath during the 12th century. Earlier appliqu√© umbrellas and canopies were prepared by the Gajapatis for the annual Ratha Jatra of Jagannath. Use Nowadays its usage is more in household, decorative and festival products. The appliqu√© items are mainly used during rituals and jatras of the deities, particularly the colourful appliqu√© cloth covers of the three rathas of the deities during Rath Jatra. Apart from differences in colour the basic design of all three is similar. Appliqu√© work is also used in making pillows, seats and ritual dresses for the deities. Designing The base cloth includes water proof material for umbrellas, velvet for tents, cotton, and threads. Mythical and natural figures are used for the work, including peacocks, ducks, parrots, trees, elephants, creepers, flowers such as jasmine and lotus, the Sun, half-moon, and Rahu (a mythical demon who once who swallowed up the sun). The craft involves embroidering and stitching. For attaching the pieces of cloth the makers use straight stitch, satin stitch, blind stitch, or buttonhole stitch. Sometimes they also make mirror work and many decorative stitches. Pipili village Pipili is a small town, situated about 40 kilometers from Puri, Odisha. The income of this town is essentially dependent on the business of its handicrafts of which the appliqu√© works are the main source. Nowadays, Pipili is globally known as the destination of appliqu√© and is where many workers and workshops continue to practise the technique, creating both traditional and contemporary items. Limca Book of Records Pipili has an entry in the 2004 Limca Book of Records, for the world's largest thematic appliqu√© work. The long work is filled with depictions of India's struggle for independence.

As such, it was noticed by Arnold Carmichael, the director of the neurophysiology unit of the National Hospital. Carmichael persuaded Halliday to come work at the National when he finished his national service in 1953.

Initiated by Ron Tauranac, designed by Geoff Ferris, and built by a team including Nick Goozee (monocoque) and Bob Paton (construction), it was one of the last cars produced by MRD before MRD was closed by the then new Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone. Based on the Formula Two Brabham BT40 (which was also designed by Geoff Ferris) the BT43 featured a modified monocoque that incorporated the triangular cross section pioneered by the Brabham BT42 Formula One car which was designed by Gordon Murray. This distinctive pyramid shape not only kept the aerodynamic \\"stagnation point\\" low but also neatly allowed the incorporation of a \\"crushable structure\\" as required by the 1973 regulations which specified that all fuel tanks were to be protected by deformable structures. Engine and gearbox were the then de facto F5000 standard combination of a Chevrolet 302 cubic inch engine in an unstressed mounting and a Hewland DG300 gearbox. The fitment of these into what was a relatively small Formula Two sized car presented some design challenges. Front suspension components were BT40 while rear suspension components were a combination of Formula One and BT40. Rolled out in October 1973 and photographed by renowned motoring photographer David Phipps; the BT43 was initially tested at Silverstone by John Watson. This initial testing revealed a distinct lack of front end downforce. Racing history 1974 Owing to a combination of factors (not the least of which was the closing down of the MRD side of the Brabham business) the BT43 did not make its debut until June 30, 1974, at round 10 of the 1974 Rothmans F5000 Championship at Monza driven by Martin Birrane. Qualifying 15th in a field of 19 Birrane failed to finish retiring the car on lap 16. Birrane drove the car twice more: round 11 at Mallory Park on July 14, 1974, where he did not qualify; and round 13 at Thruxton on August 18, 1974, qualifying 15th in a field of 19 but again failed to finish retiring the car. This was to be Birrane's last appearance in the car as at the next round (round 14) at Brands Hatch on August 26, 1974, American Brett Lunger drove the car. Qualifying an impressive 7th out of a field of 21 on the Brands Hatch short circuit Lunger unfortunately had an accident on lap 28 of the scheduled 60 laps and retired the car. The BT43 did not make a further appearance in 1974 until the last round (round 18) of the 1974 Championship again at Brands Hatch but this time on the Grand Prix circuit with Chris Craft in the cockpit. Qualifying 13th out of a field of 25 Craft finally registered a result for the BT43 by finishing 7th completing 34 laps one lap down on the final round winner Australian Vern Schuppan driving a Chevron B24/28 for Team VDS. Double points for this final round helped to boost Craft's personal points tally in the series to 67 to finish equal ninth with compatriot Brian Redman. 1975 Round 1 of the 1975 Rothmans F5000 Championship at Brands Hatch on March 15, 1975, on the Grand Prix circuit saw Brett Lunger return to driving the BT43. Qualifying 15th in a field of 21 Lunger unfortunately had an accident on the warm-up lap and failed to start the race. The car did not appear again until round 4 at Silverstone on April 12, 1975, again in the hands of Lunger but this time sporting a new nose taken from a BT42. (This is possibly one source of the BT43 being erroneously described in some publications as a modified Formula One car rather than a purpose built and unique F5000). Qualifying 10th out of a field of 21, Lunger again failed to finish retiring on lap 12 of the scheduled 25 laps. The car made no further appearances in the 1975 Rothmans F5000 Championship. Following its purchase by Chuck Jones in the USA the BT43's next appearance in 1975 was to be at the California Grand Prix which was round 9 of the 1975 US F5000 Championship at Riverside on October 26, 1975. With Jones as the entrant the BT43 was to be driven by Dick Parsons. However the car failed to arrive having been crashed by Parsons in testing. Records of what happened to the car after this and who and where it was repaired are non-existent. 1976 In late 1976 Australian racing driver Kevin Bartlett became aware of the car whilst in the US and tested it at Willow Springs. Impressed by it, he began negotiations to acquire it with the intention of using it in the 1977 Rothmans International Series in Australia. However an agreement was unable to be reached in time for the 1977 series. 1977 The repaired car's next appearance (sporting a new nose) was not in a race but in a motion picture as it was used in the filming of \\"The Betsy\\" during 1977. The car was the open wheel race car of the racing driver character named Angelo Perino played by a youthful Tommy Lee Jones. 1978 Following the conclusion of negotiations between Jones and Bartlett, the BT43 arrived in Australia in early January 1978 to participate in the 1978 Rothmans International Series. In a series dominated by Australian driver Warwick Brown driving a Team VDS Lola T332C with four wins from four starts; Bartlett in the BT43 could not manage a points finish, with sequential results of Retired, 8th, 15th, and Retired. The first round of the 1978 Australian Drivers' Championship at Oran Park on July 30, 1978, proved to be more successful for Bartlett, with a second-place finish behind the McLaren M23-Leyland of John McCormack. This proved to be the highest placing achieved by the BT43 in its career. A distant 5th-place finish in the 1978 Australian Grand Prix at Sandown on September 10, 1978, which formed the second round of the 1978 Australian Drivers' Championship, kept Bartlett in, with a chance of taking the title. The third and final round of the series was run over two heats at Calder on October 15, 1978. However, no points at the final round meant that Bartlett finished the series in a distant third place on 8 points behind the winner Graham McRae in his McRae GM3 on 20 points and second-placed John McCormack in his McLaren M23-Leyland on 12 points. 1979 For the 1979 Rothmans International Series the BT43 was handed over to Colin Bond to drive with Bartlett reverting to his Lola T400. Bond had two points finishes with a 9th at the second round at Adelaide International Raceway on February 11, 1979 and a 4th at the fourth and final round at Oran Park on February 25, 1979. With additional points being awarded for the final round compared with the first three rounds, Bond's points tally was boosted to 14 points which meant he finished the series in a relatively flattering sixth place. Bartlett by comparison finished a lowly fifteenth on 7 points. With the first round of the 1979 Australian Drivers' Championship also being the 1979 Australian Grand Prix held at Wanneroo Park on March 11, 1979 ‚Äì only a fortnight after the final round of the 1979 Rothmans International Series ‚Äì neither Bartlett or Bond made the trip across the continent to contest the Grand Prix. When the BT43 made its next appearance at the second round of the 1979 Australian Drivers' Championship at Oran Park on July 29, 1979, two factors were evident. The first was dramatic modifications to the car primarily to cure the chronic lack of front end downforce exhibited since initial testing and in Bartlett's words its \\"unhealthy transition to spectacular oversteer\\"; while the second was the sponsorship of Bartlett's racing activities by Kerry Packer's Nine Television Network. Modifications included: a new nose (similar to that of the Lola T400); removal of the nose- mounted radiators and replacement with two new radiators mounted on the end of each upper side of the pyramidic monocque; and the change in livery. All of these changes were for nothing however as owing to an engine issue during practice the car failed to start the race. The third and final round of the 1979 Australian Drivers' Championship at Sandown Park on September 9, 1979, proved to be the BT43's final race. One further modification to the car was the addition of a new airbox which again was similar to that fitted to a Lola. Bartlett had taken a deposit on the car and raced it for its new owner. Bartlett was in second place early in the race ‚Äì ahead of eventual second place getter and series winner Johnnie Walker driving a Lola T332 ‚Äì and entering the bridge turn Bartlett had the centre of the right rear Dymag wheel collapse sending the BT43 into the catch fences breaking Bartlett's leg and arm and significantly damaging the BT43. Mystery of whereabouts and confirmation of demise Whilst Bartlett was convalescing, Customs demanded that the duty be paid on the car or that it be exported. The prospective owner who had paid the deposit then sent the car \\"freight on\\" to a friend in the UK who refused to pay the bill. At this point in time (late 1979) all trace of the car disappeared and it was assumed that either the UK Customs or the freight forwarder had disposed of the car at the docks. Questions over the BT43's whereabouts were raised in a thread on The Nostalgia Forum on the Autosport website on October 12, 2004, and it was not until September 17, 2013, that the mystery of its demise was confirmed by a post in the same thread.

In 1147 a monastery of Benedictine nuns was founded on its territory; this was destroyed by fire in 1438. Pope Eugene IV granted indulgences to help the reconstruction of the monastery, but in 1511, the sisters moved to Volterra.

It was staged by command of King Sisavang Vatthana. Launched on 26 July 1971 against the Ho Chi Minh Trail complex and its People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) garrison, Sayasila was planned as a rather complex two phase operation dependent on coordinating two columns containing 4,400 troops with close air support in an attack on 1,100 Vietnamese Communist soldiers. When the assault stalled in mid-August, it was elaborated upon with two additional helilifts of Royalist troops behind the PAVN's mobile garrison. When the Royalist command failed to coordinate tactical movements among its various columns, the PAVN 9th Regiment moved to defeat Royalist aggressor columns one at a time. By 1 September, this Royalist attack had also failed. Bolstered by a fresh regiment of guerrillas as reinforcements, plus support by a minimum of 40 daily U.S. Air Force strike sorties, the Operation Sayasila offensive was renewed on 10 September 1971. It took until 20 October for the Royalists to finally capture their objectives of Salavan and Pak Song. Although the Royal Lao Government (RLG) troops had finally gained their objective, their casualties outnumbered the enemy force they evicted from their objectives. The U.S. government, which was supporting the RLG, placed restrictions on U.S. support aimed at limiting the RLG to defensive efforts. Overview Beginning in 1964, the strategic importance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail became paramount to the People's Army of Vietnam as its key to conquering South Vietnam. Over the next seven years, the Trail expanded to 4,000 miles of road, trail, and waterway. Tchepone in the Kingdom of Laos became a key logistics and transshipment center for the communists. Its importance can be measured by the fact that among the many attempts to cut the Trail, the multi-divisional Operation Lam Son 719 was launched on 8 February 1971 to capture Tchepone.Nalty, pp. 5‚Äì7; 149‚Äì154.Castle, pp. 108‚Äì109. Background Operation Phiboonpol had ended in an indecisive standoff, despite heavy Communist casualties. Military Region 4's (MR 4) Commanding Officer General Phasouk Somly was hesitant to try another attack because of the poor fighting qualities of his troops. However, on 1 July 1971, King Sisavang Vatthana paid a royal visit to Pakse and demanded another offensive.Ahern, p. 416. Thus it was that Pakse Unit of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) planned an offensive into communist territory on the eastern Bolovens Plateau designed to block one of the supply arteries of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Route 23. It would also retake two airstrips while occupying the Bolovens Plateau. The plan was for a two phase operation involving not just troops from Pakse's (MR 4), but also from adjoining Military Region 3 (MR 3). As projected, the Royalist force of 11 battalions numbered 4,000 strong; the opposing three Communist battalions could muster barely 1,100 troops. In phase one, MR 3's guerrillas would be airlifted to capture the Pakse 47 airfield southwest of Salavan at UTM coordinates XC5237. Phase two would be a squeeze play; a mobile force would be airlifted to a position northwest of Paksong, while a column probed eastward toward it along Route 23. The Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) would supply close air support at the rate of two AC-47 and 35 T-28 sorties daily. Belatedly, the planners realized that RLAF support would be insufficient. Three days before the operation's scheduled start, they requested and received a commitment for 12 daily sorties of tactical air for the next month. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) would fly interdiction strikes on the communist lines of communication with fighter- bombers by day and gunships by night. However, USAF support would not be on a dedicated basis; instead it would be diverted as needed. Logistical air support would come from USAF helicopters, RLAF transports, and Air America under contract.Conboy, Morrison, p. 304.Hukle, et al, pp. 1‚Äì5.Anthony, Sexton, p. 346. Not taken into account was the fact that the Royalist columns were not mutually supportive. General Minh, commander of the PAVN battalions, would use this flaw to defeat the Royalists in detail by using his interior lines of communication.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 346‚Äì347. Activities Phase one On 26 July 1971, MR 3's Groupement Mobile 31 (GM 31) stood down from a planned heliborne insertion into Salavan in Military Region 4. It seems that Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird had sent an order down through the Department of Defense to ground the U.S. helicopters. After vigorous protests from the CIA concerning the humiliation of failing to fulfill the King's and the Prime Minister's wishes, the helilift was re-approved. The plea that diversionary operations were already being launched, and that failure to follow through would prejudice Lao military efforts against the Ho Chi Minh Trail carried the day.Ahern, p. 417. Before the next dawn, a Commando Raiders team secured the Salavan airfield in 12 minutes. At 07:00 hours, a 13 helicopter air armada picked up the 1,290 man regiment for the half-hour flight to the airfield. Tactical air cover found no worthwhile targets as the irregular regiment occupied a town vacated by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) by 08:30. At noon, the Royalists controlled the town. Phase one had been accomplished by the afternoon of 28 July 1971.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 304‚Äì305.Hukle, et al, p. 5. The PAVN troops had slipped away to attack the Royalist contingent that had landed northwest of Pak Song. They would return on 25 August to defeat this contingent of Royalists.Anthony, Sexton, p. 347. Phase two =Heliborne assault on Paksong= Phase two fell to MR 4 troops with support via surveillance overflights by Raven FACs. At 09:20 hours on 29 July, Bataillon Volontaires 41 (BV 41) was helilifted out of Pakse and deposited 34 kilometers northeastward to the Bolovens Plateau. Batillion Volontaires 43 (BV 43) joined them later that day. After a patch of ill weather delays in flight operations, Bataillon Infanterie 4 (BI 4) joined them, bringing the Royalist roster to 1,250 troops available. On 30 July, the combined units moved out to the east; their objective was Paksong at UTM XB3377. Nine kilometers northwest of Paksong, they were halted by a PAVN battalion.Hukle, et al, pp. 5, 9‚Äì10. By 6 August, the Royalists were within six kilometers of their objective. On 11 August, they then ran into determined communist counterattacks that drove the monarchists almost back to their landing zone. On 25 August, the Royalists made another attempt at taking Paksong. They were counterattacked by three PAVN battalions at 1330 hours. By dark, the scattered Royalist forces had suffered 32 dead, 39 wounded, and 192 missing in action. PAVN casualties were estimated at 100 killed. After this thrashing, the three Royal Lao Army battalions were then ordered south to Ban Phakkout.Hukle, et al, p. 10. Three battalions of guerrillas were pulled from training to plug the gap left by the retreating Royalist regulars; a fourth battalion was posted to fill the force out to regimental size. =Push along Route 23= Meanwhile, on 30 July two Forces Arm√©es Neutralistes (FAN) battalions moved east along Route 23 for the squeeze play. They were supported by four armored cars and backed by a Thai mercenary artillery battery. With tactical air strikes and howitzer fire clearing the way, the Neutralists were in Ban Gnik by evening. However, there they met opposition and halted.Conboy, Morrison, p. 305. Reinforced by Bataillon Infanterie 7 (BI 7) from MR 4 and Bataillon Infanterie 9 (BI 9) from MR 3, the Royalists pushed on down the road, gaining Ban Phakkout on 6 August 1971. MR 4 had a Thai mercenary task force assigned; it now forwarded four battalions to Ban Phakkout. On 8 August, BI 7 and BI 9 moved further east until they came up against entrenched North Vietnamese regulars. The FAN battalions moved up to help the Royalists. There followed a ten-day standoff, ended when the communists brought heavy weapons on line. On 18 August, under heavy weapons fire, the two Neutralist and two Royalist battalions scattered to the southwest. With both prongs of the Royalist offensive thwarted, it was time to regroup. Regroup and restart The original plan of attack was elaborated upon. The new plan called for three Royalist and two Thai mercenary battalions to push down Route 23 toward Vietnam. The push on Paksong would be carried out by a pair of converging columns. Two battalions each of Thai mercenaries, Royalist regulars, and Neutralists were helicoptered to a landing zone south of Paksong, with orders to capture it. Four battalions of Royalist guerrillas were lifted to another landing zone to assault Paksong from the northwest for a coordinated attack.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 305‚Äì306. The revamped offensive restarted on 21 August. The drive up Route 23 came up against a PAVN bunker complex blocking the road. While most of the tactical air sorties assigned to the operation struck the bunkers, they failed to dislodge the Communists. The two Royalist columns converging on Paksong failed to synchronize their actions. As a result, the PAVN 9th Regiment could fight them in turn. First, it scattered the four Royalist battalions south of them into the bush, and pushed the two Thai battalions back toward Ban Phakkout. Then it intercepted the four guerrilla battalions five kilometers northwest of Paksong. It struck them so hard the four battalions were evacuated for refitting. By 1 September, the failure of this Royalist offensive was evident. Presented with the choice of making another try at capturing Paksong quickly before the rainy season closed down military activities, or waiting until next dry season, the planners of Sayasila decided to ask for help with the former. They garnered a commitment of 40 or more daily sorties of tactical air support from the U.S. Air Force for Sayasila through 25 September. Instrument flight rules target boxes containing no friendly forces were delineated so radar- directed bombing in them could occur despite unfavorable weather. They also managed to persuade neighboring MR 3 to loan them another guerrilla regiment, Groupement Mobile 32 (GM 32) to continue the assault. Once again, the two objectives were taking Paksong and opening Route 23 towards the Vietnamese border.Conboy, Morrison, p. 306.Hukle, et al, p. 13. =Paksong= On 10 September, a pathfinder unit of Commando Raiders secured a landing zone six kilometers east of Paksong. GM 32 landed to be greeted by sniper fire. The Royalist regiment advanced despite a glancing engagement with the PAVN 9th Regiment that caused 33 Royalist casualties. By the next morning GM 32 had secured a position on the Phou Theveda high ground athwart Route 232, four kilometers east of Paksong. The following day, 12 September, a levy of 670 reinforcements cobbled together from three different commands were flown into a landing zone seven kilometers southeast of Paksong. They attacked northwards to back up GM 32. On 13 September, GM 32 repelled PAVN counterattacks.Ahern, p. 419. At 2330 hours 14 September, forward elements of GM 32 captured Paksong. The PAVN 9th Regiment, threatened from the south, east, and west, withdrew to the northeast along Route 23 on the 15th. A few PAVN soldiers still remained secreted in Paksong for GM 32 to grub out. Seven kilometers from town they posted a rear guard to fortify a hilltop position overwatching the road. Leaving another contingent in the agricultural research station, the 9th retreated toward Thateng. Political pressure from Vientiane was being brought to bear on the operation's commanding officer, as the Royal Lao Armed Forces had suffered almost 1,000 casualties in the past two months in MR 4.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 306‚Äî307. =Route 23= On 11 September, the Thai mercenary artillery battery opened fire from Ban Gnik, immobilizing the Communists further east on Route 23 with a barrage of 500 shells. GM 32 moved east along the road with close air support clearing the way. By the 13th, all five of the Thai howitzers had been shifted forward to more effective firing positions at Ban Phakkout. Four Thai mercenary infantry battalions pushed toward an agricultural research station along Route 23. They just missed intercepting the retreating 9th PAVN Regiment. On the 20th, the Thais began a three-day struggle to gain possession of the agricultural research station alongside Route 23. Once it was gained on the 23rd, howitzers were moved in. Phase one revisited On 28 August, GM 31 were replaced at Salavan by BV 41. This freed GM 31 to advance 20 kilometers west along Route 16 before moving south to capture Lao Ngam on 2 September. BV 41 occupied the vicinity for more than three weeks, but uncovered few enemy supply caches. At about the time BV 41 was due to be withdrawn, the 927th PAVN Battalion moved in close enough to begin mortaring GM 31. When BV 41 received orders for a fresh offensive instead of relief, 130 soldiers deserted and returned to Pakse.Conboy, Morrison, p. 307. GM 31 was moved to a quiet village ten kilometers away. General Thao Ty convinced them to hold their position until 6 October. He promised relief by FAN battalions. When on the day only four FAN companies showed up, the remainder of GM 31 abandoned their positions. Denouement The pincer movement of the original Sayasila plan had bogged down after GM 32 took Paksong. It would not progress until 18 October, when the regiment advanced westward from Paksong in response to Communist shelling of the Paksong airstrip. Thai mercenary troops further east on Route 23 pushed toward GM 32, and the pincers finally met on 20 October. Leaving the Thais in charge of Route 23, GM 32 returned to occupy Paksong. Operation Red Arrow On 26 October, a Thai mercenary battalion swept south and east of Paksong, reoccupying the Phou Thevada high ground. Operation Phou Xang Another Thai battalion swept northwards from Paksong, occupying the high ground at Phou Nongkin. Results Operation Sayasila ended on 31 October 1971. The Royal Lao Armed Forces suffered 136 of its troops killed during the offensive, and 302 wounded. PAVN losses were estimated at 170. However, the Royalists had won the airstrips at Salavan and Paksong. This cleared the way for two follow- up offensive moves, Operation Bedrock and Operation Thao La.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 307‚Äì308. However, with a Royalist casualty list that outnumbered the PAVN opposition, it was a dubious victory. Eight Royalist battalions had been rendered unfit for service. The CIA's Chief of Station in MR 4 believed that the failure of Sayasila resulted from several Royalist weaknesses. He blamed the Royalist regulars for poor battle performance. He believed the new commanding general did not yet have a strong command relationship with his subordinates. He also noted that the extensive slow-paced movements by the Royalists gave the PAVN a lot of time to scout out intelligence about the Royalists.Ahern, p. 418. Given that the American plan for waging the Laotian Civil War was a defensive one, the American ambassador had run counter to policy by approving an offensive drive.Castle, pp. 2, 55. This provoked a reaction from his superiors. The short notice request for additional USAF tactical air support had brought about a directive on 18 August that requests for tactical air support for a planned operation had to be submitted at least ten days in advance. In reality, the process would take 20 to 30 days.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 347‚Äì348. The directive, issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and agreed to by both the CIA and the State Department, required coordination of planned operations with both 7th Air Force and CINCPAC. These requirements were meant to limit offensives under the guise of coordination. Aftermath By New Year's Day 1972, although Pak Song remained in Royalist hands, Salavan had been recaptured by the PAVN. The Communists still controlled the eastern Bolovens Plateau as a territorial shield protecting the Ho Chi Minh Trail.Ahern, p. 419. Notes References * Ahern, Thomas L.

The house was built in approximately 1850 and was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 2 October 1970. The house is situated in the historic Indre by neighborhood on Frederiksgade, close to the City Hall.  History  The house was built in 1850 by the architect Anton Gert Monrad for Michael Herskind who was a prominent merchant and politician at the time. Michael Herskind was a member of the city council between 1848‚Äì1860, vice president of the city council between 1848‚Äì1854 and president 1854‚Äì1860. He also held positions as the city representative in the housing commission, budget commission and school commission at different times. Herskind belonged to one of the older merchant families of the city and after spending some years in Hamburg and London he established himself in Aarhus with an import business. The building consisted of the main building constructed by Herskind and two other wings; a half- timbered back building from 1726 which was renovated by Herskind during construction of the main building and another smaller building facing the street. When Herskind left the property the buildings was owned by a series of merchants who expanded the property at different times. In 1865 a connection was constructed between the main house and the south-wing and in 1858 a low north-wing was built. In 1907 a missionary hotel was established in the building. In 1919‚Äì1924 the hotel was bought by a local factory owner who turned it into a regular hotel. During this period artworks from many artists such as Peder M√∏rk M√∏nsted and P.S. Kr√∏yer accumulated in the hotel that had become a popular destination for tourists. The hotel lasted until 1977 when the building was bought by Aarhus Municipality which thoroughly renovated it. The building became home to different administrative departments under the city until the building was put up for sale in 2010 and bought by an NGO.  Architecture  The main structure is a 3 story classicist and empire style building with mansard roof with prominent dormer windows. The facades are plastered and painted beige or off-white with red window frames.

Biography  Papa√Øoannou was born in Lamia, Greece, but grew up in Athens. She studied at the Technical University and developed an interest in photography. With the outbreak of World War II, she began to photograph social subjects and continued to do so for the duration of the German and Italian occupation of Greece. She turned her camera to troops departing for the front line, and to the casualties of war, raising awareness of the various humanitarian issues arising out of the occupation. As Athens suffered a starvation crisis, Papa√Øoannou photographed emaciated children, providing an account of the horrors of war on the civilian population.The National Herald, Voula Papaioannou: Photographer of Life in Greece during the War, 29 October 2017. After the liberation, Papa√Øoannou became a member of the photographic unit of the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), touring the Greek countryside recording the hard conditions of rural life. Papa√Øoannou's attention toward the hardships of the Greek population was not in the least romantic or touristic, but instead honestly portrayed them as proud and independent, optimistic for the future despite poverty.Benaki Museum, Voula Papaioannou (1898-1990) Photography Papa√Øoannou worked in the social documentarian tradition of photography. Her work reflects the dominant representational paradigm of 'humanist photography' prominent in postwar Europe.Hamilton, Peter.

Brian Shanley, O.P and athletic director Bob Driscoll. Athletic campus This facility was constructed next to the schools state of the art men's ice hockey facility (renovated in 2013) as part of an initiative to provide the schools athletic teams with the facilities to meet the needs of the ever-growing ambitions and successes and consolidate the schools athletic facilities into one large athletic campus. The stadium completes the lower half of the athletic campus, which houses men's and women's ice hockey programs, men's and women's soccer, men's lacrosse and women's tennis. Anderson Stadium / Chapey Field was constructed on the former site of the women's softball stadium, student parking facility, and the college tennis facility. Prior to moving into Anderson, the soccer team had previously played on Glay Field (which has since been converted into the new state of the art home to the women's softball program and a new parking facility) and the lacrosse team had previously played on Lennon Family Field (which has since been converted into the home to the women's field hockey program).

With winning the 2015 NCAA Men's Hockey National Championship, 2014 NCAA Women's Cross Country National Championship, 2014 BIG EAST Men's Basketball Championship, reaching the 2015 NCAA Men's Soccer Final Four, and reaching back-to-back men's basketball NCAA Tournaments, the college's athletic and academic future was bright, bringing the pride and investment of the alumni base to drive the continued success. Projects that had already been completed to that point were the construction of Concannon Fitness Center and Lennon Family field, and renovations of Alumni Hall, Schneider Arena and the Dunkin Donuts Center, and succeeded by the investment in the construction of the Friar Development Center. =Mike & Maura Chapey '86= In April 2014, Providence College Athletics announced the largest gift from an individual who is not a member of the board of trustees in the history of Providence College Athletics.

Built in 1897-98 by the Bennington and Rutland Railroad, it is the only Richardsonian Romanesque railroad station in the state of Vermont. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, and since then housed a restaurant, which closed in 2018. Description and history The former Bennington Railroad Station stands just northwest of Bennington's downtown, at the southwest corner of Depot and River Streets. The building is oriented at an angle to the intersection, paralleling the former route of the tracks, which formed a triangle with the two roads. It is a rectangular single-story stone structure, with an apse at its southern end, and a projecting rectangular entry section (formerly a porte-cochere) on the longer easterly facade. Unused railroad tracks lie just to the west, and a modern addition extends to the south, providing additional restaurant seating capacity. The former agent's office projects on the track side of the building. Bennington's early railroad service was limited to the village of North Bennington, about north of the downtown. In 1854 a branch line was run from North Bennington to serve the town center, and a wood frame depot was erected by the Bennington and Rutland. In 1897, its depot in decline, the railroad commissioned local architect William C. Bull to design a replacement. The present building was completed the following year. Its design bears significant resemblance to the station designed by H.H. Richardson for Wellesley, Massachusetts (now demolished), and is the state's only instance of a Richardsonian railroad station. Passenger service to downtown Bennington was discontinued in the early 1930s, and it is not known how long freight service continued. The station building was sold into private hands in 1966, and it was converted into a restaurant in 1970. The modern extensions to the south were made in 1986. The restaurant closed in 2018.

It is the type species of the genus Datonglong. Discovery and naming In 2008, a team from the Shanxi Museum of Geological and Mineral Science and Technology in the Kangdailiang quarry in Shanxi discovered the jaw of a euornithopod. In 2016, the species Datonglong tianzhenensis was named and described by Xu Shichao, You Hailu, Wang Jiawei, Wang Suozhu, Yi Jian, and Jia Lei. The generic name refers to the city of Datong and the Chinese word long (Èæç), which means ‚Äúdragon‚Äù. The specific name refers to its origins in Tianzhen county. Datonglong was one of eighteen dinosaur taxa from 2015 to be described in open access or free-to-read journals. Description The holotype, SXMG V 00005, consists of a portion of the lower jaw with some preserved teeth. The fossil was found in a layer of the Huiquanpu Formation. Though the exact time the fossil was deposited is unknown, it is believed to date from somewhere in the Cenomanian-Campanian timeframe, roughly 95 to 80 million years ago. Datonglong was described as a new genus because of its unique dental structures. In the middle and back of the jaw are two functional teeth in each tooth position. Further, the main ridge of the tooth on the inner side is situated more to the back, while the secondary ridge is well developed. There are no further vertical ridges. The top of the tooth crown is bent slightly backwards. The only known fossil of dinosaur's dentarium has a length of and contains at least twenty-seven tooth positions, though it is believed it may have possessed up to twenty-nine tooth positions. The processus coronoides is vertically oriented. The teeth are large, standing up to for a tooth not yet broken out. Teeth stand in groups of three or four in the tooth battery. Classification Datonglong is in the Hadrosauroidea clade, and is closely related to, but not part of, the Hadrosauridae family. However, this placement is not based on an exact cladistic analysis.

The film stars Zachary Spicer, Wrenn Schmidt, Danny Glover and John C. McGinley. The film was released on September 8, 2017, by Broad Green Pictures. Plot Three Catholic priests live in a rectory together. Young Father Daniel runs daily and lost his father in the past year. Father Ollie really likes food and is a big fan of Indiana University basketball. More elderly Father Victor is completely devoted to the church with little outside interests. He finds comfort in setting up the candles and the church for mass by himself in his own specific way. They eat together, set the weekly schedule for baptisms and church services and run the general work of the church. They also discuss scripture, their proposed homilies, and the meaning of God in their lives. One Friday night young Father Dan meets Jane through the confessional box. She tells him she is a musician and is dying. She is new to the church thing but over the weeks they become friends to the point of playing \\"battleship\\" in the confessional. Jane explains how she wants to die but changes her mind at times. Dan gives her a gift of a Bible after a night of Bingo and she is offended. She invites Dan to hear her sing at her coffee house and he goes. One night they reverse roles and she wants him to unburden himself. He tells her that he is happy to be a man of God and help people but he does not see God. They become friends. Throughout the movie each priest gives a sermon. Dan teaches that death gives meaning to life. Enjoy life now for we all die. Father Ollie teaches on compassion. We all need compassion that means to suffer with another. We need to comfort the sick and be there with the dying. Father Victor preaches that no one sees God but he lives inside each of us. God is love. You find God in the love of man. God, love, and man are one. One night Father Dan invites Jane over for dinner at the rectory. Father Ollie is enjoying the food cooked by Dan. Serious Father Victor wants to know what Father Daniel's primary passion is. A Priest has a duty to Christ and cannot be fooled by young love. Jane, offended, leaves. Victor asks Daniel if he has lost his faith; Father Daniel says no, that he never had faith until he met Jane. He has helped her not be alone. By loving her and helping her as a friend he is loving God. He now sees God. Cast * Zachary Spicer as Father Daniel * Wrenn Schmidt as Jane * Danny Glover as Father Victor * John C.

Work Beddington was born in Winchester and studied at the City and Guilds of London Art School and at Central St Martins College. Beddington's work investigates the intersection between the historical and the contemporary, often in relation to journeys and migration. Beddington is interested in traces in the landscape, the power of the collective voice and walking as a means of affirming presence. Her works in film and video, as well as in fragile or ephemeral media such as etched glass and silverpoint drawing, present a minutely scrutinised sense of place that offer a poetic reading of the overlap between the historical, the mythical and the everyday, potentially opening up a space to future scenarios. Beddington's work has been shown in many museums, galleries and film festivals including: City States, Liverpool Biennale; Les Rencontres Internationales, Centre Pompidou, Paris and Reina Sofia Museum, Madrid; Eastern Standards: Western Artists in China, MASS MoCA, USA; FIDMarseille International Film Festival; LOOP film and video festival, Angels Gallery, Barcelona; Vanishing Point, Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, Ohio.

After the unexplained death of his wife Drogo fled England, supposedly for Flanders, and disappears from history. His land in England subsequently became the property of Odo, Count of Champagne. Biography Much of what is known about Drogo de la Bouerer is known from the Domesday Book and chronicles of Fountains Abbey and of Meaux Abbey. According to the Domesday record after the conquest Drogo held lands in and was lord of all of Holderness, holding dozens of manors there; he also held land in Lincolnshire and was lord of Castle Bytham, Little Bytham, Anwick, Ruskington, Carlton-le-Moorland, Barrow-upon-Humber, Goxhill, and Great Limber; in Norfolk he was lord of Saxlingham, Bessingham, North Barningham, Hindringham, Burgh-next-Aylsham, Erpingham, and Gissing as well having other possessions there; he was lord of Chadstone, Northamptonshire; and lord of Oakley, Suffolk, and also had land in Sotherton, Suffolk; and in Cold Overton, and Hoby, Leicestershire. Drogo acquired his lands primary from the holdings of Morcar of Northumbria, also from Ulf son of Tope. The Cistercian writers give very similar accounts. In the Chronica Monasterii de Melsa (Chronicles of Meaux Abbey), Drogo is said to have been from Flanders. - he was rewarded by William of Normandy after the conquest with the Ilse of Holderness, and was the builder of Skipsea Castle. Drogo poisoned his own wife, possibility by accident, after which he visited the King asking permission to return to Flanders, and borrowed money from him, and then left the country by sea. According to William Camden his wife was the King's niece, and he killed her by poisoning. On discovering the lie King William sent for Drogo to be arrested, but he was never caught, and subsequently Drogo's possessions in Holderness were passed to Odo, Count of Champagne. Odo became Lord of Holderness sometime before September 1087.

The concept of graph edit distance was first formalized mathematically by Alberto Sanfeliu and King-Sun Fu in 1983. A major application of graph edit distance is in inexact graph matching, such as error-tolerant pattern recognition in machine learning. The graph edit distance between two graphs is related to the string edit distance between strings. With the interpretation of strings as connected, directed acyclic graphs of maximum degree one, classical definitions of edit distance such as Levenshtein distance, Hamming distance and Jaro‚ÄìWinkler distance may be interpreted as graph edit distances between suitably constrained graphs. Likewise, graph edit distance is also a generalization of tree edit distance between rooted trees. Formal definitions and properties The mathematical definition of graph edit distance is dependent upon the definitions of the graphs over which it is defined, i.e. whether and how the vertices and edges of the graph are labeled and whether the edges are directed. Generally, given a set of graph edit operations (also known as elementary graph operations), the graph edit distance between two graphs g_{1} and g_{2}, written as GED(g_{1},g_{2}) can be defined as : GED(g_{1},g_{2}) = \\\\min_{(e_{1},...,e_{k}) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}(g_{1},g_{2})} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} c(e_{i}) where \\\\mathcal{P}(g_{1},g_{2}) denotes the set of edit paths transforming g_{1} into (a graph isomorphic to) g_{2} and c(e) \\\\ge 0 is the cost of each graph edit operation e. The set of elementary graph edit operators typically includes: :vertex insertion to introduce a single new labeled vertex to a graph. :vertex deletion to remove a single (often disconnected) vertex from a graph. :vertex substitution to change the label (or color) of a given vertex. :edge insertion to introduce a new colored edge between a pair of vertices. :edge deletion to remove a single edge between a pair of vertices. :edge substitution to change the label (or color) of a given edge. Additional, but less common operators, include operations such as edge splitting that introduces a new vertex into an edge (also creating a new edge), and edge contraction that eliminates vertices of degree two between edges (of the same color). Although such complex edit operators can be defined in terms of more elementary transformations, their use allows finer parameterization of the cost function c when the operator is cheaper than the sum of its constituents. A deep analysis of the elementary graph edit operators is presented in And some methods have been presented to automatically deduce these elementary graph edit operators Applications Graph edit distance finds applications in handwriting recognition, fingerprint recognition and cheminformatics. Algorithms and complexity Exact algorithms for computing the graph edit distance between a pair of graphs typically transform the problem into one of finding the minimum cost edit path between the two graphs. The computation of the optimal edit path is cast as a pathfinding search or shortest path problem, often implemented as an A* search algorithm. In addition to exact algorithms, a number of efficient approximation algorithms are also known. Most of them have cubic computational time Moreover, there is an algorithm that deduces an approximation of the GED in linear time Despite the above algorithms sometimes working well in practice, in general the problem of computing graph edit distance is NP-complete (for a proof that's available online, see Section 2 of Zeng et al.), and is even hard to approximate (formally, it is APX-hard).

Potential threats are first spotted by cameras and analyzed in real-time by software algorithms based on predefined criteria. Once an event has been identified by the software, a security officer located in a remote center is then alerted to analyze the threat and take appropriate action immediately to prevent or minimize damage from occurring. These actions can include a verbal warning to the perpetrator via two-way radio from the center or reporting the event to local law enforcement. Remote guarding adds a layer of human verification to automated security systems that results in reducing false alarms to almost 0% by having trained agents review each alert before taking action. This service along with changes to how the alarm industry handles alarms, such as second call verification, continue to reduce the false alarm burden on local law enforcement.  Compliance with Bureaus & Law Enforcement Agencies  Remote guarding is considered by some as the next innovation in traditional man- guarding, which is when licensed security officers are placed on site to observe and report any suspicious activities per The Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (BSIS), which has jurisdiction over the private security industry. The authority is derived from Division 3, commencing with Section 7580 thru Section 7588.5, Chapter 11.5, Private Security Services Act in the Business and Professions Code (B&P;). Because remote guarding is relatively new to the security industry, organizations and agencies are still working on bringing standards to remote guarding services in respect to previous traditional security mediums. In October 2016, Underwriter Laboratories (UL) issued the first certificate of compliance for remote guarding through the use of command and control in accordance to the requirements outlined in UL 827B and UL 827 to Elite Interactive Solutions, LLC. of Los Angeles, California.  Adaptation of Remote Guarding  Traditional security guard companies, as well as a new breed of security companies that focus specifically on Remote Guarding, have emerged to help secure facilities that include property types such as automotive dealerships, multi-family residential housing, office buildings, office parks, warehouses, distribution centers, and many other locations where security is set up to monitor and protect property and people. However, a new breed of security companies that are exclusively focused on remote guarding have approached the traditional security industry differently by forgoing the inclusion of man-guarding and designing systems and hiring/training agents specifically to solely provide remote guarding services. While not in direct competition with Remote Guarding Robert H. Perry and Associates reports a trend that Contract Security Companies are starting electronic security divisions or teaming with companies that specialize in electronic security. According to the report, customers are replacing security officers with electronic security, or enhancing security coverage by using security officers and electronic security devices.

Impact on high-status individuals  In most cases, white males are classified as the high-status due to the privilege men receive in society. Due in part to this privilege, white males do not show any implications of solo status in field cases. In fact, Heikes (1991)Heikes, E. J. (1991). When men are the minority: The case of men in nursing. Sociological Quarterly, 32, 389-401. found that white male nurses who experienced solo status reported a positive experience and were privy to special treatment that frequently lead to an earlier promotion than their female counterparts.  Impact on low-status individuals  In psychological studies, low-status individuals are represented by women or minorities (ethnic or race), who consistently perform worse in recall or when answering questions in group situations.Thompson, M. & Sekaquaptewa, D. (2002). When being different is detrimental: Solo status and the performance of women and racial minorities. Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, 2(1), 183-203. Kanter (1977) Kanter, R. M. (1977). Men and women of the corporation. New York: Basic Books. found that observers remembered what solo status individuals‚Äô stated better than nonsolos, and were judged more critically than their majority counterparts. These critical judgments were worsened by the circumstance, as solo status is most frequently seen in contexts that impact the solo status individuals‚Äô social and economic welfare.Thompson, M. & Sekaquaptewa, D. (2002). When being different is detrimental: Solo status and the performance of women and racial minorities. Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, 2(1), 183-203.

It was supported by Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. History An early illustration of the cottages The original Prince Albert's Model Cottage, also known as the Prince Consort Model Lodge, was built by the Society for Improving the Conditions of the Labouring Classes (SICLC) for display at the 1851 Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London. Prince Albert, who had considerable interest in improved housing for the poor, was president of the Society. The Society wanted to have the model dwelling built on the Exhibition grounds, but the Exhibition commissioners were unwilling to have an exhibit that addressed such social issues. With the intervention of Prince Albert it was agreed that the building could be constructed close to, but not on, the Exhibition grounds, and this was done at the Knightsbridge Cavalry Barracks. At the conclusion of the Great Exhibition the cottage was dismantled and rebuilt in Kennington. By one estimate over 250,000 people visited the cottage, including Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens. The final room visited contained pamphlets and books on model dwellings, as well as the architectural plans for the building through which the visitor had just walked, together with plans of other model dwellings built elsewhere by the society. Design The model cottage was designed by Henry Roberts, who was honorary architect to the SICLC, and, like the Prince Consort, was interested in upgrading housing for the working class. The cottage demonstrated at the Great Exhibition was possibly conceived as a model for larger blocks of flats (designs for a three- storey version were prepared). It was designed to house four families, with two flats, or apartments, on each level. Roberts indicated that the design was aimed at ‚Äúthe class of mechanical and manufacturing operatives who usually reside in towns or in their immediate vicinity‚Äù. Each flat had a living room, with a built-in cupboard heated by the fireplace that was also \\"well contrived equally to cook the family meals at midday and to warm the feet of the family group at eve\\", a kitchen/scullery, three bedrooms and a toilet. Bathrooms were not usually provided in houses built in England at this time. Three bedrooms were included for the sake of \\"decency\\" so that children of different sex would not have to share a room. The most notable external feature was the covered central staircase to give access to the two upper flats. Hollow bricks were used for construction of the building. These were claimed to be sound resistant, damp resistant, non-porous, and cheap to make. The internal face of the walls was smooth and plastering was considered unnecessary. The original Prince Albert Cottage, in Kennington Subsequent developments Although built outside the main Great Exhibition area, the Prince Albert cottage exhibit was awarded one of the 170 Council Medals, the Exhibition‚Äôs highest award. The design provided a catalyst for further work on model buildings and Roberts and the Society circulated several publications on the topic, including ‚ÄúThe Dwellings of the Labouring Classes‚Äù. In 1852 the cottage was rebuilt in Kennington Park, south of the River Thames, and housed two park attendants and a cottage museum. Subsequently it was occupied by the park superintendent and since 2003 has been the headquarters of the Trees for Cities charity. The design was used in several other locations, including Stepney and Kensington in London and Abbots Langley and Hertford, both in Hertfordshire. However, despite benefiting from the abolition of Britain's brick tax in 1850, and while a success with the public, the cottages were not a commercial success, although the Spectator had calculated that a return on capital of between five and seven percent per annum would be possible. The innovative use of hollow bricks was also never widely copied.

It is the third film adaptation of the novel, following the 2013 original Dutch version Het Diner by Menno Meyjes and the 2014 Italian film I nostri ragazzi by Ivano De Matteo. The film stars Richard Gere, Steve Coogan, Laura Linney, Rebecca Hall, Chlo√´ Sevigny, Charlie Plummer, Miles J. Harvey and Adepero Oduye. The film had its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival on February 10, 2017, and was theatrically released on May 5, 2017, by The Orchard. Plot On a snowy evening in Dobbs Ferry, history teacher Paul Lohman, his wife Claire, Paul's Congressman brother Stan, and Stan's wife Katelyn meet up for an organized dinner at a luxury restaurant that Stan has booked for the four of them. Paul and Claire are shown talking before dinner and it's clear they're close, and they discuss their son Michael, who is closer to Claire than Paul. Paul and Stan are painted to have a contentious relationship. Stan, the front runner for Governor, is accompanied to dinner by his personal aides. They're there to keep him briefed on the votes needed for an important bill he's trying to push through the House on the subject of mental health, and they frequently interrupt his meal. Paul is annoyed by Stan and takes every opportunity to let everyone know. An incident is shown in flashbacks during the meal of Paul and Claire's son Michael and Stan and ex-wife Barbara's children Rick and Beau (an adopted son) as they try to get home following a party. It transpires during the course of the film‚Äîorganized under chapter headings following the stages of the meal‚Äîthat the four are there to discuss that incident involving their children. At that incident, they encountered a homeless woman trying to sleep in the ATM they try to enter to get money for a cab home. Michael verbally and physically harassed her, while Rick and Beau looked on. While taunting her, Michael dumped a garbage pail full of paper on her, and threw lit matches on her sleeping bag, which caught fire and killed her. Beau left the scene before this occurred, but witnessed that this was an unprovoked attack. Over the course of the dinner, tensions run amok among the group intercut with flashbacks that view the dysfunctional family's past, and Stan's attempts to help Paul in his depression. The arguments grow tense as they clash on whether the boys should take the blame or to simply cover up their wrongdoing. In another flashback, it's shown that Claire's bout with cancer unhinged Paul. In present day, Paul finds out that there's a video of the woman's death online that Beau uploaded after he found it on Michael's computer. Michael even refuses to delete the video, causing a schism between him and his father. Paul also is shocked to find that not only does Claire know about the incident (which he thought he was keeping secret from her), Claire is colluding with Michael in a scheme to pay out thousands of dollars in hush money to Beau. After Stan and his wife offer to look after Michael while Claire is in the hospital, Paul becomes angry and accidentally hits him over the head with a saucepan. At the dinner, Stan makes it clear he wants to withdraw from the gubernatorial race and hold a press conference about the ATM incident, afterwards accompanying his son to the police. A bitter argument ensues between Stan on one side and Claire and Katelyn on the other, with Paul sitting quietly away from the table. Katelyn manages to persuade Stan to hold off on his plan. Paul, broken and unstable, leaves the restaurant for Stan's house looking for Beau, believing that the solution to the problem is to kill Beau, and a violent confrontation ends with Paul threatening to hit Beau over the head with a rock. However, Paul is confronted by an enraged Stan, frantically looking for Beau, alongside Katelyn and Claire. While Katelyn tries to phone Beau, a call comes in to Stan's aide that the votes needed for the mental health bill are secure. The film ends on an abrupt note as Paul collapses and croaks out \\"Mental health for everyone!\\" as the others move beside him in the snow.

Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing: \\"Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Steve Coogan, and Rebecca Hall make a riveting quartet in Oren Moverman's adaptation of the Herman Koch novel about a dark-hearted dinner gathering.\\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire also gave the film a positive review, writing: \\"The Dinner mostly works so long as it stays at the table, and the unresolvable source of anxiety in play suggests that on some level, the meal never ends.\\" Boyd van Hoeij of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, writing: \\"By trying to keep the prolonged sit-down affair from becoming excessively stagey, Moverman adds too many distracting flashbacks to maintain the original's hard-hitting and well-aimed gut punch.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:2017 films Category:2017 crime drama films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:American nonlinear narrative films Category:American remakes of Dutch films Category:Films directed by Oren Moverman Category:Films with screenplays by Oren Moverman Category:Films based on Dutch novels Category:Films shot in Pennsylvania Category:Films set in Amsterdam Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:The Orchard films Category:Vertigo Films films Category:Icon Productions films ","title":"The Dinner (2017 film)"},{"id":"49270293","text":"Wally McNamee (1932‚Äì2017) was an American photojournalist.

She has been described as a pioneer of ambient and minimalist music. Early career and Mkwaju Ensemble Takada graduated from Tokyo University of the Arts and began her musical career as a percussionist with the Berlin RIAS Symphonie-Orchester in the mid-1970s. She became dissatisfied with the Western classical musical tradition and returned to Japan to study African drumming and Indonesian gamelan, as well as the early minimalism of Steve Reich and Terry Riley. She channeled these influences into the group Mkwaju Ensemble which she formed with Joe Hisaishi, Yoji Sadanari, Junko Arase and Hideki Matsutake. Mkwaju Ensemble released two albums in 1981, Mkwaju and Ki-Motion, and she also performed on recordings by Toru Takemitsu and Satoshi Ashikawa around this time. Through The Looking Glass Takada recorded her first solo LP Through The Looking Glass in three days in early 1983. She performs all parts on the album, with diverse instrumentation including percussion, marimba, gong, reed organ, bells, ocarina, vibraphone, piano and glass Coca-Cola bottles. The album was not commercially popular upon release, but became a collector's item in the late 2010s thanks to online sharing through YouTube and other sites. The album was reissued on vinyl and CD in 2017 and has been hailed as \\"mesmerizing\\" and an \\"ambient minimalist masterpiece\\". Pitchfork awarded the album 'Best new reissue' and it became the second best-selling release of 2017 on Discogs. Further collaborations, Tree of Life and recent career Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Takada performed in various ensembles, composed for theater director Tadashi Suzuki and taught at various universities in Tokyo. She also performed with the improvisational group Ton-Klami and collaborated with pianist Masahiko Satoh (Lunar Cruise) and Ghanese percussionist Kakraba Lobi (African Percussion Meeting), but did not record another solo album until Tree of Life in 1999. There was a resurgence of interest in Takada's work following the reissue of Through The Looking Glass and she has since performed extensively across Europe, the United States, Australia, Israel and Japan. She also recorded two new collaborative releases, Le Renard Bleu with electronic artist Lafawndah and An Eternal Moment with saxophonist Kang Tae Hwan.

History  View of northern part of Pomorska ca 1907 The axis has since long been the path linking Bydgoszcz to ≈öwiecie, , hence its name on one of the first recorded maps from 1800,1800 map-Bromberg. - Specieller Plan der K√∂nigl. preuss.-an der Brahe-Flus liegenden Handlungs und Haupt-Stadt Bromberg in Netzdistricte, nebst ihrer umliegenden Gegend im Jahr 1800, mit der Busole nach Schritte / aufgenommen und gezeichnet durch den Lieutenant von Lindner \\"Der weg nach Schwetz\\" (The road to ≈öwiecie). In fact, this path was an historical thoroughfare, existing before Gda≈Ñska Street, much like the way Dworcowa Street came to existence. During the second part of the 19th century, the growing extension of the city led to the shaping of the avenue, called Rinkauerstra√üe under Prussian rule. In 1867, with a new territory extension of the city, the whole street was comprised within the municipal area. Its northern tip \\"Verl√§ngerte Rinkauerstra√üe\\" (Extended Rinkauer street) was the location of Prussian army barracks, :Plan der Stadt Bromberg, 1876 the Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 148 was part of the 41st Division in the pre-World War I organization. After the end of World War I and the rebirth of Poland, the street has been renamed \\"Pomorska\\" in its southern part and \\"Szczeci≈Ñska\\" in its northern part (old Extended Rinkauer street),Plan Miasta Bydgoszczy, 1933 where the 61st Infantry Regiment () was billeted. During World War II, Nazi authorities renamed the avenue Robert Ley Stra√üe.StadtBaurat map Bromberg, 10.VIII.1941 At the end of the conflict, the street got back its original calling, along its whole length.1945 Plan Miasta- Zarzad Miejski w Bydgoszczy  Main places and buildings  Alexander Timm House at 17 Gda≈Ñska Street, corner with Pomorska Street Built in 1852 by B.

In 1908, a drugstore run by Dr Aurel Kratz opened there: he was also selling goods for cameras until World War I. He then moved to Friedrichstra√üe. The building is on a triangular footprint plot, a challenge for the designer. It displays a nice bay window on the corner facade. The first floor windows, around the bay-window are more adorned than others with flanking pilasters topped with corbels and a frieze of ornaments. The second floors windows are capped by triangular pediments and have also small corbels and pilasters. The 3rd level openings are only flanked by clean pilasters and pediment topped. A line of designed corbels runs beneath the roof.

At this time, it was one of the first habitation building to be erected in the street. Wilhelm √üiehl had the tenement rebuilt in 1895 to accommodate more tenants. The facade, renovated in 2015, displays features of Neo-renaissance style: symmetry, recurrent motifs such as vegetal garlands and pediments on first level windows, series of corbels supporting the roof, thin topping frieze. Openings at ground floor have an ornamental decor repeating all along their frame.

Present corner was located at Rinkauerstra√üe 4/Buchholzstra√üe 1. The facade, renovated in 2015, reminds of the realizations of Fritz Weidner, a fertile architect in Bydgoszcz between 1897 and the 1930s. He designed famous houses in the city, such as in Gda≈Ñska Street (No.28, No.79, No.34), in ≈öniadecki Street (No.2). The house presents forms of German historicism, in a transitional phase between the eclecticism and secession style. Both elevations are purposefully designed on asymmetry, as a means of architectural expression, like the gables' shape, the only bay window in the corner or even the location of the entry gate. Care have been put in the adornment of the latter, in the complexity, both, of the door itself and the rich ornament framing the gate.

In 1910, a restaurant was run there by Christian Rollauer. In 1923, the building renovated by families Rodziewicz√≥wna and Grzymala-Siedlecki was the first place to house a charity kitchen managed by the Union of Poles from the Eastern Borderlands (). Its goal was to help the displaced Poles victims of the borders changes after the Peace of Riga with USSR. After 1925 the kitchen, led by Anna von Helmersen, living at Jan and Jƒôdrzej ≈öniadecki Street No.12, moved to Cieszkowski Street No.17. Today, the tenement houses among others, associations Wujek Porada and Siedlisko, helping out people with alcoholism problems. Among corner buildings of Pomorska Street, this house stands out as it is not built according to a rectangular, but a triangular footprint (like the tenement at No.1): J√≥zef Swiecicki met the requirement, perfectly creating a neo-baroque building skillfully closing the junction with Podolska street. The richness of the architecture echoes those displyed on other tenement by the same architect in the city, such as the Hotel \\"Pod Orlem\\" from 1896 or the Tenement at Freedom Square 1 from 1898. In particular some elements are to be underlined: \\\\- balconies on Pomorska facade with wrought iron balustrade; \\\\- lion masks motifs on the corner of the house; \\\\- angel faces with wings ornamenting all facades. The facade giving onto Podolska street has got more Neo-renaissance features.

In 1904, Ignace Sergot, a painter, moved there from Jan and Jƒôdrzej ≈öniadecki Street No.13; he lived there until the middle of the 1920s. This corner building displays various architectural elements of decoration on its facades, from triangular and half-circled pediments, to pilasters flanking the window openings, from discrete balustrades to prominent corbels under the roof. Worth mentioning are the two massive balconies overhanging streets crossing, with salient balusters and consoles.

In 1925, Mr. Jasiemicz, a master painter, lived there: the firm he worked for was established in 1835.Advertising in the \\"Adresy Miasta Bydgoszczy na rok 1925\\" The facade displays typical features of Art Nouveau architecture: simplified motifs, wavy shapes, floral ornaments. This elevation echoes facades from architect Erich Lindenburger one can find on Dworcowa Street, at No.45 and 47 (both from 1906). A recent refurbishment of the house has given it back its colors and architectural details.

He lived at No.12. The facade displays many architectural details: \\\\- a gate flanked with pilasters with corbels; \\\\- 1st floor windows topped with curved pediments, adorned with vegetal motifs; \\\\- 2nd floor windows feature rectangular pediments, with ornaments.

In the interwar years, it was the address of a painting firm \\"Jasiewicz i Syn\\" (Jasiewicz & son), run by Martin Jaciewicz. Their neighbor was Friedrich Steinborn, a tailor. The building, though in bad shape, keeps some remnants of its initial architectural cachet: symmetry of the facade, recurrent motifs such as vegetal garlands and pediments on first level windows and slight avant-corps to underline the frontage.

At that time, the numbering of the street was still echoing the old Prussian one, even though street names changed (from \\"Rinkauerstra√üe\\" to \\"Pomorska street\\"): hence the address of the cabaret at No.12, now No.19.

The architecture reflects main features of end of 19th century Eclecticism, so present in the streets of Bydgoszcz (e.g. Dworcowa Street, Gda≈Ñska Street). One can notice a lot of motifs adorning windows, those on the first floor are topped with triangular pediments containing angel faces. Corbels are present on the second floor and at the top of the facade, supporting the roof.

The architecture of No.20 mirrors somehow the one of the tenement across the street at No.18: main differences are located on the corner with a grand pediment crowning the top and a large bay window-balcony over the main entry. The topping pediment has a globe with the house completion date.

The elevation is remarkable by its care of symmetry: * On the first level, windows alternate triangular and arched pediments, with recurrent scrollworks in cartouche beneath; * The second floor ornamentation is more simple, with decorative motifs topping the windows; * A corbel table crowns the facade.

It then was the workshop in the 1900s of a locksmith, Albert Pohl. After 1920, on the ground floor was located the workshop of Piotr Malinowski, a tailor: his name is still visible above the current shop showcase. Nice elevation, underlined by bossage and arched windows on the ground floor. Pediments topping first level windows are adorned with delicate vegetal ornaments.

He was selling delicatessen, wine and spirits. Initial address was Rinkauerstra√üe 18. Georg K√∂rnig, another retailer, had his business -a hardware store- at this place. The tenement elevation reflects nascent features of Art Nouveau in Bydgoszcz, echoing similar buildings, such as in Dworcowa Street or Vienna Secession house in Gda≈Ñska Street. The facade does not show wavy shapes (apart on the gable), typical in Art Nouveau, but its decoration boasts other architectural details: * Long vertical lines, stressed by the bay window; * Friezes, displying vegetal motifs, including small scenes with animal figures, architecture symbols (trowel and hammer) and building completion date (1912); * cartouches with ornaments and corbels.

It dates back to the same period, i.e. the 1910s. The specificity of this edifice is that, albeit it lost a majority of its architectural details, superb Art Nouveau ornaments are still preserved: * A stylized eagle above the entry gate, * Motifs on the first floor, * Vegetal decoration on the second floor, wavy shapes as a frieze on top.

A carpenter, Ernst Klawonn, was landlord of both edifices (30 & 32) after the turn of the 20th century. The building echoes closely the one at No.28, offering a sort of continuity in the facade decoration. One will notice: * the main gate, topped by a figure of bearded man, * the right side of the elevation, underlined by pilasters, adorned cartouche and the figure of a spread-wing eagle overlooking a coat of arms on the second level. * a series of cartouches and corbels below the roof line.

At the beginning of the 20th century, a carpenter, Ernst Klawonn, was landlord of both No.32 and 30. He developed in the 1920s a furniture and woodwork workshop at the place. The building's facade lost all its decoration. One can still notice two kernel dormers and a bell shape gable. The door still displays the former street number (55) from the Prussian era, kept until the end of the 1920s.

A thorough refurbishment has been carried out in 2015 by a real estate firm. Architecturally, the facade echoes the style of corner house with Podolska street, at the southern part of Pomorska street. The fa√ßade of the building is decorated with reliefs, floral stucco ornaments and putti. Arched windows, loggias, balconies flanked by massive columns richly adorn the elevation. One can underline the detailed low-relief of Demeter with Cupid as a putto on the first floor, testifying to the wealth of original owner (H. Schulz): as a baker, the image of the goddess of corn, grain, and harvest could be the only patron.

Bydgoszcz 1998 The temple has been used by the local congregation of Baptists since its inception at the crossing with Cieszkowskiego Street. Until 1945, a majority of goers were German. Neglected by years of war, the church needed urgent repair that came only in 1966‚Äì1968, when a thorough renovation of the building was made possible with a financial support of the World Council of Churches. This refurbishing encompassed roof, repainting of the interiors and the modernization of the design on the architecture model of temples in Protestant countries. The new building, dedicated in November 1968, became at the time the most modern Methodist Church in Poland. The temple is a three-nave chapel flanked on its front by two towers topped with steep pyramidal roofs. Neo- gothic elements can be noticed when looking at the huge, arched windows, the fascias and the portal. Some Italian themes are included in the display of the rose window in the facade and the geometrical frieze running at the top of each tower, beneath the gable. Initial designs did not plan any traceries for side windows, lessening the architectural harmony of the edifice. The chapel has got a dedicated place for the choir. The presbytery still houses the original baptismal pool, but it is no more used. In some parts of the temple one can notice Romanesque architecture influence. A four-storey living area, covered with a low-pitched roof has been added on the north-west part of the temple. The church has appreciable acoustics and its decor and furnishings made it considered as the most modern among the Polish Methodist Churches.

Finally, for financial disputes, the project has been carried out by Karl Bergner in place of Weidner. The construction of the building was completed in 1899. The ground floor was devoted to shopping and restoration retail and upper floors for housing.

The corner elevation displays an avant-corps as well as the facade onto Cieszkiewski street, which is also enriched with a two-storey bay window. The corner, capped by a spired roof lantern, is flanked on the top with triangular gables with dormer windows. The second floor bay-window is an open arcaded loggia supported by Ionic columns.

Fromm.) the current building was built on behalf of Adolf Haase, a railway engineer, who moved there one year after its completion in 1904. The facade features elements of Art Nouveau details, with its curved shape of the gable or the gate, as well as the presence of thin pilasters flanking middle windows up to the top. However, Art Nouveau ornamentation can not be detected further on, other than rudimentary pediments. We rather discover lean elevation rid of motifs, characterized by vertical lines, simply decorated balconies, typical of early modernism.

Thanks to a recent restoration in December 2014, the facade now boasts its original style. Few motifs are voluntarily displayed: an elaborate ornament above the entry gate and five eyebrow dormers on the roof. The balance of the elevation is granted by a small balcony in the centre, balanced by two grand bow window on each side, both of which are topped by a balcony.

In 1933, the place accommodated a factory of wholesale flours and breads, \\"Panis\\", then a bakery owned by Jozef Krajnik until the war. After World War II, Zygmunt Ciupek took over the place and run a candy factory, Danuta, in the courtyard, which was soon merged into a local cooperative. Since 1990, a bakery, \\"Cemak\\", is anew located there. The building echoes houses at No.27, with the ornamented gate with floral motifs (in the Art Nouveau style), but also house at No.52, by the absence of facade decoration and its lean forms.

Studies of homeless pet owners in urban settings show a sense of identity and community connection between pets and their owners. This topic is part of the Animals and Society branch of study in the field of Sociology, and is also an issue with the values and responsibility of pet ownership.  Impact on the homeless experience  Homeless woman with dogs, Haight Street, San Francisco, CA One factor behind the actions of homeless pet owners is the fear and anxiety over the loss of their pet. This anxiety is explained in a theory by Clinton Sanders, who notes that a close relationship with a companion animal shapes the construction of the owners‚Äô identity, and forms the basis for interaction. The owner and the pet are united in a 'couple' relationship which is socially defined. He notes that people link the animal and the owner and have a set of expectations regarding how they will act. In public animals serve as social facilitators and encourage openness to the point where strangers feel welcome in approaching the human-pet couple. This relationship is supported by Irvine in her description of the \\"Pack of Two\\" designation of the homeless owner and their pet. The combination of the anxiety for the pet, and the close emotional relationship between the owner and the pet, shapes the homeless experience.  Social interactions  Several studies have concluded that the homeless attribute their pet with saving their life, getting them off of drugs or alcohol; one researcher noted that many dog owners reported their dogs knew when they were sad or emotional, an example of the ‚Äòempathetic experience‚Äù of a human-pet connection. Homeless pet owners use their pets to facilitate socialization,Christophe Blanchard (2015), Homeless people with dogs: what can be learned from the animals' names?, Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris. getting their owners out to local vet clinics and parks where they interact with other pet owners. Many homeless pet owners regard their pet with a high degree of attachment and report lower levels of loneliness with pet ownership.  Sobriety  Leslie Irvine argues pet ownership prompts many to act responsibly, with many making a deliberate choice not to drink or use drugs, and to avoid contact with substance abusers or those involved in any criminal activity for fear of being separated from their pet. Additionally, many refuse housing in shelters if their pet is not allowed to stay with them. Homeless pet owners will not sleep in shelters that do not allow pets, they will pass on the opportunity for housing if they cannot take their pet, and they will sacrifice their meal if food is limited. The role of caregiving to their pet is constructed as their primary reason for being in life. The pet is dependent on them for food and care and this gives the owner a sense of responsibility and a positive self- image and self-worth.  Shelter  As a group the homeless pet owners put pet ownership first before accepting housing or shelter, employment, leisure activity, or health care, themes identified by Irvine and Sanders. These themes were earlier identified in research among the homeless in San Francisco in 1994 by University of California at Davis researchers Aline and Robert Kidd. Similar themes were identified in research conducted in Canada by Michelle Lem, Director of Community Veterinary Outreach in Ontario, Canada. These pet owners described the ways their pets shaped their environment: they would sleep outside in the rain if the only option was shelter in a no pet shelter; their pet kept them off drugs and alcohol, and they avoided risky behavior that might result in arrest and incarceration because they feared their pet would be removed or euthanized. They also reported that they gave up going to social events at arenas or other public areas where pets were not allowed for fear their pet would be taken from them. The ways in which their pets shape their daily decisions also carries over to the level of involvement of homeless pet owners in the local community.  Implications for social institutions  Social interaction among the homeless is impacted by pet ownership. Many homeless pet owners reported that having a dog facilitated conversation, but at the same time having a dog had a negative impact on their ability to find housing because homeless shelters, rental housing, and subsidized government housing continue to have strict regulations against allowing pets to reside with their homeless owners. Some action is being taken by social institutions to address the issue. San Francisco initiated a program which addressed both homelessness and animal shelter overcrowding: WOOF ‚Äì Wonderful Opportunities for Occupants and Fidos. Started in August 2012, the homeless are given a dog that would otherwise be euthanized, to foster until a permanent home can be found. The homeless are trained to care for the dogs and will receive a weekly stipend. In addition to dog training lesson, the foster owners received training in job readiness, communication skills, banking and health care. All pet food and care is provided by the shelter. Pets of the Homeless is a national nonprofit with a mission to feed and provide basic emergency veterinary care to pets of the homeless. In the UK, Veterinary surgeons and registered veterinary nurses have responded to the issue by creating a charity called Streetvet which provides free accessible veterinary care. Volunteer veterinary professionals provide a weekly outreach service and a 24/7 emergency service to clients in need. https://www.streetvet.co.uk/ See also *Overpopulation in domestic pets *Street dogs *Abandoned pets  References   External links  * Pets of the Homeless: 2015 Annual report Category:Pets in the United States Category:Homelessness Category:Street dogs Category:Animal welfare ","title":"Pet ownership among the homeless"},{"id":"49270456","text":"Shinkai Zahine Karokhail () is an Afghan politician and rights activist, focusing mainly on the political representation of women and the protection of vulnerable children.

It is represented at present by fragmentary ruins, but is part of an archeological site, including a Roman amphitheatre and museum in central Brescia. History The temple was built in 73 AD during the rule of emperor Vespasian. The prominent elevated location and the three identifiable cellae, each with their own polychrome marble floor, all help confirm that this temple would have represented the capitolium of the town, that is the temple dedicated to the Capitoline Triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. The Capitolium replaced an earlier set of temples, a \\"Republican Sanctuary\\", consisting apparently of four discrete temples that had been erected around 75-90 BC, and refurbished during the reign of Augustus.Brescian Parco Archeologico, official website. The three cellae of the capitolium have been rebuilt, and the walls of the left cella are used as a lapidarium to display local epigraphs found during the 19th centuries. In front of the cellae, are the partially reconstructed remains of a portico, which was composed of Corinthian columns that supported a pediment with a dedication to the Emperor Vespasian. The complex, and other Roman ruins are located at one end of Via dei Museii, once the original Decumanus Maximus of Brixia, which coursed some 5 meters below the present street level, and along the route of the .

She went into politics in 2007 with the Social Democratic Front (SDF), the main Cameroonian opposition party and was then elected into the municipal council of Douala I. In 2010, she resigned from SDF following a divergence over strategy and declared her intention to run for the 2011 presidential election on October 23, 2010. On April 30, 2011, she was elected as the president of the Cameroon People's Party (CPP) and party candidate for 2011 presidential election. Kah Walla is the CEO of the firm STRATEGIES!, a Leadership and Management consulting firm which she founded in 1995. She was recognized in 2007 by the World Bank as one of the seven influential women entrepreneurs in Africa, and was counted among the 150 women who move the world by Newsweek.  Family  Kah Walla was born on February 28, 1965 in Ibadan, Nigeria. She originates from the North west Region,one of the two anglophone regions of Cameroon, more precisely from Bali Nyonga from her father and from Pinyin from her mother. Her father, John Solomon Walla, before his death was Director of a consulting firm owned by John Ngu Foncha and Salomon Tandeng Muna, then Inspector General, Director of Shipping in Douala and finally representative of Cameroon at Ministerial Conference of West and Central African States on Maritime Transports in Abidjan. Her mother, Grace Ebako Walla, now retired holds two doctorates: one in public health and one in health education; she led the NGOs CAMNAFAW (Cameroon National Association for Family Welfare).Ici Les Gens du Cameroun, d√©cembre 2010, √©dition Groupe Millenium, p.10. Kah is single with seven adopted children.  Education  Walla began her primary education in the American School of Yaounde. She continued her studies in the Ivory Coast Academy of Bouake in Ivory Coast. After graduation, she got admitted into Howard University in Washington where she obtained her B.Sc in zoology and studied for a Master of Business Administration in 1990.  Political career   Entry into Politics  Walla says her family has always been a source of motivation and inspiration for her in the political field. She gained experience over the years with the support of one of her colleagues in the SDF as they wrote the last Speech for the SDF chairman Ni John Fru Ndi during his campaign in 1992. She was an adviser and a trainer to the party until 2007, when she decided to officially join the party and was elected councilor in the city of Douala. In 2010, she stood against party's decision forbidding its militants from taking part in the ongoing voters' registration. She was later accused of lack of accountability in the management of party funds, On 23 October 2010, she resigned from the SDF and announced her candidature for the 2011 presidential election She was elected as the president of Cameroon People's Party on April 30 th, 2011, succeeding Samuel Tita Fon who founded the party in 1991.  Candidate in the 2011 presidential election  In 2010, Walla held a press conference to announce her decision to exit the SDF party and run for the 2011 presidential election. She separated from the SDF by resigning. And some time later, she joined the CPP and became president in April 2011. She explained later that the party for which she had campaigned for since its creation no longer shared the same ideals that, particularly with regard vision for the presidential election. She is generally referred to as the first woman to ever run for the presidential election in Cameroon. To attract the maximum possible of young people prior to presidential elections, she encouraged registration on the electoral lists in the country. The awareness campaign has enabled her to address more than 500,000 Cameroonians within a very short time. She stood for the presidency along with 22 other candidates including Paul Biya, John Fru Ndi . She campaigned under the slogan \\"Kah Walla 2011 - The Time is Now\\". She was ranked 6th out of the 23 candidates, with 0,72% of the vote, at the end of the election which was won by incumbent President Paul Biya. Anglophone Crisis In March 2019, she aroused controversy and criticism among many Anglophone Cameroonians for remarks that she made during a panel discussion at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. She was speaking at an event titled \\"Crisis in Cameroon.\\" Sitting alongside the Institute for African Studies Director, Jennifer Cooke, and R. Maxwell Bone, and a student at the university who had spent time in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon. She made comments accusing the Anglophone Secessionists operating from diaspora of lies and hypocrisy. The remarks that she made elicited agreement from Jennifer Cooke and R. Maxwell Bone and subsequently went viral on social media. This led to criticisms of the fellow panelists of being biased and opposed to Anglophone Secession, and accusations that she wanted to become a minister in the current government of Paul Biya. She, along with the two other panelists said that the comments were taken out of context, and that she and Bone and Cooke alike were critical of the Cameroonian government during other portions of the panel. Following the panel, both she and R. Maxwell Bone were subjugated to death threats, and intimidation from individuals affiliated with the Ambazonian cause. This was particularly worrisome to R. Maxwell Bone who works extensively with NGOs in Anglophone Cameroon. Kah resides in Douala, so the threats were not deemed as an immediate danger to her. As of the summer of 2019, they continue to be the subject of threats, misinformation, and intimidation. Claims have been made that this shows the true nature of Ambazonian secessionists, a claim that secessionists deny.

Higher quality chestnut flours for use in cake preparation may be white, rather than darker in coloration, the latter of which could be due to the chestnuts being incompletely peeled prior to grinding.

He has served as CEO of both private and public organizations, as a board member, corporate director, and private equity investor as well as a Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Graduate School of Public Administration. Early life and education Berger was born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His father, Saul Berger, was a politically active lawyer who ran for State Senate and City Council as an anti-Tammany candidate. His mother, Paula Rosenzweig Berger, held a two-year term as a Democratic co-leader in the district. Berger attended New York City public schools, and graduated with Honors in Science from Stuyvesant High School in 1955. He went to college at Brandeis University and graduated magna cum laude with honors in history in 1959. He also attended the University of Chicago on a fellowship to the Department of Political Science from 19591960. Entry into politics Berger entered the political arena to work for the Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy presidential campaign in 1960. In 1964 he ran underdog Jonathan B.

Carey (19751982) as a planning specialist and later served as New York State Commissioner of Social Services and Member of the Board of Social Welfare. In 1976, during New York‚Äôs financial crisis, Carey appointed Berger to become the Executive Director of the New York State Emergency Control Board for the City of New York, which reviewed the city‚Äôs $12.5 billion budget and designed a plan that enabled the city to reenter the credit markets and eventual financial recovery. New York University, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the Carter administration, 19771985 New York University After leaving the Emergency Control Board in late 1977, Berger became a professor at the Graduate School of Public Administration at New York University, teaching part-time there for over 6 years.

In early 2005, Governor George Pataki selected Berger to chair the New York State Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century. This commission (often described as the Berger Commission) resulted in the first major restructuring of New York's health- care delivery system. In its final report, issued in November 2006, it called for consolidations, closures, conversions and large-scale restructurings. In the end, nine institutions closed and 48 restructured, in many cases over the objections of health care executives, politicians and community residents. He was also a Member of the Governor Andrew Cuomo's Medicaid Redesign Team during 2010‚Äì2011. He chaired the Health System Redesign Group, which proposed a restructuring of Brooklyn's Hospitals and Primary Care Facilities.

Quotes On Berger‚Äôs work as Chairman of the New York State Commission on Health Care Facilities: \\"Given his history as someone who is sent in to do difficult jobs that no one else wants to do, we think he‚Äôs coming in with his knives sharpened.\\" Mr. Berger (‚Ä¶) whose name has rarely appeared in print without words like \\"sharp\\" and \\"aggressive\\" appended to it‚Äîis among the first to acknowledge that he is a fiscal tough guy. \\"I am,\\" said Mr. Berger (‚Ä¶) and then qualified himself a bit. \\"'Tough' is a very strange word,\\" he said. \\"I have a reputation of being honest with people, asking questions, and being willing ultimately to say what I think. I don‚Äôt think that's particularly tough. I think that's particularly what you need to survive in the world.\\" In an interview with Crain‚Äôs New York, he spoke about reforming Medicare and said: \\"(‚Ä¶) we refuse to face the issues related to the last 180 days of life. Often the terminally ill are kept alive through major interventions, and the process of dying is prolonged unnecessarily. We are not dealing with the needs of the dying, but the assumptions and needs of the living. That is not fair. It is also wrong morally, and massively expensive.\\" When people suggested after the George Washington Bridge scandal that it might make sense to break up the enormous organization of which he'd once been head, Berger said: \\"It could be simpler and cleaner if you separated the different parts of the Port into individual agencies. It would also be insane.\\" Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch once said of him: \\"Twenty years ago, if you had a conversation with Steve Berger you couldn‚Äôt get a word in edgewise. Now if you have a conversation, he allows you to speak for 10 minutes out of each hour.\\" Personal life Mr. Berger married Cynthia Wainwright on September 24, 1977. She is President of the Board of the Churchill School in New York City and serves as President of The Bridge, a mental health agency. They have two daughters, Robin and Diana.

MacNutt was highly influential in Vatican circles and was a close friend to three popes, Leo XIII, Pius X, and Benedict XV, and also to Cardinals Rafael Merry del Val and Mariano Rampolla, both Cardimal Secretaries of State. His influence was also known in the Austrian Imperial Court, where he established close ties with the imperial family including Empress Zita. He was offered Austrian nobility as a baron but quietly refused the distinction. At the Vatican, he worked to find solutions to the \\"Roman Question\\" which kept the Vatican and the Kingdom of Italy apart following Italy's seizure of the Papal States in 1870. In 1903 MacNutt bought a small castle for himself and his wife, \\"Schloss Ratzotz\\" as a summer home at Bressanone/Brixen in what is today northern Italy. MacNutt's 1912 translation from the Latin of Peter Martyr's De Orbe Novo (1530) was an important work of scholarship that modernized, moderated and improved on its only other translation into English, that of Richard Eden from 1555. In 1926, the year before his death, he wrote his autobiography, a two volume privately printed text, which was later edited by Father John Donovan and published in 1936 as A Papal Chamberlain: The Personal Chronicle of Francis Augustus MacNutt. The preface was written by G.K. Chesterton and the foreword by Patrick Joseph Cardinal Hayes, Archbishop of New York. It was published by Longmans, Green and Co. He died of cancer on December 30, 1927, at Schloss Ratzotz, two years before the Vatican and the Italian Kingdom established diplomatic relations which saw the establishment of the Vatican as an independent sovereign state based on much of his ideas and work. He was buried in the graveyard of Santa Maria am Sand in Millan near Bressanone in the largely German-speaking province of South Tyrol, Italy. His headstone makes no mention of his Papal titles or accomplishments. He was buried in the habit of a Third Order Lay Franciscan.

A remake of Roth's 2002 film of the same name and the fourth installment in the Cabin Fever series. The film stars Samuel Davis, Gage Golightly, Matthew Daddario, Nadine Crocker, and Dustin Ingram. The film was released on February 12, 2016 by IFC Midnight. Eli Roth, writer and director of the original film, acts as co-writer and executive producer. The film received negative reviews. Plot A forest- dwelling hermit discovers his dog has died from a mysterious illness and is sprayed by its infected blood. Five young friends, Paul, Karen, Bert, Jeff and Marcy have rented a cabin in the same woods for a week-long vacation. The group stops for supplies at Priddy's General Store. Dennis, the intellectually-disabled son of the store manager, unexpectedly bites Paul's hand. At the cabin, Jeff and Marcy have sex, Paul and Karen share a kiss while sunbathing and Bert ventures into the woods with a rifle. Bert encounters and accidentally shoots the hermit. Though initially concerned, he panics when he realizes the hermit is infected with a disease and flees. He says nothing about the incident to his friends. Later that evening, while the group hang out around a campfire, a stranger who calls himself Grim and his dog, Dr. Mambo, gatecrash their evening. The group seem very hesitant about letting him stay, but warm up to him after he shares marijuana with them. Later that night, the infected hermit comes to the cabin in search of help. Bert slams the door in his face and the desperate man tries to steal the group's vehicle. A conflict ensues between the hermit and the five friends, during which they accidentally cripple their car and set fire to the hermit. He runs off into the woods, presumably to his death. The next day, Jeff and Bert head out in search of help. They encounter a farmer who offers to help them, but hastily leave when they discover that the hermit is her cousin. Meanwhile, Deputy Winston arrives at the cabin to investigate reports of the previous night's commotion. Paul explains things without mentioning the hermit's presumed death. Winston promises to send a tow truck before departing. Dr. Mambo returns to the cabin without Grim and seemingly infected. He threatens Paul and Bert, before Marcy scares him off with the rifle. While Paul and Karen make out, they discover that Karen is infected with the flesh-eating virus and her leg has started to decay. Fearful of contagion, the others lock her in the shed. Paul leaves on foot to find help, but the only people he encounters chase him away, mistaking him for a peeping Tom. The following morning, the group's attempt to evacuate is botched when Karen vomits blood all over the interior of the car. Bert drives back to the general store alone and Jeff abandons everybody and flees to a remote shack. Marcy and Paul lament their poor chances of surviving and make passionate love, believing they won't live long enough to regret it. They later discover marks on Marcy's back that reveal she, too, is sick. At the general store, Dennis bites Bert's hand just as he did with Paul. His father, Tommy, lashes out at Bert for exposing his son to the virus, and he and his friends chase Bert down in order to contain the disease. While once again searching for help, Paul encounters the severely-burnt hermit in the lake. Surprisingly, he is still alive and he attacks Paul, only for Paul to fend him off and finally kill him. Marcy draws a bath and shaves her legs, causing the infected flesh to gruesomely peel from her body. She stumbles outside in distress and is mauled to death by Dr. Mambo. Paul returns to the boat shed where Karen begs him to kill her. His gun is empty and since he's unable to finish the job of splitting her face with a shovel, Paul sets the shed on fire and watches in horror as Karen is completely burned alive. Bert makes it back to the cabin, but he is followed and shot dead by Tommy. Paul recovers Bert's rifle and guns down Tommy and his two accomplices. Paul escapes in Tommy's truck, but crashes it into a tree and explodes. Covered in blood, Paul stumbles upon a small campfire party attended by Deputy Winston. Winston receives a radio call from the sheriff ordering her to shoot Paul on sight. However, Paul convinces Winston to let him go instead. The next morning, Jeff returns to the cabin. He finds his friends' corpses, but rejoices in having survived the ordeal himself. He's then gunned down by Deputy Winston. Paul succumbs to infection and drops dead in the woods. Dennis discovers his corpse. Back at the cabin, authorities and a hazmat crew clean up the scene.

The film was supposed to be filmed back-to-back with Cabin Fever: Patient Zero, but these plans eventually fell through and the idea of a remake was formed. Writing The film uses the same script as Roth's original, although director Travis Zariwny trimmed the page count from 134 to only 92. Zariwny also discussed and incorporated aspects that Roth wanted to include in the original but wasn't able to. One change is that Deputy Winston, a male (portrayed by Giuseppe Andrews) in the first and second films, is now played by a female (portrayed by Louise Linton). Zariwny claimed he made this choice because \\"There was no way for me to emulate Giuseppe's performance.\\" Filming Principal photography took place in Portland, Oregon in February 2015. Release In September 2015, IFC Midnight acquired North American distribution rights to the film, The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on February 12, 2016. Critical reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rare approval rating of 0% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 2.52/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"No need for a quarantine -- enthusiasm for this inert remake is not contagious.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 14 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Geoff Berkshire of Variety gave the film a negative review writing: \\"It's little surprise that Roth himself is the exec producer of this nearly beat-for-beat redo. Who else would feel as much passion for the middling material? And who better to ensure the copy does nothing to improve on the original? The silver lining of a day-and-date limited theatrical and VOD release is that there's no chance this repurposed dud duplicates the original's commercial performance.\\" Glenn Kenny of The New York Times also gave the film a negative review, writing: \\"Who benefits from the existence of this film? Certainly not the largely bland ensemble of post-adolescent actors cast as the leads, who here can scarcely be called characters.\\" Home media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 5, 2016. In Australia, it was released on April 28, 2016. The film was released on DVD and Blu-Ray Disc on June 27, 2016 in UK and Ireland with the behind of the scenes feature.

Early life and education Kathleen Blackshear was born June 6, 1897, near the Texas Cotton Belt in a city called Navasota, Texas. Being that she was the only child of Edward Duncan Blackshear and May (Terrell) Blackshear, she spent much of her youth on cotton plantations owned by members of both her mother's and father's families near the town of Navasota. Her childhood friendships with the children of African-American field workers strongly influenced her later career. Blackshear graduated from Navasota High School in 1914 and showed an early aptitude in art at an early age. After graduating high school, she attended Baylor University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in modern languages in 1917, after which she went to New York to study at the Art Students League. Her teachers at the ASL included Solon Borglum, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent DuMond. She left New York in 1918 and spent the next six years traveling around Texas, California, and Europe and taking odd jobs, including hand-coloring films and designing film posters in Los Angeles. In 1924, Blackshear took up her art studies again, this time at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), where she studied with John Norton, Charles Fabens Kelley, William Owen, and art historian Helen Gardner who throughout her time at SAIC became a lifelong friend. She studied painting and graphic arts and later received her master's degree from SAIC in 1940. Teaching and illustration work In 1926, Blackshear began teaching art history and studio courses at SAIC to help support herself and continued to do so until retiring in 1961. She was known for mentoring African-American artists, including Margaret Burroughs, and for introducing her students to African and Asian art through field trips to local collections. While at SAIC, Blackshear supplied the analytical drawings for two of Helen Gardner's books, Art Through the Ages (1926)‚Äîone of the earliest American art history textbooks to incorporate non-Western art‚Äîand Understanding the Arts (1932). She also supplied illustrations for Katharine Kuh's Art Has Many Faces (1951). Through their shared interest in non-Western art, Blackshear and Gardner have been credited with being key influences on the distinctive style of postwar Chicago artists. Art career Influenced by various strains of Modernism including Post-Impressionism and Cubism, Blackshear developed a range of styles with bold, simplified forms and rhythmic or patterned elements often featuring strong diagonals and tilted planes. Her paintings are reminiscent of Regionalists such as Thomas Hart Benton and modernists like Fernand L√©ger, while her whimsical abstract drawings evoke Paul Klee. During the height of her career, between 1924 and 1940, African Americans were the central subjects of her work, and she became known for depicting them with warmth and clarity but without sentimentality. In 1939, critic C. J. Bulliet called her ‚ÄúChicago‚Äôs most sympathetic, most understanding painter of the American Negro.‚Äù Blackshear also made two dioramas for the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. During her lifetime, Blackshear exhibited her work at regional museums such as the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Delgado Museum of Art (New Orleans, LA). She had her first solo museum show in 1941 at the Witte Museum in San Antonio, TX. Personal life Although she lived in Chicago, Blackshear kept a studio in Houston and often spent the summer in Navasota. Blackshear's life companion was the artist Ethel Spears, whom she probably met at SAIC and who died in 1974. Blackshear died Oct. 14, 1988, in Navasota. Legacy Blackshear's work is in the collections of the Modern Art Museum (Fort Worth, TX), the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, the Art Institute of Chicago, and other institutions. Blackshear was the subject of a 1990 retrospective at SAIC entitled \\"A Tribute to Kathleen Blackshear.\\" Her papers and those of Ethel Spears are held by the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art in Washington, D.C.

They stole a utility van in Los Angeles from a private seller, and a taxicab, taking the driver hostage, and drove to San Jose. One inmate, Bac Duong, went along with the hostage driver back to Southern California and surrendered to police in Santa Ana on January 29. The other two inmates, Hossein Nayeri and Jonathan Tieu, were arrested in San Francisco on January 30. Multiple people were arrested for allegedly aiding the inmates to escape, including a jail teacher. Suspects Hossein Nayeri, 38, is a suspect (along with three others) of torture and kidnapping charges for the October 2012 abduction of a marijuana dispensary owner from his Newport Beach home. During the abduction, the suspects drove the victim to the Mojave Desert, burned him with a blowtorch, and cut off his penis, in an attempt to obtain information about hidden money. Nayeri then fled to Iran, where he has relatives, and was arrested at an airport in Prague, Czech Republic. He was extradited back to Orange County to face charges in the torture case. He has military experience from serving in the United States Marine Corps. Jonathan Tieu, 20, and Bac Duong, 43, are believed to be associated with Vietnamese-American street gangs. Tieu, an alleged Tiny Rascal gang member, is suspected of murder and attempted murder for a March 20, 2011 shooting outside a pool hall in Garden Grove, California that killed 19-year-old Scottie Bui and injured another man. Tieu was tried for the shooting, but a jury was deadlocked on the charges and a mistrial was declared. He was scheduled to be retried on the charges. Duong is charged with attempted murder, assault with a firearm, and firing into a residence. This was in relation to an incident in which he shot and wounded a man in Santa Ana in November 2015. He has a criminal record dating back to a residential burglary conviction in San Diego County in 1995. In 2007 he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of burglary and receiving stolen property, and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. In February 2008, Duong pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell, possession of a firearm by a felon, and evading police, and was sentenced to six years in prison. In May 2011, Duong pleaded guilty to another charge of possession of cocaine with intent to sell and the sale or transport of a controlled substance, and was sentenced to three years in prison. Escape Duong, Nayeri, and Tieu escaped from the jail on January 21 in the evening, by cutting through four layers of steel grating and rebar inside the building, climbing through a plumbing conduit to the roof, and lowering themselves four floors to the ground with a rope. They claim to have had a duffel bag and backpack of tools, high grade industrial rope and, civilian clothing. They were not reported missing until 9:00 p.m. the following day, and their escape was confirmed at midnight. Duong allegedly pressed a handgun into the rib cage of a taxicab driver outside a Target store in Rosemead, stole the vehicle, and took the driver hostage. They hid at the Flamingo Inn Motel in Rosemead for at least one night. They then stole a utility van from a private seller who advertised it through a Craigslist posting, in South Los Angeles. They never returned it after a test drive, and drove it along with the taxicab to San Jose, where they stayed at The Alameda motel. Duong was arguing with the other inmates on deciding whether to kill the taxicab driver, and went along with him to drive back to southern California in the cab. Duong released the driver, walked into a friend's auto shop business in Santa Ana on January 29, and called the police to surrender. On January 30, Nayeri and Tieu were arrested outside a McDonald's restaurant at the intersection of Haight Street and Stanyan Street near the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Nayeri was detained after a short foot chase, and Tieu was arrested while inside the van. Police found ammunition in the van, but did not find a firearm. The Orange County Sheriff's Department offered a $200,000 reward for the capture of the inmates. In 2017, Hossein Nayeri's lawyer released footage of their escape. Additional arrests Nooshafarin Ravaghi, a writer who taught English at the jail, was initially thought to have provided the inmates Google Maps information that included overviews of the jail rooftop and surrounding areas, but was cleared shortly thereafter. She was arrested and released from jail on February 1. Loc Ba Nguyen, an associate of Duong, was arrested for allegedly smuggling in tools that the inmates used to cut through the steel grating and barbed wire. He was formally charged with aiding the inmates' escape on February 1. Investigators have not revealed how he smuggled the tools into the jail. Three other arrests were made, including arrests of Vietnamese gang members.

He probably lived in Athens in the last two decades of the 5th century BC, but almost nothing is known of his life.G.J. Pendrick, Antiphon the Sophist (2002) p.26 It has been debated since antiquity whether the writer of these Sophistic treatises was in fact none other than Antiphon the Orator, or whether Antiphon the Sophist was indeed a separate person. This remains an active scholarly controversy; of recent editors, Gagarin, and Laks and Most, believe there to be only one Antiphon, whereas G. J. Pendrick argues for the existence of two separate individuals.For a survey of the issues involved, see Pendrick, pp. 2‚Äì24. A. Laks and G. W. Most, Early Greek Philosophy vol. IX (2016) pp. 2‚Äì3. The most important of these treatises was On Truth, whose surviving fragments cover many different subjects, from astronomy and mathematics to morality and ethics.Pendrick, pp. 32-35 Fragments have also been preserved of the treatises On Concord and Politicus; these fragments have sometimes been attributed to the Orator rather than to the Sophist.Pendrick, pp. 39-49 It is also not known for certain whether the treatise on the Interpretation of Dreams under the name of Antiphon was written by Antiphon the Sophist, or whether this was written by yet another different Antiphon. The editions of Pendrick and of Laks and Most proceed on the basis that this treatise was written by the same Antiphon as the Sophistic works.On this issue, see Pendrick, pp. 24‚Äì26. Antiphon the Sophist A third-century AD papyrus attributed to the first book of On Truth (P.Oxy. XI 1364 fr. 1, cols. v‚Äìvii) A treatise known as On Truth, of which only fragments survive, is attributed to Antiphon the Sophist. It is of great value to political theory, as it appears to be a precursor to natural rights theory. The views expressed in it suggest its author could not be the same person as Antiphon of Rhamnus, since it was interpreted as affirming strong egalitarian and libertarian principles appropriate to a democracy -- but antithetical to the oligarchical views of one who was instrumental in the anti-democratic coup of 411 like Antiphon of Rhamnus.W. K C. Guthrie, The Sophists, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971; see also Mario Untersteiner who cites Oxyrhynchus Papyrus #1364 fragment 2 in his The Sophists, tr. Kathleen Freeman (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1954), p. 252 It's been argued that that interpretation has become obsolete in light of a new fragment of text from On Truth discovered in 1984. New evidence supposedly rules out an egalitarian interpretation of the text.pp. 351, 356, Gerard Pendrick, 2002, Antiphon the Sophist: The Fragments, Cambridge U. Press; also p. 98 n. 41 of Richard Winton's \\"Herodotus, Thucydides, and the sophists\\" in C.Rowe & M.Schofield, The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Political Thought, Cambridge 2005. The following passages may confirm the strongly libertarian commitments of Antiphon the Sophist. \\"Nature\\" requires liberty On Truth juxtaposes the repressive nature of convention and law () with \\"nature\\" (), especially human nature. Nature is envisaged as requiring spontaneity and freedom, in contrast to the often gratuitous restrictions imposed by institutions: > Most of the things which are legally just are [none the less] ... inimical > to nature. By law it has been laid down for the eyes what they should see > and what they should not see; for the ears what they should hear and they > should not hear; for the tongue what it should speak, and what it should not > speak; for the hands what they should do and what they should not do ... and > for the mind what it should desire, and what it should not desire.Antiphon, > On Truth, Oxyrhynchus Papyri, xi, no. 1364, fragment 1, quoted in Donald > Kagan (ed.) Sources in Greek Political Thought from Homer to Polybius > \\"Sources in Western Political Thought, A. Hacker, gen. ed.; New York: Free > Press, 2965 Repression means pain, whereas it is nature (human nature) to shun pain. Elsewhere, Antiphon wrote: \\"Life is like a brief vigil, and the duration of life like a single day, as it were, in which having lifted our eyes to the light we give place to other who succeed us.\\"Fr. 50 DK, quoted at Stobaeus 4.34.63. Mario Untersteiner comments: \\"If death follows according to nature, why torment its opposite, life, which is equally according to nature? By appealing to this tragic law of existence, Antiphon, speaking with the voice of humanity, wishes to shake off everything that can do violence to the individuality of the person.\\"Mario Untersteiner, The Sophists, tr. Kathleen Freeman (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1954) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971, p. 247 It is reported that Antiphon set up a booth in a public agora where he offered consolation to the bereaved.Michael Gagarin, The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Volume 1 (2010), p. 281. In his championship of the natural liberty and equality of all men, Antiphon anticipates the natural rights doctrine of Locke, and the Declaration of Independence.  Mathematics  Antiphon was also a capable mathematician. Antiphon, alongside his companion Bryson of Heraclea, was the first to give an upper and lower bound for the value of pi by inscribing and then circumscribing a polygon around a circle and finally proceeding to calculate the polygons' areas. This method was applied to the problem of squaring the circle. The Anonymus Iamblichi Iamblichus' Protrepticus contains a lengthy excerpt from an important early author (studied by scholars as part of the Sophistic movement), on education and political philosophy. This passage was originally identified by Friedrich Blass in 1889 as the work of Antiphon, but this attribution has not been generally accepted. This work is accordingly referred to in modern scholarship as the Anonymus Iamblichi.B.

The film is loosely based on the 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe, but from the point of view of the island's animals. Plot Pirates have picked up a castaway named Robinson Crusoe upon finding his island. Having followed him onto the boat, a Scarlet macaw named Mak tells the true story of what really happened to a pair of mice named Rufus and Cecil. All the animals inhabited a tiny isolated South Pacific Island. Mak and his friends, including an echidna named Epi, a veiled chameleon named Carmello, a malayan tapir named Rosie, a kingfisher named Kiki, an old goat named Scrubby, and a ground pangolin named Pango all lived the perfect lives; blue skies, beautiful turquoise water, and lots of delicious food and crunchy insects. But every day is the same and Mak is really bored. Convinced there is more than just water over the horizon, he dreams of leaving his little paradise and exploring the new world. Meanwhile, an English mapmaker, namely Robinson Crusoe and his pet fox terrier Aynsley have booked passage on a ship to the new world to seek riches and gold and dealing with seasickness. During a very violent storm at night, the two are accidentally locked in the ship's hull along with a pair of embittered Persian cats, Mal and May, while the crew escapes with their lives, leaving the latter behind. During the storm, Mak and his friends of the island try to save Scrubby from falling to his death, which nearly goes bad, while trying to seek shelter in a cave on the high grounds from the storm. Arriving on the island, the next morning, Crusoe begins to look for a way out while the animals of the island, unsure of what to make of the strangers, hide out on the beach. Mak, seeing his chance to get off the island, convinces the other animals of the island to hide while he keeps an eye on them. Unfortunately, the next day, he is attacked by Mal and May, who have survived the storm as well. Luckily, Aynsley drives them away and Crusoe takes Mak aboard the wreckage to recover from his wing injury from the attack. He renames the bird Tuesday (after their second day on the island) and Aynsley convinces him that he and Crusoe are friends. Determined to take possession of the island and make Crusoe leave the island, Mal and May trick the animals of the island into believing Crusoe has murdered Mak. They have them attack Crusoe while they go after Mak and Aynsley in order to cover their tracks. In the ensuing chaos, Aynsley is pinned under a door as the remains of the ship begins to catch fire. Mak makes it out in time, but Aynsley dies in the explosion, which strands Mal and May on \\"Curse Island\\", a little island where all the bugs live. After Crusoe mourns Aynsley's death, Mak leads a grieving Crusoe to the other animals, having realized the cats' deception, in an attempt to cheer him up. Slowly but surely, the animals realize that Crusoe is friendly and begin helping him adjust to life on the island by providing him with fruits for food and helping him build a tree house, a \\"pipeline\\" for the fresh water supply, and a watchtower in case of any passing ships. However, Kiki becomes increasingly annoyed by the others' willingness to adapt to Crusoe's lifestyle as the months go by. Yet, sometimes, Crusoe seems upset by the dwindling possibility of a rescue. One afternoon, Kiki, worked up, flies out near the remains of the ship; lamenting about their lives with Crusoe, until Mal and May, with multiple litters of youngsters and having survived with nothing to eat but bugs on the rock, manage to get back on the main island from the wooden plank remains of the ship and decide to put an end to Crusoe and his friends' lives and wreak havoc on their little piece of Eden. Despite Mal and May's best efforts, the animals manage to defeat them back momentarily. Realizing the cats won't stop harassing them, at night, Mak leads them to the watchtower and, with his friends' help, traps them inside while the animals knock it down with the cats into the sea. However, their victory is short-lived when a fire set by May earlier endangers Crusoe and the animals, who was knocked unconscious in the previous fight. They manage to get him out but Crusoe becomes caught in some rigging and is rendered unconscious again by a falling wooden plank. Complicating matters is that the fire attracts the attention of a band of pirates led by the Captain Long John Silver, who drive off the \\"beasts\\" trying to save Crusoe on the same night and \\"rescue\\" him the next morning. Crusoe manages to placate them with a fictionalized version of what happened at the expense of the captain forcing him into the crew and refusing to return him back home to England due to the fear of being hung from the gallows; despite considering Crusoe's story as nothing more than yarn. After Mak finishes his story to Rufus and Cecil, he sees a poorly planned escape attempt by Crusoe results in a hectic chase. Mak rescues him (by tricking the pirates with a perfect voice imitation of the Captain momentarily) and the mice and make their way back to the island while the cats, who snuck onto the ship on a jerry-rigged life raft made out from the remains of the watchtower, which Crusoe later uses to row back to the island, are adopted by the pirates. During the credits, stills of the animals' lives with Robinson Crusoe along with Rufus and Cecil are revealed as they repair the tree house while readjusting to their lives on the island and the cats adjusting to life with Long John Silver and his crew.

It was under the command of Greek second lieutenant Dimitrios Mitsatsos and was manned by a crew of the Greek Navy in a top-secret mission to help patrol the Cypriot coastline. The boat also fought against the Turkish Cypriot forces during the battle at Tillyria. The losses sustained by the crew were the first battle casualties of the Hellenic Navy after World War II. Due to the top- secret nature of the mission, the commander and crew of the boat, including the fallen, received recognition from Greece and Cyprus on 19 January 2016, more than 50 years after the battle. Historical background In 1964, the government of Georgios Papandreou sent a Greek army division to Cyprus to help establish the Cypriot National Guard. As part of the same policy, two patrol boats, the Phaethon and the Arion were sent to Cyprus in a top-secret mission to assist in the naval operations which were taking place at Tillyria. Upon arrival to Cyprus, the two boats raised the Cypriot flag, installed guns on the boats, started patrolling the island and became the only two vessels serving in the Cypriot Navy at the time. Commissioning Phaethon and Arion were donated by Anastasios Levendis to Cyprus in 1964 to patrol its coast and bolster the defences of the island against possible Turkish invasions and other attacks. The vessels were originally built in Germany in 1935 and their condition was poor when they were sent to Cyprus after undergoing incomplete repairs in Greece. The two boats left Greece without documentation or raising a flag and the crew were given fake identities and were not carrying identification documents. Dimitrios Mitsatsos, the commander of Phaedon, was a graduate of the Hellenic Naval Academy and there were also two commissioned officers while the rest of the crew were conscripts. Mitsatsos was also the commanding officer of the Arion. Battle After patrolling the coast of Cyprus, Phaethon and Arion were eventually ordered to provide support to the fighters at Mansoura and Kokkina during the battle of Tillyria. After Mansoura fell, Phaethon experienced again problems in one of its two engines, this time due to pump failure. Subsequently, the captain received orders to proceed to a nearby bay to attempt repairs. As the two boats were travelling to the designated location, the crews observed an unidentified plane flying overhead. On 8 August 1964, while at the bay waiting for spare parts and ammunition, Mitsatsos saw a reconnaissance plane flying over the boats. Having read the newspaper reports about the Turkish aerial attacks during the battle of Tillyria, he realised this was a precursor to an attack. Mitsatsos then ordered the Arion to leave, since it was not damaged, and told the crew of the Phaethon that they were free to leave because as conscripts they were under no obligation to fight. He also told the two officers to leave, since one officer was expecting a child and the other was a young father. The crew and officers chose to remain and fight. Mitsatsos then sent a message to the naval headquarters at Nicosia that he was expecting an aerial attack. He was advised to wait to be fired on first and then counterattack. During the afternoon of 8 August 1964, Turkish F 100 fighter jets as part of a large-scale aerial attack, bombarded Phaethon while the boat was near Xeros Gulf. During the battle they also attacked the Phaethon using rockets and artillery shells. The speed of the boat was 7‚Äì8 knots due to the loss of one of its main engines. The attack happened in two waves. The first lasted for about 25 minutes and started at 16:25 local time when four Turkish jets attacked the boat. The second was an attack by two jets which started at 18:55 and lasted for about 30 minutes. The battle lasted about 40‚Äì50 minutes. Only one of the boat's anti-aircraft guns was functioning while the other four guns were supplied with the wrong ammunition. The boat guns managed to down a Turkish fighter while hitting another which, according to the captain's estimation, was able to land in Turkey. Mitsatsos was wounded by Turkish fire in his right hand which was later amputated. He subsequently tried to avoid the attacking Turkish aircraft by navigating close to American freighters, which were loading ore nearby, hoping that the Turkish aircraft would not fire so close to ships under American flag. However, the Turkish jets continued their attack. Under aircraft fire, with the helmsman killed, captain Mitsatsos navigated the boat with one arm. The second officer and the nurse were with him but subsequently were killed from aircraft fire. Mitsatsos grounded Phaethon on the beach ordering evacuation. Subsequently, the Turks bombed the boat with napalm and destroyed it, also killing other people nearby. From a total of 23 crew on board, six were killed during the attack and an additional six crew members were wounded. The two commissioned officers, and four sailors, one of whom was the ship nurse, died. The only Cypriot member of the crew was among those killed and was the seventh casualty. Aftermath Dimitrios Mitsatsos, the commanding officer, was ordered not to reveal any details of the mission. Upon returning to Greece, the Greek authorities, to avoid publicity and inquiries from the press which could possibly reveal the covert operation, sent him to a hospital which was not fully operational and lacked the facilities to provide him with the necessary care to treat his wounded arm which was finally amputated due to gangrene. The boat commander was also not allowed to resume his career in the Greek Navy due to his missing arm which was deemed a factor that could possibly raise enquiries regarding the mission which caused the trauma. The order by the Navy to the captain against revealing any details of the operation was lifted by ministerial decision published in January 2016. On 30 May 2017, the remains of Eleftherios Anthis, crew member of Phaethon who lost his life when the patrol boat was sunk, were buried with military honours in the suburb of Garitsa, in Corfu. His remains, along with the remains of another 16 sailors serving on the Phaethon, were returned to Greece by the military casualties excavation service of Cyprus. Recognition On 8 August 2007, the first liturgy in memory of the six Greek sailors killed in the battle took place at the cemetery of Saints Constantine and Eleni in Nicosia, where the fallen Greek sailors are buried. The seventh member of the crew that was killed, who was a Cypriot, is buried at the cemetery of Morphou. On 19 January 2016, in a ceremony at the hall \\"Cyprus House\\" of the embassy of Cyprus in Athens, Greek defence minister Panos Kammenos awarded commander Dimitrios Mitsatsos the Star of Value and Honour of Greece telling him \\"We thank you for what you offered to the fatherland and we principally thank you for the things you have endured to the present day\\". The ceremony was described as restitution for a \\"historical injustice\\" toward the crew of 22 men of the boat. In the same ceremony, Cypriot defence minister Christophoros Fokaidis also paid tribute to the families of the dead and the commander of the boat.

Murray (1922 - 25 May 2005) was an Irish Gaelic footballer who played as a midfielder for the Roscommon senior team. Born in Knockcroghery, County Roscommon, Murray was introduced to Gaelic football during his schooling at Roscommon CBS. A two-time Connacht medallist he also enjoyed All- Ireland successes at inter-provincial level. At club level Murray first lined out as a minor with St. Patrick's. In a distinguished career he won six championship medals. Murray made his debut on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Roscommon minor team. An All-Ireland medallist in this grade, Murray later claimed an All-Ireland medal as a non-playing substitute with the junior team before joining the senior team. He went on to play a key role for Roscommon during a hugely successful era, and won two All- Ireland medals and four Connacht medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Connacht inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Murray never won a Railway Cup medal. He retired from inter-county football following the conclusion of the 1948 championship. His brother, Jimmy Murray, was an All-Ireland-winning captain with Roscommon.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1913 Life He was born in Portobello, Edinburgh on 22 May 1858, the son of Reverend Alexander Philip, minister of Cruden, one of four brothers all of whom were ministers who left the established Church of Scotland to join the Free Church at the Disruption. Rev. Alexander Philip latterly held charge of the Free Church at Dunfermline and Portobello. Alexander Philip was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh and then studied Law at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated MA and LLB. He began his legal apprenticeship at Webster, Will & Ritchie at 37 Queen StreetEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1878 in Edinburgh, where the junior partner was a son of Charles Will, Provost of Brechin. Following the death of Charles Will, Alexander Philip then became an assistant at C & J Will in Brechin, entering into a partnership with the Provost's other son, James Will in 1887. The firm was then renamed Will and Philip, then later Ferguson, Will and Philip. The firm still survives (as of 2017) as Ferguson and Will on Clerk St in Brechin. During his time in Brechin, he became an important pillar of the community, active in both social and public life. He was clerk to the Brechin district committee; and Menmuir parish council. He was a Justice of the Peace and honorary Sheriff Substitute for the county and in 1899 was appointed to joint secretary of the committee to fund-raise for Brechin Cathedral's restoration. John Honeymann and Keppie drew up plans for the cathedral's restoration and, after the restoration completed in 1902, drew up plans for Alexander Philip's house, The Mary Acre. In 1913 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Cargill Gilston Knott, Sir Robert William Philip, Andrew William Kerr and William Allan Carter. Calendar Reform  Alexander Philip was perhaps best known for his proposals on Calendar Reform, which were first aired in 1906 as the \\"Proposals for a Simplified Calendar\\". His suggestions were incorporated into the Calendar Reform Bill, presented by Robert Pearce in 1912. The main change that Alexander Philip advocated for was the transfer of a day from August to February to provide each quarter with 91 days (exactly 13 weeks), so that each quarter would be identical, and creating a 364 day year such that all fixed dates (Christmas Day, New Year's Day etc) would fall on the same day of the week each year. He also argued for the fixing \\"movable feasts\\" such as Easter to fixed dates. and spoke at conferences at the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in London and Geneva. Proposed Reforms In The Calendar: Its History, Structure and Improvement Alexander Philip outlined his principal objections to the Gregorian calendar, namely that most civil events involve a reference to both the Calendar date and the day of the week. He divided these dates into two classes: #Legal terms, such as dates of sitting and rising for law courts, schools and universities. Additionally such statutory dates as dates for regular meetings and statutory returns such as tax returns as well as quarterly term days for maturities of bills etc. Also included were civil fete days that fall on a fixed day of the month or year. #Movable feasts of the Church, such as Easter. Also included in this category were meetings fixed to particular week days, such as magistrate meetings, local markets and fairs. He noted that where a market or festival falls on the first Wednesday in July one town, and on the first Thursday in another, sometimes these will be adjacent and at other times 6 days apart. Alexander Philip sought to resolve 3 identified deficiencies: #Unequal-length quarters, by an equal division of 364 days (i.e. 91 days per quarter) and 1‚Äì2 days left over. #Minimising variation in the length of months by having a standard month-length of 30 days and 1 month of 31 each quarter. #Convenient Apportionment of weeks, months and quarters with each quarter to consist of exactly, 3 months, 13 weeks or 91 days. His principal objections to the Invariable Calendar was the, in his opinion, \\"unnecessary amount of change\\" for the sake of symmetrical appearance with the rhythmical order of 31, 30, 30 or 30, 30, 31. His belief was that the transfer of one day from August to February would largely resolve these issues. The 31 May would become the year day, with Saturday 30 May, followed by Year Day 31 May; and then Sunday 1 June. In leap years February would have 30 days, and the additional day would similarly be known as Leap Day and not any particular day of the week. His choice of these dates for exclusion was with the aim of starting each quarter on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday. In this regard, he aligned his quarters not with the Calendar year, but with the Ecclesiastical calendar starting with December. A further consequence of these changes would be that the variation in the date of Easter would fall from 35 days to 22 until at least 2199. However, he argued for the fixing of the date of Easter as Sunday 12 April as approximating the probably date of the resurrection. Equally 50 days thereafter, the date for Pentecost would fall exactly on the 31 May, the date commonly used to commemorate it. Alexander Philip sought to introduce these changes on 29 February 1920.

Discord specializes in text, image, video and audio communication between users in a chat channel. Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and in web browsers. , there are over 250 million users of the software. History The concept of Discord came from Jason Citron, who had founded OpenFeint, a social gaming platform for mobile games. He eventually sold OpenFeint to GREE in 2011 for US$104 million, which he used to found Hammer & Chisel, a game development studio, in 2012. Their first product was Fates Forever, released in 2014, which Citron anticipated to be the first MOBA game on mobile platforms, but it did not become commercially successful. However, during the development process, Citron noticed how difficult it was for his team to work out tactics in games like Final Fantasy XIV and League of Legends using available voice over IP (VoIP) software. He found that some VoIP options required players to type in IP addresses just to connect, while others were resource-heavy and had known security problems. This led the developers to develop a chat service that was much friendlier to use and based on more modern technology. To develop Discord, Hammer & Chisel gained additional funding from YouWeb's 9+ incubator, which had also funded the startup of Hammer & Chisel, and from Benchmark capital and Tencent. Discord was publicly released in May 2015 under the domain name discordapp.com. According to Citron, the only area that they pushed Discord into was for the Reddit communities, finding that many subreddit forums were replacing IRC servers with Discord ones. Discord became popular among esports and LAN tournament gamers, and other Twitch streamers. The company raised an additional US$20 million in funding for the software in January 2016. This included an investment from American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate WarnerMedia. In 2019 they sold their share after WarnerMedia Investment Group was shut down following the AT&T; acquisition. In December 2018 the company announced it raised $150 million in funding at a $2 billion valuation. The round was led by Greenoaks Capital with participation from Firstmark, Tencent, IVP, Index Ventures and Technology Opportunity Partners. In March 2020, Discord changed its motto from \\"Chat for Gamers\\" to \\"Chat for Communities and Friends\\". This was part of their response to an increase of users as a result of the 2019-20 COVID-19 outbreak, which also included the introduction of server templates. In April 2020, Discord's Twitter username was changed from @discordapp to @discord. Later in May 2020, Discord changed its primary domain from discordapp.com to discord.com. Starting in June 2020, Discord announced it was shifting focus away from video gaming specificity to a more all-purpose communication and chat client for all functions, revealing its new slogan \\"Your place to talk\\" and a revised website. Among other planned changes would be to reduce the number of gaming in-jokes it uses within the client, improving the user onboarding experience, and increasing server capacity and reliability. The company announced it had received an additional in investments to help with these changes. Software Discord uses the metaphors of servers and channels similar to Internet Relay Chat even though these servers do not map to traditional hardware or virtual servers due to its distributed nature. A user can create a server on Discord, managing its public visibility and access, and create one or more channels within this service. Within a server, depending on access controls, users can create channels within a category framework, with the visibility and access on the channels also customizable to the server. One such customization is the ability to mark channels \\"NSFW\\" (Not safe for work), which forces first-time channel viewers to confirm that they are over 18 and willing to see such content. In addition to normal text-based channels, Discord servers can create voice-chat channels. Jason Citron, Discord Co-Founder and CEO, at TechCrunch Disrupt 2018 Every Discord user has a four-digit \\"discriminator\\", shown as a four-digit number, prefixed with \\"#\\", after their username. This allows for multiple users to have the same username and for users to find friends easily. Both at the server and the user level, Discord allows users to connect these to their Twitch or other gaming service account. These integrations provide unique messaging tools within the app: for example, Discord can determine the game a user is presently playing on Steam if they have connected their account. The Discord client is built on the Electron framework using web technologies, which allows it to be multi-platform and operate on the web and as an installed application on personal computers. The software is supported by eleven data centers around the world to keep latency with clients low. All versions of the client support the same core feature set; screen sharing with desktop audio is Windows exclusive, as is downloading and playing games from the Discord Game Store. Discord is specifically designed for use while gaming, as it includes features such as low-latency, free voice chat servers for users and dedicated server infrastructure. Discord's developers also added video calling and screen sharing in 2017. Support for calls between two or more users was added in an update on July 28, 2016. In December 2016, the company introduced its GameBridge API, which allows game developers to directly integrate with Discord within games. The Git repository documentation for the Discord API is hosted on GitHub. Discord provides partial support for rich text via the Markdown syntax. Discord uses the Opus audio format, which is low-latency and designed to compress speech. While the software itself comes at no cost, the developers investigated ways to monetize it, with potential options including paid customization options such as emoji or stickers. In January 2017, the first paid subscription and features were released with \\"Discord Nitro Classic\\" (originally released as \\"Discord Nitro\\"). For a monthly subscription fee of $4.99, users can get an animated avatar, use custom and/or animated emojis across all servers (non-nitro users can only use custom emoji on the server they were added to), an increased maximum file size on file uploads (from 8 MB to 50 MB), the ability to screen share in higher resolutions, the ability to choose their own discriminator (from #0001 to #9999) and a unique profile badge. In October 2018, \\"Discord Nitro\\" was renamed \\"Discord Nitro Classic\\" with the introduction of the new \\"Discord Nitro\\", which cost $9.99 and included access to free games through the Discord game store. Monthly subscribers of \\"Discord Nitro Classic\\" at the time of the introduction of the Discord games store were gifted with \\"Discord Nitro\\", lasting until January 1, 2020, and yearly subscribers of \\"Discord Nitro Classic\\" were gifted with \\"Discord Nitro\\" until January 1, 2021. Users on Discord can improve the quality of the servers they reside in via the \\"Server Boost\\" feature, which improves quality of audio channels, streaming channels, number of emoji slots and other perks in 3 levels. Users can buy boosts to support the servers they choose, for a monthly amount. Possession of \\"Discord Nitro\\" gives a user two extra boosts to use on any server they like. The developers have stated that while they will look for ways to monetize the software, it will never lose its core features. Video calling and screen sharing features were added to Discord, first for a small test base in August 2017 and later for all users in October 2017. While these features mimic live streaming capabilities of platforms like Twitch, the company does not plan to compete with these services, believing that these features are best used by small groups. In October 2017, Discord offered server verification to game developers, publishers, and content creators, allowing them to display their server's \\"official\\" status with a \\"verified checkmark\\" after confirming their identity with the Discord team. Developers and publishers with verified servers can use data from Discord to create a \\"rich presence\\" within their games, allowing players to connect their game profile to their Discord profile. By the end of 2017, about 450 servers were verified, with about 20 servers using the \\"rich presence\\" features. Discord also provides tools for users to create their own Internet bots. There are tools such as discord.js that allow bot developers to interact with the Discord API to control their bot. Microsoft announced in April 2018 that it will provide Discord support for Xbox Live users, allowing them to link their Discord and Xbox Live accounts so that they can connect with their Xbox Live friends list through Discord. Digital distribution In August 2018, Discord launched a games storefront beta, allowing users to purchase a curated set of games through the service. This will include a \\"First on Discord\\" featured set of games that their developers attest to Discord's help in getting launched, giving these games 90 days of exclusivity on the Discord marketplace. Discord Nitro subscribers will also gain access to a rotating set of games as part of their subscription, with the price of Nitro being bumped from $4.99 to $9.99 a month. A cheaper service called 'Nitro Classic' was also released that has the same perks as Nitro but does not include the free games. Following the launch of the Epic Games Store, which challenged Valve's Steam storefront by only taking a 12% cut of game revenue, Discord announced in December 2018 that it would reduce its own revenue cut to 10%. To further support developers, starting in March 2019 Discord gave the ability for developers and publishers that ran their own servers to offer their games through a dedicated store channel on their server, with Discord managing the payment processing and distribution. This can be used, for example, to give select users access to alpha- and beta-builds of a game in progress as an early access alternative. In September 2019, Discord announced that it was ending its free game service in October 2019 as they found too few people were playing the games offered. Discord's digital storefront remains operational. Reception By January 2016, Hammer & Chisel reported that Discord had been used by 3 million people, with growth of 1 million per month, reaching 11 million users in July that year. By December 2016, the company reported it had 25 million users worldwide. By the end of 2017, the service had drawn nearly 90 million users, with roughly 1.5 million new users each week. With the service's third anniversary, Discord stated that it had 130 million unique registered users. The company observed that while the bulk of its servers are used for gaming- related purposes, a small number have been created by users for non-gaming activities, like stock trading, fantasy football, and other shared interest groups. In May 2016, one year after the software's release, Tom Marks, writing for PC Gamer, described Discord as the best VoIP service available. Lifehacker has praised Discord's interface, ease of use, and platform compatibility. In May 2019, Discord reported it had at least 250 million registered users across its web and mobile platforms. It was used by 56 million people every month, sending a total of 25 billion messages per month. By June 2020, the company reported it had 100 million active users each month. Disruptive use Discord has had problems with hostile behavior and abuse within chats, with some communities of chat servers being \\"raided\\" (the taking over of a server by a large number of users) by other communities. This includes flooding with controversial topics related to race, religion, politics, and pornography. Discord has stated that it has plans to implement changes that would \\"rid the platform of the issue\\". To better protect its users and its services since these events, Discord has implemented a trust and safety team that is on call around the clock to monitor the servers and respond to reports. This includes dealing with user harassment, servers that violate Discord's terms of service, and protecting servers from \\"raiding\\" and spamming by malicious users or bots. While they do not directly monitor messages, the trust and safety team can determine malicious activity from service use patterns and/or user-generated reportshttps://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360048365072-In- app-and-easy-reporting-to-the-Trust-Safety-team and take appropriate steps, including more detailed investigation, to deal with the matter. The service plans to expand this team as they continue to gain new users. Controversial content Discord gained popularity with the alt-right due to the client's supporting anonymity and privacy. Analyst Keegan Hankes from the Southern Poverty Law Center said \\"It's pretty unavoidable to be a leader in this [alt- right] movement without participating in Discord\\". In early 2017, CEO Jason Citron stated Discord was aware of these groups and their servers. Citron stated that servers found to be engaged in illegal activities or violations of the terms of service would be shut down, but would not disclose any examples. Following the violent events that occurred during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12, 2017, it was found that Discord had been used to plan and organize the white nationalist rally. This included participation by Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin, high-level figures in the movement. Discord responded by closing servers that supported the alt-right and far-right, and banning users who had participated. Discord's executives condemned \\"white supremacy\\" and \\"neo-Nazism\\", and said that these groups \\"are not welcome on Discord\\". Discord has worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center to identify hateful groups using Discord and ban those groups from the service. Since then, several neo-Nazi and alt-right servers have been shut down by Discord, including those operated by neo-Nazi terrorist group Atomwaffen Division, Nordic Resistance Movement, Iron March, and European Domas. In January 2018, The Daily Beast reported that it found several Discord servers that were specifically engaged in distributing revenge porn and facilitating real-world harassment of the victims of these images and videos. Such actions are against Discord's terms of service and Discord has shut down servers and banned users identified from these servers, but the ease of creating new accounts and servers allows such servers to continue to proliferate. In July 2018, Discord updated its terms of service to ban drawn pornography with underaged subjects. A social media movement subsequently criticized Discord for selectively allowing \\"cub\\" content, or underaged pornographic furry artwork, under the same guidelines. Discord moderators held that \\"cub porn\\" was separate from lolicon and shotacon, being \\"allowable as long as it is tagged properly.\\" After numerous complaints from the community, Discord amended its community guidelines in February 2019 to include \\"non- humanoid animals and mythological creatures as long as they appear to be underage\\" in its list of disallowed categories, in addition to announcing periodic transparency reports to better communicate with users. In March 2019, the media collective Unicorn Riot published the contents of a Discord server used by several members of the white nationalist group Identity Evropa who were also members of the United States Armed Forces.

Results of such polls are displayed in this article. The date range for these opinion polls are from the previous parliamentary election, held on 25 October 2015, to the election day of 13 October 2019. Graphical summary 1070px Poll results Poll results are listed in the tables below in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first, and using the date the survey's fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. If such date is unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading party's colour. In the instance that there is a tie, then no figure is shaded. The lead column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. When a specific poll does not show a data figure for a party, the party's cell corresponding to that poll is shown empty.  2019  = Electoral alliances = { class=\\" sortable collapsible\\" center; font-size:95%; line- height:16px; - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:130px;\\"  Polling Firm/Link ! rowspan=\\"2\\" data-sort-type=\\"date\\" style=\\"width:130px;\\"  Fieldwork Period ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20px;\\"  Sample Size ! style=\\"width:60px;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  United Right ! style=\\"width:60px;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Civic Coalition ! style=\\"width:60px;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  The Left ! style=\\"width:60px;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Polish Coalition ! style=\\"width:60px;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Confederation ! style=\\"width:60px;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Independents & Local Gov.

The plant is among the top ten turbine construction companies in the world, besides players like General Electric, Siemens, Alstom, JSC Power Machines, Andritz Hydro, Voith.  History   1929‚Äì1940 Foundation and commissioning  On 1 May 1932, the first stage of the turbogenerator plant was commissioned. Its design capacity was consistent with production of 1.5 million kW per year of steam turbines. Four workshops were put into service: blade, tool, workshop of different parts and workshop of discs and diaphragms. Achievements in 1932 included: * First hydroelectric generator for Dzoraget Hydroelectric Power Station * Diesel-generator set for Turkestan‚ÄìSiberia Railway * Renovation of 10 regional power plants and 12 turbines with a total capacity of 134 MW * Production of turbine blades that previously were imported from abroad By the end of 1932, development of the first design of a turbogenerator with a capacity of 50 MW was completed. In early 1933, three more workshops were commissioned: large machining, winding and assembly. At the end of the year, production of 24 types of blades was mastered and turbines were refurbished for Kashira Power Plant and some other power plants.  1940‚Äì1950 War and Postwar years  During WWII, the plant suspended turbine production and began manufacture of defense products, such as mortars, and repaired tanks. The work at the enterprise was suspended only three days before the beginning of the occupation of Kharkiv on 21 October 1941. Meanwhile, an evacuation process was in full swing. During the evacuation, \\"Turboatom\\" was divided into several parts. On 23 August 1943, Kharkiv was freed and rehabilitation of the enterprise began. A team of turbine constructors restored the native plant and continued to manufacture products while also participating in the restoration of municipal services. In late 1944, the plant already had 374 (out of 700) items of machine tools and other production equipment installed in accordance with the plant rehabilitation project. In a year, 250 machine tools were installed and commissioned. The number of workers and employees of the plant rapidly increased from 876 to 1664 persons in a year. In 1944 for city of Kharkov were restored and equipped four turbines with total capacity of 68 thousand kW; two turbines with capacity of 22 thousand kilowatt for Kyiv and also erected turbines for Sevastopl, Kaluga and Shterov Power Station total capacity of 28,200 kW. Achievements in 1944 included: * Four turbines with a total capacity of 68 thousand kW restored and equipped for the city of Kharkov * Two turbines with a capacity of 22 thousand kilowatt for Kyiv * Erection of turbines for Sevastopl, Kaluga and Shterov Power Stations with a total capacity of 28,200 kW  Development of nuclear turbine construction  Turboatom began serial production of MK-30 turbines with a capacity of 30 MW for mining and chemical centers with experimental reactors. The first Kharkov MK-30 turbine began operations in December 1958 in Tomsk. In the early 1970s, manufacture of turbines for nuclear power plants with a capacity of 500 MW was approved. This allowed a sharp reduction in capital expenditure on the construction of power plants. Turbines of this type are installed at: * Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant (the world's largest) * Kursk Nuclear Power Plant * Smolensk Nuclear Power Plant In the 1970s, Turboatom was identified as a leading enterprise in designing and manufacturing powerful steam turbines for nuclear power plants. In 1982‚Äì1985 the company mastered manufacture of steam turbines with a capacity of 1000 MW for the following NPPs: * South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant * Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant * Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant * Balakovo Nuclear Power Plant * Rostov Nuclear Power Plant * Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (Bulgaria)  Developments since 1991  In 1998, Turboatom backed out of a plan to help Russia construct a NPP in Iran, following pressure from US president Bill Clinton. The multi-million dollar deal would have provided 25 to 30 percent of the factory's total output over five years, and the backing-out was thus regarded as a severe blow to the regional economy by 2000. American utility company Westinghouse Electric signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Turboatom in 2017 in order to assist in the upgrading of Ukraine's 13 VVER-1000 reactors. Another MOU followed in 2018 with Japanese power and engineering company Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation. At the end of July 2018, the company's specialists produced high-pressure cylinders CNT-1 to Armenian Nuclear Power Plant. In 2019 Energoatom and Turboatom signed a five year contract to modernise condensers and turbines at a number of Ukrainian nuclear power plants.  Privatization  In 2017, the National Reforms Council floated the idea that Turboatom could be privatized. At that time, the state held a controlling stake of roughly 75 percent in the company, with Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman arguing that the state should continue to control a stake of at least 51 percent after privatization. A governmental committee approved the transfer of the state's 75 percent stake into private hands in May 2018. However, the government terminated any privatization process of the company in 2019 by removing Turboatom from a list of companies cleared for privatization.

The school was founded in 1958 in Glen Cove, Maine under the leadership of Harold Duff and Arthur Fish. The school was forced to close its doors in 1979.\\"Christian Academy, Bible College Closing Doors\\", The Courier Gazette, August 28, 1979,page one. Campus During its twenty-year history, the campus was developed to include a gymnasium and soccer field, an academy boys dormitory, a co-ed Bible college dormitory, and an academy classroom building, Tracey Hall. The thirty-five room Warrenton Cottage housed the kitchen, dining halls, library, administrative offices, academy girls dormitory, and a snack bar/recreation center. The former carriage house was renovated to provide Bible college classrooms, library, and chapel for both schools. A capital campaign was begun in 1976 to provide funding for a multi-purpose building housing a new kitchen, dining hall, and larger chapel necessitated by increasing enrollment in both schools. Due to the closure of the schools in 1979 the chapel complex was never completed. Activities The academy fielded a variety of interscholastic sports teams. They were active participants in the State Principal's Association sports leagues as a Class S school. Girls teams included basketball, softball, and volleyball teams. Boys teams included cross country, soccer, basketball, baseball, and volleyball. The boys basketball team reached Class S/D state tournament status in 1964, 1965, and 1976. In 1969, the boys varsity basketball team won the Western Maine Class D Runner-up trophy.Strong grabs Western S Title, Morning Sentinel (Waterville, ME)February 24, 1969, page 8 In 1977, the boys team won the Western Maine Class D Title, but lost to Eastern Maine champs, Jonesport-Beals in the Class D State Championship contest. In 1978, the boys team lost to Oak Grove-Coburn in the Western Maine Semifinal matchup. The schools provided several musical opportunities for students. School choirs,Glen Cove Choir will perform at Wells Branch, Biddeford-Saco Journal, March 23, 1965, Page 3 quartets, trios and vocal ensembles performed locally and traveled to churches, schools, and conferences throughout the Northeast United States. There was an active drama program at the school, and students were also active in the local chapter of the National Honor Society and the DAR Glen Cove Bible College In 1960 the board of directors voted to establish a post secondary Bible Institute on the same campus. Eventually, the curriculum was expanded into three separate tracks. A one-year certificate program and a four-year college program were added to the three year diploma track. The first graduating class of 1963 included nine members, and by its tenth year of existence enrollment had increased to ninety-five students with a graduating class of 14.Glen Cove Bible College course catalogs \\"In 1973, Governor Kenneth Curtis signed into law an act naming Glen Cove Bible School the Glen Cove Bible College.\\" The approval was based on the recommendation of a select committee of the Maine Department of Education and the unanimous approval of the 106th Maine Legislature's Education Committee.\\"The Christian Forward\\" quarterly news magazine of Christian Schools, Inc. The College was granted state approval to award the bachelor of religious education degree (B.R.E.) to graduates of the four-year program. All students in that program were required to complete 128 credit hours of study including Bible (36 credit hours), liberal arts (36 credit hours), a minor in theology, Christian education, missions (18 credit hours) or music (25 hours). Retreats and Conferences Both the Academy and the College hosted winter carnivals for teenagers. These served as an outreach to young people and a student recruitment opportunity. Bible and missionary conferences were also hosted on the campus during the school year and during summer months. Missionaries from around the globe and popular Bible teachers were featured at these conferences which were also open to the general public.\\"The Christian Forward\\" quarterly news magazine of Christian Schools, Inc.

One senior was graduated in June 1959. During that year the Board of Directors began the process of finding a suitable site for a boarding school. They began to investigate the Warrenton estate in the Glen Cove section of Rockport near Rockland Maine. The estate consisted of sixty- seven acres of land with 2500 feet of ocean front and a main house of thirty- five rooms and ten baths, a carriage house and an outlying barn, all in good condition. The property, formerly a private residence adjacent to the Samoset Resort, had recently been used by a research organization and had been vacant for two years. The former owners, The Round Table Foundation, allowed the school to occupy and use the property pending the settling of the title. This was accomplished a year later on September 28, 1960.\\"Sale of Warrenton to Christian Schools, Inc.

As a young man he farmed with his family, operated heavy equipment and worked on the Bangor and Aroostook Rail Road. In 1943 he enlisted in the Army Air Corp and served on a B17 as a flight engineer. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service during WWII. Upon his return to the United States, he enrolled as a student at Bob Jones University in Greenville South Carolina where he received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Bible. After graduation, Duff taught at New Brunswick Bible Institute in Victoria, New Brunswick, Canada for six years before being called upon to help establish a new Christian high school in central Maine.

They are the Penton-inspired 1984 300 GS, the 300 DMX, the dirt only 300 MXC, European road legal 300 EXC and their current US counterpart the 300 XC (close-ratio) and 300 XC-W (wide-ratio gear box) respectively. The KTM 300 is designed for difficult off-road conditions. The 300 EXC and the 300 XC-W have a small headlight, speedometer, tail-light and somewhat softer linkless PDS suspension. Starting in 2008 all 300's came with electric start. Since the early 2000s KTM has been offering the XC-W model in a special \\"Six-Days\\" limited edition. Model progression 1984‚Äì1989 The original 300GS Enduro grew out of the experience with 250 cc Penton Hare Scrambler and other KTM air cooled 2-stroke enduro bikes. Since the 1986 rules for the International Six Days Enduro (ISDE) for the open class allowed any bike larger that 250 cc, KTM experimented with a water cooled over-250 cc bike for the open class. They essentially bored their 250 out to 273 cc and called it a 300. This version of the 300 was discontinued in 1987. KTM also tried sleeving down their 500mxc two-stroke to 350 cc calling it the 350mxc, but the left side kick-starter and the right side chain were not popular. 1990‚Äì1997 In 1990 KTM got serious and the present-day 300 was born. Dubbed the 300 EX/C, its engine delivered very smooth power and did not produce a power hit. The bike performed well at low RPMs. In the mid-range and the top-end the smooth power delivery allowed the rider control over a wide variety of riding conditions from tight trails to wide open stretches. The plush suspension worked well compared to the older GS models. The bike was also offered as the 300 DMX, a California desert version. These early KTM motors had 297 cc displacement with 72 mm x 73 mm bore/stroke. Still the 300 hadn't reached its full potential. Ignition and jetting problems plagued these early models. In 1992 the company suffered financial woes and development was slowed. The 1993 KTMs had √ñhlins USD forks. WP forks were also used that year. In 1993 Motoplat went out of business, forcing KTM to switch to SEM ignition systems. The 1996 model had Marzocchi USD forks and an √ñhlins rear shock absorber, a chrome exhaust pipe and silencer, a motor with better performance, increased cooling and stock Boyesen reeds. For 1996‚Äì97 the bike was offered in a 360 cc version. In 1997 KTM switched to Kokusan ignition systems. 1998‚Äì2003 1996 was the first year for the KTM trademark orange bikes. In addition to larger capacity radiators, the 300 received KTM‚Äôs PDS link-less rear suspension with 320 mm of rear wheel travel. The bike was again offered in a bored out 380 cc during 1998-2000 (a street legal title was offered in some states). In 1999 the 300 received a hydraulic clutch and the 2000 motor benefited from a redesigned cylinder. 2004‚Äì2007 In 2004 there was another frame change. There were significant engine changes, including a bore and stroke change and the carburetor size reduced from 38 mm to 36 mm, resulting in an weight savings and no more jetting problems. For 2006, the US version of the 300 EXC was replaced by the XC and the XC-W. Both versions had 5-speed gearboxes and a stator for producing electricity. The 300 XC had a close-ratio gear box, no wiring for lights, and a stiffer suspension. The 300 XC-W had a wide-ratio gear box, head light, tail light and maintained the softer PDS suspension. The 2007 model had added a dual ignition mapping switch on the handlebar. 2008‚Äì2016 The 2008 KTM 300 EXC is the first electric start two-stroke enduro bike to be released by a major manufacturer. All models have PDS rear suspension. For 2010, Husaberg the other KTM owned bike company, offered the TE300, an XC-W with minor modifications to the bodywork and suspension settings. In 2011, models received 6-speed gearboxes, a new exhaust pipe and silencer, and translucent fuel tanks. The XC was also upgraded to a new frame, while retaining PDS rear suspension. These frame updates did not make it to the XC-W until 2012. The 2011 Husaberg TE 300 was essentially a rebadged KTM 300 and was available through 2012. In 2012 there were improvements to the starter motor bendix, more frame changes resulting in more wheel travel for models with PDS rear suspension (except the XC)Dirt Bike \\"KTM Suspension Shootout: PDS vs. Lindage, and a new air box with a filter that can be replaced without the use of tools. The 300XC was changed from PDS rear suspension to linkage rear suspension.Dirt Bike \\"KTM Suspension Shootout: PDS vs. Lindage The 300XC-W models received the frame and bodywork updates that arrived in the XC line the year before, but also retain PDS rear suspension. In 2013 the clutch was changed to a 'DDS' diaphragm spring clutch with lighter pull, a new stronger starter motor (350W motor was replaced with a 410W motor), lighter battery, and triple clamps changed from 22 mm to 20 mm offset. The Husaberg TE300 was rebranded the Husqvarna TE300 and also received linkage rear suspension. In 2014 bikes received a new CDI unit and ignition curve, stronger/larger battery, changed jetting, updated brakes (front master cylinder, caliper, and pads changed), a redesigned cylinder head, new Boyesen reeds, stiffer seat foam, and a new rear shock absorber with revised settings. The 2015 model chromoly steel frame is painted orange like the motocross models. All the 2015 models have the new WP 4CS forks with revised damping (rebound in one fork and compression in the other) with the ability to make adjustments on the fly, and a smaller front axle. The triple clamps have 2 mm less offset resulting in more trail and different steering characteristics. The rear shock is longer but the travel is unchanged. The electric starter has different gearing to provide higher initial torque from the electric motor, and the battery is lighter and stronger. 2017‚Äì Present KTM 300 XC-W Six- Days Spain EditionThe 2017 KTM 300's are completely redesigned bikes. A counter-balancer has been added to reduce motor vibration. The case is a new design featuring a new position for the starter motor. A Mikuni carb replaced the Keihin carburetor as Keihin focuses on fuel injection. There was a change to the air filter design. Suspension changed with the addition of a new Xplor 48 rear shock downsized from 50 mm to 46 mm. The forks are similar to the previous generation open cartridge forks supplied on the 300's with split compression and rebound adjusters. The adjuster atop the left fork controls compression and adjuster top the right fork controls rebound similar to the 4CS fork system. For 2018 KTM started offering the 300 EXC (Europe only) model with transfer port injection (TPI) and with oil injection through the 39 mm Dell‚ÄôOrto throttle body to meet EURO 4 standards. For 2019 KTM began offering U.S. customers the 300 XC-W model with (TPI) and oil injection. The fuel injected 300's were previously available only in the international market. The KTM XC-W still comes with PDS rear suspension while the 300 XC and the Husqvarna TE (essentially a KTM with different plastics) come with linkage suspensions. For the 2020 model year KTM began providing U.S. customers both the 300 XC-W and 300 XC with TPI and oil injection, thus eliminating all carbureted 300's from the US market. Both models benefit from updated EFI mapping and a new air pressure sensor. The XC-W has been given an all new chassis derived from the SX models. Other minor changes include: An updated ECU, suspension settings and styling / plastic upgrades. For the 2021 model year the 300's feature only minor refinements from the previous models.
