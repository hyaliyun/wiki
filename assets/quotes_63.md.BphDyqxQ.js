He is currently the guitarist for indie rock band Franz Ferdinand. He previously played guitar for the indie bands 1990s, Stinky Munchkins, The Yummy Fur, V-Twin, and Wife Vs. Secretary. Career V-Twin V-Twin were a rock band formed in 1997, comprising Jason MacPhail (vocals) and Michael McGaughrin (drums), with a number of lineups including other musicians, before bass player, Bobby Kildea, and guitarist, Bardot became permanent members. The band released a number of singles between 1998 and 2002, on the Domino Recording Company label, before their debut album, The Blues is a Minefield, was released 28 October 2002. Stinky Munchkins In January 2007 Bardot (guitar, vocals), Daryl Doll (vocals, percussion), Charlie Milne (guitar), Matt Gallus (bass) and Bix Cosmo (drums) formed Stinky Munchkins. The band released a single, \\"Release the Lions\\" on 6 August 2007 on the Art Goes Pop label. \\"Release the Lions‚Äù and the B-side, \\"Bad Timing\\" were co-written by Bardot, Doll and Milne. Milne performed under the name Charlie Hong-Deen. 1990s In late 2007 he joined the 1990s, replacing founding member and guitarist, Jamie McMorrow, played the bass on the Australian and North American legs of the band's world tour. In early 2008 he was confirmed as a permanent member of the band, joining Jackie McKeown (guitar, vocals) and Michael McGaughrin (drums). Bardot performed on 1990s' second album, Kicks, which was released in March 2009 on Rough Trade Records. He wrote two of the songs on the album, \\"Local Science\\" and \\"Sparks\\", and co-wrote \\"I Don't Even Know What That Is\\", \\"Balthazar\\" and \\"59\\", the later being released as a single. Over the winter of 2010/2011, the band recorded a third album but after parting with their record label, Rough Trade, it was never released. The 1990s disbanded in early 2012. Wife vs Secretary In 2012 Bardot joined Charlie Milne (vocals, piano), Ally Batten (bass) and Mark O‚Äô Donnell (drums) forming Wife vs Secretary. Though it was named after the Clark Gable film of the same name, the band vowed not to watch it. The Yummy Fur In 2017 Bardot on bass joined a re-formed The Yummy Fur, with original member John McKeown (vocals, guitar) and Paul Thomson (drums). Franz Ferdinand Bardot joined Franz Ferdinand in May 2017, replacing founding member Nick McCarthy. Whilst Bardot joined the band prior to the release of the band's fifth studio album, Always Ascending, in February 2018, it was after the recording sessions of the album had been completed.

After the war he became a national politician in the Soviet occupation zone, relaunched in 1949 as the German Democratic Republic / East Germany. He served as a relatively high-profile member of the powerful Politburo of the Central Committee between 1970 and 1989. In November 1989 he visited Moscow for eye surgery. While he was away the entire Politburo of which he was a member, resigned in 8 November 1989, and he too was excluded from it. On his return in January 1990 he was arrested, suspected of corruption and abuse of public office. This dramatic reversal of fortune came during a period of rapid political change. At the time of his death the arrest warrant had been rescinded and the case against him remained unproven, the necessary investigations having been delayed or suspended in response to his declining health.  Life   Provenance and early years  Hermann Axen was born in Leipzig. His father worked as a sales representative. His schooling took him to the \\"Realgymnasium\\" which in the eyes of British historian David Childs made him a \\"grammar school boy\\". His family background was evidently an intellectual one: a source mentions his father's large private library. The family adhered to the liberal branch of Judaism and he became a Bar Mitzvah. A year later he horrified his parents by renouncing religion. Two years after that (and less than a year before the Nazi take-over), influenced by his brother Rudolf, he joined the Young Communists.  Nazi Germany  He was affected by his brother's murder by the Gestapo which took place, following torture, at the main police station in Dresden on 23 September 1933.The date of Rudolf Aksen's death comes from his grave stone Rolf's body was promptly handed over to his parents following the killing. According to a personal \\"curriculum vitae\\" compiled by Axen in 1949 and later found in his \\"party file\\", his parents were killed by the Nazis after 1939/40 in \\"the ghetto\\" or concentration camp near Lviv/Lemberg. The coming to power of the Nazis at the start of 1933 had been followed by a rapid transition to one-party dictatorship which meant that any political activity outside the Nazi Party, and in particular political activity on behalf of the banned Communist Party, became illegal. Rolf Axen, until his killing, was leader of the underground Communist group in East Saxony. Hermann Axen undertook a course at the Marxist Workers' Academy (\\"Marxistische Arbeiterschule\\" / \\"MASch\\") in Leipzig during 1932/33 after which he took on a leadership role in the youth section in the party's Leipzig subdistrict (\\"Unterbezirk Leipzig\\"). As a seventeen year old, in Nazi Germany he served, in the words of one admiring source, as an illegal resistance worker, a \\"party instructor\\" and a party contact (\\"Verbindungsmann\\") in Saxony. Between March and November 1934 he undertook and completed a commercial apprenticeship with Hoffner, Moses & Co., a fur trading company. By June 1934 he was also responsible for agitation and propaganda (\\"Agitprop\\") for the local leadership for Leipzig-West of the underground Young Communists, identified among comrades by the code names \\"Max\\" and, subsequently, \\"Friedrich\\". In September 1934 he joined the Young Communists' Leipzig region leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\"). The group had by this point been effectively destroyed through arrests, and Axen now teamed up with a fellow young communist called Heinz Mi√ülitz to try and rebuild it. Hermann Axen was arrested, along with fourteen comrades, on 3 November 1934. He now presented himself as a Polish citizen and a disciple of the \\"Mosaic religious community\\". His papers were sufficiently convincing for the arrest to prompt an intervention by the Polish consulate in Leipzig. On 20 June 1935 he faced the district high court in Dresden. The charge was the usual one of \\"preparing to commit high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). He was convicted and sentenced to a three- year jail term which he served in the old penitentiary at Zwickau. He had already served seven months of his sentence while in pre-trial investigatory detention, and he was accordingly released in November 1937. Possibly on account of having presented himself to the authorities as a Polish citizen three years earlier, but possibly simply on account of his Communist activism and his Jewish family provenance, by this time he had been stripped of any residual German citizenship rights, and his release was made conditional on his immediately leaving the country.  French exile  Now stateless, and with the agreement of the party, he at once headed for Vienna, following a route which involved travelling via Poland. By this time, however, it was no secret that the German leader, backed on this point by widespread popular support in Germany and, more importantly, Austria, saw the independent Austrian state as an anomaly: with \\"Anschluss\\" looming ever larger on the horizon, in January 1938 Hermann Axen fled to Paris which since 1933, had served informally as one of two headquarter locations for the German Communist Party in exile. For the next couple of years, till 1940, he took casual work, employed in a support capacity in a range of businesses, while at the same time undertaking courier jobs for members of the illegal German Communist Party leadership. From April 1938 he was taking on \\"Red Aid\\" jobs for the (German) Young Communists. He also undertook translation jobs for \\"German Freedom Radio 29.8\\" (\\"Deutsche Freiheitssender 29,8\\"). From a Paris perspective the Second World War broke out in September 1939, when the German army invaded Poland and the French and British governments reacted by declaring war on Germany, but on the streets of Paris little changed till May 1940 when the Germans rapidly over-ran northern France. The authorities responded (as in England) by summarily identifying a large number of German political and race refugees from Nazism as enemy aliens and interning them, in the first instance, in a large Paris football stadium and subsequently in the Drancy internment camp. Possibly in connection with his legal stateless status, Axen avoided this fate and managed to escape to the southern half of France where a puppet government had been established under the leadership of the World War I hero Philippe P√©tain. However, still in May 1940 he was identified as a \\"stateless communist\\", arrested and interned in Camp Vernet, a vast holding camp in the mountains to the west of Perpignan, previously used to house returning fighters from the Spanish Civil War. In June 1940 the authorities reassigned the camp which was now to be used to accommodate \\"all foreigners considered suspect or dangerous to the public order\\". By the end of May 1940 it is estimated that Axen was one of at least 250 of the Camp Vernet inmates who were German-speaking political exiles, and the two years he spent at the camp afforded significant networking opportunities with men some of whom would become leading members of the political establishment in the German Democratic Republic after 1949. Concentration camps Over the next couple of years the Vichy government was increasingly marginalised, and by 1942 Gestapo officers were a regular sight on the streets of the cities in southern France. Security at Vernet no longer relied simply on its extremely remote location, and the camp was being described as a holding centre for Jewish families awaiting deportation to Nazi labour and extermination camps. In August 1942 Hermann Axen and various other internees picked out as Jewish communists, including Kurt Goldstein were handed over to the Gestapo, sent to the Paris area and placed on \\"Convoy 18 (12 August 1942)\\", one of the trains which, since March of that year, had been rolling across to Auschwitz-Birkenau in Silesia. He was held for more than two days at the main Auschwitz-Birkenau camp before being allocated to a sub-camp at Jawischowitz (as it was known to the Germans) where for more than two years he was set to work underground in the coal mines. It is recorded in sources that here he was a leader of the illegal camp committee. At least one source warns that as Hermann Axen rose in the East German political and media hierarchies, his role during his time in the Nazi concentration camp system was often exaggerated retrospectively. For the fifteenth edition of his \\"autobiography\\" a ghost writer presented a scene that involved Axen, armed with a machine pistol, storming an SS watch-tower: this is believed to be fiction. Manfred Uschner worked closely with Axen during the 1960s and 1970s, and described Axen the concentration camp inmate as \\"very cool and reserved\\". \\"In the concentration camp, as a relatively young comrade, he played no significant role, or at least not a strikingly positive one\\". Auschwitz concentration camp was emptied of its internees, as the Red army advanced from the east, in January 1945 and Axen was among the survivors transferred to Buchenwald near Weimar. Sources assert that he was a member of the illegal Communist Party leadership team in the concentration camp. As the war neared its end, in April 1945 it was US troops that liberated Axen from the Buchenwald camp.  Soviet occupation zone  Although the region of central southern Germany that included both Buchenwald and Axen's home city of Leipzig was liberated by US forces, the victorious allies had already agreed a postwar territorial division of Germany whereby the entire central portion of the country would be administered as the Soviet occupation zone. The Americans pulled their troops back to the agreed lines on their maps in July 1945, and by August 1945 Hermann Axen had been installed as Head of the Youth Committee with the appointed city council of Soviet-administered Leipzig and as a member of the regional leadership team (\\"Kreisleitung\\") of the local Communist Party. Between October 1945 and February 1946 he was Head of the Youth Committee for the entire Saxony region. In April 1946 he was one of thousands of Communist Party members who lost no in signing their party membership over to the newly formed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED. The SED was formed through a contentious merger of the Communist Party and the less Moscow oriented Social Democratic Party. Its promoters may have hoped that the merger would take effect across Germany, but in the event it was only possible obtain the support necessary for it to take effect in the Soviet occupation zone, where the SED quickly emerged as the permanent ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. For Hermann Axen 1946 was also the year in which he co-founded the \\"Anti-Fascist youth committee\\" (\\"antifaschistische Jugendausschu√ü\\"). Of greater long-term importance was his role as co-founder, together with Paul Verner und Erich Honecker of the Free German Youth (\\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\\" / FDJ), which very quickly became, in effect, the youth wing of the ruling SED. Between March 1946 and February 1949 he served as secretary to the FDJ National Council (\\"Zentralrat\\"). In 1948 he became a member of the People's Council (\\" Deutscher Volksrat\\"), a precursor parliament set up in the Soviet occupation zone and mandated to develop/endorse a constitution for the new Germany, based on a draft document issued by the ruling SED (party) three years earlier. In 1949/50 the \\"Volksrat\\" gave way to the People's Chamber (\\"Volkskammer\\"), a form of national parliament: at this point Axen was not a member. In 1954, however, he became a \\"Volkskammer\\" member, holding one of the 17 seats allocated for SED members representing the Greater Berlin region. In 1971 he took over from Rudolf Agsten as chair of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee. Hermann Axen remained a member of the \\"Volkskammer\\" till 16 November 1989, when his parliamentary mandate was revoked \\"by a resolution of the party Volkskammer group\\" (\\"Mandatsniederlegung nach Fraktionsbeschluss \\").  German Democratic Republic  In October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In practice the new country's constitutional arrangements followed not the written constitution formally proclaimed in October 1949 but a Leninist constitutional model. (A new written constitution, endorsed by referendum in 1968, would in most respects belatedly align the de jure and de facto positions.) Under the highly centralised Leninist constitutional structure, power flowed not from any national parliament nor indeed from government ministries. Power rested with the Central Committee of the ruling party. Key decisions were taken in the Central Committee Politburo which for most purposes was dominated by the First Secretary/General Secretary of the party. The extent to which the Central Committee monopolised political power was blurred to the extent that leading Central Committee members were often also, concurrently or successively, members of the Volkskammer and/or government ministers. Hermann Axen became a member of the Party Executive (\\"Partei Vorstand\\") in 1949, and he remained an important member as it quickly evolved into the Central Committee. Reflecting his interests and abilities, from 1949 he was in charge of the Central Committee's agitation and propaganda (\\"Agitprop\\") department. Between March 1949 and July 1953 he served as Central Committee Secretary with special responsibility for Mass Agitation and Press matters. One important task undertaken by the Central Committee's Agitprop chief involved radio transmissions originating in the Soviet occupation zone which he quickly and effectively reconfigured (or, in the words of at least one source, \\"purged\\") in 1949, introducing a consistency of editorial focus to ensure that broadcasts followed the ruling party line. A large number of senior managers were dismissed from the broadcasters' offices in Berlin, to be replaced by comrades who could be better trusted to conform. Sources also refer to the presence by 1950, of Central Committee \\"spies\\" among broadcasting staff The June 1953 uprising alarmed the East German leadership more than was apparent at the time. East German news broadcasts played down the wave of violently suppressed strikes and street protests, but many listeners in and close to Berlin were also able to listen to radio reports transmitted from West Berlin and received a different set of reports. The Central Committee's \\"Agitprop\\" secretary felt unable to pretend that nothing was happening, but his public response concentrated on the western broadcasts: he was able to deliver a suitably reassuring statement that the Soviet government would intervene with the western powers, and with its agents \\"roll up the whole West Berlin problem\\". Within days a major exercise in blame allocation followed, accompanied by sackings and demotions within the government. Those whom Walter Ulbricht mistrusted least tended to be those who, like him, had spent the Nazi years exiled in Moscow. That Hermann Axen had chosen to flee not to Moscow but to Paris back in 1938 had avoided the risk of being caught up in Stalin's purges, but fifteen years later it meant that while the country was led by Walter Ulbricht, Hermann Axen would never be a complete political insider. It was also self-evident that the events of June 1953 had represented a major \\"Agitprop\\" failure. Axen shared the responsibility for failing to curb the effectiveness of the ideological counter-offensive and the popularisation of the vernacular of the \\"Fascist Putsch\\". Hermann Axen retained his membership of the Central Committee, but he was stripped of his special secretarial responsibilities within it. Perhaps \\"election\\" to the Volkskammer in 1954 represented a consolation. He was also appointed, in succession to Erich H√∂nisch, Second Secretary to the regional party leadership team (\\"SED- Bezirksleitung\\") for Berlin in July 1953. Since Berlin had been the focus of street protests the previous month, it may well have been thought that Axen's \\"Agitprop\\" experience would have been of value, but sources nevertheless present this appointment as a significant demotion. In July 1956 he left his position with the party administration in Berlin as his career moved on. He was now appointed managing editor of Neues Deutschland, the party newspaper, and by far the most widely available daily newspaper in East Germany. He succeeded Georg Stibi in the editorial position. Stibli had been in post only since the previous year, but Hermann Axen remained managing editor till 1966. His ten years tenure in charge at the newspaper was the longest of any Neues Deutschland managing editor in the twentieth century. In September 1956 he was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit, indicating unambiguously that he was back in favour with the party. Further national awards followed over the next ten years. In addition, he served as a Berlin city councillor between 1963 and 1967. Having never lost his place in the Party Central Committee, in 1966 Hermann Axen was appointed Central Committee secretary for International Relations which made him, according to at least one source, the principal architect of East German foreign policy. His mandate also included matters involving the international communist and labour movements. He had been made a candidate for Politburo membership in January 1963, and in 1970, finally, he was elected to full membership, filling the vacancy arising through the illness and death of Paul Fr√∂hlich. During 1970 politburo members enjoyed a ringside seat in an increasingly frantic power struggle between the country's leader, Walter Ulbricht, and a would-be successor, second party secretary Erich Honecker. Ulbricht, was now in his mid-seventies, and when he dismissed Honecker from his party post he was immediately forced to reverse his position. The younger man enjoyed the backing of the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev. It was only in May 1971 that the Soviets forced the resignation of Walter Ulbricht, but during 1970 it became increasingly clear that Erich Honecker represented the future. Hermann Axen and Erich Honecker had worked closely together in the later 1940s on the launch of the FDJ). They remained close friends, and during the period 1971-1989, as he exercised his Politburo responsibilities for international relations, Hermann Axen's natural confidence in his intepersonal skills and intellectual abilities was matched by a political confidence that the leadership would always respect and usually follow his judgements, especially during the first decade or so after 1970. To commentators more familiar with western European government structures than with the party-focused model applied in countries under strong Soviet influence, it is noteworthy that in the German Democratic Republic under Honecker, Axen had far more power over East German foreign policy than Otto Winzer or Oskar Fischer, who served as Ministers for Foreign Affairs respectively from 1965 till 1975 and from 1975 till 1990, but neither of whom ever made it to the Politburo. Between November 1976 and 1989 Axen was a member of the politburo's \\"West Germany Working Group\\" (\\"Arbeitsgruppe BRD\\").  Honecker years  The relationship with West Germany was particularly important for the East German leadership, partly for reasons of shared history, language and culture, but also on account of shared interests between the two states. There was, in addition, a growing economic interdependency during the later 1980s. Axen was responsible for talks on disarmament that took place between East Germany's ruling SED (party) and West Germany's SPD (party) (which headed up that country's governing coalition between 1969 and 1982). He laid the diplomatic and practical groundwork for Erich Honecker's visits to the west, on which he would accompany his leader. From the standpoint of interested observers, Hermann Axen stood out from the mainstream of East German politicians. In East Germany he was known both for his diminutive (and increasingly plump) form and as an exceptionally able and experienced foreign policy operator. From his days in \\"Agitprop\\" and his ten- year editorship of Neues Deutschland he was respected as the \\"undisputed number one\\" when it came to thoughtful and effective mass communication. Western intelligence, meanwhile, saw him as \\"very pleasant\\", a polite and humorous individual completely unlike most members of the East German politburo. He was fluent not just in Russian, but also in French and English. He came across as something of an intellectual: he liked, on occasion, to quote Shakespeare. Western intelligence also believed that he enjoyed the complete confidence of Erich Honecker, both on questions of foreign policy and in matters of [socialist] ideology and theory. Intelligence analysts speculated that the close relationahip between the two men went back to their shared experiences: they had both served time in prison under the Nazis. They had started their party careers at the birth of the German Democratic Republic with their shared work on creating the FDJ). However, western analysts also received reports from their informants that Axen suffered from an inferiority complex, that he was short and by this time fat, with terrible eye-sight. He suffered from Diabetes and high blood pressure, and had been fitted with a heart pace-maker. There was speculation that this might have been behind reports to the effect that he was particularly considerate in looking after subordinates who were unwell and/or getting on in years. Axen was in the team that accompanied Erich Honecker to Helsinki in 1975 for the conference that delivered the Helsinki Accords. He served between 1981 and 1989 as a member of the politburo's \\"Commission for coordinating economic, cultural and technical- scientific relations with the countries of Asia, Africa and the Arabic region. He served on the presidium of the between 1982 and 1989.  Arrest, illness and death  Hermann Axen was arrested on 16 January 1990 at Berlin airport, as he arrived on a flight from Moscow. He was held on suspicion of corruption and abuse of office. His bank accounts, which he shared with his wife, were blocked. The arrest warrant was rescinded on 31 January 1990, however, because of his failing health. After reunification the Berlin district court rejected an application by the state prosecutor to re-open the case on 27 June 1991. The prosecutor appealed the decision, but the application had still not been heard on 15 February 1992 when Hermann Axen died of heart failure.Friedrich Wolff: Verlorene Prozesse: Meine Verteidigungen in politischen Verfahren. Abschnitt Gericht √ºber Hermann Axen (1989-1998).  Holiday home  In 1986 Hermann Axen had a holiday home built. In 1993 a Berlin court determined that the house had been built on land that he did not own and partly paid for from public funds. The subsequent upkeep of the property was paid for out of public funds. Axen had indeed paid rent, but the amount of the rent paid had been nominal. During the run-up to reunification, which formally took place in October 1990, holders of East German money were able to exchange their money for West German money at unrealistically favourable exchange rates. The arrangement was unpopular with West German central bankers, but was felt by the West German chancellor to be politically necessary. The first 4,000 Marks worth of an individual's savings could be converted at a rate of 1 for 1. Company debts and house loans were converted at the rate of 2 \\"East Marks\\" for each (western) Mark, while so-called \\"speculative money\\" was converted at a rate of 3:1. It therefore became important to be able to identify where money came from before converting it. During the \\"conversion period\\" Hermann Axen applied to convert a quarter of a million East Marks. The provenance of the money was declared to be as \\"regular income\\". In March 1990 East Germany had held its first (and last) free and fair general election. This meant that during the seven months between March 1990 and reunification the East German parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") was no longer the creature of the ruling SED (party). In July 1990 a parliamentary \\"ad hoc select committee\\", mandated to provide the necessary oversight, asked Hermann Axen to prove that the money he was seeking to convert had been acquired lawfully. (They asked Erich Honecker to provide similar proof in respect of the slightly smaller amount that he had applied to convert.) In the event the parliamentary committee only investigated conversion applications from senior East German politicians, but a Berlin court subsequently decided that the committee had simply focused on the largest amounts for which application to convert had been submitted: the high value applications were indeed restricted to senior members of the SED (party), but that should not be imputed to political motives on the part of committee members. In September 1990 the select committee, still not persuaded that Axen's savings had been lawfully acquired, ordered the confiscation of the monies in his relevant bank accounts. The committee gave as its reason that Axen had abused his office to benefit himself, applying self-conferred privileges and through transactions that grossly violated moral standards, in order to advantage himself and others, to the detriment of the national budget and other public funds (\\"...durch Missbrauch seiner Funktionen durch Inanspruchnahme von selbstbest√§tigten Privilegien und durch Handlungen, die einen gr√∂blichen Verstoss gegen die guten Sitten darstellen, sich und anderen pers√∂nliche Vorteile zum Nachteil der Gesellschaft und zu Lasten des Staatshaushalts und anderer gesellschaftlicher Fonds verschafft hat.\\"). The Axens lodged an appeal, but this was heard only in May 1993. The court upheld the judgement of the parliamentary select committee. Sonja Axen appealed that decision on behalf of the family, and in the end the case came to be heard by the European Court of Human Rights, where it was effectively joined with a broadly similar appeal being pursued by Margot Honecker. (Erich Honecker had died of liver cancer in 1994.). The appeals failed, however.  Personal  Hermann Axen appears to have married his wife, Sonja, in the later 1940s. The year of her birth is given as 1925 and she worked, during the East German period, as a contributing editor with Bummi, a monthly publication intended for small children, launched in 1957 and named after its leading character, a teddy bear. There are references to her having been a victim of Nazi persecution, like her husband, but further details are not provided. Their two daughters were born in 1950 and 1953.

Ingleheart read Literae Humaniores at Wadham College, and went on to complete her M.St. and D.Phil. there in 2004 on Ovid's Tristia, which was published in 2010. After teaching at Marlboro College, Vermont, Swansea University, and Keble and Wadham Colleges in Oxford, she joined Durham University as a lecturer in 2004 before becoming senior lecturer in 2012, associate professor and then Professor of Latin. Ingleheart is now head of the Department of Classics and Ancient History. Ingleheart has spoken frequently about her work on how modern cultures have responded to the phenomenon of Roman homosexuality, and the role which ancient Rome has played in modern ideas about sexuality. She ran a major British Academy funded conference in 2012, Romosexuality, on the subject which has shed considerable light on the differences between Roman and Greek conceptions of homosexuality, and differences from modern conceptions. Previously most work on classical homosexuality focused on Greek homosexuality and its modern reception, but Ingleheart's work has facilitated new research and interest in the Roman experience. The modern reception of Roman homosexuality in particular has led to Ingleheart's current work on, and translation of, AE Housman's Praefanda, a study of classical sexuality in Latin.

The image of a padlock superimposed over a circuit board pattern symbolizes internal protections in a computer system. automotive repair shops in California. Roses with protection against freezing - Volksgarten, Vienna Protection is any measure taken to guard a thing against damage caused by outside forces. Protection can be provided to physical objects, including organisms, to systems, and to intangible things like civil and political rights. Although the mechanisms for providing protection vary widely, the basic meaning of the term remains the same. This is illustrated by an explanation found in a manual on electrical wiring: Some kind of protection is a characteristic of all life, as living things have evolved at least some protective mechanisms to counter damaging environmental phenomena, such as ultraviolet light.Emily Monosson, Evolution in a Toxic World: How Life Responds to Chemical Threats (2012), p. 18. Biological membranes such as bark on trees and skin on animals offer protection from various threats, with skin playing a key role in protecting organisms against pathogens and excessive water loss. Additional structures like scales and hair offer further protection from the elements and from predators, with some animals having features such as spines or camouflage serving exclusively as anti-predator adaptations. Many animals supplement the protection afforded by their physiology by burrowing or otherwise adopting habitats or behaviors that insulate them from potential sources of harm. Humans originally began wearing clothing and building shelters in prehistoric times for protection from the elements.Jaquetta Hawkes, The Atlas of Early Man: The Rise of Man Across the Globe, From 35,000 B.C to A.D. 500 (1993), p. 21. Both humans and animals are also often concerned with the protection of others, with adult animals being particularly inclined to seek to protect their young from elements of nature and from predators. In the human sphere of activity, the concept of protection has been extended to nonliving objects, including technological systems such as computers, and to intangible things such as intellectual property, beliefs, and economic systems. Humans seek to protect locations of historical and cultural significance through historic preservation efforts, and are also concerned with protecting the environment from damage caused by human activity, and with protecting the Earth as a whole from potentially harmful objects from space.

Career He started his political life at a very early age in Popular Unity and then enrolled in the Italian Socialist Party in 1957. After graduating in Political Sciences at the Cesare Alfieri Institute of the University of Florence, in 1970 he was appointed coordinator of the Legislative Office of the Regional Council. He was elected municipal councilor in Florence uninterrupted between 1975 and 1989. He served as councilor for decentralization in 1975, with Mayor Elio Gabbuggiani, then became deputy mayor from 1979 to 1983. He has been councilor to culture with mayors Alessandro Bonsanti, Lando Conti and Massimo Bogianckino. He was elected Mayor of Florence twice: in 1989 he succeeded Bogianckino, supported by the same parties (PCI, PSI, PSDI and PLI); in 1990 he then formed a Pentapartito junta (DC, PSI, PSDI, PRI and PLI). He ran again for the office of Mayor in 1995 supported by Forza Italia and the Italian People's Party, but was defeated by Mario Primicerio. From 1995 to 1999 he sat in the city council. Giorgio Morales was an advocate for culture with a passion for refined wines and art books, as well as being a Socialist. As Valdo Spini was the first candidate to be considered as mayor of Florence; it was Craxi who recommended Morales as the appropriate alternative to Spini, believing that having Spini as mayor would set a dangerous precedent for following alliances. Giorgio Morales, along with the entire city council, resigned from being Mayor of Florence in 1990 amidst a time of racial strains and anti-immigration shortly after a violent attack on African immigrants. Immediately before Giorgio‚Äôs resignation, members of his coalition were unsupportive of his wanting to ‚Äúmilitarize‚Äù downtown Florence, a popular tourist location. The task force would be in place to combat deteriorization of the historic center and prevent violence as well as other crimes such as vandalism and sexual assaults. Upon leaving, Morales expressed his content with additional efforts to control racist attacks and crime in Florence. Morales had managed to receive police support from Rome during his time in office, which some citizens in Florence regarded ‚ÄúFlorence Besieged‚Äù (William Montalbano).

He is the founder and chief executive officer of DiMassimo Goldstein, a marketing, design and advertising agency based in New York City.  Career  DiMassimo founded DiMassimo Goldstein, sometimes called DiGo, in 1996. The agency describes itself as using ‚Äúbehavior change marketing to drive growth in brands and businesses that change lives for the better.‚Äù DiMassimo was previously creative director at the advertising agency Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners, and worked at other agencies, including J. Walter Thompson, Chapman Direct Advertising (a former unit of Young & Rubicam), Deutsch Inc. and BBDO. In 2015, DiMassimo Goldstein led a rebranding campaign for Weight Watchers, deemphasizing the counting of calories in favor of the company's newly introduced ‚ÄúFreestyle‚Äù program, which emphasized healthy foods. In 1990, at Chapman Direct Advertising, DiMassimo co-led the account for the AT&T; Universal Card, a credit card that attracted nearly 19 million customers by promising it would charge users no fees for life.  Commentary and media  DiMassimo is frequently interviewed as a brand expert by news outlets and industry publications. In June 2018, he discussed what President Trump's trade disputes with the European Union could mean for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In 2012 he gave perspective on presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, and the impact that widely publicized claims by his ex-wife about his past behavior would have on his image and chances in that year's Republican primary campaign. DiMassimo has argued that while advertising can be a powerful driver of behavioral and social change, it is becoming increasingly difficult to create influential campaigns in the digital age, when technology has made it easier for companies and brands come in direct contact with consumers.  Advertising campaigns  Clients of DiMassimo Goldstein have included FreshDirect, New York's Bronx Zoo, Jackson Hewitt, Ally, Proactiv, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and TradeStation.

Among these items is a silver coffee pot dated to 1757. The pot, a surviving example of french rococo dining ware, is currently on view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 545.  History  The growing popularity of coffee as consumer goods in the 18th century resulted in the production of various types of coffee pots or brewers. While coffee houses and the middle class of Europe employed copper pots to brew coffee, many wealthier consumers commissioned high quality appliances from artisan metalworkers. Created by masters of their craft, the best of these coffee pots were done in silver (which does not rust or tarnish easily) and where often intricately decorated.Meyers, Hannah (March 2005). \\"'Suave Molecules of Mocha' ‚Äì Coffee, Chemistry, and Civilization\\". Archived from the original on 21 February 2007. Retrieved 2 July 2018. Fran√ßois Thomas Germain was a widely noted master silversmith and metal worker in mid 18th century Paris. The son of another noted metalworking master, Germain gained fame for his production of complete sets of dining ware, including coffee pots. From 1748 to 1765 Germain's work made him the most fashionable silversmith in Paris, at one point operating a workshop that employed over one hundred workers. He often worked on commission for the royalty of France and other European countries. Germain's coffee pot was made as part of a set commissioned by King Joseph I of Portugal.  Description  The coffee pot is done in silver with a carved ebony handle. The metalwork of the object reflects the rococo school of art; the raised surface of the silver spirals up the body of the pot, creating the impression of movement. Floral patterns depicting a coffee plant are crafted around the base of the pot's handle, while leaves decorate its feet and legs. The spout of the pot is crafted to further the organic motif of the piece, and another floral arrangement decorates the lid of the pot. The smoothed ebony handle of the piece is detailed to allow for an easier grip. Germain marked (referred to as a \\"maker's mark) his work in several locations to relay the details of the pot to a viewer. The marks are as follows: = Underside (bottom) = * Marked with a crowned fleur-de-lis, F T G (Germain's small maker's mark), and a fleece (Germain's large maker's mark) * Marked with an A, a charge mark indicating the pot was produced in Paris * Marked with a Q, a warden's mark used to guarantee the pot was pure silver = Inside cover = * Marked with another fleur-de-lis, F T G, A, and Q = Rim = * Marked with a cow, indicating that the piece was intended for export = Handle = * Marked with a boar's head, a restricted warranty mark for silver products  Gallery  File:Coffeepot MET DP170816.jpgA different image of the pot File:Coffeepot MET 118420.jpgA crowned fleur-de-lis and F T G on the pot's inside cover File:Coffeepot MET 118421.jpgThe pot's bottom, marked with a crowned fleur-de-lis, F T G, and a fleece File:Coffeepot MET 118423.jpgThe rim of the pot, marked with a small cow indicating the object is intended for export File:Coffeepot MET DP103178.jpgThe spout of the pot  References  Category:Metalwork of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Silver objects ","title":"Coffeepot (Fran√ßois-Thomas Germain)"},{"id":"57827942","text":"The 2018 Nielsen Pro Tennis Championships was a professional tennis tournament played on hard courts.

Of Chinese- ancestry, she visited China, where she may have been the first female motion picture photographer and movie director in China.\\" Later in life she became an American actress and a touring Blues singer. A cover-girl for Liangyou pictorial magazine, she was labeled a flapper, a career woman, part of the movement of modern independent women worldwide which also included China's \\"new-age woman\\" (Êñ∞ÊôÇ‰ª£Â•≥ÊÄß) or \\"modern miss\\" (Êë©ÁôªÂ∞èÂßê), and the Japanese \\"modern girl\\". In 1926 she broke the taboo against kissing in Chinese movies, causing Chinese moviegoers to \\"gasp\\". Childhood Olive Young was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, to a Chinese-American family. Her father Dr. M. F. Young (Mon Fung Young) was born in California and worked as a doctor, running ads in the newspapers advertising his use of Chinese herbal medicines as cures for female diseases, chronic diseases, sexual weakness, kidney and stomach problems, nervous headaches, and rheumatism. Her mother, Chun She Young, a native of China was a housewife. Mrs. Young was listed as Georgia Young, in the 1910 U.S. Census in Kansas City (Ward 6), born in Missouri; however Olive listed her mother as born in China on the 1930 U.S. Census. When Olive was a girl, her parents took her to live in China for \\"a number of years\\", staying in Hong Kong. Afterward she attended school for a year in San Francisco and two more in Excelsior Springs, Missouri, before entering Christian College in Excelsior Springs. She came to public attention in October 1920 when she was \\"sixteen\\" and tried to elope. The newspaper said she was 16, but if she was born in July 1903, she would have been 17. She had to be carried back to her father, who tried to have the White-Slave Traffic Act used against the man she wanted to marry, who was 20.

I wanted adventure.\\" She traveled to China in 1922 and while there she got into acting, getting her first opportunity with the China Sun Motion Picture Company. She was to perform in Rouge with them, but ended up with the British American Tobacco Company, where she acted in her first three films. She stayed for several years, beginning a career in silent-picture movies. Finding success, she decided to pursue acting in Hollywood. She returned to the United States in 1929. Where she had starred in movies in China, a young attractive urban woman, in Hollywood she was only able to get typed roles. She was signed to play the leading role of a movie, Fools Luck with Hoot Gibson, announced November 17, 1929, but there is no information that the movie was made or released. In her final two films she didn't have named roles.

Following her film career, she moved on to music, traveling and performing a mix of Blues and Chinese music. Movies It was thought that none of Young's Chinese movies are known to have survived.

History The history of the Association of Black Sociologists began in 1968, when a group of American sociologists met to encourage the American Sociological Association (ASA) to increase the participation of black Americans in their ranks. It was established in 1970 as the Caucus of Black Sociologists (CBS) at that year's ASA meeting in Washington, D.C.. The CBS was influenced by both the women's liberation movement and opposition to the Vietnam War. In 1976, the CBS was incorporated as an independent organization, the Association of Black Sociologists. As a result, it ceased to be a caucus of the ASA. Membership When it was founded in 1970, the ABS (then known as the CBS) had 76 members, a number which had grown to 88 by 1979.

Voters will elect a new president, as well as 600 members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, each for a term of five years. Background Elections of 2018 The previous Turkish general election took place on 24 June 2018. The election marked the country's transition from a parliamentary system to a presidential one, as narrowly endorsed by voters in the controversial 2017 constitutional referendum. That election resulted in a victory for incumbent president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, who had held the position since 2014. Meanwhile, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) lost its absolute majority in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey for the first time since June 2015, forcing it to rely on its ally, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) of Devlet Bah√ßeli, to pass legislation. The office of the Prime Minister of Turkey was abolished on 12 July 2018, and its last holder, Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m, took office as the Speaker of the Grand National Assembly. Although there were speculations about a snap election that was supposed to be held in 2023, Bahceli ruled them out. In a written statement, he said that elections would not be held before 2023. He also confirmed that the current coalition between AKP and MHP will remain intact and Erdogan will be their joint nominee for President.https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/elections/general-elections-to- be-held-in-2023-early-elections-out-of-question-mhps-bahceli-says/amp Electoral system The President of Turkey, who serves as the country's head of state and government, is directly elected through the two-round system, under which a candidate must obtain an absolute majority of votes in order to be elected. If no candidate secures an overall majority outright, a runoff is held between the two most voted-for candidates from the first round, the winner of which is then declared elected. This electoral system was first introduced for the 2014 presidential elections, when it replaced a system of indirect elections under which the president was elected by parliament. The president is subject to term limits, and may serve at most two consecutive five-year terms. However, it has been speculated that incumbent president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan could be eligible to seek a third term in 2023, since the current executive presidential system was only fully implemented after the conclusion of his first term in office, meaning that his period in power from 2014 to 2018 would not count towards his two-term limit. In order to participate in a presidential election, a candidate must have received the nomination of a political party that either obtained 5% of the vote in the most recent parliamentary election, or that holds at least 20 seats in parliament. Other prospective candidates may still obtain ballot access if they are able to collect signatures from 100,000 eligible voters. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey is composed of 600 members, who serve five-year terms adjacent to those of the president. These representatives are elected through a form of party-list proportional representation from 87 electoral districts, by the D'Hondt method. The electoral districts largely correspond to the provinces of Turkey, though provinces with larger populations are divided into multiple districts. Specifically, Istanbul and Ankara are each divided into three districts, while Izmir and Bursa are divided in two. Political parties must be officially organised in at least half of the country's provinces (41 or more) and in at least a third of districts in those provinces, and must nominate two candidates in 41 or more provinces, in order to be entitled to seats. Since the introduction of the Constitution of 1982, political parties are also required to pass an electoral threshold of 10% in order to qualify for seats in parliament. Parties that fail to cross the threshold are disregarded for seat allocation purposes.

It caused widespread drought, hosepipe bans, crop failures, and a number of wildfires. These wildfires worst affected northern moorland areas around the Greater Manchester region, the largest was at Saddleworth Moor and another was at Winter Hill, together these burned over of land over a period of nearly a month. A heat wave was officially declared on 22 June, with Scotland and Northern Ireland recording temperatures above for the first time since the July 2013 heat wave. The British Isles were in the middle of a strong warm anticyclone inside a strong northward meander of the jet stream, this was part of the wider 2018 European heat wave. The Met Office declared summer 2018 the joint hottest on record together with 1976, 2003 and 2006.Summer 2018 was UK's joint hottest on record, Met Office says The Guardian Weather earlier in 2018 Spring started with record cold in early March with the 2018 Great Britain and Ireland cold wave. There were three spells of summer heat afterwards, starting in mid-April. The April 2018 heatwave began on 18 and 19 April. St James's Park in London recorded the country's hottest April day in nearly 70 years when temperatures reached . The unseasonably hot weather lasted for four days. On 22 April, the hottest London Marathon ever was recorded, with the temperature reaching . No national records were broken, but many places set local record high temperatures for April. After a cooler period from the end of April, temperatures started to rise again during early May. The May Day bank holiday was the hottest on record, with west London recording . A few days later, temperatures began to fall, but were still above average. Temperatures began to rise even higher towards the end of May. It sparked violent thunderstorms leading to flash flooding, giving some parts of the country their first measurable precipitation during May. On 27 May, of torrential rain fell at Winterbourne, West Midlands, causing a flash flood. The majority of the country was hot and sunny. May 2018 was one of the warmest and sunniest on record in the UK. Before the heat wave, anticyclonic conditions prevailed across the UK. May and early June had been much warmer and drier than average, the latter being the driest since 1925 due to a persistently strong Azores High. This high-pressure block prevented Atlantic low-pressure weather systems from reaching the British Isles. Summer heat wave The heat wave began on 23 June 2018 as high pressure built across the UK. Temperatures gradually rose, and new records were set in towns and cities across the British Isles. These include Glasgow in Scotland, Shannon in Ireland and both Belfast and Castlederg in Northern Ireland. This temperature rise was part of a heat wave that spanned the entire Northern Hemisphere. The heat wave had seen the hottest night ever recorded on Earth in Oman, with the lowest temperature recorded at , and the deaths of at least 33 people in Canada. Wildfires began to break out across England. The two largest fires broke out at Saddleworth Moor on 25 June, and at Winter Hill on 28 June, the former being England's largest in living memory. As of September 2018, arrests have been made on the charge of arson, yet the cause of these fires is undetermined. However, the factor that allowed the fires to establish was the persistently hot and breezy weather conditions. This dried out vegetation and the underlying peat, allowing it to easily burn. On 2 July, forecasters predicted that high pressure would continue over the UK and that the heat wave could continue for another two weeks. On 5 July, a weak weather front arrived from the west, but was mostly halted over Ireland and the Irish Sea. This caused some scattered showers over the Pennines, and a thunderstorm that caused flash floods in Tunbridge Wells.BBC TV 1 News, 6 pm to 7 pm, 5 July 2018 The weather also affected roads nationwide, and gritters were mobilised due to the asphalt concrete softening under the extreme heat. In Heaton, Newcastle, a man sank into a melted road and required a rescue from firefighters, and a bin lorry sank into a road in Newbury, Berkshire. On 10 July, a weak cold front crossed Britain from north to south, bringing low cloud levels and scattered showers. However, this cool air was quickly heated by the sun the next day, increasing temperatures yet again. The Met Office announced that the highest temperature on 24 July was , recorded at Santon Downham in Suffolk. Effects on the economy The long period of dry warm weather, although with unpleasant levels of humidity, strongly boosted the domestic tourism trade during this period. The official Visit Britain body forecast the number of international visitors to the UK would increase by around 15% from the USA alone, as the effect of the worldwide Royal Wedding publicity fed through into fine summer weather and late holiday bookings.The Week, 12 July 2018, \\"Mediterranean temperatures lead to an increase in 'staycations' ‚Äì and a surge in foreign visits\\". Hotels in competing Mediterranean resorts, such as Ibiza, were forced to slash their prices as demand from British tourists declined sharply as people decided to holiday in the British Isles.\\"Sharp decline in Ibiza tourism this summer forces hotels to slash prices\\", Mixmag, 11 July 2018. Remoter resorts and destinations benefited from visitors' attempts to escape the domestic crowds, and rural Ireland reported a dramatic increase in tourism with an average of 70% occupancy rates at smaller establishments.News Highland radio, \\"Staycations boost Irish tourism this summer\\", 12 July 2018. Many companies concerned with outdoor activities reported the usual boost in sales that comes from a good summer, and estate agents reported that the warm dry summer was also helping their industry.

Health effects The heatwave added to pressure on the NHS, on A&E; departments and elsewhere. Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said, \\"I am very worried about the impact on the NHS of this summer. We know that this hot weather, (...) affects very elderly, vulnerable people. We know that asthma sufferers suffer particularly badly in the weather. [Ashworth mentioned his first hand experiences shadowing a hospital consultant] with lots of elderly vulnerable people being admitted to A&E;, lying on trolleys because there‚Äôs no beds in the hospital\\". There are fears of over 1,000 excess deaths during the current heat wave. The Environmental Audit Committee of MP's fears 7,000 heat-related UK deaths annually by 2050 unless the government acts promptly. Chair of the committee, Mary Creagh said, \\"The government must stop playing pass the parcel with local councils and the NHS and develop a strategy to protect our ageing population from this increasing risk\\". At risk, groups include elderly people, small children and people with heart and/or lung conditions. There are calls for government regulations to protect an ageing population from the effects of heat, effects include increased risk of death. During the 2003 European heat wave in some areas of the UK there were 42% increased deaths in nursing homes and the MP's want hospitals and care homes to be inspected to find out if they can cope with extreme heat. The TUC and others are calling for regulations about maximum workplace temperatures. Frances O'Grady of the TUC stated, \\"With heatwaves becoming more common, we need clear and sensible rules to protect working people. We‚Äôve had legal minimum temperatures at work for a long time, which work very well. The government must now act quickly on the recommendation by MPs for maximum limits on how hot workplaces can get\\". Also, dress codes for work and school uniform policy should be relaxed during heatwaves to improve work productivity and school learning. Ministers withdrew money for climate change adaptation officers in local authorities. Lack of \\"joined-up thinking\\" between government departments and lack of communication between the government and the public add to the death toll. Heatwave alerts are put out only if temperatures are over 30 ¬∞C, but heat-related deaths start at 25 degrees.Regular heatwaves 'will kill thousands BBCHeat-related deaths will treble by 2050 unless government takes urgent action, warn MPs 'The IndependentUK heatwave creating summer crisis for NHS, says Labour The GuardianUnions say action needed to protect UK workers in heatwave The Guardian There were excess deaths during the 2018 heat wave but the cause is not yet known.Deaths spiked during UK heatwave BBC Drought Stocks Reservoir on 12 July On 29 June, Northern Ireland Water introduced the first hosepipe ban in Northern Ireland since 1995.

Smith further discussed the risk posed by depleted reservoirs that would normally be used for irrigation, and stated that there was a potential risk to vegetable production should the weather continue. Sporting events A number of sporting events have experienced unusual conditions as a result of the heatwave. The 2018 Open Championship which was held from 19‚Äì22 July at Carnoustie, Scotland was played with unusually brown, dry and sunbaked fairways and brown rough. The India cricket team toured England during the heat wave, with their tour match against Essex being reduced from four days to three because of the high temperatures. Archaeological discoveries The dry weather caused patterns of vegetation to be revealed, indicative of Roman and pre-Roman settlements. Drainage ditches that had surrounded Iron Age hill forts and Roman settlements became filled in once those settlements were no longer in use, meaning they have a deeper quantity of topsoil and, thus, retain moisture for plants for longer. The use of aerial images to identify arch√¶ological sites through cropmarks has been a methodology employed by archaeologists for decades. The National Monuments Service of the Irish Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht said that the increased use of aerial drone photography and the exceptional dry weather was leading to some remarkable discoveries. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales observed such indications of historical settlements across Wales, including at in , at the Cross Oak Hillfort near Talybont-on-Usk, at Caerwent, Monmouthshire and newly-discovered settlements near Magor, Monmouthshire and Langstone, Newport. Similarly, the National Monuments Service of the Irish Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht announced the discovery of a possible henge, in diameter, near the UNESCO World Heritage Site of , near Newgrange, County Meath. Statistics Rainfall The drought conditions were not as bad as the mid 1970s drought. June was notably dry, especially after a very dry May. The worst affected regions were England and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland also had below average rainfall, but this was unexceptional. Some places had no rain at all. Temperature The Met Office considers the summer of 2018 to be tied with 1976, 2003 and 2006 as the hottest summer on record for the United Kingdom as a whole, with average temperatures of . In England, average temperatures for the summer were the highest on record at , narrowly ahead of the average in 1976. However, in the CET records (Central England Temperature records that go back to 1659), 2018 comes in 5th behind 2003, 1995, 1826 and 1976.https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/ssn_HadCET_mean_sort.txt =June= In Wales and Northern Ireland, June 2018 was the warmest June ever recorded and in England and Scotland, June 2018 ranks within the five warmest on record. In the Central England region, the CET is a long running temperature series, with records back to 1659. 2018's temperature was , meaning it ranks as the 18th warmest June recorded in England in the past 359 years, also being the warmest since 1976. =July= July 2018 was again, a very hot month, with the Central England Temperature showing that July 2018 is the fourth-hottest month recorded since 1659.

It ranges from sea level to in depth. Females generally range from about in length, and males generally range from about in length. Description C. glacialis females generally range from about in length, and males generally range from about in length. Habitat and distribution This copepod is found in the northwestern Atlantic, the adjoining waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Greenland Sea, Barents Sea, Norwegian Sea, and the central Arctic Ocean, and northwestern Pacific, in the Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea. It ranges from sea level to in depth. Ecology Reproduction and lifecycle Depending on the conditions, it has a one to three year lifecycle. There are six nauplii and copepodite stages. Eggs are laid during the spring, with clutches typically being 40 to 80 eggs. During the summer, when temperatures are below , it takes about 46 days to go from an egg to a stage I copepodite. The other stages are mainly gone through during the summer. During the autumn, it accumulates lipids before entering diapause, usually as a stage IV or V copepodite. During mid-winter, stage V copepodites develop into females. When breeding, C. glacialis can follow multiple strategies. When found in ice-covered areas, it uses the ice algae bloom to fuel reproduction. This is consistent with a strategy of income breeding, where resources collected during breeding are used to pay for it. When in primarily ice-free areas without an early ice algae bloom, it instead relies on previously collected resources to breed, making it a capital breeder in these cases. In both scenarios, the young take advantage of the phytoplankton bloom. Feeding C. glacialis is a filter-feeder, mainly feeding on microalgae during the spring bloom.

Contents Dungeon Floors is a set of cards which can be cut up to provide wood and stone floors, stairways, etc., for gaming miniatures. Dungeon Floors was composed of a set of nine cardboard sheets which could be used to create tiles that could be arranged to represent different layouts for role-playing spaces, such as building interiors, caverns, underground passages. There was also an instruction folder describing how to use the tiles and how to integrate the marked spaces on them with common RPG rulesets. The spaces were sized to take 25mm miniatures, such as those made by Heritage and most other companies at the time.  Editions  There were three editions of Dungeon Floors. The first was a shrink-wrapped group of thin card pieces printed with black ink only. The second edition was printed in two-color format (black ink and brown ink). The third edition was boxed, and printed in full-color with detailed realistic artwork. The first two editions were part of Heritage's Dungeon Builders line of products, which featured molded 3-D walls with stone and other textures.

Tony's Mound is one of two monumental earthwork complexes built in southern Florida by the Glade cultures around 1000 BCE using unique and distinct sand ridges, causeways and mounds. The other site is Big Mound City, twenty-five miles to the northeast in Palm Beach County. The ritual complex was first described in print by Ross Allen in the 1948. Aerial photography showed a site consisting of nine raised causeways radiating from an immense plaza and central flat mound/midden on privately owned land used for cattle ranching.  History  In 1946, Ross Allen planned a ten-day expedition with George Espenlaub, Ned Moren, George J. Leahy, Bob Morrow, and George Marnhout. Before setting out, George Marnhout flew over the site while Lawrence Bright filmed and photographed from the plane. The group traveled all day on swamp buggies until they set up camp under a hammock, ten minutes from the mounds. During their visit, they found the grassy site to be very dry, about three miles northeast of cypress swamps. Allen reports that the area was \\"so extensive, that it cannot be seen in its entirety from the ground, but as we measured and walked over the area, we became more fascinated by this strange group.\\" He also reported that the mound was 580 feet diameter with circumference of 1665 feet. He said that a \\"roadway-like embankment\\" was about 10 to 15 feet wide. Allen further described \\"raised pathways,\\" six feet in width, connecting the main circle to 19 to 22 smaller circles surrounding it. Beyond the mounds, Allen notes that there was a stand-alone \\"crescent-like raised earthwork.\\" On Tony's Mound, the main mound measuring 110 feet by 83 feet, they found sugarberries, banyan, mulberries, papaya, saw palmetto and other small plants. Extending from the north side of the mound, there was a \\"canal-like depression 600 feet long, flanked by spoil banks or raised pathways 30 feet in width.\\" The largest mound was measured to be \\"390 feet in length and 135 feet wide; there is a small canal leading to it.\\" There was a potential burial mound about a quarter of a mile to the northwest, covered by trees and vegetation. Allen suspected that the area was surrounded by deep water, which \\"doubtless provided both fishing and water transportation\\" with \\"good hunting and palm materials for construction.\\" He also notes that \\"wild turkey and deer abound\\" around the mounds. According to Allen, \\"there had been deep water next to the homes of the Indians, and that the canals certainly provided a waterway to the most important mounds,\\" with the mounds being the only potential dry land. From 1980 to the present, leading archaeologists, including Jerald T. Milanich, have referenced the site and its importance. Milanich used Tony's Mound as an example of engineering by the \\"Belle Glade culture\\". In 2014, after excavating the related Fort Center site in Glades County, Thompson and Pluckhahn concluded that Tony's Mound, Big Mound City and Fort Center represented the most important \\"earthworks built by hunter-gathers in world prehistory\\".

Metal arene complexes are organometallic compounds of the formula (C6R6)xMLy. Common classes of are of the type (C6R6)ML3 and (C6R6)2M. These compounds are reagents in inorganic and organic synthesis. The principles that describe arene complexes extend to related organic ligands such as many heterocycles (e.g. thiophene) and polycyclic aromatic compounds (e.g. naphthalene). Synthesis structure of (C6H6)Ti(Cl2AlCl2)2, illustrative intermediate in Fischer-Hafner syntheses. Fischer‚ÄìHafner synthesis Also known as reductive Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reaction, the Fischer‚ÄìHafner synthesis entails treatment of metal chlorides with arenes in the presence of aluminium trichloride and aluminium metal. The method was demonstrated in the 1950s with the synthesis of bis(benzene)chromium by Walter Hafner and his advisor E. O. Fischer. The method has been extended to other metals, e.g. [Ru(C6Me6)2]2+. In this reaction, the AlCl3 serves to remove chloride from the metal precursor, and the Al metal functions as the reductant. The Fischer-Hafner synthesis is limited to arenes lacking sensitive functional groups. Mo(Œ∑6-C6H3Me3)(CO)3. Direct synthesis By metal vapor synthesis, metal atoms co-condensed with arenes react to give complexes of the type M(arene)2. Cr(C6H6)2 can be produced by this method. Cr(CO)6 reacts directly with benzene and other arenes to give the piano stool complexes Cr(C6R6)(CO)3. The carbonyls of Mo and W behave comparably. The method works particularly well with electron-rich arenes (e.g., anisole, mesitylene). The reaction has been extended to the synthesis of [Mn(C6R6)(CO)3]+: :BrMn(CO)5 \\\\+ Ag+ \\\\+ C6R6 ‚Üí [Mn(C6R6)(CO)3]+ \\\\+ AgBr + 2 CO From hexadienes Few Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes react directly with arenes. Instead, arene complexes of these metals are typically prepared by treatment of M(III) precursors with cyclohexadienes. For example, heating alcohol solutions of 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexadiene and ruthenium trichloride gives (benzene)ruthenium dichloride dimer. The conversion entails dehydrogenation of an intermediate diene complex. Alkyne trimerization Metal complexes are known to catalyze alkyne trimerization to give arenes. These reactions have been used to prepare arene complexes. Illustrative is the reaction of [Co(mesitylene)2]+ with 2-butyne to give [Co(C6Me6)2]+. Structure In most of its complexes, arenes bind in an Œ∑6 mode, with six nearly equidistant M-C bonds. The C-C-C angles are unperturbed vs the parent arene, but the C-C bonds are elongated by 0.2 √Ö. In some complexes, the arene binds through four carbons (Œ∑4 bonding), in which case the arene is no longer planar. A well studied example is [Ru(Œ∑6-C6Me6)(Œ∑4-C6Me6)]0, formed by the reduction of [Ru(Œ∑6-C6Me6)2]2+. In the fullerene complex Ru3(CO)9(C60), the fullerene binds to the triangular face of the cluster. Hapticity change for bis(hexamethylbenzene)ruthenium. Reactivity When bound in the Œ∑6 manner, arenes often function as unreactive spectator ligands, as illustrated by several homogeneous catalysts used for transfer hydrogenation, such as (Œ∑6-C6R6)Ru(TsDPEN). In cationic arene complexes or those supported by several CO ligands, the arene is susceptible to attack by nucleophiles to give cyclohexadienyl derivatives. Particularly from the perspective of organic synthesis, the decomplexation of arenes is of interest. Decomplexation can often be induced by treatment with excess of ligand (MeCN, CO, etc).

He made large collections of bird specimens while living and working in remote regions of Western Australia.  Biography  Born in the town of Masham in Yorkshire, England, to Amelia Mary Carter, n√©e Rhodes on the 6 April 1863. His merchant father, James, is said to have shared an interest in wildlife. Carter had published papers on British birds, and made observations in Iceland, before travelling to Western Australia. He arrived at Carnarvon to work at Boolathanna station, later acquiring a pastoral lease around Point Cloates. Carter married Annie Ward when back in England in 1903, and returned to settle at a Broomehill property. Illness reportedly required his family to return to England in 1914, living in Sutton, Surrey, but he returned to the region for several expeditions, the last in 1928. Thomas Carter died in Yorkshire, 29 January 1931, and is buried there.  Works  Tom Carter's arrival in Western Australia reopened ornithological study of the regions birds, following a period of few collections and little research. While working in his first job as a Jackaroo, Carter used his spare time to make observations and collect bird skins and eggs in the Gascoyne district. He later studied the North West Cape and Broomehill regions. He also made an expedition to Dirk Hartog Island in 1916, where he made the first observations of the Black-and-white Wren and the Western Grass-wren since their first collection one hundred years before. Carter made a collection of around five hundred bird skins from Western Australia, which he delivered to England in 1903 and was eventually included in the Tring Collection and at the American Museum of Natural History. Carter made a significant contribution to the ornithological literature on Australian birds, his notes and papers from Western Australia appearing in The Zoologist and The Emu. In his article, 'Birds Occurring in the Region of the North-West Cape', (Emu, 1903.), Carter gives the names of birds in the Talaindji language. Carter published 'Birds of the Broome Hill District', where he had lived for a decade, in the Emu in 1923‚Äì24.

It is native to northwestern Europe. It was first described as Asterias oculata by the British zoologist Thomas Pennant in 1777, later being transferred to the genus Henricia. Description Henricia oculata (NB: This translates from Latin as \\"eyed Henry\\") is a five-armed starfish that grows to a diameter of about . It is rather rigid and the aboral (upper) surface feels rough due to there being numerous low spines under the skin. It is variable in colour, being dark red, brown, purple or yellowish, the outer portions of the arms sometimes being paler than the disc and inner portions. It is very similar in appearance to Henricia sanguinolenta, but tends to have more irregularly arranged dorsal spinelets that are more opaque. Distribution The species is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, mainly around the coasts of the United Kingdom and Ireland. It also occurs in Guernsey, Jersey and northern France, and there have been isolated occurrences in Norway and the United States. It is most common on the western coasts of the British Isles and occurs on rock, boulders, stones, shingle, gravel, and shelly substrates. Its depth range is from the low intertidal down to or more. Ecology Primarily a suspension feeder, H. oculata consumes suspended organic particles, detritus, sponges, hydroids and bryozoans, but the starfish can supplement these by everting its stomach to feed on other invertebrates. More than 90% of individuals of this species are associated with a parasitic copepod, Asterocheres lilljeborgi.

She was the mother of Malcolm X.  Early years and family  Little was born in La Digue, St. Andrew, Grenada, to Edith Langdon. Edith was the daughter of Jupiter and Mary Jane Langdon, \\"liberated Africans\\" who were primarily captured from what is now Nigeria, subsequently freed from the slave ship by the Royal Navy and then settled in the Grenadian village of La Digue. When she was 11 years old, Edith, one of six children of the Langdons, was raped by a \\"significantly older\\" Scottish man named Edward Norton, resulting in Louise, her only child. Little was raised by her grandparents, Jupiter and Mary Jane, until his death in 1901 and hers in 1916.McDuffie, pp.152‚Äì153. She was educated in a local Anglican school, and was fluent in English, French and Grenadian Creole French. After her grandmother's death, she emigrated from Grenada in 1917 to Montreal, where her uncle Edgerton Langdon introduced her to Garveyism and the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA).McDuffie, p.155.  Career  Through the UNIA in Montreal, she met Earl Little, a craftsman and lay minister from Reynolds, Georgia. The couple married on May 10, 1919.McDuffie, p.155. The following year they moved to Philadelphia, and then to Omaha, Nebraska in 1921. While in Omaha, she became the secretary and \\"branch reporter\\" of the UNIA's local chapter, sending news of local UNIA activities, led by Earl, to Negro World; they inculcated self-reliance and black pride in their children. Their son Malcolm, who became famous as Malcolm X, later said that white violence killed four of his father's brothers. Another son, Wilfred, later remembered that Louise \\"received letters from the leaders of the movement thanking her for the work she had done and praising her for her devotion to the cause\\". Earl and Louise had seven children together: Wilfred (1920‚Äì1998), Hilda (1921‚Äì2015), Philbert (1923‚Äì1993), Malcolm (1925‚Äì1965), Reginald (1927‚Äì2001), Wesley (1928‚Äì2009) and Yvonne (1929‚Äì2003). Because of Ku Klux Klan threatsEarl's UNIA activities were said to be \\"spreading trouble\\"the family relocated in 1926 to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and shortly thereafter to Lansing, Michigan. There the family was frequently harassed by the Black Legion, a white racist group. When the family home burned in 1929, Earl accused the Black Legion.Natambu, p.4. In 1931, Earl died in what was officially ruled a streetcar accident, though Louise believed Earl had been murdered by the Black Legion. Rumors that white racists were responsible for Earl's death were widely circulated, and were very disturbing to Louise and their children.Marable, MalcolmX, p.29. After a dispute with creditors, Louise received a life insurance benefit (nominally $1,000about $,000 in dollars) in payments of $18 per month;Marable, MalcolmX, p.32 the issuer of another, larger policy refused to pay, claiming her husband Earl had committed suicide.Natambu, p.10.

Additionally, at the time, Lomedic was placed by the United States Treasury Department on a list of 10 companies linked to drug trafficking activity; he was removed from this list on 10 January 2012,Federal Register: \\"Unblocking of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons Pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act\\", published 18 January 2012 though a 2017 report returned him to the list and linked him to Ra√∫l Flores Hern√°ndez's money laundering operation by way of a company called Servicios Educativos y de Negocios, S.A. de C.V. In 2011, Lomel√≠ founded another company, Laboratorios SOLFRAN, a Guadalajara-area maker of generic medicines. Together with another company, Abastecedora de Insumos para la Salud, owned by a close political friend of Lomel√≠, the companies received 307 federal contracts for a total of 883.8 million pesos from 2013 to 2017. Lomel√≠ was a PRD precandidate for governor in 2006 but ultimately ran for senator and lost; he would run for the Senate again in 2012 with the same result. After the 2012 election, he switched parties to Movimiento Ciudadano, which placed him on its party list for the first electoral region for the 2015 elections and sent him to the Chamber of Deputies. In two and a half years in the federal legislature, he was a secretary on two commissions and sat on four others. In March 2017, Lomel√≠ changed parties again, switching to Morena, where he was designated the state party's coordinator of organization. In February 2018, he resigned from the Chamber of Deputies in order to run for Governor of Jalisco as the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition candidate. Lomel√≠ finished second with 24.38 percent of the vote, behind winning candidate Enrique Alfaro Ram√≠rez of Movimiento Ciudadano.

The film stars Melvil Poupaud, Denis M√©nochet and Swann Arlaud as three survivors of a Catholic priest's abuse who, as adults, set out to expose the sexual abuse hidden by the Catholic Church. It premiered at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival and won the Jury Grand Prix. The film was released in France on 20 February 2019 and in Belgium a week later, and has received critical acclaim. Plot Alexandre, Fran√ßois and Emmanuel were victimized as children by the venerable and predatory Father Bernard Preynat. As adults, when they discover that their former tormentor has been reassigned and has apparently been shielded all along by the Catholic Church, the men, still scarred and facing near-insurmountable challenges to their faith, begin a movement to bring the guilty to account.

It was first published in Portuguese in 1880. The first English version, translated by Richard Franko Goldman, was published by The Bodley Head in 1965. A translation by Margaret Jull Costa, was published by Dedalus Books in 1993. A revised version was published by Dedalus in 2009, together with three short stories. Background The story was serialized in a shorter version in the Di√°rio de Portugal and, with the addition of six chapters, it was sold as a book in 1881. It was initially attacked as being a departure from the realist style used by E√ßa in his earlier works. He was also accused of plagiarising the idea from a story by Alphonse Daudet, although The Mandarin was accepted for serialization in the French Revue Universelle Internationale in 1884. The Plot Teodoro, a poor Portuguese civil servant in Lisbon, receives a visit from the Devil in disguise who offers him the chance of inheriting unlimited riches if he rings a bell placed on a book by his side, which will lead to the death of a rich Mandarin, Ti Chin-fu, in distant China. This Teodoro duly does, resulting in his inheriting the Mandarin's fortune and starting to spend enormous sums. However, he finds that fabulous wealth brings with it unexpected problems. In time, remorse sends him to China to look for the dead Mandarin‚Äôs family. Failing to find them, he returns to Lisbon still haunted by the crime. His attempts to renounce the inheritance come to nothing. Sensing that he is dying he bequeaths his millions to the Devil, with the observation that ‚ÄúThe only bread that tastes good is the bread we earn day by day with our own hands: never kill the Mandarin‚Äù. Reviews Keates describes the novella as a \\"brilliant mischievous essay in fantasy chinoiserie, irreverently subverting the trope, created half a century earlier by Balzac in La Peau de chagrin, of the Oriental curse masquerading as a blessing\\". Another reviewer considers that the choice made by Teodoro was a ‚Äúreworking of the ‚ÄòMandarin paradox‚Äô first posed by French writer Chateaubriand in 1802‚Äù. Sobre notes the way E√ßa uses allegory to make criticism of society and the human condition, observing that the novel provides interesting observations on the relationship between people‚Äôs possessions and the way others treat them, as well as on the morality of humans.

Coat of Arms The blazon of the Arni Coat of Arms is Per Deum et ferrum obtinui which means By God and my sword I have obtained. History Arni jagir was granted to Vedaji Bhaskar Rao Pant by the Shahaji in 1640. Shivaji having failed in his negotiation, Sultanate of Bijapur took Arni and various other forts, and forcibly occupied the whole of Shahji's jagir in the Mysore. The Jagir of Arni was again granted as a gift to Vedaji Bhaskar pant by the Sultanate of Bijapur. In early 1677 Shivaji and his military forces set out towards Golconda. He met Kootab Shah and negotiated a secret pact for a division of his intended conquests in the Carnatic ( excluding those that earlier belonged to his father, Shahji). The spoils were to be divided between Shivaji, Kootab Shah and Bijapur. With the agreement concluded and with Kootab Shah giving him money, horses and artillery, Sivajee set out in March 1677 for his invasions via Kurnool, Cuddapah and Madras. He conquered Gingee and Vellore and contemplated seizing Tanjore. Since Tanjore and other properties had belonged to his father he tried to seize them after negotiating with his brother, Venkoji. Venkoji distrusted him and was not willing to give up his property. Shivaji did not give up and continued his battle. Vellore surrendered immediately and then Carntiegurh and two other forts reduced immediately after. Vedaji Bhaskar Pant who was in charge of Arni since the time of Shahaji, brought the keys of the Fort and tendered his services to Shivaji. Shivaji thereby confirmed the award of the Jagir of Arnee to him. After establishing Maratha Empire, the jagir of Arni and Venidurg were left to the son of Vedaji Bhaskar pant, out of respect for Vedaji Bhaskar Pant for his loyalty. Treaty of 1762 After the Battle of Arnee, a treaty was signed in 1762 between the Nawab of Arcot and Pratap Singh, Rajah of Tanjore. This was guaranteed by the Government of Fort St. George and confirmed by the East India Company. This once again restored and confirmed the Jagir to Thirumala I Rao Sahib under the 5th Article of the Treaty. Extent of the Estate The Arni jagir comprises 192 villages in the North Arcot district of Madras Presidency. Its extent was 211 square miles. The pant family ruled the region till 1948. The members of ruling family used 186 luxurious cars between 1920 and 1948, which were imported from various countries. Palaces and Architecture Arni House (now known as Jayamahal Palace/Jayamahal Palace hotel) In the town of Arni, which is the headquarters of the Arni jagir two palaces were built during 19 century. Diwan Khane Palace The first palace, is a two-storey building known as Diwan Khane, which was originally meant as a guest house for women and children of the royal family. It is spread over 35 acres, the palace had circular brick pillars, Indian motifs, arches, gothic columns and Madras terrace built with the lime and mortar method. Peacock pattern glass panels on the doors, door handles and engravings with flora and fauna ‚Äî characteristic of the Mughal style of architecture ‚Äî were also introduced. The palace had fish-typed door stoppers and floors that were made of lime but resembled tiled flooring. The last two features were unique to the architecture followed by Arni rulers of those times. At present, the palace is in ruins. Poosi Malai Kuppam Palace The second palace, known as Poosi Malai Kuppam, was built as a guest house for the rulers. It is a single-storey structure, which had separate loft for pigeons, four chimneys (despite the town experiencing generally hot climate). The palace is constructed in a typical British style. Most of the structure now remains intact but needs immediate conservation. In fact, Mr. Hariharan said, the forest palace was the earliest structure in the region to use steel rafters instead of traditional wooden rafters for its roof. Such steel rafters added strength to the structure. Arni House The Arni House was constructed by Jagirdars of Arni in 1903, which was later bought by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV and gifted to his nephew Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar and named it as The Jayamahal Palace. In 1949 Maharaja of Mysore Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar sold the palace to Maharaja of Gondal. The Jayamahal Palace was spread across 24 acres in Bangalore. Titles *The Sultanate of Bijapur conferred upon Vedaji Baskar Pant the title of Rao Sahib, which subsequently replaced the surname Pant of the ruling family. * In 1765, Srinivasa I Rao Sahib the 6th Jagirdar of Arni was granted the title \\"Raja\\". From their onwards the ruling family used the title \\"Raja\\".

His major works are A Companion to the Bible (1939, as editor and contributor), The Church's Ministry (1948), Ministry and Priesthood, Christ's and Ours (1958), and Studies in the Gospels and Epistles (1962, posthumous). Legacy He and his wife had no children. His papers are now in the John Rylands Library, Manchester. Part of them was passed to the library after Manson's death and another part after Mrs. Manson's death. Source *Shiel, Judith B. (1999) \\"The Papers of T. W.

It was broadcast by Network 10 and co-hosted by Mark Humphries and Andrew Rochford. It began airing from 23 July 2018 until 10 May 2019. Pointless was filmed at Network 10 Studios in Pyrmont, a suburb in Sydney's inner-city. Episodes {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !

It was confirmed that the Nine Network, Seven Network, ABC, SBS and Foxtel had not purchased the rights to the show, leaving Network 10 as the likely broadcaster. In late June it was announced that an Australian version of Pointless would air on Network 10, replacing Family Feud. In February 2019, various entertainment websites speculated that the show had been cancelled due to poor ratings, and that a replacement was yet to be announced. On 15 March 2019, Network 10 confirmed that Pointless was cancelled, to be replaced with a new game show, Celebrity Name Game, hosted by Grant Denyer, and based on the US game show of the same name.  Gameplay  The format of the show is similar in nature to the British version albeit with reduced and abbreviated rounds and fewer contestants. The object of the game is for contestants to provide answers that are not only correct but also as obscure as possible, with each game consisting of teams of two contestants. The Australian version commences with three teams compared to the four teams that participate in the British game. Before each show, 100 people are given 100 seconds to provide as many answers as they can to a series of general knowledge questions as part of a pre-conducted survey, and in each round, contestants are asked these same questions. These questions are set into categories, with the contestants given rules regarding what they are searching for in terms of answers, more importantly what answers will be accepted for the question given. If the answer is correct, the team scores one point for each participant that gave it during the survey; if none of the surveyed participants gave an answer listed for the question and a contestant gives it, the team scores zero points for providing a \\"pointless\\" answer. If the answer is incorrect, the team scores the maximum of 100 points. The format of the show consists of an elimination round in which teams must achieve as low a score as possible, with those who achieve the highest score being eliminated from the game. Following this round, the two surviving teams compete against each other in a \\"head to head\\" round to find the lowest scoring answer in a series of questions, with the winning team moving on to the final round. Prior to the final round, every pointless answer given adds $500 to the cash jackpot, and eliminated teams making their first appearance are eligible to appear again in the next consecutive game. Teams who have appeared twice or reached the final round cannot return. The team that reaches the final round is awarded a trophy to keep, and then must supply two answers from one of two nominated categories in 30 seconds (as opposed to three answers from one of three nominated categories in 60 seconds in the British game) to a question, in which one must be a pointless answer in order to win the jackpot as it stands for that game; otherwise, the money rolls over to the next show. The cash jackpot begins at $2000 at the start of its run. Should it not be won at the end of a game, the amount (including any increases from pointless answers) is rolled over to the next game and increased by $2000, offering returning and new contestants a chance of winning a bigger cash prize. To date, the highest recorded jackpot won on the show was $24,000 on 20 September 2018. Once the jackpot is won, the amount is reset to $2000.

History  Volchok was established in 2014 by Vasily Volchok-Rusakovich who previously worked at 2√ó2 TV Channel and dealt with Soviet vintage clothing via online store. Inspired by the success of a friendly local streetwear manufacturer Volchok-Rusakovich made 200 black tees with \\"–Æ–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å\\" (Youth) print that made the brand popular among locals. The huge media attention reached Volchok in October 2016 when L'Officiel Russia former editor-in-chief Evelina Khromtchenko and Vogue Russia fashion editor Olga Dunina both wore those \\"–Æ–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å\\" black tees at a cocktail party in Galeries Lafayette.  Design  Volchok designs t-shirts, sweatshirts, pants, socks, cloaks, coats and other apparel for men and women while most models fall under unisex. Clothing is (mostly) fabricated locally in Russia so it remains affordable to regular customers. According to Volchok- Rusakovich his company is also a social platform for young people as the simple design with laconic black and white color palette is intended to be a medium for messages, transmitted via prints and slogans. Volchok's most notable designs are based on Cyrillic slogans such as \\"–í–µ—Ä–∞\\" (Hope), \\"–Æ–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å\\" (Youth) or \\"–ú–æ—è –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞\\" (My Defence), \\"No Tsars No Gods\\". However some collections introduced a more complex graphic work. At the 11th Faces & Laces show in Moscow in August 2017 Volchok presented a collection named after the Final Fantasy game series that included drawings made in tradition of Japanese animation. Volchok FW 2018‚Äî19 collection presented at Futurum Moscow show in Museum of Moscow on the last day of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Russia in March 2018 included prints of birds and other wild creatures. Volchok's references are picked from the Russian underground culture even when the messages themselves are political: the SS-2018 collection presented at MBFWRussia in October 2017 was dedicated to complicated political relations between Russia and Ukraine. Volchok-Rusakovich describes the brand's nature as \\"Russian Gothic\\" while fashion magazines consider it an example of post-Soviet aesthetics.  Reception  Volchok was among the first Russian streetwear brands to take part in major fashion shows. Since 2016 it has participated in seasonal Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Russia events and Pitti Uomo exhibition in Florence, Italy in January 2018. Volchok received numerous special mentions in Vogue, L'Officiel, Fashionista and other fashion magazines as well as New East-focused The Calvert Journal as a notable representative of Russian fashion scene and part of the Russian fashion new wave. Following MBFWRussia in March 2018 i-D reporter Rae Witte called Volchok FW 2018‚Äî19 collection the most interesting streetwear collection of the shot and The Fall contributor Dee Moran acknowledged Volchok as a potential rival Gosha Rubchinskiy.  Stores  Volchok runs stores in Moscow (Khlebozavod #9), Saint Petersburg (Berthold Center) and in Kiev.

She was a famous debutante, model, and actress in 1930s London and was widely photographed. Lady Marguerite worked for the Mechanised Transport Corps in World War II and in later life held a variety of jobs as well as writing about her childhood in Brazil.  Life  Lady Marguerite's parents separated when she was three (divorcing in 1920) and her mother Daphne, along with Marguerite and her brother Peter, went to live with her parents, Alfred and Mabel Mulholland, at Worlingham Hall, Beccles. Daphne Mulholland then married Hugo Chandor, an old Etonian sheep farmer recently returned from Argentina. The new family moved to Tres Barras, in rural central Brazil, to build a sawmill. Following a revolution in Sao Paulo they were cut off completely for six months. After five years in Brazil, they returned to England and went back to Worlingham. Lady Marguerite attended Belstead School for two years from the ages of 13-15 but had little other formal education. She was a debutante and was presented at Court in 1931 and wore ‚Äòa gown of ivory and silver lace and net over flesh pink cr√™pe de Chine‚Äô with a silver train.  Work  Lady Marguerite modeled for advertisements for Pond's cream, Will's Gold Flake, Kirbigrips, and Horlicks. Although she was a non-smoker and rarely drank alcohol, Lady Marguerite was often featured in cigarette and alcohol advertisements of the 1930s. She was widely photographed as a model and copies of her portrait photographs are held by the National Portrait Gallery. She was photographed by Anthony Beauchamp and Baron Nahum. In 1939, Gerald Brockhurst painted Lady Marguerite. The realist painting, entitled By the Hills, achieved the top price at the Royal Academy summer exhibition that year. The painting is now held by the Ferens Art Gallery. Lady Marguerite was a lifelong vegetarian and supporter of animal rights causes and charities. She was a member of the Animal Defence League, and travelled to Algiers to help rescue sick and maltreated animals with her Sicilian friend Marie Ruperto. On the outbreak of World War II, fearing an invasion of the east coast, Lady Marguerite and her friend Rosemary Potter took a carthorse and polo pony on a nine day journey (carrying fodder) from Worlingham to a safer location in Gloucestershire. During the war she served in the Mechanised Transport Corps, teaching soldiers how to dismantle engines, but was dismissed after the photographer Baron Nahum took her photograph without a hair net. She later served as an ambulance driver in the London Blitz. With her third husband, Nigel Tangye, Lady Marguerite ran a hotel at Glendorgal, his seaside home near Newquay from 1951. She took on responsibility for cleaning, bar tending, and in the evenings sang accompanied by visiting jazz musicians. Following her divorce from Nigel Tangye in 1964, Lady Marguerite returned to London and worked various administrative jobs including at the Post Office and as a query clerk at Harrods.

The site lay in the parish of Ardoch, Perth and Kinross with the villages of Braco, Greenloaning and Blackford nearby. The Scottish Central Railway line had been opened in 1848.  History  Carsebreck Loch The existence of the railway at the site had been a major consideration in the selection of this site for the construction of a curling pond together with the geography of the site and its retentive clay bottom,The Curling History Blog peat having been extracted. The station had been opened by February 1853 and in addition to those named above 'Nethertown' and 'Carsebreck' are on record. Between 1853 and 1935 twenty-five bonspiels or 'Grand Matches' were held at Carsebreck Loch. Changes in the climate created uncertainty of suitable ice being present and the curling pond ceased to be used with 1935 given as the closure date by one author and 1951 by another authority however the last Grand Match to be played at Carsebreck was in 1935.Scottish Curling Infrastructure An 1853 map of the site shows the double track line with two 'platform' areas demarcated and a building on the southern side. The word 'siding' is annotated however no siding as such is shown. The 'Brick House' is not marked. A roughcast two storey building, 'Brick House', thought to have been a surfaceman and crossing keeper's dwellings dating from Scottish Central Railway days, unoccupied but still standing, lies to the south next to a level crossing and a single fairly substantial building, possibly the curling house was at that time located on the southbound 'platform' areaCarsebreck Station - RailScot Perth and Clackmannanshire, 117.11, Surveyed: 1899, Published: 1901 together with small shelters on each platform.Perth and Clackmannanshire CXVII.11 (Ardoch) Survey date: 1863 Publication date: 1864 The Royal Caledonian Curling Club as stated had a club house and possibly a curling house and the existence of a siding is recorded in 1853. A path ran from the station across a drainage ditch and the Allan Water to the curling loch and to Carsebreck Farm. No access to the station from the nearby road or from Netherton Farm originally existed. The 'platform' area was originally quite short and it is said that for many years, up until 1906, curlers disembarked directly onto the ballast. No name board appears to have been present. A major upgrade took place and in 1935 a track layout diagram and film seems to shows only a single very long platform on the northern side of a wooden construction with three sets of steps. A signal box, opened on 23 May 1905,Caledonian Railway Association Forum stood on the southern side and several signals were present. Two tracks lay either side of the double track line with several sets of points creating two passing loops and four head shunts. Level crossings were located either side of the platform.Caledonian Railway Association Forum The layout was designed for the frequent arrival, temporary storage and rapid departure of trains. The sidings were lifted during WWII as part of the war effort and the curling pond received no maintenance.Smith, Page 128 Services Apart from advertised events such as bonspiels the stations use would not have been listed and it did not appear on the public timetables, the station being private and the sport had a very seasonal and unpredictable requirement for train services. The Royal Caledonian Curling Club negotiated a special ticket at half the normal price for the thousands of curlers who used the station. In 1935 it is recorded that 2576 curlers and 5000 people in total attended the bonspiel that had started at 11.25 and finished at 2.30pm and the queuing of passengers had to be carefully organised with only four carriages able to use the station platform at one time. In 1853 trains with more than twenty carriages were provided, the locomotives being unequal to the task and the bulk of curlers arrived around an hour late.Murray, Page 102 No matches were held from 1856 to 1859 with reduced attendance in 1860 however 1861 was a year of perfect conditions.Murray, Page 103  The site today  The line remains open and the loch is still present, however nothing substantial remains of the platforms or the building other than the raised area at the southern platform.

It was published in 1923 in his New Hampshire poetry collection. The poem contains six quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme. Analysis The first quatrain, \\"Observing a Burned-Out Home\\", talks about a house burning down. The narrator also imagines a flower, representative of the chimney that wasn't destroyed in the fire. The second quatrain, \\"An Abandoned Farm\\", talks about how if the wind had been blowing in a different direction, the barn of the narrator would have burned down as well. The narrator personifies the wind by saying that it has a very strong will, and wouldn't let the barn burn down. This shows that the narrator believes in a strong connection between the physical world and the world of nature. The third quatrain, \\"No Longer an Active Farm\\", shows the melancholy the narrator is feeling after the barn burned down, and how even though it is still up, it isn't functioning like it used to. The fourth quatrain, \\"Refocusing on the House\\", tells of birds flying out from the burned home and that the flapping of these birds is akin to the human sigh, again showing the connection that the narrator thinks humans and nature have. The fifth quatrain, \\"Happened Long Ago\\", reveals to the reader that the fire was something that happened long ago, and although some flowers have started blooming again, the abandoned farm is still a lonely place. The sixth quatrain, \\"Melancholy Despite the Birds\\", starts with the narrator talking about how despite all the destruction around him, the birds are still happy to have a place to nest, but \\"One would have to be versed in country things\\" to think that these birds haven't wept, hinting at the fact that he doesn't know everything about country things.

Together with Chen Feng, he was co-founder and co-chairman of Hainan Airlines and the affiliated conglomerate HNA Group, with assets worth US$230 billion in 2018. HNA was the world's 170th largest company by revenue in 2017 according to Fortune Global 500. Wang and Chen were HNA's largest individual shareholders, with each owning about 15% of the company. He died from an \\"likely accidental\\" fall while travelling in France in July 2018.  Biography  Wang was born in Tianjin in 1961. He graduated from Civil Aviation University of China in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in aviation business management, and worked for the Civil Aviation Administration of China afterwards. He later received training at Japan Airlines on a scholarship from the Association for Overseas Technical Scholarship (AOTS), and earned an MBA from the Maastricht School of Management in the Netherlands in 1995. In 1990, Wang participated in the establishment of Hainan Airlines, based in Hainan province, and became the new company's chief executive. Together with partner Chen Feng, Wang also founded the conglomerate HNA Group, which grew to become the world's 170th largest company according to Fortune Global 500, with total revenue of US$53 billion in 2017. Chen acted as the public face of the company, while Wang was a hands-on manager with a lower public profile. Both men were instrumental in HNA's phenomenal transformation from a small airline to a global conglomerate with assets worth US$230 billion, including major stakes in Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Deutsche Bank, NH Hotel Group, and ownership of Ingram Micro. However, HNA's acquisition spree was substantially funded by debt, which had reached US$90 billion in 2018, and it was working to sell billions of dollars of assets to reduce its debt load at the time of Wang's accidental death. Wang and Chen were the largest individual shareholders of HNA, with each owning about 15% of the company as of 2017, making them two of the richest people in China. In addition to his responsibilities at HNA, Wang also taught as a part-time professor at his alma mater, Civil Aviation University of China.  Family  Wang Jian had a younger brother, Wang Wei, who has played a key behind-the-scenes role at HNA Group.  Death  In July 2018, Wang made a business trip in France. On 3 July, he took a sightseeing detour with his colleagues in Bonnieux, a hilltop village in the region of Provence. He climbed onto a low wall above a cliff to have his picture taken, but lost his balance and fell backward, landing on rocks about below. He was pronounced dead a few hours later. According to French media reports, eye-witnesses of the incident said that Wang died by jumping off the wall. But French police denied these claims. Wang's death was a blow to HNA, which was in the midst of selling its foreign assets to reduce its debt load, and the prices of the company's dollar bonds fell after his death was confirmed. Hainan Airlines along with other airlines from HNA Group changed its website to a gray color scheme to honour his death. Chinese billionaire Miles Guo thinks that Wang Jian has been murdered by China Communist Party leadership.

In 2018 he was arrested on politically-motivated charges, sparking an international campaign by human rights groups calling for his release. On October 8, 2018, Titiev was awarded the V√°clav Havel Human Rights Prize, which honours \\"outstanding\\" defence of human rights in Europe and beyond.  Biography  Oyub Titiev's ancestors were among the first settlers of the village Kurchaloi, Chechnya. However, as a result of the deportation of Chechens in March 1944 he was born in the village of Lebedinovka in the Kyrgyz SSR. He later returned to Kurchaloi, Chechnya. Active in wrestling and weightlifting, Titiev became a physical education teacher and created a local children's sports club, which has produced a number of professional athletes. Since 2000, he has worked for Memorial and for the Civic Assistance Committee,https://refugee.ru/en/ documenting human rights abuses in Chechnya and overseeing humanitarian projects such as assisting schools in Chechnya's mountain regions or defending Muslims from discrimination in the criminal justice system. After the assassination of Natalya Estemirova in 2009, he became the head of Memorial in Chechnya.  Arrest, detention and criminal case  On January 9, 2018, Titiev left Kurchaloi, traveling towards Mairtup, Chechnya, where he was supposed to meet a friend at 9:00 am. According to the official version, his Lada Kalina was stopped to verify his documents. Upon inspecting the car, the police officers found ‚Äúa polymer bag with a substance of plant origin with the specific smell of marijuana, weighing approximately 180 grams.‚Äù Titiev was then detained and taken to the Kurchaloevsky police station for medical examination, while the packet with the substance was sent for expert analysis. That same day, Memorial reported his detention. On January 11, 2018, the Shalinsk city court arrested Titiev until March 9 on request of the investigator. The human rights activist was accused of breaking Part 2 Article 228 of the Criminal Code (the illegal acquisition, storage, and transportation of drugs). Titiev denied guilt and in a statement sent to the Investigatory Committee of the Chechen Republic accused the police officers of planting the illegal drugs under his passenger's seat while inspecting his car. On January 12, his defense appealed the two-month arrest. Memorial representative Aleksandr Cherkasov said that Titiev's arrest was related to his professional work which was ‚Äúmet with disapproval from Chechen authorities.‚Äù The representative of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, said that the council had already appealed to the Ministry of Internal Affairs on January 10 to verify Titiev's detention and investigate the situation. On January 24, Aleksandr Cherkasov appealed to the Russian and international community on behalf of Memorial, urging them to closely monitor Titiev's case as they had with criminal proceedings against historian and head of the Karelian branch of Memorial, Yury A. Dmitriev. On January 28, Ksenia Sobchak, then a candidate in the March 2018 Russian Presidential Elections, held a one-night-long picket in Grozny in ‚Äúmemory of journalists who died for a free country‚Äù with a poster reading \\"Freedom for Oyub Titiev\\". On February 1, the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Russia,http://eng.ombudsmanrf.org/ Tatyana Moskalkova called for the investigation of the Titiev case to be passed on to the federal level. A similar opinion was expressed by the representative of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov. On March 6, the Staropromyslov district court extended Titiev's arrest until May 9, while rejecting the poruchitelstvo (personal vouches, Russian: –ø–æ—Ä—É—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ) he received from presidential candidates Grigory Yavlinsky and Ksenia Sobchak. On May 4, while considering an appeal to the ruling of the Staropromyslov district court, human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina and test pilot and Hero of Russia Sergey Nefedov also offered a poruchitelstvo for Titiev, which the court also rejected. A number of leading international human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Front Line Defenders, FIDH, the World Organization Against Torture) released a joint statement on January 11, defending Titiev and Memorial's activities in the Caucasus. On February 8, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Titiev's case calling for the \\"immediate release of the Director of the Memorial Human Rights Centre in the Chechen Republic, Mr. Oyub Titiev\\". Memorial has included Titiev in their list of political prisoners. In March 2019 Titiev was sentenced to 4 years of corrective labor, in a colony of an open type, which allows for conditional release after one third of the time has been served, including time spent in arrest. This was interpreted by human rights activists as \\"actual release\\" by the court without admitting that the charges were fabricated, at the same time giving a clear signal to the human rights community in Russia that their work is strictly controlled and will face repressions if going against the government's interests. He was ordered to be released in June 2019, after having served more than a third of his sentence in jail.https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-chechnya- rights/russian-court-rules-to-free-chechen-human-rights-advocate-oyub-titiev- idINKCN1TB1YF  References  Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Russian human rights activists Category:Chechen human rights activists Category:Chechen people Category:Russian Muslims Category:Memorial (society) ","title":"Oyub Titiev"},{"id":"57829059","text":"Ames Main Street Historic District is a nationally recognized historic district located in Ames, Iowa, United States.

The district covers most of the city's central business district. The area began to develop after the Civil War along the Chicago and North Western (CNW) tracks. The district was also served by the Ames & College Railway and its successor, the Fort Dodge, Des Moines, & Southern Interurban Streetcar line, from 1891 to 1929. The later connected downtown Ames and the CNW depot with Iowa State College, now known as Iowa State University. Most of the buildings in the district are two stories in height and constructed in brick. There are also several single-story structures and a few that rise to three stories. The facades and storefronts run continuously along the blocks with only two breaks for vacant lots that have been transformed into public park plazas. Downtown Ames is somewhat unique in Iowa in that the facades of the commercial buildings were radically rehabilitated from the late 1910s and into the 1960s, giving them a more modern appearance. While other communities in the state also saw updates to the buildings in their main commercial areas, the difference here is that it was \\"nearly universal and helped the central business district retain a unified feeling of design.\\" The Municipal Building (1916) and the Masonic Temple (1917) are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It was probably introduced into the southern German states around 1720 but spread rapidly into Austria and northwards as far as the Netherlands and Scandinavia. It only survives today in Denmark where it is called Tarok, but is also referred to in English as Danish Tarok or Danish Tarock. Classical Grosstarock is not related to the modern 54-card game known as Viennese Grosstarock which developed out of Zwanzigerrufen.  History  This form of Taroc was introduced into Germany from France around 1720, its initial terminology and mode of play being typically French. The original game - classical or German Taroc - was a simple, three-hander with no bidding but several card combinations, as can be seen from descriptions in the 1750s. However, it differed from its French predecessor in having significantly fewer declarations; in addition, the Fool had to be played before the last three tricks, not just before the final trick, and there was a new emphasis on the Pagat Ultimo bonus. The next development of the game is first described in the 1783 edition of Das neue K√∂nigliche l'Hombre which, for the first time, records a feature whereby a player taking no tricks is able to score all the points. Dummett sees this as the distinguishing mark of the game he calls Grosstarock and believes that this name was not introduced until the mid-19th century. More recent research has revealed that, in fact, the name Grosstarock was being used far earlier than that. For example, it is recorded in 1785 that \\"Gro√ütarock\\" was one of several card games played in G√∂ttingen, and, in 1803, a Professor Wildt wrote that \\"the so-called Gross-Taroc, in which 6 to 7 ultimo‚Äôs are possible, and several are tried at the same time, really requires more mental effort than the usual chess game.\\" Meanwhile German authors use the term more widely; for example, Mayr and Sedlaczek refer to the 1754 rules as the \\"oldest surviving form\\" of Gro√ütarock, while Alscher describes the Danish version as \\"Danish Gro√ütarock\\". According to Dummett, the name 'Grosstarock' (\\"Great Tarock\\") was coined at a time when the 78-card game was being threatened by competition from newer games played with a shortened, 54-card pack. However, there is no evidence of 54-card games being played in northern Germany and Denmark where Grosstarock was popular in the late 18th and early 19th century, so it may be that the name arose in southern Germany or Austria and migrated north with the game. In Germany and Austria, Grosstarock continued to be played throughout the 19th century. Dummett believed that it did not survive the First World War, but H√ºlsemann states in 1930 that Grosstarock was still popular in southern Germany and Austria. Neither country produces 78-card Tarock packs any longer. The game was known in Denmark as early as 1770 where it was played at the royal court. The first rules were published in 1786, and by 1840 they already included features that are peculiar to the Danish variant, such as separate pots for the King and Pagat ultimo. The Danes also retained the anticlockwise mode of play and adopted a very wide range of declarations, although some authors counselled against having too many. The game is still played in Denmark today in a form that Martin argues is close to the original German Grosstarock. The Danes used to manufacture their own Tarok cards, but nowadays use imported French Bourgeois Tarot packs. In 2010, the Danish Tarock Association (Dansk Tarokforbund) was formed and, today, there are local clubs in Aarhus, Aalborg, Aller√∏d, Blovstr√∏d, Brabrand, Fredericia, Hj√∏rring, Holb√¶k, Kalundborg (the Royal Tarock Club and the Kalundborg Tarock Club), N√∏rrebro, Randers and Westre.Dansk Tarokforbund at www.dansk-tarok.dk. Retrieved 16 Nov 2019.  Equipment  Grosstarock is played with a French suited pack of 78 cards. Originally these were of the German animal tarot type; today, Danish players use the French Bourgeois Tarot pack. The pack comprises: * Two black suits (Clubs and Spades) ranking as follows: K (high) Q C V 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 A (low) * Two red suits (Hearts and Diamonds) ranking thus: K (high) Q C V A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (low) * Twenty one Tarocs or Taroks as permanent trumps * One unnumbered card, the Sckis, Sc√ºs or Excuse (German Taroc), Sk√ºs (Grosstarock), Scies or Scus (Danish Tarok), which 'excuses' the player from following suit. In addition, present-day Danish players also use two pots and coloured jetons for scoring.  Aim  The aim in every case is to score points by capturing counting cards in tricks and to earn bonuses through declarations and certain accomplishments during the play.  Early German Taroc  The earliest rules in German for a Tarock game were published in 1754 in Regeln bey dem Taroc- Spiele. They were reprinted in the 1755 edition of the games compendium, Palamedes Redivivus, and elaborated in Die Kunst, die Welt (1756). The following is summary of these rules:  Preliminaries  The game is played between three players. Four may play with one player in turn, known as the 'King', sitting out for the deal. Play is anticlockwise. The dealer distributes 5 rounds of 5 cards each, keeping the last 8 cards himself. He then discards 3 cards which count to him at the end. They must not include any Kings or Tarocs unless he only has exactly 3 Tarocs including the Pagat, in which case they may be discarded. In addition, a combination of the Pagat, Sckis or Excuse (the Fool) and another Taroc is a legal discard. There are penalties for misdealing.  Declarations  Opening with the dealer, players now make any of the following declarations which earn payments from each opponent in 'game points' as shown: {  align=\\"float:left\\" style=\\"background-color:white\\" - Acbfa3\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"  Declarations in German Taroc - style=\\"background: #DDDDDD;\\"  Declaration  Meaning  Game points -  efefef;\\"  10 Tarocs, 11 Tarocs, etc.  Holding 10 or more Tarocs.  align=\\"center\\" 10 + 5 -  efefef;\\"  3 Matadors, 4 Matadors, etc.  Holding the top 3 matadors plus any additional ones in sequence from the top.  align=\\"center\\" 10 + 5 -  efefef;\\"  Whole Cavalry (gantze Cavallerie)  Holding the King, Queen, Cavalier and Valet of one suit.  align=\\"center\\" 10 -  efefef;\\"  Half Cavalry (halbe Cavallerie)  The same as a Full Cavalry except that the Excuse replaces one of the court cards.  align=\\"center\\" 5 -  efefef;\\"  Four Kings  Holding all four Kings.  align=\\"center\\" 10 -  efefef;\\"  Three Kings  Holding three Kings and the Excuse.  align=\\"center\\" 5 } Declarations must be made before play starts, otherwise they do not count.  Play  Players must follow suit, or trump if unable; otherwise they may discard any card. If a player loses the Pagat during the game, he pays a penalty of 5 points to each adversary. If it is lost in the last trick, he pays 10 points. However, if he wins the last trick with the Pagat, he is paid a bonus of 10 points from each opponent. The Excuse cannot be beaten nor can it win a trick. But its owner may play it at any time instead of another card. He retrieves the Excuse from the trick, lays it away in his own trick pile and gives the trick winner a low card of his choice, from his tricks, in exchange. The Excuse must be played by the 3rd last trick. If it is held until that point and its owner is on lead, he must surrender the lead to the player on his right and play the Excuse in his turn. In addition, the Excuse may not be held when its owner has run out of Tarocs, but must be played to the next trick in which he is void in the led suit. If a player takes no tricks but has the Excuse at the end, he is paid 4 points from each adversary.  Scoring  The game is scored in 'game points'. These must not be confused with 'card points' which represent the value of individual cards and are used to determine who won the deal and by how much. Scoring works as follows: * Card points: First players add up the card points won in tricks. Kings are worth 5, Queens 4, Cavaliers 3 and Valets 2 card points each. The Pagat, Excuse and XXI are also worth 5 each. The remainder are non-scoring blanks. Scoring is carried out in threes, players sorting their tricks so that there is one scoring card and two non-counters in each triplet. The rules state that \\"in this way there are exactly 78 points in the pack\\", which means that there are always 7 triplets consisting solely of non-counters that are worth 1 point each. Players then work out their overshoot or undershoot points i.e. the number of points above or below 26. * Game points: Players score game points for a) the game, b) declarations and c) the Pagat bonus. For the game, they are paid as many game points as they have scored overshoot points or pay out as many as they have undershoot points. For example if A makes 40 in card points, B makes 20, and C makes 18; B pays 26-20 = 6 game points to A and C pays 26-18 = 8 game points to A. A thus receives 14 game points which equal his overshoot points i.e. 40-26 = 14. These are then added to the game points for declarations and winning or losing the Pagat mentioned above.  Grosstarock  Dummett describes Grosstarock rules in Ten Tarot Games, based on a number of sources. Once again it is a three-hand game, but this time dealing and play are clockwise. Dealer distributes all the cards in packets of five, leaving himself with the last eight cards. He then discards three cards which must not include a King or Tarok 21. He must not discard any other Taroks unless he has the Pagat (Tarok 1) and no more than 2 others.  Declarations  Beginning with the dealer, players may make any of the following announcements which score points as shown: {  align=\\"float:left\\" style=\\"background-color:white\\" - A9A9A9\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"  Declarations in Grosstarock - style=\\"background: #DDDDDD;\\"  Declaration  Meaning  Game points -  efefef;\\"  Ten or more Taroks  Holding 10 or more Taroks (must state if the Sk√ºs or Pagat are held).  align=\\"center\\" 10 + 5 -  efefef;\\"  Three or more Matadors  Holding the top 3 matadors plus any additional ones in sequence from the top.  align=\\"center\\" 10 + 5 -  efefef;\\"  Three or more Kings  Holding three or more of the following: Pagat, Sk√ºs and Tarok 21, any King.  align=\\"center\\" 5 + 5 -  efefef;\\"  Cavalry (Cavallerie)  Holding the King, Queen, Cavalier and Valet of one suit.  align=\\"center\\" 10 -  efefef;\\"  Half Cavalry (halbe Cavallerie)  Holding three courts of one suit plus the Sk√ºs.  align=\\"center\\" 5 -  efefef;\\"  Four Queens, Four Cavaliers, Four Jacks  Holding four courts of the same rank.  align=\\"center\\" 5 -  efefef;\\"  Sixteen or more Ladons  Holding 16 or more Ladons (low cards).  align=\\"center\\" 15 + 5 }  Play  The player to the left of the dealer leads to the first trick; thereafter the winner of the trick leads to the next one. Players must follow suit, or trump if unable, but there is no compulsion to win a trick. Tricks are won by the highest Tarok or, if no Tarok is played, the highest card of the suit led. The Sk√ºs may not take a trick, but is may be played at any time to any trick. Normally it is retrieved by its owner and a low card given to the trick winner in exchange from the trick pile; however, if played to the last three tricks it is captured by the trick winner.  Scoring  * Card points: At the end of the deal, player count up the card points they have won in tricks. The process is slightly different from that in early German Taroc. For a start, the card values for scoring purposes are: Honours (Tarok 21, Pagat/Tarok 1, Sk√ºs) ‚Äì 5 points, Kings ‚Äì 5 points, Queens ‚Äì 4 points, Cavaliers ‚Äì 3 points, Jacks ‚Äì 2 points and all others (the Ladons) ‚Äì 1 point. Cards are grouped in threes again, but this time their points are totted up and two deducted per triplet. So a Queen, Jack and 7 count as 4+2+1‚àí2 = 5. Once again, the whole pack contains 78 points. * Game points. Scoring for the game is as in German Taroc above. A player who scores exactly 26 card points pays and receives nothing. Those scoring above 26 receive as many game points as they have in excess of 26; those scoring below 26 have to pay as many games points as they fall short. In addition there are the game points for declarations (see table above) and the following game points for bonuses and penalties: {  align=\\"float:left\\" style=\\"background-color:white\\" - A9A9A9\\"  colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"  Bonuses in Grosstarock - style=\\"background: #DDDDDD;\\"  align=\\"center\\" Name  align=\\"center\\" Meaning  align=\\"center\\" Bonus for winning  align=\\"center\\" Penalty for losing -  efefef;\\"  Pagat  Bringing the Pagat home (as opposed to losing it).  align=\\"center\\" 5  align=\\"center\\" -5 -  efefef;\\"  Pagat ultimo  Taking the last trick with the Pagat.  align=\\"center\\" 15  align=\\"center\\" -15 -  efefef;\\"  King  Taking a trick with a King.  align=\\"center\\" 5  align=\\"center\\" -5 -  efefef;\\"  King ultimo  Taking the last trick with a King.  align=\\"center\\" 10  align=\\"center\\" -10 -  efefef;\\"  Vole  Taking all tricks.  align=\\"center\\" 26  align=\\"center\\" -26 -  efefef;\\"  Nolo  Taking no tricks.  align=\\"center\\" 26  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì } There are also options for players to announce a Vole beforehand; if successful, this scores 52 if announced before the 1st trick, 38 if before the 13th and 31 if before the 20th trick. Failure incurs the same penalty in reverse. A Nolo may also be announced; if successful, scoring 36 if announced before the 1st trick and 31 if before the 13th. If it fails, the normal payments for bonuses, penalties and card points are made; in addition, a 10-point penalty is incurred if it was announced before the 1st trick and 5 points if before the 13th trick. All bonuses are paid by both opponents to the player who earns them and all penalties are paid to both opponents by the player who incurs them.  Danish Tarok  The Pagat, Scies and 21 from a pack of the type used in Danish Tarok today The following rules are based on those published in 2011 by the Danish Tarok Association who point out that rule variations are permitted and that each local club may have its own version of the rules.DTF Rules - April 2011 at www.dansk-tarok.dk. Retrieved 17 Jun 2020.  Preliminaries  Coloured wooden jetons of the type used for card games In addition to the card pack, Danish Tarok also makes use of two pots ‚Äì a King pot and a Pagat pot ‚Äì and jetons for scoring, ideally with denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 100 points. At the start of the game, each player antes 20 points into each pot and lots are drawn to decide the first dealer. If either pot is empty, everyone antes 20 points to it, otherwise the dealer tops it up with a 5 point stake. The dealer then deals all the cards out, to the right in packets of five. He then takes the 3 remaining cards into his hand and must lays away 3 cards to the skat. The skat must not contain any matadors (Pagat, Scies, Tarok 21) or Kings, and must not include any cards used in declarations unless this cannot be avoided, in which case the dealer must show them. Taroks may only be discarded if it leaves the dealer void in that suit, may never be discarded. If a Tarok is discarded, the dealer must disclose the fact.  Declarations  Following the discard, all players must declare any scoring combinations in their hands, the dealer going first. Players are paid the score shown by each opponent. Failing to make a declaration when you could, incurs a penalty. The following declarations are possible: {  align=\\"float:left\\" style=\\"background-color:white\\" - ffcccc\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"  Declarations in Danish Tarok - style=\\"background: #DDDDDD;\\"  Declaration  Meaning  Game points -  efefef;\\"  Ten or more Taroks  Holding 10 or more Taroks (must state if \\"with\\" or \\"without Pagat\\").  align=\\"center\\" 10 + 5 -  efefef;\\"  Three or more Matadors  Holding the top 3 matadors plus any additional ones in sequence from the top.  align=\\"center\\" 10 + 5 -  efefef;\\"  Four Kings  Holding all the Kings.  align=\\"center\\" 10 -  efefef;\\"  Half in Kings  Holding three Kings and the Scies.  align=\\"center\\" 5 -  efefef;\\"  Full Cavalry, Full in [Suit]  Holding the King, Queen, Cavalier and Valet of one suit.  align=\\"center\\" 10 -  efefef;\\"  Half Cavalry, Half in [Suit]  Holding three courts of one suit plus the Scies.  align=\\"center\\" 5 -  efefef;\\"  Overfull Cavalry, Overfull in [Suit]  Holding all four courts of the same suit plus the Scies.  align=\\"center\\" 15 -  efefef;\\"  Overfull in Kings  Holding all four Kings plus the Scies.  align=\\"center\\" 15 }  Play  Play is to the right and forehand (right of dealer) leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit or trump if unable (here the Scies may be counted as a Tarok but does not win the trick). A player need not head the trick but may underforce. The trick winner leads to the next trick. The Scies may be used as a wild card in declarations or during play. It may be used in more than one declaration. It does not count as a Tarok when discarding to the skat or if a player has no other Taroks and is thus entitled to a redeal. During the game the Scies may be played at any time, its owner stating the suit it represents. If neither opponent can follow suit, the next player in turn may re-designate the suit for that trick. When the Scies is played it never wins the trick, but is recovered and the trick winner is given a low card from Scies player's trick pile in exchange. A player may demand that the Scies is played to the antepenultimate trick, but there is a penalty for getting this wrong. It may not be played to the penultimate trick and, if played to the last, it is captured by the trick winner. A Nolo is the achievement of failing to take any tricks and earns a special bonus. It invalidates any ultimos by another player; but losing an ultimo still incurs a penalty. There is no payment for winning the last trick and the Noloist is penalised for losing a King or the Pagat.  Scoring  * Card points. Players add up their points from cards won in tricks as in Grosstarock. Players earn 5 game points for every 5 card points scored above 24 and pay 5 game points for every 5 card points below 28. * Game points: As before, players score game points for points won in tricks, for declarations and for bonuses or penalties. However, game points for points won in tricks are scored differently, in that players receive 5 game points for every 5 card points scored above 24 and pay 5 game points for every 5 card points below 28. Game points for declarations are given above; those for bonuses and penalties are as follows: {  align=\\"float:left\\" style=\\"background-color:white\\" - ffcccc\\"  colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"  Bonuses in Danish Tarok - style=\\"background: #DDDDDD;\\"  align=\\"center\\" Name  align=\\"center\\" Meaning  align=\\"center\\" Bonus for winning  align=\\"center\\" Penalty for losing -  efefef;\\"  Pagat  Bringing the Pagat home (as opposed to losing it).  align=\\"center\\" 5  align=\\"center\\" -5 and -5 to Pagat pot -  efefef;\\"  Pagat ultimo  Taking the last trick with the Pagat.  align=\\"center\\" 45 plus contents of Pagat pot  align=\\"center\\" -45 and double the Pagat pot -  efefef;\\"  King  Losing a King.  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì  align=\\"center\\" -5 and -5 to King pot -  efefef;\\"  King ultimo  Taking the last trick with a King.  align=\\"center\\" 40 plus contents of King pot  align=\\"center\\" -40 and double the King pot -  efefef;\\"  Last trick  Taking the last trick.  align=\\"center\\" 20  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  efefef;\\"  Nolo  Taking no tricks.  align=\\"center\\" 25  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì -  efefef;\\"  Tout  Taking every trick. align=\\"center\\" 80 plus contents of both pots  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äì } All bonus points are paid by both opponents to the player who earns them, and all penalty points are paid to both opponents by the player who incurs them.

Before the dyke or training wall was built the rocky Bodinbo Island was a prominent feature in the river hereabouts and a hazard to shipping, especially sailing craft in the dark, during foggy weather, flood conditions and in high winds. On Ordnance Survey maps the name has been transliterated to Bottombow Island and Boden Boo is the spelling variant used for the nearby woodland plantation. Islands in the River Clyde The training dike from Bodinbo Island. Islands of the River Clyde, rather than sand or mud banks only exposed at low water, once included in order, working upstream towards Glasgow :- Inchgreen in Greenock, Bodinbo, Newshot, Ron, Sand Inch, King's Inch, Buck Inch, White Inch and Water Inch. Green Inch or Milton Island is located at the old Dumbuck Ford near Dumbarton. Colin's Isle once sat in the waters of the Cart near its confluence with the River Clyde. The name 'Inch' is Scots deriving from the Gaelic 'Innis', an island. The name 'Ron' in Scots refers to a thicket of hawthorns or rose briers, an area of stunted and crowded woodland. Shot or variants was an ancient unit for a division of land or alternatively a projecting area of land, a peninsula. A 'Shot' also has the meaning of a place from which fishing-nets were cast and in salmon fishing, a part of the river from which nets were cast. The island has a possible fishing weir remnant built across the inner lagoon. Bodinbo Island The old Erskine Ferry slipway and the bridge from the island. The name 'Bodinbo' is recorded on Timothy Pont's early 17th century map and also on Joan Blaeu's 1662 maps 'Pr√¶fectura Renfroana' and 'Levinia Vicecomitatus' that are derived from Pont's work. The island may have been included and named on these maps due to its significance as a hazard to shipping. John Ainslie's map of 1800 shows the bow-shaped or elipsical island within the flow of the river prior to the construction of the training dike that was built circa 1857 to reduce the width of the river with a view to increasing the water current's scouring of the river bed, making it deeper and less prone to silting up. The Erskine Ferry was operational by this date however at this time it ran from Donald's Quay that lay slightly further downstream. The old bank of the River Clyde in this area runs close to the Clyde Coastal Path and is lined with trees. James Watt's 1736 survey of the River Clyde. The name may be Scots as both 'Bod' and 'Bo' in place-names mean a sunken rock or as a term for small low-lying rocks on the shoreline. The island was originally bow shaped prior to the silting up of the area behind the training dike. The OS Name Book gives the \\"Property Plan Robinson's Chart of R. [River] Clyde. Hugh Paton. Ferry House\\" as the authority for the name 'Bottombow'. The surface area of the island is given as 0.768 of an acre or 0.31 of a hectare and the maximum height above high water mark is circa 3m or 9 ft. An 'Erskine Harbour' is marked on some maps and this has led to a degree of confusion in that the training dike, island and old river course has on occasion been mistakenly identified as a harbour and jetty. Wildlife The area is important for its extensive reed beds and diversity of flora. The island's summit lies well above the high water mark and carries typical land based plants such as hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) shrubs. Brackish water plants dominate the open water saltings and the surrounding silt deposits. Newshot Nature Reserve lies near by on the banks of the River Clyde facing the old Island of that name.

Kani was born in Cable Street in London's East End where her parents lived after leaving India at partition. She attended Harry Gosling Primary School until 1962 when the family moved to Kilburn, London. Her schooling continued at Paddington Green Primary, Burlington Grammar School near Wormwood Scrubs, and Kingsway College of Further Education. Kani played the violin in the National Youth Orchestra and went on to study music at St Hilda's College, Oxford (19758).  Career  On leaving Oxford, Kani spent 10 years programming and later designing financial computer systems in the City. She continued to play the violin and piano and she began to study conducting. Around 1986 she started a small computer consultancy which gave her the flexibility to spend more time conducting. In 1989 Kani founded the small-scale touring company Pimlico Opera, staging productions in unusual places: banks, hospitals, country houses and prisons. In 1992 Kani was made Chief Executive of Garsington Opera. During her five years‚Äô tenure, she gained a reputation as a fundraiser, entrepreneur and administrator. After five years she left to create her own country house opera festival, Grange Park Opera, founded in 1998. In 2003 Kani set up Nevill Holt Opera Festival in Leicestershire at the home of David Ross, co-founder of Carphone Warehouse. It was run as part of Grange Park Opera who built a temporary theatre in the stable courtyard and created a Friends' scheme. After 10 years Nevill Holt Opera became a separate company.  Pimlico Opera  Pimlico Opera was founded in 1987 by Wasfi Kani and the first opera company to specialise in performing in unusual places ‚Äì hospitals, country houses, banks, prisons. In 1991 the company was awarded Arts Council funding. Today it receives no public subsidy. The company aims to use music and drama (a) to advance personal development - particularly with younger people (b) to engender a sense of community. Artistic excellence is an essential part of achieving these aims. The work in prison began 1989 when the company performed full-scale operas with orchestra in Wormwood Scrubs prison: The Marriage of Figaro (Mozart), The Bear (Walton). In 1991 came the first collaboration with prisoners: Sweeney Todd (Sondheim) with D-wing lifers from the Scrubs. Besides the educational and rehabilitative element of the project, the public audience are taken inside a prison to consider the purpose of imprisonment in a positive context. Since 1991 around 60,000 public have been taken into prison. In November 1992, the collaboration with Wandsworth Prison, Guys & Dolls, was the subject of a BBC2 documentary \\"Guys, Dolls & D wing\\" which was nominated for a BAFTA. Pimlico Opera has worked for nearly 30 years in many jails including Dublin's Mountjoy, Erlestoke, Winchester, Send, High Down, Downview, Bullingdon and most recently in HMP Bronzefield. In 1994 Pimlico Opera staged the UK (and European) premiere of Shostakovich' musical Cheryomushki in the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Pimlico commissioned David Pountney to write an English text, and composer Gerard McBurney to create a reduced orchestration. The BBC made a documentary on the project (Another Bite of the Cherry) which included footage from the 1963 Lenfilm film version. In 1995 it was recorded for BBC Music Magazine (Volume 3, Number 80) on tape and CD. In the 1990s through to 2009 Pimlico Opera undertook a national small-scale tour funded by the Arts Council. The Primary Robins project was initiated in 2013. The project brings music and singing into the lives of primary schoolchildren who have little exposure to it. There are currently 2,080 Robins in Hampshire, Durham, Nottingham, Newcastle and Surrey. Pimlico Opera is the sister company of Grange Park Opera, founded 1998.  Grange Park Opera  Grange Park Opera, a not-for-profit organisation, was founded in 1998. In 2017, the company moved from Hampshire to a purpose-built 'Theatre in the Woods' at West Horsley Place ‚Äì the 350-acre estate inherited by author and broadcaster Bamber Gascoigne in 2014.

It is 24 km down-line from Moskovsky railway station and is situated between Sankt-Peterburg-Moskovsky- Sortirovochny (Obukhovo team tracks) and Sablino on the Saint Petersburg ‚Äî Moscow line. The station hosts suburban trains from Saint-Petersburg, Malaya Vishera, Shapki and Veliky Novgorod. Electric trains Lastochka ES1, ED4M, ET2M and ER2T make a passenger trips from Kolpino. Long-distance trains have not stop at Kolpino station. The station is approximately 1,2 km from the town center.  History  Kolpino station was opened on 9 May 1843 with the construction of the first in Russian Empire double tracked Saint Petersburg‚ÄìMoscow Railway. The first station building was one-storey and wooden. The station was rebuilt in the early 1890s and was reopened on 1 September 1893. The central part was decorated with wood carving. There were extensions, which housed the First Class and Second Class waiting rooms and the station-master's office. Telegraph station occupied one of the rooms. The station building was destroyed during the Second World War. The plan for the construction of the post-war Kolpino, including the railway station, was developed in Lenniyiproekt. The project of the station ensemble was created in the workshop of the architect M. Klimentov in 1949. The ensemble of Privokzalnaya Square designed by Klimentov was not fully realized. The new station building was not built because of enacted resolution \\"On the elimination of excesses in design and construction\\" not long after the death of Stalin in 1953. Instead of the planned construction a small one-storeyed wooden station-house was built. By the beginning of the 1990s two stone buildings on both sides of the railway tracks with ticket offices, waiting room and toilet were erected. During the last reconstruction they were dismantled. In USSR times, from 1932 to mid 1960s, a dedicated railroad line existed between Kolpino station and Detskoe Selo station in neighboring historical Pushkin town. Line had one stop in the middle, and its main purpose was transportation of workers to Kolpino's Izhorskiye Zavody industrial complex. The line was temporarily dismantled during Great Patriotic War.

Biography Castellaneta was graduated in Medicine, with specializations in Angiology and Laboratory Analysis. He has been an historical exponent of the Genoese center-right, entering politics in 1990 as a candidate of the Northern League to the city council of Genoa, where he was elected city councilor with 4,000 preferences. In 1992, he was elected Deputy with 28,000 votes of preference and participated in the work of the Health and Social Affairs Committee, after just two years the Legislature falls and is again presented by the Northern League and re-elected Deputy with 35,000 votes of preference. In 1994 he was elected president of the Order of Physicians of the Province of Genoa, a position he held until 2004 when he presented his resignation for personal reasons. In May 1994, contrary to the party's decision to support the Berlusconi I Cabinet, Castellaneta left the League and joined the mixed group, where he remained until the end of the legislature in 1996. In 1997 he founded a civic list (\\"Genova Nuova\\") and presented himself as a candidate for mayor of Genoa; although he reached the ballot with 72,000 votes of personal preference, he loses against Giuseppe Pericu, for a few thousand votes. It is reported for intemperances during the election campaign, like a fight with a journalist of a local TV in the studios of the broadcaster Telegenova. He tried once more to ran for mayor in 2002 ranking himself third. In 1998 his civic list takes the name of \\"New Liguria\\" which supports among other things two battle horses: the transformation of Liguria into a region with special status and the elimination of the hot cycle of the Ilva steel mill in Cornigliano, considered a damage to the environment and the redevelopment of the area; with his list he comes to the regional elections of 2000 in support of the candidate governor Sandro Biasotti and is elected regional councilor and president of the statute commission. In 2002 he came out of the majority because the Ligurian health programs are not suited to what he had always supported, both as a municipal councilor, as a deputy, and as president of the Order of Physicians. He supported the abrogative referendum of the law on assisted procreation, as well as proposals for the legalization of prostitution. He was also close to the Radical Party of Marco Pannella, since he has always voted in favor of abortion and divorce and against the law on assisted procreation and against the future law on living wills, considered highly limiting, and enrolled in the Transnational Radical Party; Castellaneta was among the first signatories for the presentation of the Pannella-Bonino list of the Italian Radicals for the regional elections of 2010 in Liguria, although the list did not reach then the quorum of signatures. In 1998 he participated in a petition against the government of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and then supported the Kosovo war, as opposed to his former party, the Northern League, close to the Serbian president. Castellaneta has abandoned politics after the predictable defeat of Biasotti in the regional elections of 2005 against Claudio Burlando. Federalist and anti-Islamist he disagreed with the numerous problems related to justice, health, institutional reforms; he criticized the management of the Northern League by Umberto Bossi, showing closeness to Euroscepticism and other issues with the new League leader Matteo Salvini. He was once again detached from the world of the League in controversy with the choice of Salvini not to nominate Edoardo Rixi as president of the Liguria region in favor of Forza Italia candidate Giovanni Toti.

All 45 people on board perished. An investigation revealed that the Antonov collided with a radiosonde, causing a loss of control. Accident Flight 1661 was a scheduled domestic flight from Novosibirsk to Bratsk, Russia, with an intermediate stop at Krasnoyarsk. At 03:42 local time the An-24 departed Tolmachevo Airport from runway 25 on a heading of 251¬∞. Shortly after take-off, the aircraft made a turn to the left, and at 03:53 contacted air traffic control (ATC) and reported their altitude as 4,200 meters. They then received clearance to continue climbing to 6,000 meters. At 04:10 ATC attempted to contact flight 1661, but no further transmissions from the Antonov were received. At a distance of 131 km from Tolmachevo, while ascending through 5,400 meters, the aircraft's nose cone collided with a radiosonde, destroying the aircraft's weather radar and damaging the cockpit. Out of control, the Antonov nosed over and began to descend rapidly. At an altitude of 2,000 meters and a speed of 700 km/h, the wing and horizontal stabilizer separated from the aircraft due to aerodynamic forces well beyond the plane's design limits. The fuselage then continued 2.5 km before striking the ground at 300 km/h and a vertical speed of 60 m/sec. The flight lasted 25 minutes, 25 seconds; the crash site was in a field approximately 142 km from Tolmachevo Airport. Aircraft The Antonov An-24 involved was serial numbered 79901204 and registered as CCCP-47751 to Aeroflot. The airliner was built in 1967, and had compiled 3,975 flight hours with 3,832 take-off and landing cycles at the time of the crash. Investigation Investigators examining the crash site discovered unusual damage to the aircraft's radome and nose structure, and noticed that a substantial portion of the windshield was missing. Also found among the wreckage were parts of two radiosondes of the type then being used by the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia for the monitoring of meteorological conditions. Investigators also discovered parts of the aircraft's nose cone six km away from the main crash site; these components displayed evidence of collision with a solid object. Officials concluded that the accident was caused by a collision in flight with a foreign object (the radiosonde/balloon assembly).

Police determined that they were poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent of the same kind used in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, away, almost four months prior. Sturgess died on 8 July, and Rowley regained consciousness two days after.  Hospital admissions and subsequent death of Sturgess  According to the subsequent press report released by the Metropolitan Police, at 10:15 on Saturday 30 June 2018, the South Western Ambulance Service was called to a residential address in Amesbury after Dawn Sturgess had collapsed. She was subsequently taken to hospital and admitted. At 15:30, the ambulance service was again called to that address, after Charlie Rowley had fallen ill. He was taken to hospital, and Wiltshire Police were informed of both admissions. On 8 July, Sturgess died at Salisbury District Hospital after doctors took the decision to switch off her life support. On 10 July, Rowley regained consciousness and there was a \\"small but significant improvement to his condition\\" according to the hospital. On 11 July, he was no longer in critical condition and the hospital downgraded his condition to \\"serious but stable\\". The same day, officers from the investigation team spoke with Rowley. He told his brother Matthew the nerve agent had been in a small perfume or aftershave bottle, which they had found in a park about nine days before spraying themselves with it. The police later closed and fingertip-searched Queen Elizabeth Gardens, a riverside park in central Salisbury, which the couple had visited the day before they fell ill. The funeral of Sturgess took place at Salisbury crematorium on 30 July 2018. On 20 July, Rowley was discharged from the hospital. Over the weekend of 18/19 August 2018, Rowley was re-admitted to hospital with sight problems. On 4 September 2018 he was reported to be ill with meningitis but was expected to leave hospital \\"within a month\\". Investigation The incident was investigated by the Specialist Operations Directorate of the Metropolitan Police, assisted nationally by the National Counter Terrorism Policing Network and locally by Wiltshire Police, in a multi-agency response named Operation Fortis. According to the Metropolitan Police, there was nothing in either of the victims' backgrounds to suggest that they were deliberately targeted, and there were no other reports of people presenting with similar symptoms. The couple were believed to have been near the roads that were sealed off during the investigation of the Skripal poisoning in Salisbury. During initial assessment, medical staff believed that the patients' illness was caused by the use of contaminated illegal drugs. But on 2 July, hospital staff had concerns over the symptoms the couple were displaying, and sent samples from both patients to the Government's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down for analysis. On 4 July the laboratory confirmed that the patients were exposed to Novichok nerve agent. According to BBC News, the \\"most likely hypothesis\\" was that the Novichok was left over from the attack on the Skripals and that the contaminated item which poisoned the couple \\"could be a vial or syringe because of the couple's lifestyle\\", as it is believed the Novichok was disposed of \\"in a haphazard way\\". Friends of the couple told The Guardian that Rowley frequently scavenged recycling bins for objects that he could sell, and that the couple's houses contained \\"loads of household things\\" they had picked up. Sites in both Amesbury and Salisbury which were believed to have been visited by the couple were cordoned off. These sites are the local Boots Pharmacy, the Baptist Centre, and Muggleton Road in Amesbury, and the Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Local residents were warned of an increased police presence, including officers wearing protective equipment. On 6 July, police announced that officers had identified and spoken to several key witnesses and were trawling through more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage which has been collected so far. On 13 July a police cordon closed the north end of Rollestone Street, Salisbury to enable members of the Counter Terrorism Policing Network to search John Baker House, a hostel for the homeless where Dawn Sturgess lived. On 24 July the cordon was lifted and the police announced that no contamination was found in John Baker House. The Metropolitan Police announced on 13 July 2018 that they had identified the source of the nerve agent that poisoned Sturgess and Rowley as being a \\"small bottle\\" discovered at Rowley's house in Amesbury which was confirmed by analysis at DSTL Porton Down to contain Novichok. Matthew Rowley, brother of the victim, said Charlie told him that he had picked up \\"the perfume bottle\\". The Metropolitan Police refused to confirm this claim. Also on 13 July, the intergovernmental Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) received a request from the UK for technical assistance on the incident in Amesbury. The OPCW sent a team of specialists who collected the samples and sent them to two laboratories. By 18 July, preliminary work was completed and the team left the UK. On 7 August 2018, the Foreign Office announced that OPCW experts would return to Amesbury to collect further samples. A spokesman said: \\"During their visit, the OPCW's experts will collect more samples to inform their work following their visit in July. The samples will be analysed at highly reputable international laboratories designated by the OPCW.\\" The poison was confirmed on 4 September by the OPCW to be the same kind of nerve agent as that used on the Skripals, but the OPCW also said that it could not determine if it was from the same batch. On 5 September 2018 Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said the police had \\"no doubt\\" that this incident was connected to the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. He said, \\"we do not believe Dawn and Charlie were deliberately targeted, but became victims as a result of the recklessness in which such a toxic nerve agent was disposed of.\\" The Met Police released a detailed description of the Salisbury poisoning and named the suspects wanted. This went on to state that the investigation into the Amesbury poisoning was ongoing by the Police and the CPS, and further charges relating to Sturgess and Rowley would follow.  Inquest  The inquest for Sturgess was opened and adjourned by HM Coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon in Salisbury on 19 July 2018, with a Pre-Inquest Review listed for 16 January 2019. This was delayed, in part because the Crown Prosecution Service requested a suspension in view of the ongoing criminal investigation. The Senior Coroner, David Ridley, issued a 31-page ruling on the scope of the inquest on 20 December 2019, but no date for the full inquest was given.  Government response  On 5 July 2018, Home Secretary Sajid Javid chaired a meeting of the COBR committee to discuss the incident. In the House of Commons later that day, Javid stated the most likely hypothesis was that the Novichok was in an item discarded after the Skripal attack. He accused Russia of using Britain as a \\"dumping ground for poison\\".\\"Amesbury poisoning: Russia using UK as 'dumping ground\\", BBC News, 5 July 2018 Interview with Rowley Rowley gave an interview to ITV News on 24 July 2018, stating that he believed a sealed box of a recognisable brand of perfume, which he had found and given to Sturgess, was the source of the Novichok. His partner became sick \\"within 15 minutes\\" after spraying the \\"oily substance\\" onto her wrists before rubbing them together, under the assumption that it was perfume. He also stated that he came into contact with the chemical agent after some tipped onto his hands while attaching the plastic spray dispenser to the bottle, but had washed his hands soon after. They had used a knife to open the sealed packaging. Fate of flat In June 2020 it was announced that the flat the poisonings happened in, together with the one below it, would be demolished. Both Dawn Sturgess‚Äô family and partner supported the demolition and liked the idea of it being turned into a green space. Dawn's father, Stan Sturgess, said \\"It‚Äôs a shame that it is being lost but I can imagine that people wouldn‚Äôt want to live there.\\" Rowley said \\"I think it's for the best. There would always be a stigma around it.\\"  References  Category:21st century in Wiltshire Category:Crime in Wiltshire Category:Deaths in South West England Category:Forensic toxicology Amesbury poisonings Amesbury poisonings Category:Poisoning by drugs, medicaments and biological substances ","title":"2018 Amesbury poisonings"},{"id":"57829389","text":"Crystal Swan () is a 2018 Belarusian drama film directed by Darya Zhuk.

There is also an order of precedence among the various banners that goes: the Army banner; the Banner of Queen Elizabeth II; the Banner of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother; the Banners of the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip; the Banner of the Princess Anne; the Banner of Princess Alice and Banners of the Governor-General.Maitland, 2015, p. 308-309. Banners The first banners issued to Australian units were Union Jacks made of silk in recognition of service during the Boer war. These did not feature a date, cypher or badge as are usually found on banners. Sovereign's banners and those of corps where the monarch is colonel in chief or captain general are royal blue silk and other banners crimson. In 1956 Lady Gowrie, widow of Australia's tenth governor general, Lord Gowrie VC, offered his baronial banner to the Royal Australian Armoured Corps. It was presented by governor general, Field Marshal Slim, during a parade involving squadrons from the 1st Armoured Regiment, 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers and the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles at Puckapunyal on 15 June 1957. The Military Board decided in 1966 that the officer training unit should have a banner. The governor general Lord Casey gave his approval to its being named the governor general's banner presenting it at Scheyville on 8 October 1967. It featured a crimson field with the governor general's insignia and the year 1967 on the observe. Since then various elements of the Australian Army have adopted banners, especially following the 1969 publication of Australian Army Military Regulations and Orders (AMR&O;) 172, where it was authorised that any corps or unit be entitled to both a Sovereign's banner (including those already having standards, guidons and colours) and training establishments that do not have colours to a governor general's banner. Additionally any corps not having standards, guidons or colours may receive a banner from a member of the royal family (other than the monarch) or the governor general.Maitland, 2015, pp. 188-189. On 10 March 2002 there was a parade held at the Australian War Memorial to mark to the centenary of the Australian Army. The English red silk Australian Army banner was placed on the Stone of Remembrance before being presented by the governor general, Sir William Deane, and received by regimental sergeant major of the Army, Pedro Rosemond. It features a gold fringe, gold and crimson cords and tassels, and mounted on a pike with a British royal crest finial. On the obverse it bears the Coat of arms of Australia and the dates \\"1901‚Äì2001\\" in gold in the upper hoist. The reverse bears the rising sun badge of the Australian Army along with seven campaign honours on small gold-edged scrolls: South Africa, World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya-Borneo, South Vietnam, and Peacekeeping.Maitland, 2015, pp. 190-191. Such presentations continue with the Royal Australian Corps of Transport receiving a banner on 1 June 2013 from Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal as colonel in chief at Amberley. Corps flags All members of the Australian Defence Force up to the rank of lieutenant colonel are allocated to corps. These flags reflect the various corps colours and with the exception of the Royal Australian Engineers and the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps feature the corresponding badge. Not all corps are of sufficient scale and degree of activity to have flags.Maitland, 2015, p. 298. The order of precedence for corps is as follows: * The Corps of Staff Cadets; * The Royal Australian Armoured Corps; * The Royal Australian Regiment of Artillery; * The Royal Australian Engineers; * The Royal Australian Corps of Signals; * The Royal Australian Infantry Corps; * The Australian Army Aviation Corps; * The Australian Intelligence Corps; * The Royal Australian Army Chaplains Department; * The Royal Australian Corps of Transport; * The Royal Australian Army Medical Corps; * The Royal Australian Army Dental Corps; * The Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps; * The Royal Australian Army Electrical and Mechanical Engineers; * The Royal Australian Army Educational Corps; * The Australian Army Public Relations Service; * The Australian Army Catering Corps; * The Royal Australian Army Pay Corps; * The Australian Army Legal Corps; * The Royal Australian Army Corps of Military Police; * The Australian Psychology Corps; * The Australian Army Band Corps; * The Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps.Maitland, 2015, p. 309. {align=\\"center\\"  Flag of the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps } Regimental and battalion flags Not all regiments and units have adopted flags. State regiments have opted to retain distinguishing colours. The Royal Australian Regiment flag was authorised in 2003 and first paraded on Anzac Day 2004 and there are flags for its nine battalions. There are also various unit and sub unit flags including for the 1st Health Support Battalion; 11th Combat Service Support Battalion; 'A' Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery; 'A' Squadron 10th Light Horse Regiment; Squadron Flag, Royal Australian Corps of Signals and Independent Squadron, Australian Army Aviation Corps.Maitland, 2015, p. 301-304. The order of precedence for Royal Australian Infantry Corps regiments is as follows: * The Royal Australian Regiment; * 51st Battalion The Far North Queensland Regiment; * The Royal Queensland Regiment; * The Royal New South Wales Regiment; * The Royal Victoria Regiment; * The Royal South Australia Regiment; * The Royal Western Australia Regiment; * The Royal Tasmania Regiment; * The Special Air Services Regiment; * North West Mobile Force; * The Pilbara Regiment; * 2nd Commando Regiment; * 1st Commando Regiment; * Sydney University Regiment; * Melbourne University Regiment; * Adelaide University Regiment; * Queensland University Regiment; * Western Australia University Regiment; and * University of New South Wales Regiment.Maitland, 2015, pp. 310-311. Royal Australian Navy ensigns HMCS Protector of the Commonwealth Naval Forces circa 1901. HMAS Hobart during the invasion of Guadalcanal during World War II. The pre federation colonial navies flew British blue ensigns defaced with the relevant local badge. Outside of colonial waters these ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy and used the British white ensign. In 1901 the colonial navies were integrated into the Commonwealth Naval Forces and consequently flew the Australian flag. Following the formation of the Royal Australian Navy, on 5 October 1911, Naval Order 78/1911 directed all vessels to fly the British White Ensign on the stern and the flag of Australia on the Jackstaff.Australian flags, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2006, p. 44.George Odgers, \\"The Royal Australian Navy ‚Äì An Illustrated History\\", p. 41 The Argus newspaper, edition of 29 July 1911, had furthermore carried a notice that the \\"navy orders that the Australian flag is to be the saluting flag at all reviews and ceremonial parades on shore\\", with it also being required that the Union Jack is flown at the saluting point \\"when representatives of His Majesty the King review the Commonwealth forces.\\"The Argus, 'Australian flag', 29 July 1911, p. 21 . However the practice of RAN captains flying the Union Jack continued, as was the case at a review of at Fremantle in 1913. Following a public demonstration by the Australian Natives Association the government took action to phase in the 1911 naval regulations.Elizabeth Kwan, Flag and Nation, University of New South Wales press, 2006, p. 55. The British White Ensign was finally replaced by a distinctively Australian White Ensign on 1 March 1967. Prior to this time it was a not unknown for RAN captains to fly the Australian flag from the foremast of single masted ships and the mainmast of two masted ships as the battle flag when at action stations instead of the Royal Navy white ensign as happened at the battle of the Cocos between HMAS Sydney and the German cruiser SMS Emden.Frank Cayley, Flag of Stars, Rigby, 1966, p. 122, 153. {align=\\"center\\" Royal Australian Navy white ensign (1967 - ) Royal Navy white ensign } Royal Australian Air Force ensigns The Royal Australian Air Force shared the sky blue ensign of their British counterpart from 1922. An Australian variant was adopted in 1948. It featured a titled southern cross to accommodate the downsized roundel previously occupying the fly half. The RAAF roundel was last modified in 1982 with the creation of an Australian roundel featuring a stylised leaping red kangaroo in place of the concentric red disk.Australian flags, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2006, p. 29. The order of precedence for the RAAF is as follows: the Queen's colour for the RAAF; unit Queen's colours; Squadron standards and Governor-General's banners. There is also and the order of precedence among the various Queen's colours that goes: Queen's colour for the RAAF; RAAF School of Technical Training; RAAF academy; RAAF College; Central Flying School; School of Air Navigation; No. 3 Aircraft Depot; No. 1 Flying Training School; No. 1 Aircraft Depot; No. 2 Aircraft Depot and No. 503 Wing.Maitland, 2015, p. 311. {align=\\"center\\" Royal Australian Air Force Ensign (1982 - ) Royal Australian Air Force Ensign (1948-1982) Royal Air Force Ensign } The Australian ensigns at war Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig reviews the 5th Australian Division at Ebblinghem, 29 August 1917. The Australian flag can be seen on the right and the Union Jack in the background. In 1908, Australian Army Military Order, No 58/08 ordered the blue \\"Australian Ensign\\" to replace the Union Jack at all military establishments. From 1911 it served as the saluting flag of the Australian army at all reviews and ceremonial parades (M.O.135) with the Union Jack being reserved for \\"all occasions when a representative of His Majesty the King reviews the Commonwealth forces\\" (M.O.391).M.O.58 (1908) Attention is directed to Statutory Rule 27/08 published in M.O. 58/08. The Australian Ensign will accordingly be flown at all flag stations throughout the Commonwealth. M.O.135 (1911) It is directed that in future the Australian Flag is to be used as the saluting flag at all reviews and ceremonial parades.Maitland, 2015, p. 220. By traditional British understanding, the blue ensign was reserved for official government use although the red ensign, formerly the popular favourite with the general public,Kwan, 2005, p. 106. was nevertheless still to be seen in military circulation until after the 1953 legislation, meaning the 1st and 2nd Australian Imperial Forces served under both the blue and red versions. Extract from the Australian Army Military Orders manual. World War I The Australian flag was associated with an act of war for the first recorded time as it flew above the fort at Queenscliff in Victoria which opened fire to prevent the German steamer, Pfalz, from leaving port on 6 August 1914.Frank Cayley, Flag of Stars, Rigby, 1966, p. 121, 153 General Birdwood dispatched an Australian flag to the 15th Infantry brigade with orders that it be flown over Harnonnieres, an honour that the commander of the 59th battalion bestowed on the first man to reach the objective, 22 year old Private Ernest Forty.Kwan, 2006. p. 61Goodman, 1998, p. 20-12 In 1918 as the 2nd Division entered the Belgian town of Chaleroi the locals turned out to greet them waving Australian flags made out of brown paper bags.Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 30 August 2001, 30708 (John Anderson). The children of Villers-Bretonneaux still maintain the tradition of raising the Australian flag in memory of the Australians who died in liberating the area in world war one.Stephanie Kennedy, Villers-Bretonneux remembers decisive battle 90 years on, 25 April 2008, Australian Broadcasting Corporation . The Australian flag was flown above the general headquarters during the Hundred Days Offensive.Rupert Goodman, Don't change our flag: An exposure of false and misleading arguments, Boolorong Press, 1998, pp. 21‚Äì22. World War II There were a number of Australian flag raisings in the Pacific and Middle Eastern theatres during the second world war. It was flown over Kokoda in 1942Western Star and Roma Advertiser, 'Australian flag over Kokoda', p. 2 .The Argus, 'Australian flag hoisted at Kokoda, p. 9 . and Lae in 1943 where \\"The Australian flag was hoisted on the pole of the control tower on Lae airfield and American and Australian troops gave victory cheers as the flag floated in the breeze\\".Canberra Times, 'Australian flag back over Lae', 20 September 1943, p 1. . There has since been a commemorative plaque laid at Lae with the inscription reading: \\"Here on 16th September 1943 the Australian National Flag was raised by Commander 25th Aust. Inf. Bde to mark the capture of this important base from the Japanese.\\" On 24 February 1945 The Mail in Adelaide published a photograph under the heading \\"OUR FLAG ON THE PHILIPPINES\\" of an Australian flag with the caption stating that: \\"The first Australian flag to reach the Philippines was draped in front of Australia House, residence of Australian war correspondents. They look very happy about it.\\"The Mail (Adelaide), 'Our flag in the Philippines', 24 February 1945, p. 1 The Australian flag was raised on Linkgas beach during the invasion of Tarakan. Some of the best chronicled flag raisings took place during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945. In the Australian War Memorial collection is a photograph of a flag raising ceremony that took place after the landing at Lingkas, Tarakan in the Netherlands East Indies on 1 May 1945 with the caption stating: \\"Happy soldiers of the 9th Australian Division raise the Australian flag on a bamboo pole on the first day of Operation Oboe One, the Division's successful attack and landing on Tarakan Island then occupied by Japanese forces.\\" It was also reported on 8 May 1945 in the Melbourne Argus under the headline \\"AUSTRALIANS CAPTURE TARAKAN AIRSTRIP: Victorian Battalion in Thick of Fight\\" that, after using tanks as mobile artillery in a struggle that lasted over five days: \\"That night the troops who had won the air strip enjoyed their first night's unbroken rest since they landed on the island at dawn on Tuesday. They forgot their weariness, their sweat-sodden clothes, and unshaven faces, in the cheer they gave as they watched the Australian flag and their own battalion emblem being hoisted over the strip.\\"The Argus, 'AUSTRALIANS CAPTURE TARAKAN AIRSTRIP', 8 May 1945, p. 3 Lieutenant K. McKitrick raising the Australian flag after victory in the battle of Tarakan in world war 2 At the end of the battle of Tarakan the Perth Sunday Times Lieutenant K. McKitrick appeared on the front page of the 20 May 1945 edition, raising the Australian flag on Sadau Island under the headline \\"OUR FLAG ON TARAKAN\\" with the caption reading: \\"A.I.F. VETERANS of the 9th Division fly an Australian flag on Tarakan Island (Borneo) on which, today's cables say, they have achieved their objectives.\\" Other flags associated with military forces in Australia The Union Jack is raised outside a supply depot of the 9th Australian division on Tarakan, 2 May 1945. There have been other flag designs and individual specimens that have historically been associated with the Australian Defence Force and the former British colonial forces in Australia. There not being a distinguishing flag for Australia until the 1901 Federal Flag Design Competition the various pre federation military forces used British and local colonial flags up until the Boer war.Maitland, 2015, p. 68-207. In 1802 there was an incident where the third governor of New South Wales, Philip Gidley King (1758‚Äì1808), ordered Lieutenant Charles Robbins, RN, to set out from Sydney in a tiny armed schooner, the Cumberland, with a crew of seventeen in search of a French surveying expedition. The French were finally encountered on 14 December on King Island. As the naturalists were busy collecting insect and plant samples Robbins landed and his party marched to the back of the French camp. He then posted three men in front of a tree who upon the Union Jack being raised fired three volleys and gave three cheers before it was audibly announced that the island was a possession of His Majesty King George III.Frank Cayley, Flag of Stars, Rigby, 2nd ed., 1980, p. 24. The Australia army's oldest battle honour dates from Suakin in 1885. It was originally an honorary distinction granted by King Edward VII in 1907 to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Australian infantry regiments. Their colonial predecessors the 1st, 2nd and 3rd regiments of the New South Wales contingent had essentially constituted the infantry contingent from that colony in the Sudan war. This honour was subsequently passed to the 1st battalion (The East Sydney Regiment); 3rd battalion (The Werriwa Regiment); 17th battalion and 20th battalion (The Parramatta and Blue Mountains Regiment). This honour is now held by their present-day descendant the Royal New South Wales Regiment.Maitland, 2015, p. 73-66. British colonial forces and militia The first surviving reference to military colours in Australia was by Mary Easty, in connection with Major Grose being sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, who wrote that: \\"the Colour of the N.S.Wails [Corps] was Displaeyed for the first time on this Ground.\\"Maitland, 2015, p. 99. Only one British unit stationed in the colonies the 39th (Dorset) regiment has been identified as receiving colours which were presented by governor Darling on 16 May 1831. There were eighteen locally raised units to receive colours prior to federation. It appears the first such ceremony took place on 20 June 1855 at the Sydney Domain involving a flag or banner rather than colours being presented to the Volunteer Force of New South Wales.Maitland, 2015, p. 100-101 * In the collection of the Power House Museum in Sydney there is what appears to be a banner that features the royal cypher of King George IV around which is embroidered the words Royal New South Wales Veteran Corps, which arrived in the colony in 1826. * The Australian War Memorial holds the regimental colour of the Richmond Company of the Victorian Volunteer Rifles Corps that were presented at the Richmond cricket ground on 2 February 1862.Maitland, 2015, p. 102. * On 30 September 1861 the Buckingham Rifles were presented colours at the Hobart Domain that are now on display at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.Maitland, 2015, p. 103. * The Bathurst Volunteer Rifles were presented with colours by the Countess of Belmore, wife of Governor the Earl of Belmore also in attendance at the ceremony held on 3 June 1869, that are now under preservation at the Bathurst Museum.Maitland, 2015, p. 104. Boer war HMQS Mosquito flying the Queensland flag circa 1901. The Australian colonies all dispatched contingents to fight in the Boer War. The Imperial government acknowledged this service by issuing a number of colours, also known as honourable insignia or King's banners, being Union Jacks made of silk.Maitland, 2015, p. 107. * The King's banner presented to the New South Wales Lancers is under preservation at the Lancers' Linden House Museum. * There is a photograph of a flag covering the grave of Breaker Morant in Pretoria, South Africa during the Boer War in 1901 that is believed to have been the predominately red ensign.Matthew Purcell, 'Tenterfield to show Morant memorabilia', Northern Daily Leader, 22 April 2016 1st Australian Imperial Force There are a number of Union Jacks, Australian ensigns and regimental banners associated with the first world war still under preservation at the Australian War Memorial, Imperial War Museum and in other collections. * According to Corporal Edward Watson the first Australian flag taken to the western front during world war one was a red ensign he received from prime minister Billy Hughes as a departing gift to the Imperial reserves. It was present at the Battle of Mons where there were reports German forces were held up at a crucial time as a result of the appearance of the Angels of Mons. * The Australian War Memorial holds the Australian flag that was raised along with the Union Jack by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force on Kawieng, New Ireland in September 1914. * Also under preservation is the Australian flag carried by General Monash's lance bearer in the 1919 London Victory Parade. Goodman, 1998, p. 20-21 Maitland has noted that \\"postcards were hugely used during the Great World War and often displayed Australia's National Flag\\" with the Polygon Wood scene by Alfred Pearse sold to raise money for the Australian Comforts fund.Maitland, 2015, p. 221, 247. It was inspired by an event that actually took place during the battle of the Menin Road on 20 September 1017 where message was sent \\"Consolidating objective. Australian flag flying on Anzac House.\\"Kwan, 2006, p. 61. Kwan has concluded the scene also contains artistic license in that the flag itself was constructed of paper measuring 7.5 cm x 10 cm and struck to a can of bully beef that was \\"blown to pieces by a shell later that day.\\"Elizabeth Kwan, Flag and Nation, New South Wales University press, 2006, p. 61. The event was reenacted at an Australian National Flag Day eve ceremony held in Martin Place, Sydney.Richard Wood, 'Diggers' bravery in World War I battle recalled in Sydney restaging', www.9news.com.au, 2 September 2017 . =Gallipoli flags= * The first flag to be carried ashore by the 1st AIF during the Gallipoli landings was the banner of the 12th battalion 3rd brigade which has been restored and is now on permanent display at the Imperial War Museum in London.Charles Miranda, 'First flag of AIF at Gallipoli restored by Imperial War Museum', Herald Sun, 4 April 2014 * The University of Queensland's Emmanuel College has an Australian flag that was taken to Gallipoli and France by Reverend E.N. Merrington.

Inside the wreath are the initials G.V.A. with the letters G and A being intertwined in yellow thread. This device is surmounted by a crown also in yellow thread. The accompanying plaque reads: \\"This flag was recovered from General Birdwood's Headquarters by Cpl. A.H. Thomas, 12th Australian Light Horse, at the evacuation of Gallipoli on the 18th December, 1915 and presented to St Barnabas' Church of England, Fairfield, as a memorial. 29.7.62.\\".Maitland, 2015, p. 119. * There was a ceremony Australian War Memorial on 11 April 2000 where Alec Campbell, the last surviving Gallipoli veteran, symbolically presented an Australian flag to a serving member of the Australian Defence Force. It remains under preservation in Canberra and has been raised at Gallipoli every Anzac Day since. 2nd Australian Imperial Force An extract from a report of the flag raising ceremony at Tarakan airfield during the second world war.'A.I.F. WIN TARAKAN TOWN AND AIRSTRIP', Townsville Daily Bulletin, 8 May 1945 edition, page 1 The hero of the battle of Sattelberg Tom Derrick has the honour of raising the Australian red ensign after the action for which he was later awarded the Victoria Cross in 1943.

The ecoregion is in the Palearctic realm, with a Humid Continental climate. It covers .  Location and description  The ecoregion covers a \\"Z\\" shaped area in which the northern section is a 400 km band of forest north of Khabarovsk parallel to the Amur River (which is 20-30 km to the south), the vertical band of which parallels the Ussuri River (which is 20-30 km to the west) on the western slopes of the Sikhote-Alin Mountains, and the base of which is the eastern slope of the Sikhote-Alin in Primorsky Krai.  Climate  The region has a Humid continental, cool summer climate (Koppen classification (Dwb)). This climate is characterized by high variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with dry winters and cool summers.  Flora and fauna  The Ussuri forests are the most biologically diverse in northern Asia. The maritime influence moderates the climate, precipitation is high enough to support rich forests, and the region is a boundary area between mountains, river flat lands, and sea coast. The forests of the region are dominated by Spruce (Picea ajanensis), Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii), Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis), Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica), and Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla).

Overview Killie, like the previous season, went on a pre-season training camp in La Manga, Spain. On 13 July 2018, manager Steve Clarke said that Youssouf Mulumbu had left Kilmarnock and wasn't expected to return to the club. A Kilmarnock XI took part in two friendly matches. The first was against East Kilbride on 18 July 2018 in which Daniel Higgins scored the only goal of the game to give Killie a 1‚Äì0 win. On 22 July 2018, Killie played local junior side Kilwinning Rangers in Ben Lewis's testimonial. Kilmarnock finished the season in third place - the club's highest league finish since 1966 - and with a record points tally. Eamonn Brophy's 89th-minute penalty secured a 2‚Äì1 win over Rangers in the last game of the season to secure third and qualification to the 2019‚Äì20 UEFA Europa League. Kilmarnock were seeded for the group stage draw of the League Cup and were drawn to face Premiership rivals St Mirren along with Dumbarton, Queen's Park and Spartans. In their opening fixture, Kilmarnock drew 0‚Äì0 with St Mirren and missed out on the opportunity for a bonus point as they lost 3‚Äì2 on penalties. They won their subsequent three matches to finish first in Group H. Killie were eliminated in the second round by Rangers. Kilmarnock entered the fourth round of the Scottish Cup as one of the Premiership clubs, starting on 19 January 2019. After defeating Forfar Athletic, they lost to Rangers in a fifth round replay.

Flower, who was a real estate developer in Denver and a close friend of Mayor Robert W. Speer. With The house is historically significant for its association with attorney Joel F. Vaile and his family, who were leaders in the economic and social development of the Denver area and the state of Colorado. Vaile bought the house in 1890. He was an attorney, prosecutor, and president of the Colorado Bar Association. A founding member of the law firm Wolcott, Vaile, and Waterman, Vaile was a national authority on general business, mining, and railroad law. His arguments were adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Del Monte Mining and Milling v. Last Chance Mining and Milling, 171 U.S. 55, 18 S.Ct. 895, 43 L.Ed. 72 (1898). Vaile was first married to Charlotte M. White Vaile, an author of children's books. Their son William was his law partner and a member of Congress. Their first daughter Gertrude became the executive secretary to the committee of the National Conference on Charities and Correction in 1916, and was elected to head the National Welfare Workers in 1925. Their second daughter, Lucretia, became president of the Colorado Librarian's Association in 1922. Charlotte died in 1902. In 1912, he married Anna Louisa Wolcott, who established and ran the Wolcott School for Girls. One year after retiring, Joel F. Vaile died in 1916 in Pasadena, California.

The igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock is poorly understood except through deep boreholes and does not outcrop at the surface. The basement rock is divided between the Grenville Province and Superior Province. When the Grenville Province crust collided with Proto-North America, it launched the Grenville orogeny, a major mountain building event. The Grenville mountains eroded, filling in rift basins and Ohio was flooded and periodically exposed as dry land throughout the Paleozoic. In addition to marine carbonates such as limestone and dolomite, large deposits of shale and sandstone formed as subsequent mountain building events such as the Taconic orogeny and Acadian orogeny led to additional sediment deposition. Ohio transitioned to dryland conditions in the Pennsylvanian, forming large coal swamps and the region has been dryland ever since. Until the Pleistocene glaciations erased these features, the landscape was cut with deep stream valleys, which scoured away hundreds of meters of rock leaving little trace of geologic history in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Stratigraphy, Tectonics & Geologic History Proterozoic sandstone drill core taken in Warren County, Ohio. The oldest igneous and metamorphic rocks in Ohio date to the Precambrian. They remain poorly understood, except for a few deep boreholes. Central and eastern Ohio is underlain by the metamorphic rocks belonging to the Grenville Province‚Äîan ancient plate that collided with the Superior Province of Proto-North America in the Proterozoic eon, beginning slightly more than one billion years ago. In Ohio, the Grenville Province and Superior Province are separated by the Grenville Front, which underlies the Cincinnati Arch and Findlay Arch. West of the Grenville Front is a series of rifts, similar to the modern rifts in East Africa that form the Red Sea. The rifts in western Ohio form part of the East Continent Rift Zone, which is covered in six kilometers of undeformed sandstones and other silicate sedimentary rocks. The collision of the Grenville Province with Proto-North America resulted in the long-lasting Grenville orogeny, producing a tall mountain range. However, the mountain range eroded to an undulating plain, bounded by rift valleys in the west, by the start of the Paleozoic. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) The Cambrian at the start of the Paleozoic marked the proliferation of multi-cellular life. By the Late Cambrian, Ohio was covered in shallow seas, creating marine and delta deposits. Sandstone, mudstone, shale, limestone and dolomite deposited atop the faulted Precambrian basement rocks. Periodic retreats of sea level during the Paleozoic eroded these rock units, leading to some unconformities in the sedimentary sequence, through the Early Permian. During some of these periods of sea level retreat, beginning in the Ordovician, the region experienced terrestrial erosion in the Pennsylvanian and Permian. The drop in sea levels was related to the uplift of the region during the Taconic orogeny to the east. In the Middle Ordovician, a renewed marine transgression flooded the region, depositing limestone reefs. These rocks are only known from underground drilling and do not outcrop at the surface. The Point Pleasant Formation is the oldest rock unit exposed at the surface in Ohio and formed during the Late Ordovician, outcropping along the Ohio River near Cincinnati. The formation records a transition from shallow-water limestone reef formation to a deeper water environment, marked by overlying shale and limestone, which form the Cincinnatian Series. Clay shed from the rising mountains, associated with the Taconic orogeny formed the shale units. The warm sea water created perfect conditions for abundant biological activity and the Cincinnatian Series is highly fossil-bearing, outcropping across much of southwest Ohio in river beds, hillsides and road cuts. Ohio's State Invertebrate Fossil, is a trilobite found in the formation. The Southern Hemisphere where Ohio was located at the end of the Ordovician experienced a widespread glaciation, around 438 million years ago. Sea level dropped due to the glaciation, accompanied by a subsidence of the land. Ordovician deposition ended, marked by a paraconformable break in the Drakes Formation. By the beginning of the Silurian, sea levels advanced again. The shallow sea in the Silurian led to the formation of subtropical carbonates, which now outcrop to the east and west of the Cincinnati Arch and at the crest of the Findlay Arch. Some of the carbonates were deposited in reefs, such as the Early Silurian Lockport Dolomite. Although they do contain some fossils, most of the Silurian rock units poorly preserve evidence of life. The units are separated by layers of evaporite, including anhydrite, gypsum and halite. Thick salt beds formed in connection with drops in sea level and land subsidence, generating the thick salt beds of the Salina Group in eastern Ohio. A new plate collision launched the Acadian orogeny in the Devonian and led to sediment deposition in the Appalachian Basin of eastern Ohio. The Early Devonian Helderberg Limestone and Oriskany Sandstone, which formed 408 million years ago, are known in the subsurface. Some Early Devonian rocks, of the Holland Quarry Shale, were briefly exposed at the quarry in Lucas County, before it was filled in and reclaimed. Most Devonian rocks date to the Middle Devonian and outcrop between southern Ohio and Lake Erie. A large unconformity separates Silurian and Middle Devonian dolomite and limestone. The overlying Devonian rocks include the Columbus Limestone to the east of the Findlay Arch and the Detroit River Group carbonates to the west. The angular unconformity between lower Silurian rocks is marked in some places by phosphate beds, that preserve bones and teeth. A cast of a Dunkleosteus fossil found near Cleveland, Ohio The Columbus Limestone is especially fossil bearing and outcrops in a band between Columbus and Sandusky County, as well as on Kelleys Island in Lake Erie. The best fossil exposures are found at limestone quarries along the belt, which supply local concrete demand. Toward the end of the Middle Devonian, the marine environment shifted toward black marine shale deposition, of the Olentangy Shale and Ohio Shale. For the most part, these shale units are not fossiliferous. However, in some places, there are occurrences of brachiopod, arthropod, arthrodire and shark fossils, as well as Dunkleosteus armor plates. At the start of the Mississippian, in the Carboniferous, 340 million years ago, river and delta sediments covered over the shales, producing the Bedford Shale, Berea Sandstone, Cuyahoga Formation and Logan Formation. The deposition of these units was briefly interrupted by a return to a stagnant marine environment, forming the Sunbury Shale. Outcrops of Mississippian rocks run parallel to Devonian rocks across central Ohio and paralleling the Lake Erie shore. In fact, Mississippian outcrops form a band of hills five to 10 miles south of the lake. In general the Mississippian rocks are moderately fossiliferous, with good crinoid preservation in Cuyahoga Formation. Pennsylvanian rocks deposited in stream channels carved into older Mississippian rocks. The Middle Pennsylvanian Sharon sandstone and Pottsville Group preserve evidence of uplift in the east, and subsidence in the west of the Appalachian Basin. The rocks that formed in the Pennsylvanian and Permian were mainly terrestrial in origin, including non-marine shale, sandstone, coal, ironstone and limestone, along with some marine rocks, such as flint and marine shale. River deltas in the Pennsylvanian, were covered in thick, swampy vegetation, helping to produce coal deposits. Sedimentary rocks and fossil evidence suggests that Ohio has been a terrestrial environment since the Permian. For instance, the main subdivisions of the Pennsylvanian: the Pottsville Group, Alleghany Group, Conemaugh Group and Monongahela Group, along with the Early Permian Dunkard Group, are each more terrestrial than the last. The region was situated inland, experiencing terrestrial erosion as the Proto-North American continent of Laurasia collided with Gondwana to form the supercontinent Pangaea. Rocks from the end of Paleozoic are best exposed in road cuts along I-77, between Canton and Marietta, I-77 from Cambridge to Bridgeport and cliffs on the Ohio River north of Marietta to East Liverpool. Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago-present) Glacial grooves on Kelleys Island. For 245 million years, spanning the entirety of the Mesozoic in the Paleogene, of the early Cenozoic, Ohio experienced long-running uplift and weathering. Prior to the Pleistocene glaciations, the region was covered in large stream valleys, which are believed to have removed several hundred meters of rock, erasing most evidence of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Some bones and plant fossils, including mastodon remains, have been found in recent sediments formed since the Pleistocene. Natural resource geology A limestone quarry on Kelley's Island, Ohio. Ohio has varied natural resources. In 2016, 64.92 million tons of limestone and dolomite valued at $615 million was quarried, along with 12.23 million tons of coal, worth $541 million. Sand and gravel, salt, sandstone and conglomerate all have production over one million tons. Shale and clay are also quarried. Ohio produces three billion dollars worth of natural gas and $844 million of oil annually. Coal deposits were first recognized in the 1740s by early settlers and were mapped as early as 1752. Decreased demand due to increased natural gas production has reduced coal mining in the 2010s, although one underground mine and three surface mines received expansion permits from the state in 2016. Mining and quarrying currently employs 3,546 people in the state. The Salina Group is mined 500 meters beneath Lake Erie, in Cuyahoga County and Fairport Harbor.

History and description  The decorative reliefs are carved in wood and covered with thin layers of gold. The construction of the chapel was the result of an initiative of the Brothers of the Venerable Third Order of St. Francis of the Chagas, created in Recife in the 16th century. Since many of its members were well-off, they decided to erect a chapel for the Order's novices. The cornerstone was launched on May 13, 1696 by Captain General Caetano de Melo Castro, being master-builder Portuguese Captain Ant√¥nio Fernandes de Matos. The chapel was opened to the public on September 15, 1697, with mass presided over by the Commissary Visitor Friar Jer√¥nimo da Ressurrei√ß√£o, although it was not yet entirely finished, remaining the works until 1724. Built in a time of great prosperity in the region, over time the chapel received improvements and rich decoration, and its present condition dates basically of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Its name derives from the great quantity of gold used in the covering of the exuberant wood that fills practically all the spaces of the walls, altars and ceiling. Its construction and decoration was attended by several important artists in the region. The ceiling with the external arches, the croiser and the main chapel, as well as auxiliary furniture, are the work of Lu√≠s Machado, of the 17th century. The ceiling is divided into caskets for oil-painted panels with various scenes. The main chapel, with a central niche for a large crucifix and side niches for Saints Cosmas and Damian, was carved by Ant√¥nio Martins Santiago in 1698, and was gilded by Manuel de Jesus Pinto in 1799. Along the side walls there is a series of panels of azulejos, smaller altars with important statues, of which stand out the one of St. Elizabeth of Portugal, the christ Cristo atado √† coluna, and that of the Lord of the Steps (With a life-size rock image with inlays of rubies), and dozens of painted panels depicting saints and personifications of the Faith, Hope, Charity and Constance. We sadly know that not even the archives of the Order, patiently refined, were able to advance us names of artists who had worked on these wonderful paintings. We only know that these paintings were executed between the years 1699 and 1700 and the panels of the lining between 1701 and 1702, according to the book of Receita e Despesa (excerpt taken from the Book of the Historian Fernando Pio, Former Minister of the Third Order of Saint Francis who wrote all about the Golden Chapel with research done in the collection of the Venerable Third Order of the Glorious Patriarch Saint Francis of Assisi of Recife). From 1776 to 1777 he suffered the lining of the chapel serious repair, without prejudice to the coffins, supported by careful hands, being worthy of greater attention two, large, next to the benches, representing the arrest and death of the Franciscans, whose tormentors, curiously, had their faces erased and scratched, in date unknown, by the indignation of some devotee. In the sacristy there is also furniture carved in rosewood, dating to 1762, in addition to a marble table and a washbasin imported from Estremoz.

She was one of the most successful writers in this line, as well as other types of prose composition. She authored History of Architecture from the Earliest Times (1848), which was the first history of architecture to be published in the United States. Early years and education Louisa Caroline Huggins was born on July 6, 1799, at New Haven, Connecticut. Her parents were Ebenezer Huggins and his wife, Mary (Dickerman). Tuthill is descended, on both sides, from the early colonists of New Haven, one of her ancestors, on the father's side, being Theophilus Eaton, the first Governor of the New Haven Colony. She was educated partly at New Haven and partly at Litchfield, Connecticut. The schools for young ladies in both of those towns at that time were celebrated for their excellence, and that in New Haven particularly comprehended a course of study equal in range, with the exception of Greek and the higher Mathematics, to the course pursued at the same time in Yale College. Being the youngest child of a wealthy and retired merchant, she enjoyed to the fullest extent the opportunities of education which these seminaries afforded, as well as that more general, but not less important element of education, the constant intercourse with people of refined taste and cultivated minds. Career In 1817, she married Cornelius Tuthill (1795‚Äì1825), a lawyer of Newburgh, New York who, after his marriage, settled in New Haven. Cornelius himself, as well as his wife, being of a literary turn, their hospitable mansion became the resort for quite an extensive literary circle, some of whom became famous. Mrs. Tuthill wrote rhymes from childhood, and as far back as she can remember was devoted to books. One of her amusements during girlhood was to write, stealthily, essays, plays, tales, and verses, all of which, however, with the exception of two or three school compositions, were committed to the flames previous to her marriage. She had imbibed a strong prejudice against literary women, and firmly resolved never to become one. Mr. Tuthill took a different view of the matter, and urged her to a further pursuit of liberal studies and the continued exercise of her pen. At his solicitation, she wrote regularly for The Microscope during its continuance, which, however, was only for a couple of years. Mr. Tuthill died in 1825, at the age of twenty-nine, leaving a widow and four children, one son and three daughters. As a solace under affliction, Mrs. Tuthill employed her pen in contributing frequently to literary periodicals, but always anonymously, and with so little regard to fame of authorship as to keep neither record nor copy of her pieces. Several little books, too, were written by her between 1827 and 1839, for the pleasure of mental occupation, and published anonymously. Some of these held their place in Sunday school libraries. Tuthill removed to Hartford, Connecticut in 1839, to be with her son, Charles Henry Tuthill (1818‚Äì1850), then studying law with Governor William W. Ellsworth. Her name first came before the public in that year. It was on the title-page of a reading book for young ladies, prepared on a new plan. The plan was to make the selections a series of illustrations of the rules of rhetoric, the examples selected being taken from the best English and American authors. The Young Ladies' Reader, the title of this collection, was popular, and went through many editions. Thereafter, she began to publish more freely, and during the same year, published The Young Lady‚Äôs Home. It was an octavo volume of tales and essays, having in view the completion of a young lady's education after her leaving school. It shows at once a fertile imagination and varied reading, sound judgment, and a familiar acquaintance with social life. It was frequently reprinted. Her next publication was a series of small volumes for boys and girls, which were, of all her writings, the most widely and the most favourably known. They are sextodecimos, of about 150 pages each. I will be a Gentleman, 1844, twenty editions; I will be a Lady, 1844, twenty editions; Onward, right Onward, 1845, ten editions; Boarding School Girl, 1845, six editions; Anything for Sport, 1846, eight editions; A Strike for Freedom, or, Law and Order, 1850, three editions in the first year. They have the graces of style and thought which would commend them to the favourable consideration of the general reader, with charms that made them the delight of children. During the composition of these juvenile works, she continued her occupation of catering for \\"children of a larger growth\\", and gave to the world, in 1846, a work of fiction, entitled My Wife, a tale of fashionable life of the present day, conveying, under the garb of an agreeable story, wholesome counsels for the young of both sexes on the all-engrossing subject of marriage. A love for the fine arts was one of the ruling passions of her life. At different times, ample means were within her reach for the cultivation of this class of studies. Partly for her own amusement, and partly for the instruction of her children, she paid special attention to the study of architecture in its aesthetical character, enjoying, while thus engaged, the free use of the library of Ithiel Town, the architect. The result of these studies was the publication, in 1848, of an octavo volume on the History of Architecture. She edited, during the same year, a very elegant octavo annual, The Mirror of Life, in which several of the contributions were by herself. In 1843, she removed to Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts; and in 1847, to Philadelphia. The Nursery Book appeared in 1849. It was not a collection of nursery rhymes for children, as the title led many to suppose, but a collection of counsels for young mothers respecting the duties of the nursery. These counsels were conveyed under the fiction of an imaginary correspondence between a young mother, just beginning to dress her first baby, and an experienced aunt. There are few topics in the whole history of the management and the mismanagement of a child, during the first and most important stages of its existence, that are not discussed, with alternate reason and ridicule, in this volume. Tuthill engaged upon a series of works grouped together under the general title of Success in Life. They are six volumes, 18mo.'s, of about 200 pages each, and each illustrating the method of success in some particular walk in life, by numerous biographical examples. The titles of the several volumes are: The Merchant, 1849; The Lawyer, 1850; The Mechanic, 1850; The Artist, The Farmer, and The Physician. In 1851 she was established at Princeton, New Jersey. She died June 1, 1879, and was buried at Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven.

Crook, M.D. It is spuriously claimed that chronic yeast infections are responsible for many common disorders and non-specific symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, asthma, and others. Background Candida albicans is a fungus that colonizes a large majority of the population (meaning it is present in the body but not causing an infection or any problems). Under certain conditions, however, it can cause an infection. The most common manifestations are thrush (a superficial Candida infection in the mouth) and vaginitis, also commonly referred to as a yeast infection. Candida can also cause serious systemic infection, but this is almost always restricted to those with compromised immune systems, such as patients undergoing chemotherapy or with advanced AIDS. Symptoms After reading publications by C. Orian Truss, M.D., Crook proposed the idea that a condition he termed systemic candidiasis, or Candida hypersensitivity, was responsible for a long list of common conditions and non-specific symptoms including fatigue, asthma, psoriasis, sexual dysfunction, and many others. The list of symptoms is similar to that of multiple chemical sensitivity. Many patients presenting with symptoms of environmental sensitivity claim to suffer from multiple \\"fashionable\\" syndromes. Criticism The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology strongly criticized the concept of \\"candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome\\" and the diagnostic and treatment approaches its proponents use. AAAAI's position statement concludes: (1) the concept of candidiasis hypersensitivity is speculative and unproven; (2) its basic elements would apply to almost all sick patients at some time because its supposed symptoms are essentially universal; (3) overuse of oral antifungal agents could lead to the development of resistant germs that could menace others; (4) adverse effects of oral antifungal agents are rare, but some inevitably will occur; and (5) neither patients nor doctors can determine effectiveness (as opposed to coincidence) without controlled trials. Because allergic symptoms can be influenced by many factors, including emotions, experiments must be designed to separate the effects of the procedure being tested from the effects of other factors. By 2005, scientists were taking note of \\"a large pseudoscientific cult\\" that had developed around the topic of yeast infections, with claims that up to one in three people were affected by yeast-related illnesses including Candida hypersensitivity. Legal action Some practitioners of alternative medicine have promoted dietary supplements as supposed cures for this non-existent illness, rendering themselves liable to prosecution. In 1990, alternative health vendor Nature's Way signed a FTC consent agreement not to misrepresent in advertising any self-diagnostic test concerning yeast conditions or to make any unsubstantiated representation concerning any food or supplement's ability to control yeast conditions, with a fine of US$30,000 payable to the National Institutes of Health for research in genuine candidiasis.

The fire burned a total of 13,023 acres. It was started by a lightning strike on the morning of June 28, 2018. The fire grew substantially to about 11,000 acres by July 5. The containment of the fire increased from 10% on July 5 to 93% on July 14. The remaining fire burn area was inside the Buffalo Peaks Wilderness and was contained by using land features, bucket drops and deployment of ground firefighting resources directly to hotspots. The United States Forest Service warned residents that smoke from the spot fires could be visible throughout the rest of the summer. A tornado caused a Kansas Forest Service crew as well as other crews in the area to cease firefighting efforts.  Incidents  On July 5, 2018, a rare high elevation tornado was reported on the edge of the fire. It forced firefighters off their line in fighting the fire.  Closures  U.S. Highway 285 between Fairplay and Antero and Weston Pass Road (County Road 22) was closed as a result of the fire. It later reopened on July 7, 2018. The entire Buffalo Peaks Wilderness area was also closed after the fire entered the wilderness perimeter. As of July 22, the wilderness was mostly reopened outside of a section where hotspot fires were burning.  Evacuations  Evacuations were issued for the Black Mountain and Thousand Peaks subdivisions as well as for the Campground of the Rockies Association.

He has specialized in the study of adolescent sexuality and homosexuality. He has opposed civil rights for homosexuals and the ordination of homosexuals to the Catholic priesthood. He holds appointments as an advisor to departments of the Roman Curia and has been called the \\"psy de l'√âglise‚Äù, roughly \\"Church shrink\\". Biography As of 1990, Anatrella taught clinical psychology at several training centers in France, conducted research at the social psychology laboratory of the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes, and was a member of the AIDS experts group of the French Health Education Committee. With the development of the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic Church, he helped create the first guide for French bishop Lutter contre la p√©dophilie (Fighting pedophilia) in 2000. In 2005 he was one of the advisors behind the Vatican's prohibition on the ordination of homosexuals to the priesthood. In an analysis of the Vatican action he wrote for L'Osservatore Romano, he also said that a homosexual cannot embody the \\"spousal tie\\" between God and the Church, nor embody a priest's \\"spiritual paternity\\". He listed the problematic characteristics of the homosexual: \\"Closing oneself off in a clan of persons of the same type; exaggerated affective choices; [becoming] a narcissistic position in front of a community that [the gay priest] disturbs even to the point of dividing it; a mode of vocational discernment that seeks candidates in his own image; relations with authority based on seduction and rejection;... an often limited vision of truth and a selective way of presenting the Gospel message; particularly in the areas of sexual and conjugal morality, these are habitually zones of relational and intellectual confusion and ideological combat, disapproved by a correct search for truth and the wisdom of God.\\" In 2006 he told a conference on homosexuality at the Pontifical Lateran University that 40% of children raised by homosexuals become homosexuals. The Catholic News Service reported that the audience \\"chuckled\\" in response. He was appointed a consultant to two bodies of the Roman Curia, the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers. He participated as a \\"collaborator\\" in the Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2014. A critic of the Synod's advice that homosexuals needed to be accompanied with respect, cited Anatrella's recemt statement: \\"We must clear the field of many clich√©s: homosexuality ... has no genetic, biological or neurological origin. Its origin is principally psychological. Today a lot of false research and many experiments have failed to demonstrate its origin is hormonal\\". Views In 2009 he warned that the Western ideology of \\"gender theory\\" was being imposed on African nations, that \\"to receive international aid ‚Äî in the financial, health and educational realms ‚Äî most African countries are subjected, through different associations, to the gender lecture\\". He has said that gender theory, the idea that gender identity is socially constructed, is \\"more damaging than Marxist ideology\\". He views homosexuality as \\"an incomplete and immature formation of human sexuality\\". In 2010 he was named a member of the commission of inquiry examining the apparitions of the Virgin Mary at Medjugorje. In 2013, he opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage in France, which he said was promoted by \\"a lobby that reduces the family to what it isn't\\" supported by those \\"wishing to play Daddy and Mommy without having the appropriate characteristics\\". He said that \\"the confusion of sex and feelings leads to a confusion of the realities and an impasse. Marriage between persons of the same sex is simply ridiculous and the act doesn't inspire any esteem as it doesn't contribute at all to social relation.\\" In February 2016, after it was reported that Anatrella, in the course of a Vatican-sponsored training session for new bishops, had said they had no obligation to report instances of abuse to civil authorities, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, head of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, insisted that the training session his Commission leads for new bishops rejects that view: \\"Our obligations under civil law must certainly be followed, but even beyond these civil requirements, we all have a moral and ethical responsibility to report suspected abuse to the civil authorities who are charged with protecting our society.\\" Allegations of abuse Accusations that Anatrella had abused patients in the course of therapy sessions were first raised by three of them in 2006, but their civil suit was dismissed for lack of evidence beyond that of accusers and the accused. Accusations were renewed in 2016, and this time church officials who had previously defended Anatrella issued a statement encouraging \\"any person who has been a victim of sexual aggression\\" to contact the archdiocese to report it: \\"They will be received and listened to, counseled on what to do next, and urged to file a complaint with the judicial authorities.\\" Four former patients of Anatrella described therapy sessions that involved nudity and bodily contact. Investigative journalists found that Anatrella had used such methods since the 1970s and as late as 2011. The courses Anatrella taught at the Coll√®ge des Bernardins in Paris were suspended in 2016 and an invitation to speak at a conference organized by the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family in February 2017 was withdrawn. In October 2017, the Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, initiated a canonical investigation of charges made against Anatrella. In a statement to Agence France Presse on 4 July 2018, the Archdiocese announced that Anatrella was forbidden to exercise his priestly ministry, hear confessions, or provide spiritual direction. Aupetit also repeated an earlier prohibition first made by predecessor, Cardinal Andr√© Vingt-Trois, that Anatrella provide therapeutic services. The church sanction indicated that the investigation had determined that there was serious evidence of a crime. √âric de Moulins-Beaufort Auxiliary Bishop of Paris, conducted the investigation's interviews with patients who charged Anatrella had molested them in the course of therapy sessions designed to cure them of homosexuality, and reported his findings to Aupetit in mid-May. When these sanctions were announced in 2018, Anatrella had already ceased pastoral activity for several years but continued his work as a therapist.

It is based on the 1983 novel Amos: To Ride a Dead Horse by Stanley Gordon West. The film stars Kirk Douglas, Elizabeth Montgomery, Dorothy McGuire, Pat Morita, James Sloyan and Ray Walston. The film premiered on CBS on September 29, 1985. Plot The opening of the start of the movie reveals a couple having breakfast, then going on a road trip or outing, when suddenly Amos (Kirk Douglas), who was driving, and his wife are involved in a major accident that claims the life of his wife and severely injures Amos. He wakes up in a hospital, to realize that his wife died as a result of the accident and his home has been sold. Amos is sent to the Sunset Nursing Home. There he meets an old baseball friend and gets in a relationship with a female resident. The head nurse, Daisy Daws (Elizabeth Montgomery), is notorious for running the facility with strict rules that are enforced by Roland, an orderly (male CNA). Daisy also has an affair with the local Sheriff so none of the residents dares to complain about her. Even when a County Commissioner, Burt, pays a surprise visit he is only told good things about the facility and Daisy. One night, Daisy administers an overdose of a barbiturates to Amos' roommate, while Amos pretends to be sleeping, he watches it happen and can't do anything about it. Later, after the remains are picked up by morticians, Amos questions Daisy of why she did that and she threatens to do the same to him unless he puts his life insurance policy in her name. Amos grandson pays him a visit in the nursing home and offers to let Amos come with him and live in his home but Amos does not want to abandon his friends in the nursing home. Amos then sneaks into Daisy's bedroom to steal a syringe, needle, and the barbiturates which were used to euthanize her residents. He picks a fight with Roland so that he suffers bruises and other skin injuries, injects himself with the barbiturates and is found dead the next morning. Just before he administered his own lethal injection, he had written a letter to the state that Daisy forced him to put his life insurance on her name, that he fears she will kill him and that if he dies an autopsy should be performed and that the benefits from his life insurance policy should be shared between his grandson and Lydia, his girlfriend at the nursing home. Faced with the letter that Amos wrote and the results of the autopsy (which reveals \\"enough barbiturates to kill seven people\\"), the Sheriff arrests Daisy (despite her screams and threats to expose the Sheriff's infidelity).

The Valdivia earthquake, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, occurred on 22 May 1960. With over 50,000 casualties and more than 2 million people affected, the earthquake forced the organising committee to completely modify the World Cup's calendar. Talca, Concepci√≥n, Talcahuano and Valdivia were severely damaged and discarded as venues. Antofagasta and Valpara√≠so declined to host any matches as their venues were not financially self-sustainable. Vi√±a del Mar and Arica managed to rebuild their stadiums while Braden Copper Company, then an American company that controlled the El Teniente copper mine, allowed the use of its stadium in Rancagua. The most used stadium was the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, with 10 matches; the Estadio Sausalito in Vi√±a del Mar hosted 8 matches, and the stadiums in Rancagua and far-away Arica (the only location that was not close to the other cities) both hosted 7 matches. Being largely concerned with the build-up of the country after the 1960 earthquake, government support for the tournament was minimal. {  - ! rowspan=10  ! Santiago !

The newest and biggest venue used was Wembley Stadium in west London, which was 43 years old in 1966. As was often the case in the World Cup, group matches were played in two venues in close proximity to each other. Group 1 matches (which included the hosts) were all played in London: five at Wembley, which was England's national stadium and was considered to be the most important football venue in the world; and one at White City Stadium in west London, which was used as a temporary replacement for nearby Wembley. The group stage match between Uruguay and France played at White City Stadium (originally built for the 1908 Summer Olympics) was scheduled for a Friday, the same day as regularly scheduled greyhound racing at Wembley. Because Wembley's owner refused to cancel this, the game had to be moved to the alternative venue in London. Group 2's matches were played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield and Villa Park in Birmingham; Group 3's matches were played at Old Trafford in Manchester and Goodison Park in Liverpool; and Group 4's matches were played at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough and Roker Park in Sunderland. The most used venue was Wembley, which was used for nine matches, including all six featuring England, the final and the third-place match. Goodison Park was used for five matches, Roker Park and Hillsborough both hosted four, while Old Trafford, Villa Park and Ayresome Park each hosted three matches and did not host any knockout round matches. { - rowspan=8 !colspan=2London!!Manchester!!Birmingham - Wembley StadiumWhite City StadiumOld TraffordVilla Park - Capacity: 98,600Capacity: 76,567Capacity: 58,000Capacity: 52,000 - 150px150px150px150px - !Sheffield!!Sunderland!!Middlesbrough!!Liverpool - Hillsborough StadiumRoker ParkAyresome ParkGoodison Park - Capacity: 42,730Capacity: 40,310Capacity: 40,000Capacity: 50,151 - 150px150px150px150px }  1970  Five stadiums in five cities were selected to host the World Cup matches. Alternative venues in Hidalgo state and the port city of Veracruz were also considered. Each group was based solely in one city with exception of Group 2, which was staged in both Puebla and Toluca. Aside from the Estadio Luis Dosal, all the stadia had only been constructed during the 1960s, as Mexico prepared to host both the World Cup and the 1968 Summer Olympics. The altitude of the venues varied and the importance of acclimatisation was strongly considered by all the participating teams. As a result, in contrast to the previous tournament staged in England, most teams arrived in the region well in advance of their opening fixtures to prepare for this factor. Some teams had already experienced the local conditions when competing in the football competition at 1968 Summer Olympics. At an elevation in excess of above sea level, Toluca was the highest of the venues; Guadalajara was the lowest at . Of the five stadia used for the 32 matches played, the largest and most used venue was the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City; which hosted ten total matches including the final and third place matches, and all of Group 1's matches (which included all of host Mexico's matches). The Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara hosted eight matches including all of Group 3's matches and a semi-final. The Nou Camp Stadium in Leon hosted seven matches, which consisted of all of Group 4's matches and a quarter-final match. The Luis Dosal stadium in Toluca hosted four matches, and Cuauht√©moc stadium in Puebla hosted three matches and was the only stadium of the five used for this tournament not to host any knockout rounds. {  center;\\" rowspan=\\"8\\" ! colspan=2Mexico City !

The Carreras Stadium in Cordoba hosted 8 matches, the stadiums in Mendoza, Rosario and Mar del Plata each hosted 6 matches and the Jos√© Amalfitani Stadium in Buenos Aires hosted 3 matches. The Minella stadium in Mar del Plata was heavily criticised due to its terrible pitch, which was deemed \\"nearly unplayable\\"; whereas the Amalfitani stadium in Buenos Aires, the least used stadium for this tournament, was praised for its very good pitch. Brazil was forced by tournament organizers to play all three of its first group matches in Mar del Plata. {  - ! rowspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"\\" !colspan=2 Buenos Aires !

The most used stadium was FC Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium which hosted 5 matches including a semi-final match; it was the largest stadium used for this tournament. In addition to Barcelona's Sarria Stadium hosting 3 total matches, Barcelona was the Spanish city with the most matches in Espana '82 with 8; the Spanish capital of Madrid followed with 7. This particular World Cup was organised in such a way where all of the matches of each of the six groups of four were assigned stadiums in cities close in proximity to each other; reducing the stress of travel on the players and fans. For example: Group 1 only played in Vigo and A Coru√±a, Group 2 only played in Gijon and Oviedo, Group 3 only played in Elche and Alicante (except for the first match, which was the opening match of the tournament, which was played at the Camp Nou), Group 4 played only in Bilbao and Valladolid (England played all their first round group matches in Bilbao), Group 5 (which included hosts Spain) was played exclusively in Valencia and Zaragoza, and Group 6 played exclusively in Seville and Malaga (of the 3 1st round matches in Seville, the first match between Brazil and the USSR was played in the Pizjuan Stadium, and the other two were played in the Villamarin Stadium). When the tournament went into the round-robin second round matches, all the aforementioned cities excluding Barcelona, Alicante and Seville did not host any more matches in Espana '82. Both the Santiago Bernabeu and Vicente Calderon stadiums in Madrid and the Sarria Stadium in Barcelona were used for the first time for this tournament for the second round matches. Madrid and Barcelona hosted the four second round group matches; Barcelona hosted Groups A and C (Camp Nou hosted all 3 of Group A's matches, and Sarria did the same with Group C's matches) and Madrid hosted Groups B and D (Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium hosted all 3 of Group B's matches, and Atl√©tico Madrid's Calderon Stadium did the same with the Group D matches) The two semi final matches were held at Camp Nou and the Pizjuan Stadium in Seville, the third largest stadium used for the tournament (one of only 2 Espana '82 matches it hosted), the third place match was held in Alicante and the final was held at the Bernabeu, the second largest stadium used for this tournament. Spain's hot summer climate was avoided by playing most matches in the late afternoon or at night; for instance Seville- which is one of the hottest cities in Europe, with June and July average temperatures going past the 90s Fahrenheit (32 Celsius)- could only play its matches at 21:00. During the group stages, all the southern coastal cities with their hot summer weather saw all their matches start at 21:00 local time; and the northern cities with their cooler weather had their matches start at 17:15 local time. {  center;\\" - rowspan=\\"8\\" colspan=\\"2\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"Madrid ! colspan=\\"2\\"Barcelona !

The Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, the largest stadium used for the tournament, hosted 9 matches (including the final), more than any other stadium used. Mexico City hosted 13 total matches; the Olimpico Universitario Stadium hosted 4 matches (if the Mexico City suburban town Nezahualcoyotl's matches are included, this brings the total up to 16 matches). The Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara hosted 7 matches, and the Cuauht√©moc Stadium in Puebla hosted 5 matches. The hot and rainy summer weather in Mexico varied from desert locations like Monterrey to tropical locations such as Guadalajara; but perhaps the greatest hardship the players had to contend with was the high altitude of the Mexican locations. With the exception of Monterrey (still 2,000 feet above sea level), all of the stadia were located in cities that varied anywhere from Guadalajara being 5,138 feet (1,566 meters) above sea level to Toluca being 8,730 feet (2,661 m) above sea level- making conditions very difficult for the players running around in these stadia. Mexico City, the location of the final match and the location where the most matches were played was 7,380 feet (2,250 m) above sea level. {  - colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"12\\" 1\\\\. Mexico City, 2.

Group A only played at the Olimpico and in Puebla (except for the Bulgaria-Italy opening tournament match, which was played in the Azteca), Group B only played at the Azteca and in Toluca (hosts Mexico were part of this group; they played all their group stage matches at the Azteca), Group C played in Le√≥n and Irapuato, Group D only played in Guadalajara (including the Guadalajara area town of Zapopan; the last match of this group was played in Monterrey), Group E exclusively played in Quer√©taro and Nezahualc√≥yotl, and Group F played in the northern city of Monterrey (including the Monterrey area town of San Nicolas de los Garza; the last match of this group was played in Guadalajara). All of the venues listed hosted knockout round matches except the ones in Nezahualcoyotl, Irapuato, Zapopan, Toluca and the Estadio Tecnologico in Monterrey.  1990  Twelve stadiums were selected to host the World Cup matches in twelve different cities. The Stadio San Nicola in Bari and Turin's Stadio delle Alpi were completely new venues opened for the World Cup. The remaining ten venues all underwent extensive programmes of improvements in preparation for the tournament, forcing many of the club tenants of the stadia to move to temporary homes. Additional seating and roofs were added to most stadia, with further redevelopments seeing running tracks removed and new pitches laid. Due to structural constraints, several of the existing stadia had to be virtually rebuilt to implement the changes required. Like Espana '82, the group stage of this tournament was organised in such a way where specific groups only played in two cities close in proximity to each other. Group A only played in Rome and Florence (Hosts Italy played all their competitive matches in Rome, except for their semi-final and third place matches, which were played in Naples and Bari, respectively), Group B played their matches in Naples and Bari (except for Argentina vs. Cameroon, which was the opening match of the tournament, played in Milan), Group C played their matches in Turin and Genoa, Group D played all their matches in Milan and Bologna, Group E played only in Udine and Verona, and Group F played on the island cities of Cagliari and Palermo. The cities that hosted the most World Cup matches were the two biggest cities in Italy: Rome and Milan, each hosting six matches, and Bari, Naples and Turin each hosted five matches. Cagliari, Udine and Palermo were the only cities of the 12 selected that did not host any knockout round matches. All matches, typical of a World Cup in Europe were played in the late afternoon or the evening to avoid the intense heat of an Italian summer. The England national team, at the British government's request, were forced to play all their matches in Cagliari on the island of Sardinia. Hooliganism, rife in English football in the 1980s, had followed the national team while they played friendlies on the European continent ‚Äì the distrust of English fans was so high that the English FA's reputation and even diplomatic relations between the UK and Italy were seen to be at risk if England played any group stage matches on the Italian mainland. Thanks largely to British Sports Minister Colin Moynihan's negative remarks about English fans weeks before the match, security around Cagliari during England's three matches there was extremely heavy ‚Äì in addition to 7,000 local police and Carabineri, highly trained Italian military special forces were also there patrolling the premises. The Italian authorities' heavy presence proved to be justified as there were several riots during the time England were playing their matches in Cagliari, leading to a number of injuries, arrests and even deportations.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/17/sports/world-cup-90-fan- violence-at-world-cup- finals.htmlhttps://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-11/sports/sp-210_1_riot-police Most of the construction cost in excess of their original estimates and total costs ended up being over ¬£550 million (approximately $935 million). Rome's Stadio Olimpico which would host the final was the most expensive project overall, while Udine's Stadio Friuli, the newest of the existing stadia (opened 14 years prior), cost the least to redevelop. {  - ! rowspan=15  !

All stadiums had a capacity of at least 53,000, and their usual tenants were professional or college American football teams. The venue used most was the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, with eight games, among them one round of 16 match, a semi-final, the third-place game, and the final. The least used was the Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit, the first indoor stadium used in a World Cup, with four group stage games. The Pontiac Silverdome was also the only venue of the 9 used that did not host any knockout round matches. Because of the large area of the continental United States, the match locations were often far apart. Some teams in Groups A and B had to travel from Los Angeles or San Francisco all the way to Detroit and back again, covering 2,300 mi (3,680 km) and three time zones one way. The teams in Groups C and D only played in Foxborough (Boston), Chicago and Dallas ‚Äì a trip from Boston to Dallas is 2,000 miles (3,200 km), but only covers one time zone; Chicago is in the same time zone as Dallas but is still 1,000 miles (1,600 km) away from both Dallas and Boston. The teams in Groups E and F's travel was a bit easier ‚Äì they played exclusively in East Rutherford (New York City), Washington and Orlando. A few teams such as Cameroon and Italy did not have to travel great distances to cities to play matches. The variety of climate in different cities all over the United States made playing conditions challenging; aside from the oceanic coolness of Boston (Foxborough), the Mediterranean climate of San Francisco (Stanford) and occasionally the coolness of Chicago, most matches were played in very hot and/or humid conditions. Although playing in the sometimes triple-digit dry heat and smoggy conditions of Los Angeles (Pasadena) and the intense mixture of heat and humidity of Washington and New York City (East Rutherford) proved to be difficult, the cities with the most oppressive conditions were the southern cities of Orlando and Dallas because of the combination of triple-digit heat and extreme humidity. The Floridian tropical climate of Orlando meant all matches there were played in temperatures of or above with humidity at 70% or more (the temperature there during the group stage match between Mexico and Ireland was ) thanks to the mid-day start times. Dallas was not much different: in the semi-arid heat of a Texas summer, temperatures exceeded during mid-day, when matches there were staged in the open-type Cotton Bowl meant that conditions were just as oppressive there as they were in Orlando. Detroit also proved to be difficult: the Pontiac Silverdome did not have a working cooling system and because it was an interior dome-shaped stadium, the air could not escape through circulation, so temperatures inside the stadium would climb past with 40% humidity. United States midfielder Thomas Dooley described the Silverdome as \\"the worst place I have ever played at\\". {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" -  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"12\\" !

When the finals were originally awarded in July 1992, none of the regional club grounds were of a capacity meeting FIFA's requirements ‚Äì namely being able to safely seat 40,000. The proposed national stadium, colloquially referred to as the 'Grand stade' met with controversy at every stage of planning; the stadium's location was determined by politics, finance and national symbolism. As Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac successfully negotiated a deal with Prime Minister √âdouard Balladur to bring the Stade de France ‚Äì as it was named now, to the commune of Saint-Denis just north of the capital city. Construction on the stadium started in December 1995 and was completed after 26 months of work in November 1997 at a cost of ‚Ç£2.67 billion. The choice of stadium locations was drafted from an original list of 14 cities. FIFA and CFO monitored the progress and quality of preparations, culminating in the former providing final checks of the grounds weeks before the tournament commenced. Montpellier was the surprise inclusion from the final list of cities because of its low urban hierarchy in comparison to Strasbourg, who boasted a better hierarchy and success from its local football team, having been taken over by a consortium. Montpellier however was considered ambitious by the selecting panel to host World Cup matches. The local city and regional authories in particular had invested heavily into football the previous two decades and were able to measure economic effects, in terms of jobs as early as in 1997. Some of the venues used for this tournament were also used for the previous World Cup in France in 1938. The Stade V√©lodrome in Marseille, the Parc Lescure in Bordeaux and the Parc des Princes in Paris received the honour of hosting World Cup matches once again in 1998 as they had all done in 1938. 10 stadiums in total were used for the finals; in addition to nine matches being played at the Stade de France (the most used stadium in the tournament), a further six matches took place in Paris Saint-Germain's Parc des Princes, bringing Paris's total matches hosted to 15. France played four of their seven matches in the national stadium; they also played in the country's second and third largest cities, Marseille (hosting 7 total matches) and Lyon (hosting 6 total matches), as well as a Round of 16 knockout match in the northern city of Lens (also hosting 6 total matches). Nantes, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Montpellier and Saint-Etienne also hosted 6 matches in total; all of the stadiums used also hosted knockout round matches. {  -  colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"5\\" !

Groups A-D played all their matches in South Korea, and Groups E-H played all their matches in Japan. The stadiums in Daegu, Suwon, Yokohama and Saitama all hosted 4 matches each, while the other 16 stadiums hosted 3 matches each.

The still-standing Olympiastadion in Munich (69,250) was not used for the tournament, even though FIFA's regulations allow one city to use two stadia. D√ºsseldorf's LTU Arena (51,500), Bremen's Weserstadion (43,000) and M√∂nchengladbach's Borussia-Park (46,249) were also not used. Twelve stadia were selected to host the World Cup matches. During the tournament, many of them were known by different names, as FIFA prohibits sponsorship of stadia unless the stadium sponsors are also official FIFA sponsors. For example, the Allianz Arena in Munich was known during the competition as FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich (), and even the letters of the company Allianz were removed or covered. Some of the stadia also had a lower capacity for the World Cup, as FIFA regulations ban standing room; nonetheless, this was accommodated as several stadia had a UEFA five- star ranking. The stadia in Berlin, Munich, Dortmund and Stuttgart hosted six matches each, while the other eight stadia hosted five matches each. {  center;\\" - colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"6\\" !Berlin !Dortmund !Munich !Stuttgart !Gelsenkirchen - rowspan=\\"2\\"Olympiastadion Westfalenstadion Allianz Arena rowspan=\\"2\\"Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion Arena AufSchalke - '''''' '''''' '''''' -      - Capacity: 72,000 Capacity: 65,000 Capacity: 66,000 Capacity: 52,000 Capacity: 52,000 - 150px 150px 150px 150px 150px - !Hamburg !Frankfurt !Cologne !Hanover !Leipzig !Kaiserslautern !Nuremberg - Volksparkstadion Commerzbank-Arena RheinEnergieStadion Niedersachsenstadion rowspan=\\"2\\"Zentralstadion rowspan=\\"2\\"Fritz-Walter- Stadion Max-Morlock-Stadion - '''''' '''''' '''''' '''''' '''''' -        - Capacity: 50,000 Capacity: 48,000 Capacity: 45,000 Capacity: 43,000 Capacity: 43,000 Capacity: 46,000 Capacity: 41,000 - 150px 150px 150px 150px 150px 150px 150px }  2010  In 2005, the organisers released a provisional list of 13 venues to be used for the World Cup: Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg (two venues), Kimberley, Klerksdorp, Nelspruit, Orkney, Polokwane, Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, and Rustenburg. This was narrowed down to the ten venues that were officially announced by FIFA on 17 March 2006. The altitude of several venues affected the motion of the ball and player performance, although FIFA's medical chief downplayed this consideration. Six of the ten venues were over 1200m above sea level, with the two Johannesburg venues ‚Äì the FNB Stadium (also known as Soccer City) and Ellis Park Stadium ‚Äì the highest at approximately 1750m. The FNB Stadium, the Cape Town Stadium and the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth were the most-used venues, each hosting eight matches. Ellis Park Stadium and the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban hosted seven matches each, while the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein and the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg hosted six matches each. The Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane and the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit hosted four matches each, but did not host any knockout-stage matches. {  - !rowspan=5 colspan=2 !colspan=2 Johannesburg !width=25% Cape Town !width=25% Durban -  FNB Stadium  Ellis Park Stadium  Cape Town Stadium  Moses Mabhida Stadium -     -  Capacity: 84,490  Capacity: 55,686  Capacity: 64,100  Capacity: 62,760 -  150px  150px  150px  150px - !

The venues covered all the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 finals in Brazil. Consequently, the tournament required long-distance travel for teams. During the World Cup, Brazilian cities were also home to the participating teams at 32 separate base camps, as well as staging official fan fests where supporters could view the games. The most used stadiums were the Maracana and Brasilia, which hosted 7 matches each. S√£o Paulo, Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte and Salvador hosted 6 matches each, Porto Alegre and Recife hosted 5 matches each, and Cuiaba, Manaus, Natal and Curitiba hosted 4 matches each and being the 4 smallest stadiums used, the 4 aforementioned cities did not host any knockout rounds. {  - !rowspan=\\"4\\" colspan=\\"2\\" !Rio de Janeiro !Bras√≠lia !S√£o Paulo !Fortaleza !Belo Horizonte - Est√°dio do Maracan√£ Est√°dio Nacional Arena de S√£o Paulo Est√°dio Castel√£o Est√°dio Mineir√£o - Capacity: 74,738 Capacity: 69,432 Capacity: 63,321 Capacity: 60,348 Capacity: 58,259 - 150px 150px 150px 150px 150px - !Salvador !Porto Alegre !Recife !Cuiab√° !Manaus !Natal !Curitiba - Arena Fonte Nova Est√°dio Beira-Rio Arena Pernambuco Arena Pantanal Arena da Amaz√¥nia Arena das Dunas Arena da Baixada - Capacity: 51,708 Capacity: 43,394 Capacity: 42,583 Capacity: 41,112 Capacity: 40,549 Capacity: 39,971 Capacity: 39,631 - 150px 150px 150px 150px 150px 150px 150px }  2018  A total of twelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities have been built and renovated for the FIFA World Cup. * Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium.

The stadiums aim to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to , and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure. The country intends for the stadiums to reflect the historical and cultural aspects of Qatar. Each stadium will incorporate four priorities, which are legacy, comfort, accessibility and sustainability. Qatar aims to build the stadiums with the highest sustainability and environmental standards. The stadiums will be equipped with cooling systems that are environmentally friendly overcoming the challenging environmental nature of the country. The plan is to build Zero Waste stadiums using environmentally friendly materials, harmless equipment, and ecologically sustainable solutions through the implementation of renewable and low energy solutions. Qatar aspires to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for all the world cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched have been designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners. Leading football clubs in Europe wanted the World Cup to take place from 28 April to 29 May rather than the typical June and July staging, due to concerns about the heat. A report released on 9 December 2010 quoted FIFA President Sepp Blatter as stating that other nations could host some matches during the World Cup. However, no specific countries were named in the report. Blatter added that any such decision must be taken by Qatar first and then endorsed by FIFA's executive committee. Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan told the Australian Associated Press that holding games in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and possibly Saudi Arabia would help to incorporate the people of the region during the tournament. According to a report released in April 2013 by Merrill Lynch, the investment banking division of Bank of America, the organisers in Qatar have requested FIFA to approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs. Bloomberg.com said that Qatar wishes to cut the number of venues to eight or nine from the twelve originally planned. Although as of April 2017, FIFA had yet to finalise the number of stadiums Qatar must have ready in five years' time, Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said it expected there would be eight. In January 2019, Infantino said that FIFA was exploring the possibility of having neighbouring countries host matches during the tournament, in order to reduce political tensions. {  center;\\" - !Lusail !Al Khor !colspan=2Al Rayyan - Lusail Iconic Stadium Al Bayt Stadium Education City Stadium Al Rayyan Stadium - Capacity: 80,000 (under construction) Capacity: 60,000 (under construction) Capacity: 45,350 (under construction) Capacity: 44,740 (temporarily expanded) - 200px 200px 200px 200px - !rowspan=\\"1\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Host cities in Qatar !rowspan=\\"1\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Stadiums in Doha - !Al Wakrah !colspan=3Doha - Al Janoub Stadium Ras Abu Aboud Stadium Al Thumama Stadium Khalifa International Stadium - Capacity: 40,000 Capacity: 40,000 (under construction) Capacity: 40,000 (under construction) Capacity: 40,000 (upgraded) - 200px 200x200px   } References External links  * Classics Stadium at FIFA.com Category:FIFA World Cup stadiums ","title":"List of FIFA World Cup stadiums"},{"id":"57830982","text":"The 2017‚Äì18 Tanzania FA Cup (also called the Azam Sports Federation Cup) is the 3rd edition of the Tanzania FA Cup, the knockout football competition of Tanzania.

The entire Portlands had been a marsh, enclosed by the same large sandbar that formed the Toronto Islands. By the turn of the 20th century, the marsh had become polluted, and the city filled it with landfill, and devoted it to industrial purposes. Some of the early twentieth century landfill was also polluted, contaminated with heavy metals or toxic chemicals. The industrial enterprises were also polluting, including acres of petroleum tank farms and berms of road salt. The city had also canalized and straightened the lower reach of the Don River, so it flowed straight for from Bloor/Danforth to what is now Lake Shore Boulevard, where it made a right hand turn and ran west in what was called the Keating Channel. Early in the 21st century suggestions were made that attempts should be made to \\"naturalize\\" the mouth of the Don River. A second channel will be excavated. The second channel will have natural curves, and will have more natural banks, with natural plants that could provide habitat for migrating birds and wildlife. The second channel will empty into Toronto Harbour at what is now the Polson slip. The Keating Channel had mooring for multiple freighters. Plans for Villiers Island included adding more natural looking curves on the Keating Channel's southern bank. Plans show a greenbelt, and parkland, surrounding the developed center of the Island. Cherubini Group, a firm specializing in building bridges, located in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, has the contract to build seven bridges needed to connect Villiers Island. The first four are scheduled to be shipped to Toronto, by barge, in the fall of 2020.

The shaded regions show four of the 20 isosceles triangles formed by triples of these points. In discrete geometry, an isosceles set is a set of points with the property that every three of them form an isosceles triangle. More precisely, each three points should determine at most two distances; this also allows degenerate isosceles triangles formed by three equally-spaced points on a line. The problem of finding the largest isosceles set in a Euclidean space of a given dimension was posed in 1946 by Paul Erd≈ës. In his statement of the problem, Erd≈ës observed that the largest such set in the Euclidean plane has six points. In his 1947 solution, Leroy Milton Kelly showed more strongly that the unique six-point planar isosceles set consists of the vertices and center of a regular pentagon. In three dimensions, Kelly found an eight-point isosceles set, six points of which are the same; the remaining two points lie on a line perpendicular to the pentagon through its center, at the same distance as the pentagon vertices from the center. This three-dimensional example was later proven to be optimal, and to be the unique optimal solution. In d-dimensional space, an isosceles set can have at most :\\\\binom{d+2}{2} points. This is tight for d=6 and for d=8 but not necessarily for other dimensions. The maximum number of points in a d-dimensional isosceles set, for d=1,2,\\\\dots, 8, is known to be :3, 6, 8, 11, 17, 28, 30, 45 but these numbers are not known for higher dimensions. The same problem can also be considered for other metric spaces. For instance, for Hamming spaces, somewhat smaller upper bounds are known than for Euclidean spaces of the same dimension. In an ultrametric space, the whole space (and any of its subsets) is an isosceles set. Therefore, ultrametric spaces are sometimes called isosceles spaces. However, not every isosceles set is ultrametric; for instance, obtuse Euclidean isosceles triangles are not ultrametric.

Auflage. Domowina-Verlag, Bautzen 2000, .  Origin and Variants  Teschow is a habitational name from the former village (now district) of \\"Teschow\\" in the town of Teterow, or any one of several other places called \\"Teschow\\" in the Rostock district of the northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Teschow is originally a Pomeranian name as evidenced by the West Slavic suffix ending \\"-ow\\" (German \\"-au\\") which can be possessive meaning \\"of the,\\" or \\"belonging to,\\" or locational, meaning \\"place of.\\" This suffix is commonly found in surnames and place names throughout Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and is generally very common throughout northeastern Germany. Etymologically, the name Teschow likely means \\"place of comfort,\\" derived from a combination of the Pomeranian word \\"te≈°\\" (Germanized \\"Tesch\\") meaning \\"comfort\\" or \\"consolation\\" and the suffix \\"-ow.\\" A relatively rare surname, it is historically concentrated in the state in and around the district of Rostock, the municipalities of Stepenitztal and Selmsdorf in the district of Nordwestmecklenburg, and in and around the city of L√ºbeck in the neighboring state of Schleswig-Holstein. Until the gradual standardization of German spelling with the introduction of compulsory education in late 18th and early 19th centuries, many names displayed wide variations in spelling. In addition, as was quite common in earlier eras of mass migration, many immigrants either changed their surnames completely, or decided to use one of a number of various anglicized spellings of their original surnames, which further led to wide variations in the spelling and pronunciation of what was originally the same name. As such, different variations of surnames such as Teschow usually have the same origin.

It is a common, summer flowering species with dark green leaves with a white central vein and up to fifteen pale greenish flowers with a brownish red labellum with a network of darker veins. Description Cryptostylis ovata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which usually grows in colonies although only a few plants may flower in any one year. It has one to several egg-shaped leaves long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are dark green with a central white vein on the upper surface and purplish red below. This species is the only orchid in Western Australia to have leaves throughout the year. Between four and fifteen flowers long and wide are borne on a flower stem high. The sepals and petals are greenish yellow, the sepals long and wide and the petals shorter and narrower. The most prominent feature of the flower is its labellum which is long, wide when flattened, projects stiffly forwards and is reddish brown with a fine network of darker veins. Flowering occurs from November to February. Taxonomy and naming Cryptostylis ovata was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (ovata) is a Latin word meaning \\"egg-shaped\\", referring to the shape of the leaves. Distribution and habitat The slipper orchid is widespread and common in a wide range of habitats from coastal scrub to high rainfall forests. It is mainly found between Perth and Albany but sometimes further east, in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions.

He is also the co-chair of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) in the Philippine government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He previously served as the Representative of Davao City's 1st district from 2010 to 2018. He is an advocate of Education for All, a global movement that supports farmers and agriculture-related programs and gives more opportunities to provinces. In the 2016 Philippine presidential elections, Nograles was among those who encouraged then-Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte to run for President. He was a member of the National Unity Party (NUP) before joining PDP‚ÄìLaban in 2017. Early life and education Karlo Nograles was born on September 3, 1976 in Davao City to Prospero Nograles, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Rhodora Burgos Bendigo Nograles. He has three siblings. Nograles attended grade school in Ateneo de Davao University from 1983 to 1989, where he graduated valedictorian of his class. In high school, he was admitted to the Philippine Science High School Main Campus until 1993 where he finished with a C.A.T. Leadership Award. For college, he studied at the Ateneo de Manila University where he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science in Management Engineering degree. He then took a Juris Doctor degree in 2003 at the Ateneo de Manila Law School.  Political career  Nograles' career in politics began when he served as the Chief-of-Staff of his father who was then serving as the member of the House of Representatives. In 2010, he was elected as the representative of the 1st district of Davao City. He ran again in the 2013 elections and successfully won another term. In his second term as representative, he served as the Chairman of the House Committee on Labor and Employment. He served his third and final term in the 17th Congress, having ran unopposed during the 2016 elections. During this time, he served as the Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations. As chairman, Nograles was notable for allocating the budget for free higher education in accordance with the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act. In 2017, he allotted a total of ‚Ç±40 billion to fund free education for students enrolled in state universities and colleges (SUCs) for school year 2018‚Äì2019. Before 2017 ended, he appropriated P3.767 trillion for the 2018 national budget. Initially ridden with conflicting proposals with the Senate's version of the bill and budget cuts, the 'impasse' plaguing the proposed budget was resolved after a Bicameral Conference Committee meeting. In 2018, also as appropriations chair, he allocated a ‚Ç±25-billion budget for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) modernization program. This initiative covered the acquisition of brand new attack helicopters, tanks, and other military hardware. He also allotted funds amounting to ‚Ç±64.2 billion for the salary increase of military and uniformed personnel. In accordance with his Free Irrigation Law which was signed in February 2018, he allocated ‚Ç±2.6 billion for irrigation fee subsidies for 2018, which was higher than the ‚Ç±2 billion irrigation budget for 2017. Nograles was also the author of the Green Jobs Act, which granted special tax deductions and duty-free importation of capital equipment for companies that will help create employment that contributes to preserving or restoring the quality of the environment; the JobStart Philippines Act which enhanced opportunities and employment facilitation for Filipino youth through enhanced knowledge and skills acquisition through formal and technical education and a shortened school-to-work transition to increase chances of productive employment; and Republic Act No. 10741 that strengthened the National Labor Relations Commission.

He later managed non-league clubs Aveley, Tilbury and Walthamstow Avenue. Matthews played for Hackney and Middlesex Schools and joined West Ham United as a youth. He signed professional forms with the east London club in August 1952. He made his senior debut on 22 October 1953, a 5‚Äì1 defeat against Colchester United in the Essex Professional Cup, alongside fellow debutants Andy Malcolm and Fred Cooper. Matthews would have to wait two-and-a-half years for his league debut, a Second Division encounter against Blackburn Rovers on 17 March 1956. He scored the only West Ham goal of a 4‚Äì1 defeat. After nine league appearances for West Ham, his final game for the club came in the Essex Professional Cup, in a 3‚Äì1 win over Chelmsford City on 26 November 1956. He joined Aldershot in July 1957 and scored 20 goals in 62 appearances, before moving to Gillingham in August 1962. He scored one goal in 12 appearances for the Gills during the 1962‚Äì63 season. Matthews then moved to non-league Ashford Town where he was captain before injury curtailed his playing career. He went on to manage Aveley, and in 1974 moved to Tilbury, with Larry Hutson making a move in the opposite direction. At the end of the 1976‚Äì77 season, Matthews left for Walthamstow Avenue. Matthews, or Mr Matthews as he was known by us, was a PE Teacher at Clissold Park secondary school, N16. I attended that school in 1970 and he was in role then, but it's not known how long he remained. Weekly we would attend Snaresbrook sports fields where Matthews took football training, and was accompanied by another West Ham legend John Dick.

KiwiBuild is a real estate development scheme pursued by the Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand. It began in 2018, with the aim of building 100,000 homes by 2028 to increase housing affordability in New Zealand. It comes under the oversight of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and the Minister responsible is the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Megan Woods. History The KiwiBuild scheme was first announced as Labour Party policy in 2012 by then leader David Shearer. The policy survived as party policy under all his successors and was a prominent feature of Labour's 2014 election campaign. After the 2017 general election, the Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand took office. Finance Minister Grant Robertson outlined a mini-budget on 14 December 2017 which allocated $2 billion of capital spending to KiwiBuild. Homes built under the programme are sold to first-home buyers and the cash is recycled into further housing developments. In mid-January 2019, Housing Minister Phil Twyford acknowledged that the government would be able to build only 300 of the 1,000 KiwiBuild homes it had promised by 1 July 2019. That same month, it was reported that KiwiBuild's head Stephen Barclay had resigned following a dispute with Twyford over moving KiwiBuild from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) to the new Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Later reports claimed that Barclay had been the subject of complaints by staff over his leadership behaviour and treatment of others. In late January, Barclay filed a constructive dismissal case against HUD, claiming that the Ministry had breached his privacy. In August 2019 head of KiwiBuild Commercial Helen O'Sullivan also resigned causing further disruption. On 4 September 2019 a \\"reset\\" of the scheme was announced by new Housing Minister Megan Woods. Changes included the target of building 100,000 houses over 10 years being abandoned, the allocation of $400 million to support alternative home ownership schemes (such as rent-to-own), those buying studios and one-bedrooms units only having to commit to one year of ownership opposed to three, the 10% deposit requirement for a First Home Grant lowered to 5%, groups of more than three can combine their $10,000 First Home Grants together for a single joint deposit, the amount developers receive after triggering the underwrite has been lowered. By September 2019, the scheme had produced only 258 homes, far below the set targets. Data also highlighted that the Kiwibuild houses were not attracting buyers, leading to the unsold houses being put onto the private market in some areas, costing the government over $8,000,000. By August 2020 the scheme had built only 452 homes. Eligibility To be eligible to buy a KiwiBuild home, buyers must be New Zealand citizens, permanent or usual residents, earn less than the relevant annual income caps ($120,000 for singles, $180,000 for couples) and intend to live in and own the home for at least three years. Reaction The scheme has attracted criticism around the income caps, with claims that they are too high for low-income buyers to be able to compete with those receiving higher incomes. Following the sale of the first Kiwibuild homes, then-Housing Minister Phil Twyford stated that the scheme was not targeted towards working poor and unemployed families, attracting criticism from aspiring home-owners and activists who argued that KiwiBuild will lead to increased speculation and gentrification. There are misunderstandings by the general public and the media about how the scheme works. One widespread belief is that the KiwiBuild houses are subsidised by the government when what really happens is that property developers sell to the government at what is likely the market rate and the government then sells the property to eligible buyers 'at cost'. Once the government is paid by the buyer, the money is then recycled back into the scheme. The developers sell the KiwiBuild houses to the government for no more than $650,000 for their houses in Auckland and Queenstown and $500,000 for houses in all other areas. The developers appear to be achieving these price cap restrictions by building basic small houses on small lots of land at prices not much cheaper than their other houses that are not part of the KiwiBuild scheme.

A native of Fuqing, Fujian, China, he and fellow Fuqing native Sudono Salim (Liem Sie Liong) co-founded the conglomerate Salim Group, which grew into Indonesia's largest company. He founded Indocement and Indofood as part of the Salim Group, and was a major shareholder of Hong Kong-based conglomerate First Pacific. He was the last surviving member of the \\"Gang of Four\\", the most powerful Indonesian businessmen of the Suharto era. In the 1980s, he returned to Fuqing and established Rongqiao Group to focus on the development in his hometown. He built an industrial zone in Fuqing, as well as major infrastructure facilities including the New Fuzhou Port, one of China's top ten container ports, which helped the county's GDP ranking rise from the 68th in Fujian to the second. In 2015, the Hurun Report estimated his net worth to be US$3.9 billion, ranking him as the richest person in Fujian and the 408th richest in the world.  Early life  He was born Lin Wenjing on 19 March 1928, a native of Fuqing County, near Fuzhou, the capital of southeast China's Fujian Province. It is uncertain where he was born. According to his charitable foundation, he was born in Xitou Village (), Fuqing, and moved to Indonesia when he was eight. Other sources, including the South China Morning Post, state that he was born in Indonesia to parents from Fuqing.  Career in Indonesia  When Djuhar was 17, his father died and he had to quit school to run the family shop, beginning his business career as a small trader. In 1965, he established Huarenyi Limited Company in Jakarta, and went into many businesses including food, textiles, cement, real estate, mining, and transportation. In the late 1960s, he became partner with Sudono Salim (Liem Sie Liong). As they were both from Fuqing and shared the same Chinese family name Lin (Liem), Djuhar referred to Salim, who was 11 years his senior, as his \\"uncle\\". They merged their businesses to form the Salim Group, with Salim serving as Chairman and Djuhar as General Manager. Within the Salim Group, Djuhar established Indocement, which became for a time the world's largest cement company, and Indofood, a major flour company. The Salim Group grew into Indonesia's largest company, and Salim, Djuhar, and two other Salim Group executives, Sudwikatmono and Ibrahim Risjad, became known as the \\"Gang of Four\\", the most powerful Indonesian businessmen of the Suharto era.  Career in China  When China opened up to foreign investment in the Reform and Opening era, Djuhar visited Fuqing County in 1985 and found the place mired in poverty. He divested from the Salim Group and moved back to Fuqing in 1987 to focus on developing his hometown, and established Rongqiao Group () in 1989 to manage his investment. He vowed to create an industrial zone that would produce an annual output of US$500 million within five years, even though the total annual GDP of Fuqing at the time was only 430 million RMB. He not only reached the goal, but the industrial zone continued growing and achieved an annual output of US$5 billion by 2000. To support the development of industry, Djuhar made major investments in infrastructure. As Fuqing did not have its own port, Djuhar built the ports of Xialong () and Yuanhong () in the 1980s. In the 1990s, he built a deep-water port at Jiangyin (), which became one of the top ten container ports in China. It was renamed as New Fuzhou Port in October 2005. After several decades of development, Fuqing's GDP ranking among counties of Fujian rose from the 58th in the 1980s to the second in 2018. In 2005, Fuqing was upgraded from a county to the status of a county-level city. In 2010, Forbes ranked Djuhar as the 39th richest person in Indonesia, with a net worth of US$490 million. In 2015, the Hurun Report ranked him as the richest person in Fujian and the 408th richest in the world, with a net worth of US$3.9 billion.  Philanthropy  Djuhar was a well known philanthropist. Before his death, his Rongqiao Group had donated more than 1 billion yuan to various causes including education, public facilities, environment, and medical care. He established the Lin Wenjing Foundation in June 2016 to manage his philanthropic endeavours, and it had donated more than 10 million yuan in the two years before his death.  Personal life  Djuhar had five children. His son Teddy Djuhar is a director of the board of First Pacific. Djuhar died on 2 July 2018 in Fuzhou, China, at the age of 90.

History and taxonomy The species was first described in 1886 by Adrian John Brown, who identified the bacteria while studying fermentation. Brown gave the species the name Bacterium xylinum. It has since been known by several other names, mainly Acetobacter xylinum and Gluconacetobacter xylinus. It was given its current name, with the establishment of the new genus Komagataeibacter, in 2012. It is the type species of the genus. Genome and metabolism K. xylinus is a member of the acetic acid bacteria, a group of Gram-negative aerobic bacteria that produce acetic acid during fermentation. K. xylinus is unusual among the group in also producing cellulose. Bacterial cellulose (also sometimes known as nanocellulose) is involved in the formation of biofilms. It is chemically identical to plant cellulose, but has distinct physical structure and properties. The genome of a cellulose-deficient strain of K. xylinus was sequenced in 2011, and followed by the genomes of cellulose-producing strains in 2014 and 2018. The first cellulose-producing strain had a genome consisting of one chromosome 3.4 megabase pairs and five plasmids, of which one is a \\"megaplasmid\\" of about 330 kilobase pairs. Key genes related to cellulose production occur in the four-gene operon bcsABCD, which codes for the four subunits of the cellulose synthase enzyme. All four genes are required for efficient cellulose production in vivo, although BcsA and BscB are sufficient in vitro. Several other genes in the K. xylinus genome are also involved in cellulose production and regulation, including a cellulase enzyme. Uses and significance K. xylinus was used for a long time as a model organism for the study of cellulose production in plants. It is also studied in its own right to explore bacterial biofilm production, cell-cell communication, and other topics of interest. Production of bacterial cellulose for industrial uses has been the subject of extensive research, but is limited by productivity and scalability.

They took off on an open cabin flight at 8:25 am on 3rd April from Lalbalu Airfield and returned at 11:30 marking it as the first successful flight. It was financed by Lucy, Lady Houston and organized by Stewart Blacker.  Background  The idea for a flight expedition over the Mount Everest was proposed in 1918 by a British mountaineering physiologist, Alexander Kellas in his journal ‚ÄúThe Possibility of Aerial Reconnaissance in the Himalaya.‚Äù The attempt could not be made without significant funding and in September 1932 Lord Clydesdale visited Lady Houston at her Scottish shooting estate, Kinrara, to ask her to fund the expedition. He impressed her by dressing in his kilt for dinner. The strongly nationalistic Lady Houston was delighted with the idea that Clydesdale put forward, that the conquering of Everest by air would strengthen British rule in India. She agreed to fund the expedition and would remain closely involved at all stages, from England. Lord Clydesdale, Douglas-Hamilton, was the youngest squadron leader in the Royal Air Force who was born to Alfred, 13th Duke of Hamilton. He commanded 602 Squadron and was Chief Pilot of the Houston Mount Everest Flying Expedition. Lieutenant David Fowler McIntyre was also of 602 Squadron. Aircraft The aircraft used in the expedition were the original Westland PV-6, (prototype of the Westland Wallace bomber), registered G-ACBR (and also known as the Houston-Wallace), along with the modified Westland PV-3, registered G-ACAZ. Both aircraft were modified with enclosed observer positions, but retained open pilot cockpits and were also equipped with oxygen systems and facilities for heated flying clothing.The aircraft were shipped to Karachi in a boat and flown to Purnea. It set milestones for developments in technology, aviation and photography.  Expeditions  Observer Lieutenant Colonel Latham Valentine Stewart Blacker accompanied Lord Clydesdale and Sidney R. G. Bonnett, a cinematographer for Gaumont British News accompanied McIntyre. Bonnett, however lost consciousness due to hypoxia upon damaging his oxygen mask. The planes carried supplies to last 15 minutes over the mountains with inbuilt heating. The expeditors were dressed in multilayers of sheepskin clothing. The first expedition could not obtain clear photographs because of dust. They made another attempt on April 19, 1933, the pictures of which assisted Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the top of Mount Everest. The camera used was a Williamson Automatic Eagle III which took photographs of the surface at specific intervals as the airplanes flew over known survey locations with the aim of obtaining a photographic mosaic of the terrain and an accurate map. The photographs of the expedition were made public in 1951.

Raghuveer was killed during a classified mission as a RAW agent. Arjun dreams of joining the Indian foreign intelligence agency RAW and serve the country but gets no response even after sending 174 applications. In the 175th application, he mentions his father's name and gets recruited by Trinetra Agency, one of the secret weapons of RAW. At first, Satya doesn't accept Gopi's decision for fear of losing him, but Gopi tells about his passion to serve the nation like his father and Satya relents. Later, Trinetra's chief, Damodar (Anish Kuruvilla) briefs his new recruits about Al-Mujahidin, a terrorist outfit based in several countries and its chief called Rana, whose identity remains unknown despite several attempts. Meanwhile, Gopi starts dating Dr Sameera Rao (Sobhita Dhulipala), an M.A. psychology graduate from Harvard University and the girl next door. Sameera introduces her uncle as her father during one of their meetings. Gopi discovers this and confronts her about it, but Sameera confesses that her father died in an accident and she now considers her uncle as her father. Seeing how he's in a similar situation, Arjun reveals his true identity to her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Al- Mujahidin knows all about Trinetra. They are implementing \\"Mission Gopi\\". Arjun notices an Al-Mujahidin member Hamza near the Trinetra office and follows him. After some chase and struggle, he obtains a clue '1112' from the Al-Mujahidin agent. Trinetra team assumes that it is an attack plan on 11 December, but can't find the target of this attack, so they keep a close watch. During graduation, Acharya (Swaraj Rebbapragada), a senior official and founder of Trinetra, attends as a chief guest of the ceremony. Sameera suggests that Arjun presents a Jameson Irish Whiskey bottle to Damodar instead of going empty-handed. At the graduation, all recruits get their postings: Mohammad Basha (Rakesh Varre) gets selected for primary security detail, including escorting Acharya. Leena Raajan (Madhu Shalini) is assigned to the reconnaissance team in Dhaka through the Indian embassy. Arjun gets selected as a top spy who topped in the training achieved all the strengths without any weakness. He was presented with a Trinetra agency number 116. As an undercover agent, his primary job is to infiltrate, recon, sabotage and even assassinate, all behind the enemy lines. Should he be discovered, R.A.W would disavow him. He is assisted by his former trainers Nadia Qureshi (Supriya Yarlagadda), who oversees the operations and Shaam (Vennela Kishore), her trusted aid and technical lead. After the inauguration and reaching home, Arjun realizes he misinterpreted the clue (the code is actually reverse‚Äîit's 12 November, not 11 December) and that fateful day is the graduation day. The target is none other than Acharya himself. Gopi tries to warn Basha, but it's too late as the convoy is under attack already. Basha and Acharya are killed while the assailants flee. At the same time in the Trinetra office, Damodar sips the Whiskey which was presented by Gopi and having a conversation with his friend, former RAW agent and Gopi's Uncle Satya. Suddenly, Damodar starts choking and he collapsed down and dies, revealing the whisky to be poisoned. Gopi comes to know in the news that he is framed as the kingpin of the attack and PMO issues an arrest warrant. Simultaneously, Gopi gets attacked by the Al-Mujahidin members and Sameera dies in that attack. Gopi manages to defeat and escape from the commandos and he goes to meet his uncle in Rajahmundry. They both deduce that there is a mole in Trinetra. Arjun decides to find out this mole and the real identity of Rana. On the basis of clues, he leaves for Vishakapatnam. Meanwhile, Nadia and Shaam are appointed to catch Gopi. In a media primetime watch, a reporter shows that Gopi is in Rajahmundry in their channel. Shaam travels to Rajahmundry to trace Arjun. Meanwhile, through a phone call received by Nadia on Arjun's phone, she learns that he has a personal locker in a private bank. Nadia opens the locker and finds about Gopi's past. Rana makes a plan to nab Gopi through Khan, one of his Rajahmundry spies. According to Khan's sources, he also cannot find Gopi's hideout but he saw Gopi in a market and chases him but Gopi manages to escape from him successfully. Gopi reaches the Visakhapatnam airport to escape, but local police are searching for him in the airport. Gopi recognized a person who claimed to be Sameera's Uncle and confronts him but the person had consumed cyanide and died. When checking his purse he finds out the real identity of Sameera Rao (Sameera Sheikh instead of Sameera Rao). She is a psychology graduate at Harvard who belongs to Chittagong, Bangladesh. With the help of Satya, he understands that Sameera is also one of the members of Al- Mujahidin and that he was completely trapped by Al-Mujahidin. But he didn't understand why only he was trapped by them. He escapes successfully from the local police and reached Chittagong via sea route and meets his colleague Leena Raajan. Leena believes Gopi is innocent and helps him to find the truth. Meanwhile, with a minor clue, Shaam finds out Satya's hideout and informs Nadia At the same time, in Chittagong, Leena and Gopi find out Sameera's psychological clinic. Leena asks everyone about Sameera as her friend, which is noticed by the sleeper cells. They follow her and attack her but Gopi rescues her and he infiltrates the headquarters of Al-Mujahideen with Leena's help and finds some DVDs in the hideout. Leena is attacked by Khan and severely injured. Then Gopi rescues her again and kills Khan and destroys the entire headquarters of Al-Mujahidin. Arjun finds terrorist training videos and propaganda in a secret locker at the camp. In a video shop, he watches all the old CDs which he has found in the hideout. All the CDs mentioned about Al- Mujahidin; the first CD shows about a boy and a girl in the training and how they are brainwashed into becoming terrorists and in the other CD, it reveals Al-Mujahidin chief Rana's(Jagapati Babu) face. Looking at his face Gopi gets shocked and calls to his uncle and asks about his father. Satya reveals the secret which he had hidden for 20 years i.e Rana is none other than Raghuveer who is Satya's former friend and brother-in-law, ex Trinetra/RAW Agent and Gopi's father. 20 years ago in Sikkim, Satya got information about a Trinetra agent who is working as a covert to Al-Mujahidin. To find out him he came along with his team to catch them and notices Raghuveer giving all details of Trinetra agents and their offices. Vijay (Ravi Prakash), Satya's colleague, gets outraged and started firing on them. In the ensuing shootout, Raghuveer and Satya remain. Raghuveer tries to kill wounded Satya but he was shot from the backside by Vijay before he died. Raghuveer then jumped into the river and Satya thought he was dead and the information which has leaked by him to the terrorists so he informed to shut down the entire Trinetra agency and didn't said to anyone that Raghuveer is Rana as he feared that Al-Mujahidin members may try to take his nephew. To save his nephew, he came out of RAW and started a secret life with his nephew, changed their identities and moving to Rajahmundry and he became his father to the world. To divert Al-Mujahidin he created fake news that they both died in a car accident. Later Trinetra is completely shut down from that day onwards and was relaunched by the Raw in 2008. After hearing this, Gopi confesses that Raghuveer is alive then suddenly Rana enters Satya's hideout and instructs Gopi to come to his secret base. Gopi comes back to India and reaches Rana's base. Rana shows affection on Gopi and says that he acted as an Indian spy to spy on RAW. He felt dejected after hearing his son's death but he comes to know that his son is alive through the RAW application form. Then Rana announces that he has his members in Trinetra too and he decided to kill all the people who are responsible for hiding his son and decided to bring his son back permanently. He reveals that everything was set up by him until now. In the beginning, he uses Sameera to act as Gopi's girlfriend to get information on Gopi and Satya. But she changed her mind and started liking Gopi. According to his plan, he tried to kill Satya, Damodar, and Achari at the same time. However, Sameera managed to resist Satya for a visit and she didn't inject anaesthesia to Gopi or else he can kidnap Gopi and kill all of them at one shot but it couldn't have possible. So Rana killed her and shifted to plan B. According to that Gopi wants to search his father by himself and played all the tricks to find for himself. Then Rana puts Gun on Satya and orders Gopi to come with him. Gopi reveals that Trinetra is watching the whole episode and the soldiers arrive to attack the Al- Mujahidin forces. After the attack, Rana escapes with Satya followed by Gopi. After a rough chase wounded Rana again puts his gun on Satya to force Gopi to come with him. Then Gopi remembers Damodar's words \\"To get strong without any weakness you have to cross all your weaknesses, you said your father is your strength but I consider your father is your weakness; You have to cross your father\\". Gopi shoots his father to death. After a week later. Shaam meets Gopi in his home. Gopi says that Basha confessed his conversation with Gopi to Nadia before his death. Then she tracked Gopi's phone and she had found Satya's number. Satya warns Nadia about the mole in Trinetra, so Nadia had helped Gopi through Leena secretly. Finally, Gopi confesses that he found the mole in Trinetra and the culprit is going to die in a few minutes. Gopi reveals that he is none other than Shaam. He observed in the first CD (with the kids who are brainwashed) the boy who is getting trained with guns in the terrorist camp the trainer calls him Shaam. Shaam raises his gun to shoot Gopi to his death, but Gopi reminds him that Trinetra is always watching when the Trinetra team shoot Shaam. In Mount Alps, Gopi decided to leave Trinetra but Nadia reminds Gopi of Acharya's words about responsibilities towards the nation and makes him confident. Nadia handovers a letter to Gopi which she had found in Gopi's bank locker written by Sameera. In the letter, Sameera apologises about not disclosing her identity and shares her feelings with him. The film ends with Agent Gopi 116 reporting to Nadia and continuing his mission in Russia as a Goodachari(spy), hinting towards a sequel.  Cast  * Adivi Sesh as M. Gopi / M.

The first-look poster of the film was released on 13 January 2018 coinciding with Sankranthi festival.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack of Goodachari consists of seven songs, all of which were composed by Sricharan Pakala.  Critical reception  Goodachari received rave reviews from critics and was praised for its unique concept which was foreign to Telugu cinema. It was criticized by some who drew comparisons to James Bond and said that this film was ripped off of that franchise. However, the two plots proved to be different and in this way, Goodachari was able to avoid controversies. The Times of India gave it four stars and wrote, \\"Goodachari proves what Tollywood can do, if only it makes different choices and dreams big. Filled with edge-of-the-seat moments and riveting twists, this one is the perfect popcorn entertainer.\\" GreatAndhra gave it a rating of 3/5 and wrote, \\"'Goodachari' is a well-made spy thriller with right mix of suspense, action, and emotion.\\" The Hindustan Times gave it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"However, away from these obvious set-ups and spoon-fed moments, there is magic in this film.\\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/regional- movies/goodachari-movie-review-adivi-sesh-is-a-talented-actor-a-star- writer/story-SrAg5a5Oiz9hjPSVlIUCTI.html The Hindu wrote, \\"This coming-of-age story of a spy is a winner,\\" and praised it for its racy screenplay. Idlebrain's Jeevi gave it 3.25 stars and wrote, \\"Making a spy film in Telugu and making sure that it doesn't look pretentious is an achievement. With movie lovers having access to digital platforms and with all spy films (James Bond series, Kingsman, Mission Impossible etc in general and Paramanu, Raazi etc in particular) being available at no cost, it takes a lot of guts and ability for makers to select spy genre for a regional film. There are budget constraints too. The team has delivered a genuine spy action film which is engaging and which can stand on its own without drawing any comparisons with any other Hollywood films. Goodachari is different, yet commercial. You may watch it!\\" The News Minute praised it for its originality and said that it didn't run out of ideas. They wrote, \\"Goodachari is a movie that gives its audience its money's worth, and shows how we have not used up all possible roles where a veteran like Prakash Raj can add value!\\" 123telugu gave it 3.5 stars and said, \\"If Adivi Sesh's Kshanam gave a new edge to the thriller genre, Goodachari is a notch higher and showcases that there are makers in Tollywood who can dream big and make films on an international level. Goodachari is filled with edge of the seat moments and riveting thrills which will keep you entertained. As the film is made on a compact budget, it will make merry at the box office because of its universal appeal. If you ignore the slightly slow second half, you can happily enjoy this popcorn thriller which is filled with ample twists and turns.\\" Indiaglitz gave it 3.25 stars, saying that \\"'Goodachari' has the right mix: underplayed heroism, saleable emotions, thrilling twists, technical finesse, clap-worthy dialogue. Besides, it has got some of the coolest performances.\\"https://www.indiaglitz.com/goodachari-review-telugu-movie-22152  Box office  The film grossed 25 crore in its first weekend.  Sequel and remake  In December 2018, scriptwriter and actor Adivi Sesh confirmed that there would be a sequel to the film, titled Goodachari 2. It would be directed by Rahul Pakala.https://twitter.com/AdiviSesh A Hindi remake of this film has been announced which is going to be produced by Sajid Nadiadwala, directed by Sriram Raghavan and starring Kartik Aaryan in the lead role.

Her research focuses on risky behaviors in adolescent humans during puberty and examines the function of those risks. For her research in adolescent brain development and behaviour, she was awarded the Spinoza Prize, the highest recognition for Dutch scientists, in 2017.  Life and career  Crone was born on 23 October 1975 in Schiedam, Netherlands. In high school, her curiosity about other people and their motivations led to her interest in psychology. For her post- graduate education, she spent a year-long internship at the University of Pittsburgh from 1997 to 1998, where she first developed a fascination with research on the brain after witnessing the first neuroimaging studies including young children were performed. In 1999, she received a Master's degree from the University of Amsterdam in developmental psychology. In 2003, she graduated cum laude in the same field and from the same university with her doctorate thesis, Performance monitoring and decision-making: Psychophysiological and developmental analyses. This thesis received multiple awards. She then spent two years working as a post doctoral associate at the Center for Mind and Brain at the University of California, Davis. In 2005, Crone took a position as an assistant professor in the Department of Developmental Psychology at Leiden University, rising to associate professor in 2008. In 2009, she became a full professor of Neurocognitive Developmental Psychology at Leiden and also of Neurocognitive and Affective Adolescent development, at her alma mater, the University of Amsterdam, where she would work until 2014. At Leiden, she founded the Brain and Development laboratory in 2005. From its research, this lab \\"[offers] reference points for adapting education and society to adolescents‚Äô capacities.\\" Research Crone's research focuses on risky behaviors in adolescent humans during puberty and examines the function of those risks. She uses functional magnetic resonance imaging and various other scientific techniques to examine brain processes in adolescent brains. She characterizes adolescence as a \\"useful development phase in which the brain learns to deal with a larger social environment,\\" as opposed to a necessary evil. In The Netherlands, her work has led to policy changes: a modification of the Youth Detention Act extended the age limits for juvenile prisons from 18 to 23. However, she maintains that, though she offers her knowledge, she must abstain from policy and value judgements and her research must not be influenced by values. She was awarded the VICI grant from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research in 2015, and the Consolidator Grant from the European Research Council in 2016. Awards and honors The winners of the 2017 Spinoza Prize; Crone is at far right In 2017, Crone was named one of the four winners of the Spinoza Prize. In interviews, she stated that she would use the prize money to continue her research on risk taking in the adolescent brain and to connect investigations on identity, altruism, and social media usage in young adults. Crone is also the recipient of the Huibregtsen Prize for Science and Society by the Dutch Minister of Education in 2009; the Early Career Award from the Society for Psychophysiological Research in 2011; and the from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017.  Memberships and affiliations In 2013, Crone was elected to the Academia Europaea and the Royal Dutch Society of Sciences and Humanities. In 2013 she was also elected to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences after she had been a member of The Young Academy, where she had been a chair, since 2008. The Netherlands' National Network for Women in Science has given her one of their top achievement awards, and she has published over 150 well-cited articles in scientific journals.  Publications  Outside of research, Crone makes frequent appearances in various forms of media. In 2008, Crone published her first book, Het puberende brein. Her second book, Het sociale brein van de puber, was published in 2012. She also collaborated with communication experts to publish a website for adolescents where they could find information about their developing brains. In 2016, she and documentary producer Erik Heuvelink created the film Braintime: Discovering the developing brain, which portrayed interviews from the namesake study's researchers and young participants alongside the study's results. She gave a TEDx Talk in Amsterdam on \\"The rebellious teenager\\" in 2011. Personal life Crone is the mother of two children; her husband works a three day week, which she states allows her to work full-time. With some colleagues from Leiden University, she founded an organization, Athena's Angels, which aims to make visible and then correct the problems experienced by women who work in science. On the subject of these problems, Crone states, \\"It is difficult to deal with it as an individual. That is why it is important that women help each other.

It is located on the Socialist street, 94 in the Kirov district of Rostov-on-Don. The house was of historical and architectural value, but eventually became in a critical condition, and then was completely demolished in 2014.  History  Matilda Rindzyun has got the three-storied mansion on Nikolskaya Street of that time, 92 in Rostov-on- Don in which in 1895 her husband Ilya Ryndzyun has opened the city's first hydropathic. It carried out light therapy and water therapy of patients. The doctor called his methods \\"rational hydrotherapy\\" which in Rostov of that time was absolutely new phenomenon. Doctor Ilya Ryndzyun moved to Rostov-on-Don from St. Petersburg, he received his professional education at the Imperial Military Medical Academy. Despite the novelty of the methods, the Ryndzyun hydropathic became popular among citizens in narrow time frames. The range of procedures was gradually expanded: the hydro-massage, medical and health- improving baths were supplemented with light therapy. In 1901, Ilya Ryndziun published his own book about methods of treatment and it was immediately sold out. There are reasons to believe that the writer Anton Pavlovich Chekhov also visited the Ryndzyun hydropathic during visits to Rostov-on-Don. In this three-story house grew the children of Ilya Ryndzhyun, two of whom became famous. His daughter Nina Niss-Goldman became a famous sculptor, and his son Vladimir emigrated, worked abroad as a journalist and writer. In the book dated 1912 this house was called \\"Hydropathic institution and light-healing hospital of Dr. Ryndzyun\\". In 1917 before revolution, the Ryndzyun family sold this house to the Cossacks of Don Host - the brothers Korolkov. After 1917 the building was equipped with communal apartments. Until 2004, the former hydropathic institution was listed in the guard register of the Ministry of Culture as an object of history and culture of regional importance. Then there was the information that the buildings must demolish or save. In 2009-2010, was held protests against the demolition of the house. After that in 2012 the building was put up for auction, but the auction was not ultimately carried out, though the house had to be sold with the condition of preserving the historic facade. As of 2013, the house was in a critical condition. In 2014, the hydropathic was privatized and then it was demolished. The building was carried out manually.  Description  Ryndzyun's house was built in the style of the southern Russian eclecticism which was lost over time. The key element of the facade decoration was stucco molding which was a lot. On the first two floors of the house there was a clinic and on the third there lived a doctor with his wife and four children. The facade of the house was decorated with a brick, which was produced by the manufacturer Epifanov who was the owner of a profitable brick manufactory. All the bricks at his enterprise were made by the method of manual molding. Not only the demolished house represented historical and cultural value, but also the site and the area where the former hydropathic institution was located.

The drug shows considerably improved oral estrogenic potency (uterotrophic) relative to ethinylestradiol in rats but without an increase in hepatic estrogenic potency. Related compounds like ethinylestradiol N,N-diethylsulfamate (J271) and ethinylestradiol pyrrolidinosulfonate (J272) have also been developed, and have similar properties in animals. However, the closely related compound estradiol sulfamate (E2MATE) failed to show estrogenic activity in humans, which is due to the fact that it is additionally a highly potent inhibitor of steroid sulfatase and prevents its own bioactivation into estradiol.

In 1636, the Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coin was introduced by the government of the Tokugawa shogunate as a means to standardise copper coins and keep up a sufficient supply of copper coinage, being the first government minted copper coin in 700 years. The government adopted them from after their successful introduction in the Mito domain 10 years prior during the 3rd year of the Kan'ei era. These coins would become the daily currency of the common people and would be used for small payments.Suzuki Kimio, Shutusdo senka no kenky√ª, 202-21.

(in Japanese) Due to the isolationist policies of the Tokugawa shogunate, the outflow of currency halted and Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins would continue to stay the main coin circulating in Japan. Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç were minted for 230 years despite the fact that the Kan'ei era ended in 1643. Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins would continue to bear the Kan'ei legend, even when a new denomination of the coin was introduced a century later. They were not all uniform as the shogunate had intended, as the mintage was outsourced to regional and local merchants who would cast them at varying weights and sizes, as well as occasionally with local mint marks. By the 1650s, 16 private mints were operating for the production of Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins all over Japan.Noriko Fujii (Senior Researcher and Director Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies The Bank of Japan.)

In 1738, the government authorised the manufacture of iron Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç 1 mon coins, and in 1866 (just before the end of the Edo period) iron 4 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç were authorised. While iron coins were being minted the quality of copper coins would decrease due to frequent debasements.  1 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins  Kanbun 8 (1668). The peace in Japan after 1615 had a tremendous effect on the Japanese economy. These beneficial circumstances in the economy boosted trade which raised the demand for money by merchants and other traders in order to keep the commerce growing, The alternate attendance system forced the daimy≈ç to reside every other year in the Tokugawa capital of Edo and these daimy≈ç would spend vast quantities of money there. Copper, gold and silver mines were opened up all over Japan and the monetary system of the Tokugawa shogunate established separate mints for copper, silver, and gold coinages. The original 1 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç was produced by the Mito domain in 1626 in minor quantities, this happened in response to the booming economy Japan had experienced to meet the demand for circulating copper coins. In 1636 the government of the Tokugawa shogunate ordered that these Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins be minted in large numbers and model coins were distributed to subcontractors all over Japan with the tax being payable proportionate of the amount produced to ensure that they would be produced in sufficient quantities and started producing them at the mint of Edo and in in the ≈åmi province, the shogunate also sent mother coins of the Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç to the Mito Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Mikawa Province (Yoshida Domain), the Echizen province (Takada Domain), the Matsumoto Domain, the Okayama Domain, the Nagato Province, and to the Bungo Province (Nakagawa). Controlled management of the production brought stability to the copper currency of the Tokugawa shogunate which allowed the government to temporarily suspend production in 1640. By the 1650s Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins were already being produced at sixteen different locations, even though the Kan'ei era stopped in 1643 these coins continued to be manufactured, during the same year the Tokugawa government issued an edict against the illegal production of copper cash coins. Due to a shortage in copper from 1656 until 1660 only 300,000 Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç cash coins were produced at Torigoe in Edo and 200,000 at Kutsunoya in Suruga. 1 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins produced before 1688 are referred to as \\"old Kan'ei\\" and are recognisable by their similar calligraphic styles making them hard to differentiate from one another, meanwhile Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins produced after 1688 (or \\"new Kan'ei\\" coins) tend to be more diverse in calligraphic styling. Most issues of Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç only ran between 3 and 5 years from their introduction. The first type of the \\"new Kan'ei\\" coins had a mintage of 1,970,000 cash coins and were minted from 1668 until 1684 at Kameido in Edo. As these have the inscription \\"bun\\" (Êñá) of the Kanbun era (1661‚Äì1673) on their reverses, for this reason they are informally known as Bunsen (ÊñáÈä≠). They became an accepted measuring unit, to the point that even the length of socks was measured in Bunsen coins. As copper mines began to run out in Japan during the early eighteenth century which made the metal more scarce causing its value to increase, this had the effect that the price to manufacture more cash coins would go up and eventually the nominal value of the coins became lower than their intrinsic value. One response to this situation was creating iron Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins, the first time that the government of the Tokugawa shogunate allowed for this development was in 1739, concurrently Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç made from copper-alloys were only being produced in lesser numbers. The copper-alloy Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç that were still being produced weighed less and were of inferior quality compared to those produced before them, as the price of copper remained high most 1 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç still being produced were made of iron while most copper-alloy coins that were being produced were Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç with a face value of 4 mon and from 1835 Tenp≈ç Ts≈´h≈ç cash coins with a face value of 100 mon. Iron Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins tend to have less clear inscriptions and the features of these coins such as their inner and outer rims tend to be less fine and are often jagged and unfiled because iron more difficult to cast. Due to the nature of iron these coins also tend to suffer from oxidation very easily. From 1866 during the Bakumatsu new iron Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç of 4 mon were introduced as inflation had become prevalent. 1 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç produced after 1688 can easily be attributed because of things like mint marks, rim markings, different calligraphic styles and in rare cases accidental markings on the mother coin.Shizuoka Izumika comp., Anasen Nyuumon Kan'ei Tsuuhou: Shin Kan'ei no bu (Shoshinkan: Tokyo, 1997). (in Japanese)  4 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins  A Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç cash coin with a nominal value of 4 mon. In 1768 the chamberlain Tanuma Okitsugu commissioned the creation of a brass Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç cash coin with a face value of 4 mon, the initial version was cast at the Fukugawa mint in the capital city of Edo and had an iconic design with 21 waves on its reverse, the following year the reverse design was changed to only have 11 waves and all following versions of the 4 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç had this design. Brass cash coins were made from an alloy of copper and zinc, these cash had been manufactured in China from the late Ming dynasty onwards however due to the fact that zinc was not available in Japan and had to be imported weren't being produced in Japan prior. From this point on, the subcontract system for the minting of bronze cash coins came to an end and the Ginza Mint in Edo had received a monopoly over the production of 4 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç brass cash coins. The 4 mon coin was notably only 2 millimeters bigger than the 1 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç cash coin making it cheaper to produce and getting more nominal value out of a comparable amount of copper, as copper had become more scarce in Japan at the time these Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç cash coins of 4 mon became more commonly produced because of their relative cost efficiency in respect to the lower denomination. As the economy was still growing the Japanese population accepted these coins at their face value because of the strong demand for (circulating) currency. The government of the Tokugawa shogunate requested a large number of these 4 mon coins to be cast between the years of 1821 and 1825 which falls within the Bunsei period and are therefore dubbed \\"Bunsei\\" coins as opposed to the earlier produced \\"Meiwa coins\\", the Bunsei era 4 mon cash coins produced in this period are of variable quality with a large quantity of them being of less than desirable workmanship while they still appear largely identical, the Bunsei era 4 mon cash coins also tend to have a more reddish colour due to the fact that their alloys contained more different types of metals other than copper. 4 mon Bunei Kan'ei coins are just as common as those produced during the Meiwa period. Another type of 4 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins are the Ansei Kan'ei produced during the Ansei era (1854‚Äì1859), these coins to be more yellowish due to the fact that they were made from brass as opposed to bronze and gave rough faces while they have very clear file marks. In 1860 the government of the Tokugawa shogunate allowed for the production of iron Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins due to extreme financial difficulties, but the attempt to mint iron cash coins failed due to the fact that iron is prone to oxidation making them difficult to use leading to them being quite uncommon. Due to the fact that it was very profitable to make Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç cash coins of 4 mon many counterfeits were produced by both illegal private mints and mints operated by clandestine daimy≈ç's. From 1866 the government of the Tokugawa shogunate started giving domains official permission to cast iron 4 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç cash coins with their own finances, these coins can easily be differentiated by special markings on their back to identify the mint of origin. Concurrently as the government of the Tokugawa shogunate started to allow local domains to issue their own 4 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç coins they themselves started minting the Bunky≈´ Eih≈ç (Êñá‰πÖÊ∞∏ÂÆù) cash coin from 1863, the inscription on the coin refers to the Bunky≈´ era (1861‚Äì1864), Eih≈ç (Ê∞∏ÂÆù) could be translated as \\"eternally circulating treasure\\" indicating a very hopeful name for the new series which didn't come into fruition as the Japanese mon was superseded by the yen during the Meiji restoration.Shizuoka Izumika comp., Anasen Nyuumon Kan'ei Tsuuhou: Shin Kan'ei no bu (Shoshinkan: Tokyo, 1997). (in Japanese). Like the 4 mon Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç the Bunky≈´ Eih≈ç were not produced at copper mints but at the silver and gold mints of the shogunate, they had a reverse design of 11 waves but tended to weigh less due to the fact that the price of copper was still rising.

Plot Leaving her dying father's bedside, singer Maisie (Kimbra) rushes to perform at an indie music gig in town. But as she sings the opening song, it is hard for her to ignore the heartfelt story she has just been told ‚Äì the story of how her dad met and fell in love with her mother, and how it all devastatingly fell apart. As the night goes on, the love story of her father, Eric (George Mason), and her mother, Rose (Rose McIver), is shown through Maisie's eyes. From the time they meet in Hamilton in 1966 to their separation in the 1980s, we follow the bittersweet nuances of a couple's life, expressed with contemporary re-imaginings of the iconic New Zealand hit songs of artists such as Crowded House, Bic Runga and Dave Dobbyn.

Circulating levels of EE sulfate range from 6 to 22 times those of EE when EE is taken orally. EE sulfate can be transformed back into EE via steroid sulfatase, and it has been suggested that EE sulfate may serve as a circulating reservoir for EE, similarly to the case of estrone sulfate with estradiol. However, the EE sulfate pool with EE is far smaller than the pool of estrone sulfate that occurs with estradiol (with estrone sulfate levels approximately 200-fold higher than estradiol levels on average with oral estradiol). In addition, in contrast to the case of estrone sulfate and estrone, the conversion rate of EE sulfate back into EE is relatively low, and has been said probably isn't of clinical significance. However, other studies have suggested that EE sulfate may nonetheless contribute up to 20% of total EE levels.

Built in 1886, and enlarged several times, its growth mirrored the city's rapid growth in the late 19th century due to the arrival of many immigrant laborers. It served as a school until 1976, and has since been converted to residential use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Bishop School building is located in a residential area north of downtown Waterbury, on a parcel bounded on three sides by Bishop, Crown, and Beacon Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick with brownstone trim. It is stylistically a mixture of Italianate and Romanesque elements, reflective in part of its evolutionary growth. Its central section is the oldest portion; it has a broad gable and is nine bays wide, with a pair of brick pilasters flanking a bay of paired windows. With The school was built in 1879 to serve what was then a predominantly Irish immigrant neighborhood. It was enlarged in 1890, by which time the neighborhood had acquired a mix of residents from eastern and southern Europe, and again in 1895. Continued population growth prompted the construction of other schools in the neighborhood, and this one was used in the early 1900s as a teacher training school as part of a progressive plan to raise the quality of the city's elementary school teachers. The school remained in service as an elementary school until 1976. The original portion was designed by Miles Pritchard, a local architect; the 1895 addition was designed by Joseph A. Jackson, a prominent local architect of commercial and institutional buildings.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Blackstone House stands southeast of the town center of Branford, on the east side of First Avenue in a residential area developed in the early 20th century as a summer resort area. It is a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a steeply pitched gabled roof and central chimney. It has a clapboarded exterior and rests on a stone foundation. The main facade is oriented facing south, and has a symmetrical arrangement of windows around a central entrance. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, which rise to a corniced entablature. The street-facing gable has had some of its windows replaced by a modern oriel bay window. Extending to the north of the main block are an ell and garage. With The exact construction date of the house is not known; although local tradition places its construction to early in the 18th century, stylistic analysis and land record research place its construction date into the second quarter of the 18th century. It was owned by the Blackstone family into the 19th century. In 1886 it was purchased by E.M. Hotchkiss of Waterbury, who converted the property into a summer resort. In 1907, the property was subdivided for development that created the surrounding neighborhood.

Moreover, the think tank's staff regularly participate in public academic debates and contribute to newspapers and online media outlets as guest experts. Political orientation and positions During the reform of the German Intelligence Service Act in 2016, Thorsten Wetzling, the head of the foundation‚Äôs \\"Digital Fundamental Rights, Surveillance and Transparency\\" project, advocated for stricter controls on the Federal Intelligence Service. Along with administrative modernization, demands were made for more data from authorities and administrative bodies to be made publicly available to citizens and startups. In other papers, it criticized the relaxation of net neutrality rules, and argued for more state intervention in the area of IT security, as well as for greater cooperation between civil society and government. The organization consistently take the positions of strengthening the protection of fundamental rights and privacy. Financing According to its own website, the think tank had a yearly budget of approximately 1.1 million euros in 2016, of which a great extent was granted by non-profit organizations, foundations and public institutions. Corporate contributions comprise 30 percent of the total budget. 27 patrons finance the organization in total. In 2016, the organization's largest patrons included the Omidyar Network, the Robert Bosch Foundation, the Innogy Foundation for Energy und Society and the German Federal Foreign Office, as well as the Mercator Foundation und the Open Society Foundations. Organization and leadership The executive board is responsible for the leadership of the organization. Members of the board include Anna Wohlfarth, Stefan Heumann and Ben Scott. The board is appointed and controlled by a 19-person committee with representatives from academia, politics and business, as well as leading figures from civil-society organizations. The committee chair is Michael Vassiliadis. Founding and development of the organization Stiftung Neue Verantwortung was founded in 2008 with the original goal of offering young professionals from corporations, research institutions and civil-society organizations a platform to work on societal issues, publish and build relationships in Berlin for one year. Among its supporters at the time of its founding were the German Academy of Science and Engineering (Acatech), the Federation of German Industries (BDI), the Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities and the former German Sports Confederation. The organization was financed through donations from corporations, including Friedhelm Loh, Beisheim Holding, EnBW, Bosch and Giesecke & Devrient. Following a shift in the executive board at the end of 2014, the organization re-established itself as a think tank focusing on digitalization with a permanent, interdisciplinary staff. Financing thereafter was largely provided by grants from non-profit foundations or the public sector.

This painting is currently located in Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin.  Description  Like many of his paintings, there's only the back view of a figure. The painting depicts his wife at his studio in Dresden. Although the painting only shows her back, it allows the viewers to imagine what she sees. The view that starts to form is that she lives in a constricted environment and the only access of the outside world is through the window. A port with some ships, water, a coastline, and trees starts to appear. There's also a view of the sky, but covered by the window above her. The ship that is passing slowly symbolizes how she is watching her life slowly passing by before her. The ship will be moving on while she is still stuck in the domestic environment. We get a sense that she wants more out of her life, just like most of Friedrich's paintings. In addition, there's also a sense of quietness and restriction in this painting, but it's not because this room is small. The room is in fact a very large space with high ceiling and big windows. The painting has perfect verticals and horizontals line throughout. The woman is a contrast of this painting because she's the only part that doesn't fit into this geometric painting. Like many of his painting, Friedrich broke the order and symmetry by adding some sort of figure. In this case, he added the woman. Her body is slightly tilted to the left, breaking the geometry with her curvature. Adding the soft light sky and trees makes the woman stand out even more. From her posture to the lighting of the room shows what she has experienced throughout her life.

It is one of a group of historic sites labelled The Captain Thunderbolt Sites for their association with bushranger Captain Thunderbolt, along with Captain Thunderbolt's Rock, Blanch's Royal Oak Inn, and Captain Thunderbolt's Grave. Collectively, all properties were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 July 2012.  History  After the hawker, Giovanni Cappisotti, raised the alarm in Uralla regarding the events at Blanch's Inn on the afternoon of 25 May 1870, Senior Constable John Mulhall and Constable Alexander Walker rode south from Uralla. Mulhall had the better horse and reached the inn first. Walker was approximately half a mile away when he heard shots being fired and met Mulhall while ascending the hill towards the Inn. Mulhall told Walker \\"I have exchanged shots with them\\" and took no further part in the chase as his horse was bolting. On reaching the top of the hill Walker saw two men on grey horses. The younger man appeared to herd the older away from the road forcing him to ride west along Blanch's fence. Walker chased Thunderbolt to Kentucky Creek with shots exchanged on the way. Once he reached the creek Thunderbolt dismounted and waded across the creek. Walker caught up with his horse and shot it, preventing its further use for Thunderbolt's escape. Walker crossed the river and had to go about to where Thunderbolt was, now back on the opposite side of the creek. Walker galloped up to Thunderbolt until they were separated by a distance of . \\"Surrender\\" ordered Walker. \\"Never, what is your name?\\" \\"Walker\\" was the Constable's reply. \\"Are you a trooper Walker?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"A married man?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Remember you are a married man Walker\\" said Thunderbolt shaking his pistol. \\"Will you surrender?\\" \\"I will die first\\" Thunderbolt spat back, likely the hell that was Cockatoo Island forefront in his mind. \\"Then it's you or I for it.\\" Walker rushed forward his horse stumbling in the water. Ward rushed at the Constable, into the water, with his revolver raised. Walker fired, later the Armidale Medical Advisor to the government, Dr Spasshatt, would testify that the bullet had entered just below the left collar bone and exited \\"on the right side of the chest, below and anterior to the lower point right shoulder blade\\". Thunderbolt rose up once more and was finally felled by a strike to the head from Walker's pistol. Walker thinking the other man to be dead drew him out of the water.SRNSW 1/2326.2 File 76/2239 No.70/4440 Walker returned to the Inn thinking the other man who had been seen with Thunderbolt was his accomplice. Once it was established that he was a victim of Thunderbolt's robbery, they set back out to reclaim the body. They were unsuccessful and it was not until daylight the following day that Walker accompanied by Senior Constable Mulhall, a man named Dwyer and Senior Constable Scott were able to retrieve the body and returned it to Blanch's Royal Oak Inn for the magisterial inquiry before being moved to Uralla. Constable Walker received a promotion for his efforts and was also the recipient of half of the A¬£400 reward (the other half went to Cappisotti) for the capture of Thunderbolt. Walker had a meritorious career in the police rising to the rank of Superintendent in 1896. He served in that capacity in the Deniliquin, Albury and Goulburn districts. In 1907 he also acted as Inspector-General of Police for a period of three months. Walker passed away at his home in Cremorne on 30 April 1929, he was 81 years old. It has been reported that after Ned Kelly's raid on Jerilderie in 1879 the help of the then Senior Sergeant Walker was sought by the Victorian Police to catch Kelly. Kelly disappeared before Walker could cross the Murray and he took no further part in the search. On 24 May 1970 a memorial to Constable Walker was unveiled in Uralla to celebrate the centenary of Thunderbolt's death the inscription reads: THUNDERBOLT CENTENARY 1870 - 1970 ALEXANDER BINNING WALKER This plaque commemorating the bravery of Const. A. B. Walker was unveiled by T. W. Allan, Police Commissioner on 24 May 1970.  Description  The site of Thunderbolt's death is near to where the Kentucky Creek turns from running north-south to east-west; the creek is surrounded by pasture.  Condition  As at 10 April 2012, the site is intact and is unlikely to have archaeological potential.  Modifications and dates  Thunderbolt's actual death site is now submerged as the Kentucky Creek dam was constructed downstream of the site in the 1960s.  Further information  The broad location of Captain Thunderbolt's Death Site has been identified based on the police report submitted by Constable Alexander Binning Walker after his shooting of Thunderbolt. Different secondary sources stat that the actual death site was either in the north-south running section of the creek or the east-west section. Insufficient evidence is available to resolve this matter. The adjacent landowner had previously provided access for visitors to Thunderbolt's Death Site, however this has stopped due to the amount of rubbish being left in the paddocks.  Heritage listing  As at 10 April 2012, Captain Thunderbolt's Death Site is significant as the last stand of this bushranger. The site contributes to the State significance of the Captain Thunderbolt Sites through its associations with Captain Thunderbolt. The Captain Thunderbolt Sites - Thunderbolt's Death Site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 July 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Captain Thunderbolt's Death Site contributes to the State significance of the Captain Thunderbolt Sites through its intimate associations with the Captain Thunderbolt story. The site is also significant for its associations with Constable Alexander Binning Walker who was promoted after the shooting of Thunderbolt, eventually rising to the rank of Superintendent in the NSW Police Force. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Captain Thunderbolt's Death Site contributes to the State significance of The Captain Thunderbolt Sites for its associations with Captain Thunderbolt and the place he holds in the public's imagination and consciousness. Thunderbolt is one of the best known bushrangers who operated in New South Wales and forms a significant element to the construction of the Australian identity. With the rise in nationalist sentiment leading up to Federation it was important for colonists and early Australians to be able to present themselves as a young and respectable nation. It was this necessity that lead to the romanticisation of the bushrangers, and in particular Captain Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt's life has captured the public imagination through this process of romanticisation. Death sites of cultural legends like Captain Thunderbolt have high value to a range of people. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Captain Thunderbolt 's Death Site is rare as a well-documented site of a bushranger's death in the bush. The large majority of NSW bushrangers were killed in sieges in buildings; were hung in Darlinghurst Gaol, or died under more ordinary circumstances.

The highway passes through some unusual clay pillars en route to Kaza, the largest town in Spiti valley. Near Lingti, before Kaza, the road to Pin Valley National Park branches off over the Attargo Bridge to the right bank of the Spiti. On the Tabo side of Lingti is the road to the Dhanker Monastery. In this section, the riverbed is very wide, up to in places. The river itself is much narrower and meanders in braids along the broad riverbed.

At the bridge, the Kaza-Kibber road continues on the left bank to Key Monastery () and the Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary (). NH-505 continues on the right bank running through a flat, narrow valley in which the Spiti river has carved a gorge about deep. The road crosses back to the left bank before Kialto village. Here, the Kaza-Kibber road rejoins NH-505, a distance of from Kibber. After Morang and Hanse villages, the valley broadens before Losar village. After Losar, NH-505 turns up the right bank of the Lichu, a right bank tributary of the Spiti. The road climbs gradually up to Kunzum La, elev. . There is a temple at the pass.

Chandra Taal is a pristine lake on the Chandra River popular with tourists and high-altitude trekkers. The road to Chandra Taal branches off from NH-505 about from Batal and from Kunzum Pass. From Batal, NH-505 follows the left bank of the Chandra river, practically running on the riverbed in some places as both sides of the narrow valley are very steep. This section is largely unpaved and impassable during the winter months. Passing through Chotta Dara the highway reaches Chhatru where it crosses to the right bank.

In rainbow boxes, the elements are shown in columns (e.g. the amino acids), and each set is represented by a rectangular box (e.g. the groups of amino acids sharing a given property). Each box covers the columns corresponding to the elements belonging to its set. When the elements of a given set are not displayed in contiguous columns, a ‚Äúholes‚Äù is present in the box of the set (in the amino acids example on the right, the \\"Polar\\" box has three holes). The column order is computed using a heuristic optimization algorithm, in order to minimize the number of holes. A specific color is associated with each column, ranging across the spectrum, and box colors are the mean of the colors of the columns it covers. Boxes are stacked vertically, the largest boxes being at the bottom. Custom colors may also be defined, depending on the data.

It was acquired in 1832 by senator Carl Friedrich Pogge von Greifswald, then later by Adolf Gustav Barthold Georg von Pressentin (1814‚Äì1879), who lived in Rostock. After von Pressentin's death it was acquired by Martin Brunn, a Jewish art collector who lived in Berlin.

It is one of a group of historic sites labelled The Captain Thunderbolt Sites for their association with bushranger Captain Thunderbolt, along with Captain Thunderbolt's Rock, Captain Thunderbolt's Death Site, and Captain Thunderbolt's Grave. Collectively, all properties were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 July 2012.  History  John Blanch owned a number of properties near Uralla specifically to the south of the township. A Parish Map from 1865 shows that the lot in Church Gully was owned by John Blanch. Although it is not known when Blanch established his inn, it was extant in 1870 and was the site of Thunderbolt's final robbery. On the afternoon of 25 May 1870 Thunderbolt, who had been in the area for the Uralla races the day before, made his way to Blanch's Inn on the main road. Arriving early in the afternoon he was met by the son of John Blanch who told him that his parents had not yet returned from the races. Riding the approximately to Split Rock he waited for the Blanchs and after bailing them up and robbing them, he accompanied them back to the inn. Sometime after an Italian hawker Giovanni Cappisotti was robbed and held at the Inn by Thunderbolt. Cappisotti was robbed of a number of items including a jewel box, cash, a pair of lady's earrings, some rings, an Albert watch and chain and some gold. These items were used to identify the man later shot by Constable Walker as the thief. Other customers and travellers were robbed and \\"invited\\" to remain for the festivities as they arrived. At some time during the afternoon Cappisotti asked for permission to leave. Thunderbolt gave the permission on the proviso that he travel south, away from Uralla and the police. Cappisotti agreed and headed south to Dorrington's Farm House. Borrowing a saddle he unhitched a horse and circled back around to Uralla; raising the alarm with the police at 4pm.SRNSW 1/2326.2 File 76/2239 No.70/4440 The Magisterial Inquiry into Thunderbolt's death was held at Blanch's Inn; in order to slow the decomposition of the body Thunderbolt's innards were removed and buried in the yard of the Inn.  Description  There are few extant remains associated with Blanch's Royal Oak Inn. A flagstone associated with a doorway is found within the paddock. The remains of the cellar are also evident. Other archaeological and landscape remnants may provide evidence of the site's previous use. Introduced tree species including roses are growing adjacent to the site and may be associated with the site's former use.  Condition  The archaeological potential of the site is considered high; the archaeological resource does not appear to have been greatly disturbed. Blanch's Royal Oak Inn is no longer extant. The intactness of the archaeological resource is unknown.  Heritage listing  The site of the former Blanch's Royal Oak Inn is significant for its associations with Captain Thunderbolt and the pivotal role it was to play in his death. The story associated with the Inn illustrates Thunderbolt's practice of holding the occupants of the hotel hostage while robbing them. This habit of holding hostages and engaging in parties with those hostages is seen throughout Thunderbolt's career. The events of the afternoon of 25 May 1870 represent two conflicting societal views of bushrangers at the time: the gentleman bushranger generally supported by the community (as evidenced by the fact that it has been reported the publican's wife raised the alarm that the police were coming); and the criminal to be brought to justice (as evidenced by the actions of the hawker Giovanni Cappisotti and the young drover Coghlan/Coughlan, who forced the fleeing Thunderbolt away from the road towards Kentucky Creek, who were actively involved with his capture). Although no longer extant, the site of Blanch's Royal Oak Inn is representative of the type of place targeted by bushrangers in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Captain Thunderbolt Sites - Blanch's Royal Oak Inn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 July 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site of Blanch's Royal Oak Inn contributes to the significance of The Captain Thunderbolt Sites as it demonstrates the type of place targeted by bushrangers in the latter half of the nineteenth century and was the site of his last robbery. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site of the Royal Oak Inn contributes to the State significance of the Captain Thunderbolt Sites as the site of his last robbery which directly led to his death. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Does not fulfil this criterion. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Does not fulfil this criterion. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Although the archaeological resources is not likely to be of State significance of itself, the remains are likely to be able to provide information on the use and functioning of a nineteenth century inn site. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Does not fulfil this criterion. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The site of Blanch's Inn contributes to the State significance of The Captain Thunderbolt Sites because it is representative of the type targeted by bushrangers in the latter half of the nineteenth century. It represents Captain Thunderbolt's habit of engaging in parties with hostages which occurred throughout his career with specific instances reported in the press at Quirindi, Carroll and Millie.

It also assists other Brazilian local communities to care for their local urban parks. Until 2017, the organization provided nearly $1.5 million in aid to support Ibirapuera Park through restoration and volunteer work by its members and donors, contributions from Park-area residents, corporations and foundations.  History  In late 2010, a few determined members of Ibirapuera Park Management Council did not seemed satisfied with municipality lack of capital to restore and care for the park, and started to seek donations and private support to foster CAPEX projects. By 2014, Parque Ibirapuera Conserva√ß√£o was founded following the steps' of Central Park Conservancy to function as a private partner at engaging it's neighborhood into a local and pioneering project to professionalize stewardship through civil society. Until 2017, PIC major works in Ibirapuera Park included the Reading Grove restoration, upgraded a part of its irrigation system, research and conservation actions, volunteer engagement, and created interpretive programs.  Parks Concession  In 2017, the city of S√£o Paulo announced that Ibirapuera Park would be part of a large municipal concession program, as Parque Ibirapuera Conserva√ß√£o initiatives had become a key piece of urban parks' transformation, and raised public and political interest to delegate the entire parks management into private hands. The concession took longer that the municipality envisaged, and PIC acted as a key influencer guaranting a prior development of an update master plan for the park. It argued that no matter what model the municipality choose to adopted to manage its parks, the control should remain public.

Description In the foreground of the lower third of the picture, three children are standing on a green-brown meadow: a boy, with the string in his hand, looks up at his kite, another boy with a kite under his arm follows his gaze, while a girl with a doll stands with her back to the viewer. The small group is approached by a woman with four other children on a snaking, earthy brown path. Only hinted can be seen on the meadow in the background other people and beyond, on the horizon line, the church and the houses of a city. Angelika Wesenberg believes that the Theresienwiese, Spitzweg's place of residence in Munich, can be recognized in the meadow.Vgl. S. 110. The upper two thirds of the painting are dominated by the light blue, a cloudless sky, in which three kite dragons can be seen as small spots. Analysis During his review of the Spitzweg exhibition held in the Haus der Kunst in 2003, art critic Benedikt Erenz explained that Kites is one of the most beautiful pictures of Spitzweg, because the painter \\"releases the colors and lets them tell their own story... He transformed a banal scene into an eternal view over childhood\\". The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, on October 17, 2008, described the painting as \\"huge\\", despite its small size. The lower third of the picture shows \\"earthly life\\", the upper two thirds a \\"truly infinite sky\\", and the dragon is a \\"magical, if not sacred object, an extraterrestrial appearance\\". It remains the painter's secret where the wind necessary for kite flying comes from if the sky is completely clear.Vgl. Art historian Angelika Wesenberg refers in the catalog of the Alte Nationalgalerie that the simple (horizontal) composition is daringly broken through by the vertical path and the kite line.

They provided an entertainment by sparring on stage. Freeman accompanied Caunt to England where he continued his boxing exhibitions. He achieved fame when he was matched in two prizefights with William Perry (the Tipton Slasher). Despite not being trained as a bare-knuckle boxer he drew one fight and won the second bout. He remained in England as an entertainer until his early death of consumption in 1845. Early life Charles Freeman was born on 16 July 1821 in New York City. His family moved to Illinois when he was aged 3 but then moved to St Joseph, Michigan. He grew up on a farm where he reached a remarkable size. He moved to the East Coast at the age of 19, first to New York and then Boston, where he featured as an \\"exhibit\\" in Mr Harrington's Museum. In January 1841 he was described as \\"a Hercules, and an Apollo Belvidere combined in one person\\". He was also described as being 7 feet 4 inches tall and capable of lifting a dead weight of 1500 pounds. In March 1841 it was reported: \\"the greatest man living is said to be a modern Goliah named Charles Freeman, now at Boston. He is a native of New York State, but 19 years old, measures 7 feet 3 inches in height, and weighs 300 pounds. He is double jointed, a very Sampson in strength, is well proportioned, and formed with the most perfect symmetry.\\" Meeting with Ben Caunt Ben Caunt was a famous bareknuckle boxer from England who went on tour in the US in the early 1840s, where he met Freeman. According to a letter from Caunt dated December 1841: \\"when at Philadelphia I intended taking a Southern tour, but an unexpected circumstance brought me back to New York. There appeared a challenge in the papers of New York from the Michigan Giant to me ; my friends at New York went to try to make a match with him ; they offered to back me for ten thousand dollars a side, and sent for me to return as soon as possible\\". Although there was no prizefight, the pair sparred together on stage in the US before crossing the Atlantic together, leaving for England on 19 February 1842, when it was reported that the two had departed: \\"Caunt to meet Bendigo in combat, and Freeman to astonish the English fancy with his nerve, strength and stature\\". On arrival they toured various theatres in England. Boxing career In 1842, the recently retired boxer Johnny Broome set up a bareknuckle prizefight between Freeman and William Perry (known as the \\"Tipton Slasher\\") despite the American having no experience of prizefighting. During training for the fight in November of that year, he was given a medical examination that stated his characteristics as: \\"Vital capacity, 434 cubic inches; height, 6 ft. 11¬ºin.; weight, 19 st. 5 lb.; circumference of his chest, 47 inches ; inspiratory power, 5.0 inches; expiratory power, 6.5 inches.\\" The first fight between Perry and Freeman took place on 6 December 1842 at Sawbridgeworth and was declared a draw as darkness descended on the boxers after 70 rounds of boxing. An attempt to stage a re-match a few days later on 15 December was abandoned as the authorities intervened. The re-match finally took place on 20 December of the same year, at Cliffe Marshes, Gravesend, when Freeman was declared the winner after 38 rounds as Perry dropped to the floor without being struck by his opponent. Final years and death These two bouts with the Tipton Slasher were the only recorded prize- fights undertaken by Freeman. He returned to being a circus and theatrical entertainer until his early death of consumption on 18 October 1845 at Winchester Hospital. Ben Caunt attended his funeral at a cemetery in Winchester on 23 October 1845. In June 1860, Freeman's grave was marked by a stone obelisk, about ten feet high. The stone was provided by John C. Heenan, the American bare-knuckle fighter and his fellow countryman, John Macdonald.

It is also known as Split Rock and Big Rock. The property is owned by Uralla Shire Council. It is one of a group of historic sites labelled The Captain Thunderbolt Sites for their association with bushranger Captain Thunderbolt, along with Blanch's Royal Oak Inn, Captain Thunderbolt's Death Site, and Captain Thunderbolt's Grave. Collectively, all properties were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 July 2012.  History  On 27 October 1863, less than three months after escaping from Cockatoo Island, Fred Ward and Fred Britten laid in wait for the mail at Split Rock. Due to the increase in bushranging a police escort accompanied the mail to Uralla. The bushrangers were surprised by Sergeant Stephen Gardiner and Senior Constable Reynolds.Armidale Express. 31 October 1863. A shootout ensued with the bushrangers escaping through the boggy ground of Church Gully (south of Thunderbolt's Rock). During the escape Fred Ward was shot through the back of the left knee and was later given medical assistance by a team of saw-pit men who confirmed the injury. Differing accounts were provided of who actually shot Fred Ward; Grainger or Reynolds.The Sydney Morning Herald. 2 November 1863. Seven years later Split Rock was to provide the first setting for Thunderbolt's last hold-up and final day. On the afternoon of 25 May Thunderbolt met the Blanchs at Split Rock, robbed them and then accompanied the pair back to their Inn. Thunderbolt's Rock provides an excellent vantage point to survey the surrounding countryside and in the bushranging career of Fred Ward is in the vicinity of many of his robberies. It is unknown when the name of the site was changed from Split Rock to Thunderbolt's Rock but this change reflects the connection of this site with Captain Thunderbolt both physically and within the psyche of the local community.  Description  Thunderbolt's Rock is a huge cluster of granite rocks located approximately south of Uralla on the New England Highway.  Condition  As at 5 April 2012, good, although the site is heavily covered with graffiti. The integrity of the rock is high.  Modifications and dates  There is a small carpark and picnic table located behind the rocks  Heritage listing  As at 5 April 2012, Thunderbolt's Rock (originally known as Split Rock or Big Rock) contributes to the State significance of the Captain Thunderbolt sites as one of the first sites associated with the transition of Frederick Ward from escapee to bushranger after his escape from Cockatoo Island in 1863. His attempted hold up of the mail at this site in November 1863 led to an altercation with police during which he was shot in the left knee; an event that was to prove important in his identification after his death in 1870. The shooting also is thought to have been an important formative event in the modus operandi of Captain Thunderbolt, preferring to run from, rather than face, police. Thunderbolt's Rock contributes to the State significance of the Captain Thunderbolt Sites as a site recognised by the public to be associated with Captain Thunderbolt. Captain Thunderbolt is one of New South Wale's best known bushrangers and is well known in the Uralla region of NSW. Thunderbolt's Rock is well marked and is a popular tourist destination. Thunderbolt's Rock contributes to the State significance of The Captain Thunderbolt Sites as being representative of the type of places used by bushrangers to hold up coaches and travellers. Thunderbolt's Rock is an identifiable location of a highway robbery and being a high point provides excellent views of the surrounding countryside. The majority of roadside robberies by bushrangers took place at locations without relocatable landmarks. Aesthetically Thunderbolt's Rock is an impressive landmark on the New England Highway from Uralla to Tamworth. The Captain Thunderbolt Sites - Thunderbolt's Rock was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 July 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Thunderbolt's Rock contributes to the State significance of the Captain Thunderbolt Sites as the site of the first, and last, instances of highway robbery that Captain Thunderbolt attempted. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Aesthetically Thunderbolt's Rock is of local significance as an impressive landmark on the road from Uralla to Tamworth. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Thunderbolt's Rock contributes to the State significance of the Captain Thunderbolt Sites as a site recognised by the public to be associated with Captain Thunderbolt. Captain Thunderbolt is one of the best known bushrangers who operated in New South Wales and forms a significant element to the construction of Australian identity. Thunderbolt's Rock site is well marked and is a popular tourist destination. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Thunderbolt's Rock is unusual as an easily recognisable and well documented place where a road side hold up by bushrangers took place. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Thunderbolt's Rock is of State significance as being representative of the type of places used by bushrangers to hold up coaches and travellers. Thunderbolt's Rock is an example of the type of place Captain Thunderbolt used for road side hold ups and which helped define these criminal activities as \\"bushranging\\" due to the men appearing out of the bush on horse back and then escaping into the bush with the proceeds of the robbery. Thunderbolt's Rock is an identifiable location of a highway robbery. The majority of bushranging robberies took place at locations which cannot be verified.

Schadow first produced busts of the sisters and then between 1795 and 1797 produced the full-length life-size group, initially in plaster and then in marble. The initial plaster version now stands in the Schinkelmuseum whereas the original marble group is in the Alte Nationalgalerie. Artists and the public praised the work, but it was criticised by Louise's husband and fell into neglect for ninety years. It is now held to be a masterwork of early Berlin neoclassicism alongside the same artist's quadriga for the Brandenburg Gate (1793).  Historical Context  On 24 December 1793 crown prince Frederick William III married Princess Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in the Berlin Palace. Two days later at the same place his younger brother Prince Louis married Princess Friederike, Louise's younger sister. King Frederick William II was so impressed by the beauty and youthful charm of his new daughters-in-law, who were 17 and 15 years old at that time, that he asked Schadow to portray them in sculptures.Reimar F. Lacher: Schadows Prinzessinnengruppe. Die sch√∂ne Natur, S. 24  Die Portr√§tb√ºsten  Portrait bust of princess Frederica The deliverable of the command initially was a pair of portrait busts in clay. To facilitate the modelling sessions, Schadow was given a room in a wing of the Kronprinzenpalais (Berlin) where the crown prince and his wife resided when they were in Berlin. Friederica and Prince Louis lived in a neighbouring building. She often came for modelling sessions. The contacts with Louise were more distant and the artist often had to be content to attend audiences given by the crown prince and his wife.Reimar F.

He was the military commander of a Greek revolt in Ottoman-ruled Epirus during the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1570-1573. Early years The Mormoris family was one of the noble Greek families that originated from Nauplion, southern Greece. After the Ottoman conquest of the city (1540) a branch escaped to the Venetian-controlled island of Crete.Hatzopoulos, 1993, p. 158 Various members of the family participated in the armed struggles against the Ottoman Empire. The father of Emmanuel Mormoris, Jacomo, was a cavaliere in the Venetian army and commander of the Stratioti units of Crete.Hatzopoulos, 1993, p. 159 Shortly before 1570 Emmanuel Mormoris was sent by the Venetian provveditore generale (governor- general) of Crete to Sfakia, a region in western Crete, to convince some local rebel to submit to Venetian rule. Activity in Epirus Drawing of the siege of Sopot in 1570. During the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1570-1573 Mormoris took action in the region of Epirus. As soon as military operations began, Mormoris proposed the capture of the coastal fortress of Sopot across Corfu. After a successful siege on June 7, 1570, Mormoris was appointed commander of the fortress and the surrounding region. The capture of this strategic location triggered a general revolt under the leadership of Mormoris. Soon after the anti-Ottoman movement was spread to the adjacent regions of Argyrokastron (modern Gjirokast√´r), Delvina and Parga with the military guidance of the local Greek nobility and a number of Stratioti, such as Petros Lantzas and Georgios Renesis. In addition, the inhabitants of nearby Himara also supported the uprising and submitted voluntarily to Venetian rule, while making use of the advantageous mountainous terrain of their homeland. Mormoris proceeded the siege of the coastal fortress of Nivice. After operations lasting a year, it was finally taken in spring 1571. Mormoris was assisted by his brother Zorzis Mormoris, who commanded units of Stratioti in Margariti, Santa Maura (Lefkada), and Corfu. However, due to the developments of the ongoing Ottoman- Venetian War, Venice withdrew its support to the rebels. Thus, during the Ottoman counter-offensive the revolutionaries had to lift the siege of Kardhiq. Sopot was recaptured by the Ottomans at the same year (1571). Emmanuel Mormoris was captured during the Ottoman advance and taken prisoner to Constantinople. He was released in June 1575 during a prisoner exchange between the Venetian and Ottoman authorities. Later activity At 1583 Mormoris, already promoted to colonel, was placed in command of the Venetian infantry units in Crete. In 1590-1591 he was sent to Italy to suppress the revolt of the lord of Montemarciano, Alfonso Picollomini. The latter was executed in March 1591. The following year he returned to Crete to deal with various rebellions in the island.Hatzopoulos, 1993, p. 160 In the summer of 1593 he was placed in Kefallonia where he supervised the construction of the Venetian fortress in Asos.

History and description  An early medieval Khazar fortress in Rostov Oblast near the city of Semikarakorsk was built in the late 8th - early 9th century. It was situated on the island hill near Semikarakorsk. The island itself is located at the Sal River. The fortress was a residence of Khazar Khagans on the Lower Don, and it was four times larger than the -- a well-known fortress of the same period. In 1971-1974, archaeological excavations were carried out at the area. It was discovered that the fortress was built according to the \\"square in square\\" system, had a wall sized 215 x 200 m and a citadel inside of it measuring 85 x 80 meters. The fortified city also was of great commercial importance. The fortress and citadel with a total length of six-meter walls almost a kilometer in length was a prominent achievement of the Khazar Khaganate. The walls of the fortress and the citadel were constructed of about 2 million pieces of bricks. Raw brick of high quality was used as a building material. The dimensions of the bricks were 25 x 25 x 5 cm. The fortress walls have been preserved to the height of up to one meter, and the main tower, the donjon - up to a two-meter height. With the wall thickness of about 2 meters, the maximum height of the walls could reach 5‚Äì6 meters. Archaeologists first assumed that the houses inside the fortress were also built of raw brick, but later it turned out that there were houses of burned bricks. Because of this, it is assumed that the fortress was intended to be a residence for the Khagans: since only they lived in brick houses. In 2011, archaeologists under the leadership of Irina Arzhantseva from the Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences began studying the site of the fortress.

In front of him sits his chamber ensemble and to his rear an audience of dignitaries and noble ladies. The focus of the work is not on the music but rather on Frederick and the ambience created by the interior design, the furniture, the chandelier and candlelight and the ladies' elaborate dresses.

Painted in the late afternoon, the sun setting behind the cathedral shines through the intricate tracery of the towers, illuminating their fine detail, such as the spiral staircase and the connecting bridge. The painting is notable by virtue of the number of replica and derivative works produced, the authorship of which are a matter of debate.

The story follows seven students in particular: Isaac Andrews, Karen Jacobs, Calder McCready, Sanami Ota, Maria Ramirez, Adrian Roth, and Benjamin Stone. Illustration After James Tynion wrote The Woods, Boom Studios helped to find an artist to draw the comic. \\"We were looking at a bunch of people, but when I saw Michael [Dialynas]' character work, it made me see‚Ä¶ the characters in my head, and they had come to life in a way that was wholly them, and in that moment, it was a no brainer,\\" Tynion said. Among Dialynas' previous illustration credits are Amala's Blade (Dark Horse Comics, 2012), Trinkets: An Attic Full of Stories (Comicdom Press, 2011), and Swan Songs: Fleeting Feathers (Comicdom Press, 2010). Reception In 2016, the Young Adult Library Services Association named The Woods the \\"Best Graphic Novel for Young Adults\\" of the year. In 2017, GLAAD awarded Tynion the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book for his work on The Woods. The Woods was renominated in 2018; that year, it was one of three Tynion stories to be nominated. Television adaptation US television channel Syfy began developing a series based on the comic, but the project stalled. The screen adaptation was written by Michael Armbruster, and episodes were to be produced and directed by Brad Peyton.

In 1834 Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia saw an oil sketch on the subject by Lessing in 1834 and commissioned him between 1835 and 1836 to produce a full-scale version. The mainly-Catholic Rhineland had recently been annexed to the Protestant-dominated Kingdom of Prussia by the Congress of Vienna and so the work was seen as a piece of anti- Catholic propaganda for the area's Protestant minority. In the context of the Restoration of the German princes to their thrones and the Vorm√§rz, others also saw it as a criticism of the repressiveness of the states and systems put in place by Metternich and the Congress. Middle-class audiences saw it as an expression of opposition to kingly and church authority alike.

The known facts of his life are scanty. He was born in Stratford, Connecticut, in 1748, and became a druggist and physician, and practised in Southington, Connecticut, as early as 1778, so far as health would permit. Two years later he appears to have removed to Hartford. An advertisement of his firm, \\"Beardsley and Hopkins,\\" is to be found in the Connecticut Courant for June 26, 1781. In it we learn his drug store was situated \\"a few rods east of the Court House.\\" In 1782 he removed to New Haven, where he had a similar store on Chapel street, between Church and Orange streets. At the time of his death, in 1790, from consumption, he had taken his brother-in-law into partnership with him. He was one of the original members of the New Haven County Medical Association, and served on the committees of correspondence and examination. In April, 1788, he reported a case of \\"scirrhus in the pylorus of an infant,\\" which was the first case on record of congenital hypertrophy of the pylorus in an infant. It was printed with the papers of the society, which appeared in their transactions entitled: \\"Cases and Observations.\\" In this paper Beardsley noted practically every feature of the disease we now know. He had attended the patient for three years at Southington, and when her death, at the age of five years, \\"closed the painful melancholy scene\\" he performed the autopsy. He speaks of the \\"constant puking,\\" which was first noted during the first week of life. Everything in the shape of food, the child took was almost instantaneously rejected and very little changed. The feces were small in quantity. He comments upon the leanness and wizened old look of the child, and states he had \\"pronounced a scirrhosity in the pylorus months before the child's death,\\" although he first attributed the condition to a deficiency of bile and gastric juices joined with a morbid relaxation of the stomach. Unfortunately, Beardsley did not know of the child's death \\"until the second day after it took place. This late period, the almost intolerable stench, and the impatience of the people who had collected for the funeral, prevented so thorough an examination of the body as might otherwise have been made.\\" At the autopsy Beardsley noted that the stomach was unusually large and distended. \\"The pylorus was invested with a hard compact substance or scirrhosity, which so completely obstructed the passage into the duodenum as to admit with the greatest difficulty the finest fluid.\\" Category:1748 births Category:1790 deaths Category:American physicians ","title":"Hezekiah Beardsley"},{"id":"57834265","text":"Andrei may refer to: * Andrei (surname) * Andrei (given name) * Andrei of Polotsk ( - 1399), Lithuanian nobleman ","title":"Andrei"},{"id":"57834281","text":"Jin Yujia (; born 6 February 1997) is a Singaporean badminton player.

Historiography in North Macedonia is the methodology of historical studies used by the historians of that country. It has been developed since 1945 when SR Macedonia became part of Yugoslavia. According to Stefan Troebst it has preserved nearly the same agenda as the Marxist historiography from the times of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.Stefan Troebst, Historical Politics and Historical 'Masterpieces' in Macedonia before and after 1991, New Balkan Politics, 2003. The generation of Macedonian historians closely associated with the Yugoslav period who worked on the actual national myths of that time are still in charge of the institutions. In fact, in the field of historiography, Yugoslav communism and Macedonian nationalism are closely related.Roumen Daskalov, Diana Mishkova as ed., Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Two: Transfers of Political Ideologies and Institutions, BRILL, 2013, , p. 499. According to Ulf Brunnbauer, modern Macedonian historiography is highly politicized, because the Macedonian nation-building process is still in development. Diverging approaches are discouraged and people who express alternative views risk economic limitations, failure of academic career and stigmatization as \\"national traitors\\".Ulf Brunnbauer, \\"Serving the Nation: Historiography in the Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) after Socialism\\", Historien, Vol. 4 (2003-4), pp. 174-175. Troebst wrote already in 1983 that historical research in the SR Macedonia was not a humanist, civilizing end in itself, but was about direct political action.Morten Dehli Andreassen, June 2011; \\"If you don‚Äôt vote VMRO you‚Äôre not Macedonian\\". A study of Macedonian identity and national discourse in Skopje. Thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of Master of Arts Degree. Department of Social Anthropology, University of Bergen, p. 81. No such case of reciprocal dependence of historiography and politics has been observed in modern Europe.\\"At any rate, the beginning of the active national-historical direction with the historical ‚Äúmasterpieces‚Äù, which was for the first time possible in 1944, developed in Macedonia much harder than was the case with the creation of the neighbouring nations of the Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians and others in the 19th century. These neighbours almost completely \\"plundered\\" the historical events and characters from the land, and there was only debris left for the belated nation. A consequence of this was that first that parts of the ‚Äúplundered history‚Äù were returned, and a second was that an attempt was made to make the debris become a fundamental part of an autochthonous history. This resulted in a long phase of experimenting and revising, during which the influence of non-scientific instances increased. This specific link of politics with historiography in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia... was that this was a case of mutual dependence, i.e. influence between politics and historical science, where historians do not simply have the role of registrars obedient to orders. For their significant political influence, they had to pay the price for the rigidity of the science... There is no similar case of mutual dependence of historiography and politics on such a level in Eastern or Southeast Europe.\\" For more see: Stefan Trobest, \\"Historical Politics and Histrocial ‚ÄòMasterpieces‚Äô in Macedonia before and after 1991\\", New Balkan Politics, 6 (2003). Despite ethnic Macedonians very seldom appear in pre-20th century primary sources, recently a nation-building project was promoted to impose the deceptive idea that the Macedonian nation is the oldest on the Balkans, with an unbroken continuity from Antiquity to Modern times.Klaus Roth, Asker Kartarƒ± as authors and ed., Cultures of Crisis in Southeast Europe, Volume 2, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2017, , p. 169. Some domestic and foreign scholars have criticized this agenda of a denialist historiography, whose goal is to affirm the continuous existence of a separate Macedonian nation throughout history.Sinisa Jakov Marusic, New Statue Awakens Past Quarrels in Macedonia.

This controversial worldview is ahistorical, as it projects modern ethnic distinctions into the past.Kyril Drezov, Macedonian identity: an overview of the major claims in The New Macedonian Question with J. Pettifer as ed., Springer, 1999, , p. 55. Such an enhanced, ethnocentric reading of history contributes to the distortion of the Macedonian national identity and degrades history as an academic discipline.Irena Stefoska, Nation, Education and Historiographic Narratives: the Case of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia (1944-1990); Introduction In discussions of identities (ethnic, national, religious, gender, etc.), Fragments of the History of Macedonian Nationalism: An Introduction to the Research Problem, pp. 34-35. Under such historiographies generations of students were educated in pseudo-history.The past was systematically falsified to conceal the fact that many prominent 'Macedonians' had supposed themselves to be Bulgarian, and generations of students were taught the \\"pseudo-history\\" of the 'Macedonian nation.\\" For more see: Michael L. Benson, Yugoslavia: A Concise History, Edition 2, Springer, 2003, , p. 89.  History  The contemporary Macedonian historical narrative is rooted in communist groups active during the interwar period, especially in the 1930s, when the Comintern issued a special resolution in their support. According to them, the Macedonian nation was forged through a diÔ¨Äerentiation from the earlier Bulgarian nation. The Macedonian awakening in the 19th century took place as part of the Bulgarian National Revival, but managed to evolve separately in the early 20th century.Spyridon Sfetas, The Configuration of Slavomacedonian Identity. A Painful Evolution. Thessaloniki: Vanias, 2003. Balcanica XLVI, pp. 426-429. Reviewed by Athanasios Loupas. Those circles were, however, not the first ones to develop separate Macedonian historical interpretations. In 1892 Georgi Pulevski, the first Macedonian national activist, completed a \\"General History of the Macedonian Slavs.\\" It was only after the Second World War, however, that those writings were widely appreciated, as prior to the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia, the existence of a separate Macedonian nation was still not recognized. The gloriÔ¨Åcation of the Yugoslav partisan movement became one of the main components of the post-war Yugoslav political propaganda. As a result, the leader of the new Socialist Republic of Macedonia ‚Äì Lazar Koli≈°evski, initially proclaimed that its history has begun with the start of the communist struggle during the Second World War, while early 20th century events and organizations as the Ilinden Uprising and the IMRO were mere Bulgarian conspiracies.–ú–∏—á–µ–≤. –î. –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏—è—Ç –≤—ä–ø—Ä–æ—Å –∏ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–æ-—é–≥–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è ‚Äì 9 —Å–µ–ø—Ç–µ–º–≤—Ä–∏ 1944‚Äì1949, –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ: –°–£ –°–≤. –ö–ª. –û—Ö—Ä–∏–¥—Å–∫–∏, 1992, —Å—Ç—Ä. 91.Initially the membership in the IMRO was restricted only for Bulgarians. Its first name was \\"Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees\\", which was later changed several times. IMRO was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace (the Vilayet of Adrianople). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between 'Macedonians' and 'Bulgarians'. Moreover, as their own writings attest, they often saw themselves and their compatriots as 'Bulgarians'. All of them wrote in standard Bulgarian language.

Following direct political instructions from Belgrade, those historical studies were expanded.Stefan Troebst, \\"Die bulgarisch-jugoslawische Kontroverse um Makedonien 1967-1982\\". R. Oldenbourg, 1983, , p. 15. New Macedonian historiography held, as a central principle, that Macedonian history was distinctively different from that of Bulgaria. Its primary goal was to create a separate Macedonian national consciousness, with an \\"anti- Bulgarian\\" or \\"de-Bulgarizing\\" trend, and to sever any ties with Bulgaria.Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Archon Books, 1971, , pp. 6-7. This distinct Slavic consciousness would inspire identification with Yugoslavia. The Bitola inscription from 1016/1017. Originally exhibited in the local museum, it was locked away when Bulgarian scientists became aware of its content, confirming the Cometopuli considered their state Bulgarian.J. Pettifer ed., The New Macedonian Question, St Antony's Series, Springer, 1999, , p. 75. The first national scientific institution in this field ‚Äì the Institute for National History of the federate republic was established in 1948. The historiographic narrative in the first two decades afterwards was expanded to the early 19th century, during which, as it was believed then, was the beginning of the history of the Macedonian people. However, the personalities from the area included into the new narrative also played a significant role in the Bulgarian National Revival. This problem was solved by the Communist system with censorship, control on historical information, and manipulations.Dejan Djokiƒáas ed., Yugoslavism: Histories of a Failed Idea, 1918-1992; Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2003, , pp. 121-122. Numerous prominent activists with pro- Bulgarian sentiments from the 19th and the early 20th centuries were described as (ethnic) Macedonians. Due to the fact that in many documents of that period the local Slavic population is not referred to as \\"Macedonian\\" but as \\"Bulgarian\\", Macedonian historians argue that it was Macedonian, regardless of what is written in the records. They have also claimed that \\"Bulgarian\\" at that time was a term, not related to any ethnicity, but was used as a synonym for \\"Slavic\\", \\"Christian\\" or \\"peasant\\".Blaze Ristovski, Istorija na makedonskata nacija [History of the Macedonian Nation], Skopje, 1969, pp. 13-14. Efforts were made since the late 1960s to expand the narrative into the Middle Ages. As a result, in 1969 the first academic \\"History of the Macedonian nation\\" was published, where many historical figures from the area who had lived in the last millennium as Samuel of Bulgaria, were described as people with a \\"Macedonian (Slavic) identity\\". When the historians from the Skopje University published in 1985 their collection of documents on the struggle of the Macedonian people, they included into the excerpts of the medieval chronicles a footnote for every use of the term Bulgarian.Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Peter Lang, 2010, , p. 109. Almost all of the new historical agenda was traditionally claimed by the Bulgarian national historiography and till today it disputes the Macedonian historical readings.Tchavdar Marinov, Historiographical Revisionism and Re-Articulation of Memory in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Soci√©t√©s politiques compar√©es, issue 25, May 2010, p. 3.  Post-independence  The statute of the turn of the 20th century Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees (later IMARO/IMRO).The dogma of Macedonian historiography is that it was an ‚Äòethnic Macedonian‚Äô organisation and the acronym IMARO has been routinely abbreviated in Macedonian historiography to IMRO to avoid difÔ¨Åcult questions about the presence in the same organisations of people nowadays described as ‚Äòethnic Macedonians‚Äô from geographic Macedonia ‚Äì together with ‚Äòethnic Bulgarians‚Äô from the Vilajet of Adrianople. In this cases a present- day reality is projected wholesale into the past. For more see: Kyril Drezov, Macedonian identity: an overview of the major claims in The New Macedonian Question with J. Pettifer as ed., Springer, 1999, , p. 55. Its membership then was restricted only for Bulgarians. For that reason most modern Macedonian historians reject its authenticity.Mishkova Diana as ed., We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Central European University Press, 2009, , pp. 113-114. After the Republic of Macedonia gained independence in the late 20th century, the situation did not change significantly. Macedonian historiography did not revise much of the Yugoslav past, because almost all of its historical myths were constructed during the communist era. The reluctance for a thorough reevaluation of Yugoslav communist historiography was mainly caused by the fact that the very Macedonian nation, state and language were a result of Yugoslav communist policies, where this historiography had played a crucial role. For the mainstream local establishment, an attitude against Communist Yugoslavia is seen as anti-Macedonism.Ulf Brunnbauer, \\"Pro‚ÄêSerbians\\" vs. \\"Pro‚ÄêBulgarians\\": Revisionism in Post‚ÄêSocialist Macedonian Historiography, first published on 21 December 2005 https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00130.x Macedonian historiography became important in the early 21st century in the face of an unsure reevaluation of the Yugoslav past and of an uneasy articulation of a new anticommunist narrative. It has sought a new horizon behind the mythological symbolism of ancient Macedon. For that purpose the borders of the ancient state were extended towards the north, much further than its actual historical extent. According to this new narrative, most of the cultural achievements of the Ancient Macedonians were actually (ethnic) Macedonian and therefore, Hellenism's true name would be Macedonism. This new historical trend, called antiquization, made the Macedonian nationality a thousand years older. In this view Ancient Macedonians were not Ancient Greek people and a separate existence of Ancient Macedonians in the Early Middle Ages is maintained, 800 years after the fall of their kingdom, as well as their admixture in the Byzantine Empire with the arriving early Slavic settlers in the late 6th century. The Rosetta Stone, dated 196 BC. During the 2000s the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts promoted the view that the \\"Demotic Egyptian\\" script on it was written in a Slavic language close to modern Macedonian and that this was the language of the Ancient Macedonians.Tome Boshevski, Aristotel Tentov, Tracing the script of the Ancient Macedonians. This paper presents the results of research realized within the project \\"Deciphering the Middle Text of the Rosetta Stone\\", supported by Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 2003 ‚Äì 2005.Comparative analysis of the results of deciphering the middle text on the Rosetta stone, Tome Bo≈°evski, Aristotel Tentov, MANU, Vol 31, No 1-2 (2010) DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.20903/csnmbs.masa.2010.31.1-2.23 Plate on the church Sveta Nedela in Bitola. The inscription reads: This holy church was erected with the contribution of the Bulgarians in Bitola on October 13, 1863. The part of the inscription that reads \\"Bulgarians\\" has been erased. In 2009 the first Macedonian Encyclopedia was issued by the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. The issuance of the encyclopedia caused international and internal protest because of its content and its authors have been subjected to severe criticism. Even some Macedonian academics criticised the book as hastily prepared and politically motivated. Soon the scandalous encyclopedia was withdrawn from the bookstores. Macedonian Canadian historian Andrew Rossos has published in 2008 the first professional English language overview of the history of Macedonia, however Stefan Troebst suggests that his narrative is enough affected by the views in the R. Macedonia and thus is representing the latest developments in the Macedonian historiography as viewed in Skopje.  Alternative views  Memorial plaque of participiants in the Ilinden uprising in Malko Tarnovo. In the list are also names of revolutionaries born in Ottoman Macedonia. This part of the uprising, because it occurred on the territory of present-day Eastern Bulgaria, is denied by the historians in North Macedonia.–è–∞–±–∏—Ä –î–µ—Ä–∞–ª–∞ –∏ –ö–∏—Ä—Å—Ç–µ–Ω –®–æ–Ω–µ—Ñ–µ–ª–¥, –°–æ–æ—á—É–≤–∞—ö–µ —Å–æ —Ä–µ–∞–ª–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∞, –¶–ò–í–ò–õ-–¶–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä –∑–∞ —Å–ª–æ–±–æ–¥–∞, –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ, 2014, , p. 88. After the fall of Communism, historical revisionists in the Republic of Macedonia questioned the narrative established in Communist Yugoslavia. People such as Ivan Mikulƒçiƒá, Zoran Todorovski and Slavko Milosavlevski tried to openly oppose the popular historical myths in the Republic of Macedonia. Mikulƒçiƒá, for example, proved through archaeological evidence that there weren't any ancient Macedonians when the Early Slavs arrived in Macedonia. He also found several Bulgar settlements on the territory of the modern republic and argued the Slavs in Macedonia adopted the ethnonym Bulgarians in the 9th century. Todorovski has argued that all Macedonian revolutionaries from the early 20th century and beyond identified themselves as Bulgarians. Milosavlevski challenged the myth of the significance of the communist partisan resistance movement against the Bulgarian \\"fascistic occupiers\\" during the Second World War. Today are also some revisionist opinions in North Macedonia, the conflict during WWII there, was merely a civil war.–°—Ç–µ–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ—Å–∫–∏ –±–µ–ª–µ—à–∫–∏ –æ—Ç –¢—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–µ—Å–µ—Ç—Ç–æ—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –ß–µ—Ç–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–µ—Å–µ—Ç—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ —Å–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ –Ω–∞ –°–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞, –æ–¥—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ 17 —ò–∞–Ω—É–∞—Ä–∏ 2007 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞. Such studies became the only exception to the new Macedonian historiography, with most historians staying loyal to the political elite, writing publications appropriating the Hellenistic part of the Macedonian past, the medieval Bulgarian Empire and the Bulgarian national revival from the Ottoman period.Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996; Vol. 7 –æ—Ç Nationalisms across the globe; Peter Lang, 2010 , p. 107-108. This policy of claiming ethnic Macedonian past during Ancient, Medieval and Ottoman times is facing criticism by other academics and politicians in the country itself, such as Denko Maleski, Miroslav Grƒçev, Ljubcho Georgievski and others. It demonstrates feebleness of archaeology and historiography, as well as some kind of ethnic marginalization.Ludomir R. Lozny (2011). Comparative Archaeologies: A Sociological View of the Science of the Past. Springer, , p. 427. These intellectuals from the Macedonian elite admit that the distinct Macedonian nation is a recent phenomenon that developed in the years around the Second World War. Such views are spread among well educated citizens that search for the scientific resolution of the nation-building process. Despite significant parts of the leading establishment strongly opposing the articulation of such views, some prominent members of the elite disclose their rational views.Naoum Kaytchev, Being Macedonian: Different Types of Ethnic Identifications in the Contemporary Republic of Macedonia. ‚Äì Politeja (Krakow, Poland), ‚Ññ 30 (2014), 122‚Äì131.  Foreign historiographic studies  The mainstream European historiography maintains that the idea of separate Macedonian nation was developed mainly during the Second World War and was adopted en masse immediately after it.Naoum Kaytschev, Being Macedonian: different types of ethnic identifications in the contemporary Republic of Macedonia.

Per Carsten Wieland, Stefan Troebst sees the Macedonian nation building as an ideal example of Gellner's theory of nationalism. Since the creation of the Yugoslav Macedonia it was realized immediately.\\"National language, national literature, national history and national church were not available in 1944, but they were accomplished in a short time. The south-east-Slavic regional idiom of the area of Prilep-Veles was codified as the script, normed orthographically by means of the Cyrillic Alphabet, and taken over immediately by the newly created media. And the people have been patching up the national history ever since. Thus, they are forming more of an \\"ethnic\\" than a political concept of nation. For more, see: One Macedonia With Three Faces: Domestic Debates and Nation Concepts, in Intermarium; Columbia University; Volume 4, No. 3 (2000‚Äì2001). Whether in Antiquity the Ancient Macedonians were originally a Greek tribe or not is ultimately a redundant question according to professor of anthropology Loring Danforth.Danforth, Loring M. (1997). The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World. Princeton, Princeton University Press. , p. 169. John Van Antwerp Fine states that throughout the Middle Ages and Ottoman era modern Bulgarians and Macedonians comprised a single people.John Van Antwerp Fine, \\"The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century\\"; University of Michigan Press, 1991, , pp. 36‚Äì37. Per Bernard Lory the ethnic divergence between them occurred mainly in the first half of the 20th century.Bernard Lory, The Bulgarian-Macedonian Divergence, An Attempted Elucidation, INALCO, Paris in Developing Cultural Identity in the Balkans: Convergence Vs. Divergence with Raymond Detrez and Pieter Plas as ed., Peter Lang, 2005, , pp. 165-193. Alexander Maxwell maintains that scarcely by the middle of that century, Macedonians began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive.Alexander Maxwell, Slavic Macedonian Nationalism: From \\"Regional\\" to \\"Ethnic\\"' in Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Part 1. with Klaus Roth and Ulf Brunnbauer as ed., LIT, M√ºnster, 2008. , pp. 127-154. According to historian Eugene N. Borza, the Macedonians, who are a recently emergent people and have had no history, are in search of their past. This search is an attempt to help legitimize their unsure present, surviving in the disorder of Balkan politics.Eugene N. Borza, Macedonia Redux in The Eye Expanded: Life and the Arts in Greco-Roman Antiquity with Frances B. Titchener, and Richard F. Moorton as ed. University of California Press, 1999, , p. 259. Anthropologist Ivaylo Dichev claims that the Macedonian historiography has the impossible task of filling in the huge gaps between the ancient kingdom of Macedon that collapsed in the 2nd century BC, the 10th-11th century state of the Cometopuli, and Yugoslav Macedonia, established in the middle of the 20th century.Dichev, Ivaylo, Eros Identiteta, In: Du≈°an Bjeliƒá, Obrad Saviƒá (eds.), Balkan kao metafora: izmeƒëu globalizacije i fragmentacije. Beograd: Beogradski krug, 2003, pp. 269-284. Despite the myths of national purity and continuity that came to dominate the official Macedonian historiography, something not unusual for the Balkan region, Ipek Yosmaoglu affirms there is not much to be gained from a search for a Macedonian national lineage, because the Macedonian nationhood was shaped mainly in the decades following World War II.ƒ∞pek Yosmaoƒülu, Blood Ties: Religion, Violence and the Politics of Nationhood in Ottoman Macedonia, 1878‚Äì1908, Cornell University Press, 2013, , p. 16.  Recent developments  Surveys on the effects of the controversial nation-building project Skopje 2014 and on the perceptions of the population of Skopje revealed a high degree of uncertainty regarding the latter's national identity. A supplementary national poll showed that there was a great discrepancy between the population's sentiment and the narrative the state sought to promote.Muhiƒá, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In Etnolo≈°ka tribina 44 (37), p. 144. According to F.A.K. Yasamee, the Macedonians are a striking instance of the mutability of national identity.F.A.K. Yasamee, Nationality in the Balkans: The case of the Macedonians in Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order, Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121-132. Recently the Macedonian political elite seems interested in a debate about the national historical narrative with Bulgaria and Greece. With respect to the Macedonian narrative, both Greek and Bulgarian historiographies have questioned the Macedonian historiography's factual basis, because it was constructed to come into conflict with the former two. Per Michael R. Palairet in the three-way dispute about Macedonia, the Bulgarian view is closer to the objective reality of history than either the Greek or Macedonian, but the Macedonian historiographical version violates common sense and the historical record much more than either the Greek or Bulgarian ones.Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History (Vol. 1, From Ancient Times to the Ottoman Invasions), Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016, , p. 16. The governments of Bulgaria and Macedonia signed a friendship treaty to bolster the complicated relations between the two Balkan states in August 2017. On its ground a joint commission on historical and educational issues was formed in 2018. This intergovernmental commission is a forum where controversial historical issues will be raised and discussed, to resolve the problematic readings of history. In June 2018, Greece and Macedonia also signed an agreement to end their long disputes, which resulted in Macedonia being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia in February 2019. It also provides for the creation of a commission similar to that of the treaty signed with Bulgaria. In an interview given in 2019, the co-president of the joint historical commission with Bulgaria from the Macedonian side - prof. Dragi Karev, has appealed that it is necessary to acknowledge, there have been made a forgeries from the Macedonian side. Thus, instead of \\"Bulgarian\\" as in the original artifacts, in the Macedonian textbooks was written \\"Macedonian\\". According to him, for many years the historiography in North Macedonia has been a function of the process of nation-building.–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ. –î—Ä–∞–≥–∏ –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–µ–≤: –î–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–µ–º, —á–µ –µ –∏–º–∞–ª–æ –∏ —Ñ–∞–ª—à–∏—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ä–∞–Ω–µ - –≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–æ \\"–±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω\\" —Å–∞ –ø–∏—Å–∞–ª–∏ \\"–º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–µ—Ü\\"- —Ç–æ–≤–∞ –µ –∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞—Ç–∞.

However, with nationalism in the three countries rising, there are still Greek and Bulgarian scholars who claim a Macedonian nation did not exist until the middle of the 20th century and therefore could not exist in the present. In Skopje, meanwhile, there are growing concerns that the negotiations with the country's neighbors over its history may jeopardize the Macedonian government or even lead to violence and internal clashes. In the early October 2019, Bulgaria has set a lot of tough terms for North Macedonia's EU progress. The Bulgarian government accepted an ultimate \\"Framework Position\\", where has warned that Bulgaria will not allow the EU integration of North Macedonia to be accompanied by European legitimization of an anti-Bulgarian ideology, sponsored by Skopje authorities. In the list are more than 20 demands and a timetable to fulfill them, during the process of North Macedonia's accession negotiations. It states that the rewriting of the history of part of the Bulgarian people after 1944 was one of the pillars of the bulgarophobic agenda of then Yugoslav communism. Bulgarian National Assembly voted on 10 October and approved this \\"Framework Position\\" put forward by the government on the EU accession of North Macedonia.Sinisa Jakov Marusic, Bulgaria Sets Tough Terms for North Macedonia‚Äôs EU Progress Skopje.

It gathers annually dozens of heads of States and Governments, heads of International Organizations, leaders from the civil society and the private sector, as well as thousands of individuals from all around the globe. The Paris Peace Forum complete the existing world agenda of multilateral gatherings by creating a specific event for global governance issues, as economic and financial issues are dealt at the World Economic Forum of Davos, and security issues at the Munich Security Conference. The Forum's DNA is to be an inlcusive, solution-oriented gathering : with this in mind, the Forum showcases each year more than 100 projects coming from all around the world which display concrete and efficient solutions to governance challenges. It mostly focus on concrete initiatives and has been used as a platform for the launch of important, multi-actor initiatives, such as the B4IG coalition or the Paris Call for Trust and Security in the Cyberspace. The Paris Peace Forum was founded in 2018 by Justin Va√Øsse, as he was Director for Policy Planning at the French ministry for Europe and foreign Affairs, to tackle global problems and strengthen multilateral cooperation. Soon after the first edition, Pascal Lamy was appointed President of the Paris Peace Forum, and Justin Va√Øsse became its Director General. On 11-13 November 2020, its third edition will be chiefly devoted to the multi-actor response to Coronavirus, with the conviction that all relevant actors can collectively overcome the enormous challenges faced by the international community and use the crisis as an opportunity to rebuild a more sustainable world.  History  The Paris Peace Forum was born out of the principle that ‚Äúa badly governed world would quickly become a world at war‚Äù, as explained by Justin Va√Øsse, then president of the Forum. At the Meeting of Ambassadors on 29 August 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke of the fact that peace is not something to be taken for granted, mentioning the Syrian crisis and the Ukrainian crisis as examples. In light of such developments, he called for the need to take concrete steps to strengthen multilateralism and preserve peace. President Macron then announced the creation of the Paris Peace Forum on 4 January 2018.  First edition : 2018  The first edition of the Paris Peace Forum took place on 11‚Äì13 November 2018, and was attended by 65 Heads of States and Governments. It showcased 120 global governance projects and welcomed 6000 individuals over the 3 days. Among the attendees were Russian President Vladimir Putin, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and 2018 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nadia Murad. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres, joined President Emmanuel Macron in each making an opening remark at the beginning of the Forum. UN Secetary General Guterres drew parallels between the political atmosphere then and the pre-World War I period and the ‚Äò30s Interwar period. Merkel made similar remarks, noting that nationalism and populism were threatening European peace. What was noted was also US President‚Äôs Donald Trump‚Äôs absence at the Forum, despite having been in Paris in the morning of 11 November for the commemoration ceremony on the Champs- Elys√©es. The commemoration of Armistice day was a recurring theme throughout the Forum. President Macron aimed for the Forum to bring about concrete proposals for multilateralism so that an outcome akin to WWI would not replicate again. It was noted multiple times that the importance of remembering the Armistice stood in the comparisons that could be drawn between the 1930s and today. Similarly to the statements made by UN Secretary General Guterres, Justin Va√Øsse also highlighted the similarities, including: an economic crisis, closing of borders, commercial wars, migration and refugees, and a resurgence of populist and nationalist movements. The three day event presented a variety of formats, including debates, panels, round tables, masterclasses, workshops, project pitches, as well as a hackathon during which developers worked on financial data transparency programs. BrainDates from C2 Montreal was also present at the Forum to provide peer-to-peer learning sessions and small discussion groups for the attendees and the project leaders. At the center of the Grande Halle de la Villette was the Peace Library, a tree-shaped shelf structure on which Heads of Governments and States each placed a book from their country that for them symbolised peace and international cooperation. The overarching theme of the event was multilateralism: its importance as well as its shortcomings. President of the Republic of Niger, Mahamadou Issoufou denounced the double standards of multilateralism, pointing out that African leaders do not have as strong a voice in the international scene despite multilateral decisions concerning Africa occupying a significant space in the agendas of international institutions. Among the other themes that were tackled were social inequality, with speakers such as Guy Rider, Lise Kingo and Jeffrey Sachs; the role of cities in the fight against climate, with experts like Laurence Tubiana and Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim who spoke of its effects in the Sahel and more. The Forum also hosted the Declaration on Information and Democracy by Reporters Without Borders, with the presence of the heads of states of Burkina Faso, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Norway, Senegal, Switzerland and Tunisia. The Paris Call : 51 countries, 130 companies and 90 universities and non-governmental groups signed the ‚ÄòParis Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace‚Äô, a non binding declaration initiated by President Macron, calling for protection from cyber attacks. It aims to protect civilians, to keep external actors from interfering with elections, to preserve intellectual property etc. The US was one of the few Western nations who refused to sign the declaration. The Paris Call has been likened to a digital version of the Geneva Convention and praised as an important step for democracy. Brad Smith, president of Microsoft noted for the New York Times that ‚ÄúMost of the world‚Äôs democracies are rallying around the need to protect all democracies from cyberattacks‚Äù. Projects : 120 projects advancing concrete solutions were presented during the 3 day event in one of the following categories: environment, peace and security, development, new technologies and inclusive economy. Out of them, 10 were selected by the jury to receive support for a one-year period. = Notable Participants to the first edition = {  ! colspan=\\"2\\" Africa - Ahmed Ouyahia - Former Prime Minister of Algeria Fayez al-Sarraj - Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya - Roch Marc Christian Kabor√© - President of Burkina Faso Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta - President of Mali - Faustin-Archange Touad√©ra - President of the Central African Republic Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz - President of Mauritania - Azali Assoumani - President of the Comoros Mahamadou Issoufou - President of Niger - Denis Sassou-Nguesso - President of the Congo Muhammadu Buhari - President of Nigeria - Alassane Ouattara - President of Ivory Coast Paul Kagame - President of Rwanda - Isma√Øl Omar Guelleh - President of Djibouti Macky Sall - President of Senegal - Alpha Cond√© - President of Guinea Danny Faure - President of Seychelles - Uhuru Kenyatta - President of Kenya Idriss D√©by - President of Chad - George Weah - President of Liberia Beji Caid Essebsi - Former President of Tunisia - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Americas -  colspan=\\"2\\" Justin Trudeau - Prime Minister of Canada -  colspan=\\"2\\" Carlos Alvarado - President of Costa Rica -  colspan=\\"2\\" Iv√°n Duque M√°rquez - President of Colombia -  colspan=\\"2\\" Donald Trump - President of United States - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Asia - Nikol Pashinyan - Prime Minister of Armenia Rami Hamdallah - Former Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority - Giorgi Margvelashvili - Former President of Georgia Cheikh Tamim Ben Hamad Al Thani - Emir of Qatar - Saad Hariri - President of Lebanon Shukurjon Zuhurov - Chairman of the Lower Chamber of Parliament of Tajikistan - Venkaiah Nadu - Vice President of India Prayut Chan-o-cha - Prime Minister of Thailand - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Europe - Ilir Meta - President of Albania Gjorge Ivanov - Former President of North Macedonia - Alexander Van der Bellen - President of Austria Igor Dodon - President of Molodva - Bakir Izetbegoviƒá - Former Bosniak Member of the tripartite Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Albert de Monaco - Prince of Monaco - Roumen Radev - President of Bulgaria Milo ƒêukanoviƒá - President of Montenegro - Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá - President of Croatia Stef Blok - Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands - Andrej Babi≈° - Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Erna Solberg - Prime Minister of Norway - Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen - Prime Minister of Denmark Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa - President of Portugal - Kersti Kaljulaid - President of Estonia Klaus Iohannis - President of Romania - Sauli Niinist√∂ - President of Finland Vladimir Putin - President of Russia - Emmanuel Macron - President of France Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá - President of Serbia - Angela Merkel - Chancellor of Germany Andrej Kiska - Former President of Slovakia - Alexis Tsipras - Former Prime Minister of Greece Borut Pahor - President of Slovenia - Pietro Parolin - Cardinal Secretary of State of Holy SEE Pedro Sanchez - Prime Minister of Spain - Gu√∞ni Th.

The Paris Peace Forum 2019 was attended by 7,000 participants, representing 164 nationalities. 33 Heads of State and Government were present, with official delegations from 140 countries. 318 project leaders representing 114 governance solutions from around the world gathered in the Forum's Space for Solutions. Secretary General of the United Nations, Ant√≥nio Guterres, Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, and President of the Paris Peace Forum, Pascal Lamy, spoke during the event's soft opening on 11 November. UN Secretary general Guterres evoked the main global challenges of our times, by distinguishing five global risks: an economic and geostrategic polarization, a crack of the social contract caused by rising inequalities and protests, the loss of solidarity between communities and the rise of hate as a political tool, environmental degradation and the climate crisis, and finally, the risk of unchecked technology. The official opening ceremony took place on 12 November. Opening remarks were made by President of the French Republic, Emmanuel Macron, the President-Elect of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, F√©lix Tshisekedi and the Vice-President of the People's Republic of China, Wang Qishan. The second edition of the Paris Peace Forum saw a number of new activities and formats, such as the Peace Game, organized by Foreign Policy and K√∂rber Stiftung. A Peace Game brings together participants with the purpose of working out a crisis scenario through concrete solutions. Among the other formats participants were invited to attend, the '20 Questions to the World', and Braindates by e180, were particularly successful. For this second edition, last year's Peace Library, which gathered books gifted by high-level participants, took the form of a Peace Globe, where world leaders were given the opportunity to leave objects symbolizing peace in. Nine initiatives were launched and developed at the second edition of the Paris Peace Forum. These included B4IG, which started out at the G7 Leaders' Summit in Biarritz, and which is driven by Emmanuel Macron, the OECD and Danone in order to unite companies for inclusive growth. The Alliance for Multilateralism, launched in April 2019 by French and German Foreign Ministers, held a session on the governance of the digital sphere, which was moderated by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian. Other initiatives included the inauguration of the Reporters Without Borders Forum on Information and Democracy, and the launch of the Indian Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, driven by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  Philosophy  The purpose of the Forum would be to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day, as well as to ‚Äúreflect together, propose concrete initiatives, reinvent multilateralism and all forms of contemporary cooperation‚Äù. President Macron and then-president Justin Va√Øsse aimed at bringing together global governance actors, in an international and open space, in order to interact, discuss and generate concrete solutions. An important aspect of the Forum is the showcasing of 100+ projects from around the world. Each of these projects proposes an innovative solution to a specific issue. The projects present in 6 of the following categories: * Peace & Security * Development *Inclusive economy *New technologies * Environment * Culture & Education By the third day of the Forum, 10 projects are selected as Scale-Up projects to receive mentorship and support from the Paris Peace Forum for a one-year period. Although initiated by the French President, the Forum remains independent in its scope and funding. The event is financed by non-governmental partners, each of which cannot cover more than 10% of the costs.  Organisation  The Paris Peace Forum is made up of 3 distinct governance bodies: * The Executive Committee oversees and decides on the overall activities of the Forum. It is made up of representatives of the Forum‚Äôs eight Founding Members which are: the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Institut fran√ßais des relations internationales (Ifri), the Institut Montaigne, the K√∂rber Foundation, M√©xico Eval√∫a, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS), and Sciences Po. Pascal Lamy, Board member of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, leads the Executive Committee as president of the Paris Peace Forum. * The Steering Committee determines the strategy of the Forum, and is made of up sixteen international experts of global governance. The President of the Steering Committee is Trisha Shetty,and the Vice President is Igor Yurgens. The other members of the Steering Committee are: ** Fauziya Abdi AIi, Founder and President of Women in International Security ** Haifa Dia Al- Attia, Vice President for Growth and Regional Expansion of Luminus Education and CEO Luminus Plus ** Zhimin Chen, Vice President and Professor at Fudan University ** Renato Flores, Member of the Board of Getulio Vargas Foundation **Patrick Gaspard, President of the Open Society Foundation **Kristalina Georgieva, Chief Executive Offiver of the World Bank ** Vasu Gounden, Founder and Executive Director of the African Center for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes ** Rouba Mhaissen, Founder and Director of Sawa Foundation ** Stewart Patrick, Director of the International Institutions and Global Governance Program Council on Foreign Relations ** Gabriela Ramos, Chief of Staff and Sherpa of OECD **Kenichiro Sasae, President of the Japan Institute of International Affairs ** Martin Tsin√©, Managing Director of Luminate **Yenny Wahid, Director of the Wahid Institute ** Huiyao (Henry) WANG, Founder and President of Center for China and Globalization *The Circle of Partners which is made up of private actors who support the Forum. These are the benefactors, the institutional partners and the media partners. The activities of the Forum are also carried out by: * The Permanent Secretariat, based in Paris, carries out all operations related to the execution of the event. It is led by Justin Va√Øsse as Director-General, and Marc Reverdin as Secretary- General. * The Selection Committee is responsible for selecting the 100+ projects that are to present at the Forum in November. They select the projects based on their relevance to the issue they are aiming to resolve, how innovative they are, the potential to scale up etc. * The Scale-up Committee is responsible for accompanying the selected Scale-Up projects for the full year until the next Forum. Each member of the Scale-Up Committee is an expert in a particular field of global governance and thus serves as a point of reference for one of the ten projects.  Criticisms  The Paris Peace Forum faced criticism for having extended an invitation to Saudi Arabia, in light of journalist Jamal Khashoggi‚Äôs murder and the continuing war in Yemen. Due to similar such contradictions, such as France‚Äôs involvement in weapons sales, and nuclear armament, questions were raised as to the extent to which the peace summit was truly substantial or just an instrument of communication. Criticism was also drawn to the event‚Äôs funding, with contributions made, among others, by tech giants such as Google and Microsoft. Some also argued that the Forum was homogenous in its discussion, reserved for the elites who agreed with each other rather than including those who disagreed with multilateralism.

After releasing two records of folk and country- inspired music, she released a pop-rock album Loner in 2018. Her most recent album, Superstar, was released on March 6, 2020. History Born in 1989 in Long Island, Rose grew up in Center Moriches, New York. The daughter of two artists, Rose began writing songs and poems at age 13. Rose attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she graduated in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in architecture. In 2012, a 22-year-old Caroline Rose and producer/multi- instrumentalist Jer Coons launched a Kickstarter to fund the production of a Rose's first album, America Religious. The campaign exceeded its goal of $8000, eventually raising $10,115. The album, blending American folk music, country, and rockabilly styles was self-published later that year. Two years later, Rose released her first nationally distributed album, I Will Not Be Afraid on Little Hi! Records. Like the first album, it was produced with Jer Coons and featured music in a variety of Americana musical styles, including two songs previously released on America Religious. Following the release of I Will Not Be Afraid, Rose took an extended hiatus from touring and releasing new material, while she explored new musical directions that would broaden her sound. After three years, numerous personnel changes, and a switch to New West Records, Rose released her third album. The new album, Loner, was co-produced by Rose and Paul Butler, and represented a radical shift away from the musical style of her previous work, blending pop and alternative rock elements, and incorporating prominent synthesizers throughout. Notably, this album also saw a change in lyrical tone, incorporating a number of overtly humorous, sarcastic, and satirical songs. Although Rose played most of the instruments on the album, she formed a new band to perform on tour. On January 7, 2020, Rose announced a new album called Superstar, releasing a single and a music video for the song \\"Feel The Way I Want\\". The single was accompanied by a video, shot entirely on the iPhone. According to Rose, the album is a \\"cinematic pop album that tells a story of someone who leaves behind everything they (gen neutral) know and love in search for something bigger and more glamorous. It‚Äôs a story about losing yourself but also finding the brazen self-confidence to follow a dream.\\" The album Superstar was released on March 6, 2020, Caroline Rose made her television debut on February 24, 2020 performing \\"Feel The Way I Want\\" on Late Night with Seth Meyers.

The league was not sanctioned by any outside hockey governing body, but was structured as a \\"free-to-play\\" junior league similar to USA Hockey's Tier I and Tier II as opposed to the \\"pay-to-play\\" Tier III leagues.  History  The league announced its formation in March 2018, founded by former El Paso Buzzards owner Bill Davidson and former Western Professional Hockey League founder Rick Kozuback. The league named former Salmon Arm Silverbacks general manager Troy Mick as its first president. The USACHL announced it was planning a sixty-game regular season schedule that lasts from October until March. The league was initially planned to consist of six teams, targeting cities associated with the defunct Central Hockey League (CHL), for its inaugural 2018‚Äì19 season featuring players under twenty-years-old. The first two teams were announced in Laredo and Hidalgo, Texas, both teams sharing branding with former CHL teams, the Laredo Bucks and Rio Grande Valley Killer Bees. The third announced was in Wichita Falls, Texas, and were named the Wichita Falls Force through a naming contest. Wichita Falls had gone without a hockey team for one season after the North American Hockey League's Wichita Falls Wildcats ceased operations in 2017. However, with the announced October season start date approaching, the league announced at the end of August a fourth and final 2018‚Äì19 team called the Texas Lawmen to be based in McAllen, Texas. The league stated it was purchasing the Frio Grande Valley Ice Center as the Lawmen's home arena and would renovate the building. The league played its first game on October 26, 2018, when the Rio Grande Valley Killer Bees defeated the Laredo Bucks. After the opening week, several games were postponed due to rink availability or arena issues. Within the first month of play, USACHL president Troy Mick, along with the original four original head coaches all departed from the league. The sale of the Frio Grande Valley Ice Center fell through, forcing the team to use the nearby Killer Bees home venue for scheduled home games. The Lawmen's first few games also did not allow spectators in the arena as there was not enough time for the arena to advertise the game in order to sell tickets. On November 14, 2018, all league operated social media sites were shut down or deleted. The league stated they believed a disgruntled or unpaid employee had taken over the sites and the league was working on reclaiming them. By November 17, the social media sites had still not been reclaimed and were eventually renamed, with the league creating new Twitter accounts for the USACHL and for the affected teams. During the November 23 game of the Bucks at the Wichita Falls Force, the team issued handouts to the attendees continuing to blame the unpaid employee for taking the social media sites, but stated the league is continuing operations regardless. By the November 23 game between the Killer Bees and Lawmen, the teams played a three- on-three showcase due to lack of players. The following week on November 29, the Lawmen were down to only three players, the second coaching staff all resigned, and the team ceased operations. On November 30, the Wichita Falls home game against the Killer Bees was cancelled citing bus scheduling issues. However, the city of Wichita Falls announced they had actually locked out the Force from the arena due to late payments and the December 1 and 2 games were also cancelled. On December 1, the Wichita Falls billet families for the players announced the rest of the players were leaving and the Force had folded. On December 3, parents of players for the Laredo Bucks announced their kids were leaving the team. On December 7, the league cancelled the remainder of the season. The league management later issued a press release claiming \\"business interference\\" as the reason for the league's suspension and that the league would return in the 2019‚Äì20 season, which did not happen.

Its mass is 3.216 Jupiters, it takes 4.2 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.05425 AU from it. It was discovered on June 12, 2017 and was announced in 2018. Its discoverers were 23, namely Daniel Bayliss, Joel Hartman, George Zhou, Gaspar √Å. Bakos, Andrew Vanderburg, J. Bento, L. Mancini, S. Ciceri, Rafael Brahm, Andres Jord√°n, N. Espinoza, M. Rabus, T. G. Tan, K. Penev, W. Bhatti, M. de Val-Borro, V. Suc, Z. Csubry, Th. Henning, P. Sarkis, J. L√°z√°r, I. Papp, P. S√°ri.  Overview  The exoplanet HATS-36 b which orbits the star HATS-36 is located about 3186.5 light-years (977.0 pc) away from Solar System. It is situated in the constellation of Sagittarius. The host star HATS-36 has apparent magnitude of 14.4, with absolute magnitude of 4.4. The surface temperature is 5970 K with its spectral types of G0V class. In this planetary system, the extra-solar planet orbits around the star HATS-36 every 4.17524 days with its orbital distance of 0.05 AU (7913727.4 km).  Discovery  After the discovery of the HATS-36 b, or its another alias name EPIC 215969174 b, it became one of the 25 HATSouth candidates on Campaign 7 of the K2 mission. It detects that the exoplanet, a hot Jupiter-like planet with a mass of 2.790.40 MJ and a radius of 1.2630.045 RJ, transits a solar-type G0V star (V = 14.386) in a 4.17524 days period. The planetary system of HATS-36 is classified as an eclipsing binary system based on a combination of the HATSouth data, the K2 data, and follow-up ground-based photometry and spectroscopy.  Discussion  HATS-36 b has a typical orbital period of 4.1752379 ¬± 0.0000021 days and has a density of 2.12 ¬± 0.20 g/cm3. Its star is active, which can be seen and manifested in both the variability in the LC and the high jitters in the radial velocity measurements. Due to its high mass compared with the known population of hot Jupiters, HATS-36 b lies in a relatively sparsely populated region of the mass-density relationship for gas giant exoplanets. However, its bulk density fits well on the mass-density sequence of the related exoplanets.

It was on the eastern side of the River Ure, so as such, was actually in Burton-on-Ure. The line operated between 1875 and 1931 for passenger traffic, but was retained for minimal freight train use until 1963. History Masham station opened on the same day as the line did, with services commencing on 9 June 1875. The population at the time of opening was just over 3,600, but the station retained healthy outward traffic in the form of timber and livestock. The station was located on the left bank of the River Ure, away from Masham in the neighbouring parish of Burton-on-Ure rather than across the river in Masham itself. In 1901, a narrow gauge railway was built for the purposes of constructing reservoirs in Colsterdale, which meant that a section of railway then went north from the station crossing the river, but it bypassed the town of Masham to the north. The station area had a single-road locomotive shed which stabled the one steam engine used on the four daily out and back workings to . After closure to passengers, the branch was normally worked by a locomotive from Starbeck Shed in Harrogate. When Starbeck shed closed in 1959, the branch was worked by an engine from . In October 1908, an over laden train ran through the station and across the Melmerby to Masham road (now the A6108) and into the narrow gauge exchange yard just north of the road. The wagons were badly damaged, but there were no injuries or deaths. The driver had lost control on the 1-in-61 gradient into the station's goods yard. The station was closed to passengers in January 1931, but continued receiving deliveries of small amounts of goods traffic until 1963. The issue of the railway being open just to deliver coal to the stationmasters and fresh water to the crossing keeper's cottages was raised in Parliament by the MP for Darlington at that time. The station buildings are now private dwellings and the goods shed has since been converted into a cafe and gallery. A blue plaque adorns the side of the good shed commemorating the Leeds Pals, who arrived by train at Masham station in September 1914 and marched up to Colsterdale to begin their training for war.

Located on parts of Hopson, Pine Tree, and Spring Pond Roads, it is one of best collections of this type in the state. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. Description and history The state of Vermont has not historically been a place where modern architecture found a receptive home. The eastern town of Norwich, influenced by the academic environments of Norwich University and Dartmouth College (the latter in nearby Hanover, New Hampshire), is one place where the ideas of mid-20th century modernism, promoted by Frank Lloyd Wright and others, were able to flourish. In 1951, Keith and Edna Warner (he a retired businessman) moved to Norwich, purchased a large parcel of land on Hopson Road, and built one of the first Mid-Century Modern houses in the town. The Warners subdivided the land, selling building lots to others and building further such houses. Their house and several they built were designed by Charles McKirahan of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The district is located about west of the village center of Norwich, on a low ridge. Hopson Road runs below the height of the ridge in a roughly north-south direction, with Pine Tree and Spring Pond Roads creating a small rural subdivision on its west side. There are fourteen buildings in the district that are historically significant.

Design The house lies on Castlegate in York City Centre. Further along the street lies Fairfax House, another Grade I listed Georgian house, which is open to the public. R. K. Booth described Castlegate as \\"outwardly perhaps the more interesting of the two\\". The house was commissioned by Peter Johnson, who served as Recorder of York from 1759 to 1789. The site was previously occupied by a number of small houses and, prior to that, had formed the principal part of the grounds of a Franciscan priory. The house was designed by John Carr, a prolific local architect working in the Palladian style, who was considered to be the leading architect of the era in the north of England. Although its completion date is not known with certainty, it has often been estimated at 1763, as this date appears on a rainwater head at the rear of the property. The house consists of five bays, and it has three stories above ground, in addition to a basement. It is constructed of orange-brown bricks, and has a hipped roof covered with slate. The main entrance is through a Doric porch, up a short flight of steps. Although altered, much of Carr's original interior design survives, including staircases and plaster decoration. History In 1831, the house became the Quaker York Quarterly Meeting Girls' School. Its lease expired in 1857, and it was offered the opportunity to purchase the house. However, its trustees deemed the property unsuitable, and the school instead moved to Dalton Terrace, becoming The Mount School. More recently, the house has been used as a masonic temple. In about 1920, an extension was added at the side to facilitate this, designed by Ward and Leckenby.

Life  After completing his secondary education at the Central Normal Higher School, Seoul in 1924, he soon made his start as a businessman. He returned to his hometown in 1926, and quickly went on to head the village's business cooperative union while also trading miscellaneous goods. The following year, he became head of the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper's branch office in Jisu. In 1931, he opened a store along with younger brother Koo Chul-hwoi in Jinju, South Gyeongsang. Things didn't go as planned, and it suffered huge losses. But instead of taking that first defeat to heart, he tried again by getting loans while putting up the family's property as collateral. His fortune began to build as a result of this trial and error. But it wasn't only business that interested him. As his businesses gradually expanded, in 1941 he made a sizeable contribution to the Korean provisional government in Shanghai through an independence fighter who visited him. He didn't hesitate, despite the risk, because his father had done the same a decade earlier, when he donated to the famous Korean independence fighter Kim Koo. When Korea regained its independence, he started to focus on expanding his businesses by relocating to Busan and beginning to import charcoal. His company became the first in the country to receive trade approval from the U.S. Army Ministry Government in Korea. It was around this time that a relative of his wife, Huh Man-jung, visited him with his eldest son Huh Joon-gu, who had just returned from studying in Japan. The elder Huh asked if he could invest in his business in exchange for showing Huh's son the ropes of the business world. This was the beginning of the business partnership between the two families that lasted for decades. Not long after, he decided to accept his younger brother Koo Jung- hwoi's advice and started a cosmetics manufacturing business. This was the moment that today's LG Group was born. The group's first truly successful business, Lak Hui Chemical Industrial Corporation, opened in 1947. It began selling a new face cream called Lucky, which quickly sold out despite its relatively high price thanks to its high-quality ingredients. But though sales were soaring, because of a big problem with the cream's lid, many people were returning the product. His solution was to use plastic for the lid, even though the material wasn't common in Korea. In September 1952, he opened a plastics plant in Busan and started manufacturing plastic hairbrushes, which also became a huge hit. Within two months, he had to add additional manufacturing machines to meet explosive demand, and also started making new products like toothbrushes and washbowls. In 1953 he succeeded in establishing Lak Hui Industrial Co. Ltd. But his ambitions didn't stop there. In 1958, he started Goldstar, which later became LG Electronics. Goldstar immediately began developing a radio, and in 1959, Korea's first homemade radio started rolling off the production line. He then started producing phones, fans, air conditioners, TVs, and refrigerators. He also produced Lucky Sodo toothpaste, toothbrush, soap and synthetic detergent for the first time in Korea. On the other hand, he was president of Busan International Newspaper and Federation of Korean Industries.

The city council took control of the churches in 1524, a fact which attracted many Protestant reformers to carry out their work there. This is the list of states by the date of adoption of the Reformation, meaning the date of an official conversion of a ruler or that of making a Protestant confession an official state religion. The list is incomplete due to the persisting feudalistic nature of many states in the early modern Europe. The Reformation began in 1517 but did not receive formal state support until 1525, although some imperial cities, like Strassburg, introduced it in 1524. The city council of Strassburg eventually came to support the Reformed tradition with reformers like Martin Bucer, Matthew Zell, Wolfgang Capito and Caspar Hedio. Duchy of Prussia and some other states in the Holy Roman Empire introduced Lutheranism as early as 1525. Depending on the view, Luther's country (the Electoral Saxony) adopted the confession either in 1525 (elector becomes Lutheran) or 1527 (Lutheranism is made a state religion). Pre-Reformation As a result of the Bohemian Reformation, Western Christianity was already compromised in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown for decades before Luther. An Utraquist Hussite confession was dominant since the early 1420s and also formally permitted, alongside the Catholic Church, since the Basel Compacts (1436/7) and definitively since the Religious peace of Kutn√° Hora (1485). George of Podƒõbrady was the first non-Roman Catholic ruler in the Catholic part of the early modern Europe.

Origins of the Tashon Legend has it that the original parents of Pu Tashon came out of a solid rock locally known as Lailun, located in Falam Township. Lailun is also believed to be the mythical birthplace of the Chin ancestors. Pu Thuan Kai (Brother of Phurh Hlum and Ral Thang) believed to be one of the first chief of Lailun . Today, the descendants of Pu Thuan Kai i.e. Hlawncheu (eldest and ancestors of Chiefs), Zahau (Second eldest and also ancestor of Chiefs), Hauhulh (Third in line and ancestors of Chiefs), and the aboriginals(Natives who are descendants of Pu Tashon) are Hlampi, Hlawnmong, Tungsawh, Tothuang Upa, Tothuang Nauta, Zahre Upa, Zahre Nauta, Conthawng, Hringngen, Thla-um, Kaltsiing, Cawilawn and Saza are known as Tashons (Taisun Hrinkhat). The Founding of Fahlam Around AD 1500, Pu Tashon moved out from Lailun and established a village in his name i.e. Tashon village. Tribal wars were common at that time and this village was attacked several times by various tribes. When this village was attacked, the Tashons usually hid their children and elders in a secure place, approximately a mile away from the village. There, the Tashons later established a village called Fa-Hlam. According to the hearsay of the Tashons \\"Fa\\" means \\"Children\\" and \\"Hlam\\" can be interpreted as \\"Secure place\\", thus, the name Fa-Hlam could be literally translated as the secure place where people live peacefully. The Tashon village and Fahlam village were separate villages. Their old village Tashon was largely abandoned and the reason for its abandonment was due to superstition. The reason for its abandonment was that a beautiful Burmese maiden, finely dressed in silks and jewels, appeared in a cave in the rocks above the Tashon village. Whoever looked on this Burmese Medusa, however, quickly perished; hence they established a new village Fahlam and migrated there. The village of Fahlam had six quarters with 600 households prior to the British annexation. When the British entered the village in 1892, the household was recorded to be at approximately 500. The village was divided in to six quarters i.e. Butu, Laiko, Phangpho, Hliap, Khawthar, Lu-ung and the quarter chiefs were elected by the Fahlam council. Today, the Tashon village still has three quarters namely Butu, Phangpho and Khawthar. The Tashons were known in various names, such as ‚ÄòTashon‚Äô by the Burman and the British, ‚ÄòPhalamte‚Äô after their principle village by the Sizang and Tedim, ‚ÄòFahlam‚Äô or ‚ÄòTlaisun‚Äô by their neighbours, however, they called themselves ‚ÄòTashons (or) Taisun‚Äô. Rise to the Power After Fahlam was established by the Tashons, they gradually brought all their neighbours under their control. The Tashons were keen traders and they came to control the entire east and west trade between the Lushai, central Chin Hills and the Kalay Valley. They maintained a good relationship with the Swabwa of Kalay Valley where major goods such as salt, iron, ornaments and others were imported. They established a trade route between Fahlam and Kalay Valley and built the suspension bridge over the Manipur river. It was the only known established trade route between the northern Chin and the plain at that time. The Tashons capital, Fahlam 1892 (now Taisun village) Before 1890, other Chin tribes raided the Kalay-Kabaw valleys and carried whatever they could, back to the Chin Hills. Being the most influential tribe, the Tashons could exercise their authority over other tribes in Chin Hills. During those days, the Sawbwa of Kalay and the Fahlam council made a defensive and offensive alliance. The Fahlam Council gave protection to the Kalay valley i.e. whoever raided the Kalay valley were severely punished by the Fahlam council. The Fahlam council destroyed Hrimpi (a Hakha village) because it raided the Burmese village of Kungyi. In return, the Kalay Sawbwa gave sole trading right to the Tashons which meant the Tashons got salts, irons and other items from the plains and distribute throughout Chin Hills which earned them large profit. This had enabled the Fahlam council to hold a monopoly of the trade in Chin Hills, as they are able to undersell all other traders; and to further ensure that there should be no competition, they put every obstacle in the way of other villages going to the plains. Their control over trade was also the key factor to hold their power. Their political system, their skill in diplomacy and their alliance with the Shan of the Kale valley enabled them to become the most powerful tribes in Chin Hills. The tribes became very powerful and their ancestral song runs thus: :The great Fahlam has been born; :No one will ever conquer us; :Our fame spreads beyond the land we could reach; :And it shines like the sun. Although their influence reached over vast areas in the Chin Hills, their authority did not extend to administration of the vassal tribes but it did include ‚Äúprotective custody‚Äù of the whole area, so that if any tribe behaved badly the Tashons could and would organise a punitive expedition, composed of the toughest men in all the other tribes under their control, to smite the offender [HNC Stevenson]. They held a unique position in Chinland at that time. All the tribes from Manipur to Hakha and from Burma to Lushai owed them nominal allegiance. They hold their position in Chin Hills, not so much through their prowess in the field as through their ingenuity and thus uphold their rule over the whole. The Chin Leader, The Tashons Democratic Council leader Pu Con Bik aka Bo Son Pek Administration of The Tashon Chiefs (The Fahlam Council) Tashons were the only tribes who practiced democracy system prior to the British annexation, whereas, other tribes in Chin Hills practice feudalism. The Tashons area were administered by a council of five chiefs, who were all chosen from the villages such as Fahlam (Taisun), Conghte, Congheng and Zamual. The known councillors from the Fahlam Council are as follows: *Pu Bawi Khal (circa 1650-1700 AD), *Pu Hlawn Kim, Pu Lian Bik & Pu Sang Rul (circa 1700 - 1750 AD), *Pu Lian Nawn & Pu Hniar Vum (circa 1750 ‚Äì 1820 AD), *Pu Kip Bik (father of Pu Con Bik), Pu Kha Lian & Pu Hoi Hlum (circa 1820 ‚Äì 1856 AD). From 1865 until the British annexation of Chin Hills i.e. 1892, the Fahlam Council was led by Pu Con Bik known by the Burmese and British as Son Pek. The other council members were Pu Mang Hlur, Pu Cong Khar, Pu Bawi Hmung and Pu Kha Lian. Pu Kha Lian and Pu Mang Hlur served in the council led by Pu Kip Bik. They continued to serve in the council led by Pu Con Bik. The post of councillor was attained, not by virtue of birth, but by the vote of the people. Only when a common man who is particularly conspicuous as a soldier, who shows his skills in trade and diplomacy, who attain the highest social class among the Tashons society was elected to be the Councillor. If one person was chosen to be a Councillor then they promoted him through marriage so that he belonged to the council families. Unity is Strength For the people of Tashons, the absolute power lies with the Fahlam council. ‚ÄúUnity is strength‚Äù was the Fahlam motto. Each day, the council met in the morning at the house of one of the council members and they discussed tribal affairs including making decisions on cases brought to the court, and matters related to revenue. The Fahlam council members always adopted a democratic procedure to elaborate on matters concerning administration or judicial concern before coming to a decision. In Fahlam, none of the councillors alone had the power to decide any case. The council members had to discuss everything and the people are very envious of the power and prestige. E.B. Elles writes ‚ÄúThe chiefs have more power in their tribe than any other Chin tribes. This is because they never act separately, but together after consultation‚Äù In some important matters like going to war, the Fahlam council convened a federal council meeting in which not only the chief or council members but also elders of the main village and others satellite tribes participated. When the British invaded Chin Hills, the Fahlam council had managed to raise 3,000 warriors from all tribes, all corners of Chin Hills and stood against the invading enemy. The use of their system allowed not only the Chin people to be united but also to show loyalty to each other, the recognize virtue of the Chin people. Tribal wars were fought numerous times among each other, however, in time of danger, the Fahlam council managed to unite the Chin people to fight side by side against the British Empire. Early Relations with the British The Kingdom of Myanmar fell under the British Empire in 1885, however, Chin Hills did not fall automatically under the British colonial rule. Chin Hills at that time was independent nation and the Myanmar King Thibaw authority did not reach over Chin Hills. After the Burmese capital Mandalay was occupied, the British force then moved to the Burma western borders and annexed Kalay valley in 1886. The British administration in Burma disposed the Swabwa (ruler) of Mang Yit and appointed his nephew Sawbwa Maung Pa Gyi on 1 January 1887. The British administration in Burma and their western neighbour, the Chin people started to have contact in 1887. The upper Burma political officer, Captain F.D. Raikes arrived in Kalaymyo on and sent out messengers to the chiefs of Fahlam (Tashon), Sizang, Kamhau, Sukte, Zokhua and Hakha requesting them to come to the plains. Captain Raikes met with four Sizang Chiefs, Ton Suang, Hau Suang (brother of Sizang Chief Khup Pau), Do Son and Ten Sang on 26 December 1887 at Kalaymyo monastery. He also met with Kamhau delegate Pu Lun Sat on 8 March 1888. Zokhua and Haka chiefs not only refused to meet Captain Raikes but also killed two messengers sent by him. Capt. Raikes arrived at Indin (principal village of Kalay Sawbwa) on 17 March 1887 and held a meeting with Sawbwa Maung Pagyi. During that time, the Kalay valley was in turmoil as civil war broke out between the old Sawbwa (Maung Yit) and new Sawbwa Maung Pagyi. Moreover, the Sizang Chin taking advantage of the civil war, descended from the hills and raided the valley. Prior to the British annexation of the Kalay valley, the Sawbwa in the Kalay valley and the Fahlam council had defensive and offensive alliance. Consequently, Pu Con Bik (the leader of the Fahlam Council) gave protection to the valley and when other Chin tribes raided the plains, the Tashon army then punished those responsible for the raids. Captain Raikes and Sawbwa Maung Pa Gyi discussed ways to end the civil war and how they can protect Kalay valley from Chin raids. The British arrested old Sawbwa Maung Yit and his associates and sent them to Jail in Mandalay and to stop the Chins from raiding the plains, Captain Raikes noted in his diary as thus: To attain immunity from raids without recourse to assures it will be necessary to talk with the Chiefs of the Chin tribes of the five principal tribes within raiding distance of the Kale [Kalay] country. The Tashon tribe is the most powerful and the Tashon Mingyi is looked up to by the Chiefs of the remaining tribes; the Tashon tribe has fortunately been friendly towards Kale [Kalay], all raids have been confined to the Siyin [Sizang] and Sagyilain [Sakhiling] tribes. The Sawbwa has sent out a deputation to ascertain whether the Tashon Mingyi [Pu Con Bik] will meet him in the course of a few weeks when they prepare to go through the usual formal ceremonies which are customary when contract are made with the Chin tribes. A messenger was sent to Fahlam (The capital of Tashon tribes) and Tashon Mingyi (Fahlam Chief) Pu Con Bik sent seven men as a delegation to Indin (principal village of Kalay Swabwa). Anglo ‚Äì Tashon Conferences The Tashon delegation and Capt. Raikes met on 21 March 1887 and Capt. Raikes said ‚ÄúThe British had permanently annexed upper Burma, that the Swabwa of Kale had been nominated by the British government and that raiding on villages in the Kale country and Kabaw valley on the right bank of the Chindwin between Kalay and Thaungthut must ceased‚Äù. The delegate replied that ‚ÄúAs soon as the Kale Sawbwa has established his headquarter and a formal contract had been entered into, the chiefs of the Tashon tribe would call upon the chief of the sagyilian [Sakhiling], Kamhau tribe to agree to stop raid and in case of them failing to come in and agreeing to the raid the Tashons tribe would be willing to help the Sawbwa and to assist him in fighting tribes which continue raids in the kale country‚Äù. After the meeting, Capt. Raikes show the power of rifle to the Tashons delegation and they were astonished. Capt. Raikes remarks that ‚ÄúI think this has a better effect than the present I gave them yesterday‚Äù. Captain Raikes then arranged a further meeting with the Tashons principal Chief Pu Con Bik. The meeting was arranged at Indin but Pu Con Bik refused to go, instead, he asked Captain Raikes to come to Sihaung. Captain Raikes then ride to Sihaung which is 12.75 miles from Indin. When he arrived at Sihaung, Pu Con Bik then asked him to come to a small village within the Chin territory called Kaanhla, 2 miles south west of Sihaung. Captain Raikes and Pu Con Bik met on 3 January 1888. The main discussion was about opening a trade route to India through Chin Hills. Pu Con Bik refused to agree and even reluctant to negotiate about a trade route. During the first Anglo‚ÄìTashon conference, Capt. Raikes successfully showed off the power of rifle guns. This time, he prepared a cannon and fire two volleys and five rounds of independent firing. Captain Raikes showed off the might and power of the British force and tried to scare off the Chin, however, it was a bad move as Pu Con Bik started to get doubt on the intention of the British. He realized that the British would invade eventually, thus, he prepared for war from this point on ward. Coincidentally, the old Sawbwa Maung Yit and his associates broke out of Mandalay prison and seek asylum in Tashon capital, Fahlam which they were all granted asylum. The Tashons were suspicious after their interview with Captain Raikes, and the Shan sawbwa persuaded them to espouse the cause of the Shwegyophyu Prince, and to aid him in fighting against the British Government. Pu Con Bik also granted political asylum to Shwegyopyu Prince (son of Kanung Mintha) who was wanted by the British for killing two British officers at the Chinbyit Battle. Raiding British Burma A combine force of Tashons, Sizang, Kamhau, Sukte and the Burmese launched an offensive against the British by raiding Indin on 4 May 1888 and occupied Sihaung and Indin. They also attacked British military police posts at Kalaymyo and Kanpale (No.1 Stockades). This was followed by incursions into the plains in which the Yazagyo and Homalin were targeted. The Sizang warriors attacked Chitpauk on 17 October and Kantha on 22 September. Sukte and Kamhau tribes also attacked the Kabaw valley destroying Khampat in their wake. A combined force of Sizang warriors and Burman led by Sawbwa Maung Yit occupied Yazagyo. The British forces then quickly reinforced and counterattack the Chin warriors. The Chin warriors then retreated back to Chin Hills. Pu Con Bik also made an alliance with tribes from Hakha, Zokhua and Sakta areas which were to act in accord with the Tashons. The combined force of Chin warriors and Burman under the leadership of Tashons were as follows :* 14 October 1888: Hmanbin was attacked by 30 Burmans led by Amatgyi Maung Tha Dun. Shwegyophyu led warriors attacked Minledaung (Minlaytaung). :* 17 October 1888: Chitpauk, 4 miles from Yazagyo was attacked by 100 Sizang warriors. Seven men were killed and 45 carried off. :* 17 October 1888: Taungo was attacked by 14 Sizang warriors. :* 20 October 1888: Kalaymyo was attacked by 400 Sizang Chins at 4a.m. They burnt 35 houses, killed 3 Burmans, wounded 4, and carried away 40 men. Four Chins were killed and five badly wounded. A party of police from Kanbale followed Chins for 3 miles, but no come up with them. :* 23 October 1888: The Tashon force attack the British posts around Myitha valley. :* 24 October 1888: British post also known as No.1 Stockade, Kanbale was attacked by 50 Burmans which was held by Kabaw valley police. Two villagers were killed and six carried away. The village which is 50 yards from the stockade, was burnt. My report states that the sepoys neither went out to assist the villagers nor fired a shot. It was full moon. :* 22 October 1888: Kantha was attacked by Sizang. 32 captives taken. :* 29 October 1888: Chin numbering 300 attacked and burnt Khampat killing 7 and carried off 27. :* 29 October 1888: The Tashon force attacked Kanyi and Laungshe villages. :* 30 October 1888: 37 Burman led by Bo La headed for Sagaing. As the Chins and Burman forces attacked across the Kalay and Kabaw valleys, the British Army then prepared for the annexation of Chin Hills. The British administration then sent ultimatum to the Sizang chief to deliver Khai Kam together with the captives whom he carried off. Ultimatum was also sent to the Fahlam Council to deliver the Shwegyophyu prince and his followers. The British believed that the invasions of the plains were instigated by fugitives Shwegyophyu Prince, old Shan Sawbwa. When those ultimatums were ignored by the Sizang and the Fahlam council, the British force then prepared to launch expedition known as The Chin-Lushai Expedition (1888‚Äì1889). The British spent the month of November 1888 preparing for the expedition. Brigadier-General Faunce and Captain Raikes, established defensive positions along the valley. A levy of Military Police (later 2nd Battalion of Burma Rifle) guarded the Yaw valley against the depredations of the Southern Chins. Capt. Raikes and his assistant Mr. Hall collecting intelligence about the Chin, their village and the routes into the hills. Hills coolies were collected in Assam and sent for the expeditions. The forces for the expedition were gathered at Kanpale (Stockade No.1) and 42 Gurkha Battalion was added for the expeditions. The Chin ‚Äì Lushai Expedition (1888‚Äì1889) ‚Äì Eastern Chin Hills The British army strategy was to first march against the Sizang head village Khuasak, then deal with the surrounding villages. The route selected for the advance of the column was from Kanpale to the summit of Leisan range. There was no road to the hills at that time, therefore, a road had to be constructed for the main invading force and their heavy weaponry. At the beginning of December 1888, the road (mule track) construction was completed until the foot of the hill, there they established No.2 Stockade i.e. Zawlkin (now Khai Kam Town). The road construction continued towards the hills and the reach at Phatzang where a rough No.3 stockade was established. On hearing the news of the British advance, the combined force of Sizang, Kamhau and Sukte attacked the British force. The Sizang were in constant co-ordination with the Tashons. On the 10 December 1888, the great force of Tashon made a simultaneous attack on the villages of Sihaung, Kyawywa and Kundu. At the same time, 80 Tashons warriors clashed head to head with 42 Gurkha Light infantry led by Captain Westmoreland. On the same date, the Sizang attacked Indin and a combined force of Sukte and Kamhau attacked the military post at Kangyi (20 miles north of Kalemyo). The Chins showed their planning abilities and military capabilities in this simultaneous attack to the various British positions. The British officers were impressed by the Chin capabilities as political officers B.S Carey & H.N. Tuck wrote in the Chin Hills: ‚ÄùThe Chins were in great force, and we now know that Tashons and Siyins (Sizang) were fighting side by side on this occasion. The Chins swooped down from the heights on to the party, which was working on a narrow spur, and attacked them from all four sides, fighting under cover of heavy undergrowth. The collies bolted and the troops fell back after holding their ground some little time. Whilst disputing every stage of our advance into their hills, the Chins showed considerable tactical ability by taking the offensive in the plains and attacking Shan villages and our posts in the rear of advancing column‚Äù. Since, the Chin showed their military skills by inflicting some losses on the invading forces, the British Army took the Chin seriously. General Sir. George White Commander-in-Chief of Burma, personally came to supervise the expedition. He arrived in Kanpale (near Kalaymyo) on the 30 December 1888 and accompanied the expedition forces. The Chin warrior built a stockade at Leisan Mual (Red Rocky Gate) and stood firm. On the 27 January 1889, the Chin warriors attacked the road workers and the British send their troops to engage with the Chin warriors. The Chin warriors gave them strong resistance but the British firepower forced the Chin warriors to retreat. The Chin warriors then stood firm at Leisen Mual stockade which is the last line of defence. The British couldn't take the stockade so reinforced was then ordered then the British Force charged again and the stockade was occupied. As the last line of defence was breached by the superior British force, the door to the Sizang valley was wide open. The British forces march to Leisang range, from there they can see the villages within Sizang valley. General George White described his experience of the battles with the Chin as ‚ÄúThe most difficult enemy to see or hit I ever fought\\" The British forces defeated the Sizang and established Fort White post, in honour of General George White. After the British force established Fort White post, Major Raikes remained as Political Officer and Colonel Skene in command of the troops in Chin Hills. After the villages of the Sizang and Kamhau were destroyed, they were living in encampments near their respective cultivation. Although they were beaten by a far superior force and driven by their village, they showed no sign of surrender and attack the British post whenever they had opportunity. They ambushed the British, they cut telegraph cables and stole cattle from the British whenever possible. The Sizang resisted the British from the forest for two years. After the Chin ‚Äì Lushai Expedition of 1888‚Äì1889, Major Raikes then opened up negotiations wiih the Tashons, however, Pu Bawi Hmung from Fahlam Council informed the Major Raikes that the Tashons refused to surrender the Shwegyophyu Prince and his associates, and they were not in a position to enforce the surrender of the Burman captives held by the Sizang and Kamhau. The British wanted to advance to Tashon territory however, as the monsoon season was closing, the expedition to Tashons territory had to be postponed for the year. At the end of 1888‚Äì1889, the British force suffered 67 casualties during the expedition and the state of affairs was that all the Sizang and 18 of the Kamhau villages had been destroyed, and the British troops now occupied their tract (northern Chin Hills). The Tashons continued to grant political asylum to Shwegyophyu Prince and his associates. In the East, the Chin-Lushai Expedition 1888‚Äì1889 started in December 1888 and largely ended in May 1889 after the battle of Siallum. The Chin ‚Äì Lushai Expedition (1888‚Äì1889) ‚Äì Western Chin Hills The British army invaded Western Chin Hills which is now part of Mizoram, in 1871-72 known as the Lushai Expedition (1871‚Äì72). Then there was relative peace in the western border until the murder of Lt. J.F. Stewart, 1st Battalion of Leinster Regiment by Lungtian chief Hau Sata on 03 Feb 1888. Lt. Stewart with his bodyguards were surveying for the road construction at 18 miles east of Rangamati and were to work southward towards Bilaicharai. They were ambushed at their camp in the dawn of 03 Feb 1888, by 300-armed man led by Lungtian Chief called Hau Sata. They killed Lt.Steward and 3 of his bodyguards. Lt. Stewart head was cut off and taken to Thangzang village. Soon after the incident, the British army sent a punitive force to avenge the murder. On 15 March 1889, 1000 British soldiers led by Col. Tregear known as ‚ÄúThe Chin-Lushai Expedition 1888-89‚Äù marched toward western Chin Hills to punish Hau Sata and Thantlang Chief Za Huat. This expedition started on 28 January 1889 and ended in April 1889. They conquered part of the Western Chin Hills including Hau Sata village of Lungtian and Fort Tregear was established at Darzo. The Chin ‚Äì Lushai Expedition (1889‚Äì1890) The Sizangs and Kamhau were active in the northern Chin Hills attacking the British posts whenever they had opportunity. The Tashons still giving protection to Shwegyophyu Prince and his associates. In August 1889, Chief Commissioner of the British Crown Colony of Burma Sir Charles Crosthwaite visited the Kalay area and after discussing matters with Major Raikes issued a proclamation to the Tashons. The Chief Commissioner Major Raikes declared to the Tashons that his intention of sending a force to their chief village [Fahlam] and promised the Tashons immunity from punishment and an amnesty for past offences on condition that they assisted the troops in their march and did their best to compel the Sizang and Kamhau to surrender their captives. The Chiefs were required also to meet the officer in command of the British force at the chief village [Fahlam], to deliver up all captives in possession of the tribe, and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000. The payment annually of two elephant tusks and ten silk sheets as tribute was made a further condition. Failure to comply with these terms would involve the severest punishment Being unwilling to drive the Tashons to extremities, the Chief Commissioner waived the condition previously imposed which required the surrender of the Shwe Gyo Byu Prince and made no mention of the demand for the delivery of guns by the Sukte and Sizang. Strategy for the operation Orders for an expedition known as The Chin-Lushai Expedition (1889‚Äì1890) from Burma and Chittagong were issued from Army headquarters in Burma and India on 5 September 1889. The troops operating from Burma were divided into two columns, one called the Fort White column (or) northern column operating from Fort White as a base against the Sizang and the tribes between the base and the Manipur river. The other called the Gangaw column (or) southern column starting from Gangaw as a base and advancing via Zokhua on Haka. A force called the Chittagong column was to march from Lunglei to Haka, making the road as it advanced. After the arrival of the force at Hakha, the columns were to move northward against the Tashons and in such other directions as the General Officer in command might decide in consultation with the Political Officers. The objects of the expedition were declared to be the punishment of tribes which had committed raids in British territory and had declined to make amends, the subjugation of neutral tribes which had come within our sphere of dominion, the exploration of the country between Burma and Chittagong, and the establishment, if necessary, of semi- permanent posts in the hills to ensure complete pacification and the recognition of British power. Brigadier- General W. P. Symons was placed in command of the expedition with full control in political as well as military matters. Final negotiation Prior to the launch of this Chin-Lushai Expedition, Major Raikes and the Tashons leaders held final negotiation at Sihaung. Major Raikes asked the Tashon leaders to accept the British proclamation, pay tributes annually to the British government, or the British army will annex the Tashons territory. The Tashons leaders simply refused to accept the proclamation. As this final negotiation was not fruitful, both sides prepare for war. Military Operations While the Chittagong column and southern column were marching towards Hakha, the Fort White column launched operations from September 1889 until December 1889 to subdue the Sizangs, Kamhau and Sukte, however, they could not defeat them. They burned their houses and destroyed their crops, however, the Chin continued to fight from the jungle. The British realized that the Sizangs would not be defeated by merely burning their houses and destroying their crops, therefore, they started negotiation for them to surrender. Chin Hills political officers Mr. B.S. Carey managed to open communication channel with the Sakhiling Chief Mang Lun and he did surrender to the British on 17 January. His surrender was significant to the British and through him negotiations were carried out to others Sizangs leaders. Chief Mang Lun also informed the Political Officer that the conduct of the Sizang tribe would depend entirely on the result of the Tashon expedition, and that, if the Tashons did not fight, the Sizangs were not prepared to continue the struggle alone. The British then temporarily abandoned military operations to the Sizangs, who resisted under the leadership of Pu Khai Kam. Their focus turned to the invasion of Tashon territory. The British believed that Sizangs would also surrender if Tashon submit to the British. Meanwhile, The 3,400 strong Chittagong Column led by Brigadier Tregear marched from Lunglei and Fort Tregear and annexed the western Chin Hills i.e. Thantlang areas. The 1,869 strong Gangaw/Burma column led by General W. Symond marched from Kan ‚Äì Pakokku towards Zokhua. Eventually Zokhua, Sakta and Hakha surrendered to General Symonds. The Chittagong column and the Southern column had got in touch via light signal at Thau, 53 miles west of Hakha. The two columns then met at Hakha and preparation were made to advance to the Tashons capital Fahlam. Three Pronged Invasion to the Tashon capital, Fahlam The southern column consists of 100 rifle soldiers from King's Own Scottish Borderers, 164 rifle soldiers from Second and Fourth Gurkha Rifles including two mountain guns led by General Symond marched towards Fahlam on 10 March 1890. The Southern column marched from Hakha via Mangkheng to Fahlam. When the column reached to Mangkheng, the Chief of Mangkheng chief Kawl Ul tried his utmost to dissuade the Southern column from advancing towards the Tashon capital, Fahlam. Again, when the southern column approaching Fahlam, Tashons leader's Pu Con Bik and Pu Mang Hlur warned the column not to cross the area. The southern column advanced and camped at a place called Ngalzawl. Ngalzawl is midway between current Tashon village and Zamual village. The 1,622 strong Fort White Column led by Colonel Skene marched from Fort White ‚Äì Bualkhua ‚Äì Lati and camped at Parte village. At 8 a.m. on the morning of the 11 March 1890 signalling communication was established between the southern column and Fort White column. In order to let the Tashons know about the arrival of the British columns, the Fort White column fired three blank rounds from the gun, whilst three large dynamite cartridges were exploded by the Southern column. In the afternoon of the 11 March 1890, the Tashons leaders including Pu Con Bik, Pu Mang Hlur, Pu Kha Lian, Pu Bawi Hmung, Pu Vum Ceu and a minor official called Shin Lay and General Symons met at Ngalzawl and Gen. Symons read out the terms which had already been sent to the Tashons by Major Raikes. To the British intense surprise, the Tashon leaders firmly and politely declined to acknowledge the supremacy of the British Government. General Symons then gave a stern warning to carefully consider their final answer, which was to be given within two days. Surgeon Lt.Col. A.S. Reid remarked as thus their decision and straightforward boldness in giving it, when their capital was at the mercy of the united columns of the British troops, whom they had permitted and assisted to march on it, was a remarkable. 3,000 Chin Warriors The Fahlam Council managed to raise 3,000 Chin warriors to counterattack the invading British forces and gathered at Fahlam. The warriors were from all corners of Chin Hills and full of armed and prepared for the battle. Among the warriors was the Tashon Chiefs dressed in the gaudy tartan of the tribe, well-armed with bright guns, vermilion and black parti-coloured sword scabbards, and beautifully inlaid powder-horns. The Hualngo were conspicuous by their chignons, which contrasted with the lofty headdress of their neighbours, the Kamhau, who were present carrying the strange \\"Shendu\\" chopper-shaped sword in basketwork scabbards. The Sizangs, Khuangli, Tawyan, Minledaung and Sukte warriors were also present. The congregation was armed with a variety of weapons such as spears and flint-lock guns, bows and quivers of barbed arrows. The Tashons built fortifications along the Manipur River to intercept the northern column. The line of fortifications commenced on the river bank, the first stockade commanding the Lumbang stream. All fords in the river were commanded by sangars built with boulders and rocks, some of which exceeded 100 yards in length. From the river to Fahlam village the road passed through innumerable stockades, rifle-pits, and saagars which had been constructed with enormous labour. The Chin calculated that it was better to face the invaders halfway at Falam to deny further advance to the inner hills. Some must have taken the opportunity to be there to satisfy their curiosity about Fahlam, the centre of power at that time. The Fahlam could have asked help from all nooks and corners. It must have been an honour for some to have come to the side of Tashons in time of need. For some it could have been an obligation. Whatever the reason, 3000 Chins of various tribes under the leadership of Pu Con Bik stood against the invading enemy. The gathering for war was a show of loyalty to each other, the recognized virtue of Chins. Most importantly of all it was a reunion of separated brethren in time of danger to fight side by side against a foreign enemy. Seeing the mass number of warriors, the British political officers remarked as thus; Doubtless it was the presence of this large force drawn from so many tribes and from the very borders of the Lushai country that Position of the induced the Tashon Chiefs to show a bold front, fully believing that with our small force we should be alarmed at the display of the Chin strength. The Chiefs when they informed General Symons that they would not pay tribute were quite sincere and intended to fight rather than pay, though they preferred to gain their end without fighting if possible. It must be remembered that the Tashons held a unique position in Chinland at this time. Ail the tribes from Manipur to Haka and from Burma to Lushai owed them nominal allegiance and the Tashons, realized that their prestige would be gone and the name of Falam lowered in the eyes of Chinland if they in common with the petty clans had to pay tribute and acknowledge the supremacy of the white men. Wooden stockades, blocking in reverse and in all directions the path of approach to the Fahlam from the north. Every point of vantage was protected with crow's nest and masked stockade. Submission of the Tashons General Symons pressed to the Tashons leaders to decide on whether to accept the terms imposed by the British. The Tashons knew their situation best, while keeping the 3,000 warriors at Fahlam in line ready for combat they counselled patience and applied their tested tactics of negotiations in accordance with the changing events as dictated by the British. They refused to accept the terms of the British to pay a fine of ten thousand rupees, ten elephants tusk and ten silk sheets. The Tashons leaders said plainly that they would not pay annual tribute, nor were they sure whether they would pay the fine, or any portion of it. They had not used money and they had not got the money they asked. They would not be able to get the silks as the British prevented them from trading with Kalay valley so they could not get any. A great tension developed and the shadow of fighting loomed large. To convince the Chin war party the British troops at that juncture with primitive weapons amounted to self-annihilation. They decided to disperse but to resist the invaders at advantageous ground as the enemy advanced. The Chin defended their villages as much as they could. They harassed the British troops on the way. They did not give up easily. Only when the British resorted to destroying hidden stored grains and cutting up standing corps in the cultivation fields did the Chins started to negotiate for peaceful settlement. To come to Fahlam to face the enemy and to have come to a consensus resolution to disperse for the time being to gain far better fighting grounds and time to defend the land reflected the true spirit of nationalism. At 1pm on 13 March 1890, the four leaders of Tashons including Pu Bawi Hmung and Pu Vum Ceu and some 20 men, the leaders of the war party, were in discussion with General Symons, General Commanding Officer Mr. Ross and Mr. B.S. Carey (political officer with the northern column). The Tashons leaders having doubtful to the result of the battle decide to accept the terms. The leaders said ‚ÄúWe acknowledge that you have beaten us, that you are the conquerors, but as you are strong be merciful and reduce the fines which we can not pay, and the amount of tribute which we ask to be allowed to pay once in three years, we wish to accept your terms and be friends‚Äù. Eventually, the reduced terms proposed by the Tahsons was accepted by Gen Symons as ‚ÄúGeneral Symons did not wish to be too severe on a tribe which acknowledged itself defeated‚Äù. The tribute was to be 5050 rupees annually. The Tashons did not lose their prestige nor their position in Chin Hills as the terms were to only pay annual tribute to the British government. After the Tashon had agreed to pay tributes to the British, General Symons returned to Hakha and also the Northern column returned to Fort White. The Tashon leaders agreed to send representative men with the northern column to try and get the Sizangs and Kamhau to surrender. The northern column started on its return march to Fort White on the 15th March, taking two Tashons leaders with them. The Sizang and northern Chin also surrendered to the British in April 1890. However Tashon Chief Bawi Hmung and Khualsim Chief said that they would not give up Shwegyophyu prince nor way where he was, because they had sworn the oath of friendship with him. Shwegyophyu later returned to Burma and he was arrested, tried, and hanged in 1891. Second Expedition to Fahlam (March 1891) Although, the Tashons accepted to give tributes to the British government in March 1890, the British did not rule the Tashons territory directly. The Tashons kept their power, prestige and continue to collect tributes from vassal tribes as before. The Tashons indirectly continued to oppose the British force. They themselves did not confront the British directly, however, they instigated the Chin people from the north and south to rebel against the British. Rebelling against the British force grew in 1891 and the British made Tashons accountable for every incident. To punish the Tashons for insurgents, the British troops then marched to the Tashons capital Fahlam in March 1891. On 10 March 1891, the column consisted of 3 guns No. 3 Mountain Battery under Lieutenant O'Leary, 150 rifles, 3-4th Gurkhas under Captain Carnegy, 150 rifles, 30th Garhwal Rifles under Lieutenant Evatt, 35 rifles, 4th Madras Pioneers under Captain Stevens and 300 rifles and two guns under the command of Colonel Mainwaring accompanied by Mr. Ross and Lieutenant Macnabb, Political Officers, marched from Haka to Fahlam. They arrived at Ngalzawl on the 13 March. As in 1890, the northern column also marched to Fahlam from Fort White and camped at Parte. The Tashons also gathered a large force around their capital Fahlam and both the British columns were very closely monitored by the Chin warriors. On the 14 March 1891, a durbar was held at Ngalzawl and Captain Rundall (the Political Officer with the Fort White column), Mr. Ross and the Tashons chiefs were present at the durbar. The Tashons paid 5 mithun as tributes to the British. The question of the tribal responsibility of the Tashons for the Gungal, who had committed the murders on the Fort White-Kale road, was discussed. It was decided that the Tashons would deliver up the offenders, who were reported to have fled into the Lushai country, should they at any time return to their territory, and agree to pay a fine and be responsible for their future good behaviour. For that incident, the British political officers set fine at four mithun and two guns. The British columns wanted to enter the capital Fahlam, however, the Tashons chiefs objected, consequently, the troops did not march through Fahlam and returned to their respective bases i.e. Hakha and Fort White. King's Rifle Column prepared to march to Fahlam, March 1892. The Fall of Fahlam (13 March 1892) After the expedition of March 1891, the Tashons promised the British of good behaviours, however, Throughout 1891, the Chin people continued to rebel against the British. The British had it enough and prepared to rule the Tashons directly and put Chin Hills under their firm control. For this, they prepared the final expedition to the capital. In March 1892, the British force then prepared another expedition to the capital with two columns as in 1890 and 1891 expeditions. The political officer of Chin Hills Mr. B.S. Carey writes about the needs for the British to keep under their direct rule as thus: ‚ÄúThroughout Chin Hills, Tashons were regarded as powerful rivals to ourselves, it was therefore necessary to bring this tribe under our control, so that our authority in the country might be universal and paramount. The Tashons had, however, never shown any active hostility towards us, and instructions were therefore issued to the effect that, while promptly suppressing any resistance that might be met with, every effort was to be used to carry out the programme peaceably and to avoid recourse to military force. As the Tashons and their tributaries were supposed to be able to muster 10,000 fighting men, two columns were told off for the expedition‚Äù. The two columns consisted of the followings: :*The column from Hakha under Major Hewlett, and Burma Regiment, consisted of Royal Artillery, Section No. 8, B. M. B., Lieutenant Knapp, and 65 men. :*King's Royal Rifles, three officers and loo rifles under Major Gunning. :*10 rifles, 4th Madras Pioneers. 130 rifles and 20 mounted infantry, Burma Battalion, under Captain Presgrave. :*360 coolies and 200 mules, Darjeeling cooly corps, Lieutenant Watson, King's Royal Rifles, in charge. :*Staff Officer‚Äî Lieutenant Evatt, 39th Garhwal Rifles. :*Medical Officer‚Äî Surgeon-Captain Newland, I.M.S. The column from Hakha was originally to have started in February 1892, however, they could only march on 10 March 1892. For some time before the column started marching, the British sent spies and reported that the Tashons also prepare for war. Military intelligence from the Fort White column also reported the warlike intentions of the Tashons. At this point, the Tashons tried to persuade the Hakha in the south and the Sizangs and Sukte in the north to bring about a general uprising, but failed to win over those tribes. Failing in the general uprising attempt, the Tashon Chiefs met with the Lt. Macnabb from the Hakha column at Mangkheng. Lt. Macnabb pointed out to the Tashons that resisting such the British columns will be catastrophic for the Tashons. The Hakha column arrived at Ngalzawl on 13 March 1892 and the northern column also arrived at Parte on 13 March 1892. The Tashons chiefs were told that for the first time in their history that the British intended to occupy their proud capital Fahlam. The Tashons strongly objected. The Tashons thought that the British would camp at Ngalzawl for a few days and left as they had done in the previous two expeditions. However, the British troops marched towards Fahlam but the Tashons offered no resistance and the village was peacefully occupied by the British force. British Column Halted Previous to Final Advance on Fahlam On 14 March reinforcement from the Gungal column also marched to Fahlam, having camped the previous night 2 miles below the village. Mr. Carey then joined Lieutenant Macnabb and the Falam Chiefs were summoned to talk over affairs. The Tashon chiefs were informed that their village had been occupied as an imposition of punishment for their breach of faith, in attempting to instigate a general uprising against the British force and the British intend to establish a permanent post at Fahlam. The Tashons were forbidden in future to levy tribute from the Kamhau, Sizangs or Sakhiling. So long as the Chiefs were obedient and loyal their rights and privileges would be maintained and their authority assured both over the Tashons and over their tributaries. The Chiefs were warned that any tributary tribes who offered resistance when visited by our officers would be removed from their control and administered direct. The Government also reserved the right of taking over the direct administration of any tributaries who were un- willing to remain subject to the Tashon Chiefs or whom they were unable to control. Then, the British occupied the village of Tashon (approximately one mile to the west of Fahlam). The following day on 14 March 1892, the British force marched in Tashons to show the might of the British force. King's Rifle Column prepared to march to Fahlam, March 1892. The Founding of the current city of Falam (April 1892) Though, the Tashons chiefs were defeated they still objected the British force to establish a post at Fahlam. The British then tried to make their temporary post i.e. Tashon village permanent which was garrisoned by 400 Garhwal rifles under Major Browne, D.S.O., with a small detachment of Madras Sappers under Lieutenant Ainslie, R.E., Mr. Tuck in political charge. However, the Tashon village was condemned on medical grounds in April 1892. The British decided to build a new post from scratch at three miles north west of Fahlam. The Tashon village was condemned and materials were used to build their new post. The Tashons supplied thirty thousand collies for the construction of their new post which is the current city of Falam. The British decided to name their newly built post Fahlam after the Tashons capital in order to demonstrate that they have conquered the Tashons. The Tashons were forced to rename their capital ‚ÄúTashons‚Äù after the name of their tribes. The British had problems to pronounce Fahlam, hence, they called and wrote it as ‚ÄúFalam‚Äù, omitting (h) aspirated sound. Since then, it has been called and known as Falam. Falam was the administration centre of Chin Hills during the colonial era. It was the headquarter of Chin Hills Battalion. It was the capital of Chin Hills. In 1948, Chin State joined the Union of Burma and gained independence from the British government. Since independence it was the capital of Chin State until 1965. Falam was founded on mid-1892 and it had just celebrated its 125th anniversary in February 2017. Tashon Village The Tashons' capital Fahlam became Tashon village in 1892. The village is still standing and is very popular with tourist nowadays. The Tashon village was named Chin Heritage Village in 2016 and holds heritage status in Chin State.

It is the church hall of Holy Trinity, Micklegate. Architecture The building was originally a hall house, consisting of a hall rising the full two-stories of the building, with a wing at the east end. It may have had a matching wing at the west end, but no evidence survives. The house is timber- framed, with the ground floor infilled with Mediaeval brick. Its upper floor is jettied. Its main entrance has a 15th-century canopy. The roof is of crown post construction, the roof in the wing being a reconstruction. History The origin of the building is not known with certainty, but its current custodians claim that it was built in about 1474 as lodgings for a chantry priest based at neighbouring Holy Trinity Priory. The construction was funded by Thomas Nelson, a city alderman, who wished the priest to pray for his family. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the building was purchased by Isabella Ward, former prioress of Clementhorpe Nunnery. She lived in the house with her sister, which appears to have been divided in two during this period. Before Ward's death, she donated the property to the Feoffees of York. They permitted her to continue to live in the house for a peppercorn rent of one red rose a year. During the early 17th-century, the house was used as a rectory for Holy Trinity, Micklegate. A first floor was added to the hall, making the whole building two stories. Around this date, new windows and fireplaces were added, many of which survive. The building was again divided into two houses, then in the 1740s was converted into a pub, for the first time known as \\"Jacobs Well\\". In about 1790, the building was converted back to a house, leased by Roger Glover and John Furnish, who ran a stagecoach business. They obtained fire insurance for the building, the sun mark for which survives. In 1815, they had a third storey, of brick, added to the wing, and an extension built to house a kitchen. This extension covered the original entrance, so a new entrance was created on Trinity Lane, which remains the main entrance to the building. With the alterations complete, the building again became a pub, with two bars downstairs, and accommodation for the landlord above. However, it struggled to make money in its hidden location, and in 1903 the alcohol license was surrendered. The feoffees retained ownership of the building, and they decided that it should become a parish room for Holy Trinity Church. In 1905, local antiquarian Walter Harvey Brook made major alterations to the building, adding a new staircase, bay window and fireplace, and creating a new door to the garden. A 15th-century canopy was added to the main entrance, taken from the Old Wheatsheaf Inn on Davygate. By the 1980s, the building was in danger of collapse, in part due to vibrations caused by traffic passing along Trinity Lane. In order to save it, the brick top storey was removed, and a new roof constructed for the wing to match that over the hall. This work was completed in 1991, and since then, use of the building has been under the care of Holy Trinity, Micklegate.

It is the second of Tey's five mysteries starring Inspector Alan Grant, and the first book written under the Josephine Tey pseudonym. The plot draws extensively on Tey's experience in working with actors in her play Richard of Bordeaux, which was produced in London's West End in 1933 starring John Gielgud and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, and on her work as a contract writer in Hollywood. Plot The body of a woman, Christine Clay (n√©e Christina Gotobed) is discovered at the edge of the surf on a beach in Kent. She is initially thought to be the victim of a drowning accident, but the presence of a button tangled in her hair leads Inspector Grant to conclude she has been murdered. Suspicion quickly falls on her house guest, Robert Tisdall, who admits to having stolen Clay's car and then regretted it and returned. Tisdall had been Clay's guest for 4 days at the time of the murder, in a cottage that she had rented in secret to have an anonymous holiday. He inherited a fortune but has squandered it, and was rescued from a life of poverty when Clay randomly encountered him in London and offered him hospitality out of kindness. She did not tell him her name, instructing him to call her \\"Chris\\". Clay's identity is revealed when Jason Harmer, her songwriter, arrives at the cottage having tracked down its location from a clue in a letter he received from her. Once her identity becomes public Lydia Keats, an astrologist, receives considerable attention for having correctly predicted that Clay would drown. The day before the murder, Clay wrote to her lawyer instructing him to add a codicil to her will bequeathing a small portion of her estate ‚Äî a ranch in California and several thousand pounds ‚Äî to Tisdall. The bulk of her estate is left to \\"maintain the beauty of the English countryside\\". Tisdall claims not to have known about the bequest to him. Although it goes against his intuition, Grant is convinced of Tisdall's guilt by the motive provided by the bequest. Another suspicious circumstance is that Tisdall's coat, which had buttons similar to the one found in Clay's hair, has been stolen. Furthermore, none of Clay's friends knows of the cottage, except for her husband and the owner of the cottage, another film star. Grant decides to arrest Tisdall, but he escapes. Later, Tisdall is discovered by Erica Burgoyne, the 16-year-old daughter of the local Chief Constable. Erica believes Tisdall's story about his coat, and sets out to find it. She discovers that a tramp was in the neighborhood on the day the coat was stolen, and tracks him through the fact that he mends china. The coat she recovers has no missing buttons, leading Grant to conclude that Tisdall is innocent. However, Tisdall cannot be found and anxiety mounts regarding his safety. Grant is left back at square one. He next investigates Clay's brother Herbert Gotobed, who turns out to be a con man with a history of posing as a religious prophet, and Clay's husband, Lord Edward Champneis. Champneis arouses suspicion by failing to account for his whereabouts on the night before the murder, but Grant is reluctant to confront him. Grant tracks Gotobed to a monastery in Canterbury, close to Clay's cottage, where he is on the point of being given control of a large amount of money as Prior to the brotherhood's Mexican mission. Eventually Gotobed is arrested, though not for his sister's murder, and extradited to the US. Champneis's suspicious behavior turns out to be due to an effort to help a political exile to obtain sanctuary in the UK. Tisdall re-surfaces, having hidden in an attic for several days; he is feverish and on the point of pneumonia but recovers. At a loss for the next step, Grant decides to get a haircut. While waiting, he happens across an article in an old magazine that points out how celebrated Lydia Keats will be if her prediction of death by drowning for a film star -- not identified in the article -- comes true, and hints that the star should not go swimming with Keats for fear she might be tempted to make her prediction a reality. He telephones the cottage's owner and discovers that he mentioned Clay's tenancy of the cottage to Keats, forgetting that it was supposed to be a secret. Keats has a motorboat that could have given her easy access to the beach where Clay was killed. Grant investigates and finds a coat in the motorboat that is missing a button on one sleeve. He confronts Keats. She raves about her infallibility and the glorious destiny predicted for her by the stars, and is taken away by the police surgeon. The final scene of the book is a dinner party attended by Grant, Tisdall and the Burgoynes, at which Grant is happy to see that Erica has not become inappropriately attracted to Tisdall. Adaptations The novel was adapted for the film Young and Innocent in 1937 by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Nova Pilbeam and Derrick De Marney. It was also dramatised as a radio play by the BBC in 1954 and 1998 The 1998 adaptation by John Fletcher dispenses with much of the plot, changes the identity of the murderer, and presents the remaining narrative as a Wodehousian romantic romp. Parallels with author's life Marta Hallard is believed to be based on Marda Vanne, whose partner Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies was the leading lady in Richard of Bordeaux.

The female has an average size of about and the male has an average size of about . Description The female has an average size of about and the male has an average size of about . Distribution C. helgolandicus is found in the Atlantic, from the North Sea south to the western coast of Africa. It can also be found in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Because of increasing temperatures due to climate change, its range is expanding northward. It is usually found in waters between in temperature, with maximum abundance being between . Ecology Life cycle and reproduction C. helgolandicus overwinters as a stage V copepodite. However, only those with enough energy stores can overwinter; the rest stay at the surface. In fact, it has been observed that overwintering copepods are heavier than those that stay at the surface. During this overwintering process, the copepodites moult into adult females. After moulting, the females breed the next spring. In the absence of food during this time, they can lay their first few eggs from accumulated energy stores. Although this is true, it is mainly an income breeder, reproducing using recently gained energy. It has a maximum of about three generations per year. In the central North Sea, it is most abundant during spring and autumn. It is likely that warmer temperatures can facilitate egg production for more of the year. Feeding C. helgolandicus is a planktonic herbivore, although it has been shown to eat both dead diatoms and faeces from other members of its species. This copepod seems to select particles based on their structure; marine snow (which is unstructured), is rejected, whereas dead diatoms and objects such as polystyrene (when given as beads 30 micrometers in diameter) are accepted as food. Faecal pellets are generally not accepted in whole (possibly due to the difficulty in handling very large particles). When faecal pellets are rejected, they are generally damaged. When the pellets are fragmented (corporhexy), they are generally ingested with alternate food, and the \\"loosening\\" (coprochaly) of a pellet can precede the removal (and likely ingestion) of the peritrophic membrane, which has bacteria and other organisms which increase its nutritional value. Its grazing (the efficiency of the removal of food from seawater) and ingestion rates (the actual amount of food eaten) increase with increasing body weight, however, as body weight increases, the grazing and ingestion rates per unit of body weight decrease.

It is the largest donkey rescue organization in the United States with 24 sanctuaries and 26 adoption centers nationwide. It shelters around 3,000 donkeys, providing food, water, medical care, gentling, training, and adoption services. The organization has rescued a total of over 8,000 donkeys. Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue was founded in 2000 by husband and wife, Mark and Amy Meyers, on their small ranch in Acton, California. It received nonprofit status in January 2001. By October of that year, the organization had rescued 40 donkeys and adopted out half of those. In 2005, Mark and Amy Meyers moved the operation to an almost 100-acre property near Tehachapi, California. By 2006, the property held around 250 rescued donkeys. In 2008, the organization entered into an agreement with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to rescue feral or abandoned donkeys in Big Bend Ranch State Park. In 2011, it was responsible for nearly 800 donkey rescues, 700 of which occurred in Texas. In 2012, Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue moved its main headquarters to a 172-acre facility (a former dairy farm) in San Angelo, Texas. It was operating 15 adoption centers serving 27 states by 2013. The organization earned accreditation from the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries in July 2016. In May 2018, it entered into an agreement with the National Park Service to rescue and remove up to 2,500 wild donkeys from Death Valley National Park and the Mojave National Preserve as part of the Wild Burro Project.

The design of a prior Franklin County courthouse, while not necessarily itself especially architecturally distinguished, was copied in the design of the Old Morris County Courthouse. The prior courthouse was built in 1875. Its successor, the present courthouse, built in 1912, was designed by L.L. Thurman in Classical Revival style. The courthouse is a three-story sandstone building with full height columned and pedimented porticoes on two sides. It has an octagonal, domed clock tower. The jail, also built in 1912, is a square two- story small building. With 14 figures and five photos from 2005.

It started on July 3, 2018 and was later downgraded to a Burned Area Response on September 4, 2018 after 13 weeks. The fire destroyed a total of 12,588 wilderness acres on Basalt Mountain and seriously injured a volunteer firefighter who had returned to the force out of retirement. The Lake Christine fire also destroyed the home of a volunteer firefighter who was battling the blaze in response to his call of duty on the evening of July 4th.  Incidents  The fire started just before 6:00pm on July 3, 2018, at the Basalt Shooting Range. It was ignited on a hillside adjacent to the gun range by Richard Karl Miller, 23, and Allison Sarah Marcus, 22, of Maryland. They were in a group using tracer rounds at the rifle area of the range, located on the Southside. The Roaring Fork Valley, including Basalt, was under Stage 2 Fire Ban Restrictions, and was experiencing a record-year drought. The pair originally faced 4th degree felony arson charges, but all felony charges were later dropped. They subsequently accepted a plea deal to plea guilty to a misdemeanor charge each and were sentenced to 45 days in jail on work release, 1,500 hours of community service, $100,000 of restitution each and five years of probation. The fire destroyed the homes of five separate families in El Jebel and destroyed a cabin on Basalt Mountain. On September 4, 2018, the fire was downgraded to a Burned Area Response. Colorado Parks and Wildlife outlaws tracer round ammunition at the Lake Christine Wildlife Shooting Range in Basalt, and this provision was in effect on July 3rd.  Closures  Upper Cattle Creek in the southbound direction and Kelly Lake Road were closed.  Evacuations  2100 residents were evacuated in areas of Basalt, the Fryingpan River, Missouri Heights, and El Jebel. Two evacuation centers were opened; one at Basalt High School in Basalt, and the other at the Roaring Fork High School in Carbondale. The Red Cross assisted in the evacuation efforts. On July 20, 2018 the fire grew again, causing pre evacuation orders to be put in place for Cedar Drive, Toner Creek, Seven Castles and Taylor Road.

History  On March 11, 1911 a group called Traveler's Club met at the Lodge of Salisbury Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, on the second floor of the Meroney Theater in Salisbury, North Carolina. At this meeting a library association was formed. Archibald Henderson Boyden, a former mayor of Salisbury and a leader and later chairman of the city school board, was elected chairman of the library association. Boyden family offered to house the first public library of Salisbury on the property they owned in the small Henderson Law Office located in the corner of Church and Fisher Streets. In 1952 A.H.Boyden's daughter, Mrs.Burton Craig gifted the lot with the law office to Rowan County for the purpose of establishing a library. Boyden heirs donated additional $75,000 for the construction of the new library building. In 1913 Mrs. Mamie Linton accepted the position of a librarian. During this time the library moved to the former County Courthouse, dubbed the Community Building, and shared space with the police station. In 1936 the library employed its first professionally trained librarian, Miss Edith Montcalm Clark, who served as Director of Rowan Public Library for 36 years until 1972. Ms.Clark was the person who made the library from cataloging the book collection to physical expansion of the library into Spencer, China Grove, Faith, Landis, and Rockwell. She changed the name of the library from Salisbury to Rowan to reflect the spread of libraries in the county. In November 2019, Melissa Oleen took over as Library Director after the retirement of Jeff Hall.

Kitty from Kansas City is a 1931 animated short film which is presented by Max Fleischer and was originally released by Paramount Pictures. The film, with features Betty Boop as she attempts to comically get to Rudy Valley, features a sing-along of the song \\"Kitty From Kansas City\\", a song that Vallee released on vinyl via the Victor record label. Hence the name of Betty Boop's destination; it features a cameo of Rudy Vallee, who is featured half-way through the film. He invites the audience, via disguise, to sing-along to the title song. The song which is sung during the film is about a woman who is called Kitty. The song discusses that she was unintelligent and was also unattractive, but is still loved nonetheless. Copyrighted on the 3rd of November 1931, and released 2 days prior, the film is part of the \\"follow the bouncing ball\\" series of films entitled Screen Songs. These sets of films would invite the audience to sing along to a selected song. Plot Rudy Vallee tipping his hat. The film begins with Betty Boop walking to the train station, with her cat, parrot and her suitcase. After descending onto the station, she asks a railroad worker about the distance between her current location and to 'Rudy Valley'. He informs her that the train will be arriving soon at the station. Whilst waiting for the train, the parrot bits Betty in the buttocks whilst she is turned away. She blames the railroad worker and strikes him in the face. After that, Betty is caught on a hook by an oncoming train. The train takes her to 'Rudy Valley', where she had intended on going. Once the train stops, Betty then hears some singing, and states on how that is Vallee. The film then transitions to a man with a mustache singing and smoking a cigar. The man then breaks the 4th wall, by asking the audience if they would be interested in hearing a song about his old girlfriend, whose name was Kitty. The bouncing ball then appears, which the man tips his hat to. The ball comically tips him back. The man then asks for the audience to get ready for the song, as it is about to start. Then the song commences, with the man singing it. During the song, the man gives examples about Kitty's unintelligence; such as Kitty thinking that Mussolini (then fascist leader of Italy) was an exercise, another example was she thinking that No man's land (a section of battlefield unoccupied during a war) was an old maid's room, and also thinking that Rudy Valley, was a place between two hills. Then, the man takes off his fake mustache, and it is discovered that the man is Rudy Vallee. Vallee then tips his hat to the audience. In the next section of the film, Kitty, who is still portrayed by Betty Boop, perform actions according to the lyrics, such as weighing herself during the lyric about her weight, and drinking in excessive amounts during the lyric about her gaining weight. She also comically gets the order of food utensils wrong, by putting a block of ice into the oven and putting coal in the fridge. In the final section of the film, Kitty attempts to mount on a horse, but she fails, as her weight tires the horse. Kitty agrees to comically be the horse and carry the actual horse, for which the actual horse agrees. However, she carrying the horse makes the horse obese. So, the horse carries Kitty from then on. Their journey leads them to the sea, where Kitty is thrown into by the horse. After that, Kitty then tries to swim back up multiple times, but the waves drag her back every time. However, Kitty comically finds a plug and pulls it out, which comically drains the entire ocean. The film ends with a parade featuring Kitty and several sea animals. Characters In the film, there are a variety of characters. The main characters is Kitty, who is portrayed by Betty Boop. She attempts to go to 'Rudy Valley', which is a pun on Rudy Vallee, who (according to the song) was Kitty's former boyfriend. There is Kitty's animals, which are both a cat and a parrot. Kitty attempts to take them both to a train to her intended destination, but fails, as she is caught on a hook from another train. The film also features a cameo from Rudy Vallee, who is originally portrayed in a disguise. He reveals his true identity near the end of the song. Reception Kitty from Kansas City received mixed reviews from the cinema magazines at that time. Whilst The Film Daily said that the film was a \\"clever combination\\" of animation and song. Variety said that the film had \\"too much of a buildup for a tune made popular some time back by Rudy Vallee\\". The magazine also stated that the \\"accompanying cartoon footage is not enough\\" to save the film.

Espace Bernadette Soubirous Nevers is a former convent and the motherhouse of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers in Nevers, France, and is where the body of Saint Bernadette reposes. In 1970, it was converted into a sanctuary run by volunteers and a few sisters who administer to pilgrims and manage the building. History In 1853, Dominique-Augustin Duf√™tre, bishop of Nevers, assigned the Church of Saint Lupus and Saint Gildard in Nevers to be rebuilt as a religious house for the Sisters of Charity of Nevers. By that time, not much was left but a rectangular building; the remains of the thirteenth-century were used to build the Saint Gildard Convent, which was officially consecrated on 15 July 1856. This is the motherhouse of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers, where in 1866 Bernadette of Lourdes entered to do her novitiate and where she died in 1879. Her body was buried on the convent grounds, in a special crypt, separate from the graves of the other sisters. The gold sarcophagus/reliquary containing the incorrupt body of Saint Bernadette Soubirous. In 1970, the convent was changed into a sanctuary site and now the rooms are used as hotel rooms. The chapel was also significantly transformed, changing from a Tridentine altar into a plain Novus ordo altar, and the tabernacle was also moved to a side altar. Saint Bernadette's body lies to the right of the main altar in a glass reliquary. Interior The convent was transformed into a sanctuary, which significantly changed the interior setting. The rooms that the Sisters would use were changed into lodging rooms for pilgrims. The cloister, with huge glass windows, overlooks the flowerbeds. Its sunlit corridors lead to lounges, reading rooms, conference rooms and dining rooms. Located in a unique setting in the town centre, Espace Bernadette provides sleeping accommodation for up to 200 people. Bedrooms are located on the first and second floors. The novitiate room was converted into a chapel room. It is here that in July 1866, wearing her Pyrenean costume, Bernadette told the story of the apparitions for the last time to 300 Sisters. The infirmary, where Bernadette died at the age of 35, is now Holy Cross Oratory. During her thirteen years at Saint Gildard, she served as assistant-nurse, head-nurse and sacristan during which time she was often ill. Espace Bernadette also offers multi-purpose rooms with professional equipment for up to 250 people. Additionally, food is served in the dining rooms seven days a week, where up to 200 people can be catered for daily. Sleeping accommodations at Espace Bernadette, formerly the rooms of nuns when the building was a convent. Museum In 1958, the Sisters of Charity had a museum built to teach pilgrims about the life of Saint Bernadette, in particular her sufferings. The museum highlights the various steps in Bernadette‚Äôs life: the cachot, the grotto, Hospice of Lourdes and her time in Nevers. Some photographs and artefacts depict her daily life. Bernadette's Chapel Bernadette‚Äôs body, when exhumed for the process of beatification, was found to be intact, to the surprise of those present. Since 3 August 1925, following her beatification, Bernadette‚Äôs body lies in a glass shrine in the chapel of the convent of Saint- Gildard in Nevers. Built on the ruins of Saint Gildard‚Äôs Abbey, this simple and bright chapel was consecrated in 1856 when the community of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers moved into this new building, and changed its name from Saint Gildard to Bernadette's chapel when the convent was turned into a sanctuary. Grotto View of the replica grotto at Nevers, with a statue of Bernadette kneeling, reenacting the 1858 apparitions. The grotto was created in 1884, five years the death of Bernadette, demanded by Marie Therese Vauzou, the mother superior of the convent who also served as the mistress of novices during Bernadette's novitiate. It was constructed to resemble the grotto in Lourdes, and a piece of rock that the Virgin Mary stood on was taken from the grotto of Massabielle and attached to the replica grotto in Nevers. The grotto also offers candles that can be bought and lit in the grotto which feature a picture of Bernadette on them. Saint Joseph's Chapel Bernadette Soubirous died on 16 April 1879 and was interred in Saint Joseph's chapel for 40 years. The chapel is located in the middle of the sanctuary gardens, at the end of an avenue lined with beautiful lime trees. The chapel surprisingly contains a Tridentine altar, which contrasts with the significant transformation that took place in the former convent's chapel. A stained flag image of Our Lady of Lourdes shines above the altar. Nearby is also the statue of Our Lady of the Waters. The paths which cross the large gardens lead to this statue in front of which Bernadette chose to pray.

Her plastic language was based on computer systematic calculation. Asins pioneered the convergence between theoretical computer science and the minimal and geometrical tendencies of the 1960s. She belongs to the first generation of artists using computers to generate art.  Life and career  Interior views of Museo Reina Sofia Asins' artistic research was initially linked to the experimental circles that emerged in Spain during the final decades of the Francoist dictatorship. Among these groups was the Cooperativa de Producci√≥n Art√≠stica y Artesana (Cooperative of Art and Crafts), where fine arts formed a whole with poetry, linguistics, music, and architecture. The Centro de C√°lculo (Computer Center) of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, active between 1966 and 1982, was another important group where Asins pioneered the genre of Computer Art. To her initial experiences in Spain, Elena Asins extended her artistic and intellectual research in centers such as the University of Stuttgart, Columbia University and the New School for Social Research in New York. In these institutions, she studied the theoretic computational aesthetic of Max Bense, the linguistic theories of Noam Chomsky, the music of Mozart and mystical texts from the Old and New Testament to Wittgenstein's philosophy In conversation with art historian Joan Robledo-Palop, the artist explains the foundation of her aesthetic: > I work on white paper with black lines or on black paper with white lines; > these have been my first works. It was a work where I was searching for > myself, but it was so long ago that I almost cannot recall. I started > working with abstraction when I was 23 years old. Additionally, what > interests me is the essence of the structure, to have in my hand the base of > all possible construction. Naturally, colors do not give you this kind of > understanding; that is something that is provided by a structure, which > let's say is a way of organizing the world. The organization of elements > that produce a world; it produces an aesthetic. It is a play in a > Wittgensteinian sense that reveals the truth or the logic of things.  Awards and reception  In 2006, Elena Asins received the Gold Medal of Fine Arts from the Government of Spain, and in 2011 the National Award for Plastic Arts. In 2011, the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid presented the most comprehensive exhibition of the artist entitled Elena Asins: Fragmentos de la memoria. In 2017, the exhibition traveled to the Museo de las Artes de la Universidad de Guadalajara, Mexico.  Monumental works  Since the 1980s, Asins devoted an important effort to public sculpture. Examples of her work are permanently installed in the Museo al Aire Libre (Fuengirola, Malaga), Vitoria (Alava), Berantevilla (Alava), and Zarautz (Gipuzkoa), where she created Canons 22, one of her most monumental works installed in front of the seascape.  Collections  Asins' work is represented in many permanent collections across the world. The Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid has the largest body of work in a public collection, since the museum became the recipient of her estate and personal archive in 2015. Work in other public collections include the Spanish Institute in New York, Kulturboherde (Hamburg), Institut Valencia d'Art Modern ‚Äî IVAM (Valencia), Museo de Bellas Artes de Alava (Vitoria), Fundacion March (Madrid), Archivo Lafuente (Santander), Fundacion Chirivella Soriano, (Valencia), Collection Leonora and Jimmy Belilty (Caracas, Venezuela), Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation, CIFO (Miami, FL) and The Tanya Capriles de Brillembourg Collection (USA) among many others.

The congregation is a member of ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians. Front of First Presbyterian Church (Corpus Christi, Texas). Located at 430 S. Carancahua St. Constructed in 1929.  History  While there was an attempt to organize a Presbyterian Church in Corpus Christi as early as 1859, that congregation appears to have disbanded during the Civil War. The history of the current First Presbyterian dates to July 10, 1866 when several of the prominent citizens of the city, including the Rev. William Mitchell and his son, John B. Mitchell, Dr. E.T. Merriman, W.H. Maltby, Jacob Ziegler, George F. Evans, and L.D. Brewster, met at the little shell concrete and frame home of Texas patriot John Pollan to discuss building a Presbyterian Church in the young city, creating the Presbyterian Society. The primary aim of this group was to raise money for the construction of a Presbyterian Church. In December, 1866, Captain Richard King of the King Ranch donated land on the bluff, overlooking Corpus Christi Bay, as the site of the new church building. On May 12, 1867, at the home of Dr. and Mrs. E.T. Merriman, the First Presbyterian Church of Corpus Christi was chartered by the Old School General Assembly of the old ‚Äúnorthern‚Äù Presbyterian Church with seven members ‚Äì six women and one man. Rev. William Mitchell became the first pastor and the charter members were John Pollan and his wife Mary, along with their daughters Mrs. Mary H. Mathis and Minerva V. Pollan, Mrs. Elizabeth Fusselman Merriman, Mrs. Mary J. Davis Fullerton, and Mrs. Sarah B. Mitchell, the minister's wife. Construction materials were purchased for a building, but the yellow fever epidemic in the summer of 1867, which killed one-fifth of the city's population, stopped the work before it could start. The wooden construction materials were used instead to build coffins. By the time the epidemic was over the church had lost its minister and his infant grandson, Dr. Merriman, two members of the Pollan family, and the young son of Perry and Rachel Doddridge, their only child. The original church building of First Presbyterian Church of Corpus Christi. Construction began in 1867. In 1868 the church's first building was standing, still without window panes or pews, and with only a dirt floor. In February, 1869 the congregation voted unanimously to apply for membership to the Presbytery of Newark, New Jersey, along with a request for assistance from the presbytery's Church Erection Board to complete the unfinished sanctuary. The presbytery responded with a loan of $600. On March 11, 1872 the congregation voted to transfer its membership to the Presbytery of Western Texas of the Presbyterian Church in the US (the former ‚Äúsouthern‚Äù church). The minister at the time, W.E. Caldwell, wrote, ‚ÄúThis was done out of no unkind feeling to our northern brethren, but out of regard for the interests of Christ‚Äôs cause, as connected with the people here.‚Äù By 1875 the membership grew to fifty. Two of the early ministers of the church married members of the church. The Rev. J.R. Jacobs, who served as the fifth pastor of the church from 1879-1884, married Nancy Caldwell, the only daughter of the Rev. W.E. Caldwell, the third minister to serve First Presbyterian. They were the first couple to live in the church's manse, which was completed in 1879 on land donated by Richard and Henrietta King. The Rev. J.R. Howerton, who served from 1885-1887, married Mary Fullerton, the daughter of charter member Mary J. Davis Fullerton. Corpus Christi was Howerton's first pastorate and he went on to serve as moderator of the General Assembly and as a professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy at Washington and Lee University. Howerton was also the founder of Montreat, the Presbyterian retreat center and college in North Carolina.  Second location  Postcard of second location of First Presbyterian Church (Corpus Christi, Texas) Early in the 1900s lots were purchased where the present Wells Fargo Tower, formerly the elegant Driscoll Hotel, is located. A handsome red brick structure was erected by Henrietta King, now a widow, in memory of her husband, Capt. Richard King, with a beautiful Tiffany stained glass windows in memory of her father, the Rev. Hiram Chamberlain, who had established the first Presbyterian church in South Texas at Brownsville in the 1850s. Following the disastrous hurricane and tidal wave of 1919, the Red Brick Church served as shelter and sustenance for the city. Members of the congregation worked from daylight until late at night at the church to help withy relief, and the women of the church provided meals to about 700 people a day who had been left homeless by the storm. Courtyard of First Presbyterian Church (Corpus Christi, Texas) constructed in 1970.  Third and current location  The sanctuary of First Presbyterian Church of Corpus Christi. Photo taken from balcony. In 1903, Mrs. Rachel Doddridge bequeathed her home on Upper Broadway to the church. In 1928, the Red Brick church on North Broadway was sold and a tabernacle was erected on the Doddridge estate as a place of worship while the present sanctuary was constructed during the pastorate of Dr. Charlton Storey. On August 17, 1930, the present sanctuary, designed by Dallas, Texas architect Wyatt C. Hedrick, was dedicated and the congregation moved into its present home. Dr. Storey, who had accepted a call the previous September to a church in North Carolina, returned to preach for the dedication. His morning sermon was titled, ‚ÄúThe Sanctuary of God,‚Äù and the evening sermon, ‚ÄúThe Open Door.‚Äù Combined attendance at the two services was over 2,000 and the other churches in town cancelled their evening services in order to participate. One of the most remarkable features of the new sanctuary is the magnificent stained glass, a rare benefit of the Great Depression. Payne Studios of New Jersey was anxious to keep their artisans employed during the Depression and so the church was able to purchase the windows ‚Äúat unbelievably attractive prices.‚Äù Today the three story Doddridge building, a memorial to the Doddridge family, houses the church's offices, choir facilities, library, chapel, children's Sunday School rooms, and dorms for visiting mission groups.

The Gallic Boii surprised and destroyed a Roman army of 25,000 men under the consul-elect Lucius Postumius Albinus. Only ten men escaped the ambush, few prisoners were taken and Postumius was killed, decapitated and his skull covered with gold by the Boii. News of the military disaster, coming either several days or months after the defeat at Cannae, triggered a renewed panic in Rome and the Romans postponed military operations against the Gauls until the conclusion of the Second Punic War. Prelude In 216 BC, the Romans elected Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro as consuls. The consuls gave a legion to Lucius Postumius Albinus to punish the Gallic tribes in Cisalpine Gaul that had supplied troops to Hannibal's Carthaginian army. After Hannibal's crushing victory at the Battle of Cannae, Postumius was elected Roman consul for the third time and in absentia, since he was in command of the Roman legion in Cisalpine Gaul. Postumius' army strength was increased to two Roman legions and he raised allied troops along the Adriatic coast, raising the number of his soldiers to 25,000. Battle Postumius' army marched through a large forest called Litana by the Gauls. The Boii had cut the trees so that unsupported, they would remain standing, but if given a slight push would topple over. As the Romans went along a road in the forest, the Boii secured a perimeter outside it and pushed over the trees on the outer edges. The trees fell on each other and crashed onto the road from both sides, killing Roman soldiers and horses and destroying equipment. Most of the soldiers died under the weight of the trees trunks and branches and the panicked survivors were slaughtered by the Boii waiting outside the forest. A party of Romans tried to escape across a river, but were captured by the Boii who had already taken the bridge over it. Few Roman prisoners were taken and only ten men survived the disaster. Postumius fought to avoid capture but was killed, decapitated and his head taken to a Boii sacred temple, where the skin was scraped off and the bare skull covered with gold. It was used as a cup for drinking by the Boii high priest. The Boii also took a vast amount of loot, with the Roman goods handily concentrated along the forest road. Aftermath A panic hit the city of Rome upon arrival of the news. The Roman Senate ordered aediles to patrol the streets, open shops and disperse any sign of defeatism. Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, master of horse and also consul-elect for 215 BC, consoled the Senate by emphasizing the importance of defeating Hannibal, with the Gauls only a secondary priority for Roman strategy.

It was with his creation of medicine that men began deluding himself about the illusive power to ordain life and death. Be it naivety or arrogance, we glory in awe, eyes closed; deaf to the quiet humming of destruction that lingers on the edge of desire. As it goes, blood weeps more eagerly than tears in a merciless world.\\" Cast *Tony Leung Ka-fai as a psychologist serving for the police force *Takeshi Kaneshiro as an heir of a major financial company hoping to wipe out the dark history of his family *Sean Lau as a double-faced police officer *Louis Koo as Ching Man-sing (), a killer with a complicated past *Gao Yuanyuan as a retired therapist *Michelle Wai *Wyman Wong *Jiang Peiyao as Little Yip (), a killer *Rose Maria Velasco *Carl Ng *Wilson Lam *Ching Tung *Tony Liu *Clement Fung *Lo Hoi-pang *Jerald Chan *Lowell Lo *Kam Kwok-leung *Paw Hee-ching *Jason Choi *Conan Lee *Wang Shunde *Philippe Joly as Enzo Production The project was first announced on 25 March at the 2015 Hong Kong Filmart as Juno Mak's second directorial feature after the 2013 film, Rigor Mortis.

Wise released the EP Blisters in 2016 and his debut studio album soil in 2018. Early life Wise was raised in Baltimore, Maryland. He grew up amongst a religious family; his father owned a Christian bookstore and his mother was a choir director. Wise joined the church choir as a child and grew up with classical and gospel music as a primary influence. He later moved to Philadelphia, where he attended the University of the Arts. Although Wise was initially interested in becoming a classical singer, he was rejected from conservatories he applied to. Career After leaving the University of the Arts, Wise spent time in Paris and in Philadelphia's neo-soul scene. However, his voice was seen as closer in tone to opera than to his peers in neo-soul. Wise then moved to New York, where he released his first single \\"Curiosity of Other Men\\" in 2014. The song led to Wise's eventual signing with Tri Angle records in 2015 and the release of Wise's debut EP, blisters, in 2016. The EP featured production from The Haxan Cloak, who has worked with artists including Bj√∂rk and The Body. blisters debuted to extremely positive reviews from critics. Wise began work on his debut studio album in 2017 with producers including Clams Casino, Katie Gately, and Adele collaborator Paul Epworth. The album was released on June 8, 2018 to rave reviews from critics.

It was formed in 1978 through the unification of the Journal of Woodsville, New Hampshire and the United Opinion of Bradford. The Bradford Journal-opinion is published weekly on Wednesdays and it covers the areas of Orange County, Vermont and Grafton County, New Hampshire. According to the American Newspapers Representative database, the Journal-Opinion has a weekly paid circulation of 4,700 and a free circulation of 500.  Notable history  The history of the Vermont-based part of the paper can be traced back to 1865, when Araunah A. Earle started a paper called National Opinion in Bradford. Within a year, Earle had sold the paper to David W. Cobb, who ran the paper until 1874. In 1874, Ben Stanton was hired as the publisher and editor, and Stanton changed the paper's name to Bradford Opinion. Between 1879 and 1881, disputes and financial troubles led to the publication of two competing versions of the weekly paper, one called Bradford Opinion (published by the Orange County Publishing Company) and the other called Stanton's Bradford Opinion. In 1881, Henry E. Parker bought both papers and united them under the name United Opinion and began publishing the paper daily. The paper changed ownership and leadership several times between 1884 and 1947. In December 1947, a fire started in the building where the paper was printed. The fire spread rapidly across several town buildings, destroying the paper‚Äôs building and several commercial buildings. After the fire, the United Opinion was printed in conjunction with the White River Valley Herald until 1970, when it was sold and consolidated with the North Country Journal. During the next eight years, the paper was printed under three titles, the North Country Journal Opinion, the Journal-opinion, and the United Opinion. The publishers eventually renamed the paper Journal-opinion. In 2007, a reporter for the Bradford Journal-opinion was at the center of a Vermont Supreme Court case relating to journalists' First Amendment rights. The reporter, Hank Buermeyer, had reported on a Select Board meeting during which the Select Board members chose a new road foreman for the town of Topsham. The unsuccessful candidate, James Spooner, sued the town for age discrimination based on Buermeyer‚Äôs reports that the Select Board chose the other candidate because he was younger and could serve the town longer. As part of the suit, Spooner tried to compel Buermeyer to testify about what he heard during the meeting; Buermeyer and the Bradford Journal-opinion declined the request saying that the reporter had qualified privilege unless the plaintiff could prove that he could not get similar testimony from others who witnessed the event. Vermont‚Äôs five-member Supreme Court ruled in favor of Spooner, citing the 1972 Supreme Court case Branzburg v. Hayes, in which the high court stated that the First Amendment does not protect journalists from being compelled to testify.

A frequent motivation for such Hybrid Access Networks is to combine one xDSL network with a wireless network such as LTE. The technology is generic and can be applied to combine different types of access networks such as DOCSIS, WiMAX, 5G or satellite networks. The Broadband Forum has specified an architecture for the deployment of such networks. Use cases One of the main motivations for such Hybrid Access Networks is to provide faster Internet services in rural areas where it is not always cost-effective to deploy faster xDSL technologies such as G.Fast or VDSL2 that cannot cover long distances between the street cabinet and the home. Several governments, notably in Europe, require network operators to provide fast Internet services to all inhabitants with a minimum of 30 Mbps by 2020. A second use case is to improve the reliability of the access link given that it is unlikely that both the xDSL network and the wireless network will fail at the same time. A third motivation is the fast service turnup. The customer can immediately install the hybrid network access and use the wireless leg while the network operator is installing the wired part. Technology Several techniques are defined by the Broadband Forum to create Hybrid Access Networks. To illustrate them, we assume that the enduser has an hybrid CPE router that is attached to both a wired access network such as xDSL and a wireless on such as LTE. Other deployments are possible, e.g. the enduser might have two different access routers that are linked together by a cable instead of a single hybrid CPE router. The first deployment scenario is where the network operator provides a hybrid CPE router to each subscriber but no specialised equipment in the operator's network. There are two possible configurations for IP addresses. A first deployment scenario is to allocate different IP addresses to the wired and wireless interfaces. In this case, the hybrid CPE router needs to load- balance intelligently the packets over the two networks. In particular, it must ensure that all packets belonging to a given TCP connection are sent over the same interface. A second deployment scenario is to allocate the same IP address to both the wired and the wireless networks and configure the routing in these networks to ensure that packets are correctly routed. The second deployment scenario is where the network operator provides a hybrid CPE router to each subscriber and installs a Hybrid Aggregation Gateway inside its access networks. The Hybrid Aggregation Gateway plays an important role in balancing the packets sent by and destined to the hybrid CPE router over the two access networks. Two technologies have been defined and deployed to enable hybrid CPE routers to interact with Hybrid Aggregation Gateways. The main objective of these technologies is to efficiently use the two access links even if they have different delay and bandwidth. One technical difficulty that occurs when distributing packets over such heterogeneous links is to accurately detect congestion, notably on the wireless network whose bandwidth can vary quickly, and cope with the reordering which is caused by the delay difference. One approach uses GRE tunnels to hide the two links to the upper layer protocol. Both the hybrid CPE and the HAG need to reorder the received packets to ensure that TCP receives in-sequence packets. The second approach uses Multipath TCP, a recent TCP extension that has been designed to enable the transmission of the packets that belong to a single session across different links. This approach leverages the ability of MPTCP to efficiently handle congestion and cope with reordering on the heterogeneous access links. MPTCP needs support in both the host and the server{{cite IETF title=TCP Extensions for Multipath Operation with Multiple Addresses date=Jan 2013autolink=yes publisher=IETFrfc=rfc6824}. Two approaches have been defined for the interactions between the hybrid CPE router and the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway. The transparent mode is used when the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway is placed on the path of all packets sent by the hybrid CPE router. Otherwise, the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway includes a TCP converter as defined in . Additional details on Hybrid Access Networks and their deployment are described in Hybrid Access Network Deployments The first commercial deployments started in 2015. Several deployments of Hybrid Access Networks have already been documented. * Deutsche Telekom has deployed Hybrid Access Networks by using GRE Tunnels * Proximus has deployed Hybrid Access Networks by using Multipath TCP * KPN has deployed hybrid Access Networks by using Multipath TCP.

Biography First married at the age of 11, Eichenbaum soon divorced when his father-in-law suspected him of secular leanings. He married again in 1815 and settled in Zamo≈õƒá, adopting the name Eichenbaum in order to obtain a resident's permit. There he encountered a circle of progressive Jewish youths who were followers of the \\"Berlin culture,\\" and began studying Hebrew, German, philosophy, and (in particular) mathematics. In 1819 he translated Euclid's Elements from German into Hebrew. He worked as a private tutor, travelling between different towns of southern Russia, teaching Hebrew subjects and mathematics in the houses of wealthy people. In 1835 at Odessa (then the educational centre of the south-Russian Jews), Eichenbaum opened a private school for Jewish children. In 1836 he published Kol Zimrah, one of the first books of Hebrew poetry published in the Haskalah period. In 1840 he published Ha-Kerav, a book in verse describing the moves in the game of chess. In the course of a few years the pedagogic and literary labors of Eichenbaum attracted the attention of the Russian government, which in 1844 appointed him overseer of the Jewish school in Kishinev, and in 1850 chief inspector of the new rabbinical school opened by the Russian government in Zhitomir. He retained this position until his death. In the later years of his life he published a textbook of arithmetic in Hebrew, ·∏§okmat ha-Shi'urim, (1857), and an allegorical poem, \\"Ha-Kosem,\\" in Ha-Meli·∫ì (1861).

Description of the gall The gall is ovoid and bladder like, 11 mm long and 5 mm across, and may broaden the leaf. A single white larva lives within the gall which is only found on purple willow (S. purpurea) and its hybrids. Euura vesicator is one of two closely related species in the Euura vesicator subgroup; the other being E. pustulator.

Its location was announced in early 2011, construction started in March, and the unit was commissioned in September, 2011. A major motivation for the station was early detection of Pacific Northwest windstorms; a proponent, Professor Cliff Mass of the University of Washington, said it would provide an additional 6 to 12 hour storm warning to residents of the Pacific Northwest. Location The radar dome, the first on Washington's coast, is on a steel tower atop a high hill between Copalis Beach and Copalis Crossing, off State Route 109. Prior to its construction, coastal coverage from the nearest radar at Camano Island on Puget Sound was limited by the Olympic Mountains.

Administratively, it is situated in the municipalities of Bansko and Gotse Delchev, Blagoevgrad Province. According to the legend, the gorge was named after a maiden, who fought the Ottoman Turks defending the fortress of Momina Kula and plunged into the abyss upon seeing that the stronghold was about to fall.  Geography  Momina Klisura forms the divide between the Pirin Mountains in the west and the westernmost ridge of the Rhodope Mountains, Dabrash, in the east. It links the south-easternmost part of the Razlog Valley in the north and the northernmost part of the Gotse Delchev Valley in the south. The gorge is about 25 km long with an average altitude of 642 m. It is narrow with steep slopes dug into metamorphic rocks, late Triassic sediment and vulcanite. The river Retizhe, a right tributary of the Mesta, flows into its main course at Momina Klisura. The gorge takes its beginning east of the town of Dobrinishte, at the confluence with Bezbog River at an altitude of 693 m and heads to the south and south-east. The middle section is in the area of the village of Mesta, where the altitude is 642 m. Momina Klisura ends to the south-east of the village of Gospodintsi in the Gotse Delchev Valley at an altitude of 544 m. Along its length are located the villages of Filipovo, Mesta and Gospodintsi, as well as the ruins of the late antique and medieval fortress Momina Kula and another fortress near Gospodintsi. A 27.4 km long section of the second class road II-19 between Simitli, Bansko, Gotse Delchev and Ilinden at the border with Greece follows the gorge.

She and her husband Dick Ponzi also established Oregon's first craft brewery, Bridgeport Brewing Company.Linfield College, \\"Dick & Nancy Ponzi: Ponzi Vineyards\\" (2010). Bringing Vines to the Valley Exhibit. Image. Submission 12. http://digitalcommons.linfield.edu/vines_gallery/12/  Early life  Ponzi was born in the Southern Californian town of Fullerton and spent her childhood traveling all over the world. She met Dick Ponzi after he moved to California for a job in the aerospace industry and the couple married in 1962.  Career   Teaching  While living in California, Ponzi worked as a teacher at a Montessori school.  Ponzi Vineyards  Nancy and Dick Ponzi check a sample from a wine barrel. After several research trips to Burgundy, Ponzi and her husband moved their family to the Willamette Valley and purchased 20 acres of land southwest of Portland, Oregon, in 1969. They established Ponzi Vineyards in 1970. At the time, there were just four other wineries in the state. The location was close to Portland, an important factor as they expected the city to be their main market. In 1974, they produced their first vintage of 100 cases of Pinot noir and quickly became known as innovators in enology and viticulture. In the early years of the vineyard, Ponzi continued to work as a teacher while also marketing the wine they produced. The Ponzis planted a two- acre plot of Pinot noir clones in 1975 in a joint venture with Oregon State University to test the clones. In 1981, they purchased a 20-acre parcel that included these two acres, creating their Abetina vineyard (named for the fir trees on the property). The same year they purchased 10 acres downslope from Abetina, which became the Madrona vineyard. Eight acres on the Madrona site were planted with Pinot noir in 1985. Ponzi Vineyards was among the first to plant Pinot gris commercially in Oregon in 1978, releasing the first bottling in 1984. In 1991, the Ponzis purchased a 65-acre vineyard named Aurora, which included plantings that used to study stocks, varieties and clones. In 2008, the Ponzis designed and built a four-level, gravity-flow winery measuring 30,000 square feet. It is noted for its eco-friendliness and high level of sustainability. Ponzi's vineyards are LIVE (Low Input Viticulture & Enology) certified.  Bridgeport Brewing  Ponzi and her husband also founded Oregon's first craft brewery, Bridgeport Brewing Company, in 1984, a move which is credited with launching the area's craft brewing craze and helping to popularize India Pale Ale in the United States. They sold the brewery in 1995 to The Gambrinus Company.  Community Work  Ponzi was and remains active in community and charitable efforts. She co-founded the Consumers' Food Council, was a founding director of the Washington County Wineries Association and held various offices in the Oregon Winegrowers Association. She also co- founded the International Pinot Noir Celebration in 1987, a yearly international event that draws thousands of attendees to McMinnville, Oregon. In 1991, Ponzi partnered with Tuality Healthcare and founded ¬°Salud!, an organization that assists vineyard workers and their families with accessing healthcare and provides wellness screenings via a mobile medical unit. She currently serves on Tuality Healthcare's Board of Directors. She co-founded Oregon Pinot Camp in 2000, an annual trade-education event that attracts wine industry professionals to the Willamette Valley.  Other  On December 1, 2009, Ponzi published The Ponzi Vineyards Cookbook, a collection of recipes she developed after decades of feeding family, guests and vineyard crews. Interspersed throughout the book are anecdotes about life in the vineyard. She had previously published recipes in The Vintner's Kitchen by Bill King.  Family  Nancy and Dick Ponzi and their children Luisa, Michel and Anna Maria Ponzi married Dick Ponzi in 1962 in California. The entire family was involved in the vineyards and winemaking from the start, with the Ponzi children helping after school and on weekends. Once grown, the children pursued other interests: Anna Maria worked in the magazine business on the East Coast before returning to the winery in 1992; Luisa attended Portland State University and prepared for medical school, returning to the family business in 1990 and deciding to pursue winemaking. She went on to train in Burgundy, France, and earn a degree in viticulture and enology. In 1993, Dick Ponzi passed the title and duties of Winemaker to her.  Awards and Recognition  In 2007, the Oregon Wine Board awarded Dick and Nancy Ponzi a Lifetime Achievement Award.  Influence  In 1985, Ponzi was among a group that authored a bill that led to the legalization of brewpubs and tasting rooms in Oregon.

Amateur teams are allowed to sell their home advantage. Sixth Round The draw for the sixth round was made on 28 August 2018 and included the 16 teams from the Belgian First Division A, which were all seeded and could not meet each other. All non-professional teams (division 3 and below) automatically received home advantage if their stadium had sufficient capacity and floodlight luminosity, which was the case for all teams except Duffel and Mandel United. Seventh Round The draw for the seventh round was made immediately after the last game of the sixth round, between Anderlecht and Union SG, was finished. Six teams outside the top division qualified for this round, with Mandel United from the Belgian Second Amateur Division the lowest still in the competition. The matches will be played on 4, 5 and 6 December 2018. Quarter-finals The draw for the quarter-finals was made on 5 December 2018, with the matches were played on 18 and 19 December 2018. Both Mechelen and Union SG, the two remaining teams from outside the top division managed to qualify for the Semi-finals. Semi-finals The draw for the semi- finals was made on 19 December, after completion of the last matches of the quarter-finals. As the two teams remaining from the 2018‚Äì19 Belgian First Division B, Mechelen and Union SG, were drawn against each other, at least one team from outside the top division will play the final, which last happened in the 2001 Belgian Cup Final when Belgian Second Division champions Lommel lost to Westerlo. The matches will be played on 23, 24, 29 and 30 January 2019. First Legs Second Legs Final The final took place on 1 May 2019 at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels.

The competition began on 26 July 2019 and ended with the final on 1 August 2020. The winners of the competition qualified for the 2020‚Äì21 UEFA Europa League Group Stage. KV Mechelen were the defending champions, but were unable to defend their title as the club got banned from the competition for one season after being found guilty of match-fixing as part of the 2017‚Äì19 Belgian football fraud scandal. Competition format The competition consisted of ten rounds. Except for the semi-finals, all rounds are single- match elimination rounds. When tied after 90 minutes in the first three rounds, penalties are taken immediately. In rounds four to seven and the quarterfinals, when tied after 90 minutes first an extra time period of 30 minutes are played, then penalties are taken if still necessary. The semi- finals will be played over two legs, where the team winning on aggregate advances. The final will be played as a single match. Teams enter the competition in different rounds, based upon their 2019‚Äì20 league affiliation. Teams from the fifth-level Belgian Third Amateur Division or lower began in round 1. Belgian Second Amateur Division teams entered in round 2, Belgian First Amateur Division teams entered in round 3, Belgian First Division B teams in round 5 and finally the Belgian First Division A teams enter in round 6. With KV Mechelen being banned from the competition, one of the Belgian First Division B teams (Union SG) was drawn randomly to receive a bye in round 5 and progress automatically to round 6. {  - !

Advertising postcard for the Balasis acrobatic act performing in Variety / Vaudeville Theaters in Europe in 1922.  Early history  Named in 1957 to the Hall of Circus Immortals of the Circus Museum in Hamburg, Germany, the act originated in Austria-Hungary in the late 1800s. The family act followed the marriage of Victor Balasic Sr. to Paula Enders in Hungary in 1894 and the births of two sons: Alfred Joseph Balasic in 1896 and Victor Balasic, Jr. in 1897. Paula was from a circus family. Paula as a young woman had performed bareback riding in Europe with her sister Maria Enders Rieffenach with the Circus Enders, owned by their parents. The Circus Enders was sold in 1905 after the death of Paula's father. Victor Balasic Sr. and Paula Enders Balasic then formed their own acrobatic act and began performing in European theaters and circuses as \\"The Great Merkels\\". The stage name was taken from the name of Victor Balasic Sr.‚Äôs former tutor, Carl Merkel.  The act  \\"The Great Merkels\\" act was originally composed of Victor Sr., Paula and their sons Alfred and Victor Jr. The act consisted of gymnastics and acrobatics, with the family using naval costumes and sets as a theme. Acrobatic acts were highly regarded in Europe and often headlined shows. The performance, which normally lasted for 10 to 15 minutes, included strength and balance feats performed by different members of the family. Some of the feats involved the use of gymnastic apparatus. The Balasics' in 1906 created a shoulder-mounted frame which was worn by Paula and which held up an axle on which young Alfred and Victor Jr. would perform acrobatics. In 1907 they developed the \\"finger-stand\\" of five metal rods each on two bases, upon which Alfred would balance in a handstand, each of his fingers on a separate rod. Later newspaper reviews of the act in the U.S. describe Alfred performing this feat frequently and on occasion with Victor Jr. balancing on Alfred's back at the same time. But they were most famous for an acrobatic routine that involved the use of a seesaw and was performed by Alfred and Victor Jr. and would be advertised as ‚ÄúThe Balasis. The Boys with the Steel Heads‚Äù. In 1908 they began to perform as the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Only Head to Head Jugglers‚Äù. Alfred would jump from a chair onto the raised end of a seesaw. Victor Jr., standing on the lowered end, would be thrown into the air and would land head first on Alfred's head where they would maintain their balance using just their neck strength. A padded leather helmet worn by Alfred helped to cushion the head-to-head landing and the balance was held for several seconds. During the act they would repeat this feat, with Victor Jr. alternatively landing with his hand or feet onto Alfred's head. This feat would become their signature routine as they performed twice a day, traveling to the next theater each week, appearing in up to 50 theaters a year.  Europe  From 1905 through 1923, the Balasics performed throughout Europe with the \\"Das Program / Das Organ\\" variety agency headquartered in Berlin, Germany. They performed on the European equivalent of the American circus and vaudeville circuits. They toured with a group of performers and at times added individuals to their act, performing as the \\"5 Merkels\\" and the \\"8 Merkels\\". Having had great success in Europe for 6 years, the ‚Äú5 Merkels‚Äù traveled on tour to the United States and Canada in 1911 bringing their unique head-to- head balancing act to North America for 6 months. They toured the west coast of America on the Pantages vaudeville circuit, performing in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles. They also performed in Calgary and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, and appeared at the Empire Theater in New York City before returning to Europe in 1912. In something of an adventure, they were on tour in Imperial Russia when World War I broke out in 1914 between Austria-Hungary and Russia. As Austro-Hungarian citizens, they were interned by the Russian government and transported to Siberia. After several months, they were able to leave Russia by way of Scandinavia and returned home to Berlin. They began performing under a new stage name as the \\"5 Balasis\\" for the next several years in areas controlled by the Austro- Hungarian and German Empires during the war. The act stopped performing for a period of time between 1917 and 1918 when Victor Sr., Alfred and Victor Jr. served in the Austro-Hungarian army. Immediately after the war ended in November 1918, the act was resumed. Between 1918 and 1923, the \\"5 Balasis\\" performed all over Europe, including in Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Norway, France, Switzerland and Belgium. During this period, they developed a new theme titled \\"On the Society Football Grounds\\". The theme involved their playing the parts of a stadium crowd and costumed as the soccer players they interpreted the game through a series of head-to-head and hand-to-hand balancing stunts, with one of the troupe acting as the ball. In addition, the family performed a large variety of person-to- person balancing and strength moves, wire walking and ladder apparatus, and tumbling stunts. They were attractions at some of the most prestigious theaters in Europe, including the Alhambra in Paris, the Apollo in Vienna, the Cirque Royal in Brussels, the Corso in Zurich, and the Berlin Wintergarten theatre. During this time, Alfred met Maria Holz, an Austrian solo dance performer who had been a member of the Vienna State Ballet and was performing on the same theater bills as the ‚Äú5 Balasis‚Äù. She would eventually marry Alfred and become part of the act. In 1923, the Balasics were offered a contract to perform in North America. It was for 30 weeks of work, with the act to be paid four hundred dollars a week for performances in small cities, and four hundred fifty dollars (equal to six thousand five hundred in 2018 dollars) a week in large cities. They accepted, and in August 1923 Victor Sr., Paula, Alfred, Victor Jr., Maria Holz and a Danish girl who was employed as part of the Balasis troupe sailed from Gothenburg, Sweden, to New York City for a North American vaudeville tour.  North America  The \\"5 Balasis\\", \\"The Boys with the Steel Heads\\", \\"World's only Head to Head Jugglers\\", began performing on the B.F. Keith's vaudeville circuit beginning in Chicago in September 1923. The tour then proceeded, in succeeding weeks, with performances in St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Rochester, Toronto, Montreal, Boston, Keith's Palace Theatre in New York City, Newark, Washington, D.C. (on the same top billing at B.F. Keith's Theatre with Jack Benny, December 3, 1923), Norfolk, Richmond, Schenectady, Amsterdam, Albany and Binghamton, New York. That the \\"5 Balasis\\" had been booked to perform at the premiere venue in the country, B.F. Keith's Palace Theatre in New York City, was testament to how highly the act was regarded. Mark Henry of the Billboard theatrical trade publication in his November 5, 1923 review of their performance at the Palace Theatre described the act: > The Five Balasis, who opened, having been switched from the closing spot, > were a sensation with their acrobatic tricks, the concluding stunt in > particular being productive of decided approbation. It is a throw from a > teeter-board impact to a head-to-head catch without the hands being used to > assist. The writer has never seen this trick performed before! There followed immediately another U.S. tour on the Orpheum circuit where, during April 1924, they appeared on the same bill in Fort Worth, Texas with vaudeville star comedienne Eva Tanguay and on the same bill in Fort Smith, Arkansas, with Mae West, and received better reviews than either. Rather than return to Europe, the act signed new contracts and began performing on the Pantages circuit. Alfred and Maria married, and a son, Alfred Balasi, was born in September 1924 in Portland, Oregon. In October, the young Danish woman who had accompanied them from Europe left the act and the ‚Äú5 Balasis‚Äù became the ‚ÄúBalasi Troupe\\". After more than thirty years in the business, Victor Sr. and Paula decided to retire in early 1925 and remain in America. Having lived in hotels for the 2 previous years, they selected Chicago as their new home. The act was reorganized as the \\"Balasi Trio\\", starring Alfred, his wife Maria and Victor Jr., and they concentrated on acrobatics with new costumes sporting an American collegiate theme. They debuted their new act in June 1925 on the open air stage of the Palisades Amusement Park in New Jersey. The balasi Trio went on to perform on several vaudeville circuits through early 1927, including the B.F. Keith, Loew's, Pantages and Gus Sun circuits. Again reviews were good with praise for the head-to-head and hand-to-head vaults. The act appeared several times in articles in Billboard, Variety, Vaudeville News and Zit's, among other theatrical trade publications. An article in the July 30, 1926, issue of Vaudeville News recounted how the Balasi Trio employed a movie camera to record their act to help improve their performance. During 1927, the trio changed their act, with more of their performance devoted to dancing by Maria, but gymnastics by Alfred and Victor were still a major part of the act. Maria, who had used the name Micareme during her solo dance career in Europe, created the stage name of \\"Florence Micareme and Company\\" with a Renaissance theme. They toured on the B.F. Keith, Pantages and Proctor circuits through 1929. For 2 years from August 1927 to August 1929, they performed 2 shows a day, traveling by train with all their gymnastic equipment, to over one hundred vaudeville theaters from the east coast to the west coast, frequently playing alongside the stars of the vaudeville stage. Reviews were again good for the men's head-to-head acrobatics and the overall act was usually well received. The Balasis had their last performance at the New Palace Theater (now the Cadillac Palace Theatre) on September 16, 1929, in Chicago, where they had started their North American vaudeville tour in 1923. Vaudeville was on the decline, being supplanted by the budding movie business. After their final performance, the Florence Micareme and Company act was dissolved, and Alfred and Maria retired in Chicago in 1930. Victor Jr. left the act to start up his own act with his wife as \\"Balasi and Skaren\\". Victor Jr. retired a decade later in New York City as vaudeville began to die out.

Artefacts and carvings inside the church are believed to have given rise to many of the characters created by Lewis Carroll, who as a child, attended St Peter's in the 1840s when his father was rector of the church. The church also features in Simon Jenkins' book \\"England's Thousand Best Churches\\". History The church was first started in the 12th century and was added to in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries with major renovations in the late 19th century. The bulk of the church is in the Decorated style with a later addition tower on the west side which is constructed of different stone to the rest of the church; the exteriors walls of the church are constructed from red sandstone which is found in the Tees Valley, though it has been re-inforced with brown sandstone. The nave and chancel together, measure from west to east. Whilst most of the architectural style of the building is described as Decorated, the clerestory, which was added in the 15th century, is noted for being in the Perpendicular style. Anglo-Saxon crosses are to be found in the chapel and the north door area. The site has been identified as being a location of Anglo- Saxon worship. In 1680, the Milbanke family installed an elevated pew in the church (the Milbanke Pew) which is on the same level as the pulpit. It is reached via a \\"grand staircase\\" and is supported by Tuscan columns with fitted with red curtains. Glynne describes the whole section of the pew and stairs leading up to it as being \\"ugly\\". The church was grade I listed in 1968 and includes the Todd Tomb in the churchyard, which commemorates John Todd of nearby Halnaby Hall, which is grade II listed. Simon Jenkins in his book, England's Thousand Best Churches, awards the church three stars out of five and describes it as being Lewis Carroll Between 1843 and 1868, Lewis Carroll's father was the rector at the church in Croft. The family arrived in the village when Carroll was just 11-years' old, and he stayed until he was 19 before he left for Oxford. Many items inside the church have been cited as inspiration for a varying number of characters from Carroll's work; the grinning cat on the sedilla is believed to have inspired the Cheshire Cat and the sword which John Conyers is supposed to have killed the Sockburn Worm with used to be in the church and is presented on the occasion of a new incumbent of the Bishop of Durham. In 2018, the sedilla was renovated as part of an ¬£160,000 extension of the church. At the same time, a carved stone Jabberwock, which was detailed as per an original drawing of the dragon in the 1871 version of \\"Alice Through the Looking Glass\\", was added to the building. The renovation, which includes Heritage Lottery Funding (HLF), will have a new visitors section with material created by pupils from Richmond School. Due to its connection with Lewis Carroll and Alice in Wonderland, the church attracts many visitors from overseas, notably Brazil, China and the United States.

Afghanistan Army Called a Haphazard Operation\\", 19 September 2001 In 1995, during the 1995 Airstan incident, a Taliban fighter plane captured a Russian transport. They also held six Mil Mi-8 helicopters, five Mi-35s, five L-39Cs, six An-12s, 25 An-26s, a dozen An-24 and An-32s, an IL-18, and a Yakovlev.Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment, 2001 Their civil air service contained two Boeing 727A/Bs, a Tu-154, five An-24s, and a DHC-6. The Afghan Air Force under the Taliban did not see action in the Afghan Civil War and almost all aircraft were destroyed by the US in the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent). Most of the MiG-21 fleet met their end in an Afghan junkyard. The roundel of most of the aircraft was a washed over DRAAF Roundel with the green paint of the Taliban.Little is known about the Taliban regime's air force establishment. On 3 August 1995 a Taliban Air Force MiG-21 aircraft forced the Russian aircraft to land at Kandahar. Negotiations between the Russian government and the Taliban to free the men stalled for over a year and efforts by American senator Hank Brown to mediate between the two parties broke down over a prisoner exchange. The Taliban stated that they would free the airmen if the Russians released Afghans held by the Russian government. However the Russians denied holding any Afghan citizens. Brown was able to get the Taliban to agree that the Russian crew should be allowed to maintain their aircraft. This request paved the way for their escape.The abandoned wreckage of a Taliban MiG-21  Taliban Civil Aviation Service  After the end of the Soviet war in 1989 and collapse of Najibullah's government, the Taliban took over Kabul in 1996. Afghanistan faced substantial economic sanctions from the international sector during the Taliban regime. The sanctions, along with the Taliban government's control of Ariana Afghan Airlines and the grounding of many of the carrier's international flights, had a devastating effect on the economic health of the company through the 1990s. The fleet was reduced to only a handful of Russian and Ukrainian built An-26s, Yakovlev Yak-40s and three Boeing 727s, which were used on the longest domestic routes and military transport roles. In October 1996, Pakistan provided a temporary maintenance and operational base at Karachi. With no overseas assets, by 1999 Ariana's international operations consisted of flights to Dubai only; also, limited cargo flights continued into China's western provinces. However, sanctions imposed by UN Security Council Resolution 1267 forced the airline to suspend overseas operations. In , Ariana was grounded completely. According to the Los Angeles Times: According to people interviewed by the Los Angeles Times, Viktor Bout's companies helped in running the airline.  Conscription  According to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service.  Kidnapping foreigners  Prior to the collapse of their regime the Taliban made widespread use of conscription, and according to some of the Guantanamo captives, kidnapping and virtual slavery.  Conscription of children  According to a report from Oxford University the Taliban made widespread use of the conscription of children in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The report states that during the civil war that preceded the Taliban regime, thousands of orphaned boys joined various militia for \\"employment, food, shelter, protection and economic opportunity.\\" The report said that during its initial period the Taliban \\"long depended upon cohorts of youth\\". Witnesses stated that each land-owning family had to provide one young man and $500 in expenses. In August of that year 5000 students aged between 15 and 35 left madrassas in Pakistan to join the Taliban.

Biography Royas was born in Toledo, Spain in 1512. Upon the death of Domenico Cubelles in 1566, Philip II of Spain wanted to appoint Royas as Bishop of Malta, however Pope Pius V refused to accept the appointment. Consequently, the see was not filled until the death of Pius V when Royas was appointed as Bishop of Malta by Pope Gregory XIII on 5 November 1572. He was ordained in Rome a few days later on 9 November. Royas was also the second Inquisitor of Malta. During his episcopacy, Royas was renowned for accusing Grand Master Jean de la Cassi√®re of the Order of St John on numerous occasions to the Holy See. He also accused a number of members of the order of becoming Lutherans. Such clashes were due to his post as Inquisitor of Malta. The order was not content with having one person holding the offices of bishop and inquisitor of Malta simultaneously, and la Cassi√®re convinced the Pope to appoint a separate inquisitor for Malta. In 1574, Pietro Dusina was appointed inquisitor instead of Royas. In 1576, Royas left for Rome where he died on 19 March 1577.\\"Bishop Mart√≠n Rojas de Portalrubio, O.S.Io.Hieros.\\", Catholic Hierarchy. Retrieved on 05 July 2018.

The project \\"aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy\\" by developing a platform for linked- data applications that are completely decentralized and fully under users' control rather than controlled by other entities. The ultimate goal of Solid is to allow users to have full control of their own data, including access control and storage location. To that end, Tim Berners-Lee formed a company called Inrupt to help build a commercial ecosystem to fuel Solid. History Two decades after Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989, he outlined the design issues of what later became the Solid project in drafts he wrote for the World Wide Web Consortium. Berners-Lee became increasingly dismayed at seeing his invention being abused, such as when Russian hackers interfered with the 2016 US elections, when the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal became public, when Facebook in 2012 conducted psychological experiments on nearly 700,000 users in secret, and when Google and Amazon applied for patents on devices that listen for emotional changes in human voices. Berners-Lee felt that the Internet was in need of repair and conceived the Solid project as a first step to fix it, as a way to give individual users full control over the usage of their data. The Solid project is available to anyone to join and contribute, although Berners-Lee advises that people without coding skills should instead advocate publicly for changing the Internet. In 2015, MIT received a gift from Mastercard to support the development of Solid. Berners- Lee's research team collaborated with the Qatar Computing Research Institute and Oxford University on Solid. In 2018, Berners-Lee took a sabbatical from MIT to launch a commercial venture based on Solid, named Inrupt. Website. The company's mission is \\"to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.\\" Design There are a number of technical challenges to be surmounted to accomplish decentralizing the web, according to Berners-Lee's vision. Rather than using a centralized spoke‚Äìhub distribution paradigm, decentralized peer-to-peer networking is implemented in a manner that adds more control and performance features than traditional peer-to-peer networks such as BitTorrent. Other goals are for the system to be easy to use, fast, and allow for simple creation of applications by developers. Solid's central focus is to enable the discovery and sharing of information in a way that preserves privacy. A user stores personal data in \\"pods\\" (personal online data stores) hosted wherever the user desires. Applications that are authenticated by Solid are allowed to request data if the user has given the application permission. A user may distribute personal information among several pods; for example, different pods might contain personal profile data, contact information, financial information, health, travel plans, or other information. The user could then join an authenticated social-networking application by giving it permission to access the appropriate information in a specific pod. The user retains complete ownership and control of data in the user's pods: what data each pod contains, where each pod is stored, and which applications have permission to use the data. In more detail, Solid consists of the following components: * An organized collection of standards and data formats/vocabularies providing the same capabilities that centralized social media services offer, such as identity, authentication, login, permission lists, contact management, messaging, feed subscriptions, comments, discussions, and others. * Specifications and design notes describing a REST API to extend existing standards, to guide developers building servers or applications. * Servers that implement the Solid specification. * A test suite for testing and validating Solid implementations. * An ecosystem of social applications, identity providers, and helper libraries that run on the Solid platform. * A community providing documentation, discussion, tutorials, and presentations.

This time he used an Indiegogo campaign. In an interview with IndieWire, Cox stated, \\"I was thinking it would be a conventional western, but Rudy (Wurlitzer) wants to give it a science fiction angle ‚Äî from the perspective of time-traveling women historians from the future. They‚Äôll time-travel back in time to film at the OK Corral, but they get the day wrong and they miss it by a day, so they have to interview the survivors.\\" Wurlitzer was involved in early stages, but not credited as a writer on the final film, the screenplay is solely credited to Cox. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Cox stated that he had originally planned to film in Boulder, Colorado but then decided to shoot in Tucson instead. Filming took place at the Old Tucson Studios west of Tucson near the actual O.K. Corral. In an interview with Tucson Weekly, Cox stated that the producers of Snowden matched the funds already accumulated, helping Cox to complete the film. Release The film screened as a work in progress at the Ashland Independent Film Festival at 6:40 p.m. on Saturday, April 8, 2017, at the Cinedelphia Film Festival at 7:00 p.m. on April 15, 2017, and at the Loft Film Fest on May 27, 2017.

The female has an average length of about , and the male has a value of about . Description The female is about in length, and typically ranges from in length. The male has an average length of about , and ranges in length from about . The male has enlarged aesthetes (found on the antennules), which are likely used for chemoreception. Distribution This copepod is found in the Pacific, from Alaska to Central America in coastal North America, and from Russia to southeast Asia in Asia. Ecology Life cycle and reproduction When the male senses a potential mate (likely through pheromones), it swims irregularly, alternating zig-zags with looping and figure eights. This is likely to find the potential mate or as a precopulatory behaviour. C. pacificus This copepod typically lays a clutch of 24 to 54 eggs. The egg production rate increases with an increase in food, indicating that C. pacificus is an income breeder, relying on food stores gained concurrently with reproduction to breed. In addition, it has three generations per year, with generations being about 10 to 25 days. This copepod does not migrate until it is a nauplius stage III, when it moves closer to the surface. This behaviour continues until it is a nauplius stage V. Then, until maturity, the depth during the day gets progressively deeper. The depth of migration is influenced by predation; when there are more predators, the intensity of diel vertical migration increases. Feeding C. pacificus is a particle feeder, feeding on plankton, copepod nauplii, and marine snow. It generally feeds on the food of greatest abundance and size. However, it also rejects low quality food, likely through chemical means, in addition to rejecting inert particles. Examples of low quality food include Ptychodiscus brevis, which produces neurotoxins, and Protoceratium reticulatum, which causes regurgitation or an elevated heart rate. Additionally, the presence of the latter decreases the intake of a preferred food, Gyrodiniurn resplendens. This allows P. reticulatum to decrease the concentration of C. pacificus when the former is in bloom. C. pacificus can take advantage of marine snow as food, with aggregations of various compositions being responsible for between about dry weight of fecal pellets copepod‚àí1 hr‚àí1 (per copepod per hour), at a maximum feeding rate. Assuming a 70% assimilation efficiency, this species can ingest from marine snow copepod‚àí1 hr‚àí1. Another important food source, diatoms, are able to be ingested at a rate of about copepod‚àí1 hr‚àí1.

Harris (1761 ‚Äì May 5, 1814) was a Georgian soldier and politician.  Participation in the American Revolutionary War  During the American Revolutionary War Harris, a teenager with the rank of private, served with Georgia Governor John Clark. He fought in the impressive American victory during the Siege of Augusta. Elrod, Frary. \\"Historical Notes on Jackson County, Georgia.\\" Frary Elrod, 1967.  Land Holdings in Georgia  Harris owned a sizeable amount of land within four counties in Georgia. Wilkes County: 1060 acres; Washington County: 1132.5 acres; Franklin County: 350 acres and Jackson County: 645.5 acres. He was engaged in the lumbering business in the St. Marys River (Florida-Georgia) area. \\"Georgia Archives, University System of Georgia.\\" http://vault.georgiaarchives.org/cdm/search/searchterm/buckner%20harris/order/title  Georgia / Florida Border Disputes  Harris was known to cross the international border from the U.S. state of Georgia into Spanish East Florida and illegally cut and harvest yellow pine and live oak timber. These actions infuriated the Spanish government, East Florida settlers and land owners which increased the tensions along the Georgia/Florida border and with the relationship between the two nations. These border tensions were one of the factors that led to the Patriot War.Cusick, James G. \\"The Other War of 1812: The Patriot War and the American Invasion of Spanish East Florida.\\" Athens, GA: The University of Georgia Press, 2003.  Participation in the Patriot War  Harris served in the Patriot War with the Georgia militia and held the rank of General. Early in the war he was an officer who had the respect of his troops and later emerged as the leader of the marauding 'Patriot' movement after the United States withdrew their troops from Spanish East Florida. Harris was appointed the office of director of the Republic of Florida and diligently worked to topple the Spanish government in East Florida. He led a force of 70 'Patriot' troops into the Indian country of the Alachua territory in East Florida, where the Seminoles were forced to abandon their towns earlier in the war, and ordered the construction of a 25 square foot blockhouse that he named Fort Mitchell. He then attempted to obtain U.S. government approval to annex the land from the Spanish government, but on April 19, 1814, Secretary of State James Monroe responded and made it clear that the 'Patriot' government was not going to be recognized or supported. In the meantime, East Florida Governor Sebasti√°n Kindel√°n y O'Regan offered the Seminoles a bounty to kill the 'Patriots' that were occupying Spanish territory and General Buckner Harris was at the top of the list. Patrick, Rembert W. \\"Florida Fiasco: Rampant Rebels on the Georgia-Florida Border, 1810‚Äì1815.‚Äù Athens, GA: The University of Georgia Press, 1954.Cusick, James G. \\"The Other War of 1812: The Patriot War and the American Invasion of Spanish East Florida.\\" Athens, GA: The University of Georgia Press, 2003.  Death  On May 5, 1814, a Seminole war party ambushed Harris while he was exploring the Alachua area and abruptly killed and scalped him. Governor Sebasti√°n Kindel√°n y O'Regan paid the Seminoles a reward after they turned in Harris's scalp along with some confiscated maps and surveys. The death of Harris, the 'Patriot' movement's charismatic leader, coupled with no support from the U.S. government marked the beginning of the end of the Republic of Florida and the Patriot War.

Canada  Quebec and Ontario From 1 to 6 July 2018, the air temperature consistently rose above in parts of Quebec and Ontario. The humidex value for Ottawa on Canada Day between noon and 3 pm was 47, the highest ever recorded in the city. The humidex also peaked at 46 in Toronto and 45 in Montreal. The heat wave also affected the Maritimes, with the humidex value reaching 35 in Halifax and 45 at Greenwood in the Annapolis Valley, on 5 July. On 4 July, Montreal emergency services reported twelve hundred calls per day about the heat, up 30% from prior busiest days. As of 10 July, seventy-four people, most of them already ill, had died heat-related deaths in Quebec. This province's death toll is reported as much higher than others' because of its looser rules for attributing death to heat. In Ontario, where only accidental deaths directly caused by heat are counted, the coroner's office is investigating three possible cases. Maritime provinces While the heat wave ended on 10 July in Central Canada, this was not so for the Maritimes. On the 23rd of July, the interaction between a far- northwest Azores-Bermuda High and a trough over Ontario led to the issuing of heat warnings for all three Maritime Provinces, with several locations reporting humidex values in excess of 36. In Halifax, the heat wave contributed to a record-breaking number of hot days in July, with the airport reporting daily high temperatures in excess of 25 degrees Celsius on twenty- two days that month, breaking the previous record of twenty-one days set in 2008, 2003, and 1924.

Developing into the eighth named tropical storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season and passing the Mariana Islands on July 4, Maria strengthened into the fourth typhoon of the season and underwent rapid intensification the next day amid favorable environmental conditions. The typhoon reached its first peak intensity on July 6; subsequently, Maria weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, but it reintensified and reached a second, stronger peak intensity on July 9 with 10-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg). Over the next three days, it started to gradually weaken due to another eyewall replacement cycle and decreasing sea surface temperatures. After crossing the Yaeyama Islands and passing north of Taiwan on July 10, Maria ultimately made landfall over Fujian, China, early on July 11, before dissipating the next day. Early in its lifetime, Maria brought winds of tropical storm force to Guam, damaging aircraft at Anderson Air Force Base and knocking out power across the island. Damage in Guam was valued at US$150,000. On July 10, Maria brought strong winds to Okinawa Prefecture, inflicting significant crop damage. Losses in the prefecture reached JP¬•853.7 million (US$7.69 million). Simultaneously, Maria produced heavy rains and strong winds across Taiwan, killing one and injuring eight. Power to nearly 60,000 households was cut and agricultural damage was around NT$1.3 million (US$43,000). From landfall to dissipation, Maria impacted the Chinese provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan with flooding rain and gusty winds. At least 510,000 people in coastal regions evacuated and one person was killed in Jiangxi. Around 9,300 houses and over of cropland were damaged. Schools and workplaces were closed in parts of Fujian and more than 200 flights were cancelled. Train and ferry services were also disrupted. Power outages were widespread in Fujian, where more than 320,000 customers lost power. Economic losses across China were about CN¬•4.16 billion (US$620 million). Meteorological history On July 3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared that a tropical depression had formed at 00:00 UTC about 500 km (310 mi) southeast of Guam. The broad system tracked northwest around a region of high atmospheric pressure to its north as it began to consolidate, with the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) determining that the system had become a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC. Amid rather favorable environmental conditions encompassing high sea surface temperatures of , low-to-moderate wind shear, and wind patterns in the upper troposphere aiding the development of thunderstorm activity, the system intensified modestly, with the JTWC assessing that it became a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on July 4. Twelve hours later, the JMA stated that the depression had become a tropical storm and named the system Maria. On July 5, Maria began to rapidly intensify as it developed an eye feature. The satellite presentation of the cyclone improved drastically over the next 24 hours, with the eye contracting to a diameter of 20 km (13 mi). The JTWC assessed that Maria became a super typhoon at 00:00 UTC on July 6, possessing maximum sustained winds of 250 km/h (155 mph). Immediately after, Maria began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle, with microwave satellite imagery revealing that a new eyewall had developed and encircled the original eyewall. The JMA, however, assessed that Maria continued to strengthen to reach an initial peak intensity at 12:00 UTC with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a central pressure of 925 hPa (mbar; 27.32 inHg). Typhoon Maria approaching Eastern China on July 10 Some weakening took place on July 7 as Maria went through the eyewall replacement cycle, with the JTWC assessing that Maria had dropped below super typhoon strength. A developing high-pressure area to Maria's northwest caused the system's forward motion to decrease while the inner eyewall dissipated and the outer eyewall began to contract. However, Maria did not immediately restrengthen as upper- level wind patterns temporarily became unfavorable. More substantial reintensification occurred on July 8 as Maria began to accelerate northwest once again and the system regained super typhoon strength at 00:00 UTC. The JTWC judged Maria to have reached its peak intensity at 12:00 UTC on July 8 with winds of 270 km/h (165 mph), equivalent to Category 5 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. Displaying a well-defined eye 37 km (23 mi) wide, the system maintained an impressive satellite presentation into July 9, when the JMA estimated Maria reached peak intensity with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg). Late on July 9, Maria developed concentric eyewalls once again, indicating another eyewall replacement cycle was underway. Combined with decreasing upper oceanic heat content along the cyclone's path, Maria began to weaken steadily as it turned to the west-northwest. At 21:00 UTC on July 9, Maria entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and received the local name Gardo. As the system passed north of Taiwan on July 10, frictional effects with the island's mountains as well as increasing northerly wind shear further weakened the cyclone. At 01:10 UTC on July 11, Maria made landfall over the of Lianjiang County, Fuzhou in Fujian, China. At the time, the system possessed 10-minute sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph) and 1-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). Rapid weakening took place once Maria moved inland, with the storm degrading to a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC. The remnant system continued inland and dissipated over Hubei before 00:00 UTC on July 13. Preparations and impact Guam Maria damaged a number of KC-135 aircraft in Andersen Air Force Base when passing near Guam as a tropical storm on July 5. Several flights to and from the island were cancelled. An islandwide power outage occurred on July 5 after gusty winds downed power lines, and the local weather radar was knocked out. Damage on the island was estimated at US$150,000. Ryukyu Islands As a weakening typhoon, Maria made a direct hit on Miyakojima, Okinawa Prefecture, on July 10. On that day, schools in Miyakojima were closed, while flights to and from Miyako Airport and New Ishigaki Airport were cancelled. Ferry services connecting Miyakojima and Ishigaki Island with the surrounding islands were suspended for ten days. The sugarcane crop suffered severe wind damage, with some fields in Miyakojima reporting that up to 70 percent of their crops had been damaged. Total damage in Okinawa Prefecture was about JP¬•853.7 million (US$7.69 million), of which nine-tenths came from the sugarcane crop. Other crops affected included pineapple, mango, millet, and okra. Damage to infrastructure was limited, reaching JP¬•6.75 million (US$60,800) in Kumejima. Taiwan As Maria passed north of Taiwan, heavy rain and gusty winds impacted the island. Workplaces and schools were closed on July 10 and resumed operations on July 11\\\\. Services along the Taiwan High Speed Rail were interrupted by the adverse weather conditions. The Forestry Bureau closed 14 national forest recreational areas from July 10 to 12. A man in New Taipei City sustained fatal head injuries after losing his balance when inspecting his house. Seven men and a woman were injured in northern Taiwan by falling branches. Strong winds caused 59,485 households to lose power, though the situation was mostly resolved by July 11\\\\. Agricultural damage in Taiwan was valued at NT$1.3 million (US$43,000). The typhoon also eroded away part of Huaping Islet, causing its shape to now resemble a two-humped camel instead of a one-humped camel. East China Min River in Fuzhou on July 11 Ahead of Typhoon Maria, authorities initiated evacuations in coastal parts of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. By July 11, at least 226,600 people were evacuated in Fujian, while in Zhejiang, about 390,000 people were moved to safety, including 270,000 people from Wenzhou. In both provinces, fishing boats were ordered to return to port; the Port of Xiamen received 851 vessels, while 25,000 boats sought shelter in Zhejiang. Offshore fish farms in Fujian were closed and over 27,600 workers returned to shore. Ferry services between Xiamen and Kinmen were suspended. At least 200 train services in and out of Fujian were halted, while 206 flights to and from Zhejiang were cancelled. Across Fujian, 7,865 schools were closed and works at 4,439 construction sites were stopped. In Fuzhou, the provincial capital of Fujian, all schools and factories were closed on July 11. In Jiangxi province, authorities evacuated over 1,100 people, closed 21 tourist attractions, and suspended passenger transport services to Fujian and Zhejiang. Fallen trees at Fuzhou University Upon landfall in Lianjiang County on July 11, Typhoon Maria became the strongest July typhoon to make landfall in Fujian. Maria brought heavy rains and gusty winds to Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan, affecting 1.424 million people and causing direct economic losses of CN¬•4.16 billion (US$620 million). A peak rainfall total of 313 mm (12.3 in) was recorded at Lishui, Zhejiang, while a peak gust of was observed at Sansha in Xiapu County, Fujian. Storm surge from Maria combined with the astronomical high tide to create tides exceeding warning levels by up to 0.93 m (3.1 ft). A tide gauge at Shacheng in Fuding, Fujian observed a record high tide of 4.4 m (14.4 ft) above mean sea level. Across Fujian and Zhejiang, about of cropland suffered damage, of which was completely destroyed. About 800 people in Zhejiang were rescued by emergency services, and 200 houses were damaged to varying degrees. In Fujian, 8,800 houses were damaged and another 300 were destroyed. Widespread power outages occurred in Fujian: over 86,000 customers in Lianjiang County and another 240,000 customers in Fuzhou lost power. Knee-deep flooding occurred in some residential areas in Fuzhou, where the police deployed 1,623 personnel to assist in flood control efforts. Fujian's water infrastructure suffered CN¬•76 million (US$11.4 million) worth of damage. Communications in Fujian were severely disrupted, with 2,901 base stations taken offline and 315 km (196 mi) of networking cables damaged according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

It was designed by Oswald Lewis and built from 1874 to 1876 by Laing and Wylie under supervising architect G. H. Cox. It was later used as the Pink Elephant Markets and as the Newcastle Museum before being redeveloped as the Quest Newcastle West serviced apartments. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  1856 - Arrival in Newcastle of the Wood Family. Family members were John Senior and Ann and sons, John Junior, Joseph and Edward. 1856-1857 - Edward Fitzgerald established a Brewery at Castlemaine in Victoria. 1857 - John Wood Junior was a miner with the A.A. Company in the D pit. 1859 - John Wood Junior became publican of the Ship Inn Hotel. 1865 - Wood Brothers and Co. opened a Spirit and Bond Store in part of the spacious premises known as Bingle and Co.'s stores in Bolton Street, Newcastle 1868 - Wood Bros. accepted from Mr. Fitzgerald the agency for the sale of Castlemaine Ale in Newcastle. 1874 - Fire destroyed the building in which the Wood Brothers' store was located. 1874 - Tenders were called for the construction of a new brewery to the designs of Mr. Oswald Lewis, Architect. Tender by Messrs. Laing and Wylie accepted. 1876 - The new brewery was opened and commenced operations. Water supply was obtained from a well on the site. The ale produced was of the highest quality produced by the most up-to-date methods. 1878 - Major extensions were made such that the Brewery was said to be amongst the finest in Australia. The expansion was largely to cater for the greatly increased beer trade and the new complex is described as being 'replete with every convenience.' 1883 - The company name was changed from the Castlemaine Brewery and Malting Company Limited to the Castlemaine Brewery Maltings and Wine and Spirit Company Limited. This was changed again a few years later to the Australian Brewer and Wine and Spirit Limited. 1887 - A limited company was formed named The Castlemaine Brewery and Wood Bros. and Company, Newcastle, New South Wales Limited which acquired the brewery business carried on in Newcastle and elsewhere under the name of Prendegast Wood and Co., and the wine and spirit business carried on at Newcastle, West Maitland and elsewhere under the name of Wood Bros and Co., together with the freehold land and brewery in Charlton Street (now Hunter Street) and the freehold land and store in Bolton Street, Newcastle. The Victorians retained 35% of the shares in the new company. The first directors of the company were Joseph Wood, three Victorians, Edward Fitzgerald, Nicholas Fitzgerald and Malcolm Donald McEecharn and James Burns from Sydney. 1888 - The building of the Great Northern Brewery Wine and Spirit Co. Ltd. on the south-western corner of Wood and Parry Streets was constructed to the designs of Messrs. Bennett and Yeomans, Architects. The Castlemaine Brewery purchased the Great Northern Brewery in 1891 to prevent local competition, although there were other breweries operating in the Newcastle and Maitland areas. There is little to indicate that Castlemaine used the Great Northern premises until 1897. 1889 - Profit and turnover performance by the Brewery in 1888-1890 was considered to be most satisfactory with dividend return to shareholders of 12 percent. 1893 - The Depression and strikes of the 1890s had a serious effect on the brewery business and the dividend payment was reduced to 7 percent. 1895 - The Depression deepened and was made worse by a drought which affected the previously strong country sales. Dividends, however, were held at 7 percent. 1897 - The dividend was reduced again to a level of 5 percent and the Chairman during his annual report spoke of the evils which had overtaken the Company, but which were now past. Major modernisation of the equipment had been undertaken in the previous year and the Brewery was now producing among the best beer in the Colony. Other improvements at the plant included asphalting the enclosure, repainting throughout, weather sheds to protect casks from sun damage, new cellars and vats. The \\"evil\\" which had overtaken the Company was a cessation of production for four months due to a bacterial growth in the brewery. During the complete renovations undertaken to counter this problem, brewing was transferred to the buildings purchased earlier from the Great Northern Brewery. Once the renovations were again completed brewing returned to Castlemaine and the Great Northern was used for only secondary purposes such as laboratories. Partly as a result of the loss of trade during this period and due to increasing competition from Sydney, the dividend never rose above 4 percent during the remainder of the 1890s. 1898 - The renovations were completed at a total cost of 10,000 pounds and the Brewery was noted as being equipped with all the most modern appliances and capable of producing up to 800 to 900 hogsheads per week and up to 100 dozen bottled beer per day. 1899 - At the Annual General meeting the Directors complained that Tooth and Co. and Toohey from Sydney had plenty of money and were using it freely to secure business. This period saw a considerable effort to maintain the Brewery's position in the market. left 1911 - The chairman, Mr. H.H. Long, noted that performance had been satisfactory given the adverse circumstances under which the Brewery had been working during the previous twelve months. Extensive alterations had been made which involved the installation of practically a new plant and a new system of brewing which necessitated important structural alterations and a great increase in engine, boiler and refrigeration plant. Under the guidance of Mr. Pfrander, the head brewer, both the quality and quantity of the beer being produced had increased. The alterations had been carried out while brewing continued which resulted in a staged alteration process. They had been undertaken under the superintendence of E.G. Castleden, architect, with the overall advice of Auguste de Bavay of Melbourne. 1912 - This year marked the twenty-fifth annual meeting of the Castlemaine Brewery and Wood Bros. and Company Newcastle NSW Limited. It was noted that the alterations of the previous year had been very successful with the Company's beer now considered the most superior on the market. Partly, as a result, beer output had increased by 40 percent and the spirit department had also expanded dramatically. Further improvements costing almost 20,000 pounds had been made which included about 6,000 pounds expended in the building and equipping of a new bottling department, rendered necessary by the increased demand for the company's product. This reference is to the building facing Hunter Street designed by Castleden to house offices in the single-storey section and the bottling department in the two-storey portion to the rear. 1913 - The Brewery's business continued to expand in both the beer and spirit departments as the new machinery continued in efficient production. Dividends at the rate of 5 percent were announced. The Company had purchased the freehold on the Royal Exchange Hotel in Newcastle and arranged a long lease on the new Railway Hotel in Cessnock in an effort to popularise the Company's products. The new bottling plant had reached completion and other alterations were nearing completion. If the prospects for turnover were maintained at their anticipated levels, further additions were foreseen. 1921 - Tooth and Co. Limited entered into an agreement with the Castlemaine Brewery and Wood Bros. and Company Newcastle NSW Limited and subsequently acquired the company's brewing, wine and spirit business and properties. Prior to this Tooths had a small depot in Telford Street which was closed in late 1921. Brewing continued on the site until mid-1931 when operations closed as a result of the Depression. Competition from other Sydney and Melbourne brewers and an apparent partiality for these \\"foreign\\" brews by the local people were given as reasons for the closure. The closure was not taken lightly by Newcastle as it had just lost its soap factory and biscuit works and the employment situation was not bright. More than 50 men were stood down and brewing ceased in Newcastle for nearly 40 years until Tooheys opened their Cardiff work. 1938 - As business improved after the Depression, tooth and Co. decided to use the former brewery as a Depot for the distribution of their products manufactured in Sydney. In order t conduct this change of use, major alterations and additions were carried out to the designs of Pitt and Merewether, Architects. Basically, the alterations involved the removal of all the brewing equipment, demolition of the power generating plant and erection of garages and buildings for the handling of packaged beer. This operation continued successfully with various additional buildings and alterations being required in the 1960s, until 1974. 1974 - Tooth and Co. ceased operations on the site and transferred to a new depot in Nelson Road, Cardiff. The site was sold and became the Pink Elephant Markets. 1988 - Newcastle Museum opens in the former brewery after restoring the building. 2008 - Newcastle Museum closes at the brewery and moves to the former Honeysuckle Railway Workshops. 2014 - Development application approved for 47 units and associated car parking in the former brewery. 2017 - The Quest Newcastle West serviced apartments open in the former Castlemaine Brewery.  Description  ;Original Brewery Building Originally a four-storey tower, with symmetrical two-storey wings running to the east and west. The tower was roofed with galvanised iron with a central ventilating lantern running north-south with four accompanying ventilation dormers. Each floor had two windows on the northern face, with two on the east and west faces on the fourth floor. A verandah ran across the front of the tower, part of which was enclosed to form an office in 1878. The wings to the east and west terminated in brick gables that projected above the roof line. In around 1880 the tower was enlarged and large openings created for vehicle access. Additional dormer windows and ventilation lantern was added. In 1911 the west wing was altered to allow the creation of a Gyle Room with three gyle tanks to be added to the first floor. In 1912 the east wing was altered internally by raising the ground floor to match the later additions and a parapet was added to the northern wall. Two more Gyle tanks in the western wing required supportive alterations. In c.1920 the dormers and ventilation lantern was removed from the roof of the tower. Pitt and Merewether, designed extensive internal modifications to convert the buildings into a storage distribution depot in 1938, including drastic alterations to the northern ground floor to allow for new awnings and a loading dock. ;Wood Street Brewery Building Loft A two-story building, with lofts, constructed in two stages between 1878‚Äì1885. The ground floor was concrete with a timber first floor, clad in brick with a galvanised iron roof. The Wood Street facade features two projecting gables and the roof profile creates an \\"M\\" shape, with central box gutter and fascia gutters. The 1878 section was built by George Yeomans as a malting room with overhead storage. In 1897 the ground floor was converted to refrigeration storage through the addition of cork insulation and loading access was created from the Hunter Street courtyard. Major internal alterations were undertaken in 1911, designed by E.G. Castleden, as a response to innovations in brewing technology. New skimming rooms were created on a raised floor in the centre of the 1878 building and an office and laboratory were created on the first floor. Prior to 1938 a cart dock was created on the eastern wall to load from the ground floor cellars. In 1938, when the new garage was built, the openings in the eastern wall were bricked up. A 1911 illustration by E.G. Castleden indicates a room was attached to the south-east corner, also a shed, a Boiler Room, Chimney Stack and Engine Room to the south. These were demolished in 1938, along with workshops, harness room, bottle washing shed and earth closets along what was the eastern boundary. ;Condenser Tower No documentary evidence exists regarding the construction of the Condenser Tower, which first appears on a Department of Lands Map in 1896, although it is believed to have been constructed in 1878. Castleden's drawing of 1911 describes the structure's purpose as bottle washing, however, it has a shape traditionally associated with malting houses. The brick tower is square and topped with a pyramidal timber roof and ventilation lantern. Between 1911 and 1938 Castleden converted the tower from a malting house into a condenser tower. The pyramidal roof was removed and the masonry extended to three storeys. A refrigeration plant was located on the ground floor, with brine tanks on the first and second floors, supported by concreted and steel-framed barrel-vaults. ;Bottle Store and Office A two-storey construction, originally housing bottling equipment, with a single story section on Hunter Street for the office and reception area. The single storey section has a triangular pediment over an entry portico, with rendered pilasters to add continuity to the Hunter Street facade. The two storey section echoes the office, with the addition of a curved gable and a bullseye window common to the Federation style of the early 20th century. The eastern facade was modified in around 1914, with the addition of a bottling house. The original roof of the loading gate was extended out to incorporate the new building. In 1938 Pitt and Merewether converted parts of the two storey section into additional offices, a canteen and toilets. ;Bottle House An addition to the Bottle Store in 1914, it is thought to have been designed by Castleden as the detailing matches the Bottle Store. In 1938 the hoist room, which had projected through the roof, was demolished. The southern parapet was lowered and finished with a triangulated brick gable. A substantial addition was constructed in 1960 with a plain brick face to Hunter Street and a saw-toothed roof. ;Bottled Beer Store No. 2 The Store was constructed before 1938 as a single storey addition from the south- east corner of the Bottle House. In the 1938 renovations the roof and southern parapet were lowered. ;Receiving Platform Constructed in 1938 on the southern wall of the Bottle House, covered with a steel-framed cantilevered roof, to give access to the rear of the bottle store. ;Vehicle Garage A single storey construction of steel-framing built between 1938 and 1939 as a lorry and car garage, with workshops and stores. Vehicle entry was via roller doors at the eastern end. Staff facilities were located on the southern side. ;Courtyard Enclosure and Awning In 1912 the former loading court was enclosed through the construction of brick walls. Originally sections were covered by verandahs, these were replaced in 1938‚Äì39 by a steel awning. ;Covered Cask Platform A free-standing raised platform with a galvanised iron roof supported by iron columns and trusses, built in 1938. ;Oil Store A small timber shed constructed in 1938 as an oil store and pump. In 1974 the shed was converted into a confectionery sales outlet. ;Return Beer House Removed from the main complex, a single storey brick building with a galvanised iron roof for draining returned beer kegs constructed in 1938. ;Platform A 25.6-metre (85-foot) platform was constructed on the southern boundary of the road in from Stewart Avenue.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Castlemaine Brewery is of State Significance as a Newcastle landmark. Additionally, the item is unusual in the architectural sensitivity used during subsequent stages of construction, resulting in a significant industrial streetscape. The original brewery was constructed in 1874, with substantial additions being constructed in 1878 and between 1911 and 1914. Castlemaine Brewery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Castlemaine brewery is historically significant as being indicative of the development of breweries in New South Wales. Its position is indicative of the prominence of the brewing in Australian industrial development, and how, prior to the expansion of the transport system in Australia, each town had an independent brewery that was eventually bought out by a major brewing company and closed down as part of the gradual centralisation. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Castlemaine Brewery is of State significance as a set of 19th century buildings on a scale, massing and with a continuity of design that has a significant visual and landscape quality, particularly when viewed from Hunter or Wood Streets. The Brewery is an excellent example of strong, but simplistic industrial architecture of the 19th century and has been a major visual element and landmark in Newcastle's skyline since its erection. The additions to the Brewery in 1910‚Äì1914 and again in 1912‚Äì1914 were undertaken in a sympathetic manner rarely seen in industrial buildings.

The story concerns a small group of children living in English town, sandwiched between a railway and a warehouse, in a row of rented, white- painted terraced houses, where the landlord will allow no pets.No One Must Know by Barbara Sleigh, illustrated by Jillian Willett (London: Collins, 1962), 192 pp. Story line The story begins with the arrival of new tenants at Number Six, an end-house in Cumberland Place, which is a poky town-centre street sandwiched between a railway and a warehouse. The incoming family consists of a little girl, Jenny Hawthorn, and her father (she has lost her mother in a car crash), and a cat named Thomas (p. 14).Page numbers refer to the first edition. The girl's face is described as \\"sprinkled with freckles ‚Äì as freely as an apple charlotte is with brown sugar.\\" The pet problem is one that she manages to share immediately with other children in the street: \\"'Is it true? ... No pets?'\\" Barty nodded. 'I say, whatever shall I do?'\\" (p. 11). The problem has been compounded overnight, when Thomas turns out to be a female cat and gives birth to four kittens. Jenny and two of her new neighbours, Barty Fergus and Molly Dudgeon, find a secret place for them on a piece of waste land, which they call Tom Tiddler's Ground. This is out of sight of the landlord, nicknamed Old Cockles after this surname Mussels: \\"I won't have it. Insanitary, do you hear?\\" (p. 13). Three other children from the Place ‚Äì Sam, Midge and Molly's younger brother Tony ‚Äì are brought into the secret. The story then delves into several further problems: a spy among the children (p. 67 ff.), train-spotters who frequent the path behind the houses (p. 79 ff.), a delinquent youth who uses the waste ground to store goods he has stolen (p. 110 ff.), and the prospect of the houses themselves being demolished.

After the first mining claims were staked in 1889, entrepreneurs began exploring the possibility of building a railroad to exploit the find. Construction began in April 1892 and the first train reached what became the town of Monte Cristo in August 1893. The mining boom ended in 1903. Poor ore quality and quantity played a role in the decline, but the failure of the railway to maintain service to Monte Cristo in the face of floods, landslides, winter snows, fires, and other disasters was also a factor in the collapse of the industry. Nonetheless, the railway hauled out approximately 300,000 tons of ore over the course of its operations. The railroad found a second set of customers among the timber companies. Logging in Puget Sound began along the shore, where water transport to sawmills was inexpensive. By the early 1900s, however, much of the lowland forest had been cut. The Everett and Monte Cristo tracks gave access to large areas of virgin forest, so the railroad was used to move raw logs down to existing mills. As the railway pushed further into the woods, new sawmills and roof shinglemills were established, and finished lumber and shingles were also shipped out by train. Tourism was a part of the business from the beginning of the railroad. The mountain scenery was then and still is an attraction. The first tourist excursion to Monte Cristo took place within days of completing the track. Weekend excursions with up to 500 passengers and a brass band took advantage of sunny summer days. A resort hotel, The Inn at Big Four, was opened in 1921 along the rail line for guests who wanted more than a day trip to the mountains. Choosing the route for the railroad proved a fateful decision. Trying to save money on initial construction, the owners chose the shortest route between the mines and the smelter. This ran the tracks through the steep-sided Robe Canyon, in some places mere feet above the flood-prone South Fork of the Stilliguamish River. This five-mile stretch was costly to maintain and suffered repeated outages. Service was interrupted for hours to years at a time, stranding people, freight, and rail cars. There was never enough money for maintenance. Over time, revenue fell as the mines played out, the easy timber was cut, and the road network extended competition further into the mountains. The railroad lost money, but the final blow was the Great Depression, which collapsed demand for the forest products hauled by the line. Scheduled rail service was abandoned in 1933 and the tracks torn up in 1936. Today, much of the Mountain Loop Highway from Verlot to Barlow Pass runs on the abandoned railroad grade.  Ownership history  Plan for the station at Monte Cristo dated 1892, likely one of Barlow's original drawings.  Rockefeller years (18921902)  Prospector Joseph Pearsall staked the first claim in what was to become Monte Cristo on July 4, 1889. Word of his find set off a minor gold rush and dozens of mining claims were filed in the area. None of them had any real prospect of exploitation because there was nothing but a crude trail into the mining district, insufficient for hauling in mining equipment, construction materials, food, and other supplies, and hauling out ore to a smelter. A consortium of Northwest mining interests led by Fred Wilmans and Judge Hiram Bond, bought out many of the claims and began to explore bringing in a railroad. The Wilmans-Bond group hired John Q. Barlow to survey possible routes. He discovered what came to be known as Barlow Pass which connected the Monte Cristo district to the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River. The pass offered the shortest route to the Puget Sound lowlands and was ultimately adopted as the route of the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway. At roughly the same, New York investment bankers Charles Colby and Colgate Hoyt, both of whom served on the Northern Pacific Railway's executive committee, were looking for ways to profit from their railroad's terminus on Puget Sound. They allied with Henry Hewitt to develop the town and port of Everett on Port Gardner Bay. The Colby-Hoyt investment syndicate was approached by the Wilmans-Bond mining group to build the railroad to Everett. An agreement was struck between the two groups committing the mines to produce a minimum amount of ore for 15 years and the railroad to ship it out at a fixed price. Fortuitously for the venture, Hoyt was friends with oil magnate John D. Rockefeller who provided the funding not only for the railroad, but also the Puget Sound Reduction Company's Everett smelter, the United Concentration Company's Monte Cristo ore concentrator, and a host of other investments in the area. As a result of the agreement between the two syndicates, The Everett and Monte Cristo Railway Company was incorporated on March 14, 1892. Construction began almost immediately. The Rockefeller-owned ore concentrator at Monte Cristo in 1894. The track in the foreground is the spur to the concentrator. Another railroad consortium, this time funded by local businessmen, founded the Snohomish, Skykomish, and Spokane Railway and Transportation Company on April 19, 1889. The \\"Three S\\", as it came to be known was intended to lure the western terminus of the Great Northern Railway to Everett by meeting the line as it emerged from the Cascade Mountains. The Three S obtained its right-of-way from Snohomish to Everett and began construction in 1891. The road laid at least 4.75 miles of track before running out of money in March 1892. The Colby-Hoyt group swooped in and bought the company for the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway Company for $400,000. The Panic of 1893 hurt businesses and railroads all over the country. Compounding the challenges for the Everett and Monte Cristo, in June 1893, the British House of Commons issued a recommendation that Her Majesty's Indian mints no longer produce silver rupees. World silver prices fell from 80 cents per ounce to 64 cents per ounce almost immediately, and never returned to the higher price during the time Rockefeller owned the railroad. This hurt the Monte Cristo investment. By 1894, Rockefeller had invested $1,797,000 in the railroad, and another $772,000 in mines, the concentrator, and smelter. To put this in context, America's richest man was worth $42 million at the time. All of these mining-related businesses were losing money. He dispatched Frederick T. Gates, a trusted advisor, to investigate and take action. This began a decade-long struggle to recoup the investment. The winter storms of 1897 that washed out the tracks ended rail service to the mining district for three years. The mines, the concentrator, and the smelter all shut down, causing further financial stress among the owners. Rockefeller, who had loaned money to several of the mines, foreclosed on their mortgages and took control of the failed companies in January 1899. This gave him complete control of all aspects of the Monte Cristo operations from mine to smelter. At least one newspaper opined that Rockefeller had purposefully decided not to repair the railroad so as to pressure the miners into this very outcome. After the floods of 1897, however, the railway had survey crews on the ground seeking a better route to Monte Cristo, suggesting that the Rockefeller team had legitimate questions about the wisdom of investing yet more money in treacherous Robe Canyon. As Rockefeller struggled recover his investment, the Northern Pacific Railway wanted its own track into Everett to compete more effectively with the Great Northern Railway. A deal was struck and the Northern Pacific bought the Western Division of the Everett and Monte Cristo, previously the Three S tracks, from Everett to where they connected to its existing tracks at Snohomish on February 4, 1900. The price was $750,000. As part of the deal. the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway maintained the right to run its trains over these tracks. After the sale, the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway Company was reorganized. New officers were elected and the company was renamed The Monte Cristo Railway Company on August 29, 1900. As the new century began, Gates and the Rockefeller interests had three related properties to dispose of. The first was the smelter in Everett, the second was the mines and concentrator in Monte Cristo, and the third was the railway that connected them. In March 1900, the railroad announced plans to rebuild all the way to Monte Cristo. No rationale was provided for the new investment, but it followed the collapse of a potential sale of the Rockefeller assets to German industrialists. Rockefeller may have concluded that it would not be possible the sell his Northwest businesses unless they were operating. No one would buy the railroad unless the mines were shipping ore, providing a revenue stream, and no one would buy the mines unless the railroad could haul ore to the smelter. In any case, the line was repaired as quickly as possible. He sold the renewed Monte Cristo Railway Company to the Northern Pacific Railway on September 16, 1902 for $512,412.89. He lost over $2 million on the sale, but achieved the long-term goal of exiting the money- losing investment. After the acquisition, the route became the Monte Cristo branch of the Northern Pacific Railway.  Northern Pacific years (19021915)  The Northern Pacific invested heavily in the line in 1903 to improve the tracks in order to serve Rockefeller's mines better. He had other plans. He sold the smelter, the mines, and the ore concentrator to Meyer Guggenheim's ASARCO trust in September 1903. ASARCO bought the package in part to reduce competition from the Everett plant with its smelter in Tacoma. It had little interest in the mines and closed them at the end of 1903, significantly impacting the revenue of the Monte Cristo line. With the drop in revenue, the Northern Pacific began to cut costs and defer maintenance on the line. The modern rotary snowplow that kept the line open in the winter was moved to other areas leading to long closures in the winter. The passenger cars went to the midwest for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. When the roof on the turntable at Monte Cristo collapsed under heavy snow in 1904 it was never rebuilt. Rock slides in Robe Canyon caused outages almost every winter, and with the reduced traffic, the Northern Pacific saw less reason to repair the damage. The Monte Cristo line had become a problem for the Northern Pacific, just as it had for Rockefeller.  Rucker years (19151929)  The Rucker brothers, Wyatt and Bethel, were involved in a range of Everett businesses at the turn of the century. Both were active in banking and logging. They owned thousands of acres of forest land, and two sawmills. They employed 400 people in logging and in lumber mills. They were dependent upon the Monte Cristo line for their timber business, and had negotiated a series of annual contracts with the Northern Pacific for its use. When it came time to renew the agreement for 1915, the railroad refused. Instead, it offered to lease the entire road to the Ruckers for ten years. In order to secure their transport, they formed the Hartford and Eastern Railway Company and took over responsibility from the Northern Pacific in 1915. At the end of their 10-year lease, the Northern Pacific had even less interest in the Monte Cristo line and refused to renew the arrangement. The Ruckers bought the line In 1925 in order to keep the Northern Pacific from closing it. The Hartford and Eastern, however, had as much trouble making money on the line as the Northern Pacific and Rockefeller before them. The railroad began losing money immediately after the purchase. In August 1929, the Ruckers sold the Hartford and Eastern to Puget Sound Pulp & Timber Company, along with the associated Inn at Big Four, their Lake Stevens sawmill, and 4,000 acres of timber land.  Logging Road (19291936)  Puget Sound Pulp and Timber was an integrated forest products company. It owned another short-line logging railroad, the Puget Sound Cascade Railway, near Clear Lake, Washington. It cut trees, hauled them on its railroad, and operated the pulp mill to turn its wood into paper. On the surface, the Hartford and Eastern, with the associated timber lands sold by the Ruckers, was a good fit for Puget Should Pulp and Paper. Its timing, however, was exquisitely bad. The Great Depression began two months after the railroad was purchased. Demand for its products collapsed and the company lost money in 1930 and 1931. It defaulted on its bond interest in 1932. An agreement with the bond syndicate cut the company in half. In exchange for their bonds, the creditors received the Hartford and Eastern and the rest of the former Rucker assets, a pulp mill in Everett, and a small amount of cash. The bondholders formed the Soundview Pulp Company to receive the assets and on July 19, 1932 the Hartford and Eastern was transferred to its new owner. As the depression deepened, Soundview Pulp worked hard to conserve what little cash it had. The railroad continued to lose money and there was a growing list of repairs to be made as snow, floods, and rockslides continued to cause problems for it. The company filed an application with the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon the line which was granted on April 22, 1933. By 1936 the rails were gone, too, ending even sporadic service.  Route  In order to move ore from the mines in Monte Cristo to the smelter in Everett in 1894, a train would travel on three different sections of track. It would begin its journey from Monte Cristo to Hartford Junction on the tracks of the \\"Eastern Division\\" of the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway. From Hartford Junction to Snohomish it would use the track of the Seattle, Lakeshore, and Eastern Railway, which later was acquired by the Northern Pacific Railway. From Snohomish to the smelter complex in Everett, it would switch to the \\"Western Division\\" of the Everett and Monte Cristo track, the previous Snohomish, Skykomish, and Spokane Railway which had been acquired in 1892.Robe Canyon tunnel #5 in 1894 Traveling east from Hartford Junction, on the Eastern Division, the Everett and Monte Cristo reached the town of Granite Falls after traversing relatively moderate terrain for some 6 miles. There was a two-story depot in Granite Falls. Just east of town, the tracks followed the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River into Robe Canyon, which was so steep-sided that six tunnels had to be dug in just two miles (a seventh tunnel, closer to Monte Cristo, was dug, collapsed, and was abandoned). Tunnel cave-ins became so problematic that the roofs of tunnels #2 and #4 were dynamited off, turning them into cuts open to the sky. Three bridges crossed the Stilliguamish as the right of way sought easier ground on one side of the river or another. Past Robe Canyon, and 29 miles beyond Hartford Junction, the railway reached Silverton, which developed as a secondary mining center along the line. It also had a depot. Three miles further on, the line reached the site of the Inn at Big Four. At 38 miles east of Hartford Junction, the route reached Barlow Pass and left the Stilliquamish drainage. The railroad built a snow shed there. At 42 miles the end of the line was reached in Monte Cristo. At this terminus there was a hand-operated turntable, rail yard, water tank, a small engine house, and a passenger depot. A spur line led to the concentrator for the collection of ore. Along the route were various spurs used by mines, lumber mills, farms, and other commercial enterprises. An 1,800' sidetrack served the Cypher's and Stinson's logging camp near Granite Falls.  Construction  John Barlow was sent out with survey teams in February 1892 to finalize the location of the railroad. Grading for the railroad along Barlow's route began in April 1892, shortly after the company was incorporated. The work of building the railway was given to a number of contractors. Bowman and Paine had 150 men working on its four-mile part of the road, and wanted more men. Smith and Brothers had 320 men for its section of the railway. In May, just a month after the company was founded between 500 and 600 men were working on the Everett and Monte Cristo line. At the peak of construction in 1892, about 1,500 men were working on various aspects of the project. There were never enough men. Want ads were placed in newspapers throughout the region. An ad in San Francisco called for 1000 workers at wages of $2.25 per day. Part of the reason more men were needed was because the work was difficult and dangerous, causing many to quit. Working in rain and snow was fairly routine. There was a lot of blasting and then the laborious process of hauling away the rubble in wheelbarrows. There were very few power tools, so most of the work was pure manual labor. While some rock in the canyon was solid, other parts were piles of loose debris. Tunneling through this material caused one cave-in after another; the railroad had to abandon its tunnel #7 completely. The work could also be fatal. The walls of Robe Canyon were so steep that men would lash themselves to trees so they would not fall into the river while working. In August 1893, a premature blast started a landslide that swept a dozen men to their deaths in the Stillaguamish, unable to escape their ropes. In the same month, another laborer, Dick Mahoney, was crushed to death by a falling tree near Monte Cristo. The camps in which the railroad men found themselves were legally dry as the Snohomish County Commission decided not to approve any liquor licenses along the route. Legalisms notwithstanding, saloons and gambling dens sprang up along the line to provide amusement to the workers in the railroad camps. Many of these were immigrants with poor English language skills and they were, or perceived they were cheated at some of these establishments. Joe Monaghan's saloon was razed by an outraged party of railroad men in retaliation on September 6, 1892. Ill feeling also extended between the workers and their bosses. Reuters reported that on June 17, 1892 four Italian workers in the Smith and Brothers camp killed their foreman, and were subsequently lynched by 60 \\"white\\" men while 150 Italians looked on. Subsequent reports cast doubt on this story, but there is no doubt that there were ethnic tensions in the camps. The first rails for the Everett and Monte Cristo arrived on July 10, 1892 on thirteen Northern Pacific freight cars. These were intended to finish the Western Division, the previous Three S right of way. Over 5,000 tons of rails, fishplates, and spikes were shipped from eastern manufacturers on three sailing ships for the Eastern Division. All of them took longer to make the journey than expected. As a result, much of the initial clearing, grading, tunneling, and bridging on the Eastern Division was accomplished by hauling supplies on a corduroy road using pack animals. The road was hacked out of the forest by a party of 75 men. The first of the three ships to arrive was the smallest, the bark Guy C. Goss. She began discharging her cargo of rails on July 26, 1892. Track laying began immediately but, since the ship held only a tenth of the material, was suspended when supplies ran low. Abner Coburn took 174 days to sail around Cape Horn from New York, arriving November 1, 1892. By the time she moored in Everett, almost the entire grade was complete. The third ship, Annie H. Smith, had the worst trip of the three. She was forced by blown-out sails and a damaged rudder to retreat from Cape Horn to Stanley, Falkland Islands for repairs. Having sailed from New York on April 30, she finally reached Puget Sound in late November 1892. By the end of August 1892, the grading to Monte Cristo was almost complete and 500' of the 816' tunnel #1 was bored. Track laying had reached the first crossing of the Stilliguamish, just below the entrance to tunnel #1. The rapid progress came to a halt when heavy rains in September 1892 washed out portions of the new railroad. Construction was delayed by at least a month as repairs were made and then the snows began in earnest. In the Spring, once through the canyon and in the better weather, track was laid at the rate of a half-mile a day. By mid-June 1893 track had reached the second bridge over the Stilliquamish. The first train reached Monte Cristo in August 1893.  Operating history   Boom years (18931897)  Train service began between Everett and Snohomish, on April 11, 1893. Monday through Saturday service to Monte Cristo began in September 1893. In December this schedule was reduced to three trains a week, but thanks to the use of a modern steam-powered snowplow, the tracks to Monte Cristo were kept open all winter. Among the early cargos carried to Monte Cristo were mining equipment and the ore concentrator machinery. The concentrator was completed in mid-February 1894, and by August hopper cars of ore were finally headed out of Monte Cristo, bound for the smelter in Everett. Mines in Silverton also began shipping ore in 1894. In 1895 every train carried 6 to 8 car loads or ore from the mountains. In the first two weeks of February 1897, 24 cars of concentrates shipped from Monte Cristo. By April 1897, 40 hopper cars carrying 1,000 tons of ore were shipped in a week. This was approximately the peak of production, both in quantity and quality. The quality of the ore declined the further miners went into the mountains. The logging business was also booming for the railroad. Raw logs, some seventeen feet in diameter, rode to sawmills, and finished lumber was transported to the world. In the Fall of 1894, the railroad was contracted by local logging companies to run a line to a new log dump north of Everett. The steamer Utopia brought 50 tons of rails for this new line in October. In August 1895, 100 cars of shingles shipped out of the woods, a record for the railroad. New spurs were planned for more mills and logging camps. Even the bark stripped off by the lumber companies was valuable. In 1895, a contract from a tannery called for 100 cords of bark per week to be shipped from Silverton. Tourism grew along with mining and timber shipments. In September 1893, within days of the line's completion, a Sunday excursion train ran from Everett to Monte Cristo. The train left at 7:30 AM and reached Monte Cristo at 10:30 AM. Passengers reboarded at 3:30 PM and were home by 7:30 PM. The cost of the round trip was $2.50 per passenger. Private excursions were also arranged. In August 1895, the railroad treated 200 members of the Washington State Press Association to a trip to Monte Cristo. One reporter who went to Monte Cristo on an excursion in July 1894 reported that the train stopped in Robe Canyon to let off a couple of fisherman who wanted to try their luck in the Stilliquamish. Four hours later. on the way back to Everett, the train stopped again to pick up the two and their 115 new-caught trout. While the railway made progress commercially, natural disasters were a constant threat to operations. Heavy rains in November 1893 flooded portions of the railway from the lowlands all the way to the new station yard in Monte Cristo and threatened at least one of the Stilliguamish bridges. November 1896 brought heavy snows that piled up in the mountains. Temperatures rose in mid-November and warm winds melted the snow, quickly flooding the valleys and lowlands. The Everett and Monte Cristo tracks were closed for weeks while the company worked to repair the line. Hundreds of miners and other residents walked out of Monte Cristo when food and other supplies ran short. It was February 1897 before the rails reached Monte Cristo again and daily train passenger service did not restart until April 26. The railroad's business came to a halt again in November 1897 when rainstorms pushed the Stillaguamish River out of its banks. This time the destruction closed the line from the Granite Falls all the way to Monte Cristo. The floods swept away bridges, ballast, and rails alike, leaving no trace of the railroad in some areas. In Robe Canyon, the Stilliguamish rose until it flowed through tunnel #6. One eyewitness said that the river rose thirty feet above its normal level, and that the \\"rails were broken as if they were glass or bent into all sorts of fantastic shapes\\". An engine and several passenger and freight cars were stranded in Monte Cristo. With the loss of rail service, the town began to run out of food. Men, women, and children hiked out in the rain and snow to avoid starving. Some estimated that it would take $1 million to rebuild the line and others speculated that it would be closed forever. In mid-December, General Manager J. R. Crooker and President Frederick Gates, announced that since the mines and railroad were losing money. the washed out sections would not be rebuilt. One newspaper headline put it succinctly; without the railroad, \\"Monte Cristo Dead\\".  Waiting for repairs (18971903)  After the flood of 1897, the railroad continued to run trains between Everett and Granite Falls. Without the Everett and Monte Cristo, however, everything further to the east was cut off. The mines and the timber operations were closed. The Colby-Hoyt mines at Monte Cristo went bankrupt. The railroad was not in a hurry to rebuild past Granite Falls, as it was after the 1896 floods. As 1898 began the railroad had survey teams examining a number of alternate routes to avoid Robe Canyon. None of them were pursued. The railroad did repair the track as far as tunnel #2 in order to service the lime kiln that had begun shipping in 1897. By mid-1899 the temporary repairs had pushed through Robe Canyon to recover five full cars of shingles from the mill at Robe, but there was no commitment to rebuild the line permanently. Once Rockefeller decided to spend the money it took to repair the line in March 1900, progress was quick. On May 19, 1900 the first train since the 1897 floods reached Silverton. Repairs reached Monte Cristo shortly thereafter and the mines and lumber mills along the line were reopened. Tourist excursions began again. Though the repairs were pushed ahead with speed, they were made to last. The three bridges over the Stilliguamish were raised. Concrete retaining walls were poured in Robe Canyon to protect the roadbed from the river. In some parts of the canyon, the rails were embedded in concrete to prevent the river from sweeping them away. The Northern Pacific continued the work to improve the line after its purchase in 1902. It poured yet more concrete to protect the rails in Robe Canyon, filled in some smaller trestles, straightened some curves, and enlarged culverts under the roadbed. The Northern Pacific kept up on routine maintenance as well, clearing the tracks of the many small avalanches and fallen trees. For example, on December 31, 1902 a rock slide covered the track between tunnel #1 and tunnel #2 for 200 feet to a depth of 20 feet. A train bound for Everett was trapped on the eastern side of the closure. The passengers spent most of New Years Day in the train while the tracks were cleared. All the investment was for naught. In late 1903 Rockefeller sold his mines to ASARCO which closed them, eliminating the largest potential source of revenue for the railroad.  Quiet years (19041915)  Main line into Monte Cristo, ca. 1919. Boston- American concentrator in background. The decrepit trestle to the left is the old spur to the original concentrator. After acquiring the Monte Cristo Railway, the new owners at the Northern Pacific moved its modern rotary snow plow to the transcontinental line crossing the Cascades. Thereafter, winter service to Monte Cristo became irregular or non-existent. In 1904, a month went by without any train service. When a plow was finally procured to reopen the tracks in April, snow was found to be five feet deep. Smaller mines that had been independent of the Rockefeller interests tried to operate but it was 1907, almost four years after ASARCO closed its mines, before the next car of ore was shipped on the Monte Cristo line. A series of other mining investments, some reworking the old Rockefeller mines, and others tunneling into new areas came and went, always ending in bankruptcy. The Boston-American Mining Company went so far as to build a new concentrator at Monte Cristo, but it, too, failed before shipping any ore. While traffic on the railway was down from the boom years, natural hazards continued at their usual pace. In January 1907, sparks from a passing locomotive set fire to the timber lining of tunnel #1. Virtually the entire tunnel collapsed stranding an engine east of the blockage. Before the tunnel could be repaired, a landslide dumped 300 feet of debris 15 feet deep between tunnels #1 and #2. It took the Northern Pacific until late May to repair the damage and resume service. On February 18, 1908 a rock slide closed the tracks east of tunnel #1 for two months. In January 1909, another rockslide in Robe Canyon buried the tracks near tunnel #4. The pile was 200 feet long and 25 feet deep. It took a month to get the trains running again. In October 1910 tunnel #2 collapsed. The Northern Pacific put a crew of 100 men on the line to repair the damage, but it took until mid- October 1911 until the tracks were cleared to Robe. It was 1912 by the time trains reached Silverton. By 1913 unhappiness about the lack of service to Monte Cristo resulted in a complaint to the Washington Public Service Commission. The Commission held hearings on the matter, which forced the railroad and the miners into negotiations. The Northern Pacific agreed to repair the line for light gas cars to move men and supplies, and agreed to rebuild for heavy steam engines and hopper cars if the mines ever started producing. The first passenger train since 1908 reached Monte Cristo on July 26, 1914. These annual disasters and the costs they entailed were one of the factors that drove the Northern Pacific to lease the line to the Rucker Brothers.  Decline and end (19151936)  A gas car enters tunnel #3 in 1916 The Hartford and Eastern pursued tourist business with some success. Its gas cars took visitors to the snows of \\"Glacier Camp\\" to play in the summer snows, and for \\"unexcelled Sunday outings and fishing trips\\". A round-trip cost $1.50 with kids aged 5 to 12 going for half price. Larger outings were also organized, for example, the Mountaineers 1918 summer outing traveled up the Stilliguamish Valley by gas car. The Rucker brothers built the Inn at Big Four along the Hartford and Eastern line at Glacier Camp in 1921. It was an \\"up-to-date establishment\\" with each of the 50 rooms having its own bathroom, and electric lighting. It was a year-round resort. In the summer guests could walk along a boardwalk to visit the Big Four Ice Caves or shoot a round of golf on a nine-hole course. In the winter, the Hartford and Eastern used a small rotary snow plow to keep the tracks clear to the Inn. The Rucker's maintained a small ski operation at the site. During the Winter of 1916 the Ruckers were introduced to the problems their predecessors had struggled with. Snow avalanches blocked the rails all along the route since the Ruckers had not yet procured a rotary plow. A number of mining and timber companies complained to the Washington Public Service Commission seeking an order to force the railroad to restore service. On October 17, 1917 the Commission ordered the railway to operate a sufficient number of trains to meet the demand for service to Monte Cristo and at least one train per week during the winter snows. It was not to be. In 1921 the Washington Department of Public Works filed a complaint against the railway because it was again closed by snow. The mines were gone for good; no ore shipped from Monte Cristo after 1915. Timber shipments were 92% of the railroad's tonnage in 1930 and 1931. Even the volume of timber shipments rapidly declined after the onset of the Great Depression. In 1927 the railroad shipped 37,853 tons, while 1930 shipments dropped to 10,139 tons. The river continued to wash-out portions of the track, and landslides, snow and fallen trees periodically blocked the line. With revenue falling along with shipping volumes, there was no money to properly repair the tracks. Temporary fixes to trestles and bridges were the best that could be done, and the line became incapable of supporting heavy steam engines and conventional passenger and freight cars. Monte Cristo and Silverton were cut off for months and years at a time while the tracks waited for repairs. Eventually, the level of maintenance on the railway declined to the point where it was impossible to run even the tiny four-wheel gas \\"speeders\\" on portions of the line. The abandonment order granted by the Interstate Commerce Commission relieved the Hartford and Eastern of its common carrier obligations. This effectively ended scheduled service. Soundview Pulp Company continued to run occasional trains to haul out timber, and local residents used speeders and even hand cars to travel on parts of the road that were still passable, but by 1933 there was less need for the railroad. A paved road reached Granite Falls and a gravel road extended to Verlot. In 1936 the rails were torn up and shipped to Japan for scrap ending all rail service on the line.  Rolling stock   Everett And Monte Cristo Railway  The Everett and Monte Cristo had four steam locomotives: * Locomotive #1 was a 4-6-0 purchased from Cooke Locomotive Works in June 1892. After the line was purchased by the Northern Pacific Railway, it was designated locomotive #366. * Locomotive #2 was a 4-6-0 purchased from Cooke Locomotive Works in June 1892. It was identical to locomotive #1 and delivered only a week later. It became the Northern Pacific Railway locomotive #367. * Locomotive #3 was a 4-6-0 purchased from Cooke Locomotive Works in 1893. Later it became the Northern Pacific Railway locomotive #368. * Locomotive #4 was a 4-4-0 purchased used from the Union Pacific Railway. It later became Northern Pacific locomotive #632. Locomotives #1 and #2 were shipped in pieces from Patterson, New Jersey and assembled in a Northern Pacific roundhouse. Locomotive #1 moved off under its own steam to help in the construction of its tracks on July 23, 1892. In addition to the four engines, in 1901 the Monte Cristo Railway had 21 box cars, 50 flat cars, 35 hopper cars, 3 cabooses, 1 rotary snow plow, 3 passenger cars, and 2 combination freight/passenger cars.  Hartford and Eastern Railway  In 1933, just prior to ceasing operations, the railway owned very little rolling stock. It leased one light steam locomotive, which was rarely used because both it and the tracks it ran on were in poor repair. It owned three gasoline-powered train cars which sat 21, 27, and 42 passengers. These \\"gas cars\\" might also pull a trailer or two. The line also owned two gasoline-powered \\"speeders\\", four-wheeled conveyances that might seat 5 to 7 passengers. The line owned no freight cars of any sort. The Hartford and Eastern's last owner, Soundview Pulp Company, had some flat cars that were used to haul wood products along the line.  Railroad legacy  Robe Canyon tunnel #5 in 2018 Evidence of the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway can still be seen. Snohomish County created Robe Canyon Historic Park with two hiking trails that largely follow the old railway grade. The Lime Kiln Trail begins east of Granite Falls and follows the route east to where it crossed the South Fork of the Stilliguamish River for the first time. Here the railroad had a 150' Howe truss bridge just prior to entering tunnel #1. The bridge is long gone, so the trail stops at the river. Along the way it passes the site of a lime kiln which began shipping product on the railroad in 1897. The Old Robe Trail begins at the other end of Robe Canyon and works its way west, back toward Granite Falls. It follows the right of way to just before the entrance to tunnel #6. While the trail is officially closed beyond this point, some hikers have followed the route to beyond the site of tunnel #4. While there are few rails or ties remaining in situ, the concrete walls intended to protect the tracks from the river, and the concrete in which the ties were set are much in evidence as are tunnels #6, #5, and the cut at the site of tunnel #4. The natural hazards of the canyon that caused problems for the railroad are also still quite visible. In some places the roadbed is covered by landslides, while others have been washed away by the river. The exit to the cut at tunnel #4 is completely blocked by a rock slide. When regular service on the Hartford and Eastern ended in 1933, area residents, businesses, and the U.S. Forest Service which administered the nearby public lands began a concerted effort to replace the railroad with an automobile road. The effort ultimately resulted in the Mountain Loop Highway. Going east from Granite Falls, the new highway went north of Robe Canyon avoiding the flooding and landslides that the trains contended with. However, the 20 miles of the Mountain Loop Highway between Verlot and Barlow Pass was built on the original railway grade, perhaps the most significant legacy of the Everett and Monte Cristo. Turntable at Monte Cristo in 2003 Locomotives on the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway used a turntable in the Monte Cristo rail yard in order to change directions prior to heading back to Everett. The turntable was hand powered, and once had a roofed structure to keep the snow from interfering with its free movement. The turntable is the only part of the Monte Cristo rail yard that is still in place. A final legacy of the railroad is the Big Four picnic area, maintained by the US Forest Service, at the site where the Inn at Big Four once stood. The inn burned to the ground on September 7, 1949. The only remnant is the massive double fireplace that once stood in the lobby.  Model railroading  The dramatic history and scenery of the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway has made it a subject for model railroaders. The line has been featured in several model railroading publications.

It was designed by Frederick B. Menkens and built from 1904 to 1905. The property is owned by Newcastle City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Frederick Ash Building is located within the area bound by Hunter, Burwood, King and Wheeler Place/Plaza in Newcastle. The area was part of a grant of 2,000 acres made to the Australian Agricultural Company (A.A. Company) in 1829. The A.A. Company introduced large scale coal mining in Newcastle, even exporting to the East India Company.Annual Company Returns to New South Wales Securities Comm. As cited in Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.2 The A.A. Company held a monopoly over control of the Newcastle mines until 1853. During this time, government policy did not allow them to sell off small parcels of the land. However, when the A.A. Company relinquished sole rights of the mine to the government in 1853, they were allowed to sell blocks of land which saw the township of Newcastle move westward.Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.2 A portion of land was purchased by Frederick Ash under the common business name of Fredrick Ash Limited or Fred Ash Limited est. 1855 when he was 23 years old. In 1860 Frederick Ash went into partnership with James Norsworthy. In 1860-1861 Ash and Norsworthy were recorded as owning and occupying a shop of iron construction in King Street and the adjoining property and wooden house owned and occupied by Frederick Ash.Newcastle Morning Herald, 9 September 1897 as cited in Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.2.4 The partnership lasted 6 years as Norsworthy returned to England due to ill health.Wilfred James Goold, The Birth of Newcastle. P.5-6 as cited in Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.2.4 The Frederick Ash Building was designed by F. B. Menkens. It was built in 1904-05 as a warehouse for Frederick Ash. It appears to have served as a retail showroom with office and storage space on upper floors. Frederick Ash used this building to sell hardware and store building materials with workshops and packing rooms behind.National Trust List as cited in Annexure C of Godden/Mackay, 1992 Frederick Menkens was born in the 1850s in Germany. It is likely he left Europe because of the political unrest there and to escape military service. He migrated to Australia in the 1870s whereby he established a practice in Maitland in 1881. In Germany Menken's gained experienced whereby he worked for 6 monthly periods during summer as a bricklayer, stonemason, carpenter, plumber, painter and clerk of works. During winter he studied at building academies focusing on the theoretical and artistic aspects of his profession. At the end of this five-year period he entered the Royal Polytechnicum at Hanover and received his diploma in architecture.Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.10.1 Menkens' design is significant because of its rarity as an example of a small scale commercial building in the Romanesque style which contributes to the historic landscape.Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 6.3 Frederick Ash Limited was an innovative company listing for sale galvanised, corrugated and plain iron, sheet lead, cements, electrical materials, white leads, oils, 53 varnishes, British plate and sheet glass, builders' ironmongery, household ironmongery, brushware, mouldings and paper hangings. In 1897 Frederick Ash Limited advertised the arrival of goods from overseas.Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.3.5 In 1908 Frederick Ash Ltd advertised themselves as merchants and importers with head offices. They boasted of a warehouse in Hunter Street West, bonded and free warehouses in Burwood Street as well as a galvanised iron warehouse in Church Street. They also had a London office located at 556 Mansion House Chambers, 11 Queen Victoria Street, S.W.Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.3.7 In 1929 the company was described as merchants, importers and manufacturers, specialists in building material. Frederick Ash also had the advantage that Sydney firms did not compete for work in Newcastle. The company had offices in Cessnock, Sydney, Leichhardt, Marrickville, Lismore and Wollongong.Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.8 The building was subsequently acquired by the Newcastle City Council, with the council's Digital Print Services business operating out of the building as of 2018. The council will vacate the building in late 2018 as part of a move of council staff to a new office building. It has proposed to either sell or long-term lease the Frederick Ash Building with the possibility of redevelopment.  Timeline of the Frederick Ash company  * 1887: Floated as a Limited Liability Company under the name of \\"Fredc Ash, Limited\\". * 1891: London office opened to \\"regulate the export of English and Continental merchandise\\".Godden/Mackay, 1992:20, Section 3.3.4 * 1920: The original Frederick Ash Limited went into liquidation and a new company of the same name was formed, acquiring the assets of the earlier company. * 1937: Change of company name to Frederick Ash Pty. Ltd. * 1955: Name of company reverted to Frederick Ash Limited. * 1977: Name of company became Frederick Ash Pty. Ltd.(Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.8.) * 1969: The company was taken over and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Swans Limited and the Hunter Street property was sold and occupied on a leasehold basis.(Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.9.)  Description  Front facade The Frederick Ash Building was built in 1904-1905.Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 4.0 It has a distinguished facade which contributes considerably to this lively and historic streetscape. This building is a fine example of a small scale commercial building in the Romanesque style which contributes to the historic landscape. The building is 60 metres long and 15 metres wide. The front section is 21 metres long and 4 storeys high while the rear section is 30 metres long and 3 storeys high. There are 12 equal bays on eastern side and 13 equal bays on western side. The building has a four-storey facade in three bays articulated by large end piers and smaller intermediate ones. The fine brickwork is red-brown in colour. The first and third floor windows have semicircular arched heads, those at first floor level being treated as Diocletian windows with multiple panes in the semicircles. The windows of the second floor have segmental arched openings and the skyline is elaborate with brick machicolation, stepped piers with corbelled tops. The words \\"FRED ASH LTD\\" can be seen on the parapet above the skyline. On a panel above that, it states, \\"ESTAB 1855\\". The ground floor has a tall ceiling sheeted with decorative pressed metal in the five northern bays, which also have slender columns of cast iron. The staircase, at the rear of the building, is of timber with turned timber balustrade. The first floor has wide semicircular front windows and in the front bas, ceilings, cornices and beams casings of pressed metal with Art Nouveau decorative panels. There are attached brick wall piers of bull-nose bricks on all storeys. The floors are of timber and there are toilets at this level. On the second floor are the former offices, which have some remnants of fine joinery and panelling. There is a central row of timber posts supporting the lateral timber beams and the ceilings are mainly of ripple iron. The third or top floor has 14 inch brick perimeter walls. The central posts are timber-bracketed. The goods elevator at the rear services all floors. Above this the timber boarded ceiling serves also as an attic floor beneath a collar-tied rafter roof which is covered with terracotta tiles.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Frederick Ash Building characterises the presence of small business associated with tradesmen and their residences in Newcastle at the end of the 19th century. The building represents the town's development and the possibilities available to tradesmen in a growing country. Major developments in mercantile and shop fitting enterprise and direct association with important building phases, activities, events and people were a result of this period. The building also reflects the importance of the evolution of the architect. It is an example of work by Frederick Menkens who was influential in designing and shaping early 20th century Newcastle. He enriched English architecture of Newcastle through his German \\"romantic\\" background. It came to be known as a Romanesque revival due to his mastery of brick construction and detailing.Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 6.3.2 Frederick Ash was a tradesman turned merchant who was able to prosper in conjunction with the growth of Newcastle. The business supplied the building trade of Newcastle and expanded to serve the surrounding districts and developed some specialist markets such as shop fitting. The retail shop was the public face of Frederick Ash's hardware enterprise. His business reflected the building needs and availability of resources and trades in the Newcastle area and attracted people to that part of town. Frederick Ash introduced new products to the area, some imported but many specially manufactured in his own enterprise. The Frederick Ash Building is a significant element in the evolution and pattern of the history of Newcastle and to a lesser extent NSW. Frederick Ash Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Frederick Ash building was the public face of the Frederick Ash enterprise, and is a significant element in the evolution and development of the city of Newcastle. The Frederick Ash complex is associated with the development of a major mercantile and shop fitting enterprise and with Frederick Ash himself who was a tradesman, who became a successful businessman.Godden/Mackay, 1992, pp 152 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building is associated with successful enterprises which in this case is synonymous with the name Frederick Ash.Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 7.3 Frederick Ash built up an empire which enabled him to open new stores both here and overseas as demand and new technology increased for his product The Frederick Ash Building also provides a link to a classic example of work by Frederick Menkens who was influential in designing architecture in Newcastle at the time. He used his German \\"romantic\\" background to create a Romanesque revival exhibiting his mastery of brick construction and detailing. In 1884 he advertised his professional skills as considerable continental and eight years experience in Australian Colonies with a Diploma as an architect from the Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences, of Hanover (Germany). He was also the author of several prize designs of Prominent Public Buildings (Godden/Mackay, 1992, Section 3.10.3.). The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Frederick Ash facade is a significant townscape element within the City of Newcastle. The building relates to others in the street, through its size and detailing. The facade is of finely articulated brickwork vigorously modelled with a mastery rare in Australia. The facade is a masterly example of the Victorian Romanesque style applied to a small commercial building. The Frederick Ash building is remarkable for the variety and quality of its brick detailing within a classically ordered arrangement. The building is a significant element in an historic visual corridor along Hunter Street.Godden/Mackay, 1992, pp151 The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The retail building has had strong social and cultural links with the Newcastle community for a period of 87 years. The site had a significant role as a hardware merchandiser for the community. The site was a significant provider of services, facilities, goods and new developments in hardware and homemaking for the local community and the building rate. The Frederick Ash retail building is a well known local landmark.Godden/Mackay, 1992, pp. 153 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building has potential to yield information about its construction through physical examination of its fabric. The building exhibits an unusual degree of fine brick detailing and specially fabricated components. The retail store in its role as an importer of innovatory materials and products was a link with overseas technology for the local community. The site contains an early electric passenger lift with a fine timber lined lift car. The site has archaeological potential and is likely to contain structural elements and deposits covering a period of Newcastle's history between the 1850s and 1900s, which have potential to yield information unavailable from other sources. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The rear warehouse section is significant as a representative of the relatively small scale warehouse architectural type. The front retailing section is significant as a representative example of an early twentieth century decorative style associated with retailing.

Their four wildcard opponents in the quarterfinals were the next best teams as ranked at the end of the regular season. All four home teams won their quarterfinal matches to set up an all- New Zealand clash between the Crusaders and Hurricanes for the first semifinal in Christchurch, while the Lions hosted the Waratahs for the second semifinal in Johannesburg. Both home teams won their semifinal matches with comfortable margins. The Lions then travelled away to Christchurch to play the Crusaders in the 2018 Super Rugby final.

The beta version of Fanlore launched in September 2008, and the wiki came out of beta in December 2010. As of June 2018, more than 45,000 pages have been created on Fanlore, with more than 780,000 edits made by more than 35,000 registered users. Fanlore's focus is for fans to document their understandings of and experiences in fandom, past and present. The intent of its parent group, the non-profit Organization for Transformative Works, is to preserve for future reference fandom occurrences, work done by fans, and their discussions and debates. The site's audiences include fans, journalists, academics, and people new to fandom. Fanlore is run by the Fanlore Committee within the Organization for Transformative Works. Additional volunteers termed Gardeners have extra editing access on the site, and they monitor recent edits to make sure all contributions are properly integrated. These volunteers also answer questions and provide help to fan contributors. On June 30th of 2020, the Fanlore Logo was changed, the first logo change in Fanlore's history, after more than 11 years, this change was made to make the logo fit more thematically in line with the rest of the Organization for Transformative Work's logos. Features and Culture Fanlore's major content categories include Fan Activities, Fan Communities, People, Fandoms, Perspectives on Fans, a Glossary, Tropes & Genres, Fanworks and a Chronology. Fanlore is guided by the Plural Point of View (PPOV) policy, which was discussed by one of the Organization for Transformative Works' founders, Francesca Coppa: > Fanlore is much much friendlier and more accepting and less confrontational > than most wikis, which can be notoriously hostile places. We have a specific > Plural Point of View philosophy and not just accept‚Äìbut actively seek > out‚Äìmultiple viewpoints in all things. Many of the people who have been most active on Fanlore are older, more established fans interested in documenting fannish history prior to 2010, leading to a site with a particular focus on zines and fannish activities on LiveJournal. Fanlore continues to solicit contributions from fans with different experiences. The site hosts regular editing challenges, such as the annual April Showers event and has its own social media outlets. The site's creation and development largely by female fans has also meant a focus on fan history that reflects women's activities in fannish spaces. Usage In May 2015, Fanlore announced that the site had been chosen by the American Folklife Center, part of the U.S. Library of Congress, for archiving as part of the Digital Culture Web Archive. The head of the American Folklife Center, Nicole Saylor, explained in 2016 that the site was selected because: \\"[F]an fiction and other kinds of fan works were identified as significant because fandom enacts so many of the key elements of folklore and vernacular culture. As a result, there are a range of fandom-focused sites that were selected for the collection. We were also interested in harvesting sites where communities had worked to synthesize, organize and collect examples of practice.\\" The site's content was captured from October 7, 2010 to August 5, 2016. Entries on Fanlore have been used as a resource in a number of media articles and other discussions that feature fan terminology fan activities, the history of particular genres fan discussions about their own culture, statements about fanworks by canon creators, documentation about individual fandoms and popular topics, the development of modern fandom, the history of former fan fiction authors, lists of fandom communities, representations of characters, and the topics found in fanworks. Fanlore's archiving of images has been used in fandom-related media articles. Fanlore also serves as a resource for discussions about the mission of its founding organization, the Organization for Transformative Works. Aside from the news media, Fanlore has been a resource to academics researching fans and fandom related topics. As of June 2018, Google Scholar showed 431 citations of the Fanlore wiki.

It was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. History The first cemetery in the city was a small burial ground established in 1853 in the northeast section of town. Elmwood Cemetery had its beginnings on May 11, 1867 when the Mason City Cemetery Association bought of land from John Dexter on the southwest side of the city. St. Joseph Cemetery was established just to the north of the Mason City Cemetery in 1875. The bodies from the cemetery on the northeast side of town were relocated to Mason City Cemetery in 1893, and its name was changed to Elmwood the following year. The first of Elmwood's seven mausoleum's was completed in 1908. Mason City took over operations of both cemeteries in 1949 when they were deeded to the city, and Elmwood-St. Joseph Municipal Cemetery was created. In 1958 the low areas of the cemetery were filled in and the water pond was created at the same time. The cemetery's office building was also constructed in 1958. The cemetery contains the graves of many of the community's pioneers, city founders, and civic leaders. There are military veterans from the American Civil War to the present.

It has elements of the ring as its vertices, and pairs of elements whose product is zero as its edges. Definition There are two variations of the zero-divisor graph commonly used. In the original definition of , the vertices represent all elements of the ring. In a later variant studied by , the vertices represent only the zero divisors of the given ring. Examples If n is a semiprime number (the product of two prime numbers) then the zero-divisor graph of the ring of integers modulo n (with only the zero divisors as its vertices) is either a complete graph or a complete bipartite graph. It is a complete graph K_{p-1} in the case that n=p^2 for some prime number p. For in this case the vertices are all the nonzero multiples of p, and the product of any two of these numbers is 0 modulo p^2. It is a complete bipartite graph K_{p-1,q-1} in the case that n=pq for two distinct prime numbers p and q. The two sides of the bipartition are the p-1 nonzero multiples of q and the q-1 nonzero multiples of p, respectively. Two numbers (that are not themselves zero modulo n) multiply to zero modulo n if and only if one is a multiple of p and the other is a multiple of q, so this graph has an edge between each pair of vertices on opposite sides of the bipartition, and no other edges. More generally, the zero-divisor graph is a complete bipartite graph for any ring that is a product of two integral domains. The only cycle graphs that can be realized as zero-product graphs (with zero divisors as vertices) are the cycles of length 3 or 4. The only trees that may be realized as zero-divisor graphs are the stars (complete bipartite graphs that are trees) and the five- vertex tree formed as the zero-divisor graph of \\\\mathbb{Z}_2\\\\times\\\\mathbb{Z}_4. Properties In the version of the graph that includes all elements, 0 is a universal vertex, and the zero divisors can be identified as the vertices that have a neighbor other than 0. Because it has a universal vertex, the graph of all ring elements is always connected and has diameter at most two. The graph of all zero divisors is non-empty for every ring that is not an integral domain. It remains connected, has diameter at most three, and (if it contains a cycle) has girth at most four. The zero- divisor graph of a ring that is not an integral domain is finite if and only if the ring is finite. More concretely, if the graph has maximum degree d, the ring has at most (d^2-2d+2)^2 elements. If the ring and the graph are infinite, every edge has an endpoint with infinitely many neighbors. conjectured that (like the perfect graphs) zero-divisor graphs always have equal clique number and chromatic number. However, this is not true; a counterexample was discovered by .

It is a rare species, discovered in 1928 but not seen again until 1968 and its numbers are in decline. It has a single dark green leaf and up to five reddish brown flowers with darker stripes and a labellum with short, spiky, purplish \\"hairs\\". Description Calochilus richae is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single dark green, linear, channelled leaf long and wide. The leaf is fully developed at flowering time. Up to five reddish brown flowers with darker stripes, long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. Individual flowers last for between two and four days. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are a similar length but narrower and the petals are long and wide. The labellum is flat, narrow near its base then egg-shaped, long and wide. Three quarters of the labellum is covered with short, spiky purple calli and the tip tapers to a short \\"tail\\". The column has two purple \\"eyes\\" connected by a ridge. Flowering occurs in September and October. Taxonomy and naming Calochilus richae was first formally described in 1929 by William Henry Nicholls from a specimen collected near Whroo and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (richae) honour Mrs. Edith Rich who discovered the species. Nicholls published the name Calochilus richii, Australian authorities currently use the spelling Calochilus richiae but World Checklist of Selected Plant Families uses Calochilus richae. Distribution and habitat The bald-tip beard orchid grows in hilly open forest. It is only known from a single population of fewer than twenty plants near Rushworth. Ecology This orchid is pollinated by male scoliid wasps from the genus Campsomeris when they attempt to copulate with the labellum. The capsules mature five to eight weeks later. This orchid reproduces only from seed. Conservation This orchid was first discovered in 1928 but was not seen again until 1968. About 23 plants were seen in flower in 1980 but the numbers have declined since then to between none and four plants in flower between 1998 and 2004. The species is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The main threats to the species are grazing by native herbivores, habitat disturbance as a result of illegal rubbish dumping, illegal firewood collection and illegal collecting of the flowers.

It collects its waters from Gataƒçko Polje. Geography The Zalomka River in its upper course runs through Gataƒçko Polje, and in a section from Ra≈°ƒáelice to Fojnica is called ƒêerope. After passing through shallow gorge the river enters Nevesinjsko Polje, where it is also called the Kolje≈°ka River. The Zalomka's major tributaries are the Batu≈°a, Markov Creek, Novaci, Jamnik, Sopiljski Creek a.k.a. \\"Babova Jama\\" (Jama=pit), Zovidol River, Bukovik, Vuƒçine. The Zalomka River basin, particularly as part of the Nevesinjsko Polje, is a tectonic depression that is bounded by mountain ranges of different heights and highlands. The southern reaches of the polje is framed by relatively low mountains, while bordering on the Vele≈æ (mountain) on the east, in the north with the Crvanj mountain and the Morina plateau on the northeast, on the east- southeast are the mountains of Bjelasnica and Bab. The exact boundaries of the plateau and watersheds are difficult to determine in the karst due to the extreme porosity and cracking of the limestone that drains water underground. Hydrology Throughout its course the Zalomka empties certain part of its waters into numerous estavelle, biggest of which is the last one near village of Biograd, which is also the lowest place of the field at 799 m a.s.l. With a swallow capacity of , this particular estavelle is one of the largest in the Dinaric Alps' karst. It is directly linked to the source of the Bunicahttps://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/300332469.pdf, which is situated at 37 m a.s.l., so that the sharp difference in height is reflected in the rate of groundwater flow, whose notional (fictive) speed is up to , making it the fastest underground flow in the Dinaric karst. The ratio between the highest and lowest water level in the underground is 312 m, which is the largest amplitude in the world. The Zalomka retain its waters for roughly 200 days per year. During the dry season, Zalomka dries up significantly on most of its course, leaving fish-rich pools also suitable for swimming. During late winter and most of the spring, water level gets significantly higher. Upper Horizons Hydroelectric Power Stations System Regardless of high ecological value and even higher vulnerability, the plans of harnessing hydroelectric energy from hydropower in Eastern-Herzegovina karst of Bosnia and Herzegovina are seriously considered by municipal and entity governments with revival of an old HES Upper Horizons concept, so works on the initial stage of the project are already underway with construction of a dam for reservoir of HPP Dabar in Dabarsko Polje. Ombla catchment area between Bosnia and Croatia feed of Trebi≈°njica waters The basic concept of the HES \\"Upper Horizons\\" project consists of diversion of most of the waters from Gataƒçko Polje into the Zalomka River. Then, a dam will be constructed on the river in Nevesinjsko Polje at Po≈°ƒáenje, just three kilometers upstream of the main estavelle (sinkhole) in Biograd. A part of the Nevesinjsko Polje will end up submerged, but most importantly the Biograd sinkhole will be left dry. Part of water from this reservoir should be used for planned HPP Nevesinje, and part should be diverted through a planned tunnel to existing spring of Vrijeka in Dabarsko Polje, where another power plant, HPP Dabar, will be constructed. From the Dabarsko Polje, these waters would go through another tunnel to Fatniƒçko Polje and then channeled through the polje to the tunnel that will finally divert these waters to Bileƒáa and existing Bileƒáko Lake on the Trebi≈°njica river. HPP Dabar and HPP Nevesinje are practically the principal facilities of the HES \\"Upper Horizons\\" project, however, it is planned that construction of HPP Bileƒáa would follow, as well as an upgrade of the existing facilities on Trebi≈°njica River, since diversion would maximize and stabilize annual discharge of the river, namely HPP Trebinje 1, HPP Trebinje 2, and HPP Dubrovnik 1 in Plat near Cavtat in Croatia, with construction of yet another power plant, HPP Dubrovnik 2, on Ombla deep within its wellspring cave. This attempt was criticized already by Dubrovnik region community, with several NGO's leading the way ‚Äì their main argument is too high of a cost, if ecological value and high biodiversity of the Ombla's wellspring cave system is going to be destroyed in exchange for some additional electricity produced. Hydropower projects and threats of karst-environmental degradation In addition to the usual multiple negative effects of hydro-technical and hydro- engineering projects undertaken in karst, where karst-environmental degradation has occurred as a result, with the main concern being destruction of underground ecosystems by drying or submerging, and the destruction of the highly endemic biodiversity, HES Upper Horizons will take from the Neretva direct flow cca through tributaries the Buna, the Bunica and the Bregava (that's average discharge of Bregava River alone). This will affect the Lower Neretva, where eventual destruction of the ecosystem has become an obvious threat to the lives of people. The main argument in environmental circle is that concept of HES \\"Upper Horizons\\" and decision on its feasibility is based on researches and opinions made more than seventy years ago.(Kra≈°ka polja‚Ä¶ 1967).

After a long struggle for the control of the Levant which had started in 705 BC, the Kushites had gradually lost control of Lower Egypt and, by 665 BC, their territory was reduced to Upper Egypt and Nubia. Helped by the unreliable vassals of the Assyrians in the Nile Delta region, Tantamani briefly regained Memphis in 663 BC, killing Necho I of Sais in the process. On learning of these events, Ashurbanipal aided by Necho's son, Psamtik I and his Carian mercenaries, returned to Egypt with a large army and comprehensively defeated the Kushites near Memphis. The army then proceeded south to Thebes, which quickly fell as Tantamani had already fled to Lower Nubia. The city was thoroughly sacked, its inhabitants were deported and much booty taken back to Assyria, including two large obelisks. The sack of Thebes was a major event in the history of the city and of ancient Egypt in general. It effectively marks the end of the 25th Dynasty of Egypt as Tantamani lost his main foothold in Egypt. The Kushites were permanently expelled within a decade of the fall of Thebes as none of Tantamani successors would ever manage to retake territories north of Elephantine. Durably weakened, Thebes peacefully submitted itself less than six years after the sack to a large fleet sent by Psamtik to control Upper Egypt as he freed himself from the Assyrian vassalage. The sack thus permitted the rise of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, the end of the Third Intermediate Period and the beginning of the Late Period. The sack seems to have reverberated more generally throughout the Ancient Near East, it is notably mentioned in the Book of Nahum as an example of the destruction and horror that can befall a city.  Background  Esarhaddon struggled with Taharqa for the domination of the Levant and then of Egypt. In the late 8th century BC, Egypt and Nubia were united and ruled by the Kushite pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt. The Neo-Assyrian Empire was already extending its influence over the Levant at the same period, and in the spring of 720 BC Piye or perhaps Shebitku fought and lost a first battle against the Assyrians near Rafah. The situation did not change owing to the Assyrian hegemony until c. 705 BC when the death of Sargon II led to revolts against the Assyrians throughout their empire. Shebitku's successor Shabaka seized the occasion and return to the Levantine coast, where he was free to roam until c. 701 BC when Sennacherib was finally able to assemble an army and win over the Egyptians at Eltekeh. Following these events, Shebitku and his successor Taharqa enjoyed a period of peace and managed to increase their influence once more over the Levant and along the Phoenician coast. This situation went unchecked until c. 679 BC, at which point Esarhaddon led a military campaign up to the Brook of Egypt and then in Phoenicia c. 676 BC. The results of these activities was to put the Levant firmly into Assyrian hands. However, by this time Essarhadon had realized that a conquest of Lower Egypt was necessary in order to permanently reduce the Kushite threat on the Levant. In March of 673 BC, Essarhadon sent a large military force to Egypt, possibly via the Wadi Tumilat but was defeated by the Egyptians under Pemu, then ruler of Heliopolis for the Kushites. Esarhaddon returned two years later in the summer of 671 BC and after a number of battles, was able to take Memphis, wound Taharqa, capture his brother and his son Nes-Anhuret, heir to the throne. Taharqa's remaining son, Atlanersa, was then likely too young to reign and another brother of Taharqa, Tantamani would ultimately ascend the throne. As a consequence, the Kushites were temporarily expelled from Lower Egypt, which passed under the control of Assyrian vassals, in particular Necho I in Sais. In spite of these successes for the Assyrians, the Egyptian vassals in the Delta region were unruly and Taharqa was attempting to return to Lower Egypt. Esarhaddon launched a novel military expedition c. 669 BC but died that year, allowing Taharqa to retake Memphis and, finally, the Delta region in late 668 BC. In 667 BC, Esarhaddon's heir Ashurbanipal decided to re-establish the Assyrian dominion over Egypt, invading the land in October of that year and going up to Thebes were they defeated Taharqa while simultaneously quelling a rebellion in the Delta. Soon after, Taharqa might have won some victory in Thebes which allowed him to keep control of Upper Egypt. In Lower Egypt, Necho was reinstated vassal king of Sais in spite of his betrayal. The situation did not change until 664 BC with Taharqa's death.  The year 663 BC  Tantamani failed to hold Memphis after the arrival of the Assyrians.  Tantamani's failed reconquest  Taharqa was succeeded by his brother Tantamani at his death. Tantamani immediately launched a massive military campaign aiming once more at uniting Egypt under the rule of the 25th Dynasty. His army travelled north, stopping at Napata, Elephantine, Thebes and Heliopolis fortifying both in 664 BC. Tantamani arrived in Memphis in April 663 BC and killed Necho I during the ensuing fight near the city. Tantamani then proceeded north and received the capitulation of some but not all Delta kinglets, then expulsed the remaining Assyrian troops from Egypt while Necho's young son Psamtik managed to flee to Assyria via Palestine.  Sack  Ashurbanipal sacked Thebes but failed to durably establish the Assyrian presence there. The Assyrians soon returned to Egypt. Together with Psamtik I's army, which comprised Carian mercenaries, they fought a pitched battle in north Memphis, close to the temple of Isis, between the Serapeum and Abusir. Tantamani was defeated and fled to Upper Egypt but just 40 days after the battle, Ashurbanipal's army arrived in Thebes. Tantamani had already left the city for Kipkipi, a location that remains uncertain but might be Kom Ombo, some south of Thebes. The city itself was conquered \\"smashed (as if by) a floodstorm\\" and heavily plundered. The event is not mentioned in Egyptian sources but is known from the Assyrian annals,Robert G. Morkot: The Black Pharaohs, Egypt's Nubian Rulers, London , p. 296 which report that the inhabitants were deported. The Assyrians took a large booty of gold, silver, precious stones, clothes, horses, fantastic animals, as well as two obelisks covered in electrum weighting 2.500 talents (c. 75.5 tons, or 166,500 lb): The sack of Thebes was a momentous event that reverberated throughout the Ancient Near East. It is mentioned in the Book of Nahum chapter 3:8-10 and a prophecy in the Book of Isaiah 20:3-5 refers to the sack as well  Aftermath   Kushite kingdom of Napata  Portrait of Mentuemhat, Thebes, late 25th to early 26th Dynasty, 665-650 BCE - Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art Concurrently or soon after the sack, the Kushite army withdrew from Egypt in large numbers, a momentous event that was still remembered some 200 years later and gave rise to Herodotus' story about 240,000 Egyptian deserters settling in Nubia. Tantamani's fate after the loss of Thebes is not entirely clear: he seems to have ruled for some time as king of Kush, as suggested by a relief of him in Jebel Barkal. Indirect evidence points to a continued Kushite presence in Upper Egypt between 661 BC and 656 BC: monuments show that the Thebans continued to acknowledge the sovereignty of Tantamani until as late as 656 BC, although the actual extent of his power is uncertain. At the same time, the supreme authority in Thebes seems to have been in the hands of Mentuemhat and his wife Shepenupet II. By 653 BC Tantamani's successor Atlanersa was on the throne and he reigned solely over Nubia, with his seat of power in Napata, starting the so called Napatan period of Nubia. Although Atlanersa and his successors styled themselves as Egyptian pharaohs, none of them posed a serious threat to Egypt. After imposing his authority over Upper Egypt, Psamtik I established a garrison on Elephantine and may have led a military campaign in Nubia. By the time of Psamtik II, c. 590 BC the Egyptians had sacked Napata.  End of the Assyrian presence  Ultimately, Psamtik I was the main beneficiary of the sack of Thebes. The Assyrians did not hold Thebes for long: already by 662 BC, one year after the sack, some Thebans were dating their documents as per Tantamani's years of reign, suggesting that the Assyrians had already left the region. Around the time of the sack Ashurbanipal was personally involved in two conflicts in Phoenicia, submitting Arwad and Tyre. Soon after he participated in further campaigns against the Mannai, the Elamites and the Medes, all between 665 BC and 655 BC, which might explain why he did not maintain an Assyrian presence in Thebes.  Late Period of Egypt  In the decade following the sack, the Assyrian influence in Egypt quickly waned as Psamtik I managed not only to dominate the other kinglets of the Delta region but also freed himself from Assyrian vassalage. With Thebes' influence and outreach deeply weakened, Psamtik sent a strong military fleet to the city in 656 BC and immediately received its submission. To affirm his control over the city, he had his daughter Nitocris I adopted by Amenirdis II, who was not only the daughter of Taharqa but also the Divine Adoratrice of Amun, then the pinnacle of the powerful priesthood of Amun in the city. Psamtik then only had to secure Egypt's southern border by putting a garrison on Elephantine to submit the whole of Upper Egypt for himself. In 655 BC, Psamtik turned against his Assyrian overlord aided once more by Ionian and Carian mercenaries and allied with Gyges of Lydia. He expelled the remaining Assyrians from Lower Egypt and pursued them as far as Ashdod. Ashurbanipal then deeply embroiled in war against the Elamites had no army to send to Egypt. In the span of seven years, Psamtik had effectively united and freed Egypt, marking the beginning of the Late Period.

The bombing was committed by the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front, a radical far-left anti-Japanese organization, against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for supplying the United States against North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The 1974 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in Japan until the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995. Background The East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front (Higashi Ajia Hannichi Bus≈ç Sensen, EAAJAF) was a Japanese far-left organization founded in 1972 and espoused a communist Anti-Japaneseism ideology influenced by the New Left movement with anarchist leanings. The EAAJAF viewed the Empire of Japan as the \\"perfect evil\\" and condemned the Pacific war as an \\"aggressive war\\" committed by Japan. In 1971, the EAAJAF's predecessor organization had launched a campaign of non-fatal bombings against the Japanese state, especially targeting symbols associated with Japanese imperialism, but in 1974 escalated its campaign to include the use of violence. On 14 August 1974, the EAAJAF tried to blow up the bridge over which Emperor Hirohito's royal train was travelling, which they code-named the \\"Rainbow Operation\\", but this was aborted because a member was spotted shortly before it was to be put into action. The following day Mun Segwang, a Korean- Japanese member of Chongryon and a far-left militant organization tied to the EAAJAF, attempted to assassinate President Park Chung-hee of South Korea. Despite Mun's failure to kill Park, the attack soured the already fragile Japanese-Korean relations and encouraged the EAAJAF's Wolf cell into committing new terrorist bombings in sympathy with Mun. The EAAJAF targeted Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, a large Japanese corporation which manufactured military weapons that were later used by the United States against North Vietnam in the Vietnam War in the early 1970s. Bombing Members of the ‚ÄúWolf‚Äù (≈åkami) cell of EAAJAF planted two powerful home-made time bombs (containing 45 kilograms of explosives) in a flower pot at the entrance of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries's head office block in the busy Marunouchi district of Tokyo. The EAAJAF gave a telephone warning to the people inside the building eight minutes before the explosion, but it was dismissed as a joke, and another warning came four minutes later after the first warning was ignored, but the telephone exchange still did not launch an evacuation procedure. One of the bombs failed to detonate but the other did, exploding at 12:45 p.m. (UTC+9), which was around lunchtime. Eight people died: five people were killed instantly (including two Mitsubishi employees) while another three died after being hospitalized shortly afterwards. An estimated 376 people were injured in the blast, with about 330 people brought to hospital, of which 116 were Mitsubishi employees. The explosion blasted all of the office block's glass up to eleven stories high, as well as glass from buildings opposite which included the headquarters of Mitsubishi Electric, and was loud enough to be heard from Shinjuku over 5 kilometers away. Vehicles and some trees in the streets were also destroyed. Aftermath The bombing caused a lot more damage than the EAAJAF expected due to the lack of evacuation, causing an outrage among the media. One editor said ‚ÄúThis incident is a most atrocious challenge to our society. Society itself was the target and the victim.‚Äù The Japan Times incited for a ‚Äúshow of public wrath‚Äù against the terrorists. However, rightist Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka as well as leaders of leftist parties remained silent about the incident. Nervousness among the Tokyo population increased following two other bombings carried out by the group in the city in 1974, with the police still not having made arrests. The members of EAAJAF were arrested on May 19, 1975. In 1987, Masashi Daidoji and Toshiaki Masunaga were convicted and sentenced to death. Daidoji, leader of the former group's Wolf cell, said during court hearings that the bombing was \\"a mistake\\". In May 1999 while under death row, he apologized to the victims for the first time, saying \\"Our causing casualties is not something I can justify. I would like to apologize from the bottom of my heart.\\" Daidoji died on May 24, 2017 at the Tokyo Detention Center. The 1974 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack defined by modern standards that had occurred in Japan at the time, and remained the deadliest for over two decades until the Tokyo subway sarin attack on 20 March 1995 which killed 12 people.

Many Continental ships were trapped in the Delaware River watershed above Philadelphia following the capture of that city by the British Army in 1777. Prior to departing the city in 1778, the British staged a raid to destroy ships that Continental and state forces had secreted in various waterways.

History   Earlier churches  In 1838 a temporary chapel had been erected in Cameron Street for the local Catholic community, which up to that moment had no fixed place of worship in the city. In the same year the government granted the Catholics a site in Margaret Street, \\"at the foot of the Cataract Hill\\", for the construction of a permanent building, a chapel dedicated to Saint Joseph. The foundation stone for the St Joseph's church was laid on 19 March 1839 by Rev. Gentleman, and the church was inaugurated in October 1842. Two decades later, St. Joseph's Church began to show signs of decay, and it was decided to replace it with a larger church.  Church of the Apostles  The plans for the new church were drawn by the Tasmanian architect Henry Hunter, and the foundation stone was laid on 15 September 1864 by Bishop Willson. By October 1866 the nave and two aisles had already been built, and on 7 November the church was solemnly opened for religious purposes by Rev. Murphy, Bishop of Hobart. The church was dedicated to Mary, Queen of the Apostles. Construction of the North section, encompassing the transept, sanctuary and sacristies, began several years later. Bishop Murphy laid the foundation stone on 17 June 1888. By then, Hunter was living in Brisbane and the task was entrusted to architect Alexander North. A foundation stone for the tower was laid in May 1889, but it wasn't finished until a century later. Designed by Melbourne architect Peter Staunton, the bell tower and spire were installed in 1989. The church conserves its original stone high altar. The pulpit, made from blackwood and huon pine, was the work of Timothy Earley. The church's pipe organ, in two flanking columns, was dedicated in 1933.

The series aired in Japan between October and December 2018. A second season titled Zombie Land Saga Revenge has been announced. A manga adaptation began serialization on Cygames' Cycomi website in October 2018. Plot In the year 2008, high school student Sakura Minamoto is abruptly killed by a truck on the morning she plans to submit an idol application. Ten years later, Sakura, along with six \\"legendary\\" girls from various eras of Japan's history, are brought back as zombies by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi, who seeks to revitalize Saga Prefecture by putting together an all-zombie idol group known as . Characters  Franchouchou  Franchouchou („Éï„É©„É≥„Ç∑„É•„Ç∑„É• Furanshushu) is an idol group founded by K≈çtar≈ç Tatsumi, which is made up of 7 legendary girls/zombies and one normal resurrected by Kotaro. His goal is to save Saga and revive the trend of local idols in the process thanks to the zombieland saga project. Because they can be persecuted when their real identities are exposed, they are presented with their aliases in public. Because they do not all come from the same period and some are unaware of the contemporary, they tend to show a conservative and old-fashioned stance. Tatsumi's original idea is to \\"support everyone's feelings beyond the ages\\" as a reason to collect members from different ages together. At the beginning of the story, Sakura was the first to awaken her senses; then the others except for Tae Yamada, awakened their senses after the first performance. The group's names were provisionally \\"Death Musume\\" and \\"Green Face\\" respectively in their first two performances; but at the decision of the members of the group it was changed by \\"Franchouchou\\". For all of them it is possible to eat and drink normally like a living human being, but because they are zombies, their bodies have injuries, scratches and stitches wrapped in bandages that would reveal the cause of death of each one in addition to having red pupils. When their bodies are under too much pressure, they cause their joints to click and loosen, causing eyeballs to open, limbs, torso, and head detach from the body. When performing as normal idols, they take on an appearance no different from normal people thanks to Kotaro's abilities, however, being makeup, it easily comes off with water or rain. In addition, in their current state, they are unharmed by serious and fatal injuries such as gunshots, lightning or traffic accidents. The work that Tatsumi offers them always wears them down because they are from one day to the next and two of the seven maintain a relaxed attitude. They practice singing and dancing in a studio located in a western- style house.

Career Gospel singer Mahalia Jackson was the first artist that Malloy was allowed to mix. From listening to her sing in studio, he knew that engineering was what he wanted to do. Next, he worked with Duane Eddy, who liked Malloy's work so much that he suggested him to producer Chet Atkins who came to Los Angeles seeking an engineer. Atkins wanted Malloy in Nashville, Tennessee, and he moved there in the mid-1960s. He worked with Atkins at RCA Victor from January 1965 to November 1968, then at Monument Records.

Operated by the Schroeder Area Historical Society, it collects and interprets the history of the local area and the greater North Shore of Lake Superior. The center opened in 2002 in a Tudor Revival building constructed in 1929 as the Stickney Inn and Store. The building is located on the south side of Minnesota State Highway 61 near the west bank of the Cross River. Stickney Inn and Store In 1921, Horace T. Stickney (1885‚Äì1983) purchased a parcel of land along the Cross River in Schroeder from Hedley Redmyer. The parcel had been part of the Schroeder Lumber Company's logging camp. At the time of the purchase, the property included the Schroeder Lumber Company Bunkhouse, the logging superintendent's house, a shed, and an office building. Stickney called it a \\"depressed place\\" because of past logging and the burned landscape. His first store, built in 1922, burned down when the gas stove malfunctioned during food preparation. After the fire, local artisans and an unnamed architect helped Stickney build a new structure featuring prominent, half-timbered gables. On June 6, 1929, the Cook County News Herald reported that the Stickney Inn featured bedrooms and a large dining room as well as a confectionary and store. The first floor had a grocery store, a kitchen, a post office, a dining room, and a living room with a large stone fireplace. The second floor had seven tourist bedrooms for 15‚Äì20 people. It was one of the first buildings in Schroeder to have indoor bathrooms. Soon Stickney received requests for cabin rentals. In 1930 he built a log cabin, measuring , behind the inn overlooking the Cross River. After he completed a second cabin, a Minnesota tourism pamphlet described the site as \\"Stickney's Resort\\". By 1936, Stickney had built eight cabins with views of the river and the shores of Lake Superior. The inn served as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) winter headquarters for workers who arrived on the North Shore in 1933. They constructed of telephone line, of truck lines, thirty bridges, three dams, and sixteen United States Forest Service buildings. The single-lane steel bridge (built in 1915) over the Cross River was replaced in 1932. A small sign on Highway 61 advertised the Stickney Store and Cabins. It was a destination on the North Shore, and the Northland Bus Depot maintained a depot stop at the inn throughout the 1940s and 1950s. The Stickneys did not offer organized activities; tourists were attracted to the hikes, trout fishing, and games of horseshoes. The inn did have an ample living room and a piano used for songfests and dancing. Author Florence Page Jacques wrote about her visit to the Stickney Inn and Store on November 13, 1942. She noted that she was surprised to see the inn's three modern bathrooms and to stay warm in the snug, airtight building. Horace and Nell Stickney sold the inn to Horace's nephew, Harry Stickney Lamb (1909‚Äì1971), in 1955. Harry and Doris Mae Lamb (1913‚Äì2003) moved to Schroeder in December 1954. After Harry Lamb became postmaster in 1955, they renamed the inn Lamb's Resort. In the early 1950s, the Erie Mining Company started construction of a taconite loading facility south of Lamb's Resort. Harry Lamb made an agreement with the ore carriers to supply them with groceries. The third generation to live and work in the Stickney/Lamb store took over in 1965. Harry Lamb's son, Horace \\"Skip\\" Lamb, purchased the resort with his wife, Linda. In 1976 the Lambs separated the Stickney Inn and Store from the resort property and sold the inn to Bill and Gloria Jordon. The Lambs moved the post office into an empty Pure Oil station. The Jordons named their purchase Cross River General Store. Cross River Heritage Center The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) condemned the inn and store in preparation for highway repairs and bridge replacement in 1998. The Schroeder Area Historical Society persuaded MnDOT to transfer the title of the Stickney Inn and Store building to Schroeder Township in 1998. With secured funding and volunteer support, the Schroeder Area Historical Society completed the building's restoration in 2002 and began operating the building as the Cross River Heritage Center.

In Colorado, she was thought to be the first woman licensed to practice medicine in the state. She was also the Superintendent of Hygiene for Colorado. Avery was among the first women first admitted to the Denver Medical Society. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2020. Early life Alida Cornelia Avery was born on June 11, 1833 in Sherburne, New York. Her parents were Hannah (Dixon) Avery and Deacon William Avery. She had two sisters and five brothers. At the age of 16, she began teaching. New England Female Medical College in 1860 Women began entering the medical profession in the second half of the 19th century. Some of them attended medical schools founded by and for women. Avery studied medicine for one year in 1958 at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania and graduated from the New England Female Medical College in Boston in 1862. Career Brooklyn After she graduated, it was difficult for her to establish a private practice, sometimes taking some women five years until the practice was self-supporting. Avery settled in Brooklyn, where she had a \\"discouraging time\\" being able to obtain a medical office. Once she found one, she admitted, \\"I must own to a little dread of the publicity [of being a woman physician] that involves. I am not quite callous to doing things that people sneer at and say hateful words about; but I shall not think of that if I have work.\\" After two months, she found that her patients were primarily her friends that she met before she moved to Brooklyn. Vassar College Woodcut print of the campus of Vassar College, 1879 In 1865, she was hired by Vassar College as its resident physician and as the Professor of Physiology and Hygiene. From 1866 until 1874, she was secretary of the faculty. She also organized the school's Floral Society. Her infirmary was established in a suite of rooms in the Main Building, where she was responsible for the health of her patients and the entire college. Avery believed in hydro-therapy and ensured sanitary conditions for food, water, and milk. She was responsible for decisions regarding control of quarantine, whether staff should be retained or dismissed due to health reasons, whether to hold chapel in bad weather, and when to turn on the heat in buildings. All new students were required to take her course in hygiene. She emphasized the importance of a healthy, balanced diet to become successful intellectually. Many young women with impaired digestion or uncertain health became healthy as a result. Physiology was a required subject in the junior and senior years for the first two decades of Vassar's history. Avery and astronomer Maria Mitchell, the only other woman on the faculty at that time, learned that their salaries were less than that of many younger male professors. They insisted on a salary increase, and got it. She was seen as a guiding force in Vassar's early years. Frances A. Wood, the head librarian, said: \\"She came in 1865 as the resident physician, was a strong member of the Faculty, high in the confidence and trust of [President] Raymond and [Lady Principal] Miss Lyman and sharing with them the responsibility of that important formative period. So close were the friendly and confidential relations among these three 'powers that be'‚Äîhardly ever one appearing without the other‚Äîthat some irreverent students dubbed them 'The Trinity.'\\" Denver Avery moved to Denver in 1874. She began practicing medicine, and was the first woman licensed to practice medicine in Colorado. She was also the Superintendent of Hygiene for Colorado. By 1877, she was making $10,000 () a year. In 1881, she was admitted to the Denver Medical Society, as were Edith Root and Mary Barker Bates. They were the first women to be admitted to the organization. She retired in 1887. After she moved to California, though, she established a medical office in San Francisco and she practiced medicine there for several years. Personal life While at Vassar, she had a \\"beautiful\\" four-room apartment in the Professor's wing and was known for the garden she established. She was good friends of fellow staff members Maria Mitchell and the Hannah Lyman. In 1876, she was elected vice president of the Women's Suffrage Association. She created the reform strategy in 1877 for Colorado suffragettes to win the right to vote. She proposed the arguments that women were entitled to the right to vote due to their important responsibilities within the home and that having women vote would \\"contribute to the triumph of rule by reason over rule by violence.\\" In 1885, she spoke about A Plea for Purpose before the Association for the Advancement of Women, of which she was a member. Avery signed a paper, along with Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward and other women from the National Council of Women, that expounded upon the negative effects of women's fashion, particularly the corset. She was an active member of the Unitarian Church, women's movement, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Her involvement in these organizations deepened following her retirement. She moved to San Jose, California in 1887. She lived in San Francisco during the 1906 earthquake, when she lost all of her property. She returned to San Jose, where she died on September 22, 1908.

In addition to defending the fiscal programs that he had imposed thus far and extolling a system of finance that was \\"prosperous beyond all expectations\\" the report enumerated existing sources of revenue, outlined the plan for the \\"Redemption of the public debt\\" and its accruing interest to stabilize the current system of funding, and proposed amendments to the System of Public Credit that were designed for the complete extinguishment government debt and to \\"prevent that progressive accumulation of Debt which must ultimately endanger all Government.\\" Essentially, his report was submitted to address the fears of the Democratic-Republicans that the public debt would later become unmanageable. Hamilton subsequently discusses resolutions adopted by Congress for the sequestration of British debts in the United States and how they were \\"not only unwarranted by principle or usage, but intirely subversive of the sound maxims of public Credit.\\" He finished by defending the need for credit in an ever-developing world as not only a public defense of sovereignty but also a private tool for prosperity.

But there is reserved out of this fund a sum not exceeding 8%, towards the payment of Interest & reimbursing of principal of the loans made for purchases of the Debt.  Propositions  Following his outline Hamilton proposed what he believed to be 10 necessary amendments to ensure its stability and survival but not immortality in the years ahead.  Conclusion  Seigniorage and Sequestration Hamilton's conclusion included two philosophical questions, both of which had far reaching implications on the idea of public credit. In essence, did a government have the right to tax its own funds, and did the government have a right to sequester or confiscate the funds of a foreign creditor in the event of a disagreement or war with that individual's nation? Hamilton believed that a government entering into a contract with a creditor enters into that contract with an individual in the state of nature, rather than as part of its or another's society. Firstly, to take a percentage of revenue due to a creditor from within its own borders amounts to a broken promise, which upends the faith upon which credit derives its value. If a reasonable creditor cannot expect a contract with the government to be upheld, others will not venture into precarious future investments, and the availability of funds will shrink. As availability of funds relates directly to the leverage a government can use to grow its economy, the breach of faith can have fatal consequences on the future of economic stability. Also, a tax on creditor citizens would then be wildly inestimable but definitively disproportionate. The creditors would be charged not only the normal taxes subjected upon consumption but also those on investment. Therefore, those who had faith in government to invest in their success would unreasonably be charged the most for that success. As to the question of foreign creditors, some believed that a government had the right to confiscate all properties of those citizens residing within the borders of belligerent nations. Perhaps, Hamilton agreed, property obtained under the protection and the security of a belligerent nation, which is paid for through taxes to that nation ought to be, at least politically, subject to confiscation. However, when the property in question is secured under the faith of the government and the laws of the debtor nation, that faith should not be upended: > What in fact is property but a fiction, without the beneficial use of it? In > many cases indeed the income or annuity is the property itself: And though > general usage may controul the principle, it can only be as far as the usage > clearly goes. It must not be extended by analogy.  Credit  Hamilton reminded Congress that the United States was still quite young and so needed to maintain its vitality and energy through the \\"invigorating principle\\" of credit to compete with the European powers, rather than to subject itself to their whims through the necessity of their manufactures. > It is impossible for a Country to contend on equal terms, or to be secure > against the enterprises of other nations without being able equally with > them to avail itself of [credit]. And to a young Country with moderate > pecuniary Capital and not a very various industry, it is still more > necessary than to Countries, more advanced in both. \\"Alexander Hamilton in the Uniform of the New York Artillery\\" by the artist Alonzo Chappel (1828‚Äì1887) In addition to the external benefits and potential ills, Hamilton stated that public and private credit were inevitably tied and that private credit was equally necessary in a developing country for people of all occupations to begin their endeavors. > 'Tis Wisdom in every case to cherish what is useful and guard against its > abuse. 'Twill be the truest policy in the United States to give all possible > energy to Public Credit, by a firm adherence to its strictest maxims, and > yet to avoid the ills of an excessive employment of it, by true ≈ìconomy and > system, in, the public expenditures, by steadily cultivating peace, and by > using sincere, efficient and persevering endeavors to diminish present > debts, prevent the accumulation of new, and secure the discharge within a > reasonable period of such as it may be matter of necessity to contract. > 'Twill be wise to cultivate and foster private Credit by an exemplary > observance of the principles of public Credit, and to guard against the > misuse of the former by a speedy and vigorous administration of Justice, and > by taking away every temptation to run in debt founded on the hope of > evading the Just claims of Creditors.  Resignation from Treasury  On January 31, 1795, Hamilton stepped down from his position as Secretary of the Treasury and returned to his legal private practice in New York.

Early life  Chen Guangxi was born in Tongcheng, Anhui Province on May 21, 1903, with his ancestral hometown in Shangyu, Zhejiang. His father was a former Qing dynasty government official. In May 1920, Chen left China to study and work in France. In 1922, Chen graduated as an agricultural machinery student and obtained a degree in agricultural mechanics. In 1929, he graduated from the School of Engineering of the University of Leuven, Belgium with degrees in Process Manufacturing, Civil Engineering and Mining Engineering. In 1930 he graduated from the Graduate School of Geology and obtained a degree in engineering geology. Chen returned to war-torn China in October 1930. He found a faculty place to teach mathematics in a middle school in Beijing after one year of unemployment. He successively worked as a lecturer at National Labour University, a course interpreter in the Chinese Northeast Navy in Qingdao, a physics and chemistry teacher in Kaifeng and a math teacher in Beijing Fu Jen Catholic University high school successively. In September 1933, he worked as a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at Fu Jen Catholic University. In September 1938, he was promoted to professor by Fu Jen. In 1945, at the end of the Second World War, Ministry of Education of the Chinese Nationalist Government newly founded the National Peking Senior Industrial Vocational School and appointed Chen Guangxi as principal. In late 1949, upon the establishment of Communist China, Chen joined a design institute in the Ministry of Machinery Industry and worked as the chief engineer. Chen paid close attention to electronic computers were introduced in western countries in early 1950s. In 1957, he left for Harbin. At Harbin Institute of Technology, Chen initiated the first electronic computer discipline in China.  Research career   Analog computer  In 1958, Chen and his team developed the first-ever structural analog computer in China. The machine could speak a few words and play chess. This intelligent chess-playing computer could calculate 40,000 times per second, was capable of logical reasoning, and could complete specific tasks of judgment.  Magnetic core  In 1963, Professor Chen presided over the development of ultra-small magnetic core, the precondition for the development of megacomputers. Later, under the guidance of Chen, the team carried out the magnetic core molding experiment of \\"rolling into a belt and rubbering into a core\\" and achieved success. This method was cutting-edge, was quickly promoted in China. The molding technology supported the development of high-speed large-capacity memory and the manufacturing of transistor computers and small-scale integrated circuit computers. This project was a major contribution to the development of computer technology in China.  Fault-tolerant computer system  Chen was praised as pioneer of fault-tolerant computer system research in China for his research in this field. In 1973, Chen Guangxi, 70 years old, proposed a major research project to solve the problem of computer reliability, and worked on computer fault tolerance technology. The project was listed as a national project by Chinese Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, and received a research fund of over 1 million Chinese yuan. Chen and his development team successfully developed RCJ-1, China's first fault-tolerant computer and \\"a dual-mode fault-tolerant system with self-test and self-correction\\". and its reliability increased by more than four times. Chen Guangxi also co-published the first fault-tolerant computing monograph \\"Diagnosis and Fault Tolerance of Digital Systems\\" in cooperation with Professor Chen Tingyu of Chongqing University. In 1981, it was published by the National Defense Industry Press and became a national textbook. Chen's computer fault-tolerant research team has achieved a number of impressive achievements, and has established a high prestige in China's aerospace industry, banking system and high-reliability computing field. The fault-tolerant technology was applied in the Chinese manned spaceflight program Shenzhou.  Other projects  Chen has also guided other research projects such as algorithm hardware implementation and database machine, and have achieved significant scientific and technological achievements. Chen has won a number of first and second prizes of National Science and Technology Progress Award. The computer science discipline Chen initiated in HIT was listed key discipline, opened up key laboratories and postdoctoral research stations, and continued to play a leading role in China.  Legacy  In 2005, a bronze statue of Chen Guangxi was unveiled in the School of Computer Science and Technology, HIT.

It details a world record-breaking cave dive of made by Geoff Yeadon and Oliver Statham from West Kingsdale Master Cave, in North Yorkshire, England to Keld Head. An estimated 20 million viewers watched its television debut. It has been called \\"legendary in caving folklore,\\" and notable cave diver Richard Stanton cites it as the impetus that sparked his interest in cave diving. Background Geoff Yeadon and Oliver \\"Bear\\" Statham began to systematically explore Keld Head in 1975. Derek Crossland found the body of Alan Erith on 4 July 1975. His body was recovered by Crossland, Yeadon, and Statham the following day. Over the years the two divers, in addition to others, explored both the Keld Head and West Kingsdale Master Cave systems. Exploration was complicated by constricted passageways, low visibility due to silt, and shortage of airbells (pockets of air) in which to swap out air cylinders. By 1976, the unexplored distance between the two systems was only . In 1978, they dived with Jochen Hasenmayer into the system, where disaster was narrowly averted. Hasenmayer became temporarily trapped in a narrow passage, and Yeadon attempted to help him escape it at great personal risk. At one point, Hasenmayer thrust his hand out to the other side of the passage and grasped Yeadon's hand; Yeadon was able untangle the line that had trapped him and Hasenmayer was freed. Yeadon later recounted, \\"I thought I was shaking a dead man's hand in there;\\" the narrow passageway would then be referred to as \\"Dead Man's Handshake.\\" By June 1978, the unexplored section between the two systems was reduced to . In July, the connection was officially made by Yeadon, Statham, and Hasenmayer traveling from Keld Head until they reached the Kingsdale line. After making the connection, they turned around and went back to Keld Head. Their next goal would be to traverse the entire distance between Keld Head and the West Kingsdale Master Cave. Outline The film details Yeadon and Statham's preparation for traversing \\"the Underground Eiger\\", so named after the mountain Eiger, as well as the venture itself. In part one, Yeadon and Statham are shown pouring red dye into the Kingdale river, a tributary of the River Lune, at the part where it goes underground. Three days later and away, the dye resurfaces at Keld Head. The two dive into Keld Head and bank emergency supplies of air cylinders underwater for their future dive. Part two begins with the Yeadon and Statham awakening on the day of the dive, January 16, 1979, in the hostel where they were staying. Once the dive begins, they are able to maintain contact with the crew on the surface thanks to the use of a new radio technology dubbed the \\"Molefone\\"--a type of speleophone that enabled communication via magnetic induction. At Dead Man's Handshake, Statham encounters serious trouble when a piece of rock jams his demand valve, though he is able to clear the obstacle and maintain his air supply. After clearing Dead Man's Handshake, the pair are in good spirits and Statham's singing of \\"Show Me the Way to Go Home\\" is picked up on the radios as they near completion of the dive. The film ends with the two successfully emerging at Keld Head. Filming Filming for the documentary was complicated by the fact that only a few camera operators hired for the project had experience filming in caves. Additionally, cavers hired for the project were under the impression that their only duties would be to haul diving and filming equipment in and out of the caves; they were surprised to learn that they would also be filmed. Simon Garvey and Stuart Herbage, two of the cavers, recalled that their only \\"acting lessons\\" consisted of two pieces of advice from Barry Cockcroft: \\"act naturally\\" and \\"don't look at the camera.\\" Filming was also complicated by technical issues. One roll of film was ruined when it was exposed to light before it was developed, necessitating some scenes were reshot. At one point, cinematographer Mostafa Hammuri fell into the water while filming a scene, though he was able to rescue himself. Video and audio of the record-breaking dive was provided by the divers themselves. Statham was equipped with two lightweight, waterproof cameras, while Yeadon was charged with maintaining radio contact with the surface via the speleophone. Legacy The film was nationally televised in the United Kingdom with 20 million viewers watching its debut. It remains \\"legendary in caving folklore.\\" Statham and Yeadon's dive was a world record at the time, and remained a United Kingdom record until it was broken in 1991. The film has emotional significance as well, as Statham committed suicide on September 28, 1979 at the age of 27. Cave diver and rescue specialist Richard Stanton states that viewing the film as a teenager inspired his interest in cave diving.

The sacred area consists of two terraces built on the slope of the hill, through a cut in the rock on the north side. Artificial terracing includes one st≈´pa, surrounded by smaller monuments, and a monastery.Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, Grafikol 2009, p.174-176 Excavations The excavations were initiated by the Italian Archaeological Mission in 1963 and ended in 1982, with a pause between 1966 and 1977. The first excavation campaign investigated the lower terrace with the main st≈´pa, while the upper terrace with the monastery it was brought to light during the second campaign. The lower terrace (called \\"Terrace of the Stupas\\") has a larger st≈´pa (Main Stupa) surrounded by other minor monuments: st≈´pas, viharas and columns. Of the Main Stupa is preserved the structure with a square plan up to the first cylindrical body, with a stairway on the north side; of the harmikƒÅ and of the umbrellas are preserved some remains found near the st≈´pa. One of the two cylindrical bodies of the monument was adorned with a frieze figured in green schist while at the four corners of the top of the rectangular body were four columns on a pedestal with a lion figure crouched on top. The life phase of the sanctuary of Saidu Sharif I was divided by archaeologists in three periods, during which time we pass from a symmetrical arrangement of the monuments (first period, between 25 BCE and the end of the 1st century) to a progressive crowding of the Terrace of the Stupa, followed by an extension of the terrace itself (second and third periods, respectively II-III century CE and IV-V century CE). The three construction periods were also highlighted on the upper terrace; the monastery underwent an extension followed by a reduction to the original dimensions in the third period, which testifies to the decline of the entire sacred area.

View looking west from Whitevale Tower, including the Bellgrove Hotel (left), spare ground, refurbished maisonettes and new houses (centre), Bellgrove railway station and tracks and older tenements in Dennistoun (right) The majority of the current housing is on the north side of the main road, much of it comprising deck-access maisonettes constructed in the 1960s as a council housing scheme. However, the streets where they were built are much older, having been at the heart of a vibrant and densely populated industrial community in the East End that was largely swept away in a slum clearance program. In particular, Slatefield Street was once the location of a country house and then a brewery, Campbellfield Street was also home to a mansion and later a large school, and Rowchester Street was home to the carnival grounds, which moved to nearby Vinegarhill when they were replaced by a tram depot. View looking north from the main road (2014) depicting the Whitevale Public Baths building and the since-demolished Bluevale and Whitevale Towers One of the few prominent remnants of the past is the derelict Whitevale Public Baths building. Another local landmark, the art deco style Bellgrove Hotel (a homeless hostel) is also located on the north side. In the early 21st century, some of the council blocks were demolished by the Glasgow Housing Association, some were refurbished and some replaced with modern houses. The 1960s development also included the Bluevale and Whitevale Towers, two 90-metre-high residential tower blocks that dominated the skyline in the area for almost 50 years until they were gradually deconstructed between 2014 in 2016 (they could not be demolished with explosives because of close proximity to the railway and other buildings). St Mungo's Academy ‚Äì a secondary school completed in 1976 to replace the original campus in the Townhead district ‚Äì and the Crownpoint Sports Centre (home of the Shettleston Harriers athletics club) and its playing fields are on the south side of the road, along with St Anne's RC Primary School and some modern apartment blocks. Commerce is very limited within the neighbourhood, but the wide range of shops at The Forge are within walking distance, as are a range of local cafes and pubs on Duke Street, Dennistoun and at Bridgeton Cross. Transport Bellgrove railway station provides a rail link to central Glasgow and also to Edinburgh in the opposite direction, while bus services (operated by First Glasgow) reflect the status of Gallowgate as a major transit corridor: the frequent '2', '61' and '240' services all use the route, with two of these including a night provision.

Bal (born ) is an Indian-American physician, epidemiologist, and public health administrator. He is also a faculty member of the John A. Burns School of Medicine of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and previously of the University of California School of Medicine at Davis and the University of Arizona College of Medicine. As a public servant, health advocate and academic researcher, his areas of focus include tobacco control, cancer and obesity prevention, and remedying socio-economic disparities in health care. Bal's career as a public servant spans 46 years but he is best known for initiating and overseeing a two-decades-long anti-tobacco campaign beginning in 1989 while serving as director of California's Cancer Control Branch and Tobacco Control Section, subdivisions of the Department of Health Services. Previously, he held the position of Pima County Health Director in Tucson, Arizona. He has also served as a president of the American Cancer Society's (ACS) local unit, a state division, and later served a term as president of the nationwide ACS organization in 2001.  Early life and education  Bal was born in Madras City, and later moved to New Delhi, India. He earned his medical degree from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. He also graduated with a Master of Science degree from Columbia University in 1970 and a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University in 1971. Bal completed his clinical residency at the University of Arizona College of Medicine.  Career   Public health  In 1973, Bal was appointed as Assistant Professor of Family & Community Medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. While continuing to teach at the University of Arizona, as a physician and epidemiologist, he held various positions in the Pima County Health Department. In 1974, he also served part-time as interim director for communicable diseases after the retirement of the previous director, Clarence Robbins. Bal went on to serve as deputy director, and was later director of the health department from 1977 to 1981. In 1981, Bal was appointed as a public health medical officer and later was promoted to become the head of the Cancer Control Branch of California's Department of Health Services. He spent 25 years in the department, gaining renown for his design of and contributions to California's anti-tobacco campaign that was replicated in many states in the U.S. and several countries around the world. The campaign was funded by the passage of Proposition 99 in 1988, which imposed a 25-cent tax on every pack of cigarettes sold in California. The funds generated were used to aggressively control tobacco use in the state, by addressing the predatory advertising and marketing practices of the tobacco industry. Another creation of this program was a statewide effort to address second-hand smoke including legislation banning smoking in California restaurants and bars. Bal was a principal architect behind the California initiative of using public funds to counter the tobacco industry's deceptive public relations and advertising campaign by designing and implementing a counter-advertising effort. In 2001, he served as the national president of the American Cancer Society (ACS). Bal is an active member of ACS, and throughout his career has held various leadership positions in the organization's local and state branches. In 2005, Bal joined the Hawaii State Department of Health as special advisor to the director of the department and district health officer for the Island of Kauai. While in Hawaii, he was responsible for bringing in federal funds to design and operate several public health efforts, focused especially on obesity control, physical activity and socio-economic disparity. Among them, the best known is Tropic Care Kauai, a biennial two-week United States Department of Defense-funded training program that brought about 400 healthcare professionals each year to Kauai to provide medical, dental, optometric and other health care to Kauai's population in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017. The program has benefited many Kauai residents, especially in the provision of much-needed dental care (which is often not covered by health insurance), and provided about 3,500 pairs of free prescription eyeglasses in just the first year. Bal was the one who first researched, applied for and brought these military training programs to Kauai, and then exported them to the other Hawaiian islands. In July 2016, Bal retired as Kauai District Health Officer after more than 11 years at the position, but the programs like Tropic Care continue.  Academic  Throughout his over four-decade-long career in public health, Bal has had clinical appointments at several medical schools. In the 1970s, he was a professor at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. From 1981 to 2005, he was a professor at the University of California School of Medicine at Davis. Since 2005, Bal has been a professor at the John A. Burns School of Medicine and the Cancer Center of the University of Hawaii. He was appointed to the University of Hawaii Board of Regents in 2014. Bal has been most active in all these universities' teaching and research programs and has been principal investigator on several National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control funded cancer prevention and control projects. He has been on the editorial boards or been an active reviewer for several peer-reviewed medical journals, as well as for the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. Bal has been a frequent national and international speaker. He gave the commencement address at Brown University Medical School in 2005.  Personal life  Bal is married to Muktha Bal and they live in Kauai. They have two adult children, Sarah and Vijay.  Awards and honors  At the American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference in 2005, Bal was awarded the ATS's Public Service Award which \\"recognizes contributions to public health related to improvement of indoor and outdoor air quality, eradication of tobacco usage, [and] prevention of lung disease.\\" In 2006, Bal was awarded the Christopher N.H.

In bestowing the honor, the American Medical Association's chairman Stephen R. Permut stated: In 2016, Bal was awarded the Harvard School of Public Health Alumni Award of Merit for \\"[pioneering] the strategy of countering the tobacco industry's deceptive marketing with an aggressive campaign of advertising.

The season follows the Legends, a dysfunctional team of time-traveling superheroes and anti-heroes, and their mission to correct aberrations in time resulting from their first mission together. It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe, and is a spin-off of Arrow and The Flash. The season is produced by Berlanti Productions, Warner Bros. Television, and DC Entertainment, with Phil Klemmer serving as showrunners. The season was ordered in March 2016. Production began that July and ended in February 2017. Principal cast members Victor Garber, Brandon Routh, Arthur Darvill, Caity Lotz, Franz Drameh, Amy Pemberton, and Dominic Purcell return from the previous season. They are joined by new cast members Maisie Richardson-Sellers, Nick Zano, and The Flash alum Matt Letscher. The series was renewed for a third season January 2017. Episodes Cast and characters Main * Victor Garber as Martin Stein / Firestorm * Brandon Routh as Ray Palmer / Atom * Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter * Caity Lotz as Sara Lance / White Canary * Franz Drameh as Jefferson \\"Jax\\" Jackson / Firestorm * Matt Letscher as Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash * Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Amaya Jiwe / Vixen * Amy Pemberton as Gideon * Nick Zano as Nate Heywood / Steel * Dominic Purcell as Mick Rory / Heat Wave Recurring * Neal McDonough as Damien Darhk * John Barrowman as Malcolm Merlyn * Wentworth Miller as Leonard Snart / Captain Cold Guest Production Development On March 11, 2016, Legends of Tomorrow was renewed for a second season. After the first season, the producers considered adjusting the Legends team for additional seasons, with Joseph David-Jones' Connor Hawke and Megalyn Echikunwoke's Mari McCabe / Vixen potential additions. For the second season, showrunner Phil Klemmer revealed that Arrow writer Keto Shimizu and The Flash writer Grainne Godfree would be working on Legends in order to \\"make our stories work in concert\\" with Arrow and The Flash. Klemmer also noted the challenges of creating more crossover elements, since Arrow's lead actor Stephen Amell and The Flash's lead actor Grant Gustin work full days for their respective shows. In terms of working within the Arrowverse, Klemmer said that the death of Laurel Lance on Arrow would \\"resonate into Season 2... [since] something that happens on Arrow can create ripples that appear on our show in a huge way. It fundamentally alters the DNA of our series.\\" The second season initially consisted of 13 episodes, with four more ordered in November 2016 to bring the season total to 17. Teasing the premise of season two in April 2016, Klemmer stated, \\"We're coming at it from a completely different angle. We're determined to make every part of season two feel like its own show. [The first episode of season two] will very much be a new pilot with new good guys, new bad guys, new stakes, new dynamics, new goals. The team will basically have to find a new purpose. Once you save the world, what do you do then?... The fact that the world was in peril sort of forced our team to fall into its own dysfunctional version of lockstep. Season two, they're no longer going to be hunted by Time Masters. They're no longer going to be burdened with having to save the world. It's no longer going to be about saving Miranda and Jonas. The interesting thing about season two is I think it's going to have a much, much different tone because our Legends are going to have a totally different purpose. They're actually going to have a totally different constitution. There will be new faces and new everything.\\" The season also introduced members of the Justice Society of America. The Society consisted of Hourman, Vixen, Commander Steel, Obsidian, Stargirl and Dr. Mid-Nite. The season also featured a version of the Legion of Doom, composed of Eobard Thawne / Reverse- Flash, Malcolm Merlyn, Damien Darhk and Leonard Snart / Captain Cold. Casting Main cast members Victor Garber, Brandon Routh, Arthur Darvill, Caity Lotz, Franz Drameh, Amy Pemberton, and Dominic Purcell returned from the previous season as Martin Stein, Ray Palmer, Rip Hunter, Sara Lance, Jefferson Jackson, Gideon, and Mick Rory, respectively. They were joined by Matt Letscher, Maisie Richardson-Sellers and Nick Zano, playing Eobard Thawne, Amaya Jiwe, and Nate Heywood, respectively. Letscher reprised his role from The Flash. It was originally intended for Megalyn Echikunwoke, who voices Mari McCabe / Vixen in the animated web series Vixen, to reprise her role in this series, but due to scheduling conflicts for Echikunwoke, the producers instead cast Sellers as Jiwe, McCabe's grandmother and an earlier incarnation of Vixen. This incarnation was an original creation for the series. Darvill was absent for 5 episodes this season due to his commitment to the ITV series Broadchurch. Pemberton physically portrayed Gideon in the episode \\"Land of the Lost\\", unlike earlier episodes where she only voiced the character. Wentworth Miller, who portrayed Leonard Snart / Captain Cold as a regular in season one, signed a contract with Warner Bros. TV to continue portraying Snart simultaneously on multiple shows in the Arrowverse, including Legends of Tomorrow. John Barrowman and Katie Cassidy, who portrayed Malcolm Merlyn and Laurel Lance respectively on Arrow, signed a similar contract that allowed them to continue being a series regular on Arrow as well as the other Arrowverse shows, including The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow. Neal McDonough, who recurred as Damien Darhk on Arrow and made a guest appearance in season one of Legends of Tomorrow, returned to the series in a recurring capacity. Ciara Ren√©e and Falk Hentschel, who starred as Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl and Carter Hall / Hawkman respectively in the first season, did not return for the second, with Legends of Tomorrow co-creator Marc Guggenheim saying the writers could not find a suitable story for their characters set after the first season, adding, \\"The bow was tied so tightly and neatly with their story in the finale, that everything we thought of felt very forced. After 4000 years, they were no longer under the specter of Vandal [Savage], and we felt they need some time off.\\" He added that bringing the duo back at the very beginning of the second season felt \\"premature.\\" Filming Shooting for the season began in July 2016 at Vancouver, and ended in February 2017.  Arrowverse tie-ins  In November 2016, the cast of Legends of Tomorrow appeared on The Flash and Arrow as part of the three-part \\"Invasion!\\" crossover event; the crossover episodes also featured appearances by Melissa Benoist, reprising her role as Kara Danvers / Supergirl from the TV series Supergirl. Release Broadcast The season began airing on October 13, 2016, on The CW in the United States, and concluded on April 4, 2017. Home media The season was made available for streaming on Netflix in late April 2017, soon after the season finale aired. It was later released on Blu-ray on August 15, 2017. Reception Ratings Critical response Rotten Tomatoes gave the season an 88% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.97/10 based on 10 reviews. The website's consensus reads: \\"Though the narrative remains too ambitious, DC's Legends of Tomorrow enjoys a freer creative arc with the removal of problem characters.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN called it a significant improvement over the first season, saying it reduced \\"most of what didn't work about Season 1 and added several worthy new characters to the mix.\\" He noted that while the season was \\"crammed full of compelling character arcs and plot twists\\", it thrived simply by \\"offering a sense of whimsical adventure and comedy that be frustratingly hard to find in other live-action DC projects.\\" Accolades - ! scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=\\"4\\"  2017  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Leo Awards  Best Direction in a Dramatic Series  David Geddes   -  Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series  Armen V.

Clark served many years in local government, beginning in New Zealand when he was Town Clerk of South Dunedin and an alderman and mayor of St Kilda before coming to Sydney and was elected an Alderman of the City of Sydney, rising to become Lord Mayor for a single partial term from May to December 1912. Clarke also served a single term as Mayor of North Sydney (1922‚Äì1923), having served on both North Sydney Municipal Council and its predecessor the Borough of St Leonards. Early life and career George Thomas Clarke was born in Melbourne in the Colony of Victoria on 13 November 1853, the son of William Joseph Sayers Clarke and Mary Ann Welsford. His elder brother William Clarke became prominent in banking and rose to be Member of Parliament for Orange and Minister for Justice in the Government of the Colony of New South Wales. After receiving his education at Collins Street Grammar School, Clarke studied accountancy but owing to health issues decided to travel away from busy Melbourne, taking a sea voyage in 1875. Clarke went no further than Dunedin in the Colony of New Zealand and after accepting warehouse work there, soon established his own accountancy and real estate business. Political career In 1878 he was appointed Town Clerk of the Borough of South Dunedin, but later left office to become a Councillor. Clarke also served as a Councillor for the St Kilda Borough Council and was elected as mayor for two terms in 1878‚Äì1880. While in New Zealand, in 1876 Clarke joined the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, an interest in which he carried over when he returned to Australia, arriving in Sydney in the early 1880s. After setting up his business in the St Leonards region in northern Sydney, Clarke re-entered municipal politics when he was elected as an Alderman for Belmore Ward of the Borough of St Leonards in February 1888. As a member of the St Leonards council in 1890, Clarke was involved in the official representations to the colonial government to merge St Leonards with the neighbouring boroughs of East St Leonards and Victoria to form a single North Sydney borough. These representations were subsequently accepted and the Borough of North Sydney was proclaimed on 29 July 1890. As the proclamation continued the terms of office of the three elected councils, Clarke continued as an aldermen for the new borough. Clarke was not among those elected to the new six-member council elected in February 1891, but succeeded in returning by way of a vacancy in August 1891. He was elected an alderman of tho City of Sydney in 1904, and was elected Lord Mayor in 1912. Later life Survived by two sons, Clarke died while still serving as a North Sydney alderman on 11 March 1925 at his Wollstonecraft residence on Milner Crescent, \\"Domus\\", and was buried with Congregational and Masonic rites at Waverley Cemetery.

Biography  Originally from the region Rh√¥ne-Alpes, Paulet entered the Conservatoire de Paris, and obtained three first prizes for her mastery of the violin.  Career  For nearly ten years, in trios or with orchestras under the direction of Claudio Abbado, Bernard Haitink and Philippe Herreweghe, she performed as the first violin of Parisian Baroque ensembles such as Le Concert d'Astr√©e, Il Seminario Musicale and Les Talens Lyriques. Since November 2012, St√©phanie Paulet is the concert master of the Insula OrchestraInsula Orchestra conducted by Laurence Equilbey, a musical training specialized in the practice of historical instruments. The same year, the musician founded the ensemble \\"Aliquando\\".\\"Aliquando\\" She has previously been a member of various chamber ensembles, including the ensemble \\"Il Convito\\" alongside the musicians Maude Gratton and Claire Gratton, with whom she performed, notably in America. Paulet combines her creations with a historical reflection around the Baroque and classical musics repertoires. A first project V. de Velours ou la Le√ßon de Musique in partnership with the , was presented in Dardilly in June 2012. From theatre to classical music, the show explored the possible links between works for solo violin and the texts of Denis Diderot. The formation produced two recordings Amusements (2012) dedicated to the French composer Louis-Gabriel Guillemain and Minoritenkonvent (2015). For this second project, she joined the organist Elisabeth Geiger to give life to the manuscript XIV 726 still little explored by musicians. This set of 17th century sonatas was found in the Minorite Convent in Vienna In 2014, she was named a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres. In 2015, associated with the Japanese organist Yasuko Uyama- Bouvard, she proposed a reinterpretation of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's sonatas. Paulet is a violin teacher at the .

Physicians Outsourcing of emergency department physicians, as well as radiologists and anesthesiologists in operating rooms, grew rapidly in the United States in the 2000s due a combination of several economic forces, and medical staffing companies developed niche expertise in various medical specialties. Since 2008 a number of Swedish hospitals have used teleradiology services to outsource their emergency night-time radiology to Australia where daytime staff cover Swedish nighttime patients. Physician outsourcing has led to an increase in the number of people who received catastrophically large medical bills due to the outsourced physicians billing at out of network rates. A doctor in Tampa Bay claimed in 2015 that an emergency department she was staffing while working for a division of Envision Healthcare had chronically purchased the services of too few doctors, leading to excessive waiting times there. Nurses Some organizations have used outsourcing through nursing agencies or other medical staffing agencies to deal with the nursing shortage and as a way to save money. Management functions Some small practices have outsourced business functions to management services organizations. Hospitals and medical centers also outsource revenue cycle management functions and real estate management. Medical tourism People needing or wanting healthcare sometimes make decisions to seek care in a different jurisdiction; the decision may be based on lack of quality, availability, or legality in the person's home jurisdiction, or it may be a business decision based on the cost of acquiring the care. This form of medical outsourcing on the consumer side is generally called medical tourism.

Built in 1908 by George W. Burke, the bridges currently serve as part of a footpath within the park.  History  The idea for the construction of the two bridges came from George Burke, who was the Superintendent of City Parks for the Department of Public Works. Burke had no prior experience in architecture, engineering, building, or designing, but rather he was a horticulturist and city official.‚ÄúTributes Paid to Burke and Weible,‚Äù Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 6, 1926. Burke was a Pittsburgh native and entered into work with the City of Pittsburgh in 1890 as a park foreman. In 1903 the parks became a separate bureau of the Department of Public Works, and with that change Burke was hired as parks superintendent.Howard Stewart, introduction to Historical Data Pittsburgh Public Parks, Ann Arbor, MI: Edward Brothers, Inc., 1943.Frank C. Harper. Pittsburgh of Today: Its Resources and People, New York: The American Historical Society, Inc., 1932. From this position he was responsible for maintaining Phipps Conservatory and Schenley Park. Phipps Conservatory, which is also located in Schenley Park, was made possible through a gift from Henry Phipps Jr, and under Burke it became world famous for its flower shows.‚ÄúSuperintendent Burke Plans Many Improvements to Beautify City Pleasure Grounds Next Year,‚Äù Pittsburgh Daily Post, July 20, 1903. Up until his death, Burke made significant improvements to both Schenley Park and Phipps Conservatory, including the construction of the two tufa bridges. Burke chose the bridge locations in a dark and shady area of the park so as to make sure that moss and lichens would cover the stones in order to make the bridges a picturesque part of the Victorian-era style park.‚ÄúSup‚Äôt Burke Designs Picturesque Bridge in Schenley Park,‚Äù Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 24, 1908. Construction began in March 1908, and Burke oversaw the entire project.‚ÄúWorking on the Bridle Path.‚Äù The Pittsburgh Press, March 10, 1908. The bridges extended the bridle path across the hillsides and Nature Ravine, Phipps Run. The bridges were finished and opened up to the public in early 1909.‚ÄúMuch Work Planned in Pittsburgh Parks,‚Äù Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 7, 1908. The bridges continue to operate as part of the walking trails in Schenley Park, with only minor repairs needing to be made to replace and repair some tufa stones in 2010.‚ÄúRebuilding the Walls,‚Äù Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, February 3, 2010. The bridges were nominated in August 2017 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The bridges were designed by George Burke in the Rustic or Romantic Arch Bridge architectural style. What is most significant about the architecture of the bridges is the method of construction and materials used. The body of the bridge was made with reinforced concrete with steel rods. The concrete was poured into a frame with the tufa built up into a mold on the sides, and then after the concrete hardened to the tufa, the frame was removed. These tufa bridges are the only bridges in the world made in this style with tufa stones. The tufa stones themselves also give the bridge a unique look. The stone cladding on these bridges has overtime become unnaturally blackened. Geologists have speculated two different reasons for this. The first being that the coal dust that was abundant in Pittsburgh during the mid-twentieth century caused the darkening, and the second being that the darkening is a result of manganese oxidation.Wilbur Stout, ‚ÄúMarl, Tufa Rock, Travertine, and Bog Ore in Ohio,‚Äù Geological Survey of Ohio, Fourth Series Bulletin 41 (1940): 12. This darkening of the tufa stone makes the bridge visually unique, and the construction with tufa stones makes in architecturally unique.

Vietnamese numismatic charms (Vietnamese: B√πa Vi·ªát Nam; H√°n t·ª±: Ë∂äÂçóÁ¨¶Èä≠; Ch·ªØ N√¥m: Á¨¶Ë∂äÂçó), also known as Vietnamese amulets, Vietnamese talismans, or simply Vietnamese charms, refer to a family of cash coin-like and other numismatic inspired types of charms that like the Japanese and Korean variants are derived from Chinese numismatic charms (also referred to as Yansheng coins or huƒÅqi√°n), but have evolved around the customs of the Vietnamese culture although most of these charms resemble Vietnamese cash coins and the amulet coins of China.BLANCHARD Rapha√´l et BUI Van Quy, \\"Sur une collection d'amulettes chinoises\\", Revue d'Anthropologie, juillet-ao√ªt 1918, pp. 131-172. (in French) These \\"coins\\" were used at temples, as tokens within the imperial palace, and as everyday charms with supposed magical power such as having the ability to curse evil spirits and bogies. Some of these charms contained the inscriptions of real circulating cash coins but with added imagery. Inscriptions on Vietnamese numismatic charms can be written in Chinese, Taoist \\"magic\\" writing, Devanagari, pseudo-Devanagari, Ch·ªØ N√¥m, and Latin scripts. Common inscriptions include Tr∆∞·ªùng M·∫°ng Ph√∫ Qu√Ω (Èï∑ÂëΩÂØåË≤¥), Ch√≠nh ƒê·ª©c Th√¥ng B·∫£o (Ê≠£Âæ∑ÈÄöÂØ∂), and Ch√¢u Nguy√™n Th√¥ng B·∫£o (Âë®ÂÖÉÈÄöÂØ∂).  Types of Vietnamese charms   Buddhist charms  Like with Chinese numismatic Buddhist charms there are Vietnamese numismatic Buddhist charms that contain Sanskrit inscriptions, however some of these Buddhist amulets from Vietnam contain only Sanskrit syllables associated with certain sounds but without meaning, these meaningless inscriptions were presumably borrowed from Chinese monks who used them as religious iconography. = Vietnamese amulets with pseudo-Sanskrit inscriptions = There are Vietnamese amulets that contain the Buddhist prayer \\"Om mani padme hum\\" (‡•ê ‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø‡§™‡§¶‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å), or √Ån ma ni b√°t m√™ h·ªìng (ÂîµÂòõÂë¢Âè≠Âí™ÂêΩ), written in Devanagari script. This is chanting phrase used by Tibetan monks and has been adapted by other Buddhists in East Asia. In Buddhist schools of meditation the single syllable \\"Om\\" (‡•ê) in this prayer is used as a focal point to help quiet the mind. These six syllables are said to purify the six realms. Many of these amulets have their inscriptions written in Devanagari is because many of the oldest Buddhist texts were written in Sanskrit later and Pali and many Chinese Buddhist monks studied Sanskrit to better understand these texts. Furthermore, Buddhist monks in Vietnam study Chinese languages to help understand these same texts. Thus there is a fusion of knowledge of both the Sanskrit and the Chinese language which influenced these amulets to both contain a form of pseudo-Devanagari and Chinese script.  Open-work charms  During the 19th century, a two-sided open-work amulet with a two opposing dragons design within a circular frame. These open-work charms contain a number of Buddhist symbols and religious iconography such as the circular frame symbolising Wheel of Dharma (or Wheel of the Law), which encompasses all of the tenets of Buddhism. Another Buddhist symbol is an umbrella or canopy located on the top, as the umbrella in Buddhist symbolism is a sign of protection as it \\"shades all medicinal herbs\\", while the shade of the canopy is said to \\"protects all living beings\\". The design of two dragons are a part of Chinese folk religion, but like in contemporary Chinese and Vietnamese life, indigenous mythology mixed with Buddhism as can be demonstrated in several Buddhist charms which incorporate designs from other religions.  V·∫°n Th·ªç Th√¥ng B·∫£o  During the 60th birthday of Revival L√™ dynasty Emperor L√™ Hi·ªÉn T√¥ng in 1774 a special V·∫°n Th·ªç Th√¥ng B·∫£o (Ëê¨Â§ÄÈÄöÂØ∂) amulet was cast, these charms were often used to commemorate the birthday of an emperor as had happened in the Qing dynasty with the 60th birthdays of Chinese emperors. The reason these charms are cast on this particular event is because 60 years symbolises a complete cycle of the 10 heavenly stems and the 12 earthly branches. Albert Schroeder, Annam, √âtudes numismatiques, n¬∞589. (in French)  The Book of Changes and Bagua charms (Eight Trigram charms)  Vietnamese Book of Changes and Bagua charms usually contain inscriptions displaying the Eight Trigrams (ÂÖ´Âç¶, B√°t Qu√°i), these are the following Chinese characters: ‰πæ, (‚ò∞, C√†n) Âùé, (‚òµ, Kh·∫£m), ËâÆ (‚ò∂, C·∫•n), Èúá (‚ò≥, Ch·∫•n), Â∑Ω (‚ò¥, T·ªën), Èõ¢ (‚ò≤, Ly), Âù§ (‚ò∑, Kh√¥n), and ÂÖë (‚ò±, ƒêo√†i). In the case of these coins, \\"charm\\" in this context is a catchall term for coin-shaped items which were not official (or counterfeit) money. However, these numismatic objects were not all necessarily considered \\"magical\\" or \\"lucky\\", as some of these Chinese numismatic charms can be used as \\"mnemonic coins\\". These amulets may further have inscriptions like Tr∆∞·ªùng Sinh B·∫£o M·∫°ng (Èï∑Áîü‰øùÂëΩ) which translates to \\"immortality\\" and \\"protect life\\". Such inscriptions would indicate that they were used as \\"protective\\" charms.  Zodiac charms  The Chinese zodiacs appear on several Daoist amulets which were used for divination and fortune telling. Next to the image of each animal, the Chinese character for the animal is displayed.  Confucian charms  Under the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty era Emperor Minh M·∫°ng large (often 48 millimeters in diameter) presentation coins with the inscription Minh M·∫°ng Th√¥ng B·∫£o (ÊòéÂëΩÈÄöÂØ∂) were made that featured inscriptions from the Huainanzi on their reverse, it is believed that this work was chosen because it states that a monarch or ruler should embrace both Confucianism and Taoism and attain sagehood. Because the term Minh M·∫°ng (H√°n t·ª±: ÊòéÂëΩ) can also be translated as \\"bright life\\" or \\"intelligent decree\\" the inscription Minh M·∫°ng Th√¥ng B·∫£o is commonly used on Vietnamese numismatic charms.  Lei Ting curse charms  Vietnamese Lei Ting curse charms (or L√¥i ƒê√¨nh curse charms) are numismatic charms that contain inscriptions to protect its wearer from evil spirits and ghosts. It was common for people to go to Taoist masters to ask for advice, and in Taoism secretive amulets are often used in ceremonies, while most of these amulets are made from paper. Vietnamese Lei Ting curse charms can have fortune telling symbols and Taoist \\"magical\\" incantations.  Vietnamese numismatic charms with cash coin inscriptions  During the Vietnam war era Vietnamese numismatic charms with cash coin inscriptions were produced in large numbers as souvenirs for foreigners interested in antiques. In large South Vietnamsee cities like Saigon, Da Nang, and Hu·∫ø, these charms usually sold for $1 or $2. They bore inscriptions of authentic Vietnamese cash coins like Quang Trung Th√¥ng B·∫£o (ÂÖâ‰∏≠ÈÄöÂØ∂), Gia Long Th√¥ng B·∫£o (ÂòâÈöÜÈÄöÂØ∂), and Minh M·∫°ng Th√¥ng B·∫£o (ÊòéÂëΩÈÄöÂØ∂), but many also contained fantasy inscriptions like Quang Trung Tr·ªçng B·∫£o (ÂÖâ‰∏≠ÈáçÂØ∂), H√†m Nghi Tr·ªçng B·∫£o (Âí∏ÂÆúÈáçÂØ∂), and Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh Tr·ªçng B·∫£o (ÂïìÂÆöÈáçÂØ∂), the latter of which being based on the Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh Th√¥ng B·∫£o (ÂïìÂÆöÈÄöÂØ∂). Some Vietnam war era replicas may include H√†m Nghi Th√¥ng B·∫£o (Âí∏ÂÆúÈÄöÂØ∂) cash coins, which were produced under Emperor H√†m Nghi in the year 1885, without the reverse inscription \\"L·ª•c VƒÉn\\" (ÂÖ≠Êñá), or large (1 m·∫°ch) Duy T√¢n Th√¥ng B·∫£o (Á∂≠Êñ∞ÈÄöÂØ∂) cash coins with the reverse inscription Trung Qu·ªëc √Åi D√¢n (Âø†ÂúãÊÑõÊ∞ë). The latter of these fakes are based on Minh M·∫°ng Th√¥ng B·∫£o Th√¥ng B·∫£o (ÊòéÂëΩÈÄöÂØ∂), Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã Th√¥ng B·∫£o (Á¥πÊ≤ªÈÄöÂØ∂), and T·ª± ƒê·ª©c Th√¥ng B·∫£o (Âó£Âæ∑ÈÄöÂØ∂) cash coins of 1 m·∫°ch which had this and similar reverse inscriptions, while in reality no similar large cash coins were ever produced before or after these three series.  Marriage charms  Vietnamese marriage amulets often display dragon (Èæç) and phoenix (È≥≥) motifs, this is because the Vietnamese dragon is often used as a symbol for males, while the Ph∆∞·ª£ng Ho√†ng (or \\"phoenix\\") is used to represent females. When the phoenix is shown together with the dragon this is often meant as a metaphor for the Emperor and Empress. Some marriage amulets have the obverse inscription Tr∆∞·ªùng M·∫°ng Ph√∫ Qu√Ω (Èï∑ÂëΩÂØåË≤¥) written in seal script, which translates into English to \\"Long life, riches, and honour\\". This inscription symbolises good fortune in marriage as well as protection. There are also some Vietnamese marriage amulets with the inscription Th·ªç S∆°n Ph√∫c H·∫£i (Â£ΩÂ±±Á¶èÊµ∑, \\"longevity, mountain, happiness, and sea\\"), which is a part of a Chinese congratulatory phrase \\"May your age be as Mount Tai and your happiness as the Eastern Sea\\" (Â£ΩÊØîÂçóÂ±±Á¶èÂ¶ÇÊù±Êµ∑). Some Vietnamese marriage amulets contain the Daoist √Çm and D∆∞∆°ng symbol (or Th√°i c·ª±c ƒë·ªì), this is because in Daoist √Çm symbolises the feminine and D∆∞∆°ng symbolises the masculine. Further symbols may include the lotus flower, known as \\"Ëç∑\\" (H√†) or \\"ËìÆ\\" (Sen). In Mandarin Chinese the word for \\"lotus\\" has a homonymous sound with the word which means \\"to bind\\" as in a marriage contract, \\"to love\\", and \\"to be modest\\". A design of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese marriage amulets display a pair of fish on one side and the inscription Ng∆∞ Song (È≠öÂèå, \\"Pair of Fish\\") on the other side. In various Oriental cultures fish are associated with plenty and abundance. Fish are furthermore noted for their prolific ability to reproduce and that when they swim that this was in joy and are therefore associated with a happy and harmonious marriage. In Feng Shui, a pair of fish are associated with conjugal bliss and the joys of being in a matrimonial union. \\"Song of Unending Sorrow\\" charms, or \\"Song of Unending Regret\\" charms, are a common type of marriage coin charm, that might be Chinese, Japanese, Korean Taiwanese, or Vietnamese in origin, that depict part of the 9th century poem Chang hen ge written by Bai Juyi. \\"Song of Unending Sorrow\\" charms display four heterosexual couples having sex in various positions (or they are supposed to represent one couple having in four different positions) in the area surrounding the square centre hole of the coin. Surrounding the couples having sex are the Chinese characters representing the spring (Êò•), wind (È¢®), peaches (Ê°É), and plums (Êùé), which is a reference to the first four characters of a line from the Chang hen ge poem which translates into English as \\"Gone were the breezy spring days when the peach and plum trees were in bloom\\" in reference to the death of Yang Guifei.  Five poisons talismans  The five poisons (‰∫îÊØí, Ng≈© ƒê·ªôc), or the five noxious creatures, are an ancient Chinese concept that includes a snake, a centipede, a scorpion, a lizard, and a toad. Sometimes the five poisons may also include a spider. These numismatic amulets are a reflection of the taboo of the number 5. Traditionally the fifth day of the fifth month (which in the Chinese calendar falls in June), or \\"Double Five Day\\", is considered in traditional Chinese culture to be the day that causes the most illnesses because it's the hottest day. Because of this superstition the number five was also associated with illness. During \\"Double Five Day\\" these amulets displaying the five poisons were worn to ward off illnesses and evil. Because the Dragon Boat Festival occurs during this period, it is not uncommon for one of the five poisons to be replaced with a tiger representing the Warring States period person Khu·∫•t Nguy√™n. Some Five Poisons amulets contain the imperative command inscription Khu T√† T√Æch √Åc (È©ÖÈÇ™ËæüÊÉ°) which could be translated as \\"Expel Demons and Wicked Sovereigns\\".  Vietnamese gong (kh√°nh) shaped amulets  Vietnam has been producing large brass gongs (kh√°nh) shaped as bats for centuries, some Vietnamese amulets are modelled after this shape. While these amulets may also be found in China, they are produced in Vietnam and are one of the few uniquely categories of Vietnamese numismatic charms. These amulets are associated with wealth and good luck because of their shape bat shape, which is a homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese, as the Mandarin Chinese word for \\"bat\\" (Ëù†, f√∫) sounds like \\"happiness\\" (Á¶è, f√∫). The design of the bat shaped kh√°nh also appears on a 1943 series 20 piastre banknote issued by the Bank of Indochina.  Plastic numismatic charms  During the 20th and 21st centuries Vietnamese numismatic charms with Latin script made from plastics began being produced. The obverse inscription that appears on some of these amulets is \\"Th·∫ßn Ch√∫ng Cho Ban\\" which translates to \\"May the Spirits Bestow Favours\\". While the reverse of these plastic amulets reads \\"Sa C·ªëc Mi·∫øu √Çn\\" which translates to \\"The Temple Sounds Thanks\\", which could be a reference to when a monk receives a donation at a temple, they will often ring a bell in recognition of this fact.

She has won the Naoki Prize, the Oda Sakunosuke Prize, and the Japan Booksellers' Award. Her work has been adapted for film and television, and her books have been translated into Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, English, German and Italian.  Early life and education  Miura was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1976. While attending university she planned to become an editor, but she was signed by a literary agent and started her writing career. She graduated from Waseda University.  Career  A year after graduating from Waseda, Miura published her first novel, Kakuto suru mono ni maru (A Passing Grade for Those Who Fight). She won the 135th Naoki Prize in 2006 for her book Mahoro ekimae Tada benriken. The novel and its sequels have been adapted into a series of movies by Tatsushi ≈åmori, a TV Tokyo television show, and a manga series. Her novel Kaze ga tsuyoku fuiteiru (Run with the Wind), about 2 former elite runners who inspire each other to take up running again, was published in 2006 and later adapted into a 2009 live-action film and a 2018 NTV animated series. In 2008 her novel Hikari (Light), a story about rape, murder, and consequences over time, was published. Hikari was adapted into a 2017 suspense film directed by Tatsushi ≈åmori. Miura's novel Fune wo amu (Compiling the Boat), about a 15 year effort to create a new dictionary called The Great Passage, was published by Kobunsha in 2011. In 2012 Fune wo amu won the Japan Booksellers' Award. A 2013 film adaptation of Fune wo amu, directed by Yuya Ishii, won several Japan Academy Prizes, including Best Picture. In 2016 Fuji TV adapted the novel into an anime series, also called Fune wo amu. An English version of Fune wo amu, translated by Julia Winters Carpenter, was published in 2017 under the title The Great Passage. Kris Kosaka of The Japan Times described The Great Passage as \\"stylistically adept, with the shift in narratives smoothly connecting as characters‚Äô stories overlap through time and space.\\" In 2015 Miura's novel Ano ie ni kurasu yonin no onna, a story that loosely follows the setting and themes of Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki's work The Makioka Sisters, won the 32nd Oda Sakunosuke Prize. Miura has cited Kenji Maruyama and Hideo Nakai as favorite authors. She is a fan of yaoi manga, and a collection of her essays on yaoi was published under the title Shumi ja nainda (It's Not Just a Hobby) in 2006.

It has a single greenish brown leaf with a reddish base and up to five brownish green flowers with red striations and a labellum with a brownish purple \\"beard\\". Description Calochilus sandrae is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single greenish brown, linear to lance- shaped leaf long and wide with a reddish base. The leaf is fully developed at flowering time. Up to five brownish green flowers with red striations, long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. Individual flowers last for between two and five days. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are a similar length but narrower and spread apart from each other. The petals are long, wide, asymmetrically egg-shaped with a small hooked tip. The labellum is flat, long, wide, with short, thick purple calli near its base. The central part of the labellum is covered with purple hairs up to long and there is a glandular tip which is long. The column has two yellowish \\"eyes\\" joined by a purplish ridge. Flowering occurs from December to January. Taxonomy and naming Calochilus sandrae was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen he collected near Nimmitabel and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (sandrae) honours Sandra Raelene Jones who discovered the species. Distribution and habitat The brownish beard orchid grows in shrubby montane forest between Nimmitabel and the Wadbilliga National Park in New South Wales and in the Namadgi National Park in the Australian Capital Territory.

The school occupied space in the then-named Innovate Washington Building, originally the SIRTI Building, and remained there for one year, before outgrowing the space and relocating to its current location within school district's attendance boundaries in the fall of 2013. On May 7, 2019, the Mead School Board approved $11.3 million in budget cuts resulting in a temporary two-year suspension of Riverpoint Academy.

He required NBC shows to include at least one sophisticated cultural reference or performance per installment -- including a segment of a Verdi opera adapted to the comic style of Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca's groundbreaking Your Show of Shows. - Robert E. Kintner 1958‚Äì1966 His NBC tenure was marked by his aggressive effort to push NBC News past CBS News in rankings and prestige. The news department was given more money, leading to notable coverage of the 1960 Presidential election campaign, and the prominence of The Huntley-Brinkley Report. - Julian Goodman 1966‚Äì1974 Goodman helped establish Chet Huntley and David Brinkley as a well-known news team and led the network from 1966 to 1974. While working for NBC, he negotiated a $1 million deal to retain Johnny Carson as host of The Tonight Show. - Herb Schlosser 1974‚Äì1978 In 1974, under new president Herb Schlosser, the network tried to attract younger viewers with a series of costly movies, miniseries and specials. This failed to attract the desirable 18‚Äì34 demographic, and simultaneously alienated older viewers. None of the new prime-time shows that NBC introduced in the fall of 1975 earned a second season renewal, all failing in the face of established competition. The network's lone breakout success that season was the groundbreaking late-night comedy/variety show, NBC's Saturday Night ‚Äì which would be renamed Saturday Night Live in 1976, after the cancellation of a Howard Cosell-hosted program of the same title on ABC ‚Äì which replaced reruns of The Tonight Show that previously aired in its Saturday time slot. - Fred Silverman 1978‚Äì1981 His three-year tenure at the network proved to be a difficult period, marked by several high-profile failures such as the sitcom Hello, Larry, the variety shows The Big Show and Pink Lady, the drama Supertrain, and the Jean Doumanian era of Saturday Night Live. (Silverman hired Doumanian after Al Franken, the planned successor for outgoing Lorne Michaels, castigated Silverman's failures on-air in a way that Silverman took very personally.Shales, Tom (2003). Live From New York, p. 191. Back Bay Books.) Despite these failures, there were high points in Silverman's tenure at NBC, including the launch of the critically lauded Hill Street Blues (1981), the epic mini-series Sh≈çgun, and The David Letterman Show (daytime, 1980), which would lead to Letterman's successful late night program in 1982. Silverman had Letterman in a holding deal after the morning show which kept the unemployed Letterman from going to another network. However, Silverman nearly lost his then-current late night host, market leader Johnny Carson, after Carson sued NBC in a contract dispute; the case was settled out of court and Carson remained with NBC in exchange for the rights to his show and a reduction in time on air. Silverman also developed successful comedies such as Diff'rent Strokes, The Facts of Life and Gimme a Break!, and made the series commitments that led to Cheers and St. Elsewhere. Silverman also pioneered entertainment reality programming with the 1979 launch of Real People. His contributions to the network's game show output included Goodson-Todman's Card Sharks and a revival of Password, both of which enjoyed great success in the morning schedule, although he also canceled several other relatively popular series, including The Hollywood Squares and High Rollers, to make way for The David Letterman Show (those cancellations also threatened Wheel of Fortune, whose host, Chuck Woolery, departed the show in a payment dispute during Silverman's tenure, although the show survived). Silverman also oversaw the hiring of Pat Sajak as the new host of Wheel of Fortune, a position Sajak holds to this day, although Silverman himself objected to Sajak's hiring.Griffin, Merv. Merv: Making the Good Life Last. New York: Pocket Books, 2003, page 101 On Saturday mornings, in a time when most of the cartoon output of the three networks was similar, Silverman oversaw the development of an animated series based on The Smurfs; the animated series The Smurfs ran from 1981 to 1989, well after Silverman's departure, making it one of his longest-lasting contributions to the network. He also oversaw a revival of The Flintstones. In other areas of NBC, Silverman revitalized the news division, which resulted in Today and NBC Nightly News achieving parity with their competition for the first time in years. - Brandon Tartikoff 1981‚Äì1991 He was credited with turning around NBC's low prime time reputation with such hit series as Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law, Law & Order, ALF, Family Ties, The Cosby Show, Cheers, Seinfeld, The Golden Girls, Wings, Miami Vice, Knight Rider, The A-Team, Saved by the Bell, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , St. Elsewhere, and Night Court. Tartikoff also helped develop the 1984 sitcom Punky Brewster; he named the title character after a girl he had a crush on in school. - Warren Littlefield 1991-1998 During his time as president of NBC, Littlefield oversaw the creation of many shows for the network throughout the 1990s such as Seinfeld, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Wings, Blossom, Law & Order, Mad About You, Sisters, Frasier, Friends, ER, Homicide: Life on the Street, Caroline in the City, NewsRadio, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Suddenly Susan, Just Shoot Me!, Will & Grace and The West Wing. - Scott Sassa 1998-1999 During this time, he oversaw the development and production of NBC's new primetime series, including such shows as The West Wing, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Fear Factor. Under Sassa, NBC was the number-one network 3 out of 4 seasons. - Garth Ancier 1999‚Äì2000 Beginning in May 1999, Ancier served as President of NBC Entertainment, where he helped put The West Wing and Law & Order: SVU on the air, while conversely being the one who cancelled the 1999 teen drama-comedy series Freaks and Geeks (a move he has since expressed regret over). Ancier was forced out from NBC in November 1999. - Jeff Zucker 2000‚Äì2004 He kept the network ahead of the pack by airing the gross out show Fear Factor, negotiating for the cast of the hit series Friends to take the series up to a tenth season, and signing Donald Trump for the reality show The Apprentice. He is credited with the idea to extend Friends episodes by 10 minutes, and convinced the cast to extend their contracts by two years. The Friends era was one of the most profitable ever for NBC. The Zucker era produced a spike in operating earnings for NBC, from $532 million the year he took over to $870 million in 2003.\\" Zucker introduced Las Vegas, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, and Scrubs. He originated the idea of airing \\"Supersized\\" (longer than the standard 30 minute slot) episodes of NBC's comedies and aggressively programming in the summer months as cable networks began to draw away viewers with original programming from the network's rerun-filled summer slate. - Kevin Reilly 2004-2007 Despite NBC's poor performance, Reilly oversaw the development of some of the network's most enduring shows that helped to define the network. His vocal support of The Office helped it survive its low-rated first season. Reilly has been credited with developing shows such as My Name Is Earl, Heroes, 30 Rock, and Friday Night Lights. - Ben Silverman 2007‚Äì2009 He is credited for his role in saving the critically acclaimed but low-rated NBC drama Friday Night Lights by striking an innovative deal with DirecTV.\\"Ben Silverman, 'Friday Night Lights' Savior: Saved Show By 'Yelling At A Lot Of People'\\" The satellite television provider agreed to take on a substantial amount of the show's production budget in exchange for exclusive first-window airing rights on its 101 channel. NBC would then repurpose the episodes to be aired on the network later in the season.\\"'Friday Night Lights' Gets 26-Episode Order From DirecTV, NBC\\" - Jeff Gaspin 2009‚Äì2010 Some of the businesses he is responsible for are NBC Entertainment (home to hits such as The Office, 30 Rock, and The Tonight Show), cable channels USA Network and Bravo, and NBC Universal Domestic Television Distribution which distributes such shows as The Martha Stewart Show and The Jerry Springer Show. - Robert Greenblatt 2011‚Äì2018 He succeeded Jeff Gaspin in January 2011 after Comcast took control of the newly renamed NBCUniversal. Prior to his exit, he optioned a sixth season revival of Brooklyn Nine-Nine after its cancellation by Fox that year, expressing regret for passing on the series. - George Cheeks and Paul Telegdy 2018‚Äì2019 George Cheeks and Paul Telegdy were named Co-Chairmen of NBC Entertainment after Robert Greenblatt left NBC. - Paul Telegdy 2019‚Äì2020 In October 2019, George Cheeks was named Vice Chairman of NBC Content Studios. Paul Telegdy became the sole chairman of NBC Entertainment. - Frances Berwick 2020‚Äìpresent  } References ","title":"List of presidents of NBC Entertainment"},{"id":"57839425","text":"Moazzam Jahanzeb Ahmad Khan Wattoo is a Pakistani politician who was a Member of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, from 1997 to 1999.

She was a provincial Secretary for Sports and Youth in the government of Vojvodina from 2012 to 2016 and has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2016. Elected as a member of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina (LSV), she subsequently joined the New Party and then switched to the new-formed Party of Freedom and Justice in 2019. Early life and career Marinika ƒåobanu was born in an ethnic Romanian family in 1974 in Panƒçevo, Vojvodina, then part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. She graduated English and Romanian languages from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology in 1995 and, in the same year, began teaching elementary school English in Panƒçevo. She was a professional journalist from 1997 to 2009, writing and reporting for Radio 021, Danas, and the Romanian language publication Libertatea, along with other outlets. Tepiƒá is also a veteran human rights and minority rights campaigner and has served as the deputy director for the National Council for the Decentralization of the Republic of Serbia.MARINIKA TEPIƒÜ, Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 5 July 2018.

During this period, half of the Vojvodina assembly's 120 seats were determined by proportional representation and the other half by election in single-member constituencies.

In 2013, Tepiƒá oversaw the introduction of the first sex education classes in the province, following a ten-month consultation process. She noted that ninety-five per cent of parents surveyed by the Secretariat had approved of the initiative and argued that the program was unlikely to face a strong degree of opposition, as had a similar initiative in neighbouring Croatia.Colin Graham, \\"Sex Education - Sex education comes to Balkans,\\" Times Educational Supplement, 20 August 2013, p. 8. This notwithstanding, some educational material released through the initiative provoked a backlash from socially conservative groups; the Democratic Party of Serbia, which held four seats in the assembly, argued that one publication \\"promoted homosexuality\\" and that Tepiƒá should resign as secretary. She defended the material and remained in her position.\\"ƒåobanu: Ud≈æbenik ne promovi≈°e homoseksualnost\\", Blic (Source: www.021.rs), 8 October 2013, accessed 5 July 2018.

Designed as a lifting body, it was based on an earlier 1917 delta-winged patent. It underwent flight testing but the design was not developed further. Origin Roy Scroggs was a tailor living in Eugene, Oregon, US. He sought to develop an airplane that would bring safety, economy and STOL performance to everyday flying, and patented his first low- aspect-ratio delta design in 1917.US patent 1,250,033. His unconventional ideas were rejected by aeronautical experts and he received much ridicule for his persistence. When he finally built a full-size machine in 1929, his chosen name, The Last Laugh, reflected his faith in his invention.Eugene Guard, 1929. Design Shaped like a long, narrow delta with the nose cut off, the aircraft was conceived as a lifting body, having a deep trapezoidal kite- section fuselage which tapered in proportion to the high-mounted, low aspect ratio wing. The fuselage thus formed a deep keel which provided both lift and directional stability. The original delta-winged design of 1917 proved impractical and the nose had to be drastically cut back to provide adequate mounting for an engine and propeller.US Patent 1,848,578. The structure was primarily of welded metal tubing with fabric covering. Twin main undercarriage wheels were located on struts immediately behind the engine, lifting the forward fuselage well clear of the ground. With the wings level the rear fuselage almost reached the ground and was fitted with a small tailskid. The aircraft was powered by a 90 hp Curtiss OX-5 engine driving a two-bladed propeller.Photo GN4700, Lane County History Museum, US. (Retrieved 6 July 2018) The enclosed cockpit was located well aft in the wider part of the fuselage and initially had only two small side windows for vision. These were much increased in size before flight testing began. Aft of it the fuselage tapered more sharply to an angular tail with no separate fin. A split rudder was fitted for lateral control, with each half attached to the fuselage at its widest and deepest point. Elevon control surfaces were also fitted on the wing trailing edge. Modifications during flight testing included the addition of twin rudder surfaces, mounted aft of the fuselage on short struts. Career The Last Laugh was registered in the US as NC10648.Scroggs, FAA Registry. It is claimed to have risen to about 10 ft (3 m) in flight. Following initial flight tests he filed for a new patent on its design in July 1930. The machine was damaged during attempted flight trials at Eugene Municipal Airport when it missed the taxiway and tipped over.\\"Well, no, it didn't get off the ground\\", The Register-Guard, 8 May 2001, p.2D. Its registration was cancelled in 1934.Number 10648, FAA Registry.

It was dissolved following the Romanian Revolution in 1989 and retained its current form through the Romanian Armed Forces. It consisted of the People's Ground Forces, the People's Navy and the People's Air Force. History In 1944 the Red Army invaded Romania in the Jassy-Kishinev Offensive, causing the overthrow of Ion Antonescu's regime via a coup. In 1945, new military regulations were developed based on those of the Red ArmyOroian, p. 37 and in 1946, Romania came completely under the influence of the Soviet Union and became part of the Eastern Bloc. The military regulations were finalized in 1949. Like all other socialist states, the People's Army was subjected to the rule of the Romanian Communist Party, whose general secretary was, since 1974, President of the Republic in addition to his role as commander-in-chief of the army. During the tenure of General Emil BodnƒÉra»ô as defence minister, the People's Army went through a period of Sovietization, with BodnƒÉra»ô personally sending several Romanian Communists to Moscow to be trained in Soviet military institutions such as the Frunze Military Academy.Oroian; Vankovska, Wiberg, p. 115; Final Report, p. 125Pacepa, p. 357-358 30% of the experienced officers corps were purged from the military due to fears of opposition and monarchist loyalties.\\"Development of the Romanian Armed Forces after World War II\\" , from the Library of Congress Country Studies and the CIA World Factbook. Between 1949 and 1952, over 700 Romanian military personnel were being trained in the USSR, a number that would drop by over 200 by in the next 6 years.Oroian, p. 40-41 They also adopted a Soviet-style full dress uniform and everyday uniform. In the early days of the People's Republic, the Soviet Armed Forces had troops stationed in the country. The Soviet presence came as a result of the Soviet occupation of Romania. BodnƒÉra»ô was seen to have influence in Nikita Khrushchev's decision to withdraw Soviet troops in 1958.ArachelianFinal Report, p. 43 n. 32, p. 205Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev, Sergeƒ≠ Khrushchev. Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev: Statesman, 1953‚Äì1964, Pennsylvania State University Press, 2007, page 706, From May 1955 to 1991, Romania was a member of the Warsaw Pact, which provided the Romanian People's Army with weapons and other Soviet-made equipment, as well as assistance in building up its own defense industry. Under the presidency of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, the RPA asserted functional independence in the defense industry and on equipment acquisitions while maintaining strong ties to the Warsaw Pact Command, with many of its armored vehicles, aircraft and artillery, as well as individual weaponry, being nationally produced. Also, a new set of enlisted and NCO ranks were adopted in the 1970s, alongside the reinstatement of the senior NCO ranks (maistru militar), which replaced the former Soviet rank model for such personnel. On 12 March 1958, the Sports Committee of Friendly Armies was created, with the Romanian People's Army became a founding member. In November 1986, a referendum was held by the government in which voters, when asked whether they approved of reducing the size of the army and cutting military spending by 5%, approved the proposals by 100%, with not a single vote counting against it.Rum√§nien, 23. November 1986 : Verkleinerung des Heeres, Senkung der R√ºstungsausgaben um 5% Direct Democracy The People's Army would be dissolved in 1989 following the Romanian Revolution, during which officers and personnel of the military defected to the side of the oppposition after a public speech by Ceau»ôescu broadcast on state television and a firing squad provided by paratroop regiment personnel Captain Ionel Boeru, Sergeant-Major Georghin Octavian and Dorin-Marian C√Ærlan took part in the Trial and execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceau»ôescu on 26 December. Its replacement would come in the form of the Romanian Armed Forces. Political and military leadership Supreme Commander-in-Chief The title of Supreme Commander-in-Chief was held by the de facto leader of the nation, General Secretary, despite the fact that the President of the State Council was the de jure head of state until 1974, when it was replaced by the President of Romania. Minister of National Defence The office of Minister of National Defence () is the chief political leader of the military. Before that, it was the Minister of War () who handled military affairs in the government. The country's defense policy was managed by the agency the minister headed, the Ministry of the National Defense, led by a professional officer with the rank of Colonel general or above. The minister was a permanent member of the Politburo of the PCR. Chief of the General Staff SƒÉlƒÉjan on May Day in 1953. SƒÉlƒÉjan served as the second Chief of the General Staff and the second Minister of National Defence Components As of 1985, the People's Army was organized into the following service branches:–ê—Ä–º–∏—è –°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –†—É–º—ã–Ω–∏–∏ // –ù–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–µ –º–∏—Ä–∞ –∏ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏–∑–º–∞ / —Å–æ—Å—Ç. –í. –°. –®–∫–∞—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π. –ú., \\"–ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞\\", 1985. —Å—Ç—Ä. 110-119 * People's Ground Forces (For»õele Terestre ale Poporului) * People's Air Forces (For»õele Aeriene ale Poporului) * People's Navy (Marina Poporului) Several other branches were not part of the Ministry of National Defense but were directly controlled by the Romanian People's Army or the PCR: * Patriotic Guards (GƒÉrzile Patriotice) * Security Troops (Trupele de securitate) * Border Troops (Trupele de frontierƒÉ) A distinctive feature of the system of manning the RAF armed forces was the continued possibility of conscription of women for military service (although the bulk of the female military personnel serving at that time were doctors, nurses, and radio communications operators). The People's Army active personnel amounted to the following numbers:Assembly of Captive European Nations, First Session, pp. 65-67 {  align=right style=\\"margin-left:10px;\\" ! Branch !

Succeeded by army corps in the 60s, they were areas that in wartime would become an army corps with their headquarters acting as areas of responsibility. Ground Forces A graphic of the structure of a Romanian People's Ground Forces Motor Rifle Division. The senior most units in the ground forces was the Tudor Vladimirescu Division and the Horia, Clo»ôca »ôi Cri»ôan Division, both of which were used as politicical tools by communist leaders. They were composed of former prisoners of war, Soviet trainees and Communist activists such as Valter Roman.Mihailov In 1980, the Romanian Ground Forces was reorganized in 4 Army Commands:'Romanian Army during the Cold War' via *1st Army Command (Bucharest) *2nd Army Command (Buzau) *3rd Army Command (Craiova) *4th Army Command (Cluj-Napoca) All four Army Commands consisted of 8 Mechanized Infantry Divisions, 2 Armoured Divisions and 1 Armoured Brigade, as well as 4 Mountain infantry Brigades as specialized motorized infantry units, in addition to an administrative division of 4 parachute infantry regiments. Between 1960 and 1964, the rifle/mechanized divisions were converted to mechanized infantry (motorized rifle) divisions, which resulted in reductions in size due to it being a merger of both types of units. The newly established mechanized infantry divisions were structured similarly to the Soviet ones, organized into a division HQ, three mechanized infantry regiments, a tank regiment, a field artillery regiment, as well as in battalion-size subunits of other specialities, while the armoured divisions were structured in three tank regiments, a mechanized infantry regiment, a field artillery regiment and a number of other battalion-size subunits of other specialities. The degree of mechanization of the infantry was not complete, unlike the other member states of the Warsaw Treaty, for in 1985 only two of the three infantry battalions from the composition of the mechanized regiments were equipped with wheeled armoured personnel carriers TAB-71 and TAB-77. Even though since 1985 the infantry regiments began receiving new amphibious tracked infantry fighting vehicle MLI-84 the mechanization of the whole infantry had not succeed until 1989. Disbanded by the Soviets in the early years of occupied and post-war Romania, the V√¢nƒÉtori de munte (Mountain Huntsmen) was reestablished in 1958, being the equivalent of the Soviet 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division or the American 10th Mountain Division. It was considered the Ground Forces' best-trained unit due to its equipment consisting of MLVM APCs and 76mm. mountain guns, and was organized into 4 brigades stationed in the mountainous areas. The Special Counter-terrorism Unit (Unitatea SpecialƒÉ de LuptƒÉ AntiteroristƒÉ, USLA) was a key part of the Ground Forces security aspect, preventing terrorist attacks such as a May 1985 attempt by two Arab terrorists to bomb cars belonging to Syrian students the GrozƒÉve≈üti Campus parking lot. Navy The Naval Building in Constan»õa served as the headquarters for the People's Navy. In the early postwar years, the Romanian Navy was deprived of its merchant fleet due to the rapid takeover of the Romanian vessels by the Soviet Navy. In September 1944, the Soviet Navy transferred all Romanian warships to ports in the Caucasus near Azerbaijan and Georgia, all of which were not returned until just over a year later, with the exception o the Regele Ferdinand-class that was kept by the Black Sea Fleet until the early 1950s.Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World Fighting Ships 1922‚Äì1946, p. 361 A number of warships such as Amiral Murgescu were never returned and stayed in Soviet service until they were decommissioned. Once in possession of patrol ships, the Romanian People's Navy formed Danube Squadron, which later changed its name to the River Brigade in 1959. As a result of the 1940s reform of the naval forces, a patrol squadron was converted into an independent unit, which operated under the Naval Headquarters until May 1951. Four years later, naval ships and Marine units were subordinated to the headquarters. In 1962, the 42nd Maritime Division was founded, continuing the traditions of the Sea Division, a large unit was had ceased to carry out functions since the end of World War II. In the late 70s and early 80s, several naval ships were built in the Romanian shipyards, specifically the Midia and Constanta escort ships from Braila shipyard.https://www.roec.biz/project/romanias-naval-forces-at- crossroads/ In the early 1980s, the People's Navy ramped up efforts to develop its own domestic naval industry by building new patrol boats using Chinese and Soviet technology and designs. In 1989 the Romanian Navy had more than 7,500 sailors, all of whom were organized into the Black Sea Fleet, the Danube Squadron, and the Coastal Defense. Its major naval bases and shipyards were the ports of Mangalia and Constant on the Black Sea. Based in Constanta, the 2,000-member Coastal Defense Regiment was the shore-based component of defense against attack from the Black Sea. Air Force On 15 February 1949, the Romanian Aviation Command was established following on the Soviet model of aviation regiments instead of the British model of squadron. This would later be renamed to the Romanian People's Air Force. In 1969, an air defence unit was created to provide protection against air attacks while a paratrooper regiment was founded in 1980, both of which were assigned to the Campia Turzii (now RoAF 71st Air Base). A Romanian-made IAR-93 attack aircraft flew its first flight on 31 October 1974 over BacƒÉuIAR-93 History, marking the first jet fighter in the Eastern Bloc to be domestically manufactured. The Mikoyan MiG-29 aircraft entered the inventory of the Air Force just a few days before the Romanian revolution of December 1989. Patriotic Guards Two patriotic guardswomen training near an industrial park. Formed in 1968 after Ceau»ôescu's speech of 21 August 1968, the Romanian Patriotic Guards was an organization dedicated to public security, with its functions including civil policing to an active reserve for the People's Army. During wartime, the President of the Republic could authorize the guards to become a large \\"People's Militia\\" that would provide military police-style security, as well as augment the ground forces, and operate as guerrillas forces. The force was not part of the Ministry of National Defence but was instead a directly reporting unit of the PCR and the Union of Communist Youth, of which it drafted members of both. Members of the guards were considered territorial troops (For»õele teritoriale), as they were organized into companies and/or platoons and were based in every jude»õ, municipality, and industrial/agricultural area under the command of the first secretary of the local PCR. Securitate Troops On 23 January 1949, the communist government disbanded the Royal Romanian Gendarmerie only to purged its personnel and redistribute them to the newly created Directorate for Security Troops (DTO) of the Securitate (Department of State Security), modeled after the NKVD's Internal Troops and the KGB. Repere istorice , Romanian Gendarmerie website, accessed on 14 April 2007 It acted as a 20,000-strong eilite paramilitary force consisting of selected people form the conscripts pool for the People's Army who performed routine law enforcement functions such traffic control and issuance of identification cards. It was organized into infantry units who were equipped with small arms as well as artillery, and armored personnel carriers. The security troops were directly responsible to the Minister of the Interior and there the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, giving then the ability to guard important installations including PCR office buildings and state radio and television stations. The regime of Ceau»ôescu could have theoretically called in the security troops as a private army to prevent a military coup d'√©tat and/or suppress antiregime riots. It was also responsible for ensuring total loyalty among the rank and file in the People's Army, employing political officers to push the country's military doctrine. It operated under a more strict discipline and routine than the regular military, which resulted in their special treatment and enjoyment of better living conditions then their counterparts. In late 1989, the directorate was disbanded and replaced first by the Guard and Order Troops (Trupele de PazƒÉ »ôi Ordine), and later on the reformed Gendarmerie.

Bred and owned by the 6th Duke of Portland, she was one of the best two-year- olds in England in 1889 when she won thirteen times from fifteen races. In the following spring she recorded her biggest success when she won the 1000 Guineas. She went on to run fourth in the Oaks Stakes and third in the Coronation Stakes, but never won again and was retired from racing at the end of the year. She had modest success as a dam of winners. Background Semolina was a small bay mare, standing barely 15 hands high bred in England by her owner William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland. She was sent into training with the Duke's private trainer George Dawson at the Heath House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was from the first crop of foals sired by the undefeated racehorse St Simon who went on to win nine sires‚Äô championships. Mowerina, Semolina's dam, won sixteen races and produced several winners including the Epsom Derby winner Donovan and Raeburn, the only horse ever to defeat Isinglass. Racing career 1889: two-year-old season 6th Duke of Portland, Semolina's owner and breeder Semolina began her racing career on 28 March when she started at odds of 3/1 in a fourteen- runner field for the Brocklesby Stakes over five furlongs at Lincoln Racecourse and won by a length from a colt named Lactantius. At Newmarket Racecourse a month later she \\"cantered\\" to victory in the First Spring Two- Year-Old Stakes, and went on to take the Exning Stakes at the same track despite carrying a ten-pound weight penalty. In the May Plate at Windsor Racecourse the filly started at odds of 1/2 and won easily from Rotten Row and three others. After winning the Acorn Stakes at Epsom Racecourse, Semolina was sent to Royal Ascot in June where she was matched against the highly regarded colt Surefoot in the Biennial Stakes. She was described as looking like a \\"small black rat\\" alongside the big, handsome colt but after leading from the start she got the better of a \\"desperate\\" struggle to win by a short head. The filly went on to record two victories at Stockbridge Racecourse's Bibury Club meeting, namely the Home-Bred Foal Stakes, which she won \\"readily\\" from three opponents, and the Stockbridge Post Stakes. On 18 July at Leicester Racecourse Semolina started 4/6 favourite for the ¬£6,000 Portland Stakes but sustained her first defeat as she finished fifth behind the filly Riviera after fading badly in the final furlong. At Goodwood Racecourse Semolina returned to winning form as she \\"ran away\\" with the Prince of Wales' Stakes. In autumn Semolina was scheduled to run a match race against Lord Zetland's colt Fontainebleau and collected a ¬£100 forfeit when her opponent failed to appear. At Newmarket's \\"October\\" meetings Semolina won the Municipal Stakes, Boscawen Stakes and the Free Handicap. On her final run of the year she ran in the six- furlong Middle Park Stakes but made little impact and finished unplaced behind the Duke of Portland's other filly Signorina. Semolina ended the season with a record of thirteen wins from fifteen starts and her earnings of ¬£9,285 helped the Duke of Portland to claim the title of British flat racing Champion Owner for 1889 although her heavy schedule led to accusations that the Duke was \\"running horses off their legs\\". 1890: three-year-old season John Watts, who rode Semolina to victory in the 1000 Guineas On 2 May 1890, Semolina, ridden by John Watts, was one of ten fillies to contest the 77th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. At the time, an owner with more than one runner in the race was allowed to \\"declare to win\\" with one of their representatives. This meant that other horses in the same ownership could be held back to finish behind the declared horse, allowing the entry to run as a team as well as clarifying the likely result for the betting public. The Duke of Portland declared to win with Semolina, who thus went off the 1/2 favourite while her promising stablemate Memoir went off the 10/1 second choice. Semolina took the lead from start and as she approached the last quarter mile she had most of her opponents struggling although Memoir still looked to be going very well. She kept on well to win by three quarters of a length from Memoir, with one and a half length back to Fatuite in third place. The runner-up's jockey George Barrett appeared some difficulty preventing his filly from winning the race but did nothing wrong according to the \\"declare to win\\" rule. In the Oaks Stakes on 6 June Semolina was stepped up in distance to one and a half miles and started the 4/1 third choice in the betting behind Signorina and Memoir. On this occasion did not declare to win with either of his fillies, meaning that they were expected to run on their individual merits. Ridden by Fred Barrett, Semolina took an early lead and set a very strong pace before tiring in the straight and finishing fourth of the seven runners behind Memoir, Signorina and Ponza. At least on correspondent claimed that Semolina had effectively been sacrificed and run as a pacemaker to secure the victory of her stablemate. Semolina was dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and in a very close contest she finished third behind Heresy and Floranthe, to whom she was conceding seven and fourteen pounds respectively. In September Semolina started favourite for the Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse but faded badly in the closing stages and came home last of the three runners behind Ponza and Star. At Newmarket in October she was dropped back to sprint distances for the Great Eastern Railway Handicap but finished unplaced under a weight of 108 pounds. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Semolina became a broodmare for the Duke of Portland's stud. She produced five foals and one good winner between 1896 and 1902. She produced no living foals after 1902 and died in 1909. Her produce includes: *Arrowroot, a bay filly, foaled in 1896, sired by Morion *Three-O-Three (AKA .303), bay filly, 1897, by Carbine *Sir Edgar, bay colt, 1898, by Kendal.

On return, Wilson suffered a shoulder injury mid-season that required a reconstruction and missed Sturt's 2016 premiership. In 2017, encouraged by senior coach Martin Mattner, he shifted from defence to a midfield role. Wilson said that the change suited his physical style. He played in Sturt's 2017 premiership and was selected in the 2017 SANFL Team of the Year. Wilson was drafted by with pick 17 in the 2017 AFL rookie draft, their first selection.

It was designed by William Kemp, the Department of Education architect. It is also known as Wingen Public School. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The building was designed in 1882 by the Department of Education architect, William Kemp and was built by Mr J. Johnstone at the cost of A¬£1,185. It consisted of a schoolroom and teachers residence. This use is evidenced by the two entrance doors at the front for the schoolroom and the teachers residence respectively. Behind the main building is a brick kitchen block which was once linked to the main building by a breezeway. In 1980 the owner of the property Mr B. Laurie applied for financial assistance to help restore Mountain House. The application was unsuccessful as the significance of the house had not been established. In 1983 Mr Laurie again applied for funding and nominated Mountain View House for a Permanent Conservation Order. The owner was also concerned that future road widen proposals may affect the property. To ensure conservation work done by the owners was not compromised in the future and in recognition of its historic, architectural and social value a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 22 March 1985. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Mountain House stands beside the New England Highway in the village of Wingen between and Murrurundi. It is a single storey painted brick structure with a corrugated iron roof and front verandah both of which are of hipped form.

In the middle of the 18th century it was of great military and strategic importance and also was the most powerful among the southern fortresses of Russia. The city of Rostov-on-Don was named after the fortress. The fortress was never a direct place of any military operations; at the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774, it lost the importance of border fortification. From one of its former vorstadt the city of Rostov-on-Don of Ekaterinoslav Governorate was established by 1811. In 1835 the garrison and military property of the Rostov Fortress were transferred to Anapa. The ramparts and bastions were demolished at the end of the 19th century.  History   Construction  A cossack in the Fortress of Saint Dimitry, 1774. In the 1740s there arose the need to build a more powerful fortification on the Don for the protection of Temernitskaya Customs, rather than the existing Fortress of Saint Anna. In 1744, Captain Sipyagin reported on the choice of a place for the construction of fortifications near the Rich Well tract. The Senate rejected the first seven projects, but when two other projects (stone and earth fortifications) were approved, the garrison of the fortress of St. Anna was transferred to a new place on 20 December 1760. On 6 April (17 April New Style) 1761, the Empress Elizaveta Petrovna issued the decree which granted fortress the name of Saint Dmitry of Rostov. On 23 September of the same year took place the laying of its foundations.[4] The construction works were carried out under the leadership of military engineer General Alexander Rigelman. In 1761 Rigelman ordered to build a brick factory at the Kizierinsky Gully for the needs of construction of Saint Dimitry Fortress. Stone for construction was extracted from the Rich spring, logs were brought from the Leontievsky and Glukhie gullies, which are located near Mius and Kalmius rivers. The forest was cut down and floated along the Mius River up to the Miuss Estuary. From the estuary logs were transported to the construction site by horses and oxen. By 1761, seven redoubts were created in the fortress. Earthworks and the main buildings of the fortress were completed in 1763.  Description  The fortress of St. Dimitry of Rostov was of great military and strategic importance. It was the most powerful among the southern fortifications of Russia. The circumference of the fortress was about 3.5 km, and its area - about 76 hectares.Another plan of the fortress The fortress was star-shaped in plan and consisted of nine redoubts, surrounded by a moat and connected by eight ravelins. On the Don side, the fortress defended by a bastion with crownworks. Below the bastion, the precipitous shore was fortified with two redoubts, three batteries and two half-bastions, placed one above the other. The total length of the fortification front was 3.5 kilometers. In the fortress wall there were two gates - from the west and east sides. Redoubts were named Troitsky, Anninsky, St. Andrew, Ekaterininsky, Elizavetinsky, Petrovsky, Pavlovsky, Alexandra Nevskogo and Donskoy. The fortress was armed with 238 guns. Powder, artillery and food stores, 28 military barracks and military infirmaries, as well as officer houses and houses of artisans and merchants were also constructed on the territory of the fortress. The fortress had two gates: Arkhangelsk Gates in the west, and St. George's - in the east. The streets inside the fortress, with a width of 10 to 20 meters, formed rectangular quarters. At the same time, wide streets were laid perpendicular to the river. The central street was named Bogatyanovskiy Lane (present-day Kirov Avenue). On the central square in the fortress there was built the Intercession Cathedral. The facades of the main administrative buildings of the military department were constructed in front of this cathedral. By the end of the 18th century, five churches were built on the territory of the fortress: Sobornaya Pokrovskaya, Kazan, Nikolayevskaya, Kupecheskaya (Nativity-Theotokos) and the Church of All Saints. In the fortress, began his service the naval commander Fyodor Ushakov. In 1778 the fortress was visited by Alexander Suvorov. In 1768, the population of the fortress exceeded five thousand people. At the beginning of the 19th century the fortress decayed, the fortifications were gradually destroyed, and the territory was built up. The earthen ramparts were razed. In 1835, weapons, ammunition and ammunition were transported to the Anapa Fortress.  Legacy  The Monument to the founders of Rostov-on-Don Fortress was opened in 2009, in the year of 260th official anniversary of Rostov-on-Don. It presents the sculptures of Alexander Rigelman, Captain Somov (the first commander of fortress), Danila Efremov (the Ataman of the Don Army), and the merchant Hastanov (the first head of the Temernitskaya Customs).–ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ ¬´–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º –∫—Ä–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –î–∏–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏—è –†–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ¬ª.

Ten family members were found hanged, while the oldest family member, the grandmother, was strangled. The bodies were found on 1 July 2018; in the early morning after the death. The police have ruled the deaths as mass suicide, with an angle of shared psychosis being investigated. Background The Chundawat family (also known as Bhatia family by neighbours) had been living in the double-story house in Burari's Sant Nagar neighbourhood for around twenty years, after moving from their native town in Rajasthan. The family ran a grocery shop and plywood business in the area. The family included Narayani Devi, 77; sons Bhavnesh, 50, and Lalit, 45; daughters-in-law Savita, 48, and Teena, 42; daughter Pratibha Bhatia (n√©e Chundawat), 57; and grandchildren Priyanka (daughter of Pratibha), 33, Nitu (elder daughter of Bhavnesh), 25, Monu (younger daughter of Bhavnesh), 23, Dhruv (youngest son of Bhavnesh), 15, and Shivam (only child of Lalit), 15. Bavnesh's elder son had left home 3 years prior and so was spared. In 2007, Lalit Chundawat's father Bhopal Singh died of natural causes. After the death of his father, Lalit became very introverted, and soon he started praying in front of trees, and offering food to animals. One day, he told his family that he was possessed by his father‚Äôs soul, who advised him the ways to attain a good life. Since 2013 he had been maintaining a diary on his father‚Äôs \\"instructions\\". The pet dog of the family Tommy died of a heart attack at his newfound home in Noida on Sunday 22 July 2018. Tommy, the only survivor in the house, was chained on the terrace and suffering from high fever when the police found him after discovering the 11 bodies. It was not clear who had tied him. He was later said to have been convalescing at Noida‚Äôs House of Stray Animals, where he was taken immediately after being rescued. Discovery of bodies On the morning of 1 July around 7:15, neighbour Gurcharan Singh, who used to go on morning walks with one of the deceased, went to the Chundawat residence after noticing Lalit Chundawat's absence for the morning walk, as well as the fact that the shops were still not opened (the shops usually opened at 6am). Gurcharan Singh found the door of the house open and the ten people, including Lalit Chundawat, hanging. He raised an alert by calling other neighbours, and police received the call around 7:30. Suicides Ten of the eleven people - two men, six women and two teens - were found hanging in the courtyard of the house. They were blindfolded and their mouths were taped. Some of the bodies had their hands and feet tied as well. Another woman, 77-year-old Narayani Devi was found dead in another room. It appeared that she had been strangled. The members were found hanging from a mesh in their ceiling in the hallway, all close together. Their faces were wrapped almost entirely, ears plugged with cotton, mouths taped and hands tied behind the back. There were five stools, probably shared by the 10 members. Their faces covered with cloth pieces cut from a single bed-sheet. Investigation Police said the circumstances surrounding the deaths point to mass suicide for occult reasons or murder for occult reasons. Police are also investigating with the possibility of murder with a motive other than occult. In the early stages of investigation, police registered a murder case, investigating it from every angle. Police found eleven diaries in the house, all of them maintained for the period of eleven years. Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Alok Kumar stated: \\"We have found handwritten notes detailing how hands and legs are to be tied and are quite similar to the manner in which the bodies of 10 persons were found. They are exhaustive notes and we are studying them.\\" Details/directions provided in the diaries match how the bodies were found with their faces covered, mouths taped, and cotton balls in ears. The diary also mentions: \\"everyone will tie their own hands and when the kriya (ritual) is done then everyone will help each other untie their hands.\\" Signifying the family was not expecting to die. Psychological view Psychologists have commented that these deaths are a result of ‚Äòshared psychotic disorder‚Äô in which members of a group blindly trust one among them and follow instructions without questioning. Psychologists feel that Lalit suffered from a ‚Äòdelusional disorder‚Äô.

An albedometer is an instrument used to measure the albedo (reflecting radiation) of a surface. An albedometer is mostly used to measure the reflectance of earths surface. Often it consists of two pyranometers: one facing up towards the sky and one facing down towards the surface. From the ratio of incoming and reflecting radiation the albedo can be calculated. Measurement principle The measurement of surface albedo of earths surface happens by using two pyranometers. The upfacing pyranometer measures the incoming global solar radiation. The downward facing pyranometer measures the reflected global solar radiation. The ratio of the reflected to the global radiation is the solar albedo and depends on the properties of the surface and the directional distribution of the incoming solar radiation.

Blancho is originally from R√ºeggisberg. Funded by Qatar, and associated with a member of the House of Al Thani, Blancho is the subject of several controversies, including spreading jihadist propaganda, anti- semitism, attempting to obtain a weapon, and praising the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.  Background  According to a report by the Weltwoche, Blancho grew up in Biel as a nonbeliever in a family of liberal thought. After secondary school, he first began an apprenticeship in print production. He converted to Islam at the age of 16. He left the apprenticeship, continued high school and studied law and Islamic studies at the University of Bern in 2007. In 2004, Blancho founded the company \\"Alquds Food GmbH\\", importing food especially from Tunisia. The company was liquidated in 2007. In 2006, he founded with Abdul Hamid Al-Fayek the food import and export company \\"A & B Tradex GmbH\\", which was then liquidated in 2013. Blancho is fluent in German, French and Arabic. He is de facto polygamous, in spite of the ban of polygamy in Swiss law. He married officially a Yemeni woman and then got married with a woman of Kosovo according to Islamic law. According to sources close to ICCS, he has at least a third wife. Blancho follows a Salafist form of Islam, which excludes a modern interpretation of the scriptures. He described lapidating as \\"an element, a value of my religion\\". Since 2003, Nicolas Blancho has been known for his fight to introduce the Sharia law in Switzerland. Blancho is founder and chairman of the ICCS, together with Qaasim Illi, who was condemned in 2005 for pornography (coprophilia) and anti-semitism. Over the years, Blancho accumulated many debts, for a total amount of 200,000 Swiss francs, according to a press article published in November 2017. This amount comprises the debts of his bankrupt companies, but also unpaid tax bills, health insurance premiums, contributions to social insurance and car repair bills. According to politician Henri-Charles Beuchat, it is highly probable that Blancho receives social assistance from the municipality of Bern.  Controversies  The press characterises Blancho, much like the members Islamic Central Council of Switzerland, as a minority of dangerous radicalised Islamists. Other newspaper articles highlight his links with terrorism. The public prosecutor of Switzerland opened an investigation in November 2016 against Blancho and Qaasim Illi following the publication of a video jihadist propaganda. Another recording suggests he supports the Islamic State group. In May 2018, the Federal Court of Switzerland confirmed a decision of the police of Bern not to allow Blancho to carry a gun. ‚ÄúThere were concrete indications the complainant himself could jeopardize third parties‚Äù, said a lower court in Bern, where Blancho appealed the decision. According to Le Temps, the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS) is investigating the links between Blancho and Islamists based in Qatar deemed close to al-Qaeda, such as Abdulrahman al- Nuaimi and Ali Abdullah al-Suwaidi. Blancho is financially supported by Qatar. He heads the Swiss associations Aziz Aid and Qoranona with Abdulaziz Abdulrahman H.A. Al-Thani, a senior member of the Qatari ruling family, the House of Al Thani. In a YouTube interview, Blancho also thanks the Sheikh Thani Bin Abdullah Foundation for Humanitarian Services for its financial support.

Most single-breasted suits have two or three buttons, and one or four buttons are unusual (except that tuxedo dinner jackets often have only one button). It is rare to find a suit with more than four buttons, although zoot suits can have as many as six or more due to their longer length. There is also variation in the placement and style of buttons,Druesdow (1990). p. vi. \\"...for often the difference in style from season to season was in the distance between buttons...\\" since the button placement is critical to the overall impression of height conveyed by the jacket. The centre or top button will typically line up quite closely with the natural waistline.Flusser (2002). p. 83 There seems to be no clear rule as to which side the overlap should lie. It usually crosses naturally with the left side to the fore but not invariably. Generally, a hidden button holds the underlap in place. Double-breasted jackets have only half their outer buttons functional, as the second row is for display only, forcing them to come in pairs. Some rare jackets can have as few as two buttons, and during various periods, for instance the 1960s and 70s, as many as eight were seen. Six buttons are typical, with two to button; the last pair floats above the overlap. The three buttons down each side may in this case be in a straight line (the 'keystone' layout) or more commonly, the top pair is half as far apart again as each pair in the bottom square. A four-button double-breasted jacket usually buttons in a square.Antongiavanni (2006). p. 14 The layout of the buttons and the shape of the lapel are co-ordinated in order to direct the eyes of an observer. For example, if the buttons are too low, or the lapel roll too pronounced, the eyes are drawn down from the face, and the waist appears larger.Antongiavanni (2006). p. 16 Lapels The jacket's lapels can be notched (also called stepped), peaked (pointed), shawl, or trick (Mandarin and other unconventional styles). Each lapel style carries different connotations, and is worn with different cuts of suit. Notched lapels are the most common of the three are usually only found on single-breasted jackets and are the most informal style. They are distinguished by a 75 to 90 degree 'notch' at the point where the lapel meets the collar. Peaked lapels have sharp edges which point upward towards the shoulders. Double-breasted jackets usually have peaked lapels, although peaked lapels are often found on single breasted jackets as well. Shawl lapels are a style derived from the Victorian informal evening wear, and as such are not normally seen on suit jackets except for tuxedos or dinner suits.Flusser (2002). pp. 82‚Äì85 For black tie events, only jackets with pointed and shawl lapels should be worn. notched lapel peaked lapel shawl lapel In the 1980s, double-breasted suits with notched lapels were popular with power suits and the New Wave style. In the late 1920s and 1930s, a design considered very stylish was the single-breasted peaked lapel jacket. This has gone in and out of vogue periodically, being popular once again during the 1970s, and is still a recognised alternative. The ability to properly cut peak lapels on a single-breasted suit is one of the most challenging tailoring tasks, even for very experienced tailors. The width of the lapel is a varying aspect of suits, and has changed over the years. The 1930s and 1970s featured exceptionally wide lapels, whereas during the late 1950s and most of the 1960s suits with very narrow lapels--often only about an inch wide--were in fashion. The 1980s saw mid-size lapels with a low gorge (the point on the jacket that forms the notch or peak between the collar and front lapel). Current (mid-2000s) trends are towards a narrower lapel and higher gorge. Necktie width usually follows the width of the jacket lapel. Lapels also have a buttonhole, intended to hold a boutonni√®re, a decorative flower. These are now only commonly seen at more formal events. Usually double-breasted suits have one hole on each lapel (with a flower just on the left), while single-breasted suits have just one on the left. Pockets Most jackets have a variety of inner pockets, and two main outer pockets, which are generally either patch pockets, flap pockets, or jetted (besom) pockets.The Nu-Way Course in Fashionable Clothes Making (1926). Lesson 33 The patch pocket is, with its single extra piece of cloth sewn directly onto the front of the jacket, a sporting option, sometimes seen on summer linen suits, or other informal styles. The flap pocket is standard for side pockets, and has an extra lined flap of matching fabric covering the top of the pocket. A jetted pocket is most formal, with a small strip of fabric taping the top and bottom of the slit for the pocket. This style is most often on seen on formalwear, such as a dinner jacket. A breast pocket is usually found at the left side, where a pocket square or handkerchief can be displayed. In addition to the standard two outer pockets and breast pocket, some suits have a fourth, the ticket pocket, usually located just above the right pocket and roughly half as wide. While this was originally exclusively a feature of country suits, used for conveniently storing a train ticket, it is now seen on some town suits. Another country feature also worn sometimes in cities is a pair of hacking pockets, which are similar to normal ones, but slanted; this was originally designed to make the pockets easier to open on horseback while hacking.Flusser (1985). ch. 2 Sleeves Suit jackets in all styles typically have three or four buttons on each cuff, which are often purely decorative (the sleeve is usually sewn closed and cannot be unbuttoned to open). Five buttons are unusual and are a modern fashion innovation. The number of buttons is primarily a function of the formality of the suit; a very casual summer sports jacket might traditionally (1930s) have had only one button, while tweed suits typically have three and city suits four. In the 1970s, two buttons were seen on some city suits. Today, four buttons are common on most business suits and even casual suits. Although the sleeve buttons usually cannot be undone, the stitching is such that it appears they could. Functional cuff buttons may be found on high-end or bespoke suits; this feature is called a surgeon's cuff or working button holes (U.S.). Some wearers leave these buttons undone to reveal that they can afford a bespoke suit, although it is proper to leave these buttons done up. Modern bespoke styles and high end off-the-rack suits equipped with surgeon's cuffs have the last two buttons stitched off-centre, so that the sleeve hangs more cleanly should the buttons ever be undone. Certainty in fitting sleeve length must be achieved, as once working button holes are cut, the sleeve length essentially cannot be altered further. A cuffed sleeve has an extra length of fabric folded back over the arm, or just some piping or stitching above the buttons to allude to the edge of a cuff. This was popular in the Edwardian era, as a feature of formalwear such as frock coats carried over to informalwear, but is now rare. Vents A vent is a slit in the bottom rear (the tail) of the jacket. Originally, vents were a sporting option, designed to make riding easier, so are traditional on hacking jackets, formal coats such as a morning coat, and, for practicality, overcoats. Today there are three styles of venting: the single-vented style (with one vent at the centre); the ventless style; and the double-vented style (one vent on each side). Vents are convenient, particularly when using a pocket or sitting down, to improve the hang of the jacket,Antongiavanni (2006). p. 172 so are now used on most jackets. Ventless jackets are associated with Italian tailoring, while the double-vented style is typically British. Dinner jackets traditionally have no vents.

It was designed by Guy Crick and Bruce Furse and built from 1937 to 1938 by Mr A. F. Little. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 February 2003.  History  Foundation The Scone Civic Theatre was designed by Guy Crick and Bruce W. Furse, architects, Sydney, in 1937 for the Scone Theatres Pty Ltd. The original design by Crick & Furse was an 899-seat cinema. However, this was scrapped and the cinema redesigned after the company was unable to procure the original site on Kelly Street that they wanted, An amended scheme was submitted in November 1937 by Crick and Furse for license approval under the Public Halls and Cinemas Act of 1908. The theatre was designed to seat 583 in the stalls and 246 in the circle, but was scaled back to seat 568 in the stalls and 240 in the dress circle, making the total seating capacity of 808. The tender of Mr. A. F. Little was accepted in November 1937, and building commenced in December. By February 1938, the foundations had been laid and the brickwork of the outside walls commenced. By 18 July 1938 the cinema was virtually complete, with just the seats to be put into position, just in time for the official opening of the cinema.Scone Civic Theatre , Licence No. 544, State Records Ref. 17/3283 The building cost approximately A¬£14,000 to erect. The building contractor was Mr A. F. Little of Sydney. Mr H. Knight of Annandale did the painting and decorating and the electrician was Mr. G. H. Marshall, of Scone. The fibrous plasterers were Messrs. Rich and Co., Newcastle; vestibule and floor tiling; Roof and Building Service, Sydney; carpets, Mr A. Frederick Gibbs, and curtains, Mr G. Brakell. Sound equipment was supplied by RCA; bio machines, National Theatre Supplies; seating, Owen Knox and Co; heating and ventilating, Unit Air Conditioners, Sydney; doors, and also the complete fittings of the milk bar, Mr J. Hill, Scone.The Scone Advocate. 29 July 1938. The Civic Theatre was proclaimed and gazetted on 17 June 1938, and its licence issued on 17 August 1938. The Civic Theatre was leased to Mr. C. R. N. Owen, and the Gala Opening was on 27 July 1938. The opening night was a charity function, with proceeds in aid of the Scott Memorial Hospital, in Scone. The Mayor of Scone, Ald. W. J. O'Brien, officiated at the event, after H. C. Carter, the Member for Liverpool Plains, couldn't attend due to illness. There were two films on the program Stolen Heaven and A Bride for Henry - which were supplemented by shorts.The Scone Advocate. 26 July 1938. Scone Theatres Pty Ltd was formed in 1937 to construct the cinema. The directors of the company and its shareholders were farmers and residents from the district. Chairman of the company, A. C. Ingham, explained at the opening night, \\"the theatre...had been built by the citizens of the town and district, by whom the whole of the requisite capital had been subscribed\\". The Company had shown its determination to cater for the entertainment of the people, and looked forward to a continuance of their patronage, which was so much appreciated in the evening. The Scone Advocate praised the company for their \\"boldness and faith and confidence in the town and district.\\" The directors of the company in 1937 were Arthur Centennial Inham, a grazier from Parklands; Herbett Ernest Ell Garside, a store keeper in Scone; and the alternate director was Maxwell Osmond Pye, a medical practitioner in based in Scone.Dead Companies Records - Scone Theatres Pty Ltd, file no: 18596. State Records ref 17/9481 The Civic Theatre was seen as a sign of progress and enterprise for Scone, \\"imposing and resplendent to a degree\\", \\"an ornament to the district, of which it will also remain one of the architectural features for many years to come\\". The Scone Advocate reported the theatre opened \\"in a blaze of splendour and colour\\". The design and fittings of the cinema were admired for being modern, efficient and comfortable.\\" In the magnificent building, seating accommodation has been provided for approximately 1000 persons in stalls and circle (a slight exaggeration, as the cinema actually seated 808), while spacious foyer room and vestibules have been incorporated in the scheme. The auditorium has been portioned and designed so as to permit of the maximum acoustic properties being obtained, and is ornamented by a restrained application of features that blend with the artistic ceiling to give full effect to the colour combination provided by the Neon and concealed lighting, the mellowness, yet sufficiently colourfulness, of which is most effective.\\" In particular, the theatre's air- conditioning was celebrated as a modem innovation. The Civic Theatre, as the newspaper was quick to point out, was amongst the first cinemas in the state to have full air-conditioning. The design, plans and specifications for the air-conditioning are deposited at NSW State Records in the file for Scone Civic Theatre - Licence No; 554.NSW State Records Ref 20/14972 1950s On 22 September 1954, just before 5:00 pm, a fire broke out in the Civic Theatre. Theatre employees discovered the fire when they returned to the cinema to prepare for the evening programme. Scone Volunteer Fire Brigade was called to the cinema to put out the blaze, which had originated in the pit below the stage. It was unclear how the fire started, it being blamed on children smoking tobacco in the pit under the stage. Damage to the theatre was contained around the stage section of the auditorium. The stage, screen, curtains, sound equipment, ceiling and roof were severely damaged by fire, with the remainder of the building's contents being slightly damaged by heat, smoke and water. The Northern Daily Leader reported that the fire caused an estimated ¬£5,000 damage to the theatre. After cleaning up and making a temporary canvass sheet roof, the Civic Theatre re-opened to patrons two days later on the Friday.Northern Daily Leader, 23 September 1954. The lessee, Mr Theo Coroneo, took the opportunity to renovate the cinema while building new fittings following the fire, By December 1954 the roof and ceiling had been repaired, and the stage was in the course of reconstruction. The Theatre was also renovated and painted. Alterations were made to the observation ports in the bio-box and new apparatus was provided.

It was constructed of concrete foundations and floor with timber frame and galvanised corrugated iron sheet walls and roof. As noted above, the original lessee of the Civic Theatre from Scone Theatre Pty Ltd was C. R. N. Owen. According to The Scone Advocate, Mr Owen, had 'quite a chain of theatres in the country districts of the State\\". In the early days of the theatre, the local manager was Mr Ron Sutton, who had previously worked with Mr Owen at one of his enterprises down at Nowra.The Scone Advocate. 28 July 1938. In 1944, Alex Coroneo was listed as the exhibitor at the Civic Theatre.Film Weekly Motion Picture Directory, 1943-44 The lease was then taken over by Theo Mena Coroneo and Sam Coroneo, and together the brothers ran the theatre until 1953, after which time Theo Mena Coroneo took over the licence and lease for himself. In May 1963 Theo Mena Coroneo purchased the Civic Theatre from Scone Theatres Pty Ltd, and as a consequence the company was wound up. The Civic Theatre has remained in the hands of the Coroneo family since 1963. Closure According to Ross Thorne et. al., the Civic Theatre \\"closed around 1983-84, but reopened in 1988 after minor renovations. It closed again in 1992, but reopened the same year.\\" In 2018, the facade of the building was restored as part of an ongoing restoration effort aimed at reopening the building as a multifunction centre. Development of cinema theatres in Australia Guy Crick (1901‚Äì1964) was born in Hobart and was educated in Melbourne. He attended the Technical College in Melbourne part- time for four years, then returned to Hobart in the early 1920s where he subsequently married. In the middle of the decade he moved to Sydney and managed to gain employment in the office of Henry Eli White, one of the most prolific and influential cinema and theatre designers in Australia during the 1920s. Here he would have become familiar with the Union Theatres (later Greater Union) and established a relationship with the company that enabled him to design cinemas for it up until the early 1960s. White closed his office at the onset of the Great Depression and so Crick went into partnership with the cinema specialist architect Charles Bohringer (Bohringer Taylor and Crick) in 1930. This was relatively short lived, Crick leaving the firm to form Crick & Associated. One of these was Bruce W. Furse, who had also worked in the Bohringer office. Bruce Furse (1906 - 1967) was born in Strathfield, Sydney, and completed his architectural education at the Sydney Technical College. It is not known who Furse worked for as a young man, but he did not complete the course at the Technical College, instead qualifying to practice as an architect in 1933 after sitting for the Board of Architects of NSW examination. The firm of Crick and Furse reputedly designed thirty new cinema buildings in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania, and remodelled about fifty existing cinemas. Crick was influenced by German Expressionist architecture and interested in the interior design of cinemas, that is the furnishings, acoustics, and lighting, while Furse provided the basic lines of decoration and lighting. After the partnership split up in 1940 Furse went into practice by himself. He carried out wawar-relatedesign and supervision, then after WWII established a practice known as Bruce. W. Furse & Associates. An accident in 1954 resulted in his early retirement from professional life. Crick also continued to practice, keeping his office open while serving in New Guinea during the war. After the war he went into partnership with Servas Van Breda, then practiced as Guy Crick & Associates and finally formed the partnership of Guy Crick, Lewis and Williams. He practiced in Brisbane and in Sydney. According to Ross Thorne, the Minerva/Metro and West Olympia in Adelaide - both designed by Crick & Furse - were the two finest \\"Moderne\\" style theatres in Australia.Cinemas of Australia Via USA. P366 Thorne, along with Kevin Cork, wrote of Crick & Furse \\"their influence on cinema building in Australia is immeasurable. The theatres they created represented all that was considered to be modern and comfortable.\\".All the Kings Men, p. 20 After years of research, plans, reports and meeting approvals, stage one conservation works began in February 2017 - restoration of its exterior. A $40,000 grant from the Office of Environment & Heritage in 2016 contributed four per cent of the overall cost of the initial phase. Stage 2 will be ground floor internal refurbishment, to make it available for use as a community multifunction centre with concealed modern conveniences.  Description  The Civic Theatre at Scone is a medium-sized cinema designed in the Inter-war Functionalist & Moderne style. The building is rendered brick with a fibrolite (corrugated asbestos sheet) roof. Ornament of the building is concentrated on the upper part of the building. The cinema features a stepped skyline on which the cinema's name - Civic - was promoted vertically in stylised lettering. A parallel line motif defines the top of the parapet and the buildings length giving a streamlined effect, and a large circular window dominates the left-hand side of the building, providing light to the crush lounge. The premises consists of the cinema auditorium and one retail shop (originally a milk bar). Specifications of the cinema were described in the original licence as follows: The building is erected on reinforced concrete foundations, the walls are brick, and the roof construction wood. The roof will be covered with iron. The circle is supported by R. S. J. radials, the general construction being wood. The stairways are carried out in concrete. The height of the ceiling from the floor line is . The overall size of the premises is . The width of the auditorium is and the depth . The stage is in depth by in width. The depth of the gallery is . A foyer lounge is located above the shop. The foyer lounge is 16 ft x 34 ft. The biograph room is situated at the rear of the circle. The ventilating machine is towards the rear of the premises and will be independently roofed. The cinema was to be heated and air-conditioned, one of the earliest cinemas to receive such treatment. The interiors of the foyer, crush lounge and cinema auditorium are highly intact. Entrance to the foyer is via timber framed and glassed double doors with chrome handles. The glass is etched with Art Deco decorative elements and the letter \\"C\\". The foyer consists of a ticket booth and candy bar. The ticket booth is situated between the two sets of doors leading to the auditorium. It features metal frame detailing, including a geometric circular pattern, which is repeated in the stair balustrade leading to the crush lounge, and the stairs from the crush lounge to gallery level of the auditorium. The candy bar appears to be a later addition to the foyer. Near the stairs leading to the crush lounge are four Art Deco chairs and a cigarette table. While these may not be original, they contribute significantly to the Art Deco feel of the foyer interior. The crush lounge, which leads from the gallery level of the auditorium is a rectangular room, with a large circular window overlooking Kelly Street. It appears there was originally a bar/candy lounge in this space, however this has since been removed. An old fridge, with a painted logo of the cinema on the side remains. There are doors leading from the men's and women's toilets at the far end of the crush lounge. There are a range of original Art Deco light fittings in the foyer, crush lounge and auditorium. However, there are two chandeliers - one in the foyer and one in the crush lounge - which do not appear to be the original and may have been introduced at a later date. The auditorium is a two level cinema, originally seating 808 people - 568 in the stalls and 240 in the dress circle. The seating in the stalls have been replaced, however there is still original seating in the gallery. The auditorium curves inwards towards the screen and stage, drawing the viewers eyes to the screen. All the original wall decoration remains intact. Of particular note are the abstract Expressionist geometric motifs that extend from the floor to the ceiling along the length of the auditorium. These streamlined geometric patterns are typical of the work of Crick and Furse. The biograph room, at the rear of the circle, has two Simplex projectors with Peerless Magnarc carbonarc lamp houses dating from . The room also contains the original rectifier. The original air- conditioning plant is located on the external northern wall. This has since been replaced by modern air-conditioning.  Condition  As at 6 January 2003, the building was of solid construction but was in need of substantial renovation, especially exterior and interior painting. The Functionalist interiors overlaid with Art Deco detail remain substantially unaltered, since the theatre has never been remodelled.

Heritage listing  As at 14 March 2007, the Scone Civic Theatre was of State significance as the last remaining intact theatre designed by prominent theatre architects, Crick and Furse in New South Wales. Designed in 1937 and completed in 1938, the Scone Civic Theatre is a representative example of the work of the nationally important cinema architects, Crick and Furse. The Kelly Street fa√ßade is an exceptional example of the interwar Functionalist style of architecture in New South Wales, and forms an important part of the streetscape. The Functionalist interiors (overlaid in Art Deco detail) - the auditorium and foyers remain substantially unaltered, since the theatre has never been remodelled. The intact interiors means there is a high level of research and technical significance. It is one of the few cinemas remaining in New South Wales to retain its dress circle, and has not been converted into multiple cinemas. The interiors provide an important understanding of style and detailing of picture theatre architecture in the 1930s. The two projectors are original and date from . These are of immense technical interest, may warrant further research. The original air-conditioning plant remains largely intact and has technical interest as an early example of full air-conditioning dating from 1938. The Scone Civic Theatre was built for local public use by the local community therefore has a high level of social significance. Scone Theatres Pty Ltd, a company formed by residents of the district who financed the venture.

In the Chamber of Deputies he participated in passing laws authorising a loan of up to $25,000,000 in bonds to the national airline, LAN, a fiscal guarantee for purchase of equipment and radio-communications stations.Published in the Official Gazette of November 4, 1937 In August 1937 with deputy Ricardo Latcham (socialist) and in June 1938 in the Senate he denounced illegal payments in exchange for immigration authorizations, which nevertheless continued with the discovery in 1939, that officials of the chancellery had sold Jews entry visas to Chile, in direct contravention of the law and consular rules. For the government of Pedro Aguirre Cerda, the Popular Front candidate for a coalition of Radicals, Socialists and Communists, the year 1938 brought fundamental change in the political history of Chile with the conservative government structure being replaced by one more progressive, though major cultural conflicts crossed economic, anthropological and sociological spheres.

After the end of the war, Cham√∫dez settled in Washington D.C. for eight months to work as a freelance photographer and received commissions from Marcial Mora, Chilean ambassador in the United States, in particular a portrait of Gabriela Mistral at the White House, after she had won the Nobel Prize in Literature (1945).

Journalist in Chile Cham√∫dez returned to Chile in 1951, where he served as a photojournalist for the Economic and Social Council and as the official photographer for President Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla, while also setting up his own studio and gallery.Rodr√≠guez Villegas, H. (1985). 'Historia de la fotograf√≠a en Chile, 1840-1940'. In Bolet√≠n De La Academia Chilena De La Historia, 52, 189. He regained his Chilean citizenship through an act of parliament.

For Magnum in 1952 he travelled travel to Bolivia to cover the National Revolutionary Movement. From this work, one of his images, an heroic Portrait of a Bolivian Miner was selected by Edward Steichen and exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA) in the 1955 exhibition The Family of Man which went on to tour the world and was seen by an audience of 9 million. From 1956 Cham√∫dez was a correspondent of the magazine Visi√≥n in Buenos Aires, reporting from Argentina, Uruguay and with visits to Bolivia and Paraguay. Turning from photography to dedicate himself to journalism, on May 1, 1959, Cham√∫dez was appointed director of the newspaper La Nacion until 1961, when he edited the southern edition of the magazine Visi√≥n. In 1963, he founded and directed the weekly Politica, Cultura e Economia (PEC), the main anticommunist platform of the time.  Later life  Cham√∫dez encountered opposition from the CCP which accused him of being a traitor, and in response, in 1964, he published his autobiography entitled El libro blanco de mi leyenda negra ('The white book of my black legend').Sater, W. (1979). A Survey of Recent Chilean Historiography, 1965-1976. Latin American Research Review, 14(2), 55. After the victory of Salvador Allende in the elections of 1970 he emigrated to Buenos Aires where he lived until 1973. He died on June 25, 1989 and was cremated in a sparsely attended funeral.

Six clubs competed from May till August 1896. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by Randwick. Randwick were crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the table.  Teams   Senior Grade  Six clubs signed up with the New South Wales Rugby Football Union to play the Senior Premiership. Each of the teams had participated in the premiership previously. At the end of the previous season, both the Balmain Football Club and Paddington Electorate Football Club had withdrawn from the premiership. At the beginning of the new season, a Paddington Football Club was formed which could be considered a new club. However, the Union did not agree and would classify the club as a continuation of the previous one. This would have ramifications for Paddington later in the season. { class=\\"toccolours\\" align=\\"center\\" style=\\"text-valign: center;\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" -  width=\\"195\\" align=\\"center\\" 150x150pxPaddington Formed c.1883 Captain: Unknown  width=\\"195\\" align=\\"center\\" 50x50pxPirates Formed on 27 March 1889 Captain: James Carson  width=\\"195\\" align=\\"center\\" 50x50pxRandwick Formed c.1882 Ground: Randwick Reserve Captain: John McMahon -  align=\\"center\\" 150x150pxSydney University Formed c.1863 Ground: University Oval Captain: Harry Abbott  align=\\"center\\" 50x50pxWallaroo Formed c.1870 Captain: Paddy Lane  align=\\"center\\" Wentworth Formed c.1892 Captain: William Warbrick }  Season Summary  The 1896 NSWRFU Sydney Rugby Premiers, Randwick, experienced a great year. Until their defeat at the hands of Wentworth in the Semi Final for the Agricultural Society Trophy, Randwick were undefeated and had positioned themselves in an unassailable position on the premiership ladder. The club had already won the Association Ground Cup in a closely fought match with old rivals Wallaroo. In 19 games played throughout the entire season (including non-premiership matches), Randwick won 16, drew 1 and lost 2, scoring 249 points with 55 against. A remarkable record. Much of the success of the Wentworth Football Club can be attributed to their captain William Warbrick. At the conclusion of the season the team were second to only Randwick in performance and had successfully won the Agricultural Society Trophy. As organiser, coach and captain, Warbrick's experience and knowledge was vital. Excluding the captain, nobody on the Wentworth team had big reputations or had previously been selected for representative positions. Many of the team were Juniors last season and so were pliable in their captains hands. During the season, a proposal was put forward at a NSWRFU meeting advocating local football rather than the club football in existence. The belief was that football was losing its popularity and that the quality of play was deteriorating. Advocates indicated how cricket had successfully transitioned to local-based competition. The proposal was put to a vote and lost. However, the idea of local football had now been given birth. In analysing the current season, some of the most reliable and energetic players amongst the Seniors in 1896 were playing in the Junior ranks last season. This was seen as proof that the Senior clubs should be searching amongst the Junior teams for their players. It was even stated that the Sydney Rugby community had enough capable players to sustain 10 good Senior teams.

The games were decided by draw. In the first semi, Randwick defeated the 'Varsity, 21 points to nil. It was a convincing win for the premiers with most of their points being scored in the second half. The second semi final saw a much closer game between Wallaroo and Wentworth. Wallaroo had the upper hand throughout the game and proceeded to the final to face Randwick.

The game was a fierce and fast encounter with some players sent from the field. Wallaroo persistently attacked with Randwick holding strong in defence. After half time, the score was 3 points to nil in favour of Randwick. Soon after the second half had begun, Wallaroo took the lead 5 points to 3. However, Randwick soon rectified the result taking the lead once again. From this point to the end of the match, Wallaroo performed attack after attack with Randwick's defence holding firm. The final result gave Randwick their third win in the Cup. With this, Randwick became the permanent holders of the Association Ground Cup. = Agricultural Society Trophy = Only one game was played for the Agricultural Society Trophy. The University-Pirates game was a fine example of football with \\"clean passing runs, able kicks, quick intercepting runs, long passes, fine fainting and capital tackling.\\" The Pirates were strengthened by a number of new players who held themselves quite well against the more experienced 'Varsity. At half time, University led 5 points to nil. During the second half, the Pirates scored but missed the conversion which cost them the match. The second game scheduled for the weekend was to be between Wentworth and Paddington. However, the Paddington club, which had been reformed at the beginning of the season, had inherited the past debits of the former club. As these debits were with the NSWRFU, the Union disqualified the club from the competition and awarded Wentworth the win.  Finals Week 3, 11 July  { align=\\"right\\"  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin-left:1em; margin-right:4em\\" - bgcolor=#ccffcc ! colspan=2Agricultural Trophy Semi Finals - bgcolor=#fff  colspan=2 - width=150; align=left20px Randwickwidth=200 - bgcolor=#ccffcc align=leftWentworth3 - bgcolor=#fff  colspan=2 - bgcolor=#ccffcc align=left20px Wallaroo30 - align=left20px Sydney University10 } = Agricultural Society Trophy = The first semi final for the trophy was played between Randwick and Wentworth. After the previous match against Wallaroo, Randwick had some players who were not at their best due to the intensity of that game. Wentworth, on the other hand, had done everything possible to ensure it had its best players available and were well prepared for the game. As a result, Randwick failed to play the majority of the game with their usual \\"dash\\" and met strong defence from Wentworth. A single try was scored by the Wentworth Captain to win the match. The second semi final saw Wallaroo play Sydney University. A high scoring match saw points added rapidly. Wallaroo won the game 30 points to 10.

Some of the players had been selected to play in the NSW representative team and were unavailable. As a sign of good sportsmanship, the Wallaroo captain PM Lane offered Wentworth to pick any player of their choice to ensure the game could be played. The Wentworth captain, W Warbrick, picked AG Fraser from the Randwick club to play for the team. The game was an \\"interesting and determined\\" one with nothing of excitement to note. Wentworth won with ease with Wallaroo lacking in aggressive tendencies. The defeated team never looked likely to score.

These are the first edicts in the Indian language of Emperor Ashoka, written in the Brahmi script in the 11th year of his reign.

Yailenko Les maximes delphiques d'A√Ø Khanoum et la formation de la doctrine du dharma d'Asoka Dialogues d'histoire ancienne vol.16 n¬∞1, 1990, p.243 There are several slight variations in the content of these edicts, depending on location, but a common designation is usually used, with Minor Rock Edict N¬∞1 (MRE1)Minor Rock Edict 1 and a Minor Rock Edict N¬∞2 (MRE2, which does not appear alone but always in combination with Edict N¬∞1), the different versions being generally aggregated in most translations. There is also a minor edict No.3, discovered in Bairat, for the Buddhist clergy.Inscriptions of Asoka by DC Sircar p.32-22 The inscriptions of Ashoka in Greek or Aramaic are sometimes also categorized as \\"Minor Rock Edicts\\".  Chronology  The Minor Rock Edicts were written quite early in the reign of Ashoka, from the 11th year of his reign at the earliest (according to his own inscription, \\"two and a half years after becoming a secular Buddhist\\", i.e. two and a half years at least after the Kalinga conquest of the eighth year of his reign, which is the starting point for his gradual conversion to Buddhism). The technical quality of the engraving of the inscriptions is generally very poor, and generally very inferior to the pillar edicts dated to the years 26 and 27 of Ashoka's reign.John Irwin, \\"The True Chronology of A≈õokan Pillars\\", in:Artibus Asiae, Vol. 44, No. 4 (1983), The Minor Rock Edicts therefore follow the very first inscription of Ashoka, written in year 10 of his reign, the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription established at Chilzina, Kandahar, in the center of Afghanistan.Valeri P. Yailenko Les maximes delphiques d'A√Ø Khanoum et la formation de la doctrine du dharma d'Asoka Dialogues d'histoire ancienne vol.16 n¬∞1, 1990, pp.239-256 This first inscription was written in Classical Greek and Aramaic exclusively. The Minor Rock Edicts maybe slightly earlier than the Major Rock Edicts established to propagate the Dharma, from the 12th year of Ashoka's reign.Ashoka: The Search for India's Lost Emperor by Charles Allen These Ashoka inscriptions are in Indian languages with the exception of the Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka inscribed on a limestone stele. It was only later, during the 26th and 27th years of his reign, that Ashoka wrote new edicts, this time on majestic columns, the pillars of Ashoka. Text of the Minor Rock Edicts The different variations of edicts on rock 1 and 2 are usually presented in the form of a compilation.A translation of the Edicts of Ashoka p.259 There is also a minor edict on Rock No.3, discovered in Bairat only, addressing not the Ashoka officers as the first two edicts, but the Buddhist clergy, with the recommendation to study a very specific list of Buddhist scriptures.\\"At Bairat, a third Minor Rock Edict of Asoka was also found besides the version of Minor Rock Edict I ... \\"in DC Sircar's Inscriptions of Asoka p.32\\" In the Minor Rock Edicts, Ashoka makes explicit mention of his religious affiliation by presenting himself as a \\"lay disciple\\" or \\"disciple of the Buddha\\" according to the versions, and speaking of his proximity to \\"the order\\" (samgha), which is far from the case in most other edicts where he is only promulgating the moral laws of \\"Dharma\\". ;Association of Ashoka with the title \\"Devanampriya\\" (\\"Beloved-of-the-Gods\\") The Maski inscription confirmed the association of the title \\"Devanampriya\\" with \\"Asoka\\", both readable in the first line. \\"DevƒÅna·πÉpiyasa Asoka\\", honorific Devanampiya (\\"Beloved of the God\\", in the adjectival form -sa) and name of Ashoka, in Brahmi script, in the Maski Edict of Ashoka. There are slight variations between each of the versions of the Minor Rock Edicts. The Maski version of Minor Rock Edict No.1 was historically especially important in that it confirmed the association of the honorific title \\"Devanampriya\\" with Ashoka: In the Gujarra Minor Rock Edict also, the name of Ashoka is used together with his titles: \\"Devanampiya Piyadasi Asokaraja\\". ;Pre-existence of pillars In the Minor Rock Edicts, Ashoka also mentions the duty to inscribe his edicts on the rocks and on the pillars (\\"wherever there is a pillar or rock\\"). This has led some authors, especially John Irwin, to think that there were already pillars in India before Ashoka erected them. For John Irwin, examples today of these pillars prior to Ashoka would be the bull pillar of Rampurva, the elephant pillar of Sankissa, and the Allahabad pillar of Ashoka.John Irwin, \\"The true chronology of Ashokan pillars\\", p.147 None of these pillars received the inscription of the Minor Rock Edicts, and only the pillar of Allahabad has inscriptions of Ashoka, which weakens this theory, since, according to the orders of the same of Ashoka, they should have been engraved with his Minor Rock Edicts. ;Language of the edicts Several edicts of Ashoka are known in Greek and Aramaic; by contrast the many minor edicts on rock engraved in southern India in Karnataka use the Prakrit of the North as the language of communication, with the Brahmi script, and not the local Dravidian idiom, which can be interpreted as a kind of intrusion and authoritarianism in respect to the southern territories.A Sourcebook of Indian Civilization published by Niharranjan Ray, Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya p.592 Full texts of the Minor Rock Edicts ;Minor Rock Edict No.1 In this Edict, Ashoka describes himself as a Buddhist layman (UpƒÅsaka)The term Upasaka (Buddhist layman) is used in most inscriptions. /a Buddha-≈öakaMaski inscription /a Saka,Rupnath inscription and also explains he has been getting closer to the Samgha and has become more ardent in the faith. { class = \\" center\\" + Minor Rock Edict No.1 (conflated versions) - ! scope = \\"col\\" align=center English translation !!

The inscriptions of the Barabar Caves are purely dedicatory, without moral content. {class = \\" center\\" + Inscriptions often included in the \\"Minor Rock Edicts\\" ! scope = \\"col\\" width = \\"10%\\"  Name !! scope = \\"col\\"  Location !!scope=\\"col\\"Map!! scope = \\"col\\"  Overview !! scope = \\"col\\"  Rock !! scope = \\"col\\"  Rubbing/ Close-up - Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription  Chil- Zena Hill, Kandahar, Afghanistan Original bilingual Greek-Aramaic edition, sort of a summary or introduction of the Edicts of Ashoka.

It connects journalists for the purpose of seeking and offering help, whether in the form of story collaboration, local advice or accommodation. Hostwriter was founded in Hamburg, Germany, in 2013 by German journalists Tamara Anthony, Tabea Grzeszyk and Sandra Zistl. Because these co-founders knew the difficulties journalists faced when trying to network across their city, or even their country, they built a platform that would make it easier. The idea for the organization grew from co-founder Tabea Grzeszyk's experience using CouchSurfing for her trip to Turkey, Lebanon and Syria in 2010. She thought it would be useful if a journalist covering a story could not just travel to a different region or country, but could, at the same time, make contact with local journalists who could answer questions and make the research process easier or add a local perspective to the research. Co-founder Tamara Anthony says the key idea is that journalists \\"collaborate rather than compete,\\" and that through collaboration, journalists can serve \\"as a door opener\\" for colleagues from outside their region. Co-founder Sandra Zistl said the network is especially important to independent journalists and documentary filmmakers, particularly in countries without a \\"journalistic infrastructure\\" that ensures the freedom of the press. The organization's office is located in Berlin, and the platform itself has more than 3,800 journalists from 136 countries worldwide (as of November 2018).  Programs  Hostwriter offers several programs for journalists at all career levels.  Training Programs  Hostwriter's mission is to improve cross-border collaborations among journalists. The organization provides training in cross-border journalism, following the guidelines laid out in Brigitte Alfter's book, Handbuch zum Cross-Border-Journalismus (Handbook for Cross-Border Journalism). Hostwriter also organizes events such as panel discussions at the New York Times Athens Democracy Forum and the International Journalism Festival in Perugia.  The Agora Project  With funding from Advocate Europe,Advocate Europe is \\"an idea challenge for European initiatives\\" that calls for \\"unconventional and transnational ideas that respond to Europe's present challenges.\\" https://advocate-europe.eu/about/ Hostwriter teamed up with Armenian Changemakers on the Agora Project, which established a temporary newsroom for ten young journalists from Croatia, Spain, Greece, Germany, Serbia, Italy, Great Britain, Austria, and Portugal. The journalists collaborated on stories about the biggest challenges facing Europe ahead of the 2017 European elections, including migration and citizenship rights, political polarization, and the threat robots pose to human jobs. The resulting stories were posted in The Agora Project Dossier in late 2017. According to an article by MediaShift, the reporters covered stories about a variety of issues including immigration, automation, and populism. \\"In Serbia, Stefan Janjiƒá spoke to young men about the role of religion in an area of recent upheaval. C»ßtia Bruno reported on how working-class communities in Portugal cling to history in the face of increasing populism across Europe. Daniela Sala went to Sweden to speak to asylum seekers stuck in the system with no clear options. And Sissy Gkournelou looked at issues of trust in the media in Greece and Germany.\\" Hostwriter plans to repeat the program, organizing a cross-border collaboration project on every continent with the use of funding awarded through the Google Impact Challenge Germany 2018.  Hostwriter Prizes  Starting in 2014, Hostwriter has awarded annual prizes for \\"collaborative journalism pieces, as well as promising story pitches.\\" The prizes are donated by the German Otto-Sprenger Stiftung (foundation)Otto Sprenger Stiftung (foundation) supports the advancement of young and emerging journalists. http://ottosprenger.org and come with a monetary award and publicity for the winning stories.

The second named storm and first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl formed from a vigorous tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on July 1. The wave quickly organized into a tropical depression over the central Atlantic by July 4. Rapid intensification took place and it quickly became a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC the next day. Just less than 15 hours later, on July 6, Beryl strengthened into the first hurricane of the season, reaching its peak intensity on July 6. Increasingly unfavorable conditions caused a rapid deterioration of the cyclone shortly after peak, with Beryl falling to tropical storm status on the next day as it began to accelerate towards the Caribbean. Late on July 8, it degenerated into a tropical wave shortly before reaching the Lesser Antilles. The remnants were monitored for several days, although they failed to organize significantly until July 14, when it regenerated into a subtropical storm six days after its initial dissipation. However, the newly-reformed storm quickly lost convection, and it degenerated into a remnant low early on July 16, while over the Gulf Stream. Beryl prompted multiple islands in the Lesser Antilles to issue warnings and watches, including a hurricane watch as it was initially expected to pass through the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe as a hurricane. The storm weakened faster than expected and Beryl degenerated into a tropical wave before it reached the islands, though effects were still felt across the eastern Caribbean. Several areas in the region were recovering from the catastrophic impacts from Hurricanes Irma and Maria during the previous season. Beryl's remnants caused flash flooding and landslides across the island of Puerto Rico and caused several schools to close; approximately 47,000 lost power on the island. However, overall damage was minimal and no fatalities were attributed to the storm. Meteorological history A vigorous tropical wave with a large amount of convection, or thunderstorms, moved off the coast of Africa on July 1. However, most of the convective activity diminished as it moved west-southwestwards. Late on July 3, the NHC began tracking this disturbance while it was over the eastern tropical Atlantic for tropical cyclone development. The wave quickly organized over the next two days, with a concentrated area of thunderstorms over the low-level center and rainbands developing over the southern side of the disturbance. At 12:00 UTC on July 4, the wave organized into a tropical depression about 1,500 miles (1,300 nautical miles) west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. At 00:00 UTC on July 5, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl while located at ; this was farther southeast than any other Atlantic cyclone on record so early in the calendar year. Due to its very small size, it was prone to very quick changes in intensity, as a mid-level eye becoming apparent as the system was consolidating on July 5. Indeed, overnight the cyclone underwent a period of rapid intensification as a pinhole eye became visible and became a hurricane at 09:00 UTC July 6 ‚Äì the second earliest in the tropical Atlantic on record, behind the 1933 Trinidad hurricane, and the easternmost pre-August Atlantic hurricane on record to have formed from a tropical wave. Throughout the day the strengthening leveled off, and the eye later disappeared from satellite view, though Beryl maintained its intensity. By early on July 7, however, dry air began to infiltrate the core of the hurricane, causing its center to become exposed, and Beryl soon weakened back to a tropical storm. This trend of rapid weakening continued as wind shear increased upon the system. Beryl's structure continued to decay as the storm accelerated west- northwestward, and by late on July 8, Beryl had degenerated into an open trough while located just 60 miles northeast of Martinique. The NHC opted to continue advisories, however, as it was impacting Dominica, discontinuing them afterwards. Subtropical Storm Beryl at its secondary peak intensity on July 14 The remnants of Beryl, while being monitored by the NHC for potential redevelopment, continued moving westward into the eastern Caribbean, eventually slowing and moving ashore in the Dominican Republic with gale-force winds. Strong upper-level winds prevented any redevelopment of the remnants of Beryl for several days as it moved across the island and as it passed through the Bahamas into the Western Atlantic. By July 13, however, conditions became slightly more favorable for redevelopment, and the remnants of Beryl spawned a new circulation near the associated thunderstorms, though the remnants remained too disorganized for redevelopment. The circulation became well- defined early on July 14, and due to influence from a baroclinic trough, thunderstorms developed and persisted near the storm's center, with gale-force winds detected east of the center; after continued reorganization, Beryl was re-designated as a subtropical storm at 17:00 UTC that day, while located well off the East Coast of the United States. However, the rejuvenated storm soon began to weaken as nearby dry air intruded and weakened showers and thunderstorms associated with the storm, and impinging northwesterly shear further served to remove thunderstorm activity. By July 15, Beryl consisted mostly of a low to mid-level swirl of shallow clouds continuing on a northeastward course. After lacking thunderstorm activity near the center for twelve hours, Beryl degenerated into a remnant low at 03:00 UTC on July 16. Beryl's remnant low was subsequently absorbed into another extratropical storm over Newfoundland on the next day. Preparations and impact Lesser Antilles Hurricane Chris appearing off of the United States East Coast On July 6, the Government of France issued a tropical storm watch for its overseas collective Saint Barth√©lemy. On July 7, the Government of France issued a tropical storm watch for Guadeloupe and its overseas collective Saint Martin in the Leeward Islands. In preparation for the hurricane's arrival, the Government of Barbados issued a hurricane watch for Dominica in the Windward Islands and a tropical storm watch for Barbados in the Lesser Antilles on July 6. At the same time, the Government of St. Lucia issued a tropical storm watch for St. Lucia. Earlier, France had issued a tropical storm watch for Martinique, also in the Windward Islands. The next day, the Government of Barbados replaced the hurricane watch with a tropical storm warning as Beryl weakened before making landfall. Heavy rains and strong winds impacted Guadeloupe as the remnants of Beryl moved through the Lesser Antilles. Rainfall peaked at in Saint-Claude; wind gusts averaged island-wide with a peak of in Le Moule. The resulting damage was limited, with some trees and power lines downed and localized flooding from runoff. Puerto Rico Preliminary rainfall totals for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The darker the color, the more rain that fell. Flash flood watches and warnings were issued for most of the island of Puerto Rico by the National Weather Service in San Juan. On July 6, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossell√≥, issued a state of emergency for the island, amid concerns that enhanced rainfall from Beryl or its remnants could lead to flash floods and mudslides, damaging infrastructure that was still recovering from Hurricanes Irma and Maria from the previous season. The governor said the government opened 42 shelters for citizens to obtain relief from Beryl due to the demand of mayors around the territory. However, due to the effects of previous hurricane Irma and Maria, many homes were without roofs. Over 60,000 people had blue tarps provided by FEMA as temporary roofs, however, tarps were easily blown off due to strong wind gusts from Beryl's remnants. In the wake of July 10, approximately 24,000 Puerto Ricans lost power on the island as a result of gusty winds and flooding from Beryl's remnants. Rainfall was the heaviest in Eastern Puerto Rico, where over 8 inches of rain fell. The enhanced rainfall also triggered flash flooding that closed several roadways and downed several trees. A landslide was reported in the town of Naranjito, although there were no reports of fatalities or injuries. Dominican Republic Heavy rainfall caused by the remnants of Beryl flooded hundreds of homes in the Dominican Republic. Countrywide, the Emergency Operations Center reported that the floods left around 7,930 people homeless. In addition, 19 communities were reported isolated due to flooding, 1,586 homes were damage, with four destroyed, and three bridges were damaged. The floods left 130,000 people and the capital city of Santo Domingo without power. In San Crist√≥bal Province, the worst hit areas included the Municipality of Villa Altagracia, and other areas near the Haina River. The Haina River overflowed, causing flooding up to roof height in some areas such as Manoguayabo, where emergency rescues were carried out.http://floodlist.com/america/dominican-republic-puerto-rico-beryl- floods-july-2018 See also * Other tropical cyclones named Beryl * List of Category 1 Atlantic hurricanes * List of Hispaniola hurricanes * Hurricane Joyce (2000) ‚Äì Low-latitude Category 1 hurricane that threatened similar areas. * Tropical Storm Erika (2009) - affected similar areas also as a tropical wave. * Hurricane Danny (2015) ‚Äì Another small, rapidly-developing tropical cyclone.

It is a resident breeder in the tropical New World from eastern Peru to western Bolivia. It was considered a subspecies of the russet antshrike, but was split in 2018 due to vocal and plumage differences. It is a bird of forest, old second growth, semi-open woodland and edges. The female lays two brown-speckled white eggs in a deep cup nest high in a tree, usually in a semi-open location. Nest-building, incubation, and care of the young are shared by both sexes. The rufescent antshrike feeds on insects and other arthropods, which it gleans from foliage like a vireo. It may be seen alone, in pairs, or with tanagers and warblers in mixed-species feeding flocks.

It was built from 1845 to 1850. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The original-five roomed cottage was built probably between 1845 and 1850 on of land granted in 1840 to George Hall. This original section of Rosedale Cottage is of brick construction, built up from a sandstone base course. Sandstone quoins have been used at the corners and reveals to openings. The heads and sills are also made of sandstone. The verandah is sandstone, flagged on a sandstone base course. The roof structure is timber which was originally shingled and later covered with corrugated iron. The eaves have a fascia and boxed soffit of boards with a ventilation space. Internal walls are construction of brick, which are plastered and papered. The floors are timber boards and ceilings include metal tiles and sheets, lath and plaster, fibrous plaster, and tongue and groove boarding. The property was acquired in 1883 by William Wilson, whose family owned the property until 1935 and it was during this period of occupation the major changes occurred at Rosedale. The family was large and apparently prosperous, employed several servants and entertained a great deal. During the period, the family donated the southern part of the property for a park, known as \\"Wilson Park\\" and land for the \\"Wilson Memorial Hospital\\". Most of the extensions and renovations appear to have been carried out during this time. The two major additions were of timber-framed construction on wooden stumps. The first extension (probably in the 1890s) is thought to be the bay window which enlarges the room, apparently used as a sitting room. The dining room was added, together with the middle verandah. The kitchen block was connected to the dining room by a covered way. The second addition, the eastern wing, was thought to have been built about 1901. The detached timber building just north of the new dining room was built beside the kitchen block and used as a dormitory by the five sons. It was known as the boy's room. Other buildings include meat house near the old dining room fireplace, an office east of the boys' room, a dairy room and a small room known as \\"the factory\\" which was used for making preserves. Further to the north were a hayshed, a shed for two or three buggies, stables, a woolshed, milking bails, poultry shed and associated stockyards. During the Wilson ownership there was a pleasant garden with grapevine trellises at the rear and along the verandah of the eastern wing, a fernery north of the sitting room, a flower garden near the eastern wing and the boys' room, and a vegetable garden near the well. There were fruit trees west of the buildings and an orchard over near Little Street. One approaches the homestead along the present access road and came through a big gate into the big space in the north western corner of the group of buildings. A picket fence ran from the kitchen being northwards towards the sheds and a line of trees ran along here (the present row of kurrajongs). There were no palm trees at that time but the pine tree at the south west corner was there. The river flats south of the house (new parkland) were planted with lucerne at that time and there was apparently no fence near the house on its southern side. W. A. Wilson died in 1913. After Emelie Wilson's (his wife's) death in 1923, or 1928, the house was occupied by her daughter Muriel until the property was sold in 1935. A major subdivision occurred in 1930 reducing the property to . The Parkin family bought the property. During their ownership, a new kitchen and entrance was built between the dining room and the bay window room and the earlier kitchen block was demolished. The small bedroom in the old brick part of the house was converted to a bathroom. The eastern wing was converted int a self-contained flat. The western end of the boys' room was converted into a laundry and a new meathouse was built just north of the boys' room. Palm trees were planted during this period.

It premiered at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna on 20 February 1903 with Alexander Girardi in the title role. Background Eysler's operetta takes its name and the personality of its protagonist from the popular fictional figure \\"Bruder Straubinger\\", a travelling craftsman from Straubing who first appeared in an early 19th century student drinking song by Carl Theodor M√ºller, a medical student in Straubing. The character became the archetype of an industrious but carefree and cheerful wanderer. Bruder Straubinger was the second of Eysler's operettas to be staged. He had composed a previous opera to a libretto by Ignaz Schnitzer with the title Der Hexenspiel (The Magic Mirror). The music publisher was impressed with it and tried unsuccessfully to get it staged. He then suggested that Eysler incorporate some of the lighter pieces from the work into a new operetta. The result was Bruder Straubinger which was an immediate success at its premiere, owing in part to its star tenor, Alexander Girardi, in the title role. However, Richard Traubner attributes a larger part of its success to Girardi's second-act waltz aria \\"K√ºssen ist keine S√ºnd\\" (\\"Kissing Is No sin\\"). The song was published separately by Weinberger and in a short time sold more than 100,000 copies. It later inspired the title of the 1950 German film Kissing Is No Sin and is featured in its soundtrack. Recordings A full-length recording of Bruder Straubinger was released on CD by Cantus Classics in 2017. Recorded live in 1951 by the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Fritz Mareczek, it features Willy Reichert in the title role and Olga Noll as Oculi. (Catalog number: LC 502014) Its most famous aria, \\"K√ºssen ist keine S√ºnd\\", has been recorded by Richard Tauber and Hermann Prey, amongst others.

The original 1934 building was a small frame rectangular building with a small portico. The interior consisted of a single classroom. In 1940 two school buildings of three rooms, from a closed school, were attached to the left and to the right of the original one. In 1953 another classroom was added to the rear. In the mid 1950s a kitchen/cafeteria was added to the south side of the building. with eight photos and three maps With .

When Artemisia was only seventeen, her neighbor‚Äîan older woman named Tuzia‚Äîlet Tassi into Artemisia‚Äôs home through an adjoining door. There, he raped his student, while Artemisia called out for help. Artemisia‚Äôs father, Orazio Gentileschi, sued Agostino Tassi for taking his only daughter‚Äôs virginity. During the trial, Artemisia recounts the altercation with Tassi and her effort to defend herself, stating ‚ÄúAfter he had done his business he got off of me.

Built in 1780, it was a good example of a late 18th- century Cape style residence. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. It collapsed and was demolished in 2008. Description and history The Joseph Blakeslee House stood at the northeast corner of Barnes Road (Connecticut Route 68) and Research Parkway in northeastern Wallingford. The parcel which it stood is nearly surrounded by commercial development. It was a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It was oriented facing east, with a low stone retaining wall in front. Its main facade was three bays wide, with a center entrance that was once topped by a four-light transom window. The trim at the building corners and around the window and door openings was simple. The interior followed a fairly typical period central chimney plan, although the place typically occupied by a staircase in the entrance vestibule contained a closet. The staircase to the attic was located in the rear of the house, between the kitchen and buttery. With The house was built in 1780 by Joseph Blakeslee, a veteran of the French and Indian War. He was forced to sell it soon afterward, apparently suffering economically from the ongoing American Revolutionary War. The property was bought back into the family by his son in 1793, who was a farmer of middling success. The farm remained in the Blakeslee family until 1900, when it was bought by the Barnes family. The bulk of the farm was sold for development in 1963, the house parcel remaining set off and eventually acquired by the local historical society. At the time of its National Register listing in 1998, it was in deteriorated condition, with its roof in imminent failure. It subsequently collapsed and was demolished in 2008.

The mechanism was first proposed in the 1970s and was quickly identified as a means by which even gradual anthropogenic warming could lead to relatively rapid sea level rise. In Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Aurora Subglacial Basin, and the Wilkes Basin are each grounded below sea level and are inherently subject to MISI. General The term marine ice sheet describes an ice sheet whose base rests on ground below sea level, and marine ice sheet instability describes the inherent precarious nature of marine ice sheets due to Archimedes' principle. Because seawater is denser than ice, marine ice sheets can only remain stable where the ice is thick enough for its mass to exceed the mass of the seawater displaced by the ice. In other words, wherever ice exists below sea level, it is held in place only by the weight of overlying ice. As a marine ice sheet melts, the weight of the overlying ice decreases. If melt causes thinning beyond a critical threshold, the overlying ice may no longer be heavy enough to prevent the submarine ice below it from lifting off the ground, allowing water to penetrate underneath. The location of the grounding line, the boundary between the ice sheet and the floating ice shelves, is unstable in this case. The amount of ice flowing over the grounding line initially matches the production of ice from snow upstream. When the grounding line is pushed backwards, due to for instance melt by warm water, the ice sheet is thicker at the new location of the grounding line and the total amount of ice flowing through may increase. (This depends on the slope of the subaerial surface.) As this causes the ice sheet to lose mass, the grounding line is pushed back even further and this self-reinforcing mechanism is the cause of the instability. Ice sheets of this type have accelerated ice sheet retreat. Strictly speaking the MISI theory is only valid if the ice shelves are free floating and not constrained in an embayment. The initial perturbation or push-back of the grounding line might be caused by high water temperatures at the base of ice shelves so that melt increases (basal melt). The thinned ice shelves, which earlier stabilized the ice sheet, exert less of an buttressing effect (back stress).  Marine Ice Cliff Instability  A related process known as Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI) posits that due to the physical characteristics of ice, subaerial ice cliffs exceeding ~90 meters in height are likely to collapse under their own weight, and could lead to runaway ice sheet retreat in a fashion similar to MISI. For an ice sheet grounded below sea level with an inland-sloping bed, ice cliff failure removes peripheral ice, which then exposes taller, more unstable ice cliffs, further perpetuating the cycle of ice front failure and retreat. Surface melt can further enhance MICI through ponding and hydrofracture. Ocean warming Schematic of stratification and precipitation amplifying feedbacks. Stratification: increased freshwater flux reduces surface water density, thus reducing AABW formation, trapping NADW heat, and increasing ice shelf melt. Precipitation: increased freshwater flux cools ocean mixed layer, increases sea ice area, causing precipitation to fall before it reaches Antarctica, reducing ice sheet growth and increasing ocean surface freshening. Ice in West Antarctica and the Wilkes Basin, East Antarctica, is most vulnerable because of the instability of retrograde beds. According to a 2016 published study, cold meltwater provides cooling of the ocean's surface layer, acting like a lid, and also affecting deeper waters by increasing subsurface ocean warming and thus facilitating ice melt. Another theory discussed in 2007 for increasing warm bottom water is that changes in air circulation patterns have led to increased upwelling of warm, deep ocean water along the coast of Antarctica and that this warm water has increased melting of floating ice shelves. An ocean model has shown how changes in winds can help channel the water along deep troughs on the sea floor, toward the ice shelves of outlet glaciers. Observations In West Antarctica, the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers have been identified to be potentially prone to MISI, and both glaciers have been rapidly thinning and accelerating in recent decades. In East Antarctica, Totten Glacier is the largest glacier known to be subject to MISI and its sea level potential is comparable to that of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Totten Glacier has been losing mass nearly monotonically in recent decades, suggesting rapid retreat is possible in the near future, although the dynamic behavior of Totten Ice Shelf is known to vary on seasonal to interannual timescales. The Wilkes Basin is the only major submarine basin in Antarctica that is not thought to be sensitive to warming.

The painting depicts a nude female figure representing \\"Inclination,\\" or inborn creative ability. Seated on a cloud, she holds a mariner's compass and is guided by a star above. The figure's features are similar to those in self-portraits in Gentileschi's oeuvre. The figure's nudity proved to be embarrassing to the commissioner's great-nephew Leonardo di Buonarroto, and he commissioned Baldassarre Franceschini, known as el Volterrano to paint clothes over parts of it in 1684.

The work shows the moment that the Christian martyr Januarius and his followers are thrown to a group of wild animals in the amphitheatre in Pozzuoli - however, they lick the saint's feet rather than attacking him and Januarius is unharmed. Along with Saints Proculus and Nicea and Adoration of the Magi, the painting of Januarius was commissioned from her for the choir of Pozzuoli Cathedral. The amphitheatre and figures in the background were painted by one (or more) of Gentileschi's collaborators from Rome. The paintings now hang in their original place in the cathedral, although for a time after fire damage in the 1960s they were curated by the Museo di Capodimonte in nearby Naples. The fire in 1964 damaged some of the painting, although restorations have partially rectified the damage, and revealed Gentileschi's signature beneath the tail of the lion.  Patronage  On the appointment of a new bishop in 1631, the cathedral of Pozzuoli underwent significant renovations. Gentileschi's painting was one of three she was commissioned to execute for placement above the cathedral's choir stalls. The Adoration of the Magi, and Saints Proculus and Nicea are also still in place in the cathedral. It is likely that existing contacts of Gentileschi, such as the Viceroy of Naples (Manuel de Acevedo y Zuniga), helped secure the commission for her.  Story  Januarius was an early Christian from the third- and fourth-century. He was made Bishop of Naples (where he is still the patron saint) and his protection of Christians raised the ire of the Roman Emperor Diocletian. According to his hagiographers Januarius was arrested, and then survived various attempts to kill him. Gentileschi here portrays one of those attempts, where the saint was thrown into the amphitheatre in Pozzuoli. Diocletian expected him to be attacked by the wild animals, but Gentileschi portrays the moment that the lion and bear are tamed, and with great docility show their obedience to the Bishop. The figure kneeling at the bottom left is Proculus, the deacon of Pozzuoli, who like Januarius would also be martyred.  Critical Reception  Art historians have noted that the style has less of the drama associated with the her earlier paintings, naming it \\"a balanced and conservative composition.\\" Others have pointed to the need to use a particular tone that would be fitting with the other paintings created for the renovation of the cathedral - this would have obliged Gentileschi to work in a slightly more muted style.

Probably built c. 1730, it is one of Branford's handful of surviving 18th-century houses. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Timothy Bradley House is located west of Branford's center, on the north side of Bradley Street, between North Harbor and Main Streets in the Canoe Brook Historic District. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a frieze and projecting cornice. Windows are placed symmetrically around the entrance, and are simply trimmed. With The exact construction date of the house is not known. Based on stylistic architectural evidence suggestive of the late Second Period of colonial architecture, architectural historian J. Frederick Kelly assigned it a date of about 1730. This would be consistent with being built not long after the marriage of Rachel Swaine (daughter of the landowner at the time) to Joseph Browne. The property was acquired by Timothy Bradley in 1778, and remained in that family for over a century.

Queen Mother's Maternity Hospital closure On 9 December 2003, in an interview with The Scotsman, in relation to the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde board to move the Queen Mother's Maternity Hospital, with its maternity unit and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus on the Southside of Glasgow, Professor Cockburn who vehemently opposed the move, stated: :manifest nonsense to move the hospital and the only reason to close was to save money. Cockburn further stated: :They are going to destroy 40 years of work building up Yorkhill as a unique centre for treating mothers and babies. If the Queen Mother's closes, they will destroy Yorkhill‚Äôs service for very young babies. Neonatologists - the doctors who treat them - will scatter. No neonatologist will stay at a hospital where babies are not born. They will not be able to keep up their skill and expertise. Bibliography Cockburn has written more than 200 books and articles.

His mother leaves the family, and Alex's closest friend Anna moves to Stockholm. Alex decides to leave his father and moves to a relative. Ten years later, Alex lives in Stockholm and is now a famous pianist. During Midsummer, there are multiple explosions in Stockholm. Alex splits with his manager and decides to go back to his home village to buy the church piano he and Anna used to play on when they were younger. There, Alex meets Anna again who has moved back to the village. The attacks on Sweden worsen to include people recklessly driving and crashing cars in the rainy summer. The electricity and mobile networks are hit and become unavailable. At the same time in Alex's home village, his father Bj√∂rn fights off armed men from entering a restricted area with access to the electricity network. Civilians come there to seek safety in the bombshelter, including Alex and Anna. They have contact with the military via radio and go to meet them in the village church. Helicopters shoot at them, but Bj√∂rn takes down a helicopter from his airplane, saving Alex and Anna, however Bj√∂rn's airplane crashes. The film ends with a scene in the village church, which has been destroyed and is on fire. Alex stands in the rain facing Anna in the shelter of the church, apparently having lost his recent memory due to the chemical weapons in the rain. Anna is taken away by the military. The very last clip of the film features Putin ‚Äì suggesting that Russia were behind the attacks.

The lamp was mainly popular during the 1960s and 1970s. The lamp was originally used by doctors and dentists, and later became more widely used. The brand was manufactured by the Tensor Corporation. History The first Tensor lamp consisted of assembling together a 12-volt automobile parking light bulb and reflector made from an ordinary kitchen measuring cup. Monroe fixed the cup to a metal tube that was attached to a transformer, which reduced 115-volt house current to 12 volts. Because of the small bulb, the entire lamp could be made smaller with a light-directing shade. The main competitor to Tensor's high-intensity and low voltage lamp during the 1960s was the similarly looking Lampette brand of lamps manufactured by Koch Creations.

That year, it was recognised for negotiating purposes by the Postmaster General, but the union's journal was consistently critical of Post Office policies and, as a result, recognition was withdrawn in 1909. Following an agreement to stop publishing critical articles, recognition was reinstated.

The explosion occurred on the ground floor of the left wing of the palace and caused damage within an 80 meter radius. Many statues and priceless paintings were damaged, including an entire gallery and several pieces of Napoleonic art, and a wide hole was opened in the ceiling. The bomb caused millions of francs in damage. The Hall of Mirrors, opera house and chapel were undamaged. One night guard was wounded. Aftermath and convictions French Minister of Culture Jean-Philippe Lecat said the bombing evokes an \\"absolutely heinous criminal side\\" of the Breton nationalists. Hubert Landais, the director of French museums at the time, called the attack a \\"real catastrophe.\\" The Breton Democratic Union also condemned the attack. After the bombing, restoration works commenced costing 3 million francs. The Battaile room was finally re- opened to the public in April 1982. Both the FLB and the Armed Nuclei for Popular Autonomy claimed responsibility, but police later found that it was the Breton group that caused it. The two perpetrators were FLB members Lionel Chenevi√®re and Padrig Montauzier, who placed the bomb the day before. The two were already under surveillance by authorities in Rennes, and were arrested the next day. They were given a 15 year prison sentence in November 1978. Following the election of Fran√ßois Mitterrand as President in 1981, they were pardoned as part of Mitterrand's plans to give in to some of the demands of the Breton regional government.Henry et Lagadec 2008, p. 264. The attack came in the context of renewed terrorist activity by the FLB from 1976 targeting cultural property in protest against the signing of the Breton Cultural Charter. The group were trying to 'punish' the French state for its annexation of the former-independent Brittany region. The FLB's activities were usually confined to Brittany itself. German tabloid Die Welt later said no reasonable French wants the state to grant independence to peripheral provinces, \\"nor Brittany, nor Alsace, nor Occitania.\\"Henry et Lagadec 2008, p. 208.

In the span of 5 hours and 26 minutes during the late morning and early afternoon of 23 November 1981, 104 confirmed tornadoes touched down across Wales and central, northern and eastern England. Although the majority of tornadoes were very weak, measuring FU-F1 on the Fujita scale, widespread property damage was reported, mainly from the small number of tornadoes which intensified to F2 strength. By the end of the outbreak, hundreds of properties across the country had been damaged. Most of the tornadoes occurred in rural areas and small villages across central parts of the United Kingdom, although several large metropolitan areas were affected. The Liverpool area was the first to be struck by multiple tornadoes around 11:30, followed by the Manchester area around 12:00, the Hull area around 13:30 and the Birmingham area around 14:00. The strongest tornado of the outbreak, an F2 tornado, struck Holyhead in Anglesey, Wales at 10:30; the only other F2 tornado of the outbreak caused considerable damage in the village of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire around 14:00. With 104 tornadoes, this single-day outbreak alone saw more confirmed tornadoes than any other whole year in British history ‚Äì 1974 previously held the record, with 80 tornadoes across the whole year. At the time of the 1981 outbreak, there had only been one other tornado outbreak in recorded history which produced more than 100 tornadoes within 24 hours, that being the 1974 Super Outbreak in the United States. However, that outbreak included many more powerful tornadoes and resulted in hundreds of fatalities.  Meteorological background  On 22 November 1981, a rapidly deepening low-pressure extratropical cyclone was centred just off the northern coast of Scotland. The central pressure of this system was 994 mbar at 12:00 GMT on 22 November, deepening to 968 mbar by 12:00 GMT on 23 November. At the same time, a high-pressure anticyclone was pushing into southern England from mainland Europe. There was an unusually strong upper-level temperature gradient between the low- and high-pressure systems, with the low-pressure system funnelling in cold, arctic air from the north, clashing with humid, subtropical air moving up from southern Europe in the anticyclone. During the morning of 23 November, a cold front attached to the southern edge of the low-pressure area began to cross the United Kingdom from west to east. Fuelled by this temperature gradient and warm subtropical air to the south, a number of supercell thunderstorms became embedded within the southern edge of the cold front and its pre-frontal rain bands, spawning the first tornadoes over Wales by around 10:30 GMT. By mid-afternoon, 104 tornadoes had been confirmed across the United Kingdom. Several days after the tornado outbreak, the high-pressure anticyclone to the south of the British Isles broke down, allowing colder arctic air to move in from the north, resulting in the start of a record-breaking cold wave.

History The union was founded in 1890. It was named after Henry Fawcett, who it considered had been sympathetic to workers when he was Postmaster General. For most of its existence, the union's general secretary was Wallace Bligh Cheesman, and its chairman was William E. Clery. They were sacked from the Post Office after they circulated information about candidates in the 1892 UK general election, and attempted to get them to express support for the union. However, Cheesman remained the union's secretary throughout its existence. Cheesman decided to work closely with other unions, and in 1893, the Fawcett Association became the first clerical union to affiliate to the Trades Union Congress. It also joined the United Government Workers' Federation, and formed the National Joint Committee of Postal and Telegraph Associations in 1897, with the Postmen's Federation, Postal and Telegraph Clerks' Association and United Kingdom Postal Clerks' Association. The union was represented at the founding meeting of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC). Clery was adopted as an LRC candidate in 1901, but was also adopted as a Liberal-Labour candidate for Deptford. This proved controversial, and he did not ultimately stand under either label. Membership of the union grew steadily, reaching 3,750 by 1904. The Postal Bagmen's Association and the Women Sorters' Association affiliated to the Fawcett Association in 1906. In 1919, it merged with the Postmen's Federation and the Postal and Telegraph Clerks' Association, forming the Union of Post Office Workers. Leadership General Secretaries :1889: L.

In an area of coverage of her transmitters there is a considerable part of the Rostov agglomeration by the population of 2,2 million people. It includs such large cities as Bataysk, Azov, Aksay.  History  Telecasting era in the territory of the Rostov region began with construction of the Rostov TV tower of 195 meters high. The tower was designed by the Moscow institute of steel structures. Her construction was carried out for two years and was completed on 29 April 1958. Trial telecasts started the next day on 30 April 1958. Transfer of colour telecasting appeared since 1969. In 1992 there was a fire on a tower as a result of which burned out several cables and transformers. Accident has caused the termination of telecasting for 12 hours. The burned- out part of system of the transformer became the reason of it.  Current state  The trellised open-work metal design leans on four concrete support. Sections of a tower are alternately painted in red and white colors. TV tower illumination in night-time is carried out by means of the laser light-emitting diodes. The bright luminescence of a tower is reached by use of fluorescent paint for painting of external elements. The term of operation of the antenna of the Rostov tower was 14 years from the moment of installation. It functions still and wasn't replaced. The main material of the antenna is steel. Metal designs need painting.  Alternatives. Pentashpil.  In 1998 Town-planning council of Rostov-on-Don approved the idea of Rostov citizen Sergey Kivenko who has developed the project of a new city television tower called by Pentashpil. Pentashpil is a 315-meter open-work tower representing five gracefully curved ascending support. But Kivenko's project was closed by city engineering council in March 1999. In 2002 Sergey Kivenko's project \\"Pentashpil complex\\" was resumed.The author created multipurpose \\"Pentashpil- complex\\" around a tower. Serious investors interested in the project.

Due to her fertility, she is made a Handmaid to Commander Fred Waterford and his wife, Serena Joy, and is named \\"Offred\\". Moss was first announced as the lead actress in April 2016.  Commander Fred Waterford  Commander Fred Waterford (portrayed by Joseph Fiennes) is a high-ranking government official, chief diplomatic and Offred's master. Both he and his wife played an instrumental role in Gilead's founding. He wishes to have more contact with June outside of what is lawful between a Handmaid and her master, and starts inviting her to play nightly games of Scrabble. He shows a dissimulating kind personality, often seeming a victim of Gilead, but is cruel and aggressive. He also was responsible for the instauration of Gilead, being one of the leaders of the Sons of Jacob. After Commander Pryce's death he becomes the head of the Council, the Govern of Gilead. This role is comparable to a Prime Minister. Fiennes joined the cast in August 2016.  Serena Joy Waterford  Serena Joy Waterford (portrayed by Yvonne Strahovski) is Fred's wife and a former conservative cultural activist and author of a controversial book, A Woman's Place, which advocates women as second-class citizens who exist merely to be obedient and submissive housewives and mothers, rather than be independent of their menfolk and pursuing careers. She appears to have accepted her new role in the Gilead society that she helped create. She is poised and deeply religious, but is capable of great cruelty and is often callous to June. She is desperate to become a mother, but most men are sterile. Showrunners have said we will see that Serena is actually fertile. Although a friend of Commander Cushing, she denounces him fearing his heavy response to the bombing and his semi- dictatorial power. Strahovski joined the cast in August 2016.  Emily Malek  Emily (portrayed by Alexis Bledel), also referred to as Ofglen and later Ofsteven, is June's shopping partner. Although June is initially wary of her, it is revealed Ofglen is not as pious as she seems and the two become friends. Ofglen had a wife and son and was a university lecturer in cellular biology. Although homosexuality is punishable by death in Gilead and most university professors are sent to labour camps, Ofglen was spared and made a Handmaid due to her fertility. She is later captured and cruelly punished for her homosexual relationship with a Martha and is assigned to another household where she becomes \\"Ofsteven.‚Äù She is involved with a resistance movement called \\"Mayday.‚Äù In season 3 we witness Emily's post traumatic struggles as she escapes Gilead and is reunited with her wife and son in Canada. Bledel was cast in January 2017.  Janine Lindo  Janine (portrayed by Madeline Brewer) is a Handmaid who entered the Red Center for training at the same time as June. She considers June a friend because of her kind treatment. During training, Janine's right eye is removed as a punishment for her initial non- compliance. She reveals a past rape during training and the other Handmaids are forced to tell Janine the abuse was her fault, causing her great emotional harm. She becomes mentally unstable due to her mistreatment and often behaves in temperamental or childlike ways. She is assigned to Warren and Naomi Putnam and becomes ‚ÄúOfwarren.‚Äù She eventually gives birth to a baby girl the Putnams name \\"Angela,‚Äù though Janine insists the baby's name is \\"Charlotte.‚Äù Janine is later reassigned and becomes \\"Ofdaniel.‚Äù She was temporarily assigned to the Colonies until a bombing at the new Rachel and Leah Center. Brewer was cast as Janine in August 2016.  Aunt Lydia  Aunt Lydia (portrayed by Ann Dowd) is in charge of overseeing the Handmaids in their training, sexual reeducation, and duties. She is brutal and subjects insubordinate Handmaids to harsh physical punishment, but she also cares for her charges and believes deeply in the Gileadean mission and doctrine. She appears to have a soft spot for Janine, and even goes so far as to address her by her given name on occasion. She was heavily injured in Season 2. In Season 3, it was revealed in a flashback that her real name is Lydia Clements, and she was an elementary school teacher who taught fourth grade. Dowd was cast in July 2016.  Luke Bankole  Lucas \\"Luke\\" Bankole (portrayed by O. T. Fagbenle) is June's husband from before Gilead. Because he is divorced (he and June began their relationship before his divorce from his first wife), their union is considered invalid in the new society. June is considered an adulteress and their daughter, Hannah, is considered illegitimate. Initially June believes he has been killed, but it is later revealed Luke managed to escape to Canada. Fagbenle was cast in September 2016.  Nick Blaine  Nick Blaine (portrayed by Max Minghella) is Commander Waterford's driver and a former drifter from Michigan who has feelings for June. June and Nick develop an intimate relationship and she eventually discovers that he is an Eye, a spy for Gilead. He carries a high rank with the Eyes, even ordering a Guardian to let off his gun. His direct superior is Commander Pryce, head of Security, who wants him to \\"control Waterford\\" in prevision of further purges of Gilead. He passes then to the leadership of Cushing, which starts a brief authoritarian regime, and then Warren Putnam. Minghella was cast in July 2016.  Moira  Moira (portrayed by Samira Wiley), also referred to as Ruby, is June's best friend since college. She is already at the Red Center when June enters Handmaid training but escapes before being assigned to a home. She is recaptured and becomes \\"Ruby\\", a Jezebel. She seems to have given up hope of ever being free, but on meeting June again regains the conviction to escape. Wiley joined the main cast in July 2016.  Rita  Rita (portrayed by Amanda Brugel) is a Martha at the Waterford home. She had a son who died fighting in the Civil War when he was 19 years old. Rita is part of the resistance and helped June escape with baby Nicole at the end of season 2. Brugel was cast in the recurring role of Rita in September 2016. In August 2017, she was promoted to the main cast for the second season.  Commander Joseph Lawrence  Commander Joseph Lawrence (portrayed by Bradley Whitford) is considered the \\"architect of Gilead's economy,\\" and the creator of the Colonies, as well a gruff and intimidating man with a disheveled mad genius vibe. His sly humor and flashes of kindness make him a confusing, mysterious presence for his newest Handmaid. He shows regrets for his past and could be a member of the Mayday resistance. Whitford joined the recurring cast in February 2018. He was promoted to the main cast for the third season in October 2018.  Recurring characters  The following is a list of guest characters that have recurring roles throughout the series.  Introduced in season 1 * Commander Warren Putnam (portrayed by Stephen Kunken) is a Commander in the Republic of Gilead. He's the husband of Naomi Putnam and the first known Commander of Janine (Ofwarren). He had his left hand amputated by the Council after being found guilty of adultery. He later becomes the right hand of Waterford in the Council itself, and the head of Security after the arrest of Cushing, who had enstablished a semidictatorial regime too violent and exclusive for Gilead. He personally carries out Cushing's arrest \\"on Waterford order\\". * Naomi Putnam (portrayed by Ever Carradine) is Commander Warren Putnam's wife. She views her baby largely as a status symbol and has no sympathy for the Handmaids. Carradine joined the cast in October 2016. *Lillie Fuller (portrayed by Tattiawna Jones), also referred to as Ofglen, is a woman who replaces Emily in the position after Emily is captured by the Eyes. She initially follows the rules and does not wish to upset the status quo, but this is because she believes her life as a Handmaid is better than the difficult, impoverished life she led prior to Gilead, rather than out of religious piety. *Alma (portrayed by Nina Kiri), also referred to as Ofrobert, is another Handmaid who trained at the Red Center with June, Moira, and Janine. She is frank and chatty, and often trades gossip and news with June. She is also involved with Mayday and becomes June's first contact with the resistance group. *Dolores (portrayed by Jenessa Grant), also referred to as Ofsamuel, is a local Handmaid with a friendly and talkative nature. *Briana (portrayed by Bahia Watson), also referred to as Oferic, is another local Handmaid who is friends with June. *Hannah Bankole (portrayed by Jordana Blake) is June and Luke's daughter. She is later renamed Agnes. *Commander Andrew Pryce (portrayed by Robert Curtis Brown). One of the architects of the Sons of Jacob movement. He is a high ranking commander who employs Nick as an Eye, and the head of Security. He gains political power very quickly, eventually becoming head of the Council (Govern) and an influent member in the Committee (Senate). He is later replaced in these roles by Cushing and Waterford, after dying in a terrorist action. He seems a faithful man but proves to be cruel and opportunist. He is also the superior of Nick and wants to \\"purge and clean\\" Gilead. * Beth (portrayed by Kristen Gutoskie) is a Martha at Jezebel's. She has an arrangement with Nick whereby she trades illegal alcohol and other contraband for drugs, which the Jezebels use. She has a casual sexual relationship with him and is aware that he is an Eye. Beth becomes a recurring character in season three as one of the two Martha's working at the Commander Lawrence's household.  Introduced in season 2 * Eden Spencer (portrayed by Sydney Sweeney) is a pious and obedient girl who dreams of one day being a Commander's wife. Sweeney was cast in May 2017. * Commander Ray Cushing (portrayed by Greg Bryk) is a high government official who is friends with the Commanders Pryce, Waterford and Serena. Cushing, his wife and the Waterfords were friends before Gilead and used to travel together. Cushing is pointed out to replace Commander Pryce following the Rachel and Leah Center bombing, thus becoming the head of the Council (Govern) and of Security. He acts like the absolute ruler of Gilead for a while, abusing of his power, but proves to be a cruel tyrant, ordering dozens of random executions even between the other Commanders. He also questions Offred about who aided her when she tried to flee the country. Fearing the possibility of her household being targeted and angry at Cushing's heavy- handed response to the bombing, Serena forges orders from her husband to have him arrested for treason and apostasy. Cushing is taken to prison \\"on Waterford's word\\" (executive order), with Waterford eventually replacing him as the head of the Council and Gilead's leader. Cushing is the only politician to enstablish a semi-dictatorial regime in Gilead, although only for few days. In fact his excessive power and authoritarism were feared by the other Commanders. * Isaac (portrayed by Rohan Mead) is a Guardian assigned to the Waterford home. * Eleanor Lawrence (portrayed by Julie Dretzin) is Commander Lawrence's long suffering wife. * Mark Tuello (portrayed by Sam Jaeger) is a mysterious stranger who Serena encounters in Canada.  Guest characters  The following is a supplementary list of guest stars that appear in lesser roles, make significant cameo appearances or who receive co-starring credit over multiple appearances.  Introduced in season 1 * Erin (portrayed by Erin Way) is a young, apparently mute, woman who was being trained to become a Handmaid but managed to escape to Canada.  Introduced in season 2 * Mrs. O'Conner (portrayed by Marisa Tomei) is a Commander's wife sent to the colonies as punishment for having sex with another man. Tomei was cast in January 2018. * Holly Maddox (portrayed by Cherry Jones) is June's mother, an outspoken feminist. Jones was cast in January 2018. * Sylvia (portrayed by Clea DuVall) is Emily's wife, who managed to leave the United States with their child before Gilead was installed. * Omar (portrayed by Yahya Abdul- Mateen II) is a man who helps June attempt to escape. He does not return from church nor does his family. * Dan (portrayed by John Carroll Lynch) is Emily's boss at the university where she worked. * Annie (portrayed by Kelly Jenrette) is Luke's ex-wife, who stalked June as an attempt to make her give up on him. * Odette Johnson (portrayed by Rebecca Rittenhouse) is the doctor who helped Moira during her surrogacy and later became her fianc√©e.

Bouman is the founding director of Design Society, an initiative of China Merchants Group and the Victoria and Albert Museum in Shenzhen, which opened in December 2017.  Life and career   Early career  Born to German and Dutch parents from cities that were destroyed, Ole Bouman has been fascinated by post-war reconstruction and the way architecture builds society since a young age. He continued his pursuit of this childhood fascination through his academic exploration in the history of architecture at the University of Amsterdam, where he earned degrees in Cultural History and Art & Archeology. Bouman then began his career in the Netherlands as an art and architecture critic with De Groene Amsterdammer, where he wrote a weekly column between 1987 and 1997. As a visiting student at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) from 1987 to 1988, Bouman organized and gave lectures on architectural theory alongside acclaimed academics and architects including Ernest Mandel, Amos Rapoport, Giancarlo de Carlo, and Kenneth Frampton. He compiled and elaborated the materials from his many academic dialogues at Delft and published them in 1994 as The Invisible in Architecture, a comprehensive and critical overview of contemporary architecture co-authored by Roemer van Toorn. Archis Magazine In 1996, Bouman was appointed editor-in-chief of the international architecture magazine Archis, and turned it into a journal for architecture, urbanism and visual culture. In 2000, right before Archis Magazine was to be liquidated by its owner, the Netherlands Architecture Institute, and an ensuing debate in the Dutch national parliament, Bouman became the founding director of the Archis Foundation, an NGO active in publishing, consultancy, and establishing connections between local design communities in need of expertise and the Archis global knowledge network. During his time at Archis, Bouman also curated various exhibitions, including: * RealSpace in QuickTimes (1996): An official Dutch exhibition at the XIX Triennale di Milano with an installation that reflected on the future of architecture in the digital age, as well as the essay RealSpace in QuickTimes on the effect that digital technology will have on the idea of mankind and how this technology expresses itself in buildings. * Egotecture (1998): An exhibition in the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen featuring works depicting 500 years of interaction between space projections and the human self-image, sourced from the vast museum collection. * Manifesta 3: Borderline Syndrome, Energies of Defense (2000): The International Biennial of Contemporary Art in Ljubljana, co-curated by Francesco Bonami, Maria Lhavajova, and Katrin Rhomberg. * Freeze (2000): An exhibition at the Arti et Amicitiae gallery in Amsterdam that attempted to enhance individual awareness of the posthuman condition, by playing with the extreme shortness of our attention spans. * Trans-ports (2000‚Äì2002): An interactive visitor pavilion that aimed to integrate different potentials of space, such as reprogrammability, interactivity, structural animation, and the merging of digitality and physicality by a both built and online interface, in collaboration with Kas Oosterhuis. During his time at Archis, Bouman started Archis RSVP events, a series of response-based events that were organized all over the world by Archis in collaboration with the AMO (the research bureau of OMA). Volume Magazine In 2005, supported by Rem Koolhaas and Mark Wigley, Bouman revamped Archis into Volume, an independent magazine that pushes \\"architecture to go beyond itself\\" and to challenge its limits and discover new roles in society. He concluded his term at Volume with a special issue, explaining ‚Äúunsolicited architecture,‚Äù a practice of design ‚Äúnot waiting the phone to ring‚Äù but proactively searching for opportunities for architecture beyond ‚Äúclient, budget, location and program‚Äù. This issue exposed the results of his teachings at MIT.  Netherlands Architecture Institute  After running Volume, Bouman became the director of the Netherlands Architecture Institute (NAi), which he turned into a civic institution, positioning architecture in direct response to societal needs. During his incumbency, Bouman also revamped NAi into an accessible and popular architecture museum named \\"New NAi\\". This effort was exemplified by a major renovation, finished in 2011, as well as the launch of a new activist agenda for the discipline of architecture called Architecture of Consequence, collaborating among others with AAO curated by Lina Stergiou.http://volumeproject.org/architecture-of-consequence-dutch-designs- on-the-future and Ole Bouman, \\"Architecture of Consequence,\\" in Lina Stergiou, ed., AAO Project: Ethics/Aesthetics (Athens: Benaki Museum and Papasotiriou, 2011), pp.60-79, [speech at International Conference] Based on his experience at MIT, Bouman relaunched The Studio of Unsolicited Architecture (SUA) at the NAi in late 2010 to shed light on the difficulties facing the architecture profession that suffered from a major backlash in the wake of the credit crisis presented at various cities. Bouman was also active as the commissioner and later curator of the Dutch entry to the La Biennale di Venezia from 2008 to 2012, in which he presented his thinking on architecture and society through titles such as Archiphoenix, Faculties for Architecture (2008), Vacant NL (2010), and Re-set, New Wings for Architecture (2012). In 2011, Bouman started to engage in practical collaborations with China by supervising Housing with a Mission, a collaborative project between Dutch and Chinese architects focusing on design solutions for social housing in China together with the Chinese developer Vanke. Bouman left the NAi on the eve of a government enforced merger with two other institutions to represent the government defined \\"top sector\\" of creative industries which he disagreed.  Urbanism/Architecture Bi-City Biennale of Shenzhen/Hong Kong  In 2013, Bouman was appointed the creative director of the Urbanism/Architecture Bi- City Biennale of Shenzhen/Hong Kong (UABB). Bouman redeveloped an industrial plant into a culture facility for the Biennale called \\"Value Factory\\", which was occupied by a variety of international cultural institutions including MoMA, V&A;, Droog Design, Sao Paulo Biennial and MAXXI.In 2014, Bouman worked with curator Juulia Kauste to stage the Finnish entry Re-Creation to La Biennale di Venezia. The piece, which aimed to foster a new culture of making, was an integral part of the UABB and was later presented in the Aalto pavilion at the biennale de Venezia.  Design Society  Since 2015, Bouman has served as the founding director of Design Society, an initiative developed by China Merchants Group and the Victoria and Albert Museum in Shekou, Shenzhen. More than a traditional exhibition space, Design Society has been set up as a hub bringing together a museum, a theatre, a multifunctional hall, a private gallery, a caf√©, a restaurant and many different shopping areas, including one space where the creations of talented young Chinese designers are for sale. The organization aims to build a diverse public program with the mission to activate design as a social catalyst. Bouman currently works as urban curator at China Merchants to disseminate the lessons for Shenzhen for a large scale of urban developments throughout China.

In addition to scholarly works, he authored several plays, a novel, and an autobiography. Early years in Germany Blume was born in Swabia to north German parents, Hedwig (n√©e Grabowsky) and Paul Blume. He was five when the family moved to Silesia, where his father (1873‚Äì1931) worked at the , noted for the construction of railroad cars. Five years later, when his father lost his position due to excessive drinking, the family relocated for a time from G√∂rlitz to Bremerhaven and Hanover before finally settling in Esslingen am Neckar, where his father was employed until his death as a section chief at the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen. His widowed mother (1876‚Äì1949) remained in Esslingen until the family home was bombed out in World War II.Bernhard Blume, Narziss mit Brille. Kapitel einer Autobiographie, ed. Egon Schwarz and Fritz Martini (Heidelberg: Lambert Schneider, 1985). This autobiography has a comprehensive editorial apparatus on Blume's life and works, and it is the primary information source for this article. Blume attended the humanities-focused Realgymnasium in Esslingen and during these years saw performances of Friedrich Schiller‚Äôs The Robbers, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing‚Äôs Nathan the Wise, and Heinrich von Kleist‚Äôs Prince Friedrich von Homburg at the Hoftheater in Stuttgart which he reenacted at home with a puppet theater for his younger brother. He participated in the Wandervogel movement and continued hiking with friends after passing the Reifepr√ºfung and taking up university studies. From 1919 to 1923, he matriculated at the universities of Munich, Berlin, and T√ºbingen, attending lectures by such luminaries as Ernst Troeltsch, Eduard Spranger, and Heinrich W√∂lfflin. His coursework focused on Germanic and modern Romance languages and literatures, and among his Romance philology professors were Karl Vossler and the linguist Josef Haas, in whose house he lived for a time and whose approach to scholarship was a profound influence. Blume passed the Dienstpr√ºfung required to embark upon a career in secondary education and also completed the probationary period of teaching in Stuttgart, but he was drawn to the theater and at age 22 made a career change. His first play, Tamango, based on a Prosper M√©rim√©e novella about the 18th-century slave trade, was written while he was still a student and staged in Stuttgart. In 1923-24 he worked in Beuthen as dramaturge for the Upper Silesian Tri-City Theater (Beuthen - Gleiwitz - Hindenburg) and then was appointed dramaturge of the Stuttgart State Theater. Residing in Degerloch, an outer district of Stuttgart, he authored Fahrt nach der S√ºdsee (1924), which premiered simultaneously at the National Theatre Mannheim and Staatstheater Berlin in 1925. His play Bonaparte (1926) was an even greater success and premiered simultaneously in Munich, Stuttgart, Wiesbaden, and Hanover. In the following years, his most widely produced plays were Treibjagd (1927), the comedy Feurio! (1928), and the comedy Gelegenheit macht Diebe (1930). He also authored a documentary drama about the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, Im Namen des Volkes (1930), which premiered in Leipzig. He was hailed as one of Germany's most promising young playwrights, one of the \\"five B's\\" (Brecht, Bruckner, Bronnen, Barlach, and Blume).Fritz Martini, \\"Ein vergessener Dramatiker: Bernhard Blume\\", Drama und Theater im 20. Jahrhundert. Festschrift f√ºr Walter Hinck, ed. Hans Dietrich Irmscher and Werner Keller (G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1983), , here p. 122. His plays were strongly influenced by the works of Georg B√ºchner, Frank Wedekind, and Arthur Schnitzler. During these years Blume authored short newspaper and journal articles about Kleist, Klabund, Bruckner, Franz Grillparzer, Gerhart Hauptmann, and Anna Seghers. In 1927 Blume married Carola Rosenberg (1899‚Äì1987), who came from a Neudenau Jewish family with deep roots in Swabia and with whom he had two sons, Michael Wolfgang (1929‚Äì1994) and Frank Reinhart (1932‚Äì1998). In 1931, Blume enrolled at the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart and attended courses on German literature taught by Hermann Pongs and on psychology taught by Fritz Giese. On 1 April 1933, two months after the Nazi party‚Äôs accession to power, Carola Rosenberg-Blume was dismissed from her position as head of the women‚Äôs division of the Stuttgart Volkshochschule on grounds both of race and her leftist political stance. For a few years Blume was able to continue as a playwright, but Nazi racial laws were tightened and he was finally subject to an official boycott of his plays because he was ‚Äúrelated by marriage to a non-Aryan‚Äù. In 1934 Schatzgr√§ber und Matrosen (1933), based on Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äôs Treasure Island, premiered in Berlin. His Die Schwertbr√ºder (1934), based on Schiller‚Äôs Die Malteser, was staged in Karlsruhe in 1935. In 1936 he published a historical novel, Das Wirtshaus zum roten Husaren, set in the Austria of the Turkish Wars. He also published articles on Schiller and Arthur Rimbaud. Continuing to live in Germany became increasingly untenable, and in order to prepare for emigration and a career change, Blume completed a doctorate with a dissertation on the nihilistic world view of Arthur Schnitzler, defended in June 1935. Blume‚Äôs thesis director was the strongly pro-Nazi , and Blume hewed to the Nazi line by characterizing nihilism in Nietzschean terms as a psychological manifestation of bourgeois decay. At the end of November 1935, Carola Rosenberg-Blume traveled to the United States, and she returned to Germany two months later with a one-year job contract for Bernhard Blume at Mills College, a one-year research contract for herself, and visa application affidavits for the family. The very next day the family went to the American consulate, and on 30 April 1936 they disembarked from the SS George Washington in New York. Later years in the United States Filling the faculty position at Mills College formerly held by Theodore Brohm,Mary Akatiff Cudahy, \\"A Tribute to German at Mills\\", Mills Quarterly, Winter 2004, pp. 8-9, available online. Blume not only headed the German program but would eventually reorganize the general curriculum in modern European literature. His wife also taught adult education courses from time to time, without a full-time appointment. In 1936 he sent a letter to the Reichsschrifttumskammer, the Nazi agency that controlled writers and publications in Germany, to protest his expulsion. Blume‚Äôs political outlook gradually shifted from the Nietzschean nihilism of his early years to a democratic liberalism informed by Thomas Mann‚Äôs simultaneous transformation. In addition to teaching, Blume delivered public lectures on Hitler‚Äôs Mein Kampf and Hermann Rauschning‚Äôs nihilism; he also authored articles on Thomas Mann, Goethe, Kleist, and Rainer Maria Rilke. In 1942 he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. Carola Rosenberg-Blume's father and other relatives were killed in Nazi extermination camps. In 1945 Blume was tapped to chair the German Department at Ohio State University. The faculty position he vacated at Mills was filled by Olga Schnitzler, who had been married to Arthur Schnitzler from 1903 to 1922. At Ohio State Blume faced the administrative challenge of a temporary enrollment bulge caused by the G.I. Bill, necessitating the recruitment of additional teaching staff. Oskar Seidlin would prove to be his most consequential new hire. Blume continued to publish on Lessing, Goethe, Kleist, Mann, Rimbaud, Rilke, Elisabeth Langg√§sser, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Hermann Hesse. Carola Rosenberg-Blume completed a Ph.D. in clinical psychology in 1949 and was employed as a psychologist at the Bureau of Juvenile Research in Columbus, where she worked on rehabilitating underage offenders. In 1955 he accepted an appointment at Harvard University, where he held the prestigious Kuno Francke Professorship of German Art and Culture until retiring with emeritus status in 1966. During these years he published articles on Mann, Schnitzler, Rilke, Brecht, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, Charles Baudelaire, and Wilhelm Busch. At age 65, Blume accepted a final academic appointment as the first professor of German in the Department of Literature at the newly founded University of California, San Diego. He survived two heart attacks at age 68. He taught at San Diego for five years until fully retiring in 1971. During these years he published articles on Kleist, Goethe, and Mann. Following retirement he remained active up to the time of his death at age 77, coediting with Henry J. Schmidt of Ohio State University a textbook for undergraduate students, German Literature: Texts and Contexts (1974), as well as a volume of Rilke‚Äôs correspondence with Sidonie N√°dhern√° von Borut√≠n (1973) and working on an autobiography, which was published posthumously under the title Narzi√ü mit Brille (1985; English translation 1992). A posthumous collection of his essays, Existenz und Dichtung (1980), assembles seven articles on the motific cluster of ship ‚Äì water ‚Äì island ‚Äì shipwreck as well as six essays on Rilke. Awards and honors Blume was a Guggenheim Fellow twice, in 1954-55 and 1963-64. In 1957 he was named a member of the Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung. The Goethe-Gesellschaft in Weimar awarded him the Goethe Medal in Gold in 1964, and in 1970 he was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the recipient of two honorary doctorates, an LLD from Mills College in 1965 and a Litt.D. from Washington University in 1972, as well as an honorary A.M. degree from Harvard in 1956.See the Harvard University Archives online. His colleagues honored him with a Festschrift in 1967,Festschrift f√ºr Bernhard Blume. Aufs√§tze zur deutschen und europ√§ischen Literatur, ed. Egon Schwarz, Hunter G.

The patterns originate from the interaction of a coherent field, that is injected into a resonant optical cavity, with a Kerr medium that fills the cavity. The same equation governs two types of patterns: stationary patterns that arise in the planes orthogonal with respect to the direction of propagation of light (transverse patterns) and patterns that form in the longitudinal direction (longitudinal patterns), travel along the cavity with the velocity of light in the medium and give rise to a sequence of pulses in the output of the cavity. The case of longitudinal patterns is intrinsically linked to the phenomenon of ‚ÄúKerr frequency combs‚Äù in microresonators, discovered in 2007 by Tobias Kippenberg and collaborators, that has raised a very lively interest, especially because of the applicative avenue it has opened. __TOC__  The equation  Figure 1 shows a light beam that propagates in the z direction, while x and y are the transverse directions. If we assume that the electric field as {\\\\cal E}(x,y,z,t) , where t denotes time, is linearly polarized and therefore can be treated as a scalar, we can express it in terms of the slowly varying normalized complex envelope E(x,y,z,t) in this way Figure 1. A light beam propagates along the z direction. x and y are the transverse directions :{\\\\cal E}(x,y,z,t)\\\\propto E(x,y,z,t)e^{i(\\\\omega_0/\\\\tilde{c})(z-\\\\tilde{c}t)} + \\\\text{c.c.} where \\\\omega_0 is the frequency of the light beam that is injected into the cavity and \\\\tilde{c} of the light velocity in the Kerr medium that fills the cavity. For definiteness, consider a ring cavity (Fig. 2) of very high quality (High-Q cavity). Figure 2. Top view of ring cavity In the original LLE, one assumes conditions such that the envelope E is independent of the longitudinal variable z ( i.e. uniform along the cavity), so that E=E(x,y,t). The equation reads =E_\\\\text{in}-E-i\\\\theta E+iE^2 E+i abla^2_\\\\perp E}} : abla^2_\\\\perp E=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2E}{\\\\partial \\\\bar{x}^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2E}{\\\\partial \\\\bar{y}^2} where \\\\bar{t} and \\\\bar{x}, \\\\bar{y} are normalized temporal and spatial variables, i.e. \\\\bar{t}=\\\\kappa t, \\\\bar{x}=x/\\\\ell_d, \\\\bar{y}=y/\\\\ell_d, with \\\\kappa being the cavity decay rate or cavity linewidth, \\\\ell_d the diffraction length in the cavity. \\\\theta=(\\\\omega_c-\\\\omega_0)/\\\\kappa is the cavity detuning parameter, with \\\\omega_c being the cavity frequency nearest to \\\\omega_0. In the righthand side of Eq.(), E_\\\\text{in} is the normalized amplitude of the input field that is injected into the cavity, the second is the decay term, the third is the detuning term, the fourth is the cubic nonlinear term that takes into account the Kerr medium, the last term with the transverse Laplacian abla_\\\\perp^2 describes diffraction in the paraxial approximation. Conditions of self-focusing are assumed. We refer to Eq.() as the transverse LLE. Some years later than, there was the formulation of the longitudinal LLE, in which diffraction is replaced by dispersion. In this case one assumes that the envelope E is independent of the transverse variables x and y, so that E=E(z,t). The longitudinal LLE reads =E_\\\\text{in}-E-i\\\\theta E+iE^2 E+i\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 E}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{z}^2}}} with \\\\bar{z}=z/a, where a depends, in particular on the dispersion parameter at second order. Conditions of anomalous dispersion are assumed. An important point is that, once E(\\\\bar{z},\\\\bar{t}) is obtained by solving Eq.(), one must come back to the original variables z,t and replace z by z-\\\\tilde{c}t, so that a z-dependent stationary solution (stationary pattern) becomes a travelling pattern (with velocity \\\\tilde{c}). From a mathematical viewpoint, the LLE amounts to a driven, damped, detuned nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The transverse LLE () is in 2D from the spatial viewpoint. In a waveguide configuration E depends only on one spatial variable, say x, and the transverse Laplacian is replaced by \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 E}{\\\\partial \\\\bar{x}^2} and one has the transverse LLE in 1D. The longitudinal LLE () is equivalent to the transverse LLE in 1D. In some papers dealing with the longitudinal case one considers dispersion beyond the second order, so that Eq.() includes also terms with derivatives of order higher than second with respect to \\\\bar{z}.  Uniform stationary solutions. Connection with optical bistability. Four-wave mixing and pattern formation.  thumbupright=1.2Figure 3. Stationary curve of the normalized output intensity E^2 as a function of the normalized input intensity E_\\\\text{in}^2 for \\\\theta=4. The stationary states in the segment with negative slope are unstable. The arrows show the hysteresis cycle which is covered when E_\\\\text{in}^2 is increased and then decreased. Let us focus on the case in which the envelope E is constant, i.e. on the stationary solutions that are independent of all spatial variables. By dropping all derivatives in Eqs.() and (), and taking the squared modulus, one obtains the stationary equation If we plot the stationary curve of E^2 as a function of E_\\\\text{in}^2, when \\\\theta>\\\\sqrt{3} we obtain a curve as that shown in Fig.3. The curve is S-shaped and there is an interval of values of E_\\\\text{in}^2 where one has three stationary states. However,the states that lie in the segment with negative slope are unstable, so that in the interval there are two coexisting stable stationary states: this phenomenon is called optical bistability. If the input intensity E_\\\\text{in}^2 is increased and then decreased, one covers a hysteresis cycle. If we refer to the modes of the empty cavity, in the case of the uniform stationary solutions described by Eq.() the electric field is singlemode, corresponding to the mode of frequency \\\\omega_c quasi-resonant with the input frequency \\\\omega_0. In the transverse configuration of Eq.(), in the case of these stationary solutions E corresponds to a singlemode plane wave e^{i(k_x x+k_y y)} with k_x=k_y=0, where k_x and k_y are the transverse components of the wave vector, exactly as the input field E_\\\\text{in}. The cubic Kerr nonlinearity of Eqs.() and () gives rise to four-wave mixing (FWM) , which can generate other modes, so that the envelope E displays a spatial pattern: in the transverse plane in the case of Eq.(), along the cavity in the case of Eq.().  Transverse patterns and cavity solitons In the transverse case of Eq.() the pattern arises from the interplay of FWM and diffraction. The FWM can give rise, for example, to processes in which pairs of photons with k_x=k_y=0 are absorbed and, simultaneously, the system emits pairs of photons with k_x=\\\\bar{k}_x, k_y=0 and k_x=-\\\\bar{k}_x, k_y=0 in such a way that the total energy of photons, and their total momentum, are conserved (Fig.4). Figure 4. A four-wave mixing process in which two photons with k_x=k_y=0 are absorbed and two photons with k_x=\\\\bar{k}_x, k_y=0 and k_x=-\\\\bar{k}_x,k_y=0 are emitted. k_x, k_y and k_z are the components of the wave-vectors. Actually further FWM processes enter into play, so that E(x,y) assumes the configuration of a hexagonal pattern (see Fig.5). Figure 5. A typical pattern configuration that arises in the transverse planes in the output is a hexagonal pattern. A pattern displays an ordered array of intensity peaks. It is possible to generate also isolated intensity peaks, that are called cavity solitons (see Fig. 6). Since cavity solitons can be ‚Äúwritten‚Äùand ‚Äúerased‚Äù one by one in the transverse plane like in a blackboard, they are of great interest for applications to optical information processing and telecommunications. Figure 6. A typical Kerr cavity soliton in the transverse plane showing a bright peak in the dark background with diffraction rings.  Longitudinal patterns and cavity solitons  In the longitudinal case of Eq.() the patterns arise from the interplay between FWM and dispersion. The FWM can give rise, for example, to processes in which pairs of photons of the longitudinal mode quasi-resonant with \\\\omega_0 are absorbed and, simultaneously, the system emits photon pairs corresponding to cavity modes symmetrically adjacent to the quasi-resonant mode, in such a way that the total photon energy, as well as the total longitudinal photon momentum, are conserved. Figure 7. Example of longitudinal pattern that travels along the cavity with the velocity of light in the medium and gives rise to a periodic sequence of pulses in the output. Figure 7 shows an example of the patterns that are generated, and travel along the cavity and out of the cavity. Like in the transverse case, also in the longitudinal configuration single or multiple Kerr cavity solitons can be generated; Figure 8 illustrates the case of a single cavity soliton that circulates in the cavity and produces a sequence of narrow pulses in the output. Such solitons have been observed for the first time in a fiber cavity. Figure 8. Longitudinal Kerr cavity solitons. It is important to note that the instability which originates longitudinal patterns and cavity solitons in the LLE is a special case of the multimode instability of optical bistability, predicted by Bonifacio and Lugiato in and first observed experimentally in.  Microresonator Kerr frequency combs and cavity solitons  Optical frequency combs constitute an equidistant set of laser frequencies that can be employed to count the cycles of light. This technique, introduced by Theodor Haensch and John Hall using mode-locked lasers, has led to myriad applications. The work demonstrated the realization of broadband optical frequency combs exploiting the whispering gallery modes activated by a CW laser field injected into a high-Q microresonator filled with a Kerr medium, that gives rise to FWM. Since that time Kerr frequency combs (KFC), whose bandwidth can exceed an octave with repetition rates in the microwave to THz frequencies , have been generated in a wide variety of microresonators; for reviews on this subject see e.g. They offer substantial potential for miniaturization and chip-scale photonic integration, as well as for power reduction. Today KFC generation is a mature field, and this technology has been applied to several areas, including coherent telecommunications, spectroscopy, atomic clocks as well as laser ranging and astrophysical spectrometer calibration. A key impetus to these developments has been the realization of Kerr cavity solitons in microresonators, opening the possibility of utilizing Kerr cavity solitons in photonic integrated microresonators. The longitudinal LLE () provides a spatio-temporal picture of the involved phenomena, but from the spectral viewpoint its solutions correspond to KFC. The link between the topic of optical KFC and the LLE was theoretically developed in. These authors showed that the LLE ( or generalizations including higher order dispersion terms) is the model which describes the generation of KFC and is capable of predicting their properties when the system parameters are varied. The spontaneous formation of spatial patterns and solitons travelling along the cavity described by the LLE is the spatiotemporal equivalent of the frequency combs and governs their features. The rather idealized conditions assumed in the formulation of the LLE, especially the high-Q condition, have been perfectly materialized by the spectacular technological progress that has occurred in the meantime in the field of photonics and has led, in particular, to the discovery of KFC.  Quantum aspects  The two photons that, as shown in Fig.4, are emitted in symmetrically tilted directions in the FWM process, are in a state of quantum entanglement: they are precisely correlated , for example in energy and momentum. This fact is fundamental for the quantum aspects of optical patterns. For instance, the difference between the intensities of the two symmetrical beams is squeezed, i.e. exhibits fluctuations below the shot noise level; the longitudinal analogue of this phenomenon has been observed experimentally in KFC. In turn, such quantum aspects are basic for the field of quantum imaging.  Review articles  For reviews on the subject of the LLE, see also.

As a member of ACOMET she has participated in the updating of the Manual de Uso de T√©rminos Meteorol√≥gicos, which had initially been published in 1992. Together with the Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog√≠a (AEMET), she carried out a project in collaboration with the World Meteorological Organization within the field of communication: the video in Spanish from the series \\"El tiempo en 2050\\", in which an area's weather is simulated over the span of 35 years. Controversy Despite the fact that an independent report commissioned by TVE from the auditor KPMG concluded that public channels were not used for private purposes, on 31 July 2014, L√≥pez was suspended from work and salary for 20 days for having \\"transgressed contractual good faith\\" with RTVE, having formed, together with , Albert Mart√≠nez Bobe, , David Torres Ayala, Ana Mari√±o L√≥pez, and Marta Barniol Gil (three of whom were her colleagues), a limited company with no mercantile activity since its inception.

Brown and John G. Coutsis in 1978. It has an IUCN Red List status of near threatened. Description The Higgins's anomalous blue (Polyommatus nephohiptamenos) is in the family Lycaenidae. It was described by Brown and Coutsis in 1978. Polyommatus nephohiptamenos was thought to possibly be a subspecies or form of Polyommatus ripartii, Ripart's anomalous blue. A 2016 paper confirmed that it was a distinct species based on distinct COI mitochondrial DNA barcodes and ecological differentiation. The fringes of the male are whiter than with P. ripartii. Habitat P. nephohiptamenos is endemic to Europe, found only in mountains of northern Greece and occasionally of southern Bulgaria. It is found in a small area at higher altitudes of the Phalakron Massif in Greece and Bulgaria. It has a dot- like distribution range. It has been found on Mount Pangeon and Mount Phalakro in Greece, and Mount Orvilos on the border between Greece and Bulgaria, and Mount Alibotush and Kitka Planina in Bulgaria. It is probably limited to less than 10 locations within an area of occupancy under . It is usually found above the tree line, mostly between in calcareous grasslands with many flowers. Life cycle P. nephohiptamenos has one generation per year. It feeds on the perennial sainfoin Onobrychis montana ssp. scardica, which is endemic to the Balkans. The caterpillars hibernate while still small, and feed on the new leaves of the sainfoin the next spring. The butterfly flies in mid- July and August. The butterfly may be threatened by intensified grazing, abandonment and wildfires. It has an IUCN Red List status of near threatened.

Biography  Born in Saint-Malo, he attended lycee in Brest, he eventually gained admission to and attended √âcole normale sup√©rieure (Paris). He obtained his agr√©gation in 2005 and did his thesis in mathematics under Bernoit Perthame at the University of Paris 6, finishing in 2007. In 2008, he took a position as a charg√© de recherche at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Lyon in the Unit√© de math√©matiques pures et appliqu√©es (UMPA) in 2008. He defended his habilitation in 2015 and obtained the position of Directeur de Recherche at Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 in 2016. Since 2014, he has been an associate editor of the Journal of Mathematical Biology, and, since 2018, he has been an associate editor of the SIAM Journal of Mathematical Analysis. Aside from research, Calvez is also involved in the popularization of mathematics by coordinating the travelling exhibition ‚ÄúMath√†lyon,‚Äù intended for junior high and high school students.  Research  Calvez's early research involved the development of models for the collective movements of bacteria via chemotaxis using kinetic models. This model describes both the individual movements of bacteria and the transport of colonies as a whole, and satisfactorily explains the specific characters of this movement. Later, he worked in collaboration with biophysicists to find a new explanation for cell polarization and in collaboration with ecologists on models for invasion fronts.

Campbell; August 25, 1939 - May 22, 2013) was an American educator, education advocate, author, a community leader, writer, activist, mentor, jazz and art program promoter. He is one of the founders of the National Black United Front, Jitu Weusi Institute for Development, the International African Arts Festival. The festival started in 1971. Weusi along with Aminisha Black and supporters were the founders of The East (Brooklyn) (East Cultural and Education Institution), Uhuru Sasa School (Freedom Now School), in Brooklyn for grades K through 12, the African Street Festival in Brooklyn which became the International African Arts Festival, the Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium, Black News co-founder, founding member of the African American Teachers Association, and For My Sweet. For my Sweet is a cultural events and art gallery space in Brooklyn. Early life Weusi was Leslie R. Campbell in 1939 and raised in Brooklyn from a working class family. He was born at St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn. He graduated from Brooklyn's P.S. 54 in 1952. As a young child he worked at his cousin's newsstand. He says, that from working at the newsstand he was introduced to jazz by the men that would frequent the newsstand. His cousins took him to his first jazz concert. While in his teens Weusi worked as a waiter at the Village Gate in New York City where he met Thelonious Monk, and Nina Simone. He attended Brooklyn Tech High School, and Franklin Lane High School. He received a basketball scholarship to attend Long Island University where he wrote his thesis on the history of Black Swan Records, the first African American recording company. It was titled \\"The Rise and Fall of Black Swan Records.\\" Career In 1962, Weusi started working for the New York City Public schools teaching Social Studies at Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant's Junior High School (JHS 35). In March 1968 he was transferred to Junior High School 271 after taking students from his class to a Malcolm X memorial program. In the late 60s, Weusi left the New York City Department of Education, and started the Uhuru Sasa Shule private school, which means in Swahili (Freedom Now School). It was the first Black independent private school in New York City. The school was developed to address the need for African American students to understand their heritage and place in history. In 1985, he returned to teaching for Department of Education in NYC in many different schools for three decades, retiring in 2006.  New York City Teachers Strike of 1968  In 1968 Weusi played a significant role along with other young educators such as; Randy Tobias, Al Vann, Oliver Patterson, Leroy Lewis, Joan Eastman, and Ola Cherry for community control of public schools during the teachers strike in the fall of 1968. The strike pitted the United Federation of Teachers against community control of school advocates coming after the new community-controlled school board dismissed white and Jewish American teachers. The United Federation of Teachers lead by Albert Shanker wanted and demanded that the teachers' be reinstated. It was a conflict between local rights and self-determination and the rights of teachers' universal rights as workers. It was one of the largest teachers' strikes in American history. In 1967 four out of 865 principals were Black, and 12 out of 1,500 were assistant principals in New York City schools. More than 95 percent of the students in the public schools in the Ocean-Hill- Brownsville area of Brooklyn were Black and Latino and teachers were two- thirds white. During the 1968 strike over 500 New York City teachers went on strike. The strike lasted for 37 days, over a million students were affected by the strike. The strike came after controversy to integrate the public school system and community control with the school district called Ocean Hill, Brooklyn, Brownsville, Brooklyn. Prior to the teachers' strike was the Brown v. Board decision calling for the integration of the public school systems through busing. In New York City the effort to integration the public schools met with resistance and gridlock. In Harlem and in Ocean Hill- Brownsville an alternative to integration and rezoning was the demand for local community boards and parent control of schools. New York City Mayor John Lindsay in the spring of 1967 did grant \\"community control\\" to Ocean Hill- Brownsville and two other New York City neighborhoods. This was his response from White parents' complaints to busing to integrate schools. The New York City schools that were a part of the test experiment in community control of local schools were JHS 35, I.S. 201, and JHS 271. The project was approved by the New York City Board of Education (BOE) and supported by the Ford Foundation. The schools had a governing board of local parents and residents. Weusi described the community and teachers' movement as the ‚Äúmost underrepresented yet most impactful era of Brooklyn history.‚Äù And that the battle between, ‚Äúthe teachers and the community battled the Board of Education and the predominately-white United Federation of Teachers in a struggle that they hoped would finally create a structure for the empowerment of local communities. The result was the establishment of the Ocean Hill-Brownsville Governing Board, a community school board that served central Brooklyn‚Äôs Black Community.‚Äù In 1968, Rhody McCoy was the unit administrator of the Ocean Hill- Brownsville Demonstration School District project. He stated in a 1968 interview that the project of community control, and decentralization at the test schools were sabotaged by Albert Shanker, and the United Federation of Teachers. \\"We are convinced that the Establishment and this Society are determined to prevent blacks and Puerto Ricans from controlling their own schools.\\" In regards to many of the white teachers that were removed; \\"Many of the teachers we removed were unfit. We didn't want them because they didn't think our kids were capable of learning.\\" And that, \\" community control over its schools--a right which belongs to every other community.\\" In an interview with Julius Lester in 1968, Weusi explains that a poem written by a young African American student which spoke of Jewish teachers using hateful slurs, and include the line \\"I wish you were dead.\\" The poem was aired on WBAI in New York City, which created a lot of controversy, and Weusi was label anti- Jewish. Due to the 20 year old controversy and negative publicity in the media Weusi resigned as co-chairman of African Americans United for David Dinkins campaign for the Mayor of New York City.  African-American Teachers Association  Weusi was one of the founding members of African-American Teachers Association in the late 60s. It was an organization that was formed outside of the United Federation of Teachers. The African-American Teachers Association was organized to deal with the quality and issues of education in regards to Black and Hispanic youth in New York City. In 1968, Weusi was also a founding member of the African American Student Association.  The East  In 1969 Weusi, Aminisha Black and community supporters founded The East a community education and arts organization in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY, after quitting the New York Public school system. It was located at 10 Claver Place. The East closed in 1986. Such notable artists as Max Roach, Roy Ayers, Betty Carter, McCoy Tyner, Pharoah Sanders, Olu Dara, Freddie Hubbard, Leon Thomas, Lee Morgan, Dewey Redman, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Last Poets, Betty Carter, Sun Ra, Gary Bartz, Randy Weston, Hugh Masekela and Denzel Washington performed at the East. The East was a cultural organization, and known as a \\"family\\" in Brooklyn organized for people of African descent. The core group of organizers and participants were known as The East Family.http://www.ourtimepress.com/the-east-family-looks-to- rename-claver-place-after-jitu-weusi/ It had multiple operating functions; a bookstore, restaurant, catering business, food co-op, a newspaper called Black News, a recording label, and a jazz venue. It was one of the earlier promoters of Kwanzaa in New York. Pharoah Sanders performed and recorded at the East. He recorded an album, titled \\"Live at the East\\", which was named after the East in 1971. The album was released in 1972 on the Impulse label.  Later life  In 1999, Weusi was one of the founding members of The Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium and served as chairperson. The CBJC organized music festivals, venues, promotes local talent, and programs for communities in Brooklyn. The Council of Independent Black Institutions (CIBI) was created in 1972. It came into being from five Black Power Conferences from 1966 and 1970. In 1976, Weusi and Aminisha Black founded Uhuru Sasa, after Ocean Hill-Brownsville school battles for community control of schools. Aminisha and Weusi met during the Ocean-Hill Brownsville School campaign. Weusi served as Chair for the National Black United Front, and African-Americans United for Political Power organization which played a key role in the election of David Dinkins, the first African American mayor of New York City. The (BUF) was formed in 1980. Early founders of (BUF) were Sam Pinn who at the time was the Chairman of the Brooklyn Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), Al Vann, Herbert Daughtry, and as mentioned earlier Weusi who was in his early days known as Leslie Campbell. In 1989, Weusi worked on mayoral campaign of David Dinkins, the first African American mayor of New York City.

The painting features Saint John, banished to Patmos, writing the Book of Revelation amidst a classical landscape background. Background Nicolas Poussin is widely regarded as a proponent of the classical movement of the 17th century. In notes left unfinished before his death, Poussin described what he called 'the grand manner', paintings featuring a grand motif, and appropriatearrangement, measure, and form. Subject and themes In Poussin's paintings, large landscapes typically dominate the canvas. Patmos is portrayed by Poussin as an open environment, showing a new world created from the old, symbolized by the ruined Greek buildings. The setting shows a sunny sky above a classical era environment. In the foreground lies Saint John, posed similarly to an Ancient Greek god. Saint John was banished to Patmos by the Roman Emperor Domitian for his Christian beliefs. Known for his visions recorded in the Book of Revelation, the painting represents the Saint recording his works. In the background there are two oak trees, an obelisk, and the ruins of an ancient temple. The decaying ancient buildings, which would often be repurposed by the Church, suggest the replacement of the old ways with Christianity. From the hills to the sky, the rest of the landscape is an imaginary setting created defying the rules of atmospheric perspective.

Significance  Nanda Maharaj is the father of Krishna and Balarama. Those days children were given the charge to take care of the calves. Both Krishna and Balarama having passed their fifth year, cowherd men conferred and agreed to give those boys who had passed their fifth year charge of the cows in the pasturing ground.

The festival is celebrated on the eighth day in the bright half of Karthik month.  Celebrations  Go-puja is done on this day. Devotees visit the gosala, bathe and clean the cows and the gosala. Cows are decorated with cloth and jewellery before offering special ritual by the devotees. Special fodders are fed for good health and special drive is organized for its preservation.

History  Pure Telecom was established by Paul Connell and Alan McGonnell in Ranelagh, Dublin, in 2002, with a focus on business customers. It moved to its first office in Citywest, Dublin, in 2005 to facilitate its growing staff base and plans to enter the residential telecommunications market. Pure Telecom entered the residential market in 2005, offering competitive prices that reduced the cost of phone and broadband services in Ireland. In 2009, the success of its residential arm led to Pure Telecom's second office move to its current location in Citywest Business Campus. In 2016, the company announced that the previous year was its most successful yet, having signed up 10,000 new residential customers in 2015, resulting in a ‚Ç¨5 million revenue boost.

It killed one person and injured 23 others. The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) claimed responsibility in a telephone call and also took credit for a bomb at a French base in Beirut the same day, coming a month after the group's Orly Airport attack. The group commented \\"We will continue our struggle until the liberation of innocent Armenians from French jails.\\" However the attack was actually orchestrated by Ilich Ram√≠rez S√°nchez, better known as Carlos the Jackal, who had relations with the ASALA's leadership. Carlos claimed responsibility in a letter written to the German Embassy in Saudi Arabia. The bomb, containing 20 to 30 kg of explosives, was planted in a storage room on the building's fourth floor by Ahmed Mustafa El-Sibai, a Lebanese man and associate of Carlos. The blast tore the building's roof, destroyed the fourth floor and caused part of it to collapse, causing a total of 2.5 million marks in damage. The explosives were brought into East Berlin by Johannes Weinrich, another close aide to Carlos. Weinrich had brought the explosives in a year prior, they had been confiscated by the Stasi secret police, then returned just prior to the bombing by East German major (later lieutenant colonel/oberstleutnant) Helmut Voigt who passed the explosives back to Weinrich at the Syrian Embassy, which was Carlos's base in East Germany. Weinrich successfully transported the explosives from East to West Berlin via the Friedrichstra√üe before giving them to El-Sibai who planted it. The fatal victim was 26-year-old Michael Haritz, a peace activist who was handing out leaflets at the consulate protesting France's nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific, and died from asphyxiation. Carlos previously bombed several targets in France, including the 1982 Capitole train bombing. He said the attacks in France and West Berlin were in revenge for French air strikes against a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine training camp in Lebanon. Aftermath and convictions The Maison de France is a French cultural centre featuring a French book shop, grocery store, cinema and restaurant. It was rebuilt after the attack and opened by Helmut Kohl and Fran√ßois Mitterrand in 1985. On 26 March, 1991, approximately six months after the two Germanies officially reunified, Voigt fled to Greece. Voigt had heard in news broadcasts of the planned arrests of stasi employees who had supported terrorist actions in west Germany as part of their East-German stasi work. Voigt lived in the Greek port city of Volos under a false identity, but was found and arrested in 1991, when his wife visited him, carrying a tracking device that had been planted in her luggage by West German investigators, without her knowledge. Voigt was extradited, tried, and found guilty on 12 April 1994 for his role in the bombing, and was sentenced to four years in prison. In 1995, after years of searching, Weinrich was detained in Yemen and flown back to Germany. In 2000, after a four year trial, Weinrich was found guilty and given a life sentence. Nabil Shritah, the Syrian diplomat who stored the explosives at the embassy, was given a two year sentence at this time.

The project met with studio resistance and remained unmade until 2012 when Alex Cox had begun teaching film production at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

In March 2013, Cox launched a Kickstarter campaign, hoping to raise $100,000 to shoot the film. The campaign exceeded the goal and raised $114,957 from 1,106 backers. Cox also succeeded in getting numerous film professionals to work on a royalties basis. The film went into production in October 2013.Kickstarter campaign page for Bill, The Galactic Hero Scenes were shot in university buildings.

Its purpose is for African diasporic people to exercise a 24- hour moratorium from shopping or participating in other commercial activity such as using the transit system. The Pan-African ideal of the observance is to highlight racial inequality and the gap between the wealthiest of one of the most powerful nations in the world and those living in poverty. In the early years of its observance, Black Solidarity Day was a means of unifying many of the New York City Communities to show their economic power, with school closings and cultural events. It is still celebrated in pockets amongst African American and Caribbean neighborhoods. Part of its purpose is to show that the spending power of communities of color has an impact on the economy.

In the video game industry, a battle pass is a type of monetization approach that provides additional content for a game usually through a tiered system, rewarding the player with in-game items for playing the game and completing specific challenges. Inspired by the season pass ticketing system and originating with Dota 2 in 2013, the battle pass model gained more use as an alternative to subscription fees and loot boxes beginning in the late 2010s. Battle Passes tend to offer free passes, which are available to all users, and a premium pass that require annual or seasonal charges in exchange for enhanced items and cosmetics. Concept Within a video game, a battle pass may be offered free to a player, or may require the player to purchase it through microtransactions. Once obtained, the battle pass presents the player with a number of reward tiers; by earning enough experience to complete the tier, the player gains the rewards offered at that tier. These rewards are typically cosmetic in nature, such as character and weapon customization options (also known as \\"skins\\"), emotes, and other non-gameplay affecting elements. More desirable rewards are provided at higher levels, which offer a way for players to show off these unique customization options to other players as a status symbol. Experience is gained through normal gameplay, and often through in-game challenges, while some games offer a way to accelerate progression through a battle pass by using microtransactions. The Battle Pass also makes people not be able to play with friends, or do any multiplayer activities at all, if they do not purchase the battle pass. This also means, that after a month, they could be permanently locked out of the game. In games that offer both free and paid-for battle passes, the free pass may have a very limited number of tiers or offer fewer or less-desirable rewards, but will track progress of the player's progression through the paid-for battle pass, allowing them to buy that battle pass at any time to reap the rewards. Battle passes and the rewards contained are only available for a limited time, most commonly a few months, after which a new season battle pass with a new set of rewards are available to be acquired. Battle passes may be called different terms depending on the game. For example, Rocket League, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite Save the World offers a \\"Rocket Pass\\", \\"Survivor Pass\\" and \\"Ventures level\\" respectively. History One of the first known examples of a battle pass concept was seen in Valve's Dota 2 during an event that surrounded The International 2013, the annual esports tournament for the game. Called the \\"Compendium\\", it provided unique in-game content and other features for those players that purchased it, with 25% of all revenue made from it going towards the prize pool for the event. In 2016, Valve included the Compendium into the larger International Battle Pass, and later introduced a monthly form of one with their Dota Plus subscription feature in 2018. Valve also added \\"campaign passes\\" to Team Fortress 2 with special events in 2015. The campaign pass gave the player that purchased it a number of goals to complete during the event to receive unique customization options. The popularity of these passes grew significantly in 2018 with the use in Epic Games's Fortnite Battle Royale. Its runaway success on a scale rarely seen before drew great interest towards its monetization methods. The free-to-play game adopted a \\"season\\"-driven release schedule, each season lasting 10 weeks, during which a new set of cosmetic items and emotes were offered. The newly coined \\"Battle Pass\\" was added starting in its second season, during a time when the game was seeing a large growth in its player base and has been used by the game since. Battle passes are purchased through an in-game currency called V-bucks, which either must be purchased with real-world funds via microtransactions, or earned via Fortnite: Save the World. Analyst Michael Pachter estimated that on the first day of the third season, in February 2018, Epic sold more than five million battle passes, generating over in revenue in a single day. With expansion of Fortnite to mobile devices in March 2018, revenue estimates from the game were in the hundreds of millions of dollars per month in the following months, primarily from battle pass sales. At the same time as Fortnite was becoming a success, the video game industry had been dealing with the issue of loot boxes, another monetization scheme where players spend funds to open boxes containing a random assortment of in-game items. In the late 2010s, loot boxes faced scrutiny from several government-related groups, believing they encouraged gambling, particularly for young players. Battle passes were then seen as a preferable option to loot boxes, as players would be able to see all the rewards they could earn, even if they needed to spend a great deal of time completing all the tiers, assuring players continued to play the game. Further, by offering the means for players to buy into completing tiers, publishers could also see additional revenue. Coupled with the success of Fortnite battle pass approach and exhaustion over loot box controversies, other publishers started to evaluate battle pass use, with gaming journalists theorizing that games which formerly relied on loot boxes or worked as a service could begin to offer battle passes as a replacement.

It rises to a depth of and features hydrothermal activity in the form of black smokers, which were discovered in 1993.  Geography and geology   Regional  Pito seamount lies north-northwest of Easter Island. In 1993, during the \\"Pito\\" expedition the submarine Nautile discovered active black smokers at its foot or at the summit. The region northwest of Easter Island is characterized by the Easter Microplate, a plate set within the East Pacific Rise. Two rift zones delimit eastward and westward, while the Pito and the Orongo fracture zones form its northern and southern border, respectively. Pito seamount lies on the fracture zone of the same name and may indicate incipient seafloor spreading.  Local  Pito seamount has an wide base, rises to a depth of and features a deep and almost wide axial valley. Several smaller cones dot Pito's surface, and the seafloor depression, Pito Deep, lies northwest of the seamount. Fresh basaltic pillow lavas with geochemical characteristics typical of mid-ocean ridge basalts occur on Pito, as do sheet and lobate lava flows. The lavas often have a glassy surface. The first black smokers have been found at depths of at the foot of Pito seamount. A number of black smoker fields are found on Pito and are named Abe, Jason, Magnificent Village, Medea, Scotty's Castle and Sentry; the field originally discovered in 1993 is Magnificent Village and is also the largest. About fifty vents, some active and others inactive, have been observed in the summit area. Temperatures range . Extensive faulting in the region may aid in the establishment of a hydrothermal circulation. Hydrothermal deposits contain chalcopyrite, marcasite, melnikovite, pyrite, sphalerite as well as general iron and zinc sulfides. Anhydrite and amorphous silica were also found at low frequency. Traces of bacterial activity, such as small pores and oxidation products, have been found in the hydrothermal deposits.  Biology  Actinides, alvinellids, anemones, crabs, gastropods, mussels and shrimps have been encountered at the hydrothermal vents of Pito seamount. The biological community is not very diverse either due to a waning of hydrothermal activity or biogeographical barriers and lacks vestimentiferans. On inactive vents, brittle stars are found. Overall, the biota of Pito Seamount resembles that of other segments of the East Pacific Rise.

Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a family of french peasants. The painting is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Description  The Baker's Cart was painted in 1656 by relatively obscure french painter Jean Michelin. Michelin's claim to significance were his depictions of peasants in urban settings, as opposed to more common pastoral ones; this is reflected in The Baker's Cart, which is set in the city. The painting depicts a family of peasants peddling wares from their cart. Large slabs of bread can be seen for sale, as can a vial of eau-de-vie, a medicinal brandy-based solution. The family themselves are visibly poor, as indicated by their clothing, complexions and profession. It was not known that Michelin painted the work until his signature was uncovered on the painting's frame in 1920s.

Two gunmen from the newly formed IPLO shot four Volunteers from the INLA, killing two, Thomas \\"Ta\\" Power (34) and John O'Reilly (26). Hugh Torney, the leader of the INLA faction, and another INLA Volunteer, Peter Stewart, were both injured in the attack that took place at Rossnaree Hotel in Drogheda, County Louth. Event There had been tension between the INLA and the IPLO since the IPLO had been created as most of the IPLO's members were former INLA volunteers who left the INLA on bad terms. On 21 December 1987, the IPLO shot dead an INLA volunteer (Thomas McCartan) in Belfast. In an effort to avert an all-out feud, the INLA leadership, represented by Ta Power and Hugh Torney, agreed to meet the IPLO leadership, who were represented by Gerard Steenson and Jimmy Brown, at a neutral location. However, the meeting was just a ploy to lure the INLA leaders to Rossnaree hotel in Drogheda so they could ambush them and wipe the INLA leadership out. INLA Volunteer Peter Stewart, who was injured but survived the attack, commented on the IPLO gunmen when they entered the hotel wearing disguises: \\"Both men had beards. But I realized they were false beards when I saw the sticky stuff which was used to put them on glistening under the lights\\". Stewart got up to approach the men and as he got close to them they drew their guns and shot Stewart three times in the chest; he recalled a woman whispering a prayer in his ear, John O'Reilly was hit in the spine when he tried to run away and was finished off with three gunshots in the head. Ta Power was also shot dead as he tried to escape but was also shot in the head and Stewart remembers waking up next to him in the ambulance as he realized his comrade who he was very close to was dead. But the IPLO missed their main target Hugh Torney who escaped by running behind stools and chairs and ran out the back door of the hotel and managed to escape with his life, he was shot in the hand as he escaped. It was claimed that Gerard Steenson was the IPLO's getaway driver as he wanted to oversee the operation himself. Peter Stewart said the attack was \\"a very military-like operation.INLA: Deadly Divisions - Jack Holland & Henry McDonald pp. 284‚Äì285 Aftermath The killings resulted in an all out feud between the IPLO and the INLA with a total of 11 people being killed. On 15 March 1987, Gerard Steenson was himself killed along with another IPLO Volunteer as they sat in a car in Springhill Avenue, Ballymurphy in Belfast by INLA gunmen. It was reported that Torney had set up the ambush as revenge for the deaths of Power and O'Reilly. The feud ended on the 27 March 1987 when both groups agreed to a truce. Hugh Torney also met a violent death when he was shot dead himself in an internal INLA in feud in 1996. A man was arrested in 2017 relating to the killings but was released without charge. At the time of the killings it was alleged that one of the gunmen used to be in the Irish Army and was a hitman in Dublin who was also involved in drug dealing and was nicknamed the \\"Chef\\".INLA: Deadly Divisions - Jack Holland & Henry McDonald pp.285 See also * Night of the Long Knives (1992) Sources *Jack Holland, Henry McDonald, INLA ‚Äì Deadly Divisions' *CAIN project References Category:Irish National Liberation Army Category:Terrorism deaths in the Republic of Ireland Category:1987 crimes in the Republic of Ireland Category:January 1987 events in Europe Category:Irish People's Liberation Organisation Category:Military actions and engagements during the Troubles (Northern Ireland) ","title":"Rosnaree Hotel shooting"},{"id":"57843316","text":"Match Day may refer to: * Match Day (series), a football video game franchise ** Match Day (video game), a football computer game, the first in the series * Match Day (medicine), the day the United States' National Resident Matching Program announces medical residency placements for medical students * Matchday programme, a British and Irish sporting tradition ","title":"Match Day"},{"id":"57843318","text":"Th√©r√®se Kleindienst (25 October 1916 ‚Äì 3 July 2018) was a French librarian.

It is located south of Umm Salal Ali and west of Bu Fasseela. Etymology The word 'mazrouah' is Arabic for \\"the cultivated\\". Being located next to a large rawda (depression), rainwater would gather here, and as a result various shrubs and trees grew here, hence giving the impression that it is cultivated. In the past, inhabitants constructed wells in the village from whence they obtained drinking water and a source of irrigation for their crops. Nearby villages would also obtain water from these wells. History J.G. Lorimer mentioned Al Mazrouah in 1908 in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, stating that it lies \\"14 miles north-west of Dohah and 10 from the east coast\\". He also noted that \\"there is a masonry well, 7 fathoms deep, which yields good water. There are trees, but cultivation is wanting, notwithstanding the name\\". This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Infrastructure Al Mazrouah Yard hosts a farmers' market where consumers can purchase fresh produce. Niche products such as hydroponically grown fruits and vegetables are sold here. It is one of the three farmers' markets in Qatar as of 2014. Next to Al Mazrouah Yard is the Umm Salal Ali Central Fish Market. The Ministry of Municipality and Environment announced that it would be constructing a massive 270,000 square meter agricultural research complex in the village. One of the focuses of the complex will be developing new methods for hydroponic crop production. Officials provided a completion date of 2021 for phase one of the project. The Scout and Guide Association of Qatar has a camp set up over a 400,000 square meter area in the district. Located just off Al Shamal Road, it was constructed at a cost of QR 86 million and is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the world.

All 42 passengers aboard the second boat, Serenita, were rescued.  Capsizing of the Phoenix  On Thursday 5 July 2018, the double-decker cruise boat Phoenix PC Diving sailed from Phuket, one of the most visited resorts in Thailand, for Koh Racha, a popular snorkeling island off the coast of Phuket. She carried 101 people, including 89 tourists, all but 2 of whom were Chinese nationals, 11 crew members and a tour guide. The boat set off despite a severe weather warning against \\"strong winds and storms\\", which had been in effect since 4 July. Survivors reported that the sky was clear at the time of departure, and a number of other boats, including the Serenita, also ignored the warning. When returning from Koh Racha, the Phoenix was caught in bad weather off the coast of Phuket, with waves reaching 5 meters (16 feet) high. Somjing Boontham, the captain of the Phoenix, said that as the huge waves slammed the boat, his crew members frantically lowered the lifeboats and he urged the passengers to put on their life jackets. Some passengers, including children, made it to the lifeboats, but others were presumed to have been trapped inside the ship when she overturned and sank.  Search and rescue  A fishing trawler nearby arrived at the scene and was able to rescue 48 passengers from the water. Another woman was rescued several miles away from the boat, although several other people found with her were all dead. 37 people were sent to hospitals in Phuket for treatment. Phuket's provincial government organized a search-and-rescue mission involving helicopters and police and fishing boats. As of 6 July, 33 bodies were found and 23 people were still missing, all Chinese nationals. Most of the passengers found were wearing life jackets. Diplomats from the Chinese consulate and the embassy in Bangkok rushed to Phuket to visit the survivors and assist with search and rescue. Chinese divers who had gone to northern Thailand to assist in the Tham Luang cave rescue also went to Phuket to search for possible survivors in the sunken ship, which was believed to be under water.  Victims  As of 12 July, 46 people were confirmed dead and 3 were still missing. All of the dead and missing passengers were Chinese tourists, who constitute more than a quarter of foreign tourists in Thailand. 37 passengers on board the Phoenix were employees and family members of Haipai Furniture Company in Haining, Zhejiang Province. 19 of them were rescued.  Serenita and other boats  Another tourist boat, the Serenita, sank in the same storm near the small island of Koh Mai Thon off Phuket. All of the 42 people on board were rescued. A jet ski also sank and its occupants were rescued. Ten other boats were stranded in the storm on 5 July.  Thai response  Following the Marine Office's announcement that the police would take over the salvage investigation after the contracted salvage team dropped out, Immigration Bureau Maj-Gen Surachate Hakparn said the salvage operation would be completed by 12 November 2018. The salvage, utilizing a crane shipped from Singapore, contains important evidence for upcoming court cases according to the police.

It is India's first asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge. The pylon of the Signature bridge is the tallest structure in Delhi and is double the height of Qutb Minar with its 154-metre high viewing box, which acts as selfie points for visitors. It shortens the travel time between north and northeast Delhi. Background and History The old wazirabad bridge In 1997, 28 school students died in an accident on the narrow Wazirabad bridge. Since then, the Delhi government had plans to build another parallel wide bridge nearby to alleviate traffic congestions. By the end of 1998, the Delhi government finalised the draft plan for this bridge. However, the construction of the bridge was stuck due to multiple reasons - lack of manpower and financial difficulties, being the major reason. When the project started, its final cost was Rs. 1518.37 crore The Delhi government was tight handed and it was very difficult for it to shell out the extra rising budget. ‚Çπ1,518.37 crores of rupees have been sanctioned recently through PBDB. The work had started in 2010 on the bridge. A fresh deadline of end 2016 was set in 2013. Since then half a dozen times, deadlines have been missed and fresh deadlines set. Finally, the bridge was inaugurated on 4 November 2018 by the then Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal with the aim to ease the burgeoning traffic congestion on the existing Wazirabad bridge. Details The bridge is a Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge, a type of Cable-stayed bridge and in which cables were in a combination of radial and semi-harp arrangement; in which cables are spaced apart on the pylon, like the harp design, but connected to one point or a number of closely spaced points on the deck. The dynamically shaped pylon consists of 2 inclined columns, which are rigidly connected to the driving lanes and bend mid-way. The upper portion of the pylon anchors the back-stay cables as well as the main-span cables and the self-weight of the pylon balances out the self-weight of the super structure through the eccentric location of its center of gravity with respect to the pivot point of the pylon footing, reducing the load on back-stay cables which are fewer in numbers converged from the main-span cables. The bridge is 675 meters long and 35.2 meters wide. Built on the Yamuna river, this bridge connects east Delhi to Wazirabad. The bridge was designed with the intentions that when it would be opened for general public, the traffic pressure on the narrow and dilapidated old Wazirabad Bridge will ease out significantly. Just like the Eiffel Tower in France, Signature Bridge have the facility to transport tourists on top of the main pillar, which is 154 m high, from where distant views of North Delhi can be seen. * Structural Design Firm: Schlaich Bergermann Partner * Contractor: Joint venture of Gammon India, Tensa India& Construtora Cidade * Main span: 251 m * Height of pylon: 165 m above ground * Total length of infrastructure project: 6 km (approx.) * Lanes: 2 x 4 * Deck surface: 25,000 m2 * Total length of bridge: 675 m (incl. 100 m west extension) * Side spans: 36 m * Structural steel pylon: 5800 tonne * Structural steel deck: 7400 tonne * Open foundation: 6 nos. * Closed foundation: 16 nos.

The Foundation is located in the Palau Joan de Valeriola, a 14th century gothic building in the historic center of the city of Valencia. The Foundation has one of the most prominent art collections in Spain.  Collection  The collection was established by Alicia Soriano and Manuel Chirivella and is one of the most comprehensive collections of Spanish art. It includes majors works by artists such as Antonio Saura, Manolo Millares, Equipo 57, Equipo Cronica, Elena Asins, Jose Maria Yturralde, Jose Maria Sicilia and Dario Villalba among others. Since 2005, the collection has been presented in several thematic exhibitions, including shows devoted to geometric abstraction, the use of black and white colors in art, art and politics during the Spanish Transition to democracy, and color and poetry among other presentations.  Programs  The Foundation programs three exhibitions a year focussed both on interpretations of the collection and on contemporary and emerging artists. Since 2015, the Foundation hosts the World Press Photo in Valencia, the most prestigious exhibition devoted to photojournalism.  Palau Joan de Valeriola  The Palau Joan de Valeriola is one of the finest examples of the civil gothic architecture in the Mediterranean. The building was the residence of Joan de Valeriola, descendant of Arnau Valleriola, the most important financier in 14th century Valencia. The last member of the family that occupied the palace was Gaspar, who joined the Borja family after marrying Anna de Borja, niece of Pope Alexander VI. Its patrimonial and architectural value is based on its interior spaces, its unique Gothic elements (arches, windows, chairs) and the uniqueness of its wooden ceilings covered with great decorative details that were rediscovered during the rehabilitation of the building.

Overview The Dongfeng Fengshen A60 sedan debuted during the 2011 Guangzhou Auto Show and production started in December 2011, with the A60 being listed on the market in March 2012. The Dongfeng Fengshen A60 compact sedan shares the same platform as the later introduced Fengxing Jingyi S50 compact sedan with both cars based on the Nissan Sylphy produced by the Dongfeng-Nissan joint venture in China. The Dongfeng Fengshen A60 sits above the cheaper yet similarly sized Fengshen S30 subcompact sedan and Fengshen H30 compact hatchback. The prices of the Dongfeng Fengshen A60 at launch starts from 118,800 yuan to 139,800 yuan (17,110 to 20,130 USD). However a cheaper trim was added after the facelift in late 2012 lowering the MSRP to 86,800 yuan (12,500 USD). A second facelift completely changing the front DRG styling was released placing the Fengshen A60 sedan more inline with other Dongfeng Fengshen products with the new price range starting from 69,700 yuan to 83,700 yuan (10,040 to 12,050 USD).

The Fengshen A60 EV is based on the pre-facelift Fengshen A60 sedan, and has a range of 200 kilometers and a 130 km/h top speed with electric motor producing 95hp and 226nm of torque. The Dongfeng Fengshen A60 EV was renamed to Dongfeng Fengshen E70 after the facelift placing the E70 inline with the 2015 facelift of the petrol-powered A60. Aeolus E70 The Dongfeng Fengshen E70 received a facelift in 2019 and was revealed during the 2019 Shanghai Auto Show. The facelift sets the appearance of the EV further apart from the Fengshen A60 petrol sedan, and now carries the nameplate of the revised English brand name, Aeolus, in the rear.

Before her disappearance, she had been working as a realty agent and had been a dissident in China for a while. She went incommunicado from 4 July 2018 after uniformed men visited her apartment on the same day that she streamed live video from the square of HNA Group headquarters. The video showed her criticizing the Chinese communist party-style Dictatorship, authoritarianism as well as brainwashing process imposed on Chinese people. She is also shown splashing ink on a poster of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, whom she called a dictator on social media. An artist with an assumed name in Beijing complimented Feefeefly on her brave behaviour of daring to criticize the Chinese communist party for its wrongdoings that busted out the bubble of the CCP's deification. On September 9, 2018, the website Boxun reported that the administration of the hospital where Dong had been forcibly hospitalized was asked by officials to quietly feed Dong poison over a prolonged period of time, aiming that she would die while in the hospital and never be discharged alive.

A. Saleh, Malvin Carl Teich: Grundlagen der Photonik. Wiley-VCH, , Seite 825 (). The alloy broadening is one of the line broadening mechanisms. The random distribution of atoms in an alloy causes a different material composition at different positions. In semiconductors and insulators the different material composition leads to different band gap energies. This gives different exciton recombination energies. Therefore, depending on the position where an exciton recombines the emitted light has a different energy. The alloy broadening is an inhomogeneous line broadening, meaning that its shape is Gaussian. Binary alloy In the mathematical description it is assumed that no clustering occurs within the alloy. Then, for a binary alloy of the form A_{1-x}B_{x}, e.g. Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}, the standard deviation of the composition is given by:, Format: PDF, KBytes: 2005 :\\\\Delta x = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{x \\\\cdot (1-x)}{N}}, where N is the number of atoms within the excitons' volume, i.e. N = V_{exc} \\\\cdot n with n being the atoms per volume. In general, the band gap energy E_{g} of a semiconducting alloy depends on the composition, i.e. E_{g}. The band gap energy can be considered to be the fluorescence energy. Therefore, the standard deviation in fluorescence is : \\\\Delta E = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d E_{g}}{\\\\mathrm dx} \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{x \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1-x}{N}} As the alloy broadening belongs to the group of inhomogeneous broadenings the line shape of the fluorescence intensity I(E) is Gaussian: :I(E) \\\\sim \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\frac{(E - E_{0})^2}{2 \\\\cdot \\\\Delta E^2}\\\\right) References Category:Physical chemistry ","title":"Alloy broadening"},{"id":"57843639","text":"WhiteBox is a non-profit art space.

Plagiarism controversy In September 2018, South Korean production company DK E&M; (CEO Kim Dong-gu), the company behind the dramas Blow Breeze, Working Mom Parenting Daddy and Here Comes Mr. Oh, announced an intention to file a plagiarism lawsuit against SBS, its subsidiary SBS Plus and Shinyoung E&C; Group, accusing Let Me Introduce Her of \\"plagiarizing\\" the 1999 Japanese drama Beautiful Person. DK E&M; has been in talks with TBS (the original network of Beautiful Person) since November 2017 to produce a Korean drama adaptation of it, and was planning to broadcast the series in 2019 but that was affected, allegedly because SBS aired Let Me Introduce Her first. SBS has since denied the accusation, stating that \\"only the themes of plastic surgery and romance are similar\\" in the two dramas. It also plans to file a defamation suit against DK E&M; for the latter's \\"baseless\\" claims. On October 8, 2018, DK E&M; sought help from the Korean Television and Radio Writers Association regarding the controversy, saying that \\"the attitude of SBS regarding the situation was disappointing\\".http://star.mk.co.kr/v2/view.php?year=2018&no;=626562 Original Soundtrack Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Ratings *In the table below, represent the lowest ratings and represent the highest ratings. *NR denotes that the drama did not rank in the top 20 daily programs on that date. * N/A denotes that the rating is not known. {  ! rowspan=\\"3\\"  ! rowspan=\\"3\\" Original broadcast date ! colspan=\\"4\\" Average audience share - ! colspan=\\"2\\" TNmS ! colspan=\\"2\\" AGB Nielsen - ! width=\\"90\\" Nationwide ! width=\\"90\\" Seoul ! width=\\"90\\" Nationwide ! width=\\"90\\" Seoul - ! 1  rowspan=\\"4\\"  July 14, 2018  4.0%  4.2%  4.4%  4.6% - ! 2  4.9%  5.1%  5.3%  5.5% - ! 3  5.4%  5.6%  5.8%  6.0% - ! 4  6.6%  6.7%  7.1%  7.2% - ! 5  rowspan=\\"4\\"  July 21, 2018     - ! 6  5.4%  5.5%  5.8%  5.8% - ! 7  5.1%  5.3%  5.5%  5.7% - ! 8  6.5%  7.1%  7.2%  7.8% - ! 9  rowspan=\\"4\\"  July 28, 2018  5.2%  5.4%  4.8%  5.0% - ! 10  6.8%  7.3%  5.9%  6.4% - ! 11  7.2%  7.8%  6.4%  7.0% - ! 12  8.9%  9.6%  8.3%  9.0% - ! 13  rowspan=\\"4\\"  August 4, 2018  4.8%  5.0%  5.3%  5.5% - ! 14  5.4%  6.1%  6.6%  7.3% - ! 15  5.8%  6.3%  7.1%  7.6% - ! 16  7.0%  7.6%  8.4%  9.0% - ! 17  rowspan=\\"4\\"  August 11, 2018  6.0%  6.4%  6.6%  6.9% - ! 18  8.3%  9.0%  8.7%  9.4% - ! 19  8.5%  9.1%  9.3%  9.9% - ! 20    11.9%  12.3% - ! 21  rowspan=\\"4\\"  August 18, 2018  5.9%  6.4%  6.3%  6.8% - ! 22  7.8%  7.9%  8.6%  8.7% - ! 23  8.5%  8.6%  9.1%  9.1% - ! 24  10.2%  10.4%  11.8%  12.0% - ! 25  rowspan=\\"4\\"  August 25, 2018  5.3%  5.8%  5.7%  6.1% - ! 26  7.5%  7.7%  8.4%  8.6% - ! 27  7.6%  8.3%  8.7%  9.4% - ! 28  9.2%  10.1%  10.4%  11.3% - ! 29  rowspan=\\"4\\"  September 8, 2018  colspan=2 rowspan=12  6.9%  7.4% - ! 30  8.7%  8.5% - ! 31  8.5%  9.2% - ! 32  9.8%  9.7% - ! 33  rowspan=\\"4\\"  September 15, 2018  7.0%  7.5% - ! 34  8.8%  9.4% - ! 35  10.1%  10.7% - ! 36  12.0%  12.3% - ! 37  rowspan=\\"4\\"  September 29, 2018  8.0%  8.8% - ! 38  9.6%  10.3% - ! 39  10.4%  11.1% - ! 40   - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Average ! ! ! ! } Awards and nominations {  - !

It is bordered by Weinbergsweg to the southeast, Brunnenstra√üe to the southwest, Veteranenstra√üe to the northwest and Fehrbelliner Stra√üe to the northeast. The name Weinberg (vineyard) goes back to the vineyards that formerly occupied the hill on which the park is now situated. Since the late 1970s, the park has been designated as a garden monument (Gartendenkmal). Lawn for sunbathing, 2011 Caf√©, 1957 Heinrich Heine statue at the parks entrance Caf√©, 2011  History  A Gr√ºnderzeit (founders' period) development existed on the current park's location since the middle of the 18th century. In the area along the Invaliden- and Brunnenstra√üe, and from Fehrbelliner Stra√üe up to the level of Zehdenicker Stra√üe, was used as Mullberry plantation and housed the Villa Wollank. Later, the space was used as a garden pub and amusement site. From 1936, a part of the villa belonging to the park was leased to the city of Berlin and opened to the public. Several theatres opened on either side of the park, including the Walhalla-Theater with Carows Lachb√ºhne. During the Second World War, Allied Air Raids from 1943 onwards destroyed the buildings and developments around the current Weinberg park, with the area being cleared of debris after the war. In 1954-1956, the park was constructed according to the plans of landscape architect Helmut Kruse , who planned a richly structured park with diverse design and utilisation areas taking into account the hillside location. Between 1957 and 1958, the Caf√© am Weinberg building was constructed on the elevated plateau, offering visitors a panoramic view of the park. The building was designed by Hans Jahrig and Max Kowohl. In the southwestern corner of the park, a kidney- shaped pond was laid out, surrounded by a central lawn for sunbathing. The park occupied a special position in the Berlin green plan of the 1950s, as it is the only park of its size and consistently independent formal form, at a time when the restoration or renewal of war-damaged parks was the city's main focus.  Description  Between the remaining buildings of the Invalidenstrasse and the Weinbergsweg lies a rose garden with a fountain, a playground and a sports facility with a football pitch and table tennis tables, separated by a height offset on the north side. Other themed gardens, such as the Heidegarten, Schau- und Sichtungsgarten and the Alpinum, designed to introduce Berliners to a wide variety of plant types, are located along the main access paths surrounding the central lawn. In the northwest of the park stands Waldemar Grzimek's 1955 monument to poet Heinrich Heine, which was originally planned to be displayed in Kastanienw√§ldchen (Unter den Linden) in 1956. However, the sculpture was erected here in this people's park in 1958. On the base of the statue a quote from Heinrich Heine can be read: \\"We do not seize an idea but the idea seizes us and enslaves us and whips us into the arena like forced gladiators to fight for it.\\"  Usage  The lawn on the southwest slope is a popular summer sunbathing spot for locals. Below the lawn is an artificial pond, above a Swiss restaurant and caf√©, the rose garden, a playground and a sports complex with a football pitch and table tennis tables, all of which are used intensively. Although the residential area in the surrounding area is one of the areas with the highest number of children in Berlin, the park has not been adequately maintained for years. Only after residents demanded the repair in neighbourhood talks and by collecting signatures in order to counter the establishment of a drug scene, did the Senate make funds available for this garden monument. Regular checks are carried out in the park through the police station directly adjacent to the park. This and the reports in the tabloid press sparked a debate against a sweeping condemnation of dealers. Soon thereafter, in August 2007, the district council provided funds for the repair and extension of the park‚Äôs lighting system. Since the end of 2005, the Volkspark am Weinberg has been renovated with a budget of around one million euros.  Suburban Theatre at Weinbergsweg  Julie Gr√§bert (1803‚Äì1871), better known as Mutter Gr√§bert (Mother Gr√§bert), was in charge of the Suburban Theatre at the Weinbergsweg from 1854 onwards. The theatre quickly became known in the city because of its ‚Äûprimal Berlinism‚Äú (original Berlinism, a reference to its use of Berlin dialect). Here the 'Berliner Posse' found a home next to the established Wallner-Theater. The Suburban Theatre was ultimately a victim of the Gr√ºnderzeit period - after Gr√§bert's death in 1871, it was demolished in 1873 and Zehdenicker Stra√üe was built in its place. Julie Gr√§bert was buried in the nearby Elisabeth-Kirchhof cemetery.

The Golden Bangle In 1957 Tunku Abdul Rahman had called for an emergency UMNO meeting at Dewan Hang Tuah in Bandar Hilir, Malacca where he lamented that the party did not have sufficient funds to help to send him and his delegates to Britain for negotiations of independence, and asked for donations from the public. He had reportedly shed tears while saying so, which inspired Siti Rahmah to take off her golden bangle and donate it. She supposedly said \\"This was a gift from my father for my wedding, but use it to aid in your fight for the country,\\". She then walked around the hall asking the crowd to contribute to the fight for independence. \\"Those who are inside and outside this hall, please make donations to help Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj to go to London for the sake of the people and nation,\\" she said. Inspired by her selflessness, men purportedly took off their rings, gold wristwatches and even the gold handles off their walking sticks, while women pledged earrings, brooches and dress pins.

Early life and education Tobach was born on November 7, 1921 in Miaskovka, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was then part of the Soviet Union. Both of Tobach's parents were Jewish, which led to them and their daughter having to flee the country to avoid pogroms soon after Tobach was born.

She would continue to work at the American Museum of Natural History for the rest of her career. During her career, she also served on the faculty of NYU, Hunter College, the CUNY Graduate Center, and Yeshiva University.
